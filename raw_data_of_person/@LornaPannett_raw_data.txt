So easy to not realise the power of a vote in the referendum. Even the experts seemed a bit perturbed on the night.
970793760425693185 2018-03-05 22:50:43 UTC <LornaPannett> @JamesMelville @ks_1968 Yes would love to know if this is conspiracy theory/ cognitive dissonance on the part of remainers or blatantly the reason for Brexit...

969890268681031680 2018-03-03 11:00:34 UTC <LornaPannett> @Tony_Robinson @ks_1968 I was being a bit flippant but any kind of border is going to be uncomfortable and difficult.
969886380234035201 2018-03-03 10:45:07 UTC <LornaPannett> @ks_1968 @Tony_Robinson I suddenly have visions of some horrific sci-fi or dystopian future with an invisible monitoring system that tracks movement over The Border. In my vision this is a very scary thing.
969589002025295872 2018-03-02 15:03:26 UTC <LornaPannett> @mikegalsworthy To me the question sounded like Please admit there will be a border and the response There will be no hard border. I think this subtle distinction is key. There will be a border - it may be firm... but never hard!

Only having a charge for residual waste and free (or reduced cost) recycling gives a simple incentive to recycle. Can lead to people putting waste in their neighbours bins - but thats not insurmountable.

966031662961262594 2018-02-20 19:27:51 UTC <LornaPannett> @notaspy @Scientists4EU This my theme for the week! The U.K. takes EU law, over thinks it, writes a super complex version into law and then feels duty bound to comply to the letter. This is not what most (any other?) EU countries do - they often just cut and paste the directive.
966016540595408896 2018-02-20 18:27:45 UTC <LornaPannett> @BorisJohnson @Anna_Soubry What does yes mean? Yes, I can state unambiguously that we wont put the GFA at risk or something less concrete. A simple yes appears to lack clarity.

965705794116308994 2018-02-19 21:52:57 UTC <LornaPannett> @CBItweets @cbicarolyn @BrexitCentral @EarlyOakR I did pause before the referendum to consider if setting our own agenda was worth a leave vote. But years of peace and the complex global network means being part of the EU gives us more clout. EU standards often world leading & so better China/India etc pulled up to meet us?
965698035975114758 2018-02-19 21:22:08 UTC <LornaPannett> @garrethhayes Interesting. Just having a conversation in Brexitland about how it is the U.K. that tends to make EU rules more complicated and then feel duty bound to follow them. The irony is that the complexity is often of our own making.
965686437424312321 2018-02-19 20:36:02 UTC <LornaPannett> Great to see this project getting underway!https://twitter.com/tidewaylondon/status/965613661472612352
965685961555435520 2018-02-19 20:34:09 UTC <LornaPannett> @BBCAfrica Energy from waste plants are expensive. Modern controlled landfills with methane and leachate capture alongside organised recycling can be a good interim step.
965683642252095488 2018-02-19 20:24:56 UTC <LornaPannett> @CBItweets @cbicarolyn @BrexitCentral @EarlyOakR Its not that we gold plate, I dont believe, its just that we over think and consequently make compliance more difficult than some other EU nations.
965683304669306881 2018-02-19 20:23:36 UTC <LornaPannett> @CBItweets @cbicarolyn @BrexitCentral @EarlyOakR I work in the environment sector and have seen us do it time and again with Directives and Regulations. We love to over complicate things AND to obey a rule. Its an unfortunate combination. Greece on the other hand keeps the rules simple and then ignores them...
965490947030167552 2018-02-18 07:39:14 UTC <LornaPannett> @CBItweets @cbicarolyn @BrexitCentral @EarlyOakR So really the problem is that us Brits love to take an EU rule, transpose it into U.K. law making it twice as complicated and then spend a lot of time and energy trying to meet our new super complex requirements. Is that the EUs fault or ours? We do do this a lot!
965347184819490818 2018-02-18 22:07:58 UTC <LornaPannett> @Humanists_UK Agreed

So many friends/colleagues dont talk about Brexit with family as they dont want to fight/upset anyone. Hearts can be changed at the dinner table if the right words are spoken.

I would be surprised if India and China gave us better terms for steel trade on our own?
964409697095708672 2018-02-16 08:02:44 UTC <LornaPannett> @thewastethinker Certainly better than open dumping. Linked to energy generation at least some of the value is recovered.

The EU doesnt tell us to increase or decrease public spending. That is up to our Government. We share stuff (like testing medicine) with the EU. We will need to fund this on our own - more expensivepic.twitter.com/HfcfnbvZOk
963174062783688704 2018-02-12 22:12:46 UTC <LornaPannett> @Mark_J_Harper @BrexitCentral But at the same time we need an invisible border between the EU and NI? How does that work?
962947994516643840 2018-02-11 07:14:27 UTC <LornaPannett> @rpmwebs Its a shame this is (I assume?) only shared withose who have a tax code? Does that mean that the unemployed and those on pensions dont have the information about how the tax we pay is spent? Or does everyone get sent something that looks like this for one reason or another?

962773171589079040 2018-02-11 19:39:46 UTC <LornaPannett> @LeaveEUOfficial @jude5456 As an example: from one perspective, 12.1 billion is roughly four or five times one estimate for the shortfall in social care funding; but from another perspective, its a bit less per household than one estimate for the food we throw away.

958852650774220801 2018-01-31 00:01:01 UTC <LornaPannett> @guardianeco So China is dealing with plastic pollution by no longer taking in every one elses poor quality plastic for recycling. Is that a good thing or a bad thing for the UKs fight against plastic pollution?
958788162016497667 2018-01-31 19:44:45 UTC <LornaPannett> Thats some gumption for a 9 year old. I chased back references to UKs 1 per household on waste coms once.

958068284678639618 2018-01-29 20:04:13 UTC <LornaPannett> @raygeorgeson @IainGulland This is an EU wide producer responsibility scheme to pay for packaging recycling. We use a different scheme in U.K. so doesnt mean recyclable in the U.K. (or in the EU actually).
958066933445865472 2018-01-29 19:58:51 UTC <LornaPannett> @plastics2fuel @BinStrap How easy are they to undo? Will they slow collections down?
958064930208567297 2018-01-29 19:50:54 UTC <LornaPannett> @LeaveEUOfficial So if its so bad to spend 2 years in the EU with no say on the rules, doesnt that mean we currently have a say? I thought the problem was we had no control over what the EU does? The EU and its rules are something we have actively contributed to, not passively had done to us.
957218981273899008 2018-01-27 11:49:24 UTC <LornaPannett> @OxonAndrew If you take a vase, it has one hole. To make it into an open cylinder you need to make another hole in the other end... so 2 holes?
957217203262287873 2018-01-27 11:42:20 UTC <LornaPannett> @OxonAndrew I started with one. Watched a you tube video of some guys arguing the point and decided that the answer is 2! My head hurts.

954119685615865857 2018-01-18 22:33:54 UTC <LornaPannett> @SimonRGandy May also be because it would interfere with the bin lift/slow collections down? But surely not beyond the wit of man to overcome?
