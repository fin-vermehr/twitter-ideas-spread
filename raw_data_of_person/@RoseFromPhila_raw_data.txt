964675228482916352 2018-02-16 01:37:51 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Notice that Bernie Sanders and Trump are the only two who did NOT disclose their taxes? Wonder why?

964674542433112065 2018-02-16 01:35:08 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Seems @chrislhayes brings up that Russians wanted to help Trump and Stein but deliberately leaves out that they wanted to help his Kissy, Kissy Love, -> Bernie Sanders ... Gwad Chris, you're Pathetic! Seriously! Where's FULL Disclosure??? re: #MuellerIndictment
964673844987523079 2018-02-16 01:32:22 UTC <RoseFromPhila> .@allinwithchris why the silence on Bernie? See "Mueller's Indictment"   43.  By 2016, Defendants & their co-conspirators used their fictitious  online personas to interfere w/the 2016 U.S. presidential election.... and to support *Bernie Sanders* and then-candidate Donald Trump.

Welp, still 50 minutes to go. Lets see if @chrislhayes mentions his love, Bernie too, who was helped by Russia! Betcha he does Not bring up Bernie
964663841174024193 2018-02-16 00:52:36 UTC <RoseFromPhila> So, @BernieSanders is quiet as a mouse being named in indictment how Russia supported and helped him just like they did Trump!

936091969603895296 2017-11-29 04:38:11 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @MaxBoot @Billbrowder Congrats Mr Browder. Well done! 
936090913717276672 2017-11-29 04:34:00 UTC <RoseFromPhila> I don't know but not trusting @RepKathleenRice seems she has some type of arterial motives for a freshman congresswoman. For being a former prosecutor, seems she has a big mouth, way too much to say, instead of gathering full information. I'd never want her on my team.
936060104411140096 2017-11-29 02:31:34 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No @nikkihaley not the 'world' closer to war... only USA closer to war, b/c other countries will NOT stand by the lunatic moron Trump. If there is a war, unfortunately America will go it alone! #GodHelpUs

936040067231047681 2017-11-29 01:11:57 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @jaketapper Seriously Jake, I love you to death! But..... how could you NOT have known? You worked closely with Teddy Davis, he was your producer. Did you just block it out? Just Ignore it? or It was none of your business? or What Jake? I'm shocked you haven't responded personally. smh here

936024497328738306 2017-11-29 00:10:05 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins You know where he got that idea?

903068909187817479 2017-08-30 01:36:20 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @TrueFactsStated @silentblue1978 Oh Phew!! Had me scared there! LOL
903068593809711104 2017-08-30 01:35:05 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @TrueFactsStated @silentblue1978 You like Trump?? What?? You're kidding right?
903067966941618178 2017-08-30 01:32:36 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @TrueFactsStated @silentblue1978 Seriously, it could happen! Dems need to hold governorship in NY 2018 to protect Trump not getting state pardon if Fed pardons are enacted.
903066952683442176 2017-08-30 01:28:34 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @CNNPolitics @MalcolmNance @Billbrowder A bullshit story! We all know Repugs will not question one of their own! Their all complicit!
903066347084632064 2017-08-30 01:26:09 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Yeah, sure, I'll believe it when I see it! Repugs will not investigate or question one of their own! Shameful!!!https://twitter.com/billbrowder/status/903053012159143937
903053666923540482 2017-08-30 00:35:46 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @TrueFactsStated 2) And that is what's F-ing Scary. So NY make sure you elect a Dem Gov in 2018 if not a Repug Gov will have pardon power to pardon Trump!
903053081050533888 2017-08-30 00:33:27 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @TrueFactsStated Let's hope Cuomo is re-elected or another Dem 2018 b/c if Repug is  elected as gov, he too will have power of pardon for state charges!

Gwad Chris, you're Pathetic! Seriously! Where's FULL Disclosure??? re: #MuellerIndictment
964673844987523079 2018-02-16 01:32:22 UTC <RoseFromPhila> .@allinwithchris why the silence on Bernie? See "Mueller's Indictment"   43.  By 2016, Defendants & their co-conspirators used their fictitious  online personas to interfere w/the 2016 U.S. presidential election.... and to support *Bernie Sanders* and then-candidate Donald Trump.

Welp, still 50 minutes to go. Lets see if @chrislhayes mentions his love, Bernie too, who was helped by Russia! Betcha he does Not bring up Bernie
964663841174024193 2018-02-16 00:52:36 UTC <RoseFromPhila> So, @BernieSanders is quiet as a mouse being named in indictment how Russia supported and helped him just like they did Trump!

947383880260218881 2017-12-31 08:28:13 UTC <RoseFromPhila> It's about time media & journalist start calling it what it is....  NOT "Collusion" but "Conspiracy", including YOU @chrislhayes @allinwithchris @MSNBC
947377566385655810 2017-12-31 08:03:07 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Media, as in 2015-2016 fascinated, rushing to be 1st, reporting Trump Tweets.  Main Stream Media is Worthless!   China & Russia helping North Korea. Russian& China tankers have supplied fuel to N.Korea on at least three occasions.   Media is only 911 on Trump's next tweets!
947251817402044416 2017-12-30 23:43:27 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Seriously @peterbergencnn NO!

Shame on you for  supporting him. https://twitter.com/theleadcnn/status/936351078030987265
936357163118841856 2017-11-30 22:11:59 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Shame on @BobCorker @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake to allow this tax bill to pass. Where is your compassion for the little people! #ShameOnYou! https://twitter.com/lolgop/status/936265679166197768
936355770266013697 2017-11-30 22:06:26 UTC <RoseFromPhila> I really, really like @jaketapper but Wow! Shocked he did NOT give statement on his producer Teddy Davis and if he had knowledge of his sexual predatory ways, yet he commented on the *secrecy* of congress knowing and not saying anything. What is it Jake why the silence? #Confused
936308067364491265 2017-11-30 18:56:53 UTC <RoseFromPhila> BREAKING ->> Whoa! Paul Manafort makes deal with Mueller! Mueller has the goods on him!

936097461558562816 2017-11-29 05:00:01 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @RepKathleenRice @T_Malachy It's called common sense, especially when you have experience in pre-judging people, you should use it. Have a good night. 
936094402405126144 2017-11-29 04:47:51 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @RepKathleenRice Ok into her 3rd yr. whoopi! and I Disagree! As a former prosecutor she should know this. She talks way too much without careful thought! Any prosecutor will tell you this and practice this.
936091969603895296 2017-11-29 04:38:11 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @MaxBoot @Billbrowder Congrats Mr Browder. Well done! 
936090913717276672 2017-11-29 04:34:00 UTC <RoseFromPhila> I don't know but not trusting @RepKathleenRice seems she has some type of arterial motives for a freshman congresswoman. For being a former prosecutor, seems she has a big mouth, way too much to say, instead of gathering full information. I'd never want her on my team.
936060104411140096 2017-11-29 02:31:34 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No @nikkihaley not the 'world' closer to war... only USA closer to war, b/c other countries will NOT stand by the lunatic moron Trump. If there is a war, unfortunately America will go it alone! #GodHelpUs

936041678862995456 2017-11-29 01:18:21 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @jaketapper Yes he is! A TRUE gentleman.... Which is why I am shocked he has NOT made a statement when he worked side by side with this producer. Don't want Jake's silence to speak volumes. He should give a statement!
936040067231047681 2017-11-29 01:11:57 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @jaketapper Seriously Jake, I love you to death! But..... how could you NOT have known? You worked closely with Teddy Davis, he was your producer. Did you just block it out? Just Ignore it? or It was none of your business? or What Jake? I'm shocked you haven't responded personally. smh here
936038583189860352 2017-11-29 01:06:03 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Just like clockwork every week or at least twice monthly @allinwithchris & the Bernie Show!

936024497328738306 2017-11-29 00:10:05 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins You know where he got that idea?

935285756041531392 2017-11-27 23:14:35 UTC <RoseFromPhila> @WhiteHouse @DrDinD @wokeluisa Instead of @PressSec @SarahHuckabee defending Trump slur she ought to get a speech coach! She always sounds like she has a mouthful when she talks. Also she needs to retire her summer curtain dress for the winter beside it being so ugly.  @whitehouse
935282650402709515 2017-11-27 23:02:15 UTC <RoseFromPhila> Oh not just her weight there's so much you could pick apart about Sarah that she surely would be livid!https://twitter.com/jethro_aryeh/status/935280642903785477
935277866719350784 2017-11-27 22:43:14 UTC <RoseFromPhila> I think it a Disgrace @RepKathleenRice puts @alfranken under umbrella of real predators of sexual assaulters. Typical of what some prosecutors do when it's clearly NOT the same. Do you have Factual proof Kathleen? You can't lump @alfranken same as @RepJohnConyers Shame on YOU!
