968910773291536385 2018-02-28 18:08:24 UTC <PhilippJFR> @mourner Thanks, I'm just blind apparently. Really great work! Considering upgrading from RBush to flatbush in bokeh:https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/7582
968906243736731653 2018-02-28 17:50:24 UTC <PhilippJFR> @mourner Are there benchmarks comparing the index creation to RBush?
968583674412322817 2018-02-27 20:28:38 UTC <PhilippJFR> @WindsorMann @davidfrum @eemptyspace @Patton_Division So sad, can't hold an argument so you deflect. White privilege is the result of discrimination against non-whites, so doesn't assert anything about a shared cultural heritage.
968569304563290114 2018-02-27 19:31:32 UTC <PhilippJFR> @WindsorMann @davidfrum @eemptyspace @Patton_Division And you do speak for white people? Also no, you lack reading comprehension. The Irish, the Italians, the Poles and many other groups have been oppressed, never white people as a whole, because "White" is not a meaningful cultural or ethnic grouping.
968567276164337666 2018-02-27 19:23:28 UTC <PhilippJFR> @WindsorMann @davidfrum @eemptyspace @Patton_Division African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews have cultural heritage that goes beyond their skin color largely due to oppression. White people trace our lineage back to nation states with very different cultural identities. Basing your identity on your skin color is just sad.
968519381398454273 2018-02-27 16:13:09 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ProjectJupyter @maartenbreddels @wuoulf Didn't know about VizDoom, that's really cool. Also possible using @HoloViews and @BokehPlots.pic.twitter.com/Ch0RY0vpwd
967780017739587584 2018-02-25 15:15:11 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ggreenwald Fox News agrees with you on this one thing for obviously partisan reasons, so they are now a bastion for diverse opinion unlike other media? You have to ignore their dishonesty and partisan hackery on every other topic for that to make sense.
964230861561520128 2018-02-15 20:12:06 UTC <PhilippJFR> @PK_Perspective @travisci Seeing issues with builds running 3x longer than usual and sometimes timing out. Is this likely to be related? Doesn't seem to match up with your description of the issue. Thanks for everything you do btw!
960525820354756613 2018-02-05 14:49:35 UTC <PhilippJFR> @jakevdp @BokehPlots @esvhd I prototyped something similar using HoloViews a few months back (https://anaconda.org/philippjfr/pandas_plugin/notebook). There might be a PyData London sprint to polish it soon.
956245115743465472 2018-01-24 19:19:36 UTC <PhilippJFR> @amazon @ijstokes Apparently they optimize box size to ensure that delivery trucks are fully packed and boxes don't shift around. So if there's a large empty space in a truck that's about to go out their algorithms will do things like this. There must be better solutions though.
955417808447397890 2018-01-22 12:32:10 UTC <PhilippJFR> @datashader @BokehPlots @HoloViews @scientificator Yes, it's now available in the new Datashader documentation: https://bokeh.github.io/datashader-docs/topics/landsat.html

949261566456815616 2018-01-05 12:49:28 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @BokehPlots @datashader @michaelaye Just looked into it and replied to the issue. Should be straightforward and would be happy to see a PR, otherwise I'll add it when I add QuadMesh support to geoviews to plot irregular meshes.
931242895973249026 2017-11-16 19:29:42 UTC <PhilippJFR> @NoelGallagher @Nigel_Farage @MThomas799 @PhurtFrank @lord_ferrigno The nice thing about facts is that they are true despite your nonrepresentative opinions.
931227399467003904 2017-11-16 18:28:08 UTC <PhilippJFR> @NoelGallagher @Nigel_Farage @MThomas799 @PhurtFrank EU citizens living in the UK are better educated, pay more in taxes and receive fewer benefits than UK citizens.

930253235457331201 2017-11-13 01:57:09 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @AneeceColt @LapThis Much like Trump threatened to sue his sexual assault victims, somehow that never happened either.
930252603916681216 2017-11-13 01:54:38 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @AneeceColt @LapThis "Threatens"
930251899156205568 2017-11-13 01:51:50 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @AneeceColt @LapThis Sure, he's free to file a defamation suit, but we both know that's not going to happen. The discovery phase would be a lot of fun though.
930240416322121728 2017-11-13 01:06:12 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @LapThis "Just asking questions" is just about the dumbest ruse imaginable. Keep supporting pedophiles, I'm sure that'll be popular with voters in future.
930238412984111104 2017-11-13 00:58:15 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @LapThis So your argument hinges on the fact that a creepy pedophile wouldn't go so far as to slightly inflate his job title a little?
930237254953553920 2017-11-13 00:53:39 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @Bill_Bing @LapThis So what you're saying is that he was in fact D.A. but you simply can't believe a serial pedophile would leave out the assistant/deputy part to inflate his ego while signing little girls yearbooks? Something smells indeed.
930235417210867712 2017-11-13 00:46:21 UTC <PhilippJFR> @benshapiro @LapThis @Bill_Bing Or you know, it stands for (Assistant) District Attorney, his job at the time.
929401078705160193 2017-11-11 17:30:59 UTC <PhilippJFR> @flowdock Since last night I've not been able to load flowdock at all, and am seeing lots of 404s in the JS console. Any updates?
928806801860067330 2017-11-09 02:09:32 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @taslanous Here is the notebook to reproduce this example: https://anaconda.org/philippjfr/holoviews_streamz/notebook You can follow the datashader Readme to get the data here: https://github.com/bokeh/datashader/tree/master/examples and I will be adding it to datashader examples soon.
927651403807510528 2017-11-06 21:38:24 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @Czambul And by "nearly every state" you mean about half.
927640776078700546 2017-11-06 20:56:10 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO And they require a permit to buy guns and theoretical and practical exams to carry one.
927631181277024256 2017-11-06 20:18:02 UTC <PhilippJFR> You need a permit to buy a gun in Switzerland, carrying a gun requires you to pass practical and theoretical exam and obtain another permit.
927627570807496706 2017-11-06 20:03:42 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @matinde We also have tutorial materials you can find here: https://github.com/ioam/jupytercon2017-holoviews-tutorial Will have an updated and expanded version of that up soon.
925553925499088896 2017-10-31 02:43:46 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ScottPresler @hamire05 @proudmerican9 You mean like a driver's license and registration?
923878288807866376 2017-10-27 11:45:23 UTC <PhilippJFR> @numba_jit @datashader @HoloViews @BokehPlots @DrTodd13 I haven't done any in-depth profiling but on my 4-core MacBook it was roughly a 4x speedup.
923246180192149506 2017-10-25 17:53:37 UTC <PhilippJFR> @jk_rowling @benmj16 So the Murdoch press is working class? Actual elites, i.e. the top 0.1% will profit, middle and working class will see shrinking paychecks.
922884504548708352 2017-10-24 17:56:26 UTC <PhilippJFR> @jmeppley @_inundata "!pip install ..." seems to work. There doesn't seem to be a way to manage environments though.
918492368743075840 2017-10-12 15:03:40 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD @holmestwins You don't seem to understand what what-aboutism is, so no, I don't know what you're referring to.
918456934713446401 2017-10-12 12:42:51 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD @holmestwins If I had told you that Obama officials were telling the truth and we should just trust them you would have rightly laughed me out the room.
918286110475857920 2017-10-11 01:24:04 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD Whether I agree is irrelevant, it's the law. Fascist.
918283012076457989 2017-10-11 01:11:45 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD So you'll preemptively destroy the constitution to protect it? Conservative indeed.
918282054281854978 2017-10-11 01:07:57 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD Ah so you want to ban speech because it **might** be inaccurate and the government says so? That's fascism.
918281249046847488 2017-10-11 01:04:45 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @socalmike_SD What's your proof it's fake? Because the government said so?
918253601306415105 2017-10-11 23:14:53 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ABC @catteadams If they were worried about farmers they could just write an exemption for them. It's not about farmers.

916024903106748416 2017-10-05 19:38:50 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @BokehPlots @twtAtul We also have plans for an expanded stats module along with documentation. Should land in the upcoming 1.9 or 1.10 releases.
916024659396702208 2017-10-05 19:37:52 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @BokehPlots @twtAtul All great feedback. We do have simple box+histogram plots, but at least histogram can be made easier still.
916009505510457344 2017-10-05 18:37:39 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @BokehPlots @twtAtul Could you expand? Is there smth in particular you're missing (plots, docs etc) or is it just unintuitive coming from standard plotting pkgs?
915642506813038600 2017-10-04 18:19:20 UTC <PhilippJFR> @datashader @HoloViews @rolltheturbines I think xarray's rasterio backend may be able to load envi data. Try loading it with http://xr.open_rasterio(file)
915624977528971268 2017-10-04 17:09:40 UTC <PhilippJFR> @numba_jit @darribas Code is available here: https://github.com/bokeh/datashader/blob/master/examples/landsat.ipynb Note that it requires dev releases of @HoloViews, @datashader and @BokehPlots.

905059723493466112 2017-09-05 13:27:07 UTC <PhilippJFR> @shadihamid Do you really believe that the most atheist countries like Japan, Scandinavia and Czech Republic are struggling with social stability?
904868951385141249 2017-09-04 00:49:04 UTC <PhilippJFR> @albrgr @jbarro Don't think that's the implication, could be that we'd be seeing more moderate GOP pols, who would be more competitive in that environment.
903328106798305281 2017-08-31 18:46:18 UTC <PhilippJFR> @PrisonPlanet @LToddWood Dude, you're editor in chief! Wasn't about to give you clicks to find out whether you simply published or wrote this drivel.
903318833888460809 2017-08-31 18:09:27 UTC <PhilippJFR> @PrisonPlanet @LToddWood "The elites like Kaepernick" writes a columnist and Wall Street bond trader. That's almost beyond parody.
889866611963899904 2017-07-25 15:15:07 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @agapow That's probably our dependency on matplotlib. Hoping to make that optional but not quite there yet.
887398290228215808 2017-07-18 19:46:54 UTC <PhilippJFR> @HoloViews @ramnarasimhan Thanks for the kind words! Always happy to hear feedback.
887398033121574912 2017-07-18 19:45:52 UTC <PhilippJFR> @SciPyConf @ramnarasimhan Yes, I did, I've been using it for years and it has never let me down.

Only stats I can find are that both are better educated than UK natives.
878370604172423168 2017-06-23 21:54:06 UTC <PhilippJFR> @timfarron @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may @CarolineLucas @LeaveEUOfficial @aboutpopulation @UnnaturalGeek @swalesey_LUFC Not true, UK has among most lax immigration controls of EU countries, UK government has simply been incompetent and playing you for fools.
878368647852380161 2017-06-23 21:46:19 UTC <PhilippJFR> @timfarron @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may @CarolineLucas @LeaveEUOfficial @aboutpopulation @UnnaturalGeek @swalesey_LUFC Thanks, that's awkward phrasing. Do tell me one thing though what % are from EU? If Cons care so much about immigration why blame EU?
869198075415416832 2017-05-29 14:25:44 UTC <PhilippJFR> @redsteeze Are we pretending the Iraq war never happened and didn't cause long-lasting damage to US standing in the world?
867307070990823425 2017-05-24 09:11:34 UTC <PhilippJFR> @JonahNRO @NickFreiling According to parents he did not have access at all. Read the parents WaPo OpEd.
866312526761529344 2017-05-21 15:19:36 UTC <PhilippJFR> @Sophiemcneill @rafsanchez @JamesIvarie Maybe you should consider the context for just a second. Iran is repressive and far from a democracy but it's not Saudi Arabia.
866203554872258560 2017-05-21 08:06:35 UTC <PhilippJFR> Best survey of the Python Vizualization landscape I've seen. Thanks @jakevdp for explaining HoloViews so well! https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/866193686710804480
862464560967680000 2017-05-10 00:29:09 UTC <PhilippJFR> @BBCWorld @ronwilliamswv Respect is earned not given, especially since she essentially bought her position with campaign contributions.
862463108668948481 2017-05-10 00:23:23 UTC <PhilippJFR> @BBCWorld @ronwilliamswv Betsy DeVos is the one who is poorly educated.

847866367386816512 2017-03-31 17:41:09 UTC <PhilippJFR> @MattBruenig Because of your blatant abuse of statistics. Do you still stand by grouping WoC (6% Trump support) with white women (54% Trump support)?
846391960369876992 2017-03-27 16:02:23 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ggreenwald @MattBruenig In a slightly more skewed scenario you could have made the same point even though zero PoC voted for Trump.
846391012733915137 2017-03-27 15:58:37 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ggreenwald @MattBruenig What I see is people calling out the dishonesty of lumping in 5m PoC with 20m white women to make a point.
846388141338628096 2017-03-27 15:47:12 UTC <PhilippJFR> @MattBruenig @ggreenwald @ijbailey @danhusman The problem is, you're lumping 5 million PoC in with 20 million white women to make that point
846381318678220802 2017-03-27 15:20:06 UTC <PhilippJFR> @solon594bce A 12% gap is solid. Romney won white women by 14%, Trump by 4%. Race was lost among uneducated white men.
846378904730439680 2017-03-27 15:10:30 UTC <PhilippJFR> @solon594bce The fact that white women voted for him was already known. You also seem to misunderstand statistics, female split was 54/42.
846377992494465026 2017-03-27 15:06:53 UTC <PhilippJFR> @solon594bce Can't disagree that it was a bad campaign but that doesn't change the fact that you lied and are now deflecting.
846377278804250624 2017-03-27 15:04:02 UTC <PhilippJFR> @solon594bce If it were true maybe, Clinton won 54% of the female vote.
846344526348341250 2017-03-27 12:53:54 UTC <PhilippJFR> @MattBruenig You do clarify @ggreenwald framing makes it seem surprising. Problem is aggregating WW and PoC obscures more interesting trends
846337075003740160 2017-03-27 12:24:17 UTC <PhilippJFR> @MattBruenig @ggreenwald This is asinine, "The majority of candidate Xs votes came from 66% of the electorate" is not a headline.
843882792131923969 2017-03-20 17:51:50 UTC <PhilippJFR> @nprpolitics They believe? Neutral reporting is nice and all but what else caused a year long vacancy?
828186296212393984 2017-02-05 10:19:34 UTC <PhilippJFR> @DavidRoseUK If journalistic ethics were as strict as rules around scientific fraud you'd be out of a job now.
826559946498179072 2017-01-31 22:37:02 UTC <PhilippJFR> @AndresL31833527 Bots are ubiquitous on Twitter, ~15% of users on controversial topics. Most not very sophisticated, some are getting there.
826409923802169345 2017-01-31 12:40:54 UTC <PhilippJFR> @euchrid @IsraelTrump1 Case in point.
826396440087891969 2017-01-31 11:47:19 UTC <PhilippJFR> @euchrid True, my guess is it's a chat bot loaded with standard phrases, but that's indistinguishable from what they sound like normally.
826392940725551105 2017-01-31 11:33:25 UTC <PhilippJFR> @IsraelTrump1 @euchrid It's a bot.
826133459403960321 2017-01-30 18:22:20 UTC <PhilippJFR> @NateSilver538 I suspect the expected and actual scores will converge as mid-terms approach and purple state Reps grow a spine.
826113703527534592 2017-01-30 17:03:50 UTC <PhilippJFR> @ScienceMarchEdi I'll be there.
