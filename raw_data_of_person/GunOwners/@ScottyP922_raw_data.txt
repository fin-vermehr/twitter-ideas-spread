971572597782704132 2018-03-07 02:25:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @FollowTheMenace @Justin_Gaethje @TheRealTySmith Yeah I don't know how that fight isn't PPV.
971489688354787331 2018-03-07 20:56:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 Pretty good time to grade the front office though. Or is 20 plus years not enough, Rob?
971488341370769408 2018-03-07 20:50:44 UTC <ScottyP922> GSP is correct. Getting f'ng beheaded by the true King would be terrible for his legacy.   #UFC #RIPGSPhttps://twitter.com/UFCONFOX/status/971485850256121856
971487916978470914 2018-03-07 20:49:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher Maybe it has something to do with having a fake GM and Director of Personnel, Todd. Pathetic that you would mention one and done playoff berths as vindication of a failed front office.

971205793235259393 2018-03-06 02:07:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @Jon_Anik MMA fans so consumed by their hate that they can't be happy to see these avenues open up for our athletes. It's the greatest sport in the world and these fighters deserve these opportunities.
971201012424937472 2018-03-06 01:49:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Just watched @Justin_Gaethje / @FollowTheMenace  for about the 100th time. One of my favorite fights of all time. Thank you gentlemen for showing how great this sport can be. #Respect #UFC
971186863603113984 2018-03-06 00:52:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMALatestNws I want to see him try 135.
971157545200037894 2018-03-06 22:56:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Yeah those Brazilians are racist.
970883401808056321 2018-03-05 04:46:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @Rhod_morgan But Conor is an incredibly better striker. With far too much range, accuracy and power for Frankie.
970835416126455809 2018-03-05 01:36:15 UTC <ScottyP922> I refuse to get hyped for #UFC223 until they're off the scales.   Fool me four times and I'm just a sucker.
970834941717241856 2018-03-05 01:34:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @ChuckMindenhall Frankie is one of the greatest to ever do it. It's almost like finally getting finished reminded everyone of how amazing his career has been. He's an all timer. He'll be back but he has nothing to prove.

970525304811872262 2018-03-04 05:03:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @Rhod_morgan Conor would fold Frankie up as a warm up to a real fight. He just got stiffened against a guy who isn't anywhere near the striker. Not in the same zip code. He'd get killed against Conor. Not one moment of a competitive fight. Like Eddie but worse. You're desperate.
970498532301049857 2018-03-04 03:17:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @WhatTheFFacts Why do I feel like you're insulting my mother here?

970181895320416256 2018-03-03 06:19:23 UTC <ScottyP922> If Frankie can make 135 without killing himself I think he's a threat there. #UFC222
970181298378756096 2018-03-03 06:17:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Make no mistake, @FrankieEdgar is the man. He has nothing to be ashamed of. Champion. Hall of Famer. Legend. His greatness can not be questioned. #UFC222
970175524600459264 2018-03-03 05:54:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani She is going to brutalize Nunes.
970174698813345792 2018-03-03 05:50:47 UTC <ScottyP922> When Conor left the division I figured Max would be a very long reigning champion but this Ortega dude is something else. I don't know. #UFC222
970174202224537600 2018-03-03 05:48:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA At the risk of my head, I must disagree. He deserved to live, King.
970173996481335296 2018-03-03 05:48:00 UTC <ScottyP922> If only little Frankie could get ahold of Conor they say.   KO'd by a Jiu-Jitsu specialist.   Now imagine what the King would have done to the little guy. You were trying to get him killed.  Levels. #UFC222
970129589350608896 2018-03-03 02:51:32 UTC <ScottyP922> I still think Dern could lose this 29-28. #UFC222

970119629694697472 2018-03-03 02:11:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Impressive win for Hernandez. His hero is TJ Dillashaw. Hopefully his mental retardation doesn't hamper his future. He's got a lot of potential.  #UFC222
970106967606878209 2018-03-03 01:21:39 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't care how many times he loses, Hector Lombard scares the shit out of me. #UFC222

If Colby loses his title fight then a fight with a guy like Usman makes sense. Right now it doesn't.

He's earned his title shot.

967512268111056896 2018-02-24 21:31:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Bermudez round.
967456162772914176 2018-02-24 17:48:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @darbycrash81 They also ignore that when RDA pulled out, Edgar was asked to take the fight and he declined. They asked Aldo, Edgar, then went to Nate.
967455672353861637 2018-02-24 17:46:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @Watche15 I don't believe so.
967285560481144832 2018-02-23 06:30:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Liberalism. Canceling a fight for that is ridiculous.

967231786169372673 2018-02-23 02:56:42 UTC <ScottyP922> Seriously. If you are an adult MMA fan and you truly believe Conor McGregor ducked little Frankie Edgar, by fighting Mendes and Aldo and RDA which turned into Nate and then Alvarez, you are a complete tool. You can't be taken seriously. #UFC
967230827678568448 2018-02-23 02:52:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ColbyCovMMA Colby doesn't just talk. Check the resume, virgins.

967228543523487746 2018-02-23 02:43:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Mark Henry also claimed Eddie Alvarez was going to expose McGregor.   Fook Mark Henry, yeah?

967039901853155328 2018-02-23 14:14:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom That towel trick works surprisingly well.
966851468673404928 2018-02-22 01:45:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @HelmanDC Hahaha. Yeah, hilarious. A washed up relic holding a position hostage because the team is run by two frauds who think like fans.   The writers are as bad as the front office.
966840006139629569 2018-02-22 00:59:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @ashleyw4gg Well then we agree. I just get tired of reading one side of it. Conor on the ground. There's another side where Khabib is vulnerable. He has never faced a striker like McGregor.
966839530316845058 2018-02-22 00:58:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @ashleyw4gg He works on wrestling. He's just not a wrestler. No matter what he does in training he will not be competitive grappling with Khabib. He has to win the fight on his feet early and he can do that.   That fight will be one sided one way or the other.
966837636353658880 2018-02-22 00:50:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @ashleyw4gg Now tell me again how I only like MMA because of McGregor.
966837518690869249 2018-02-22 00:50:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @ashleyw4gg I was telling the full story. You were telling half of it.   If it stays on the feet, Conor beats Khabib like a child. If it goes to the ground Conor gets mauled by a bear.
966836010175823872 2018-02-22 00:44:02 UTC <ScottyP922> And you're a "fucking casual" if you don't think Khabib needs to fix his stand up to fight Conor.   They only ever tell half the story.https://twitter.com/ashleyw4gg/status/966823413913407489
966835543362371584 2018-02-22 00:42:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @Snyder_man45 I'd take him up on that offer.
966802045402603520 2018-02-22 22:29:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Depends. Do you want to be considered the best in the world? Then you have to fight in the UFC.
966796869018976258 2018-02-22 22:08:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Why would #1 give a shit about #2 and #3?

966786081030098944 2018-02-22 21:25:38 UTC <ScottyP922> In fairness to Frankie, it wouldn't have been right to make that fight late notice. He wasn't training to face the greatest FW of all time. He was training to face Max Holloway. #UFC #OnlyOneKing
966784240103972864 2018-02-22 21:18:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 When RDA pulled out Frankie was given an opportunity and he declined. So did Aldo. Then they turned to Nate.
966783445295927296 2018-02-22 21:15:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 His manager's the biggest shit talker in the sport.
966783156883017728 2018-02-22 21:14:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @alper_huncho @BishopSS1Le Frankie's too overmatched on the feet. Conor has the range, power, accuracy. Frankie would be overwhelmed. If you want to beat McGregor you have to have size on him. It's why Nate gives Conor hell. He's a bigger man who can take the shots.
966782154016460801 2018-02-22 21:10:02 UTC <ScottyP922> This is the guy who took Chad Mendes on 10 days notice, instead of waiting for his title shot, in a camp where he couldnt wrestle because his knee was shot but no....he couldn't possibly be willing to get in there with that monster Frankie Edgar.   S. T. F. U. #UFC #FTheMMAMedia
966777569789046789 2018-02-22 20:51:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 He wouldn't have success in the UFC, he wouldn't beat a wrestler, Aldo will surely kill him, no way can he handle fighting a top UFC lightweight.   They know shit.
966776282838196226 2018-02-22 20:46:42 UTC <ScottyP922> The scumbag MMA media, the ones Conor McGregor made to look like complete assclowns, are falling over themselves right now disputing his claim he was willing to fight big bad scary Frankie Edgar.   Tell us more. You've been so right about him so far. (Give my best to Hosay) #UFC
966774065703931904 2018-02-22 20:37:53 UTC <ScottyP922> I like Frankie. He is a true warrior. But part of me would have liked to have seen McGregor get that fight next month. It would be like putting a newborn fawn into a cage with a lion. #UFC
966765180314152960 2018-02-22 20:02:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Nobody's safe.   Someone get Frankie to respond to his near death experience.

966683044068384769 2018-02-22 14:36:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm hearing the hang up is where they'll keep the heads.
966183826752987137 2018-02-20 05:32:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 I doubt it. I don't think Conor wants to validate that fight with his presence.
966145849997840384 2018-02-20 03:01:35 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm stunned by how many MMA fans really don't know what they're watching.   Levels, folks. Levels. Cowboy is target practice for a sniper like McGregor. It's not even remotely competitive.   His head goes back to Dublin.

965691497009082368 2018-02-19 20:56:09 UTC <ScottyP922> This is the genius who says a two time UFC world champion ( who dominated Max Holloway on 1 leg) is like a 40 year old wishing he could have made it to the majors.   Moron. Party of one.https://twitter.com/ChrisLongshot/status/965690672371118080
965684345397764097 2018-02-19 20:27:44 UTC <ScottyP922> What's rich is this is probably coming from an Aldo, Silva, GSP worshipper.   Dominated. On one leg. Deal with it.https://twitter.com/ChrisLongshot/status/965683757566058496
965681237380739073 2018-02-19 20:15:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin I didn't realize Max turned down a title fight at a higher weight class or 100 million to box Mayweather to defend his title.   He got dominated on one leg. Nothing more needs to be said.
965677944537481216 2018-02-19 20:02:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial And "where he was" was the undisputed King.

965629150450118659 2018-02-19 16:48:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @MoveTheSticks Seems like there's a strong CB class every year.  Much stronger than WR typically.
965627828028010496 2018-02-19 16:43:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @benshapiro And that's coming from the people who start #PrayFor hashtags after every Muslim terror attack.

965464835138949120 2018-02-18 05:55:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @emullah I agree. Nate being himself is embarrassing because Nate Diaz, like Nick Diaz, is a complete moron.   Nate already beat up Cerrone.
965463148500258817 2018-02-18 05:48:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @emullah It's funny unless you've matured past a child. Then it's idiotic and embarrassing.
965462863132405761 2018-02-18 05:47:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboycerrone @TeamKhabib @UFCONFOX Seems like Cerrone is expecting Ferguson to get worked by Khabib.
965462454166802433 2018-02-18 05:46:01 UTC <ScottyP922> It's amazing how many simpletons think a grown adult putting a joint in his mouth on TV is like OMG the funniest thing ever.   I bet the reaction would have been different had it been McGregor.   It's a street trash Diaz thing. #UFCAustin

965365198495408129 2018-02-18 23:19:33 UTC <ScottyP922> The main event is a tough one for me. Cerrone's more skilled, Yancy more durable. Cerrone is near the end, Yancy is coming on strong. I'm thinking Yancy but it's hard to imagine Cerrone losing 4 in a row. #UFCAustin

964975389750824962 2018-02-17 21:30:35 UTC <ScottyP922> F @NASCAR and their bloated rulebook. It's why the sport is dying. #NASCAR #XfinitySeries

Floyd gave his back because he can't handle a true fight. If he does that in the UFC, and he will, he's a dead man. It's a night off for McGregor. A warm up.
964966070078640128 2018-02-17 20:53:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @iamblazen @moore2704 No. It was rules that put Floyd in that position. If the two fight without rules we are planning Floyd's funeral.
964960525191872513 2018-02-17 20:31:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @iamblazen Floyd needs rules. Conor doesn't need any rules.

964727710496034816 2018-02-16 05:06:24 UTC <ScottyP922> It would take a lot for me to boo these fighters live like that.   Respect these warriors. We're on the safe side of the fence. #Bellator194

964719970407145472 2018-02-16 04:35:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan @bryangahagan35 Agreed but he told Ariel not too long ago that he doesn't have the need to go to the UFC. Hopefully he's just posturing for contract negotiations.
964719411222470656 2018-02-16 04:33:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I mean, Punk has legit BJJ training. I'd imagine he'd molest a novice like Floyd on the ground but he would be so overmatched on the feet that it might not matter.   Let's just hope it never happens.
964718788804530177 2018-02-16 04:30:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Did you see the two Alvarez/Chandler wars in Bellator? I'd love to see a 3rd fight in the UFC. Doesn't seem like Chandler has much interest though. He's happy there.
964717050047451136 2018-02-16 04:24:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Chandler too.
964715645718925314 2018-02-16 04:18:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Look at Ariel dropping the F bomb on us.
964706776611475456 2018-02-16 03:43:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That was brutal to watch.

964693487944978433 2018-02-16 02:50:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial I like Max and he's a phenomenal fighter and better today than he was then (so is Conor) but what Conor did that day was extraordinary and he doesn't get enough credit for it.

963861670304116736 2018-02-14 19:45:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting So they booked a fight between two men then.

963214168705916929 2018-02-12 00:52:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @VirtuallyTommy It may have been hindsight to you but some of us were aware of Dak's flaws and how protected he was his first year. A real GM knows talent and operates with foresight. Dallas doesn't have that. Which is why they haven't won in over 20 years.
963184796418695168 2018-02-12 22:55:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @VirtuallyTommy It could have realistically happened if they had a real GM and not an egomaniacal owner pretending he's one.

962774651494682630 2018-02-11 19:45:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting He should get a rematch with Rockhold if Luke's staying in the division.

962577591491231744 2018-02-10 06:42:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @dee_bhoy He's been in the UFC for years. How long does a "star" need?
962522771942199296 2018-02-10 03:04:46 UTC <ScottyP922> If you bought this PPV, congrats....you are an MMA degenerate like me. #UFC221
962521584476065795 2018-02-10 03:00:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin Oh, he dares to mention him.   I like this guy. Backed up the performance with equally impressive work on the mic. He will be remembered.

962513828427821056 2018-02-10 02:29:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin I would want to wear shoes if my fight's next.
962513259562721280 2018-02-10 02:26:58 UTC <ScottyP922> And he's got personality on the mic.   That's how you do a post fight interview.  Just work on your takedown defense and the sky's the limit. #UFC221
962506054939619328 2018-02-10 01:58:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Ok, now let's see what all the buzz is about with Adesanya. 11-0, 11 KOs. UFC debut. #UFC221

961724626094186497 2018-02-08 22:13:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Wait. So Rockhold started out the underdog? How?
961692375918751746 2018-02-08 20:05:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA Since I've followed Colby, I've held a girl's hand and went out on a supervised date. It's really paying off.
961666771097997314 2018-02-08 18:23:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin Fighter code. Brown, like McGregor, has bled on the battle field. The rapper hasn't.

961622644192940033 2018-02-08 15:27:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani No promoter on the planet could make you care about this fight. It's a squash match. It's not remotely competitive.

961615232358649856 2018-02-08 14:58:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BulletValentina @DamonMartin And on a related note, Damon Martin is reporting Valentina Shevchenko is the new Flyweight Champion.
961487176205774848 2018-02-07 06:29:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin I won't believe it until it's done. Floyd isn't that stupid. He will get murked.
961417257996967936 2018-02-07 01:51:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @madness_mma Gall knew he had to get it on the ground quickly or it was lights out. Nobody's standing with Punk.

961348067743158274 2018-02-07 21:16:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani If Ariel had his way as soon as someone got their feelings hurt in the Octagon it would get waved off. Then counseling for all involved.
961332141677273088 2018-02-07 20:13:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Rockhold rivals Khabib as the most dominant top game in MMA. I think he breaks Romero. #UFC221

960036902782095360 2018-02-03 06:26:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Anders fought an all time stupid fight. He gave the win to Machida. I felt like I was watching a black Sam Alvey. #UFCBelem

960002239715823616 2018-02-03 04:09:04 UTC <ScottyP922> The mind games at work. Tim Johnson had a beard for weigh ins but shaved it back to that glorious lip rug we know and love for the fight. Expect Golm to come out tentatively. #UFCBelem
959999811989725186 2018-02-03 03:59:25 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't care what the scorecards say, when you've got a stache as sweet as Vera's you're no loser. #UFCBelem
959993471766614017 2018-02-03 03:34:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin Good thinking. I can't imagine who Punk fights though.
959990220946100224 2018-02-03 03:21:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Round of the night. What a fight. #UFCBelem
959988892677165056 2018-02-03 03:16:02 UTC <ScottyP922> The filthy animals are chanting for death again. #UFCBelem
959987887939911680 2018-02-03 03:12:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Great now I got to sweat my mother-in-law getting ahold of a megaphone.
959986539450204161 2018-02-03 03:06:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Fight of the night for me.
959984598921990146 2018-02-03 02:58:58 UTC <ScottyP922> You pretty much have no shot to get a decision over a Brazilian there if the fight is even remotely close. #UFCBelem
959983862532247557 2018-02-03 02:56:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Polyana_VianaDF @danawhite Easy, Dana. She's young enough to be your daughter.
959966899676344321 2018-02-03 01:48:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani For instance, I'd pay to watch Gaethje/Poirier.
959966484465442816 2018-02-03 01:46:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I don't think a PPV has to be headlined with a title fight.
959959427888500736 2018-02-03 01:18:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA Tough way to go out. He's better than that..
959957205272420359 2018-02-03 01:10:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Something in the air tonight. Bet Brazil.
959952498567077888 2018-02-03 00:51:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I didn't expect such a dominant performance.
959952076141924352 2018-02-03 00:49:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Is that Figueiredo's natural hair color? #UFCBelem
959950023457935360 2018-02-03 00:41:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @DonaldJTrumpJr Everyone just has to stop worrying about offending someone. These people are bat shit crazy.
959949669689450496 2018-02-03 00:40:10 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor is King. #UFCBelem
959939565820809216 2018-02-03 00:00:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Blessed that he left the division era. #KingMac
959888889447092224 2018-02-03 20:38:39 UTC <ScottyP922> TJ/Cody 2 would be great but that's not happening at #UFC222. I'd be shocked. Not with the DJ fight on the horizon for Dillashaw.
959887450628902912 2018-02-03 20:32:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @TJDillashaw @Cody_Nolove I love this game.
959884746590388224 2018-02-03 20:22:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @DUANEBANGCOM @TJDillashaw @arielhelwani Yeah I didn't think he'd go for it. That's not happening.
959884038084407297 2018-02-03 20:19:23 UTC <ScottyP922> MMA injury bug, do what you wish with the rest of the spring schedule but please leave #UFC223 alone.
959863936576380929 2018-02-03 18:59:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN @arielhelwani We can't have nice things.
959579356191514624 2018-02-02 00:08:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Did anybody look down? He was there.
959579087915372545 2018-02-02 00:07:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I want you to support all the Americans. = Racist Nationalists  I want you to support all the Brazilians. = Empowering  #LiberalLogic
959552481876434949 2018-02-02 22:21:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie A weak card gets weaker.
959470633720655872 2018-02-02 16:56:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet If she wanted to go full truth she would have told the dude he's a dude.
959469084835532800 2018-02-02 16:50:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet @SuperBowl And it's this liberal cancer that's destroying the league.
959455872803098624 2018-02-02 15:58:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie People can hate all they want for Colby speaking the truth about Brazil. He deserves a title shot.
959240839041077248 2018-02-01 01:43:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @Justin_Gaethje @theMMAcommunity I mean, who isn't? Gaethje is must see TV. He's not capable of being in a boring fight.
959240455975251968 2018-02-01 01:42:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet You mean he wasn't really a bodybuilder?
959239975295508482 2018-02-01 01:40:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Does anybody have any fucks to give this man? Because he just. doesn't. have. any. #KingMac
959238908046381056 2018-02-01 01:35:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet @PoliticalKathy Miss Kathy, you're on the wrong side of the political spectrum to get any help from Twitter.
959219782758424576 2018-02-01 00:19:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @FloydMayweather @DeeganMarcus @UFCONFOX If he does it against McGregor we'll be planning Floyd's funeral.   Stay retired, Floyd. You want no parts of a real fight.
959154810095357954 2018-02-01 20:01:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarolinaMMA Is that a model or a fighter?
959121948767936515 2018-02-01 17:51:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Floyd wouldn't last a round with the worst LW on the UFC roster let alone McGregor. He's merely playing. The boy doesn't have the balls to engage in a real fight.
959095971543216129 2018-02-01 16:07:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet "You're slurring a woman. It's disgraceful. Please get back to slurs on men." #LiberalismIsCancer
958930452177408001 2018-01-31 05:10:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @John_Kavanagh He also let everyone keep their heads tonight.   He never stops giving.
958870969749331970 2018-01-31 01:13:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Sometimes cultural enrichment gets a little messy.

958777942024359943 2018-01-31 19:04:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Another deleted tweet but they can't hide their hate. Trump didn't create it, he exposed it.
958718698033950720 2018-01-31 15:08:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @WiolaDavid Which is what he said but that didn't make for a good headline.
958718228527755264 2018-01-31 15:06:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This is the media's bastardized interpretation of what he said.
958544767868170245 2018-01-30 03:37:36 UTC <ScottyP922> "I think Woodley would fare well against McGregor."  That's nice, Dan. But since when has the MMA media had the slightest clue what Conor is capable of? If he listened to you people he wouldn't be where he is today.https://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/958521880859701248
958543064292843520 2018-01-30 03:30:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @chrislhayes Because you have a mental illness, Chris.

958520314442518528 2018-01-30 02:00:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MarkDice Seat belts are racist. It would be almost as Hitler-ish as giving the ok (white power) hand sign.
958501975762628608 2018-01-30 00:47:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @JorgeLinares @VasylLomachenko He'd get pummeled like a ring girl in the UFC. Welcome to real fighting, "Champ".
958500893787336705 2018-01-30 00:43:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Quit beating around the bush, coach. The suspense is killing us.
958416528663371777 2018-01-30 19:08:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin If Khabib had huge star potential he'd be a star now. He isn't because he doesn't. Most casual fans would find his fights boring compared to the strikers.
958415936566030336 2018-01-30 19:05:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @FloydMayweather You don't have the balls.
958397113355956225 2018-01-30 17:50:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sunkist1207 @evil_ecco @DamonMartin Well other than overcoming adversity. Her legacy is tainted by the way one loss destroyed her.
958151921738682370 2018-01-29 01:36:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @PokerDean @Ealvarezfight LOLOL.   Eddie scores another KO.
958078894560763905 2018-01-29 20:46:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's cute how he thinks he has that power.
957998300069842945 2018-01-29 15:26:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial When you're a fan of #1 who gives a shit what #2 plans to do to #3? #KingMac
957836979785347073 2018-01-28 04:45:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @ramonashelburne @arielhelwani It's too soon. Check back some other decade.
957452694221975553 2018-01-27 03:18:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc The reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
957450574928244736 2018-01-27 03:09:40 UTC <ScottyP922> And if there was any doubt Bisping has a bad eye, he thought Fili won his fight tonight.   Damn you, Vitor. #UFCCharlotte
957449172172660738 2018-01-27 03:04:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Trilogy! Trilogy! Trilogy! #UFCCharlotte
957446744983433223 2018-01-27 02:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @Qyngali I agree with the 30-27 but yes that's a big issue. I'm not one to complain about judging but tonight has been particularly bad.
957443322775293952 2018-01-27 02:40:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Worst decision on a night of several questionable ones.
957443064368435200 2018-01-27 02:39:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I'd say the 29-28s for Fili were more questionable.
957442851113177089 2018-01-27 02:38:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @TouchyFili @ufc Garbage decision. Bermudez pieced Fili up.
957442376880017409 2018-01-27 02:37:05 UTC <ScottyP922> The judging has been horrible tonight. #UFCCharlotte
957427241360687104 2018-01-27 01:36:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Some odd judging tonight. #UFCCharlotte
957426998934110208 2018-01-27 01:35:59 UTC <ScottyP922> It's hard not to be a fan of Camacho. He fought the 2nd half of that fight on heart alone. #UFCCharlotte
957412888964157440 2018-01-27 00:39:55 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd be willing to PPV this if I don't have to hear Cruz talk about underhooks anymore. #UFCCharlotte
957412207658196992 2018-01-27 00:37:12 UTC <ScottyP922> Picking Green but rooting for Koch. Green is such a smarmy douchebag that he should be in MMA media. #UFCCharlotte
957411396265873410 2018-01-27 00:33:59 UTC <ScottyP922> I thought Kish and Borella won their fights. #UFCCharlotte
957408991981768710 2018-01-27 00:24:26 UTC <ScottyP922> It's a game of inches as Pepey was about to land a nasty knee. #UFCCharlotte
957406574376640514 2018-01-27 00:14:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz talks too much. #UFCCharlotte
957393083980754944 2018-01-27 23:21:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Is that Markos' natural hair color? #UFCCharlotte

957363191234924547 2018-01-27 21:22:26 UTC <ScottyP922> It's like a library in there. #UFCCharlotte
957363030031044608 2018-01-27 21:21:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Too many strikers ignore the body. Good clean body work by Sandhagen. #UFCCharlotte
957362577973170176 2018-01-27 21:20:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Now that is a debut. Very impressive. #UFCCharlotte
957128075451535361 2018-01-26 05:48:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Bobbypratt The fight is already booked. Stipe/DC in July.

957075652104065024 2018-01-26 02:19:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Stipe/DC Cyborg/Nunes TJ/DJ  Let's make this a night of super fights. #UFC226
957073170451894273 2018-01-26 02:10:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Jesus Christ, Conor....you just scared the shit out of me.

957052678638637056 2018-01-26 00:48:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys You mean the same front office that's failed for over 20 years? Good luck with that.
957051627512483841 2018-01-26 00:44:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I'll be rooting for DC. Stipe lost me with his Dana doesn't respect me/give the belt to my coach bullshit. #UFC

957003884060430336 2018-01-26 21:34:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA Colby would have his way with our women if we weren't all virgins.
957003151135199232 2018-01-26 21:31:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove I recommend "Conor" if it's a boy.
956902718865661953 2018-01-26 14:52:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Now imagine being in an earthquake with a toddler with a gun. You're pretty much screwed.
956709395555110912 2018-01-25 02:04:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @benfowlkesMMA Cool. Ben's gonna whine some more about McGregor.
956330872789262336 2018-01-24 01:00:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting They should call it UFC Netflix then.
956303042005143553 2018-01-24 23:09:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @HelmanDC Or they could, like, hire a real GM and President of Personnel instead of the owner and his son who have failed for 20 plus years.
956258322637877249 2018-01-24 20:12:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Nelson was absolutely eye poked several times in his last fight including moments before he was finished. Should have been a no contest.
955980871235964928 2018-01-23 01:49:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @DonaldJTrumpJr Proving that @nflcommish is an anti-American SJW cucked liberal. The owners are insane keeping him around.
955961824356306944 2018-01-23 00:33:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @seniorbowl @dallascowboys It's good to see him looking so old.
955932023834775553 2018-01-23 22:35:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange People have a right to change their mind.
955628287929221120 2018-01-22 02:28:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @McShay13 You only have 31 players listed. Ranking went from 27 to 29.
955627657252753414 2018-01-22 02:26:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Don't think a 300k headliner is in any position to dictate who they fight and when.
955615422916845568 2018-01-22 01:37:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @francis_ngannou @Unclecreepymma Agreed. He's a future champion.
955523771867238400 2018-01-22 19:33:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Look at the liberal media trying to tell us how to think again.
955452763185598464 2018-01-22 14:51:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow LOL. The Russian doesn't understand business.
954929144055390208 2018-01-20 04:10:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Yes. I think he's the best 170 lber in the world.
954927094789795840 2018-01-20 04:02:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Good luck.

954892191645782016 2018-01-20 01:43:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @FabricioWerdum @arielhelwani Probably is the next in line.
954870681216454656 2018-01-20 00:18:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Even if Ngannou loses tonight I would still expect him to regroup, develop a little more and win the belt down the road. There's too much talent there. #UFC220
954869675359338497 2018-01-20 00:14:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Ring rust. #UFC220

954854279193550848 2018-01-20 23:12:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBurtonXP I'm pretty sure it's a celebration for being the most privileged beings on Earth.
954852201414955008 2018-01-20 23:04:39 UTC <ScottyP922> So many assume DC's gonna win that nobody asked what if he doesn't? Does he retire? If he goes out on his back again I wonder if this will be it. #UFC220
954845847795261445 2018-01-20 22:39:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Either way it's going to be a great story. The UFC's Mike Tyson marches on or we have the longest reigning HW champ in history. #UFC220
954807748188925955 2018-01-20 20:08:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @FrankieEdgar That's one awesome gym.
954807066794889216 2018-01-20 20:05:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Has to be the HWs.
954782556775419904 2018-01-20 18:27:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Why is Ariel so obsessed with this? He cares more than the fighters involved.
954769468680560640 2018-01-20 17:35:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting So we know Khabib isn't really undefeated.
954744815618490368 2018-01-20 15:57:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan It's a situation he put himself in. He's illegal. He did it to himself.
954706014821142528 2018-01-20 13:23:46 UTC <ScottyP922> I keep reminding myself how well rounded and battle tested Stipe is and how raw and green Francis is but I just don't think it's going to matter. All it's going to take is one clean shot. Just too much power. #AndNew #UFC220
954705265185755136 2018-01-20 13:20:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColusaCasino @RobSchneider Beautiful lady, Rob.

954580203522658304 2018-01-19 05:03:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, look. It's the arrogant MMA media again. Sit silently in the corner and they will teach you all about the sport.https://twitter.com/mookiealexander/status/954579199452303361
954574810130079744 2018-01-19 04:42:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @stevengaines5 I know in your small mind you think that means something. It's simply a product of cashing a 9 figure check boxing Mayweather. A fight none of these guys could ever make happen but him.
954554882014539776 2018-01-19 03:23:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc For about another 24 hours.
954551831077715973 2018-01-19 03:11:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Maybe they remembered Conor manhandling him on one leg. Tough to get out of the mind.
954548780468244480 2018-01-19 02:58:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @OliverMcGee Welcome to your country, young lady. You are what America is all about.
954527390419570688 2018-01-19 01:33:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @FrontRowBrian @JTFOz I couldn't agree more. It's the worst media in all of sports. Very promotion and fan unfriendly. I don't mean everyone but most.
954522876086013952 2018-01-19 01:16:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @AliAbdelaziz00 Ali's favorite movie is Bill and Ted's Excellent Endeavor.
954507868572700672 2018-01-19 00:16:24 UTC <ScottyP922> I want to say there's no way Volkan can beat DC but MMA has humbled me too many times. Plus we have to see what getting KO'd for the first time has done to DC's chin. If anything. #UFC220
954506298678267904 2018-01-19 00:10:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite After Saturday Stipe will get back to more safer things to do than stepping into a cage with Francis Ngannou. Like running into a fire.
954505562770853893 2018-01-19 00:07:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @DonaldJTrumpJr Great family. I apologize for the crazy half of the country.
954498969245224962 2018-01-19 23:41:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I don't know why this is so shocking. Check the numbers. There isn't a fighter on the roster even remotely close to Conor as a draw. His PPV is like half a year of PPVs without him. And I don't care who likes it.
954490862117048320 2018-01-19 23:08:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMATruthTalk Exactly right, my friend. They are trying to do this without creating a rift with their biggest star. Actually, their only star.
954489259330887680 2018-01-19 23:02:27 UTC <ScottyP922> When Conor does one of these press conferences you get a couple hundred thousand viewers. This one with 2 champs got about 25 thousand.   There's a reason why the UFC treats Conor differently and you would too if you owned the company. #UFC220
954487978767933440 2018-01-19 22:57:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamKhabib @TheNotoriousMMA @UFCONFOX Conor could finish anyone at 145 and 155 in seconds. All it takes is one clean shot. So yes he could. Doesn't mean he will. It means he could.
954486921916571648 2018-01-19 22:53:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @joannamma Kill her.
954486633675591680 2018-01-19 22:52:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani They're gonna fight for the real belt. Then the winner will be stripped and the belt given to Conor.
954485401510653953 2018-01-19 22:47:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma @rosenamajunas @ufc #TeamJJ
954485193355743232 2018-01-19 22:46:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Somebody tell Dana Khabib's striking stats include on the ground.  It doesn't mean what he thinks it means. #UFC220
954474838239965184 2018-01-19 22:05:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach, do you feel like strangling a few Democrats for me?
954474441924374528 2018-01-19 22:03:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Can't blame Conor for being late this time. #UFC220
954469551009419264 2018-01-19 21:44:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiberalLogic123 We're sorry you're a liar.

954435829010718720 2018-01-19 19:30:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFLprguy @RapSheet That's a load off my mind, Ian. So the token interviews were given? Thank God.
954414878613229570 2018-01-19 18:06:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @Acosta @Cernovich @Chet_Cannon @simplecynts @AnthonyScarramu I bet she runs out of ammo first.   But we'll always have "I'd rather live with illegals than people who steal from tax payers." to remember her by.
954413738106540034 2018-01-19 18:02:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMikeyHutch @BloodyElbow Pretty neat graphic. Should do all divisions.

954238512454406146 2018-01-18 06:26:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @JoelEmbiid It's the least we could do for the man making basketball in Philadelphia relevant again.
954155303448252416 2018-01-18 00:55:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @NHLFlyers Thank you, 88.
954151183236640768 2018-01-18 00:39:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma DC's gonna grind him out.
954150784861724673 2018-01-18 00:37:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Because in the manner he beat Jon Jones there is no need for a rematch.
954146276819587072 2018-01-18 00:19:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Not surprising.
954145963551215617 2018-01-18 00:18:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @HiSmileTeeth @TheNotoriousMMA This man removes or whitens teeth. Your choice. #KingMac
954118341081419778 2018-01-18 22:28:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Where can this "racist" white boy vote for that man in an election? Keep fighting the good fight.
954099730442870784 2018-01-18 21:14:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump @francis_ngannou @arielhelwani Ariel spreading his liberal agenda again.   "Francis, what do you think of my delusionally liberal take on what I think the President said? Please respond even though you are completely uniformed. I like to take shots at the country I use for my benefit."
954096768530206720 2018-01-18 21:02:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll I view Conor as the greatest of all time and his idiot haters as being so comically wrong over the years. Remember, this was a guy who wasn't even UFC caliber. LOL.
954096152382668801 2018-01-18 21:00:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll He actually mentions Conor's sub game being a threat to Khabib too. Listen, I'm Team McGregor for life but I'll get a sex change operation if he subs Khabib. He must be beheaded.
954022447002550272 2018-01-18 16:07:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @DanTomMMA Wait. My mistake. Last fight was a no contest.
954022294778720256 2018-01-18 16:06:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @DanTomMMA You have DC's record wrong.

953287470166179841 2018-01-16 15:26:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @EASPORTSUFC @Cody_Nolove That they're sleeping on your grappling because of your striking.
953269905817825280 2018-01-16 14:17:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting Rich Franklin says hello, coach. Still, that is crazy tough. Nobody can question whether Paige is a fighter.
953062410662957057 2018-01-15 00:32:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi @MMAFighting Life is good for the big man. Happy for him. Run through Stipe and he'll be making much more in the future.
953061328461148166 2018-01-15 00:28:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Sick fight.
952940834214830081 2018-01-15 16:29:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @mookiealexander Probably true but you have to give her a mulligan here for the broken arm. Happened in the 1st round.
952928403224694784 2018-01-15 15:40:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet My God, I should turn myself in.

952790994679975936 2018-01-14 06:34:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @MarkDice I remember Jim back when he was sane.
952782910909833216 2018-01-14 06:02:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor wants to come back in September. The #UFC won't wait that long. So right now they're working on Tony/Khabib in the spring with Conor getting a title shot in the fall if he wants it. Per Dana on the post fight show.
952782251028295681 2018-01-14 05:59:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @antontabuena Hasn't DJ been at the top of PPVs and had a season of TUF centered around him? He's been marketed. He's just not a draw.
952780509565849601 2018-01-14 05:52:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor is getting stripped. Dana pretty much came out and said it tonight. #UFCSTL
952774486981533697 2018-01-14 05:28:34 UTC <ScottyP922> That was a bit of an early stoppage. #UFCSTL
952764145459482624 2018-01-14 04:47:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @PaigeVanzantUFC Paige, you are ridiculously tough. Be proud of that performance. Most would have quit.
952763821365620737 2018-01-14 04:46:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I hope Choi, he's got the bigger upside but Stephens looked his best last fight.
952763420025196548 2018-01-14 04:44:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @KalishekPaden Was definitely it. Ouch.
952761994284883971 2018-01-14 04:38:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow If she had the skills to match her heart she'd be unbeatable.
952761104278736896 2018-01-14 04:35:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Paige is supposedly fighting with a broken arm. People can say what they want about her but she is a true fighter. Heart of a warrior. #UFCSTL
952760632062939137 2018-01-14 04:33:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @EliasTheodorou Because saying 29% would have just sounded arrogant.
952755676723535873 2018-01-14 04:13:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA deserves a title shot not going backwards to fight a guy ranked at the bottom of the top 10. #UFCSTL
952753448189079552 2018-01-14 04:04:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Meek's a tough SOB. Much respect. He gave it everything he had to the bell despite being dominated. #UFCSTL
952748525158371328 2018-01-14 03:45:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Usman is the Khabib of the WW division.

952744713395867649 2018-01-14 03:30:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Definitely. Usman looks like a title contender.

952743695274606593 2018-01-14 03:26:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman A lot like the Bektic fight. Completely outclassed until he wins it.
952742949682667520 2018-01-14 03:23:14 UTC <ScottyP922> WTF. I'm never picking against Elkins again. #UFCSTL
952742268221509632 2018-01-14 03:20:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh What about Santiago "the eye poking cheat" Ponzinibbio?
952741974108508165 2018-01-14 03:19:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Darren Elkins is stupid tough. What a chin. Poor Menace. He goes from Gaethje to this. #UFCSTL
952740039104106497 2018-01-14 03:11:41 UTC <ScottyP922> Only Darren Elkins can pull off that tattoo. #UFCSTL
952739704088219649 2018-01-14 03:10:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Very true but less fights means less opportunities for fighters.
952739151266439168 2018-01-14 03:08:09 UTC <ScottyP922> I know Elkins is crazy tough but I think if Johnson's cardio holds up with the weight cut it's his fight to lose. #UFCSTL
952738674634084352 2018-01-14 03:06:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @nakedsherdogger Yep. Very fan unfriendly media.

952735525303128064 2018-01-14 02:53:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Very interested to see Michael Johnson's debut at 145. #UFCSTL
952720111466622978 2018-01-14 01:52:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh He is...the most interesting coach in the world.
952718416258969600 2018-01-14 01:45:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani It's annoying but better than the crowds in Brazil chanting for a fighter's death.

952339047397167104 2018-01-13 00:38:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani If there's really been so many more problems since they've gone to early weigh ins it's irresponsible to keep doing it.
952267906406068224 2018-01-13 19:55:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA So much for safer weigh ins.
952267597957009409 2018-01-13 19:54:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA @dark_gone Probably the same or less since the switch.

952028026291785728 2018-01-12 04:02:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I agree. Tony/Khabib for the real title in the spring.

951981311442513920 2018-01-12 00:56:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Holy shit he's the double greatest.
951936387640684544 2018-01-12 21:58:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial It would be a thrashing. Kind of like when the King manhandled him on one leg.

Or Max, DJ, Woodley, DC, TJ or anyone else active. The UFC doesn't have any stars right now which is why PPV sales were so terrible this year.
951884778881605632 2018-01-12 18:33:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs @DustaJus5 It hasn't been on a decline for awhile genius. The UFC had their biggest year in PPV in 2016. It plummeted right after not because of some moronic excuse of streaming but their stars left. No Conor, no Rousey, no Jones. The casuals don't care anymore.
951872240047542272 2018-01-12 17:43:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs @DustaJus5 Yes streaming. Everybody decided on January of 2017 to stream PPVs turning the UFC's biggest PPV year in 2016 to one of their very worst n 2017.   That's what it is. Streaming. These are huge stars and stuff.
951869684512645121 2018-01-12 17:33:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial It's a winnable fight for Conor.

951867184636153856 2018-01-12 17:23:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Welcome to the big leagues, Jimmy.
951841159286059008 2018-01-12 15:39:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Khabib will do as he's told. He has no leverage.
951832205558337536 2018-01-12 15:04:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @AJPrice803 When it fits Ariel's agenda. He's been trying to claim both are stars for awhile now. Two stars in the main event of the end of year card does 300k buys and he feels vindicated.
951830341265879040 2018-01-12 14:56:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani LOLOL. A 300k PPV between two supposed stars. And he's claiming victory. LOL. It would have been one of the worst selling PPVs on 2016. Ariel has zero credibility.
951828470740471808 2018-01-12 14:49:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting F Khabib.
951826670511689728 2018-01-12 14:42:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs 300k is a terrible number. It would have been one of the worst selling PPVs in 2016. With Rousey retired, Conor AWOL and Jones suspended the UFC doesn't have any stars right now.
951825824252071936 2018-01-12 14:38:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs Yes. That's what I'm saying. Popular among our small group of hardcore fans but no drawing power to get the casuals which is what stars do. Otherwise she's not doing 300k PPVs on the end of year card. The numbers don't lie.
951825006845157377 2018-01-12 14:35:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs I'm not even comparing them to Conor. Rousey was a star. She does a million on her own.
951824716096040961 2018-01-12 14:34:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting @V5nobs Stop. It is not. It's the end of the year card with two supposed stars at the top of it according to Helwani. If that was truly the case the card does near a million buys or more. The truth is they aren't stars.
951823378071121920 2018-01-12 14:29:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @davemeltzerWON @MMAFighting Yeah but that isn't saying much. 340-380k buys? But Ariel keeps saying both women are stars. How is this possible?
951563221961494536 2018-01-11 21:15:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Definitely. That is a very top heavy PPV.

950964716180004864 2018-01-09 05:37:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Maybe because those Brazilians aren't harassing him and chanting for his death.   Just a guess.

950757996702978048 2018-01-09 15:55:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @shubkaran11 @AlexMagas97 Totally disagree. The fight being in Brazil doesn't make it even slightly more interesting to any casual fan. The casual fan won't even know where it's at. This seems like blaming the promotion for fighters who lack star power.
950753484743368711 2018-01-09 15:37:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @AlexMagas97 @shubkaran11 Nobody is willing to buy Cyborg/Nunes if it's in Brazil but not if it's in Vegas. The fight is either worth it to you or it's not.
950753323933667329 2018-01-09 15:37:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @AlexMagas97 @shubkaran11 Mentioning Conor's gate as some sort of norm is even dumber. All these fights together wouldn't match that gate. The point is the percentage of revenue on a PPV card is slanted heavily toward PPV sales and not ticket sales.
950750499829100544 2018-01-09 15:25:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @AlexMagas97 Sure, if they have a problem selling tickets, yes but PPV is a much bigger revenue generator than ticket sales. Ariel is just taking another shot at the UFC. As if these fighters are stars but being held back by the promotion. Not true.
950747415316967424 2018-01-09 15:13:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Nobody's buying a PPV because of location. A star sells no matter where it's at.

950196333255778305 2018-01-07 02:43:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeganA_mma Megan, when Conor McGregor first signed with the UFC the popular opinion was that he wasn't UFC caliber. F them all. They can't define you.
950195108896542720 2018-01-07 02:39:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Most Cowboys fans feel blessed to have Zeke. He carried that team to the playoffs last year. No Zeke. No playoffs. Period.

949467518611197952 2018-01-05 02:27:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Its only a weird situation because he's media and they protect Brazilians. She didnt care about the division fighting Holm. Suddenly she cares now. Its because Amanda's from Brazil. She's stated several times she doesnt want to fight her due to that. But still they pretend. #UFChttps://twitter.com/SJSamano/status/949465742205792258
949416736176197637 2018-01-05 23:06:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @wweglitchmaster Agreed. A much more entertaining fight.
949395984844513281 2018-01-05 21:43:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @GiveWayMayDay lol but 145 is competed at  elsewhere lol which is where Megan became a legit contender lol in Cyborg's eyes lol.   She fought Holm and doesn't want to fight Nunes simply because Nunes is from Brazil. She's admitted it.
949395074315685888 2018-01-05 21:39:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He's a tougher fight for anyone than Ferguson and Ferguson's world class.
949323538774806529 2018-01-05 16:55:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Said after fighting Holm. Who has no wins at 145. She simply doesn't want to fight a Brazilian. They're racist like that.
949121756962402304 2018-01-04 03:33:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 He'd need to be in camp this month.
949120406413369346 2018-01-04 03:28:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 True but he was training. I just question what Conor will look like with two years off and living fat with 100 million. If he doesn't have that obsessed focus anymore then just retire.
949093694807953410 2018-01-04 01:42:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Same thing happened to Conor....and then he kept dominating Max Holloway.   You remember that, MMA media? @MMAFighting @BloodyElbow @sherdogdotcom #UFChttps://twitter.com/MMAjunkie/status/949084785124806656
949092619891695618 2018-01-04 01:38:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX No.
949089451078283269 2018-01-04 01:25:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Why didn't Holm have to do that?   She just doesn't want to fight Amanda because she's racist like every other Brazilian and doesn't want to fight any one from Brazil. She admitted as much. #UFChttps://twitter.com/MMAjunkie/status/949070966327529472
949087659925876741 2018-01-04 01:18:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting Easy to criticize when you're not on the receiving end of the kick.

949064313037377538 2018-01-04 23:45:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I agree with her but the pickings are slim matchmaking Cyborg. You are essentially setting up squash matches. Holly was her most capable opponent in terms of style match up.
949063323856850944 2018-01-04 23:41:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @lailah_elliott @itz_mizdee I knew it was a bad idea for you to watch that channel.
948977057979133952 2018-01-04 17:58:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I hate the two year layoff for McGregor if he does wait until the fall. He's wasted two years of his prime in MMA. I understand the big pay day boxing Floyd but as a martial artist he'll never get that time back. Hate it. #UFC
948976536992079872 2018-01-04 17:56:52 UTC <ScottyP922> You're going to end up with Ferguson/Khabib in March/April for the LW belt. Conor comes back in the fall to maybe challenge the new champ or take a money fight like Diaz. #UFC
948976069281017858 2018-01-04 17:55:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 Sad that even the Cowboys writers don't understand what this team used to be. Tom Landry would throat kick Rob out of the building rationalizing mediocrity like that.

948667963581915137 2018-01-03 21:30:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @HistoryInPix Man, they pretty much nailed it.
948624413423034375 2018-01-03 18:37:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @Notorious_Picks Said immediately after telling me to stop blowing a dude.   Is there an adult there I can talk to by any chance? You seem as young as Max was when Conor destroyed him.
948617378077794304 2018-01-03 18:09:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Notorious_Picks I don't give a shit who your favorite fighter is. You're a moron. I knew that when I saw you trying to pretend Max was a teenager when Conor schooled him.
948616408899997696 2018-01-03 18:05:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks You keep repeating the same thing. Like a retarded parrot. Unfortunately there's visual evidence of Conor dominating Max in the 3rd round of their fight. I realize this was back when Max was in kindergarten but still.
948615303386320897 2018-01-03 18:01:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks There's levels to this and Max simply isn't on Conor's level.
948615065347018752 2018-01-03 18:00:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks He went 5 rounds with Diaz. Conor would dominate the early rounds of any fight with Holloway. As he dominated all three rounds the first fight. If it's not finished he'd be way too far ahead on the scorecards.
948613632115576833 2018-01-03 17:54:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks Yeah your point. That Conor beat up a 12 year old kid while he was in his prime. I've read it many times from you idiots. But the truth is both were early in their careers, the fight wasn't even remotely close and there is zero reason to believe anything would change today.
948612258430627840 2018-01-03 17:49:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks Yeah improvement. I understand morons like you keep trying to pretend only Max has improved. But Conor has too and the gap is too wide. Mentioning a boxing bout against the goat is laughably idiotic.   McGregor dominates Holloway. Again. It's not competitive.
948610560043593729 2018-01-03 17:42:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks Whatever flaw your small mind believes he has, Conor dominated Max on the feet and on the ground. Absolutely nothing would change in a rematch. You just think it would.
948592325084708864 2018-01-03 16:30:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks He was thoroughly dominated the first time. With Conor on one leg for half of it. Both have improved since.  Nothing would change now. The gap is too wide.
948587005780398081 2018-01-03 16:09:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Sure but a whole lot less interesting. It's to the point now where nearly half a year of PPV sales equals one McGregor PPV. He can downplay the impact all he wants it's crippling to the promotion.
948585250334105601 2018-01-03 16:02:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @kauannouer @Notorious_Picks He gets younger everytime I hear this story. Soon Conor will have beaten up a minor. He was 21 when McGregor schooled him and a rematch today would be the same result.
948584383702880256 2018-01-03 15:58:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm sure everything would be okay if he could have kept fighting wrestlers overmatched on the feet.
948378221870972928 2018-01-02 02:19:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @Cody_Nolove @birnie_tyler TJ doesn't want that rematch until he has to. He knows the bell saved his ass in round 1.
948377762187956224 2018-01-02 02:17:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @jimmyjm1616 I do. She's looks like a man. She's got the strength of a man. She deserves to be ridiculed for it.
948371984261541889 2018-01-02 01:54:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @jimmyjm1616 That's what I meant. Should have been more clear. I think it's pathetic that someone loses their credentials stating the truth.
948358500643737600 2018-01-02 01:01:00 UTC <ScottyP922> If anyone's confused by #4, he's the guy Conor absolutely schooled on one leg. #UFC #BlessedHeLeftTheDivisionErahttps://twitter.com/ConormcGregor5/status/948354972692992000
948357120302469121 2018-01-02 00:55:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi @MMAFighting Pathetic. Please don't point out that she's a clear cheat.

948335973192077314 2018-01-02 23:31:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow As. He. Should.

948051436948123648 2018-01-01 04:40:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA "I don't think about Conor."  Turns out that was number one bullshit.

947999410419634176 2018-01-01 01:14:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @1luis8 Because she's Brazilian.   It's an MMA media thing.

Ask Aldo.   It's a huge challenge for the champion. It's also a challenge for Khabib. Beating Barboza doesn't provide the answer to this martch up is all I'm saying.
947912910520705024 2018-01-01 19:30:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @arielhelwani @TeamKhabib @mattolive10 @JenningsDamian Conor would have to land something big early or he'll get taken down and beat up by Khabib. Who doesn't know that? But to suggest Barboza presented more of a threat on the feet is just wrong. Barboza may be the best kicker in the game but his hands are nowhere near Conor's level.
947911924733358081 2018-01-01 19:26:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @Connorm1903 Moron, that was a joke.
947911304253181954 2018-01-01 19:24:00 UTC <ScottyP922> These guys are all the same. They tell you you don't know MMA and then they start rambling about penises.   He looks like he's 12 too. Yes.

The problem is Conor's the only one even close to capable of making it happen.   Nobody gives a shit about Khabib. McGregor would slap box him into unconsciousness in a fight on the feet.

947908617163935744 2018-01-01 19:13:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @arielhelwani @TeamKhabib @JenningsDamian @Connorm1903 McGregor is the greatest MMA striker of all time. Lb for lb. Bathe in it, diehards. It's true.
947908295603433472 2018-01-01 19:12:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @arielhelwani @TeamKhabib @JenningsDamian @Connorm1903 59% of Thompson's fights have ended by something other than a win on strikes. 25% for McGregor. McGregor has finished 7 of 10 fights in the UFC. Thompson 5 of 12.
947866811009290240 2018-01-01 16:27:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @arielhelwani @TeamKhabib Khabib will be shooting for his life. Stand too long and get KO'd stiff.
947852804793569280 2018-01-01 15:31:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Just let him live, King. The man has a family.

947347030720090112 2017-12-30 06:01:47 UTC <ScottyP922> The juiced up freak didn't like it when she got rocked there. #UFC219
947342583365283840 2017-12-30 05:44:07 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't know. Cyborg may be in trouble here. She at least has to work for it for a change. #UFC219
947341761394987008 2017-12-30 05:40:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Holly is actually out muscling Cyborg in the clinch. #UFC219
947335523043102720 2017-12-30 05:16:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I'll call bullshit on that.
947335255257747456 2017-12-30 05:15:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan McGregor would have to KO him quick.

947330170352005120 2017-12-30 04:54:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Fights over. #UFC219
947327258712313856 2017-12-30 04:43:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Barboza better fire early and often. He's got about half a round to do work. #UFC219
947326966109298688 2017-12-30 04:42:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Khabib's plan is to "smash face". #UFC219

947318663799083008 2017-12-30 04:09:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Esparza won that. 29-28. #UFC219
947311946633801730 2017-12-30 03:42:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Taking Esparza in what is apparently considered an upset. I think Calvillo is a little bit overrated. #UFC219
947311400896094208 2017-12-30 03:40:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan @bryangahagan35 He did against Diaz and he learned from it. He finally ran into someone who could take his shots.
947310635192373248 2017-12-30 03:37:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Was it ring rust or did that war with Lawler empty Condit's tank? #UFC219

947285300614746113 2017-12-30 01:56:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh It's amazing how wide the gap is between Conor and everyone else. I'm not trying to criticize anyone. These are the greatest athletes in the world. It's just unbelievable to see the difference in pay.
947284519526240257 2017-12-30 01:53:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @KevinI @FlynnerMMA Yeah true but I don't know how you can justify it. Carla's been around longer and she's a former champ.
947284038292828161 2017-12-30 01:51:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @KevinI How the hell does Esparza get less than Calvillo?
947274336381161473 2017-12-30 01:12:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Smolka's fighting to stay in the UFC. Would be his 4th straight loss. #UFC219

947199795587887104 2017-12-30 20:16:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Gaethje has two fights in the UFC and both are fight of the year candidates.
947198371969818624 2017-12-30 20:11:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Cyborg does have one loss. First fight of her career but your point still remains.
947198070491623424 2017-12-30 20:09:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund Herb stopped it to protect Amanda from all the built in counters Coach had drilled into Ronda. Just in time too.

947166287444180992 2017-12-30 18:03:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Joy_Villa You mean the thing he did that you did too but you think it's okay because you're a woman?   You're not a victim.
947165365351665665 2017-12-30 17:59:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I'm sure this is going to be very interesting once we find people who give a F what the Motown Peon has to say.
947164852321226753 2017-12-30 17:57:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Can Holm do it? #UFC219
947141357382103045 2017-12-30 16:24:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Pretty sure they're talking about a rather peaceful murder here.
947103179786915840 2017-12-30 13:52:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Very surprised to see the fan voting. Never would have guessed Cyborg/Holm was the biggest toss up.
946954202588303361 2017-12-29 04:00:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA @bumping34 McGregor beat 1 top 5 fighter before fighting Aldo.
946907304154337281 2017-12-29 00:54:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I like it. People just want to trash the UFC.
946903936178573313 2017-12-29 00:41:05 UTC <ScottyP922> If I'm Barboza I come out blazing. F cardio. You have to rock him while you can. #UFC219
946903234907725825 2017-12-29 00:38:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Khabib/Barboza is a lot like Khabib fighting McGregor. If it stays on the feet for long he's screwed. On the ground he dominates.  I don't think Barboza can keep it on the feet. #UFC219
946839367103975429 2017-12-29 20:24:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA He'll stop when he gets his title shot. 8-1 in the UFC. Just destroyed a top 5 ranked contender. He's earned it.
946796674080440321 2017-12-29 17:34:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @krassenstein What if I would have told you about your future bout of mental illness?
946796246026604544 2017-12-29 17:33:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @monaMonah5 Conor's never not made weight. Never needed a 2nd attempt to make weight and never had a poor performance after making the weight.
946795344427397121 2017-12-29 17:29:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Corrynmb Get with the program. Women are victims.

946550231541387264 2017-12-28 01:15:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting What number bullshit would it be if he doesn't get it?
946497398280458240 2017-12-28 21:45:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @arielhelwani Makes sense. He wants to beat Barboza and Ferguson. Then have his head taken off by McGregor to make 145 his next fight.
946492922538745859 2017-12-28 21:27:52 UTC <ScottyP922> I really, really, really hope Holm KO's Cyborg stiff.   Shin meets skull. Toes curl.   Fingers crossed. #UFC219
946490787520503811 2017-12-28 21:19:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow When will the trash MMA media forgive Conor for destroying the myth of Jose Aldo?
946487924769648641 2017-12-28 21:08:00 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC219 is solid but as the end of the year card it shows how tough it's been for the UFC in 2017.
946487495230976001 2017-12-28 21:06:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Looks like a pear taking a crap.

943919441108262912 2017-12-21 19:01:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Yeah but last year had I believe 5 PPVs that did a million or more. This year they had none.  Considering this is a business first and foremost there's no way you can classify that as anything other than a down year.
943917742306091008 2017-12-21 18:55:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan PPVs plummeted this year. Especially if you're not including May/Mac which wasn't MMA. No Conor, no Rousey and you lost Jon Jones again. The guy Dana pegged as the next big thing lost his title to TJ. Max's PPV did terrible numbers. They need new stars to headline these PPVs.

942064662484541440 2017-12-16 16:11:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Most are picking Lawler and I get it, Brutal Bob anywhere near his usual self runs through RDA but I question how much he has left. I'm taking RDA by decision just for being more active over 5 rounds. #UFCWinnipeg

940268434105012225 2017-12-11 17:13:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Colby Covington deserves that title shot on merit. People are dismissing him as trying to talk his way there. Not true. Check the record.

939850853044891648 2017-12-10 13:34:39 UTC <ScottyP922> You wonder if Holloway/Ortega goes the way all of Ortega's fights have gone. He's losing it up until the moment he wins it. #UFCFresno
939850583061778432 2017-12-10 13:33:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Could Brian Ortega be the best FW in the world? His greatest strength is the weakest area of Max's game. #UFCFresno
939740756570525696 2017-12-09 06:17:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @shakeel_mma Might be right. Ortega is just so lethal with the subs.
939738874636533760 2017-12-09 06:09:41 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder if Max could deal with Ortega. #UFCFresno

938938593200001024 2017-12-07 01:09:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Magana will go down as one of the worst UFC fighters in the Dana era. #UFC
938937327753285633 2017-12-07 01:04:38 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm sure Rousey will do quite well as a pro wrestler until the first time the storyline calls for her to lose. #UFC #AnotherYearOff #HelloEllen
938760530168295424 2017-12-07 13:22:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm not sure Max understands how rematches work. When you dominate someone in a fight you don't go lobbying for a rematch. It's the guy who got dominated that does.
938759128075374592 2017-12-07 13:16:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet @OrwellNGoode Tis the season.
938757848825200641 2017-12-07 13:11:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson It's about children throwing a temper tantrum over the results of an election.   Remember when Trump was dangerous and anti-American when he might not accept the election results? Good times.
938756938007015425 2017-12-07 13:07:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Jed's a Conor hater. Takes a shot at him in nearly every one of these. Make sure Conor's informed the greatest ever is the guy he dominated on one leg.
938589712180269056 2017-12-06 02:03:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet I was going to condemn her for it but then I realized my silence on her silence. I need to be a better person in 2018.
938589125690740737 2017-12-06 02:01:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I'd argue an MMA King gets Floyd Mayweather off the couch for a 100 million dollar pay day.   As if Max wouldn't do it if he could. Kind of like when he tried to beat Conor.
938435580882509824 2017-12-06 15:50:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Ordonez @BloodyElbow Got to run back the Poirier fight.
938283756389126144 2017-12-05 05:47:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @Carbazel @sherdogdotcom So is the Diamonds store sign supposed to tell us something?
938283049690783744 2017-12-05 05:44:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee I'd buy you a coffee, Momma E!
938154351591350273 2017-12-05 21:13:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial @Amc427Colts Yeah he doesn't like to get hit and nobody hits like Ngannou. Over quick I would think.
938148799012392962 2017-12-05 20:51:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Max at 2. Conor at 4.   Cause, MMA media.https://twitter.com/sherdogdotcom/status/938124570476851203
938148237298622465 2017-12-05 20:49:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @marc_raimondi How many times do you think Burnell has gotten "You Mads, bro?"
938145573500342277 2017-12-05 20:38:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BrianTcity @CubSwanson @FS1 @danawhite Ortega is literally never out of a fight. Seems like he likes losing rounds before finding the sub.
938145122478362624 2017-12-05 20:36:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @arielhelwani @MMAFighting He just wasn't ready for Hamill. I'd probably give a slight edge to Jones in a rematch though.
938144368992702465 2017-12-05 20:33:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial That's not even an intriguing fight.
938143653293379584 2017-12-05 20:30:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey MMA media, Conor's confused. Maybe you can enlighten him. Is the GOAT 145er the guy he dominated on one leg or the guy he slept in 13 seconds? #UFC @MMAFighting @BloodyElbow @MMAjunkie @sherdogdotcom #BlessedThatHeLeftTheDivisionEra

938057179717828610 2017-12-05 14:47:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Ariel only tweeted that to push his anti American liberal agenda.

937996148937289729 2017-12-05 10:44:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Nate is asking for a ridiculous amount to fight anyone. He's not afraid to fight anybody. He's just delusional as to his worth.
937901405561655297 2017-12-04 04:28:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @ColbyCovMMA Must mean fights he thinks he can win.

937788267013050375 2017-12-04 20:58:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan I want Rumble/Ngannou. He says if he comes back it'll be at HW. Imagine the F outta that fight.

937763428088864773 2017-12-04 19:19:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet I'm glad you said that, Paul. I was beginning to question your silence on it.

937439817075445760 2017-12-03 21:54:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @stipemiocicufc @ufc @dc_mma Love Stipe and believe he's the better fighter but Ngannou is so powerful that I think it might not matter. He touches you and its fight altering.
937438536026001409 2017-12-03 21:48:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dre_Kriggs @whatupkj I don't think he's untouchable. I think there isn't a 145er on planet Earth that can beat him, including a guy he completely dominated in the past.
937438043929239554 2017-12-03 21:47:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dre_Kriggs @whatupkj K.   Go away.
937437182440235008 2017-12-03 21:43:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dre_Kriggs @whatupkj But I will say one thing. Your desperation for Conor to slow down is correct. It would take that for Max to be competitive. Any gas in the tank and McGregor embarrasses Holloway like the first time.
937436837605511168 2017-12-03 21:42:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dre_Kriggs @whatupkj Sure. Like I was shocked when UFC caliber would get him. When Aldo got a hold of him. What Eddie would do. Etc.   You bore me, frankly.
937432424258179072 2017-12-03 21:24:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dre_Kriggs @whatupkj Sure he is. We'll just take your word for it. Until they fight again and Max is target practice. Again.
937383672591867905 2017-12-03 18:10:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA Disappointing tweet.  Hey I have an idea. Let's pretend Max Holloway and/or Tony Ferguson wouldn't also box Floyd Mayweather for 100 million dollars. They're "taking on all comers" because that's their only option.
937382185711079424 2017-12-03 18:05:03 UTC <ScottyP922> This guy is an MMA journalist.  The MMA media is the worst.   They just can't stand how good he is and how wrong they were.https://twitter.com/MotoM4TT/status/937381165027164160
937286788208611328 2017-12-03 11:45:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @whatupkj @Dre_Kriggs Again, Max isn't the only one who has improved. He's just that guy who needed to improve by a lot to even make it a competitive fight.
937286426252726272 2017-12-03 11:44:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Attention MMA fans. Max Holloway isn't on Conor McGregor's level as a fighter. You just think (hope) he is. If they fought again absolutely nothing would change from the first fight. This is the Blessed that Conor left the division era. #UFC218
937284405906886661 2017-12-03 11:36:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @AndScooter4All @Dre_Kriggs @MMAHistoryToday @Danielmmafan @mmaballer13 @whatupkj And I'd favor the guy who completely schooled the "masterful striker" even after blowing his knee out in the 2nd round. Levels. Max isn't on Conor's.
937282475386077184 2017-12-03 11:28:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Well I hope someone informs Dana.
937198620037795841 2017-12-02 05:55:37 UTC <ScottyP922> And Jose Aldo still has never won a real belt in the UFC. #UFC218
937198225160851456 2017-12-02 05:54:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting LOL. Max won every round.
937198038736670720 2017-12-02 05:53:19 UTC <ScottyP922> F'n Gaethje. I still can not believe he got schooled tonight. #UFC218
937197609772609536 2017-12-02 05:51:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @AndScooter4All @Dre_Kriggs @MMAHistoryToday @whatupkj @Danielmmafan @mmaballer13 Destroying Max. I love how they pretend only Max has improved since then. He's now closed that wide gap where Conor dominated him on one leg years ago.
937196322838458368 2017-12-02 05:46:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @TeamCJCorrea @minniejersey @Tim_Tam98_ I didn't realize only Max has improved since then. Yeah the fight will be different. Conor will have two knees. It won't be competitive. Max isnt on Conor's level.
937194797005197312 2017-12-02 05:40:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @TeamCJCorrea The first fight wasn't competitive. The next one wouldn't be either.
937194258339123201 2017-12-02 05:38:18 UTC <ScottyP922> I love how @Jon_Anik and @joerogan pretend McGregor never happened and Max is the new GOAT at 145.   This was the consolation bracket. #UFC218
937193555159912449 2017-12-02 05:35:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Ahhhhh.....I can never get tired of watching that.   The MMA media's hero. Collapsed once again.   Let's do Holloway/Aldo 3. #UFC218
937185045294604288 2017-12-02 05:01:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund Another early stoppage.
937184603286261760 2017-12-02 04:59:56 UTC <ScottyP922> My God that man's frightening. I've never seen anything like it. #UFC218
937180530952556544 2017-12-02 04:43:45 UTC <ScottyP922> You watch Eddie tonight and you're amazed at what Conor did. You watch Cejudo tonight and you're in awe of what DJ did.   Special talents. All time greats. Don't hate. Appreciate. #UFC218
937174143614816257 2017-12-02 04:18:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Gaethje will be back with a vengeance. I have no doubt. #UFC218
937173164513165314 2017-12-02 04:14:28 UTC <ScottyP922> I really thought Gaethje would break Eddie. That body work was the difference. #UFC218
937172894890766336 2017-12-02 04:13:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Yep...but they don't want to admit it. Conor made Eddie look like an amateur. At no point was it competitive.
937172416283004928 2017-12-02 04:11:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Eddie shouldn't dip while fighting. It's a nasty habit anyway. #UFC218
937171676365836290 2017-12-02 04:08:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow. F'n wow.   You met your equal, Justin. It was the guy Conor toyed with. #UFC218 #Levels
937170508348616706 2017-12-02 04:03:55 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm surprised nobody's been staggered yet. #UFC218
937169657441800197 2017-12-02 04:00:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Alvarez is schooling Gaethje. #UFC218
937168589483896832 2017-12-02 03:56:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Remember how inept Eddie looked against Conor?   Levels. #UFC218
937165783259668480 2017-12-02 03:45:09 UTC <ScottyP922> They should put caution tape around the Octagon. #UFC218
937147792820142082 2017-12-02 02:33:39 UTC <ScottyP922> I think that was better than Johnson/Gaethje. Fight of the year maybe. #UFC218
937143505675223041 2017-12-02 02:16:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Uneventful first round. Feeling out process. Pace should pick up from here. #UFC218
937142967072165889 2017-12-02 02:14:29 UTC <ScottyP922> The 2 man booth works so much better than 3. #UFC218
937140533134282752 2017-12-02 02:04:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @MikeBohnMMA Crap on her all you want but blood boogers is where she draws the line.
937138729310973952 2017-12-02 01:57:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Fight of the night so far - Cooper/Magana. #UFC218
937136962238074881 2017-12-02 01:50:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @BoxingBusch Thank God a Diaz brother isn't fighting tonight.
937134812137213954 2017-12-02 01:42:04 UTC <ScottyP922> "Listen, any more moving around like that and I'm taking a point. This is your last warning." - Herb Dean, to Dominick Cruz #UFC218
937134438844129281 2017-12-02 01:40:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Herb is not having a good night. #UFC218
937133808423448578 2017-12-02 01:38:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @allelbows @CastIron_Casey @feliceherrig @MMAFighting She's being modest. She has it 1-1 so far.
937133414880292864 2017-12-02 01:36:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @FS1 @danawhite Dana, can you scream at us to buy the PPV?
937132432788283392 2017-12-02 01:32:37 UTC <ScottyP922> I got F your underwears in this one. #UFC218  (You had to watch that season of Tuf)
937131633810997248 2017-12-02 01:29:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColbyCovMMA He tweeted this in between bench press sets of 500 lbs.
937130953318821889 2017-12-02 01:26:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani USADA doesn't test for hallucinogenics?
937124622025273345 2017-12-02 01:01:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Herrig probably figures if her opponent just doesn't shit all over her it's a win tonight. #UFC218
937124394303926273 2017-12-02 01:00:41 UTC <ScottyP922> This next one is a coin flip for me. Taking Herrig because she seems to be improving every fight lately. #UFC218
937123018622623745 2017-12-02 00:55:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting She's got guts getting in there but my lord is she hopelessly overmatched.
937121785908203520 2017-12-02 00:50:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Magana is one of the worst UFC fighters I've ever seen. You might as well have an octagon girl fight her opponents. #UFC218
937120748585537541 2017-12-02 00:46:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Remember when Magana challenged Cyborg to a Jiu-Jitsu match? #UFC218
937118401566314496 2017-12-02 00:36:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @MikeBohnMMA Oh boy. @ColbyCovMMA will have a field day with this.
937114228707807232 2017-12-02 00:20:17 UTC <ScottyP922> If that's how Alvarez/Gaethje ended I would be uber pissed. #UFC218
937113321790230528 2017-12-02 00:16:41 UTC <ScottyP922> Great fight. Hopefully the UFC does the right thing and gives both guys win bonuses. #UFC218
937112706586435584 2017-12-02 00:14:14 UTC <ScottyP922> Too many quick stoppages these days. Let them fight. #UFC218
937110527628767232 2017-12-02 00:05:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Never before has a fighter overreacted more to a fight pass opening victory.
937101432813219840 2017-12-02 23:29:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Classy guy that Willis. #UFC218
937082409773883392 2017-12-02 22:13:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @will_borowski UFC Tonight
937081107253809153 2017-12-02 22:08:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Gaethje says he has about 6-8 more fights left.  Understandable but disappointing. Cherish this violent bastard while you can. #UFC218
937078714310983680 2017-12-02 21:59:10 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't know what you had in mind....but here we stand on opposing sides.  Let's go to war.  LET'S GO TO WAR!!!  #UFC218
937061428003000321 2017-12-02 20:50:28 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC218 fight picks....  Max, Ngannou, Cejudo, Gaethje, Torres, C. Oliveira, A. Oliveira, Teymur, Herrig, Cooper, Alhassan, Reyes, Willis.   Best bet - Cejudo
937056863761428480 2017-12-02 20:32:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Depends on who wins the fight tonight. If it's Aldo, Frankie might want to consider that move to 135.
937056356342947840 2017-12-02 20:30:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @francis_ngannou Jesus Christ. They couldn't pay me enough.
937022579310768130 2017-12-02 18:16:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I'm sure Nicco likes to be called a little girl.
937017950019768320 2017-12-02 17:57:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Sad to see you leave the UFC, coach.
936998792569778179 2017-12-02 16:41:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Justin_Gaethje @Ealvarezfight @MMAFighting The people's main event. We may all need counseling after.
936997036108509184 2017-12-02 16:34:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @Jumpman23 Jordan was good but let's be honest. Conor KOs him clean in one round.
936993247079124992 2017-12-02 16:19:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow In the past week, Jose Aldo defended Conor McGregor and Cowboy Cerrone says he wants to fight less.   I don't think I want to live in this world.
936992469958516742 2017-12-02 16:16:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Congrats to @NiccoMontano our new Flyweight Champion of the world. Inspiring young lady. Her self belief trumped their rankings.
936991170282041344 2017-12-02 16:11:18 UTC <ScottyP922> I've already dialed 9 and 1....and now I'm just waiting for Alvarez/Gaethje at #UFC218 tonight.   Oh. My. God.   I feel like I should run to the store and stock up on bottled water and essentials.
936812610153889792 2017-12-01 04:21:46 UTC <ScottyP922> I hope Barb smokes her. #TUF26Finale
936803345943035905 2017-12-01 03:44:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I believe she was nursing a knee injury.
936798772708782080 2017-12-01 03:26:46 UTC <ScottyP922> I think I'd rather listen to a Roseanne Barr sex tape than DC calling fights. #TUF26Finale
936763443281039361 2017-12-01 01:06:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheView @LiberalLogic123 Lol...what a bunch of complete morons.
936762612733407235 2017-12-01 01:03:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @Harfagri Unless you watch the vivisection.
936760877977686016 2017-12-01 00:56:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Not bad but she needs to darken her hair. It's way off. Put on a hoodie too.
936758881727991814 2017-12-01 00:48:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow Thee Zane Simon? Yeah, right. No way.
936757900894265344 2017-12-01 00:44:22 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor would destroy Robertson. #TUF26Finale #KingMac
936734218943639552 2017-12-01 23:10:16 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't understand why fighters strip down for ceremonial weigh ins. #UFC218
936730645371523077 2017-12-01 22:56:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Tomorrow Jose Aldo attempts to win a UFC belt in the Octagon for the very first time to become a 3 time UFC champion.   It's complicated. #UFC218

936663614827745280 2017-12-01 18:29:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Yes, please.
936663533437235200 2017-12-01 18:29:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani It'd be one of the great stories of MMA if she wins that title tonight.
936659449254760453 2017-12-01 18:13:09 UTC <ScottyP922> A must read before the cards, MMA fans. #UFC218https://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/936431534441054208
936643827732963328 2017-12-01 17:11:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher Was their advice to have the running game carry you while you throw for 100 yards?
936598026256252928 2017-12-01 14:09:05 UTC <ScottyP922> I fear for the safety of the Irish Mafia. #UFC #KingMac #HeadlessHoodlums
936596947259011077 2017-12-01 14:04:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Max is top 145er unless Conor gets a stomach virus.
936574196045549570 2017-12-01 12:34:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Nicco wins the fight but Roxanne becoming a UFC champion would be one of the great stories in MMA. #TUFFinale #UFC
936573398104379392 2017-12-01 12:31:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti Don't disrespect my hero Aldo! It's almost like they fought before and Jose got slept or something.
936570620384546816 2017-12-01 12:20:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach, you had Max in the first fight. Why Aldo here?
936395848908406786 2017-11-30 00:45:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiberalLogic123 WTF
936381206534479874 2017-11-30 23:47:31 UTC <ScottyP922> That moment when all MMA fans come together Saturday and think to themselves "How the hell is Angela Magana still in the UFC?" #UFC218
936348847315607552 2017-11-30 21:38:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Gaethje is so f'n twisted and I love it.
936348561217937409 2017-11-30 21:37:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie For her own health I hope she goes up to 135.
936326379565731841 2017-11-30 20:09:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBurtonXP It's so inspiring.
936316362347163648 2017-11-30 19:29:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie No more 125 for her.
936306233086181376 2017-11-30 18:49:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Why can't I shake the feeling Holly Holm might slay another giant? #UFC219
936262067891425281 2017-11-30 15:54:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Alvarez/Gaethje. That has nuts written all over it.
936106443035611137 2017-11-29 05:35:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @NiccoMontano is the new UFC Flyweight Champion. #TUF26
936027113353818112 2017-11-29 00:20:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Werdum and I, Dana. Werdum and I.
936025828911181824 2017-11-29 00:15:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys What an idiotic thing to say. Is it also easy to blame the GM the last 20 years? You're a cheerleader.
935933327109914625 2017-11-29 18:07:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Yeah but it's like impossible to keep them lit.
935932952583786497 2017-11-29 18:06:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial I got Dana by 1st round TKO.
935520642375520256 2017-11-28 14:47:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I expect Aldo to try to kick the shit out of Max's leg. He was supposedly injured in the first fight and couldn't kick. #UFC218
935504611854704641 2017-11-28 13:44:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @NickBaldwinMMA @BloodyElbow LOL. Why would it be tough? Because TJ knows he was saved by the bell in the first round?

916812269496995841 2017-10-07 23:47:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Coin flip. Don't trust either fighter.
916803334325010434 2017-10-07 23:12:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiessiePiessie @Danielmmafan Feel bad for Godbeer. He deserves a show and win pay out for this.
916803114199601152 2017-10-07 23:11:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Yes. Announced by Anik already.
916802281332461569 2017-10-07 23:07:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow All Tavares fights are boring.
916802120120233984 2017-10-07 23:07:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Werdum on 4 hours notice? Walt Harris just gives no fucks. #UFC216
916801863516938240 2017-10-07 23:06:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Godbeer: So I guess just F me then?
916801428542377985 2017-10-07 23:04:28 UTC <ScottyP922> I wish the UFC would give up on these 3 man booths. #UFC216
916797301376667654 2017-10-07 22:48:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @UnRayao Yep. I hate ppv cards with 1 fight I really want to see. Really not worth it but hard to miss.
916791858721849344 2017-10-07 22:26:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Listen, I'm Team McGregor 4 life but damn is it hard not to like Gaethje.   I deserve a left hand for this. #UFC
916790157952634880 2017-10-07 22:19:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA More than he bargains for on the floor? Dan, I'm shocked by that.
916788310265225216 2017-10-07 22:12:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Please, karma. Let Borg pull the upset tonight. Nobody should get that record by ducking. #UFC216
916786807915806721 2017-10-07 22:06:22 UTC <ScottyP922> The stakes are high.  The winner may or may not get a chance to get knocked stiff by McGregor  You can cut the tension with a knife #UFC216
916786109115486208 2017-10-07 22:03:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor McGregor is King.   Take a moment to reflect before #UFC216
916780099051147265 2017-10-07 21:39:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Because your fighter doesn't matter. You don't go from cashing on Mayweather to worrying about the Motown Peon Kevin Lee.
916779248362377216 2017-10-07 21:36:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The guys at MMA Fighting advocate less fights/cards but more divisions. They have all the answers.
916778985102692354 2017-10-07 21:35:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Before we make more belts let's make sure Conor has the room to store them.
916625947205521408 2017-10-07 11:27:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial And Tony Ferguson will take care of the rest of his chance tonight.
916625743928614914 2017-10-07 11:26:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Joe Rogan's excited to see Tom "Do-kez-noy" tonight. #UFC216

916243533018882048 2017-10-06 10:07:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Sucks that it's going to be 3 rounds. Probably ends before that but there's a possibility of an epic 5 round war here.
916149922788978688 2017-10-05 03:55:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @DirkDiggler1010 Same here. I was really disappointed. Especially when he tried to use the excuse of weight cuts and division rankings.

916095654082105345 2017-10-05 00:19:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom So it's 3 rounds. What a letdown.
916095086672441344 2017-10-05 00:17:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @WilliamByron @NASCAR Should be exclusive to Gordon.

916093485945638918 2017-10-05 00:11:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @ozzyzak @The_Brutman Excuses. He doesn't want to take the risk with the record on the line. It's as simple as that. He ducked TJ.
916089193423568896 2017-10-05 23:54:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @cindyelliott9 Sweet Jesus, that's beautiful.
916088606976020480 2017-10-05 23:51:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @ozzyzak @The_Brutman Borg has much more of a history of weight trouble than TJ. DJ didn't want to risk the record. I lost all respect for him.
916004797370785794 2017-10-05 18:18:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA This man's taking over the big screen.

915736172168716288 2017-10-04 00:31:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Sure I do. Book him against TJ Dillashaw. #asterisk #DuckedTJ
915700706857930753 2017-10-04 22:10:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @LabattUSA @jawsespn I think the Eagles suck.
915562833580056577 2017-10-04 13:02:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @NicolaHanson9 I can understand that. Even I hated the boxing.
915520049171005440 2017-10-04 10:12:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @NicolaHanson9 McGregor moved on from the division you mean. After making it his bitch.
915518383797555202 2017-10-04 10:06:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial What was that about needing to man up?

915376474777153536 2017-10-03 00:42:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @PaulMalignaggi You're half a fighter. So is Floyd. Conor destroys you both on the same day in a real fight. Quit embarrassing yourself.
915374808879259648 2017-10-03 00:35:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @darakass @choo_ek Sounds like quite the sexist event.   When's the for men by men one?
915374055863267329 2017-10-03 00:32:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanPayton Time for what? You to be educated to the facts and not liberal cancer spewed by the media?

914608626240753664 2017-10-01 21:51:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @KyleBusch @NASCAR @Malacutie_3 Busch should be scraping himself off the wall as we speak. F him.

912260043625639936 2017-09-25 10:18:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow So media only became too hard when she started getting knocked out? Here I thought she was just too weak to face it like a true champion.
912259585267961857 2017-09-25 10:16:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Yeah but he pronounced it "swagga".
912258676236455937 2017-09-25 10:13:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Well he got me. I would have never finished the sentence that way.
912040414860992513 2017-09-24 19:45:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Any American who disrespects our anthem and/or flag is a piece of shit who should be throat kicked across our border. #TakeTheKnee #NFL
912022214026960896 2017-09-24 18:33:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Quit blowing our minds, Jillian.
911972739937955840 2017-09-24 15:16:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @EdgeofSports "For all the hate and negativity that has come from Trump's presidency"  And 100% of it has come from you liberals.
911944984579969024 2017-09-24 13:26:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @RedPill_Patriot I was on the wrong side of it. I had Larkin. Thought he'd beat Lima too. Really surprised he's 0-2 there.
911943290739740672 2017-09-24 13:19:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet Yes. There's nothing worse than an American President respecting America. We must act.
911941244053532677 2017-09-24 13:11:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet In the end, expect any decent American not to give a shit. What an embarrassment.
911939151322329090 2017-09-24 13:03:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Today a bunch of spoiled rotten black men protest living in the greatest country in the world. #nfltakeaknee #FThemAll
911829589034401793 2017-09-23 05:48:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter So when will the corrupt left media get tired of this?   Hey, Adam...could you show us more? It's starting to change our opinions.
911827985346555905 2017-09-23 05:41:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange At that price, give me the Louis II or III.
911826438155833344 2017-09-23 05:35:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @RedPill_Patriot Sorry, man. I missed this. Which fight?
911822598971039744 2017-09-23 05:20:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @RedPillTweets The cancer is spreading.

911704916783173633 2017-09-23 21:32:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MoveTheSticks @NFL_CFB Let's see that NFL executive's track record in the draft. Means nothing.
911586771900751872 2017-09-23 13:43:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet Liberalism is a cancer.
911450854212997120 2017-09-22 04:43:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @danhardymma @arielhelwani Hardy is greatness. Expand his role.
911450729130463233 2017-09-22 04:42:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani How about we just call him Ovince Von Flue?
911449896112279553 2017-09-22 04:39:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Are we sure Okami didn't just fall asleep out of boredom? #UFCJapan
911449149467500544 2017-09-22 04:36:25 UTC <ScottyP922> I bet Nova Uniao feel vindicated tonight. #UFCJapan
911447001178476544 2017-09-22 04:27:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Joanna and Claudia go to war twice. Joanna dominates Andrade. Andrade dominates Claudia. Styles make fights. #UFCJapan
911446538714533888 2017-09-22 04:26:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Brandon_Nocaute Agreed. Once Shogun pulled they should have flipped them.
911446047523819521 2017-09-22 04:24:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow really surprised by that. A new pecking order in the SW division. #UFCJapan
911440405790633984 2017-09-22 04:01:41 UTC <ScottyP922> The fact that this next fight isn't the main event of this card shows the women still aren't treated equally in the UFC. #UFCJapan
911438163951931394 2017-09-22 03:52:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @_STD_ @ChrisConte27 Sadly, you are probably right.
911438056703619072 2017-09-22 03:52:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Check the numbers. DJ doesn't draw. Not odd at all.
911437097139150848 2017-09-22 03:48:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting He has an odd way of showing appreciation to his heroes.
911436021497294848 2017-09-22 03:44:15 UTC <ScottyP922> F any promoter who books Gomi in a fight going forward.  Protect him from himself.  #UFCJapan
911435382977433600 2017-09-22 03:41:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA Right there with you. Please stop fighting.
911433477303697408 2017-09-22 03:34:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Dana, call me a goof or I'm canceling fight pass.
911433015162806273 2017-09-22 03:32:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @gokhantherebel @danawhite Got to get his cardio in order. Look out if he does.
911431673279123458 2017-09-22 03:26:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Is this not the greatest sport or what? #UFCJapan
911430332410417153 2017-09-22 03:21:39 UTC <ScottyP922> That fight reminded me of McGregor/Diaz. Except Silva's not quite a Nate like zombie. #UFCJapan
911429625166917632 2017-09-22 03:18:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Fight. Of. The. Night. #UFCJapan
911427770747678720 2017-09-22 03:11:28 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't wait to see Bisping vs the guy who lost to Hendricks in his last fight. #UFCJapan #UFC217
911412172579856384 2017-09-22 02:09:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Gadelha's going to remind fools once again that the SW division consists of Joanna and her...then everybody else. #UFCJapan #WideGap
911404549667278848 2017-09-22 01:39:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA What do you think of the long term potential of Jeon?
911404205172232192 2017-09-22 01:37:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA You don't think KK is a little too much for her right now?
911381452151050240 2017-09-22 00:07:25 UTC <ScottyP922> Dan Hardy does an excellent job calling these fights. I hope his role is increased with Stann leaving. #UFCJapan
911308591952474112 2017-09-22 19:17:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange "Vote for me or your entire family is dead" turned out to be a campaign slogan that really connected with the people.
911307308159979521 2017-09-22 19:12:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Pretty girl!
911186421616185345 2017-09-22 11:12:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Can we get new MMA media by any chance?
910874123173318656 2017-09-21 14:31:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Perry could be one of the rising stars of the UFC.
910809268659658752 2017-09-21 10:13:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter Liberalism is cancer.
910720341877682176 2017-09-20 04:20:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Ordonez @BloodyElbow Some people. Most already do.
910624853933379585 2017-09-20 22:00:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 Offensive tackle?
910304242925228034 2017-09-19 00:46:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Makes for a good prelim fight.
910301667551322112 2017-09-19 00:36:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamHendrick @LFR95 @kaseykahne @bbussert04 They have a tech alliance with Richard Childress Racing.
909992735028981760 2017-09-18 04:09:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @bisping @ufc Yes.
909918563007451138 2017-09-18 23:14:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow I always wanted to see him fight Jon Jones. Guess that won't be happening.
909916978223120384 2017-09-18 23:08:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @marc_raimondi Hasn't he done enough to her?
909916630481850368 2017-09-18 23:06:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ProFootballTalk Good article on the Redskins, Mike.
909795265716072449 2017-09-18 15:04:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Outstanding lineup this week.
909792280353091584 2017-09-18 14:52:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange You know what's really risky? Being caught in an earthquake with a toddler holding a gun.
909791981538353152 2017-09-18 14:51:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @MMAFACTSONFACTS I don't either but you can't tell me Rockhold's not bitter about the KO loss. The real champ right now is the guy who smoked him.
909723263512793088 2017-09-18 10:18:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie He's got that bitter Aldo thing for getting KO'd clean.
909594636859125760 2017-09-17 01:47:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange I doubt they're gonna get that back.
909559023317504005 2017-09-17 23:25:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Build the ceiling!
909549198722437120 2017-09-17 22:46:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange At least he was thoughtful.
909548105326096384 2017-09-17 22:42:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange I'm assuming 11 year olds throw off the deliciousness of the dish.
909488041517092866 2017-09-17 18:43:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @MarioLopezExtra @ALIAQUINTA @bisping @stipemiocicufc @joannamma @ChuckLiddell @dc_mma @EdmondTarverdy @Rampage4real @arielhelwani Oh man. Coach Edmond. This is like an MMA seminar.
909476148677087233 2017-09-17 17:56:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher Enjoy the game, Chris.
909279167803478016 2017-09-16 04:53:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Half a fight, King.
909277166239612929 2017-09-16 04:45:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Well that was a much tougher fight for Rockhold than I thought. #UFCPittsburgh
909272044239548417 2017-09-16 04:25:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm calling a question mark kick as the beginning of the end for Branch.
909271826748121088 2017-09-16 04:24:31 UTC <ScottyP922> He's arrogant as all hell but Rockhold is the best 185er on planet Earth. I expect him to style here. #UFCPittsburgh
909270518930575360 2017-09-16 04:19:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Lawler/Perry?   Would. Watch. #UFCPittsburgh
909270245088677889 2017-09-16 04:18:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @will_borowski Yeah it was just a question of how.
909268355248529408 2017-09-16 04:10:43 UTC <ScottyP922> If this kid gets out of the 1st round it's a victory for him. #UFCPittsburgh
909267051935682560 2017-09-16 04:05:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA The scary part is he thought he was winning.
909265726439088128 2017-09-16 04:00:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow "I'm usually more respectful when I'm winning." What the hell.
909264695802068992 2017-09-16 03:56:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I love it when a fight goes the way  I expect it. Makes up for the 10 other times it doesn't.
909259919387480065 2017-09-16 03:37:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Which are usually the fights that don't.
909258637255876609 2017-09-16 03:32:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA I feel like if he can't finish it in the 1st round it probably won't be a good result for him.
909258240919252994 2017-09-16 03:30:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Smith weathers the early storm and gets a late finish.
909255714203426817 2017-09-16 03:20:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Great f'n fight. #UFCPittsburgh
909252176731607040 2017-09-16 03:06:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MoTownPhenom Sweet......who are you again?
909250869371301888 2017-09-16 03:01:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Unless, like, you win one.
909250491598753792 2017-09-16 02:59:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @davedoylemma Knocked it out of the park. Scary dude.
909250012177223681 2017-09-16 02:57:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm going to let you knock me senseless.
909249057524154368 2017-09-16 02:54:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He looks scary good.
909248156130582529 2017-09-16 02:50:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom @MikeSloan19 Because nobody cares.
909246294841061377 2017-09-16 02:43:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Just make Gadelha/Andrade the main event next week. Much better and more relevant fight. #UFCPittsburgh #UFCJapan
909223725765218304 2017-09-16 01:13:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanTomMMA Rough night.
909223154085711872 2017-09-16 01:11:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow You'd have better luck keeping your dog quiet during the Vivi.
909222231485624320 2017-09-16 01:07:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Ahem. Anthony F'n Hamilton. He zigs when he should zag.
909218901598330880 2017-09-16 00:54:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @ColinCowherd @joelklatt @SFY Oh c'mon.
909218105204908032 2017-09-16 00:51:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Makes you wonder what would have happened if Jotko didn't take it to the ground in the 1st round.
909217764791001088 2017-09-16 00:49:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Great win for Hall.
909216484366397440 2017-09-16 00:44:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Jotko looks totally gassed after that.
909213040192745472 2017-09-16 00:30:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Surprised by the result of this poll.
909201202096852993 2017-09-16 23:43:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @ItsPhoenixJones Always take the real fight over half a fight.
909200881140355073 2017-09-16 23:42:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @MrBarryLewis Be safe, Barry. Hope that isn't a long drive.
909200427253673984 2017-09-16 23:40:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Serves him right for trying to shave off that glorious mustache.
908833447505989634 2017-09-15 23:22:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow "but I honestly feel like he doesnt actually enjoy fighting. Martial arts? Yes. Actual fighting? Nope."  Hall is such a waste of talent.
908785190633435137 2017-09-15 20:10:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Bloody Aldo, it will do a fraction of the May/Mac PPV. Nobody cares. Half a fight. Zzzzzzzz.

908629448546816000 2017-09-15 09:51:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Is catching cheaters too high of a price?

908338423517282305 2017-09-14 14:35:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Jones/Cormier 1 -Jones loses his belt.   Jones/Cormier 2 - DC retains his title.   I'd say that settles that. #UFC

907789570464522241 2017-09-12 02:14:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @StevenVanOver @GiantsTalkLine They lost that game.
907783661357076480 2017-09-12 01:51:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @Kirby_MMA @fritz_gruber I'd be happy for him.
907779562733543426 2017-09-12 01:34:48 UTC <ScottyP922> So MMA fans, we must face the reality that the Jon GOAT Jones we all thought we knew might have been chemically created the whole time. #UFC
907778722341801984 2017-09-12 01:31:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @DannySeguraTV @MMAFighting Congrats @felderpaul
907778148888178688 2017-09-12 01:29:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @marc_raimondi Jones: I'm not a cheater. They never tested my C sample.
907777882247835654 2017-09-12 01:28:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @Phillies The man's not human.
907758862996049920 2017-09-12 00:12:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey @danawhite NYC is nice but when are you going to let Joanna headline her own PPV? It's long overdue.
907756984304316418 2017-09-12 00:05:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @AntWalkerMMA @TJDeSantis @sherdogdotcom Certainly he is but if Woodley lands flush on him once it's over.
907706456874606598 2017-09-12 20:44:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Hey, it could happen.
907637036001239042 2017-09-12 16:08:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Rose is going to be shooting for her life in there. But she will get cracked with every limb. #UFC217 #AndStill #QueenJoanna
907589169622519809 2017-09-12 12:58:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Joanna will murk Rose. Class is in session.
907588115925217285 2017-09-12 12:54:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Ealvarezfight Great man, Eddie Alvarez. Much respect to you.
907377651928748032 2017-09-11 22:57:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma The Queen is safe. Long live the Queen.
907371241782300677 2017-09-11 22:32:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cobratate That might have been Andrew's greatest KO. Well done, sir.

907096984758181889 2017-09-10 04:22:28 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey @HeathEvans44 . That was actually domination. Not the combined 4 point margin of victory in the Giants two wins last year.
906894536567390209 2017-09-10 14:58:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @jack_lewis96 The MMA media protects Brazilians. Her conduct after that fight was disgraceful.

906747749831507970 2017-09-09 05:14:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani That doesn't even make sense. They booed because they disagreed with the decision. As did I.
906720221850939393 2017-09-09 03:25:21 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm embarrassed by the conduct of my team after the win. Total disrespect to Ohio St. #OUvsOSU

906352592745267200 2017-09-08 03:04:31 UTC <ScottyP922> See to @Ian_OConnor, if she said it happened, it happened. Regardless of what the police or NFL investigator has to say about it.  #HerTruth
906352034764541952 2017-09-08 03:02:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Cucked liberal @Ian_OConnor....  The process needs fixing, but Zeke Elliott's suspension should stand http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20603303 #HerTruth
906308142962823168 2017-09-08 00:07:54 UTC <ScottyP922> So men still have rights.   You mad, bro? @nflcommish
906288605546635264 2017-09-08 22:50:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @NFLPA Why don't you just say it? We need a new commissioner. He's got to go.
906285004384296960 2017-09-08 22:35:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Zeke freed. For now at least. #FreeZeke #EzekielElliott #MyRunningBack
906259444362866688 2017-09-08 20:54:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChaseShermanUFC Easily McGregor.
906098037042315264 2017-09-08 10:13:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie And we were beyond disappointed you wouldn't fight TJ.
906012932999221248 2017-09-07 04:34:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Hey DJ, maybe Dillashaw can step in?
906011610539466752 2017-09-07 04:29:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @MoveTheSticks Why do we have to worry about hating on the Patriots? Are they special or something?
906011364631617540 2017-09-07 04:28:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiberalLogic123 LOL...the cornerstone of America.
905996818806444033 2017-09-07 03:30:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @Unclecreepymma @TJDeSantis Yes. He also wouldn't have ducked Dillashaw.
905855727813750787 2017-09-07 18:10:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @BulletValentina @ufc She stole that from Roy Nelson.

905823912176562177 2017-09-07 16:03:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @darrentill2 You have a way with words, my friend.
905823605841428480 2017-09-07 16:02:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Sad but true.
905823491806679040 2017-09-07 16:02:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie The man has his priorities in order.
905642224183947264 2017-09-06 04:01:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Ordonez @BloodyElbow We can't cheat anymore. This is racist.
905634519704850433 2017-09-06 03:31:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Let me explain. He's Brazilian.
905634080376717312 2017-09-06 03:29:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Huge money maker? Ariel has a tendency to overrate both of their ability to draw.

905566891338588160 2017-09-06 23:02:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting And I felt cheated when he ran from the Dillashaw fight.
905543068455198721 2017-09-06 21:27:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Mark it down. McGregor would KO Woodley stiff. #ChampChampChamp #UFC
905523461317111810 2017-09-06 20:09:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Rose. End of year card.

905413052186624002 2017-09-06 12:51:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Dillashaw ended Holdsworth's career with a cheap shot.
905392503058292736 2017-09-06 11:29:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @TombstoneStint @sherdogdotcom Yeah, it's Dana holding them back.
905389813808947201 2017-09-06 11:18:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarolinaMMA @LouiseGreenMMA Odd matchup for Karolina.
905371130990559233 2017-09-06 10:04:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFLprguy Could you explain why #HerTruth means more to the cucked @nflcommish than the evidence?
905282181437771783 2017-09-05 04:11:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I've always been a fan of Demetrious "Mighty" Johnson.
905229655640330242 2017-09-05 00:42:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter In other words, F off @nflcommish
905226259600465920 2017-09-05 00:28:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @mortreport So the message here is even if the police and their own investigator don't believe it, women have a friend in @nflcommish.   F you, Rog.
905225690555011073 2017-09-05 00:26:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Cucked liberal @nflcommish buddy Harry upholds the #HerTruth suspension of Zeke.  Pathetic. Disgraceful.  #EzekielElliott #NFL

904806319693209601 2017-09-04 20:40:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow So let's stop talking about it and book the fight.
904761070669230080 2017-09-04 17:40:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Please UFC, Aldo/Ngannou at a catch-weight.

903942250442481665 2017-09-02 11:26:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @LaFoxy10 They crowned a SW champ on tuf that got murked by Joanna. I think the same happens here.
903836644008230921 2017-09-01 04:27:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I don't think a fighter has ever been so thoroughly defeated as Aldo with McGregor. From the tours to the fight to the aftermath.
903789988122415105 2017-09-01 01:21:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @newyscruggs @AlbertBreer Not really, liberal.
903786877232218112 2017-09-01 01:09:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @WynnWynnd4 They should call it Bloody Aldo.

903067361644826624 2017-08-30 01:30:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi @MMAFighting Sick fight. Gaethje will get clipped early and often but he's so damn tough he could be another zombie taking Conor into deep waters late.
903045664292171776 2017-08-30 00:03:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow McGregor subs Maia via Peruvian Neck Tie. It wouldn't be competitive.
903045041236697092 2017-08-30 00:01:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting What Hosay really wants is a time machine to go back to the WEC/early UFC years where he just faced overmatched wrestlers.

902650730565304322 2017-08-29 21:54:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Hey, it makes sense. You have a guy with "solid" power to Mayweather, in 4 oz gloves against amateurs in the UFC. That's pretty scary.
902646701139398659 2017-08-29 21:38:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani If he didn't go, Ariel would have said something about that too.
902645750458437632 2017-08-29 21:34:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @yung_mito So is Conor. The rematch wouldn't be any more competitive.
902616048033288192 2017-08-29 19:36:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeganOlivi @ufc Happy 21st birthday, Megan!
902614718883532800 2017-08-29 19:31:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate has to hope Conor runs out of energy. He can't compete with him until then. #UFC
902614595260571652 2017-08-29 19:31:03 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor/Diaz 3 is simple to break down. When Conor has energy he will dominate the exchanges. If he gasses, Nate has a chance. #UFC
902594458549673984 2017-08-29 18:11:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @Bigdogmmadaily Yeah the schedule is a little weak. This next card is just awful.
902593635044208642 2017-08-29 18:07:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Bocababa @MMAmy120 She's a Diaz puke. Not worth the time.
902591551456649216 2017-08-29 17:59:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @SecretMovesMMA Actually I take that back. Not possible with the way the judges were scoring it. Floyd was up after 3 rounds.
902587083344273409 2017-08-29 17:41:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @SecretMovesMMA I think it's possible.
902586805240901634 2017-08-29 17:40:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @JESnowden @Thegift510 LOL. He couldn't beat any LW on the UFC roster on his best day. He's half a fighter.
902585365172813825 2017-08-29 17:34:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @RedPillTweets It's a recurring theme for him. He lost the Diaz fight on cardio.
902584718264340480 2017-08-29 17:32:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @JESnowden @Thegift510 And here's another perspective. If Floyd and Conor fight in the street at any age, Floyd is dead.
902519377135849472 2017-08-29 13:12:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarolinaMMA Look at those guns.

902227103910944768 2017-08-28 17:51:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @RealJamesWoods He interfered in the transfer of power from a black man to a woman. They'll never forgive him for it.

901888393075986432 2017-08-27 19:25:23 UTC <ScottyP922> The fact that 2 judges had Floyd up after 3 rounds is proof of the corruption in boxing. He did nothing. #McGregorMayweather

901674502639243264 2017-08-26 05:15:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @Bigdogmmadaily He wouldn't get to the 4th minute.
901673441102888960 2017-08-26 05:11:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated It shows his class. Jose Aldo Jr. is a scumbag.
901671343002976257 2017-08-26 05:02:55 UTC <ScottyP922> It just pisses me off that that punk gets to fight in his limited rule set and avoid the ass kicking he deserves. #McGregorMayweather

901313010639228928 2017-08-25 05:19:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Think about this. You will never again see Jon Jones fight in his prime. That much seems like a virtual certainty.   Sad. #UFC

901242086565064706 2017-08-25 00:37:12 UTC <ScottyP922> I would give nearly anything to see McGregor remove another head and see the media choke on their smugness. #McGregor #McGregorMayweather

897646167869329408 2017-08-15 02:28:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @ShahChowdhury21 Equating Donald Trump to a nazi makes you a liberal. It also makes you completely delusional.

897306157341192192 2017-08-14 03:57:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan @pacificflows Haven't told me why it matters though. This is a question of whether we are biologically different. Why would a woman have more to add?
897303802981830656 2017-08-14 03:47:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan @pacificflows Then why would Joe purposely seek out two women? We need to flush this mindset.
897302370606075904 2017-08-14 03:42:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan @pacificflows Interesting. So women get to decide whether we're different.

896763027336376320 2017-08-13 15:59:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @STI_Bret The Packers we're not better. The Cowboys weren't ready to play because the head coach chose safety over preparation.
896762710309949444 2017-08-13 15:57:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @STI_Bret So you keep supporting being smart and safe. I'd prefer having a man as head coach.
896762475642851328 2017-08-13 15:56:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @STI_Bret Then they showed up unprepared to play the Packers and couldn't overcome the hole they dug.

896570886530244610 2017-08-12 03:15:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher There is 0 chance Todd knows this for a fact. He's guessing. It's the safe bet.
896522303726469121 2017-08-12 00:02:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I'm glad he said it.
896514046597484544 2017-08-12 23:29:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @CatZingano I love this woman and can't wait for her return. She made the BW champ quit and the FW champ say no.
896508317530546176 2017-08-12 23:06:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher Safe spaces for everyone!
896506093295329280 2017-08-12 22:58:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan @UFCInsiders He'd make Rogan really work for that interview.
896505020392153088 2017-08-12 22:53:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher We need a man coaching this team.
896497836371652608 2017-08-12 22:25:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @NakedGambling @BloodyElbow He won. So yes.
896496446874275840 2017-08-12 22:19:43 UTC <ScottyP922> You always list the A-side first. #McGregorMayweather
896495815832748032 2017-08-12 22:17:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MMAFighting Why don't we just name the entire fight game McGregor? Everyone competes in McGregor.
896462948914401281 2017-08-12 20:06:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove @ufc This is like Cody "All Love" Garbrandt.
896441140009984002 2017-08-12 18:39:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @RedPillTweets They will cry it was fixed.
896409160153214978 2017-08-12 16:32:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Yes, Paulie is not Floyd but it proves that these boxing snobs dismissing McGregor as a novice are just wrong. #McGregorMayweather
896408758527692802 2017-08-12 16:31:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund And GGG appreciates it too.
896407982975614976 2017-08-12 16:28:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet Never draft a kicker that high.
896407326676176897 2017-08-12 16:25:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @LukeCze I see it as a respectful way to address him.
896349532547682309 2017-08-12 12:35:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARoasted No, no. It was a push. @BloodyElbow said so.
896348892492595200 2017-08-12 12:33:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Bloody Elbow concludes it was a push....  The MMA media is the absolute worst.   Give my best to Hosay. If he's awake.https://twitter.com/BloodyElbow/status/896242928758206464
896237840119599105 2017-08-11 05:12:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFLCharean @ESPN_SA @JasonMinnix Let's hope so. We need a man at the position.
896237513064550400 2017-08-11 05:10:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFLCharean @ESPN_SA @JasonMinnix I guess Ramon knows more than the police department that investigated this case.   Or he's another cucked liberal who swears by #HerTruth
896236253418487808 2017-08-11 05:05:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom @TombstoneStint Lol. He's already on the way down, genius.
896234486429605888 2017-08-11 04:58:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanSheehanBA I'm not even mad at him. That had to be rough on him considering who he is and who he thought Conor was.
896232649538273280 2017-08-11 04:51:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Technically, his fists pushed his head. #McGregorMayweather #pauliemalignaggi #KingFnMac
896231921319071749 2017-08-11 04:48:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite 2 time boxing champ pieced up by an MMA fighter.   Welcome to McGregor, Paulie. Keep your hands inside at all times and enjoy the ride.
896230664990863360 2017-08-11 04:43:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite Well this is just embarrassing for Paulie.
896196185265930241 2017-08-11 02:26:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The second coming?
896193500194246656 2017-08-11 02:15:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani And he's humble too.
896171180465553412 2017-08-11 00:47:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I probably would have kept that to myself.
896170600791715840 2017-08-11 00:44:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter And that reason is @nflcommish is a cucked liberal pandering to women.
896158853925974016 2017-08-11 23:58:15 UTC <ScottyP922> Sherdog retweeted this.   They're still stung that he took out their hero Aldo. Making them look like flaming jackasses.   F the MMA media.https://twitter.com/Dan_Attias/status/896155533249347584
896152132017037313 2017-08-11 23:31:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani 6 ounces and Floyd doesn't come out of the dressing room.
896151660057083904 2017-08-11 23:29:40 UTC <ScottyP922> It's like I'm watching Jesus preach. #McGregorMayweather #OpenWorkouts #KingFnMac
896150423148437504 2017-08-11 23:24:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting And third of all, he doesn't have time to teach the young boy right now. He's got King shit going on.
896124336393695232 2017-08-11 21:41:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani For your safety, don't go inside.
896113578683416577 2017-08-11 20:58:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCFan6871 I think he's blatantly pandering to women. Which is also why you see the league wearing pink in October.
896113259454935040 2017-08-11 20:57:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Getting Floyd off the couch is the greatest achievement in the history of MMA. Only Conor was capable of it. #McGregorMayweather
896111842078085120 2017-08-11 20:51:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I believe in Zeke. He's being railroaded by the worst commish the sports world has ever seen. #EzekielElliott
896111491081879552 2017-08-11 20:50:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet What he's saying, Ian, is you can't just take the woman's word for it.   Go and tell the others.
896110914474098688 2017-08-11 20:47:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @ufc That man there's a King. A KIIIING!
896110091841093632 2017-08-11 20:44:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh How do you feel when you feel things?
896109691108864000 2017-08-11 20:42:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter Adam, are you going to go back on Philly radio with those scumbags and celebrate?
896070798913306624 2017-08-11 18:08:21 UTC <ScottyP922> You see in the court of @nflcommish the burden of proof is whether a woman said so. #NFL #EzekielElliott #Cucked
896058512534458368 2017-08-11 17:19:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Woman accuses player.   Police deem not credible.   Cucked @nflcommish suspends player.   Enjoy the pink in October. #EzekielElliott #NFL
896056298537537536 2017-08-11 17:10:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFL @RapSheet Well then I sure hope another woman doesn't accuse him of something the police deem not worthy of charges.   Liberalism.
896054510732296195 2017-08-11 17:03:37 UTC <ScottyP922> So basically there's a whole shit ton of evidence that the Police department overlooked but that cucked liberal @nflcommish discovered.
895842024003440641 2017-08-10 02:59:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Ordonez @BloodyElbow Well, no. He would need a conscious opponent.
895812787364081665 2017-08-10 01:03:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @Betsafe @TheNotoriousMMA A little more than 4 years ago that man was on government assistance. #Inspired
895799083918667776 2017-08-10 00:08:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @Unclecreepymma Ian, you're a warrior. If you never fight again you have nothing left to prove. One of the greats, my friend.
895792437762957314 2017-08-10 23:42:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BrendanSchaub @MichaelRapaport @will_borowski Whenever these boxing snobs talk tough they need a reminder. Floyd's a boxer. Conor's a fighter. Floyd needs these rules to survive.
895783626293616641 2017-08-10 23:07:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BrendanSchaub @MichaelRapaport In a real fight Floyd would be dead.
895782857863548929 2017-08-10 23:04:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting He's a real fighter who doesn't need rules.
895751773109047296 2017-08-10 21:00:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Congratulations @Betsafe
895654914369703936 2017-08-10 14:35:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet We are raising a generation of pussies.

895435334619680769 2017-08-09 00:03:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @RebeccaShabad Breaking: Liberals are scumbags.
895434958411415553 2017-08-09 00:01:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund I still say that fight was stopped to protect Holly from all the amazing head kick counters Coach drilled into Ronda. It was gonna get ugly.
895432218151079936 2017-08-09 23:50:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher @Cowboys832 You just made that up.
895423360909402112 2017-08-09 23:15:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher Club Med. The same weak mentality that had the team unprepared in the playoffs after a vacation is back for camp.
895422495293046784 2017-08-09 23:12:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @HelmanDC Remember when Parcells was around and being injured wasn't so accepted?
895417536069738499 2017-08-09 22:52:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Hey, boss....this break sucks.
895392036400091136 2017-08-09 21:11:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie McGregor-Mayweather.   Always put the A-side first.

895128347575025665 2017-08-08 03:43:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX @ShadyTowel Stipe might be the only guy I'd give a shot against Jones. Maybe Cain if he can ever get healthy.
895127291394760704 2017-08-08 03:39:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi @MMAFighting @cworley50 The same MMA media that ignores this would condemn Conor.   Liberalism is cancer.
895118379949883395 2017-08-08 03:03:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX @ShadyTowel I'd pay to see it. Rather that than Lesnar.
895118100659658752 2017-08-08 03:02:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TheNotoriousMMA @Tiernan_Bradley @cjoye When you're a two time boxing world champion and get your ass kicked sparring an MMA fighter that's tough for the ego to handle.
895115185274400769 2017-08-08 02:51:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @ReggieWayne_17 @ChrisRose @nflnetwork @HarrisonNFL Your power rankings are shit.   Good talk.

895076104263913472 2017-08-08 00:15:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @VasylLomachenko @Mexicoss1 Hey boxing fans, every one of these boxers would be killed by McGregor in a real fight. They all need rules to survive.

894775617089970176 2017-08-07 04:21:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Look at the feints he's throwing. He's a future head collector. Long live the Prince.
894774854486044672 2017-08-07 04:18:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial At his core, Jon is a good man.

894534914602917888 2017-08-07 12:25:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter As if they haven't been through enough.
894358192666415105 2017-08-06 00:43:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Yes.

893962716880220161 2017-08-05 22:31:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @ALIAQUINTA Totally agree. I can't even take it seriously with him there.
893953300185403393 2017-08-05 21:54:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Because we all run and we all fight. No matter where you are on our planet.
893922169562050560 2017-08-05 19:50:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeffwagenheim I'd say not beating the unbeatable Jose Aldo hurts the most.   Wait.
893919476755943424 2017-08-05 19:39:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Snoop would switch stances after an Arianny Celeste leg kick.
893899718132195328 2017-08-05 18:21:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow So should Conor walk out with a high school diploma?
893899418054819847 2017-08-05 18:20:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange "Yeah I know your sister. I go knocker-up in the mornings."
893693624919216128 2017-08-04 04:42:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @RollingStone @Jaystew17 Feminism, Stewart.
893595911263309824 2017-08-04 22:14:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie The problem with this is that fight occurred at the beginning of his career and he didn't beat him boxing.
893594068147634181 2017-08-04 22:06:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @MonsterEnergy That man there is a King.
893479024592375808 2017-08-04 14:29:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom @TombstoneStint This coming from the MMA media who told you he'd never get this far.   Nobody cares what you think anymore.
893311806474784768 2017-08-03 03:25:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting @MattBeary I'm'm not a professional fighter. WTF does that have to do with DJ taking the safe route here?   Hard to respect him after that.
893273688694501377 2017-08-03 00:53:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting @MattBeary I see. Now you're going to make things up for a guy too afraid to risk his record.   It was a gutless move. Put an asterisk on it.
893224654306988033 2017-08-03 21:38:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting @MattBeary Yes. This is his first fight with PPV points. Dana's mentioned it many times.   Now who's confused?
893213408576884736 2017-08-03 20:54:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting @MattBeary Because he claims to be the best in the world. Did you realize it wouldn't be the same pay any way?
893204649586679808 2017-08-03 20:19:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheRock @photoshop_steve LMAO!
893186268225581056 2017-08-03 19:06:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting @MattBeary I saw it very clearly, thanks. He wanted no parts of TJ right now. The record gets an asterisk next to it.
893111749418901504 2017-08-03 14:10:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @PetesyCarroll @MMAFighting But the stain remains. He will always be the guy who wanted to play it safe to get the title defense record.
893109440559411200 2017-08-03 14:00:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @mmaballer13 Where did he say this?

892428095856279553 2017-08-01 16:53:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Covington dismissed the idea they were teammates on submission radio last week.
892385002348044288 2017-08-01 14:02:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet This man doesn't want to live in a world where you can't freely threaten to shoot people.
892350698104528897 2017-08-01 11:46:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm sure that will improve relations with the promotion.
892229284139610112 2017-07-31 03:43:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Gus. The Lesnar fight would take too long to make for it to be next. Let's see that rematch.

892194118927101953 2017-07-31 01:23:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I will now remove a head in your honor.

891967483179085825 2017-07-31 10:23:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BestFightPicks 1. Jones 2. McGregor 3. Joanna 4. DJ 5. Holloway
891966839680618496 2017-07-31 10:20:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma You're one of the best to ever do it. A true champion and hall of famer. Chin up, DC.
891965134574415872 2017-07-31 10:13:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MissJenShrader Yes. Every Monday.
891852748777541632 2017-07-30 02:47:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange They didn't have paternity tests back then.
891835983301398528 2017-07-30 01:40:42 UTC <ScottyP922> I think I can speak for every MMA fan when I say they need to run that Woodley/Maia fight back. #UFC214
891832962798563328 2017-07-30 01:28:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanVanCityPFGS LOL. What an absolute pussy.pic.twitter.com/y7U7MEVh1v

891773494987501569 2017-07-30 21:32:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @SandhuMMA @SeanVanCityPFGS Yes. Still feel the same way. You're wrong.
891625290027421696 2017-07-30 11:43:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet @SeanVanCityPFGS Yeah he did. You're making excuses for him.
891532524001906688 2017-07-29 05:34:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @im_BigQ I had it 1-1 with Jones on his way to winning the 3rd.
891531322312851456 2017-07-29 05:30:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Bisping says DC was cruising to a 3 rounds to none lead before the KO. What f'n fight was he watching? #UFC214
891530867528675328 2017-07-29 05:28:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet @SeanVanCityPFGS He had enough wits about him to argue with Big John, Dana and conduct an interview with Rogan. I don't buy it.
891525931239702528 2017-07-29 05:08:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Disappointed in Cormier not shaking Jones' hand. #UFC214
891510870433509376 2017-07-29 04:08:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Could we just have two more rounds of Lawler/Cerrone instead? #UFC214
891507955975303168 2017-07-29 03:57:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach, Conor and Jesus are cool. He may have his number.

891501481630851072 2017-07-29 03:31:31 UTC <ScottyP922> One day Cyborg will be beheaded and I will have an MMA erection that day. I loathe that mutated freak. #UFC214
891497919760801792 2017-07-29 03:17:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Apparently Cyborg can call timeout. #UFC214
891496697599324160 2017-07-29 03:12:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Probably over in 2 minutes. #UFC214
891493598063206400 2017-07-29 03:00:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Robbie gets any close decision. It's an MMA rule. #UFC214
891486551934472192 2017-07-29 02:32:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow We don't deserve this next fight.
891471750902448128 2017-07-29 01:33:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Barao is done. Unless he wants to be just a guy on the roster. #UFC214

891444432398159872 2017-07-29 23:44:49 UTC <ScottyP922> What a f'n fight! #UFC214
891442074054270977 2017-07-29 23:35:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I just can't trust Curran to win a fight.

891429864376545281 2017-07-29 22:46:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChaseShermanUFC I just said that. Quit spying my tweets, Chase.
891429524268883968 2017-07-29 22:45:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Amc427Colts You think? And give up the commentating career?
891427806944612352 2017-07-29 22:38:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Could this be DC's last fight? He loses tonight and where does he go from there at 39? #UFC214
891421240140992512 2017-07-29 22:12:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma @coachowenroddy @fritz_gruber So what's your prediction?
891413245654966274 2017-07-29 21:40:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @coachowenroddy Coach, I would normally pick Lawler but I think he may be done.
891412951684587522 2017-07-29 21:39:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma @coachowenroddy @fritz_gruber The best DC ever? I don't know about that. Rumble gave him his back and the Silva fight wasn't that impressive. He's 39, bro.
891412213235429380 2017-07-29 21:36:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma @coachowenroddy @fritz_gruber I hope so. I'd love to see a 3rd fight.
891411838033907712 2017-07-29 21:35:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @coachowenroddy Jones, Maia, Cyborg, Cerrone, Manuwa.

891141655763591169 2017-07-28 03:41:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting More like out to not get hit anymore. Sucks fighting real strikers.
891141249327038465 2017-07-28 03:40:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani #1 vs #2 in whose rankings?
891139132688355330 2017-07-28 03:31:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan I'd be very surprised. Bad matchup for him.
891138806069506048 2017-07-28 03:30:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChaseShermanUFC @25_JVB_BONES 2 div champ simultaneously. Took out Aldo after 10 years of dominance. Dominated Max  on 1 leg. Made Eddie look like an amateur. Yes I do.
891112329353605121 2017-07-28 01:45:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Yeah maybe so. I wonder if it effects his performance.
891108994630246400 2017-07-28 01:31:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom @RJcliffordMMA The MMA media has a thing for Brazilians. Yeah, Cyborg's a real victim.
891105909203750917 2017-07-28 01:19:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChaseShermanUFC @25_JVB_BONES That's, like, your opinion. He most certainly is, IMO.
891105114240450561 2017-07-28 01:16:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan @bokamotoESPN So pretty much if Jones wins he's coming back.
891099226398183425 2017-07-28 00:53:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChaseShermanUFC It will do maybe 1/3rd the PPV numbers of McGregor and a broomstick.
891098935120539648 2017-07-28 00:51:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Lawler is acting really weird this fight week. #UFC214
891088836402565121 2017-07-28 00:11:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The "best fight in UFC history" will be lucky to do over 600k PPV.   Stop banging that drum, Ariel. Nobody believes it.
891009872258641920 2017-07-28 18:58:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite @joannamma Lol...I own you.   Yes, ma'am!
890990836573507585 2017-07-28 17:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I'll wait until tomorrow before I believe DC/Jones 2 is actually going to happen.   Bones, for the love of God, stay in tonight. #UFC214

889591641983647745 2017-07-24 21:02:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @fritz_gruber I'd rather see Conor take on a challenge. Max got dominated on one leg.

888903585878204416 2017-07-22 23:28:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Jones' big advantage is his length. Don't know how smart it is to make it a ground fight. I'd keep it on the feet for the most part.

888786184381530112 2017-07-22 15:41:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @mmaballer13 I think Weidman's gonna get pieced up on the feet and finished in the 3rd round. Hope I'm wrong.

887028333929738241 2017-07-17 19:16:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think Joanna would beat her like she did Penne. It'd be ugly.

885883975067209728 2017-07-14 15:29:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani It's the format. The Aldo tour didn't get stale because it was a Q&A style. This is each giving a speech.

885685186540838914 2017-07-13 02:19:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Good. Expose the chin coming at him early in the fight. Precision beats power, timing beats speed. History made. A legend for the ages.
885669121127534592 2017-07-13 01:15:48 UTC <ScottyP922> You have to laugh at Floyd talking about quitting. He doesn't have the balls to ever make that walk. #McGregorMayweather

885642446968938496 2017-07-13 23:29:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Terrible idea to shelf Gaethje while he's got this momentum. They need to run back Alvarez/Poirier anyway.
885642000325914625 2017-07-13 23:28:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Gaethje, coaching - "Just walk through everything. Use your chin for defense. Alright now let's work on our backflips."

885594569936687106 2017-07-13 20:19:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Because Dana's in charge of separating them should things get heated and Floyd may actually end up in a real fight.
885591053516124162 2017-07-13 20:05:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BellatorMMA @joerogan @GoldieOnTV That's a really slow kick, Mike. Keep practicing.

885274499574267904 2017-07-12 23:07:42 UTC <ScottyP922> So apparently boxing's idea of a good press conference is to let the two fighters go at it back and forth without a mic. #McGregorMayweather

884811740172734465 2017-07-11 16:28:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @ufc With a bum knee, no wrestling training and a late notice opponent with the best wrestling in the division.  He just doesn't give a fook.
884796060484476929 2017-07-11 15:26:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @DustinPoirier @MMA_Jim @MeanFrenchyMMA Because he was whooping Eddie's ass in the first fight?
884741574218981376 2017-07-11 11:50:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Let's be honest. If Conor beats Floyd in boxing it'll be the greatest sports upset of all time to cries of a fix. #McGregorMayweather

884410907807408131 2017-07-10 13:56:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman This is how I have it too. Though I think Ferguson may get a late finish.
884372324866281472 2017-07-10 11:22:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @TomMcCoyTBE The "professor" is scared of a real fight. He needs these rules to survive.

884217427374026752 2017-07-09 01:07:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik And Conor KOs Aldo every time they fight. Too accurate, too rangy, too much power.
884217089355108352 2017-07-09 01:05:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik Stop with that nonsense. Conor would destroy Khabib on the feet. If it stays standing it's a one sided beating. A night off, actually.
884214536714297350 2017-07-09 00:55:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik Johnson hits hard but Conor is far more accurate. Gaethje's forward pressure would walk him right into an Aldo short night.
884213548162875393 2017-07-09 00:51:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik He's got a shot with the last two. The first three would style on him. Levels.

883868259086454785 2017-07-08 01:59:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @CabbageRELOADED A disaster considering this is supposed to be the big international fight week card.

883742926307831809 2017-07-08 17:41:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow I love how all the people who cried that Conor got a shot at Aldo too soon now think Gaethje should get an interim shot in his 2nd fight.
883742687509323776 2017-07-08 17:40:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Khabib/Ferguson is what's best for business.
883661932032655360 2017-07-08 12:19:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting He gets hit too much to beat Conor. McGregor's too accurate for him to last past 2 rounds. It'll be another head collected.
883661679795597312 2017-07-08 12:18:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I thought he was looking for his equal? Leave his superiors alone.
883549407333011456 2017-07-07 04:52:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @MMAFighting I mean, was that the first time he's seen Ryan Hall? That's what he does.
883548998472159234 2017-07-07 04:51:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Rumor has it part of the agreement for the Floyd fight is Conor won't criticize the 145 or 155 division in his absence. #TUF25Finale
883547573629464576 2017-07-07 04:45:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Johnson lost that fight shooting a takedown and engaging a clinch the two times he hurt Gaethje. #TUF25Finale

883537207147081728 2017-07-07 04:04:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Gaethje may be the real deal but he can't get hit like that against Conor.  His toes will curl. #TUF25Finale

883461058794541062 2017-07-07 23:01:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Maynard calls out @RusHammerMMA  I hope for his sake they don't make that fight. He's far too chinny to face Artem.  #TUF25Finale
883460368084946944 2017-07-07 22:59:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani What are the stakes?
883460150488686592 2017-07-07 22:58:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Disagree. I think this is the return of Gray Maynard. He's never looked sharper. Needs to slow things down but that's nitpicking.

876078787578007553 2017-06-17 14:07:14 UTC <ScottyP922> We got a fight of the year brewing here. #UFCSingapore
876077326597054464 2017-06-17 14:01:26 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-10. Nobody deserves to win that round. #UFCSingapore
876054114689527808 2017-06-17 12:29:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Illegal knee that will go unnoticed by the media because they worship Brazilians. #UFCSingapore
876053773050941440 2017-06-17 12:27:50 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't think RDA realizes the drubbing he avoided pulling from the McGregor fight. Two different levels. #UFCSingapore
876040341438291968 2017-06-17 11:34:28 UTC <ScottyP922> Well, that was tough to watch. #UFCSingapore
875873477798047745 2017-06-16 00:31:24 UTC <ScottyP922> The media still doesn't get it.   McGregor till I die.   #KingMac #UFC #McGregorMayweatherhttps://twitter.com/benfowlkesMMA/status/875726896821972992
875872990386429954 2017-06-16 00:29:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @benfowlkesMMA His fans won't turn on him and the naysayers don't matter.
875657925087428608 2017-06-16 10:14:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @antontabuena @BloodyElbow Going to be a long two and half months.
875541482513596419 2017-06-15 02:32:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboycerrone @Ruthless_RL @ufc We don't know what Lawler has left. If he gets handled here that could be it for him.
875540317977661441 2017-06-15 02:27:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @guicruzzz Makes you wonder if Conor and Nate did this before their fights.
875537597665333248 2017-06-15 02:16:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Ordonez @BloodyElbow A little rough on Floyd calling him a caveman.   How about just dead man?
875398942552444928 2017-06-15 17:05:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Is there anything more charming than Joanna's broken English?
875367828416847874 2017-06-15 15:02:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @ItsPhoenixJones @chaddundas Someone assure that pussy Floyd he doesn't need to worry. It won't be a real fight.
875322780266487808 2017-06-15 12:03:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @ChaseShermanUFC Whether you love him or hate him, he's opening up doors for MMA fighters in the future.
875305379999166560 2017-06-15 10:53:59 UTC <ScottyP922> The McGregor clan has been taking over people's villages for 300 years. Floyd's village is next. - @TheNotoriousMMA #McGregorMayweather #UFC
875192613548306432 2017-06-14 03:25:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove is great TV. The UFC has a star on their hands. Hope they realize it. #TUFRedemption
875184004420579328 2017-06-14 02:51:41 UTC <ScottyP922> One aspect people aren't considering. Can Conor mindfuck Floyd in the lead up to cause Floyd to fight out of character? #McGregorMayweather
875177621298065413 2017-06-14 02:26:19 UTC <ScottyP922> If Conor pulls this off he's the greatest prize fighter of all time. #McGregorMayweather #UFC
875177108821159938 2017-06-14 02:24:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Don't let the haters fool you. They will be hyperventilating in fear of a Conor left hand ending this early. #McGregorMayweather
875175161376514049 2017-06-14 02:16:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik If this was an MMA fight Floyd would be sent to the hospital. There's a reason why it's boxing only.
875174835017719810 2017-06-14 02:15:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jon_Anik He sees it as an easy payday against an 0-0 pro boxer.
875174074795929600 2017-06-14 02:12:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This is the same Max who lectured us about showing Aldo respect?
875173318818762752 2017-06-14 02:09:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @DustinPoirier Dustin, you are a true warrior with a champion's mindset. Your best is yet to come.
875172785458466816 2017-06-14 02:07:06 UTC <ScottyP922> The UFC is doing an Embedded for #McGregorMayweather #UFC
875172202152374273 2017-06-14 02:04:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @LordFonzz @BloodyElbow "between one of boxings all-time greats and the biggest star in MMA"  Mookie can't admit he's an all time great in MMA. It's an Aldo thing.
875144736448839680 2017-06-14 00:15:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Somebody's jelly.
875143302948978689 2017-06-14 00:09:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @DavidGbd Uh oh, it's the A-Team.
875143060400865284 2017-06-14 00:08:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Whether you love him or hate him, what Conor has accomplished in the span of 4 years is nothing short of amazing. #UFC #McGregorMayweather
875139336890703872 2017-06-14 23:54:11 UTC <ScottyP922> God, please..let that left hand land clean, hard and early. #McGregorMayweather
875138671707660289 2017-06-14 23:51:33 UTC <ScottyP922> He's absolutely 100% positive that he wins this fight and I stopped doubting Conor a long time ago. - @danawhite #McGregorMayweather
875137399516348416 2017-06-14 23:46:29 UTC <ScottyP922> My favorite part of every  @TheNotoriousMMA fight experience is the time when everyone says he can't do it. It's right before he does it.
875120078102167553 2017-06-14 22:37:40 UTC <ScottyP922> An MMA fighter brings Floyd out of retirement.   Only @TheNotoriousMMA #UFC #McGregorMayweather
875106115972935682 2017-06-14 21:42:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Because he's too big of a pussy to agree to a real fight.
874966930121252864 2017-06-14 12:29:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @GoldieOnTV @joerogan Bad move by the UFC.
874792888143630336 2017-06-13 00:57:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @TEN_GOP Shh. Just let it happen.
874784470431412224 2017-06-13 00:24:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @inversedotcom That guy's full of shit.
874737686308892672 2017-06-13 21:18:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Just. Like. That?
874682785155493889 2017-06-13 17:40:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Floyd needs rules to survive.
874475022269677568 2017-06-12 03:54:26 UTC <ScottyP922> They said he couldn't do it but thru self belief, hard work and joining the team you couldn't beat KD proved them all wrong. #NBAFinals2017
874364610656292865 2017-06-12 20:35:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Services for Floyd are tentatively scheduled for Friday, September 1st, 10am at Davis Funeral Home in Las Vegas.
874303068573224960 2017-06-12 16:31:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Holly is going to murk Bethe. It won't be competitive. #UFCSingapore
874104154922377220 2017-06-11 03:20:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @AaronFarris9 Ah the casual fans nonsense.   The UFCs a business. The worst drawing champ doesn't get to dictate title defenses. This isn't complicated.
874102336670576640 2017-06-11 03:13:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @AaronFarris9 Yeah that would be an example. If someone was retarded.
874099406605299713 2017-06-11 03:01:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @AaronFarris9 No but Dana does. DJ fights for the UFC. As the worst drawing champion in promotion history. He has earned nothing.
874099096323334148 2017-06-11 03:00:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @AaronFarris9 It's easy because I understand business. DJ has earned nothing. He's a terrible draw.
874098210285002752 2017-06-11 02:57:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @AaronFarris9 Nonsense.
873919943405961223 2017-06-11 15:08:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee One of the reasons why he's great.
873766935879700480 2017-06-10 05:00:45 UTC <ScottyP922> I'll put the likelihood of this being Lewis's last fight at 0%. #UFCAuckland
873766438615625729 2017-06-10 04:58:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Looks like another fighter Cyborg has to assault.
873761089338695680 2017-06-10 04:37:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Well scratch that one off my bucket list.
873733186479677440 2017-06-10 02:46:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @Mcslacky Yeah that's not how business works. The power should absolutely be in the hands of the UFC.
873685832317755392 2017-06-10 23:38:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I had no idea she was only 19. I guess that's why I only watch the Vivi.
873684592523399168 2017-06-10 23:33:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow Best card of the year.
873679709858672640 2017-06-10 23:14:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund He may feel like that's cheating.
873654921245192196 2017-06-10 21:35:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jordancorso Because that what's being talked about. Why DJ can't pick his opponents like others can. Keep up.
873654113065725953 2017-06-10 21:32:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jordancorso I suggest you take business 101 if you think DJ should be treated like McGregor.
873648077319671809 2017-06-10 21:08:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @SarahKSilverman Then he must be accusing you of winning.
873647729485983744 2017-06-10 21:07:04 UTC <ScottyP922> The irony.   Go count "swastikas" outside.https://twitter.com/SarahKSilverman/status/872102313002807296
873646662450860033 2017-06-10 21:02:50 UTC <ScottyP922> "PPV buys mean nothing".   I mean, what are you supposed to do with that?https://twitter.com/DudeRiley7/status/873640381853859842
873636517545222144 2017-06-10 20:22:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @TEN_GOP Should shock nobody. Liberals are scum.
873636305632186368 2017-06-10 20:21:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @TEN_GOP F feminism and sharia law.
873609200705949696 2017-06-10 18:33:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jordancorso @The_Stu23 That's because DJ only dreams of a Mayweather fight.
873592708144803840 2017-06-10 17:28:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jordancorso DJ isn't scared of TJ. He simply doesn't want to risk it right now. He wants the record first.   Well the UFC gets to decide that not him.
873592352472018944 2017-06-10 17:27:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jordancorso You better be a big draw if you think you're going to pick your opponents. DJ has no leverage. He doesn't want to risk the record against TJ
873589053295382528 2017-06-10 17:13:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani So Dana's awful for wanting to put together the best fight? DJ should be stripped if he refuses.
873561703098851328 2017-06-10 15:25:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maheawrestler You don't care if you lose?
873525587733860352 2017-06-10 13:01:44 UTC <ScottyP922> The media claims DJ is the lb for lb #1. I think @TheNotoriousMMA is. - @danawhite   You tell them, boss. What's a mouse to a King? #UFC
873369730601693184 2017-06-09 02:42:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump Greatest President since Reagan. #AmericaFirst #MAGA
873005812716892161 2017-06-08 02:36:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @arielhelwani @Orwelldone No problem, my friend. Keep fighting the good fight.
873004500746981376 2017-06-08 02:31:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @arielhelwani @Orwelldone Your sarcasm detector failed you this time, Kevin.

872824922980175873 2017-06-08 14:37:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting LOL
872823913348296704 2017-06-08 14:33:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I don't think that's even a debate. Gus is also better.
872613682462822400 2017-06-07 00:38:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani And you can't expect fans to really get excited for this fight considering how many times it's fallen through. Talk to me after weigh ins.
872612157065658373 2017-06-07 00:32:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Mac/Diaz 2 was more anticipated but this one has more on the line.
872610025625325568 2017-06-07 00:23:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Nah. Jacare/Camozzi 2.
872576964024029185 2017-06-07 22:12:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @DannySeguraTV Who would have thought an MMA fighter could make more than 50 million dollars over two years?
872569690408837120 2017-06-07 21:43:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @kujo6132 That'd be a home run for Bellator.
872548543650828290 2017-06-07 20:19:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @LoveSelenaCom So beautiful.
872510013473947654 2017-06-07 17:46:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani 100 K tops.
872503342202851328 2017-06-07 17:19:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu No respect for it.
872503311894814720 2017-06-07 17:19:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu I didn't respond to you. That's the thing. What he wants is to remain a PPV afterthought and find the safest fight for the record.
872384470116179968 2017-06-07 09:27:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu You responded to me. I didn't respond to you. If people truly cared then DJ wouldn't be the worst selling champ the UFC ever had.
872294997663592448 2017-06-06 03:31:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @DirkDiggler1010 Completely changes my view of him. The excuses are pathetic.
872294001730301954 2017-06-06 03:27:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @kimguilfoyle @TEN_GOP Umm...men too, Kim. Ya know, us lowly people.
872293550725238784 2017-06-06 03:26:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu You seem like a really scorned DJ fan.   Nobody cares. That's the thing.
872293381623382016 2017-06-06 03:25:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MightyMouseUFC @BrendanSchaub @Disco87Dave Welcome to Business 101, Dave. Where FS1 fighters aren't treated the same as the biggest draw in the sport.
872292664837910532 2017-06-06 03:22:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @BrendanSchaub Not really. His black ass would be fighting Floyd for tens of millions of dollars if he had the opportunity.
872292347333181442 2017-06-06 03:21:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu It's an excuse. A really weak one too.
872292293545426945 2017-06-06 03:21:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu And he did make that weight in wrestling.   So DJ is concerned a guy who never missed weight might miss so he wants to fight Borg who has.
872291800756740101 2017-06-06 03:19:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu Because who the F is DJ to get that special treatment? He's the worst drawing champion in UFC history.
872272584230023168 2017-06-06 02:02:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 Now I've given enough time to an Eagles fan.   Enjoy the Conor's scraps era.
872272221758246912 2017-06-06 02:01:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 Conor made them midgets.
872271970104225794 2017-06-06 02:00:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @eagleafan17 He'd wax that bum again without a camp.
872271779536019456 2017-06-06 01:59:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 So that 145 belt is really just the tallest midget. Max has the belt only because Conor isn't interested. And never forget it.
872271486916198400 2017-06-06 01:58:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 GSP didn't sleep Lawler in 13 seconds.
872271396814163968 2017-06-06 01:58:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 I'm sure you think you have a point with that but let me cut you off here. GSP didn't dominate Woodley on one leg.
872270506522812416 2017-06-06 01:54:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 Ah, now I see the problem besides your intelligence. You're a Max fan. Must sting to know Conor dominated that bum on one leg.
872270055765049344 2017-06-06 01:52:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 I'm going to guess you're not the reader of the family.
872269428045557761 2017-06-06 01:50:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 That's what that division is. It's been left in shambles. If it was football they'd all be the Philadelphia Eagles.
872269224340840448 2017-06-06 01:49:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Max "Blessed that Conor left the division" Holloway. #UFC212 #ConorsScrapsEra
872268740783747073 2017-06-06 01:47:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 Well first, F Max.   Second, stating McGregor is the GOAT isn't "hating" on him.   How old are you? Is there an adult in the room?
872268131825332224 2017-06-06 01:45:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 Then what was the point of your initial response?   "Hey Conor's the GOAT but let it go."  How about you just go F yourself?
872267247888343044 2017-06-06 01:41:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 I'm not interested in what you guarantee. You don't seem to get it. He doesn't have to return to be the GOAT.
872266743120613377 2017-06-06 01:39:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated @eagleafan17 An Eagles puke.   Whether he does or doesn't return, and you don't know that, he's the GOAT FW.
872259644470833152 2017-06-06 01:11:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @BlessedMMA @UFCrelated No but neither is McGregor.
872259500371304448 2017-06-06 01:10:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated Blessed era, my ass. More like Conor's scraps era. True 145 GOAT.
872237966198009856 2017-06-06 23:45:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu Conor didn't need those lame excuses. TJs never missed weight in his life. The guy DJ wants to fight has. It's an excuse.
872236261385392133 2017-06-06 23:38:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu I'm telling you you're an idiot and the name of the fill in opponent didn't matter. It matters to DJ.
872235447707213825 2017-06-06 23:35:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu You can't be this dense. If he loses the Mendes fight he doesn't get a title shot. Nobody gives a shit about an interim title.
872212373666443264 2017-06-06 22:03:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu He risked his title shot agreeing to fight Mendes. Didn't have to do it. Could have waited for Aldo. Took the fight anyway.
872163553444323328 2017-06-06 18:49:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu You're talking out of your ass. McGregor's pay didn't change in that fight.
872101263030222848 2017-06-06 14:41:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG Which is why, genius, he has never gotten PPV points despite all those title defenses.   This isn't complicated stuff.
872099337786077188 2017-06-06 14:34:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG He doesnt call the shots because he has no leverage. He has no leverage because he doesnt put butts in seats. Title defenses are irrelevant.
872098958969110529 2017-06-06 14:32:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG If you think DJ "calls the shots" in terms of who he fights you don't know your ass from your elbow.   DJ calls nothing.
872098713803644929 2017-06-06 14:31:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG If you think DJ, the worst PPV draw of any champion in UFC history, has any leverage in negotiations you lick windows for a living.
872097193641074689 2017-06-06 14:25:48 UTC <ScottyP922> The "greatest FW of all time" is now 0-2 against legitimate strikers. Finished twice. #UFC212
872096701317881856 2017-06-06 14:23:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG You're embarrassing yourself. Title defenses mean jack shit when it comes to negotiations with the UFC. It's why DJ never got PPV points.
872096034599600128 2017-06-06 14:21:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG Then you have no clue what you're talking about. This is a business. Nobody gives a shit how many title defenses you have.
872094580711313410 2017-06-06 14:15:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @TrevorRyanG The champ calls the shots? Maybe if you're a McGregor draw but a guy like DJ has no leverage. The UFC makes the fights.
872091781986484224 2017-06-06 14:04:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I have to agree with TJ. I don't think anyone's scared to fight but I don't think DJ wants to risk the record.
872088639592960000 2017-06-06 13:51:48 UTC <ScottyP922> https://youtu.be/WAWbUq0P4gk  Best back on planet Earth. @itz_mizdee @stacy_elliott @EzekielElliott #WeDemBoyz #FeedZeke
872034426875764736 2017-06-06 10:16:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @IAmRobWu It turned into an interim belt which is nothing more than #1 contender status that he already had.   Try again.
871923585329377283 2017-06-05 02:55:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc What the hell's so legendary about this card?
871900731745480705 2017-06-05 01:25:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BlessedMMA @MMAFighting Conor has to book Max a hotel in Hawaii.
871900457140137986 2017-06-05 01:24:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Of course he does.
871870372764942336 2017-06-05 23:24:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @PetrasSportsInc @b7283sosu @FranknessNYC These guys get it. It's a business. It's not about whether DJ is a great fighter or not. Of course he is.
871787911431192576 2017-06-05 17:56:49 UTC <ScottyP922> I disagree with @arielhelwani I don't think you have to be a casual fan to not believe Aldo is the 145 GOAT. #TheMMAHour
871787119211151360 2017-06-05 17:53:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Hummina hummina
871714898170044416 2017-06-05 13:06:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I wish I could act like it's even a debate but it's just not. Greatest 145er ever. Would smoke, again, either guy in the main event Saturday
871710901178597376 2017-06-05 12:50:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @KMundoB Very true. I feel for DJ. He's an all time great but it's a business at the end of the day.
871710683502653440 2017-06-05 12:49:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @vojta281 I'd say Ariel Helwani is a pretty rock solid source.
871710387317690368 2017-06-05 12:48:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Dana: Aldo pulled. You're fighting Chad Mendes next week.   Conor: It doesn't matter. They're all the same.
871705638346379264 2017-06-05 12:29:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's not even close.
871696509095608321 2017-06-05 11:53:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay promises he's gonna run over his next opponent like a truck with no brakes.  #UFC212  I'm starting to think he means no motor.
871695896710348800 2017-06-05 11:51:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @PaulBurton_15 And Conor beats the 2nd best on one leg. Levels. The gap is wide.
871671002538926081 2017-06-05 10:12:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove Did you just drop bars on us?
871506211044196352 2017-06-04 23:17:27 UTC <ScottyP922> I miss MMA Conor. Don't give a shit about boxing. #UFC
871497092442804224 2017-06-04 22:41:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @BlessedMMA @arielhelwani We expect more from you, Ariel.
871496952369643522 2017-06-04 22:40:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Correction, he talked in the Octagon after McGregor and claimed it wasn't a fight. Skipped both post fight pressers.
871496434750603264 2017-06-04 22:38:36 UTC <ScottyP922> When Conor lost he did the interview in the Octagon and post fight presser.   Aldo did neither after his losses.   #UFC212
871481866020429824 2017-06-04 21:40:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial @townscritt Could very well be true.
871481650332545024 2017-06-04 21:39:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Correct. After a week of hearing people like @Jon_Anik calling Aldo the GOAT it's good to see the truth come out. Best 145er of all time.
871479334275604481 2017-06-04 21:30:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @BestMMAnews Oh shit. I'd watch it.
871479086169903104 2017-06-04 21:29:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChrisWeidmanUFC @BlessedMMA Should have tanked Conor.
871321944842436608 2017-06-04 11:05:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @jjward3321 Telling the truth? Max was dominated on one leg. He isn't on Conor's level.
871229661627518976 2017-06-03 04:58:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Aldo without the leg kicks is like Dan Henderson without the H-bomb. #UFC212
871229492760653825 2017-06-03 04:57:52 UTC <ScottyP922> He just lost his belt by 3rd round finish without making his opponent deal with his best weapon. Seems dumb to me. #UFC212
871227567440891905 2017-06-03 04:50:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Why has Aldo stopped his leg kick game?  Maybe you didn't want to give Frankie the leg but Max isn't a takedown artist. #UFC212
871227141161185280 2017-06-03 04:48:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Conor would style on Max. Again. It wouldn't be competitive. They are both better than they were then. Not just Max.
871226304456265728 2017-06-03 04:45:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @allelbows @MMAFighting Probably but Aldo is more deserving of a rematch considering he styled on Edgar twice. Hard to sell that one though so it will be Frankie.
871225699931230208 2017-06-03 04:42:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @allelbows @MMAFighting The result says it was but I think giving Joanna close fights were overall better.
871224674847469569 2017-06-03 04:38:43 UTC <ScottyP922> What does Aldo do now? Well he sits back and waits for the UFC to hand him a belt for the 3rd time. #UFC212
871224449726590976 2017-06-03 04:37:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I'm going to guess he acts like this loss didn't happen either.
871223705812250625 2017-06-03 04:34:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Can we record Aldo backstage again?  Please? #UFC212
871223552200015872 2017-06-03 04:34:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst @CrispEvolution He's the best in the business with those breakdowns.
871223318405423105 2017-06-03 04:33:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Oh, I don't deserve this much happiness.   He beat on wrestlers afraid to strike with him. The sport has evolved since then. #UFC212
871222886501150721 2017-06-03 04:31:37 UTC <ScottyP922> And now? Really, Buffer? #UFC212
871222664249167872 2017-06-03 04:30:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Believe me when I tell you, that 13 second KO was a blessing for Hosay. It would have been a pummeling. A hellacious beating. #UFC212
871222098693410817 2017-06-03 04:28:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay is now 0-2 against real strikers. Finished both times.   Greatest featherweight my ass. #UFC212
871221878148526080 2017-06-03 04:27:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Shhhhhhhh. #UFC212
871221630541975552 2017-06-03 04:26:37 UTC <ScottyP922> The MMA media scores this 10-10. #UFC212
871220693345738752 2017-06-03 04:22:54 UTC <ScottyP922> That was probably Holloway's round anywhere but Brazil. #UFC212
871216225568927750 2017-06-03 04:05:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Please MMA Gods, let Max land a fluke punch that KOs Hosay in 14 seconds. #UFC212
871214092152963072 2017-06-03 03:56:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Feel bad for KK. She'll be back. #UFC212
871211952307154944 2017-06-03 03:48:10 UTC <ScottyP922> I love how KK tries not to laugh during all her intros. #UFC212
871210084445159424 2017-06-03 03:40:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think Gadelha is the best 3 round fighter at 115. Not ultimately what you want but should get her the win tonight.
871208293678686208 2017-06-03 03:33:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Let that be a warning to Max. Don't let it go to the judges. You're surrounded by corruption. #UFC212
871207164437819392 2017-06-03 03:29:08 UTC <ScottyP922> LOL. Bullshit Brazilian decision. #UFC212
871188790035050496 2017-06-03 02:16:08 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor is King. #UFC212
871168585762254852 2017-06-03 00:55:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow My technique is if Zane's dog is barking while he's giving his pick in the Vivi I go against him. Cashing in with that this year.
871166932266954753 2017-06-03 00:49:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow If Spicely wins this one I'll never pick against him again.
871043091507052544 2017-06-03 16:37:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MMAFighting You don't get to make that determination, Davey. If he loses tonight he's 0-2 against real strikers.
871042622529449985 2017-06-03 16:35:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @BelizeanBruiser Krikey. How the hell does this woman take punches in the face for a living? #Perfect10

870497128954474496 2017-06-01 04:27:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @josealdojunior @ufc And that was against an opponent who tore his shoulder in the fight. You have to go back over 5 years for a legit finish. Knee KO of Mendes.
870496704461549568 2017-06-01 04:26:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @josealdojunior @ufc If he does it'll be his first finish in nearly 4 years.
870447993782226945 2017-06-01 01:12:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @mmamania I've said for a couple of years now Max is the 2nd best in that division after the King.   We shall see on Saturday.
870446655002349568 2017-06-01 01:07:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting @nicholas_souza Yeah that tells me you're a waste of time. Enjoy watching the consolation bracket main event on Saturday.
870445639355772928 2017-06-01 01:03:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting @nicholas_souza Conor has one notable win? He's Buster Douglas? You're embarrassing yourself.
870444346658750464 2017-06-01 00:57:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting @nicholas_souza No but how many times did he beat McGregor during those 10 years? Aldo's the most accomplished. Conor's the GOAT.
870392228576931841 2017-06-01 21:30:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Ok but if the plan for the 2nd fight is to run thru him like a truck with no brakes I would suggest reconsidering.
870391527381639168 2017-06-01 21:28:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange We'll all have something to say on this as soon as we look up scatology.
870343072433025024 2017-06-01 18:15:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting It's not tarnished. It just made it clear he's not the greatest FW ever regardless of what the MMA media tries to tell you.
870342523365072896 2017-06-01 18:13:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @sean_spicier She might be able to do it if there are no stairs involved.
870220942227759105 2017-06-01 10:10:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Except for, like, the time he turned it down.   But other than that, anytime anywhere, man who slept me in 13 seconds!!
870097891842568193 2017-05-31 02:01:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @mmamania That fight will never be made with a 50-50 split.
870093825301254145 2017-05-31 01:45:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch Not much size difference between Conor and Woodley.
870092750347218944 2017-05-31 01:40:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Yeah I remember that in the McGregor fight. I think "die" in Portuguese means KO our hero like a bitch.
869700802360770560 2017-05-30 23:43:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Another media member calling Aldo the greatest FW ever.   I think they mean most accomplished.https://twitter.com/sherdogdotcom/status/869693657263112192
869693096493240320 2017-05-30 23:12:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Its tongue bathe Hosay Aldo week for the MMA media. Ive heard him called the best FW ever. Most accomplished. The best fights Floyd. #UFC212

869384360545447941 2017-05-29 02:45:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch Tell me if I'm crazy. A good case can be made that Gadelha is the best 3 round fighter at 115.
869345529372737537 2017-05-29 00:11:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti @MMAFighting Mickle: Honestly I don't think Conor stands a chance against Aldo and I'm going to put a lot of money on it.   How'd that work out?
869304084884533248 2017-05-29 21:26:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TEN_GOP Because @NBCNews is filled with liberals and liberals are anti-American scum.

859553512589545472 2017-05-02 23:41:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @BigToneMMA The damage on Conor was his own doing. Leg kicks. The damage on Nate was losing a boxing match.

852316224600121344 2017-04-12 00:23:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 What role is that, Rob? Taking your best player off the field on all 3rd downs? I'd rather leave that one unfilled.
852305590391099392 2017-04-12 23:41:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott @robphillips3 @dallasmavs @m00kiebetts @203GX @JohnYoung_18 @domwillb No RB in the NFL last year averaged more rushing yards per game than Elliott.   And he did it as a rookie.
852285573968670720 2017-04-12 22:21:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Beautiful girl, Ariel.
852256479000317954 2017-04-12 20:25:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MMAFighting And I always wanted to be the starting center fielder for the Yankees. Life sucks.
851969502321553409 2017-04-11 01:25:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott @robphillips3 @dallasmavs Best LT in the game with the best damn RB on the planet.
851956037959774208 2017-04-11 00:32:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @FloydMayweather Why don't you show some real balls and make this a kickboxing bout? You need rules. #McGregorMayweather
851942697476784128 2017-04-11 23:39:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Hey @UFC She's the best, you know?  UFC 211: Joanna Jdrzejczyk  Play With Fire (Highlights / Promo) https://youtu.be/jwvA97xAlzE via @YouTube

851935794839379968 2017-04-11 23:11:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This isn't a competitive fight.
851741991381684224 2017-04-11 10:21:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Well no more talking with Momma E thanks to the idiots who give her grief.
851735469696143362 2017-04-11 09:55:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Another bleeding heart liberal. Kelvin's just a victim. Like they are.https://twitter.com/DrummerBoy602/status/851659040136380417
851598672278294528 2017-04-10 00:52:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @united @JohnTheCho When Trump was elected they became violent. So he's responsible for their violence. It's liberal logic.
851509542768836615 2017-04-10 18:57:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange He hated that f'n game.
851469116154236928 2017-04-10 16:17:11 UTC <ScottyP922> https://youtu.be/eqI7YamHS34 #UFC
851439441147297793 2017-04-10 14:19:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @NickUFC @BloodyElbow Dana calls that ridiculous but an interim title at 155 scheduled right after the belt has been won makes sense.
851439015299559424 2017-04-10 14:17:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @Anthony_Rumble The scariest man ever to walk into the Octagon.   Enjoy retirement.
851432674602385408 2017-04-10 13:52:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Love trumps hate, Paul. Just pray.
851432266849038336 2017-04-10 13:50:45 UTC <ScottyP922> So they called the fight because Weidman didn't know what month or day it was.  I don't feel good about his future as a fighter. #UFC210
851126120011501568 2017-04-09 17:34:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Oh. Hells. Yes.
850939958537990144 2017-04-08 05:14:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @shaunalshatti Yeah but not really. Points aside, that was a terrible 1st round for Rumble.
850931876441272325 2017-04-08 04:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> So I paid $65 to see the ref KO Weidman and Rumble wrestle and retire.  F me. #UFC210
850930508955615232 2017-04-08 04:36:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow If he's writing for Bloody Elbow I'm going to unfollow you.
850930128423198720 2017-04-08 04:35:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Rumble's last fight. He probably figures if he can't win the title with such a kickass game plan what's the use? #UFC210
850929273720512512 2017-04-08 04:32:03 UTC <ScottyP922> So apparently Rumble's strategy was to wrestle with DC. #UFC210
850897851995574273 2017-04-08 02:27:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Maybe the UFC is a different level.
850876024502046722 2017-04-08 01:00:27 UTC <ScottyP922> If Weidman loses tonight he goes up to 205. #UFC210
850874513130741760 2017-04-08 00:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The fact that he mentioned that right away tells you he knew it was an early stoppage.
850873910254084096 2017-04-08 00:52:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Early stoppage. #UFC210
850857946552684545 2017-04-08 23:48:37 UTC <ScottyP922> More like McGregor Gillespie. #UFC210
850836895517036546 2017-04-08 22:24:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Hate the 3 man booth. Too crowded. #UFC210
850709282454740994 2017-04-08 13:57:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet What's amazing is that account is still active. Twitter is a liberal cesspool.
850707187055939584 2017-04-08 13:49:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TXMotorSpeedway @NASCAR When a quarter of your field misses qualifying maybe you need to lighten up on all the rules. Just a thought.

850482476166393856 2017-04-07 22:56:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet @mitchellvii Spirited debate is healthy.
850475252794753024 2017-04-07 22:27:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani That's a ridiculous comment.
850474531437367296 2017-04-07 22:25:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Cormier barely making weight has me second guessing my pick for the fight. #UFC210
850473802521870337 2017-04-07 22:22:10 UTC <ScottyP922> It's cool. The NSAC tried to accuse @TheNotoriousMMA of having ball implants. #UFC210 #KingMac #BigIrishBalls
850471251764285440 2017-04-07 22:12:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Thought I had that Cummins fight figured out until I saw that mustache in weigh ins.   I stand corrected.  Cummins by 1st round KO. #UFC210
850439303364784129 2017-04-07 20:05:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Now c'mon. What happened to just being nuts?
850437120154009600 2017-04-07 19:56:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Now I understand why professional athletes always say they have a family to feed.
850371964137074688 2017-04-07 15:37:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet The left still doesn't understand that Trump doesn't give a shit about their criticism. They no longer matter.
850366074965065728 2017-04-07 15:14:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow As if he'd turn down fighting Mayweather.
850365583443021828 2017-04-07 15:12:08 UTC <ScottyP922> How the hell do you lose 1.2 lbs in 5 minutes? #UFC210
850119171245518848 2017-04-06 22:52:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti The guy is his own worst enemy.

849335017599795200 2017-04-04 18:57:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @toddarcher It's why the Cowboys should not have released Romo. Retain his rights.

848596765918060544 2017-04-02 18:03:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan That's liberalism, Joe, and you wanted Hillary to win the election.

847231133674741760 2017-03-29 23:36:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Yes because everyone remembers all those riots when Obama was elected. https://twitter.com/egojab/status/847216100156686336
847207005467168768 2017-03-29 22:01:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase I agree. 2016 was their best year ever. 2017 looks like a disaster after the sale. No PPV draws.
847205868219326464 2017-03-29 21:56:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase So suggesting Joanna isn't an option for them in 2017 is laughable to me.
847205745225555968 2017-03-29 21:56:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Because it shows the last k of options the UFC has. They don't have any PPV stars right now
847205310955708416 2017-03-29 21:54:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase No. Because I look at the numbers the PPVs do without Conor or Ronda. You on the other hand didn't know DJ headlined.
847204589141135360 2017-03-29 21:51:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase You said you can see why the UFC doesn't. I'm saying your both wrong.
847204353559662593 2017-03-29 21:50:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Well then it will be pretty tough for any woman then. Undefeated dominant champ who's always active.
847204064786046976 2017-03-29 21:49:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScoutKelley Jourdan Lewis?
847203338718523393 2017-03-29 21:46:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase See this is how a discussion works. You just commented again. The argument against Joanna headlining.
847203002830270466 2017-03-29 21:45:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase I responded to you every time.   Maybe you just don't like how weak your argument is.
847202304545755136 2017-03-29 21:42:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase You responded to me. Was I suppose to say nothing?
847201778437369856 2017-03-29 21:40:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Try to plan out 12 PPVs this year without Conor and Ronda. Tell me how Joanna isn't one of your better options to headline.
847201099736109056 2017-03-29 21:37:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase With plenty of time to change the card. They gave DJ his chance. Joanna deserves the same.
847200426198020098 2017-03-29 21:34:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase DJ headlined 178.
847200125726412801 2017-03-29 21:33:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase My point is Joanna is a dominant Champion with a pretty good following and she produces good fights. She earned her chance.
847199639472410624 2017-03-29 21:31:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Like Woodley, DJ, Holm, Holloway. Miococ last card only did ok because of CM Punk.
847198789739982849 2017-03-29 21:28:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Casual fans are only enticed by Conor and Ronda. Check the numbers.
847198613247864832 2017-03-29 21:27:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase She's a better bet to pull some numbers than some of the others headlining cards.
847198050837770241 2017-03-29 21:25:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @ltsChase Another hollow statement with no proof.   "Just because" isn't that convincing.

844321851639824385 2017-03-21 22:56:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @nfldraftscout @ianapowers I would love to.   It just won't be any idiot who tells me the Cowboys should have drafted Ramsey over Elliott.
844321660220198912 2017-03-21 22:55:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Ian, I feel like I'm hitting you with your own hands. This is embarrassing.
844321549352095744 2017-03-21 22:55:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers I'll ask the Cowboys GM who took Elliott over Ramsey.
844321385971433474 2017-03-21 22:54:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @nfldraftscout @ianapowers There is no position that is better stocked on a yearly basis with collegiate talent than CB.
844321056756305920 2017-03-21 22:53:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @nfldraftscout @ianapowers Yeah because I give a shit what Matt has to say.   What are you, 12? Handle your own business.
844320686046941185 2017-03-21 22:51:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Yeah and I'm telling you you don't know your ass from your elbow making an idiotic statement like that.
844320425115090944 2017-03-21 22:50:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers LOLOLOL!  Oh you watch PTTD? I stand corrected.
844319770044436480 2017-03-21 22:48:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers All you're doing is telling me you don't know anything about the NFL draft.
844319608551227393 2017-03-21 22:47:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Buy you're a guy who thinks an irrelevant cornerback should have been drafted instead of Zeke Elliott.   I'll cope.
844318665717768192 2017-03-21 22:43:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers When you have nothing, insult and see if that works.
844318560876974080 2017-03-21 22:43:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers There's a deep crop of corners every year. It doesn't run in cycles. You have no idea what you're talking about.
844298381715484678 2017-03-21 21:23:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScoutKelley As a Cowboys fan I would hate that.
844297551906066432 2017-03-21 21:19:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @rditto Lott was a S. Woodson a CB/S. Deion was truly special. Who's the best corner? Sherman? 5th round draft pick.
844296777004019712 2017-03-21 21:16:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers The CB class is deep every year. There are more quality CBs coming our of the draft on a yearly basis than any other position.
844296455078776832 2017-03-21 21:15:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers An impact player makes players around them better. Zeke does that. Ramsey doesn't.
844271644587819014 2017-03-21 19:37:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Exactly. CBs aren't impact players. Zeke Elliott is. We're making progress.
844271366257987585 2017-03-21 19:35:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Not true. The CB class is always deep. They can be found everywhere. The Cowboys found one last year in the 6th round.
844271004025282566 2017-03-21 19:34:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers The Cowboys 2012 offseason should have proven that loading up on CBs doesn't win you anything.
844270842808848384 2017-03-21 19:33:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Lol. Ian being called retarded my you is a compliment. That's the thing.
844270695999856640 2017-03-21 19:33:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @CMonner So put a great back behind that line and dominate. Worked well the first year. No way do I give that up for any CB.
844270336053010432 2017-03-21 19:31:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers And my point is, moron, you can find CBs to win with too. Don't need to waste top 5 picks on one.
844270003818020865 2017-03-21 19:30:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @PriscoCBS @Cowboys_71 @miguelmillanh @CMonner I agree with that.
844269900612980736 2017-03-21 19:30:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Ramsey's a dime a dozen CB. Nothing special. Nice player. Can find one like him in every draft.
844269677522161665 2017-03-21 19:29:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers That obviously was too complicated for you. You have to face Zeke. You can avoid a CB.
844269135446114306 2017-03-21 19:27:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @CMonner @ianapowers Couldn't I say you and Petey have a Ramsey man crush?  Or should we just be adults?
844268799088058368 2017-03-21 19:25:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner If a QB has time he will find that #1 WR enough to win games. Shutdown corner doesn't exist.
844268539716472832 2017-03-21 19:24:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner @miguelmillanh You can take a CB out of a game. Can't do that w/Zeke.
844268413170147330 2017-03-21 19:24:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner @miguelmillanh Damn right.
844268314398543872 2017-03-21 19:23:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @PriscoCBS @Cowboys_71 @ianapowers @miguelmillanh @CMonner No. It's not. Pete has no point. He just thinks he does.
844268110781845504 2017-03-21 19:22:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Let what sink in? He's a good back. He didn't get 1600 in 14 full games and challenge for MVP as a rookie.   Special.
844267805218422784 2017-03-21 19:21:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @ianapowers Write this stuff down, Ian.
844267702382465026 2017-03-21 19:21:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @CMonner @ianapowers Zeke makes any team instantly better by his presence. Ramsey is irrelevant without a front seven
844267510623035393 2017-03-21 19:20:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner @miguelmillanh Yeah. He's 21. So ten year career at an Emmitt Smith level.
844267320629497857 2017-03-21 19:19:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @CMonner @ianapowers They had the same line in 2015.
844267023895085059 2017-03-21 19:18:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner Not as a 21 year old rookie he didn't.
844266618180026369 2017-03-21 19:17:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @rabblerousr You clearly are too stupid to realize the waste of the Cowboys 2012 offseason.
844266276000354305 2017-03-21 19:15:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner The average RB doesn't come in as a rookie and have an MVP candidate year.
844266157385433100 2017-03-21 19:15:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner Right. On average.   Zeke isn't average. Special. Hence the top 5 value.
844265868783767555 2017-03-21 19:14:03 UTC <ScottyP922> This guy sounds intelligent.https://twitter.com/ohmoses/status/844265458941411328
844265770813177857 2017-03-21 19:13:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers They didn't improve because they don't matter because they don't win you the LOS. Zeke does.
844265551782461440 2017-03-21 19:12:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers @CMonner Who says Zeke will play well for 5? You?
844265311113306112 2017-03-21 19:11:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @rabblerousr Unless it's a special player like Zeke.   Ramsey isn't special.
844265162420969472 2017-03-21 19:11:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @rabblerousr Yeah, no. I can get that player in every draft and they don't matter as much as a player who wins the line of scrimmage   Dude.
844264856777867264 2017-03-21 19:10:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers There's also a reason why the Cowboys D didn't improve with Carr and Claiborne.
844264665068789760 2017-03-21 19:09:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers That has to do with the short shelf life of backs, Melvin.
844264418749878273 2017-03-21 19:08:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @rabblerousr LTs and REs are rare. So is Zeke. A player like Ramsey isn't.
844263901072113664 2017-03-21 19:06:14 UTC <ScottyP922> One of the dumbest statements I've ever read.https://twitter.com/ianapowers/status/844263771304427521
844263253635153925 2017-03-21 19:03:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS LOL.   Ok.
844263007324700673 2017-03-21 19:02:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS @ianapowers Yes. Dime a dozen. Take a look at this year's draft class.   Games are won/lost at the line of scrimmage
844261958123737088 2017-03-21 18:58:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS And been worse off.   Could draft a cornerback any year. There's always a dozen of them. Zeke is rare.
844261082697023493 2017-03-21 18:55:02 UTC <ScottyP922> A man who says the Cowboys made a big mistake drafting one of the greatest rookie RBs in league history finds another take comical.https://twitter.com/PriscoCBS/status/844260280033038336
844253596464111616 2017-03-21 18:25:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboys_71 @PriscoCBS LOL. I admire your conviction to be wrong. Cornerbacks are a dime a dozen. RBs like Zeke are special.

840720610938490880 2017-03-11 00:26:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @elfangel11 "Trump likely does" because, ya know, I'm a liberal and I hate him. So lets run with that.

838555883567185920 2017-03-05 01:04:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow This is the time when they talk. Later they do nothing. Then it's on to the next guy being the one.
838521222673674241 2017-03-05 22:46:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Happy 29th B-day to Mama E. Cowboys Nation loves you.
838213647885291520 2017-03-04 02:24:41 UTC <ScottyP922> HOLY F!! #UFC209
838212207980777472 2017-03-04 02:18:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think Elkins is cut.
838210781997056003 2017-03-04 02:13:18 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-9 Elkins. #UFC209
838208961513984000 2017-03-04 02:06:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This could be FOTN. Elkins is so damn tough.
838204967609589760 2017-03-04 01:50:12 UTC <ScottyP922> And that's why MMA is the greatest sport in the world. #UFC209
838204830468435969 2017-03-04 01:49:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Alcantara was toying with him the whole fight.
838191883176280064 2017-03-04 00:58:12 UTC <ScottyP922> When the rumor came out that the King was going to attend #UFC209 Khabib pulled.   It was a smart decision.
838190465350512640 2017-03-04 00:52:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow One more question. Would you try for a 4th time to make Khabib/Ferguson or move on?
838189971051855872 2017-03-04 00:50:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow What do you think of the card without the co-main?
838189061630210048 2017-03-04 00:46:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst Did you make a pick on Khabib/Ferguson before it got pulled?
838188476151513089 2017-03-04 00:44:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This guy's really impressive.
838187330032795649 2017-03-04 00:40:06 UTC <ScottyP922> How much different would this feel if Khabib/Ferguson was still on? #UFC209
838180355706400768 2017-03-04 00:12:24 UTC <ScottyP922> This 3 man booth sucks. #UFC209

837880705313026050 2017-03-03 04:21:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I'm not sure I'd want a fight promotion's doctors to decide whether I'm healthy enough to fight. They have reason to clear you.
837833776227037184 2017-03-03 01:15:13 UTC <ScottyP922> From Fight Pass to the PPV main card.   The state of the #UFC without McGregor.https://twitter.com/MMAjunkie/status/837830192529883136
837829039805067264 2017-03-03 00:56:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani This guy is number 2 bullshit.
837812096524038144 2017-03-03 23:49:04 UTC <ScottyP922> He should PPV that instead of this mediocre card. It'd do a better number. #UFC209https://twitter.com/Maclifeofficial/status/837807548174458880
837796422086950912 2017-03-03 22:46:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Oh, Dana HATES Ariel Helwani. #UFC209
837785090050621442 2017-03-03 22:01:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Never happen. He's not ever taking a short notice fight. Couldn't for this one anyway being in Brazil.
837784142788104193 2017-03-03 21:57:59 UTC <ScottyP922> He's willing to behead Tony tomorrow if they beg him.   I mean hands and knees groveling.   Save the card, @danawhite #UFC209
837780958728208384 2017-03-03 21:45:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani That is exactly what I say to myself when this happens.
837767741180424192 2017-03-03 20:52:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @Noah287 Probably not but I would.
837767199741919233 2017-03-03 20:50:40 UTC <ScottyP922> If I was the UFC, I'd make Ferguson/Lando 2. #UFC209
837756670826668033 2017-03-03 20:08:49 UTC <ScottyP922> What will happen sooner?   Peace in the Middle East or Khabib vs. Ferguson? #UFC209
837751317040926721 2017-03-03 19:47:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @Ealvarezfight <------ Real fighter.
837747550090297344 2017-03-03 19:32:35 UTC <ScottyP922> How delusional do you have to be to say this?   1) They don't fight anymore.   2) They never drew without Silva or McGregor.   #UFC209https://twitter.com/GooseTronics/status/837746623241412608
837745947178332162 2017-03-03 19:26:13 UTC <ScottyP922> How you can be a fan of fighters like Aldo, the Diaz brothers and Khabib who don't show and hate McGregor who does is beyond me. #UFC209
837743936617730048 2017-03-03 19:18:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @TonyFergusonXT @MMAFighting @TeamKhabib @ufc @danawhite Well WTF. We can't even get some trash talk. Pffffft.
837742452102598658 2017-03-03 19:12:19 UTC <ScottyP922> You disrespect the King and the MMA Gods will smite you, Dana. #UFC209
837740963929931776 2017-03-03 19:06:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @LynchOnSports For a 4th time? Nah.
837740640343584768 2017-03-03 19:05:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani This PPV will be lucky to do 250K.

837734856046034944 2017-03-03 18:42:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Khabib vs. Ferguson is a myth. It's not real. Don't book it again for a 4th time. #UFC209

836991134555590656 2017-03-01 17:26:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Because the MMA media is just as liberal as the mainstream media?

835227815192719361 2017-02-24 20:40:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @MartinWLuke @j_budders He didn't mishear anything. He talked about the 2nd Giants game and how Aaron Rodgers took over.
835227594605871104 2017-02-24 20:39:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke I think we disagree more than you think. Dak was a game manager. Fortunate to play in that offense.
835227325071503360 2017-02-24 20:38:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke So to beat the Giants we have to stop Aaron Rodgers?   Maybe this is why you think Dak over Zeke.
835226568855269378 2017-02-24 20:35:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke We lost the 2nd Giants game because Aaron Rodgers was too good?
835226317280931844 2017-02-24 20:34:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke We came out flat because our coward coach gave the team a 3 week vacation. That's another issue.
835226166093041665 2017-02-24 20:33:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke In the 2nd Giants game?
835225960198852608 2017-02-24 20:32:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Gurley isn't Zeke. Please stick with the actual players in comparison here.
835225791587889153 2017-02-24 20:32:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Well we had the greatest rookie QB ever in that game and lost it.
835225532983836672 2017-02-24 20:30:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Zeke would have shined anywhere. Dak was a product of the talent around him.
835225326540230656 2017-02-24 20:30:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke I do think see it as a tough call. Zeke makes Dak. Not the other way around.
835225081617997824 2017-02-24 20:29:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @MartinWLuke @j_budders No...I'm making myself look like something other than a fan boy.
835224910087745536 2017-02-24 20:28:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke LOL..So we shouldn't give it to him because his coward coach sat him. Dak missed last game too.
835224658878279681 2017-02-24 20:27:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Defenses look to stop Zeke. Not Dak.
835224576044974080 2017-02-24 20:27:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Irrelevant what's harder. Zeke was the focal point of the offense. Dak a game manager.
835223757379747840 2017-02-24 20:23:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Zeke over Dak. Not even a question.
835223696017063936 2017-02-24 20:23:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke And Roethlisberger's rookie season was comparable.
835223611875147776 2017-02-24 20:23:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders @MartinWLuke Disagree. More yards but thats because Jason Garrett is a coward who shut Zeke down against Lions.
835215971845562368 2017-02-24 19:52:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders Irrelevant. That just means most surprising not best. Best was Zeke.
835215789036830720 2017-02-24 19:52:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @j_budders Yeah and the best rookie season was Zeke. The focal point of the offense, not Dak.

835215083559141376 2017-02-24 19:49:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @nytimes @arielhelwani Very good. That means there are consequences for your actions. Get used to it.

835201129231368196 2017-02-24 18:54:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys Zeke #1. Might be best RB in league. Dak isn't best QB.

834179874411667456 2017-02-21 23:15:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated It wouldn't. McGregor/Diaz 3 does a better number. People are overrating GSPs draw. It's not 2012 anymore.

833554103963893760 2017-02-19 05:49:19 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't share Hendricks' enthusiasm for his career at 185. He won't get another 5'9" opponent. #UFCHalifax
833544531723317249 2017-02-19 05:11:17 UTC <ScottyP922> So does anyone on the planet believe Lewis was bent over grimacing after getting kicked because he had to crap? #UFCHalifax

833542796195856384 2017-02-19 05:04:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow For a minute there I thought Zane was taking time off.
833541147825958912 2017-02-19 04:57:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Lewis has power but the top of the division will murk him. #UFCHalifax
833534881846140928 2017-02-19 04:32:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman But isn't he really up against it with the other MWs? 69 inch reach. I almost want him to just retire on a good note.
833534458137542657 2017-02-19 04:31:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Sometimes genius coaching takes awhile to sink in. Browne by KO.
833526847031930881 2017-02-19 04:01:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Then again, I'm not sure I want to see Johny against real MWs.

832053448182992897 2017-02-15 02:26:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA They should compromise and make it a kickboxing bout.   Heel to chin and Floyd goes nite nite.
832052990035030016 2017-02-15 02:24:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @iNisarKhan @mbraig Correct. Which is why Floyd would only ever do boxing. He needs rules to protect him.
832052690440028162 2017-02-15 02:23:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA They stopped the video right before he punched a hole in the SUV.

830661624713326592 2017-02-11 06:15:38 UTC <ScottyP922> I think those judges had the fight scored for Silva before it started. Complete BS. #UFC208
830607240994418689 2017-02-11 02:39:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman Maybe this is Dana's way of extending an olive branch to Conor.
830606660221665280 2017-02-11 02:37:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Zane, totally unrelated but don't let Connor talk you out of taking Lobov over Cub in that Vivi.
830605669569069060 2017-02-11 02:33:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman @BloodyElbow Main event too.
830602913584119809 2017-02-11 02:22:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Reis is criminally underrated. Serious threat to the Champion. #UFC208
830594032774557697 2017-02-11 01:47:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Basically this is the trip takedown vs. the guillotine choke.
830593070274068481 2017-02-11 01:43:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Seen a 10-8 for Makhachev. That's crazy.
830590020973166592 2017-02-11 01:31:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Who gives a shit about Nik Lentz, really? #UFC208
830588099184979969 2017-02-11 01:23:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Cormier talks too much. Doesn't work with Joe. #UFC208
830586705342259201 2017-02-11 01:17:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I picture Conor being fed grapes as he watches the minions attempt to entertain him. #UFC208
830585950313050114 2017-02-11 01:14:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @RichardWeaving OMG HITLER!!!! #HeWillNotDivideUs
830581394602651648 2017-02-11 00:56:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Give me Goldberg back with Joe over this three man booth. #UFC208
830570044589498368 2017-02-11 00:11:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump She's all class. Like our First Lady.
830485524762726401 2017-02-11 18:35:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Is this like a nerves thing? Seems odd to happen twice right before a fight.
830484987094904835 2017-02-11 18:33:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I feel terrible for Uncle Creepy. That guy can't buy a break.
830483953693896706 2017-02-11 18:29:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @RickJLee @arielhelwani What the hell.
830459003092217860 2017-02-11 16:50:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach, how it work is whoever loses the main event is the new women's interim FW champion.
830458335606484992 2017-02-11 16:47:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh They call him the Diamond because "he's a quiet little hillbilly from the back ass of nowhere" is too long.

830163934716055553 2017-02-10 21:18:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Many of these people hate America and all it stands for. Over 1000 refugees here since the travel ban block. It has to stop.
830163357479100416 2017-02-10 21:15:42 UTC <ScottyP922> American immigration used to mean the world's best and brightest. Now it's the world's battered woman's shelter.   Thank liberals.

828114894230786048 2017-02-04 05:35:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Grasso just wasn't active enough. #UFCHouston
828114579502878722 2017-02-04 05:34:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Shout out to the judge that gave Felice the 3rd round. #UFCHouston
828114359041798144 2017-02-04 05:33:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Biggest robbery since the OSP fight earlier.
828113742256861184 2017-02-04 05:31:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow 10-7 3rd round for Grasso. She wins the fight.   Zane. Just give this to me.

828101176306589696 2017-02-04 04:41:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow OSP needs to get to a real camp, bro. Like maybe GFC.

828086248975785984 2017-02-04 03:42:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Amanda_Leoa @ufc Edmond could clean up her boxing for her.
828085102919958528 2017-02-04 03:37:28 UTC <ScottyP922> Andrade is like a mini Cyborg at 115. #UFCHouston

828082978286866432 2017-02-04 03:29:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Can we just stop this fight right now and give these two ladies bonuses? #UFCHouston
828082232665440256 2017-02-04 03:26:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Angela, Nate Diaz called....he wants his chin back. #UFCHouston
828078869756444672 2017-02-04 03:12:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @requestken It is odd this opens the main card and Grasso is the co-main. I guess that speaks to the UFC's belief in each.
828077436071968768 2017-02-04 03:07:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I like seeing 3 fights for the women on this card.
828077167951114240 2017-02-04 03:05:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Those highlights make me want to go back and watch Stephens/Bermudez again. What a fight. #UFCHouston
828076397268721665 2017-02-04 03:02:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sheriff_Hodgson @JudgeJeanine That's exactly what should happen.

828073624548564992 2017-02-04 02:51:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think Andrade might be able to take the title at 115. Am I crazy? That power can take out anyone in the division.
828059942678564867 2017-02-04 01:57:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @AlexaGrasso @ufc Daddy like.
828042629707362305 2017-02-04 00:48:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Don't really see a very competitive fight here. Probably goes all 3 rounds since Torres isn't a finisher.

827912939873116160 2017-02-04 16:13:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Is this supposed to be a knock against him?
827912692916699138 2017-02-04 16:12:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Yeah, they're not fighters anymore.
827770123666735104 2017-02-03 06:45:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Will there be activities?
827707038113357826 2017-02-03 02:35:10 UTC <ScottyP922> On FS1 now you can witness the King make arguably the best LW in history look like an amateur.   A fookin masterpiece. #UFC205 #Reloaded

827560133769252864 2017-02-03 16:51:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Of course it's a lie but even if it wasn't it shows the liberal cancerous mindset. If you're illegal you shouldn't be here.

826921727871574016 2017-02-01 22:34:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @fritz_gruber Most probably agree. I like the backstory of Jones and DC. There's real bad blood there.
826921070779330560 2017-02-01 22:32:01 UTC <ScottyP922> If Jon Jones is ever going to lose, it just might be this next fight. Cormier or AJ after another long layoff may be too much. #UFC

826105351086956545 2017-01-30 16:30:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @FOXSports @BestMMAnews The UFC could use the ratings draw right now.
826103326500671488 2017-01-30 16:22:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Because they can't stand they lost the election and many of these people have no respect for America.
826103090394886144 2017-01-30 16:21:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani 13% of Muslims around the world are effected by the ban. Pretty clear you just rely on MSM for your opinions.
826101939482017792 2017-01-30 16:17:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani And these restricted countries? That list was put together by Obama not Trump. Put down the protest sign and educate yourself.
826101500820746240 2017-01-30 16:15:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Was Ariel disgusted by Obama's 6 month ban of Iraqis? He's a liberal. He actually believes the BS MSM says about Trump.
826079733783871489 2017-01-30 14:48:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @Gallup @AdamReigner @williamjordann @iacus_ Yeah like they reflected Clinton's lead in the election.   You're desperate.
825951876273287169 2017-01-29 06:20:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @williamjordann @AdamReigner @Gallup It takes a special kind of arrogance to still use polls to try to discredit President Trump.

825557037245411328 2017-01-28 04:11:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jmadams03 It's a bad matchup for Pena. She needs the clinch and that still is Ronda's wheelhouse. Toss. Arm bar.
825556456955138048 2017-01-28 04:09:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I'd give him one more fight before that but I would never tell him that to his face.

825538226446282753 2017-01-28 02:57:05 UTC <ScottyP922> That Nunes/Shevchenko rematch is gonna be nuts. #UFCDenver
825531032334135297 2017-01-28 02:28:30 UTC <ScottyP922> If I'm Amanda Nunes I'm hoping Pena wins this fight. A 5 rounder with Shevchenko is her toughest test. #UFCDenver
825530455697027073 2017-01-28 02:26:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I also think Pena won't pace herself and may be a victim to the altitude if this goes past 2 rounds.

825490907491397632 2017-01-28 23:49:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Tough return fight for Sterling.

825483690646130688 2017-01-28 23:20:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Da Silva won that fight. He butchered him from the bottom.

825480792734302209 2017-01-28 23:08:52 UTC <ScottyP922> And Conor would knock you out. The run ends there.https://twitter.com/Cody_Nolove/status/825470439988219904
825479535592402944 2017-01-28 23:03:52 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd imagine the #UFC will be stripping McGregor of the LW belt too if he's not fighting this year.
825473950411010049 2017-01-28 22:41:40 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor is having a boy.   Future King. #UFC #AnExpWith
825472161964027905 2017-01-28 22:34:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @ballsonthebar36 Not worth getting now though. Almost over I think.
825472094284689409 2017-01-28 22:34:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @ballsonthebar36 It's PPV. Here....  http://notoriouslive.co/
825471300063879169 2017-01-28 22:31:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Sounds like Conor doesn't intend to fight in the #UFC this year.   Well F my life. #AnExpWith
825459845826490372 2017-01-28 21:45:38 UTC <ScottyP922> I always thought Conor would be a better fighter if he had some self confidence. #AnExpWith

825455112177012736 2017-01-28 21:26:49 UTC <ScottyP922> It's unbelievable to have that kind of crowd and a PPV stream for a damn interview.   Only Conor. #AnExpWith
825454662413406208 2017-01-28 21:25:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Who didn't know this would start on Conor Time? #AnExpWith
825453392696844289 2017-01-28 21:19:59 UTC <ScottyP922> If Conor comes out singing the classics I want my money back. #AnExpWith
825451459571507200 2017-01-28 21:12:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Is anybody streaming this and seeing the event yet? #AnExpWith
825449190759268352 2017-01-28 21:03:17 UTC <ScottyP922> None that I know of.
825448892162572288 2017-01-28 21:02:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Well now, we love you too, Conor.

825095695233347584 2017-01-27 21:38:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @jonmachota LOL
825086682567438338 2017-01-27 21:02:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst I was a little surprised by your pick for that fight.
825082157567709185 2017-01-27 20:44:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Somehow this chat helped her win Gold in the past.   That's some King shit.
825080450167234560 2017-01-27 20:38:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @NBCSports @nbc @TheNotoriousMMA That's the same time as the interview. Us bums can't watch two things at once.

824839949753081857 2017-01-26 04:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @CarlaEsparza1 It's just a delusional temper tantrum. They are protesting a caricature that doesn't exist.
824816534400942081 2017-01-26 03:09:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @josh282828 No. Because I understand there is no chance in hell Garrett allows his OC to bench Zeke without his approval.
824806610291851265 2017-01-26 02:29:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys It will if our head coach still coaches scared and sits Zeke so much. All 3rd downs? WTF?
824802851016826881 2017-01-26 02:14:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated Maybe it's a pop-up book.

823286259632242693 2017-01-22 21:48:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Fighting and losing. Not really in a position to offer advice.
823279938774204416 2017-01-22 21:23:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Maybe he needs to take his own advice. Or maybe he needs some advice from Rousey. Get himself a win.
823277304830889985 2017-01-22 21:12:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Not sure I  understand why he should give career advice. How bout someone whose actually won after losing the belt?
823275956559286272 2017-01-22 21:07:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Until he lost then couldn't win a fight. Same as Rousey.
823267164987817984 2017-01-22 20:32:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Says the guy whose lost 4 of his last 5 fights with 1 no contest.
823264364115402752 2017-01-22 20:21:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet I don't see the point anyway. Trump supporters have to get off of work to attend. Not a fair comparison.

817578023515983873 2017-01-06 03:46:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Yeah definitely Bisping but he would probably beat my ass for saying it.
817577701531852800 2017-01-06 03:44:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoachEdmund Sometime a ruined life is a side effect of learning perfect fighting technique, Coach.
817577443116642304 2017-01-06 03:43:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Don't let them change ya, Mama E. You got a lot of love on here.
817463478394953730 2017-01-06 20:10:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Squash match.
817463308232130564 2017-01-06 20:10:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @tariqnasheed @PrisonPlanet Wait...does this mean Trump was calling whites rapists?!

817456749334630400 2017-01-06 19:44:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @joannamma Really testing our spelling here.
817455294410358784 2017-01-06 19:38:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc You guys should do an interim title fight the same night too.
817447598273560577 2017-01-06 19:07:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Look. It's the world's greatest jockey.
817447232957976576 2017-01-06 19:06:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Congrats @EzekielElliott. All Pro. Pro Bowl. Rushing title. I know he's got bigger goals but what an incredible rookie season. #WeDemBoyz
817444759308566531 2017-01-06 18:56:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @NFL @FedEx #AirandGround Elliott
817376611859308544 2017-01-06 14:25:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @FrankoSpanko737 @TheNotoriousMMA Just imagine what a thrill it was for him. Working with Royalty.
817238765441871872 2017-01-05 05:17:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Where have you gone, @TheNotoriousMMA ? The promotion turns their lonely eyes to you. Woo woo woo. #UFC #KingOfTheNumbers
817181363463929857 2017-01-05 01:29:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Like a bum? #Yeehaw
817148464559747072 2017-01-05 23:19:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @bknapp52635 @sherdogdotcom Bisping. Finally broke through after all those years.
817142567439626240 2017-01-05 22:55:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Put Conor in the 73 Belmont and Secretariat's unconscious at the quarter pole. #UFC #TripleCrown #KingOfEverything
817111265067880448 2017-01-05 20:51:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 The Cowboys have gone to the Super Bowl 8 times. All 8 teams won their last regular season game.
817111034129502211 2017-01-05 20:50:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 Great. Now he can blow off the rust in the playoffs. It's brilliant.
817100245666529280 2017-01-05 20:07:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan It's Nick Diaz who missed out on the money fight. Every fight Conor's in is the money fight.
817097763091599360 2017-01-05 19:57:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHusker But to run over and mock the coaches and run to the Internet? That's just low class. If Ronda did it the MMA world would explode
817097530643202048 2017-01-05 19:56:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHusker A lot of people don't shake hands after a fight. Including Amanda's lowlife fellow Brazilian Aldo when McGregor murked him.
817097286991937536 2017-01-05 19:55:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHusker She mocked her coaches then ran to the Internet to post memes mocking her. She's a scumbag.
817095165517164545 2017-01-05 19:47:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHusker She never did what Amanda did after that fight.
817090148064231427 2017-01-05 19:27:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @The_Geek_1986 Nunes is the typical low class Brazilian in MMA. She went right over to taunt Rousey's corner when the fight ended.
817089797252648965 2017-01-05 19:26:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @CatZingano @The_Geek_1986 Show me where Ronda taunted opponents coaches and put up internet memes mocking her after the fight.
817089530289328132 2017-01-05 19:24:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @CatZingano Cat made her quit. She can do it again too.
817089303914356736 2017-01-05 19:24:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @CatZingano So true. If Ronda acted like Amanda did after the fight she would have been killed for it.
817085869253398528 2017-01-05 19:10:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet @rebrown38 LOL. Nice talking to you. Have fun thinking a rookie QB protected behind the best run game is MVP of the league.
817083220856631296 2017-01-05 18:59:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet @rebrown38 Negative. They had Randle and McFadden. You don't get the MVP of the league because you're better than Matt Cassel.
817024244819394560 2017-01-05 15:05:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Defeat destroyed Rousey and strengthened McGregor. #UFC
817022864469688320 2017-01-05 15:00:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet I'm guessing the rest of the voters understand Prescott doesn't make that offense go. Zeke and the run game do.
816895776433602560 2017-01-04 06:35:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Dana White Wants a Fight.   Quit being a bully, Dana!
816867130104745984 2017-01-04 04:41:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamKhabib @arielhelwani @Bosslogic I don't see how Khabib wins this fight. Ariel's grappling is on another level.

816720324066758658 2017-01-04 18:57:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie @wuppiFL0W @DanWebbLC Put him in with a LW and he would.   Cody didn't make history in 2016. Champ champ. No brainer FOTY.
816691431519690755 2017-01-04 17:03:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @mookiealexander @BloodyElbow I remember when Rogan said she could beat half the male BW division.   Rousey/Lineker. UFC 212. Do it.
816690646564110336 2017-01-04 16:59:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Those Cowboys are just getting started though. Rookie QB and RB aren't supposed to be doing this.
816690391139385344 2017-01-04 16:58:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Conor's greatest moment in the UFC was how he handled his loss. Like a true Champion.
816662731935903744 2017-01-04 15:09:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Prediction - Conor wins the Triple Crown next year.
816651408825077760 2017-01-04 14:24:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet @Lauren_Southern Chris Hansen: Hello.   Perv: It's cool. I'm clovergendered.
816535491378085888 2017-01-03 06:43:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Conor hanging out with Bob Baffert?
816476612854251520 2017-01-03 02:49:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Top 5? Seems a little premature to me.
816468292705644545 2017-01-03 02:16:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi Just. Like. That?
816465864098795520 2017-01-03 02:06:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Well that's comforting. If his nurse shows up with a shaved head one day shit's about to go down.

815972014045495296 2017-01-02 17:24:22 UTC <ScottyP922> 205 did a 17.7 million $ gate. Conor's other PPV mains did an average of 8 million.  Rousey's return did 4.75  Any questions? #UFC #KingMac
815952139596001281 2017-01-02 16:05:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated The Diaz brothers do more talking than anything these days.
815930465014206465 2017-01-02 14:39:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Ronda has accomplished more in this sport than he ever will.
815794790688313344 2017-01-01 05:40:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @JoshInnesRadio You're missed here. That time slot sucks now.
815775177464225793 2017-01-01 04:22:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @EricDickerson LOL. Did they all have their head coach hold them back? The only reason why it wasn't broken. Classless tweet.
815774215798452228 2017-01-01 04:18:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @ryanhall5050 @CoachEdmund Don't do it, Ryan. You're too young to lose your teeth.

815707545515888640 2017-01-01 23:53:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCrelated There's no defending that. Amazing technique.
815676395313594368 2017-01-01 21:49:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet Congrats to the #Eagles for beating a disinterested Cowboys team of backups. Enjoy the golf.
815624920935841792 2017-01-01 18:25:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 Garrett is a gutless coward. Thank God Emmitt Smith didn't have this sissy as head coach. He wouldn't have the same career.
815593169341599744 2017-01-01 16:18:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BreitbartNews @PrisonPlanet Peacefully stabbed her.

815406797733429248 2016-12-31 03:58:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Geofrito I think it's possible but then his son ripped the UFC for not doing some sort of tribute. I don't know. He deserved one though.

815341098201743364 2016-12-31 23:37:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh I see you are dining with Kings.   Nice.
815335114402107392 2016-12-31 23:13:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @CoachEdmund  If she would have just moved her head like Coach said she'd be champion now.
815268996002025473 2016-12-31 18:50:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @kolegoldberg I said the same thing. It won't be the same without your Dad.

815213980419493888 2016-12-31 15:12:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Taunted her team after the fight. Even went outside the Octagon to do it.

815085615012319238 2016-12-30 06:42:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Amanda's actions after the fight will be ignored by the MMA media but it really shows her lack of any class. She's a female Aldo. #UFC207
815084610451292160 2016-12-30 06:38:09 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Dillashaw beats Garbrandt. #UFC207
815084249229512704 2016-12-30 06:36:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChuckMindenhall Typical Brazilian class. One day everyone will acknowledge it.

815079439851778048 2016-12-30 06:17:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti Remember when you geniuses pretended Cyborg was clean?
815078321209884673 2016-12-30 06:13:09 UTC <ScottyP922> If I was in Ronda's camp I'd keep a very close eye on her. I'm not even joking. #UFC207

815024916860981248 2016-12-30 02:40:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Take a look at those two. Now think Hendricks plans on going up to 185. He'll be getting mauled. #UFC207

815023861444071424 2016-12-30 02:36:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Acted really odd in the media scrum. As a fan, I hated to see it.
815023550356656129 2016-12-30 02:35:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @tstless It wasn't long ago he was at the top of that division.
815022392460378112 2016-12-30 02:30:55 UTC <ScottyP922> And, sadly, we may be watching Hendricks' last fight here. #UFC207

815017657409867776 2016-12-30 02:12:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Shoeface is really exploiting the holes in Vettori's eye poke game. #UFC207
815016897976696832 2016-12-30 02:09:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Fight of the year. #UFC207

815003699965726720 2016-12-30 01:16:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Conor didn't even grapple to get his. He must be the best brown belt on Earth. #UFC207
814999718988234752 2016-12-30 01:00:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Next fight....  ~Means karate kid kicks opponent in the jewels~  ~ref stops it~  Means: WTF!! There's no way that's illegal!! #UFC207

814998685625024514 2016-12-30 00:56:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach, ask Conor to make that legal. #RunningTheGame
814998179389247488 2016-12-30 00:54:42 UTC <ScottyP922> I always thought a knee down is grounded but then when the VP of the UFC tells you differently you kind of assume he's right. #UFC207
814997448426983424 2016-12-30 00:51:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Robbed of a good fight. Means had him. #UFC207
814997334501232640 2016-12-30 00:51:21 UTC <ScottyP922> So basically the VP of the UFC doesn't know what the F he's talking about. #UFC207
814996799513575424 2016-12-30 00:49:13 UTC <ScottyP922> But I do think the Brazilian's milking it. #UFC207

814975115188457472 2016-12-30 23:23:03 UTC <ScottyP922> So touching seeing Dana hugging Rousey and telling her he loves her.  Special rules for his loved ones, I suppose.  #UFC207
814972349309128705 2016-12-30 23:12:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @sjw_nonsense I can think of at least three abortions I would have been in favor of.

814943462248349696 2016-12-30 21:17:16 UTC <ScottyP922> Watching Dillashaw and Cruz fight on the same card is going to be like trying to read in the car. #UFC207 #Riverdance
814943008995020801 2016-12-30 21:15:28 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm thinking Garbrandt isn't ready for this but man is he one shot away from ending this fight. Can't count him out. #UFC207
814942497885536256 2016-12-30 21:13:27 UTC <ScottyP922> If I would've said in Oct 2015 that Nunes beats Rousey you'd have laughed.  Y'all must have forgot. She might remind you tonight. #UFC207
814935956000219136 2016-12-30 20:47:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @UFCrelated The biggest lie @danawhite has ever told is that Ronda is the biggest star in the sport.

814694711881506816 2016-12-29 04:48:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz and Garbrandt have made #UFC207 a must watch for me. Don't really care about the main event.

814630805087645698 2016-12-29 00:34:53 UTC <ScottyP922> With a year of prep with @CoachEdmund I'm expecting Nunes corner to throw in the towel when they see such next level striking. #UFC207
814597989415157760 2016-12-29 22:24:29 UTC <ScottyP922> As much of a complete B Rousey is being I still have to root for her to beat Nunes. #UFC207

814563073222709248 2016-12-29 20:05:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @arielhelwani That would be an interesting fight.

814527057325592576 2016-12-29 17:42:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani got a beautiful singing voice. Has me tearing up over here. #UFC207
814525276193431552 2016-12-29 17:35:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Listening to @arielhelwani doing play by play of the weigh ins, he's got a career as a golf announcer if he wants it. #UFC207
814523604197117952 2016-12-29 17:28:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Smolka looks out of it on the scales. Brutal weight cut. #UFC207

811945299178639360 2016-12-22 14:43:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Luke says she isn't doing the press conference. Apparently that rule is only for Conor.
811795363778727936 2016-12-21 04:47:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @JoshInnesRadio Greatest thing you ever did in Philly.

811752225211027456 2016-12-21 01:56:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor wins LW title a month ago. Wants to take break over the holidays as one of the most active fighters in the game.   INTERIM BELT!! #UFC
811749230536720384 2016-12-21 01:44:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani An interim belt just because.
811694903801614336 2016-12-21 22:08:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That's because you were knocked out the entire time, Hosay. You should have seen the post fight interview, bro.

811437400014589952 2016-12-20 05:05:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Has to be Khabib if the father declined. Only fighter that makes sense.

811248975617597440 2016-12-20 16:36:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig @Buffburgh It was so weak. So is only talking to Ellen and Conan. Her actions after the loss were worse to her rep than the KO.
811225126679220225 2016-12-20 15:01:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig Yeah I lost of lot of respect for her with the way she handled the loss. Didn't expect it from an Olympian whose lost before.

810314038185955329 2016-12-17 02:41:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah I'll pretty much hate Gall now. Can't wait to see him get tuned up. #UFCSacramento
810313298520473600 2016-12-17 02:38:39 UTC <ScottyP922> It's a shame Sage has no takedown defense. He'd finish Gall on the feet. #UFCSacramento

810297303374462976 2016-12-17 01:35:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @free_bunny86 Jouban/Perry fight just ended. Looks like Jouban won it by decision. Conor is still King though.
810295702714798081 2016-12-17 01:28:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I feel like each fighter stole a round.

810294122649153536 2016-12-17 01:22:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow So Perry stole the round?
810289584458371072 2016-12-17 01:04:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I think everybody's hoping for Jouban but expecting Perry to catch him with a fight ender. #UFCSacramento

810287188533542912 2016-12-17 00:54:54 UTC <ScottyP922> A lot of nervous ladies with pretty boy Jouban getting in there with Perry.   Somebody's getting slept. #UFCSacramento

810281424024694786 2016-12-17 00:32:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Impressive win for Hirota. Miller was as sharp as I've ever seen him and he just got dominated. #UFCSacramento

810257560590761985 2016-12-17 22:57:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Little action in this fight so far. Hopefully it picks up in round 3. #UFCSacramento
810253368761454592 2016-12-17 22:40:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Definitely better for the east coast.

810237503282311169 2016-12-17 21:37:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This is why I picked against Miller later the card. Don't know how much he cares anymore.

809609050602225665 2016-12-15 04:00:14 UTC <ScottyP922> His retirement fight and he's on before Paige, Sage and Gall.   You feeling the UFC love, @UrijahFaber ? #UFCSacramento #UFConFox22
809573520867028992 2016-12-15 01:39:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @PaigeVanzantUFC @sagenorthcutt I think I'll go for a walk outside now. The summertime's calling my name. So hear me now....
809572884695973888 2016-12-15 01:36:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MMAFighting "Being from Cleveland is exhausting."  "OH! HE'S HURT!"  "Just like that! PVZ is the new UFC HW Champion!"
809497944273670144 2016-12-15 20:38:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti @MMAFighting Wasn't Conor fined more? The guy who didn't initiate the incident?
809497804372668416 2016-12-15 20:38:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott @dallascowboys Not when our genius coaching staff sits him on 3rd down for a roster filler.
809497027050700800 2016-12-15 20:35:05 UTC <ScottyP922> In the face of defeat, Conor proved he's a true champion while Rousey ran and hid.   F this bitch. #UFC207https://twitter.com/MMAFighting/status/809488224255148032
809437534220677121 2016-12-15 16:38:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @JennaLeeUSA congratulates lawyer for getting obviously guilty Dalia Dippolito off on a mistrial simply because she's a woman.
809429100314116097 2016-12-15 16:05:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Stop trying to protect cheating Brazilians who only want to fight there on their terms.
809428923213869061 2016-12-15 16:04:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Why is it 60 days notice? That report came out over a week ago and those talks could have happened weeks before.
809388242168664064 2016-12-15 13:22:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow Khabib does have a padded record. Doesn't mean he's not legit though.
809243847712710656 2016-12-14 03:49:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Shows up halfway thru debates, dances on stage in a mink, doesn't give a fook about the issues. Everybody votes for him.
809127803195113472 2016-12-14 20:07:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow No need for courts. Just give Pettis 5 minutes alone with each of them with a get out of jail free card.
809124871397605377 2016-12-14 19:56:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite @UFCONFOX I'd bet on maybe his driveway at like 177ish.
809114926522527745 2016-12-14 19:16:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think Ronda KOs Cyborg if she can avoid the arm bar.
809057816883367937 2016-12-14 15:29:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti @MMAFighting He wanted that fight but now someone else fighting him might cheapen the sport? Spare me.
808889382463827968 2016-12-13 04:20:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow So she wants to pick the opponent, the weight, the date and the location.   That isn't suspicious at all.
808888820200574976 2016-12-13 04:18:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Waiting for the #UFC to announce Miesha Tate vs Jessica Eye for the new 155 strap.
808885077279129601 2016-12-13 04:03:25 UTC <ScottyP922> LOL. Ok.
808884684407050240 2016-12-13 04:01:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet Basically it's a fraud title fight. Let's be real.
808884483617394688 2016-12-13 04:01:03 UTC <ScottyP922> I asked who has lost two straight and gone up in weight to fight for the title.
808884185536614400 2016-12-13 03:59:52 UTC <ScottyP922> What they wanted is irrelevant. Rousey/Zingano was already booked. Cyborg/GDR wasn't.
808883191356518400 2016-12-13 03:55:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet Yeah that's dropping down. I said move up.
808882896740188160 2016-12-13 03:54:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet Not really true. TUF was already booked with Rousey. They had to find a replacement. This fight wasn't already booked.
808882114292752384 2016-12-13 03:51:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet I'd like to see a list of fighters who lost back to back and then moved up for an immediate title shot.
808881530089177089 2016-12-13 03:49:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet And she was an injury replacement for the girl who beat her.
808881402070626305 2016-12-13 03:48:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet 1 loss and there was a storyline there that made it interesting.
808880090536873984 2016-12-13 03:43:36 UTC <ScottyP922> A Flyweight division for the women makes more sense right now than Featherweight. #UFC
808879463635288064 2016-12-13 03:41:07 UTC <ScottyP922> What's that? You just lost to Tate and Shevchenko at 135? Well how'd you like to fight for the 145 lb title? #UFC #WTFDana
808861269352714240 2016-12-13 02:28:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow @_AaronOBrien Belfort has like half a round in him. A couple of flurries of activity and he's done.
808856178025435136 2016-12-13 02:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor effect. Dana, has made that division irrelevant again.   Going to have to bury Aldo/Max on an undercard or the PPV will tank. #UFChttps://twitter.com/MMAFighting/status/808854032429305858
808855651367665665 2016-12-13 02:06:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow @_AaronOBrien Bro. C'mon, bro.
808840883227521024 2016-12-13 01:07:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Remember when Khabib said if he didn't fight for the title next he would never fight in the #UFC again?   Good times, comrade.
808840357597290496 2016-12-13 01:05:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow Does anyone think this is a competitive fight?
808839859922157568 2016-12-13 01:03:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Khabib and Tony are arguing over terms.   Here's the terms. You two fight. The winner gets beheaded.   Any other questions? #UFC #KingMac

807970830714073092 2016-12-11 15:30:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Neither fight was remotely competitive. Give me Khabib, Ferguson, Woodley for McGregor.
807969407809048576 2016-12-11 15:24:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The actual question is -  which man do you want to see beaten again? Let those two contenders fight to determine it.
807961956409806848 2016-12-11 14:55:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @espn @AdamSchefter Could we just play football on football fields and leave all the charity off the field?

807917750039539714 2016-12-11 11:59:36 UTC <ScottyP922> LOL @ the Holloway hype.   If he meets the King again he'll get schooled again. None of them are on his level. #UFC206 #ChampChamp #KingMac
807767992897597442 2016-12-10 02:04:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow One other thing, Zane. Full camp Lando takes out firm footed Ferguson.
807767439337517057 2016-12-10 02:02:19 UTC <ScottyP922> "Vivian, were you surprised by anything in there?"  Not one bit. They're not on my level. You have to bring some attributes. #UFC206
807766529941143552 2016-12-10 01:58:42 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow... don't agree with that decision but not enough to care that much. #UFC206
807765459504365568 2016-12-10 01:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Does it seem to you like Letourneau has a habit of fighting to the level of her competition?
807763595656359936 2016-12-10 01:47:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Letourneau goes with a full shirt after her Reebok fiasco last fight. #UFC206

807747903888523264 2016-12-10 00:44:42 UTC <ScottyP922> My advice to Vanatta, get the fook out of the lightweight division. #UFC206 #KingMac
807747552208650241 2016-12-10 00:43:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Vanatta's a serious talent. #UFC206

807583798267412480 2016-12-10 13:52:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Practically nobody is taking Pettis tonight. Against a FW contender.   How far he has fallen in the eyes of fight fans. #UFC206
807582715524616192 2016-12-10 13:48:18 UTC <ScottyP922> I agree with @danawhite @joerogan is the best to ever call a fight. #UFC
807422277595922434 2016-12-09 03:10:46 UTC <ScottyP922> If you had Ngannou by sub, you deserve a UFC interim belt. #UFCAlbany

807418158848032768 2016-12-09 02:54:24 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd like to thank Jesus for helping me kick the shit out of this guy. #UFCAlbany

807346846683242499 2016-12-09 22:11:02 UTC <ScottyP922> We've got a FW title fight where only 1 guy has any chance to walk out with the belt.   It's like a McGregor title defense. #UFC206
807339324513677312 2016-12-09 21:41:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBurtonXP Michael, he'll agree to watch if you agree not to look directly into the camera.

807336723478966274 2016-12-09 21:30:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti @MMAFighting Why not 125 first? More talent. Strawweight is much deeper than Bantamweight for a reason.
807336109336367104 2016-12-09 21:28:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter How do they replace that production?

807301944305971202 2016-12-09 19:12:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BlessedMMA Max is a good dude.
807285580010815492 2016-12-09 18:07:35 UTC <ScottyP922> So if Pettis wins this fight he becomes the interim 148lb. champion. #UFC206
807263873795559424 2016-12-09 16:41:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh This is coach's version of "you'll do fookin nuttin!".
807263641280118784 2016-12-09 16:40:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Thebeast_ufc @ufc Dana's ego. If it can make the weight.
807263186252627968 2016-12-09 16:38:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @NathanMacD83 And like God in the cage.   But the FW division agrees with you. He should never return. For their chin's sake.
807255905045803008 2016-12-09 16:09:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet @tstless Recounts in only states Trump won, death threats to electors. They aren't interested in democracy.
807255275422044163 2016-12-09 16:07:10 UTC <ScottyP922> I would normally get this PPV but my first loyalty is to McGregor. I will not spend a dollar on a farce. #ufc206
807253849417322498 2016-12-09 16:01:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Re-airing the main event of 205 would do a better PPV number. #UFC206
807253546165030912 2016-12-09 16:00:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Maybe it's all those extra tools Pettis has that caused him to miss weight. #UFC206
807253274290192384 2016-12-09 15:59:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN Might as well. The whole deal is a fraud anyway. Fake belt to fight the fake champion.
807248571615608833 2016-12-09 15:40:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Seems like a vague assassination threat to me.   That lady should be reported.
807245892315189248 2016-12-09 15:29:53 UTC <ScottyP922> I can hear a very familiar cackle coming in the direction of Ireland. #UFC206
807244978724474880 2016-12-09 15:26:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Can't do an interim belt with a fighter who missed weight.
807242246412189696 2016-12-09 15:15:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Title fight?
807240215274274816 2016-12-09 15:07:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I can't even imagine going through that brutal weight cut and then fighting the next day.
807203272960409600 2016-12-09 12:40:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Could you repeat that, Coach?
807077568302157824 2016-12-08 04:21:01 UTC <ScottyP922> "You can't live off sponsor money and put rest in bank?"  Can't Dana give up some of his half billion so fighters are paid fairly? #UFC
807076902838173696 2016-12-08 04:18:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial How arrogant. His comments don't take into account percent of revenue paid out. That percentage is not near other sports.
807062720453496832 2016-12-08 03:22:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Except humans, apparently.
807016646955175936 2016-12-08 00:18:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, Cub...remember when you thought you could beat him and how he'd never be a champion? Good times.https://twitter.com/MMAjunkie/status/807015824632451072
807006427051126784 2016-12-08 23:38:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Props to @TheZaneSimon and @BoxingBusch for putting in a whopping 3 hours on the Vivi this week. Your analysis adds to the fights, gentlemen
806969701435932672 2016-12-08 21:12:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite @bjpenndotcom Uh, yeah you did. He didn't strip himself.
806969030192099328 2016-12-08 21:09:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie What the hell. DC's got abs in that pic!
806950553918050304 2016-12-08 19:56:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Id love to see what Ariel would do if Montreal ever got an NBA franchise. NYK/Montreal in playoffs. Where does his heart lie?
806949607083311104 2016-12-08 19:52:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @go2sleepho @arielhelwani He loves his country and is proud of where he comes from. Nothing to see here.
806947919802859520 2016-12-08 19:45:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange Because nothing sells war bonds like crossdressing.
806947118669791232 2016-12-08 19:42:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Ok I'm a Matt Brown fan now.
806932958846324737 2016-12-08 18:46:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Fitting that he's wearing silver. We all know who owns the gold. #UFC #KingMachttps://twitter.com/MrMWellsArt/status/806931121565036544
806929820646940673 2016-12-08 18:33:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Give him the role of God and it should come natural to him. #UFC #GodMachttps://twitter.com/WiCnet/status/806889591240331264
806925474857385985 2016-12-08 18:16:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Yes. Does Conor like cream with his coffee?  #YEEHAW #KingMac #ChampChamphttps://twitter.com/ufc/status/806910442400612352
806924067718758401 2016-12-08 18:11:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma That girl looks just like this girl from the UFC who is the best, you know?
806923203360727040 2016-12-08 18:07:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Tell that to Eddie's chin. #UFChttps://twitter.com/ConormcGregor5/status/806920172019847168
806922775764070400 2016-12-08 18:05:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial I think they've talked less about Jesus coming back.   Do you want to fight or don't you? #UFC
806922348981088260 2016-12-08 18:04:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow There are levels to this. This isn't Invicta. Andrade by aggravated assault.
806921691154841600 2016-12-08 18:01:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Pettis gets bullied in the cage. McGregor is the biggest bully. It would not be a good night for that man. #UFC
806921084041920512 2016-12-08 17:59:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @DannySeguraTV @MMAFighting I wouldn't call it a robbery but I thought he won 2 rounds and the point shouldn't have been taken away.
806918862222594048 2016-12-08 17:50:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @chaseelliott This one's my favorite. Awesome looking race car.
806875136922161152 2016-12-08 14:56:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Child abuse.
806722948480385024 2016-12-07 04:51:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @seanhannity Not if he wants to be re-elected.
806717663330373632 2016-12-07 04:30:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @CoreyA_MMA 26/9. Do it.
806708937294835713 2016-12-07 03:56:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @JasonWitten @dallascowboys Does he hand out gifts between his legs and behind him by any chance?
806669626922926080 2016-12-07 01:20:00 UTC <ScottyP922> In other news, #UFC to have a down 2017.https://twitter.com/sherdogdotcom/status/806668369181163532
806663702996992004 2016-12-07 00:56:28 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah because technically he was f'n slept in seconds by the real champ.   Make that the champ champ.  Soon to be the champ champ champ. #UFChttps://twitter.com/MMAFighting/status/806641989135585284

806628968845705216 2016-12-07 22:38:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Brazilian class.   Hosay, our King destroyed your reputation worse than he did your chin. #UFChttps://twitter.com/BloodyElbow/status/806619313964797953
806516166885838850 2016-12-07 15:10:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott EZE!...MVP!  Go get that division title. #WeDemBoyz
806515616702222336 2016-12-07 15:08:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet It is just so idiotic.
806353806799863808 2016-12-06 04:25:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I'd rather see a 125 division. More talent to fill it.
806334745948942337 2016-12-06 03:09:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @bjpenndotcom With the point taken away I scored it a draw but the point shouldn't have been taken away.
806275811682713600 2016-12-06 23:15:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @chaseelliott Nice helmets display, Chase.
806212269310967812 2016-12-06 19:02:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @Muffin_of_Stud Nothing gets me hyped than a fight for a fake belt to earn the right to take on the fake champion .   Cue Face The Pain
806210759969636352 2016-12-06 18:56:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Give me the Conor McGregors of the sport. Anyone, any weight, any time. #UFChttps://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/806210014088167424
806210317554483202 2016-12-06 18:54:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @ReidCockburn @Robbie_gr True. Other than heavyweight.
806209414487228416 2016-12-06 18:51:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCUnfiltered admitted McGregor haters. Don't waste your time with the podcast.   Maybe we can mail Eddie's head to the studio. #UFC
806208610346921984 2016-12-06 18:48:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Did you ever notice how these Brazilians always want to fight in Brazil?   There's a reason. #UFChttps://twitter.com/criscyborg/status/806199532996284417
806208064563122177 2016-12-06 18:45:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @ReidCockburn Dana says she's already at 135 lbs. I've never heard of a fighter being on weight weeks before the fight.
806184188143607808 2016-12-06 17:11:03 UTC <ScottyP922> How many ligaments would Conor McGregor need to tear before you can beat him?https://twitter.com/ufc/status/806177550703718400
806170723412824065 2016-12-06 16:17:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @criscyborg @arielhelwani @guicruzzz @Sunkist1207 I did read it.
806166318911254530 2016-12-06 16:00:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @guicruzzz So all this whining about poor Cyborg she needs her own division and it turns out she declined the chance twice.
806165618688983044 2016-12-06 15:57:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Is this a good thing?
805914243640004608 2016-12-05 23:18:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @sjw_nonsense The first thing we do is use the proper contraction "they're".
805882709318975488 2016-12-05 21:13:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jordan_Patu The ruckus is we have eyeballs and Joe didn't win 3 rounds.
805879486092865536 2016-12-05 21:00:16 UTC <ScottyP922> Dana called Cejudo after the fight to apologize for the judging.   Damn right. 30-26? Was Megan Olivi judging? #UFC #TUFFinale
805863748967735301 2016-12-05 19:57:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @dillondanis is the man. Can't wait to see his MMA debut. More gold on the way for the A Team. #UFC #BJJKing
805862929891475457 2016-12-05 19:54:29 UTC <ScottyP922> I honestly think I could take my first fight in the #UFC and I know I would dominate. - @dillondanis #TheMMAHour #BJJKing

805774229924880385 2016-12-05 14:02:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MMAFighting Could we add a stipulation that McGregor has to fight with two torn ACLs to make it more competitive?
805572561274859524 2016-12-04 00:40:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @RapSheet Well thank you, Redskins. Those guys are always so thoughtful.

805558002694651904 2016-12-04 23:42:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @realDonaldTrump It's good to have a President who thinks America first again.
805454409715089409 2016-12-04 16:51:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Who will win the fake belt to fight for the fake belt?  Oh the suspense!!  #UFC206 #KingFnMac #RealChamphttps://twitter.com/ufc/status/805452879561572352
805305329525358594 2016-12-03 06:58:47 UTC <ScottyP922> We are blessed to watch @MightyMouseUFC #TUFFinale
805299041827483649 2016-12-03 06:33:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow Zane, if you don't say Cejudo got robbed in the 6th round I'm canceling fight pass.
805297817577254912 2016-12-03 06:28:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I felt like both those guys mailed that in. A little effort next time. #TUFFinale
805285903908401152 2016-12-03 05:41:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Total horseshit. He won that fight like Hosay's the real FW champion. #TUFFinale
805285155678154752 2016-12-03 05:38:37 UTC <ScottyP922> 28-28. Cejudo robbed of a victory by a bullshit point deduction. #TUFFinale
805283607942197248 2016-12-03 05:32:28 UTC <ScottyP922> 19-18 Cejudo. Close though. #TUFFinale

805281219915223040 2016-12-03 05:22:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Bullshit. #TUFFinale
805278112128831488 2016-12-03 05:10:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial Gotta go with McGregor.
805277804925517824 2016-12-03 05:09:24 UTC <ScottyP922> If I'm Cejudo I'm doing nothing but wrestling here. Takedown, control, let up. Repeat. #TUFFinale
805276938751315968 2016-12-03 05:05:58 UTC <ScottyP922> I dont understand why you cant call time out, release his foot and re-start the fight. If its not the rule, change the f'n rule. #TUFFinale
805275427346518016 2016-12-03 04:59:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I didn't hear you or Connor talk about Masvidal's toe trapping game. C'mon, bro.
805274818396483584 2016-12-03 04:57:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Textbook finish by Masvidal. #TUFFinale
805265557171924992 2016-12-03 04:20:44 UTC <ScottyP922> This is great. #TUFFinale
805265335570067456 2016-12-03 04:19:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @NewYorkRic Yeah I didn't think that one through.
805265035366907904 2016-12-03 04:18:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Shorter than @NewYorkRic stint hosting the MMA Hour.
805264094618075136 2016-12-03 04:14:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst Why are your tweets showing up with a Luke Thomas chat link?
805262615236775936 2016-12-03 04:09:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @ioncutelaba @ufc Why is he angry at weigh ins but not in fights? I'd address that if I trained him. #TUFFinale
805262075874471936 2016-12-03 04:06:54 UTC <ScottyP922> I dont care what promo you cut @ufc @danawhite your new FW champ is a fraud. We all know better. They're fighting for #2. #TUFFinale
805258878610968580 2016-12-03 03:54:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow She lost that round from top position, IMO.
805255949887959040 2016-12-03 03:42:34 UTC <ScottyP922> So Felice Herrig gets Alexa Grasso next.   Good luck with that. #TUFFinale
805255314174001153 2016-12-03 03:40:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I took McMann too but I already regret it. She is so not reliable.
805254910254125056 2016-12-03 03:38:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I was thinking the same. Clear win for Moreno.
805253325683822593 2016-12-03 03:32:08 UTC <ScottyP922> No but I've considered it.
805251241353814016 2016-12-03 03:23:51 UTC <ScottyP922> I mean Benavidez/Cejudo
805250360596119552 2016-12-03 03:20:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Who you got in the co-main, my friend?
805250156484554752 2016-12-03 03:19:32 UTC <ScottyP922> If Ronda would have lost in thumb wrestling would she have given up commercials for awhile? Come back to do one but not talk? #TUFFinale
805247940260462592 2016-12-03 03:10:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Maynard: How did I lose that fight?! I dropped him like 75 times. #TUFFinale

805245679538962433 2016-12-03 03:01:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Moreno by sub. Something about that kid.
805245199320514560 2016-12-03 02:59:50 UTC <ScottyP922> At least Rogan doesn't call Hall fights.   HE'S HURT!... wait, no.....OH HE'S HURT!.....wait.....HURT THIS TIME!!...no, shit. #TUFFinale

805243587780820992 2016-12-03 02:53:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @brown_shela Agreed.
805242754351726593 2016-12-03 02:50:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Can we start a petition to get Ryan Hall out of the UFC? #TUFFinale
805242439254601729 2016-12-03 02:48:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Maynard's going to punch himself out at this rate. #TUFFinale
805241114932498432 2016-12-03 02:43:37 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Ryan Hall is ready to headline a PPV. #TUFFinale
805239820566036480 2016-12-03 02:38:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I fought Ryan Hall once. Let's just say he spent the entire fight on the ground.
805234100332363776 2016-12-03 02:15:44 UTC <ScottyP922> I actually thought that fight would be competitive.   What the hell do I know about MMA? I mean other than Conor is King. #TUFFinale
805233707296686080 2016-12-03 02:14:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow It was big brother/little brother in there.
805231608424988673 2016-12-03 02:05:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow But can't Schnell steal rounds because of that low output?
805230884483956736 2016-12-03 02:02:57 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm pulling for Cejudo tonight. Anyone who gets to go home to @MeganOlivi has had enough good fortune for one lifetime. #TUFFinale
805224498932961280 2016-12-03 01:37:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet They demand you recognize them, Paul.
805222996277415943 2016-12-03 01:31:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow True or false? If the fight occurred a year from now you'd pick Cejudo over Joe.
805222117734318080 2016-12-03 01:28:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Curran won that 3rd round but whatever.
805221704121384960 2016-12-03 01:26:29 UTC <ScottyP922> 30-27 on all 3 cards? That's some bullshit. #TUFFinale
805221495941242880 2016-12-03 01:25:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Great fight. The ladies always bring it. #TUFFinale
805221175840407552 2016-12-03 01:24:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I have to stop picking Curran. Burns me every time. #TUFFinale
805220982587854848 2016-12-03 01:23:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Curran is such a frustrating fighter to watch. There's more there IMO.
805219777459392512 2016-12-03 01:18:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @CoachEdmund Beautiful work by Curran there.

805207179582205952 2016-12-03 00:28:46 UTC <ScottyP922> That needed to be 5 rounds. #TUFFinale

805200738473353216 2016-12-03 00:03:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @XavierRhodes29_ @DezBryant @dallascowboys You'd look good in a Cowboys uniform, Mr. Rhodes. I'm just saying. Free agency.

804878894629273600 2016-12-02 02:44:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Tell us again @danawhite how Conor decided to drop the 145 strap. #UFChttps://twitter.com/arielhelwani/status/804874228919111680
804878227823071232 2016-12-02 02:41:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay was KO'd. Eddie was KO'd. You're looking at the two weight world champion and that's it. - @TheNotoriousMMA #UFC

804675258041171968 2016-12-02 13:15:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This was my way of making the FW division irrelevant again.

803650561975451648 2016-11-29 17:23:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Notice Dana stripped Conor while he was overseas. He thinks the Atlantic will save him.   Collect that ugly bald head, King. #UFC

803624086437961728 2016-11-29 15:38:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial By making an executive decision to replace their biggest draw with a terrible one at 145 champion.   Good move, @danawhite
803619656602791938 2016-11-29 15:20:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Can they play a laugh track when Bruce Buffer announces Hosay as the undisputed champion in his next fight? #UFC

802522961454436352 2016-11-26 14:42:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Apparently they give it to the guy he slept in 13 seconds or the guy he dominated on one leg.
802508785726017540 2016-11-26 13:46:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @Maclifeofficial They should just rename the sport after him.  What do you want to do with your life? I want to be a pro McGregor fighter.

801425579501359104 2016-11-23 14:02:02 UTC <ScottyP922> If he didnt see the boxing skills gap in favor of Conor in the Diaz fights maybe @BrendanSchaub is the one who doesn't know the sport. #UFC

800749754749747200 2016-11-21 17:16:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani McGregor. He's taken the sport to new levels that will benefit all fighters in the future.
800729685277769728 2016-11-21 15:56:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MoveTheSticks Wentz has the best skill set and I'm a Cowboys fan. Give him this supporting cast on offense and he'd be lighting it up.

797782629621891073 2016-11-13 12:46:15 UTC <ScottyP922> The amazing part of how Conor's bounced back from his defeat in the Octagon is he's done it all without going on Ellen. #UFC205
797782174623789056 2016-11-13 12:44:27 UTC <ScottyP922> "The illusion of greatness is over."  Fighting Conor you probably have no shot. If you don't respect him, you really have no shot. #UFC205

797646666635640833 2016-11-12 03:45:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Somebody tell the UFC it's 2016. Nobody gives a shit about Madonna. #UFC205

797628446826500096 2016-11-12 02:33:35 UTC <ScottyP922> This fight is 3 rounds in the UFCs FW division. Introducing 1st, FIGHTING in the red corner...who da fook is that? ~checking notes~ #ufc205
797627302003822592 2016-11-12 02:29:02 UTC <ScottyP922> The highly intelligent Khabib is tired of the FW champion not giving him a LW title shot.   Russian logic.   #ufc205
797626220099801088 2016-11-12 02:24:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Khabib can go F himself. Nobody cares. #ufc205

797591026215096321 2016-11-12 00:04:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Is it weird that the first fight ever in NYC and MSG is on fight pass? #ufc205
797590727639334912 2016-11-12 00:03:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Chookagian via work rate decision. Hard to say though. Haven't seen Carmouche in quite awhile.

786298829758803968 2016-10-12 20:13:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria She's dangerous though with her striking. Ronda can't stand with her too long, IMO.
786298722837606401 2016-10-12 20:13:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria Agreed. If she had to get her belt back from Holly I wouldn't like her chances. Nunes is a favorable match up.

783286761376055296 2016-10-04 12:44:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Yes, as long as you don't go by the numbers.  As @arielhelwani said, it's not even close anymore. He's got all the records.https://twitter.com/BloodyElbow/status/783283052579618816

783127667134631940 2016-10-03 02:12:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Edward was asked by Ariel today for his prediction for the fight.  ""Anything can happen in a fight."  He's oozing with confidence. #UFC205
783120751239032832 2016-10-03 01:45:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Somebody ask @danawhite why he continues to perpetuate this lie that Rousey's the biggest star.   It's not even close and he knows it. #UFC

782439102373359617 2016-10-01 04:36:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I want Dodson to win because he's such a cerebral fighter who's always thinking 2 or 3 steps ahead. #YeahIWatchTheVivi
782437527428931584 2016-10-01 04:30:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Well, my picks for this card were an abortion. #UFCPortland

782366149891780608 2016-10-01 23:46:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Kelly should grab the mic and be like " they can't have me win....I'm too real for this shit." #UFCPortland
782362126266621952 2016-10-01 23:30:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @Bruce14Bruce LOL. Yep. Conor should buy that joint and use it as storage for his belts.
782361560748556289 2016-10-01 23:28:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow By the looks of the poll I don't think any of us know what to expect with these two.
782360273986412544 2016-10-01 23:23:19 UTC <ScottyP922> The ladies kick us off. Always root against the Brazilian. They're probably all friends with Aldo. Let's go, Kelly. #UFCPortland
782336311025860608 2016-10-01 21:48:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Then he lied at the press conference. Said he'd decide who he'd destroy next holding both belts.

780933373837672448 2016-09-27 00:53:20 UTC <ScottyP922> That Edgar/DaFookIsDat fight could be the people's main event. #UFC205
780928447052849152 2016-09-27 00:33:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @savagestatus08 I think somewhere over the course of his career Aldo lost his love for the sport.
780928132333338628 2016-09-27 00:32:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @savagestatus08 I would never claim he isn't an all time great.
780927992050556928 2016-09-27 00:31:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @savagestatus08 I mean, what would we be missing exactly? His 1 fight a year? His gift of gab on the mic?
780927686847758336 2016-09-27 00:30:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @savagestatus08 "Destroy" - winning decisions.   Aldo's had a great career but he has barely fought for years and doesn't have the hunger
780926755187986432 2016-09-27 00:27:02 UTC <ScottyP922> The MMA media has their own love affair with Aldo. Give me the fighters who truly love to fight. I won't miss him.https://twitter.com/mookiealexander/status/780922407691444228
780926153519267840 2016-09-27 00:24:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Whatever sport that is I bet Conor's better at it.https://twitter.com/shaunalshatti/status/780922021488099329
780924746972135424 2016-09-27 00:19:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @shaunalshatti @justinfinck Yes he did. Mystic Mac strikes again.
780923752150339584 2016-09-27 00:15:06 UTC <ScottyP922> If Dana has a sense of humor he will tell Aldo that he needs to send a request for release form to Conor. #UFC205
780923109016760321 2016-09-27 00:12:32 UTC <ScottyP922> That's what I was thinking. If any card can do it this is the one.https://twitter.com/RhysCota/status/767234123471593472
780922557092491264 2016-09-27 00:10:21 UTC <ScottyP922> He should retire. That rematch won't help him. Walk away. Run your restaurant. He doesn't really want to fight anymore.https://twitter.com/guicruzzz/status/780920705013649408
780921914898481152 2016-09-27 00:07:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Could you imagine an Ali/McGregor lead up to the fight? #UFC205
780920388675076096 2016-09-27 00:01:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Somebody should tell Aldo that if he leaves the #UFC  he won't have the chance to run Conor over like a truck with no brakes though.
780919997501677568 2016-09-27 00:00:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Also says he just now realized Conor runs the #UFC and he doesn't want to be his employee.   Somebody must have knocked some sense into him.
780911764561100800 2016-09-27 23:27:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay wants out of the UFC because of this #UFC205 main event.   LOL....he's not a fighter. He used to be. Not anymore.
780910373826392065 2016-09-27 23:21:56 UTC <ScottyP922> "Honey, wheres my good suit? No, the one I wear when I totally embarrass myself? Have you seen it?" - Jeremy Stephens, this morning. #UFC205
780906460519682048 2016-09-27 23:06:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Did Jeremy Stephens remember to pick up his dignity before he left the stage? #UFC205 #WhoTheFookIsHe
780905482718367744 2016-09-27 23:02:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Very, very few can handle the mental warfare McGregor brings. Eddie Alvarez is not one of those people. He's already unconscious. #UFC205
780903897632239617 2016-09-27 22:56:12 UTC <ScottyP922> Stephens has no shot against Edgar. #UFC205
780903286669008896 2016-09-27 22:53:46 UTC <ScottyP922> "Who the fook is that guy?!"   I mean.....the man makes me question my own sexuality. #UFC205
780899700090212352 2016-09-27 22:39:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Eddie is already broken mentally. Wait until the week of the fight. #UFC205
780889207371890688 2016-09-27 21:57:49 UTC <ScottyP922> All rise. The King is about to address his people.   You know the drill. No eye contact. Be prepared to dance on command. #KingMac #UFC205
780872391639654400 2016-09-27 20:51:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Isn't Dana cute thinking Conor will be on time?https://twitter.com/danawhite/status/780869741422534657
780849862220939264 2016-09-27 19:21:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @UFCEurope Dustin tought it was all talk until he woke up with his nose plastered on the other side of his face.
780836601215774720 2016-09-27 18:28:47 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor has "personal stuff going on, I'm sure he'll announce when he's ready".   Hmmmmm. #UFC205https://twitter.com/MMAjunkie/status/780833336046391296
780794097640607744 2016-09-27 15:39:53 UTC <ScottyP922> So 200 won't even be one of the top 3 cards of the year?   One word - McGregor. #UFC205pic.twitter.com/vVOon5ckkG
780786011496251393 2016-09-27 15:07:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's good to see the UFC no for gay Chris on this card.
780785207657967616 2016-09-27 15:04:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @nyknicks @jonahballow @kporzee @ufc @TheNotoriousMMA He's Ariel's favorite too. He just can't say it.
780737767340855297 2016-09-27 11:56:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Please keep the Alvarez family in your thoughts and prayers during this tough time. #UFC205pic.twitter.com/7ioqH7ewIY
780736124914315264 2016-09-27 11:49:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @antontabuena @BloodyElbow The man has fought once in two years and against a regional fighter. That screams title shot
780719971420803073 2016-09-27 10:45:20 UTC <ScottyP922> He said he will do it and he will do it. Congrats @TheNotoriousMMA on becoming the first UFC champ at 2 weight classes. #UFC205 #KingMacpic.twitter.com/gjkIFpGYAz
780718090875174912 2016-09-27 10:37:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Because he is a true fighter. Unlike the last FW champ who wanted to hide in Brazil. #UFC205https://twitter.com/SeanSheehanBA/status/780630117110382592
780717262634352640 2016-09-27 10:34:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @dbetcher44 Because Conor is on another level as a striker.   You will see. Then you will bow.
780618833627377668 2016-09-26 04:03:27 UTC <ScottyP922> The King and the Queen on the same card?  Oh hells yes. #KingMac #JoannaChampion #UFC205

780562300214312961 2016-09-26 00:18:49 UTC <ScottyP922> The King would never leave his team like that. Loyalty is #1. #UFC205 #KingMac
780562065710800896 2016-09-26 00:17:53 UTC <ScottyP922> So Joanna has left her old team and joined ATT.   I say if ain't broke don't fix it. #UFC205
780560381005750272 2016-09-26 00:11:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheGarden @joannamma @MMAjamesII Never change, Joanna! Never change. #ShesSimplyTheBestYouKnow

780381871968575488 2016-09-26 12:21:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That's because he has no class.
780248946400718848 2016-09-25 03:33:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee Congrats, Mama Elliott, on his first 100 yard game in the NFL. #FirstOfMany #ThatHurdle #RunEZE

779757780324519936 2016-09-24 19:01:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh He can't take a punch anymore. Roy ices him within 2 minutes.

779685319604043776 2016-09-24 14:14:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting This genius just compared the ratings draw of McGregor, Rousey and GSP to a Diaz brother. Wut?
779492219552198656 2016-09-23 01:26:42 UTC <ScottyP922> The sticking point in talks is the #UFC insists Conor doesn't do the billionaire strut into the cage anymore and give away the ending.
779489718044155904 2016-09-23 01:16:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Team McGregor, please follow @sunnatsunami A new #Invicta signee with SBG ties who just won her debut tonight. She rolled with the King #UFC
779488342731816960 2016-09-23 01:11:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottyP922 He's a true fighter. He stays active.
779488107125145600 2016-09-23 01:10:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Are you aware Conor McGregor now has as many fights in the #UFC as Hosay Aldo?  And this is with time lost due to the knee injury.
779484107222974464 2016-09-23 00:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @sunnatsunami Congrats! Great fight!

777321278483075072 2016-09-17 01:40:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Hard to pick. I feel like they could fight 10 times and each would win 5.
777311640744235008 2016-09-17 01:01:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Can't wait for that Cyborg/What's her face fight. #UFCHidalgo
777309667416543232 2016-09-17 00:54:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Man, why couldn't this be 5 rounds? #UFCHidalgo
777305866039074816 2016-09-17 00:38:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Follow Zane's advice. He's usually on point other than that CM Punk fight.
777287541657591812 2016-09-17 23:26:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Horrible officiating. #UFCHidalgo

777156555695353856 2016-09-17 14:45:36 UTC <ScottyP922> To think this all started with a little boy in Dublin with an unbreakable self belief.  Now he owns the game.  #UFCpic.twitter.com/F99APyTZHQ

776836552735461376 2016-09-16 17:34:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @AdamSchefter After 2 weeks of the season. Shows how dysfunctional they are.
776731176178421760 2016-09-16 10:35:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @UltimateFighter @John_Kavanagh I think this is Coach K's way of saying they move the way they all move.

776593691070885889 2016-09-15 01:28:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Is he going to run through Pettis like a truck with no brakes?
776565887868567552 2016-09-15 23:38:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Pretty sure Rumble just called Hosay Aldo a stankass champion.   The man has a point.
776564513810284545 2016-09-15 23:33:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma Oh, he hits that hard. DC just has an all time chin.

776109068016582656 2016-09-14 17:23:15 UTC <ScottyP922> What that fight told me was that Gall wanted no part of Punk on the feet. #UFC203
776108476586221569 2016-09-14 17:20:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom They're talking about him possibly landing a strike next time too. Baby steps.

775793554987687937 2016-09-13 20:29:31 UTC <ScottyP922> They did a Dublin show for Conor. Cleveland for Stipe. The #UFC should do a show in the back-ass of nowhere for that little peahead Dustin.

774828539728240640 2016-09-10 04:34:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Never have Joe Rogan console you after a tough setback in life. #UFC203
774827457853661184 2016-09-10 04:30:36 UTC <ScottyP922> He may hold that belt until we see 10 breakfasts McGregor. #UFC203
774824630808940544 2016-09-10 04:19:22 UTC <ScottyP922> I am seriously waffling on this main event. It would be so HW division if Overeem just murks him. #UFC203
774824345134895105 2016-09-10 04:18:14 UTC <ScottyP922> You want a real hometown pop, check out the Dublin card with McGregor/Brandao. This is a golf clap in comparison. #UFC203
774822302877876224 2016-09-10 04:10:07 UTC <ScottyP922> If anyone ever did that to @John_Kavanagh they'd be peeling them off the canvas. #UFC203

774814707999834112 2016-09-10 03:39:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow LOL
774813725614366721 2016-09-10 03:36:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm laughing at the thought of you trying to match him up next week. Dig through the regionals.
774813422319968256 2016-09-10 03:34:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Ok...marriage is better but hasn't Punk ever gotten a BJ in his life? That wasn't better than this? #UFC203
774812284766023680 2016-09-10 03:30:18 UTC <ScottyP922> We all poke fun at CM Punk but what he did tonight takes brass nuts. You have to respect that. #UFC203
774811912651538432 2016-09-10 03:28:49 UTC <ScottyP922> A lot of F bombs tonight. #UFC203
774811442583334912 2016-09-10 03:26:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'd just like to point out Gall couldn't hit Punk on the feet.
774811104228806657 2016-09-10 03:25:37 UTC <ScottyP922> The bad news for Gall is he's run out of pro wrestlers to fight. #UFC203

774789306309185537 2016-09-10 01:59:00 UTC <ScottyP922> I feel bad for Eye. Losing a close one in her hometown. #UFC203

774749302774177793 2016-09-10 23:20:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Prediction - CM Punk begins his march to the Welterweight and Middleweight titles tonight. #UFC203
774736031916720132 2016-09-10 22:27:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Stipe, Werdum, Gall, Rivera, Andrade.   Or in McGregor - Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum and Bum.
774714878208667648 2016-09-10 21:03:15 UTC <ScottyP922> So Hillary Clinton calls us deplorable.   This is like Danny DeVito calling us short. #Election2016

774615481726537733 2016-09-10 14:28:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA He may look like he's relaxing but he's got a plan to kill everyone in there if needed.
774448178942898176 2016-09-09 03:23:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott @itz_mizdee He'll have his name on the side of that stadium one day and it all starts Sunday. Remember I said it.
774447251250962432 2016-09-09 03:19:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor McGregor. #UFC203
774310993937719296 2016-09-09 18:18:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He will pummel Gall's fist with his face until the ref mercifully puts an end to it.
774286451076894724 2016-09-09 16:40:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @habman123 I'll be rooting for him too.
774081602053820417 2016-09-08 03:06:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite MCGREGOR!!!!!!!!
774062997723459584 2016-09-08 01:52:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @ballsonthebar36 Conor's a tough negotiator. Dana doesn't want him to know how much more of a draw he is than Rousey.
774047009510596608 2016-09-08 00:49:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler This is why your guide is a must every year.
774044201751236608 2016-09-08 00:38:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom We'll find out Saturday. If he's just going through the motions he'll be an ex-champ next week.
774039923741425664 2016-09-08 00:21:13 UTC <ScottyP922> So McGregor has drawn almost double the PPV audience as Rousey.   Yet Dana continues this nonsense that she's the biggest draw. #UFC
774039385893240832 2016-09-08 00:19:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Average PPV buys in cards either main or co-mained...  Rousey - 710,000 McGregor - 1,300,000  Dana doesn't want you to know that. #UFC
774034980464758784 2016-09-08 00:01:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder how many times Punk has approached Gall this week to "work on the finish"? #UFC203
774034761081696256 2016-09-08 00:00:42 UTC <ScottyP922> If Faber does call it a career this weekend I tip my cap to him. One of the greats of the sport and a pioneer of the lighter weights. #UFC
774033687901941760 2016-09-08 23:56:26 UTC <ScottyP922> After every Conor fight the always wrong MMA media tells us what he'll do next.  When will they learn it doesnt matter what they think? #UFC
774033107376832512 2016-09-08 23:54:08 UTC <ScottyP922> I like Urijah. He's a harmless little man but he's getting beat on Saturday Night. Possibly retire. #UFC203
774032744770789377 2016-09-08 23:52:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @SBGCHARLESTOWN @DeeganMarcus Seconded. Those vlogs really added to the fight experience.
774021421450297344 2016-09-08 23:07:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @rezenluc @BloodyElbow He should ask Conor if he can sleepover.
774007094827634688 2016-09-08 22:10:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Jesus Christ Conor's God.
773714671522185216 2016-09-07 02:48:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource I'd say both fighters are in the same position.
773657296278650880 2016-09-07 23:00:47 UTC <ScottyP922> At this point, he's competing against himself. The ruler of the numbers. #AllHailKingMac #Peerless #UFCpic.twitter.com/HjnzgM98PH

773360845720027136 2016-09-06 03:22:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Not sure. Depends on the card.
773351890440552449 2016-09-06 02:47:13 UTC <ScottyP922> So is the plan that we show up for #UFC205 and then find out what the card is?
773351725352747008 2016-09-06 02:46:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Holloway beats Pettis. 2nd best FW on the roster to a guy who can dominate him on one leg. #UFC205

773309266887401472 2016-09-06 23:57:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA In a ruthless business you are the business.
773156664593743872 2016-09-06 13:51:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @HelmanDC @dallascowboys LOL
773155915893731328 2016-09-06 13:48:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting And we're about to drink eggnog out of your skull this Christmas. #KingMac #UFCHeadOfCollectingHeads
773136982574764032 2016-09-06 12:33:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Good. He'll need that money for medical expenses. #TheKingIsComing
773136747781824512 2016-09-06 12:32:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @JedKMeshew @MMAFighting No class.
773002711956463616 2016-09-05 03:39:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Congratulations, Dee.
772947225471320064 2016-09-05 23:59:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Yes I did. Rousey kicked her ass twice. Dominated her from start to finish. The 2nd fight was a complete drubbing for 3 rounds
772946614080172036 2016-09-05 23:56:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Tate at main even was a joke scenario. She isn't a draw unless she's getting her ass kicked by Rousey.
772946504914993152 2016-09-05 23:56:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx About half a million under it's projection. It was UFC 200 and it didn't even make the top 3 PPVs.   It bombed.
772943518750871552 2016-09-05 23:44:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Tate/Nunes main eventing 200 was an embarrassing moment for the UFC. It's why the card bombed. Nobody cared.
772943371384029184 2016-09-05 23:43:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx But you think Tate/Nunes was okay to main event 200?   Pardon me if I don't take you seriously.
772942674143969280 2016-09-05 23:41:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Tate is not worthy of that spot. Stop with your nonsense.
772942541679431681 2016-09-05 23:40:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Probably not but I do believe Joanna deserves a spot at the top of a PPV. Especially if Miesha fucking Tate can main 200, pal
772941220553297921 2016-09-05 23:35:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx If Tate can main 200, Joanna can certainly co-main 205.
772941059815014400 2016-09-05 23:34:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Joanna's also a title fight.   And if you think that even matters you have no clue about PPV.
772776806487363585 2016-09-05 12:42:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Yeah but they could have went with Brock. Or Aldo. They had options. They chose Tate.
772654267203280900 2016-09-04 04:35:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA He started that fire with his stare.   I can't even stand how much of a King he is.
772599564012490756 2016-09-04 00:57:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Thank you for blessing me, King.
772581580204367872 2016-09-04 23:46:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @TooToughToTame @Hendrick24Team He can drive a little.
772580161355210752 2016-09-04 23:40:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor barely gets a sentence out of his mouth and the #UFC already has a shirt made quoting him.   A King's life.

772526229606072321 2016-09-04 20:06:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @xvrandombsxx Wait. So Tate can main event 200 but Joanna can't co-main 205?  Get out of here.
772305319540117504 2016-09-03 05:28:31 UTC <ScottyP922> How about the King @TheNotoriousMMA and Queen @joannamma main and co-maining that NYC card? #UFC205
772292635692335104 2016-09-03 04:38:07 UTC <ScottyP922> So when the hell do we hear about the NY card? #UFC205

771900011806326784 2016-09-02 02:37:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Pathetic that an established UFC fighter has to resort to this.
771899457357176832 2016-09-02 02:35:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Silva, Rockhold, Hendo, GSP. Would be quite a run for Bisping.

771883747130089472 2016-09-02 01:33:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA He's being all Kingish right now to us bums.
771853547055017988 2016-09-02 23:33:20 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm surprised Conor firing Joe Silva hasn't become a bigger story. #UFC #KingMac
771820995829129217 2016-09-02 21:23:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Watch it, King. No one can take that Texas Schoolbook Depository shot!

771459463106748416 2016-09-01 21:27:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Stay out of the clinch?
771452132876750848 2016-09-01 20:58:16 UTC <ScottyP922> Cerrone/Lawler is a mixed bag for me. An asshole has to lose but an asshole has to win too. #UFC
771385561600946176 2016-09-01 16:33:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MightyMouseUFC @UltimateFighter @John_Kavanagh Hey now. Not all.   I'm whispering so the King doesn't hear us.
771350235431907328 2016-09-01 14:13:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting None of these guys are ever interested in an MMA fight though.
771348465293156352 2016-09-01 14:06:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting And those people would like to thank Eddie Alvarez.

771346052012179456 2016-09-01 13:56:44 UTC <ScottyP922> So the plan with #TUF24 is to build up a new contender in the flyweight division and then immediately expose him against DJ.   I like it.

769715333817069572 2016-08-27 01:56:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Condit by sub or Maia by KO. #UFCVancouver
769712557053603840 2016-08-27 01:45:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I think they should have given Punk another opponent since Gall now has a couple of fights in the UFC.
769711100736708617 2016-08-27 01:40:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow One of the hardest fights to predict. Hell if I know. I took Maia though.
769710772607979521 2016-08-27 01:38:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani If this Howard Cosell of MMA thing gets boring, you have a career in stand up comedy.
769710355056562177 2016-08-27 01:37:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh He couldn't handle Conor's pressure. Conor's a bully. Pettis gets bullied. It would be over quick.

769703753977040896 2016-08-27 01:10:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Now here comes a man who absolutely can't afford another loss. Pettis hasn't been the same since fighting Frankenstein. #UFCVancouver
769702808656416768 2016-08-27 01:07:04 UTC <ScottyP922> I do and that was with Gall having no UFC experience. Now he has a couple of fights in. He will destroy Punk.

769701463224377344 2016-08-27 01:01:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Wait...they're seriously going to put Punk in the Octagon with Gall? I thought that was a joke. #UFCVancouver
769701102275231744 2016-08-27 01:00:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm used to that level of flashy striking from Alpha Male.

769696648922533889 2016-08-27 00:42:36 UTC <ScottyP922> They couldn't have Joe win because he's too real for this sport.   Let's do #3!  Something like that. I graduated high school. #UFCVancouver
769696323171999744 2016-08-27 00:41:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Possibly close 1st round, PVZ grinds her out with her work rate for a decision.
769695866361962496 2016-08-27 00:39:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin Tell him Conor McGregor would take his soul.

769695000942829568 2016-08-27 00:36:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Terrible decision. #UFCVancouver
769684757521297408 2016-08-27 23:55:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Yeah but does he file his girl's toes?

769681976370626560 2016-08-27 23:44:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Casey has about 5 minutes of cardio usually. But with Alvey's tremendous work rate and pace maybe he can go 6, 7 tonight. #UFCVancouver

768965935789113344 2016-08-25 00:19:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Earth to Nate. You are not even remotely the draw of McGregor. Thus you will not get the same treatment. It's business.

768279200146923521 2016-08-23 02:50:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I was thinking the New Years card but even that might be too soon.
768278983880290304 2016-08-23 02:49:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow It would not be a good night for Eddie. Lets hope for his family's sake this doesnt come to fruition. Let him live his bum life

768250504682037248 2016-08-23 00:56:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch Great breakdown on Heavy Hands. Do you feel 155 would change things much for the 3rd fight?

767893456970772480 2016-08-22 01:17:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Conor will counter with one option for Dana.
767893118112980992 2016-08-22 01:16:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay's coach actually said today that Conor is afraid to fight Aldo.  I mean, now W.T.F.  #UFC

767742554251157504 2016-08-22 15:17:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Let's see him move the needle without McGregor.
767742089153146880 2016-08-22 15:15:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Would be great but he'd be stripped of his belt. Rather see him defend that first.
767726971568656385 2016-08-22 14:15:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @PaulBurton_15 @thegobbygamer Agreed. I hope he's done with that weight class but knowing Conor he's probably not.

767714447909617664 2016-08-22 13:26:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Please ask Coach K about Conor's cardio and whether that's just a 170 lb issue.
767713670344413184 2016-08-22 13:22:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @JoshMichalski I think they definitely consider each other kindred spirits. Post career they'll be bros.

767227432537587713 2016-08-20 05:10:48 UTC <ScottyP922> A fight at 155 is more lopsided for Conor. He'll have a bigger gas tank. May finish him if he's not worried about conserving energy. #UFC202
767226886971875328 2016-08-20 05:08:38 UTC <ScottyP922> The first two rounds showed the skills gap between both fighters. Nate's not in Conor's league as a striker. He's just not. #UFC202
767180227713830912 2016-08-20 02:03:14 UTC <ScottyP922> No other fighter on the roster has the balls to do what Conor's doing. He's got the most to lose as the biggest draw. #UFC202

766778767557570561 2016-08-19 23:27:58 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't like how emotional Conor is. #UFC202

766771752806514694 2016-08-19 23:00:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Not allowing POS Nick Diaz in for the weigh in drastically reduces any chance of an incident. #UFC202
766771397397975040 2016-08-19 22:58:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Well at least they have standards at this joint.
766771007231262720 2016-08-19 22:57:08 UTC <ScottyP922> In a precautionary measure, the lawyers for Conor and Nate will be filling in for them in the staredown. #UFC202
766770514283159552 2016-08-19 22:55:11 UTC <ScottyP922> I predict Conor and Nate will actually bro hug at the staredown. #UFC202
766640464330186753 2016-08-19 14:18:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Conor's in trouble for not allowing a group of POS thugs to throw bottles at him. Amazing.
766640273850007552 2016-08-19 14:17:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Lawsuits? Give me a f'n break.
766489906113748993 2016-08-18 04:20:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Exactly. He's too stupid to know what he just said.
766470362741825536 2016-08-18 03:02:29 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd just like to point out how much longer that mic held in there than Hosay. #UFC202 #FTeamDiaz

766449401271291904 2016-08-18 01:39:11 UTC <ScottyP922> I think if Glover can make it out of the first round, Rumble is in trouble. #UFC202
766448395053588480 2016-08-18 01:35:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Everyone is picking Nate. But then cowardly saying a Conor win wouldn't surprise them.   They've got their bases covered. #UFC202

766427168721305601 2016-08-18 00:10:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie He didn't like that Conor got all the questions. Think of it as a concert, Nate. You opened and then the headliner came out.
766426289398026240 2016-08-18 00:07:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst It just shows you have damn long they've been fighting.
766425456132366336 2016-08-18 00:04:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Nate lives in a delusional world where he is the show. This boy was a Fox undercard fighter until he got the McGregor rub.

766423221554020352 2016-08-18 23:55:10 UTC <ScottyP922> If McGregor gets fined even a dollar for defending himself that is some straight bullshit. Fine Nate. Ban Nick. #UFC202
766422716115218437 2016-08-18 23:53:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's bury those cockroaches but Conor probably doesn't watch many movies.
766422523777089536 2016-08-18 23:52:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting This is what I'm saying. F Nate. F Nick. F Stockton, California and F every Diaz fan on the planet.

763547344507920384 2016-08-10 01:27:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @vine Conor would stiffen him up inside 2 rounds. He's running his mouth for a pay day. Otherwise nobody cares about him.

763406233781100544 2016-08-10 16:06:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I wonder if a tune up fight is best now rather than back into a title fight.

761695555139403776 2016-08-05 22:49:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet @issackinz I think that reporter would have needed a new pair of underwear if that was done in person.

761691333970960384 2016-08-05 22:32:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate actually said he was the biggest draw in the UFC before McGregor.   The boy is delusional. #UFC202
761689974202732544 2016-08-05 22:26:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor asked Nate for a tank you for no longer making 20 and 20. Now he's making the big money. #UFC202
761687799447683072 2016-08-05 22:18:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Bottom line - If Conor doesn't gas he wins this fight. He's just more skilled than Nate. #UFC202
761686939523096576 2016-08-05 22:14:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor says if he hit RDA with the shots he hit Nate with he'd be a 2 weight world champion right now.   He's right. #UFC202

759425636041580545 2016-07-30 16:29:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria I was worried about the cardio before the first fight and still am. Nate can eat those shots for five rounds.

759079041408393216 2016-07-29 17:32:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @CarlaEsparza1 No. That could lead to serious consequences with fighters going to extreme measures to avoid that suspension.

759020674694258688 2016-07-29 13:40:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom His motivation is to try to get a little of that McGregor rub. He wants the big paydays but nobody cares.

758506549505626112 2016-07-27 03:37:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That is quite an insult to her. To any combat female athlete.
758500132740538369 2016-07-27 03:11:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 That was final preparations for the Mendes fight.
758492753571483649 2016-07-27 02:42:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @Amanda_Leoa vs @VenezuelanVixen at #UFCASAP. Make it happen, @danawhite
758492143245754368 2016-07-27 02:39:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @bsn @TheNotoriousMMA Congrats BSN. I'm sure when you started this company you couldn't have dreamed of this.
758476927460057093 2016-07-27 01:39:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow This woman is equal parts sexy and frightening.

758387167425138689 2016-07-27 19:42:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @NinoBeige @Spursfandub It only took you 13 seconds to clown this man.   Better luck next time, Hosay.
758375305601949696 2016-07-27 18:55:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @Spursfandub @NinoBeige Seriously? Check his record. The man never main evented a PPV. He never co-mained a PPV.
758374194547523584 2016-07-27 18:51:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @NinoBeige @Spursfandub Guess by being a mid carder his whole career  You can't like the Diaz brothers and be intelligent at the same time.
758373838363111424 2016-07-27 18:49:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @NinoBeige He's been a Fox fighter his whole career. No PPV main events. Now he's on Conan. Why? McGregor.
758373630539550720 2016-07-27 18:48:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @NinoBeige You'd have to be an assclown of epic proportions if you believe Nate Diaz made McGregor.
758369638556143618 2016-07-27 18:33:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Laughing at the Diaz pukes pissed off that the King interrupted on Conan.   Eh, dipshits? He wouldn't be on Conan without McGregor. #UFC202

758063055217500160 2016-07-26 22:14:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani She's not a star. The UFC and apparently Ariel wanted her to be but she's just not. McGregor carried that PPV.

757593064785350657 2016-07-25 15:07:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He will snore in four.   Everybody form a line to tank the King.
757386820309098496 2016-07-24 01:27:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Lawler is slowing down. He lost that last fight and looked old doing it. Might have to go with Woodley. #UFC201

757059725615853568 2016-07-23 03:47:58 UTC <ScottyP922> I believe Shevchenko brought in Ronda Rousey for sparring in preparation for this fight. #UFCChicago #BeautifulWork
757039385120571392 2016-07-23 02:27:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Where have you gone, Ronda Rousey? A promotion turns it's lonely eyes to you. Woo hoo hoo #UFCChicago
757038097628557312 2016-07-23 02:22:02 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm not saying Holm isn't good. She's just not what people thought she was after Rousey. #UFCChicago
757037510002442240 2016-07-23 02:19:42 UTC <ScottyP922> Folks, I think it's time to realize Holm is not a great fighter. She just took advantage of an idiotic game plan by Rousey. #UFCChicago
757025323712122880 2016-07-23 01:31:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That's my guess. Holm's range and volume striking win rounds. Schevchenko won't land enough. She needs to hurt Holm, IMO.
757020951896813568 2016-07-23 01:13:54 UTC <ScottyP922> 20-18 Barboza. #UFCChicago #FNateDiaz

757016183946313728 2016-07-23 00:54:57 UTC <ScottyP922> I took Barboza because Melendez doesn't train with anybody of note. #UFCChicago

757009094628765696 2016-07-23 00:26:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I can picture Zane replacing Buffer and using this intro.
757008409594044417 2016-07-23 00:24:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Sorry, Felice. You could be stopping a terror attack while helping an old lady across the street and I'd still be like F you. #UFCChicago
757006656748281856 2016-07-23 00:17:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow. Expected more from Curran. #UFCChicago
757005253208334336 2016-07-23 00:11:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Curran out works her to a split decision victory.
757005043140886529 2016-07-23 00:10:41 UTC <ScottyP922> Joe wants you to keep your eye out for this young prospect Felice Herrig. #UFCChicago
756989358675202049 2016-07-23 23:08:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I had it a draw. At the very least they should run it back.
756976452873191424 2016-07-23 22:17:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @BreezyPuffs @mstek Doesn't exist in the UFC. She is so obviously chemically enhanced. I have zero respect for her.
756976089721925634 2016-07-23 22:15:38 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't help but wonder if Nate Diaz is watching these Fox prelims and getting homesick. #UFCChicago #UFC202 #KingMac
756972875916124160 2016-07-23 22:02:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Smooth production, UFC. #UFCChicago
756966809799102465 2016-07-23 21:38:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Could someone tell Cyborg it's not on the UFC women to accommodate her at a weight class that doesn't exist? #UFCChicago
756966259246374912 2016-07-23 21:36:34 UTC <ScottyP922> If you come out to Thriller, you absolutely have to do the zombie walk. Epic fail, James. #UFCChicago
756965198435680256 2016-07-23 21:32:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Seems like a case of overvaluing takedowns.
756964395629088768 2016-07-23 21:29:10 UTC <ScottyP922> You do not speak his name in vain.  It was not a good Knight for that man. #UFCChicago

756832899169648640 2016-07-23 12:46:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate Diaz on Conan.   Straight from the Fox undercards.   Changing bum lives. The McGregor effect. #UFC202 #KingMac

755882204450914304 2016-07-20 21:48:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Maybe Aldo is just telling the truth. He cheats. Like the steroid use.
755882039572885504 2016-07-20 21:48:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani So what? What's the point? That the guy who got murked in seconds will have a spy this time?

754497118778298369 2016-07-16 02:05:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @McGregorArmy @TheNotoriousMMA You can call him Hosay Sr. #FwKing #145GOAT
754367737783287808 2016-07-16 17:30:58 UTC <ScottyP922> I know it's the cool thing and all to hate on Rousey these days but I hope she rips Holm's arm off in a rematch. #UFC

754366348172599296 2016-07-16 17:25:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @marc_raimondi @MMAFighting A little surprised by the responses. He's got a very good point. That Reebok deal is completely unfair.

754127711321350144 2016-07-15 01:37:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @chaseelliott That Bristol scheme gets my vote.
754103089569886208 2016-07-15 23:59:21 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor would Peruvian Necktie tap the entire Gracie family. #UFC202 #IJJKing #Dublin353
754094955971350528 2016-07-15 23:27:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Could #UFC200 have gone any worse for Dana?   You disrespect our King and the fight Gods will smite you.

754081330598739968 2016-07-15 22:32:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Reports are Dillon's ground game has really improved working with the King.
753625982028787712 2016-07-14 16:23:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma That's what I've been saying.
753611766043664384 2016-07-14 15:27:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @Forbes Now just imagine if Conor McGregor was the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys.   I just blew your mind, Ariel.
753535318687645696 2016-07-14 10:23:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I bet he calls the Democrats goofy eggs.

753442356972531713 2016-07-13 04:13:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Smolka keeps talking about fighting Reis for the interim belt. Please tell me the UFC is not doing that to DJ. He's an active champion. #UFC

753437361527066624 2016-07-13 03:53:59 UTC <ScottyP922> If Eddie wants an easy fight he can fight Conor. If he wants a hard one, take on the guy who survived against Lando Vannata. #UFCSiouxFalls
753427551759065088 2016-07-13 03:15:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Vannata has nothing left. #UFCSiouxFalls

752672859231776768 2016-07-11 01:16:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh I thought Conor won the first round. 3 and a half minutes of dominance on the feet trumps a couple of takedowns.
752520101564411904 2016-07-11 15:09:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I believe this is a shout out to Uncle Frank.

752275186691563520 2016-07-10 22:55:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Somebody photoshop Hosay stopping by McGregor's and getting an interim FW champion belt in his happy meal. #ItsAToy #UFC200 #McGregorEra
752256462932639744 2016-07-10 21:41:31 UTC <ScottyP922> DC doesnt fail a test, will fight anyone on 2 days notice and gets ripped for how he won the fight against an all time great  What? #UFC200
752255342722084864 2016-07-10 21:37:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @TWiMMAdotcom @WallyFrogmore Don't get me wrong. I don't question her toughness. But Conor was criticized and that choke was actually in.
752251797994086402 2016-07-10 21:22:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @Gooner_nin The main card especially.   Thank Dana. It didn't have to be that way.
752250884646666242 2016-07-10 21:19:21 UTC <ScottyP922> The real piece of shit is Aldo. And Gadelha. And the entire Brazilian MMA world in general. And the media for protecting them. #UFC200
752250688885907460 2016-07-10 21:18:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Aldo called McGregor a piece of shit in the cage last night.   These Brazilians really get testy when you take everything they own. #UFC200
752248174601969664 2016-07-10 21:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Starting to think Frankie threw that fight last night.  That man will do anything to avoid fighting Conor McGregor. #UFC200
752246807997079552 2016-07-10 21:03:09 UTC <ScottyP922> It was vintage Aldo last night as he got yet another dominant decision.   So it's clear. McGregor iced Aldo in his prime. #UFC200
752246223365603328 2016-07-10 21:00:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Why no criticism of Miesha for a quick tap? The choke was never in. She essentially tapped to strikes. #UFC200
752245465333239808 2016-07-10 20:57:49 UTC <ScottyP922> So...#UFC200   Wasn't all that great, eh?
752241204977397760 2016-07-10 20:40:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow The 'I'm sorry for using that word" tweet from Cerrone coming in 3...2...1...
752240976798908420 2016-07-10 20:39:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Classy.
752128367537913857 2016-07-10 13:12:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I understand why people want to see this fight but it's an absolute joke to give Henderson the next title shot.
752007461238956032 2016-07-09 05:12:05 UTC <ScottyP922> That division needs Ronda back. They are all imposters. #UFC200
751985855565275140 2016-07-09 03:46:13 UTC <ScottyP922> This is one of the greatest fights I've ever seen. Please tell me there will be a trilogy. #UFC200
751981947900010496 2016-07-09 03:30:42 UTC <ScottyP922> A little MMA blasphemy here - Anderson Silva is not the GOAT. #UFC200
751981130858033153 2016-07-09 03:27:27 UTC <ScottyP922> I sure would have like to have seen Jones/Cormier tonight. #UFC200
751980648588509184 2016-07-09 03:25:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Its always good to finish with a career Fox fighter.
751978754059210753 2016-07-09 03:18:00 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Hosay just announced he's in a relationship with his coach. Not sure why that's relevant right now. #UFC200
751978038036877312 2016-07-09 03:15:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Frankie got blanked. Didn't win a round. #UFC200
751977500633206784 2016-07-09 03:13:01 UTC <ScottyP922> It's laughable that some people actually believe Frankie could beat McGregor.   That's not even competitive, folks. #UFC200
751976801937731584 2016-07-09 03:10:15 UTC <ScottyP922> It will be said about Aldo when he's gone - No mortal could defeat him. #UFC200
751970359327399938 2016-07-09 02:44:39 UTC <ScottyP922> They should have Conor cam for this fight. #UFC200
751969246251548672 2016-07-09 02:40:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay should have brought a pillow. #UFC200
751968593911353345 2016-07-09 02:37:38 UTC <ScottyP922> So how funny would it be if Aldo gets slept in seconds again? #UFC200
751967493426733057 2016-07-09 02:33:15 UTC <ScottyP922> Aldo/Edgar next. Dance for daddy. #UFC200

751965022713241600 2016-07-09 02:23:26 UTC <ScottyP922> There's talk of possibly going with a red canvas for UFC300.   Something to look forward to. #UFC200
751962649047470081 2016-07-09 02:14:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah, Cain's an all time great but he's not being trained by Edmond. Gotta go Brown here. Beautiful work. #UFC200
751959747788668928 2016-07-09 02:02:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Did Hosay just say he is the true featherweight champion?   Holy shit is he an idiot. #UFC200

751911513133199360 2016-07-09 22:50:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I just hope we can still see Aldo's back when it goes to the ground.   No?
751910394470498305 2016-07-09 22:46:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @ToddMartinMMA @sherdogdotcom McGregor effect. Nobody cares.
751909789794463744 2016-07-09 22:43:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Ok, I hate the yellow mat. #UFC200
751908677217423360 2016-07-09 22:39:33 UTC <ScottyP922> This yellow mat is going to take some getting used to. #UFC200
751908182042312704 2016-07-09 22:37:35 UTC <ScottyP922> That yellow mat is kind of cool but it might make it tricky to see Hosay's back should the fight go to the ground. #UFC200
751907816135331841 2016-07-09 22:36:07 UTC <ScottyP922> You're not fooling anyone with that moustache, Hosay. We know it's you.  Your King says hello.  #UFC200
751906887629676544 2016-07-09 22:32:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Joanna/Gadelha was fight of the week for me. Tonight it's Zingano/Pena.   Women's MMA for the win. #UFC200

751746190102921216 2016-07-09 11:53:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani This is what Brazilians do when they meet their superior in the Octagon.  Aldo did the same with his daddy McGregor.
751648702175977472 2016-07-08 05:26:30 UTC <ScottyP922> I loved seeing McGregor cage side yelling encouragement to Joanna. Gods recognize Gods. #TUFFinale

751646580814389248 2016-07-08 05:18:04 UTC <ScottyP922> 48-47 Joanna. She beat that ass the last 3 rounds. If Gadelha can't lay and pray she can't compete with her. #TUFFinale
751645509878636545 2016-07-08 05:13:49 UTC <ScottyP922> I know who is really winning this fight. Judging be damned. #TUFFinale
751645117316861952 2016-07-08 05:12:15 UTC <ScottyP922> No class from Gadelha. A true Brazilian. #TUFFinale
751641785873694720 2016-07-08 04:59:01 UTC <ScottyP922> I hate seeing a steroid infested Brazilian winning on chemically enhanced strength. #TUFFinale
751638504887771136 2016-07-08 04:45:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Gadelha looks so natural. #TUFFinale
751636700540141568 2016-07-08 04:38:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Is there anything more charming than Joanna's broken English? #TUFFinale
751624296326389760 2016-07-08 03:49:31 UTC <ScottyP922> I hate fighters who talk shit.   McGregor is King. #TUFFinale
751597748697206785 2016-07-08 02:04:01 UTC <ScottyP922> The similarities between how Hosay and Gadelha have villainized a fighter for beating them is striking. #UFC200
751564009074229249 2016-07-08 23:49:57 UTC <ScottyP922> The belt stays with me. - @joannamma #TheBest #TUFFinale
751561756544204800 2016-07-08 23:41:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Conor has to book Eddie a hotel in Philadelphia.
751552143434317824 2016-07-08 23:02:48 UTC <ScottyP922> I just hope Gray Maynard gets through this fight with as minimal damage to the head as possible. #TUF23Finale
751550414651322368 2016-07-08 22:55:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @superCalo @BipolarDana Or fly.
751550186573402112 2016-07-08 22:55:02 UTC <ScottyP922> ~UFC offices, January 2016~  What about Tate/Nunes as the main event for #UFC200 ?  ~silence~  ~room erupts in laughter~
751549326955057157 2016-07-08 22:51:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Dana White: I can't admit I made a huge mistake.
751548771943809024 2016-07-08 22:49:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I don't know who Stephen is but he has nothing to worry about.
751548209235984384 2016-07-08 22:47:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeganMarcus What did he have to say?
751547374292635648 2016-07-08 22:43:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Conor, you do that to Nate and I will have a fightgasm.
751546985983901696 2016-07-08 22:42:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA This man is kicking heads out of the Octagon.
751546590549204992 2016-07-08 22:40:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Brock may not be the best mixed martial artist but he is definitely the scariest.   Buffer would be giving me CPR. #UFC200
751546185320726529 2016-07-08 22:39:08 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder what Cat Zingano thinks of seeing two of her defeated opponents main eventing #UFC200 ?
751545792473735168 2016-07-08 22:37:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma @John_Kavanagh Preach it, Coach.
751545609568579584 2016-07-08 22:36:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @DavrinR @Phil_Sports Tate is so durable. I heard someone say "Nunes early, Tate late". That's what I expect too.
751545214259564544 2016-07-08 22:35:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Ariel? No.
751545015189565440 2016-07-08 22:34:29 UTC <ScottyP922> Mark Hunt is the nicest head hunter you'll ever meet. You'll wake up and say man that guy was charming. #UFC200
751544372093652992 2016-07-08 22:31:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @Phil_Sports @DavrinR Probably right. Rousey/Tate 3.
751543548638535681 2016-07-08 22:28:39 UTC <ScottyP922> I missed Anderson's interview. Is he happy for back? #UFC200
751542050307342337 2016-07-08 22:22:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Phil_Sports Thats a terrible main event for 200.
751542030082408448 2016-07-08 22:22:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @Phil_Sports Not like that was plan A or B.
751537782728822785 2016-07-08 22:05:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ZPGIFs @JimmyJFromBK Don't jump to any conclusions until we see the results of his Z sample.
751537120897007616 2016-07-08 22:03:07 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC200 It's absolutely ridiculous that Hendricks didn't make weight again.   ~unbuttoning pants to relax~
751532346873184256 2016-07-08 21:44:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Showed their lack of class. Look at how Conor and Aldo acted after 194. 1 had class, the other's Brazilian.
751531429742469120 2016-07-08 21:40:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah? Well Jon Jones isn't talking until they test his C sample. #UFC200
751531192231587841 2016-07-08 21:39:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst Zingano/Pena. It hasn't been talked about enough.
751530535672045569 2016-07-08 21:36:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @bryangahagan35 @John_Kavanagh @keithflemo They hate him because they ain't him.  Their day will come.
751503401565945856 2016-07-08 19:49:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I gave Gadelha a slight decision before but Joanna's takedown defense has drastically improved. The champ wins a decision.
751502459487551488 2016-07-08 19:45:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh I admire it. The man is willing to give up his head for the pay day to take care of his family.   It'll be done in 1.
751490789750874112 2016-07-08 18:59:00 UTC <ScottyP922> So Jones pops and loses his chance to get his belt back at 200 and now has to watch a guy he hates potentially destroy his hero. #UFC200
751436281717125120 2016-07-08 15:22:25 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay used a towel at weigh ins. It's the same towel he used to cry in at #UFC194.
751435619407134720 2016-07-08 15:19:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Krikey.
751432808757862400 2016-07-08 15:08:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Joanna/Gasteroids 2 tonight.   Tank Conor it's Friday. #TUF23Finale #UFC200
751415424181346304 2016-07-08 13:59:32 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't see any way Anderson can win this fight + MMA = Silva 1st round KO. #UFC200
751394205935820800 2016-07-08 12:35:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani It would be easy. He shows up and goes to sleep. Like a little baby. Wakes up to cash a big check.
751274233876000770 2016-07-07 04:38:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting His ego won't allow him to admit he made a mistake. Tate/Nunes main eventing 200? Cmon man.
751269269942349825 2016-07-07 04:18:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @sambod79 Definitely would. It's really hard to get interested in the fight with no belt and no camp for Anderson.
751268066172936196 2016-07-07 04:13:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMARetweet @Larrylegend69 I don't know. I know I don't like him at 170. He'll have to defend next or be stripped.
751267716309233665 2016-07-07 04:12:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @sambod79 Probably wouldn't have gotten done so quickly if the belt was in play.
751267190058299392 2016-07-07 04:10:30 UTC <ScottyP922> It didn't take USADA long to take all those belts from Brazil. #UFCVegas
751266985455947777 2016-07-07 04:09:41 UTC <ScottyP922> https://twitter.com/MikeBohnMMA/status/751264753926807553  But let us enjoy today, Mike. Let us enjoy today.
751266414099435524 2016-07-07 04:07:25 UTC <ScottyP922> That Tate fight is literally the least interesting fight on the main card for me. Amanda Nunes main eventing #UFC200  Blame Dana's ego.
751265791211778048 2016-07-07 04:04:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAssh0le That's a joke of a main event for the 200 card. I guess they figure it doesn't matter with such a strong undercard.
751264305421570048 2016-07-07 03:59:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting What? That's ridiculous.
751264156578222081 2016-07-07 03:58:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Where was the post fight interview with the bum version of Aldo?   No class. #UFCVegas
751263775144108032 2016-07-07 03:56:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Not to rain on the parade but McGregor ices Alvarez. Not competitive. #UFCVegas
751263306308915200 2016-07-07 03:55:04 UTC <ScottyP922> This sport makes no sense. #UFCVegas
751263033221976064 2016-07-07 03:53:59 UTC <ScottyP922> What. The. Fuck.   F'n MMA #UFCVegas
751259834041954304 2016-07-07 03:41:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Any idea where the fight takes place in the fight order?
751259619113242624 2016-07-07 03:40:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Which is why I'm not complaining. It you saw that fight on the street it would be clear who won it.
751259249259479041 2016-07-07 03:38:57 UTC <ScottyP922> I bet Anderson is happy for back. #UFC200
751257295993114624 2016-07-07 03:31:11 UTC <ScottyP922> If Lewis wins the rematch will he demand a trilogy? #UFCVegas
751257055923691520 2016-07-07 03:30:14 UTC <ScottyP922> Pretty impressive turning Nelson into a desperate wrestler. #UFCVegas
751255797812830212 2016-07-07 03:25:14 UTC <ScottyP922> You are correct. Lucky guess!
751255226368262144 2016-07-07 03:22:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow How do you not work on your takedown defense preparing for Roy Nelson?
751254612926205953 2016-07-07 03:20:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman @BloodyElbow What about the high level wrestling?
751254480381935616 2016-07-07 03:20:00 UTC <ScottyP922> A little trivia between rounds. Who has more UFC takedowns? Chad Mendes or Roy Nelson?   No googling. #UFCVegas
751253590841368577 2016-07-07 03:16:28 UTC <ScottyP922> Lewis's gas tank is why I picked Nelson. #UFCVegas
751251567295209477 2016-07-07 03:08:25 UTC <ScottyP922> This is going to be nuts. #UFCVegas
751250389794709504 2016-07-07 03:03:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @_tylerjohnston People's Main Event.
751250314540552193 2016-07-07 03:03:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani A literal LOL at the trademark.
751250072684335104 2016-07-07 03:02:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Like you can even pick this fight. Give me Nelson for no good reason at all.
751249563223257088 2016-07-07 03:00:28 UTC <ScottyP922> All I know is if I was in between Roy Nelson and Derrick Lewis when they were ready to fight I would lose control of my bowels. #UFCVegas
751242356624592896 2016-07-07 02:31:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch Well then I'm going head to head with the great Connor Reuebusch here. Give me Jouban.
751241868202172420 2016-07-07 02:29:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Team Joanna all the way. She's one of my all time favorite fighters. Man or woman.
751240380784398336 2016-07-07 02:23:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Best fight of the week.
751240079771705344 2016-07-07 02:22:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Gadelha and Aldo handled their losses the same. With zero class despite their opponent showing them respect after the fight. #UFCVegas
751238419984953344 2016-07-07 02:16:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow  LOL What kind of loser loses to Joe Duffy in seconds?! #UFCVegas
751237097688666116 2016-07-07 02:10:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @NateDiaz209 The UFC brings the belts to those events. It's not even the real belt. It's a replica.
751235981638971392 2016-07-07 02:06:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAssh0le @hellofeliciabg Greatest sport on the planet. So unpredictable.
751235352690515968 2016-07-07 02:04:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I think grappler too.
751235230288130048 2016-07-07 02:03:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg What got you into it?
751233092883546112 2016-07-07 01:55:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Technology has come so far.
751232926386380804 2016-07-07 01:54:21 UTC <ScottyP922> I love when fighters tell us Jesus helped them beat people up. #UFCVegas #ChristMMA #JesusJiuJitsu
751232285261922308 2016-07-07 01:51:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @Jenet68P See? Just when I think we're becoming besties you go there.   I'm not surprised, mother...umm...of children.
751231301630451712 2016-07-07 01:47:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Saved by the bell. #UFCVegas
751230288748044288 2016-07-07 01:43:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @Jenet68P Jenet68P def. Jon Jones via slaps Round 1 0:19
751229242264915968 2016-07-07 01:39:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @erstlecocq @Jenet68P I agree with the ew. No interest in DC/Silva.
751228315541929984 2016-07-07 01:36:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @bisping @arielhelwani He's loving being the champion.
751228036234764289 2016-07-07 01:34:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti @MMAFighting DC is a good man. Sad to see this effect his legacy. He probably will never get his chance at redemption.
751226434853695489 2016-07-07 01:28:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Makdessi is stupid tough. #UFCVegas
751225885244715008 2016-07-07 01:26:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P We'll be best friends when you get "McGregor" tattooed on your midsection.
751225552636350464 2016-07-07 01:25:03 UTC <ScottyP922> I know you can't rely on MMA math but RDA destroyed Pettis and Cerrone. Alvarez barely beat Pettis and lost to Cerrone. #UFCVegas
751220209818763264 2016-07-07 01:03:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Would Don Frye have made the HOF without the moustache? I doubt it. #UFCVegas
751219894918807552 2016-07-07 01:02:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I pretty much think Alvarez gets destroyed tonight but this is usually when I'm wrong. #UFCVegas
751215789739565056 2016-07-07 00:46:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch Has to be disappointed. He knows he doesnt have time to wait out a 2 year ban. I thought he might retire if he lost Saturday.
751210188917518336 2016-07-07 00:24:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg LOL is that your fight face?
751207238866333697 2016-07-07 00:12:17 UTC <ScottyP922> From the wiki page on tonight's card. #Jiu-JitsuKing #UFCVegaspic.twitter.com/9lWO7AfCih
751205324602957824 2016-07-07 00:04:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor tore his ACL in the middle of a fight with Holloway and continued to dominate to the bell  He doesnt get enough credit for that #UFC
751203896941477888 2016-07-07 23:59:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA You're the man to ask. What's the record for consecutive subs on a card?
751203124455563265 2016-07-07 23:55:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh I'll take the bum version of Aldo, Coach.
751202753322573825 2016-07-07 23:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> https://twitter.com/JordaNotorious/status/751155526508146688  Keep this is mind as we watch #2 and #3 fight for runner up. He's the King. Not you...and not you. #UFC200
751198179308306432 2016-07-07 23:36:17 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor isn't lying when he says he'll fight Saturday. And at 202. How can any fight fan not love this guy? #UFC200
751196264658833408 2016-07-07 23:28:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @FOXSports @EliasCepeda Find your safe space, Elias, while the men enjoy the fight game.
751180419287121920 2016-07-07 22:25:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Is she ready for you? No. #AndStill #AndAgainAndAgainAndAgain
751178586967646212 2016-07-07 22:18:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @pdlmma @BipolarDana Great question.
751178395233419265 2016-07-07 22:17:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Anderson Silva vs. Daniel Cormier? Didn't see that one coming. Would rather it be Bisping. #UFC200
751119288552095744 2016-07-07 18:22:48 UTC <ScottyP922> As far as I'm concerned the main event of international fight week begins in 10 minutes. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
751118421669113856 2016-07-07 18:19:21 UTC <ScottyP922> If Bisping wants the fight why not do it? He didn't take much damage at 199. MW champ vs. LHW champ. That's 200 worthy.
751086307443703808 2016-07-07 16:11:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAssh0le And that gimmick would do a million dollar PPV. Those ladies wouldn't get half that. No promoter would do that.
751071531401355264 2016-07-07 15:13:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie He's growing but his favorite meal is still psaghetti.
751071172503240704 2016-07-07 15:11:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @mstek Not me!
751067793173479424 2016-07-07 14:58:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, could Jon Jones give McGregor and Rousey more tips on how to prepare for a fight? #UFC200
751053480626880513 2016-07-07 14:01:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Today's McGregor/Diaz press conference will just consist of Conor laughing and trying to catch his breath. #UFC200
751042326601015296 2016-07-07 13:16:59 UTC <ScottyP922> If Dana's ego can make weight maybe it can fight Cormier on Saturday. #UFC200 #ShouldBeTheMcGregorShow
751039689381941248 2016-07-07 13:06:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @Flyersrule63 Biggest draw. No promoter wouldn't do the same.
751000618962124800 2016-07-07 10:31:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAssh0le Not really. Brock is ten times the draw than either fighter.
751000311100239872 2016-07-07 10:30:01 UTC <ScottyP922> When you disrespect the King and rely on Jon Jones to main event your historic card you deserve this. #UFC200
750999482775535616 2016-07-07 10:26:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh A 3 breakfast McGregor.
750901699242438657 2016-07-06 03:58:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I can almost hear the laughter coming out of Dublin.
750901082272862208 2016-07-06 03:55:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Mark Hunt is in the main event of #UFC200   Think about that.
750900921207386113 2016-07-06 03:55:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, Dana....still think it was a good idea to keep the King off the card?   #UFC200
750887745858465792 2016-07-06 03:02:44 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm gonna punch her in the face really badly. - @joannamma #TUFFinale #UFC

750887165559734272 2016-07-06 03:00:25 UTC <ScottyP922> Gadelha showing that class she learned back home calling Joanna a little whore. #TUF23 #UFC
750878093724753920 2016-07-06 02:24:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Sad to see Hendricks so desperate to make weight that he shaved his beard.   On the flip side, he can take featherweight fights now. #UFC200
750877103600656384 2016-07-06 02:20:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Our King will be addressing his people (bums) tomorrow. Tank him. Right now. #UFC200 #UFC202
750875919900872704 2016-07-06 02:15:44 UTC <ScottyP922> It wouldn't surprise me if Aldo or Cormier retire if they lose Saturday. #UFC200
750875669060579333 2016-07-06 02:14:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Hendricks shaved his beard. Adjust your picks accordingly. #UFC200
750870893728034816 2016-07-06 01:55:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @JohnyHendricks Johny. Dude. No.
750840876419678208 2016-07-06 23:56:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Yeah but you decisioned OSP sober.
750840581459509248 2016-07-06 23:55:19 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder if this could be Cormier's last fight. #UFC200

750827091306876929 2016-07-06 23:01:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @WallyFrogmore It was good to see. He deserved it.
750826439159717888 2016-07-06 22:59:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Ariel, that was a bit of a moment when you took your turn at the presser and Jones paid you respect.

750638583275368449 2016-07-06 10:32:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanWetzel @YahooSports Nobody cares, Nate. You're a Fox undercard fighter without McGregor. Your record doesn't lie.
750637770293387264 2016-07-06 10:29:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @sagenorthcutt @ufc @Reebok @UFCFightPass Thanks, Mr. Northcutt! I'm ready too!
750526956777697280 2016-07-05 03:09:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He's got the raw sex appeal of James Dean.
750522183596867584 2016-07-05 02:50:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFC_CA Traitor.
750156232372150272 2016-07-04 02:35:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA "Hosay, start the car."
750126790341976066 2016-07-04 00:38:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani The competition is much greater at 135 than 205 and 265.   DJ over DC. But I do think Cormier is underrated.
750125692537364480 2016-07-04 00:34:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Completely disagree. Nobody puts him ahead of DJ.
750119489824362496 2016-07-04 00:09:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet Possibly the greatest tweet ever.
750114672766955521 2016-07-04 23:50:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I agree.
750112551128666112 2016-07-04 23:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Seeing Hosay beheaded twice? No man deserves that much happiness.
750108057783369728 2016-07-04 23:24:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Notice how that man was allowed to live?   He's a compassionate King.

750093222056198144 2016-07-04 22:25:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Before that Nelson/Lewis fight I feel like the UFC should make us confirm we're over 18 before viewing. #UFCVegas #BadThingsMan

750091959889461248 2016-07-04 22:20:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Would have been better with McGregor.   I know. I'm a goof. An egg. 12 followers. Cancel Fight Pass. But still.
750090950018469888 2016-07-04 22:16:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Alvarez is one bum version of Aldo away from a UFC title. #UFCVegas

749803528504442880 2016-07-03 03:14:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Can they play a laugh track when they announce the new featherweight "champion" at #UFC200? #McGregorEra #HeIsTheKing #NotYou #AndNotYou

748708825935540224 2016-06-30 02:44:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I hope for Ariel's sake the UFC wasn't planning to do this.
748705892477071360 2016-06-30 02:32:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Today was the Kindle release of @John_Kavanagh book #WinOrLearn   This is the man who trains the man who runs the entire game.
748682986888069120 2016-06-30 01:01:48 UTC <ScottyP922> On #themmabeat @jeffwagenheim actually said Nate is right on Conor's heels as a drawing star.   USADA needs to start testing these writers.
748357557786390528 2016-06-29 03:28:40 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor, Brock, Rousey.  They are the fighters who can draw outside of the MMA community. Nobody else on the roster can do it. #UFC
748355762955554816 2016-06-29 03:21:32 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm more interested in Joanna/Gadelha 2 than any fight next week. #UFC200 #TUFFinale

748223015289225216 2016-06-29 18:34:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mckeever89 @BloodyElbow What's "aggressive"? 2 fights a year?
748216215777116160 2016-06-29 18:07:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting So the guy who admittedly didn't really train for some fights is giving tips on how to prepare?  What's next? A driving lesson?
748215645884407809 2016-06-29 18:04:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz @MMAFighting Yeah it's buried out in the desert in Vegas right next to Hosay's head.
747977922443644929 2016-06-28 02:20:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Bones says he'd rather have any other ref than Big John. There must be some backstory I'm unaware of. #UFC200

747264897357123584 2016-06-26 03:06:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Joanna and Gadelha. They are their only true competition in that division. A wide gap from them to #3. #UFC
747264409974738945 2016-06-26 03:04:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Intentional hit and run. He was murdered.

744320738635689988 2016-06-18 00:07:47 UTC <ScottyP922> It's either a smiling KO or an Elias decision. #UFCOttawa
744319212244598784 2016-06-18 00:01:43 UTC <ScottyP922> It looks like Markos is bleeding profusely from the head. #UFCOttawa
744317564076068868 2016-06-18 23:55:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Markos looks like she's emptied her tank. #UFCOttawa

740223830036123652 2016-06-07 16:48:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Dana did not want to lift Ariel's ban. McGregor overruled him.   Tank him right now, @arielhelwani #UFC
740223307497115648 2016-06-07 16:46:03 UTC <ScottyP922> I expected Hosay to pull. It would be a mere 8 months since his last fight. That's like Cerrone type shit for him. #UFC200
740174813524840448 2016-06-07 13:33:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Odd for Hunt to talk like that. He usually doesn't.
740154438556344322 2016-06-07 12:12:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Happy Ariel's back but I don't see why this wouldn't happen again down the road.
740026275163701248 2016-06-06 03:43:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Good to see you and your team back.
739993910190198784 2016-06-06 01:34:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarolinaMMA @rosenamajunas @ufc @PhilipsArena So much for Rose taking a break.
739980289930342400 2016-06-06 00:40:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow When someone changes your name from Rockhold to Cockyhold like that you pretty much just admit they won.
739977693702332416 2016-06-06 00:30:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Dana will not change his mind. Neither will Lorenzo. Our only hope is this comes to the King's attention. Conor can  #FreeHelwani
739974425576144896 2016-06-06 00:17:05 UTC <ScottyP922> When Ariel said "things got physical" at some point over the last few years I assume he means he kicked the shit out of Dana White. #UFC
739951091694080000 2016-06-06 22:44:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Which will I be most looking forward to that night?  Whichever McGregor fight I choose on Fight Pass.   That man is our King. #UFC202
739886958315470848 2016-06-06 18:29:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @themmahour @evil_ecco Ill be watching later. Wouldn't miss it.
739886826924724224 2016-06-06 18:29:00 UTC <ScottyP922> It's Dana. He was the one who told Ariel he was gone. Told him to go cover Bellator.
739830417939963905 2016-06-06 14:44:51 UTC <ScottyP922> The UFC has banned Brock Lesnar for life for releasing the identity of his opponent.   #UFC200
739828321727467520 2016-06-06 14:36:31 UTC <ScottyP922> So Lesnar doesn't like getting hit and he's coming back for one fight with Mark Hunt.   I can't see how this ends badly for him. #UFC200
739789210224316416 2016-06-06 12:01:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Stay classy, Bisping.
739762224214867968 2016-06-06 10:13:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Removes his biggest star from the historic 200 card. Bans for life the biggest media member for doing job. Dana and his ego.   #FreeHelwani
739760472593956864 2016-06-06 10:06:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Ariel was never Dana's friend. #UFC #FreeHelwani
739596638059134976 2016-06-05 23:15:54 UTC <ScottyP922> It'll be hard for 200 to be a better show than 199. That was an awesome card. #UFC
739573224728633346 2016-06-05 21:42:52 UTC <ScottyP922> If Cruz and Faber can kind of half hug at the end of their fight there's hope for the Middle East. #UFC199
739555320213733376 2016-06-05 20:31:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Hold up on the Holloway love. McGregor schooled his ass on one leg. #UFC199
739551626122387457 2016-06-05 20:17:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Son, you see that man over there?  Boy: I can't look, Dad.   Son, he is a King. A KING!
739543226554667009 2016-06-05 19:43:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @Kevin_Barry Nate's options were another huge McGregor pay day or go back to making 30/30. He had no leverage.
739537084046774274 2016-06-05 19:19:15 UTC <ScottyP922> But @danawhite , Brock didn't do any promotion for #UFC200
739533801798443008 2016-06-05 19:06:12 UTC <ScottyP922> Why is #UFC200 before #UFC202?  Because you always have the prelims before the main card. #RunningTheGame #McGregorEra
739530384354992128 2016-06-05 18:52:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Pettis/Poirier.
739503418365075456 2016-06-05 17:05:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Queen feet! #JoannaChampion
739502224703950848 2016-06-05 17:00:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @NASCAR_WXMAN @DawgPoundInc Nobody will be watching on Monday.
739466347936161792 2016-06-05 14:38:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani did sit on one piece of information. Dana White is a fucking asshole. #UFC
739466090254872576 2016-06-05 14:37:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Jesus would be an underdog.   I see Conor putting on a Jiu-Jitsu clinic before finishing Nathan with a Peruvian Necktie. #UFC202
739465459012149249 2016-06-05 14:34:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @richeisen We have a bully running things.
739451020116299781 2016-06-05 13:37:16 UTC <ScottyP922> So I had a crazy dream last night that Bisping KO'd stiff Luke Rockhold. #UFC199
739450521178636290 2016-06-05 13:35:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @tommboi23 He lost UFC Tonight over McGregor/Diaz and now banned for life for breaking the Lesnar news.
739449101989859328 2016-06-05 13:29:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Basically the message the @ufc is sending @arielhelwani is you can cover our sport just don't be good at it. #UFC199
739448520294420480 2016-06-05 13:27:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @Reebok Shout out to @reebok for not allowing Bisping to bring a flag to the Octagon with messages from his fans back home. #UFC199
739332166048436224 2016-06-04 05:44:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @tommboi23 I believe this stems from reporting the first McGregor/Diaz fight.
739331461430513664 2016-06-04 05:42:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz is a wizard, McGregor is King, don't carpool with Jon Jones. Other than that I know shit about MMA. #UFC199
739329874758881284 2016-06-04 05:35:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @tommboi23 He did his job.  The same job he's been doing for years.
739324978924027905 2016-06-04 05:16:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @allelbows @ekc @arielhelwani Dana's bully tactics strikes again. Just sad.
739324443944755208 2016-06-04 05:14:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani That's complete bullshit. I'm sorry that happened but you know the way he operates. He's a bully.
739322687227584512 2016-06-04 05:07:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Maybe now Rockhold will be a little more humble.   Nothing I can't stand more than a cocky fighter.   Conor McGregor is King. #UFC199
739321034629894144 2016-06-04 05:00:45 UTC <ScottyP922> One of the great moments in UFC history. Not only did he do it, he did it on short notice. #UFC199
739320644626710528 2016-06-04 04:59:12 UTC <ScottyP922> It's your turn next month, DC. No more belts for AKA. #UFC200
739319837596487681 2016-06-04 04:55:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Bisping/Weidman in NYC.   Shout out to @ChrisWeidmanUFC. He must have enjoyed that. #UFC199
739319279460483072 2016-06-04 04:53:46 UTC <ScottyP922> MMA makes no sense. #UFC199
739318230066581504 2016-06-04 04:49:36 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm so happy for Bisping. Now a Champion after all those wars. #UFC199
739317967511531525 2016-06-04 04:48:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Holy fucking shit! #UFC199
739311959120728064 2016-06-04 04:24:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg LOL
739311846918893569 2016-06-04 04:24:14 UTC <ScottyP922> According to the UFC, if Faber wants to fight again he'll have to get a Reebok tattoo on his ass. #UFC199
739310695322357764 2016-06-04 04:19:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Just out classed. Cruz had an answer for everything. 50-45. #UFC199
739310432876433408 2016-06-04 04:18:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Herb could be a little more subtle checking out Faber's ass. #UFC199
739309168079863808 2016-06-04 04:13:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Every corner should have an angry Asian. #UFC199
739307063818485760 2016-06-04 04:05:14 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz is a f'n wizard. #UFC199
739302369582845952 2016-06-04 03:46:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Who else mimics Cruz's pre-fight little dance? #UFC199
739301579958984704 2016-06-04 03:43:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @AndreasHale @sherdogdotcom Yes
739301315545817088 2016-06-04 03:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Brock battled diverticulitis in his first UFC stint. Hopefully he's completely healthy and we see what he's really capable of. #UFC200
739300795548618752 2016-06-04 03:40:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @MMAFighting The nose knows.
739300705681432576 2016-06-04 03:39:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz KO or Faber by decision.   What? #UFC199
739300316013809664 2016-06-04 03:38:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheSavageTruth @sherdogdotcom Wow

739293263732039680 2016-06-04 03:10:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @AidanRitchie27 Every fight Conor's in is where the money is. He doesn't need Nate for that. Nate needs him.
739293116088352768 2016-06-04 03:09:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @willvelida You're preaching to the choir. At least McGregor is active. Aldo just didn't want to fight.
739292808486477824 2016-06-04 03:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Max Holloway kissing some random woman and her kid on his way to the cage.  A little out of line if you ask me. #UFC199
739292499785752576 2016-06-04 03:07:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Conrad McGillicutty up next. #UFC199
739292103486898177 2016-06-04 03:05:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @MMAFighting Save the tickets. They'll be collector's items.
739291345592954880 2016-06-04 03:02:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate Diaz. Street trash. #UFC199 #FStockton
739290545013596160 2016-06-04 02:59:35 UTC <ScottyP922> At his age, if Hendo wants to keep going for the headkick KO he's going to have to fight Chad Mendes next. Then maybe Rin Nakai. #UFC199
739289432256315392 2016-06-04 02:55:10 UTC <ScottyP922> You'll be changing that man's diaper and he'll KO you stiff with an errant hand movement. #UFC199
739288976843022337 2016-06-04 02:53:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Are you fucking kidding me?! #UFC199
739285988606922753 2016-06-04 02:41:29 UTC <ScottyP922> This. Will. Be. Ugly. #UFC199
739285807123574785 2016-06-04 02:40:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Hendo coming to the cage next. This will be the UFC's first walker out. #UFC199
739283461903507456 2016-06-04 02:31:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Who do you have in the main and co main? I know you're rooting for Cruz.
739283121401692161 2016-06-04 02:30:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Went as expected. Green thinks he's Anderson Silva in his prime but doesn't have the skill to pull it off.
739282919169085440 2016-06-04 02:29:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMcGregorFans @TeamMcGregorUFC @TheNotoriousMMA @TheMcgregorFans @ConorMcGreggor They must be the greatest!
739282554403094532 2016-06-04 02:27:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg I wanted to retweet this but can't.
739282158133620736 2016-06-04 02:26:16 UTC <ScottyP922> It's party time in the back ass of nowhere. Their pinhead did it. #UFC199
739280964791246848 2016-06-04 02:21:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Green fights like an idiot. #UFC199
739277332880457728 2016-06-04 02:07:05 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder if Dustin's cousin Cletus will walk him out tonight? #UFC199
739276571031306240 2016-06-04 02:04:04 UTC <ScottyP922> It's not the first time he's come back from defeat like that.
739275320067563521 2016-06-04 01:59:06 UTC <ScottyP922> God's fighters are having a good night. #UFC199
739275192917233664 2016-06-04 01:58:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Herb Dean isn't much of a striker. Guida was wide open for a kill shot there. #UFC199
739274809834622976 2016-06-04 01:57:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Ortega is like the comeback kid. #UFC199
739266380478992384 2016-06-04 01:23:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Apparently God hates James Vick. #UFC199
739266013548695552 2016-06-04 01:22:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Oh it's cool, guys. God wanted him to knock him out. #UFC199 #ThankYouJesus
739263758900559872 2016-06-04 01:13:09 UTC <ScottyP922> I haven't gotten one right yet! How about you?
739260770232487937 2016-06-04 01:01:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Lesnar/CM Punk #UFC200. They're working on the finish.
739260344074416128 2016-06-04 00:59:35 UTC <ScottyP922> The ref is mercifully shielding my picks from the results. #UFC199
739259488444817408 2016-06-04 00:56:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Andrade looks natural and feminine. #UFC199
739257721267052544 2016-06-04 00:49:10 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-9 Penne #UFC199
739256241701199872 2016-06-04 00:43:17 UTC <ScottyP922> With Conor fighting Nate in August that means he'll go about a year at least before defending that belt should he not vacate it. #UFC202
739252558598930432 2016-06-04 00:28:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @NateDiaz209 @MMAFighting So Nate was holding out for a chance to smack Dana.
739251529618759680 2016-06-04 00:24:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @RJcliffordMMA @sherdogdotcom No

739248957885415424 2016-06-04 00:14:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Helwani dropping some nugs tonight. Who needs that TV show?
739248504661508105 2016-06-04 00:12:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Against a 4 breakfast McGregor?
739233893866438661 2016-06-04 23:14:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow If you did a Vivi with Casey you would have to like totally carry the 2nd half of the show.
739230468839735296 2016-06-04 23:00:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Casey is already fading bad.

739226866695954432 2016-06-04 22:46:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow If it goes past the first round it's Elvis.
739225467199295488 2016-06-04 22:41:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Good luck beating that out for fight of the night. #UFC199
739223113360146432 2016-06-04 22:31:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow  Pretty uneventful 1st round but the feeling out process should be over. #UFC199
739222231868428288 2016-06-04 22:28:08 UTC <ScottyP922> What a start to the card! #UFC199
739222091065610241 2016-06-04 22:27:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Fun game while you watch. See if you can predict the shorts colors before each fight. #UFC199
739220019993804800 2016-06-04 22:19:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Another night of the toughest athletes on the planet on display. Respect to all. Make your Irish King proud. #UFC199
739219394233008128 2016-06-04 22:16:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow Good point. That's a wild card.
739219049217990656 2016-06-04 22:15:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow if we did have one new champion tonight who has the better chance at it?
739191909911023618 2016-06-04 20:27:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Or you want to compete against the best.
739191798891970560 2016-06-04 20:27:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Lamas is rubbish. He should be cut.
739058552048865280 2016-06-04 11:37:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Conor get up and say you're sorry.
739056203209310209 2016-06-04 11:28:24 UTC <ScottyP922> There's still time to stop this Lombard/ Hendo fight. We don't need to see this. #UFC199
738916367777300480 2016-06-03 02:12:45 UTC <ScottyP922> If you caught the replay of #UFC194 tonight you saw Conor warned him there was a "tunderstorm" coming.   You've been tunderstruck, Hosay.
738915565377626112 2016-06-03 02:09:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Looking forward to seeing Dustin's little pinhead out there tomorrow.   He's a quiet little hillbilly from the backass of nowhere. #UFC199
738903824539258880 2016-06-03 01:22:54 UTC <ScottyP922> "As long as I'm around, Conor McGregor will never be champion." - Hosay Aldo  Hosay, wake up. You lied to me. #UFC
738903535753023488 2016-06-03 01:21:45 UTC <ScottyP922> They're replaying #UFC194 on FS2 right now.   That's fight porn for me.
738903302134505472 2016-06-03 01:20:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Felicia by sub. Feed that woman.
738880143414992896 2016-06-03 23:48:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @NateDiaz209 @DanaUnleashed @RichardPerez209 @andreward @Seckbach @OscarDeLaHoya @YouTube Nate Diaz: Floyd would beat Nick.   Good to know.
738878690164101121 2016-06-03 23:43:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey maybe they can fight in the morning too and just act it out later on PPV. #UFC199
738878412241182720 2016-06-03 23:41:55 UTC <ScottyP922> You can tell Luke Rockhold can't stand that Conor McGregor is sexier than he is. #UFC199
738877636412342272 2016-06-03 23:38:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Does Faber make weight with a full chin? #UFC199
738876743424090114 2016-06-03 23:35:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Hard not to root for him.
738869910198226944 2016-06-03 23:08:08 UTC <ScottyP922> So basically we know they all made weight but now we get to watch them pretend to weigh in.  Riveting. #UFC199
738794542636269568 2016-06-03 18:08:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Congrats. You should start bragging about running the MMA media game and call your colleagues bums.
738677317061378048 2016-06-03 10:22:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @thirdwavefem So beautiful and empowering. #IStandWiththirdwavefem
738575551812804608 2016-06-02 03:38:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @NewYorkRic @arielhelwani LOL
738567504117805056 2016-06-02 03:06:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA King, the UFC requests you don't tweet this weekend so people pay attention to #UFC199.  #KingMac #McGregorEra
738553485029965824 2016-06-02 02:10:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I'm such a big fan of Joanna that I'm able to spell like half of her last name. #UFC
738542206298906624 2016-06-02 01:25:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChrisWeidmanUFC @LaMonicaMark Best of luck to you, Champ. Ignore the naysayers. You do. They talk. Get well soon.
738538135433400320 2016-06-02 01:09:47 UTC <ScottyP922> I can not root for the Cavs because they have a player who has the audacity to call himself the King. #NBAFinals #McGregorEra
738537835435839489 2016-06-02 01:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Bisping/McGregor interim title.
738529088961449984 2016-06-02 00:33:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Go Sharks.
738527800362176513 2016-06-02 00:28:43 UTC <ScottyP922> You could say Rockhold is making excuses or that he's so confident that he doesn't care if Bisping knows about the injury. #UFC199
738526880794578944 2016-06-02 00:25:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Dustin became a better fighter once he woke up and realized it's not all talk.
738526554746195968 2016-06-02 00:23:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Was that press conference closed to the public? Because if not, aiyeee. What a difference without the King. #UFC199
738526262424129536 2016-06-02 00:22:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Rockhold announcing his knee injury in the presser today is either the act of an insecure fighter or a total badass. Not sure which. #UFC199
738522088533860352 2016-06-02 00:06:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Coach K is like the calming influence in between rounds. Always getting his fighters relaxed. Then comes the technical advice
738520517926342656 2016-06-02 23:59:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Tank me right now, Cole!
738511123411042304 2016-06-02 23:22:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc #AndStill X 2
738435573522833408 2016-06-02 18:22:14 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd have more respect for Frankie Edgar if he stopped ducking Conor McGregor. #UFC199
738432751406305280 2016-06-02 18:11:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottyP922 Wait. He did that to Mendes too.   He's the one who can ride all the rides at the amusement park that got embarrassed on 1 leg.
738432453816295424 2016-06-02 18:09:51 UTC <ScottyP922> Holloway, the 2nd best FW on the planet, is fighting this weekend.   You remember him. He's the one the King embarrassed on 1 leg. #UFC199
738431762267787264 2016-06-02 18:07:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @CatLaughsComedy @John_Kavanagh My favorite comic is Hosay Aldo. That line about running thru Conor like a truck gets me every time.
738431333865771008 2016-06-02 18:05:24 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor last fought in March. He's yet to be booked for his next fight.   This is the UFC's version of the offseason. #UFC #McGregorEra
738364190675603456 2016-06-02 13:38:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @thirdwavefem You make me ashamed to be a man.
738336187526598657 2016-06-02 11:47:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @WallyFrogmore I'd love it.
738328823545139200 2016-06-02 11:18:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Sweet baby Jesus still learning shapes and colors, please let Michael Bisping land a fluke punch and KO stiff Luke Rockhold. #UFC199 #AndNew
738212006365433856 2016-06-01 03:33:52 UTC <ScottyP922> The judges screw Team Joanna. Team Steroids up 6-0. #TUF23
738194327478865921 2016-06-01 02:23:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He could have picked a different color but yeah.
738193034681126912 2016-06-01 02:18:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie If he does it'll be one of the greatest moments in UFC history.
738163887246180353 2016-06-01 00:22:39 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC200 still has an open slot to fill.   Do the right thing @danawhite and save your card. McGregor or bust.
738163007927111680 2016-06-01 00:19:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Team Joanna gets their first win over Team Steroids tonight. #TUF23
738162115421184000 2016-06-01 00:15:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow The first time Conor hits him the fight is over.
738161833131921409 2016-06-01 00:14:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow It'd be like trying to swat a gnat for McGregor.
738161325235265536 2016-06-01 00:12:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Sure, it looks friendly but that man has a plan to take her out if need be.
738160537565958145 2016-06-01 00:09:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeDevlin1 Tonight, right before you fall asleep, if you look to your side you will see a King.   A KING!!   #KingMac
738159311189245953 2016-06-01 00:04:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg I liked it because I know how you feel.
737964747459420161 2016-06-01 11:11:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You are not fooling anyone walking around without a crown on your head.   You are a f'n King. #McGregorEra
737829993502388224 2016-05-31 02:15:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Watching Cruz/Faber 2 and I forgot how well Faber fared in that fight. #UFC199
737827766540849153 2016-05-31 02:07:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Conor, Dee called. You left your glasses in the driveway and she can't get the car out to the road.
737826667721265152 2016-05-31 02:02:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove You get all the chicks, bro.
737826215512444929 2016-05-31 02:00:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @LukeRockhold @ChrisWeidmanUFC So bummed these two aren't fighting this week.
737802407019585536 2016-05-31 00:26:16 UTC <ScottyP922> Cruz wins all 5 rounds. 50-45 across the board. #UFC199
737801951467819008 2016-05-31 00:24:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource That's the way I saw it. He carried too much weight and gassed. He was pummeling that piece of street trash up to then.
737800369137430528 2016-05-31 00:18:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @NewYorkRic Ariel doing the MMA Hour in a Cavs uniform would be epic.   But he will win that bet, my friend
737799377004138496 2016-05-31 00:14:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc For the first 12 seconds your King would agree with you, Urijah.
737790783835766784 2016-05-31 23:40:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX Oh shit.
737790420369969156 2016-05-31 23:38:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Is she sharing her steroids with her team?
737673765165912064 2016-05-31 15:55:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Sadly, Rockhold finishes Bisping again.   And I'll go out in a limb and say Cruz takes a decision.
737665690790965248 2016-05-31 15:23:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Bryan Caraway a top 5 bantamweight? What the hell's going on here?!
737665316193505280 2016-05-31 15:21:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Don't know that that proves a chin issue. He got starched. The difference in hand speed was the story to me.
737655947439525888 2016-05-31 14:44:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @antontabuena @BloodyElbow @MMA_PLAYBYPLAY He's not in it to make friends. He doesn't give a F what any of us think.
737655762382655489 2016-05-31 14:43:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @JCDollarsign They title it that way so you'll read it.
737655268759207937 2016-05-31 14:41:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cody_Nolove @ChrisWeidmanUFC Just throwing this out there.  "McGregor" on your midsection would be pretty sweet.
737481209824092160 2016-05-30 03:09:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I love how Bisping's son always picks against his dad whenever he's on Embedded. #UFC199
737295809432195072 2016-05-30 14:53:13 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm sure TJ's  going to want a title shot next fight but a fight with Garbrandt is probably the best you can make in the division. #UFCVegas
737294271741464576 2016-05-30 14:47:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Garbrandt looked like a straight killer last night. Hard to believe that's the same guy who fought Brimage. #UFCVegas
737137398941900801 2016-05-29 04:23:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria I'm looking to get his ass kicked, Nick. He laid hands on our King.
737136326974267393 2016-05-29 04:19:30 UTC <ScottyP922> I'd love to see Dillashaw/Garbrandt. #UFCVegas
737134916102696962 2016-05-29 04:13:53 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm telling you. The key to being a great MMA fighter is a good neck tattoo. #UFCVegas
737134276949467136 2016-05-29 04:11:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow. #UFCVegas
737131975622963200 2016-05-29 04:02:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Would you say Garbrandt has the edge in hand speed though?
737131460478545924 2016-05-29 04:00:10 UTC <ScottyP922> Thomas Almeida looks like the last guy Liam Neeson would have to kill in a Taken movie. #UFCVegas
737129207952723968 2016-05-29 03:51:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Really tough fight to score.   Wait. One of them is Brazilian.   30-24 Stephens. #UFCVegas
737114659099021312 2016-05-29 02:53:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Yep. Those layoffs make picking these fights a crap shoot sometimes.
737113656949919745 2016-05-29 02:49:25 UTC <ScottyP922> Isn't it cute seeing the UFC trying to promote 200 without McGregor?  No King means it's the prelims. #UFCVegas
737088993230213121 2016-05-29 01:11:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @GrabakaHitman He's like the Brazilian Rory MacDonald.
737087239931461632 2016-05-29 01:04:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @FS1 @danawhite There's still time to shave, Dana.
737087067885309952 2016-05-29 01:03:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Or if she just tattooed her last name on her belly?
737086215145574400 2016-05-29 01:00:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh The women have the better good fight ratio.
737085857732165632 2016-05-29 00:58:57 UTC <ScottyP922> It's hard to believe that and McGregor are the same sport. #UFCVegas
737085452805627905 2016-05-29 00:57:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow She wants a title fight, Zane. Remember that in your fights to make.
737083860643680256 2016-05-29 00:51:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Cleveland: No! We suck again! #UFCVegas
737083389199667200 2016-05-29 00:49:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Remember when the UFC tried selling Eye as a threat to Rousey?  Good times. #UFCVegas
737082178081853444 2016-05-29 00:44:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Could we possibly stop this fight and restart it in the pocket? #UFCVegas
737081553629675520 2016-05-29 00:41:51 UTC <ScottyP922> The fans lost that round. #UFCVegas
737080608678129664 2016-05-29 00:38:06 UTC <ScottyP922> They need to be more careful. #UFCVegas
737080231115272192 2016-05-29 00:36:36 UTC <ScottyP922> I've got McMann getting the win here because she should be more desperate for a W. #UFCVegas
737057060500742144 2016-05-29 23:04:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Dont be anathema, Zane.
737056321338499072 2016-05-29 23:01:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Agree or disagree - That fight shows the flaws in the scoring system?
737055902323355648 2016-05-29 22:59:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Anytime I see Tate or Caraway with any hint of joy on their face I gag a little. #UFCVegas
737050320686206976 2016-05-29 22:37:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @orlaghhunter @John_Kavanagh Roll your sleeves up, Coach.   She predicts these tings.
737048016327180288 2016-05-29 22:28:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Same but I can't shake the feeling Caraway can steal this.
737047724583968769 2016-05-29 22:27:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @NASCAR Time to pull the plug on that 5 team.
737047085615357953 2016-05-29 22:24:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Megan Olivi just asked Miesha Tate how she keeps Bryan Caraway grounded. #UFCVegas
737046592243535872 2016-05-29 22:22:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I totally didn't have to look up the word anathema.
737045849264521217 2016-05-29 22:19:58 UTC <ScottyP922> I hate watching two fighters point fighting like this. #UFCVegas

736722862019629057 2016-05-28 00:56:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Watched Dillashaw/Cruz for like the 10th time.   Cruz is a f'n wizard. There will never be another like him. #UFC
736720620713586688 2016-05-28 00:47:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA It takes more than that to wear those glasses.   This man just doesn't give a fuck.
736712564244140032 2016-05-28 00:15:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom An undeserved title shot.

736700903563141120 2016-05-28 23:29:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Did you see it? Barao practically ran into him before Stephens shoved him.

736373417671327744 2016-05-27 01:47:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Still bummed we lost Rockhold/Weidman 2. That was the fight I was most looking forward to. #UFC199
736358978389708800 2016-05-27 00:50:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Almeida smokes Garbrandt. Cruz schools Faber.   It will not be a good week for Team Alpha Male. #UFCVegas #UFC199
736335345235677184 2016-05-27 23:16:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Thomas Almeida is a monster. Cody Garbrandt is once ever.

735973091164205057 2016-05-26 23:17:13 UTC <ScottyP922> I would LOVE to see Bisping beat Rockhold.   Not happening. #UFC199
735805086987780096 2016-05-26 12:09:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Holy shit is Nate as dumb as a box of rocks.
735626759585079297 2016-05-25 00:21:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @YoungZachMorris Which amounts to jack shit in terms of PPV numbers for Nate.
735619260626685953 2016-05-25 23:51:13 UTC <ScottyP922> These Diaz fans are delusional. You'd think Nate Diaz was some huge PPV draw over his career. Check his record. #UFC
735618709885227008 2016-05-25 23:49:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @benmiller Nate needs Conor to get paid. Conor doesn't need Nate. He could fight a broomstick to huge PPV numbers.
735618312697176065 2016-05-25 23:47:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @benmiller Hey, Ben....kindly show me where in Nate's career that he drew big numbers?
735607286232649728 2016-05-25 23:03:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor can move on to another fight and make millions. Nate will be fighting for 40/40. #UFC #McGregorEra #FuckNateDiaz
735440826327785472 2016-05-25 12:02:11 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor would have won. #UFC #DWTSFinale #TakingOverTheDanceGame
735250458168659968 2016-05-24 23:25:44 UTC <ScottyP922> Garbrandt put his bum hands on our King. This will be one of the rare times I root for a Brazilian.   Off with his head. #UFCFightNight88

734523367307513857 2016-05-22 23:16:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I have to admit. I didn't give him any chance to win his last fight. Thought he'd get murked.
734523012268077057 2016-05-22 23:15:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee The average wonderlic score of 1st RB taken in the draft the last 10 years - 17.2   Zeke scored a 32.

734509192946548736 2016-05-22 22:20:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow At one time he called Aldo a great fighter and Conor a great personality.   Hey, @joerogan? Is your great fighter awake yet?
734214345522085888 2016-05-21 02:48:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom For the love of God.

734190325158273024 2016-05-21 01:13:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Wait until Frankie finds out Conor decided to drop down to Women's Bantamweight.   Hide all sharp objects. #UFCpic.twitter.com/CoH6BF48tT
734189009824518144 2016-05-21 01:07:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Okay. Conor's taking this super fights thing a little too far now. #UFC #McGregorEra #TheWhateverTheFHeWantsLifepic.twitter.com/OGYTSBtWru

734166594327314432 2016-05-21 23:38:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @NASCAR Put it in the memory bank. The first chance you get to punt the 42 take it.
734165751846801410 2016-05-21 23:35:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @lheron @thirdwavefem I see a building built by men, electricity provided by men, food delivered by men with laptops invented by men. You?

733830122067759104 2016-05-20 01:21:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut @ZBelicaIRL Dana doesn't hate anyone as much as he loves money.
733830060692623361 2016-05-20 01:21:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut @ZBelicaIRL If Diaz fights draw ratings why hasn't Nate ever headlines a PPV that didn't involve McGregor? He's a Fox fighter.
733811070574432264 2016-05-20 00:06:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @stipemiocicufc @ufc @Browns Really good to see. Stipe is good people. Well done, Champ. They can never take it away from you.
733809422963736576 2016-05-20 23:59:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN @JoshYandle I agree with that. But he can't get the big pay day anywhere else. Conor can.
733806406550228993 2016-05-20 23:47:35 UTC <ScottyP922> When Nate Diaz fights Conor McGregor he's a draw. When he doesn't he's on FS1. Check the record. #UFC
733805369840050177 2016-05-20 23:43:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN He wants Conor treatment without, ya know, being 1/10th the revenue generator.
733803038750695424 2016-05-20 23:34:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnyHendricks And here I thought she married you for your beard.
733802796059873280 2016-05-20 23:33:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Not surprised. I'm guessing Nate thinks he's a draw. The FS1 fighter has a warped view of his worth.
733802482837639169 2016-05-20 23:31:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That's ridiculous.   How could they include any other fighters with Conor McGregor?
733721325316001793 2016-05-20 18:09:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow As opposed to Gilbert's approach. PEDs.
733640906809692161 2016-05-20 12:49:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Ah, so that's how it works. Coach sees them, tells Conor who then predicts those tings.
733639246511247365 2016-05-20 12:43:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @Kenny_Mayne @SportsCenter The King has spoken.   Kenny, do you feel like your bum life has changed?
733637922356879360 2016-05-20 12:38:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani What a joke.
733493706389622785 2016-05-19 03:05:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Totally. ~twirling hair~
733466375268638720 2016-05-19 01:16:25 UTC <ScottyP922> So the return of the supposed GOAT did as high as a 450k buy rate for #UFC197  Insert Conor laugh here. #UFConor #McGregorEra

733096686084628480 2016-05-18 00:47:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Anybody else think Conor got snubbed for this MW title shot?  He'd take Luke's head clean off.  #UFC199
733093300320763904 2016-05-18 00:33:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @bisping I would have hated to see you end your career without a title shot. Congrats. Long overdue.
733082883938738177 2016-05-18 23:52:34 UTC <ScottyP922> You are old school!
733081558551285760 2016-05-18 23:47:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Who are your favorite fighters, Maria?   Besides our King Mr. McGregor. Who I'm sure you have a tattoo of.
733076848352055296 2016-05-18 23:28:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Sure, I'd rather he have a full camp but Bisping deserves that title shot. Take it while it's there. #UFC199
733075864917790721 2016-05-18 23:24:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani It's a strain. Ice. Ibuprofen. #TingsConorSays

732699016773898240 2016-05-17 22:27:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani First name that came to mind. It would be a damn shame if he never fought for a title. Let's do this.
732698392078520323 2016-05-17 22:24:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @EliasTheodorou Now you do yours. "I may lose my work ethic but I will NEVER lose my hair!"
732698086104010752 2016-05-17 22:23:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Whenever a fight falls apart I remind myself how much more it sucks for the fighters.   This is a brutal sport. #UFC199
732660751555559424 2016-05-17 19:55:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @TalkMMA That would SUCK.
732028934250975233 2016-05-15 02:04:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Stipe/Cain would be a sick fight.
732027266008530946 2016-05-15 01:57:55 UTC <ScottyP922> That Cyborg stoppage was early but we all know Smith would have taken a brutal beating if it continued. #UFC198

731848598363766785 2016-05-15 14:07:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Yeah your moment to call out Ronda in the UFC Octagon.
731844499673104385 2016-05-15 13:51:40 UTC <ScottyP922> No one can take that right hand shot. #StoneColdStipe #UFC198
731819486026838016 2016-05-15 12:12:16 UTC <ScottyP922> Did Werdum train at Glendale Fighting Club for this fight by any chance? #BeautifulWorkChamp #UFC198
731818488835260416 2016-05-15 12:08:18 UTC <ScottyP922> My all time favorite comedies...  1. Dumb and Dumber 2. Werdum getting stiffened by Stipe in Brazil.   ~Conor laugh~  #UFC198 #McGregorEra
731817768723582976 2016-05-15 12:05:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg You must have been exhausted.   We need to make sure this doesn't happen when our King is fighting.
731816972019748864 2016-05-15 12:02:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @JacareMMA Yes. But if Weidman beats Rockhold in a really close fight I wouldn't be against a rubber match.
731816621862486016 2016-05-15 12:00:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Werdum fought a dumb fight last night. #UFC198
731686028210278401 2016-05-14 03:21:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I just want to see Cyborg step up and finish a fight. Tired of the decisions.
731685742980804608 2016-05-14 03:20:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow And this is @ScottyP922 here responding to some of your tweets.
731684751803846656 2016-05-14 03:16:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie I thought Mo won that fight.
731684189569978370 2016-05-14 03:14:39 UTC <ScottyP922> If they still have a pulse at the end, the Brazilian's getting the decision. #UFC198
731680807664951296 2016-05-14 03:01:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Happens every card.
731679601789939712 2016-05-14 02:56:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom They should all be arrested.
731676671024214016 2016-05-14 02:44:46 UTC <ScottyP922> Very surprised Barbarena beat Alves. I guess I've been underrating him. #UFC198

731663325776494593 2016-05-14 01:51:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Good call, young lady!
731663146461626368 2016-05-14 01:51:02 UTC <ScottyP922> This fight settles it. The two best Jiu-jitsu practitioners in the UFC are Demian Maia and Conor McGregor. #UFC198
731659276494774272 2016-05-14 01:35:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Those classy Brazilians. #UFC198
731658872629366785 2016-05-14 01:34:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow You're reading my mind.
731658136080289792 2016-05-14 01:31:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Prepare to be molested, Mr. Brown. And he won't call the next day either. #UFC198
731655221575712768 2016-05-14 01:19:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Could they possibly show a replay of Aldo/McGregor on the big screen between fights? Too much Brazil happiness for me. #UFC198
731651293001994243 2016-05-14 01:03:56 UTC <ScottyP922> I have the fans winning that fight. #UFC198
731650435031965696 2016-05-14 01:00:31 UTC <ScottyP922> These guys are fighting too conservatively. #UFC198
731647660243992576 2016-05-14 00:49:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Patrick Cummins is wobbling backstage from this onslaught. #UFC198
731641506268876800 2016-05-14 00:25:02 UTC <ScottyP922> It's like Font is more concerned with surviving than winning the fight. #UFC198
731639409569869825 2016-05-14 00:16:43 UTC <ScottyP922> I think he needs to retire. He shouldn't take any more head shots.
731635510653779973 2016-05-14 00:01:13 UTC <ScottyP922> It's been several fights now. He does not handle punches well at all.
731633658596077572 2016-05-14 23:53:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting He has the look of a guy who needs to get out now.
731632511026135040 2016-05-14 23:49:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Little Nog calling his competitors bums, he runs the fight game and a bunch of other classless shit. #UFC198
731631944753131521 2016-05-14 23:47:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Cummins needs to find another occupation. A shot fighter just lit him up. #UFC198
731623357242855424 2016-05-14 23:12:55 UTC <ScottyP922> How does Reebok come up with all these crazy shorts designs? #UFC198
731623078652968960 2016-05-14 23:11:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Nothing gets me more ready for a fist fight than Happy from Pharrell Williams. #UFC198
731621949315633153 2016-05-14 23:07:20 UTC <ScottyP922> I got the Brazilian in this fight. #UFC198
731618340960124931 2016-05-14 22:52:59 UTC <ScottyP922> I have no idea who's winning this fight. #UFC198
731616835221770241 2016-05-14 22:47:00 UTC <ScottyP922> I think he tried to drop the people's elbow there. #UFC198
731615496886439936 2016-05-14 22:41:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @illwillbrooks86 I would pay for that one.
731615110456877056 2016-05-14 22:40:09 UTC <ScottyP922> The two best MMA crowds are the Irish and the Brazilians. Nothing like those cards. #UFC198
731611907778564096 2016-05-14 22:27:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Time to head to Fight Pass.  ....and watch some of Conor's past fights. #UFC198
731611598578651136 2016-05-14 22:26:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow Zane I bet my life savings on all your picks tonight. Thanks for the can't miss opportunity.
731604803428749313 2016-05-14 21:59:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @FloydMayweather @SHOsports Of course he's no pushover. He's a King. They don't just hand those titles out to anyone.
731600824883924993 2016-05-14 21:43:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys @EzekielElliott Zeke, I can not tell you how stoked I am that you are a Dallas Cowboy. Feels like destiny.
731599853638291456 2016-05-14 21:39:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @EzekielElliott Doggy thought bubble - Holy shit, you're Ezekiel Elliott!
731550584566874112 2016-05-14 18:23:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I believe God's arms are too short to box with our King. I see Floyd taking a very early nap.
731523425685143552 2016-05-14 16:35:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Happy Birthday, Urijah. Dominick Cruz is going to give you a lesson for Christmas. Hope you like it.
731521888409812992 2016-05-14 16:29:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA He wants to help the bums in boxing too. This man just gives and gives and  gives. #UFC #Boxing #BumRelief #KingMac
731521373898674180 2016-05-14 16:27:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA It used to be Don King. Now it's the Don King.
731443411681705984 2016-05-14 11:17:53 UTC <ScottyP922> Lineker says he's never even heard of Rob Font.   Bro. You should check out MMA sometime. You might like it. #UFC198
731442389517225984 2016-05-14 11:13:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @ConormcGregor5 Now show me the fight, Floyd, where McGregor doesn't throw any kicks.   You aint got the balls to do it MMA
731441164570796032 2016-05-14 11:08:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Sharp dressed man.
731441064524025856 2016-05-14 11:08:33 UTC <ScottyP922> There is a wide gap between MMA striking and boxing. See Rousey/Holm for reference. #UFC
731440357091708929 2016-05-14 11:05:45 UTC <ScottyP922> So if Cyborg Steroids can make 139 looking okay what was all that hesitation about 135 to face Ronda? It would kill her, remember? #UFC198
731439059885772801 2016-05-14 11:00:36 UTC <ScottyP922> It's in Curitiba instead of Rio because Conor McGregor owns that river. Wouldn't clear it. #UFC198 #KingMac #McGregorEra
731252625690202112 2016-05-13 22:39:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Wait...so the Sixers used to actually play meaningful games?
731248128335183873 2016-05-13 22:21:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Not just lose, destroyed in seconds.   A wise man once said that you don't have to like it but you are forced to accept it.
731246236431454209 2016-05-13 22:14:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah but I'm hoping for peace in the Middle East too.   Dead woman walking.
731240674151026688 2016-05-13 21:52:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Hoping Stipe, thinking Werdum. #UFC198
731239808538955776 2016-05-13 21:48:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Cyborg makes me sick to look at. So obviously chemically enhanced over the years in a combat sport. #UFC198
731238860999512064 2016-05-13 21:45:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Alves is going to murk Barberena. His 15 minutes of Northcutt fame are up. #UFC198
731185191218188293 2016-05-13 18:11:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Isn't this the first Brazilian to pop?
731184362964832257 2016-05-13 18:08:31 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't think a single fight on the main card will be competitive. #UFC198
731182347245223937 2016-05-13 18:00:30 UTC <ScottyP922> I think I'd prefer McGregor give up 170, a fight with Floyd and go back to being the baddest 145er on the planet. #UFC
730942271605116928 2016-05-12 02:06:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Congrats to the Bruglers. This man will soon not have the time for the NFL Draft.
730910539711430657 2016-05-12 00:00:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Isn't it cute how the UFC promotes this Jacare/Vitor fight as a competitive contest? #UFC198
730828798158098432 2016-05-12 18:35:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @dallascowboys Could you be a dove and ask him when the team's getting a real GM and VP of Personnel?
730828432548859904 2016-05-12 18:34:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc With a lawsuit after the fight?
730828235840327680 2016-05-12 18:33:24 UTC <ScottyP922> You guys don't get it.   See, Werdum makes a stupid face.   And. It. Is. Funny.  Oh, my sides!  #UFC
730827327198924800 2016-05-12 18:29:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite So you dine with Kings now?   If you're on his left side do not ask him to pass the salt. It's too dangerous. #UFC

730589253940482050 2016-05-11 02:43:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom It's a tougher fight for BJ, IMO.

730216582186557440 2016-05-10 02:02:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Just reported Bigfoot Silva was KO'd stiff tonight by a visiting fan at ATT. #UFC
730212081710944259 2016-05-10 01:45:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor McGregor can't believe Anderson Silva pulled out because of a stomach ache.  Flat soda. Rest. Pepto Bismol. #UFC198
730187358180610049 2016-05-10 00:06:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor has a falling out with Dana Lorenzo and Uncle Frank and now the Fertittas are selling the #UFC  This isn't a coincidence. #McGregorEra
730098111037775874 2016-05-10 18:12:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Did those death threats toward our King have to be translated from Portuguese by any chance? #UFC
729999912302186496 2016-05-10 11:41:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @FloydMayweather If you have real balls you'll fight this man in true unarmed combat. #MMA #McGregorEra
729834639414693888 2016-05-09 00:45:12 UTC <ScottyP922> He whoops people for truckloads of cash.  And then comes home to this.   A King's life. #UFC #McGregorErapic.twitter.com/IQnwetzDLW

729832166771830784 2016-05-09 00:35:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee I just have one question please. Did you have a feeling Zeke was going to Dallas when you arrived at the draft that Thursday?
729808333281038336 2016-05-09 23:00:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @stipemiocicufc @ufc Good luck.
729808038559948800 2016-05-09 22:59:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh Did it come with a sleeping Aldo?
729662178349993985 2016-05-09 13:19:54 UTC <ScottyP922> If Bigfoot Silva wants to keep fighting, the #UFC needs to make sure it's someplace else.
729480014400458752 2016-05-08 01:16:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @PearseGUY And Werdum was KO'd by JDS.   Fingers crossed. This man spoke the King's name in vain. His toes must curl.
729474632936505344 2016-05-08 00:54:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @PearseGUY I hope so. Werdum's striking has been surprisingly good the last few fights though.
729473567419707392 2016-05-08 00:50:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Does Miocic have a shot against Werdum? #UFC198
729458877142577153 2016-05-08 23:52:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Don't get me wrong, I love my mother. But the King's mom would probably change her bum life.   Love ya, ma. #MothersDay #McGregorEra #UFC
729448593841590273 2016-05-08 23:11:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Thanks to all who showed me Josh Emmett's finger. Appreciate it. Any other grotesque things out there send them my way. #UFCRotterdam

729412814310391813 2016-05-08 20:49:01 UTC <ScottyP922> I always knew once USADA cleaned up this sport Alistair Overeem would dominate. #UFCRotterdam
729412071251689473 2016-05-08 20:46:04 UTC <ScottyP922> Where does Arlovski go from here? Finished the last two fights. Is he done? #UFCRotterdam
729410935295750144 2016-05-08 20:41:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Seriously, if my big toe ever comes out of it's socket, I'm tapping. To a child. I don't care. I'm done. #UFCRotterdam

729407638904160257 2016-05-08 20:28:27 UTC <ScottyP922> I picked Overeem and I already regret it. He's hard to trust. #UFCRotterdam
729406860881596416 2016-05-08 20:25:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut And the head trauma as well.   It's why I respect ALL these fighters.
729406163821826048 2016-05-08 20:22:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Can't wait to see Aldo and Bigfoot in the new "What are you waiting for? Finish me!" EA UFC2 commercial. #UFCRotterdam
729404977379037184 2016-05-08 20:17:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut It has to be humiliating and soul crushing.
729404574151254016 2016-05-08 20:16:16 UTC <ScottyP922> I believe Struve just said 60 Gs baby! in whatever language that was. #UFCRotterdam

729327256108187651 2016-05-08 15:09:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @MrICanDueDat @dallascowboys Beautiful lady.
729326403779477504 2016-05-08 15:05:39 UTC <ScottyP922> What I love about fight pass and not about the Fox shows is the walkouts. Hate not seeing them. #UFCRotterdam
729325888437948416 2016-05-08 15:03:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Happy Mother's day, Miss poor taste in UFC fighters. ;)
729325350413582336 2016-05-08 15:01:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow It's too early in the morning to get all deep and technical on us.
729315030978727939 2016-05-08 14:20:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @Danielmmafan Mayweather starts it. McGregor ends it.
729314595245047808 2016-05-08 14:18:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottyP922 * Except for Aldo's mom.  But that should go without saying.   #UFC #McGregorEra
729302015210303488 2016-05-08 13:28:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @itz_mizdee I think it's safe to say this Mom deserves an extra special Happy Mother's day from Cowboys Nation. #ThankYouForZeke #WeDemBoys
729299670271430656 2016-05-08 13:19:25 UTC <ScottyP922> Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there from this momma's boy. We owe you everything for all you do. #MothersDay
729121120801140737 2016-05-07 01:29:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX I hope this becomes the norm whenever a fighter gets a big opportunity. Tank Conor McGregor.

727624626084425729 2016-05-03 22:23:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I believe you, King. I feel sympathy for that man. Allow him to return home to make balloon animals for the children.

727156350158016512 2016-05-02 15:22:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @LezBernardi They can call it UFC 200K. It's prelims without the King.
727155913707118592 2016-05-02 15:20:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @LezBernardi It will do maybe half of Conor's numbers.

726808271206649856 2016-05-01 16:19:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX It's prize fighting. This one brings the biggest prize. The fact it's not on 200 points to Dana and his ego.
726277064010031104 2016-04-29 05:08:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite @Reebok @TeamKhabib Like you wrecked the #UFC200 card?

726087813628870657 2016-04-29 16:36:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma @Reebok @YouTube By acknowledging Conor McGregor is my King and doing all I can to help bums in his name.
725808582751571974 2016-04-28 22:07:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @teessidetom1986 @sherdogdotcom McGregor is the show. This card won't sell like a McGregor card. And that's the bottom line.
725804658975997952 2016-04-28 21:51:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Who's the complete doucebag in the middle?
725791443160338432 2016-04-28 20:58:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Lets say J. Smith and M.Jack never had injury issues. What would your top 5 look like tonight?
725728580441890817 2016-04-28 16:49:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Especially after you KO'd what's his face with the scar.
725516844795367425 2016-04-27 02:47:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Any chance your left hand could have a meeting with Dana's chin?  It would change my bum life, King.
725514322651258881 2016-04-27 02:37:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Could we just have a Conor McGregor and Joanna Champion reality show?   I would watch the living shit out of that. #tuf23 #UFC

725472619613556736 2016-04-27 23:52:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @SportsCenter BTW, "the deal was" Dana's way or the highway.
725471897970958336 2016-04-27 23:49:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @SportsCenter It was "necessary" for @danawhite's ego. It makes no sense whatsoever to fight fans. Just more Dana dictatorship.
725470577088192513 2016-04-27 23:43:58 UTC <ScottyP922> From a Pay Per View standpoint you can call it UFC 200K. #UFC200 #PrelimsWithout @TheNotoriousMMA
725453543289819136 2016-04-27 22:36:17 UTC <ScottyP922> How do you make people not care about Jones/Cormier 2?   By making it a replacement for McGregor.   Great work, @danawhite. #UFC200
725451705333243906 2016-04-27 22:28:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @guicruzzz The man who stiffened me on the canvas in seconds is weak.   Brazilian logic.
725451503276838914 2016-04-27 22:28:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay feels like he's still the champion.   Except for that whole getting KO'd stiff quicker than you can microwave a pop tart. #UFC

725166140465532929 2016-04-26 03:34:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite likes everything his way and when he doesn't get it he throws a fit. That's what's happening. - Don Frye, on #UFC200
725148345547759617 2016-04-26 02:23:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I thought that was James Dean for a second.
725134404801187840 2016-04-26 01:28:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Well, I know for a fact Conor McGregor got at least one vote in the Pennsylvania Primary today. #UFC #Elections2016
725097462017478656 2016-04-26 23:01:21 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor and a broomstick out sells #UFC200   Hey, @danawhite ....60 of these, babaay! Haha!pic.twitter.com/ZFJ6NkyFrF
724983243146055681 2016-04-26 15:27:29 UTC <ScottyP922> If McGregor main events 201 it will do more buys than #UFC200.   @danawhite put your ego aside and save your card.
724982731596124160 2016-04-26 15:25:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom @ToddMartinMMA Yeah maybe it's time @lorenzofertitta over rule his dictator buddy.
724982033018175489 2016-04-26 15:22:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor can fight at 199. He can fight at 201. He just can't fight at #UFC200.  It's a @danawhite thing.
724918180284620801 2016-04-26 11:08:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow No..the point is Dana showing who is boss. This isn't the first time he's abused his power. He's a bully.
724778042426556417 2016-04-25 01:52:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource I've decided to make Conor fight on another card to show him who's boss.   Lorenzo's schoolmate is a major league A-hole.
724766560565497856 2016-04-25 01:06:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @McGregorArmy @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite Yep. That's all this is. Dana feels threatened by Conor. Wants to put him in his place.
724752171410046976 2016-04-25 00:09:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @McGregor_4_Life @TheNotoriousMMA @John_Kavanagh The man has no class.   And no belt. #McGregorEra
724751786628780033 2016-04-25 00:07:45 UTC <ScottyP922> If Conor doesn't fight at #UFC200 it would be another case of Dana abusing his power.
724747631545733121 2016-04-25 23:51:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @thirdwavefem Right? I mean, it's not like it was Princess who died!
724746525780414464 2016-04-25 23:46:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @VenezuelanVixen @ufc @UFCFightPass Krikey.
724744973955018753 2016-04-25 23:40:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Thanks for another great year, Dane. I'll be thumbing through your work as those picks are made.
724736454807707649 2016-04-25 23:06:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Jones comes back from a distracted year and blanks a top 10 LHW and people call it the worst of his career.   THAT's how good he is. #UFC
724644080576241665 2016-04-25 16:59:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Boss. The King is back in. Make the adjustments. Do not let these bums suffer needlessly. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
724631588424822784 2016-04-25 16:10:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor has yet to inform Dana that he's back in for #UFC200.
724610822983446529 2016-04-25 14:47:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones You still there, OSPussy?
724610297227419648 2016-04-25 14:45:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @PaddyHolohanMMA Much respect to you, good sir. Enjoy your retirement. You will be missed. #Hooligan
724594867658186752 2016-04-25 13:44:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @PaddyHolohanMMA Sad to hear.
724594758023307265 2016-04-25 13:43:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Motivated by our King I told a homeless man I wanted to change his bum life.   By his reaction, he must have been an Aldo fan. #UFC200
724546761679876097 2016-04-25 10:33:04 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC200 has been saved. #McGregorEra
724546379905945600 2016-04-25 10:31:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite @lorenzofertitta My King!  Oh, I'm so emotional right now.
724368549926592512 2016-04-24 22:44:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @CarlaEsparza1 Congratulations, Carla. It was good to see you back in there. All the best to you.
724312607637835776 2016-04-24 19:02:37 UTC <ScottyP922> I see everyone saying that version of Jones loses to DC.   I doubt it. #UFC197
724086998718394368 2016-04-23 04:06:08 UTC <ScottyP922> You have to admire Daniel Cormier's determination to remain fat through a lifetime of grueling training. #UFC197
724086717892988928 2016-04-23 04:05:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @sambos22 Little sense other than the best most competitive fight.
724086167449272320 2016-04-23 04:02:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Jon Jones murks OSP.   Rogan: Jon, you are the greatest fighter in the world. How does it feel to be back? #UFC197
724085674475958273 2016-04-23 04:00:52 UTC <ScottyP922> How awesome would it be if this was Jones/Cormier right now? #UFC197
724083098988720129 2016-04-23 03:50:38 UTC <ScottyP922> It looks like if Cejudo shaved his head he could make strawweight. #UFC197
724082353413431296 2016-04-23 03:47:40 UTC <ScottyP922> For all we know something could be going on in Pettis' life that has him distracted. Doesn't look like the same guy. #UFC197
724081877661917184 2016-04-23 03:45:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @1983jayson @BloodyElbow @1983Jayson Mookie's evaluations seem a little off since testing too.   I'm just saying.
724081640356589569 2016-04-23 03:44:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, in case you didn't know, Cejudo won a gold medal in the Olympics. #UFC197
724079924441538561 2016-04-23 03:38:01 UTC <ScottyP922> Anthony, you might want to stop sparring with CM Punk. #UFC197
724079229122449410 2016-04-23 03:35:15 UTC <ScottyP922> Three straight losses for Pettis. #UFC197
724078411560443906 2016-04-23 03:32:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Barboza and Roy Nelson have the best kicking game in the UFC. Nelson is a little more flashier though. #UFC197
724077822915035137 2016-04-23 03:29:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Pettis has lost his mojo. #UFC197
724077260496576513 2016-04-23 03:27:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I've got it tied 19-19 but Barboza's landing the more effective shots. #UFC197
724073238490415104 2016-04-23 03:11:27 UTC <ScottyP922> This fight is going to be nuts. #UFC197
724049555659100160 2016-04-23 01:37:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Turteen seconds is the King's fastest UFC knockout. #UFC197
724049379234078721 2016-04-23 01:36:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Brotime Pettis up next.   Very skilled but a stiff breeze buckles his knees. #UFC197
724049003424452608 2016-04-23 01:35:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Feel bad for Steele. He fought his heart out. #UFC197
724046741692145664 2016-04-23 01:26:10 UTC <ScottyP922> I guess as long as you can beat the woman or abuse the child in time to make the press conference it's all good. #East #McGregor #UFC200
724045679413342212 2016-04-23 01:21:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I want Esparza/Aguilar. Grudge fight.
724041745676263424 2016-04-23 01:06:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeganMarcus You lucky bastard. Enjoy, my friend.
724041583033745408 2016-04-23 01:05:40 UTC <ScottyP922> Lima showing that Brazilian class after the decision was read. #UFC197
724040836531544065 2016-04-23 01:02:42 UTC <ScottyP922> It's hard to believe Rose lost to Carla. #UFC197
724040615248449537 2016-04-23 01:01:49 UTC <ScottyP922> I have it 30-27 Esparza. #UFC197
724039313575518209 2016-04-23 00:56:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @sherdogdotcom Jesus Christ, Jon. Eyes on the road!
724039174450458625 2016-04-23 00:56:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Carla looks exhausted. #UFC197
724035314222698496 2016-04-23 00:40:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Let's see if Carla has improved her striking game if her wrestling doesn't control this fight. #UFC197
724025245296930816 2016-04-23 00:00:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst Thank you, kind sir!
724017573889728513 2016-04-23 23:30:15 UTC <ScottyP922> I just hope Cody East doesn't instinctively start fighting the ring girl when he gets out there. #UFC197
724013869245538304 2016-04-23 23:15:32 UTC <ScottyP922> This is anybody's round. #UFC197
724005810695757824 2016-04-23 22:43:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow "Ya know what man,..."
723999069820039168 2016-04-23 22:16:44 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't wait to watch the GOAT tonight.  And after I'm done with Conor's fights on fight pass I'll check out the main event of #UFC197 too.
723976181800931328 2016-04-23 20:45:47 UTC <ScottyP922> I want McGregor/White #UFC205.
723849490344607744 2016-04-23 12:22:21 UTC <ScottyP922> The supposed GOAT returns today and the sports world is focused on a King failing to address his court in LV.  What era?  #McGregorEra #UFC
723814238687514624 2016-04-23 10:02:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite Remember when Conor saved #UFC189 taking Mendes on short notice with a shredded knee?   F yourself. #McGregorEra
723813878392565760 2016-04-23 10:00:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MightyMouseUFC Was that a #UFC fighter? #Reebok
723723744317943808 2016-04-22 04:02:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Your love and compassion for these bums touches me. You're like an Irish Ghandi.
723662575154683904 2016-04-22 23:59:37 UTC <ScottyP922> My fiance told me I was better looking than Conor McGregor today.   Wedding's off. #McGregorEra #UFC200
723632720836960257 2016-04-22 22:00:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @Reebotched @arielhelwani Ariel pretending Nate Diaz is smart enough to have any sort of plan.
723630707470422017 2016-04-22 21:52:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate Diaz. Street trash. #UFC200
723628696523948032 2016-04-22 21:45:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA This man lists the entire UFC roster as dependents on his tax form. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
723347740063879169 2016-04-21 03:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @kevolution I think he will. I'd be shocked if he can handle MM.
723347290530942976 2016-04-21 03:06:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Dead to me, Katie.   Just dead to me.
723346844835844096 2016-04-21 03:05:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @kevolution That it's good for discipline to pull McGregor off the card. He was getting too big. No fighter is bigger than the promotion.
723332759087898627 2016-04-21 02:09:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg We just became besties.
723331510003228672 2016-04-21 02:04:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch Nonsense. She will.
723330279218241536 2016-04-21 01:59:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @hellofeliciabg Team Joanna or Team Claudia?
723308444766318592 2016-04-21 00:32:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Dana's move will probably be to laugh at your 1.6 million followers and call you an Irish egg.
723306541923852289 2016-04-21 00:24:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Don't tell me he's the best rapper too.
723306089249386496 2016-04-21 00:23:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow What's next? Aldo using McGregor as a job reference?
723304360151769088 2016-04-21 00:16:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA My move is to bow and tank you. Tank you right now.
723296737117503489 2016-04-21 23:45:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Henry Cejudo supports the #UFC over McGregor in this squabble.   I guess this would be a good time to explain who the hell Henry Cejudo is.
723293192364392448 2016-04-21 23:31:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig @TheNotoriousMMA @MMALatestNws This is serious?
723288197518778369 2016-04-21 23:11:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @HenryCejudo @arielhelwani Well that must mean something.
723252101812498433 2016-04-21 20:48:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Stupid of the UFC. They've only hurt their own card.
723251788846104576 2016-04-21 20:47:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 For life.
723184771371810816 2016-04-21 16:21:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @Whataburger Whatafighter
723184295804719108 2016-04-21 16:19:06 UTC <ScottyP922> This is the 2nd coming. His resurrection. And Pontius Diaz is F'd.  Nate: Nobody knows what youre talking about homie!  Oh shut up. #UFC200
723176844023967744 2016-04-21 15:49:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Nearly half a billion generated for bum relief and what is this man asking for? Time to train?
723173736711630848 2016-04-21 15:37:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey @danawhite? 60 PLEASE!, babaay!! Haha! #UFC200 #McGregorEra
723169188727152640 2016-04-21 15:19:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Bums and minions, our King has spoken. Now grab a pitchfork and we'll meet at Dana's.   #UFC200 can still be saved.
723085907847446528 2016-04-21 09:48:09 UTC <ScottyP922> I am so confused by this McGregor decision. Walk away from main eventing #UFC200 and a fight you are obsessed with? #ConorComeBack
723084797220888576 2016-04-21 09:43:44 UTC <ScottyP922> After their 1st fight Joanna showed Claudia respect. Claudia showed typical Brazilian class. #TUF23 #UFC
722969454112595968 2016-04-20 02:05:24 UTC <ScottyP922> The thing that stands out to me the most on #TUF23 is how much Claudia Gadelha is clearly not on steroids. #UFC
722942507273707522 2016-04-20 00:18:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Please please please make Nate Diaz fight him.
722941190539243521 2016-04-20 00:13:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Think of the bums. Who will change their lives? You are a compassionate King. #ConorComeBack
722938453353226242 2016-04-20 00:02:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA #ConorComeBack
722931808413724672 2016-04-20 23:35:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @shaunalshatti They should all emulate Cejudo and a ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.   Enjoy your lesson this weekend.
722617569849569280 2016-04-19 02:47:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @mcgregorfanbase Keep the faith. This sounds like a rash decision by Conor. I think he comes back.
722603779296768000 2016-04-19 01:52:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheDKano @OnlineLurker Tommy as in @TommyToeHold?
722602668594700288 2016-04-19 01:47:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman @TheZaneSimon @patrick_wyman and @BoxingBusch talked about a potential future rift between the UFC and Conor and damn if they weren't right.
722598902877261824 2016-04-19 01:32:58 UTC <ScottyP922> So do we change it to #UFC200onFox now that Nate's carrying the card? #UFC
722598067535548416 2016-04-19 01:29:39 UTC <ScottyP922> So let me get this straight. #UFC199 is Rockhold/Weidman and #UFC200 is Nate Diaz and a replacement?
722596846733037569 2016-04-19 01:24:48 UTC <ScottyP922> It would have been nice if Frankie Edgar would have stepped up to challenge McGregor while he was active. #UFC.
722595145682694145 2016-04-19 01:18:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye Yep. And maybe mistaken for his brother Nick by a few.
722594690017705986 2016-04-19 01:16:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye Diaz is a well known name within MMA. Not outside of it.
722594496287023104 2016-04-19 01:15:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye Rashad's not a top 5 draw. Conor, Rousey, Jones, Lesnar, GSP. Give me a break. Are you a casual fan?
722594012813737986 2016-04-19 01:13:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye Ya know why Nate had never main evented a PPV before McGregor? Because the UFC knew he couldn't.
722593880890281988 2016-04-19 01:13:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye You said we don't know drawing power. Now you say we do. Make up your mind.
722593140788609024 2016-04-19 01:10:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye Lets put it this way. If you don't know Conor is the biggest draw you are either ignorant or bias.
722592940816744448 2016-04-19 01:09:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye Other than the reported numbers and who the UFC puts in those slots.
722592178023882752 2016-04-19 01:06:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut I'll admit, it's hard to retort this kind of wit.   209?
722591847441416192 2016-04-19 01:04:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut Your use of casual fans bores me. Shoot for something better. You do not know more about the sport.
722591460005134337 2016-04-19 01:03:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dusty_Frye @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut Nate have never main evented a PPV without McGregor. She is right. It's not an opinion.
722590491393568768 2016-04-19 00:59:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Roy Nelson has been lighting up the phones at #UFC headquarters demanding to know if McGregor did in fact get any cheese.
722589927620349952 2016-04-19 00:57:18 UTC <ScottyP922> This will blow over. There's too much money to be made for the #UFC and McGregor.
722589485469450240 2016-04-19 00:55:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye She schooled you, Jesse. If this were an MMA fight I'd be jumping in to save your gazelle carcass.
722586174909464576 2016-04-19 00:42:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I will not be able to look at another gorilla wearing a crown eating a heart tattoo without thinking about him. #UFC #ConorComeback
722585961889140739 2016-04-19 00:41:32 UTC <ScottyP922> This is definitely a The Notebook kind of night. #OhConor #UFC
722585628156784640 2016-04-19 00:40:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @FilthyTomLawlor @BreezyPuffs Tom, are you willing to predict tings?
722583934886940672 2016-04-19 00:33:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut I see you share that Stockton intellect.
722583434934292480 2016-04-19 00:31:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut Just the facts. Check it. I didn't make it up.  BTW does this mean Josh Thomson is better than Nate?
722583026618789888 2016-04-19 00:29:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut Nate has had 21 UFC fights. No PPV main events without McGregor. He's a Fox fighter without the King
722582115146194944 2016-04-19 00:26:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut McGregor could take 4 years off and he'll walk in as the main event in any PPV. Nate is a mid carder
722581975303892993 2016-04-19 00:25:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut How many main events has Nate been in? How many PPV main events?  Should we count and compare?
722581548193722368 2016-04-19 00:24:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Eitakreut @Dusty_Frye "Nate Diaz had a title shot".   Well that just screams stardom.
722581317146263552 2016-04-19 00:23:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @JBlack_Muckshow @Dusty_Frye @Eitakreut Nate fought on a Fox undercard the fight before McGregor.   You were saying?
722578804351377408 2016-04-19 00:13:06 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor's the only man who made me question my own sexuality.   And I would still be willing to clean his place like twice a week. #UFC
722578313974312960 2016-04-19 00:11:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman @OnlineLurker In their last 3 PPVs McGregor has done a million more combined than Rousey. Per the numbers we can see. So yes.
722577915167318017 2016-04-19 00:09:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I would not be surprised if when the dust settles Dana White is fired and #UFC200 gets renamed #McGregor1.
722576673032560640 2016-04-19 00:04:38 UTC <ScottyP922> So with McGregor retired (for now) does everyone go back to not giving two shits about Nate Diaz? #UFC
722575671030116353 2016-04-19 00:00:39 UTC <ScottyP922> They won't say it, but every one in Conor's inner circle is thinking to themselves "mistake".
722575204069806083 2016-04-19 23:58:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @CharlyArnolt @OnlineLurker 10 million?! That's a lot of G's, babaay!. Don't make me do the math.
722574944438198272 2016-04-19 23:57:46 UTC <ScottyP922> So it wasn't Conor deciding to retire, it was a dispute with the UFC that led to this.   That means he'll be back. Bet on it.
722574626468020224 2016-04-19 23:56:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanSheehanBA @OnlineLurker Uhoh.   Listen, I love Conor....but once the dust settles and that money stops coming in, he'll be back.
722573471763603456 2016-04-19 23:51:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanSheehanBA @mcgregorfanbase I feel like writing him a song. #OhConor #Feelz
722572407601557504 2016-04-19 23:47:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler No offense, Dane but I think I'll wait to hear what your son thinks.#MiniBruglerDraftReport
722570952199041025 2016-04-19 23:41:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @Cowboycerrone @DanaUnleashed Yeah, like wearing a field hat indoors and calling yourself Cowboy.
722570151154094080 2016-04-19 23:38:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler I'd like to not rule out Dallas for Wentz. Big mistake if they don't do it, IMO.

722549885459959809 2016-04-19 22:18:11 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder if Dana's knees are starting to hurt him? #UFC #McGregorEra
722548595489128449 2016-04-19 22:13:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @RdosAnjosMMA Sure. As soon as you explain your eyebrow ridge growing over the years.
722525108489883649 2016-04-19 20:39:44 UTC <ScottyP922> I wonder if we'll all get the day off tomorrow? #UFC #LostOurKing
722524580179525632 2016-04-19 20:37:38 UTC <ScottyP922> When I hear it from Dana I'll believe it.   Looks like it's a tub of ice cream and Lifetime movies for me in the meantime. #UFC #OhConor
722523737317326848 2016-04-19 20:34:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Plus to go out losing to a mid carder like Nate Diaz? Hard to believe. #UFC
722522773688598528 2016-04-19 20:30:27 UTC <ScottyP922> If its real, good for him. Get out healthy and wealthy.   But I can't put into words how much this sucks for his fans. He was the show #UFC
722522286683725824 2016-04-19 20:28:31 UTC <ScottyP922> For the record, I'm not buying it. He is obsessed with being a two weight world champion in the UFC.
722519804842782720 2016-04-19 20:18:39 UTC <ScottyP922> I need counseling to get through this. #UFC #McGregorEra

722244426010116096 2016-04-18 02:04:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow So after he loses to Cruz he wants to get knocked out stiff by McGregor?
722224207719972866 2016-04-18 00:44:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Would you be in favor of having the draft before FA? Seems to make more sense to me. Plug remaining holes in FA later.

721515468180340736 2016-04-16 01:47:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Tecia's stock should rise after that fight. No loser there. Both contenders. #UFCTampa

721513448811704320 2016-04-16 01:39:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @muzzyroth I think this is the real main event.

721508157412012035 2016-04-16 01:18:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut I like her music but I wasn't much of a fan of Selena as an American Idol judge.   Pick you up at 8?  What?
721506919739977729 2016-04-16 01:13:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Agreed. I'd like to see you guys talk about that one day. She's very skilled yet no finishes in her entire career. Why?
721506303642902528 2016-04-16 01:11:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow She's a finisher. Torres isn't.
721505890663313408 2016-04-16 01:09:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Torres has a lot of ability but no finishing ability. Not a single finish in her pro career. #UFCTampa

721501969291034625 2016-04-16 00:54:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma @IAmF7 @SBNLukeThomas I think he lost because he gassed. Nothing more.
721501526162829312 2016-04-16 00:52:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 Aldo is most accomplished. McGregor is the GOAT.
721501127636869120 2016-04-16 00:50:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 Again. Accomplishment doesn't create ability. It showcases it.
721500965325705216 2016-04-16 00:50:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 Conor challenges himself in multiple weight classes. Unlike that 1 fight a year coward in Brazil.
721500053987336198 2016-04-16 00:46:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Not seeing the walkouts really takes away from the show, IMO. #UFCTampa

721499530248724481 2016-04-16 00:44:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 Right. Because you're wrong. You just can't stand the truth.

721498871478808576 2016-04-16 00:41:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 What you mean is you need to see him more before you can say that.   I dont. He's the best ever in that division. By a lot too.
721498612132364288 2016-04-16 00:40:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottieNS13 You don't seem to get it. Number of fights is irrelevant. Fights don't create ability. They showcase it.
721497253999943681 2016-04-16 00:35:24 UTC <ScottyP922> 30-27 Moleman. #UFCTampa
721497025615949824 2016-04-16 00:34:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Yeah...McGregor's lucky he didn't get any of Aldo's boy. #UFCTampa
721496588892430337 2016-04-16 00:32:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sarrrcher @John_Kavanagh That's cool. I have to go watch the #UFC194 replay anyway.
721495662815219713 2016-04-16 00:29:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sarrrcher @John_Kavanagh No. Weidman caught Silva goofing around and then Silva broke his leg in the rematch. Conor just starched Aldo.
721494817566535687 2016-04-16 00:25:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sarrrcher @John_Kavanagh Greatest is best and both are McGregor. Aldo is the most accomplished. For now.
721494517367640065 2016-04-16 00:24:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh People confuse accomplishment with ability. A fighter with 20 fights isn't automatically better than one with 10.
721494083915628544 2016-04-16 00:22:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @Sarrrcher @John_Kavanagh That's accomplishment. Accomplishment doesn't create ability. McGregor's the GOAT and he proved it.
721493236578127872 2016-04-16 00:19:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh They worship him.   Someone wake up the greatest FW in the world and have him take a bow.
721492706271313921 2016-04-16 00:17:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh I think so.

721476656863526914 2016-04-16 23:13:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I gave that round to Bethe. 19-19 #UFCTampa
721475221396594688 2016-04-16 23:07:51 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-9 Pennington. #UFCTampa
721471385026043905 2016-04-16 22:52:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Pennington grinds out a decision or even a late finish.

720425452976869376 2016-04-13 01:36:27 UTC <ScottyP922> When you watch that toy belt being fought for at #UFC200 do not forget the true pecking order in that division.pic.twitter.com/IeV1S4dMla
720421593332256768 2016-04-13 01:21:07 UTC <ScottyP922> If excellence was on the banned substance list our King would pop tomorrow. #UFC #McGregorEra
720420845508759552 2016-04-13 01:18:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @shaunalshatti I believe that's the stock response the Brazilians pass around to each other.
720420505614884864 2016-04-13 01:16:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow TJ would smoke him.
720391673176399873 2016-04-13 23:22:13 UTC <ScottyP922> So with yet another Brazilian a cheater do we have to keep pretending Gadleha's clean any longer? #UFC
719659909835526144 2016-04-11 22:54:27 UTC <ScottyP922> The UFC offseason = The break between McGregor cards. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
719656453712125955 2016-04-11 22:40:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnyHendricks @Sqor That's quite a head of hair on that little guy. Imagine his future beard!
719656020608331777 2016-04-11 22:39:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Congrats. You're fighting in the UFC.   In 9 days.   Against Khabib.   Well F me. #UFCTampa
719654251622838275 2016-04-11 22:31:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA To even be in the UFC long enough to get KO'd 8 times is quite an achievement.
719653402167238657 2016-04-11 22:28:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @McGregorArmy @TheNotoriousMMA There are a lot of pussies in this game and he is not one of them.

719275966061797376 2016-04-10 21:28:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I was one.   I hope this doesn't destroy my reputation.
719275383078658048 2016-04-10 21:26:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @McGregorArmy @TheNotoriousMMA That was when he asked him "You hurt already?!"  LOL.... Oh, Conor. ~twirling hair~
719274581857607680 2016-04-10 21:23:18 UTC <ScottyP922> I had that fight a draw. #UFCZagreb
719274289959202816 2016-04-10 21:22:08 UTC <ScottyP922> If I were Rothwell I would get my last name tattoed on my midsection just to see if that changes anything. #UFCZagreb
719273050533982208 2016-04-10 21:17:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Disappointing. I wanted to see Rothwell get a title shot. #UFCZagreb
719269477045706753 2016-04-10 21:03:01 UTC <ScottyP922> I didn't think we'd see this JDS ever again. #UFCZagreb
719263218397528064 2016-04-10 20:38:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottyP922 The correct answer is pray to Conor McGregor.
719263027397320704 2016-04-10 20:37:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Ur in the middle of an alley. On 1 side is Rothwell doing his laugh the other side is Lewis in his victory pose  What do you do? #UFCZagreb
719258664251617281 2016-04-10 20:20:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Superior jiu-jitsu.
719257968101978114 2016-04-10 20:17:17 UTC <ScottyP922> If I was ever out on a date and ran into Derrick Lewis I would trip her and run. #UFCZagreb
719257323756199936 2016-04-10 20:14:43 UTC <ScottyP922> I expect @BrianStann to change his nickname if Conor McGregor ever gets his US citizenship. #UFCZagreb

719253906962935809 2016-04-10 20:01:09 UTC <ScottyP922> It's a good thing for that Dr. that when Blaydes felt for his fingers he didn't mistake his index finger for his middle finger. #UFCZagreb

719243331524509696 2016-04-10 19:19:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @Phillies The Phillies look to the bullpen to hold a one run lead.   What could possibly go wrong?
719243102544916480 2016-04-10 19:18:13 UTC <ScottyP922> With that mustache, I know who would win if they were playing monopoly. #UFCZagreb
719242656283566080 2016-04-10 19:16:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheZaneSimon @BloodyElbow I'd enjoy the HW division more if it wasn't so predictable.   A few finishes would be nice too.
719242154632200200 2016-04-10 19:14:27 UTC <ScottyP922> I see all 4 HW fights going to a decision. #UFCZagreb

719234664804806656 2016-04-10 18:44:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @BreezyPuffs Could you send me a DM with instructions? But just don't think that means we're in an exclusive relationship or something.
719234525780426752 2016-04-10 18:44:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @BreezyPuffs I'm already signed up and been making picks by my lonesome. Don't see how to join your league.
719233931967623169 2016-04-10 18:41:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @BreezyPuffs How do I join? I feel like Nate Diaz watching Animal Planet here. #NobodyKnowsWhatAGazelleIsHomie
719232544462475264 2016-04-10 18:36:15 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor McGregor has to book Cro Cop a hotel in Zagreb. #UFCZagreb
719230234894155776 2016-04-10 18:27:05 UTC <ScottyP922> BTW, this is for the Interim SW title. #UFCZagreb
719230049619156992 2016-04-10 18:26:21 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Stanciu has emptied her tank. #UFCZagreb
719229350038646784 2016-04-10 18:23:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @EliasTheodorou None of my opponents would dare charge at me though, bro.
719228896441470976 2016-04-10 18:21:46 UTC <ScottyP922> This fight is reminding me that Joanna's the best, you know? #UFCZagreb #JoannaChampion
719226530820407300 2016-04-10 18:12:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Love when the ladies throw down. #UFCZagreb
718242044049813506 2016-04-07 01:00:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA He is the company. #McGregorEra
718241933819322368 2016-04-07 00:59:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I think she'd be overwhelmed by Cyborg's power.
718241333996097538 2016-04-07 00:57:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeriousStrange So I guess if you're ever plunging to your death from a plane aim for ants.
718236966601539585 2016-04-07 00:40:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA If they truly thought Tate was a tune up they were delusional. Maybe a little too confident after the Rousey upset.
718234734363598849 2016-04-07 00:31:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @Eitakreut You met McGregor. If you stayed loyal then, Wade's safe. :)
718231628909318144 2016-04-07 00:18:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst I've been waiting for this. They both have the same come forward brawling style. Do you lean one way or the other right now?
718231220610547713 2016-04-07 00:17:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Big Ben. Gogo choke.
718229298277130242 2016-04-07 00:09:43 UTC <ScottyP922> The UFC blew their chance.   #UFC197 McGregor vs. Jones  You've seen him on salad and steaks, now watch him on ice cream. #McGregorEra
718226033531568133 2016-04-07 23:56:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler And you really love you some Blair.   Shocker of the guide for me.
718225784763191298 2016-04-07 23:55:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I have no idea what "lovely tea this" means but screw it...it's my new tattoo. #WordsOfTheKing
718225357325864960 2016-04-07 23:54:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut  I wish that were true, Katie, but it's hard for me to find a woman who doesn't want to immediately make it physical.
718224623675056129 2016-04-07 23:51:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA There are a lot of bum lives involved in an entire company too.   This man never stops giving.
718224321710288901 2016-04-07 23:49:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Zingano/Pena should be for the interim title. #UFC200
718217799961833472 2016-04-07 23:24:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom He better leave the emotion at the door.
718217646538428417 2016-04-07 23:23:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom I'm not trying to be funny here. I seriously worry about Chris' mental state if he loses this fight.
718215138185187330 2016-04-07 23:13:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst She is but Pena is a monster. This is just a bad ass fight.
718213915453321216 2016-04-07 23:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That woman's family is requesting God stays out of it.
718213147425955843 2016-04-07 23:05:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnyHendricks Congrats Johny to you and your family. Healthy and 10 fingers and toes. That's all that matters.
718212495689834496 2016-04-07 23:02:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Dana said we'd be blown away by 200. Really good card, but not blown away yet.   Unless he means OMGCONORMCGREGOR! ~girlish squeal~ #UFC200
717894393781469186 2016-04-06 01:58:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamKhabib @MMAFighting @Cowboycerrone You lied to us, Khabib. One more time and I tell the King.
717893527355715584 2016-04-06 01:55:29 UTC <ScottyP922> As the MMA world wonders who did or didn't pull out, let us remember on July 9th he will be there. Like he always is there. #McGregorEra

717890388330156032 2016-04-06 01:43:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamKhabib Khabib, Aldo may be willing to sign and pull out. Give him a ring.
717890273607593985 2016-04-06 01:42:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TeamKhabib This guy has some kind of luck.
717888207115972608 2016-04-06 01:34:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Tate/Zingano is what I would book.
717871516000632832 2016-04-06 00:28:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma That sexy lady is a killer!
717870187966541828 2016-04-06 00:22:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @rory_macdonald @TheNotoriousMMA It's touching to see how much our King loves his bums.
717849595510988801 2016-04-06 23:00:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Three years ago today poor Marcus Brimage had no idea what he was getting himself into.   It was not a good night for that man. #McGregorEra
717849209727295492 2016-04-06 22:59:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Bums, your King isn't asking for much.   Thank him right now. Without making eye contact.
717524711865974785 2016-04-05 01:29:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @IrishPsychoMMA @TheNotoriousMMA Who is King Conor McGregor.   I'll take Aldo's a pussy for $500, Alex.
717517771651854336 2016-04-05 01:02:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @josealdojunior I'm sure he does. McGregor wasn't in the WEC.   Sleep well, Hosay.
717517248123052032 2016-04-05 01:00:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @CBTheGrenade @DanaUnleashed It just shows you the state of that division.   Way to build it up, Dana. Goof.
717484867907424256 2016-04-05 22:51:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @TonyFergusonXT Conor says you just have a cough.
717481142627266560 2016-04-05 22:36:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @DamonMartin I knew that card was too good to be true.   Mother#$@#@!!
717474198445273093 2016-04-05 22:09:13 UTC <ScottyP922> For Aldo/Edgar to fight on the same card as Conor feels like they're fighting in his shadow. - @arielhelwani   They are. #McGregorEra #UFC

716774353506066432 2016-04-03 23:48:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh LOL... I actually did, coach.
716756904807010304 2016-04-03 22:38:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Best days of my life in order...  1. Day Conor liked my tweets  2. Aldo KO  3. Birth of my son. (He moves like they all move) #McGregorEra
716747668169445376 2016-04-03 22:02:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Ignore my last tweet. Stay indoors. We cannot locate that left hand.
716745834675642368 2016-04-03 21:54:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA It is safe to attend Wrestlemania. You will not see the Tiger. You will not become food.
716710092289220608 2016-04-03 19:32:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource You can cut the excitement with a knife.
716597071655137280 2016-04-03 12:03:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's good to see Jon back to his old self. Posting and deleting his social media messages.

716408396300337155 2016-04-02 23:34:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Jones wins interim title.   DC/Jones is rebooked for the fall.   DC tells Jones he's got a toy belt.   I pass out laughing. #UFC197
716394371206221824 2016-04-02 22:38:22 UTC <ScottyP922> That PPV will be lucky to do 300k. #UFC197

716391986274693124 2016-04-02 22:28:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Interim? What's with all these interim belts?
716279834733838336 2016-04-02 15:03:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @shaunalshatti Yes, you can get that same treatment, Max.   As soon as you bring in the numbers Conor does.
716104470082486272 2016-04-01 03:26:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig Depending on the injury.
716101718375796737 2016-04-01 03:15:28 UTC <ScottyP922> People, Jon Jones wouldn't fight Chael Sonnen on short notice. What makes you think he's going to accept Rumble now? #UFC197
716099888757522432 2016-04-01 03:08:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker For a round. I think it becomes a pummeling after that.
716098220229791744 2016-04-01 03:01:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @datfan666 @MikeBohnMMA @MMAjunkie Yep. Fantastic fighter. Terrible draw. Go figure.
716097256378736640 2016-04-01 02:57:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Let's be honest. There was little chance Bones wasn't getting arrested again any way. #UFC197
716097078582239232 2016-04-01 02:57:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker I'd rather have it happen for the belt though.
716096947833204736 2016-04-01 02:56:31 UTC <ScottyP922> Waiting for - Conor McGregor moving up to 205 to replace Daniel Cormier at #UFC197 #IDontGiveAFAboutWeight
716090844772765696 2016-04-01 02:32:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Put it on 200. Co-main to the King.
716036402316767232 2016-04-01 22:55:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA Well that sucks.
715952437849358337 2016-04-01 17:22:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @goonercody His legacy is already cemented. One of the all time greats.
715928671949729792 2016-04-01 15:47:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom She looks natural.

715907565985652737 2016-04-01 14:23:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Learn, Katie. It shows how bad ass you are though. You fight with your glasses on.

715902903890874368 2016-04-01 14:05:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Frankie wins at 200.   Conor announces his next contest will be against Demian Maia in Metamoris.   Frankie shoots himself. #UFC200
715899348274569218 2016-04-01 13:51:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Conor's coach got me with an early morning tweet that Nate pulled out of 200.
715898810480926720 2016-04-01 13:49:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow  "Coward" - Someone willing to move up and fight bigger men. Even on short notice.   Is this the eyebrow ridge talking? #UFC
715898065400512512 2016-04-01 13:46:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut You may want to hold off on the REUTTER tat on his midsection until he's older or it will probably distort as he grows.
715890267522338817 2016-04-01 13:15:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut But I hope you are not regretting naming your son after McGregor. You made the right decision.
715890088320696322 2016-04-01 13:14:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Looked like he just gassed to me more than anything. He didn't expect Nate to eat those shots and stay upright.
715857463371636736 2016-04-01 11:04:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He's not lucky. He's the biggest draw in the sport. Nate was an undercard Fox fighter before this. That's the difference.

715636060089352193 2016-03-31 20:25:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA Great question. We should remember that Bones is a needle mover. Cormier not so much. UFC doesn't have many of those.

715562097279676417 2016-03-31 15:31:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria It would surprise me. Cormier is a beast.
715561959782002689 2016-03-31 15:30:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @FlyinBrianJ So was I. Disappointed in her fight. Cat or Holm. Even Nunes would be better test.

715561014549422080 2016-03-31 15:26:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @FlyinBrianJ Great fight. I thought Cat might get a title shot though.

715557018325528576 2016-03-31 15:11:02 UTC <ScottyP922> #UFC200 is shaping up to be a very good card but not a special one. IMO, of course.
715386973167308800 2016-03-30 03:55:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst It's admirable to want to test yourself and not go the safer route. I wish more fighters were that way.

715384650714230784 2016-03-30 03:46:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Congratulations to Hosay Aldo and Frankie Edgar for being on the King's undercard. #UFC200 #KnowYourRole #McGregorEra

715356047385432064 2016-03-30 01:52:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @Skywise316 In due time. Then you will have to adopt another 145er and pretend he's ducking him.

715354470385844224 2016-03-30 01:46:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Win, lose, or draw against Nate Diaz, he will go in and he'll fight either Jose or Frankie. Whoever wins at (UFC) 200. - @danawhite #UFC200

715350843797725185 2016-03-30 01:31:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @Kmasterz12 @sthomas141 @Anthony_Rumble As far as I know Conor never went a year without defending his title like Aldo liked to do.
715350022016073729 2016-03-30 01:28:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @RdosAnjosMMA @MMAFighting Wait. Let me try to understand your retarded thought process. Conor is a coward for fighting bigger men? LOL

715337839861436416 2016-03-30 00:40:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate now doesn't have to wash his red panties every day. He's got another pair. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
715337301367382016 2016-03-30 00:37:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BowmansRevenge @ConormcGregor5 I agree. I didn't like how he carried the weight. But this is what Conor does. He tests himself.
715335949287309312 2016-03-30 00:32:35 UTC <ScottyP922> Aldo and Edgar fighting for a toy belt and the right to get knocked out stiff in the fall.   Good luck, gentlemen. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
715335063118954497 2016-03-30 00:29:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @ScottHarrisMMA Well they were quotes from the fighters. Maybe they figured that's how Nate would spell it.
715334767634419712 2016-03-30 00:27:53 UTC <ScottyP922> F Nate Diaz. F Nick Diaz. F Stockton, California. #UFC200 #ProSpinningShit
715330128205766656 2016-03-30 00:09:27 UTC <ScottyP922> The King would have to take out a loan to give any fucks. 170 it is.   I hate it. But I'm no King. I move like they all move. #UFC200
715329399911026689 2016-03-30 00:06:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @MatthewRocheMad 170
715312955215187968 2016-03-30 23:01:13 UTC <ScottyP922> The sad part for Frankie is he'll get beat for the interim belt too. Can't beat Aldo. Only one man can. #UFC200
715312555627913216 2016-03-30 22:59:37 UTC <ScottyP922> So apparently they are going to put together a fake belt for a fake 145 champion at #UFC200.  We all know who the real King is.
715312117725990912 2016-03-30 22:57:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Aldo averaged about 9 months between title defenses for 5 years and they didn't do an interim. Conor champ for 4 months.

715274939230732288 2016-03-30 20:30:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @NangaParbat16 @josephdiano77 Again. if you didnt want to strip Aldo for being the least active Champ in UFC history you have no credibility
715263996819976194 2016-03-30 19:46:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @josephdiano77 @NangaParbat16 So spare me your attempt at looking impartial. And F Frankie. The old King of 145 has already been killed.
715263650542395392 2016-03-30 19:45:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @josephdiano77 @NangaParbat16 You just can't stand the new champion. That's why you were okay with Aldo's inactivity.
715263102082613249 2016-03-30 19:43:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @josephdiano77 @NangaParbat16 Did either of you want to strip Aldo when he fought 5 times in 4 years? If not, you have no credibility.
715017940094033920 2016-03-29 03:28:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA It looks like Conor has cut Dana out of these negotiations.   It was only a matter of time.

713794390238560263 2016-03-26 18:26:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @JonnyBones @ufc Use your range. Avoid the clinch. Work the body.  Now if you could excuse me, I have to give LeBron tips on basketball.

713715866026786817 2016-03-26 13:14:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @MatthewRocheMad Rumor is very soon.
713566193085517824 2016-03-25 03:20:12 UTC <ScottyP922> Win, lose or draw. Through all the ups and the downs. This man is my King. #UFC200 #Loyalty #McGregorErapic.twitter.com/e7dkDzxgy1
713556573797351424 2016-03-25 02:41:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAtweeting @MMANewsSource I'm sure he does. Those that watch the prelims.   A star he is not.
713555112623534080 2016-03-25 02:36:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource You can tell that with the fight before being on the undercard of a Fox show.
713539880614305793 2016-03-25 01:35:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @ThePeoplesMMA The man has toe curling power.
713477062447775744 2016-03-25 21:26:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Fight should have been stopped at that point.  Is either Diaz brother ever truly intelligently defending themselves? #UFC
713460436260298753 2016-03-25 20:19:58 UTC <ScottyP922> That McGregor/Diaz rematch is simple for me. If Conor doesn't gas he wins the fight. You may disagree. #UFC200
713459843277918214 2016-03-25 20:17:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @thefightbuzz Jesus, you guys don't mess around. That was 5 minutes ago.
713459089624457222 2016-03-25 20:14:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You're a generous King giving that man the win like that.  But now the beheading. Down with the clown. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
713456211321077760 2016-03-25 20:03:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Honorable mention - CM Punk vs. Mickey Gall
713455885721419778 2016-03-25 20:01:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc Now that is a good question.   I went with Jones/DC.
713432973299884032 2016-03-25 18:30:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @PrisonPlanet You wouldn't think a guy with his good looks would need to lie to score babes.
713427298054225920 2016-03-25 18:08:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA No opponent listed.   Well, whoever it was it was a cold, cold night in Dublin for that man. #KingMac
713379846009831424 2016-03-25 14:59:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @Derdersh Also talk of the UFC not liking Ariel speaking so much about fighter FA.   Probably a lot of issues.
713379678422245376 2016-03-25 14:59:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Derdersh The rumor is for breaking the news on the McGregor/Diaz rematch before the UFC was ready to do that.
713342655669739521 2016-03-25 12:31:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @SkySports Frankie's waited so long and then he gets beheaded on his turf.   It will not be a good night for that man. #UFC #McGregorEra

713144585732636672 2016-03-24 23:24:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc I'm assuming you didn't include Jon Jones because you don't want to wreck the batmobile? #UFC197
712842343976726528 2016-03-23 03:23:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @lilysky19 @MMARetweet @UFCONFOX Dana ripped him for it after the fight. Dean is a great ref but that wasn't one of his best performances.
712842137231101952 2016-03-23 03:23:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @lilysky19 @MMARetweet @UFCONFOX He allowed half the round to be wasted with two fighters doing nothing against the cage.
712836860112936960 2016-03-23 03:02:05 UTC <ScottyP922> This just in. Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier don't like each other. #UFC197
712836338295382016 2016-03-23 03:00:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @UFCONFOX Dean did do a horrible job in the 5th round of that fight.

712487284923346944 2016-03-22 03:53:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant Just an observation. You and Wade make a cute couple. You two should go out sometime.
712474141073543168 2016-03-22 03:00:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource What the hell is Nate's problem? It's his biggest pay day by a mile and he just beat the guy. He should want the rematch.
712473230590779392 2016-03-22 02:57:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani They said in terms of the usual vote on bills it was a landslide.

712417445500358657 2016-03-22 23:15:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @totsky_stephen We have to educate the uneducated on this sport. Some of the argument against today were ridiculous.

712407030645055488 2016-03-22 22:34:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @tlbray A fake account too. Scary that she's in the assembly.
712406126411829253 2016-03-22 22:30:31 UTC <ScottyP922> There's more domestic violence in MMA than in any other sport. - Catherine T. Nolan #MMA4NY #UFC
712405488768585729 2016-03-22 22:27:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Okay now before we tally the vote could everyone get up and give a brief bio on their life. #MMA4NY #UFC
712404830187290627 2016-03-22 22:25:22 UTC <ScottyP922> This is still faster paced than an FS1 card. #MMA4NY #UFC
712402966901297152 2016-03-22 22:17:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Deborah Glick actually checked Twitter while speaking and said @CoachEdmund is a disgrace to California. LOL! #MMA4NY #UFC
712401881524510724 2016-03-22 22:13:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Undoubtedly there will be many numbers of NYers that will be disabled and have brain injuries. - Deborah Glick #MMA4NY #UFC
712401003778338816 2016-03-22 22:10:09 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't help but think this bill would pass easier if Aldo wasn't part of the deal. #MMA4NY #UFC
712400765688610816 2016-03-22 22:09:12 UTC <ScottyP922> According to Deborah Glick, NY tax payers will have to foot the bill in 10 years for all the fighters with head injuries. #MMA4NY #UFC

712364982185295872 2016-03-22 19:47:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @mcgregorfanbase Aldo doesn't have the balls to take a fight at 170.

711389199375736834 2016-03-19 03:09:36 UTC <ScottyP922> This looks like ACJ is wrestling down a Dad who jumped in the cage to protect his son. #UFCBrisbane
711388527230111745 2016-03-19 03:06:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma You have a way with the ladies, Robin.
711386253183328256 2016-03-19 02:57:54 UTC <ScottyP922> "No one can take that right hand shot"   That's what Bosse should have said. Learn from the King. #UFCBrisbane
711384526266748930 2016-03-19 02:51:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Much respect to Bosse for holding back knowing Te Huna was done. No need for more damage. #UFCBrisbane
711384144295694336 2016-03-19 02:49:31 UTC <ScottyP922> That right hand just took his soul. #UFCBrisbane
711383952024539137 2016-03-19 02:48:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Mystic Zane strikes again.
711383621156913153 2016-03-19 02:47:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Quick stoppage.
711382472232144896 2016-03-19 02:42:52 UTC <ScottyP922> One, two, tree.... - #ConorMcGregor #UFC2
711380669038006272 2016-03-19 02:35:42 UTC <ScottyP922> If you thought Rawlings won all three rounds of that fight you're either blind or related to her. #UFCBrisbane
711380453970874368 2016-03-19 02:34:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig A 1000%.
711380060717060096 2016-03-19 02:33:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Terrible scoring.
711380004123312128 2016-03-19 02:33:04 UTC <ScottyP922> That scoring is insane. #UFCBrisbane
711379656239407106 2016-03-19 02:31:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite I thought the same thing boss! Terrible job!
711379569941585920 2016-03-19 02:31:20 UTC <ScottyP922> 10 point must system be damned. Ham won the fight. #UFCBrisbane
711374799008825344 2016-03-19 02:12:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc I am quickly becoming a fan of her.
711372805875568640 2016-03-19 02:04:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Ham gave Calderwood a close fight and she's about the same size and better than Rawlings, IMO.
711371522938687488 2016-03-19 01:59:22 UTC <ScottyP922> If it's possible to sound sweet while explaining how you're about to try to punch a man's face in, Mark Hunt pulls it off. #UFCBrisbane
711369496611713024 2016-03-19 01:51:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Hector Lombard is one scary individual. #UFCBrisbane
711368603644334080 2016-03-19 01:47:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Ham with the upset. If it's even considered one.
711360244354564096 2016-03-19 01:14:33 UTC <ScottyP922> If I was fighting in the UFC and my friend just died I would still dedicate my fight to Conor McGregor. #UFCBrisbane
711359890401398785 2016-03-19 01:13:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 The UFC without Dana White?! Could it happen?
711359441329852416 2016-03-19 01:11:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Another Saturday night with a Hooker and I'm disappointed in a quick finish. #UFCBrisbane
711355970895671296 2016-03-19 00:57:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I have Nakai 30-24. #UFCBrisbane
711355377753985025 2016-03-19 00:55:13 UTC <ScottyP922> I feel like I'm watching the female version of Mendes/McGregor. #UFCBrisbane
711354012797444096 2016-03-19 00:49:47 UTC <ScottyP922> 19-19 #UFCBrisbane
711352316490858497 2016-03-19 00:43:03 UTC <ScottyP922> If you don't root for Rin Nakai when you watch her fight you have no soul. #UFCBrisbane
711348519383252992 2016-03-19 00:27:57 UTC <ScottyP922> Frank Mir's UFC career has been amazing. 27th fight tonight. #UFCBrisbane
711348090394058752 2016-03-19 00:26:15 UTC <ScottyP922> Now let the ladies show the men how it's done. #UFCBrisbane
711346309458952192 2016-03-19 00:19:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Much respect to him.
711344882137305089 2016-03-19 00:13:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeffwagenheim @ChuckMindenhall @MMAFighting And I respect you both. Just an observation.
711344785685090304 2016-03-19 00:13:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeffwagenheim @ChuckMindenhall @MMAFighting Because neither one of you had a negative word to say about Aldo's inactivity.
711344647281446912 2016-03-19 00:12:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeffwagenheim @ChuckMindenhall @MMAFighting So in the future, champions should just stay inactive like Aldo and it's all good.
711302699359334401 2016-03-19 21:25:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma What's your take on this McGregor/Diaz rematch? Good idea for Conor?
711302127415595008 2016-03-19 21:23:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @AlbertBreer I've seen it reported that that's the buzz around the NBA front offices. That he just may.
711297208231002113 2016-03-19 21:04:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @AndreaHardie @vampiro_vampiro Janet, if you weren't already married I'd propose to you right now.
711250326079315971 2016-03-19 17:57:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst He's got good choke defense.
711235091507376128 2016-03-19 16:57:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @ChuckMindenhall @MMAFighting Chuck. Aldo had 11, 7, 6, 8 and 14 months between title fights. Please direct me to your article against this.
711220441441046528 2016-03-19 15:59:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource ZZZZZZZ
711188824743878656 2016-03-19 13:53:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Well he did completely destroy Nate not too long ago. It wasn't competitive at all.
711177218555310080 2016-03-19 13:07:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh @JamesKavanagh_ Congrats, guys. Now I'm hungry.
711047194883665920 2016-03-18 04:30:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @DuaneFinleyMMA At least McGregor is active.
711047194078392320 2016-03-18 04:30:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @DuaneFinleyMMA There were challengers for Aldo too. Yet you were fine with him being inactive. Why is this different?
711044770299297792 2016-03-18 04:20:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @DuaneFinleyMMA So a fighter fighting different weight should be stripped after months but someone inactive for a year is ok?
711039230831681537 2016-03-18 03:58:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 Ok great. Lucky! Enjoy yourself. Hope it's a blast.
711033029259628545 2016-03-18 03:34:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 Will you be in attendance at #UFCBrisbane Champ? Is that close to you?
711017559718535172 2016-03-18 02:32:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN @SportsCenter I would assume this means they won't make the film.
711015531957059585 2016-03-18 02:24:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @DuaneFinleyMMA I don't know. Were you calling to strip Aldo when he fought basically once a year for years?
711003346467987456 2016-03-18 01:36:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch I would say no but not like I won't watch.
710991618065747969 2016-03-18 00:49:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiLIzZo1 Jon Jones by the smallest of margins on my scorecard.
710991192067076101 2016-03-18 00:48:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman So Aldo was hurt over and over again throughout his career and Conor is scared?  Good talk, bro.
710989833641005058 2016-03-18 00:42:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @Hendrick5Team  Didn't even get the run in. Inexcusable.
710987848195903488 2016-03-18 00:34:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting I think these girls just need a day of shopping together. There'll be sleepovers and all nighters talking about boys.
710987176394268672 2016-03-18 00:32:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Oh hells yes.
710984769262243840 2016-03-18 00:22:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMcGregorFans @TheMcgregorFans I didn't like the way he gassed in that fight. He's not used to carrying that weight.
710984570645188608 2016-03-18 00:21:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Yeah I'm saying there were 3 years and 11 months between those fights and your hero fought 4 times.   Were you complaining?
710980181700141056 2016-03-18 00:04:19 UTC <ScottyP922> So can McGregor turn the tables just 4 months later? #UFC200
710978472945000448 2016-03-18 23:57:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 It's a business and the people that are mad never had a problem with Aldo being so inactive as champ. They have an agenda.
710968559267155969 2016-03-18 23:18:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Aldo was the least active champion in UFC history. Until McGregor beheaded him like a bitch.
710968444427112448 2016-03-18 23:17:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Between the first Mendes fight and McGregor, a period of nearly 4 years he has 4 title defenses. Where am I losing you here?
710968153073971200 2016-03-18 23:16:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @clemonssteve16 @MMAFighting You and me both. Conor just doesn't give a F. He wants that fight back.
710932196891172864 2016-03-18 20:53:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @clemonssteve16 @MMAFighting The problem in that fight is Nate could eat the shots. Conor picked him apart in that 1st round.
710931989755531264 2016-03-18 20:52:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @clemonssteve16 @MMAFighting I'm just a fan but I'd rather see him go back down and defend his title. Work his way up to 170 gradually.
710931760339673088 2016-03-18 20:51:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman That's a month shy of 4 years and he fought 4 times.   He should have been stripped of his title.
710931660682952704 2016-03-18 20:51:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman He fought Mendes on Jan 14 2012. Fought Edgar, CSJ, Lamas and Mendes again before losing to Conor in December 2015.
710930545631485952 2016-03-18 20:47:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Don't take offense, Joanna. She's Brazilian. They don't have any class.
710907768421486593 2016-03-18 19:16:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman McGregor is 3 months into his title reign. You had no problem with 5 fights in 4 years. This is why you're worthless to talk to.
710907177636999172 2016-03-18 19:14:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman The only people who believe he was active enough to hold a title are idiots and Aldo fans. You tell me which you are.
710906970455158784 2016-03-18 19:13:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman He had 5 title defenses in 4 years.
710903960152870912 2016-03-18 19:01:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman But I know better.
710903893610201088 2016-03-18 19:01:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Well then you're an idiot if you believe the least active champion in UFC history was just hurt all the time.
710901183280328704 2016-03-18 18:50:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Not really. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of another Aldo puke.
710879237352398848 2016-03-18 17:23:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Oh and btw, little Francis would crumble like all the other FWs. And then you'll pick someone else.
710879005998718978 2016-03-18 17:22:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Cain and Cruz had major injuries that required surgery. You claim to not be an Aldo fan but you sure talk like it
710878782245224448 2016-03-18 17:21:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Yes he pulled out of fights. Nobody pulled out of more. Who's the sucker to believe it?
710876221807132672 2016-03-18 17:11:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Just like he's inactive now. It'll be a year between fights for him again. This is his norm. You were ok with it.
710876070766120960 2016-03-18 17:10:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman That's simply not true. He wasnt injured repeatedly over a 4 year period. He was just an inactive champion that you were ok with
710875140461096960 2016-03-18 17:06:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Or you can admit you just can't stand McGregor slept him and only care about being an active champion now. Your choice.
710874990388895744 2016-03-18 17:06:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman Over the entire 4 year period? You list me all the injuries he had that prevented all those title defenses.
710864163782922240 2016-03-18 16:23:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @leglessman He wasn't hurt that entire time and a fighter staying active is more understandable than one just sitting in Brazil.
710861164901744640 2016-03-18 16:11:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Who am I to tell a King what to do but I would not be taking another fight at 170 with anyone right now. #UFC200
710860685522149376 2016-03-18 16:09:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani At WW again? Not smart, IMO.
710860154523271174 2016-03-18 16:07:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Keep in mind all the people outraged by this were perfectly fine with Aldo defending his title once a year. #UFC #McGregorEra
710859774393450497 2016-03-18 16:05:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting That's surprising. I figured he'd defend his title.

709438083918405632 2016-03-14 17:56:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Meathead to the sideshow that is Bellator.   Sad.
709431602057764864 2016-03-14 17:30:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake You've waited so long for this. Enjoy.
709431520591794176 2016-03-14 17:30:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake Yes I knew you didn't like Conor. Which makes me feel good knowing he's let you down so many times.
709431320628359169 2016-03-14 17:29:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake Well I can't imagine he'll get beat worse than Nate did. That was a pummeling.
709423111536570369 2016-03-14 16:57:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake Sure you are. You're a moron, you responded to my comment. Making it a statistical certainty you're a Diaz fan.
709421221264359425 2016-03-14 16:49:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake And that's the response I expected from a moron Diaz fan.   Now GFY.
709410043242921988 2016-03-14 16:05:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake He brought up having to teach to live because Nate was saying he was the draw. And he wasn't.
709409795711889409 2016-03-14 16:04:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake He was poking fun at the two sides of Nate Diaz. Not saying teaching kids is bad. Only a moron didn't understand it.
709392514634137602 2016-03-14 14:55:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @PiercyBlake Moron, McGregor was talking about Nate's gangster street attitude while teaching kids classes. Try to keep up.
709383641298804736 2016-03-14 14:20:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow And I used to like Serra.   Dead to me.
709189292594241536 2016-03-13 01:27:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @thirdwavefem Wait a minute. You're part man?!
709180313461772289 2016-03-13 00:52:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Swaxbagga1 @dc_mma That's true but I'm talking more about in the clinch.
709174607580897281 2016-03-13 00:29:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma DC, does your new training partner give you that same feel of Jones in the cage? You mentioned being surprised by that in the fight.
709150389736755200 2016-03-13 22:53:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @cindyelliott9 @chaseelliott @TeamHendrick Way to go, Chase. You drive like a veteran. So proud.
709000967803576320 2016-03-13 12:59:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @JTimlina @MrICanDueDat @briankim25 This is a compliment. That means they hate to see you go.

708641329824276480 2016-03-12 13:10:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @drewskii0615 Didn't the Cowboys go from 12 wins to a top 5 pick in the draft without their QB? Name another team who fell like that.
708640431542804480 2016-03-12 13:06:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA This man's check's can't make 205 and they are always made out to "King". #UFC #McGregorEra
708522373150957569 2016-03-11 05:17:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Well, you're very talented. Keep up the blogging! Have a good night.
708519085345099776 2016-03-11 05:04:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @joerogan I can tell you were a novice then because you don't even have a chest tattoo.
708517697378656256 2016-03-11 04:59:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Thank you, Katie. I appreciate that. Keep writing! Hey, do you take those pictures too?
708515790606077953 2016-03-11 04:51:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Yes writing is very therapeutic. I just wanted you to know I read it.
708515652567314432 2016-03-11 04:51:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut I have addiction in my family but more alcohol related. Really bad though.
708512386223890433 2016-03-11 04:38:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Not at all. You're a good writer. You're also brave talking about the addiction.
708496787846385664 2016-03-11 03:36:12 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm reading your blog @Eitakreut
708468968315609088 2016-03-11 01:45:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @gabe278 @dallascowboys Yeah that's my point. Bad trade.
708450921320226816 2016-03-11 00:33:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @drewskii0615  A very talented roster doesn't fall apart with the loss of the QB. Jerry loves fans like you.
708445181230653440 2016-03-11 00:11:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @gabe278 @dallascowboys Did you love the trade for Swaim for the same role? Another bad move by the front office.
708444666191024128 2016-03-11 00:09:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow And then Rockhold comes up for revenge.
708444413119340545 2016-03-11 00:08:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @NASCAR That 5 team is a walking abortion.
708442372619833345 2016-03-11 23:59:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @fishsports Because when you're 4-12 the key is to keep your own.
708419945084878848 2016-03-11 22:30:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Sorry Mr. Miesha, @FunkMaster_UFC whoops that ass.

708363058071138305 2016-03-11 18:44:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 But Diaz won the fight. It's MMA not a fist fight.  Learn and grow.
708362742990770177 2016-03-11 18:43:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Diaz sisters said after the Gil/Alvarez fight to look at their faces to see who really won. Haven't heard that from them now
708353181005291520 2016-03-11 18:05:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 I will not choose. I do not believe in the death penalty.
708300636736135168 2016-03-11 14:36:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @ZidanSports It doesn't do .5 million without McGregor.

708138668733677569 2016-03-10 03:53:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @GrabakaHitman @OnlineLurker Conor did not take a lot of damage in that fight.
708138617315725312 2016-03-10 03:52:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @GrabakaHitman @OnlineLurker Maybe hurt but tired too. You can check. He had no medical suspension. Diaz suspended until 4/20.
708136754491101185 2016-03-10 03:45:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @GrabakaHitman @OnlineLurker He's talking about fighters who get KO'd. He wasn't. He wasn't even medically suspended after the fight.
708089209853231104 2016-03-10 00:36:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @LouiseGreenMMA @danhardymma Completely agree, Dan. But it isn't happening.
708088403183673344 2016-03-10 00:33:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant I would not be surprised if KB has a Tiger tattoo on her belly.
708087573785149440 2016-03-10 00:30:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @george_ufc I think that will happen one day, George.
708076808474910722 2016-03-10 23:47:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnMcCarthyMMA It has to matter for CM to be carrying more weight. I can't see how that's a non issue in a fight. Never saw him gas before

708005349798879233 2016-03-10 19:03:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow He wipes his tears with their cash.
707791910845464576 2016-03-09 04:55:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnMcCarthyMMA @brucebuffer @ElzkaosDoyle I noticed that too and thought John must have requested it.
707740382902222848 2016-03-09 01:30:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma They hate him because they ain't him. #UFC #KingMac

707673974516408320 2016-03-09 21:06:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @robphillips3 If only they understood the game like you and Jerry do, Rob.
707673541056065541 2016-03-09 21:04:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Bet ya a beer those fighters are Brazilians. They don't like him because he said he was going to KO Aldo and then did.
707559039274774528 2016-03-09 13:29:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting More Holms, less Aldos.
707558959641731072 2016-03-09 13:29:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting It's called being a competitor, Dana. She should be saluted for taking the fight, not criticized.
707416667744292864 2016-03-08 04:04:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @MattSerraUFC is just brilliant.
707402140961083392 2016-03-08 03:06:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch Edgar deserves a title shot. Just not over Aldo. His long reign warrants an immediate rematch, IMO.
707380931322060800 2016-03-08 01:42:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @FilthyTomLawlor @arielhelwani Yes. I think that's what he meant.
707368715537551360 2016-03-08 00:53:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @thefightbuzz First I've heard of it.
707367329999527941 2016-03-08 00:48:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch Aldo deserves the shot. Hadn't been beaten in 10 years. Beat Edgar. McGregor would behead both so it's really meaningless.
707363432987754496 2016-03-08 00:32:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @marrok71 @joannamma Rich?
707347485111525376 2016-03-08 23:29:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @nickdiaz209 @YouTube I agree.
707325850845372416 2016-03-08 22:03:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @fishsports 1) No Jerry 2) No Stephen 3) Real accountability from the top down.

707041943142928384 2016-03-07 03:15:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @superCalo I think she would have gotten wrecked if she came back against Holm. Tate she can beat in her sleep.
707041005179158528 2016-03-07 03:11:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA When they write the book of MMA, your detractors will be mere mentions in your chapter.   All. Hail. The. King. #KingMac
707031861873266689 2016-03-07 02:35:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TonyThumbPoke @EliasTheodorou Brazilian class.
706988048341405696 2016-03-07 23:41:00 UTC <ScottyP922> Fact - The first words Aldo spoke after being KO'd stiff like a bitch in 13 seconds was "hands of soap". #UFC
706690236236079104 2016-03-06 03:57:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut LOL. Word to the wise, do NOT watch Gordon Ramsey's youtube channel at night. 3 videos in and I'm cursing and cooking.
706689857591119872 2016-03-06 03:56:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @BlessedMMA @TheNotoriousMMA As you are as well, Max. That rematch will happen some day. Two of the best in the game.
706689091769909248 2016-03-06 03:53:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut I battle it every day. Eat smart all day and then I want to binge at night.
706688137205030912 2016-03-06 03:49:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut After Lawler/GSP and McGregor/Aldo or Edgar, I have no idea. Been trying to figure it out.
706685018844823552 2016-03-06 03:36:52 UTC <ScottyP922> That #UFCTampa card is stacked. Please make it to the scales.
706678107848187904 2016-03-06 03:09:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @steves_simpson @tristargym Good point. Let's say Conor is on that card too. Who main events?
706677934468304897 2016-03-06 03:08:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut When you're on a Diaz witch hunt sometimes I'll pretend like we're dating.  I may have even told my mom about you. ;)
706677039164686336 2016-03-06 03:05:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @steves_simpson Especially with the way Lawler looked in his last fight. He's vulnerable.
706676961255559168 2016-03-06 03:04:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @steves_simpson Amazing comeback, right? I think 200 and a title shot it too good to pass up for GSP.
706676723702747136 2016-03-06 03:03:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Don't embarrass me in front of the guys with your higher intellect.
706674731756490752 2016-03-06 02:56:00 UTC <ScottyP922> I would be willing to bet #UFC200 will include Lawler vs. GSP.
706665693060714497 2016-03-06 02:20:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeDevlin1 A true champion and warrior. Head up, King. You are one of the greats.
706638889079971841 2016-03-06 00:33:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiLIzZo1 Needed to get humble? There is no more arrogant prick in the UFC than Nate Diaz. Even with his 10 losses.
706611452971347968 2016-03-06 22:44:33 UTC <ScottyP922> The next McGregor move I want to see is Rockhold go up to fight Jones. I would watch the shit out of that. #UFC
706609599625867265 2016-03-06 22:37:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MrMWellsArt So true. They are now 1-7. LOL.
706607643259834369 2016-03-06 22:29:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @gailsmith_gail @JohnMcCarthyMMA Probably because McGregor is the show. The event doesn't sell without him. My guess.
706601185239834626 2016-03-06 22:03:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Expected. There are no bigger scumbags in the UFC than the Diaz brothers.
706600349201776640 2016-03-06 22:00:25 UTC <ScottyP922> The safe path is to stay in a division you've dominated. Fight only when you have to.   We need more McGregors in the #UFC.
706594115874586625 2016-03-06 21:35:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @natedogmma1 @TheNotoriousMMA I stand behind our King, Nate. Unconditionally, my friend. True champion.
706585307773333505 2016-03-06 21:00:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeganMarcus @TheNotoriousMMA @John_Kavanagh @RusHammerMMA @ConormcGregor5  F'n right, brother. Team McGregor through it all.
706583562393235456 2016-03-06 20:53:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You don't need to apologize to those who could never make that walk. This is just a bump in the road, my King.
706572244974223366 2016-03-06 20:08:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Maybe those three can just exchange the belt with each other for a while. #StylesMakeFights #UFC
706571108951183360 2016-03-06 20:04:14 UTC <ScottyP922> If you didn't already know Jose Aldo lacked any class, you haven't been paying attention. #UFC196
706553708851695616 2016-03-06 18:55:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA A bump in the road of a Hall of Fame career. The true greats overcome adversity. You always have and you will again.
706485313808502785 2016-03-06 14:23:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria I'd rather lose a 170 title fight than this one. Competition is stiffer.
706481272487596032 2016-03-06 14:07:15 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm not a Colts or Broncos fan but what a joy it was to watch his career. The NFL will never be quite the same. #PeytonManning
706474369766260736 2016-03-06 13:39:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Congrats to Miesha Tate. It's amazing how styles make fights. #UFC106
706471889175076864 2016-03-06 13:29:58 UTC <ScottyP922> The worst part of all this is who it was. Nate Diaz is an average mid carder and one of the biggest POS you'll find. #UFC196
706471479865544704 2016-03-06 13:28:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Stay at 145. Be the FW King. #UFC196
706324223166423040 2016-03-05 03:43:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia So...twitter King...would you pass out laughing if MMA King sleeps Nate in an official time of 2:09?
706323693975240705 2016-03-05 03:41:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Sorry, Amanda....Dana was in the back massaging Conor's feet. #UFC196
706323422234742784 2016-03-05 03:40:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @TheNotoriousMMA Only Conor could make me retweet Justin Bieber.
706322531565903873 2016-03-05 03:36:29 UTC <ScottyP922> I love how Nunes totally disregards Rogen's questions. lol #UFC196
706321749101715458 2016-03-05 03:33:22 UTC <ScottyP922> 29-28 Nunes. I can't imagine a different scorecard. #UFC196
706321129238106112 2016-03-05 03:30:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @SportsCenter Clear the hall ways! There's a King coming through!
706319477496012800 2016-03-05 03:24:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Welcome to the UFC, Shevchenko. #UFC196
706318738879029248 2016-03-05 03:21:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Both fighters showing so much respect that the first round was a stinker. #UFC196
706318569190113281 2016-03-05 03:20:44 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-9 Nunes.
706317665149788160 2016-03-05 03:17:08 UTC <ScottyP922> Ladies, please...slow this pace down. #UFC196
706315334530310145 2016-03-05 03:07:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Oh, well I see you've already said it for me. Nevermind.
706315062798114816 2016-03-05 03:06:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I picked Nunes too but I feel like if it gets out of the 1st round the fight shifts to Shevchenko.

706304333306986496 2016-03-05 02:24:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut @jacobnoori You are absolutely correct but the MMA media gives them a free pass. What Jacob says is so true too.

706299906563186688 2016-03-05 02:06:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Not to mention McGregor picked up delegates in Louisiana, Kentucky and Kansas in the Republican primaries tonight. #PresMac

706282406681186304 2016-03-05 00:57:02 UTC <ScottyP922> Diego Sanchez just finished a fight without blood. If McGregor loses this is officially the end of the world. #UFC196

706279259866853377 2016-03-05 00:44:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @muzzyroth @MMAfightfans McGregor is just too good on the feet for anyone at 145. Too much range and power.
706278540656963584 2016-03-05 00:41:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @muzzyroth @MMAfightfans He ducked Frankie by going after the guy who beat him and then moving up to fight guys who would murk Edgar.

705919253313036289 2016-03-04 00:53:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma 172? From 145 the day before? That's amazing.
705918236953415681 2016-03-04 00:49:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma I want to see how Conor handles carrying this extra weight.

705840304809709572 2016-03-04 19:40:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnyHendricks McGregor 3rd round TKO. Now what do you think, Johny?

705832084544339968 2016-03-04 19:07:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanaUnleashed @UFC_200 I think he wants to know what his main event will be, Dana. Do tell.
705831653923491842 2016-03-04 19:05:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMALatestNws @vinny_craig This is a serious question?
705831256836186112 2016-03-04 19:04:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani I often wonder how that effects home life. Must have a very understanding wife.

705823689204494336 2016-03-04 18:34:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow @BoxingBusch Connor on Conor. Both the best in the game, in my book. Even if the former is a Diaz fan.

705787585193443328 2016-03-04 16:10:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Interesting having Higgins over Shepard.
705778767831158784 2016-03-04 15:35:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Dance for me, Nate. Dance for me. And don't look me in the eye when you dance. - @TheNotoriousMMA #UFC196
705777499477819392 2016-03-04 15:30:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Apparently "on" meant get up on stage and stand there.   These Diaz brothers don't mess around.
705775542348472322 2016-03-04 15:22:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 You can have the last word. Have at it. You're not worth the time. Enjoy Jake's next WSOF bout. LOL.
705774768470020097 2016-03-04 15:19:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 I can imagine you balling your hand into a fist right now.   It's the McGregor era and you can't stand it. LOL.
705774600102215680 2016-03-04 15:19:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 Now when was the Jake Shields era?  LOL This is embarrassing for you, Pedro.
705774376092880896 2016-03-04 15:18:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 All of those fighters are better than Shields. Yes.
705774244064567296 2016-03-04 15:17:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 BTW your reason for Shields being cut is highly retarded. Just irrational. He was cut because nobody gives a shit.
705773791692062721 2016-03-04 15:15:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 You are desperate. Bring GSP back. He'd get stiffened too. Welcome to 2016. Your era is dead.
705773573596651520 2016-03-04 15:15:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 It's 2016, idiot.
705773484027330560 2016-03-04 15:14:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 There is no question he's a Hall of famer. None whatsoever. Jake will need to buy a ticket to see Conor's bust.
705773227839234048 2016-03-04 15:13:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 You are just another idiot who can't stand how good this guy is. Talking about bums like Shields. Give me a break.
705773032137220096 2016-03-04 15:12:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 Your WSOF hero won't get it there. He'd get KOd stiff on the feet. No wrestle F or lay and pray.
705772741992050688 2016-03-04 15:11:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 Sure it is. It's about 95% correct over McGregor's Hall of fame career.   Now how right have you been with his fight predictions?
705772513519935488 2016-03-04 15:10:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 He was fired because he's a bum that nobody wanted to pay to see. A card filler. Nobody gives a shit.
705772301627867136 2016-03-04 15:10:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 And the fact that you're praying for takedowns proves how desperate you are. Nate, Nick. Jake, Gil. They'd all get beatdown.
705772023377752064 2016-03-04 15:08:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 McGregor would embarrass him on the feet. Before KOing him stiff. Much like I'm doing to you here.
705771835149950977 2016-03-04 15:08:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 It's 2016. That guy in WSOF needs to buy a ticket to get into a UFC event.
705771621013975040 2016-03-04 15:07:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 BTW, who won that Mendes fight?
705771489363099648 2016-03-04 15:06:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 You non believers say the same things. Kids. New to the sport. Same baseless BS that's just as wrong as your Conor fight picks.
705771261893414912 2016-03-04 15:05:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 You've never seen anyone like McGregor. Quite possibly the GOAT.   You mad, bro? Tell me again how a guy in WSOF could beat him.
705770035080462337 2016-03-04 15:01:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22  But tank you. It's nice to know he's making you miserable with each beheading.   Tell Jake good luck in his WSOF career.
705769786475749377 2016-03-04 15:00:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 @Izi_Garcia You can continue posting pics of the fight with the blown knee. It doesn't matter to me. McGregor by KO. Clean. Easy.
705766270512328704 2016-03-04 14:46:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @MeiaLua22 @Izi_Garcia McGregor by 1st round KO. Two different leagues.
705752999361175552 2016-03-04 13:53:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @antontabuena This is nothing but a mid carder trying to get some attention.
705751711412043777 2016-03-04 13:48:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConormcGregor5 Two Conors means two left hands and two new heads on Dana's desk.
705749613081399296 2016-03-04 13:39:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut LOL
705630191540776960 2016-03-03 05:45:22 UTC <ScottyP922> That suit was bad ass. @TheNotoriousMMA #Conan #UFC196
705599692663607296 2016-03-03 03:44:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @WJB__ @Izi_Garcia Robbie sits in the pocket but is slow and punch drunk. McGregor would embarrass him Wonderboy and Rory are the real tests
705596107217375233 2016-03-03 03:29:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears What I can say is he is without a doubt one of the greatest of all time and quite possibly the GOAT.
705595875557556224 2016-03-03 03:29:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears I'm not interested in a prediction from someone's whose been wrong all along the way. You or I don't know the future.
705589672257441793 2016-03-03 03:04:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite He did in 13 seconds what nobody could do in 10 years.

705564823183085569 2016-03-03 01:25:37 UTC <ScottyP922> Wake up, Nate. You're rich now.  #UFC196 #McGregorEra
705563906111107073 2016-03-03 01:21:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears He will dust Nate. Then remove Robbie's head at 200. And the world will no longer make sense to you.
705562317950480385 2016-03-03 01:15:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheRealGriminal @Izi_Garcia Then tell him to use his right hand. I doubt he can do it with an animal balloon.
705561664838623234 2016-03-03 01:13:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears That just adds to his legend for me.
705561610467807232 2016-03-03 01:12:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears That should be celebrated not criticized. He's not a guy who wants to fight 1 a year like Aldo. He wants to challenge himself.
705555682527989760 2016-03-03 00:49:17 UTC <ScottyP922> After the first exchange he'll realize he's in over his head. Then its survival mode. Then comes the collapse. #UFC196 #KingMac
705552240417906688 2016-03-03 00:35:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @a_dbears @robinblackmma What's to see? He's one of the greats. To suggest otherwise is foolish at this point.
705549499842891781 2016-03-03 00:24:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma Could the extra weight on Conor effect his cardio? Should we expect that?
705548334610698241 2016-03-03 00:20:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Eat light, King. Save your appetite for Nate's carcass on Saturday.
705547834448285698 2016-03-03 00:18:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma @a_dbears Sounds like a guy who picks him to lose every fight and when he finally does will act like he was right all along.
705519847803899904 2016-03-03 22:26:54 UTC <ScottyP922> The day Conor McGregor loses in the UFC Twitter will explode. #UFC196
705519575711027200 2016-03-03 22:25:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant I saw you hurling guys off the melee.
705519179068211200 2016-03-03 22:24:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker I would have been seriously freaked out if she was 7-0.
705518690440245248 2016-03-03 22:22:18 UTC <ScottyP922> The problem with Nate's training point is..like..results. He's an 18-10 mid carder trying to tell a champion how to prepare. #UFC196
705518331579785216 2016-03-03 22:20:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TommyToeHold If you look closely, Daniel Cormier throws a shoe in there.
705517563380436993 2016-03-03 22:17:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker She was 6-0.  Whew!!
705516805008322561 2016-03-03 22:14:48 UTC <ScottyP922> Nick Diaz jumped on stage just in case a joint fell out of anyone's pocket. #UFC196

705514808351834112 2016-03-03 22:06:52 UTC <ScottyP922> I apologize to everyone for my Conor obsession. I used to be a straight man.
705513959223328768 2016-03-03 22:03:30 UTC <ScottyP922> I've stalked him, hunted him down like my prey and Saturday night I will eat his carcass in front of his gazelle friends. #UFC196 #KingMac

705484558792331264 2016-03-03 20:06:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @ConanOBrien @TheNotoriousMMA You are able to tweet this. That means he spared you.   He is a compassionate King.
705419592194244608 2016-03-03 15:48:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @Boombearjr @mphoenix1603 @LedyardNFLDraft They're talked about at 2. Why would 1 be any different? Because the Titans have their QB.
705419277764009985 2016-03-03 15:47:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @Boombearjr @mphoenix1603 @LedyardNFLDraft Only because Tennessee just drafted their QB. Otherwise they would be.
705407314401075201 2016-03-03 14:59:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @hotdrafttakes @LedyardNFLDraft @mphoenix1603 Anyone who makes draft day decisions based off of 2016 entirely doesn't understand the draft.
705406999350153218 2016-03-03 14:58:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft But the fact is the Packers didn't use your approach. They thought about their future. Not a load up for an aging QB.
705406857289048064 2016-03-03 14:57:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft Are you too young to remember that draft? Rodgers wasn't graded like Luck.
705406596655030272 2016-03-03 14:56:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft The Packers kept their "window" open by drafting Rodgers in Favre's last years. Favre had a window. The team didn't.
705405814010417156 2016-03-03 14:53:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @mphoenix1603 @LedyardNFLDraft If the Packers had his mindset they never would have drafted Aaron Rodgers. Load up for Favre. Window closing
705405655469973505 2016-03-03 14:53:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @mphoenix1603 @LedyardNFLDraft He's too focused on 2016. Using the draft as an extension of FA.
705405097094848513 2016-03-03 14:50:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft Teams don't have windows players do. The only reason Cowboys window has to close is if they're not prepared for post-Romo
705404790197624832 2016-03-03 14:49:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft If just 1 of these 1st round QBs turns out to be legit, the Cowboys will look back with serious regret when they have no QB
705404623188795393 2016-03-03 14:49:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft Then we just disagree. No team that draft's successfully has a quick fix mindset. This is acquiring talent for the future.
705403757417394177 2016-03-03 14:45:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Lawler fans.   I am sorry. I didn't see this coming either. His head will be respectfully removed. It's just business. #UFC200 #McGregorEra
705403035594399745 2016-03-03 14:42:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft The NFL Draft is all about the future. Plug holes in veteran free agency. The way to go is QB if they have one graded high.
705402815729025024 2016-03-03 14:41:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft Disagree. Wentz is the real deal. He'll be one of the better QBs in the league over his career.
705396029747806213 2016-03-03 14:14:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft Talk to me when Romo goes down again and they have nothing at QB. They're heading for post-Aikman years.

705258548540919809 2016-03-02 05:08:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Sounds like you had a bad day, my friend. Hope tomorrow is better for you.
705256488009224192 2016-03-02 05:00:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma You will get tired of Conor proving you wrong.
705256278294032384 2016-03-02 04:59:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut @pdlmma Connor would destroy them.   McGregor would beat them too.

704820094266974208 2016-03-01 00:06:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker One thing you'll never ever hear McGregor say about any fight - "I might get murked."  Champion's mindset.
704819723016519681 2016-03-01 00:04:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @OnlineLurker Nate knows he's just collecting a pay check. He's only got a flukey submission chance. He can't stand with McGregor.
704819135159660544 2016-03-01 00:02:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Yes, you intimidated him by losing two in a row.   Pettis gets bullied in the cage. McGregor is a bully. Easy fight.

703815542868672512 2016-02-27 05:34:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant I'm surprised no judge had a 10-8 3rd round.
703808038898159616 2016-02-27 05:04:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiLIzZo1 @bisping @SpiderAnderson Thank you indeed, gentlemen. Its an honor to watch two warriors battle. Much respect to you both.
703773127545856000 2016-02-27 02:46:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @JustBleedMMA For some reason those UFC hashtags always auto at the start of cards and stop towards the end.
703772006081306624 2016-02-27 02:41:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @MakwanAmirkhani Great performance, my friend. Hope you're SBG full time now.
703752917300465664 2016-02-27 01:25:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA This man parks where it clearly says no parking. He just has no fucks to give. #UFC196 #TheWhateverTheFIWantLife
703751849564880896 2016-02-27 01:21:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @BushidoTalk @TommyToeHold Draw.
703750570063093760 2016-02-27 01:16:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch That's how I had it. 10-8 in the 3rd. 47-47 draw.
703749177151512576 2016-02-27 01:10:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @Patrick_Wyman Does she have a hook in?
703746342624038912 2016-02-27 00:59:37 UTC <ScottyP922> The only Nate that's gonna run the game in the UFC is @natedogmma1   This is light work for the lb for lb #1. #UFC196 #KingMac #McGregorEra
703744685219717120 2016-02-27 00:53:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You need a permit to carry that left hand in Nevada, King.
703737178564616192 2016-02-27 00:23:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @JoshOz76 @Izi_Garcia Yep. Dan Hardy was even talking about that after the fight.
703736929464881153 2016-02-27 00:22:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @Serenitydogg @Izi_Garcia Round 4 was hardest for me.
703735242784272384 2016-02-27 00:15:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @JoshOz76 @Izi_Garcia Definitely Silva.
703734413796839424 2016-02-27 00:12:13 UTC <ScottyP922> @lunatic29hd @robinblackmma Nobody's flim flammier than Robin.
703733818948124673 2016-02-27 00:09:51 UTC <ScottyP922> That fight was pretty simple to breakdown. Whoever was pressed against the fence was getting picked apart. #UFCLondon
703733187277516800 2016-02-27 00:07:21 UTC <ScottyP922> Happy for @bisping. Give that man his title shot @ufc. #UFCLondon
703731765551050752 2016-02-27 00:01:42 UTC <ScottyP922> Silva's clearly better but Bisping stole rounds because of Silva's inactivity. #UFCLondon
703731177849376768 2016-02-27 23:59:22 UTC <ScottyP922> I had it...  1 - 10-9 Bisping 2 - 10-9 Bisping 3 - 10-8 Silva 4 - 10-9 Bisping 5 - 10-9 Silva 47-47 Draw #UFCLondon
703729078327767040 2016-02-27 23:51:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Micsterator But he did the same thing before the injury. He got KO'd messing around.
703728751377584128 2016-02-27 23:49:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia How did you score it?
703728208756281345 2016-02-27 23:47:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Silva has only himself to blame. He spends so much time messing around and not firing. #UFCLondon
703724131532070912 2016-02-27 23:31:22 UTC <ScottyP922> I had it 47-47. #UFCLondon
703721575988731904 2016-02-27 23:21:12 UTC <ScottyP922> I've got it 38-37 Bisping. #UFCLondon
703718104199786497 2016-02-27 23:07:25 UTC <ScottyP922> 20-18 Bisping #UFCLondon
703716376356192256 2016-02-27 23:00:33 UTC <ScottyP922> 10-9 Bisping. Silva waited too long to start firing. #UFCLondon
703712848090939393 2016-02-27 22:46:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I want to see Bisping win just because it would be a shame if he never got a title shot.
703712440354271232 2016-02-27 22:44:54 UTC <ScottyP922> I really really hope Bisping wins this fight. #UFCLondon

703699799137251330 2016-02-27 21:54:40 UTC <ScottyP922> We live in a world where Kimbo/Dada goes 3 uninterrupted rounds but we can't see Silva/Bisping. #UFCLondon

703696343496265731 2016-02-27 21:40:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @kennyflorian I had to google it.
703695902830157824 2016-02-27 21:39:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst Disagree. Clear win for Rivera. Homer judging there.

703623571646619651 2016-02-27 16:51:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @TommyToeHold I'm pulling for Bisping because it would be a shame if he never fought for the title. I'm picking Silva by dec though.
703622941108473856 2016-02-27 16:49:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @LedyardNFLDraft I say 4.4, Jon. Still plenty fast.

702645536642494464 2016-02-24 00:05:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @dazzle_lax My friend, you would take Justin Bieber over McGregor.   They all will bow eventually.
702645039361564673 2016-02-24 00:03:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @rachelarojas Very good. Are you training for a fight or just to learn the discipline and get the great workout?
702639885014933504 2016-02-24 23:42:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @rachelarojas Yes, maa'm. I will. But I probably won't be on here for the main event. How is your MT training going, killer?

702634565962170369 2016-02-24 23:21:49 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor's a bully. It'll be much tougher to bully Diaz than it is the FWs. Interesting fight. If he just murks Nate just bow down. #UFC196
702634017124966400 2016-02-24 23:19:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut Oh you know you will. RDA has messed this all up.
702633618888388609 2016-02-24 23:18:03 UTC <ScottyP922> I've got McGregor TKO 2nd round. He's got to solve the puzzle of Nate's reach and advanced MMA boxing. #UFC196
702628005718265856 2016-02-24 22:55:45 UTC <ScottyP922> Now we get to see McGregor without the big reach advantage. Fighting a bigger man. It's a test but one I think he aces. #UFC196
702627030630735873 2016-02-24 22:51:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @Gatoroid76 @NateDiaz209 You asked the best questions. I'd have started a KB chant if I was there.
702626769854005250 2016-02-24 22:50:50 UTC <ScottyP922> I think the crowd reaction thru Nate off and it was downhill from there. He didn't expect to be stepping into Dublin West. #UFC196
702626001126199296 2016-02-24 22:47:47 UTC <ScottyP922> "Conor! Conor! Conor!" - McGregor/Diaz presser in southern CA.   Conor belongs to Ireland but he's been adopted by the world. #UFC196
702623669164453888 2016-02-24 22:38:31 UTC <ScottyP922> It's pretty damn remarkable to be on your opponent's turf and have the crowd chanting your name. #UFC196
702622554477850624 2016-02-24 22:34:05 UTC <ScottyP922> If Nate thinks the King's on steroids now, wait until after the fight. #UFC196
702620346176778240 2016-02-24 22:25:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @kennyflorian @JohnBalfe Saw stats showing he's average size WW. This is why I feel he's so untouchable at 145.
702618687124205568 2016-02-24 22:18:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate after his last fight: McGregor let's do this! UFC! I'm the money fight!  Nate today: They called me. I didn't ask. #UFC196
702618117315305472 2016-02-24 22:16:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @LouiseGreenMMA @MMACrazy Except, ya know, that whole begging in front of the camera after my last fight.
702617173123055616 2016-02-24 22:12:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @kennyflorian @KurtJermy_ That is correct.
702615232703655936 2016-02-24 22:05:00 UTC <ScottyP922> It's just a pay check for Nate. He knows he going to lose. That's why he mentioned having no camp. #UFC196
702614425690177537 2016-02-24 22:01:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P If you tell me when you're on I'll be sure to be on my best behavior!
702613867273162752 2016-02-24 21:59:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I think the UFC is hoping the fight's a little more competitive than this. #UFC196
702610830001483776 2016-02-24 21:47:30 UTC <ScottyP922> I'm amazed at how easily Conor is getting into Nate's head. #UFC196
702609695119269888 2016-02-24 21:42:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Can we possibly get a ref stoppage on this presser? The gangster's had enough. #UFC196
702608477462466560 2016-02-24 21:38:09 UTC <ScottyP922> The King confirms. Frankenstein's foot is merely bruised. #UFC196
702606948915490816 2016-02-24 21:32:05 UTC <ScottyP922> Make that street thug wait, King. This is your show. #UFC196
702605165388402689 2016-02-24 21:24:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @SuperDadMMA @02KimK @TheNotoriousMMA @danawhite @NateDiaz209 It's on http://UFC.com.
702604399995006976 2016-02-24 21:21:57 UTC <ScottyP922> I don't know about you but I just can't wait for Nate's street slang and middle fingers.   True gangster.  Soon headless gangster. #UFC196
702602703617261568 2016-02-24 21:15:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @darrenrovell @TheBMartin @elwinter The McGregor effect. I love it.
702600273349505024 2016-02-24 21:05:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @TheNotoriousMMA @NateDiaz209 @MMAHEAT @YouTube KB, please make sure you stand when our King enters.
702599015066673152 2016-02-24 21:00:33 UTC <ScottyP922> The Press Conference will start at half past whenever the F I want in Conor Standard Time. #UFC196 #RunningTheGame
702591294045102083 2016-02-24 20:29:52 UTC <ScottyP922> They all want it.....until they get it. #UFC196 #Dublin353GOAT #McGregorErapic.twitter.com/V0BAi3vfvt
702538564425424896 2016-02-24 17:00:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @SuperDadMMA Not sure but it will be streamed online. Keep an eye on Ariel's account. I'm sure he'll let us know.
702526300095967232 2016-02-24 16:11:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Oh, no. Not Nick Diaz.   I can't wait to hear him struggle to complete a coherent sentence.
702526228868276224 2016-02-24 16:11:19 UTC <ScottyP922> This is the time where the opponent says hes going to do something. Then he'll do nothing.   Here you go, boss. Another man killed. #UFC196
702525351998541824 2016-02-24 16:07:50 UTC <ScottyP922> The King has called a press conference today to announce his fight with some built up schmuck at #UFC196
702516220575281152 2016-02-24 15:31:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @mavs2011champs0 So I will say farewell to you. Enjoy the beheading.
702516124735447040 2016-02-24 15:31:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @mavs2011champs0 Cerrone doesn't deserve it either. Another B level fighter. I can see you're irrational in your love for this TV fighter.
702513772372619264 2016-02-24 15:21:50 UTC <ScottyP922> @wellsrandy52 @dpbrugler That's because you're short sighted and only thinking of next year. Take the franchise QB.
702484159604719616 2016-02-24 13:24:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @mavs2011champs0 Nate got destroyed by RDA. 18-10. 2-3 over the last 3 years. He's a B level fighter.
702368723408134144 2016-02-23 05:45:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Flip us off first!
702367623284191232 2016-02-23 05:41:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma @MikeBohnMMA He could have tried a different route though and earned it through winning fights.
702367383382564865 2016-02-23 05:40:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite @EddieWaz They are desperate, Dana. They're running out of excuses.
702366918410420224 2016-02-23 05:38:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @Godscrillla @Izi_Garcia @GunnolfHaley Izi once told me he thought Dada had great potential.
702366192544120832 2016-02-23 05:35:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @NateDiaz209 @TheNotoriousMMA We're not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe, KB!
702365890067767296 2016-02-23 05:34:12 UTC <ScottyP922> You would literally have to hold Aldo at gun point to get him to take a fight at 170. #UFC196
702365275757416448 2016-02-23 05:31:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @1juan_contreras @Izi_Garcia I'm not familiar with his style because I don't watch the prelims. Sounds like McGregor though.
702359482786058241 2016-02-23 05:08:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @1juan_contreras @Izi_Garcia I didn't ask how long. I'm asking why. You totally own him calling him McNugget though. Well played.
702355474776199168 2016-02-23 04:52:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @1juan_contreras @Izi_Garcia What's it like to love the guy who talks but can't fight and hate the guy who talks and can?
702352084599861249 2016-02-23 04:39:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @GunnolfHaley @LutzKeith @Izi_Garcia We heard this all before. It was ridiculous that he'd beat Aldo.   Conor KOs Lawler. Then you bow.
702351119201099779 2016-02-23 04:35:30 UTC <ScottyP922> The King will be greeted in the streets of Stockton after this one.   Tank you, Conor. We never liked him. #UFC196 #Dublin353GOAT
702349467509329921 2016-02-23 04:28:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHistoryToday Damn right. Meanwhile when Aldo said anytime anyplace he meant besides March 5th in Vegas.
702349013589176320 2016-02-23 04:27:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @CeeBret @robinblackmma Yes.
702347780224749568 2016-02-23 04:22:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia @JayBreezyDa1 The truth is he doesn't even deserve to be considered for this fight based on his record.
702347444936269825 2016-02-23 04:20:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @LutzKeith @Izi_Garcia LOL. Riiiiight.
702346650648379392 2016-02-23 04:17:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @LutzKeith @Izi_Garcia Do you mean because the judges always give him the decision when he loses a fight?   Conor doesn't go to the judges.
702346141141053440 2016-02-23 04:15:43 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't wait for Nate to flip Conor off.   Ya know, cause he's from the streets, dawg. #UFC196
702345760340246528 2016-02-23 04:14:12 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate Diaz. Now there's a guy who actually is just all talk. B level. Back to the prelims after this. #UFC196
702344268275281920 2016-02-23 04:08:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Tune into McGregorCenter now for the announcement of the King's next head to collect.   RIP, Nate Diaz. #UFC196
702326696905674752 2016-02-23 02:58:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler And if they're wrong they will look back with serious regret.
702319758864211968 2016-02-23 02:30:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting My God the swelling went right up to his eyebrows. That's bad.
702319523211382784 2016-02-23 02:29:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @TonyThumbPoke I'm definitely #TeamTony. Funnier. Doesn't lie about getting shows out. Better looking.
702319091793657857 2016-02-23 02:28:14 UTC <ScottyP922> Hafael just said sorry "to all my real fans".   Fighting the King isn't like any other. He's cracking under the pressure. #UFC196
702310298397622273 2016-02-23 01:53:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate earned 20/20 in his last fight. He should tank Conor right now for this lottery ticket. #Dublin353GOAT #UFC196
702309776290672640 2016-02-23 01:51:13 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor. Round 1. Via bitch slap. #UFC196
702308892647276544 2016-02-23 01:47:42 UTC <ScottyP922> People are still wondering if the main event will change.   Its McGregor. He will always be the main event. Opponent doesn't matter. #UFC196
702305540618240001 2016-02-23 01:34:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @mavs2011champs0 Nate is a B level TV fighter. Conor is the GOAT. This is a sacrifice not a fight.
702305046998945796 2016-02-23 01:32:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I was looking forward to seeing images of a Cowboy hat being kicked around the streets of Dublin but that will be another time. #UFC196
702304483326488576 2016-02-23 01:30:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @SuperDadMMA Ariel Helwani says it appears to be Nate and Conor's coach tweeted a smiling icon right after.   It's him.
702303708252663808 2016-02-23 01:27:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Nate Diaz it is.   He will run his mouth, let a few middle fingers fly and then get KO'd stiff.   Wake up, Nate. You're a rich man. #UFC196
702268758379749376 2016-02-23 23:08:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma @jake_lilley @GeorgiaRobson33 Absolutely. It tells you Robin is good people. Makes you root for his success.
702267679223238658 2016-02-23 23:03:56 UTC <ScottyP922> Waiting for McGregor to say RDA dropped out for a case of athlete's foot. #UFC196
702236600948932611 2016-02-23 21:00:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @DanaUnleashed Dana's in a particularly testy mood today.
702235898549837824 2016-02-23 20:57:39 UTC <ScottyP922> If it is Diaz, then I think Nate's a traitor to Stockton, Ca.  Don't ask me to explain. Conor will. #UFC196 #KingMac
702233508710899712 2016-02-23 20:48:10 UTC <ScottyP922> The talk of an interim title is nuts. RDA just fought in December. This isn't Aldo who comes out once a year to see his shadow. #UFC196
702232637931388929 2016-02-23 20:44:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @joannamma Am I ready for you?  No. #JoannaChampion #ShesTheBest #YaKnow
702232385891524608 2016-02-23 20:43:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @checkoayala @robinblackmma Then I think you don't understand McGregor. He stays active.
702208765123235840 2016-02-23 19:09:50 UTC <ScottyP922> "Abdelaziz claims Nurmagomedov offered his services but the UFC turned him down."  Ali is so full of [expletive] - @danawhite #UFC196
702207195572781057 2016-02-23 19:03:36 UTC <ScottyP922> All these managers out there saying they want to fight Conor but when it comes time to take a fight they turn it down - @danawhite #UFC196
702206146912919552 2016-02-23 18:59:26 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor said he'd fight any of them. I swear to God, he said 'I'll fight anyone.' He just doesn't give a [expletive]. - @danawhite #UFC196
702205639838318593 2016-02-23 18:57:25 UTC <ScottyP922> You think Conor's not hurt? But when he says he's going to fight, he's going to fight no matter what. - @danawhite #UFC196

702194193746284545 2016-02-23 18:11:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheDKano Probably a lot more accurate than most people are willing to admit.
702193698621300737 2016-02-23 18:09:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @VenezuelanVixen I don't know if you'll answer this but would you fight Miesha for the title?
702191600055803908 2016-02-23 18:01:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @realboxingguru Yeah, who wants the pay day of their life?
702187804332318721 2016-02-23 17:46:33 UTC <ScottyP922> Shout out to @chadmendes . There's a true fighter who will take a fight regardless of the risk. #UFC196
702187337892106240 2016-02-23 17:44:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @SuperDadMMA I'm not sure. I didn't even know about it until this morning.
702186002518044672 2016-02-23 17:39:23 UTC <ScottyP922> I'll run thru him like a truck with no brakes  ~KO~  I'll fight him anytime anywhere  ~RDA pulls~  Well, I'm not in shape right now. #UFC196
702184551259492352 2016-02-23 17:33:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia McGregor/CM Punk #UFC196
702184177710534660 2016-02-23 17:32:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @guicruzzz The difference between McGregor and Aldo.   And the media can't stand it.
702183783018143746 2016-02-23 17:30:34 UTC <ScottyP922> Just give the people what they want. McGregor/Diaz. It's a fun fight while Nate stays standing. #UFC196

702183303340802048 2016-02-23 17:28:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Hey, great. My girlfriend will fight him too and I date some pretty big chicks.
702182745146073088 2016-02-23 17:26:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @scs_mathias @KarynBryant As one sided as it would be on the ground it would be equally so on the feet.
702182637734068224 2016-02-23 17:26:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @scs_mathias @KarynBryant Scared? It would certainly be his toughest fight at 155 but fear would play no part in it. He doesn't duck.
702180252500492289 2016-02-23 17:16:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Aldo is not an option to fill in. He's already fought within the last 12 months. #UFC196

702166339717300224 2016-02-23 16:21:15 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor has to book Jesus a hotel in Jerusalem. #UFC196
702150742812057600 2016-02-23 15:19:17 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor actually has to book Donald a hotel in Colorado.   Might have to adjust the smack talk for this one. #UFC196
702150425651314688 2016-02-23 15:18:01 UTC <ScottyP922> I foresee a Cowboy hat being dragged thru the streets of Colorado as the people rejoice with their King over the gringo's beheading. #UFC196

702144876788453376 2016-02-23 14:55:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @Eitakreut For the same reason your son will be spending a lot of recesses at school alone to his own thoughts. #UFC396 #ReutterEra
702142344569692160 2016-02-23 14:45:54 UTC <ScottyP922> Hosay. Hafael. Honald. Hate Diaz. They are just bodies to the King. They will all be removed eventually.  #UFC196
702141580325613569 2016-02-23 14:42:52 UTC <ScottyP922> I can confirm the x-ray showed a clear break of RDA's spirit. #JustHandOverThatBelt #UFC196

702132183746658307 2016-02-23 14:05:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Still laughing at the media member who is now wondering whether McGregor co-mains for Holm.   Holy. Shit. #UFC196
702131767734640640 2016-02-23 14:03:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @RednckTruckrHat @Izi_Garcia And his resume over the last 5 years proves it.
702131641536397314 2016-02-23 14:03:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @RednckTruckrHat @Izi_Garcia My answer is he's not interested in fighting anymore than he has to. Like once a year to hold a title.
702131390851186689 2016-02-23 14:02:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @NinoBeige The best fight is Ferguson but that Khabib fight needs to happen. So let's end Nate's career.
702131014534041600 2016-02-23 14:00:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @RednckTruckrHat @Izi_Garcia Why does Aldo average a fight a year over the last 4 or 5 years?
702130456217649152 2016-02-23 13:58:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @The_Tom_Holmes @Izi_Garcia We must be very careful with this decision. We are ending a man's career.
702129912665268224 2016-02-23 13:56:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA LOLOL.   Did he just suggest McGregor could co-main for Holm?   These MMA media.
702122708314664960 2016-02-23 13:27:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @_buenavictoria You and me both, bro. But that's the fight game.
702122596284805120 2016-02-23 13:27:26 UTC <ScottyP922> I hope it's not a broken eyebrow ridge. I'd like to see this fight sometime this decade.  Heal (Man) up, Hafael. #UFC196
702121198990151680 2016-02-23 13:21:53 UTC <ScottyP922> It's his opponents that are actually all talk.  He will be there. Like he always is there.  #UFC196 #McGregorEra
701639785979338753 2016-02-21 05:28:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Congratulations on the new LW championship, King.   Da da da da da, it's the mf'n G-O-A-T. #McGregorEra
701623749506789376 2016-02-21 04:25:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @AM_MIXED Very bad matchup. Wouldn't have been good coming off the last fight.
701623209813118976 2016-02-21 04:23:03 UTC <ScottyP922> Cerrone is fortunate Means fell out. He'd have put a beating on him tonight. #UFCPittsburgh
701622181487226881 2016-02-21 04:18:58 UTC <ScottyP922> Hey, look. The genius media that's been wrong on McGregor all along is now telling us what he can do from here.   That's cute. #McGregorEra
701618132297723904 2016-02-21 04:02:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Did everybody see McGregor disappear in that promo?   Ghost, my ass. Gods aren't the only ones who recognize Gods. #UFCPittsburgh

701612279364620288 2016-02-21 03:39:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA Then you need to get a ton of tattoos and fight.
701601793625759744 2016-02-21 02:57:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Riggs/Shamrock.   Enjoy that future 6th round, Zane.
701601469213102080 2016-02-21 02:56:40 UTC <ScottyP922> You know what I wish they'd show more? Holly Holm's KO of Ronda Rousey. #UFCPittsburgh
701599405808422914 2016-02-21 02:48:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia King, I think Riggs is ready for Bellator.
701599286459559937 2016-02-21 02:47:59 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow. I expected it to be somewhat competitive at least. #UFCPittsburgh
701598848003743744 2016-02-21 02:46:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @vinny_craig Woodley doesn't deserve it, IMO.
701598245680783360 2016-02-21 02:43:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma @BrianStann But he's only the greatest living American because you're Canadian and McGregor's Irish. ;)
701596914417082368 2016-02-21 02:38:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @mookiealexander McGregor's holding up the Lawler/Condit rematch.
701596696468447232 2016-02-21 02:37:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Krause disappointed in his performance. Bummed that he couldn't finish.   Welcome to my world, James. #UFCPittsburgh
701577319442489347 2016-02-21 01:20:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @TommyToeHold What did you do to piss him off, Tommy?
701576606112944128 2016-02-21 01:17:52 UTC <ScottyP922> He's coming for McGregor but wisely will not use his name in vain. #UFCPittsburgh

701574255708921856 2016-02-21 01:08:31 UTC <ScottyP922> He believes he will dust Hafael inside of one minute. #UFC196

701569686270566400 2016-02-21 00:50:22 UTC <ScottyP922> Smith went to the MMA holy lands (SBG) to walk in the footsteps of our King a couple of weeks ago. It's showing. #UFCPittsburgh
701566097699409920 2016-02-21 00:36:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA We are watching the other schmucks tonight, King. Building them up is good business.

701540010344853506 2016-02-21 22:52:27 UTC <ScottyP922> After Kimbo/Dada, I feel like I'm watching Ali/Frazier here. #UFCPittsburgh

700921586048589824 2016-02-19 05:55:03 UTC <ScottyP922> I mean, Shamrock got screwed. But I'm willing to ignore that if it means no rematch. #Bellator149
700920535929085952 2016-02-19 05:50:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @TommyToeHold I know. I feel bad laughing at it considering these guys are pioneers.

700916191322181632 2016-02-19 05:33:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting There's always hope.
700912724310491136 2016-02-19 05:19:50 UTC <ScottyP922> It's a disgrace but I bet the ratings were good. #Bellator149

700907861669326848 2016-02-19 05:00:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @hey @Hey, we all took a shot to the nuts tonight. Why should Ken Shamrock be any different? #Bellator149
700906732457820160 2016-02-19 04:56:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia These are not feints. This is Parkinson's.
700904792801972225 2016-02-19 04:48:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Had one of them come out to Lawrence Welk and bubbles I would have pissed my pants in laughter. #Bellator149
700904342857977857 2016-02-19 04:46:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @Johnydamonsbear I haven't seen such a pathetic effort out of two fighters since the last FvsWrvsF, KB.
700904092810371072 2016-02-19 04:45:32 UTC <ScottyP922> Okay, @danawhite ...you can stop laughing. #Bellator149
700903076769755136 2016-02-19 04:41:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia And now comes a fight where both fighters might do the DaDa dive just climbing the steps.
700901948195782657 2016-02-19 04:37:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia New York: SEE?! THAT'S WHY!!
700900287427584001 2016-02-19 04:30:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @danawhite would call this a comedy. #Bellator149
700900090496557056 2016-02-19 04:29:38 UTC <ScottyP922> The pace these guys are keeping is unbelievable. #Bellator149
700899799046950912 2016-02-19 04:28:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Why did Lawler/MacDonald win FOTY in 2015? Because this fight happened in 2016.
700897163103117317 2016-02-19 04:18:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Jiu-jitsu clinic. Pay attention.
700894850456166400 2016-02-19 04:08:49 UTC <ScottyP922> This Kimbo fight isn't lasting a minute. #Bellator149
700890172028796928 2016-02-19 03:50:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Just to be clear, that was the guy who wondered why he wasn't paid like McGregor. #Bellator149
700878547221667841 2016-02-19 03:04:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma I've got DaDa by D'Arce choke tonight.
700865397663203328 2016-02-19 02:11:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @cberryy @BloodyElbow English here.
700864417399898112 2016-02-19 02:07:53 UTC <ScottyP922> If Kimbo is correct, McGregor's nuts must be enormous. #Bellator149

700492114455494656 2016-02-18 01:28:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @NASCAR @DaleJr Way to leave your teammate high and dry in typical Jr. fashion. Classless.

700029793190944768 2016-02-17 18:51:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani They must trust Herb to pull the King off before there's any permanent damage.

699824172294410241 2016-02-16 05:14:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @realboxingguru It's why Mendes didn't leave his corner at the start of the fight.
699823254995931140 2016-02-16 05:10:40 UTC <ScottyP922> @realboxingguru Jones would beat Cain and Conor will win this fight.   This isn't Aldo. He actually wants to fight all comers.

699620374003056641 2016-02-16 15:44:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Don't like it. That makes it easy to not make any changes and assume it'll go different next time.   It won't.

698887206849679360 2016-02-14 15:11:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Happy Valentine's Day to my Valentine, the great Danielleminator, @D_curtis6   She'll change your bum life. Have a great one, my dear.

698743572598644736 2016-02-13 05:40:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Oops. That's right. I'm looking at it now. I've got you mixed up with another.
698742952789565440 2016-02-13 05:37:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler I'm putting in a request for round projection at the end of each player breakdown.
698742329859936256 2016-02-13 05:35:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani Lol. Tell that to the TV ratings. What Ariel means is the NBA is HIS  favorite sports league. NFL dwarfs NBA in popularity.

698547301590175744 2016-02-13 16:40:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow No. Continue to keep exposing those cheats. The media has given them a free pass for far too long.
698495051018719232 2016-02-13 13:12:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom Have to defend the FW belt next or vacate it, IMO. Even though the last FW champion rarely fought and everyone was ok with it
698361891102576640 2016-02-12 04:23:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc For the second time.   Tank him right now. #KingMac #UFC196

698221000719265792 2016-02-12 19:03:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @Miguel_RJS Riiiiiiight. Like he couldn't beat Aldo or Mendes.   You will soon be out of excuses, Miguel. Then you will bow to your King.
698213446639357952 2016-02-12 18:33:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @Miguel_RJS @sherdogdotcom LOL. He "dodged" him by KOing stiff the guy who beat Frankie.  Spare me.

697977391725936640 2016-02-11 02:55:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 LOL..of course! I'll even give you a little of the Cruz footwork if you agree to sleep me with a straight left hand.

697971545268887552 2016-02-11 02:32:38 UTC <ScottyP922> @JohnMcCarthyMMA @brettjelfs That's only because Aldo got slept so quickly. Tough to say much in 13 seconds.
697824619978477570 2016-02-11 16:48:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler @JC1053 And if I'm the Cowboys and my scouting department has a franchise grade on a QB that's the guy I get. At 4 or even 1.

697793246706200582 2016-02-11 14:44:09 UTC <ScottyP922> @chaseelliott I did the math many years ago to see when you'd be eligible for this. Proud to be a fan. Best of luck.
697480022077132800 2016-02-10 17:59:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Word has it CM Punk injured his back when he picked up Ariel and his nose. #UFC
696880542390874113 2016-02-08 02:17:23 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler Congrats, Dane.

696800387647410176 2016-02-08 20:58:52 UTC <ScottyP922> Donald Cerrone is on a different level than McGregor. - RDA #themmahour   LOLOLOLOL

696797433838247937 2016-02-08 20:47:08 UTC <ScottyP922> RDA lying and claiming all kinds of Irish fans want him to beat up McGregor. #themmahour
696796552875024384 2016-02-08 20:43:38 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor's a low life. But I'm not taking it personal. - RDA #themmahour

696772583786745856 2016-02-08 19:08:24 UTC <ScottyP922> Alvarez would last maybe two minutes with McGregor. GTFO here. #themmahour

696575098908762117 2016-02-07 06:03:39 UTC <ScottyP922> @Dzamora07Dz Two beautiful ladies.
696574498645143552 2016-02-07 06:01:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA King, when a friend asks you to give them a hand, for the love of God, give them your right one. #McChapo #LeftHandShot
696549986515972096 2016-02-07 04:23:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @AM_MIXED  Thompson. Anyone who can do that to Hendricks deserves an immediate title shot.
696549756085129216 2016-02-07 04:22:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @KyleBusch Yeah but Denver actually played the entire season and finished with the most points.
696549333358014464 2016-02-07 04:21:16 UTC <ScottyP922> So is anybody else disturbed by this puppymonkeybaby commercial?
696547391055532032 2016-02-07 04:13:33 UTC <ScottyP922> I can't wait to see the look on CM Punk's face the first time Micky Gall punches him in the face without stomping his foot for effect. #UFC
696546622738731008 2016-02-07 04:10:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeffphowe Women melt over stuff like that.   The man knows how to romance the broads.
696546189379051520 2016-02-07 04:08:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Denver Broncos. Carolina Panthers. I only care about the Dublin Gorillas.   Tick tock, Frankenstein. #UFC196 #McChapo #McGregorEra
696509312630390785 2016-02-07 01:42:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Who are you again?
696221973999910912 2016-02-06 06:40:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Strike that. Reverse it.
696221727936929792 2016-02-06 06:39:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @sherdogdotcom And I won. And I got to go home to Megan Olivi.   I'm playing the world's smallest violin for ya, Joe. #UFCVegas
696215204355510272 2016-02-06 06:13:34 UTC <ScottyP922> I think Rory would be the toughest matchup for Wonderboy right now.   Until Conor makes his way up and KOs everyone stiff. #UFCVegas
696212681737564160 2016-02-06 06:03:32 UTC <ScottyP922> The biggest compliment I can give to Wonderboy is he fights like McGregor. #UFCVegas
696211420300582912 2016-02-06 05:58:32 UTC <ScottyP922> If he can do that to Hendricks, he'd behead Lawler. #UFCVegas
696210862709800960 2016-02-06 05:56:19 UTC <ScottyP922> Wow. Just wow. #UFCVegas
696208089670877184 2016-02-06 05:45:18 UTC <ScottyP922> Again, I hate this main event. Love both fighters and don't want to see either lose. #UFCVegas
696207582659223552 2016-02-06 05:43:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Promise me you won't talk about this fight on the 6th round.
696204858068746240 2016-02-06 05:32:27 UTC <ScottyP922> Rosholt showing a lot of respect for Nelson's infamous ground game. #UFCVegas
696203969249599489 2016-02-06 05:28:55 UTC <ScottyP922> This is a barn burner. #UFCVegas
696200118509428736 2016-02-06 05:13:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow The way my picks are going, I'm going to say F it and take Nelson by flying armbar.
696199081014792193 2016-02-06 05:09:30 UTC <ScottyP922> The crowd needs to settle down. Business is about to pick up. Jared Rosholt's next. #UFCVegas
696195904823562240 2016-02-06 04:56:53 UTC <ScottyP922> @realboxingguru They put ice on it.
696188347761340416 2016-02-06 04:26:51 UTC <ScottyP922> I've got it 19-19 but I'm guessing there are a lot of 20-18 cards for Joe. #UFCVegas
696183165363298304 2016-02-06 04:06:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow I feel like Joe B is going to start to show decline soon but I just can't pick him to lose this one.
696175861276549120 2016-02-06 03:37:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow  Pyle is a very interesting prospect.

696165211095621633 2016-02-06 02:54:55 UTC <ScottyP922> Probably change some things. Probably shouldn't lose 18 lbs in a day. #UFCVegas
696156068502773760 2016-02-06 02:18:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @NSyarylla Agreed.

696154582741811205 2016-02-06 02:12:41 UTC <ScottyP922> That is how I expect CM Punk to finish Micky Gall. #UFCVegas
696154281494376448 2016-02-06 02:11:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Rough night for picks.
696153184876818432 2016-02-06 02:07:07 UTC <ScottyP922> Is there any chance we can get "bum version of Aldo" worked into Buffer's intro? #UFC196
696151980935417857 2016-02-06 02:02:20 UTC <ScottyP922> Honestly, you could just have McGregor staring into the camera for 30 seconds and I'd think it's the greatest promo ever. #UFCVegas #UFC196
696150914026098688 2016-02-06 01:58:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Well alright. Apparently Scoggins is going to beat Mighty Mouse soon. #UFCVegas
696150384604246016 2016-02-06 01:56:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant @MickeyKnox420 Yes, I always have to remind myself that she's married and I probably shouldn't say what I'm thinking.
696144572578197504 2016-02-06 01:32:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @ZProphet_MMA For Punk's sake, I hope Ariel has really good takedown defense. #UFCVegas
696142060475310080 2016-02-06 01:22:55 UTC <ScottyP922> This doesn't look good for Lahat. Hope he's okay. #UFCVegas

696140325098799104 2016-02-06 01:16:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @WallyFrogmore I hope so.
696137741059358720 2016-02-06 01:05:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma I'm expecting a thorough breakdown on Gall's flim flam, Robin. ;)
696135982022848512 2016-02-06 00:58:46 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Especially around little kids. Just don't trust them.
696135538689105924 2016-02-06 00:57:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow That made me literally laugh out loud.
696135111532748800 2016-02-06 00:55:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMALatestNws @TheMMAnalyst He will fight at 200. I'd bet money on it.
696134718790750208 2016-02-06 00:53:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @WallyFrogmore Oops. Sorry. Wrong fight. Artem just got out struck for 3 rounds. 30-27 on all three scorecards.
696134052563304448 2016-02-06 00:51:06 UTC <ScottyP922> Can't wait for the @BloodyElbow fights to make from this card to see who they give Mike Jackson. #UFCVegas
696133409870102530 2016-02-06 00:48:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @WallyFrogmore Gall clipped him on the chin, knocked him down and pounced on a rear naked choke. 45 seconds and its over.
696132743089020929 2016-02-06 00:45:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @Benaskren @postfightpress @Sean13Michael @ufc You need more confidence, Ben. You could at least take Jackson to a split decision.
696132338422571009 2016-02-06 00:44:17 UTC <ScottyP922> Punk wants to go backstage with Gall and work on the finish for their fight. #UFCVegas
696131498320269312 2016-02-06 00:40:57 UTC <ScottyP922> I've never seen Mike Jackson manhandled like that. Statement win. #UFCVegas
696130729739227136 2016-02-06 00:37:54 UTC <ScottyP922> This kid is a title contender. #UFCVegas
696130457268781057 2016-02-06 00:36:49 UTC <ScottyP922> Love watching Micky Gall fights. #UFCVegas
696128507127209985 2016-02-06 00:29:04 UTC <ScottyP922> And so goes Lobov's UFC career more than likely. #UFCVegas
696123032990019585 2016-02-06 00:07:19 UTC <ScottyP922> He's creating jobs.  He's hoping Gall gets the golden ticket.  He's got a killer beard.  Conor called. He wants his schtick back. #UFCVegas
696122076294488064 2016-02-06 00:03:30 UTC <ScottyP922> Punk's got his McGregor beard in full effect. #UFCVegas

695439167262568449 2016-02-04 02:49:52 UTC <ScottyP922> @DustinPoirier @starkeyjoe1 It really is. Especially right here on twitter.

695437667618545664 2016-02-04 02:43:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Meaningless. Just like all the other "expert" opinions in the past.

695301547480203264 2016-02-04 17:43:01 UTC <ScottyP922> People can cry about Conor's influence but it makes no sense to not promote a champ vs champ fight. Not a typical title defense. #UFC196

695043466615746561 2016-02-03 00:37:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @Motomoto1122 The only win McGregor didn't finish was the fight he blew his knee out in the 2nd round.
695042564999757824 2016-02-03 00:33:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @davedoylemma All I know about Denis Siver is he's a German midget steroid head. That's my thoughts on that.
695042009489395712 2016-02-03 00:31:42 UTC <ScottyP922> Rockhold: I don't care when it is just not 199.   #UFC : Rockhold/Weidman set for #UFC199.

695030773330632704 2016-02-03 23:47:04 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jason_Floyd That when you fight once a year if that, back out of 5 title fights and get slept in 13 seconds you probably shouldn't complain
695018547592962048 2016-02-03 22:58:29 UTC <ScottyP922> In another time he would invade ur favela on horseback and kill anyone not fit to work.  Instead he lets you watch his #UFC career. #McChapo

694409254741151744 2016-02-01 06:37:22 UTC <ScottyP922> @bwlaughlin @joerogan Conor is 1 inch taller. When the fight ends he'll be about 5 feet taller. #KO #UFC #KingMac
694408595576848384 2016-02-01 06:34:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @bwlaughlin @joerogan LOL. He's taller and longer than RDA.
694303762874261504 2016-02-01 23:38:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl That's not the discussion I was having.   Do you typically respond off topic?
694303301039452160 2016-02-01 23:36:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Its a meaningless argument.
694303255476723712 2016-02-01 23:36:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Actually I don't. Pay doesn't increase age and experience. His pay is irrelevant in terms of his development.
694302837245939713 2016-02-01 23:34:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl And that is why the comparison I responded to was a horrible one.
694302732790960131 2016-02-01 23:34:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Well then youre unreasonable. Take that 19 year old football player in the NFL. Pay him a huge salary. He's still a 19 year old kid
694302014092791808 2016-02-01 23:31:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl You're fixated on pay. Probably because you dislike the guy. Pay means nothing in terms of experience and age.
694301813214945281 2016-02-01 23:30:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Is this what you're telling me? This is a serious adult argument?
694301705438130177 2016-02-01 23:30:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Are you seriously telling me you expect a 19 year old to do in the UFC as a 19 year old playing college sports?
694300255576289280 2016-02-01 23:24:15 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 Don't they know who you are, Danielle? ;)
694299688925843456 2016-02-01 23:21:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Congrats @ufc for this tremendous honor.
694291281829335043 2016-02-01 22:48:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl With Sage, you have to expect him to make mistakes. Considering he's a kid in man's game. Seems obvious to me. No comparison.
694291019676979200 2016-02-01 22:47:33 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl So you can hold that college player to a higher expectation and be more quick to criticize.
694290896481837056 2016-02-01 22:47:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Being paid more doesn't increase his age or experience. A college player competing against peers should fare better.
694280897344966658 2016-02-01 22:07:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl Pay has absolutely nothing to do with it.
694280790604128256 2016-02-01 22:06:54 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl One is competing against his peers. The other is not. Simple as that. The college player should have more success.
694280613738725376 2016-02-01 22:06:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @tantryl I never said hed get no criticism but to say if you can't criticize him then you can't a college player either is wrong
694269794024030209 2016-02-01 21:23:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Robinson15 It was an awful comparison.
694269728395780096 2016-02-01 21:22:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Robinson15 My point is an athlete in college is competing against other kids with similar experience. Sage isn't.
694261583917219840 2016-02-01 20:50:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Robinson15 That wasn't the discussion though. Comparing Sage to a kid playing in college was.
694260174425583616 2016-02-01 20:44:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Robinson15 Paycheck is irrelevant to experience.
694260032310001670 2016-02-01 20:44:25 UTC <ScottyP922> @Mr_Robinson15 I don't know what to tell you. He's still 19. Comparing him to a kid playing in college is foolish.

694177206570991616 2016-02-01 15:15:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @benfowlkesMMA Right. But this would be like a freshman playing in the NFL. Of course it's unfair to judge him like a more seasoned pro.
694176381371076608 2016-02-01 15:12:01 UTC <ScottyP922> @benfowlkesMMA @MMAjunkie But a college football player is playing against other college football players. Sage is being judged as a pro.
694160871170383873 2016-02-01 14:10:23 UTC <ScottyP922> Rest In Peace Featherweight Division  2010-2015  #KingMac #McGregorEra #UFC

693911615520030721 2016-01-31 21:39:56 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor tapped to a knee bar.   As long as Sage gets a chest tattoo and throws more left hands he'll be fine. #UFCNewJersey
693904881887920129 2016-01-31 21:13:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @dc_mma It's pretty obvious what you mean to anyone with a brain, DC.   Much respect, Champ.
693870288300285952 2016-01-31 18:55:42 UTC <ScottyP922> @BoxingBusch I'll be interested in hearing what you think Sage's "quick" submission means, if anything, for his future.
693821270119616512 2016-01-31 15:40:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @303Chaz @Izi_Garcia Sage is so young so it's understandable. Weidman had no excuse.
693817226344927232 2016-01-31 15:24:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA The King and Queen.   They've got the fight game in the trunk.
693815368050155520 2016-01-31 15:17:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @303Chaz @Izi_Garcia I thought the same thing when it happened.
693811851109474304 2016-01-31 15:03:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @scooterboydom @Izi_Garcia LOL. I was even on the wrong side of him.
693808191793152005 2016-01-31 14:48:57 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia I ran into Sage after the fight. Shook his hand and he started frantically tapping my arm.
693646331626295296 2016-01-30 04:05:47 UTC <ScottyP922> @AM_MIXED There is only one. #KingMac #McGregorEra

693626519617458176 2016-01-30 02:47:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @Jenet68P Johnson KO in first or Bader sub late. I'll go the underdog.
693626328088735744 2016-01-30 02:46:18 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia I seriously think either he gets murked in the first or he wins the fight.   Rumble's a quitter. Like Josh Barnett.

693472482465046529 2016-01-30 16:34:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @crabtooch @dallascowboys Broaddus doesn't pay attention to the draft until January. When he starts fielding draft questions. LOL

692526440068321280 2016-01-27 01:55:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch I'm going to go against better judgement and say Bader survives round 1 and grinds out AJ. 3rd round sub.

691738711776694272 2016-01-25 21:45:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia Meanwhile, in McGregor Land...  Conor, they just changed the opponent.  It doesn't matter. They're all the same.
691734421658009601 2016-01-25 21:28:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @guicruzzz says no champion would take a new fight on two weeks notice while injured.   Um, I know 1 who would, bro. #McGregorEra #UFC196

690770457205805056 2016-01-22 05:38:05 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie BTW, Brazilian...I'm not a fan of Cain. At all. It's you that carry the bias.
690770274074136576 2016-01-22 05:37:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie Or you could follow the real golden rule. Respond to what was actually said.
690761075462160386 2016-01-22 05:00:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie Not sure what debate you think you're having.
690760998744100864 2016-01-22 05:00:30 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie I said Werdum makes no sense to say he fought in the same altitude. As if it played no factor.
690748672825561089 2016-01-22 04:11:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie "I fought at the same altitude"  Yeah. And he prepared for it. Cain didn't.
690748369497636864 2016-01-22 04:10:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie Right...and that still has nothing to do with the comment I responded to.
690746388439777280 2016-01-22 04:02:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @bferrflu @MMAjunkie And that has nothing to do with what I or he said.

690709185244303361 2016-01-22 01:34:37 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAjunkie Do any of these Brazilians ever make any sense? 1 was acclimated to it, 1_wasn't. Maybe it won't matter in the rematch.
690690843078979584 2016-01-22 00:21:44 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch I have all the respect in the world for BJ but nobody is immune to their skills declining with age. Return is bad idea, IMO.

690578271851798529 2016-01-22 16:54:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow To not promote two champions fighting is just asinine. You don't treat this like any other title defense.

690383886786916352 2016-01-21 04:01:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAHWatch I don't think the UFC can do a 4th Edgar/Penn fight. He's lost to him 3 times. The last 2 weren't close.
690383215018819584 2016-01-21 03:59:19 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 Well then we won't agree. It is a champ vs champ. To promote it like any other title shot is a mistake.
690376855644434432 2016-01-21 03:34:03 UTC <ScottyP922> @D_curtis6 This isn't a typical challenger. They didn't promote GSP/Penn this way. Champ vs. champ is a special event.

690353254052581376 2016-01-21 02:00:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @BloodyElbow Don't like this fight at all for Ferguson.
690322586195091457 2016-01-21 23:58:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheMMAnalyst I think so too. I think Sage is heading for a loss soon and that's okay. Part of the process.
690320522031304704 2016-01-21 23:50:12 UTC <ScottyP922> @LiessiePiessie What? You don't like the UFC's strategy of promoting this champion vs. champion fight by only recognizing 1 champion?
690319742406692864 2016-01-21 23:47:06 UTC <ScottyP922> @KarynBryant You're not supposed to read those. You'll lose faith in humanity.
690173432630267905 2016-01-21 14:05:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @SeanSheehanBA I have to admire a man who can break Barao thru a TV screen like that.
690172794177458176 2016-01-21 14:03:11 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Hey, what if we all see McGregor as we approach that white light when we die? We'd shit ourselves, right? #UFC197
690023435771199491 2016-01-20 04:09:41 UTC <ScottyP922> @TommyToeHold @gezimzim93 Tommy's  ducking the Vitor video.
689995679985471490 2016-01-20 02:19:24 UTC <ScottyP922> @robinblackmma @DevinVandale @rory_macdonald My guess is the winner of Hendricks/Thompson.
689995528596295680 2016-01-20 02:18:48 UTC <ScottyP922> @dpbrugler @CBSSports Is he top 5 worthy if he has a strong showing in workouts and interviews?
689995075930230785 2016-01-20 02:17:00 UTC <ScottyP922> McGregor's left hand vs. Frankenstein's eyebrow ridge.   The irresistible force meets the immovable object. #UFC197
689994258137350148 2016-01-20 02:13:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA We can not stop this man. Resistance is futile.   Honey, a young gorilla took everything we own. #UFC197 #McChapo
689993680040677376 2016-01-20 02:11:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA Today he offers you his right hand. Fight night you get the left.   Sleep well, Frankenstein. #UFC197 #KingMac
689993244512522241 2016-01-20 02:09:43 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @davedoylemma I want to see Pettis fight Nate Diaz. It lines up now. Let's do this. #UFC
689992644336967681 2016-01-20 02:07:20 UTC <ScottyP922> The man left home, traveling camp to camp. I will behead him and drag his head thru the streets of Bethlehem.   McGregor/Jesus #UFC 215
689944133151145989 2016-01-20 22:54:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting Bum version of Aldo.   That's fair.
689916991428259840 2016-01-20 21:06:43 UTC <ScottyP922> Dana thought bubble - As soon as you start losing, you're out of here, kid. #UFC197pic.twitter.com/UQDakj3UKL
689913736438636546 2016-01-20 20:53:47 UTC <ScottyP922> Okay, how do we promote this champion vs champion main event?   I'm thinking one belt.   I like it. Let's go with that. #UFC197
689910149255950336 2016-01-20 20:39:32 UTC <ScottyP922> @SBNLukeThomas speaking the truth on this main event in his chat right now. #UFC197
689909766462803968 2016-01-20 20:38:00 UTC <ScottyP922> RDA made a good point being too big for him being an inch shorter and with 4 inches less reach. #UFC197
689906699478634497 2016-01-20 20:25:49 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAdamMartin @postfightpress Looks the same in every staredown. A mean mugging Frankenstein.   He will collapse and you will use an excuse.
689906351603109888 2016-01-20 20:24:26 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAdamMartin @postfightpress LOL. Ahuh.
689905173683113985 2016-01-20 20:19:45 UTC <ScottyP922> There is simply no way Dana isn't getting tired of McGregor. Loves the money but the mouth has to annoy him. #UFC197
689904602385403906 2016-01-20 20:17:29 UTC <ScottyP922> @jeremybotter @postfightpress Which is why he'll collapse and you guys can go on to the next guy who's going to be the one.
689902630970232834 2016-01-20 20:09:39 UTC <ScottyP922> Conor needs to have more self confidence. #UFC197
689900256129978368 2016-01-20 20:00:13 UTC <ScottyP922> Holly Holm has the charisma of wet paint. #UFC197
689897605468291080 2016-01-20 19:49:41 UTC <ScottyP922> Did anybody else hear Lorenzo yell out "precision beats power!"? #UFC197
689896659476606976 2016-01-20 19:45:55 UTC <ScottyP922> They may have a parade for Conor in Brazil after this. #UFC197
689896326016856068 2016-01-20 19:44:36 UTC <ScottyP922> Can Herb Dean run in and stop this? #UFC197
689895871194923009 2016-01-20 19:42:47 UTC <ScottyP922> What's great about this is Miesha Tate can't stand Conor and has to sit right next to him for this. #UFC197
689895452334915585 2016-01-20 19:41:08 UTC <ScottyP922> This man is ready to destroy the whole roster in 4 months.   We could be watching the end of the UFC. #UFC197
689890720618942468 2016-01-20 19:22:20 UTC <ScottyP922> @John_Kavanagh He's never late. Everyone's early.
689887833486655489 2016-01-20 19:10:51 UTC <ScottyP922> They have to talk Frankenstein out of the closet. Bare with us. #UFC197 #McGregorEra
689886603620306944 2016-01-20 19:05:58 UTC <ScottyP922> @Kevin_F_Maloney @TerezOwens @Angela_Rypien What is it?
689885138625294338 2016-01-20 19:00:09 UTC <ScottyP922> Hear ye hear ye..announcing the honorable King Conor McGregor I. AKA the fight game. He will now address his people. #UFC197
689882655748263936 2016-01-20 18:50:17 UTC <ScottyP922> @ufc @MGMGrand @vine The McGregor effect.
689881441530986496 2016-01-20 18:45:27 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @PaigeVanzantUFC "A couple of months" fits shooting a movie. My guess.
689881111175008256 2016-01-20 18:44:08 UTC <ScottyP922> @arielhelwani @PaigeVanzantUFC Movie.
689850239897833472 2016-01-20 16:41:28 UTC <ScottyP922> @MikeBohnMMA From one King to another.
689829277265727488 2016-01-20 15:18:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @RndmBaseballFan @MelKiperESPN He also factored in one of the Redskins UDFA. LOL. Cmon.
689828522567819264 2016-01-20 15:15:10 UTC <ScottyP922> @DRkneevil Ah, you look beautiful. No worries.
689826953298366465 2016-01-20 15:08:56 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMAFighting @guicruzzz Yeah and I want Salma Hayek to show up on my doorstep professing her love for me.   Life sucks, Frankenstein.
689826213335031808 2016-01-20 15:06:00 UTC <ScottyP922> @RndmBaseballFan @MelKiperESPN We won't get a response but that kind of inconsistency is unprofessional. And I'm a fan of Mel.
689807657864187904 2016-01-20 13:52:16 UTC <ScottyP922> @MelKiperESPN So Rawls is part of Seattle's class, but fellow UDFA La'el Collins isn't part of Dallas?  Interesting.
689693480956870656 2016-01-19 06:18:34 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA I know what color panties Mrs. Frankenstein will be wearing.
689693146876395520 2016-01-19 06:17:14 UTC <ScottyP922> @ashleyencalada @TheNotoriousMMA He predicts dees tings.
689692799164379136 2016-01-19 06:15:51 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You will break him. #KingMac
689667003456552961 2016-01-19 04:33:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN Frankie ahead of the Champ and the former Champ who beat him? TJ ahead of them all?
689660418269298688 2016-01-19 04:07:11 UTC <ScottyP922> Tomorrow he breaks him. The fight becomes a mere formality. #UFC197 #McGregorEra #DoneInOne
689653305983778817 2016-01-19 03:38:55 UTC <ScottyP922> @PasserbyRandom You need an ESPN Insider subscription to see it.
689650302669160450 2016-01-19 03:26:59 UTC <ScottyP922> @bokamotoESPN Your lb for lb ranking is a joke.
689641081651216385 2016-01-19 02:50:21 UTC <ScottyP922> @DeeganMarcus Give him hell. His McGregor experience starts tomorrow.
689635213564088320 2016-01-19 02:27:02 UTC <ScottyP922> @jessicaevileye  It's a shame Evil is such a good nickname, because Hairy Toes isn't bad.
689620136857309185 2016-01-19 01:27:07 UTC <ScottyP922> @Izi_Garcia If McGregor was assaulting my Mother, I'd tell her to stop resisting.
689618786119503877 2016-01-19 01:21:45 UTC <ScottyP922> @TheNotoriousMMA You see a group photo. He sees three possible attackers and has a plan formulated to deal with each threat.
689618302512041984 2016-01-19 01:19:50 UTC <ScottyP922> Don't forget #UFC197 press conference tomorrow.   Our King gets to smell Frankenstein's p****.   #KingMac
689612937401602049 2016-01-19 00:58:31 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource As if.  Who the hell is going to serve that summons?
689598612419002368 2016-01-19 00:01:35 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource And I think it's not fair for the fighters to not have any representation when the agreement was negotiated.
689598363377999878 2016-01-19 00:00:36 UTC <ScottyP922> @MMANewsSource Serra needs his own show.
