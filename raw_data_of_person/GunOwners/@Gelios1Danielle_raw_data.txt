971736431323381760 2018-03-08 13:16:33 UTC <Gelios1Danielle> @KameronBennett It is sad, cuz ill guarentee it takes a good portion of their life wasted til they realize money or the shit you buy with it doesnt care about them one bit and doesnt take away loneliness, make ppl loyal or trustworthy, n what good is being surrounded by wealth alone..???

971732309354348544 2018-03-08 13:00:11 UTC <Gelios1Danielle> @tlgelios Yes my love but there are players and then there are champions.the real question should be, in life which of those are you prepared to play? A teammate, player, all around mvp maybe even, or full on Champion.cuz there's no choosing both n no going back...food for thought
