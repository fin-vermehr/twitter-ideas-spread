875071533777137665 2017-06-14 19:24:46 UTC <fiannafailparty> While we would certainly have differences with Min Flanagan re urgency and ambition, he is only Gov Minister to show interest in the North
875070687156875265 2017-06-14 19:21:24 UTC <fiannafailparty> It is at best unfortunate that so many appointments have been made on basis of internal party concerns rather than selecting best person

875009466525241344 2017-06-14 15:18:08 UTC <fiannafailparty> Deputy Varadkar himself said last year that the latest budget is the first fair one of his partys time in office - @MichealMartinTD
875009373030010880 2017-06-14 15:17:46 UTC <fiannafailparty> The most important thing which has been achieved is that Fine Gaels divisive approach to budgets has been curtailed - @MichealMartinTD
875008956892164097 2017-06-14 15:16:06 UTC <fiannafailparty> The very definition of the job of Taoiseach and the government is to represent all of the people - @MichealMartinTD
875008893067329536 2017-06-14 15:15:51 UTC <fiannafailparty> Success will be if you understand how wrong you were to say if you try to represent everyone you will represent no one - @MichealMartinTD
875005149944655873 2017-06-14 15:00:59 UTC <fiannafailparty> The last 6 years has seen every policy put in new covers and stamped with the words Action Plan - Inaction must end - @MichealMartinTD
875004844586795008 2017-06-14 14:59:46 UTC <fiannafailparty> Taoiseach Varadkar's tactical obsession with managing headlines can only work for a while - @MichealMartinTD
875004455565090816 2017-06-14 14:58:13 UTC <fiannafailparty> There will come a point when the soft coverage ends and accountability begins - @MichealMartinTD
875004233032110082 2017-06-14 14:57:20 UTC <fiannafailparty> It is striking that the strong support which he won in his PP was not reflected in the  broader FG membership - @MichealMartinTD
875003950512123904 2017-06-14 14:56:13 UTC <fiannafailparty> Taoiseach Varadkar's ability to spin every minor development in one of his departments as a step-change is notable - @MichealMartinTD
875003714590957568 2017-06-14 14:55:16 UTC <fiannafailparty> His skill at avoiding hard news and distancing himself from the controversies of a government he sat in was remarkable. - @MichealMartinTD

875003151639859201 2017-06-14 14:53:02 UTC <fiannafailparty> The new Taoiseach, by instinct, is more inclined to prioritise deregulation and tax cuts ahead of a more social emphasis - @MichealMartinTD
875002859087167488 2017-06-14 14:51:53 UTC <fiannafailparty> Deputy Varadkars views would be significantly more right wing on most economic topics than the centre-ground consensus - @MichealMartinTD
