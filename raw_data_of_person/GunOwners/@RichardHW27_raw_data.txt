970452058502520832 2018-03-04 00:12:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Over paid actors and actresses telling everyone about gun control has either been paid millions in a violent movie and have armed security. #Oscars #hypocrites
969206609435156481 2018-03-01 13:43:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheCoachrules Stop being sheep? U would think that the WWE would want us to be sheep for liking the God awful storylines they put out. Here is a first put something out thats entertaining. No saturated over and over and over.
968894032205185031 2018-02-28 17:01:53 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the back is going on with #SmackdownLive? The show is turning into garbage.
968589354745593856 2018-02-27 20:51:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @WWE isn't @WWEAsuka suppose to choose her champion to wrestle? #WhatTheHeckHappen
967846573576212481 2018-02-25 19:39:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RondaRousey @AndrewKarluk If she doesn't she'll fit right on in with half the wwe superstars.
965764771596337152 2018-02-19 01:47:19 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw boring
963551909868077057 2018-02-13 23:14:11 UTC <RichardHW27> Breaking news: @WWE has added me to the #EliminationChamber match. It will be an 8 man match n da chamber. #WWE realize their mistake to make it even.
963164198523097089 2018-02-12 21:33:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN is totally in luv with a brutal murderous dictator sister.
962761813099237376 2018-02-11 18:54:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN has gone full liberal crazy. They have fallen in love with a murderous dictator sister.
960634930500947969 2018-02-05 22:03:09 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE going to end @WWEAsuka streak after #Wrestlemania? Could @RondaRousey end it? Seems like it. But I hope not.
959442821676716032 2018-02-02 15:06:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Politics poisoned ones soul when someone can make a joke about a death like @StephenKing did. Wake up America.
958386332841205761 2018-01-30 17:08:02 UTC <RichardHW27> What no @RondaRousey for Monday Night Raw. Maybe tonight on #SmackdownLive?
957854839920316416 2018-01-28 05:56:04 UTC <RichardHW27> Loved seeing @RondaRousey tonight @ the #RoyalRumble.
953859939545608192 2018-01-17 05:21:46 UTC <RichardHW27> @fox5dc @BrittMcHenry They will pick up a new viewer for the rest of the werk.
947954073222950913 2018-01-01 22:13:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL My #RusevResolution is more #Rusev!
946154430319218689 2017-12-27 23:02:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry Same media hacks who said we won't have a 3% GDP. No new jobs. Stock Market will crash soon after he is elected. They r running out of toys to throw from their fits.
941888216747204608 2017-12-15 04:30:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry That's great to hear. Very inspirational.
931244794222915586 2017-11-16 19:37:15 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @nflcommish I would like 50 million dollars and a private jet 4 life.
930546706835525637 2017-11-14 21:23:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Good luck to @MsCharlotteWWE tonight. Hoping she shows how dominant the true #Queen really is.
930541333630119936 2017-11-14 21:01:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Props 2 the couple who got the biggest pop on #WWE. @WWE u need to hire them.
928027388067368960 2017-11-07 22:32:25 UTC <RichardHW27> What r u thinking @WWE. U ruined the main event by announcing the winner.
927714468305436673 2017-11-06 01:49:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Can u believe @jefflongUA telling people to b astate fans if we didn't like @ArkRazorbacks losing? He is a joke.
927556278813159424 2017-11-06 15:20:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks had 60 or more plays and @Just_Theron were on only 12 of those plays? Wait..what? 4-5 coach. There is a reason
926933662008045568 2017-11-04 22:06:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Thanks @jefflongUA for hurting Arkansas football.
925534035161636864 2017-10-31 01:24:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @BrockLesnar @WWEUniverse Let me give the answer in my language to my people...No
925371528799309824 2017-10-31 14:38:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thanks for burying the club. @KarlAndersonWWE and @LukeGallowsWWE why?
925205778893598721 2017-10-30 03:40:21 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thank God for dvr.
924777670143037440 2017-10-29 23:19:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Sucks to hear @EmmaWWE was released. But don't fret fans #Emmalina will debut tomorrow night
924749585020542978 2017-10-29 21:27:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys u ain't winning crap until u fix that weak was defense
922837668240809985 2017-10-24 14:50:20 UTC <RichardHW27> Just watched @WWE and wished I skipped the @FinnBalor match. Great job on the creative writing there. SMH
921918641481965570 2017-10-21 01:58:27 UTC <RichardHW27> Attention @jefflongUA #MRGA. That's good not great.
921917641425604608 2017-10-21 01:54:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how much is integrity worth? 27-31 is my guess
921916530081886208 2017-10-21 01:50:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA is working on a new conyract extension..shouldmt he work on the resignation of @BretBielema..pathetic
921914115127377920 2017-10-21 01:40:28 UTC <RichardHW27> As usual @ArkRazorbacks halftime adjustments is giving up more points at a faster pace.
921913274375000064 2017-10-21 01:37:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks defense could field 22 men and still not stop anyone. SMH
921912718092853250 2017-10-21 01:34:54 UTC <RichardHW27> From all the SEC schools..Please Arkansas keep @BretBielema.
921906090337624065 2017-10-21 01:08:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks OL is good something. Holding and false starts. #WPS #WooPig
921904420740362242 2017-10-21 01:01:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks. Their football team is terrible.
921018087398354945 2017-10-19 14:19:58 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm not surprised @BretBielema blames everyone and anything for 5 years of mediocrity other than himself.
920999685560643584 2017-10-19 13:06:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE creative writing is lazy boring and repetitive. Reason why ratings r way down.
920467991090946050 2017-10-17 01:54:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RaymondScott94 @BraunStrowman Braun said he isn't finished with u yet
920289335617998849 2017-10-17 14:04:10 UTC <RichardHW27> @FinnBalor @WWEBrayWyatt @WWEUniverse Has @WWE Wlost their mind with this messed up story.
920267754342617088 2017-10-17 12:38:25 UTC <RichardHW27> Man @WWE last night #Raw had a lot of empty seats. I guess #theguy couldn't draw more than 10.000 seats. @CodyRhodes was right
919964346846990336 2017-10-16 16:32:47 UTC <RichardHW27> Who started this? #wps #BretBielemaFiringClock #Arkansas #razorbackspic.twitter.com/f9sajWBtDa
919954508108713984 2017-10-16 15:53:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @CodyRhodes is right. He does sell and draw more than any #wwe superstars. WWE was already built not so much 4 RHO or NJPW.
919760524224679938 2017-10-15 03:02:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @redturn2 u sexy beast! 3 run bomb!
918921280275001344 2017-10-13 19:28:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Also the @NCAA suspends college FB player for making money off their YouTube channel.  They r a joke. Reason why the FIB cleans up mess
918920817706233856 2017-10-13 19:26:10 UTC <RichardHW27> But @NCAA wontg suspend UNC 4 putting athletes in classes that never met?
918920214238191616 2017-10-13 19:23:46 UTC <RichardHW27> The @NCAA is a joke and an embarrassment. Suspends a player 4 5 games over $3.07
918479267977154560 2017-10-12 14:11:36 UTC <RichardHW27> The @MattJackson13 and @NickJacksonYB is creating probs 4 #WWE.  More entertaining than the crap WWE puts out every week.
918449644925005825 2017-10-12 12:13:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @MATTHARDYBRAND Please don't. Stay in the Indies. WWE will bury u . I don't even know this Matt Hardy now. Broken. Woken. Extreme. Boring
918117108705263616 2017-10-11 14:12:31 UTC <RichardHW27> I hope ther rumors isn't true that @WWENeville quit @wwe. #wwe #TheKingOfTheCruiserweights
917960865424596993 2017-10-10 03:51:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @SamiZayn U mean when life gives u lemons give rosebuds
917757145587822603 2017-10-10 14:22:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE the #SHIELD  is back? Lol  What's next? @AJStylesOrg is being fed to Jinder Mahal?
917503511902019585 2017-10-09 21:34:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @BretBielema throw some of his players under the bus? They haven't developed yet? Do ur job coach. Ur evaluation of players is subpar
917497350565883904 2017-10-09 21:09:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA and Arkansas negotiating a new contract Dear God say it ain't so. Jeff pisses on the football program once again. #WPS #uncommon
917466214905122816 2017-10-09 19:06:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin I can't see my dick
917441699730874368 2017-10-09 17:28:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN was so damn good in @WWENXT. But soon he gets called up @VinceMcMahon buries him against trash Jinder Mahal.
917391335304331264 2017-10-09 14:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Losers do get rewarded with title opportunities. They gave one to Mahal.
917220733822095360 2017-10-08 02:50:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @SamiZayn @RusevBUL @ShinsukeN u r being buried whole trash like Jinder is champ. Let that sink in. Poor @WWEAsuka it won't b long r u 2
917218842967003137 2017-10-08 02:43:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin AJ will be fed to that piece of garbage.
917217875584274435 2017-10-08 02:39:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH builds them and @VinceMcMahon buries them. Please Hunter make #WWE as good as @WWENXT
917215644663283712 2017-10-08 02:30:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWERoadDogg @WWE @ShinsukeN @RealJoeCronin Rusev vs Nakamura in a total buried match. The loser will have to put over the two Jinders oompa loompa
917214551413846016 2017-10-08 02:26:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Rusev joins Shinsuke in I keep getting buried
917214113474011137 2017-10-08 02:24:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE who's next r u going to bury? @AJStylesOrg is next? I hope u those subscriptions in India will replace ur loss here.
917213539894480896 2017-10-08 02:22:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE way to ruin Shinsuke Nakamura.
917213309862121472 2017-10-08 02:21:08 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is garbage.
917169890276073472 2017-10-08 23:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Dear God @dallascowboys get a damn defense. Freaking pathetic.
917128499781042176 2017-10-08 20:44:08 UTC <RichardHW27> The @dallascowboys defense is just as bad as @ArkRazorbacks defense. Both r pathetic.
916805992117166080 2017-10-07 23:22:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks football team is a dumpster fire. @jefflongUA can't buy out @BretBielema but can Arkansas buy at Jeff Long? #Uncommon #WPS
916802556772474880 2017-10-07 23:08:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @MikeAndersonUA please make us forget about this football team.
916799844529917952 2017-10-07 22:58:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @jefflongUA Arkansas loses again. Can we at least get a #WooooPig out of U? Pathetic
916796333524160512 2017-10-07 22:44:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks football team. They aren't coached worth crap. Their football team is very poorly coached. #Uncommon
916795220402036737 2017-10-07 22:39:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @ZaringGroup @grandfavallarta @EmmaWWE Can I watch?
916794894903136256 2017-10-07 22:38:30 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas is #Uncommon when getting their ass kicked.
916006261157744640 2017-10-05 18:24:45 UTC <RichardHW27> Appreciation tweet 4 @TripleH 4 the great work for @WWENXT
915917838795378688 2017-10-05 12:33:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @StephMcMahon @ITVLorraine Don't they bury enough women wrestlers?
915602773479215105 2017-10-04 15:41:26 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh God please @WWE don't let @WWEBrayWyatt play #SisterAbigail. Do not bury Bray more than u have
915261735342346241 2017-10-03 17:06:17 UTC <RichardHW27> WTH is up with @WWE Raw last night? Where is @TripleH when they need him. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
914574865339965452 2017-10-01 19:36:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys defense is horrible. If Dallas is going to challenge Philly they need to correct it fast.
913012725856505857 2017-09-27 12:09:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish shouldn't u listen to the people who pay those over paid spoiled athletes?  And u who is way over paid. #Stand
912840458614841344 2017-09-26 00:44:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @DIRECTV way to go if true.
912673242380464128 2017-09-26 13:40:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @NFL and nfl owners u have a problem. Get the damn politics out of our game.
912421964903538694 2017-09-25 21:02:03 UTC <RichardHW27> If these rich athletes from the @NFL seek to protest the Anthem how bout them no play the game and show us how much their beliefs are
912363430425907201 2017-09-25 17:09:27 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys let's hope 100% player participation in the respect for Our National Athem
912348300338253825 2017-09-25 16:09:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish fines players fo r dancing in the end zone. Fines players support for family suffering from cancer
912348104808108034 2017-09-25 16:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish wouldn't let the Cowboys wear support for Dallas PD last year protecting protesters

907703534233276416 2017-09-12 20:32:41 UTC <RichardHW27> When is @jefflongUA going to get it? Wins doesn't matter? It matters to the ones who have season tickets. He'll get it real soon. #WPS
907279718633918464 2017-09-11 16:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Has #SmackDownLIVE been boring since Jinder been champion? I have lost interest.
906647288533188608 2017-09-09 22:35:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @BretBielema need to go. He is hurting my school.
906582201260761088 2017-09-09 18:16:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @Jay_3085 Very true. But I was mainly talking about It the clown Tim Curry.  I guess I'm old school compared to today's special effects stuff
906001107079528448 2017-09-07 03:47:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @officialchilli Seen it as well. I liked the older one better. Tim Curry as It was spooky. May need to see it again.

899464219351015425 2017-08-20 02:52:35 UTC <RichardHW27> What sucks more than @WWERomanReigns? #SummerSlan sucks worse
899460019854487552 2017-08-20 02:35:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH needs to run all 3 brands. What he has done with #NXT is just crazy good. #Raw and #Smackdown needs Triple H. #SummerDump
899459038714314753 2017-08-20 02:32:00 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam? No it's #SummerDump
899458375083274240 2017-08-20 02:29:22 UTC <RichardHW27> I have no idea why they even have this stupid match. To build 3 man band Jinder? @WWE I'm just dumbfounded. Lazy ass booking #wwe
899457923876892672 2017-08-20 02:27:34 UTC <RichardHW27> Lazy ass booking by @WWE. What junk of a show. #SummerSlam is garbage
899457611959070720 2017-08-20 02:26:20 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam is garbage. What a piece of junk. @WWE I'm canceling after this garbage. I know u won't care. Total BS
899423544161054720 2017-08-20 00:10:58 UTC <RichardHW27> Aliens have captured #SmackDownLIVE creative.
899411433598988289 2017-08-20 23:22:50 UTC <RichardHW27> @BlissfulQween RIP Baron Corbin. You just been Bayley'ed
899410650555969536 2017-08-20 23:19:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Rip @BaronCorbinWWE
899289192521502720 2017-08-20 15:17:06 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish ratings will continue to drop if u can't fix getting politics out of football. U have to understand that.
899104029229428736 2017-08-19 03:01:19 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWENXT is the shits. What a show. Good job everyone.
899073438056427520 2017-08-19 00:59:46 UTC <RichardHW27> #NXTTakeOverBrooklynIII is on fire tonight. #SAnity new tag team champions.
898206194740932608 2017-08-17 15:33:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEFandango u may b right. @WWE creative team may have been abducted by aliens.
898182646848790529 2017-08-17 14:00:05 UTC <RichardHW27> OMG I just watched #SmackDownLIVE and #wtf. What did @BaronCorbinWWE do to deserve that crap? Another @JohnCena burial. RIP Baron Corbin
897796150220247040 2017-08-16 12:24:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn giving more dumb clickbait with their politics.
897596335834136576 2017-08-15 23:10:17 UTC <RichardHW27> Be prepared @NFL to take more of a hit of ratings this year.
895858081208422401 2017-08-10 04:03:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShawnMichaels and @TripleH Chyna was DX before DX was cool just like u
895721834896908289 2017-08-10 19:01:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Who deserves to be in the @WWE HOF more? Owen Hart? Chyna? Miss Elizabeth?
895715575212756995 2017-08-10 18:36:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Shouldnt the @WWE women wrestlers should follow @ReneeYoungWWE lead and cross promote? It would be better than seeing the same matches.
895707541136691201 2017-08-10 18:04:53 UTC <RichardHW27> I use to say #MakeWWEGreatAgain but until @WWE lose tv money they won't care about ratings bookings and PPV's. SMH
895075080639664128 2017-08-08 00:11:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @WWE stop doing the Slammy Awards? I forgot.
894756902843830272 2017-08-07 03:07:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Toronto how could u boo @itsBayleyWWE? Shame on u
894736108587700225 2017-08-07 01:44:46 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh look a member of #SmackdownLive @ReneeYoungWWE on #Raw. Makes sense
894646644527906819 2017-08-07 19:49:16 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE just put another nail in the coffin for kayfabe. #DieKayfabe
894433415403102209 2017-08-06 05:41:58 UTC <RichardHW27> https://youtu.be/cYg-z7KrKjY  Remember 23 years ago when @IAmJericho was known as #thrillseekers?
893983966105133056 2017-08-05 23:56:01 UTC <RichardHW27> "There is two things u don't forget #elephants and #thrillseakers" @IAmJericho
893467529653493761 2017-08-04 13:43:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN will win WWE title at #summerslam2017 but @BaronCorbinWWE will cash in his #MoneyInTheBank briefcase. Don't let this happen #WWE
893196437399515136 2017-08-03 19:46:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn going all political again. Let the #madness  stop
893166124753444866 2017-08-03 17:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWE was serious about the psychology and believability they should bring in @JakeSnakeDDT. Get rid of #DaysOfOurLives writers.
892215784327589889 2017-07-31 02:49:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @BigCassWWE needs to lay off on the spray tan.
892206083065958400 2017-07-31 02:11:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Is it time for @real1 to go to @WWE205Live? I hope @wwe has plans for him
892198734901194753 2017-07-31 01:42:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt went from #NewFaceOfFear to EateryOfWorlds? What have @WWE done to him?
891431805668163584 2017-07-29 22:54:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @AJStylesOrg The poster is only to promote the 3rd biggest PPV of the year. It sucks that AJ isn't on it. But after the PPV the part timers will be gone
890977749032198144 2017-07-28 16:50:23 UTC <RichardHW27> Do you feel like the Women's Revolution is becoming stale? Or better better yet hurt in some way with the brand split? #NiaLive
890439331361554432 2017-07-26 05:10:54 UTC <RichardHW27> Will the #RoyalRumble2018 in Philly be as loud as they were when @WWERomanReigns won in 2015?
890303345012899840 2017-07-26 20:10:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @ReneeYoungWWE @WWE That is why is brand split is just pointless
890297502578167808 2017-07-26 19:47:20 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWENeville is on @WWE205Live why isn't @KalistoWWE on 205Live? Give @KalistoWWE a chance. #WWE
890264469208780802 2017-07-26 17:36:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE took away pro because they say it isn't relevant. Next they will take entrance music out becuz it hurts the ears. #WWE #BringBackPyro
890196861398732800 2017-07-26 13:07:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @IAmJericho @WWE @SashaBanksWWE Everybody goes back to Raw. That's why the brand split is pointless
890063678883729408 2017-07-25 04:18:12 UTC <RichardHW27> When @WWE put on a crappy #BATTLEGROUND PPV they totally redeem themselves with #SmackDownLive
889608358474502144 2017-07-24 22:08:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Wait @NiaJaxWWE and @AlexaBliss_WWE is going to be on the new season of Total Divas? No more of Women's Revolution. #WWE
889598347551682560 2017-07-24 21:29:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Please @WWE let #MondayNightRAW be better than the crap we watched last night. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
889597621530185728 2017-07-24 21:26:15 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RusevBUL You deserve better
889592611106947072 2017-07-24 21:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm still sick to my stomach from watching #Battleground2017. The return of @WWE from 2008-2011.
889480306645979137 2017-07-24 13:40:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @Wee Please @WEE end the fued between @RandyOrton and @JinderMahal. Randy Orton deserves much better.
889478268860211200 2017-07-24 13:31:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Is this when I cancel @WWENetwork until a few days before #WrestleMania?
889478033148710913 2017-07-24 13:31:03 UTC <RichardHW27> For me it was the booking and the way the  matches ended. Nothing last night got me pumped for #summerslam2017
889477495703183361 2017-07-24 13:28:55 UTC <RichardHW27> I don't know what to think about @WWE.  Last night #Battleground2017 was forgetful.
889349052646797312 2017-07-23 04:58:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @JohnCena @WWE Rusev was better off staying off TV. He was more relevant then.
887510745168179201 2017-07-18 03:13:45 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN Thank you King of Strong Style!

887133296907386880 2017-07-17 02:13:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE has lost their minds. Did they hire the same writer who wrote the Katie Vick storyline? #WWE #MondayNightRAW
885269948679028737 2017-07-12 22:49:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJeffJarrett is done running his ponzi scheme (GFW) it seems he is full force keeping @MATTHARDYBRAND from his creation. #fuckthatowl
884448480168734720 2017-07-10 16:25:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Does @WWE have the guts for a double turn tonight?
883906442998231041 2017-07-08 04:31:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheRealXPac It's not that WWE sucks it's just that ROH and NJPW are killing it. WWE live events are great but their tv shows are too watered down.

880421802681528320 2017-06-29 13:44:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Keep @WWEAsuka and @NikkiCrossWWE in @WWENXT.  Do not ruin them on the main roster.
878307077390716928 2017-06-23 17:41:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE  has ruined the women's revolution. Time for the title to go back to Diva title. Sucks for the true women wrestlers. #WWE
877627970919297024 2017-06-21 20:43:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE ruining the women's division on raw? And #SmackDownLIVE where is half the talent?
876865848211906560 2017-06-19 18:14:44 UTC <RichardHW27> Now @NFL is going political. Ratings will drop even more
866486959635660801 2017-05-21 02:52:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @wwe gain viewers in India loses viewers in America. #WTF #WWE

864223169586049024 2017-05-15 20:57:14 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is the news for...politics.
859554100010266629 2017-05-02 23:44:01 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @WWEBrayWyatt @RandyOrton @WWE Yes the mean street posse is back!
859454842682703872 2017-05-02 17:09:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is still going political. And ratings going down and people losing jobs.
857331129812168705 2017-04-26 20:30:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @DilfersDime deserves better. One of the best. Hope to see him on TV soon
857305290257158144 2017-04-26 18:48:03 UTC <RichardHW27> Feel bad 4 the guys who lost their job @espn. So does that mean no more politics BS and just sports? I hope.
857061494890037248 2017-04-25 02:39:18 UTC <RichardHW27> No @BeckyLynchWWE on #SDLive? What a shame.
857025131541127168 2017-04-25 00:14:48 UTC <RichardHW27> I forgot that @WWE has a PPV this Sunday. How did that happen?
856952904917319682 2017-04-25 19:27:48 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the heck is the @WWE doing with @FinnBalor? Dang @BraunStrowman? No hope against @WWERomanReigns. The writers such for @WWE.
856481039669133312 2017-04-24 12:12:47 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt @WWE Another loss
856199994621251584 2017-04-23 17:36:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @VinceMcMahon call @JohnCena the Babe Ruth of the #WWE? That is too funny. Too many before him. Maybe the Pete Rose of the WWE.
855893853542461446 2017-04-22 21:19:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @KalistoWWE @WWE @RealKurtAngle Braun vs Kalisto? Look out Rey Kalisto another human dart
854809278175170560 2017-04-19 21:29:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @RandyOrton @JinderMahal @WWEUniverse Jinder getting a title shot? I'm sure Kurt Hawkins is pissed. Now if we James Ellsworth to juice up he may get a title shot.
854805152590692354 2017-04-19 21:13:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn @FoxNews has competition for political rhetoric. @ESPN is catching up.
854548515917377536 2017-04-18 04:13:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE really? Jinder Mahal? Catch on #MondayNightRAW @TheCurtHawkins will win #1 contender for Universal Title.
851979172545167361 2017-04-11 02:03:58 UTC <RichardHW27> @ilikesamizayn What a great main event on #SmackDownLIVE. @AJStylesOrg @iLikeSamiZayn and @BaronCorbinWWE put on a show. A+.  #WWE

851964669833220096 2017-04-11 01:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> So #SmackDownLIVE women's division is pretty much all heels.
851910286810468353 2017-04-11 21:30:14 UTC <RichardHW27> Will we see @SashaBanksWWE on #Smackdown tonight? #WWE
851909052296822785 2017-04-11 21:25:20 UTC <RichardHW27> My #WMmoment would be the @MATTHARDYBRAND and @JEFFHARDYBRAND return. Also seeing the Undertaker last match.

851506696367341568 2017-04-10 18:46:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @MATTHARDYBRAND needs to be traded tonight and when Smackdown tag titles. Why not it will be the titles relevant again. #WWE

848517178894766081 2017-04-02 12:47:14 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEAsuka @WWE The title doesn't make the champion. The champion makes the title. Asuka is the best.

847483239606370307 2017-03-30 16:18:44 UTC <RichardHW27> I have a feeling that @FinnBalor will make a heel turn at #Wrestlemania33. #WWW #Wrestlemania
846916377025937410 2017-03-28 02:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Where was @DeanAmbroseNet? He wasn't on #Smackdown tonight. Very weird.
846901516753485824 2017-03-28 01:47:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Smackdown is so much better than Raw. The storytelling is much better. #Smackdown #Raw
846886715398742016 2017-03-28 00:48:22 UTC <RichardHW27> @NatbyNature @NaomiWWE @WWE Naomi bringing the glow
846830839707111425 2017-03-28 21:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> Will @FinnBalor join Triple H in his new regime come #Wrestlemania? We shall see. #WWE
846801027353456642 2017-03-28 19:07:52 UTC <RichardHW27> Will #Smackdown tonight be better than #Raw?Hopefully we get a better send off show tonight leading up to #Wrestlemania33
846574980963975168 2017-03-27 04:09:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEUniverse @WWE There will be 29 holes for 29 souls. No..Smackdown is my home..No. Roman u will rest in peace
846561395177115649 2017-03-27 03:15:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE If this was just a normal Raw it would be good. But not the last raw before Wrestlemania. 4/10
846536189557587968 2017-03-27 01:35:30 UTC <RichardHW27> What the heck did I just watch with the New Day? Dumb. #Raw #WWE
846526923140419586 2017-03-27 00:58:40 UTC <RichardHW27> The man @WWERollins is back!
846517814198448128 2017-03-27 00:22:29 UTC <RichardHW27> @SimpleSaeedGold The WWE does their best to block as much of the crowd

844567594657075200 2017-03-22 15:13:00 UTC <RichardHW27> How do u get @WWERomanReigns over? Turn him heel and have him join the authority. #WWE #Raw #MondayNightRaw #Wrestlemania33

842428747005464576 2017-03-16 17:33:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Who's ready for Wrestlemania? More like #Boremania. Where is @FinnBalor? Where is @ShinsukeN? Frick Roman Reigns. #WWE #Raw
841829764285505537 2017-03-14 01:53:50 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw and #Smackdown did not build or excite me for Wrestlemania.
841822807923265538 2017-03-14 01:26:12 UTC <RichardHW27> AJ vs Shane? Who would a thunk it. Come on #Smackdown you are better than this.
841809593114206209 2017-03-14 00:33:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Is AJ Styles waiting on Kurt Angle? #WWE #Smackdown
841677078256865280 2017-03-14 15:47:07 UTC <RichardHW27> Way to go @WWE to build up Wrestlemania. I have no interest on the Raw brand. Hopefully #SmackDownLIVE is much better. #WWE #Raw #Smackdown
841483867961851905 2017-03-13 02:59:22 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE No Finn Baylor? 3 weeks until Wrestle mania? WTH. #WWE #Wrestlemania

838778167955447808 2017-03-06 15:47:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is it too late to get my 3 hours back watching that crap last night.  I know bring back Flair to go over @FinnBalor? Good grief.
836340868823003136 2017-02-27 22:22:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Really @WWE Beth Phoenix? What about Woman? Miss Elizabeth?
836198862754885632 2017-02-27 12:58:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @oscars Thank you @Oscars for showing your ignorance and your political BS. One of the reasons why liberals lost the Whitehouse. Unite not divide.
831543511673626624 2017-02-14 16:39:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Thank you @Thegrammysrp_  for allowing us to see more of the ones who keep promoting more division between us. # unite #America
831355424809050112 2017-02-13 04:12:33 UTC <RichardHW27> For 8 years they taught peace tolerance and unity. Now many of those are the most intolerant and hateful people. Let's unite not divide.
830073016247783424 2017-02-10 15:16:43 UTC <RichardHW27> The tolerant=intolerant. The peaceful minds are the ones usually use violence.  America stand together not divided. #America #Together
829371329379971072 2017-02-08 16:48:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how many were at the game last night?  Thank goodness for free pizza!
829167448662368256 2017-02-07 03:18:19 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas lost to Vanderbilt? How does that happen?  @jefflongUA I hope you watched the game. Many wished they didn't.

825827290126962693 2017-01-29 22:05:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win tonight @AJStylesOrg or @JohnCena?
825760470397308928 2017-01-29 17:40:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win the Royal Rumble? Please @WWE let it be someone not expecting to win it. Surprise angle is much more fun.

694866804179652608 2016-02-03 12:55:30 UTC <RichardHW27> 2 bad @Tyrie_1 didn't pick Arkansas. You would be a superstar @Florida but u would be legendary at Arkansas. #WPS
970452058502520832 2018-03-04 00:12:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Over paid actors and actresses telling everyone about gun control has either been paid millions in a violent movie and have armed security. #Oscars #hypocrites
969206609435156481 2018-03-01 13:43:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheCoachrules Stop being sheep? U would think that the WWE would want us to be sheep for liking the God awful storylines they put out. Here is a first put something out thats entertaining. No saturated over and over and over.
968894032205185031 2018-02-28 17:01:53 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the back is going on with #SmackdownLive? The show is turning into garbage.
968589354745593856 2018-02-27 20:51:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @WWE isn't @WWEAsuka suppose to choose her champion to wrestle? #WhatTheHeckHappen
967846573576212481 2018-02-25 19:39:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RondaRousey @AndrewKarluk If she doesn't she'll fit right on in with half the wwe superstars.
965764771596337152 2018-02-19 01:47:19 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw boring
963551909868077057 2018-02-13 23:14:11 UTC <RichardHW27> Breaking news: @WWE has added me to the #EliminationChamber match. It will be an 8 man match n da chamber. #WWE realize their mistake to make it even.
963164198523097089 2018-02-12 21:33:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN is totally in luv with a brutal murderous dictator sister.
962761813099237376 2018-02-11 18:54:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN has gone full liberal crazy. They have fallen in love with a murderous dictator sister.
960634930500947969 2018-02-05 22:03:09 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE going to end @WWEAsuka streak after #Wrestlemania? Could @RondaRousey end it? Seems like it. But I hope not.
959442821676716032 2018-02-02 15:06:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Politics poisoned ones soul when someone can make a joke about a death like @StephenKing did. Wake up America.
958386332841205761 2018-01-30 17:08:02 UTC <RichardHW27> What no @RondaRousey for Monday Night Raw. Maybe tonight on #SmackdownLive?
957854839920316416 2018-01-28 05:56:04 UTC <RichardHW27> Loved seeing @RondaRousey tonight @ the #RoyalRumble.
953859939545608192 2018-01-17 05:21:46 UTC <RichardHW27> @fox5dc @BrittMcHenry They will pick up a new viewer for the rest of the werk.
947954073222950913 2018-01-01 22:13:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL My #RusevResolution is more #Rusev!
946154430319218689 2017-12-27 23:02:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry Same media hacks who said we won't have a 3% GDP. No new jobs. Stock Market will crash soon after he is elected. They r running out of toys to throw from their fits.
941888216747204608 2017-12-15 04:30:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry That's great to hear. Very inspirational.
931244794222915586 2017-11-16 19:37:15 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @nflcommish I would like 50 million dollars and a private jet 4 life.
930546706835525637 2017-11-14 21:23:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Good luck to @MsCharlotteWWE tonight. Hoping she shows how dominant the true #Queen really is.
930541333630119936 2017-11-14 21:01:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Props 2 the couple who got the biggest pop on #WWE. @WWE u need to hire them.
928027388067368960 2017-11-07 22:32:25 UTC <RichardHW27> What r u thinking @WWE. U ruined the main event by announcing the winner.
927714468305436673 2017-11-06 01:49:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Can u believe @jefflongUA telling people to b astate fans if we didn't like @ArkRazorbacks losing? He is a joke.
927556278813159424 2017-11-06 15:20:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks had 60 or more plays and @Just_Theron were on only 12 of those plays? Wait..what? 4-5 coach. There is a reason
926933662008045568 2017-11-04 22:06:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Thanks @jefflongUA for hurting Arkansas football.
925534035161636864 2017-10-31 01:24:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @BrockLesnar @WWEUniverse Let me give the answer in my language to my people...No
925371528799309824 2017-10-31 14:38:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thanks for burying the club. @KarlAndersonWWE and @LukeGallowsWWE why?
925205778893598721 2017-10-30 03:40:21 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thank God for dvr.
924777670143037440 2017-10-29 23:19:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Sucks to hear @EmmaWWE was released. But don't fret fans #Emmalina will debut tomorrow night
924749585020542978 2017-10-29 21:27:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys u ain't winning crap until u fix that weak was defense
922837668240809985 2017-10-24 14:50:20 UTC <RichardHW27> Just watched @WWE and wished I skipped the @FinnBalor match. Great job on the creative writing there. SMH
921918641481965570 2017-10-21 01:58:27 UTC <RichardHW27> Attention @jefflongUA #MRGA. That's good not great.
921917641425604608 2017-10-21 01:54:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how much is integrity worth? 27-31 is my guess
921916530081886208 2017-10-21 01:50:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA is working on a new conyract extension..shouldmt he work on the resignation of @BretBielema..pathetic
921914115127377920 2017-10-21 01:40:28 UTC <RichardHW27> As usual @ArkRazorbacks halftime adjustments is giving up more points at a faster pace.
921913274375000064 2017-10-21 01:37:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks defense could field 22 men and still not stop anyone. SMH
921912718092853250 2017-10-21 01:34:54 UTC <RichardHW27> From all the SEC schools..Please Arkansas keep @BretBielema.
921906090337624065 2017-10-21 01:08:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks OL is good something. Holding and false starts. #WPS #WooPig
921904420740362242 2017-10-21 01:01:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks. Their football team is terrible.
921018087398354945 2017-10-19 14:19:58 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm not surprised @BretBielema blames everyone and anything for 5 years of mediocrity other than himself.
920999685560643584 2017-10-19 13:06:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE creative writing is lazy boring and repetitive. Reason why ratings r way down.
920467991090946050 2017-10-17 01:54:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RaymondScott94 @BraunStrowman Braun said he isn't finished with u yet
920289335617998849 2017-10-17 14:04:10 UTC <RichardHW27> @FinnBalor @WWEBrayWyatt @WWEUniverse Has @WWE Wlost their mind with this messed up story.
920267754342617088 2017-10-17 12:38:25 UTC <RichardHW27> Man @WWE last night #Raw had a lot of empty seats. I guess #theguy couldn't draw more than 10.000 seats. @CodyRhodes was right
919964346846990336 2017-10-16 16:32:47 UTC <RichardHW27> Who started this? #wps #BretBielemaFiringClock #Arkansas #razorbackspic.twitter.com/f9sajWBtDa
919954508108713984 2017-10-16 15:53:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @CodyRhodes is right. He does sell and draw more than any #wwe superstars. WWE was already built not so much 4 RHO or NJPW.
919760524224679938 2017-10-15 03:02:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @redturn2 u sexy beast! 3 run bomb!
918921280275001344 2017-10-13 19:28:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Also the @NCAA suspends college FB player for making money off their YouTube channel.  They r a joke. Reason why the FIB cleans up mess
918920817706233856 2017-10-13 19:26:10 UTC <RichardHW27> But @NCAA wontg suspend UNC 4 putting athletes in classes that never met?
918920214238191616 2017-10-13 19:23:46 UTC <RichardHW27> The @NCAA is a joke and an embarrassment. Suspends a player 4 5 games over $3.07
918479267977154560 2017-10-12 14:11:36 UTC <RichardHW27> The @MattJackson13 and @NickJacksonYB is creating probs 4 #WWE.  More entertaining than the crap WWE puts out every week.
918449644925005825 2017-10-12 12:13:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @MATTHARDYBRAND Please don't. Stay in the Indies. WWE will bury u . I don't even know this Matt Hardy now. Broken. Woken. Extreme. Boring
918117108705263616 2017-10-11 14:12:31 UTC <RichardHW27> I hope ther rumors isn't true that @WWENeville quit @wwe. #wwe #TheKingOfTheCruiserweights
917960865424596993 2017-10-10 03:51:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @SamiZayn U mean when life gives u lemons give rosebuds
917757145587822603 2017-10-10 14:22:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE the #SHIELD  is back? Lol  What's next? @AJStylesOrg is being fed to Jinder Mahal?
917503511902019585 2017-10-09 21:34:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @BretBielema throw some of his players under the bus? They haven't developed yet? Do ur job coach. Ur evaluation of players is subpar
917497350565883904 2017-10-09 21:09:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA and Arkansas negotiating a new contract Dear God say it ain't so. Jeff pisses on the football program once again. #WPS #uncommon
917466214905122816 2017-10-09 19:06:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin I can't see my dick
917441699730874368 2017-10-09 17:28:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN was so damn good in @WWENXT. But soon he gets called up @VinceMcMahon buries him against trash Jinder Mahal.
917391335304331264 2017-10-09 14:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Losers do get rewarded with title opportunities. They gave one to Mahal.
917220733822095360 2017-10-08 02:50:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @SamiZayn @RusevBUL @ShinsukeN u r being buried whole trash like Jinder is champ. Let that sink in. Poor @WWEAsuka it won't b long r u 2
917218842967003137 2017-10-08 02:43:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin AJ will be fed to that piece of garbage.
917217875584274435 2017-10-08 02:39:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH builds them and @VinceMcMahon buries them. Please Hunter make #WWE as good as @WWENXT
917215644663283712 2017-10-08 02:30:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWERoadDogg @WWE @ShinsukeN @RealJoeCronin Rusev vs Nakamura in a total buried match. The loser will have to put over the two Jinders oompa loompa
917214551413846016 2017-10-08 02:26:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Rusev joins Shinsuke in I keep getting buried
917214113474011137 2017-10-08 02:24:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE who's next r u going to bury? @AJStylesOrg is next? I hope u those subscriptions in India will replace ur loss here.
917213539894480896 2017-10-08 02:22:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE way to ruin Shinsuke Nakamura.
917213309862121472 2017-10-08 02:21:08 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is garbage.
917169890276073472 2017-10-08 23:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Dear God @dallascowboys get a damn defense. Freaking pathetic.
917128499781042176 2017-10-08 20:44:08 UTC <RichardHW27> The @dallascowboys defense is just as bad as @ArkRazorbacks defense. Both r pathetic.
916805992117166080 2017-10-07 23:22:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks football team is a dumpster fire. @jefflongUA can't buy out @BretBielema but can Arkansas buy at Jeff Long? #Uncommon #WPS
916802556772474880 2017-10-07 23:08:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @MikeAndersonUA please make us forget about this football team.
916799844529917952 2017-10-07 22:58:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @jefflongUA Arkansas loses again. Can we at least get a #WooooPig out of U? Pathetic
916796333524160512 2017-10-07 22:44:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks football team. They aren't coached worth crap. Their football team is very poorly coached. #Uncommon
916795220402036737 2017-10-07 22:39:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @ZaringGroup @grandfavallarta @EmmaWWE Can I watch?
916794894903136256 2017-10-07 22:38:30 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas is #Uncommon when getting their ass kicked.
916006261157744640 2017-10-05 18:24:45 UTC <RichardHW27> Appreciation tweet 4 @TripleH 4 the great work for @WWENXT
915917838795378688 2017-10-05 12:33:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @StephMcMahon @ITVLorraine Don't they bury enough women wrestlers?
915602773479215105 2017-10-04 15:41:26 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh God please @WWE don't let @WWEBrayWyatt play #SisterAbigail. Do not bury Bray more than u have
915261735342346241 2017-10-03 17:06:17 UTC <RichardHW27> WTH is up with @WWE Raw last night? Where is @TripleH when they need him. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
914574865339965452 2017-10-01 19:36:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys defense is horrible. If Dallas is going to challenge Philly they need to correct it fast.
913012725856505857 2017-09-27 12:09:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish shouldn't u listen to the people who pay those over paid spoiled athletes?  And u who is way over paid. #Stand
912840458614841344 2017-09-26 00:44:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @DIRECTV way to go if true.
912673242380464128 2017-09-26 13:40:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @NFL and nfl owners u have a problem. Get the damn politics out of our game.
912421964903538694 2017-09-25 21:02:03 UTC <RichardHW27> If these rich athletes from the @NFL seek to protest the Anthem how bout them no play the game and show us how much their beliefs are
912363430425907201 2017-09-25 17:09:27 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys let's hope 100% player participation in the respect for Our National Athem
912348300338253825 2017-09-25 16:09:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish fines players fo r dancing in the end zone. Fines players support for family suffering from cancer
912348104808108034 2017-09-25 16:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish wouldn't let the Cowboys wear support for Dallas PD last year protecting protesters

907703534233276416 2017-09-12 20:32:41 UTC <RichardHW27> When is @jefflongUA going to get it? Wins doesn't matter? It matters to the ones who have season tickets. He'll get it real soon. #WPS
907279718633918464 2017-09-11 16:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Has #SmackDownLIVE been boring since Jinder been champion? I have lost interest.
906647288533188608 2017-09-09 22:35:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @BretBielema need to go. He is hurting my school.
906582201260761088 2017-09-09 18:16:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @Jay_3085 Very true. But I was mainly talking about It the clown Tim Curry.  I guess I'm old school compared to today's special effects stuff
906001107079528448 2017-09-07 03:47:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @officialchilli Seen it as well. I liked the older one better. Tim Curry as It was spooky. May need to see it again.

899497437823455232 2017-08-20 05:04:35 UTC <RichardHW27> It's time for @TripleH to take over #WWE. I'm still pissed from watching #SummerSlam.
899474861323583488 2017-08-20 03:34:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @KennyOmegamanX and @MattJackson13 Please stay out of the #WWE. Do not get #Bayley'ed buried on that crap show.
899473352125014016 2017-08-20 03:28:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEEmberMoon don't let them call u up? Stay at NXT. Do not let them Bayley'ed u. Please stay at #NXT

899464219351015425 2017-08-20 02:52:35 UTC <RichardHW27> What sucks more than @WWERomanReigns? #SummerSlan sucks worse
899460019854487552 2017-08-20 02:35:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH needs to run all 3 brands. What he has done with #NXT is just crazy good. #Raw and #Smackdown needs Triple H. #SummerDump
899459038714314753 2017-08-20 02:32:00 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam? No it's #SummerDump
899458375083274240 2017-08-20 02:29:22 UTC <RichardHW27> I have no idea why they even have this stupid match. To build 3 man band Jinder? @WWE I'm just dumbfounded. Lazy ass booking #wwe
899457923876892672 2017-08-20 02:27:34 UTC <RichardHW27> Lazy ass booking by @WWE. What junk of a show. #SummerSlam is garbage
899457611959070720 2017-08-20 02:26:20 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam is garbage. What a piece of junk. @WWE I'm canceling after this garbage. I know u won't care. Total BS
899423544161054720 2017-08-20 00:10:58 UTC <RichardHW27> Aliens have captured #SmackDownLIVE creative.
899411433598988289 2017-08-20 23:22:50 UTC <RichardHW27> @BlissfulQween RIP Baron Corbin. You just been Bayley'ed
899410650555969536 2017-08-20 23:19:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Rip @BaronCorbinWWE
899289192521502720 2017-08-20 15:17:06 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish ratings will continue to drop if u can't fix getting politics out of football. U have to understand that.
899104029229428736 2017-08-19 03:01:19 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWENXT is the shits. What a show. Good job everyone.
899073438056427520 2017-08-19 00:59:46 UTC <RichardHW27> #NXTTakeOverBrooklynIII is on fire tonight. #SAnity new tag team champions.
898206194740932608 2017-08-17 15:33:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEFandango u may b right. @WWE creative team may have been abducted by aliens.
898182646848790529 2017-08-17 14:00:05 UTC <RichardHW27> OMG I just watched #SmackDownLIVE and #wtf. What did @BaronCorbinWWE do to deserve that crap? Another @JohnCena burial. RIP Baron Corbin
897796150220247040 2017-08-16 12:24:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn giving more dumb clickbait with their politics.
897596335834136576 2017-08-15 23:10:17 UTC <RichardHW27> Be prepared @NFL to take more of a hit of ratings this year.
895858081208422401 2017-08-10 04:03:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShawnMichaels and @TripleH Chyna was DX before DX was cool just like u
895721834896908289 2017-08-10 19:01:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Who deserves to be in the @WWE HOF more? Owen Hart? Chyna? Miss Elizabeth?
895715575212756995 2017-08-10 18:36:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Shouldnt the @WWE women wrestlers should follow @ReneeYoungWWE lead and cross promote? It would be better than seeing the same matches.
895707541136691201 2017-08-10 18:04:53 UTC <RichardHW27> I use to say #MakeWWEGreatAgain but until @WWE lose tv money they won't care about ratings bookings and PPV's. SMH
895075080639664128 2017-08-08 00:11:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @WWE stop doing the Slammy Awards? I forgot.
894756902843830272 2017-08-07 03:07:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Toronto how could u boo @itsBayleyWWE? Shame on u
894736108587700225 2017-08-07 01:44:46 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh look a member of #SmackdownLive @ReneeYoungWWE on #Raw. Makes sense
894646644527906819 2017-08-07 19:49:16 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE just put another nail in the coffin for kayfabe. #DieKayfabe
894433415403102209 2017-08-06 05:41:58 UTC <RichardHW27> https://youtu.be/cYg-z7KrKjY  Remember 23 years ago when @IAmJericho was known as #thrillseekers?
893983966105133056 2017-08-05 23:56:01 UTC <RichardHW27> "There is two things u don't forget #elephants and #thrillseakers" @IAmJericho
893467529653493761 2017-08-04 13:43:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN will win WWE title at #summerslam2017 but @BaronCorbinWWE will cash in his #MoneyInTheBank briefcase. Don't let this happen #WWE
893196437399515136 2017-08-03 19:46:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn going all political again. Let the #madness  stop
893166124753444866 2017-08-03 17:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWE was serious about the psychology and believability they should bring in @JakeSnakeDDT. Get rid of #DaysOfOurLives writers.
892215784327589889 2017-07-31 02:49:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @BigCassWWE needs to lay off on the spray tan.
892206083065958400 2017-07-31 02:11:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Is it time for @real1 to go to @WWE205Live? I hope @wwe has plans for him
892198734901194753 2017-07-31 01:42:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt went from #NewFaceOfFear to EateryOfWorlds? What have @WWE done to him?
891431805668163584 2017-07-29 22:54:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @AJStylesOrg The poster is only to promote the 3rd biggest PPV of the year. It sucks that AJ isn't on it. But after the PPV the part timers will be gone
890977749032198144 2017-07-28 16:50:23 UTC <RichardHW27> Do you feel like the Women's Revolution is becoming stale? Or better better yet hurt in some way with the brand split? #NiaLive
890439331361554432 2017-07-26 05:10:54 UTC <RichardHW27> Will the #RoyalRumble2018 in Philly be as loud as they were when @WWERomanReigns won in 2015?
890303345012899840 2017-07-26 20:10:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @ReneeYoungWWE @WWE That is why is brand split is just pointless
890297502578167808 2017-07-26 19:47:20 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWENeville is on @WWE205Live why isn't @KalistoWWE on 205Live? Give @KalistoWWE a chance. #WWE
890264469208780802 2017-07-26 17:36:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE took away pro because they say it isn't relevant. Next they will take entrance music out becuz it hurts the ears. #WWE #BringBackPyro
890196861398732800 2017-07-26 13:07:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @IAmJericho @WWE @SashaBanksWWE Everybody goes back to Raw. That's why the brand split is pointless
890063678883729408 2017-07-25 04:18:12 UTC <RichardHW27> When @WWE put on a crappy #BATTLEGROUND PPV they totally redeem themselves with #SmackDownLive
889608358474502144 2017-07-24 22:08:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Wait @NiaJaxWWE and @AlexaBliss_WWE is going to be on the new season of Total Divas? No more of Women's Revolution. #WWE
889598347551682560 2017-07-24 21:29:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Please @WWE let #MondayNightRAW be better than the crap we watched last night. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
889597621530185728 2017-07-24 21:26:15 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RusevBUL You deserve better
889592611106947072 2017-07-24 21:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm still sick to my stomach from watching #Battleground2017. The return of @WWE from 2008-2011.
889480306645979137 2017-07-24 13:40:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @Wee Please @WEE end the fued between @RandyOrton and @JinderMahal. Randy Orton deserves much better.
889478268860211200 2017-07-24 13:31:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Is this when I cancel @WWENetwork until a few days before #WrestleMania?
889478033148710913 2017-07-24 13:31:03 UTC <RichardHW27> For me it was the booking and the way the  matches ended. Nothing last night got me pumped for #summerslam2017
889477495703183361 2017-07-24 13:28:55 UTC <RichardHW27> I don't know what to think about @WWE.  Last night #Battleground2017 was forgetful.
889349052646797312 2017-07-23 04:58:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @JohnCena @WWE Rusev was better off staying off TV. He was more relevant then.
887510745168179201 2017-07-18 03:13:45 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN Thank you King of Strong Style!

887133296907386880 2017-07-17 02:13:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE has lost their minds. Did they hire the same writer who wrote the Katie Vick storyline? #WWE #MondayNightRAW
885269948679028737 2017-07-12 22:49:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJeffJarrett is done running his ponzi scheme (GFW) it seems he is full force keeping @MATTHARDYBRAND from his creation. #fuckthatowl
884448480168734720 2017-07-10 16:25:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Does @WWE have the guts for a double turn tonight?
883906442998231041 2017-07-08 04:31:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheRealXPac It's not that WWE sucks it's just that ROH and NJPW are killing it. WWE live events are great but their tv shows are too watered down.

880421802681528320 2017-06-29 13:44:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Keep @WWEAsuka and @NikkiCrossWWE in @WWENXT.  Do not ruin them on the main roster.
878307077390716928 2017-06-23 17:41:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE  has ruined the women's revolution. Time for the title to go back to Diva title. Sucks for the true women wrestlers. #WWE
877627970919297024 2017-06-21 20:43:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE ruining the women's division on raw? And #SmackDownLIVE where is half the talent?
876865848211906560 2017-06-19 18:14:44 UTC <RichardHW27> Now @NFL is going political. Ratings will drop even more
866486959635660801 2017-05-21 02:52:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @wwe gain viewers in India loses viewers in America. #WTF #WWE

864335924959879168 2017-05-15 04:25:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @therealec3 Go to WWE
864223169586049024 2017-05-15 20:57:14 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is the news for...politics.
859554100010266629 2017-05-02 23:44:01 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @WWEBrayWyatt @RandyOrton @WWE Yes the mean street posse is back!
859454842682703872 2017-05-02 17:09:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is still going political. And ratings going down and people losing jobs.
857331129812168705 2017-04-26 20:30:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @DilfersDime deserves better. One of the best. Hope to see him on TV soon
857305290257158144 2017-04-26 18:48:03 UTC <RichardHW27> Feel bad 4 the guys who lost their job @espn. So does that mean no more politics BS and just sports? I hope.
857061494890037248 2017-04-25 02:39:18 UTC <RichardHW27> No @BeckyLynchWWE on #SDLive? What a shame.
857025131541127168 2017-04-25 00:14:48 UTC <RichardHW27> I forgot that @WWE has a PPV this Sunday. How did that happen?
856952904917319682 2017-04-25 19:27:48 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the heck is the @WWE doing with @FinnBalor? Dang @BraunStrowman? No hope against @WWERomanReigns. The writers such for @WWE.
856481039669133312 2017-04-24 12:12:47 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt @WWE Another loss
856199994621251584 2017-04-23 17:36:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @VinceMcMahon call @JohnCena the Babe Ruth of the #WWE? That is too funny. Too many before him. Maybe the Pete Rose of the WWE.
855893853542461446 2017-04-22 21:19:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @KalistoWWE @WWE @RealKurtAngle Braun vs Kalisto? Look out Rey Kalisto another human dart
854809278175170560 2017-04-19 21:29:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @RandyOrton @JinderMahal @WWEUniverse Jinder getting a title shot? I'm sure Kurt Hawkins is pissed. Now if we James Ellsworth to juice up he may get a title shot.
854805152590692354 2017-04-19 21:13:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn @FoxNews has competition for political rhetoric. @ESPN is catching up.
854548515917377536 2017-04-18 04:13:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE really? Jinder Mahal? Catch on #MondayNightRAW @TheCurtHawkins will win #1 contender for Universal Title.
851979172545167361 2017-04-11 02:03:58 UTC <RichardHW27> @ilikesamizayn What a great main event on #SmackDownLIVE. @AJStylesOrg @iLikeSamiZayn and @BaronCorbinWWE put on a show. A+.  #WWE

851964669833220096 2017-04-11 01:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> So #SmackDownLIVE women's division is pretty much all heels.
851910286810468353 2017-04-11 21:30:14 UTC <RichardHW27> Will we see @SashaBanksWWE on #Smackdown tonight? #WWE
851909052296822785 2017-04-11 21:25:20 UTC <RichardHW27> My #WMmoment would be the @MATTHARDYBRAND and @JEFFHARDYBRAND return. Also seeing the Undertaker last match.

851506696367341568 2017-04-10 18:46:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @MATTHARDYBRAND needs to be traded tonight and when Smackdown tag titles. Why not it will be the titles relevant again. #WWE

847483239606370307 2017-03-30 16:18:44 UTC <RichardHW27> I have a feeling that @FinnBalor will make a heel turn at #Wrestlemania33. #WWW #Wrestlemania
846916377025937410 2017-03-28 02:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Where was @DeanAmbroseNet? He wasn't on #Smackdown tonight. Very weird.
846901516753485824 2017-03-28 01:47:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Smackdown is so much better than Raw. The storytelling is much better. #Smackdown #Raw
846886715398742016 2017-03-28 00:48:22 UTC <RichardHW27> @NatbyNature @NaomiWWE @WWE Naomi bringing the glow

846574980963975168 2017-03-27 04:09:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEUniverse @WWE There will be 29 holes for 29 souls. No..Smackdown is my home..No. Roman u will rest in peace
846561395177115649 2017-03-27 03:15:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE If this was just a normal Raw it would be good. But not the last raw before Wrestlemania. 4/10
846536189557587968 2017-03-27 01:35:30 UTC <RichardHW27> What the heck did I just watch with the New Day? Dumb. #Raw #WWE

842428747005464576 2017-03-16 17:33:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Who's ready for Wrestlemania? More like #Boremania. Where is @FinnBalor? Where is @ShinsukeN? Frick Roman Reigns. #WWE #Raw
841829764285505537 2017-03-14 01:53:50 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw and #Smackdown did not build or excite me for Wrestlemania.
841822807923265538 2017-03-14 01:26:12 UTC <RichardHW27> AJ vs Shane? Who would a thunk it. Come on #Smackdown you are better than this.
841809593114206209 2017-03-14 00:33:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Is AJ Styles waiting on Kurt Angle? #WWE #Smackdown
841677078256865280 2017-03-14 15:47:07 UTC <RichardHW27> Way to go @WWE to build up Wrestlemania. I have no interest on the Raw brand. Hopefully #SmackDownLIVE is much better. #WWE #Raw #Smackdown
841483867961851905 2017-03-13 02:59:22 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE No Finn Baylor? 3 weeks until Wrestle mania? WTH. #WWE #Wrestlemania

838778167955447808 2017-03-06 15:47:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is it too late to get my 3 hours back watching that crap last night.  I know bring back Flair to go over @FinnBalor? Good grief.
836340868823003136 2017-02-27 22:22:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Really @WWE Beth Phoenix? What about Woman? Miss Elizabeth?
836198862754885632 2017-02-27 12:58:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @oscars Thank you @Oscars for showing your ignorance and your political BS. One of the reasons why liberals lost the Whitehouse. Unite not divide.
831543511673626624 2017-02-14 16:39:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Thank you @Thegrammysrp_  for allowing us to see more of the ones who keep promoting more division between us. # unite #America
831355424809050112 2017-02-13 04:12:33 UTC <RichardHW27> For 8 years they taught peace tolerance and unity. Now many of those are the most intolerant and hateful people. Let's unite not divide.
830073016247783424 2017-02-10 15:16:43 UTC <RichardHW27> The tolerant=intolerant. The peaceful minds are the ones usually use violence.  America stand together not divided. #America #Together
829371329379971072 2017-02-08 16:48:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how many were at the game last night?  Thank goodness for free pizza!
829167448662368256 2017-02-07 03:18:19 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas lost to Vanderbilt? How does that happen?  @jefflongUA I hope you watched the game. Many wished they didn't.

825827290126962693 2017-01-29 22:05:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win tonight @AJStylesOrg or @JohnCena?
825760470397308928 2017-01-29 17:40:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win the Royal Rumble? Please @WWE let it be someone not expecting to win it. Surprise angle is much more fun.

694866804179652608 2016-02-03 12:55:30 UTC <RichardHW27> 2 bad @Tyrie_1 didn't pick Arkansas. You would be a superstar @Florida but u would be legendary at Arkansas. #WPS
970452058502520832 2018-03-04 00:12:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Over paid actors and actresses telling everyone about gun control has either been paid millions in a violent movie and have armed security. #Oscars #hypocrites
969206609435156481 2018-03-01 13:43:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheCoachrules Stop being sheep? U would think that the WWE would want us to be sheep for liking the God awful storylines they put out. Here is a first put something out thats entertaining. No saturated over and over and over.
968894032205185031 2018-02-28 17:01:53 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the back is going on with #SmackdownLive? The show is turning into garbage.
968589354745593856 2018-02-27 20:51:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @WWE isn't @WWEAsuka suppose to choose her champion to wrestle? #WhatTheHeckHappen
967846573576212481 2018-02-25 19:39:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RondaRousey @AndrewKarluk If she doesn't she'll fit right on in with half the wwe superstars.
965764771596337152 2018-02-19 01:47:19 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw boring
963551909868077057 2018-02-13 23:14:11 UTC <RichardHW27> Breaking news: @WWE has added me to the #EliminationChamber match. It will be an 8 man match n da chamber. #WWE realize their mistake to make it even.
963164198523097089 2018-02-12 21:33:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN is totally in luv with a brutal murderous dictator sister.
962761813099237376 2018-02-11 18:54:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @CNN has gone full liberal crazy. They have fallen in love with a murderous dictator sister.
960634930500947969 2018-02-05 22:03:09 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE going to end @WWEAsuka streak after #Wrestlemania? Could @RondaRousey end it? Seems like it. But I hope not.
959442821676716032 2018-02-02 15:06:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Politics poisoned ones soul when someone can make a joke about a death like @StephenKing did. Wake up America.
958386332841205761 2018-01-30 17:08:02 UTC <RichardHW27> What no @RondaRousey for Monday Night Raw. Maybe tonight on #SmackdownLive?
957854839920316416 2018-01-28 05:56:04 UTC <RichardHW27> Loved seeing @RondaRousey tonight @ the #RoyalRumble.
953859939545608192 2018-01-17 05:21:46 UTC <RichardHW27> @fox5dc @BrittMcHenry They will pick up a new viewer for the rest of the werk.
947954073222950913 2018-01-01 22:13:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL My #RusevResolution is more #Rusev!
946154430319218689 2017-12-27 23:02:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry Same media hacks who said we won't have a 3% GDP. No new jobs. Stock Market will crash soon after he is elected. They r running out of toys to throw from their fits.
941888216747204608 2017-12-15 04:30:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @BrittMcHenry That's great to hear. Very inspirational.
931244794222915586 2017-11-16 19:37:15 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @nflcommish I would like 50 million dollars and a private jet 4 life.
930546706835525637 2017-11-14 21:23:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Good luck to @MsCharlotteWWE tonight. Hoping she shows how dominant the true #Queen really is.
930541333630119936 2017-11-14 21:01:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Props 2 the couple who got the biggest pop on #WWE. @WWE u need to hire them.
928027388067368960 2017-11-07 22:32:25 UTC <RichardHW27> What r u thinking @WWE. U ruined the main event by announcing the winner.
927714468305436673 2017-11-06 01:49:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Can u believe @jefflongUA telling people to b astate fans if we didn't like @ArkRazorbacks losing? He is a joke.
927556278813159424 2017-11-06 15:20:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks had 60 or more plays and @Just_Theron were on only 12 of those plays? Wait..what? 4-5 coach. There is a reason
926933662008045568 2017-11-04 22:06:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Thanks @jefflongUA for hurting Arkansas football.
925534035161636864 2017-10-31 01:24:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @BrockLesnar @WWEUniverse Let me give the answer in my language to my people...No
925371528799309824 2017-10-31 14:38:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thanks for burying the club. @KarlAndersonWWE and @LukeGallowsWWE why?
925205778893598721 2017-10-30 03:40:21 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE thank God for dvr.
924777670143037440 2017-10-29 23:19:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Sucks to hear @EmmaWWE was released. But don't fret fans #Emmalina will debut tomorrow night
924749585020542978 2017-10-29 21:27:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys u ain't winning crap until u fix that weak was defense
922837668240809985 2017-10-24 14:50:20 UTC <RichardHW27> Just watched @WWE and wished I skipped the @FinnBalor match. Great job on the creative writing there. SMH
921918641481965570 2017-10-21 01:58:27 UTC <RichardHW27> Attention @jefflongUA #MRGA. That's good not great.
921917641425604608 2017-10-21 01:54:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how much is integrity worth? 27-31 is my guess
921916530081886208 2017-10-21 01:50:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA is working on a new conyract extension..shouldmt he work on the resignation of @BretBielema..pathetic
921914115127377920 2017-10-21 01:40:28 UTC <RichardHW27> As usual @ArkRazorbacks halftime adjustments is giving up more points at a faster pace.
921913274375000064 2017-10-21 01:37:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks defense could field 22 men and still not stop anyone. SMH
921912718092853250 2017-10-21 01:34:54 UTC <RichardHW27> From all the SEC schools..Please Arkansas keep @BretBielema.
921906090337624065 2017-10-21 01:08:34 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks OL is good something. Holding and false starts. #WPS #WooPig
921904420740362242 2017-10-21 01:01:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks. Their football team is terrible.
921018087398354945 2017-10-19 14:19:58 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm not surprised @BretBielema blames everyone and anything for 5 years of mediocrity other than himself.
920999685560643584 2017-10-19 13:06:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE creative writing is lazy boring and repetitive. Reason why ratings r way down.
920467991090946050 2017-10-17 01:54:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RaymondScott94 @BraunStrowman Braun said he isn't finished with u yet
920289335617998849 2017-10-17 14:04:10 UTC <RichardHW27> @FinnBalor @WWEBrayWyatt @WWEUniverse Has @WWE Wlost their mind with this messed up story.
920267754342617088 2017-10-17 12:38:25 UTC <RichardHW27> Man @WWE last night #Raw had a lot of empty seats. I guess #theguy couldn't draw more than 10.000 seats. @CodyRhodes was right
919964346846990336 2017-10-16 16:32:47 UTC <RichardHW27> Who started this? #wps #BretBielemaFiringClock #Arkansas #razorbackspic.twitter.com/f9sajWBtDa
919954508108713984 2017-10-16 15:53:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @CodyRhodes is right. He does sell and draw more than any #wwe superstars. WWE was already built not so much 4 RHO or NJPW.
919760524224679938 2017-10-15 03:02:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @redturn2 u sexy beast! 3 run bomb!
918921280275001344 2017-10-13 19:28:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Also the @NCAA suspends college FB player for making money off their YouTube channel.  They r a joke. Reason why the FIB cleans up mess
918920817706233856 2017-10-13 19:26:10 UTC <RichardHW27> But @NCAA wontg suspend UNC 4 putting athletes in classes that never met?
918920214238191616 2017-10-13 19:23:46 UTC <RichardHW27> The @NCAA is a joke and an embarrassment. Suspends a player 4 5 games over $3.07
918479267977154560 2017-10-12 14:11:36 UTC <RichardHW27> The @MattJackson13 and @NickJacksonYB is creating probs 4 #WWE.  More entertaining than the crap WWE puts out every week.
918449644925005825 2017-10-12 12:13:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @MATTHARDYBRAND Please don't. Stay in the Indies. WWE will bury u . I don't even know this Matt Hardy now. Broken. Woken. Extreme. Boring
918117108705263616 2017-10-11 14:12:31 UTC <RichardHW27> I hope ther rumors isn't true that @WWENeville quit @wwe. #wwe #TheKingOfTheCruiserweights
917960865424596993 2017-10-10 03:51:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @SamiZayn U mean when life gives u lemons give rosebuds
917757145587822603 2017-10-10 14:22:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE the #SHIELD  is back? Lol  What's next? @AJStylesOrg is being fed to Jinder Mahal?
917503511902019585 2017-10-09 21:34:18 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @BretBielema throw some of his players under the bus? They haven't developed yet? Do ur job coach. Ur evaluation of players is subpar
917497350565883904 2017-10-09 21:09:49 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA and Arkansas negotiating a new contract Dear God say it ain't so. Jeff pisses on the football program once again. #WPS #uncommon
917466214905122816 2017-10-09 19:06:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin I can't see my dick
917441699730874368 2017-10-09 17:28:41 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN was so damn good in @WWENXT. But soon he gets called up @VinceMcMahon buries him against trash Jinder Mahal.
917391335304331264 2017-10-09 14:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Losers do get rewarded with title opportunities. They gave one to Mahal.
917220733822095360 2017-10-08 02:50:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @SamiZayn @RusevBUL @ShinsukeN u r being buried whole trash like Jinder is champ. Let that sink in. Poor @WWEAsuka it won't b long r u 2
917218842967003137 2017-10-08 02:43:07 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJoeCronin AJ will be fed to that piece of garbage.
917217875584274435 2017-10-08 02:39:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH builds them and @VinceMcMahon buries them. Please Hunter make #WWE as good as @WWENXT
917215644663283712 2017-10-08 02:30:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWERoadDogg @WWE @ShinsukeN @RealJoeCronin Rusev vs Nakamura in a total buried match. The loser will have to put over the two Jinders oompa loompa
917214551413846016 2017-10-08 02:26:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @RusevBUL Rusev joins Shinsuke in I keep getting buried
917214113474011137 2017-10-08 02:24:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE who's next r u going to bury? @AJStylesOrg is next? I hope u those subscriptions in India will replace ur loss here.
917213539894480896 2017-10-08 02:22:03 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE way to ruin Shinsuke Nakamura.
917213309862121472 2017-10-08 02:21:08 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is garbage.
917169890276073472 2017-10-08 23:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Dear God @dallascowboys get a damn defense. Freaking pathetic.
917128499781042176 2017-10-08 20:44:08 UTC <RichardHW27> The @dallascowboys defense is just as bad as @ArkRazorbacks defense. Both r pathetic.
916805992117166080 2017-10-07 23:22:36 UTC <RichardHW27> @ArkRazorbacks football team is a dumpster fire. @jefflongUA can't buy out @BretBielema but can Arkansas buy at Jeff Long? #Uncommon #WPS
916802556772474880 2017-10-07 23:08:57 UTC <RichardHW27> @MikeAndersonUA please make us forget about this football team.
916799844529917952 2017-10-07 22:58:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Hey @jefflongUA Arkansas loses again. Can we at least get a #WooooPig out of U? Pathetic
916796333524160512 2017-10-07 22:44:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Poor @ArkRazorbacks football team. They aren't coached worth crap. Their football team is very poorly coached. #Uncommon
916795220402036737 2017-10-07 22:39:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @ZaringGroup @grandfavallarta @EmmaWWE Can I watch?
916794894903136256 2017-10-07 22:38:30 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas is #Uncommon when getting their ass kicked.
916006261157744640 2017-10-05 18:24:45 UTC <RichardHW27> Appreciation tweet 4 @TripleH 4 the great work for @WWENXT
915917838795378688 2017-10-05 12:33:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @StephMcMahon @ITVLorraine Don't they bury enough women wrestlers?
915602773479215105 2017-10-04 15:41:26 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh God please @WWE don't let @WWEBrayWyatt play #SisterAbigail. Do not bury Bray more than u have
915261735342346241 2017-10-03 17:06:17 UTC <RichardHW27> WTH is up with @WWE Raw last night? Where is @TripleH when they need him. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
914574865339965452 2017-10-01 19:36:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys defense is horrible. If Dallas is going to challenge Philly they need to correct it fast.
913012725856505857 2017-09-27 12:09:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish shouldn't u listen to the people who pay those over paid spoiled athletes?  And u who is way over paid. #Stand
912840458614841344 2017-09-26 00:44:59 UTC <RichardHW27> @DIRECTV way to go if true.
912673242380464128 2017-09-26 13:40:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @NFL and nfl owners u have a problem. Get the damn politics out of our game.
912421964903538694 2017-09-25 21:02:03 UTC <RichardHW27> If these rich athletes from the @NFL seek to protest the Anthem how bout them no play the game and show us how much their beliefs are
912363430425907201 2017-09-25 17:09:27 UTC <RichardHW27> @dallascowboys let's hope 100% player participation in the respect for Our National Athem
912348300338253825 2017-09-25 16:09:20 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish fines players fo r dancing in the end zone. Fines players support for family suffering from cancer
912348104808108034 2017-09-25 16:08:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish wouldn't let the Cowboys wear support for Dallas PD last year protecting protesters

907703534233276416 2017-09-12 20:32:41 UTC <RichardHW27> When is @jefflongUA going to get it? Wins doesn't matter? It matters to the ones who have season tickets. He'll get it real soon. #WPS
907279718633918464 2017-09-11 16:28:36 UTC <RichardHW27> Has #SmackDownLIVE been boring since Jinder been champion? I have lost interest.
906647288533188608 2017-09-09 22:35:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @BretBielema need to go. He is hurting my school.
906582201260761088 2017-09-09 18:16:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @Jay_3085 Very true. But I was mainly talking about It the clown Tim Curry.  I guess I'm old school compared to today's special effects stuff
906001107079528448 2017-09-07 03:47:51 UTC <RichardHW27> @officialchilli Seen it as well. I liked the older one better. Tim Curry as It was spooky. May need to see it again.

899646144132907008 2017-08-21 14:55:30 UTC <RichardHW27> Is there anyway @WWE can call up @TripleH to run both #Raw and #Smackdown?
899640956017922049 2017-08-21 14:34:53 UTC <RichardHW27> Who got squashed faster @RusevBUL or the beach ball during the tag team match?
899600096408588288 2017-08-21 11:52:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @JohnCena @BaronCorbinWWE @WWE Corbin got Bayley'd
899497437823455232 2017-08-20 05:04:35 UTC <RichardHW27> It's time for @TripleH to take over #WWE. I'm still pissed from watching #SummerSlam.
899474861323583488 2017-08-20 03:34:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @KennyOmegamanX and @MattJackson13 Please stay out of the #WWE. Do not get #Bayley'ed buried on that crap show.
899473352125014016 2017-08-20 03:28:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEEmberMoon don't let them call u up? Stay at NXT. Do not let them Bayley'ed u. Please stay at #NXT

899464219351015425 2017-08-20 02:52:35 UTC <RichardHW27> What sucks more than @WWERomanReigns? #SummerSlan sucks worse
899460019854487552 2017-08-20 02:35:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @TripleH needs to run all 3 brands. What he has done with #NXT is just crazy good. #Raw and #Smackdown needs Triple H. #SummerDump
899459038714314753 2017-08-20 02:32:00 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam? No it's #SummerDump
899458375083274240 2017-08-20 02:29:22 UTC <RichardHW27> I have no idea why they even have this stupid match. To build 3 man band Jinder? @WWE I'm just dumbfounded. Lazy ass booking #wwe
899457923876892672 2017-08-20 02:27:34 UTC <RichardHW27> Lazy ass booking by @WWE. What junk of a show. #SummerSlam is garbage
899457611959070720 2017-08-20 02:26:20 UTC <RichardHW27> #SummerSlam is garbage. What a piece of junk. @WWE I'm canceling after this garbage. I know u won't care. Total BS
899423544161054720 2017-08-20 00:10:58 UTC <RichardHW27> Aliens have captured #SmackDownLIVE creative.
899411433598988289 2017-08-20 23:22:50 UTC <RichardHW27> @BlissfulQween RIP Baron Corbin. You just been Bayley'ed
899410650555969536 2017-08-20 23:19:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Rip @BaronCorbinWWE
899289192521502720 2017-08-20 15:17:06 UTC <RichardHW27> @nflcommish ratings will continue to drop if u can't fix getting politics out of football. U have to understand that.
899104029229428736 2017-08-19 03:01:19 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWENXT is the shits. What a show. Good job everyone.
899073438056427520 2017-08-19 00:59:46 UTC <RichardHW27> #NXTTakeOverBrooklynIII is on fire tonight. #SAnity new tag team champions.
898206194740932608 2017-08-17 15:33:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEFandango u may b right. @WWE creative team may have been abducted by aliens.
898182646848790529 2017-08-17 14:00:05 UTC <RichardHW27> OMG I just watched #SmackDownLIVE and #wtf. What did @BaronCorbinWWE do to deserve that crap? Another @JohnCena burial. RIP Baron Corbin
897796150220247040 2017-08-16 12:24:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn giving more dumb clickbait with their politics.
897596335834136576 2017-08-15 23:10:17 UTC <RichardHW27> Be prepared @NFL to take more of a hit of ratings this year.
895858081208422401 2017-08-10 04:03:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShawnMichaels and @TripleH Chyna was DX before DX was cool just like u
895721834896908289 2017-08-10 19:01:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Who deserves to be in the @WWE HOF more? Owen Hart? Chyna? Miss Elizabeth?
895715575212756995 2017-08-10 18:36:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Shouldnt the @WWE women wrestlers should follow @ReneeYoungWWE lead and cross promote? It would be better than seeing the same matches.
895707541136691201 2017-08-10 18:04:53 UTC <RichardHW27> I use to say #MakeWWEGreatAgain but until @WWE lose tv money they won't care about ratings bookings and PPV's. SMH
895075080639664128 2017-08-08 00:11:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @WWE stop doing the Slammy Awards? I forgot.
894756902843830272 2017-08-07 03:07:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Toronto how could u boo @itsBayleyWWE? Shame on u
894736108587700225 2017-08-07 01:44:46 UTC <RichardHW27> Oh look a member of #SmackdownLive @ReneeYoungWWE on #Raw. Makes sense
894646644527906819 2017-08-07 19:49:16 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE just put another nail in the coffin for kayfabe. #DieKayfabe
894433415403102209 2017-08-06 05:41:58 UTC <RichardHW27> https://youtu.be/cYg-z7KrKjY  Remember 23 years ago when @IAmJericho was known as #thrillseekers?
893983966105133056 2017-08-05 23:56:01 UTC <RichardHW27> "There is two things u don't forget #elephants and #thrillseakers" @IAmJericho
893467529653493761 2017-08-04 13:43:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN will win WWE title at #summerslam2017 but @BaronCorbinWWE will cash in his #MoneyInTheBank briefcase. Don't let this happen #WWE
893196437399515136 2017-08-03 19:46:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn going all political again. Let the #madness  stop
893166124753444866 2017-08-03 17:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWE was serious about the psychology and believability they should bring in @JakeSnakeDDT. Get rid of #DaysOfOurLives writers.
892215784327589889 2017-07-31 02:49:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @BigCassWWE needs to lay off on the spray tan.
892206083065958400 2017-07-31 02:11:21 UTC <RichardHW27> Is it time for @real1 to go to @WWE205Live? I hope @wwe has plans for him
892198734901194753 2017-07-31 01:42:09 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt went from #NewFaceOfFear to EateryOfWorlds? What have @WWE done to him?
891431805668163584 2017-07-29 22:54:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @AJStylesOrg The poster is only to promote the 3rd biggest PPV of the year. It sucks that AJ isn't on it. But after the PPV the part timers will be gone
890977749032198144 2017-07-28 16:50:23 UTC <RichardHW27> Do you feel like the Women's Revolution is becoming stale? Or better better yet hurt in some way with the brand split? #NiaLive
890439331361554432 2017-07-26 05:10:54 UTC <RichardHW27> Will the #RoyalRumble2018 in Philly be as loud as they were when @WWERomanReigns won in 2015?
890303345012899840 2017-07-26 20:10:33 UTC <RichardHW27> @ReneeYoungWWE @WWE That is why is brand split is just pointless
890297502578167808 2017-07-26 19:47:20 UTC <RichardHW27> If @WWENeville is on @WWE205Live why isn't @KalistoWWE on 205Live? Give @KalistoWWE a chance. #WWE
890264469208780802 2017-07-26 17:36:04 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE took away pro because they say it isn't relevant. Next they will take entrance music out becuz it hurts the ears. #WWE #BringBackPyro
890196861398732800 2017-07-26 13:07:25 UTC <RichardHW27> @IAmJericho @WWE @SashaBanksWWE Everybody goes back to Raw. That's why the brand split is pointless
890063678883729408 2017-07-25 04:18:12 UTC <RichardHW27> When @WWE put on a crappy #BATTLEGROUND PPV they totally redeem themselves with #SmackDownLive
889608358474502144 2017-07-24 22:08:55 UTC <RichardHW27> Wait @NiaJaxWWE and @AlexaBliss_WWE is going to be on the new season of Total Divas? No more of Women's Revolution. #WWE
889598347551682560 2017-07-24 21:29:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Please @WWE let #MondayNightRAW be better than the crap we watched last night. #MakeWWEGreatAgain
889597621530185728 2017-07-24 21:26:15 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @RusevBUL You deserve better
889592611106947072 2017-07-24 21:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> I'm still sick to my stomach from watching #Battleground2017. The return of @WWE from 2008-2011.
889480306645979137 2017-07-24 13:40:05 UTC <RichardHW27> @Wee Please @WEE end the fued between @RandyOrton and @JinderMahal. Randy Orton deserves much better.
889478268860211200 2017-07-24 13:31:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Is this when I cancel @WWENetwork until a few days before #WrestleMania?
889478033148710913 2017-07-24 13:31:03 UTC <RichardHW27> For me it was the booking and the way the  matches ended. Nothing last night got me pumped for #summerslam2017
889477495703183361 2017-07-24 13:28:55 UTC <RichardHW27> I don't know what to think about @WWE.  Last night #Battleground2017 was forgetful.
889349052646797312 2017-07-23 04:58:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @JohnCena @WWE Rusev was better off staying off TV. He was more relevant then.
887510745168179201 2017-07-18 03:13:45 UTC <RichardHW27> @ShinsukeN Thank you King of Strong Style!

887310361216548864 2017-07-18 13:57:30 UTC <RichardHW27> Last night its a reminder to dvr @WWE. The crap I just watched. #WWE #RIPAmericanAlpha

887133296907386880 2017-07-17 02:13:54 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE has lost their minds. Did they hire the same writer who wrote the Katie Vick storyline? #WWE #MondayNightRAW
885269948679028737 2017-07-12 22:49:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @RealJeffJarrett is done running his ponzi scheme (GFW) it seems he is full force keeping @MATTHARDYBRAND from his creation. #fuckthatowl
884448480168734720 2017-07-10 16:25:24 UTC <RichardHW27> Does @WWE have the guts for a double turn tonight?
883906442998231041 2017-07-08 04:31:32 UTC <RichardHW27> @TheRealXPac It's not that WWE sucks it's just that ROH and NJPW are killing it. WWE live events are great but their tv shows are too watered down.

880421802681528320 2017-06-29 13:44:49 UTC <RichardHW27> Keep @WWEAsuka and @NikkiCrossWWE in @WWENXT.  Do not ruin them on the main roster.
878307077390716928 2017-06-23 17:41:40 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE  has ruined the women's revolution. Time for the title to go back to Diva title. Sucks for the true women wrestlers. #WWE
877627970919297024 2017-06-21 20:43:08 UTC <RichardHW27> Is @WWE ruining the women's division on raw? And #SmackDownLIVE where is half the talent?
876865848211906560 2017-06-19 18:14:44 UTC <RichardHW27> Now @NFL is going political. Ratings will drop even more
866486959635660801 2017-05-21 02:52:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE @wwe gain viewers in India loses viewers in America. #WTF #WWE

864335924959879168 2017-05-15 04:25:17 UTC <RichardHW27> @therealec3 Go to WWE
864223169586049024 2017-05-15 20:57:14 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is the news for...politics.
859554100010266629 2017-05-02 23:44:01 UTC <RichardHW27> @JinderMahal @WWEBrayWyatt @RandyOrton @WWE Yes the mean street posse is back!
859454842682703872 2017-05-02 17:09:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn is still going political. And ratings going down and people losing jobs.
857331129812168705 2017-04-26 20:30:44 UTC <RichardHW27> @DilfersDime deserves better. One of the best. Hope to see him on TV soon
857305290257158144 2017-04-26 18:48:03 UTC <RichardHW27> Feel bad 4 the guys who lost their job @espn. So does that mean no more politics BS and just sports? I hope.
857061494890037248 2017-04-25 02:39:18 UTC <RichardHW27> No @BeckyLynchWWE on #SDLive? What a shame.
857025131541127168 2017-04-25 00:14:48 UTC <RichardHW27> I forgot that @WWE has a PPV this Sunday. How did that happen?
856952904917319682 2017-04-25 19:27:48 UTC <RichardHW27> What in the heck is the @WWE doing with @FinnBalor? Dang @BraunStrowman? No hope against @WWERomanReigns. The writers such for @WWE.
856481039669133312 2017-04-24 12:12:47 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEBrayWyatt @WWE Another loss
856199994621251584 2017-04-23 17:36:00 UTC <RichardHW27> Did @VinceMcMahon call @JohnCena the Babe Ruth of the #WWE? That is too funny. Too many before him. Maybe the Pete Rose of the WWE.
855893853542461446 2017-04-22 21:19:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @KalistoWWE @WWE @RealKurtAngle Braun vs Kalisto? Look out Rey Kalisto another human dart
854809278175170560 2017-04-19 21:29:48 UTC <RichardHW27> @RandyOrton @JinderMahal @WWEUniverse Jinder getting a title shot? I'm sure Kurt Hawkins is pissed. Now if we James Ellsworth to juice up he may get a title shot.
854805152590692354 2017-04-19 21:13:24 UTC <RichardHW27> @espn @FoxNews has competition for political rhetoric. @ESPN is catching up.
854548515917377536 2017-04-18 04:13:37 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE really? Jinder Mahal? Catch on #MondayNightRAW @TheCurtHawkins will win #1 contender for Universal Title.
851979172545167361 2017-04-11 02:03:58 UTC <RichardHW27> @ilikesamizayn What a great main event on #SmackDownLIVE. @AJStylesOrg @iLikeSamiZayn and @BaronCorbinWWE put on a show. A+.  #WWE

851964669833220096 2017-04-11 01:06:20 UTC <RichardHW27> So #SmackDownLIVE women's division is pretty much all heels.
851910286810468353 2017-04-11 21:30:14 UTC <RichardHW27> Will we see @SashaBanksWWE on #Smackdown tonight? #WWE
851909052296822785 2017-04-11 21:25:20 UTC <RichardHW27> My #WMmoment would be the @MATTHARDYBRAND and @JEFFHARDYBRAND return. Also seeing the Undertaker last match.

851506696367341568 2017-04-10 18:46:31 UTC <RichardHW27> @MATTHARDYBRAND needs to be traded tonight and when Smackdown tag titles. Why not it will be the titles relevant again. #WWE
851485913221910528 2017-04-10 17:23:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Who's ready for #Raw Shake Up? @SashaBanksWWE? @FinnBalor? Hopefully @MsCharlotteWWE is ready. Hoping for a entertaining night. #WWE

848517178894766081 2017-04-02 12:47:14 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEAsuka @WWE The title doesn't make the champion. The champion makes the title. Asuka is the best.

846916377025937410 2017-03-28 02:46:13 UTC <RichardHW27> Where was @DeanAmbroseNet? He wasn't on #Smackdown tonight. Very weird.
846901516753485824 2017-03-28 01:47:10 UTC <RichardHW27> Smackdown is so much better than Raw. The storytelling is much better. #Smackdown #Raw

846574980963975168 2017-03-27 04:09:38 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWEUniverse @WWE There will be 29 holes for 29 souls. No..Smackdown is my home..No. Roman u will rest in peace
846561395177115649 2017-03-27 03:15:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE If this was just a normal Raw it would be good. But not the last raw before Wrestlemania. 4/10
846536189557587968 2017-03-27 01:35:30 UTC <RichardHW27> What the heck did I just watch with the New Day? Dumb. #Raw #WWE

842428747005464576 2017-03-16 17:33:59 UTC <RichardHW27> Who's ready for Wrestlemania? More like #Boremania. Where is @FinnBalor? Where is @ShinsukeN? Frick Roman Reigns. #WWE #Raw
841829764285505537 2017-03-14 01:53:50 UTC <RichardHW27> #Raw and #Smackdown did not build or excite me for Wrestlemania.
841822807923265538 2017-03-14 01:26:12 UTC <RichardHW27> AJ vs Shane? Who would a thunk it. Come on #Smackdown you are better than this.
841809593114206209 2017-03-14 00:33:41 UTC <RichardHW27> Is AJ Styles waiting on Kurt Angle? #WWE #Smackdown
841677078256865280 2017-03-14 15:47:07 UTC <RichardHW27> Way to go @WWE to build up Wrestlemania. I have no interest on the Raw brand. Hopefully #SmackDownLIVE is much better. #WWE #Raw #Smackdown
841483867961851905 2017-03-13 02:59:22 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE No Finn Baylor? 3 weeks until Wrestle mania? WTH. #WWE #Wrestlemania

838778167955447808 2017-03-06 15:47:53 UTC <RichardHW27> @WWE is it too late to get my 3 hours back watching that crap last night.  I know bring back Flair to go over @FinnBalor? Good grief.
836340868823003136 2017-02-27 22:22:56 UTC <RichardHW27> Really @WWE Beth Phoenix? What about Woman? Miss Elizabeth?
836198862754885632 2017-02-27 12:58:39 UTC <RichardHW27> @oscars Thank you @Oscars for showing your ignorance and your political BS. One of the reasons why liberals lost the Whitehouse. Unite not divide.
831543511673626624 2017-02-14 16:39:57 UTC <RichardHW27> Thank you @Thegrammysrp_  for allowing us to see more of the ones who keep promoting more division between us. # unite #America
831355424809050112 2017-02-13 04:12:33 UTC <RichardHW27> For 8 years they taught peace tolerance and unity. Now many of those are the most intolerant and hateful people. Let's unite not divide.
830073016247783424 2017-02-10 15:16:43 UTC <RichardHW27> The tolerant=intolerant. The peaceful minds are the ones usually use violence.  America stand together not divided. #America #Together
829371329379971072 2017-02-08 16:48:28 UTC <RichardHW27> @jefflongUA how many were at the game last night?  Thank goodness for free pizza!
829167448662368256 2017-02-07 03:18:19 UTC <RichardHW27> Arkansas lost to Vanderbilt? How does that happen?  @jefflongUA I hope you watched the game. Many wished they didn't.

825827290126962693 2017-01-29 22:05:43 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win tonight @AJStylesOrg or @JohnCena?
825760470397308928 2017-01-29 17:40:12 UTC <RichardHW27> Who is going to win the Royal Rumble? Please @WWE let it be someone not expecting to win it. Surprise angle is much more fun.
