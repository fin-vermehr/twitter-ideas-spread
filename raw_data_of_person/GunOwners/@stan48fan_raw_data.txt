967684924231770112 2018-02-25 08:57:19 UTC <stan48fan> @FS1 I appreciate you televising @NHRA drag Racing but every time you cut qualifying short to some some ufc BULLSHIT post fight when we have been waiting for the @NHRA coverage give the @NHRA  the coverage they deserve not this other BULLSHIT, it's the fastest growing motorsport
967434274696609792 2018-02-24 16:21:19 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass But Denny does this same crap to other drivers every year, like Chase last year, now people are standing up to him and now he doesn't like it and he's the one who started the Adderall BS

957689880057864192 2018-01-28 19:00:35 UTC <stan48fan> Does anyone think this new show @Velocity called last stop garage is scrapes the bottom of the barrel as far as @Velocity wanting us to believe that this crap is halfway real, they don't even try to make it seem halfway believeable I can't imagine they waste there money on this
957688362600603648 2018-01-28 18:54:33 UTC <stan48fan> @Velocity At least try and make it look real your homemade emergencys should at least look half ass real but to a viewing person with half a brain it's insulting for you to try a have us believe this BS, I mean come on hire someone to produce your so called emergency,s like me
957685393998008320 2018-01-28 18:42:45 UTC <stan48fan> @GanassiChip chip once again your doing a KICK ASS job at the 24 hope you bring it home, in any regards Great Job!!!!!

954645622702788608 2018-01-20 09:23:47 UTC <stan48fan> @NASCARHall @NASCAR Robert Yates built the best engines Nascar ever seen the engines of today are still built on his platform, he was light years ahead of all his peers and not to mention he was self taught#THEMAN
954640451927130113 2018-01-20 09:03:14 UTC <stan48fan> @willisbitchin What do you think the highest price car is going to be is it leaning towards a classic or hand built or import it should be interesting, every year seems like something steals the show out of left field, we will all see together I guess!!
954514314282467328 2018-01-19 00:42:01 UTC <stan48fan> @NHRA to bad to hear about  englishtown not hosting a @NHRA event but mabee double up @RaceSonoma #awsomeweatherawsomewinetasting

954417142971039744 2018-01-19 18:15:53 UTC <stan48fan> @TXracegirl48 I agree Monster Energy is dragging this on way to long I believe this will be there last year, @NASCAR needs to learn from @NHRA and treat there fan base better and stop playing favorites to certian manufacturers and teams
954230024390918144 2018-01-18 05:52:21 UTC <stan48fan> @willisbitchin Cool that would be a blast to take around the track for a few laps

954040585614106624 2018-01-18 17:19:35 UTC <stan48fan> @NascarWorldNews Would everyone give this topic a rest I don't think Dale jr got as much press as Danica,s love life, please Enough is Enough

951520710098210816 2018-01-11 18:26:30 UTC <stan48fan> Sometimes it's frustrating when you try and ask a question, and no one will talk to you unless you're famous or have 2 million following
951519999251775488 2018-01-11 18:23:40 UTC <stan48fan> I guess no reply bacause I'm not the star of roadkill

949492629682634752 2018-01-05 04:07:38 UTC <stan48fan> @KimDickens just watched blind side Again you were great @ playing your part
949337042026086400 2018-01-05 17:49:23 UTC <stan48fan> @BuschBeer @KevinHarvick @StewartHaasRcng The 559,er,s are ready
948702766276296705 2018-01-03 23:49:00 UTC <stan48fan> @KyleLarsonRacin @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @bradwhitfield19 @Cat4_88 @KeithZimmy5600 Finally some almost middle ground
948322045477056512 2018-01-02 22:36:09 UTC <stan48fan> The Skyline That Lied: When Nissan Built A Race Car It Probably Wished You&#39;d Forget https://jalopnik.com/the-skyline-that-lied-when-nissan-built-a-race-car-it-1821574622about:invalid#zSoyz this video doesn't help the dude never runs it hard, put a real driver in there like Kyle Larson, then we can tell
947083477555351552 2017-12-30 12:34:31 UTC <stan48fan> Will how long does the average build take@willisbitchin
946796619416027136 2017-12-29 17:34:39 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @bradwhitfield19 @Cat4_88 So your saying if a regular Joe did the same thing he would not be liable, would that be correct
946793756249833472 2017-12-29 17:23:16 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @bradwhitfield19 @Cat4_88 What are the rookies supposed to due when @KyleLarsonRacin shows up to race, park there cars and watch
946793324467273729 2017-12-29 17:21:33 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @bradwhitfield19 @Cat4_88 So now there's different rules for your experience level, don't think that will work, the only way people like Kevin Ward get better is running with more experience racers
946791524745875456 2017-12-29 17:14:24 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @bradwhitfield19 @Cat4_88 So should Sterling Marlin be sued for wrongful death of Dale Earnhardt
946574843381669893 2017-12-28 02:53:23 UTC <stan48fan> @GanassiChip I guess it's a coin toss since there's no testing allowed, thanks chip it's cool to have someone like you to reply or even read my tweets
946571444313399296 2017-12-28 02:39:53 UTC <stan48fan> @GanassiChip chip do you think the new camero is going to be a better car than the SS will it close the gap on the Toyotas just wondering what you think
946568502785204224 2017-12-28 02:28:12 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @JeffGordonFan70 @Cat4_88 @MrsHuney8814 Well said if it was a local Joe we never would have heard about it, in the end it's all about $ but if the wards prevail and win the case then that will kill all local Racing, since a waiver meant nothing, no body will want to take a chance and get sued by money hunters
945387597542522880 2017-12-25 20:15:42 UTC <stan48fan> @BrittanyForce Brittany can you tell us yet if you're gonna be in @MonsterEnergy colors for ,2018 and further
945222087873933312 2017-12-25 09:18:01 UTC <stan48fan> @GanassiChip , Chip your one of my favorite owners, your a straight shooter, you have a great eye for talent, I live about 2 hours south of where Kyle Larson lived, thanks for giving him a shot, I so wish I could move to north Carolina and work for you, have a great holiday!!!
945220354766553090 2017-12-25 09:11:08 UTC <stan48fan> I would so love to take a trip to Abu Dhabi or Dubai, definitely high on my bucket list, but in reality a goal that is too far out of my reach, unless by a miracle we WIN the Lottery lol
945219212242436096 2017-12-25 09:06:36 UTC <stan48fan> @blake_randleman thanks for liking my tweet, I'm kinda new at this and it's nice to get someone to do that, Thanks Again and have a Merry Christmas, and happy holidays!!
944021255522476032 2017-12-21 01:46:21 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve Nascar needs a overhaul of the top brass from top to bottom, voted in by the fans, Nascar is dieing a slow death by the people running it because there not in touch with the most important things, the FANS, without the fans @NASCAR doesn't exist, fans are everything
944019720973381632 2017-12-21 01:40:15 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve Mr. O'Donnell it's funny how you won't answer or acknowledge anyone's text about Nascar and and anything controversial about Nascar unless they are someone famous, you claim you like the fans but won't lower your standards and answer any of us no names,#notintouch
944016583046787074 2017-12-21 01:27:47 UTC <stan48fan> @SiriusXMNASCAR @ClaireBLang Brian France running the show into the ground
943544806839427072 2017-12-20 18:13:06 UTC <stan48fan> @DanicaPatrick will be in the @NASCARHall , no doubt, she has broke so many records and has done more in racecars than most out there, and given the right situation could still beat 90% of the field, it's a sign of the times veteran drivers being pushed out for low cost rookies
943542617689661440 2017-12-20 18:04:24 UTC <stan48fan> Why is @DanicaPatrick and Ricky WHO splitting become a major breaking news story, Give it a break this happens thousands of times a day, are you so called journalist so bored you have to resort to story's like this, why not do a breaking news story @DaleJr grocery list.
943541326397632512 2017-12-20 17:59:17 UTC <stan48fan> Danica, Stenhouse Jr. end 5-year relationshiphttp://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/21803723
943421201044578305 2017-12-20 10:01:56 UTC <stan48fan> @MonsterEnergy I know Monster has a lot of sponsor obligations but I don't really think it's fair to keep @NASCAR  waiting on your decision if you're not going to resign just tell them, nobody would blame you, because of the ASS backwards way Brian France runs Nascar just man up
942448348908331010 2017-12-17 17:36:10 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve I just don't know why you people won't admit when you make a mistake, it's just swept under the run admit your mistakes fix what you can and fans can accept that don't treat us like idiots
942443350669410304 2017-12-17 17:16:19 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve @B_DayKH4 @DrewbieTheGOAT Nascar officials can't see what's going on cause there head is in the sand, and don't give a rats ass what the fans want, they only cater to the network's, and last but surely not least TOYOTA, the are the true runners of the sport with there extremely DEEP POCKETS
941430828172578816 2017-12-14 22:12:55 UTC <stan48fan> @SteveTorrence @AmandaBusick Amanda, people don't say this enough but the skills you bring to @NHRA, and on @FOXSports  and off the track has set a new gold standard, you can tell what you do is from the heart and not just a job, other broadcasters can sure learn from your passion, WELL DONE
940509668371152896 2017-12-12 09:12:33 UTC <stan48fan> @Godislove393 your so lucky to live in Virginia, it's such a beautiful place, we went with my daughter on a FFA trip to DC to see the sites it was so touching, I'm a vet, and it was very emotional!
940508243440177153 2017-12-12 09:06:53 UTC <stan48fan> @ClaireBLang If you could send me a private message and explain it to me I'm so confused
939921964679946240 2017-12-10 18:17:13 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve @ brianfrance, unless your a multi millionaire, or a famous driver or team owner, these @NASCAR  officials and elite journalist won't give you the time of day, I thought Twitter was supposed to connect the Masse's but it just makes more of a devide
939919899756863488 2017-12-10 18:09:01 UTC <stan48fan> @NASCARHall @NASCAR @odsteve @thebrianfrance Brian why don't you join in and help me get these stuck up Nascar officials answer some of our concerns let's bring them out of hiding and make them talk to the casual fan and not just the elite 1 percenter's
939901909174960128 2017-12-10 16:57:32 UTC <stan48fan> @katrinachilders @RodneyChilders4 I had that happen to a McChicken sandwich yesterday only I was 10 Miles down the the road so had a lettice and mayo sandwich#wheresthebeef @McDonalds

939468800608501760 2017-12-09 12:16:31 UTC <stan48fan> @botpockrass feel free to join in with your opinion BOT I know you have one let's try to get someone at Nascar to reply to our questions
939467848312696833 2017-12-09 12:12:44 UTC <stan48fan> @JennaFryer I'm a long time Nascar fan but I'm concerned about the direction the sport is going with poor leadership and lack of connection with the fans ratings and attendance is down weekly and none of the top officials will answer on Twitter what is your opinion on Nascar now
939465863232491520 2017-12-09 12:04:50 UTC <stan48fan> @botpockrass what is your opinion of Nascar and how can we get them to listen to us or acknowledge we even exist
939464749971992582 2017-12-09 12:00:25 UTC <stan48fan> @ClaireBLang Claire, I'm a life long Nascar fan, but the sport is starting to be a bit of a circus, and the normal fan has no say so, the big boys won't bother to answer our questions on Twitter, they ignore us WILL you give a openion of the current condition of Nascar!!!
939463345119281157 2017-12-09 11:54:50 UTC <stan48fan> @JennS @StephanieReady @hornets @JennaFryer @jenns fryer mabee you will answer me but prob not, I'm not a famous name or driver but what do you think about the current condition of Nascar
939462305145700352 2017-12-09 11:50:42 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @botpockrass @JamaicaBob3 But why can't we the fans get Nascar to listen to us the fans or even acknowledge us on Twitter, it's like we don't exist
939461247937888256 2017-12-09 11:46:30 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass @botpockrass @JamaicaBob3 The first thing@Nascar needs to do is vote Brian France out before he single handedly runs the sport in the ground, if it keeps going the way it is INDY CAR Racing will be more popular
939456933798359040 2017-12-09 11:29:21 UTC <stan48fan> @NASCARHall @odsteve Keep up the dog and pony show, you know @NASCAR is in the worst shape ever, lowest attendance in years, TV ratings in the BASEMENT, and RATINGS that drop weekly and know Transparency, IE BRIAN FRANCE,s strange behavior at the banquet,and a normal Nascar action, say Nothing
939454966292389888 2017-12-09 11:21:32 UTC <stan48fan> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Keep up the great work you doing POTUS, your doing a great job and we all thank you, screw all those DEM'S, and nasayer,s keep draining the swamp, and keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!! Your the best we have had in many years, GOD Bless You SIR!!!
939453079673454592 2017-12-09 11:14:03 UTC <stan48fan> @NASCARHall @NASCAR @odsteve Steve are you and the other officials going to be able to watch the banquet with your head in the sand, I know you don't reply to us nobodys on Twitter, you have to be famous or have a big name, we're just shit that don't matter to you, but answer the question about Brian France
939239097112993792 2017-12-08 21:03:45 UTC <stan48fan> @9kah9ne9 @thebrianfrance Nobody knows
938944938401656832 2017-12-07 01:34:52 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass Nascar needs to be more transparent, there's a Huge gap between the fans Nascar, be more like F1
938943951632973825 2017-12-07 01:30:57 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve And they wonder why attendance and viewership is constantly on the downward spiral, Nascar is not in anyway connected to the FANS, there who makes this all possible, I'm sure that's why monster is waiting so long to decide on ,2019-2020
938942861826965504 2017-12-07 01:26:37 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve One thing that you can always count on is Nascar not explaining there actions, like Brian France,s strange behavior with Martin Truex Jr, during the ring ceremony, as with any of there controversial actions it's always ignored, fans want transparency, or a reason, 
938848557355876352 2017-12-07 19:11:53 UTC <stan48fan> @thebrianfrance @9kah9ne9 This is not the real Brian France
938546631917518848 2017-12-06 23:12:09 UTC <stan48fan> @keselowski @TeamBKR @LandonHuffman Why did Brad decide to close down anyway
938093803151306752 2017-12-05 17:12:46 UTC <stan48fan> I agree
937867230028500992 2017-12-04 02:12:27 UTC <stan48fan> The NHRA is cool cause even the underdog, small teams can win on any sunday

937737908974317568 2017-12-04 17:38:34 UTC <stan48fan> @bobpockrass Monster is definitely not renewing after Brian France,s attitude, he needs to be voted out, before he does more damage, they are going to have a hell of a time finding a big time sponsor with Brian at the helm
937733420636975104 2017-12-04 17:20:44 UTC <stan48fan> @Kenny_Wallace Herm what's your take on Brian France,s strange behavior at the awards ceremony

937388203526406144 2017-12-03 18:28:58 UTC <stan48fan> @odsteve Is Nascar going to talk about how wierd Brian France was at the banquet, or stick there head in the sand as normal.
937387060385550337 2017-12-03 18:24:25 UTC <stan48fan> @NASCAR Is Nascar going to stick there head in the sand like always or MAN Up and talk about Brian France wierd night at the awards!!!!!
936712699844509696 2017-12-01 21:44:45 UTC <stan48fan> @jeff_gluck Why did Brian France run off of the stage when handing @MartinTruex_Jr his championship ring couldn't slow down enough to even shake his hand, What's Up With That
