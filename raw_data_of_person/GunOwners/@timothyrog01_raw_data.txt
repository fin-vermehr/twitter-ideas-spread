970683628886818817 2018-03-05 15:33:06 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist Whether* oof auto-correct
970682584874323968 2018-03-05 15:28:57 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist Just clarifying
970682497838264320 2018-03-05 15:28:36 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist The mixing of facts and potential intentions is getting confusing. End of the day those numbers are overweight, and weather someone wants to admit it or not, it's not healthy; and something should be done.
970681462193311745 2018-03-05 15:24:29 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist But there is a difference between concern and malicious intent.
970681225571721216 2018-03-05 15:23:33 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist Someone's health is very much other non-doctors' concern. I've even heard complaints of doctor's bringing up weight, and people getting upset at that.
970680936407977984 2018-03-05 15:22:24 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist But an overweight BMI isn't healthy
970680561793675264 2018-03-05 15:20:54 UTC <timothyrog01> @sarcast1cartist @cheeesewheeeze Your initial tweet made it seem like all comments were malicious and only  hiding behind the mask of concern. Body shaming should not exist for static characteristics. Things that can be changed however, while I don't think should be harshly shamed, can ultimately be changed.
970677808270848001 2018-03-05 15:09:58 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist I don't even know what you mean? I'm saying it's not bad to worry about someone's health based on their weight, and you throw numbers out there that would make someone overweight. I don't see why I can't comment on a fact.
970677412018229248 2018-03-05 15:08:23 UTC <timothyrog01> @sarcast1cartist @cheeesewheeeze I wouldn't do it to a stranger, anyone who does is an ass
970674236913315841 2018-03-05 14:55:46 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist Being 5'6 and 160 is overweight, and while it's not THAT bad, it definitely is limiting and could lead to further health issues.
970669871829745665 2018-03-05 14:38:26 UTC <timothyrog01> @cheeesewheeeze @sarcast1cartist 160 lbs but what height? At the very least it could be detriment to quality of life. There definitely are assholes who hide behind excuses.
970667572407537664 2018-03-05 14:29:18 UTC <timothyrog01> @sarcast1cartist @cheeesewheeeze Sorry I don't want someone to die
970488018720247810 2018-03-04 02:35:49 UTC <timothyrog01> @PWCSNews The part where you say to keep monitoring for updates gives me hope
970456782253580289 2018-03-04 00:31:41 UTC <timothyrog01> What difference will a two hour delay make?
