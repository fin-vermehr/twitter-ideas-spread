892549609003900928 2017-08-01 00:56:24 UTC <DJStarjun> @Marvel are better at creating "controversy" then they are creating a comic book that normal people actually wanna read. #MakeMineMilkshake

882248317597626368 2017-07-04 14:42:44 UTC <DJStarjun> I mean like what you like, but if you start talking to some1 who is actually got a good amount of knowledge on the subject, they will judge
882247105959612416 2017-07-04 14:37:56 UTC <DJStarjun> These kids who watch the Big Bang theory and think they know a thing or two about comic books hahahaha!!!
