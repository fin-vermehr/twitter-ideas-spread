943899722942619649 2017-12-21 17:43:25 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @BachCan  Lyndsay overtly demonstrated her immaturity in the way she spoke on After the Final Rose. She needs to get off the nipple of her dysfunctional family or settle for some milktoast subservient geek down the road. Funny how beauty doesnt always mean beautiful inside.

938075572944506881 2017-12-05 16:00:19 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero I agree, however it takes a strong individual to stand up against the grain of family ties. I am not sure Lyndsay has that in her ..... yet !
937892580926226433 2017-12-04 03:53:11 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero Yes, tough decision for Chris, for as nice as she is, who needs to add more hassle & stress to their life when far less complicated relationships are out there even if none of these women are truly  the one .
937865145283264512 2017-12-04 02:04:09 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero Lyndsey seems quite mature, I do however think shes a bit blind to the influence her family has over her & that would really concern me if I were Chris.

938280741133103104 2017-12-05 05:35:35 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero well said & Ive always said..... love finds you, you dont find it. Enjoy the show tomorrow.
938075572944506881 2017-12-05 16:00:19 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero I agree, however it takes a strong individual to stand up against the grain of family ties. I am not sure Lyndsay has that in her ..... yet !
937892580926226433 2017-12-04 03:53:11 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero Yes, tough decision for Chris, for as nice as she is, who needs to add more hassle & stress to their life when far less complicated relationships are out there even if none of these women are truly  the one .
937865145283264512 2017-12-04 02:04:09 UTC <NerveDoctor1> @ampincivero Lyndsey seems quite mature, I do however think shes a bit blind to the influence her family has over her & that would really concern me if I were Chris.
