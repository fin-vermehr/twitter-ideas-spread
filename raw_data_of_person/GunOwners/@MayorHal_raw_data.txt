971417217228333058 2018-03-07 16:08:07 UTC <MayorHal> The increase in funding for NY @NYFarmNet could not come at a more crucial time.  This program provides more bang for the buck than any other program I can think of.  Hopefully someday it is fully funded and they won't have to go to Albany and beg for $ each year.  @NYGovCuomohttps://twitter.com/NYSenate/status/971140548034736128
