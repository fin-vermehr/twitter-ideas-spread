971411348205850625 2018-03-07 15:44:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand any thoughts on this article from Mike Sando. I dont think these trades would happen but they are interesting. http://nfltraderumors.co/nfl-rumors-trades-free-agency-draft/ @Marc_Bertrand @scottzolak
969650300138160130 2018-03-02 19:07:01 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti San Fran won the coin toss. @bigjimmurray
969189095967744000 2018-03-01 12:34:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich did RKK have a kid with his younger girlfriend. The rumors are swirling. @KenGriffeyRules
962391015515738112 2018-02-10 18:21:13 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray @cgasper do you guys think Bill will take the 2007 approach like he did after the 2006 season realizing he didnt have enough talent. Except this time loading up the D.
961931356308692992 2018-02-09 11:54:41 UTC <Jpaull23> @KenGriffeyRuleshttps://twitter.com/jpaull23/status/961931035805212672
961931035805212672 2018-02-09 11:53:25 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Ron borges was duped. That story he wrote in the herald was by someone who had his cellphone number and faked he was Don Ye.
960581255644565505 2018-02-05 18:29:52 UTC <Jpaull23> @adamjones985 there was no PI on the Hail Mary. Hogan never made it to the end zone because he was drilled before he even got there.
960526390792728576 2018-02-05 14:51:51 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard on the strip sack I feel like Brady was trying to get it all in one play. He had White for a good gain if he threw it too him right away. When he was on the sidelines he was asking someone if he had them. Any idea who he was talking about?
960349246145945600 2018-02-04 03:07:57 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran Brady had white for a short gain onthe fumble. Why try and get it all at once
960333318557523969 2018-02-04 02:04:39 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran 3rd down defense has hurt this team all year and it is showing up big in this game.
958437580143517698 2018-01-30 20:31:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard you say this is a good defense to defend the eagles but mike Lombardi feels this is a horrendous matchup for the pats. Please exaplin why you 2 differ. @TonyMassarotti @FelgerAndMazz
958019350132346881 2018-01-29 16:49:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand there is no subtitle when he is talking in the car.
955512226307330049 2018-01-22 18:47:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand Carlton is right about the Myles jack play.  We got away with one.
955404419297837056 2018-01-22 11:38:58 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran do you think the pats got away with the Myles Jack play. Looked like he never got touched and should have been able to take that fumble back for a touchdown. Early whistle?
955194614192967683 2018-01-21 21:45:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran 3rd down defense has been the Achilles heal for this team.  It is showing up big today.
954748466923737093 2018-01-20 16:12:27 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Congrats @RochieWBZ on the sportscaster of the year. Well deserved.
954428658386653185 2018-01-19 19:01:39 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak this make you a little for happy.https://twitter.com/michaelfhurley/status/954428013940264960
953960954403938304 2018-01-18 12:03:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Kirk is responding to your wonderful rant. I think you guys need to get on the radio together.
952657954913832960 2018-01-14 21:45:30 UTC <Jpaull23> Did we just see the end of the Pittsburgh Steelers as they are currently constituted. Leveon Bell contract issue and Big Ben possibly retiring. Should be an interesting offseason for the Steelers. @ZoandBertrand
952655039734181888 2018-01-14 21:33:55 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti Give us your answer.
952386960164835328 2018-01-13 03:48:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand glad to see you made out alright. @bigjimmurray and @cgasper are holding it down for ya.
951564292209463296 2018-01-11 21:19:41 UTC <Jpaull23> @DaleHolleyWEEI how about the edge brees gets playing in a dome his whole career.  Check out brees numbers outside.
951062891762941952 2018-01-10 12:07:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich did you guys notice in the preview of Bradys trailer that he is lifting weights.
950403297470570497 2018-01-08 16:26:18 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand absolutely is the same word Kraft used when he was asked if Bill would be back next year.
944318015918825472 2017-12-22 21:25:34 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray that wasnt the ref that was the home town call from the radio guy it just showed the ref talking to Heyward bay. He calller is wrong.
943448985209098241 2017-12-20 11:52:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich I think they should change the meaning of a football move. I think once a player decides to reach with the football that should be considered a football move.
942790051003617280 2017-12-18 16:13:59 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand Ben did have a play on 3rd down. If you look before he took the snap he and the wide receiver exchanged a signal. They knew they were going to run a slant. Dumb call but they knew what they wanted to do.
942744258737524737 2017-12-18 13:12:01 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard do you think the Pats can fix their 3rd down defense?  The past 2 weeks have not been good.
942539490085675008 2017-12-17 23:38:20 UTC <Jpaull23> @jerrythornton1 the difference in this game is 3rd down.
942538202367307776 2017-12-17 23:33:13 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard one of your 3 downs better be elandon Roberts.
942538083265900546 2017-12-17 23:32:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @PhilAPerry Elandon Roberts is having an awful day.
942536520329768961 2017-12-17 23:26:32 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran elandon Roberts has 1 job and that is to make a tackle. He missed twice on that drive.
942515871578296320 2017-12-17 22:04:29 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran pats are getting killed on 3rd down.
940550771917107203 2017-12-12 11:55:53 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard was the pressure attributed to the O line not playing well or the fact that receivers werent getting open.
940422699242967040 2017-12-11 03:26:58 UTC <Jpaull23> So it was the offensive lines fault for Xavien Howard owning Cooks and Chris hogan whiffing on the safety blitz. O line not the issue. Brady looks like crap and D cant make a stop when needed.https://twitter.com/bigjimmurray/status/940420650254118913
940406027203350530 2017-12-11 02:20:43 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe waddle is in uniform. Any reason why Fleming is playing over him? He not 100%?
938415533296357376 2017-12-06 14:31:12 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich please tell me someone is filming and you will be putting it on twitter later.
938128841071087618 2017-12-05 19:31:59 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard juju hit was a clean hit. He led with his shoulder and did not launch.
937727616928419841 2017-12-04 16:57:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @maxkellerman remind me again when Gronk has done something off the field that is controversial during the football season. Or when he has disrespected someone???
937664266995490817 2017-12-04 12:45:56 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich that last caller was a moron. They will come down with a ruling in the next day or so and then he will appeal if needed and will find out before the Miami game.
937490177169281024 2017-12-03 01:14:10 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran did you happen to talk to Butler about being taken out after that 3rd down holding call. Seemed like he was really upset for being benched for a couple plays.
936586624607117312 2017-12-01 13:23:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich please explain Thanks for once again making Toucher & Rich the #1 Morning Show in Boston for November- Men 25-54, 18-49, 18-34, and Persons 25-54...without even including the numbers of viewers from our telecast!

931123805325537280 2017-11-16 11:36:29 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich 47 hats come with a bend.
930513919545921537 2017-11-14 19:13:01 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard thank you for clarifying the run defense to @TonyMassarotti and @bigjimmurray. I was yelling thru the radio yesterday that they had 2 big plays that skewed the numbers. Take those out and Den avg about 3 yds per run.
930156249165041664 2017-11-13 19:31:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray hat wasnt a communication issue. That was butler saying hey I just got burnt tackle him. They didnt have a conversation after the play.
929916566707277826 2017-11-12 03:39:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran broncos doing the clock killing for the Pats.
929913700567404545 2017-11-12 03:27:57 UTC <Jpaull23> 3rd and 10 tipped ball keeps that drive alive. Need to answer. Dont let them keep the momentum.
929900725966200833 2017-11-12 02:36:24 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran typical patriots opponent. They are successful passing the ball yet they continue to run it.
928725403841200128 2017-11-09 20:46:05 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray the video is on the internet you need to show felger.
928709187642777601 2017-11-09 19:41:39 UTC <Jpaull23> @DaleEArnold do you agree with his clarification of what he meant by he that he was talking about himself?

928598902202339328 2017-11-09 12:23:25 UTC <Jpaull23> @kirkmin I didnt know your callers were so soft.
928595802376859649 2017-11-09 12:11:06 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich you guys going to weigh in on the Felger story because your competitors across the street are going off on him. Just curious where you guys stand.
927957894867423232 2017-11-07 17:56:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak Tell shaughnessy Wheaton is in Norton and the wing place is Wendells Pub. Phenomenal wings.

924714324224028672 2017-10-29 19:07:29 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran although the chargers have played dumb, when the pats D has had to step up they have. Also Harris has looked good.
924701780784701440 2017-10-29 18:17:39 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin are we not talking enough about the Pats struggles in the red zone.
924692962851852290 2017-10-29 17:42:36 UTC <Jpaull23> @PhilAPerry Marsh is getting killed on the edge. Looks like he was out on that last 3rd play game.
924689574194024450 2017-10-29 17:29:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran Hogan is getting killed by Adai on Jose run plays.
923537897919311872 2017-10-26 13:12:48 UTC <Jpaull23> The giants may want to look to get something for him since he is a UFA and he is familiar with the system.https://twitter.com/jpaull23/status/923537552107360256
923537552107360256 2017-10-26 13:11:25 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran with the T-deadline coming up and with the Hi news any possibility they look at Casillas. Hes been pretty good since he left.
922302170766200832 2017-10-22 03:22:27 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin love the tv view. You can really see how beat the Falcons D is when Lewis is running.
922301667596472320 2017-10-22 03:20:27 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran I believe mcdaniels told him if you want it you go it
922298443682451462 2017-10-22 03:07:39 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran David Harris has brought it tonight
920647228838072320 2017-10-18 13:46:18 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Mr Deeds Winona was alright.
920463618805821441 2017-10-17 01:36:42 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran jaylon smith not Myles jack. But I knew what you meant. Had the same injury and nerve damage as him senior year.
919910256456683521 2017-10-16 12:57:50 UTC <Jpaull23> @HackswithHaggs I know the Pats played yesterday but the biggest story in Boston should have been that we lost to Malcolm subban. 
919908701225541633 2017-10-16 12:51:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Pitt did the same thing to KC in the playoffs last year. Not a surprise it happened again.
919639788604542978 2017-10-15 19:03:06 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard was that play supposed to be butler or bademosi. Butler went with the motion but didn't stay with him.
919629545392701440 2017-10-15 18:22:24 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak why the home run all the time. So frustrating
919628050689593345 2017-10-15 18:16:27 UTC <Jpaull23> @GregABedard don't understand why jets keep handing off the ball. They have had success throwing it.
919620087061139457 2017-10-15 17:44:49 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran this team is an absolute joke. Even if they come back to win it's not looking good.
914650279072731136 2017-10-01 00:36:34 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak is it a good thing that the mistakes seem to be communication issues and not physical issues? D is beating themselves.
914646684847702021 2017-10-01 00:22:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran is the silver lining in this D that it is correctable mistakes and not physical?
914585025085153281 2017-10-01 20:17:16 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer that was butler saying the ball was tipped because he saw the flag.
914582528257904641 2017-10-01 20:07:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran when you get a chance ask devin how it feels to have the worst defense in football. Would love to know.
912687884100136960 2017-09-26 14:38:43 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti doesn't the way the sox are ending the season seem very similar to last year. Let's see how the last 2 series go.
912389819623501826 2017-09-25 18:54:19 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray probably should have dropped that "fucking asshole" by Mazz. Haha. #nofilter
912285746991632384 2017-09-25 12:00:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich 4 fg and 1 D TD (19 pts). As a whole I don't think the D was awful. Watson made some ridiculous plays as well.  Reaching?

854706904295235585 2017-04-19 14:43:00 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand they already came out and said they will not be commenting on it.
854651102196883456 2017-04-19 11:01:16 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich you think he really committed suicide......
850433807043964929 2017-04-07 19:43:14 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray Nantz is even commenting on how Phil is "toughing it out". A "gust of wind". Aka fart @TonyMassarotti
850002778575556609 2017-04-06 15:10:29 UTC <Jpaull23> @ShannonSharpe the flaw in your argument with @RobGronkowski is in season he is all business. Off-season he enjoys. Big difference.
847508474283966467 2017-03-30 17:59:00 UTC <Jpaull23> @hardy985 same thing happened to me. Kept yelling at it like "how are you still beeping!!" Then threw it outside.
847038083287666688 2017-03-29 10:49:50 UTC <Jpaull23> @KenGriffeyRules ravens entire offense held to run out the clock.
846678199807475712 2017-03-28 10:59:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich @FredToucher should have never doubted you Freddy T. 
846676074822033408 2017-03-28 10:51:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich Fred you are wrong. He's guaranteed 6 from the mil. If the pats pay him 3 he will get 9 total.
846675760404447232 2017-03-28 10:50:06 UTC <Jpaull23> @FredToucher you are wrong. As long as pats pay him less than 6 the jets owe him.
846675048652050432 2017-03-28 10:47:16 UTC <Jpaull23> @FredToucher jets are paying him 6 mil regardless.
843069406443962369 2017-03-18 11:59:44 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran why no butler deal yet. Think there is a chance he comes back.
842377648844206080 2017-03-16 14:10:56 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand revis is still about the money. Asking for 8 mil. Stilll getting 6 mil from jets. Looking for that 14 mil total.
842068327501561856 2017-03-15 17:41:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand so much for Patriots players being mad at BB and will leave.  Carlton hello, hello...
841781241229787136 2017-03-14 22:41:02 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran I think they want to see another year of production. Pat Chung was good in first 2 yrs. next 2 years not so much.
841780797682122753 2017-03-14 22:39:16 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran I agree with the pats about the MB situation. As much as I love MB 2 years of production isn't enough. need a bigger sample.
840364124567666689 2017-03-10 00:49:55 UTC <Jpaull23> @adamjones985https://twitter.com/jasonlacanfora/status/840363952689295360
839930166373662720 2017-03-09 20:05:31 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray here's a little news. good?https://twitter.com/PFCentral/status/839925598931808259
839926341688520704 2017-03-09 19:50:19 UTC <Jpaull23> @pfwpaul sounds like Malcom's camp is not cooperating.  Could inexperience be an issue here?https://twitter.com/PFCentral/status/839921666536968192
839846405862744064 2017-03-09 14:32:41 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich and @KenGriffeyRules what if butler gets a lower AAV but more guaranteed money?
839844263949131777 2017-03-09 14:24:10 UTC <Jpaull23> What does this mean for Hightower and butler?  I know the AAV means little it's all about the guaranteed money.https://twitter.com/mlombardinfl/status/839843968804270080
839843613794258946 2017-03-09 14:21:35 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich remember it's all about the guaranteed money not the AAV. He could be cut after 1 year. Wait and see in Butler.https://twitter.com/benvolin/status/839843211736670208
839585968717983760 2017-03-08 21:17:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray if the browns did do what Carlton said. Which first round draft pick do they have to give up. #1 or the one from philly #12?
829784188886908928 2017-02-09 20:09:01 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti I could care less about the extra innings thing. What about innings 1-9!!!!!!!
829656924010475521 2017-02-09 11:43:19 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich that audio of IT sounds like Michelle therien "crap" audio
828717629644877824 2017-02-06 21:30:54 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti he never let the back go. He put it on the ground and kept it to his side then the guy touched him. He never let it go.
828633521874939904 2017-02-06 15:56:41 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran Amendola has a knack for coming up big in these playoff and Super Bowls. Always reliable. Sneaky good games.
828633083993788416 2017-02-06 15:54:57 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand amendola seems to have a knack for showing up big in these playoff and Super Bowls. Dude balls. Very underrated @scottzolak
827541460207751168 2017-02-03 15:37:13 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand he said put Blount at linebacker with Roberts and Hightower. Wow!!! SMH.
827119677793038338 2017-02-02 11:41:12 UTC <Jpaull23> @FelgerAndMazz Kirk and Callahan ripping into you. On your stance yesterday about trump and Brady. @IAmJamesStewart
826869380352995328 2017-02-01 19:06:37 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti has it been a distraction all year? Stop trying to make a story out of nothing.
826531920985075714 2017-01-31 20:45:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray please don't take another phone call.
826066717478641670 2017-01-30 13:57:07 UTC <Jpaull23> @adamjones985 are we overrating Mohamed Sanu?  His numbers aren't all that impressive.
825090639549313026 2017-01-27 21:18:32 UTC <Jpaull23> @cgasper are we over rating Mohamed Sanu?  Stats aren't that impressive for the way people are talking about him.
825067307269517312 2017-01-27 19:45:49 UTC <Jpaull23> @FelgerAndMazz Jackie used to work for the patriots media. Originally from Georgia.
824725399380824064 2017-01-26 21:07:12 UTC <Jpaull23> @FelgerAndMazz national media seems to be leaning towards the Falcons.
824696813924061184 2017-01-26 19:13:37 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti the team with the hardest schedule, when you weigh it all out, was not that far off from the team with the easiest schedule
824696297076772866 2017-01-26 19:11:33 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti you can shake up all the other teams in the league and they are essentially the same. NO TEAMS ARE GOOD!!!
824695983305023488 2017-01-26 19:10:19 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti please stop taking about quality wins. The league sucked this year. There were 3 good teams and 3 bad teams.
824062166747779074 2017-01-24 01:11:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @michaelFhurley nice article on @DanLeBatardShow and their ignorance to know the facts before talking
823563977036800001 2017-01-23 16:12:07 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand it was a fumble. They just couldn't prove the recovery
823524957347004416 2017-01-23 13:37:04 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich it was won one more. #onemore
823365886669160448 2017-01-22 03:04:59 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer we say the same thing every week about this D and the opposing O. How come the result is still the same. Y don't teams change.
823347282540118016 2017-01-22 01:51:03 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich the zogasm on the Blount run.
823343441694380032 2017-01-22 01:35:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @JumboHart drop by Edelman hurt on that drive.
823333018949603328 2017-01-22 00:54:23 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran the other guys are beating us. James, Gabriel, Williams.
823325971134738432 2017-01-22 00:26:22 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran if I remember right Williams had a good game against them in the Thursday opening game after the super bowl. Bell was suspended
823324597491826689 2017-01-22 00:20:55 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran I was saying the same thing.https://twitter.com/tomecurran/status/823324174198382592
822456320972492800 2017-01-20 14:50:42 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich watch the end of the video. They rush to the dog because it is pretty much drowning
821771458082963460 2017-01-18 17:29:18 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand what is the percentage in those 3 games. There's a difference if he's forcing it. But if he's getting open then no problem
821727777221120000 2017-01-18 14:35:43 UTC <Jpaull23> @FredToucher way to destroy Phil. Love it.
818839073930510342 2017-01-10 15:17:03 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand what roster would you rather have going into the playoffs this year. Last years with Gronk or this years without Gronk?
815717029034545152 2017-01-01 00:31:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran after today's results isn't this the best case scenario?  Won't see Pitt or KC until the AFC Champ.
812331719848263681 2016-12-23 16:19:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @AdamMKaufman they became the sticky bandits in the second one. The gal one taped his hands and just grabbed things with the taped hands.
810879266632192001 2016-12-19 16:07:37 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand Talib was the peacemaker and laughing with Edelman.
810876829464756224 2016-12-19 15:57:56 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand they showed Floyd on the sidelines in a hoodie
810634892543479808 2016-12-18 23:56:33 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin do they not like play action on the goal line. Especially given what they do running the ball.
810632181185912832 2016-12-18 23:45:47 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran not one run on that last possession. Don't get cute. Aghhh
810631632998776832 2016-12-18 23:43:36 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti game feels very similar to last ref season game.  Ahead but can't seem to pull away.
810620754492583938 2016-12-18 23:00:23 UTC <Jpaull23> @Gary_Tanguay dump it dump it dump it.  Haha.
810609731891032065 2016-12-18 22:16:35 UTC <Jpaull23> @MikeGiardi should have been a TD
810601330448408576 2016-12-18 21:43:12 UTC <Jpaull23> @chatham58 Brady looks like he's playing scared.
808703496476356610 2016-12-13 16:01:53 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak I thought the O-line was the MVP of that game. Kept Brady upright and great in the running game. Cannon and Solder were great.
808504486893387776 2016-12-12 02:51:05 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin whatever happened to play action on the goal line and TE on the back of the end zone.
806516718474502145 2016-12-07 15:12:24 UTC <Jpaull23> @hardy985 who the hell is typing so loud in the background.
805592714456735744 2016-12-04 02:00:44 UTC <Jpaull23> @MartysaurusRex I've always wondered. Does your brother wear shoulder pads? P.S. keep grinding this year. Killing it.
805167166463115265 2016-12-03 21:49:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @adamjones985 their offense is more equipped now than it was versus Denver in the playoffs last year. Edelman was on 1 foot.
804433102122717184 2016-12-01 21:12:51 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray gronk doesn't have a leg to stand on for his contract. They can use his injury history for negotiations against him.
804408897071157248 2016-12-01 19:36:40 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray that madden curse is for real. Smh.
804147772500930560 2016-11-30 02:19:03 UTC <Jpaull23> @IAmJamesStewart it would be nice if Marcus smart never shot the ball again. It is so hard to watch.
803685158415044608 2016-11-29 19:40:48 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray @jerrythornton1 had it the whole way. Read his article on barstool.
803331035211722753 2016-11-28 20:13:38 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray from a fellow tauntonian cam is an asshat.
803314235237429249 2016-11-28 19:06:53 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray I think you are largely underestimating this rival game with the Jets. They don't blow this team out!!!! D was better
803268946061299712 2016-11-28 16:06:55 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand remember Allan branch did the same thing on a 3rd and short.
803041782313455620 2016-11-27 01:04:15 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer don't we say the same thing every week about opposing teams. "Just throw the ball on this D". How come the teams don't do it?
803035053064327168 2016-11-27 00:37:30 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer malcolm Mitchell has strong hands. Rarely catches with his body.
803033909713838082 2016-11-27 00:32:58 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer how many times did they only bring 3.
803029849279492097 2016-11-27 00:16:50 UTC <Jpaull23> @TomGilesSports please don't just play for the FG. #patriots
803028379058499584 2016-11-27 00:10:59 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran would love to know the record of teams the following week they beat the patriots. Seems like most teams lose the next week.
803014864788549633 2016-11-27 23:17:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @MikeGiardi love bennetts toughness
803013134998913024 2016-11-27 23:10:25 UTC <Jpaull23> @MikeGiardi I agree. Let them playhttps://twitter.com/mikegiardi/status/803012714285109249
803008755717832704 2016-11-27 22:53:01 UTC <Jpaull23> @Marc_Bertrand awful clock management at the end of the half.
802998741699395584 2016-11-27 22:13:13 UTC <Jpaull23> This defense is so bad @tomecurran I can't stand watching them. Haven't we learned rushing 3 and dropping 8 does nothing.
801128886473924609 2016-11-22 18:23:05 UTC <Jpaull23> @PhilAPerry isn't Tom Brady this year the definition of MVP? Especially after last weeks performance and how this defense is performing?
800460181821857792 2016-11-20 22:05:53 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran seems like they are bringing more blitzes his week. A little out of the ordinary against a running QB for the Pats. I'll take it
800058551720779776 2016-11-19 19:29:57 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe any idea if Collins and Sheard were close. And if so is Sheard pissed at Bill for trading him?
799273047404515328 2016-11-17 15:28:38 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand from the movie Friday. Ice cube and Chris Tucker say Bye Felecia to the crack head. That is he original of it.
798254425705955328 2016-11-14 20:01:00 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti the Seahawks did what the pats do. Exploit the other teams mismatch. I don't know why teams don't do it more to the pats.
798001525683613696 2016-11-13 03:16:04 UTC <Jpaull23> @Dan_Shaughnessy Seattle going for the old back to back possessions scoring at half and getting it to start the 3rd.
797993441535922176 2016-11-13 02:43:57 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran seems like they really want to establish the run tonight?
795430888238678017 2016-11-06 01:01:16 UTC <Jpaull23> @Realrclark25 liking your input on tv. Good analysis. Keep up the good work. Coming from a Pats fan.
795428587054755840 2016-11-06 00:52:08 UTC <Jpaull23> @Rodney_Harrison come on man that mark Barron hit was legal on cam newton. You're better than that.
793475414635216896 2016-11-01 15:30:55 UTC <Jpaull23> @GlennDOrdway why are you talking to this guy.
793414244603666432 2016-11-01 11:27:51 UTC <Jpaull23> @kirkmin please do not take any more phone calls from these morons. They have brought nothing to the table and know nothing.
793133433602048000 2016-10-31 16:52:00 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe was the Van Noye a precursor to this Collins move?
793132800551559168 2016-10-31 16:49:30 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand was that the reason for the Van Noye trade?
790349496513400832 2016-10-23 00:29:38 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe who was he talking to when he said baby? Hahaha.https://twitter.com/jeffphowe/status/790345870856351744
790325640234954753 2016-10-23 22:54:50 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran malcolm Mitchell could have laid a huge blindside block on the gronk play that could have got a flag. Smart play for a rookie
790322749470375941 2016-10-23 22:43:21 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran can we get pressure one time?
790316705008513025 2016-10-23 22:19:20 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand feels like one of those games the Pats are going to let slip out of their fingers.
789474708265852932 2016-10-21 14:33:32 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand mark from Medford is on crack. It would take a hell of a lot more krug to get Trouba
789198576970633216 2016-10-20 20:16:18 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti I believe heywars was already ruled out for Sunday.
788016799778480130 2016-10-17 14:00:20 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak he not only looked at the sideline but he dry humped the air in front of them. Thought it was funny but dumb on his part.
787737097608237057 2016-10-16 19:28:54 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe cheap shot by burfict?
786529283103715328 2016-10-13 11:29:28 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe that is a pretty good percentage in my book.
786389089947910148 2016-10-12 02:12:24 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe while I agree with you about butler, how many passes were thrown his way in those 3 games? #4catchesin3games #pissedofffelger
785193807470071808 2016-10-09 19:02:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin couldn't agree more with the Roberts comment. Is hightower still playing?
783092747884429312 2016-10-03 23:53:54 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran nice dig on the video reference. #loyaltytotom
782737563543109632 2016-10-02 00:22:32 UTC <Jpaull23> @FelgerAndMazz @IAmJamesStewart  mr @Dan_Shaughnessy is very salty they are already retiring Ortiz's jersey. Not to happy on Sports Sunday
782671013037412353 2016-10-02 19:58:05 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer this game felt like the Miami game.
782670890861486080 2016-10-02 19:57:36 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran this felt like the Miami game.
782661971124621312 2016-10-02 19:22:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran are Ryan and Butler afraid of the slant.
779157484879642624 2016-09-22 03:16:35 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray I think Collins heard you this week. He's been a beast in this game.
779151565441658881 2016-09-22 02:53:03 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran Ryan Allen has been huge tonight.
778225751275503616 2016-09-20 13:34:12 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich they shut down Hopkins last year with Lofan Ryan and safety help.
777637450009157632 2016-09-18 22:36:30 UTC <Jpaull23> @jeffphowe can you confirm this as well. Contradicts your source.https://twitter.com/csnne/status/777626777954975744
777614166253309952 2016-09-18 21:03:59 UTC <Jpaull23> @AlbertBreer hearing a negative on the X-ray means no dislocation to the  shoulder as well. Any chance of that?
777583758589431808 2016-09-18 19:03:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @Gary_Tanguay how excited are you right now? #Brissettporn
776461367746396160 2016-09-15 16:43:10 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand that guys phone call sucked from the opening statement.
775140055425904640 2016-09-11 01:12:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @tomecurran is Hightower out of the game?
775133540354756608 2016-09-11 00:46:51 UTC <Jpaull23> @chatham58 I was thinking the same thing on that karras call.
773866420144836609 2016-09-08 12:51:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @KenGriffeyRules when does Carson Palmer say "well according to the nfl". Never insights the nfl. @Toucherandrich
770085324106174466 2016-08-28 02:27:03 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti please ask felger on his thoughts about his boy Barnes again tomorrow.
769327358721552384 2016-08-26 00:15:10 UTC <Jpaull23> Why would he. It's not like he will be there during the first 4 gameshttps://twitter.com/benvolin/status/769323010864082944
769215509736878081 2016-08-26 16:50:43 UTC <Jpaull23> @adamjones985 why are we assuming Brady wants to play the first snaps. What if all he wants is game action and doesn't care how it happens
766586619340136448 2016-08-19 10:44:27 UTC <Jpaull23> @KenGriffeyRules you are so wrong. Tazawa never should have been in the game. Should have went right to Ziegler. #firefarell
764175511924928512 2016-08-12 19:03:34 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti did you see what the guy from South Africa was doing before they went up against each other. Taunting phelps.
763922500048662528 2016-08-11 02:18:11 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich @RochieWBZ just won the 98 mile.
763475579081547776 2016-08-10 20:42:17 UTC <Jpaull23> @bigjimmurray I believe Wright had to dive back into a base.
759945438401290240 2016-07-31 02:54:46 UTC <Jpaull23> @Jared_Carrabis these callers are on point tonight. #takethefelgerapproach
749430652379029504 2016-07-02 02:32:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak killing the @nflcommish on the holiday weekend. Love it. #freebradyhttps://twitter.com/scottzolak/status/749429511033393152
749402196643635200 2016-07-02 00:39:41 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich this would look pretty good.pic.twitter.com/Jm423KnrkX
748916071801892865 2016-07-01 16:28:00 UTC <Jpaull23> @GlobeFluto does this mean Krejci is on the way out??
747447125110366208 2016-06-27 15:10:56 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand do we know who that mystery player is that Durant wants to play with. Derozan, Durant, trade for Cousins. #fantasyland
745976283734085632 2016-06-23 13:46:20 UTC <Jpaull23> @FredToucher @ryanator699 needs Buffalo in his life. Please don't do this to him. #freefredtoucher
728597886477447168 2016-05-06 14:50:47 UTC <Jpaull23> @DannyAmendola gets it. Glad he'll be back next year.
725018850668990464 2016-04-26 17:48:58 UTC <Jpaull23> @ZoandBertrand go see the rant by birdman the rapper and you will know what the last call was about. #moron.
722060121698922496 2016-04-18 13:52:02 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich didn't the jets trade for Ryan Clady
720068865636626432 2016-04-12 01:59:30 UTC <Jpaull23> @IAmJamesStewart who gets fired first. Claude or Farrell?
708108321639829505 2016-03-10 01:52:34 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich #snarkypuppy
702510790419599360 2016-02-24 15:09:59 UTC <Jpaull23> Hey @RedSox @TheNotoriousMMA is looking to put on some lbs. Any chance he could get a hold of Pablos's nutritionist. #smh @985TheSportsHub
699326800745394180 2016-02-15 20:17:56 UTC <Jpaull23> @Keefe21 was that guy serious. Mazz voice "yea when I played ball back in the day". Lol
697488987108335621 2016-02-10 18:35:07 UTC <Jpaull23> @scottzolak deeeezzzz nuts all over these strawberries. Hahahahaha
697045052166684672 2016-02-09 13:11:05 UTC <Jpaull23> @Toucherandrich that's the angry grandpa. He has a YouTube channel it is all an act.
694977847946039296 2016-02-03 20:16:45 UTC <Jpaull23> @BartScott57 great interview on @FelgerAndMazz need to come on more often. Much respect coming from a huge Pats fan.
691709073335676928 2016-01-25 19:47:49 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti I think you should put Fleming in your 3 down for the 1 play he was in on and sucked beyond belief. He had one job!!!
691396606235643905 2016-01-24 23:06:11 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin denvers punting has been a huge part of This game.
691395515523686400 2016-01-24 23:01:51 UTC <Jpaull23> @BenVolin why were hey not in the gun spread out all over the field. Smh. Exploit the safeties.
691377976592764928 2016-01-24 21:52:09 UTC <Jpaull23> @Keefe21 fortunate to be down 8?
691368616466497537 2016-01-24 21:14:57 UTC <Jpaull23> Down 5 and playing this bad
691355346040918017 2016-01-24 20:22:13 UTC <Jpaull23> Get off the field on 3rd down.
690561009237495808 2016-01-22 15:45:49 UTC <Jpaull23> @TonyMassarotti agenda free Fridaypic.twitter.com/g7H5nPg8AC
689902221589397504 2016-01-20 20:08:02 UTC <Jpaull23> @FelgerAndMazz aren't you making the main point. Of course they weren't going to attack the corners. They had no receivers.
