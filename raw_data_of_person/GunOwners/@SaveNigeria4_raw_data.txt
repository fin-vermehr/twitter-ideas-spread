971395033034260480 2018-03-07 14:39:58 UTC <SaveNigeria4> Who is deceiving who...parties in Nigeria? APCs believe PDPs are so corrupt and must not allow in power,and most of APCs were ex-PDP members who dumped the party to have their corruption hidden from public with the adoption of new party. Let's stop being partisan. #savenigeria

Get your voters card #savenigeria
970710321106219008 2018-03-05 17:19:10 UTC <SaveNigeria4> It's something uncommon to Nigeria to appreciate the home made products but an habit for them buy expensive imported ones even if it's not as good as the home made. And you think that's not a big problem? Appreciate your home made and it will be appreciated worldwide.#savenigeria
970613593212440578 2018-03-05 10:54:48 UTC <SaveNigeria4> I do ask myself that when will Nigeria get there when in fact the salaries of all members House of Senate, House of representatives is enough to refurbish Nigeria and still they are given constituency allowance but virtually nothing is done and those we are still complaining
970368024304812032 2018-03-04 18:39:00 UTC <SaveNigeria4> Nigeria becomes the dumping point of refuse from other countries because we sell our creativity unaware to the technological world
970242960863490048 2018-03-04 10:22:02 UTC <SaveNigeria4> The solution to Nigeria problem is not in APC or PDP, it's will be of more good to all Nigerians if they are able to take to the solutions I'm about to give but Nigerians only like to cry out when crayfish but never cry when their pond drying off..... #savenigeria
960980073053675523 2018-02-06 20:54:38 UTC <SaveNigeria4> What is the best thing to give to your lady in this month of love
960781231268028421 2018-02-05 07:44:30 UTC <SaveNigeria4> I wonder why majority of Nigerians blaming PDP for the country's situation forgetting that APC or PDP are just party and to be sincere those who spoiled Nigeria during PDPs regime are mostly in APC now. Who is that PDP and the current APC? Who's deceiving who?
