971428887157755906 2018-03-07 16:54:29 UTC <familynomad> @Eater Every time I see a Waffle House I think of this Jim Gaffigan bit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz1cfwFmv1w
971428060074577920 2018-03-07 16:51:12 UTC <familynomad> Hey dudes ... taking selfies is NOT cool!  Taking selfies in the bathroom??  #WeCantBeFriends
971344937416568832 2018-03-07 11:20:54 UTC <familynomad> Holy crap! Just encountered the rudest employees at an American Airlines check in counter.  I dont care if its early. You put on a smile and treat customers with respect.   #AmericanAirlinesBlows #WillNeverFlyAmericanAgain
971234287386288130 2018-03-06 04:01:13 UTC <familynomad> @PAGMETER Thats good. Having 14 teams in Division 1 is lame! They should look at Texas UIL system. It runs flawless and every sport has a state championship.  You actually have to do well in league to make it to playoffs. No football tournament.
971166053630992386 2018-03-06 23:30:05 UTC <familynomad> @MLSinAustin I think McKalla would be a great location. Close to the Domain, pubs in walking distance, and on the Cap Metro line!
971030600688730112 2018-03-06 14:31:50 UTC <familynomad> @_Kevin_Pham The civil war had more to do with Centralization va Decentralization than race.  It was about the concentration of power in a federal govt vs states right.  Still a fitting analogy in crypto but misses the mark of the true narrative of that conflict.
970999146713841664 2018-03-06 12:26:51 UTC <familynomad> @wrestlingnomad @Z_Dub_5 Wow! Time flys! I thought he had one more year after this.  #AmazingCareer
970860576950931456 2018-03-05 03:16:13 UTC <familynomad> @wrestlingnomad Is he done with college after this year?
969311959186399233 2018-03-01 20:42:34 UTC <familynomad> @CryptoCred Yes!
969050248516657152 2018-02-28 03:22:37 UTC <familynomad> Amen! Time to up their game!https://twitter.com/GrantWahl/status/969044499874942976
968897954827223041 2018-02-28 17:17:28 UTC <familynomad> @_Kevin_Pham Same reason the South couldnt hard fork from the North.  Plus they would have to disconnect from the fed govt teet ... and they like their free milk.
968893655208505344 2018-02-28 17:00:23 UTC <familynomad> @FloWrestling Suriano
968854227194818561 2018-02-28 14:23:42 UTC <familynomad> @PhilakoneCrypto Thanks Phil!
968853977864417283 2018-02-28 14:22:43 UTC <familynomad> @L1AD #TrueStory :-)
968853692727181312 2018-02-28 14:21:35 UTC <familynomad> There are those rare people in life that you can go a decade without seeing and can immediately pick up where you left off. Those relationships that withstand time like that are rare but greatly cherished.
968607350050512896 2018-02-27 22:02:42 UTC <familynomad> @whatbitcoindid Oh know ... Bitcoin is bad because it prevents those in power from controlling the Plebs!   /sarcasm
968607107573518342 2018-02-27 22:01:44 UTC <familynomad> @whatbitcoindid Its frustrating that a large swath of the population will read inane comments from someone like Bill Gates and do ZERO critical thinking.
968586148917346304 2018-02-27 20:38:28 UTC <familynomad> @SacRepublicFC @Nike @SRFC_Bear You wearing that shit every day :-)
968564999735074816 2018-02-27 19:14:25 UTC <familynomad> This is hilarious!  @_Kevin_Pham you crack me up dude!https://twitter.com/_Kevin_Pham/status/968357875918786560
968564683694206976 2018-02-27 19:13:10 UTC <familynomad> @PhilakoneCrypto Lol! Thats funny dude!
968227914687762432 2018-02-26 20:54:58 UTC <familynomad> @FloWrestling @WhoIsJamesG James Green documentary? 
968159912571289601 2018-02-26 16:24:45 UTC <familynomad> We all need money but only enough to pursue other things we enjoy in life.
968159742165045249 2018-02-26 16:24:04 UTC <familynomad> Asking people what do you do? as a conversation starter sucks.  I try to always avoid it and give very intentionally vague answers when asked.   What you do is NOT who a person is. Its just how they have decided to trade some of their time for money.
968142657393369088 2018-02-26 15:16:11 UTC <familynomad> Another favorite quote from the article: You will also notice that given the homework done by journos, the flaws happen to be in the beginning, never at the end.https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/968062573554929664
968142434201780224 2018-02-26 15:15:18 UTC <familynomad> She also makes many, many such mistakes not worth discussing here: doesnt get the minority rule, knows nothing about helicopters; she practically knows nothing.https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/968062573554929664
968139275307966464 2018-02-26 15:02:45 UTC <familynomad> Just walked into a coffee shop for the first time and the young girl taking my order looks hung over and pissed off at the world.  Fake it! Smile!   I see the owner in the back and he needs to know she is destroying his business.
968138640000872448 2018-02-26 15:00:13 UTC <familynomad> Small businesses greatly underestimate how detrimental shitty staff is to their business.  Its simple. If a customer walks up to the counter, make sure they smile and make the customer feel welcome.
968137796698304512 2018-02-26 14:56:52 UTC <familynomad> @whatbitcoindid I like the randomized key code on my trezor plus the ability to use longer than a 4 digit code.  I use both also.
968115659216310272 2018-02-26 13:28:54 UTC <familynomad> Nothing worse than getting a call from an old friend after years of not hearing from them and having them try and pitch their MLM or Sell Insurance to you!  People fall out of touch. Its normal. But dont call me and try to sling your crap at me!  #MLMSucks
967948484740444160 2018-02-25 02:24:37 UTC <familynomad> @spencernoon Interesting.  Never considered that baked in selling pressure!
967948318633467904 2018-02-25 02:23:57 UTC <familynomad> @sfdeltas @SRFC_Bear Cant just trash a good jersey because the team folded :-)
967948088831655936 2018-02-25 02:23:02 UTC <familynomad> @JoshMLowe Question now is how is Poway going to match up at State with Buchanan and Selma?  Poway already beat Buchanan once this year at Reno.
967925460184088576 2018-02-25 00:53:07 UTC <familynomad> Its not just Crypto LinkedIn  the whole platform blows.https://twitter.com/_Kevin_Pham/status/967921358603567104
967907687609479168 2018-02-25 23:42:30 UTC <familynomad> @ZeroHedge1 @Beautyon_ Can Bitcoin go to 1 million (making assumptions but I believe it will) WITHOUT the USD going to zero?
967897168106287104 2018-02-25 23:00:42 UTC <familynomad> @PAGMETER For real! Its the Valley title game  you cant hire Bush League refs for a big game like that.
967819733226565632 2018-02-25 17:53:00 UTC <familynomad> @MLSinSA @scottbaileysabj Mostly Austin is just a cooler city that Precourt is infatuated with.
967573747195621377 2018-02-24 01:35:32 UTC <familynomad> @BuchananEmpire Congrats! Rooting for you guys at State. So glad @FloWrestling is streaming it this year!
967573308513366016 2018-02-24 01:33:48 UTC <familynomad> @lopp People are quick to attempt to force/legislate their morality/beliefs on others but dont have the sense to see the other side of the stick.
967549005122195456 2018-02-24 23:57:13 UTC <familynomad> @nic__carter What is 1984
967540790712029185 2018-02-24 23:24:35 UTC <familynomad> @PAGMETER Sunnyside getting it done!
967540309365227521 2018-02-24 23:22:40 UTC <familynomad> Amen! War on drugs is stupid! We use public money (our money) to create a wildly profitable black market for criminals.https://twitter.com/LibertarianWing/status/967537332021637120
967539895823749121 2018-02-24 23:21:01 UTC <familynomad> Buying things on credit is one thing, you are essentially borrowing money to make a purchase.  But banks should not be censoring how we actually spend our money.  Everyone in power always wants to force their morality on everyone through abuse of power/legislation.https://twitter.com/chamath/status/967443937412567042
967537459650351106 2018-02-24 23:11:21 UTC <familynomad> @nntaleb @TMFStoffel Brian you nailed it with that clip!
967425046259159040 2018-02-24 15:44:39 UTC <familynomad> @m2jr More than 50% you lose a majority control of your production.  Still need to consider that taking ANY percent of your private property without consent means youre not truly free.
967419693274484736 2018-02-24 15:23:23 UTC <familynomad> @saifedean @rhyssaxton602 Punished in what way?  Im with you on all these things. Just trying to understand your position.
967419397026537472 2018-02-24 15:22:12 UTC <familynomad> @whatbitcoindid What role do you see Monero playing alongside Bitcoin long term?  Filling the privacy gap?
967404454008979462 2018-02-24 14:22:49 UTC <familynomad> Most cities in the US have a half assed attempt at public transport.  There are great examples to look to: Madrid, London, Paris.  Are the engineers and public planners here so myopic that they dont study the great public transport systems prior to half baking one here?
967402238820970497 2018-02-24 14:14:01 UTC <familynomad> @pierre_rochard The attempted regulation will come through:  1. Blocking fiat to bitcoin onramps.  2. Criminalizing the possession of bitcoin keys.  RE #2: Its near impossible but they will intimidate citizens into declaration. Not all will be swayed but many will.
967400847553581056 2018-02-24 14:08:30 UTC <familynomad> @leanderhssoccer Nice job coach! We are rooting for yall. You really have that team turned around this year.
967400455813910529 2018-02-24 14:06:56 UTC <familynomad> Crazy to see Clovis sitting in 4th after all of those years of dominance.  They will be back up top soon Im sure.  I have my fingers crossed that the team race at the State Tourney is tight. I think Poway may give Buchanan a run for their money.https://twitter.com/CalGrappler/status/967246033418731520
967228844590747648 2018-02-23 02:45:01 UTC <familynomad> @DHSWSoccer @EvanReam You give some schmoe an ounce of power and they abuse it!  That sucks man!
967228430445174785 2018-02-23 02:43:22 UTC <familynomad> @_BrookeBolinger @TexasSoftball Great win! Yall should be in the top 25 next week after knocking off #20 and limiting Washington to only 2 runs!  Its going to be an exciting year!  #WCWS bound! I can feel it!
967199720685948929 2018-02-23 00:49:17 UTC <familynomad> Im amazed (and turned off) by people that are exposed to a piece of information and immediately take strong positions on that limited information.https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/967190035454943232
967197226559856641 2018-02-23 00:39:23 UTC <familynomad> My son was blessed to have a youth coach that understood.  He didnt care about winning games.   He cared about the boys development.  Im watching boys out here and when they receive a pass they are like a fricken backstop.
967196391696207872 2018-02-23 00:36:04 UTC <familynomad> All you rec coaches out there   Teach the kids how to pass and trap a ball.  Play small sides games.   When they are young the skill development is what matters.
967196054256046080 2018-02-23 00:34:43 UTC <familynomad> Hey dummy if you lose possession after one touch every time you can never score.  Kick and run stopped being OK after about 9 years old.
967195569902030848 2018-02-23 00:32:48 UTC <familynomad> OMG! Listening to my sons high school soccer coach telling the defense to boot it up the field every play makes me sick!  He has no concept of the game.   #soccer #RecBallMentality
