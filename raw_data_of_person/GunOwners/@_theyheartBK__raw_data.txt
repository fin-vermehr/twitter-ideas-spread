It's human nature to relate things to our personal lives when analyzing. She also never said it was the only or most important takeaway of the doc.

925478709074808832 2017-10-31 21:44:53 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @MarcAnthony0107 Retired members have a lot of free time they can give back to the church. Its a very thin line between engaged and burned out young members.

910548468304941057 2017-09-20 16:57:26 UTC <_theyheartBK_> When you listen to a @torikelly run & get chills, rewind and it happens again. Then do it once more to confirm her voice is just that good.

897177314680819712 2017-08-14 19:25:15 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Accepting prayers during this difficult time as I transition from being the most important, to 2nd most important person to @BrideofBruton.
896978436979404801 2017-08-13 06:14:59 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby therapy guinely helps them figure things out. To each their own. But therapy is definitely a valid option.
896978215423459328 2017-08-13 06:14:06 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby and a trustworthy God-fearing therapist is an amazing combination. A lot of people have lived through some really hard things and
896977962058362881 2017-08-13 06:13:05 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby what God is telling us. I just don't think therapy displays a lack of faith in God. If anything prayer, a strong spiritual life,
896977789915725824 2017-08-13 06:12:24 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby Exactly my point! God can use anyone, including therapists to speak to people. Sometimes we need something tangible to help grasp
896976417715630081 2017-08-13 06:06:57 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby Okay i think I see where you're coming from. But what if you talk to God and He tells you to go to therapy? 
896975003345924097 2017-08-13 06:01:20 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby of faith.
896974958789832704 2017-08-13 06:01:09 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby Christian. Is it ok for Christians to see medical doctors? God can fix everything right? Seeking help doesn't always show a lack
896974736978309120 2017-08-13 06:00:16 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby Also there are Christian therapists. Keep that in mind. You imply that there's something wrong with seeking treatment if you're
896974533265158145 2017-08-13 05:59:28 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @GavinBaby Confused by your question. You can be a Christian and seek advice/help from your parents, pastor, or if one desires-a therapist.
896961383874658304 2017-08-13 05:07:13 UTC <_theyheartBK_> So so so so so proud of @gfrizzzle and all she's going to accomplish! You got this boo. GOD IS WITH US.

780806064447033344 2016-09-27 16:27:27 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Like isn't that what A. Burr wanted? Ham to admit it. But I just realized he really knew Ham's character.  #Hamilton @HamiltonMusical
780805872087957504 2016-09-27 16:26:41 UTC <_theyheartBK_> So I always thought it was funny how A. Burr only says "ok" when A. Ham calls him the better lawyer in #Nonstop. #Hamilton @HamiltonMusical

754438661882712064 2016-07-16 22:12:48 UTC <_theyheartBK_> When you stop by the cookout for a plate but then your obligated to stay for at least an hour.
753762754163531776 2016-07-14 01:26:59 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Why isn't @caseysknapp updating her snapchat every 5 mins. Ugh

749613966293405696 2016-07-03 14:41:11 UTC <_theyheartBK_> So APPARENTLY the last line in Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing" is, "it's not good to masturbate." I literally almost choked on my water.
749613652832088064 2016-07-03 14:39:56 UTC <_theyheartBK_> When you've heard a song like 500 times over your lifetime then you catch something you never heard before.

746910552560140297 2016-06-25 03:38:47 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @leslieodomjr for the record it took me 6 tries to get passed Brazil (Aquarela Do Brasil) because how dare you sing in another language. 
746910029182341120 2016-06-25 03:36:42 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Dear @leslieodomjr, how does your voice sound like butter? Not refrigerated butter. Room temperature, left out on the counter butter. HOW?

743288082921725952 2016-06-15 03:44:23 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Impossible to choose a favorite #Hamilton song, but my fave 30 secs is when Angelica pops off during The Reynolds Pamphlet. @Lin_Manuel

742084799800696833 2016-06-12 20:02:58 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Can't stop crying. Honestly didn't realize how hard this would hit me. I just wish I could've said so much more to him.

742032265878867973 2016-06-12 16:34:13 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Tried to watch but I don't think I can. Five mins and I completely lost it. Even though this is clearly real I still can't fathom it.
742012598204436480 2016-06-12 15:16:03 UTC <_theyheartBK_> When it hits you that you're 22 and living on grace and mercy alone. 
741996418685140992 2016-06-12 14:11:46 UTC <_theyheartBK_> My heart is literally aching today. Ugh. How am I gonna get through this shift? 
741996122185596928 2016-06-12 14:10:35 UTC <_theyheartBK_> The day of a friend's funeral is not the day to listen to Seasons of Love on repeat. 
741890778054692864 2016-06-12 07:11:59 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Facts only.https://twitter.com/tipsforyoudaily/status/741846492462350336

741778742910017539 2016-06-11 23:46:48 UTC <_theyheartBK_> "I'm busy." "I've got something else planned." "I can't this time."
741778506485485568 2016-06-11 23:45:52 UTC <_theyheartBK_> For the longest when someone would ask me to do stuff on the Sabbath, depending on the person and how close we were, I'd give vague excuses.
741778216067682308 2016-06-11 23:44:42 UTC <_theyheartBK_> I think I'm reaching a new point in my faith. Only took me bout 8 years but thats ok.

739247850857594880 2016-06-04 00:09:56 UTC <_theyheartBK_> So many things I don't understand in this world. Calculus. Selena Gomez's singing career. How people get tired of Chipotle.
738896756310736896 2016-06-03 00:54:49 UTC <_theyheartBK_> My mom is bringing me doughnuts tomorrow. She's a real one.

737139584027463680 2016-05-29 04:32:26 UTC <_theyheartBK_> These drunk white guys told me I looked like @itsgabrielleu. I know they're drunk & cross racial identification is flawed but still counts.

731275063304040448 2016-05-13 00:08:56 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @netflix would adding a "religious" category be possible? That would be awesome

729481849878237184 2016-05-08 01:23:20 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @SouthwestAir what is the truth? 
729481793515163649 2016-05-08 01:23:07 UTC <_theyheartBK_> @SouthwestAir when I spoke to Melissa in Customer Service on the phone she verified that my boarding pass was confirmed & wouldn't change

728785196112293889 2016-05-06 03:15:05 UTC <_theyheartBK_> And nothing makes me want to stay at home on my couch away from the world more than upsetting people.
728280874148450305 2016-05-05 17:51:05 UTC <_theyheartBK_> But a quick Hallelujah for more evenly distributed parts! Thank you @FifthHarmony management! #FifthHarmony #WriteOnMe

728279986625347584 2016-05-05 17:47:34 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Vocally. @FifthHarmony definitely brought it. But most importantly they didn't oversing it *cough cough @camilacabello97* lol #WriteOnMe
728279652947525632 2016-05-05 17:46:14 UTC <_theyheartBK_> Immediate reactions to #WriteOnMe. Lyrically, it's an improvement for sure. Still extremely repetitive, which is kind of annoying.
