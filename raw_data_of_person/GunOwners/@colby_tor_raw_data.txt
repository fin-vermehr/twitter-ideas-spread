969689156250058752 2018-03-02 21:41:25 UTC <colby_tor> Also super appreciated the fact that male nudity is featured. The disparity between male and female nudity in Hollywood is absolutely ridiculous and Red Sparrow broke that trend, which is nice to see.https://twitter.com/colby_tor/status/969678851272884225
969678851272884225 2018-03-02 21:00:28 UTC <colby_tor> I really enjoyed Red Sparrow. Jennifer Lawrence was great and I never felt like the movie overstayed it's welcome.

968682199632375808 2018-02-27 03:00:08 UTC <colby_tor> This incredibly insightful panel helped illustrate ways to help curb the problem of harrasment in the newsroom. Hopefully, these methods will be widely adopted sometime in the near future.
968681430740959233 2018-02-27 02:57:04 UTC <colby_tor> Sharing harrasment experiences can help identify patterns of sexual harrasment in perpetrators.
968680476134162438 2018-02-27 02:53:17 UTC <colby_tor> Diversity in the newsroom leads to parity in the staff, along with increased revenue, as diversity allows for more groups to be represented in the media.
968679785575542784 2018-02-27 02:50:32 UTC <colby_tor> A diverse leadership team is something hard to achieve due to biases in the hiring process, but can lead to less harrasment overall.
968677426644439040 2018-02-27 02:41:10 UTC <colby_tor> The whole panel agrees that men need to be allies and support victims of harrasment any way they can, through listening, support and reporting incidents they see.
968676015076601856 2018-02-27 02:35:33 UTC <colby_tor> Charlie Rose's Cronkite Award being taken away was largely done to send a message to students that behavior such as his is not ok.
968674657153904640 2018-02-27 02:30:10 UTC <colby_tor> Bodney says young people in the industry need mentors and safe spaces to talk about any discrimination they might face.
968673532774293504 2018-02-27 02:25:41 UTC <colby_tor> @SarahSpain decided to take a stand as being a woman in sports media to pave the way for the ones who will come after her, rather than being "one of the guys."

968669707191533569 2018-02-27 02:10:29 UTC <colby_tor> .@publishorperish says harrasment happens so often it becomes almost routine.

968668233573154816 2018-02-27 02:04:38 UTC <colby_tor> .@bodspeak says that all individuals are considered a protected class, none of whom should be targeted with harrasment of any kind.

954082348227690496 2018-01-18 20:05:32 UTC <colby_tor> Live tweeting is another great tool in journalism! The tactic can be used to quickly cover important points of an event, which can later be formatted into a fuller, more thought out story. It also allows followers to get quick updates on the event too!
