(The Rock would likely run as an independent but oh well) Also, Hillary isn't an option because I kind of hope she won't run because I'm not confident that she'd beat Trump in the General Election.

943653530967126017 2017-12-20 01:25:08 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> As I expected, Floyd beat Conor. But Conor did the brave thing of stepping into a different sport that his opponent has mastered. Floyd wont do the same thing because Conor has mastered a more brutal, difficult combat sport.

They still have a lot of prospects to offer TB.
943541843941314562 2017-12-20 18:01:20 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> PLEASE do a rematch with Conor, in the octagon. Then they can both have a win in their own sport.https://twitter.com/bleacherreport/status/943515626483671040

937868825458069506 2017-12-04 02:18:47 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @BleacherReport @Joe11Bro Yes but he fouls him every time, so it doesnt really matter.
937805591531139077 2017-12-04 22:07:31 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> This bitch defends monuments representing racist people who committed treason like Robert E. Lee but has no problem taking away Native American monuments. Fuck You @realDonaldTrumphttps://twitter.com/bbcworld/status/937783016088330245
937804887622148096 2017-12-04 22:04:43 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @AP He was Trumps campaign chairman
937750529505153025 2017-12-04 18:28:43 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @jasonjwilde @ESPNMilwaukee Yes but he keeps our defense off the field longer so they give up less points
937538251782545408 2017-12-03 04:25:12 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Russell Wilson for MVP
937534739334025216 2017-12-03 04:11:15 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @JHigbee21 Yeah and they were all false
937534030492454912 2017-12-03 04:08:26 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Russell Wilson sucks, right @JHigbee21?
937531223248863232 2017-12-03 03:57:16 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Carson Wentz and Russell Wilson are so fun to watch. This game is awesome. #SNF
937521185155420161 2017-12-03 03:17:23 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Update: Gordon got me 10.5 and Im gonna win this week by at least 20 (depending on how much more Wilson gets tonight) so I think that means I can start Gordon every weekhttps://twitter.com/nilesmaniaxix/status/937316202325729281

937518935255212032 2017-12-03 03:08:27 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @thenilesriver Although I guess Cubs are still an option, but he seems to want to play for a west coast team because every other team on his list is on the west coast other than Texas
937518701640847361 2017-12-03 03:07:31 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @thenilesriver Just happy it wont be the Yankees or Cubs

937472826470227969 2017-12-03 00:05:13 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Its a miracle that Josh Gordon got me 10.5 Fantasy points with Kizer as his QB. He may be the worst starting QB of all time.
937461992478138369 2017-12-03 23:22:10 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Watching DeShone Kizer play football hurts me physically, even more than watching Brett Hundley play football
937316202325729281 2017-12-03 13:42:51 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> Im 2-10 in fantasy football so I decided to start Josh Gordon in his return game over Emmanuel Sanders at the flex because why the hell not?
937311584967364608 2017-12-03 13:24:30 UTC <NilesManiaXIX> @MarioHTXX The most unrealistic part is that Eddie Lacy broke out for that big of a run. That never happens anymore.
