968875577800146945 2018-02-28 15:48:33 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot It's only reasonable. I expected this but bought all the stuff once the game came out. Dont get why people are complaining. The older a game gets the cheaper it gets and that's for all games. Why are people surprised?
968605600698441728 2018-02-27 21:55:45 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TmarTn Injustice 2
967085509653626880 2018-02-23 17:15:27 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot Bloodline or Stranger Things. It a tie for me

965817709198942208 2018-02-19 05:17:40 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TmarTn @Gamer_votes I liked it but I don't think it is like people make it out too be.
965811374063366144 2018-02-19 04:52:30 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TmarTn Really overrated. Probably the most overrated movie I've ever seen
965462068739502080 2018-02-18 05:44:29 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @MarvelStudios @DrRondreaMathis No it's not I wouldn't pay to see it again
965415079612104705 2018-02-18 02:37:46 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @noobde Extremely overrated
963641754338676738 2018-02-13 05:11:12 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @noobde Cheetah premiere skin?
963287466424786944 2018-02-12 05:43:23 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TmarTn do you think you'll make a vid on TMNT in injustice? I would love that
958524055069470720 2018-01-30 02:15:17 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot The game is still fun. People complain too much
957473878929940480 2018-01-27 04:42:16 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TmarTn Injustice 2 
957418006530768896 2018-01-27 01:00:15 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @sonny1999 Canoga Park but it's back up
957415694068428801 2018-01-27 00:51:04 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @sonny1999 Same for me and my grandparents
955505374852890625 2018-01-22 18:20:08 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @TeosGame Logan Lucky and It
954545049114521600 2018-01-19 02:44:08 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @OGXRAYZ @TmarTn Like eververse from destiny 2. But it still gets tons of hate
949827375977476096 2018-01-06 02:17:48 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @NobodyEpic IT is amazing. Its long but as you keep reading, you don't even notice it's so intense. 11/22/63 Is also really intense and well written
945090045727227904 2017-12-24 00:33:20 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @Alleyisafatty Nope wrapped by Dez and the other Dallas players for causing penalties
942561037634617344 2017-12-17 01:03:57 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @JoeManganiello No he didn't. He did not pass the line when he made impact with the ground. When he did make impact the ball was loose. It's a dead ball then.
938473808557568000 2017-12-06 18:22:46 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot But... I like loot boxes
938262609811214336 2017-12-05 04:23:32 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @nKuchGaming I really can care less. Just more stuff to grind for.
937439761051947008 2017-12-03 21:53:50 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @IGN That was his reaction when he saw himself fighting Kylo in the Force Awakens trailer
937356498887307264 2017-12-03 16:22:59 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot What is this from
934478226025472001 2017-11-25 17:45:45 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot Yes. The game is overall very fun, can't stop playing it

931370307432071168 2017-11-16 03:55:59 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @nKuchGaming Yes. Let's just all bitch about stuff we don't like
931199251987566592 2017-11-16 16:36:17 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot The game is amazing. People complain too much
931047210245951488 2017-11-15 06:32:07 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot @joshua_sersich I understand the supply drops a little but not really why so many people are complaining so much about the heroes. It's like R6. For a new operator it is 25,000 renown but season pass holders get it free. I know the grind but do not really see a problem. Just a challenge.
931002100468744193 2017-11-15 03:32:52 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @gamespot Oh No, we have to put time in a game to get things we want? How hoooooorible.

912042922547089408 2017-09-24 19:55:52 UTC <TheBOOMer4700> @Seahawks @seahawksPR So disrespectful to people who have given their lives for the country. I get you want to protest but why protest to the national anthem
