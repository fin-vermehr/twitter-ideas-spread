964960067199094784 2018-02-17 20:29:42 UTC <carrienovalany> Respect. That is what the average American is looking for from their leaders, from the media, you name it. I dont think I share her politics, but its not about ideology. Its about confidence in the future and respect towards each other. She provides both.https://twitter.com/oprah/status/964955464281698304

963445346536951808 2018-02-13 16:10:45 UTC <carrienovalany> That @MeghanMcCain hangs in there and continues to fight the good fight is remarkable. Four against one daily, exhausting to watch, feel for her having to deal with it. #TheView

952980539602022401 2018-01-15 19:07:20 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS #EverybodyTalks yes, the older women get, the less we are valued. Once you hit 30! you suddenly hear for your age. In film Im tired of seeing 70 year old men with 25-35 year old women. I loved seeing Redford and Fonda together in Our Souls at Night.
952973951524921344 2018-01-15 18:41:10 UTC <carrienovalany> @WendyWilliams I think everyone needs to back off Mark Wahlberg. How about going after the agency they share or the people on the other end making the payment. I doubt he knew Michelle hadnt negotiated her own deal. I dont see how its his problem.

Was he complicit somehow? Just curious. It should be the fault of the people paying not receiving. No time to Google.

866887723583508480 2017-05-22 05:25:13 UTC <carrienovalany> @ABFalecbaldwin Shhhh, can you hear that? E.F. Hutton just welcomed his daughter home.
866875650950483968 2017-05-22 04:37:15 UTC <carrienovalany> @joepabike @tbonier And the elderly, and the disabled.
865771309510389761 2017-05-19 03:29:00 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez Do you want to explain, or should I guess?
865414929133707266 2017-05-18 03:52:52 UTC <carrienovalany> @iownjd I don't believe in soulmates.
865282324719652865 2017-05-18 19:05:57 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZLive That being said, what a tragedy. Such a talent. My sympathies to his family.
865281917998026753 2017-05-18 19:04:20 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZLive it sounds exactly like what someone would say if they knew they weren't playing another show. Also, once they make up their mind...
865280454332739585 2017-05-18 18:58:31 UTC <carrienovalany> @girlbossnetflix I loved it.
865277881982885888 2017-05-18 18:48:17 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS I think my husband is not fashion forward and I thank God for that right now.
865277499109933056 2017-05-18 18:46:46 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS what a delightful woman. I smiled through the whole Diane Lane interview.
864576129566375937 2017-05-16 20:19:46 UTC <carrienovalany> @LoriJulia sorry. @JaredLeto is the face of @gucci And he is without a doubt a triple threat.
864192128800391168 2017-05-15 18:53:54 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS #EverybodyTalks why not discuss surgical and cosmetic options?

862372011938545666 2017-05-10 18:21:24 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS #EverybodyTalks I always assume if a celebrity is talking about a product they're getting paid! They do nothing for free.

857295063386378241 2017-04-26 18:07:25 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS I say go for it. It will be much more objective w/o her input. Not more interesting and probably not as raw but.....
856923881759748096 2017-04-25 17:32:28 UTC <carrienovalany> Get rid of Stahl character and move the storyline along faster. Good show but I'm growing bored. Needs a shot of adrenaline. #shadesofblue

797963976357183489 2016-11-13 00:46:52 UTC <carrienovalany> @iownjd a lot of time with grandson, always a plus. And an evening out with family.
797886758608371713 2016-11-13 19:40:01 UTC <carrienovalany> Not ignorant to the fact that woman are #abused. But I've seen the other side of it. #Men #falsely accused so the wife can rob them of kids.
797634865327808512 2016-11-12 02:59:05 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez what? What? What? I told you, you can't do this to me!

796814206922276864 2016-11-10 20:38:05 UTC <carrienovalany> Angelina Jolie is like every control freak woman. Moving on wants no ties to ex. Sorry Momma they have a father too! #kids deserve 2 parents
796793957799919618 2016-11-10 19:17:37 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS I hope Brad Pitt takes this opportunity to be a voice for all men who are falsely #accused of abuse. IMO often legal maneuver.

782093382088691712 2016-09-30 05:42:47 UTC <carrienovalany> Why can't my son's ex leave us alone? She blew up my granddaughters world to be with another man yet spent the past year focused on us! #WTF
781944900048658432 2016-09-30 19:52:46 UTC <carrienovalany> @bradleytraynor @mytalkcolleen we're like monkeys, the buzz you get when coloring out of lines is a deterrent for crazy!
781593385219993600 2016-09-29 20:35:58 UTC <carrienovalany> @LoriJulia kids keep you young. That being said, at 50, no freaking way!
781584165296799744 2016-09-29 19:59:20 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez can't tell you how many times I've done that. Hope you're still home.
781571873733607424 2016-09-29 19:10:30 UTC <carrienovalany> @bradleytraynor what's the age break on young gay vs. old gay?
781563896242941952 2016-09-29 18:38:48 UTC <carrienovalany> @bradleytraynor @mytalkcolleen I'm with Colleen. I have 10 acres and I still don't want them doing their business in my front lawn.
781281395469537280 2016-09-28 23:56:14 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZ @hellnahcuh_ he's a menace. Battery or possibly assault. He has no business grabbing anyone.
781208932731658240 2016-09-28 19:08:18 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZ he needs to be put behind bars. These attacks are no joke. Shows how easily a person could be harmed.
781208161810128900 2016-09-28 19:05:14 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZ smart move on BP's part. Show no substance abuse problems.

779402175101349888 2016-09-23 19:28:53 UTC <carrienovalany> All this criticism of @GiGiHadid defending herself from an attacker (prankster BS). Be singing a different song if he intended harm! Go Gigi
779386252684464128 2016-09-23 18:25:37 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS no way. Make an appointment. The idea is great, but they have bigger fish to fry.

775821934097334272 2016-09-13 22:22:17 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS when the story broke I chalked it up to juvenile shenanigans. When I found out his age, sorry, no pass! He deserves the fallout.
775821371754487808 2016-09-13 22:20:03 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez I hear you little missy.
775383088415125505 2016-09-12 17:18:28 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS should not be public. There are procedures in place in the event a President cannot carry out the responsibilities of the job.

761684825375997952 2016-08-05 22:06:28 UTC <carrienovalany> @LoriJulia The Fall was so popular that when it finished up its two seasons they decided to bring it back for two more. It had ended.
761682810142912512 2016-08-05 21:58:27 UTC <carrienovalany> @LoriJulia the reason Billy Crudup can pick and choose his roles is that he makes so much money from voice overs.

758868156123258880 2016-07-28 03:34:02 UTC <carrienovalany> After the conventions my mind's made up. Voting for @HillaryClinton.
758867632070139905 2016-07-28 03:31:57 UTC <carrienovalany> @HillaryClinton powerful speech. Hope the steadfast Republicans I know were open-minded enough to watch. Blew apart Trump's empty promises.

755842675459272705 2016-07-20 19:11:51 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS free speech. There is a block option on Twitter. I'm no celebrity and I've had to block people. Easy peasy.
755841653772988420 2016-07-20 19:07:47 UTC <carrienovalany> @SHO_Roadies I read Eddie Vedder is going to appear on the season finale! I hope it's not just a rumor.
755477952981143552 2016-07-19 19:02:34 UTC <carrienovalany> @bradleytraynor actually brilliant on all their parts. Flipped the public perception of good girl/bad boy. Eventually gets boring.
755473461917519872 2016-07-19 18:44:43 UTC <carrienovalany> @bradleytraynor there is a public TS and a private TS, same with KW and KK. Churn that money machine.

753929260226805760 2016-07-15 12:28:37 UTC <carrienovalany> @VZWSupport 7 years. I think he got fed up with reporting. He'd be calling all day every day & no resolution. I'm in 55013. Service is okay.
753917021121814528 2016-07-15 11:39:59 UTC <carrienovalany> @VZWSupport 5 miles. He's lived here for 7 years. Our lives have been a nonstop series of disconnects. Infuriating.
753910930816327680 2016-07-15 11:15:47 UTC <carrienovalany> @VZWSupport day one, this is a family members residence. His service has always been horrible. I have 1x anytime I'm here. The worst.
753907122165788672 2016-07-15 11:00:39 UTC <carrienovalany> @VerizonSupport the service in 55074 is the worst in the state. A refund to every resident in this zip wouldn't be payback enough!!!
753702653054464001 2016-07-14 21:28:10 UTC <carrienovalany> @LoriJulia I knew that all of my life as well Julia. For some reason my mom made sure all of us girls knew it. About the shirt buttons.

748206530676199424 2016-06-29 17:28:32 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS the Zuckerberg Wall is part eyesore and part offensive because it takes away from what Kauai is all about.

733464398765793280 2016-05-19 01:08:34 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS leave it. I'm so fed up with all this bogus BS. There are far more important things to focus on.

731195039682977794 2016-05-13 18:50:57 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS no one likes aging. Getting older yes. There is a difference.
730956862439325698 2016-05-12 03:04:31 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez why?
730916077807357952 2016-05-12 00:22:27 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS nope.
730914586585505792 2016-05-12 00:16:31 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS not a clock watcher!
730771519979184129 2016-05-12 14:48:02 UTC <carrienovalany> @TerriIrwin @BindiIrwin @russellcrowe what a lovely young lady.
730769065518596096 2016-05-12 14:38:16 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez cuz you're a regular.
730461016593571841 2016-05-11 18:14:12 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS @KellyRipa was back stabbed. They went behind her back for a reason. She should have been in the loop. Lack of respect for her.
730459377979686913 2016-05-11 18:07:41 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheTalkCBS @justinbieber just asked for exactly what we've all applauded @MrsSOsbourne for. Taking charge of his life.
730299949276090368 2016-05-11 07:34:10 UTC <carrienovalany> Flawless, gut wrenching performances by Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander in #thedanishgirl
730100626642731008 2016-05-10 18:22:08 UTC <carrienovalany> @MrsSOsbourne you have the means to do whatever you choose. Take your time. Dig deep. Many women have no options. $, age, no one to turn to.
729843729444438018 2016-05-09 01:21:19 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez it's what I love about him and granddaddy.
729159208348712960 2016-05-07 04:01:17 UTC <carrienovalany> I watch 3:10 to Yuma everytime it's on. Great flick. Two of my all-time favorites @russellcrowe and Christian Bale. Wonder how they got on?
728680949978783744 2016-05-06 20:20:51 UTC <carrienovalany> Everyone's out enjoying this fabulous 90 Minnesota day! #whatareyouwaitingfor
728390561430802434 2016-05-05 01:06:57 UTC <carrienovalany> Janet Jackson pregnant at 49? Why the fuss? My grandmother had a healthy baby at 47 and without all the medical magic they have now!
727924463908458496 2016-05-04 18:14:51 UTC <carrienovalany> #EverybodyTalks he deserves $100k, chump change. I'm not litigious, but both these celebrities were out of line. Hit them where it hurts.
727923357933428737 2016-05-04 18:10:27 UTC <carrienovalany> #EverybodyTalks it was most definitely by @50cent an attempt to insult. I call BS. Celebrities sue all the time for much less! Sue his ass.
727915282950328320 2016-05-04 17:38:22 UTC <carrienovalany> When you make the most incredible salad and find out that you're all out of your olive oils! #disappointed

726508684847644672 2016-04-30 20:29:03 UTC <carrienovalany> @SHO_Penny Frankenstein. So superficial. Only cares about his looks.
726113926920818688 2016-04-29 18:20:25 UTC <carrienovalany> #EverybodyTalks an empty or frivolous schedule is anxiety provoking. I feel I have more to offer. Plan to reinvent my life for my 3rd act.
725518190416039938 2016-04-27 02:53:10 UTC <carrienovalany> @Bethenny she would not hold my interest on radio.
725403143417286658 2016-04-27 19:16:01 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez fine! I'll stop.
725402621150826497 2016-04-27 19:13:56 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez 139.6 is just what her butt weighs.
725401659581423616 2016-04-27 19:10:07 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez yeah with someone else standing on it.
725385295550500864 2016-04-27 18:05:06 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez don't believe everything you read.

723541490224353280 2016-04-22 15:58:28 UTC <carrienovalany> @StealJustOneDay you painted the perfect pic in my head.
723537300844498944 2016-04-22 15:41:49 UTC <carrienovalany> @TheView Mean, rude and nasty attitudes are handed out at the door of @theview and @ravensymone and @JoyVBehar got everyone's share!
723329400037597184 2016-04-21 01:55:42 UTC <carrienovalany> My hope is that the attendees honoring @prince @FirstAvenue keep it peaceful.
723293833513951233 2016-04-21 23:34:22 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez poor sheltered souls.
723293676646981632 2016-04-21 23:33:45 UTC <carrienovalany> @TMZ quit twisting the "save your prayers". He said it in such a way to reassure everyone he was OK. Not as if he'd be gone soon! #Prince
723267797933940736 2016-04-21 21:50:55 UTC <carrienovalany> Minneapolis has gone purple. The Stadium, the bridge, businesses. We will be glowing purple tonight. #Prince
723224066543349760 2016-04-21 18:57:08 UTC <carrienovalany> Had 4 hours of sleep last night. I just hit my wall. Damn I wish I was still at that age where you could push through. #nothappening
723191127445106688 2016-04-21 16:46:15 UTC <carrienovalany> A death at Paisley Park and MN news channels are rushing to make the connection between Prince having the flu last week and this incident.
723190544063582208 2016-04-21 16:43:56 UTC <carrienovalany> @WCCO way to jump the gun.
723188532601184257 2016-04-21 16:35:57 UTC <carrienovalany> @teamhalez vitamin deficiency?
722831658240516096 2016-04-20 16:57:51 UTC <carrienovalany> Because I always hated to be reminded I'm reluctant to do the same.
722574266982473728 2016-04-19 23:55:04 UTC <carrienovalany> A deer and two cats sizing each other up in my front yard. Of all things, the cats took off before I could snap a pic.
722450009233301504 2016-04-19 15:41:19 UTC <carrienovalany> The smell and feel of the air bombarding me with memories of California before the sun would burn through the haze.
722447251390341121 2016-04-19 15:30:21 UTC <carrienovalany> Agree with @TheView @WhoopiGoldberg yeah, you read that right. People most often are doing the best they can. They don't need to be shamed.
