918521408057217024 2017-10-12 16:59:03 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress If we bring back Frazier itll be for his veteran presence and to DH or play 3rd so players can rest .
918512282153431040 2017-10-12 16:22:47 UTC <ALL__RISE> @tregp @koioioing @suannelqr You didnt say  I think it would be just as terrible you you said it would be just as terrible in different ways
918511975193292800 2017-10-12 16:21:34 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress Yes exactly so why rush up a extremely young talented prospect when we are still a contender ? Lol
918511843278237696 2017-10-12 16:21:03 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress That would be fine by me i just dont want him called up at the beginning . We have to  see how Castro plays next year .
918511222189973504 2017-10-12 16:18:35 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress and if they resign Frazier what are you going to say then ? 
918511030317273089 2017-10-12 16:17:49 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress Amusing when someone who either doesn't follow or understand the Yankees accuses someone else of being stupid
918510894551916544 2017-10-12 16:17:17 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress How so? Because I think we will resign Frazier and let Torres develop more ? He just had a big injury and hes only 20 bro
918510728084115456 2017-10-12 16:16:37 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress Aaron Judge or Gary Sanchez or Sevy? Lol Yankees usually are more careful but we will know when Frazier is either let go or resigned 
918510317663121408 2017-10-12 16:14:59 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress We legit just discussed that in a different thread ...

918509776732082176 2017-10-12 16:12:50 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch They will sign Frazier just because of how he fits with the team bruh lol I said before it wont be because of his hitting ...
918509608448217088 2017-10-12 16:12:10 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress Ok? Lol that doesnt change my opinion on this bruh . Everyone sayin andujar and wade will be in the mlb . We arent going to have 7 IF 
918509395864104961 2017-10-12 16:11:19 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch IMO they bring back Frazier and maybe call Torres up I guess to sit on the bench and play whenever Frazier or headley is resting .
918508690252206081 2017-10-12 16:08:31 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch @JSheratLFPress Yeah I dont understand or follow because I have a different opinion thats some good logic 
918508050578853888 2017-10-12 16:05:58 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch They also andujar and wade will be in the mlb in 2018 how will all of them fit in? Lol
918507899911131138 2017-10-12 16:05:23 UTC <ALL__RISE> @Buster_ESPN @PMKirsch Did I say I was a pro scout ? Are you a pro scout ? We have headley, Frazier, toe , hard to see headley riding the bench making $13 mill
