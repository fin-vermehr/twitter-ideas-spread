910226828698296320 2017-09-19 19:39:21 UTC <Bush_Modo> @NT_Dhlomo Too much interference by politicians of late. Investors don't like that
910067443674034176 2017-09-19 09:06:01 UTC <Bush_Modo> Focus as much of your energy on things that stimulate your mind, spirit, senses, emotions, body. If they don't, you don't belong there!
909824358046150656 2017-09-18 17:00:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> Despite RMB report, I believe SA is still number one investment destination in Africa by far. However, investors must think the same
909817677979508736 2017-09-18 16:33:32 UTC <Bush_Modo> @NT_Dhlomo Bro! 
909756070280744960 2017-09-18 12:28:44 UTC <Bush_Modo> Looks are often deceiving; seek to understand the core of a thing

908402579524202496 2017-09-14 18:50:26 UTC <Bush_Modo> @SizweDhlomo It will be tricky after Buffett. Thousands of investors hold shares just to hear him speak at the annual meeting
908400246866288640 2017-09-14 18:41:10 UTC <Bush_Modo> @AdvDali_Mpofu @GTalevi Ah I see now. Context Giulietta. Don't think he believes capitalism is theft but rather that those who capitalised on apartheid are thieves
908398685591044096 2017-09-14 18:34:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> @AdvDali_Mpofu @GTalevi What did the Advocate do/say?
908397885561208833 2017-09-14 18:31:47 UTC <Bush_Modo> @NT_Dhlomo Yep. Also telling of vulnerability of financial services sector in SA and I'm sure elsewhere in the world
908382546156810240 2017-09-14 17:30:50 UTC <Bush_Modo> Absolutely incredible to think that Capitec, in existence since '01 only, now has more customers than FNB, Absa and Nedbank. Amazing
908342738197905408 2017-09-14 14:52:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> My dreams scare me. What a beautiful feeling
908324095355494400 2017-09-14 13:38:34 UTC <Bush_Modo> Truly upsets me that politics taints good work of state organisations like the PIC and astute executives like Dan Matjila

900660232476655616 2017-08-24 10:05:07 UTC <Bush_Modo> Had a scary thought lastnight; would I be who I am today if Mandela was not released 2 months after I was born? Who would I be?
900084235960279040 2017-08-22 19:56:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> Job creation is the result of a bigger conversation... How do we compete globally? How much do we invest? It doesn't happen artificially
900082264901550084 2017-08-22 19:48:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> Developing markets shoot themselves in the foot when they don't participate in the progressive conversations the developed market is having
900081705247277058 2017-08-22 19:46:15 UTC <Bush_Modo> The new generation of business and political leaders in SA should focus on one main area; SA's global competitiveness

898597845988773890 2017-08-18 17:29:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> If you are being led and are uncertain of what the vision is, you are being misled
898597485769367552 2017-08-18 17:28:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> Vision breeds longevity: If you are leader the vision must be crystal clear or you are misleading...

897448672232849408 2017-08-15 13:23:31 UTC <Bush_Modo> Sometimes even great entrepreneurs run bad businesses
897085158154788864 2017-08-14 13:19:03 UTC <Bush_Modo> "Value add". Such a loose term

896822469411184640 2017-08-13 19:55:13 UTC <Bush_Modo> Racism is a waste of everyone's time and emotions. What a poor poor mentality you must have to hate another race
895325038068420608 2017-08-09 16:44:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> Just realised Tasha's Flamingo Room is heavily inspired by Le Sirenuse. Very good taste

889832627573862401 2017-07-25 13:00:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> All the above are what ensure the sustainability of a business. With close inspection, only a handful of SA companies are
889831710254407682 2017-07-25 12:56:26 UTC <Bush_Modo> However; innovation is very slow in SA, development of new business leaders is poor, and support of small businesses is not nearly enough
889830820126568448 2017-07-25 12:52:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> For instance, Corporate SA is very profitable, which is great for shareholders...
889826824146038785 2017-07-25 12:37:01 UTC <Bush_Modo> We emphasise poor political leadership (as we should) but not enough is said about how poor business leadership is in South Africa
889825322425888768 2017-07-25 12:31:03 UTC <Bush_Modo> Passionate from miles away, passive with the the things you say, passing up on my old ways... I can't blame you, no

877185261641322496 2017-06-20 15:23:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Fair enough. Unfortunately robo-advise is almost non-existent here. There is massive opportunity, however
877180998932459521 2017-06-20 15:07:02 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Would rather email; it's about the African market. Can PM if you prefer, would need you to follow me though

875336860037459968 2017-06-15 12:59:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi If 'radically liberalising...' means the same thing to both of us then, roughly, I think we are. You too
875334953587933184 2017-06-15 12:51:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi To answer you, I think both where former is a consequence of the latter
875330414289858560 2017-06-15 12:33:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> Let's leave it there for now. Have a good onehttps://twitter.com/GTalevi/status/875328922703077377
875328447551336448 2017-06-15 12:25:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> Answer my last question then you are dismissed https://twitter.com/GTalevi/status/875327259883819008
875327970377904128 2017-06-15 12:23:45 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Sure. We also can't negate that there will be those who don't want to understand. Do you understand RET?
875326482956124160 2017-06-15 12:17:50 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Not when there's consensus. Not when we all understand why radical economic transformation is imperative for SA's development
875325200442773505 2017-06-15 12:12:45 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi It's problematic when there isn't prescription
875324489948680200 2017-06-15 12:09:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Well there you go. Incentives don't work. Comfortable for a few, very uncomfortable for many
875322144338706433 2017-06-15 12:00:36 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi BEE is essentially an incentive...
875321458360291328 2017-06-15 11:57:53 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Yes, it's an option
875319126360719360 2017-06-15 11:48:37 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi You're smart, I don't have to tell you this. I just wonder why you don't see it. Transformotion does not equal corruption
875318360443170816 2017-06-15 11:45:34 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi But transformation must happen. Without it, capital will run away sooner or later anyway. With it, capital will run now, and come back later
875315921174376449 2017-06-15 11:35:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi I think the point being made is that a radial approach is required to garner required results
875315625735970816 2017-06-15 11:34:42 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi All these approaches exist in current charter. Not exactly and not to the extent of your suggestions, but they exist in some shape or form
875310130635710464 2017-06-15 11:12:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Just out of interest, do you have a suggestion on how transformation should be approached?

865135242428002305 2017-05-18 09:21:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> It's getting very close to the point where investors will be empowered to "co-pilot" their investment journey with a professional
865134480436195328 2017-05-18 09:18:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> The view is only specialised investments require specialist advice. Most SA'n investors pay too much (+/- 3% p.a) for their investments

864405441438261252 2017-05-16 09:01:31 UTC <Bush_Modo> Digitisation of wealth and investment management means lower fees and higher compounded returns for investors. SA needs to catch up
862993175195070464 2017-05-12 11:29:41 UTC <Bush_Modo> Last RT says it all

862595108322951168 2017-05-11 09:07:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> @Lex_Hoza You're right, but please don't miss the point
862594923190599681 2017-05-11 09:07:10 UTC <Bush_Modo> @JrManqoba You're right, it is, but my point is it is a MAJOR issue here at home where our girlfriends, wives, mothers, aunts, sisters, friends live
862591985688989696 2017-05-11 08:55:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> That, unfortunately, makes us part of the problem
862591770990977024 2017-05-11 08:54:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> We've all been in situations where someone says something scary and/or uncomfortable about a woman and ignored it
862590873384759296 2017-05-11 08:51:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> I'm not sure how to fix the issue but I think it begins by talking about it as South African men
862590625417494529 2017-05-11 08:50:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> There's a MAJOR issue in SA with regards to the treatment of women...

762655018424164354 2016-08-08 14:21:40 UTC <Bush_Modo> Very good. I think it's area dependent. But even if the coverage isn't great you can roam to another network @pearl_makhunga

761469116817498112 2016-08-05 07:49:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> The reality is, that opportunity has not reached tens of millions of our brothers and sisters. Here's a chance to do better
761467800061878272 2016-08-05 07:44:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> My thoughts; The ANC has created many opportunities and all of us on social media are beneficiaries or have access to that opportunity
761466748927369216 2016-08-05 07:39:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> Well done Gumbs @mbalimcdust @HlangananiGumbi

761208007971790848 2016-08-04 14:31:46 UTC <Bush_Modo> You have more than you realise to get what you want

760856888925949953 2016-08-03 15:16:33 UTC <Bush_Modo> For me, of the albums you mentioned, only MBDTF comes close. Watch The Throne is in a league of its own @JrManqoba
760856288632958976 2016-08-03 15:14:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> ...black luxe, King type raps all in one album. To top it all of, never-heard-before out-of-this-world production @JrManqoba
760855532353777668 2016-08-03 15:11:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> I disagree mate. Yeah they had fun, but it was layered; those were thought-provoking, introspective, black-conscious... @JrManqoba
760714346368491520 2016-08-02 05:50:08 UTC <Bush_Modo> You think? It's subjective of course, but what do you think was better than that album in the past decade? @JrManqoba
760566878469230592 2016-08-02 20:04:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> Watch The Throne is possibly the most complete hip hop album of the past decade, dare I say ever

710469822484779008 2016-03-17 14:16:20 UTC <Bush_Modo> JHB this weekend sounds like a plan
709734113264144384 2016-03-15 13:32:53 UTC <Bush_Modo> "Before he speak his suit bespoke"
709733507753517057 2016-03-15 13:30:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> I need to get a super fresh tux tailored
709731090513207296 2016-03-15 13:20:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> The thing about opportunity is; it always avails itself to those who are seeking it

706721641485737984 2016-03-06 06:02:24 UTC <Bush_Modo> If you're not talking about love, faith, vision, growth, opportunity with those closest to you... then maybe you're lying to each other
706480341280808961 2016-03-06 14:03:33 UTC <Bush_Modo> Everyday I grow prouder of the man I've groomed you to become. Hahaha @NT_Dhlomo
706479780078723072 2016-03-06 14:01:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> If you don't have baked cheese cake on your menu then what the hell?
706079215322578944 2016-03-05 11:29:37 UTC <Bush_Modo> I love the smell of opportunity!
706040265501450240 2016-03-05 08:54:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> Quality, absolutely nothing beats quality
705837606756601856 2016-03-04 19:29:33 UTC <Bush_Modo> 14 on Chartwell is real life Cougar Town
705665544947703808 2016-03-04 08:05:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> Who's down for a round of tennis tomorrow morning, 7am - 9am, La Lucia Mall courts?

704696306023927808 2016-03-01 15:54:26 UTC <Bush_Modo> Someone's gotta address the pothole epidemic in the north of Durban
704656771101696000 2016-03-01 13:17:20 UTC <Bush_Modo> True, it's usually those that don't actually value your service @pearl_makhunga
704655407105622016 2016-03-01 13:11:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> You have to step back and allow your mind to view things from a top-down/bird's eye view perspective, often...
704591168626167812 2016-03-01 08:56:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> Aaaah 6 no 9 boy, lol @NT_Dhlomo

703590419762966528 2016-02-27 14:40:02 UTC <Bush_Modo> I still don't get how the lead dude in Billions got this role. I don't believe him
703554773308608512 2016-02-27 12:18:24 UTC <Bush_Modo> LOL! @DidiDoBedda
703546067762151425 2016-02-27 11:43:48 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahaha @NT_Dhlomo @Tokyo_Trev
703545854527991808 2016-02-27 11:42:57 UTC <Bush_Modo> Coldplay gave us some of the dopest music of our time
703545468438114304 2016-02-27 11:41:25 UTC <Bush_Modo> Women are really more intelligent than we are, just observe
703313076385349632 2016-02-26 20:17:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> HOC is actually shocking, this oke just told me an hour later he forgot to order my grub
703210481734062084 2016-02-26 13:30:18 UTC <Bush_Modo> Still not receiving an OTP when making a payment online.... ? @askSBSA
702798590549299200 2016-02-25 10:13:36 UTC <Bush_Modo> Play your game and live on your terms. It's effortless... You'll struggle doing the opposite
702184180772425729 2016-02-23 17:32:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> This full moon is amazing!
702152568655446016 2016-02-23 15:26:32 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hi Mandla, can I please have your email address? Business-related @msibeko
702129406387556352 2016-02-23 13:54:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> It's been an overused term over the years but maybe we need to really start looking at the country as "SA Ltd."
702128759298793474 2016-02-23 13:51:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> This probably needs some private sector leaders to migrate into public sector leadership. Mark Barnes at SA Post Office is a case in point
702124925021265921 2016-02-23 13:36:41 UTC <Bush_Modo> What the Budget Speech will reveal more than anything is that we need bold, turnaround strategy kind of leadership
702093318906376192 2016-02-23 11:31:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> "If you had a twin I would still choose you"
702092526052835328 2016-02-23 11:27:57 UTC <Bush_Modo> "When I see potential I just gotta see it through..."
701804765395734528 2016-02-22 16:24:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> Oh you're in pain? My bad. Thought it had something to do with excitement over baby pics... @DidiDoBedda
701801856952094722 2016-02-22 16:12:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> Need to see you soon Zig @ZiggyNomvete
701794293292384258 2016-02-22 15:42:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahahaha I genuinely cracked up at this tweet @DidiDoBedda
701726459115806720 2016-02-22 11:13:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> Kanye West ft. Frank Ocean - Wolves... On repeat

701086365132443649 2016-02-20 16:49:49 UTC <Bush_Modo> Lol they must just send me an OTP,  that's it. @DidiDoBedda
701048392236056578 2016-02-20 14:18:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> 80% of the time I don't receive the OTP when making a payment online. Even after clicking resend. Why? @askSBSA @StandardBankZA
700749245989658624 2016-02-19 18:30:14 UTC <Bush_Modo> And one such question is, are you giving/adding value/sharing/empowering those around you?
700745690507517956 2016-02-19 18:16:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> In order to grow you have to continually ask yourself some honest questions
700736849166389248 2016-02-19 17:40:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahahahaha @PurpleHazeBelle @MiniBengz

700238262879842304 2016-02-18 08:39:46 UTC <Bush_Modo> Think for yourself
700020382233923584 2016-02-17 18:13:59 UTC <Bush_Modo> Not much is said about S'bu Shabalala but what an impressive businessman!

698440270925459456 2016-02-13 09:35:11 UTC <Bush_Modo> Is it just me or is the lead guy in Billions the wrong guy for the job?
698206049380253696 2016-02-12 18:04:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> If it's one thing I know for sure, it's that no one can stop you from becoming whatever it is you want to become

907956505168793600 2017-09-13 13:17:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> Can I tag someone for you?https://twitter.com/NT_Dhlomo/status/907507303091462144

907676646790090752 2017-09-12 18:45:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> Whatsup with all these fake accounts?
907675811708329985 2017-09-12 18:42:31 UTC <Bush_Modo> Good character is not popular, but it's very very NB. Don't play yourself

902563267943424000 2017-08-29 16:07:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Good on him! Doesn't raise your eyebrow?
902561428334399489 2017-08-29 15:59:47 UTC <Bush_Modo> I enjoy every one of Sjava's songs and his authenticity. I hope that man receives every bit of success due to him

901101909595107328 2017-08-25 15:20:11 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi And how'd it go?
900773184148041728 2017-08-24 17:33:57 UTC <Bush_Modo> Take care of your spirit and your mind
900661000642449408 2017-08-24 10:08:10 UTC <Bush_Modo> We are the generation that will show the world what it truly means to be young, black and South African/African
900660471161815041 2017-08-24 10:06:04 UTC <Bush_Modo> I guess we'll never know. Thank you Mandela
900660232476655616 2017-08-24 10:05:07 UTC <Bush_Modo> Had a scary thought lastnight; would I be who I am today if Mandela was not released 2 months after I was born? Who would I be?
900084235960279040 2017-08-22 19:56:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> Job creation is the result of a bigger conversation... How do we compete globally? How much do we invest? It doesn't happen artificially
900082264901550084 2017-08-22 19:48:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> Developing markets shoot themselves in the foot when they don't participate in the progressive conversations the developed market is having
900081705247277058 2017-08-22 19:46:15 UTC <Bush_Modo> The new generation of business and political leaders in SA should focus on one main area; SA's global competitiveness
899649583910756354 2017-08-21 15:09:10 UTC <Bush_Modo> @tandomaps Every Wednesday, I think
899639157596835840 2017-08-21 14:27:44 UTC <Bush_Modo> @tandomaps There's Umhlanga  Farmer's Market too. But it's midweek

898598034572849152 2017-08-18 17:30:41 UTC <Bush_Modo> @tandomaps Cheers!
898597845988773890 2017-08-18 17:29:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> If you are being led and are uncertain of what the vision is, you are being misled
898597485769367552 2017-08-18 17:28:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> Vision breeds longevity: If you are leader the vision must be crystal clear or you are misleading...
898585024425021441 2017-08-18 16:38:59 UTC <Bush_Modo> @FinancialMail @GTalevi Will do. I enjoy your economic/market views far better than your political ones 
898583981268094976 2017-08-18 16:34:50 UTC <Bush_Modo> Nothing like a bottle of good red at the end of the week

897451772268077057 2017-08-15 13:35:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> @sizo_89 Hahaha precisely
897448672232849408 2017-08-15 13:23:31 UTC <Bush_Modo> Sometimes even great entrepreneurs run bad businesses
897085158154788864 2017-08-14 13:19:03 UTC <Bush_Modo> "Value add". Such a loose term
896822868494909440 2017-08-13 19:56:48 UTC <Bush_Modo> @TP_Pillay Bryanston, right?
896822469411184640 2017-08-13 19:55:13 UTC <Bush_Modo> Racism is a waste of everyone's time and emotions. What a poor poor mentality you must have to hate another race
895325038068420608 2017-08-09 16:44:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> Just realised Tasha's Flamingo Room is heavily inspired by Le Sirenuse. Very good taste

895238530171121664 2017-08-09 11:01:12 UTC <Bush_Modo> My theory is that the Bible gives instructions to men because women already know; they come from God. Happy Women's Day!

894968755809374212 2017-08-08 17:09:13 UTC <Bush_Modo> Maimane is such a misguided politician that he doesn't even realise that his real opponent is Malema
894965059520258048 2017-08-08 16:54:32 UTC <Bush_Modo> We have an evident mathematics problem in SA 
894947271019819008 2017-08-08 15:43:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> @LondiZondi DUDE! How epic?!

894284372957945856 2017-08-06 19:49:44 UTC <Bush_Modo> A winner may lose and a loser may win... What sets them apart is that a winner expects to win
893924116817948672 2017-08-05 19:58:12 UTC <Bush_Modo> Awesome night at the #fnbstarlightopera

892662025628917760 2017-08-02 08:23:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> @ZinhleMqadi1 Honestly 
892058166569160705 2017-07-31 16:23:35 UTC <Bush_Modo> The weekend was too messy man. Eish
891576038874116096 2017-07-30 08:27:47 UTC <Bush_Modo> @NT_Dhlomo Thanks bro. Will get it from you later today or tomorrow
891570632634355713 2017-07-30 08:06:18 UTC <Bush_Modo> Bro, think I left my phone in Nzeni's car. Please check for me @NT_Dhlomo
891047579038961665 2017-07-28 21:27:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> Champagne for my real friends! 
890961368404418561 2017-07-28 15:45:18 UTC <Bush_Modo> If you're interested, let me know and I'll link you
890960621755346946 2017-07-28 15:42:20 UTC <Bush_Modo> Requirements; 2-3 years' sales experience (pref. banking), Matric (degree advantageous) and strong sales skills. R450k - R650k CTC
890959794131140608 2017-07-28 15:39:02 UTC <Bush_Modo> Opportunities available for a Durban-based role in banking. Requirements to follow...
890646191586762752 2017-07-27 18:52:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> Forget what you've been told! Take the lid off your mind, dream a new world. Be pragmatic. And let time do what only time can do...
889833547208560641 2017-07-25 13:03:44 UTC <Bush_Modo> Have you left Durban yet? @Sandhirs
889832627573862401 2017-07-25 13:00:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> All the above are what ensure the sustainability of a business. With close inspection, only a handful of SA companies are
889831710254407682 2017-07-25 12:56:26 UTC <Bush_Modo> However; innovation is very slow in SA, development of new business leaders is poor, and support of small businesses is not nearly enough
889830820126568448 2017-07-25 12:52:54 UTC <Bush_Modo> For instance, Corporate SA is very profitable, which is great for shareholders...
889826824146038785 2017-07-25 12:37:01 UTC <Bush_Modo> We emphasise poor political leadership (as we should) but not enough is said about how poor business leadership is in South Africa
889825322425888768 2017-07-25 12:31:03 UTC <Bush_Modo> Passionate from miles away, passive with the the things you say, passing up on my old ways... I can't blame you, no

877536827401531392 2017-06-21 14:40:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Absolutely. Let's keep in contact and engage. I'm fascinated by the ingenuity of Scalable. Will your be @roboinvestor UK next year?
877185261641322496 2017-06-20 15:23:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Fair enough. Unfortunately robo-advise is almost non-existent here. There is massive opportunity, however
877180998932459521 2017-06-20 15:07:02 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Would rather email; it's about the African market. Can PM if you prefer, would need you to follow me though
877140939604725779 2017-06-20 12:27:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> @flrnprckr @ella_rabener Hi Ella. From South Africa. How do I get in touch with you or any of the other founders re: a business enquiry?
877119658226221057 2017-06-20 11:03:17 UTC <Bush_Modo> Now more than ever, we must collaborate

875336860037459968 2017-06-15 12:59:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi If 'radically liberalising...' means the same thing to both of us then, roughly, I think we are. You too
875334953587933184 2017-06-15 12:51:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi To answer you, I think both where former is a consequence of the latter
875330414289858560 2017-06-15 12:33:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> Let's leave it there for now. Have a good onehttps://twitter.com/GTalevi/status/875328922703077377
875328447551336448 2017-06-15 12:25:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> Answer my last question then you are dismissed https://twitter.com/GTalevi/status/875327259883819008
875327970377904128 2017-06-15 12:23:45 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Sure. We also can't negate that there will be those who don't want to understand. Do you understand RET?
875326482956124160 2017-06-15 12:17:50 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Not when there's consensus. Not when we all understand why radical economic transformation is imperative for SA's development
875325200442773505 2017-06-15 12:12:45 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi It's problematic when there isn't prescription
875324489948680200 2017-06-15 12:09:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Well there you go. Incentives don't work. Comfortable for a few, very uncomfortable for many
875322144338706433 2017-06-15 12:00:36 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi BEE is essentially an incentive...
875321458360291328 2017-06-15 11:57:53 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Yes, it's an option
875319126360719360 2017-06-15 11:48:37 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi You're smart, I don't have to tell you this. I just wonder why you don't see it. Transformotion does not equal corruption
875318360443170816 2017-06-15 11:45:34 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi But transformation must happen. Without it, capital will run away sooner or later anyway. With it, capital will run now, and come back later
875315921174376449 2017-06-15 11:35:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi I think the point being made is that a radial approach is required to garner required results
875315625735970816 2017-06-15 11:34:42 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi All these approaches exist in current charter. Not exactly and not to the extent of your suggestions, but they exist in some shape or form
875310130635710464 2017-06-15 11:12:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> @GTalevi Just out of interest, do you have a suggestion on how transformation should be approached?

865134480436195328 2017-05-18 09:18:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> The view is only specialised investments require specialist advice. Most SA'n investors pay too much (+/- 3% p.a) for their investments

862594923190599681 2017-05-11 09:07:10 UTC <Bush_Modo> @JrManqoba You're right, it is, but my point is it is a MAJOR issue here at home where our girlfriends, wives, mothers, aunts, sisters, friends live
862591985688989696 2017-05-11 08:55:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> That, unfortunately, makes us part of the problem
862591770990977024 2017-05-11 08:54:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> We've all been in situations where someone says something scary and/or uncomfortable about a woman and ignored it
862590873384759296 2017-05-11 08:51:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> I'm not sure how to fix the issue but I think it begins by talking about it as South African men
862590625417494529 2017-05-11 08:50:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> There's a MAJOR issue in SA with regards to the treatment of women...

860393960153415680 2017-05-05 07:21:20 UTC <Bush_Modo> Life would be quite bland without music, art, wine and women

848847004931424256 2017-04-03 10:37:51 UTC <Bush_Modo> Majority of SA'ns depend on our skills, smarts, experience and exposure to shape a different future. Let's not waste it on the wrong efforts
848845502741442560 2017-04-03 10:31:53 UTC <Bush_Modo> Our generation is too silent. Pravin was right about one thing, it's time to organise. We need to collaborate.

846688248340664321 2017-03-28 11:39:43 UTC <Bush_Modo> What matters is government policy and that the top brass are in agreement with the policy. Otherwise it doesn't work
846687929569329152 2017-03-28 11:38:27 UTC <Bush_Modo> It doesn't matter who our Finance Minister is. Could be Gordhan, Singh, Jones, Ndlovu, whoever...

761469116817498112 2016-08-05 07:49:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> The reality is, that opportunity has not reached tens of millions of our brothers and sisters. Here's a chance to do better
761467800061878272 2016-08-05 07:44:05 UTC <Bush_Modo> My thoughts; The ANC has created many opportunities and all of us on social media are beneficiaries or have access to that opportunity

760856888925949953 2016-08-03 15:16:33 UTC <Bush_Modo> For me, of the albums you mentioned, only MBDTF comes close. Watch The Throne is in a league of its own @JrManqoba
760856288632958976 2016-08-03 15:14:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> ...black luxe, King type raps all in one album. To top it all of, never-heard-before out-of-this-world production @JrManqoba
760855532353777668 2016-08-03 15:11:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> I disagree mate. Yeah they had fun, but it was layered; those were thought-provoking, introspective, black-conscious... @JrManqoba
760714346368491520 2016-08-02 05:50:08 UTC <Bush_Modo> You think? It's subjective of course, but what do you think was better than that album in the past decade? @JrManqoba
760566878469230592 2016-08-02 20:04:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> Watch The Throne is possibly the most complete hip hop album of the past decade, dare I say ever

714723897166458881 2016-03-29 08:00:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> Trust me, have more conversations with people who have unpopular opinions. Too many people say things for likes, follows, social acceptance
714483280041676800 2016-03-28 16:04:23 UTC <Bush_Modo> And for more people to come this side of the river for a good time

710492731097931776 2016-03-17 15:47:22 UTC <Bush_Modo> The world of art & design is very interesting because it's feeling-based... People just want to feel good

704655407105622016 2016-03-01 13:11:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> You have to step back and allow your mind to view things from a top-down/bird's eye view perspective, often...

704056727021424640 2016-02-28 21:32:59 UTC <Bush_Modo> Really hope Leo grabs this one...
704025883712081921 2016-02-28 19:30:25 UTC <Bush_Modo> Create from a place of love & inspiration
703590419762966528 2016-02-27 14:40:02 UTC <Bush_Modo> I still don't get how the lead dude in Billions got this role. I don't believe him
703554773308608512 2016-02-27 12:18:24 UTC <Bush_Modo> LOL! @DidiDoBedda
703546067762151425 2016-02-27 11:43:48 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahaha @NT_Dhlomo @Tokyo_Trev
703545854527991808 2016-02-27 11:42:57 UTC <Bush_Modo> Coldplay gave us some of the dopest music of our time
703545468438114304 2016-02-27 11:41:25 UTC <Bush_Modo> Women are really more intelligent than we are, just observe
703313076385349632 2016-02-26 20:17:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> HOC is actually shocking, this oke just told me an hour later he forgot to order my grub
703210481734062084 2016-02-26 13:30:18 UTC <Bush_Modo> Still not receiving an OTP when making a payment online.... ? @askSBSA
702798590549299200 2016-02-25 10:13:36 UTC <Bush_Modo> Play your game and live on your terms. It's effortless... You'll struggle doing the opposite
702184180772425729 2016-02-23 17:32:09 UTC <Bush_Modo> This full moon is amazing!
702152568655446016 2016-02-23 15:26:32 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hi Mandla, can I please have your email address? Business-related @msibeko
702129406387556352 2016-02-23 13:54:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> It's been an overused term over the years but maybe we need to really start looking at the country as "SA Ltd."
702128759298793474 2016-02-23 13:51:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> This probably needs some private sector leaders to migrate into public sector leadership. Mark Barnes at SA Post Office is a case in point
702124925021265921 2016-02-23 13:36:41 UTC <Bush_Modo> What the Budget Speech will reveal more than anything is that we need bold, turnaround strategy kind of leadership
702093318906376192 2016-02-23 11:31:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> "If you had a twin I would still choose you"
702092526052835328 2016-02-23 11:27:57 UTC <Bush_Modo> "When I see potential I just gotta see it through..."
701804765395734528 2016-02-22 16:24:29 UTC <Bush_Modo> Oh you're in pain? My bad. Thought it had something to do with excitement over baby pics... @DidiDoBedda
701801856952094722 2016-02-22 16:12:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> Need to see you soon Zig @ZiggyNomvete
701794293292384258 2016-02-22 15:42:52 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahahaha I genuinely cracked up at this tweet @DidiDoBedda
701726459115806720 2016-02-22 11:13:19 UTC <Bush_Modo> Kanye West ft. Frank Ocean - Wolves... On repeat

701098865689280512 2016-02-20 17:39:30 UTC <Bush_Modo> What the hell is luxury water???
701086365132443649 2016-02-20 16:49:49 UTC <Bush_Modo> Lol they must just send me an OTP,  that's it. @DidiDoBedda
701048392236056578 2016-02-20 14:18:56 UTC <Bush_Modo> 80% of the time I don't receive the OTP when making a payment online. Even after clicking resend. Why? @askSBSA @StandardBankZA
700749245989658624 2016-02-19 18:30:14 UTC <Bush_Modo> And one such question is, are you giving/adding value/sharing/empowering those around you?
700745690507517956 2016-02-19 18:16:06 UTC <Bush_Modo> In order to grow you have to continually ask yourself some honest questions
700736849166389248 2016-02-19 17:40:58 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahahahaha @PurpleHazeBelle @MiniBengz

700322128000892928 2016-02-18 14:13:01 UTC <Bush_Modo> Forrrrk! Legs are so stiff even if Rihanna called me now for a night of passion I'd maybe have to think twice
700238262879842304 2016-02-18 08:39:46 UTC <Bush_Modo> Think for yourself
700020382233923584 2016-02-17 18:13:59 UTC <Bush_Modo> Not much is said about S'bu Shabalala but what an impressive businessman!

698440270925459456 2016-02-13 09:35:11 UTC <Bush_Modo> Is it just me or is the lead guy in Billions the wrong guy for the job?
698206049380253696 2016-02-12 18:04:28 UTC <Bush_Modo> If it's one thing I know for sure, it's that no one can stop you from becoming whatever it is you want to become
698200428320784384 2016-02-12 17:42:08 UTC <Bush_Modo> Hahahaha @ZinhleMqadi1 @SoDamnTrue

697378457324560384 2016-02-10 11:15:55 UTC <Bush_Modo> I haven't watched a movie as good as The Revenant in a looong time
697336134712606720 2016-02-10 08:27:45 UTC <Bush_Modo> Your life is your art
697077406084026368 2016-02-09 15:19:39 UTC <Bush_Modo> You're at the beginning of the path to greatness when you start to think beyond just you...
697071587514826753 2016-02-09 14:56:32 UTC <Bush_Modo> Traffic in Umhlanga at this time has become ridiculous. Rather chill and catch The Revenant
696971398170963968 2016-02-09 08:18:25 UTC <Bush_Modo> There's a handful of really smart, skilled and innovative individuals in SA. How do we get in one room & discuss new ideas, new models etc.?
