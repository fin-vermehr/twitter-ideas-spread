743834972335767552 2016-06-17 15:57:31 UTC <Lykova> Oh, and I mean in the last 4 days!!
743834865402023936 2016-06-17 15:57:06 UTC <Lykova> What's up with my twitter? Just got about 10 messages through and the ones I sent didn't work? Still not working now??

741954188343660544 2016-06-12 11:23:58 UTC <Lykova> @AsdaServiceTeam I am afraid I didn't. She was an older lady with white hair. I'd say she was floor staff, not on the tills.
741630825171714048 2016-06-11 13:59:02 UTC <Lykova> @Wretch32 you need to WARN people.

741261638171529220 2016-06-10 13:32:01 UTC <Lykova> You know that feeling when you're so scared to do something, but then you man up and do it. And the world's weight goes away... Yeah that!

732213388110106626 2016-05-16 14:17:30 UTC <Lykova> @Morrisons some other comments as I dont think you'd appreciate them being made public.
732209902710620160 2016-05-16 14:03:39 UTC <Lykova> @Morrisons unfortunately not, assume managers as both looked smarter, if that makes sense. No name tags though. Also, I'd like to dm

731938790521098240 2016-05-15 20:06:21 UTC <Lykova> Getting called a vulture by a store manager because I was waiting for items to be reduced! Acceptable? @DailyMirror @MailOnline
