970394447790858240 2018-03-04 20:24:00 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee Fun!!  Can't wait to see it!
970347636988391424 2018-03-04 17:17:59 UTC <avajanesnow> @cristyrawks @RealJamesWoods Nope.
970347350177628160 2018-03-04 17:16:51 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse @cristyrawks @ShellyAMOSS3 Maybe before you try to appear knowledgeable about political issues, you would better serve yourself to first learn how to spell the word "repercussions".   Forget being a patriot, try being literate.
969993299351166976 2018-03-03 17:49:58 UTC <avajanesnow> How the hell do you do that??  @EdKrassen
969993159265591296 2018-03-03 17:49:25 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump No..  they laugh AT YOU

969953614717317120 2018-03-03 15:12:17 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee I don't care, they need to make their money too so the cost isn't an issue. I'm going to try and gather up some photos of my boys for me and my son

969694992292831232 2018-03-02 22:04:36 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee Hey I got four more you can borrow! I absolutely love those, are they selling them?
969606230451851272 2018-03-02 16:11:54 UTC <avajanesnow> @jeffgoldesq @kylegriffin1 @DebiHyland I think that's absolutely right! This is the next generation of Voters, leaders and parents.... and the gun nuts had better start paying attention and stop passing them off as just naive children. I'm so proud of them. :-)

969533578374623232 2018-03-02 11:23:12 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump Wow..... don't you have more pressing matters to attend to rather than a pissing match with an actor who has far higher ratings than you do?
969410228235026432 2018-03-01 03:13:03 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee How funny is it she actually threw in jumping jacks tonight.... is she stalking us? LOL.

969044014409248768 2018-02-28 02:57:51 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee Then coughing into her hands and touching everybody else's stuff ......disgusting!  Way too old for such terrible manners...... I'm no spring chicken, but I'm polite and at least considerate.  UGH......
969043523579211776 2018-02-28 02:55:54 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee I'm not really a germaphobe but I HATE getting sick because of some inconsiderate buffoon!  You know what it is though, those lifers who have been there forever don't like to use sick days because they get paid for them at the end of the year...
969042688514256896 2018-02-28 02:52:35 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee Yes!!  Pretty sure that at this point, we could even make jumping jacks look sexy! 
969040481626632192 2018-02-28 02:43:49 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee Wayyyyy too worried about perfection. It's admirable, but always remember that we are all created perfectly flawed..... it's all about the fun and just think, by next time, we will have mastered it just like we did the booty shake!!  
969039974334021632 2018-02-28 02:41:48 UTC <avajanesnow> @AllyMcBee And in other news, why do people show up to work when they're hackin up a lung?  TF.......   #NOTacootiegirl. #stfhomemissloogie

She's a racist, plain and simple. Anyone who supports Trump is a damned racist and I don't care what anyone says
962021903207579649 2018-02-09 17:54:29 UTC <avajanesnow> @gramsaleo I thought I had retweeted it but it was late last night when I saw it and I was on my tablet so I may have taken a screenshot, I just don't have that device on me right now and you know how it is, when you come across a Swine 45 supporter, you need it NOOOOWW
962018929819471872 2018-02-09 17:42:40 UTC <avajanesnow> @krassenstein I use an alias, but my picture is me only because of my work.  My family and friends know who I am & I definitely would never be embarrassed 20 years down the road abt anything I tweet today.Besides, I think avalanches and snowflakes are really cool things, hence, the name.  
962014935885729792 2018-02-09 17:26:48 UTC <avajanesnow> @gramsaleo are you the one who retweeted that funny thing about release the memo not that memo let's have a parade, as per my tweet today?  I've been looking everywhere for it and just can't find it but I can't remember where I saw it

You can spot them from a mile because they're all repeaters of everything they hear on TV all day. Low info followers incapable of independent thought sums it up.

959036412233330688 2018-02-01 12:11:13 UTC <avajanesnow> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Sorry, old man! Pales in comparison to the REAL President, Obama!!! No talk of foreign policy, nothing but accolades and your year im review which honestly, we're completely disgusted with hearing about daily. No real plans. You should just go golfing and let Pence do the job.
958547802170187776 2018-01-30 03:49:39 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @cloverc8 Now THAT'S funny.
958547253840330752 2018-01-30 03:47:28 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @cloverc8 Disagree. We need truth and that's what we count on our press people for. Trump attracts his own criticism.... if it's negative, there's only one direction to shift that focus and it certainly isn't the Press. I'd rather have the ugly truth than pretty lies.
958546106060648450 2018-01-30 03:42:55 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @cloverc8 The truth isn't always pretty. And if that's how you feel, why do you follow?
958545712588849152 2018-01-30 03:41:21 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @FirefighterGeek The rebuttal....or the REAL speech.  He's a putz...
958376005923737602 2018-01-30 16:27:00 UTC <avajanesnow> @IngrahamAngle Lady, you are way too biased and unfair to even begin to think you are worthy of putting words in @ChrisCuomo's mouth.  And, you watch him, huh! I do too, he's pretty easy on the eyes. :-)
958375179519799297 2018-01-30 16:23:43 UTC <avajanesnow> @JackPosobiec He voted against releasing it only until the classified portions could be redacted. It's a matter of security, don't you watch any kind of news besides what you hear on Fox? How can you people be so bullheaded?

956366968281481216 2018-01-24 03:23:48 UTC <avajanesnow> @RepMattGaetz Is your head sore from having it rubbed on the floor during Cuomo's mop job??  
956366507939807232 2018-01-24 03:21:58 UTC <avajanesnow> @mattgaetz And Cuomo mopped the floor with him.... 
956366307435270144 2018-01-24 03:21:10 UTC <avajanesnow> @mattgaetz @FoxNews Dude....Cuomo just mopped the floor with you.  You better get to Sunday school!!

956365331680784384 2018-01-24 03:17:18 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @Jacqueline68 I almost felt sorry for him....    Nah.... on second thought, I didn't.
956364946601684993 2018-01-24 03:15:46 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo SOOOO great!  Chris, you did an IMMACULATE job at mopping the floor with Goetz. Primetime needs to stay!! #CuomoPrimeTime
956229954299203584 2018-01-24 18:19:21 UTC <avajanesnow> @TomiLahren Love love love the headline! She should give it a try because I bet she would work those streets better than she tries to do for good politics!!

Other networks might actually ask them a question that they don't have the answer to. They don't like to be in circles where people are doing anything else but propping them up like ego-needy swine....
955649638115274754 2018-01-22 03:53:23 UTC <avajanesnow> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @VegasGaryGreene Bummer.  Maybe you should get a real life.
955648310068396037 2018-01-22 03:48:06 UTC <avajanesnow> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @VegasGaryGreene And again...I don't care about ratings unless we're talking about that 32%. 
955647966097715200 2018-01-22 03:46:44 UTC <avajanesnow> @CNN @ChrisCuomo @VegasGaryGreene Is that why you were so interested on Cuomo tonight?
955647231247269888 2018-01-22 03:43:49 UTC <avajanesnow> @TomiLahren @KamVTV Yeah..... I'd be embarrassed to own it in public, too!
955641204489691136 2018-01-22 03:19:52 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @VegasGaryGreene Unless, of course, you're talking about 45s historic low 32%. In that case, ratings are okay! LOL
955637652702879750 2018-01-22 03:05:45 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @VegasGaryGreene It's true what they say about stupid people in large groups. Quality over quantity. I don't care about ratings, I care about truth.
955633839061086208 2018-01-22 02:50:36 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo She's still not worth the airtime.  Friends or not, she wouldn't have two seconds on my show if I had one. I respect the fact that you call her friend, I don't understand it, and I think you should tighten your circle and just keep Cillizza...now theres a cool cat!
955402526290935808 2018-01-22 11:31:27 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo How are both sides not playing it and Democrats to blame? Especially when there was legislation introduced to continue at least paying the military but it was shut down by McConnell

953952592765231106 2018-01-18 11:29:56 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump No, we waste millions of dollars paying the president to golf. We need a president who actually knows and does his job
953952424477171712 2018-01-18 11:29:16 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump No, what we need is a new president with an actual functioning brain who weighs less than 300 pounds

949245368864096256 2018-01-05 11:45:06 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @MARCANDERSONNWO What's up with all the sweetheart and honey business. Don't you have some poor soul you call a wife around to call her endearing terms? Or are you just that needy?
949244204605046785 2018-01-05 11:40:29 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @ShafPatel @tinytankgirl @Gooserbaijan No worries, I see them on the daily! It's their way of deflecting for how stupid they look to stand behind the train wreck they electted.... I'd be acting out too if I was responsible for that mess
949140883860987905 2018-01-04 04:49:55 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @MARCANDERSONNWO And where's your picture?

You voted for Trump and that fact in itself makes you unable to trigger so much as a piss, much less me.  Do you really think we take your kind seriously when it comes to knowing wtf you're talking about?
949138479639773190 2018-01-04 04:40:22 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump We don't care about his past. We care about your present.

948531767270506496 2018-01-03 12:29:30 UTC <avajanesnow> @cristyrawks You "absolutely love seeing the left completely lose their mind".  That tweet in itself puts in shining display your level of low intelligence and your over abundance of immaturity. How old are you, 12?
948531406610694146 2018-01-03 12:28:04 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @brianstelter @POTUS @Scavino45 @cristyrawks Nobody cares about the clintons or Obamas because they are private citizens now. It's irrelevant. We are concerned with some half-cocked lunatic threatening nuclear war in comparing who's button is bigger like a 13 year old .
948518025283563521 2018-01-03 11:34:54 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo Thank God.... I was having Cuomo withdrawals @NewDay !  welcome back, and good morning!

942734364760186881 2017-12-18 12:32:42 UTC <avajanesnow> @TomiLahren And Tommy, you were never any good at journalism. That's because in Tomi's World  journalism means rhetoric, zero research,  fake news, useless propaganda and spewing hate.
941883838677921792 2017-12-15 04:13:01 UTC <avajanesnow> @POTUS @PressSec @r_little_finger @mmgonline I can't stand her, inside or outside. Might be mean and shallow to knock her appearance but honestly, it's like you say.... all that lying on behalf of her cowardly leader starts seeping through her pores and just makes everything about her hideous.
941868693826371584 2017-12-15 03:12:50 UTC <avajanesnow> @POTUS @PressSec @r_little_finger Yeah, if only she could learn how to apply makeup and stop twisting her face saying "uh...uh...uh".   A diet and decent haircut wouldn't hurt her either

Trump supporters are pathetic and that's putting it mildly.
941358144843853824 2017-12-14 17:24:05 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @tainteddemo1 @ChestHairSports @Eleasah10 You'll wait? Wait for what? It's all out there. Should we start with the pussy grabbing with a middle of patting the pockets of the 1% and taking away from those most vulnerable and finish with the latest Trainwreck of derailing his own party in Alabama?

940961067555049473 2017-12-13 15:06:15 UTC <avajanesnow> @TomiLahren Hey kiddo, catch up! Roy Moore won't concede. Go find your pacifier and go take a nap. Leave the news to the grown-ups.

Not sure what happened to religion or the Evangelical movement but at this poin, even if I wanted to, I could not relate to that kind of "religion"
940595943388450816 2017-12-12 14:55:22 UTC <avajanesnow> @SLBCTexas No, I'm suggesting that the addition of the whiskey bottle as a terrible Photoshop job.

940550478269575168 2017-12-12 11:54:43 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo I say we stay optimistic and say a prayer today. Because yes, we Democrats DO pray.... (contrary to the popular belief that we seem to be nothing but baby killers and heathens because we love ALL people). :-)

939591413712506880 2017-12-09 20:23:44 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe No need to feel bad for me....I certainly won't feel bad for you when it all comes tumbling down.  In fact, I'll be right here...gloating in your disappointment. #f45andtheidiotswhovotedforhim
939510577642332160 2017-12-09 15:02:31 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe Its comin.....you just wait and see.
939488103646900224 2017-12-09 13:33:13 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe  HOW many indictments so far??

939280419022884865 2017-12-08 23:47:57 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe And a proud snowflake at that! Too much effort to block you.  it will be more fun to keep you around and watch you frazzle it will be more fun to keep you around and walk to frazzled when they haul away your Pervert in Chief in handcuffs...

939167792296878082 2017-12-08 16:20:25 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe @donna_smith03 I did! And I sure as heck don't have feet as big as hers....nor a face as homely as yours. I bet those wrinkles make you even prettier, don't they!  :-)
939158878650028033 2017-12-08 15:45:00 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't vote for a pedophile if my life depended on it. And speaking of little margins, how's that approval rating, Donald?
939158549476855808 2017-12-08 15:43:41 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe Usually people who use a cartoon as their profile pic have faces that only their mothers could love.....if that.
939157725392535552 2017-12-08 15:40:25 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @connor_blythe And where is your picture?
939157502410846213 2017-12-08 15:39:31 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump @donna_smith03 .... it's going to take a whole lot more than for some grandma who wears sunglasses to hide her wrinkles to get to the likes of me, Darlin!  How much dye you got in that hair, anyway?

938803607671013376 2017-12-07 16:13:16 UTC <avajanesnow> @EricTrump Dear God! That woman has got feet the size of Fred Flintstone's!
938759604409810944 2017-12-07 13:18:25 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @SUREYYAYDIN @LoriBianco2 And, you know he's striving for reaffirmation from the Evangelical so-called Christians. You know, that same group who endorses pedophiles....even hardened criminals in prison know how to those kind  handle properly. SICK
938757419747876865 2017-12-07 13:09:44 UTC <avajanesnow> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet Not ironic....fitting!

938756223591051265 2017-12-07 13:04:59 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump You really had no business making that determination when it's very obvious you can't even determine how to properly apply denture glue.
938755987267129345 2017-12-07 13:04:03 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump @SUREYYAYDIN @LoriBianco2 No he's not, he's trying to score points with the Republican voters for electing the Pervert next week, and locking in his base for his run again in 2020

I don't necessarily believe in that, the best way to impeach someone is not to reelect them. But I'd be a liar if I said I'm not dying to see him hauled away in handcuffs

938211394234626050 2017-12-05 01:00:02 UTC <avajanesnow> @Angelina190612 Dear god where do you get your information??  You sound like a moron and looking through your feed, your English is very broken.  Did you attend Trump University??? 
938104326547001346 2017-12-05 17:54:35 UTC <avajanesnow> @realDonaldTrump From the looks of the news today, they didn't share your sentiment!
938090258671038464 2017-12-05 16:58:41 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont I don't think that anyone with the word troll as a name can make an educated anything.

938080054994665473 2017-12-05 16:18:08 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont @surferjoe13 First of all, I'm not Jesus Christ. Second of all I do my best to give my kids stuff confidence. Third, if that doesn't work for you, tough s***
938076495490240512 2017-12-05 16:03:59 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont I do! And I refuse to apologize for always encouraging my children telling them they are the best. In my eyes, they are. Deal with it!
938074158461804547 2017-12-05 15:54:42 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont Okay, I suppose I can use my option to meet you then. Everyone has a right to be here and speak.... one's own choice to entertain your nonsense
938073930685992960 2017-12-05 15:53:48 UTC <avajanesnow> @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @KellyLucero85 Two peas in a pod usually means things are exactly alike.... alas, to each his own opinion.
938073459900538880 2017-12-05 15:51:56 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont Every parent thinks their kid is the best at everything. If you think otherwise, you must not be a parent
938073175551770624 2017-12-05 15:50:48 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont @VJporter @DeadWoodMedia1 I think he's funny. Refreshing to have a laugh, even if he is off base, in such tense times
938072141618208768 2017-12-05 15:46:41 UTC <avajanesnow> @PoppyHarlowCNN You did a more then a fantastic job in this interview. How dare she go there with your baby? Terrible intro for her to be so kind and then resort to that. Props for Poppy!  You owned her. :-)
938071504251768833 2017-12-05 15:44:09 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont You come here for truth, otherwise you wouldn't follow. We know, we know, your child molester endorsing Republican friends wouldn't approve, but just read along and stay quiet, okay?
938070851840331777 2017-12-05 15:41:34 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont If you're not in any reality why you even post here? See you later.
938070683799736320 2017-12-05 15:40:54 UTC <avajanesnow> @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @KellyLucero85 How is that?
938067577795997696 2017-12-05 15:28:33 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont And if he did, I wouldn't put it past 45 to try and blackball him there, too. Your response is ridiculous though, in all reality
938067104389058560 2017-12-05 15:26:40 UTC <avajanesnow> @PoppyHarlowCNN @ChrisCuomo @Debie_Lynne Agreed! Made my day. :-)

938064839410442240 2017-12-05 15:17:40 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo Not to mention I find him entertaining as all heck! :-)
938064439651258369 2017-12-05 15:16:05 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @ItsBobbyTrill @MoleskiA The real issue is that too many people confuse the term pro-choice with pro-abortion. They think they are the same, and sorry, that is incorrect.
938062711887421450 2017-12-05 15:09:13 UTC <avajanesnow> @KellyannePolls @PoppyHarlowCNN @MandyMiss911 @libragirl75 Yes, ma'am!
938062494760828928 2017-12-05 15:08:21 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont As a private citizen, he's entitled to do so in opinion.  Do you hold the same standards to Republicans and Trump himself who endorsed pedophiles and try to rape us working class financially?
938058837755645953 2017-12-05 14:53:49 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @jlceggermont Why is he a fool? He's honest, and entitled to his opinion, that makes him a fool?
938057491002339328 2017-12-05 14:48:28 UTC <avajanesnow> @KellyannePolls @PoppyHarlowCNN @MandyMiss911 @libragirl75 She owned Janet Porter like a boss! That old better thing kept mentioning her baby and she set her straight about that too! They're so pro-choice and have no respect for women as women themselves.
938044864083640320 2017-12-05 13:58:18 UTC <avajanesnow> @PoppyHarlowCNN great job with Porter, Poppy!!

936629471314104320 2017-12-01 16:14:02 UTC <avajanesnow> @TomiLahren What happened to the other half of your dress, Cupcake? You look ridiculous. Is it an Ivanka Trump original?Or maybe its from the Melania line, you know, the more naked skin showing, the better! Not in your case tho, all that hate seeping thru your pores is quite UNbecoming.
936454818478022657 2017-11-30 04:40:01 UTC <avajanesnow> @POTUS @cristyrawks @SpeakerRyan I'd be more intellectually stimulated by watching an episode of Sponge Bob SquarePants....he's more articulate.

935838834448678912 2017-11-29 11:52:19 UTC <avajanesnow> @ChrisCuomo That's exactly what he's doing. Encouraging division, heightening fears and using blanket generalizations that all Muslims are violent. This guy needs to go!
