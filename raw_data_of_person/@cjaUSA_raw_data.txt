950207908599476225 2018-01-07 03:29:54 UTC <cjaUSA> @realDonaldTrump Show empathy and voters wouldnt be so upset. Stop attaching anyone you see as an enemy. You wont change so your approval rating stays the same. If Trump cared, he wouldnt hurt us as hes been doing b
950205380747059201 2018-01-07 03:19:51 UTC <cjaUSA> @jaketapper @funder He was an asshole to Jake and CNN. He made Trumps administration look even worse.
950195348462604288 2018-01-07 02:39:59 UTC <cjaUSA> @realDonaldTrump Please stop bringing up election over 14 months ago. Trump won. Stop fighting it Trump. No one cares but you!  HRC lost. Stop talking about it. You embarrass yourself!

949599352238075909 2018-01-06 11:11:42 UTC <cjaUSA> @brianklaas Another lie from Trump. I cant stand by anymore as he ruins our place as world leader to Trump working for his base only.

Him and Nikki Haley came out and said they want nothing to do with N Korea and S Korea talks. Biggest mistake ever. N Korea is going to shut US out like most other countries are due to daddys rhetoric. Worst president ever!
949285926445965315 2018-01-05 14:26:16 UTC <cjaUSA> @ChrisCuomo Why didnt u talk about the AG, Wray and Paul Ryan releasing all Russia documents and witnesses to Devin Nunes?  Is it true? And why?
949284001105268737 2018-01-05 14:18:37 UTC <cjaUSA> @mschlapp Dont speak for me. I am scared to death of Trumps mentality. Hes scary and crazy trying to provoke nuclear war with his rhetoric. Hes already took us out of being world leader. He has screwed our allies and other countries. We will be all alone. Hes unstable!

Now @SpeakerRyan and A.G. have realeased all Russia docs and witnesses to Nunes. They are going after Mueller.We are held hostage by GOP Scott
949130786984341504 2018-01-04 04:09:48 UTC <cjaUSA> @realDonaldTrump As youve said, the stock market doesnt show how president is doing. CNN talked about it every segment. U are the fake news. You tweet what u think will make you look good; meanwhile, you hide all the sneaky things. That makes the news more cause u wont tweet about it  Pathetic
949128464233369600 2018-01-04 04:00:34 UTC <cjaUSA> @realDonaldTrump Steve Bannon is your buddy. You divided America together. Nothing to be proud of.  He must have lied at his loyalty pledge to you. Embarrassment.
