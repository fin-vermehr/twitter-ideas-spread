937870308647886849 2017-12-04 02:24:41 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @sarahboesveld @TomTothIron I have often thought that men achieve power in order to let things get out of hand--like getting the keys to the executive washroom. Power is license, and it comes in many different forms.

My point was simply that it is possible to have sinned against somebody without any intent to, or even knowledge of the sin. Re: Using the word "gay" as a sexless pejorative. Social progress is not culturally uniform.
937836270293831680 2017-12-04 00:09:25 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @sarahboesveld Pretty much any straight, white man over the age of 40 is going to have been guilty of some sexual misconduct during his life.

802977896134508544 2016-11-27 20:50:23 UTC <michaelmurrayca> 1. The irony of "good" news, of "fact based" news is that you have to pay to get it. It remains a profit driven part of the economy.

772161863790563329 2016-09-03 19:58:29 UTC <michaelmurrayca> The air show seems very anachronistic, a prideful and weird boast not unlike big game hunting--something now on the wrong side of history.

733337173076938752 2016-05-19 16:43:01 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @NerdballBarry Spontaneous memorial shrines are springing up all over the city for those lost in the Parliament Rampage. It's very moving.
733336781790294016 2016-05-19 16:41:28 UTC <michaelmurrayca> Think we should all be expressing gratitude for all the survivors of the Parliament Rampage yesterday.
733334448285028352 2016-05-19 16:32:11 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @alaindebotton You're a hypochondriac, aren't you?
733334126187712514 2016-05-19 16:30:55 UTC <michaelmurrayca> Appalled to have head about the carnage in Parliament yesterday. My heart goes out to the families of the three dead MP's.
733112465110667264 2016-05-18 01:50:06 UTC <michaelmurrayca> The Jays are actually painful to watch, like an Adam Sandler film on a long flight. #TorontoBlueJays

732243624474357762 2016-05-16 16:17:39 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque Fair enough. Excising the intellect, I felt good when Odor punched him, a David vs. Goliath moment, a bully called-out.
732237715652087808 2016-05-16 15:54:10 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque Odor was protecting his emerging career. We saw what Utley did to Tejada That's why the rule was changed, & Bautista fucked it.
732235810565689344 2016-05-16 15:46:36 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque Bautista's arrogance wasn't why he was punched, but why everybody felt good about it after. A "he had it coming," thing.
732235637269598208 2016-05-16 15:45:54 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque The punch was because of the slide, immediate and visceral, the feelings of animosity existed prior to the act.
732234598999072769 2016-05-16 15:41:47 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque This ain't no primary, nobody is looking for an endorsement. It was spontaneous pushback, David taking out Goliath.
732233433397792772 2016-05-16 15:37:09 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque The punch was spontaneous and not staged like in hockey. It was angry, a response to an attack, and a lingering insult.
732233087384469504 2016-05-16 15:35:46 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque I know!! Imagine how much of an asshole you'd have to be to get all the other arrogant assholes to hate you!
732230333865832449 2016-05-16 15:24:50 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque So, POP! Just like in hockey, and all sports where amped up alpha boys trying to beat one another for cash and women.
732230156400656384 2016-05-16 15:24:08 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque Joey Bats has a shitty reputation for arrogance, and his cheap take out of Odor deserved some specific and general retribution.
732229881711497216 2016-05-16 15:23:02 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque Yes, Bautista sees himself as a business enterprise, blue chip. He uses that language.
732221492759527424 2016-05-16 14:49:42 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @hockeyesque It's good that Bautista, who thinks of himself as a corporation & acts accordingly can still get popped by a guy named Roughned

713870683420430337 2016-03-26 23:30:08 UTC <michaelmurrayca> @michhham Perhaps. I just think that our adversarial, winner-take-all legal approach might need to change.
