893111348208513024 2017-08-03 14:08:33 UTC <Phil20734030> @jonfavs This is incoherent.
892737702570930179 2017-08-02 13:23:49 UTC <Phil20734030> Why does Trump hate america so much he insults the White House?  Imagine the right wing if Obama said it.
892735427563712512 2017-08-02 13:14:46 UTC <Phil20734030> @slack2thefuture Why does he hate America so much?
892735205743742979 2017-08-02 13:13:53 UTC <Phil20734030> @Timodc This is how you know they are worried about the base.

892388360974721024 2017-08-01 14:15:39 UTC <Phil20734030> @keithboykin Stoking a major fissure in American society over Police violence is a hilarious joke, if you are Putin.
892104954273566720 2017-07-31 19:29:30 UTC <Phil20734030> Is the military (Mattis, McMaster, Kelly) running the country now while Trump tweets and promotes his golf clubs?
890286122072453123 2017-07-26 19:02:06 UTC <Phil20734030> When is the last time Trump went to church?  The man worships money, not god.
890285129310109697 2017-07-26 18:58:10 UTC <Phil20734030> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold @MichaelMathes I hate to say I don't believe the President, but I don't believe him.  Is there a receipt or document backing this up?
889930608083963905 2017-07-25 19:29:25 UTC <Phil20734030> @SenJohnMcCain @jonkarl As he voted to enhance the dysnfunction of Congress.  Most hypocritcal thing I have ever witnessed.
889928288071819266 2017-07-25 19:20:12 UTC <Phil20734030> @ObsoleteDogma This is truly surreal.  McCain calling for regular order as he votes yes to ignore regular order.

875143819842527232 2017-06-14 00:12:00 UTC <Phil20734030> @Evan_McMullin Total vindication!
873289844012851201 2017-06-09 21:24:58 UTC <Phil20734030> We know what would motivate Trump to lie, and that he does it constantly.  Why would Comey lie, and is there any history of him lying?
873190797692325889 2017-06-09 14:51:23 UTC <Phil20734030> "Total vindication" will be Trump's "Mission Accomplished."  #Comeyday #Totalvindication
873188986474377217 2017-06-09 14:44:12 UTC <Phil20734030> More than half of the voters in the US will have no say in remaking 1/6th of the US economy.  not a single hearing on health care bill.
873188642600210434 2017-06-09 14:42:50 UTC <Phil20734030> @chrislhayes Hard to call this system democratic.  more than half of voters will have no say at all on remaking the entire health care system.
873188355453976577 2017-06-09 14:41:41 UTC <Phil20734030> Special Prosecutor Mueller may have a different view on Comey's testimony as it relates to "total vindication"  #ComeyTestimony
873184608040493056 2017-06-09 14:26:48 UTC <Phil20734030> @brianbeutler It is completely outrageous way to make law to not have input from anyone.This is overreach and Republicans will pay for it at the polls.
873178099134988289 2017-06-09 14:00:56 UTC <Phil20734030> Can Comey file a counterclaim against Trump for threatening to release tapes of conversations the memos were based on?  #Trumplogic
873177218968637441 2017-06-09 13:57:26 UTC <Phil20734030> @marckasowitz @NormEisen Can you file a counterclaim against Trump for threatening to release tapes of the conversations these memos are based on?
873174740919308291 2017-06-09 13:47:35 UTC <Phil20734030> I would advise Trump's lawyer to proofread his complaint before filing it.  #Trumplawyer
873174509280428033 2017-06-09 13:46:40 UTC <Phil20734030> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Little attaboy for state media!  Must feel good.
873172795831832576 2017-06-09 13:39:51 UTC <Phil20734030> Tump filing complaint against Comey for leaking memos of conversations Trump threatened to release tapes of.  Comey counter complaint?
873171902629654528 2017-06-09 13:36:18 UTC <Phil20734030> Comey can't produce evidence of collusion, but makes a rock solid case of obstruction. Trump is vindicated! #TrumpRussia
872928598667251712 2017-06-08 21:29:30 UTC <Phil20734030> @MCShort45 honestly I don't think comprehension is Trump's strong suit.  He might not know what he says half the time.
872925990116261888 2017-06-08 21:19:08 UTC <Phil20734030> @ezraklein Intent is not hard to prove in this case. Trump said more than once he fired Comey to get out from under the investigation.  There is intent
872925433339281412 2017-06-08 21:16:56 UTC <Phil20734030> @saletan And the same grammer school
872918154296602624 2017-06-08 20:48:00 UTC <Phil20734030> Good news, bad news for Medicaid recipients under GOP:  You lose coverage, but you gain ACCESS to coverage.  #medicaidexpansion #GOPlogic
872917440111546368 2017-06-08 20:45:10 UTC <Phil20734030> Under GOP plan, sure Medicaid recipients will lose health insurance coverage, but they gain ACCESS to health insurance coverage.  GOP logic!
872916874417274881 2017-06-08 20:42:55 UTC <Phil20734030> @SpeakerRyan Is this like good news for the people on Medicaid, who in exchange for losing health insurance coverage, will gain ACCESS to coverage?
872909673334284288 2017-06-08 20:14:18 UTC <Phil20734030> People arguing that Trump's firing of Comey was not illegal need to consider neither was Nixon's firing of the special prosecutor  #Comeyday
872908908679049216 2017-06-08 20:11:16 UTC <Phil20734030> When your best defense to a sprawling investigation is that the President is not under investigation personally, you are losing.  #Comeyday
872902538504409088 2017-06-08 19:45:57 UTC <Phil20734030> @mattyglesias The CBO score is going to be horrendous.
872898122321711105 2017-06-08 19:28:24 UTC <Phil20734030> @haroldpollack They would, wouldn't they.
872897941400420352 2017-06-08 19:27:41 UTC <Phil20734030> Trump's lawyer is like a dog that looks like its owner. Typos, lies, rambling, odd spacing.  #Comeyday #PredisentTrump
872895425241657346 2017-06-08 19:17:41 UTC <Phil20734030> So if Obama asked Comey to drop HRC investigation, Comey refuses, Obama fires him.  GOP would be cool with that?  #Comeyday #PaulRyan
872892858814038017 2017-06-08 19:07:29 UTC <Phil20734030> Paul Ryan's argument is that President Trump is new to this accountability thing and, therefore, should not be held accountable.  #Comeyday
872891391659126784 2017-06-08 19:01:39 UTC <Phil20734030> Predisent Trump hires the best people. .  #Comeyday #Kasowitz
872890986917220354 2017-06-08 19:00:03 UTC <Phil20734030> Russian emails Hillary investigated, one but not the other, Trump Russia can't understand, Mr. Comey, response?  #McCainQuestions #Comeyday
872888189094158338 2017-06-08 18:48:56 UTC <Phil20734030> How dare Comey release memos of privileged communications that Trump threatened to release tapes of!  #Comeyday
872886495320920064 2017-06-08 18:42:12 UTC <Phil20734030> Are these the same privileged communications of which Trump threatened to release tapes?  #Comeyday
872884679774482432 2017-06-08 18:34:59 UTC <Phil20734030> Predisent Trump is not a liar!  #PredisentTrump #ComeyDay
872884187652653056 2017-06-08 18:33:02 UTC <Phil20734030> I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,  "I faced great pressure because of Russia. Thats taken off.  -DJT
872883274070282240 2017-06-08 18:29:24 UTC <Phil20734030> Trump's lawyer offered Orwellian defense of the President in which Comey's statements that benefit the Pres. are all true, others are lies
872882647185465348 2017-06-08 18:26:55 UTC <Phil20734030> Memos taken by the FBI director of communications between that FBI director and the President are privileged?  Who knew?  #Comeyday
872882349767307264 2017-06-08 18:25:44 UTC <Phil20734030> @mattyglesias The privilege of Donald Trump to lie with impunity.  How dare Comey interfere with that privilege!
872873949641814017 2017-06-08 17:52:21 UTC <Phil20734030> So Trump didn't "order" Comey to drop investigation, he just fired him when he didn't then said on TV that is why he fired him.  #Comeyday
872873599534862336 2017-06-08 17:50:57 UTC <Phil20734030> Are people forgetting Trump said on TV and to Russians in the WH, he fired Comey to take the heat off the investigation?  #ComeyTestimony
872867679144525824 2017-06-08 17:27:26 UTC <Phil20734030> @SimonMarksFSN This really undermines Trump's case that he has the best brain.
872867435308822532 2017-06-08 17:26:28 UTC <Phil20734030> The "Trump has no idea what he is doing" defense undermines Trump's otherwise compelling argument that he has the best brain.  #Comey
872866250573131777 2017-06-08 17:21:45 UTC <Phil20734030> White House:  "Trump is not a liar."  Now that is a convincing argument.  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay
872866050643296256 2017-06-08 17:20:58 UTC <Phil20734030> Is anyone else worried that the GOP is using the Comey hearing as cover to sneak through a horrific wealthcare bill?  #ComeyTestimony
872865340421701632 2017-06-08 17:18:08 UTC <Phil20734030> Republicans seem to be arguing that Comey messed up by not more forcefully rejecting Trump's efforts to obstruct justice.  #ComeyTestimony
872864928344006656 2017-06-08 17:16:30 UTC <Phil20734030> When your defense is " We have no idea what we are doing because we are incompetent," you are in a bad place.  #ComeyTestimony
872864162757713920 2017-06-08 17:13:28 UTC <Phil20734030> @mattyglesias Is this to bolster the "Trump has no idea what he is doing" defense to obstruction of justice charges?
872864028602847233 2017-06-08 17:12:56 UTC <Phil20734030> @SimonMarksFSN So the WH obstruction of justice defense, that Trump has no idea what he is doing, is credible.
872859859464671235 2017-06-08 16:56:22 UTC <Phil20734030> @michaeldweiss White House:  The President has no idea what he is doing!
872859639385403397 2017-06-08 16:55:29 UTC <Phil20734030> White House defense to obstruction of justice charge:  Trump has no idea what he is doing!
872842704568418306 2017-06-08 15:48:12 UTC <Phil20734030> @davidaxelrod So the argument is that Comey failed to reject Trump's efforts to obstruct justice forcefully enough?
872841843737858048 2017-06-08 15:44:46 UTC <Phil20734030> @Evan_McMullin These Republicans seem to be criticizing Comey harshly for not more forcefully rejecting Trump's efforts to obstruct Justice.  Nuts.
872840396245782528 2017-06-08 15:39:01 UTC <Phil20734030> President orders FBI director to drop investigations.  Director refuses.  President fires him.  President publicly brags he fired him for it
872839764625543168 2017-06-08 15:36:31 UTC <Phil20734030> Republican Senators seem to be arguing that Comey screwed up by not more forcefully rejecting Trump's efforts to obstruct justice.  Absurd!
839153614207791108 2017-03-07 16:39:47 UTC <Phil20734030> Good news is, if the House health insurance bill passes, republicans time in power will be short.
836783873115697153 2017-02-28 03:43:16 UTC <Phil20734030> Ryan's widow would probably rather he be alive, than get applause.  If Trump listened to Intel, Ryan may be alive. #JointAddress
836781991366377478 2017-02-28 03:35:48 UTC <Phil20734030> I'm sure the Navy Seal enjoyed the applause, but if Trump listened to Intel briefings instead of tweeting, maybe  he would still be alive.
