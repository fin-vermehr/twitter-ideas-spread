949669828876472320 2018-01-06 15:51:45 UTC <J_Thomas001> Today I learned that Donald Trump ran for office in 2000, but withdrew because there were klansmen and now-nazis in [his] party (Reform Party). But he says that he won the election on his first try. If this doesnt prove that he has dementia, I dont know what will.
