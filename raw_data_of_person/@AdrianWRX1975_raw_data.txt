968886003376279552 2018-02-28 16:29:58 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @EricBanks @DerrickMTV Eric looks great and healthy now!!
968686582185283584 2018-02-27 03:17:33 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @kennyismusic I know r@pe victims who drop charges, it really doesnt mean shit.
968686399875702784 2018-02-27 03:16:49 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @kennyismusic As a person studying crime most small crimes you can get out on bail, assault is small are far as violent crimes go. Charges can be dropped for personal reasons or just wanting to forget about it from the victims side. 
968681921885671424 2018-02-27 02:59:02 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic Nah, but when you have arrest charges for domestic assault then you arent looking too pretty and its more than just a rumor 
968677402112090113 2018-02-27 02:41:04 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @Marie_TBD @caitanne_ Maybe they edited it out 
968676979456258048 2018-02-27 02:39:23 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic Speculation?? The term you are looking for is factual. But ok.
968658955688923136 2018-02-27 01:27:46 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic Especially not for a guy who also beats woman. He well deserves hate ye.
968658840056156160 2018-02-27 01:27:18 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic Also as someone who writes poems, I wouldnt care, why? Because going into music/writing/anything, I know Im gonna get some sorta rude feedback. Any artist should go in with a mindset ready for that.  Dont really have that much sympathy.
968658350866141184 2018-02-27 01:25:22 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic Agree and disagree. Ive criticized my idol so far as saying his last album was horse shit. Fucking awful. I agree respect is a great thing but an opinion is an opinion, respectful or not, professional or not. And anyone offended by such should hop off Twitter.
968657121960185857 2018-02-27 01:20:29 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @ARTVReviews @RonnieRadke @sotrclauren @odetocastieI Then you havent watched shit to know theres some in between albums that he doesnt hate or like. 
968481799507791874 2018-02-27 13:43:49 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @ARTVReviews @RonnieRadke @eldmolin What burn? Ronnie didnt have a come back all he did was fakely give him a donation
968481042704322564 2018-02-27 13:40:48 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @kennyismusic He didnt say shit about the band tho. All he said is he wasnt gonna review them and this song is shit.
968350333750644737 2018-02-26 05:01:25 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @majik_davis I could, but I like correcting stupid people xx
968348940386041856 2018-02-26 04:55:53 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @DrBlazeLJ He likes when things are different, not bad and inconsistent. Besides this isnt facts. Hes allowed to dislike something. Its better then kissing a celebrities ass liking everything they do.
968348516471812096 2018-02-26 04:54:12 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> Just sat and defended a YTer I like and my notifications are blowing up. Thats the sign to sleep. 
968348186048856069 2018-02-26 04:52:53 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @yaboynickkkk Biased? FOB? Hm. Guess you dont actually watch his views since he fucking HATED Mania.
968348023419006976 2018-02-26 04:52:14 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @hollywxxdwhore I understand your stupidity as well. Yanno, you dont need to play an instrument to have a god damn opinion
968347711220207617 2018-02-26 04:51:00 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @majik_davis An opinion cannot be bullshit, as it isnt fact.
968347579892338688 2018-02-26 04:50:28 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @EmilyColonese  Not in the slightest but ok
968347393057009666 2018-02-26 04:49:44 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @Chris__Elston Really boring. But also really shitty if inconsistent
968347292045627392 2018-02-26 04:49:20 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @MeganWyllie2 He didnt say Ronnie was, he said the sounds were. Hes making a fine living doing something he loves 
968347080690405377 2018-02-26 04:48:29 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @Catwoman1011243 A music critic. The part most of these weirdos are missing.
968346834304471047 2018-02-26 04:47:30 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @DrBlazeLJ But he doesnt. Hes applauded Paramore for sound change. And Im sure other bands I dont listen to as well. He doesnt hate change. He doesnt like inconsistent sounds.
968346273421185024 2018-02-26 04:45:17 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke Ugh most of these people are dumb for not being able to respect an opinion of not liking shit. Stan culture is dumb, not everything an artist puts out is good, sorry thats reality. If you like it, cool!! But stop calling @ARTVReviews names because you cant respect an opinion
968345818804686848 2018-02-26 04:43:28 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @metalbabyyy And you shitting on someones honest opinions is a better attitude, right? Wrong.
968345568874582016 2018-02-26 04:42:29 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @Bcarty0238 Hed rather not, Im sure of it
968345462418886658 2018-02-26 04:42:03 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @ninja_jimz11 Because why waste time filming shit about an artist you dont enjoy?? People have bad albums but if youre constantly putting out bad stuff then why review it??  He explains in the video his points, like he does, because he is respected for that reason. And thats the wrong to
968344934804807687 2018-02-26 04:39:58 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @SpectXr_ Your point?? You dont gonna play shit to have an opinion
968344699495952384 2018-02-26 04:39:01 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @londyn_bridges7 So no one is listening to shit except Jon saying his opinions 
968344614590713857 2018-02-26 04:38:41 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @londyn_bridges7 Its a link to his review not to Ronnies music
968344510685241344 2018-02-26 04:38:16 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @aIeighcia It does!! Because not everyone likes it!!
968344411666034689 2018-02-26 04:37:53 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @RonnieRadke @lilydtch @Fruitybuddha No we shouldnt fight someone over an opinion. Hes not wrong. I just dont remember the band ever being good. Oops.    No one said they cant change. If theyre too inconsistent its not enjoyable. Gotta change at slow rates thatll sound good. 
968322639382155265 2018-02-26 03:11:22 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @ItsEthanYaBoi @l3TM1G0 Well he DOES have a right to an opinion and putting it on his worst list was only his opinion and not a fact. Stop being butthurt because he doesnt like a song. 
968220777785982977 2018-02-26 20:26:36 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @ARTVReviews Polo shirts shirts high school  Why did no one notice this 
968220240294371328 2018-02-26 20:24:28 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @iReIateLife @Jellyfishlion @DeathgameYT We REALLY dont have a big homeless problem where I live because smaller town but if I saw one and had money on me Id give them a few bucks
968218775731556358 2018-02-26 20:18:39 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @yelyahwilliams I lost my friend to suicide a year ago, it was one of my lowest moments. I was in a terrible situation with an ex who abused me at the time, I blamed myself I was so angry that it happened and there was nothing I could do. Grief isnt always a sad thing. It can be anger too.

967030436944850944 2018-02-23 13:36:37 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @DerrickMTV Terrible idea. It wont solve anything and theres bad teachers. I had a few friends tell me about their teachers making joke gun threats, what if they ended up being serious? I just really hate this idea in general.

965804569539371008 2018-02-19 04:25:27 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @nytimes @ARTVReviews Kinda, I got into rock (MB20) greatly at 12, I like some rock like Linkin Park, Green Day all things my mom would play in the car. But I also grew to love things I hated around that time. It changes but it kinda shaped me in a certain way.

962869700790243330 2018-02-11 02:03:20 UTC <AdrianWRX1975> @ARTVReviews Also songs like Behind My Hazel Eyes (a favorite, not on that album but still very rock leaning) She was very rock back in the day if you think about it (Walk Away, Since U Been Gone, My December as a whole)
