968109888823025664 2018-02-26 13:05:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Uncle_Tom_Hicks The problem is two fold: 1) the game is a three true outcome game now. So less is happening, and its taking longer to happen  2) kids watch soccer, which is a 1:45 time slot every time, and basketball, which rarely takes longer than 2.5 hours. Both have more action regardless.

I will be very interested to see how support for Sacramento Republic and FC Cincinnati will change now that they know they arent going to MLS. See what happened to the Rochester Rhinos.
965380624013021187 2018-02-18 00:20:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MerrittPaulson @RobertWCross @ranch_boy I think the benefits outweigh the downsides. The downside would be that investing in a club would incur higher risk, turning away the risk-averse and the non-entrepreneurial. On the other hand, it would increase investment and commitment to local clubs who otherwise wouldnt.

As Charles Barkley said last night, only in American sports do we reward mediocrity. Besides for that, Im convinced that some pro/rel, even relegating the last team in each league, will spread the wealth.

I think we are at the point that single entity needs to be done away with. I also think that playoffs need to be cut to eight teams, and that a relegation of one team to Usl and promotion of the usl champ must be considered.

If there was a pathway to the top, revenue would increase with each level. You would be incentivized to field a better team because the people would demand it. Not so in minor league baseball.

Baseball also considered pro/rel in the 1920s. There currently is an issue with tanking in baseball. See the marlins, pirates, reds, Phillies, Padres, and braves, to name six.

Pro-rel works in soccer more than Every other sport because soccer, by its nature, its a game of passion and hyperlocal tribalism. MLB has huge revenue, but they have recently began discussing relegation due to the issue of tanking.

And every other sport is poor, because the lack of pro rel in baseball ultimately limited it. Basketball and football have universities that are local incubators of talent.

For example, economic theory states that when the top 1% has more than 49% of the National wealth, a depression is inevitable because there isnt enough cash to go around the rest of the populace. Same with sporting investment.

Soccer is viable because 1) exposure to the World Cup; and 2) exposure to the European leagues. I would argue that MLS has some to do with the growth, but you are overstating it by a mile.

957842282828484608 2018-01-28 05:06:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TurfwayJoe If you ever listen to players like Sterling Sheppard, Wes Welker and Odell Beckham, your statement is untrue. Kids shift to other sports because they see more money and more opportunity.
957840810438995968 2018-01-28 05:00:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @USMNT @NorthsidePigeon @TurfwayJoe Actually, a Gallup poll just last month showed that soccer is ahead of baseball with people under 55 in this country. But carry on with that theory.

939911390688661506 2017-12-10 17:35:12 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MacN_ESPN @SportsTVRatings I think that's the wrong conclusion. I would conclude that expanding MLS is the wrong direction. The correct direction is expanding the possibilities within the system. Norfolk will never see an MLS team in the current format.

933156382026563585 2017-11-21 02:13:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @kkfla737 That too. Worst of all, players in MLS never take defenders on one-on-one. There's no swashbuckling creativity.

927345250707955712 2017-11-05 01:21:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CONSTsuprtr Because fans still buy the tickets. The low attendance was a multitude of factors. The player protest was very very low on the list.

918219080359964672 2017-10-11 20:57:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd I disagree. Soccer players generally need insane quickness. The only athletes I see being good soccer players are slot guys, RBs, CBs, & PGs
918216841251704832 2017-10-11 20:48:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd No. It is my contention that best athlete does not equal best soccer player. Its a different skill set than either of those sports.
918216583931146242 2017-10-11 20:47:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd Yedlin and Wynne would have been NFL prospects if they chose football. Odell, who was a soccer player, chose football, unfortunately.
918211275443920896 2017-10-11 20:26:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd Then there is DeAndre Yedlin, who was a top recruit as a CB for the Washington Huskies. He ran a 4.3 40 in high school. He chose soccer.
918210874745204737 2017-10-11 20:25:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd That's false. Have you ever heard of Marvell Wynne? Dude ran a 4.2, built like a RB, and he never made it out of MLS.
918143605981831168 2017-10-11 15:57:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd Then I have a problem with the "best athlete" narrative. A great athlete doesn't necessarily equal great soccer player.
918141774434045952 2017-10-11 15:50:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColinCowherd Pulisic isn't one of our best athletes?

787643865792675840 2016-10-16 13:18:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @FiveThirtyEight ...if there are elections of course.
787641184709672960 2016-10-16 13:07:46 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @mmurraypolitics @ChemiShalev historically, pretty much all major candidates get at least 40% of the vote. No surprise.

787020104823345153 2016-10-14 19:59:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @WillMcAvoyACN @MichaelLovett9 you are assuming it's going to be over after the 8th. I highly doubt that.
787019251496411136 2016-10-14 19:56:26 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @simbernardo exactly what I was thinking.
787013686707777536 2016-10-14 19:34:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @gwenorel1 @Pkellyshock because that's often the mentality of abuse. Blaming themselves, thinking that they did something wrong.
786987546219642880 2016-10-14 17:50:27 UTC <DemotionAntonym> it also doesn't help that the regular season in hockey barely matters.
786987162310881280 2016-10-14 17:48:55 UTC <DemotionAntonym> my family had seasons in the 200s. We didn't renew because they doubled our prices for this year. Ridiculous.

786569735718727681 2016-10-13 14:10:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sgevans this article is the most astute article I've read about why this election is happening.

785699624900292608 2016-10-10 04:32:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MLBcathedrals yeah. It's a slow recovery. There are people here who are still recovering 4 years later.
785696325287411712 2016-10-10 04:19:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MLBcathedrals hang in there. Your tweet reminds me of the trauma I went through during Sandy, when we were cut of from the world for days.

785463799134453760 2016-10-10 12:55:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @voxdotcom @dens @RonWechsler I mean, this isn't anything new. Humans have an easier time being sheep than being shepherds.

785299668293017601 2016-10-09 02:03:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @RNs_Funhouse he's always been overrated because of those super bowl wins. He's an average QB. Always has.

785233936423251970 2016-10-09 21:42:14 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @OhioStateOO1 so any person who doesn't agree with you has a learning disability? Sounds reasonable.
785232441124515840 2016-10-09 21:36:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @OhioStateOO1 no. I'm not grabbing on the bias. That's how I, as a neutral viewer, interpreted it. And it sent shivers down my spine.
785230988381130752 2016-10-09 21:30:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KatiePavlich @OhioStateOO1 he did? He basically said any woman who has been sexually assaulted needs to come out publicly or it isn't true.

784235557383770112 2016-10-06 03:35:01 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TwoDaftYanks @soccerreform no. Just how. I'm a supporter of Crowley's plan.
784232640559841280 2016-10-06 03:23:26 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @TwoDaftYanks MLS is corrupt and anti-competition and an open system is required in the United States. We only disagree on how
784228152579063808 2016-10-06 03:05:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TwoDaftYanks @soccerreform you are judging a book by its cover.
784228022681477121 2016-10-06 03:05:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TwoDaftYanks @soccerreform We've had plenty of discussions over the years Ted. You know my beliefs on pro-rel and MLS itself.
784225950498222080 2016-10-06 02:56:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @TwoDaftYanks no. Now you are making defensive assumptions. Like you always do on Twitter.
784225665243635712 2016-10-06 02:55:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TwoDaftYanks @soccerreform I'm a huge closed league fan? I support pro-rel and always have been. Quit the slander while your behind.
784210572573282305 2016-10-06 01:55:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TwoDaftYanks @soccerreform that's not abrasion. That's protest. Abrasion is putting down anyone that agrees, but marginally disagrees.
784202740272603136 2016-10-06 01:24:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @TwoDaftYanks no situation "requires" abrasion. Activism does not need to be abrasive to work. It merely needs to be effective
784194370388037632 2016-10-06 00:51:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @TwoDaftYanks so if you know if it's your abrasive twitter persona, why don't you change it?
784186574799904768 2016-10-06 00:20:23 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bollinigomes and this hurricane is interesting, because this is the first major landfall in the Twitter age.
784183247316086785 2016-10-06 00:07:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bollinigomes and quite frankly, you are right about media and sensationalism. That's why I follow people outside the mainstream :-)
784177154850521088 2016-10-06 23:42:57 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bollinigomes I don't expect to change your opinion. Your opinion is your opinion. I respect that.
784175484380778497 2016-10-06 23:36:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @washingtonpost @brianstelter @bollinigomes The deniers think if the wind isn't bad, it isn't bad. But forget that the surge kills, not wind
784175247754952704 2016-10-06 23:35:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brianstelter @bollinigomes @washingtonpost in addition, Sandy and Katrina were "overhyped", but they were correct on the impacts.
784174931852550144 2016-10-06 23:34:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brianstelter @bollinigomes @washingtonpost and this winter, they underforecasted a blizzard by 15 inches. It goes both ways.
784174620618399744 2016-10-06 23:32:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brianstelter @bollinigomes @washingtonpost I was there. Juno took a jog 50 miles east. Long Island had 40 inches of snow. No exaggeration.
784169770031714306 2016-10-06 23:13:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brianstelter @bollinigomes name a storm that was overhyped.
784130203413057536 2016-10-06 20:36:23 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MJVentrice is it me? Or has #Matthew taken a small jog to the east?

783895014153850880 2016-10-05 05:01:50 UTC <DemotionAntonym> but his location wasn't what it was earlier in the game. That's a better indicator, especially with a control pitcher.
783891708090183680 2016-10-05 04:48:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> He looked exhausted in the 7th to me. Keeping the ball at 108 pitches, especially when ur a young pitcher, isn't today's game.
783875273792057344 2016-10-05 03:43:23 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SportsTalkJoe this is @realDenaldTrump level trolling. Well done.

778943895401029633 2016-09-22 13:07:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @THEChrisKessell @bwfast @OpenCupFan yeah. I did. "Nobody cares about the lower level" is an anti-prorel argument.
778933462929641472 2016-09-22 12:26:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @THEChrisKessell @bwfast @OpenCupFan you just made the MLS-lover anti-pro-rel argument.
778808998497624069 2016-09-21 04:11:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @THEChrisKessell @bwfast @OpenCupFan so going from, say, D7 to D3 isn't growth?
778808787352203265 2016-09-21 04:10:59 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @OpenCupFan @bwfast @soccerreform @THEChrisKessel @sfenwick75 If I start at 8th div. and move up to 3rd, isn't that worthwhile?
778802516662231041 2016-09-21 03:46:04 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @THEChrisKessell @OpenCupFan @bwfast not if you consider lower division clubs to be small businesses.
778794256362332160 2016-09-21 03:13:14 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bwfast @soccerreform @THEChrisKessell @OpenCupFan when did usl try it?
778793391538728961 2016-09-21 03:09:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform there is no lower division pro-rel right now. Can't know what impacts that will have.
778793151792316416 2016-09-21 03:08:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform the Miami FC and New York Cosmos owners have money to fund such a suit.
778788955332419586 2016-09-21 02:52:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform however, I think the federal academy compensation, if all goes right, can topple the single entity.
778788643947282432 2016-09-21 02:50:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform NASL will file an antitrust suit. It's inevitable.
778787977543708673 2016-09-21 02:48:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform but I know they won't. Because $. Unless the strategy changes when MLS becomes 28 teams. I don't know.
778787609342607360 2016-09-21 02:46:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform absolutely. That's been the play from the beginning. And I'd be ok with it if they opened it up to NPSL, etc.
778786970914983936 2016-09-21 02:44:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform of course it isn't simple. MLS (USSF) clearly feel like kings right now. Their arrogance will know no bounds.
778785760862404608 2016-09-21 02:39:29 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform 5/ owners do about it. Because at some point. Because of their model, MLS "growth" will stall.
778785579081330688 2016-09-21 02:38:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform 4/ so MLS and USL are their own thing. That should have been expected. Now, the question is what lower div
778785262373593088 2016-09-21 02:37:30 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform 3/ worry about themselves. They can create pro-rel without NASL just being THERE. NASL was a Trojan horse.
778784997981483009 2016-09-21 02:36:27 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform 2/ now that there is no league that is worried about survival, NPSL and the other leagues can ultimately
778784844071526400 2016-09-21 02:35:50 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @soccerreform 1/ because as much as NASL gave lip service to the idea of pro-rel, survival came first.
778783327167901696 2016-09-21 02:29:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @USL ultimately, the folding of NASL allows the opportunity to build pro/rel from ground up, while ignoring MLS
778605383162159105 2016-09-21 14:42:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USL @nasl @MLSAnalyst @KHeneage unfortunately, judging from garber's comments in SI, I don't think they do.

777607535901761536 2016-09-18 20:37:38 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @ChrisIreland444 @Rudedeck the Fargodome is expandable to 25,000. And it apparently the loudest stadium in college football.
777601775599816704 2016-09-18 20:14:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @Rudedeck @ChrisIreland444 NDSU is an FCS school that has gone 6-0 against FBS schools in last 6 years. But they remain FCS

774975823531114496 2016-09-11 14:20:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BigBrain61 so you are using one game as an example of why pro/rel is bad? How does that make sense?
774963814223716352 2016-09-11 13:32:26 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BigBrain61 because they lost one game a year after they won the title? That's absurd.

771043556769357824 2016-08-31 17:54:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform notice that he didn't say the standard "the infrastructure isn't ready." Because he knows it is.
771042281084313600 2016-08-31 17:49:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @JAXSPORTS_ @soccerreform well whose fault is that?

770083582958329856 2016-08-28 02:20:08 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @mhdtim @ScottJFrench @SiriusXMFC but they were not regional when formed. They were town clubs that became regional as popularity grew.
768876852261814272 2016-08-25 18:25:01 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench @dens lol I never said you were. I merely used you as an example of a person who is working for it :-P
768873153590419456 2016-08-25 18:10:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench that's fine. And I'm telling you that people like @dens will make it happen.
768868674149253125 2016-08-25 17:52:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench I don't expect us to.
768866164881625089 2016-08-25 17:42:33 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench see I disagree entirely. If you compare with the NFL, the NFL isn't the end all be all. There are 117 NCAA teams making bank.
768773747595681792 2016-08-25 11:35:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench economic sense for MLS? Or for American soccer in general? MLS isn't the be-all, end-all here.
768773342341980160 2016-08-25 11:33:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench a very small percentage of them are MLS fans. Is that not a problem to you?
768773116214378497 2016-08-25 11:32:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench I am a fan. I'm a Red Bulls fan. Don't make assumptions about my fandom. "It was never going to happen" is an absurd argument.
768667080577212416 2016-08-24 04:31:27 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench soccer is about drama and moments. What moments have there been in MLS this season? Other than 7-0, I can't think of any.
768666454451421184 2016-08-24 04:28:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench and frankly, I think there is a compelling argument. The drama of tiny Chattanooga going against the Galaxy isn't enticing?
768665746704572416 2016-08-24 04:26:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench it was on the table when the league formed. Chuck Blazer cut a deal with FIFA and killed it.
768658544568700928 2016-08-24 03:57:32 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench I sense that what MLS is trying to perpetuate is a fallacy. And I'm not OK with that.
768658356466843648 2016-08-24 03:56:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench That's entirely fair. But, the sporting culture in this country didn't begin with franchises born out of thin air.
768622378163302400 2016-08-24 01:33:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench so then why are we forming MLS accordance with the so called traditions of other American leagues?
768613023510564864 2016-08-24 00:56:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench who are these others? Soccer is growing in America. MLS is stagnant. Look at the ratings for Sounders-RSL.
768612022678347776 2016-08-24 00:52:40 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench at some point, soccer owners will realize that a gold rush for 8 spots in MLS  doesn't make sense either.
768610619222331392 2016-08-24 00:47:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench I also think you are underestimating the intelligence of the US soccer fan, and the American sports fan.
768609930173644800 2016-08-24 00:44:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench so then, unfortunately, a top soccer league in America won't happen. Soccer's core is hyperlocal, not regional
768608830720774144 2016-08-24 00:39:59 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ScottJFrench that's why I think Louisville FC is the most depressing situation in US Soccer: their desire to become MLS is pure pipe dream.
768608581407150080 2016-08-24 00:39:00 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench but look at the other side: more people buy into soccer if there is potential, however slight, to move to the top
768597783486009344 2016-08-24 23:56:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench wait, so only the owners of the 23 MLS teams matter? Not the hundreds of other soccer owners?
768589658146111488 2016-08-24 23:23:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC @ScottJFrench why not?

766275811032854528 2016-08-18 14:09:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @davisjsn @SiriusXMFC Looks like there is a certain theme in the above answers. I agree with it.
766251209581789184 2016-08-18 12:31:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SiriusXMFC this is a false statement. Exhibit A: the NBA.

765917878927368192 2016-08-17 14:27:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @cwilhelm2014 @AlamoCitySC sure it was. If you read the history of it and what they said, it's fascinating.

765901814634016768 2016-08-17 13:23:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @cwilhelm2014 @AlamoCitySC you'd have to ask them. I'm sure the reasons then were similar or the same as today.

765898098761752576 2016-08-17 13:08:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @barroldinho1 @cwilhelm2014 @AlamoCitySC well, then let's look at the other leagues and how they avoided pro/rel.
765893863680667648 2016-08-17 12:51:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @cwilhelm2014 With pro/rel, we'd be supporting the Fall River Marksmen, not teams from the old NASL.
765893085964410880 2016-08-17 12:48:35 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @cwilhelm2014 @AlamoCitySC why is that relevant?

765728514075164673 2016-08-16 01:54:38 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @cwilhelm2014 @soccerreform a team in an open league isn't a franchise; it's a part of the community, and continues to do so even w/o money.
765728046242467840 2016-08-16 01:52:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @cwilhelm2014 @soccerreform the answer is zero. Because open leagues fluctuate in quality based on its popularity. They don't merely close.
765727754398605314 2016-08-16 01:51:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @cwilhelm2014 @soccerreform well let's ask this question: How many open leagues have folded?
765709581590880256 2016-08-16 00:39:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @cwilhelm2014 yes. And if it wasn't a closed league, it would not have died. Period.
765709445116661760 2016-08-16 00:38:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform I know you assume the opposite.
765696790486212608 2016-08-16 23:48:35 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @cwilhelm2014 the problem with what you are saying is that you are assuming NASL would have died regardless of open system.

764177654316621824 2016-08-12 19:12:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @joanpzls @AlexiLalas @daminch3 which is a problem. Strength and speed only gets you so far. Especially with women's soccer improving.

757754331085074432 2016-07-25 01:48:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 you are arguing that soccer will never be A top American sport, not THE top American sport. I gave you evidence it will be.
757750856125190144 2016-07-25 01:34:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 I'm not saying it's gonna be the most popular sport. I'm saying it is popular. Period.
757708450126262273 2016-07-25 22:45:46 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Mets @JimCantore @DanJFriedman here's your answer.
757688114810916864 2016-07-25 21:24:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/story/1740529/mls-catches-mlb-in-popularity-with-kids-says-espn-poll  here is proof
757686013200400384 2016-07-25 21:16:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 the studies of American youth and their favorite sports say other wise.
757685784996634624 2016-07-25 21:15:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 and I'm arguing that it will. Because the under 30 crowd is crazy about it.
757668469605298176 2016-07-25 20:06:54 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 then what are you saying? Are you arguing about the league? Because that's a narrow argument that is irrelevant to the sports pop
757662513655869441 2016-07-25 19:43:14 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 yes I am. I'm arguing that more people in this country watch soccer than you are giving credit.
757660836810948608 2016-07-25 19:36:34 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 that's america's top league. There is also nasl, usl, and NPSL. But ratings are way higher for the English league and mex. league
757658158349320196 2016-07-25 19:25:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 you are equating "soccer" with "MLS". Soccer itself has more games in the top 50 in ratings for sporting events than baseball.
757570021275099136 2016-07-25 13:35:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 @M4iden_Canada plus, MLS averages, as a whole, 20,000 fans a game. Look up FC Cincinnati, who are below MLS but get 15000/game.
757569551299141632 2016-07-25 13:33:50 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 @M4iden_Canada MLS isnt popular. Soccer itself is. Look at the EPL, Copa America, Euros, and World Cup TV ratings.
757565330260684800 2016-07-25 13:17:04 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 compared to where it was 15 years ago? It's a meteoric rise.
757550019746627584 2016-07-25 12:16:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sirgigz92 no one ever said it will, but it's well known that soccer has overtaken hockey as the number four sport.
757289417463762944 2016-07-24 19:00:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MLSAnalyst I know a way that can happen...
756221721645023232 2016-07-21 20:18:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @mrtsully lol funny you should say that. Because it is. We don't see it in the ratings yet though.
755967015878332416 2016-07-20 03:25:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CJogues that's my argument. There is no parity in the NFL.
755751290282582016 2016-07-20 13:08:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @EliasSports the Blake Snell stat: didn't Logan Verrett throw 8 shutout innings in his first start in Coors last year?
755619962098704384 2016-07-19 04:26:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BenInquiring what I'm saying is that if soccer is on tv at the same time as another sport, that doesn't mean less people will watch soccer.
755617094960644096 2016-07-19 04:15:28 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BenInquiring it's not considered competition if people would prefer to watch something over another. See copa America ratings vs. MLB
755616444805775361 2016-07-19 04:12:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CJogues this is the acc championship games in the last 8 years. Entertaining right?pic.twitter.com/WU0pAA1cY5
755615134983348225 2016-07-19 04:07:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BenInquiring they really don't. Different strokes for different folks. Would more people watch hockey if there was no basketball?

755518010450964481 2016-07-19 21:41:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @woodruffbets @AndrewDasNYT @Guy_Blow there are thousands of American kids who dream of being Leo Messi though.
755516185714814977 2016-07-19 21:34:30 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @bwfast @dens @soccerreform @SussexNY so if they won't loosen their stranglehold, then might as well not try, right?
755421661277593600 2016-07-19 15:18:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KevinHignett @THEChrisKessell in my opinion, it's better to create something with a purpose than destroy something without one.
755420468509827072 2016-07-19 15:14:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KevinHignett as I said: there is a fundamental difference in ideology between Ted, Chip, and @dens. Crowley wants to create, not destroy.
755239009924833280 2016-07-18 03:13:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform thats why I'm saying @dens should be encouraged.
755231953444564995 2016-07-18 02:45:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @dens @soccerreform this is cynical. Entrepreneurship is a wonderful thing.
755217435511447552 2016-07-18 01:47:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bwfast @dens @SussexNY if pro-rel is based on the NFL's collapse, we'll never get pro-rel.
755214878386847749 2016-07-18 01:37:12 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @bwfast @dens @SussexNY but thats a real issue. Theres no denying that there is a concussion issue in youth in both sports.
755214512526098432 2016-07-18 01:35:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bwfast @SussexNY @dens It depends on the region. In the southeast, probably a 9.5. In the West, probably a 4.
755212623243833344 2016-07-18 01:28:15 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bwfast @dens @SussexNY this is a doomsday attitude. You can't destroy the NFL.
755203596032106496 2016-07-18 00:52:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @soccerreform @SussexNY @dens @bwfast I think Dennis's plan will open the market.
755197440953880576 2016-07-18 00:27:55 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @soccerreform @bwfast @SussexNY @dens i'm sure they can if a player gets international attention for skill.
755188962109579265 2016-07-18 23:54:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @bwfast @SussexNY @dens @soccerreform I see a fundamental difference in ideology here. Creation vs. destruction.
755188164323598336 2016-07-18 23:51:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @bwfast @SussexNY @soccerreform @dens it's kinda like creating a small business in an area when a sole biz controls the market?
755187719660249092 2016-07-18 23:49:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @bwfast @SussexNY @dens @soccerreform 1) baby steps 2) this is pushing through the back door.

755161962070306816 2016-07-18 22:06:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @soccerreform @bwfast @dens @SussexNY that's all mere slogans. @StockadeFC is doing something about it.
755151733509263360 2016-07-18 21:26:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @LeanderAlphabet @Noahbout_it @dens @soccerreform I'll never blame pro/rel. If this failed, I'd blame the oligarchy at the top.
755146941919588352 2016-07-18 21:07:15 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @LeanderAlphabet @Noahbout_it @dens @soccerreform the top teams of this model will prob be higher quality than MLS. Isn't that major league?
755146758804611072 2016-07-18 21:06:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @LeanderAlphabet @Noahbout_it @dens @soccerreform but it isn't minor league pro/rel if the cream ends up rising to the top in the end.
755146476225961984 2016-07-18 21:05:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Noahbout_it @dens @soccerreform wait, I'm confused. Pursuant to your model on the website, this is exactly what you've been pushing for.

753340290941984768 2016-07-13 21:28:16 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brudbux @ricardooleon that's false. The NBA and soccer hit records this year. NHL is stagnant. Baseball is falling.
753326374425853956 2016-07-13 20:32:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @brudbux @ricardooleon but people historically have watched the MLB all star game because it was really the only thing on TV.

746012309072523264 2016-06-23 16:09:29 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis it already is too much about winning. It's "win at all costs", not "develop your game". Belgium game a prime example.

745755112837091329 2016-06-22 23:07:29 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 so take away the radar gun. Relievers get Tommy John just as much as starters.
745740720292638720 2016-06-22 22:10:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 you know what's pointless? Pitch counts. Starters average the same # of pitches per start they did 30 years ago.
745739938956738561 2016-06-22 22:07:11 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 he was cruising and wanted the CG shutout. I highly doubt the 20 extra pitches caused the injury today.
745727587884863488 2016-06-22 21:18:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 because according to studies, high pitch counts don't cause elbow injuries. High velocity does.
745726949113405440 2016-06-22 21:15:34 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bkrupp47 @jdanowsk yup. Every single pitch a pitcher throws has risk. But a 100 mph fastball and 95 mph slider is a higher risk than others
745726580853514240 2016-06-22 21:14:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 teams are slaves to the pitch count.
745726483826642947 2016-06-22 21:13:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 making a pitcher throw 100 pitches to get through 5 is even less worth it.
745726332873678848 2016-06-22 21:13:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 he didn't extend him. His pitch count was low, and he was cruising. Extending is making a pitcher go 5 w/ 110 pitches
745725513726033922 2016-06-22 21:09:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 but it doesn't. 100 pitches is a made up fallacy. Players are bigger and stronger than 20 years ago. So why more injury?
745725198922620928 2016-06-22 21:08:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 kershaw throws 115 every night. By your theory, his arm should be blown out already.
745724962061819904 2016-06-22 21:07:40 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 do you really think 5 extra pitches caused the injury. Terry has said that thors personal pitch count is 115.
745724649447751680 2016-06-22 21:06:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 in fact, according to studies, most elbow injuries happen early in games.
745724420094894080 2016-06-22 21:05:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 there is no such thing as wasting bullets. It's a fallacy.
745724214674587648 2016-06-22 21:04:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 I disagree. Pitch count has nothing to do with elbow injuries. Look at the Joba rules as an example.
745723834788102153 2016-06-22 21:03:11 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AdamRubinESPN @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 pitchers who throw 95+ are exponentially more likely to have an elbow injury. That isn't an accident.
745723444776542208 2016-06-22 21:01:38 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AdamRubinESPN @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 and that's why so many pitchers are getting tommy John.  It's directly correlated.
745722661892952065 2016-06-22 20:58:32 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AdamRubinESPN @jdanowsk @bkrupp47 115 pitches isn't overwork. It's normal and should be normal. What's not normal is throwing 100 mph.
745630242488877056 2016-06-22 14:51:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @kkfla737 the perception with anti-MLS people is that Klinnsman is come sort of sacrificial lamb. Which somehow negates his shortcomings.
745481340837986304 2016-06-21 04:59:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @BMYOSU fair enough. This conversation is way too hypothetical for my liking, but I still don't think bball players are auto good soccerers

738389695432957953 2016-06-02 15:19:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @guardian_sport @AlexiLalas @SoccerLimey sure you can. JK was hired for name recognition, not managing ability. And it shows.

737127575336714241 2016-05-29 03:44:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> lol. Okayyyyyy.
737126611535986688 2016-05-29 03:40:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> so soccer fans are sheep because they sing and chant during the game?
737124770886586369 2016-05-29 03:33:35 UTC <DemotionAntonym> I don't get it. What's wrong with the strikeout chant?
737111715540766720 2016-05-29 02:41:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral usually there is a mini groan. I'm not asking for playoff intensity every game. I'm asking people to pay attention.
737107413002792960 2016-05-29 02:24:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral no. That's not what I'm saying. I didn't even hear a groan. Which usually happens when a pitcher walks a batter.
737107150552584192 2016-05-29 02:23:34 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral it's pointless fun. It's fun created by people who are bored of paying attention to the game.
737106955530047488 2016-05-29 02:22:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral I'd much rather have the crowd learn the @CitiFieldSheas songs. That would make citi a unique atmosphere.
737106353416736768 2016-05-29 02:20:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral no they weren't. The crowd didn't even notice when bastardo walked turner on four pitches.
737105453356814337 2016-05-29 02:16:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @The7Line @KnicksCentral the wave is dumb. It's grown out of boredom.

735679295847292928 2016-05-25 03:49:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MLSAnalyst @mkstnr @dkori @giyanks22 wood striker, Bradley no.6, Pulisic, Nagbe, Dempsey, bedoya. Dempsey more as a shadow striker.

735647931546603521 2016-05-25 01:45:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CitiFieldSheas I don't think we need Tim Howard. He's waaaaay past his prime. Hasn't been good since the World Cup.
735647579858477057 2016-05-25 01:43:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CitiFieldSheas I think the met game over #numbahone is a fine choice.
735646969964679168 2016-05-25 01:41:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CitiFieldSheas yes, but I'm still concerned that jurgen will go with the World Cup lineup of the first half against Colombia.
735646327430909952 2016-05-25 01:38:46 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CitiFieldSheas someone should call francesa to ask him what he thought of Nagbe tonight.
735646181515272192 2016-05-25 01:38:11 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CitiFieldSheas Nagbe and wood make them look so much more fluid up top.

734898573662425088 2016-05-23 00:07:28 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @USMNT @44_ronnie @AlexiLalas @jwCLT if Nagbe, Pulisic and F. Johnson are in the MF at the same time, it will be.

734862805476749313 2016-05-23 21:45:20 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @44_ronnie @AlexiLalas @jwCLT you assume that good athlete = good soccer player.

734580957823553536 2016-05-22 03:05:22 UTC <DemotionAntonym> What the Thunder did tonight to golden state was akin to the Giants d-line did to Tom Brady in Super Bowl 42.  #GSWvsOKC

732600383340748800 2016-05-17 15:55:17 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThatsAdamBooth audiences don't care about where the team is from. Audiences care about whether the team is intriguing.
732597986514067457 2016-05-17 15:45:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThatsAdamBooth I dunno. I would watch it if it's high quality.
732597485286379521 2016-05-17 15:43:46 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SprungOnSports @DOBrienAJC it's a crap team, but the fact that he's a crap manager doesn't help matters.
732330591388110852 2016-05-16 22:03:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @RobHarris @JakeFCohen @mixedknuts my assumption is that it's a college town. College kids like the EPL.

731925582234189824 2016-05-15 19:13:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis soccer wasn't in the national lexicon in the 90s. It is now. I don't see teams folding as much now vs. then.
731922583625605120 2016-05-15 19:01:57 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis but they shouldn't have to join USL to go pro. In my ideal world, they get to join USL by winning. And winning will bring $
731920806415106049 2016-05-15 18:54:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis anytime. I always believe in civil discussion over name calling and demeaning those who disagree. Every1 has a perspective.
731919661906968577 2016-05-15 18:50:20 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis MLS has won when every league and team is under their umbrella. They are far from that.
731919368989356032 2016-05-15 18:49:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis I used to really like what they do. Then I saw commissioner Garber's comments about Chattanooga. It changed my mind.
731918864104198145 2016-05-15 18:47:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis I would prefer a full open system. Would allow 100s of teams in and around the country to be in direct competition w/ e/o.
731917768853983232 2016-05-15 18:42:49 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis I'm about the fan perspective and the entrepreneurial perspective. We are coming from opposite directions.
731917487051317248 2016-05-15 18:41:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis precisely.
731917425873195008 2016-05-15 18:41:27 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis further, it wouldn't create pockets. Soccer right now is conducive to local entrepreneurship. The MLS ideal kills that.
731917074117885953 2016-05-15 18:40:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis but baseball is different. Soccer isn't conducive to minor league affiliates. It's a game of passion, not leisure.
731914260184465408 2016-05-15 18:28:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @EmptySeatsPics @soccerreform @thegabe90 estimate: 20,856
731913976255254529 2016-05-15 18:27:44 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis in soccer, college soccer doesn't fill that void. For a true national footprint in soccer, an open system is needed.
731913746667470849 2016-05-15 18:26:50 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis leagues in this country don't have a true national footprint. Most states don't have major pro teams. NCAA fills the void.
731912068140548099 2016-05-15 18:20:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis for example, the NBA would be vastly better if the Sixers were relegated.
731911745481150464 2016-05-15 18:18:53 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis I prefer US leagues too. I'd prefer it even more if they were open to everyone.
731908432454909952 2016-05-15 18:05:43 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @TheStevenWillis Russia consistently has teams in the champions league knockout round. That's a "top" league in my book.
731723816842493952 2016-05-14 05:52:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DanJFriedman it's time like these that is the reason why I never listen to sports talk radio
731691138638348289 2016-05-14 03:42:16 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @themlsreviewpod @TheStevenWillis false. See Russia and China.
731689334374584320 2016-05-14 03:35:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Don4Fire yes, but they would get that revenue of promoted. Pro/rel doesn't exist in a vacuum.

731681659679059970 2016-05-14 03:04:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AlexiLalas @CGrodz11 false. Only casual fans would go to a game just to see a player, rather than support their team.
731216498132434944 2016-05-13 20:16:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> What is happening in the French 2nd Division right now is why we need #ProRelforUSA #ProRelWeek #LeHavre
730624254472032256 2016-05-11 05:02:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @EricWynalda @aaron_layton depends. Were they promoted from the 2nd division in 2014?
730594879336763392 2016-05-11 03:06:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @kevinburkhardt @RickJBrody just because there would be the option of a DH doesn't mean you would have to use it.
730585844814319616 2016-05-11 02:30:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @JuanDirection57 that's a poor excuse. Does he know the parachute for relegation in Holland?

730576754377641984 2016-05-11 01:54:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @jaysonst didn't Clemens throw over 150 in his 1996 game?

725812194798133248 2016-04-28 22:21:26 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @f4denz @AR_MNUFC @FOXSoccer didn't say they weren't. but imagine the excitement of Chattanooga if they were promoted to the top tier.
725811442352558080 2016-04-28 22:18:27 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @f4denz @AR_MNUFC @FOXSoccer I think it's both. Overall popularity, caused in part by pro rel, led to the TV $. No Bournemouth in MLS.
725810439620272128 2016-04-28 22:14:28 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @f4denz @AR_MNUFC @FOXSoccer playoffs is no comparison to pro rel. playoffs is the so called "champions league". And pro rel =\= no playoffs
725810063198310402 2016-04-28 22:12:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @f4denz @AR_MNUFC @FOXSoccer 1) opportunity for any team in the country, 2) no tanking, 3) increase in quality.
725808844589416450 2016-04-28 22:08:08 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @f4denz @AR_MNUFC @FOXSoccer they do, but that's all a product of the closed system. Without the closed system, there is no such fee.

721050174513135617 2016-04-15 18:58:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @EricWSoccer but that's because the NCAA has 117 hugely popular football teams and 330 popular basketball teams.  NHL has MLS's problem too.

716847112458268673 2016-04-03 04:37:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AndyNYC87 ok. The blue jays struck out 16 times today. They won. Ks aren't a big deal.
716766105864380416 2016-04-03 23:15:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @roo41013 soccer is the third sport in the USA. But no one watches MLS. And you can't fix that by bringing in celebrities.
716757585165201408 2016-04-03 22:41:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @roo41013 so then with that mentality, pro-rel not only can't happen now, but will never happen. Which I think stunts the sport in the US.

706364463587393536 2016-03-05 06:23:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SJQuakesGuy1977 @soccerreform in reality, I would LOVE to see teams from small towns reach the top of the pyramid. Like Chattanooga.
706364039480348672 2016-03-05 06:21:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SJQuakesGuy1977 @soccerreform and no. I expect that in an open system, teams will form around the country on their own.
706363833863041024 2016-03-05 06:20:36 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SJQuakesGuy1977 @soccerreform um, very early on. People created teams. The league itself didn't.
706363367540301824 2016-03-05 06:18:45 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SJQuakesGuy1977 @soccerreform Ur basically saying that people won't invest unless it becomes profitable. Shouldn't it be the opposite?

705245474912116737 2016-03-02 04:16:38 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ebautistav The schedule wouldn't work in the US. Try playing in Minneapolis in February outdoors. Doesn't work.
705228984427143169 2016-03-02 03:11:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ebautistav no, and they won't. MLS isn't the only league with March-December schedule.

704847075062763520 2016-03-01 01:53:32 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MeganLTweets actually, they are dressed as Satan worshippers.
704755815245357057 2016-03-01 19:50:54 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @prorelniceguy @si_soccer @GrantWahl Technically, Caleb Porter said yes.
704718356671234048 2016-03-01 17:22:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @SportsTVRatings seems to me that more people watch EPL than NHL on average. Is this accurate?

702332432805208065 2016-02-23 03:21:15 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @BabbittCGroup @SoundersFC the first 15 minutes have been entertaining. And rather even.
702302675141042176 2016-02-23 01:23:00 UTC <DemotionAntonym> I get all excited for watching MLS teams again... And then I watch DC United and it all goes away. #SCCL
701900516272558080 2016-02-22 22:44:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @sambapete yeah. It's ok. The Canadian Premier League is starting in 2018.

700748816228728832 2016-02-19 18:28:31 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform true. But alienating the supporters for disagreeing on implementation will hurt the possibilities, not lead to them.
700746145954459648 2016-02-19 18:17:55 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform I have. I've listened to the podcasts. And I agree with the pro/rel cause. But it can't lose DCFC and Chattanooga and others.
700744009409495040 2016-02-19 18:09:25 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform as do I. But rational conversation doesn't happen over 140 characters. It happens over long meetings and discussions.
700743561759879169 2016-02-19 18:07:38 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform it's clear most want the same thing you do. The stats show it. The only issue is how it should be implemented. That's it.
700743295287349248 2016-02-19 18:06:35 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform understood. But there is vitriol here between parties. Vitriol creates anger, not practical discussion on finding solutions.
700739966033334272 2016-02-19 17:53:21 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform I don't think they oppose pro/rel. I think they oppose the way you want it to happen. Big difference.
700706141102333953 2016-02-19 15:38:57 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @soccerreform @chattahooligan @TheDukeNGS oh I think the soccer world would know. The soccer world just wouldn't know the reasoning lol.

699470677414432769 2016-02-15 05:49:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @3four3 just watched some highlights of him. Wow. What vision.
699465754358448128 2016-02-15 05:30:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @3four3 who is the best player you saw that never reached his potential due to the US Soccer system?
699455959484211200 2016-02-15 04:51:10 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @MeganLTweets false. Ghost is a tremendous metal band. Just because they don't growl doesn't make them "not metal"
699443537000206338 2016-02-15 04:01:48 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @Harlem4Dais ...you didn't like Alice Cooper and Joe Perry?
699440300180316160 2016-02-15 03:48:57 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @darrenrovell @EmptySeatsPics is excited.
699398563625889793 2016-02-15 01:03:06 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DJTrumpforPres no. Maybe if he was younger, but he was nearly 80 years old.
699396441912045568 2016-02-15 00:54:40 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DJTrumpforPres why? I really don't get the purpose. He died. It's sad. Testing a dead person is kind of disrespectful, no?
699395481366110208 2016-02-15 00:50:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DJTrumpforPres not really. I don't really see the purpose. Especially when the family member is an older person. Respecting the dead.

697181009792647168 2016-02-09 22:11:20 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @alyssarathbun one is allowed to want pro/rel in MLS. Just because one doesn't like the way the league is run doesn't mean they can't watch.
697164073880973312 2016-02-09 21:04:02 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DJCharlieBlac @alyssarathbun @GregLaTour @LFCLegacy thats incorrect. The entire 2002 USMNT team was world class.
697158321460088832 2016-02-09 20:41:11 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @alyssarathbun @DJCharlieBlac @GregLaTour @LFCLegacy but how do we strengthen it? Localization or franchising?
697156804795613184 2016-02-09 20:35:09 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @DJCharlieBlac @alyssarathbun @GregLaTour @LFCLegacy I agree. But the only way to do it is either 1) boycott or 2) make giant pro/rel tifos.
697149994575536129 2016-02-09 20:08:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @GregLaTour right. If the supporters go out and pay $ for a closed league, there is no incentive to change. The only incentive is the $.
697145399505768448 2016-02-09 19:49:50 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @GregLaTour @alyssarathbun @LFCLegacy it should be "if you build it, they will come". If US soccer profits without pro/rel, it won't be done
697145173600559105 2016-02-09 19:48:56 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @GregLaTour @alyssarathbun @LFCLegacy ok. So my problem with that is its the opposite Field of Dreams effect, AKA "come, they will build it"
697120860218486786 2016-02-09 18:12:19 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @alyssarathbun @GregLaTour @LFCLegacy when is the sport no longer an infant in the US?

695016612328529923 2016-02-03 22:50:47 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @PaulKerseyFan technically, when you put yourself out as a public figure, anything is fair game as long as everything is truthful.

694181431308914688 2016-02-01 15:32:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThePonchat I genuinely think there is an American soccer culture that is growing. I'm not sure if that culture loves MLS though.
694165982550585346 2016-02-01 14:30:41 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThePonchat when did we start talking about MLS?
694164212101300224 2016-02-01 14:23:39 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThePonchat 1) they are meaningless friendlies. 2) 15 years ago people didn't go to games, period. Appreciate what we have now.
694154583980032002 2016-02-01 13:45:24 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThePonchat this past match was the smallest crowd for the men's national team since 2006. Every one of their games is usually packed.

693976321077153792 2016-01-31 01:57:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ThePonchat @gjsfcoastal what's a "soccer culture"?
693971494209228802 2016-01-31 01:37:52 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @gjsfcoastal nah. Nothing to do with it. More about Americans being disenchanted with the state of the national team.
693925596703932417 2016-01-31 22:35:29 UTC <DemotionAntonym> The movement in the midfield has been so much better since Nagbe came on. The back line is still awful. #USMNT #USAvISL
693893283974635520 2016-01-31 20:27:05 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KMiltz7 cute. Either way, looks like he will be playing RB next year.
693891781683851264 2016-01-31 20:21:07 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KMiltz7 @SoccerByIves he plays defensive mid for FC Dallas. I know that. But he played RB for the under 20s. If he's ur fav player, show it
693891260394950657 2016-01-31 20:19:03 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KMiltz7 @SoccerByIves in fact, if you watched the u20 World Cup (which I doubt you did), you would have seen that he played RB there too.
693890318672994304 2016-01-31 20:15:18 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @KMiltz7 @SoccerByIves I know what he played this year. I'm saying he came up as an RB. I'm not surprised he's playing there.

692369936132521984 2016-01-27 15:33:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @CFC_Kosovo Miazga is great. Very good in the air, shut down David Villa.
692367438311243776 2016-01-27 15:23:55 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @AndrewDasNYT the problem is hat garber is so worried about the league being popular and watched that he wants aging big names on rosters.

691036381469089792 2016-01-23 23:14:46 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @bakiBalboa and Pulisic is one of those players that will lead us there.

690312469437353984 2016-01-21 23:18:12 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @peteraltbaum @ColonialMars anti-Zionism doesn't recognize the fact that Jews are from the Middle East and North Africa also.
690310832740241412 2016-01-21 23:11:42 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @peteraltbaum @ColonialMars not really. Anti-Zionism is more anti-askenazic and anti-European determination.
690282209874419712 2016-01-21 21:17:58 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @peteraltbaum @ColonialMars I never said it CAN'T be anti-semitism. I'm saying that one can be anti-Zionist w/o being an anti-Semite.
690267186737385474 2016-01-21 20:18:16 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum but Many Zionists also disagree with the current manifestation of the state. More issues than just the conflict.
690266325558652928 2016-01-21 20:14:51 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum yes. That can be established. Just because they may be incorrect doesn't make them anti-Semites.

690261708544278529 2016-01-21 19:56:30 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum Zionism was a political movement for Jewish sovereignty, but at its core, Judaism is "Zionist"
690261390553174016 2016-01-21 19:55:14 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum a form of Zionism sees the current state as fulfillment of divine prophecy. Others do not, such as NK and Satmar
690260630306160644 2016-01-21 19:52:13 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum it's complicated. Judaism's goal since the exile of 70 CE is to return to "Zion". That's the spiritual manifest.
690251515941015552 2016-01-21 19:16:00 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @peteraltbaum @ColonialMars problem is that anti-Zionists think the neturei karta and them are on the same page. Far from the truth.
690251023873642496 2016-01-21 19:14:02 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @peteraltbaum @ColonialMars not quite. They want a king annointed by God and the 3rd temple to be built on the Temple Mount
690249657109385216 2016-01-21 19:08:37 UTC <DemotionAntonym> @ColonialMars @peteraltbaum I do. They are anti the secular government. They are not anti living in the holy land.
