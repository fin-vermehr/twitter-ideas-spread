943326330661277696 2017-12-19 03:44:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NotThatJonesy Appreciate it! Some people think baseball is boring, but I love it more than most people.
943323546528419840 2017-12-19 03:33:54 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> You are too cool for taking time to explain! Im going doing some reading and maybe find some video. I kinda dig it.
943204131057041408 2017-12-19 19:39:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NotThatJonesy All of it. I have so much to learn.

943063869890719744 2017-12-19 10:22:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Watching Big Bash League cricket. Im so confused.
943012162074828800 2017-12-18 06:56:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NotThatJonesy There are gifs for Pandoras box. Im sure of it.
943009513606656000 2017-12-18 06:46:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Waiting to see how peeps @ you gifs
942940027931234305 2017-12-18 02:09:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TheAlexNevil And your 40s 
942903289712082944 2017-12-18 23:43:57 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 @doctorwho_dat Thank you! It was so worth the wait and all the color samples.
942620768789319680 2017-12-17 05:01:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat @KAREN698 Thanks! Ive decided to use this everywhere downstairs (except tv room) and up the stairway. The fireplace is in transition. Will do!
942561025211150336 2017-12-17 01:03:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat Ok so I think you can get the idea. All my trim is white. First 2 pics are bright afternoon sunlight. It feels a little darker and cozy in the evening (third pic). More pics when the fireplace remodel is done!pic.twitter.com/idfsYGV1e2

941949554194370560 2017-12-16 08:34:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau Thats great. I read blogs to get really good at couponing to stretch my money for food donations. Knowing people are hungry or cold makes me so sad. We do what we can.
941945819208540160 2017-12-16 08:19:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau I remember seeing your pics. Youre right. Its so frustrating.

941940535425724416 2017-12-15 07:58:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau I understand that sentiment. The political climate keeps me somewhere between hopelessness and rage. Doing something locally via the food banks and meals on wheels is my outlet.
941938882597326848 2017-12-15 07:51:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau I know youre slogging through tough stuff, Sarah. It will get easier and Im here cheering you for you every day until it does. So many years the holidays are a just blur of sadness for me. Depression has given me a bit of a reprieve this year and Im filled with gratitude.
941933705995702272 2017-12-15 07:31:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Its 2:30 and Im awake handwriting Christmas cards.

936379139933827073 2017-11-30 23:39:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @thesmilinggoat You are one of the best things about Twitter. The news is always terrible, but then there will be a tweet from you - positive, encouraging - to no one special, just to anyone who sees it. I should have said it before now. I do appreciate you, Goat!
935624277717635072 2017-11-28 21:39:45 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic @tinyelvisbkwd @doctorwho_dat @CaffeineAndHate @RFStew @tearsonurcheek

934625944035364865 2017-11-25 03:32:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> There is nothing in the world I want enough to sleep in a tent outside a big box store.
934225748147220480 2017-11-24 01:02:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Time for the Grinch, everybody!
933920782664814593 2017-11-23 04:50:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @lisamcguire1 Truth.

933904787317444608 2017-11-23 03:47:07 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno This is totally believable. You are a delight, my friend!  
933904382021832704 2017-11-23 03:45:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Wieneraaron Shawshank Redemption
933881155660795904 2017-11-23 02:13:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno I just had leftovers and getting ready for my second round of desserts for the day. 
933840461906800645 2017-11-23 23:31:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @SheJStaz My moms 19 year old cat, Quincy, was a riot. Hes lost most of his hearing so he just wanders around meowing really loudly. 
933805472746016769 2017-11-23 21:12:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Hey @SheJStaz we had a nice conversation during dinner about the complicated real history of this holiday. I thought of you and hoped youre having a nice day.
933794825895317504 2017-11-23 20:30:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> So much post feast snoring. #Thanksgiving

933435927774470144 2017-11-22 20:44:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat Doing the living room myself. Letting a pro do the hall and up the stairs. My clumsy ass on a ladder with paint? Nope! 
933433610937528320 2017-11-22 20:34:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat Update: Sherwin Williams light French gray is happening in the living room today. Trim is white. Fingers crossed! 
933252737826922497 2017-11-22 08:36:06 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> At least my insomnia kept me from missing out on that sweet Aussie swear.
933201607906549760 2017-11-21 05:12:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Natural selection is good tv.
932699771596427265 2017-11-20 19:58:48 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic Indeed. A patriotic, cross-dressin, nazi hatin hero.

932473501046509568 2017-11-19 04:59:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I should follow more Aussies. I need more rugby commentary in my life.
932473057012273153 2017-11-19 04:57:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Haha. How do you guys put up with all our sports tweets?
932471810469367808 2017-11-19 04:52:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Realizing I follow a lot people from Philly.
932435937015066624 2017-11-19 02:30:25 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Its my happy place for sure.
932433901154439168 2017-11-19 02:22:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay I stopped being able to keep up physically around 12 or 13. My dad still played on a team so I traveled with them to manage equipment and keep score. I loved it!
932431705545302016 2017-11-19 02:13:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay I sure thought I could!
932430934980382720 2017-11-19 02:10:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Ah ok. Well, wouldnt want to injure that arm. I was so jealous of my cousins playing baseball. No coed teams in a small town back in the day. The coach let me practice with them though and I thought I was hot stuff lol
932428344284581890 2017-11-19 02:00:15 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Very Canadian lol awesome

932426553891393537 2017-11-19 01:53:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay No doubt. Do you skate?
932425466127974400 2017-11-19 01:48:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay I would still love to see a live game though. Ive never been!

932423830114652160 2017-11-19 01:42:19 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay This is me talking about hockey 
932419025715580929 2017-11-19 01:23:13 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @ResplendentElk Sure. Just consider me a friendly face in the crowd.
932389881229299716 2017-11-19 23:27:25 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @ResplendentElk Too many do. Its an issue close to my heart. If youre feeling low just @ me. Im around.
932378778680033280 2017-11-19 22:43:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Its hard to ask for help with mental illness. It can be even harder for men. You dont have to struggle alone. I understand - so many of us understand. Please reach out 1-800-273-8255 (National Suicide Prevention Hotline) or http://nami.org #InternationalMensDay
932130163072163842 2017-11-18 06:15:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I imagine thats a riot!
932101943727673344 2017-11-18 04:23:15 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat That show is so crazy.  In other news, I bought gray paint sample #6 today. Im in paint color choice hell!

932071346280062976 2017-11-18 02:21:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay I love the dressing, mashed potatoes, and rolls carb coma.
932070440297787393 2017-11-18 02:18:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Yep. I dont love turkey, but I sure enjoy everything else. lol

932067587005014017 2017-11-18 02:06:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Hope thats not why shes the ex lol Seriously though I bought little sample #6 today. One wall of my living room is a weird gray checkerboard!
932065105566715904 2017-11-18 01:56:52 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @GenXtremist Heh! I love it! #BeAUnicorn
932061647736332288 2017-11-18 01:43:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Of all the things Ive been through in my life, finding the right shade of gray paint is going to be what ends me.
931997678438895621 2017-11-18 21:28:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno @TheCheekys Hahahaha!
931996845135589376 2017-11-18 21:25:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate There is always a random word unnecessarily capitalized.
931819695610658816 2017-11-18 09:41:42 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TheCheekys @aidno Nice choice. *heading for the kitchen*
931818099388698624 2017-11-18 09:35:21 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KaceyecaK @efoxband Such a clever game! Have a great weekend!
931817439578476544 2017-11-18 09:32:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TheCheekys @aidno Well thats excellent timing. Anything on it?
931816889818501120 2017-11-18 09:30:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KaceyecaK @efoxband I logged on late and was like wtf? my TL was nothing but polls. Then I saw it was just my fav rodents making merry! Sorry I missed this one. You guys are the BEST!
931814820034179072 2017-11-18 09:22:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Does this mean its time for a proper English breakfast? @aidno @TheCheekyspic.twitter.com/MxHauwrQFK
931813550271750145 2017-11-18 09:17:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @walmartswarrior 
931810623142486016 2017-11-18 09:05:39 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Quinntessence_ Exactly! Im already jonesing for baseball. Been watching the Arizona Fall League and some classic games online.
931809286459658240 2017-11-18 09:00:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Hanging in there, @sarahekite? 
931808641677774849 2017-11-18 08:57:47 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Just saw that Gabby Douglas tweet. Oh girl no.
931808136255688710 2017-11-18 08:55:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Quinntessence_ Im a huge Votto fan so I was really disappointed. I expected him to win Silver Slugger and not the MVP.  Winning neither for this awesome season blows.
931804294302650370 2017-11-18 08:40:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Cant sleep. Whos up?
931474950753521666 2017-11-17 10:51:48 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Hey good lookin whatcha got cooking? (there is a gif for everything)
931359985417773057 2017-11-16 03:14:59 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @JaysFromCouch I like it, too. The sometimes forced swearing is funny to me.
931358397101993984 2017-11-16 03:08:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Truth! lol I thought of you earlier while putting chips on my sandwich.
931357772456882181 2017-11-16 03:06:11 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Blech. Everything about today can kiss my ass.
931344406082412544 2017-11-16 02:13:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno 
931339545358032897 2017-11-16 01:53:45 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> He was ALWAYS kind to me. We bonded via clinical depression and share a morbid sense of humor. I love his heart for giant dogs, his friends, and his dearest @needleshunt #WhyImissGnurbs
931330989426659329 2017-11-16 01:19:45 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CincyRedsTalk Thanks for posting this one. Im bitter.
931303242465730560 2017-11-16 23:29:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Joey Votto is always the MVP in my heart. Love you @Reds
931284544900288512 2017-11-16 22:15:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tinyelvisbkwd @viewfrommyoffic I know theyre gross, but I have one (*cough* or more) every year. Its so weird. I never ever eat the burgers. Help me?
930997645002395648 2017-11-15 03:15:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Haha! Awesome. I do that with burgers cooked on a grill. Charcoal burgers with chips means summer.
930995674476314625 2017-11-15 03:07:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Mmm bacon. I almost always put chips on cold sandwiches. Love the crunch!
930991784473264129 2017-11-15 02:51:53 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Yes, tasty! How was the BLT?
930990148971630593 2017-11-15 02:45:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Sounds good to me. We got the All Dressed flavor here recently. Ill keep you posted on the Roast Chicken hunt lol
930988107767451650 2017-11-15 02:37:16 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Ok so your pic popped up in my ICYMI. Roast Chicken chips are a thing? Going to be on the prowl to find and try those!
930931826717265925 2017-11-15 22:53:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @needleshunt Youre so welcome. Love to you both. 
930923748840091648 2017-11-15 22:21:32 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @needleshunt please tell Gnurb thank you for being so kind to me. He always understood my depression. He is missed!
930902370019696640 2017-11-15 20:56:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Home_Halfway Ive been there, Michael! Heres my kitty and puppy holding hands during a nap.pic.twitter.com/amWGeSdEQC

930657571123449858 2017-11-14 04:43:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat @ShyHoodieGirl Shell be back. She loves us too much.
930655390177660928 2017-11-14 04:35:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Missing @doctorwho_dat. Theres a sarcasm with pretty face sized hole in my Twitter world.
930637572698755072 2017-11-14 03:24:22 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @HoorayBacon 
930606733386493952 2017-11-14 01:21:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AustinGooderNN Oh not sure. Im in the States. I hope it works out for you.
930605577637711872 2017-11-14 01:17:14 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MissStaceyMay Grab your tissues and comfort snacks. The music is so good!   Seriously? Seriously.
930604230792146951 2017-11-14 01:11:53 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MissStaceyMay @kateefeldman @AustinGooderNN Hulu has (or had) Private Practice.
930584382859042816 2017-11-14 23:53:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate Bernie Bernstein. Seriously? 
930574841622810629 2017-11-14 23:15:06 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay This tweet makes me happy.
930317213810286592 2017-11-13 06:11:22 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @EvolvedGuppy Happy Birthday, Dr J! Hope you have a wonderful day. 
930315920127520769 2017-11-13 06:06:14 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @viewfrommyoffic @doctorwho_dat @SilipigniMario @tearsonurcheek @CaffeineAndHate Agreed. Love it on veggies and pita chips.
930272704648876032 2017-11-13 03:14:31 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> These stories coming out of Alabama make my skin crawl.
930164631385137152 2017-11-13 20:05:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Yikes. So during peak earning years when your student loans are paid off and your children are less financially dependent they want to make it harder to save?https://twitter.com/topherspiro/status/930077974342389760
929939072092721153 2017-11-12 05:08:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Oh no doubt!
929933815031705601 2017-11-12 04:47:53 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Thats fun news!
929897346837762049 2017-11-12 02:22:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> So people breaking coffeemakers is a thing now? But, you already bought it. They already have your money.
929886090286239744 2017-11-12 01:38:15 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats Oh dear
929880132734586880 2017-11-12 01:14:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @BitchestheCat We loved her, too.
929275009616445440 2017-11-11 09:10:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Weve already sealed our fate, AA. Were both coming back as turtles with loose morals.
929230827933917184 2017-11-10 06:14:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau Ive been to New Orleans once and it was an absolute blast. My bday is also in March.
929229990142578688 2017-11-10 06:11:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Netjeretkhau @sarahekite Hitting more ballparks is always a good plan.
929229382266310658 2017-11-10 06:08:43 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite @Netjeretkhau I always feel sad and a little lost the day after the WS ends, but this year it was so much worse.
929228094636003329 2017-11-10 06:03:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Oh I certainly do! Sports emotions are powerful.
929227338650411009 2017-11-10 06:00:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @HoorayBacon Ours was in the kitchen on the wall, too. If Mom pulled a chair over from the table we knew it was Auntie Martine on the line.
929225812343173120 2017-11-10 05:54:32 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Thats fantastic.
929224790174502912 2017-11-10 05:50:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @HoorayBacon I remember doing this and on a rotary phone!
929223901502169088 2017-11-10 05:46:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Also, thanks for turning me on to Headspace.
929223638838054912 2017-11-10 05:45:54 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite I hate hearing this so much! Remember I care even when Im not around. Glad youre finding some solace.
929221384689061888 2017-11-10 05:36:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Thats a sad story.  Sorry, S 
929220208430141441 2017-11-10 05:32:16 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats @norcalbbgm Just 3? lol
929219528810221568 2017-11-10 05:29:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @norcalbbgm @MLBRandomStats Yes! Absolutely amazes me.
929218953192361984 2017-11-10 05:27:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats @norcalbbgm Yes, but thats not to say I wouldnt be thrilled to have a team with Goldy at 1B. Hes a fantastic player. I just think Votto had the better case for Silver Slugger this year.
929217117362192384 2017-11-10 05:19:59 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @norcalbbgm @MLBRandomStats Thanks for the link.
929215807917363200 2017-11-10 05:14:47 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @norcalbbgm @MLBRandomStats Yeah, my Billy Hamilton OBP prayers just havent being working! Exciting when he gets on, but frustrating as hell when hes popping up balls to shallow OF.
929213990789672961 2017-11-10 05:07:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats @norcalbbgm Thats awesome.
929213638329724928 2017-11-10 05:06:09 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats @norcalbbgm IMHO not for judging individual performance. Cant drive guys in if theyre not on base.
929209066169274368 2017-11-10 04:47:59 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MLBRandomStats @norcalbbgm What is skewed? Also, RBIs & runs scored. Seriously?

921444617501007873 2017-10-20 18:34:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay THIS. I dont understand not learning all you can. Analytics are just another way to study and lose yourself in the game you love.
921216145318907905 2017-10-19 03:26:59 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Sorry, ghibby. Cubs will be right back in it again no doubt!

921181597919076352 2017-10-19 01:09:42 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Im not a fan of lopsided playoff games.
921180989610758144 2017-10-19 01:07:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Ouch
921174415328661505 2017-10-19 00:41:09 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @whatuphohm I wondered this out loud, but didnt want to tweet it to Cubs fans friends. Sucks to be frustrated with the lineup.

920502955681468417 2017-10-17 04:13:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate That is just wrong!
920496643178487808 2017-10-17 03:47:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Thats right! NLCS against the Mets. Think about Bryant - ROY, MVP, WS. They must be physically and emotionally exhausted.
920495328041762816 2017-10-17 03:42:42 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @The_Road_Guy Heh! Now thats all I will see.
920494879729430529 2017-10-17 03:40:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay No doubt. I would imagine going deep into the playoffs two years in a row would feel like you had been playing non-stop.

920493559798779908 2017-10-17 03:35:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay See them a lot (cause Reds). SP was definitely not dominant like in 2016. It was like the team really didnt get rolling until the 2nd half.
920491040389332994 2017-10-17 03:25:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay You nailed it.

906249163184201728 2017-09-08 20:13:32 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> This thread is why I talk openly about my depression. It's scientifically inaccurate & adds to stigma. You are not to blame for your disease https://twitter.com/cobratate/status/905768225023123460

905946706310778881 2017-09-07 00:11:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @JDWilkinsonII Glad they have insurance - not that it makes potentially losing your home ok.

892198291345158144 2017-07-31 01:40:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tinyelvisbkwd @MarcusBeaubier @CaffeineAndHate @tearsonurcheek Yeah. Yuck. I love all things Big Red Machine and Reds history. Pete personally, not so much.

891122903860817921 2017-07-28 02:27:11 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @efoxband @KaceyecaK @JDWilkinsonII JD! 
891011878729764864 2017-07-28 19:06:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic Spent most of my career in law enforcement. The clapping and cheering makes me sick to my stomach. I don't even know what to say.
891009990487674880 2017-07-28 18:58:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat We have the same sense of humor. Bad is so good!

890812681082421248 2017-07-27 05:54:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CarlDietrich My loathing is deep and long-standing.
890811939994992640 2017-07-27 05:51:31 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @donholley0 HE IS THE WORST.
890810644932378624 2017-07-27 05:46:22 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Mitch McConnell looks so miserable. This pleases me.
890809891857637376 2017-07-27 05:43:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I've never been so happy to be wrong.  Let the happy thankful tears flow!https://twitter.com/daiseydoesit/status/890765479266177025
890806696578138112 2017-07-27 05:30:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> OMG I'm literally crying. 
890806325894041601 2017-07-27 05:29:13 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> What did he say?????
890767171361665026 2017-07-27 02:53:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @donholley0 I respect his military service, but that's where it ends.
890765479266177025 2017-07-27 02:46:54 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> John McCain will likely never face another election. He could vote NO tonight if he really wanted. But, he won't. This is breaking me.
890748878038999040 2017-07-27 01:40:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Hahaha, er um Hohoho 
890748255633637376 2017-07-27 01:38:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I really thought you were going to say Santa Claus! 
890706162424958980 2017-07-27 22:51:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @tearsonurcheek @CaffeineAndHate I see he has stolen Lance's moves 
890668016953729024 2017-07-27 20:19:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay So you missed the "yell obscenities at your tv" part lol
890666330793287680 2017-07-27 20:12:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay This game was emotionally exhausting! Woo hoo!
890655390517542913 2017-07-27 19:29:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Absolutely!
890653772426354688 2017-07-27 19:23:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno How lucky you are to have someone explain your tweet for you. 
890439660601839616 2017-07-26 05:12:13 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate @tearsonurcheek Good point.
890426478483124225 2017-07-26 04:19:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Yep!
890425970657767424 2017-07-26 04:17:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay This was so great!  Well, except the obvious #umpshow.

890381053730447360 2017-07-26 01:19:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate @tearsonurcheek That's a bad look. I don't know if this was always who Price was and I just didn't see it, but he seems different in Boston.
890326136269533186 2017-07-26 21:41:07 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @lisamcguire1 Let's drink our way through the healthcare debate.

888102844024401920 2017-07-20 18:26:32 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic  I keep a list. Thinking maybe coffee table book someday.
888102208113389571 2017-07-20 18:24:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic Indeed! I'll put it next to "Finding semen on a penis is like finding fur on a dog" ~ quotes from my crime lab
888099489256546304 2017-07-20 18:13:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic I'm going to cross stitch this on a pillow! Fantastic!
887872926359461889 2017-07-19 03:12:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @ForwardKy @cattleprod You're right. I literally broke down when I called @RandPaul to tell my story. He's unmoved, but we continue to call and write. Thanks.
887791439769477120 2017-07-19 21:49:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @emilydoessports That's a great picture. I wish her the best!

887740644097241103 2017-07-19 18:27:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tearsonurcheek Another cutie! I don't know if I've ever seen another kitty like her.

887738882346954754 2017-07-19 18:20:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> What a gorgeous cat! Sounds like a lovable pest. 
887541974957514753 2017-07-18 05:17:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AuntCole22 So precious! Congratulations to you!

887522638968606721 2017-07-18 04:01:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tearsonurcheek Aww. That's great! I'm sure he's a barrel of laughs just like Harvey. It's been a long time since we've had a kitten in the house.
887519397962764288 2017-07-18 03:48:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tearsonurcheek We have matching kittens! Harvey is around 8 weeks. We'll have to see how much they look alike as they grow.
887518825855537153 2017-07-18 03:45:52 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @1CynicalCyborg Thank you. Doing ok. I understand the frustrations of chronic health concerns so if you're ever having one of those days... I'm around. 
887513903839817728 2017-07-18 03:26:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @thejaysnation @ateDARYL Same.
887513744053608448 2017-07-18 03:25:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @1CynicalCyborg Ooof! I should have tagged you on the cat tweet. Sorry! Hope you're doing well and feeling ok.
887513342708940801 2017-07-18 03:24:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic Did you see the WH press release? They spelled his name wrong. The incompetence makes my head hurt.
887512730785247232 2017-07-18 03:21:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic There really is an old tweet for everything.
887507803992203264 2017-07-18 03:02:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Ktibbo20 Thank you!
887507690796314625 2017-07-18 03:01:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Night, AA!
887505573461274624 2017-07-18 02:53:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Hope you get some 
887505006357872642 2017-07-18 02:50:57 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno You'll be the first to know if I get his antics on video. 
887502263471796224 2017-07-18 02:40:03 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Coincidentally, that was his nickname at the rescue because he was trouble! 
887499660587388928 2017-07-18 02:29:42 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Thanks. You are correct. Dee lives here almost all the time so I count her as mine. This kitten already cuddles with Perry.
887498439164088324 2017-07-18 02:24:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @ANGRYref 
887498232489750528 2017-07-18 02:24:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MisophonicSpree I am so far gone!
887498053690806274 2017-07-18 02:23:19 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier Thanks. Indeed.
887497904650366976 2017-07-18 02:22:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @ANGRYref Thanks. I love that you're a hardcore cat man who appreciates the adorable.

887485353485099008 2017-07-18 01:32:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 So far so good!
887484402011385858 2017-07-18 01:29:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 I do! The kitten is fascinated by Owen (big fluffy). Clive is typically uninterested.

887482254485835777 2017-07-18 01:20:32 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Thank you. He's so stinking cute I can hardly stand it!

886107604128333828 2017-07-14 06:18:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @lin1442 @aidno She certainly was, AA.
886097475945340929 2017-07-14 05:37:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Absolutely. It has taken years to make peace with it.
886096080676564995 2017-07-14 05:32:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Indeed. Given what you know about my history, well, you can imagine kid me was convinced I was going to burn. So. Much. Therapy.
886094333534928896 2017-07-14 05:25:26 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Wow. Do I ever relate to this conversation *sigh*

885664907613675520 2017-07-13 00:59:03 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @tearsonurcheek @CaffeineAndHate I like it in terms of team control. Don't know enough about Cubs' farm system to know if it's good deal, prospect wise. So what ghibby says.

883528508147945472 2017-07-07 03:29:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Explains your thoughtful writing! Art history ended up being a fav. Every class was a mini vacation to another time or somewhere beautiful.
883526056904466433 2017-07-07 03:20:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Did you study philosophy? I ended up taking art history & literature courses for my humanities reqs. Oh, and Spanish.

883136385154199553 2017-07-06 01:31:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Absolutely. So glad I took that side trip when I had the chance.
882748620608614401 2017-07-05 23:50:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Ditto. I refuse to click on anything that appears to be Kardashian related.

882450101066756097 2017-07-04 04:04:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MooseChuckleTag @JDWilkinsonII I would have laughed, too. Around here a milk bag is part of a cow.

882441913005166592 2017-07-04 03:32:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TimeTravelnMan Are we being asked to block someone new because of twitter drama?

877026542349668352 2017-06-19 04:53:16 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @sarahekite Exactly! It's infuriating! 
877025417496014848 2017-06-19 04:48:48 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @sarahekite Very descriptive. HE IS THE WORST. The hypocrisy on display right now makes my head throb with anger. AHCA is ironically bad for my health.

876631105100709888 2017-06-18 02:41:57 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay No matter what time or who's playing, if I'm watching a game I know you'll be watching it, too. Baseball is life. 
876610344176807937 2017-06-18 01:19:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @D2_Derpinator I understand. A couple of cool reveal moments stood out, but it doesn't have the heightened tension of the early seasons.
876606848744529920 2017-06-18 01:05:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @D2_Derpinator Yeah. It feels different watching it post-Trump. Did you finish S5?

875911919001096192 2017-06-16 03:04:09 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Just saw the catcher's throw hit the bat on the back swing for the second time in my life. #Astros #RedSox
875908154852298754 2017-06-16 02:49:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Netjeretkhau Mine too. He's the most chill man I've ever known. Never talked to me like I was 'just a kid' even when I was one.

875548859333832704 2017-06-15 03:01:29 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Aww. Is that your doggo that was briefly lost during ST?
875548149896671232 2017-06-15 02:58:40 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahkendzior @MarkArkham I have memories of running around in the dark trying to catch them. It was the last way to play before having to come inside for the night.

874739836355321856 2017-06-13 21:26:43 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CarlDietrich It was Klu Klux Keebler that finally broke me.
874738269791166465 2017-06-13 21:20:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno You have summarized the situation perfectly.

874735001484570624 2017-06-13 21:07:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Agreed. The verbal fellatio on display at yesterday's Cabinet meeting was exhibit A.

874726210215059456 2017-06-13 20:32:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Oh, Tom Cotton.  #SessionsHearing
874725058215911425 2017-06-13 20:28:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> It's so frustrating when you can determine a senator's party affiliation just by listening to their questions. #SessionsHearing
874717256323919872 2017-06-13 19:57:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I really try to be above making fun of someone's physical appearance. I admit I have failed miserably with Jeff Sessions.

874413832680198145 2017-06-12 23:51:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AndrewStoeten I also wonder if the "first baseman" threw him at all.
874407895349198849 2017-06-12 23:27:42 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @wickterrell I'm not sure why I encourage you, but I always do.
874401285134536704 2017-06-12 23:01:26 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay If the tickets are available? 
874140863865257984 2017-06-11 05:46:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @dougdirt24 Wow. Just wow.
874139543481483264 2017-06-11 05:41:22 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate  Klu Klux Keebler is another fav 
874129174990139398 2017-06-11 05:00:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NorcoSlinger Same here. In the winter I always watch it completely over from the beginning. There are always more interesting little tidbits to find.
874126982614855680 2017-06-11 04:51:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NorcoSlinger Absolutely! I told myself that I wouldn't binge it, but there I was at 3am 
874125487936851968 2017-06-11 04:45:31 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 Aww
874124646039400448 2017-06-11 04:42:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @NorcoSlinger I finished HOC a few days ago and can't stop thinking about it.
874121570557587457 2017-06-11 04:29:57 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Anyone already binged all of House of Cards S5?
874120604613476352 2017-06-11 04:26:07 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @dumbbeezie 
874120114878205953 2017-06-11 04:24:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> So relatable. Hugs!
874119449590235137 2017-06-11 04:21:31 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Have folks actually read Julius Caesar? It's a cautionary tale. Also, short memories. When Obama was POTUS an AA actor was cast as Caesar.
874038194483974145 2017-06-11 22:58:39 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Well this has been less than ideal. #Reds
874002301618458624 2017-06-11 20:36:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Dodgers @Reds @sarahekite Yes! That was exciting!
874000948867342336 2017-06-11 20:30:39 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @nta71 Same. I kept thinking hot start, but it's June!
874000102062530562 2017-06-11 20:27:17 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Dodgers @Reds @sarahekite You look fabulous! 
873999683299008512 2017-06-11 20:25:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @nta71 It's kinda ridiculous.
873962642808995841 2017-06-11 17:58:26 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Glad you're enjoying yourself!
873962397031157760 2017-06-11 17:57:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite I'll be watching! 
873771412854644736 2017-06-10 05:18:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Was. Iglesias. Available.  #Reds
873760964360982528 2017-06-10 04:37:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite Love the kicks, Kiddo!
873760576677306368 2017-06-10 04:35:29 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @sarahekite having fun? I need to scan your tweets and check out your adventures.
873751993436839936 2017-06-10 04:01:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AuntCole22 Aww. Well, it's certainly easy to be kind to you gals!
873748648080920577 2017-06-10 03:48:05 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AuntCole22 Thank you! I just try to be kind. I certainly fall short sometimes, but I try. 
873745456941215744 2017-06-10 03:35:24 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @AuntCole22 I wish you a healthy and comfortable (as possible) final few weeks until you welcome your baby. Congrats!
873741847071535104 2017-06-10 03:21:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat I'm on the same plan.
873741009712291840 2017-06-10 03:17:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @redlegnation @dotsonc OBP  Not everyone needs to hit bombs.
873704453769093121 2017-06-10 00:52:29 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tearsonurcheek @CaffeineAndHate  legit lol'd there. Seriously though this is a bad idea.
873674368131510274 2017-06-10 22:52:56 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Dadpression Your expression is everything.
873673422479523841 2017-06-10 22:49:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Yes! The 'I Love Butter' bot just retweeted it. There really is a bot for everything! 
873672424595886080 2017-06-10 22:45:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay It's milk, flour, butter, and Gruyre cheese or white cheddar. So cheesy!
873653560415834112 2017-06-10 21:30:15 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @GlennWiens That's absolutely lovely, but seems inadvisable. 
873650288128872449 2017-06-10 21:17:14 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tinyelvisbkwd @doctorwho_dat @viewfrommyoffic @CaffeineAndHate @tearsonurcheek Have you seen the pics from their gathering in Texas? Armed pepe cosplay is so alpha. 
873641311043284992 2017-06-10 20:41:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tearsonurcheek @CaffeineAndHate @roo_44 *slowly steps away*

873603299047600128 2017-06-10 18:10:31 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Dogs unleashed sounds like a great party. Just watch where you step! 
873579706137944064 2017-06-10 16:36:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @HoorayBacon This made my day! You're so welcome.
873405463890714625 2017-06-09 05:04:24 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate That looks like cake batter. There's only one way to clean it. Raw eggs be damned!

873361587872182272 2017-06-09 02:10:03 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 @vasego1 Heh!
873360499370602496 2017-06-09 02:05:43 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 We have a good time!
873358922937229313 2017-06-09 01:59:28 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KAREN698 The Reds scored 10 runs in 4th so they mercy-rule'd us. Lost 18-8! We all had hot dogs & ice cream anyway! So, my rep is still intact.

873330476144099328 2017-06-09 00:06:25 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @dotsonc Thanks. Young pitching is, to me, simultaneously super exciting and frustrating. Still a fun time to be a Reds fan!
873327551938260992 2017-06-09 23:54:48 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @dotsonc I keep telling myself he's young & he'll figure out the zone. Am I being naive? Used to wonder about him being a starter, now any role?
873322913054818305 2017-06-09 23:36:22 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> This Little League game is 2 hrs old. It's top of 3rd. Hangry. Pondering creative ways to get thrown out.
873308182977839104 2017-06-09 22:37:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Anythingpork Welcome! I can appreciate the time and attention. You should post pics.
873306504316805120 2017-06-09 22:31:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Anythingpork That's so baseball. Nice.
873306070961311744 2017-06-09 22:29:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @murraypolitics @aidno So we were right about the pets, AA?
873303661178490883 2017-06-09 22:19:52 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic You're killing me, Smalls! 
873301134999527428 2017-06-09 22:09:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Bill_TPA Hey! This is a nice development. I'll be sure to check it out. Congrats!
873299986578108416 2017-06-09 22:05:16 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @tworsandtwols Look at these! So fun!  @BlueJaysDad @Every5thDay @JaysFromCouch @MarcusBeaubier
873298841860276228 2017-06-09 22:00:43 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Bill_TPA @tworsandtwols Jays fan here. Those are great. 
873287989937532933 2017-06-09 21:17:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> So many major news stories! I actually forgot that Bill Cosby is on trial for sexual assault this week.
873281023416692736 2017-06-09 20:49:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @SheJStaz This thread 
873273882991624192 2017-06-09 20:21:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @viewfrommyoffic Read about this yesterday. Another move that makes me frightened for us all. This Adminstration, this Congress, is bad for my mental health.
873264008056459264 2017-06-09 19:42:18 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CincyRedsTalk Sweet! Agreed. He deserves to start!

873000671699750912 2017-06-08 02:15:54 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TheCheekys @doctorwho_dat Yes, we need commentary.
872989185212284929 2017-06-08 01:30:15 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Balance is important. And finally we raise one for the slurtles and whortoises!
872986251716112389 2017-06-08 01:18:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Maybe it's best to save some of the beers for *after* the singing.
872983854436540416 2017-06-08 01:09:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno B Double E Double R U N  
872983039248404480 2017-06-08 01:05:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> All the focus was on Comey today, but I'm really worried about the healthcare bill, guys. Serious consequences.
872982119429156865 2017-06-08 01:02:11 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno The movie adaptation would be epic. Juxtaposition of our accents alone = comedy gold. On the soundtrack, 'Beer Run'
872974769876029441 2017-06-08 00:32:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Another entry in the voluminous Widgety Dubob letters 
872973151793270785 2017-06-08 00:26:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Haha! I just realized I was leaving UKMoments tagged on these ridiculous reptilian puns.
872934147370733569 2017-06-08 21:51:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno I guess you have to be willing to shell it out for the whortoises. 
872931250230751233 2017-06-08 21:40:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Slurtles huh. How about whortoises? 
872929227821248514 2017-06-08 21:32:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno $20 and a handful of lettuce says you could be right

872921538118471681 2017-06-08 21:01:27 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno It's so bad here I'm ready to let the pets take over. Exception: turtles of questionable moral character

872910683964354562 2017-06-08 20:18:19 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @UKMoments @aidno Did you selfie at your polling place? 
872907486436741123 2017-06-08 20:05:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Today's Twitter is the unexpected overlap on a Venn diagram of political punditry and tentacle porn.
872879051249250304 2017-06-08 18:12:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @TommyZee81 I fav'd this because I can relate. I've been battling depression for years. Glad you're still here.
872857290835144705 2017-06-08 16:46:09 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Hahaha! We would pay down the national debt!
872856203432427520 2017-06-08 16:41:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @doctorwho_dat McCain's questioning made absolutely no sense! Not even just republican obfuscation - actual nonsense.
872855107758641157 2017-06-08 16:37:29 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Is John McCain having a stroke?   Am I having a stroke?   What is he babbling about?   #ComeyHearings
872839971245371392 2017-06-08 15:37:20 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> The opportunities for cherry-picking this testimony are vast. #ComeyHearing
872837865683783680 2017-06-08 15:28:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Did Comey just say "no fuzz on that"? That's a new one for me. #ComeyHearing
872834708866039808 2017-06-08 15:16:25 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @MarcusBeaubier @CaffeineAndHate @tearsonurcheek Agreed. If you don't always follow the team it's confusing. Who is that guy?!
872833627897421825 2017-06-08 15:12:08 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Sounds nice. The news here is exhausting every single day!
872829560877961216 2017-06-08 14:55:58 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno I like that policy. Will you know the results tonight?

865412990484365313 2017-05-18 03:45:10 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Hahahahahaha! Is that the "professional" who called for guys to get beaned? The same one who's basically been a whiny asshole?

865311861100740608 2017-05-18 21:03:19 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @CaffeineAndHate @desipiodotcom As a Reds fan, this also makes me laugh!
865299420237180933 2017-05-18 20:13:52 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Reds @rhcobb I'm waiting to see if Colon lines up to pitch!
865297958421618688 2017-05-18 20:08:04 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Wow. Twitter is awash in especially terrible takes today - politics, baseball, mental health. Sheesh.
865282880485953536 2017-05-18 19:08:09 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Really bummed for Freddie Freeman. #Braves

865084187606437888 2017-05-17 05:58:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Oh hell yeah you did! 
865083162992496640 2017-05-17 05:54:33 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Maddon (opposing team manager) used a baseball play called a squeeze against my team (the Reds). His team (Cubs) executes that play so well!
865082320583372801 2017-05-17 05:51:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Say it with your accent and it means whatever you want, J. 
865053291599855616 2017-05-17 03:55:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Well thank you!

864962138737172480 2017-05-17 21:53:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Did you see Kershaw just walk around everyone and head to the mound? lol

864293323745480705 2017-05-15 01:36:00 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Some people are so simple minded. Nuance is lost on them. It truly tests my patience.

864257016507904000 2017-05-15 23:11:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> A non-denial denial from McMaster?
863896920829431808 2017-05-14 23:20:51 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Oh no kidding!
863895658096451584 2017-05-14 23:15:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Indeed they do! NOT a Yankees fan, but I still enjoy seeing his teammates gathered. Respect for Jeter.
863890979211943937 2017-05-14 22:57:14 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno There really is a Simpson's gif for every occasion.
863888783598661633 2017-05-14 22:48:30 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno I've always suspected dentists of having a sadistic streak.
863886144504778752 2017-05-14 22:38:01 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Or dentists 
863845038014558209 2017-05-14 19:54:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @dotsonc It bugs me that he writes his opinion as "we". Lots of ways to enjoy baseball. Some of us enjoy the "sausage making" aspect, too. #spinrate
863597833466908673 2017-05-13 03:32:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @DarknessRandom You're not alone in your struggles. Please take care.

854059735909376000 2017-04-17 19:51:23 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Indeed. You guys get Feldman and Bronson Arroyo. Yes, that Bronson Arroyo. We have 3 SP on the DL 
854059092029177857 2017-04-17 19:48:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> When not on the DL! Amir Garrett is the lefty rookie to watch (Wed). Anxious to see him against a really potent lineup.
854056058142306306 2017-04-17 19:36:46 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KennySledge Visited Comerica for the first time this season. Really beautiful park!
854055140130738176 2017-04-17 19:33:07 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Haha. Well hello there! Hoping your birds don't set some kind of new HR record this week at GABP. It's uh, hitter friendly. #Reds
854054152942604289 2017-04-17 19:29:12 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @KennySledge 1. Just the Jays 2. Reds Will watch any game though because baseball.

853412307183030272 2017-04-15 00:58:44 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Indeed. Also strange to see Brandon Phillips in anything but red. It was time though and I'm happy it worked out for him.
853411035977572352 2017-04-15 00:53:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Every5thDay Balls flying out of there tonight. Thankfully not all off Dickey! Looks really nice.

850144043480866816 2017-04-06 00:31:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @cameronesposito @fadedtimes It's a popular insult among the alt-right crowd. Guys referring to themselves as "alpha males" *eye roll* seem to like using it, too.

822223843301478400 2017-01-19 23:26:55 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @D2_Derpinator @CaffeineAndHate Was called liberal elite (in Ky) bc I have a STEM degree & dared point out improved job numbers under Obama.

822197652825767936 2017-01-19 21:42:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Man who sexually assaulted me never faced justice, but at least he will never be praised & cheered by crowds. I feel sick. #WomensMarch

822185266735616004 2017-01-19 20:53:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> This news makes me sad. These programs also help victimized children and men. Everyone should care they are on the chopping block.https://twitter.com/rvawonk/status/822092216386678785

815025338728218624 2016-12-30 02:42:37 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @GlennF @CaffeineAndHate @SeanMcElwee Sadly, reading comprehension is not a skill everyone seeks to master.

812414568488202240 2016-12-23 21:48:21 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> The Christmas miracle is that my anxiety and I are wearing lipstick and en route to a party.
812221609838669824 2016-12-23 09:01:36 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno I was googling "turtles in dresses". More results than I expected.

812215828334739456 2016-12-23 08:38:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Now "Roxanne" is suddenly stuck in my head.
812214067884605444 2016-12-23 08:31:38 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno So you could say they're into mutt stuff?
812212601463701504 2016-12-23 08:25:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno I think that's one group I could still outrun. Turtles of the evening.
812212101649485824 2016-12-23 08:23:49 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @aidno Is that the lipstick emoji now? Looks more like dog penis. I don't remember it looking so um, anatomical before.

811797835431735296 2016-12-21 04:57:41 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> If you're constantly using sex trying to get RTs at least make the jokes funny. Otherwise you're just a creep.

732383394764591104 2016-05-16 01:33:02 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @Bill_TPA Got it. Did that prompt Ausmus' literal demonstration of plate coverage?
732381977064669185 2016-05-16 01:27:24 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> I don't know the whole story. I've been busy watching both the Reds & Jays get hosed. @Bill_TPA what's up @ Twins & Tigers?

731686684350414849 2016-05-14 03:24:34 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> Given the way the rule reads, I don't understand the need to slide.

696815981738512385 2016-02-08 22:00:50 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @_OneEyedFatMan_  Cornstarch: pies, pastries. Purer starch, thickens up quickly & stays clear for shiny filling! Flour can turn it "cloudy"
696815824913440769 2016-02-08 22:00:13 UTC <DaiseyDoesIt> @_OneEyedFatMan_  My Kentucky take... Flour: gravy, long cooking sauces. It has proteins which take longer to thicken and lose "raw" flavor
