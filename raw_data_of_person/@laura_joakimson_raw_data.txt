970420817069727744 2018-03-04 22:08:46 UTC <laura_joakimson> @odetteroulette @chekainformant Because I love my community. And I'm fighting for the rights of my neighbors because I want to. Not because someone on twitter shamed me
970420591671918592 2018-03-04 22:07:53 UTC <laura_joakimson> @odetteroulette @chekainformant I don't really care for someone on twitter telling me my moral standing according to your  principles of embedding. I live in Oakland
970415530828967937 2018-03-04 21:47:46 UTC <laura_joakimson> @odetteroulette @chekainformant I'm pointing out how condescending it sounds to embed in neighborhoods. People who love neighbors do work for systemic change. Ask Oakland.

951646246447456256 2018-01-11 02:45:20 UTC <laura_joakimson> @scroggstl @brayotte What?? That's not even coherent. You're accusing me of attacking women? Where? I'm asking u not to blame women for men's sexual choices.
951643202108272640 2018-01-11 02:33:14 UTC <laura_joakimson> @brayotte @scroggstl Oh JFC. You make a habit of blaming women for men's sexual predation. So gross and so wrong. You aren't aware of how to do feminism. Ugh.
951642646908256256 2018-01-11 02:31:02 UTC <laura_joakimson> @jodikantor @SamSanderson123 @ladyshep11 @brayotte Why don't you start reading books @ misogyny? Written by women. Who aren't to blame for their husbands' sins.
951641656645771264 2018-01-11 02:27:06 UTC <laura_joakimson> @jodikantor @SamSanderson123 @ladyshep11 @brayotte That's right wing talking point. HRC's only "trashing" private. Never public. A woman privately grieves. Is angry. Is sad. Is Not To Blame.
950714190028718081 2018-01-09 13:01:40 UTC <laura_joakimson> @deathrep @ggreenwald Greenwald, your accusations re my intentions don't matter. I can't judge your intentions either. I'm glad she's not forgotten. Fullstop.
950712884111163392 2018-01-09 12:56:29 UTC <laura_joakimson> @deathrep @ggreenwald Thank you for that third thing. I'm glad to hear it.
950528003921948672 2018-01-08 00:41:50 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep And I'm sorry to hear about your son.
950527113311895552 2018-01-08 00:38:18 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep I don't want her name to be forgotten in all the other tragedies happening in the world. Reality Leigh Winner.
950526923473534976 2018-01-08 00:37:33 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep And raises money for refugees.   I'm not attacking Greenwald but asking him to use his platform to help a girl who wanted to reach him.
950526643885375489 2018-01-08 00:36:26 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep I admire all of those things. I led a rebellion/strike on a cruise ship. I'm working to create a book that celebrates immigrants 1/2
950278342766292992 2018-01-08 08:09:46 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 It's not ok to blame Oprah for Weinstein's crimes. That's what page six people want u to do. Now get some sleep.
950278144413462529 2018-01-08 08:08:59 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @PoliticalSteve2 I like Gillibrand too. But stop being weird about a page six article.
950277963806793728 2018-01-08 08:08:16 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 You need to take down your resist sign and admit you're a Russian troll if you're accusing Oprah of being an accomplice to rape. Nope.
950277702900097024 2018-01-08 08:07:14 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 Are you a man?
950277645211639808 2018-01-08 08:07:00 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 You're worried WHAT is true?
950277522356289536 2018-01-08 08:06:31 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @PoliticalSteve2 You're saying you don't want a woman to run because of 2016 basically?
950277380831981568 2018-01-08 08:05:57 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 Oprah?
950277300964147202 2018-01-08 08:05:38 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @PoliticalSteve2 Concerned about what? Weinstein could have said "holy Mary mother of God..." That wouldn't mean Mary is in trouble.
950277006695911424 2018-01-08 08:04:28 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @kgoebel @PoliticalSteve2 What are you accusing Oprah of??  Did u read article? There's no there there as far as Oprah goes. Do u really think she was accomplice?
950276338627198976 2018-01-08 08:01:49 UTC <laura_joakimson> @PageSix @PoliticalSteve2 Um. Weinstein said Oprah's name. Oprah didn't do this. If you're a #resist person u shouldn't blame innocent women for men's crimes.
950260803860443136 2018-01-07 07:00:05 UTC <laura_joakimson> @zzpacker Wow. Nailed it. 
950260126975324160 2018-01-07 06:57:23 UTC <laura_joakimson> @marinaomi She was abused by mother and the bf who attacked her rival. I'm not sure if she knew beforehand @ plan.
950259588711948288 2018-01-07 06:55:15 UTC <laura_joakimson> @marinaomi She's famous because she was once a big villain. Now the story has become campy, and there are parts of her story people didn't know.

949707211592286208 2018-01-06 18:20:18 UTC <laura_joakimson> @CiroScotti This thread has said it for me. But ambition in women is not a crime. "Calculating" is considered a canny, wise quality. In men.

948109707335548928 2018-01-02 08:32:23 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep I'm as skeptical of Greenwald as he is if the DNC. Prove me wrong Glenn. Help Reality Leigh Winner in 2018. Don't abandon her.
948109214957715457 2018-01-02 08:30:26 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep She risked her freedom. 
948109135576313857 2018-01-02 08:30:07 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep Greenwald has his own army. You all/we all could help her.   Greenwald's skepticism about Russian hacking bothered her so much...
948108500088926208 2018-01-02 08:27:36 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep I'm a broke nobody. Greenwald has a platform that can help her. You find it easier to attack me than to ask Greenwald to help?
948108284816322560 2018-01-02 08:26:44 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @deathrep Oh. You're saying that you don't think Greenwald should be writing about her, keeping her name in the news or raising bail money?
948014333451124737 2018-01-01 02:13:25 UTC <laura_joakimson> @SenGillibrand Keep fighting for the rights of women, immigrants, & the planet. 
948013218022047744 2018-01-01 02:08:59 UTC <laura_joakimson> @SenGillibrand Thank you for doing all that you do Senator Gillibrand.  And happy 2018 fighting for this country.
948012061593931776 2018-01-01 02:04:23 UTC <laura_joakimson> @SenGillibrand @kurtresists So many angry white men. Bernie, Franken, or Trump. Don't get your way it's ?  How many centuries white male presidents? Never enough?
948011135483092993 2018-01-01 02:00:42 UTC <laura_joakimson> @SenGillibrand @kurtresists What a creepy comment. Must there  always be some a hole blaming a woman for men's sins? Even in 2018? Even on New Year's Day?  
947964050834538496 2018-01-01 22:53:36 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @HAyan744 @cosmos_griffin Hypocrisy is also Greenwald refusing to ever admit when he's wrong. Or when he's hurt someone.
947963785511178240 2018-01-01 22:52:33 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald @HAyan744 @cosmos_griffin Where is Reality Leigh Winner right now thanks to her efforts to get through to Glenn Greenwald about hacking? Has he forgotten her?
947962663232978944 2018-01-01 22:48:05 UTC <laura_joakimson> @ggreenwald Do you ever think about Reality Leigh Winner who is still sitting w/o bail in Trump's jail so she could tell the truth @ hacking to you?

947646547868631045 2017-12-31 01:51:58 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe In your community, does everyone repeat that lie? Does no one point out that lying is immoral?
947646214324994048 2017-12-31 01:50:38 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe More white people are killed by white people than by any other race. Address violence in your own community first.
947646000801263616 2017-12-31 01:49:47 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe I think everyone knows who neo Nazis are.   And no good person defends Nazis. Neo or the original bunch.

947642801415626752 2017-12-31 01:37:04 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe How many white people were killed by neo Nazis in 2017?  -1 in Charlottesville -2 in Virginia  -3 in Portland   Etc.
947642418114863105 2017-12-31 01:35:33 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe That's not addressing how to stop white men from committing most spree killing.
947642180885127168 2017-12-31 01:34:36 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe After you solve the problem of white crime including domestic violence and spree killing, then you can talk about Chicago.
947642040484954112 2017-12-31 01:34:03 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe You ignore white violence in Las Vegas. Why do you focus on black instead of white crime? Why not address your own community first?
947641815586422785 2017-12-31 01:33:09 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe That's definitely not true. He's Hawaiian. Where are your family from?
947641678017335296 2017-12-31 01:32:37 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe So you think white people are born superior?
947641522865893378 2017-12-31 01:32:00 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe You haven't provided any answer to white on white crime in Las Vegas. And around the country.
947641306989211648 2017-12-31 01:31:08 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe White men commit more domestic violence against white women.
947634169424703488 2017-12-31 01:02:46 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe Wrong that president Obama's mother is white? Or wrong about white on white violence? Look it up. It's true. Domestic violence.
947626313912786944 2017-12-31 00:31:33 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe For that matter President Obama's mother was white.
947626135008960512 2017-12-31 00:30:51 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe You can't make your arguments without calling President Obama names? Do u believe white people are superior to black people? It's just skin.

947604766204612608 2017-12-31 23:05:56 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe I think people are people. One human race. No pigmentation is better than any other. I thought most of this country believed in that.
947604485718687744 2017-12-31 23:04:49 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe How many third world countries have conquered other nations and raped and enslaved their people?

947581262570520576 2017-12-31 21:32:32 UTC <laura_joakimson> @thescoop_us @cibersuedoe When you point out white crime is that "putting down whites"?   Why not address this crime because it exists and is dangerous?

Period. Franken admitted he knew why photo hurt her. So no excuses.

782187026682490880 2016-10-01 11:54:54 UTC <laura_joakimson> @kausmickey Trump sense of humor = ethnic/gender jokes. (Usually race gender jokes relate 2 bigotry). Coulter explained on Glenn Thrush.

755288246481936384 2016-07-18 06:28:45 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie peace determined by diplomacy. Relationships. Hillary has these w/ world leaders. I'm voting progressive values #imwithher
755287660994768897 2016-07-18 06:26:25 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie the arms deals you cite don't convince me. Donations from nations went to global charitable causes. Not for personal benefit.
755286972613009408 2016-07-18 06:23:41 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie Hillary learned from mistakes in Iraq war to intervene in Libya only with NATO Coalition. Not alone. Rather be caught trying.
755286605888225281 2016-07-18 06:22:14 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie good people can learn from mistakes. Bill learned from Rwanda: 2 stand by during slaughter not ok. So he intervened.
755286269064679424 2016-07-18 06:20:53 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie I'm voting Hillary because best use of U.S. military in my lifetime was Bill Clinton stopping Milosovic's genocide.

755214084614688768 2016-07-18 01:34:03 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie voting green = supporting Trump. trump = all I stand against. White supremacy. Visceral hatred women. Climate change denial.
755201454076366848 2016-07-18 00:43:52 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie doesn't mean tempeh is perfect. Sometimes tempeh has problems. But it's still not factory farmed meat. Trump is that meat.
755201224878624768 2016-07-18 00:42:57 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie you saying Trump EQUAL to Hillary same as saying factory farmed chickens same ethics as tempeh.

755155980703322113 2016-07-18 21:43:10 UTC <laura_joakimson> @celiabonavita @vegans4bernie you think Trump will bring peace? I disagree she's war mongerer. But it takes more than 140 char to say.
755153129381900289 2016-07-18 21:31:50 UTC <laura_joakimson> @vegans4bernie @celiabonavita you think Hillary's incompetence caused Benghazi? Because hearings showed GOP cut embassy funding.

689642154906386432 2016-01-19 02:54:37 UTC <laura_joakimson> @davidsirota does sanders address race based income inequality, Or gender based poverty? If not, he's not an agent of economic change.
