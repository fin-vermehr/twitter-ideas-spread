970313381268910080 2018-03-04 15:01:52 UTC <redridingwolves> How early is too early to thirst text your sort-of boo? Asking for a friend.
970149439921901569 2018-03-03 04:10:25 UTC <redridingwolves> My mom & baby brother are watching FMA:B for the first time. Its the Promised Day, and all I can think about is how much I love Envy as a villain and how gay I am for every woman in this series.
970093216560279552 2018-03-03 00:27:00 UTC <redridingwolves> @caitrin_leigh She say Do you love me? I tell her Only partly. I only love old bay and blue crabs, Im sorry (Off beat but applicable)

969002275153809408 2018-02-28 00:12:00 UTC <redridingwolves> Happy birthday @shessomickey !!!! A sapphic Icon and inspiration!!!! Much love to the coolest bi on the block. 
968667086104006657 2018-02-27 02:00:04 UTC <redridingwolves> One of my guy friends adopted a kitten and promised me updates and lots of photos, but it has officially been two days with the lil darlin and I have had NOT ONE BABY PIC!!!!! Men aint shit.
968641858405482496 2018-02-27 00:19:50 UTC <redridingwolves> @Oktimpi Saying I think this thing is condescending and defending my family from being mocked on the internet isnt hating on anyone.... but hey, say whatever youve gotta say to feel like youve won this conversation I guess.
968607022445944832 2018-02-27 22:01:24 UTC <redridingwolves> @Oktimpi Thats nice. Tell that to 10 generations of coast guard and marines though. And to me teaching children to speak English in rural China. Glad you had fun though.
968551394889404416 2018-02-27 18:20:22 UTC <redridingwolves> @Tweet_Fuzz Wuhappen??
968551126038732800 2018-02-27 18:19:17 UTC <redridingwolves> @Oktimpi Im somebody has pointed this out, but I bet youre a delight at parties and have totally accomplished feats equally impressive as qualifying for the Olympics
967759444615598080 2018-02-25 13:53:26 UTC <redridingwolves> @bwecht I mean if you REALLY wanna get into the myth the movie is based on, you could say its because the ocean is its own god, and if it directly interferes with Te Fiti/Te Ka, then a conflict among gods could erupt (pun intended). Using a mortal to the same end wouldnt.
967463823333523461 2018-02-24 18:18:44 UTC <redridingwolves> @absurdistwords I love you and everything you stand for, and I hope I can successfully emulate you in my role as a tutor. Thank you for being so vocal about this.

967006311530614785 2018-02-23 12:00:45 UTC <redridingwolves> @famicomdemon Jesus. Im so sorry that you and and your family have to go through this after everything else.
966854687067721729 2018-02-22 01:58:15 UTC <redridingwolves> @teylor_smirl Best part of cat: Whole cat. (Or any place cat will let you give kisses. Mine likes cheek kisses.)
966448926655176704 2018-02-21 23:05:54 UTC <redridingwolves> @tlcprincess @savvysuzee I outta Sue you for that pun
966428370786451461 2018-02-21 21:44:13 UTC <redridingwolves> @chadders1995 Nah fam. But I kinda wish youd drink the kool-aid.
966426542653034496 2018-02-21 21:36:57 UTC <redridingwolves> @TruthRadiates Right now Ive about a nickel and an expired coupon but apparently sense than you
966425481292779522 2018-02-21 21:32:44 UTC <redridingwolves> @TruthRadiates Im a survivor of child rape and incest. Ive been homeless and hungry. Lifes already hit me. I wasnt offended. I was mildly annoyed and making an observation. Sue me if youre so OFFENDED by that.
966403740172513280 2018-02-21 20:06:21 UTC <redridingwolves> All the people who equate my mild annoyance and disappointment with being triggered or offended get gold medals in the Olympic Reaching Tournament
966314167123800064 2018-02-21 14:10:25 UTC <redridingwolves> @tlcprincess *millennials
966311010775785472 2018-02-21 13:57:52 UTC <redridingwolves> @tlcprincess Because I cant fit all the accomplishments of millennial in the Olympics in a single tweet. Also people are allowed to criticize things. Like. Thats allowed.
966308616457347074 2018-02-21 13:48:21 UTC <redridingwolves> @tlcprincess I mean. I tend to think of anything that both mocks an upcoming generation and rails against technology as Luddism and inherently harmful. Whats fun and popular isnt inherently good.
966307109259313153 2018-02-21 13:42:22 UTC <redridingwolves> Does anyone else find the hashtag #MillennialOlympicEvents especially condescending and rude considering its Millenials and kids from Generation Z that are actually.... ya know... winning and placing in Olympic events instead of making mean tweets?

965627102983749632 2018-02-19 16:40:16 UTC <redridingwolves> @ne0npink To be fair, this might be addressed later in MCU. Thats also what Im not really mad at the movie for not making Ayo openly lesbian. 100% legit crit though
964661521887449088 2018-02-16 00:43:24 UTC <redridingwolves> @PuccaNoodles I turned in an essay three days late and explained to my professor in an email that my depression & SAD was interfering with my time management. Hes usually strict with due dates, but he never docked my grade and actually recommend me several therapists. I cried.

958461553208123395 2018-01-30 22:06:56 UTC <redridingwolves> Nothing can describe my rage upon seeing someone take a quote about the holocaust and adapt it to make a joke about an article criticizing fucking skin care routines. I promise its not that deep. #NeverAgain

912718881449480193 2017-09-26 16:41:53 UTC <redridingwolves> My bff isnt free the day the @lorepodcast show drops & cant binge with me. Clearly the solution is to promote someone else to bff status.
910484240076296192 2017-09-20 12:42:13 UTC <redridingwolves> "I'll be with you in just a moment" is Barista for "Fuck off and die, you entitled shitbag."

896921889775509504 2017-08-13 02:30:17 UTC <redridingwolves> A friend tried my drink (mostly bourbon) and said it tasted like liquid smoke and OJ. But what is bourbon if not liquid smoke? I ask you.
896683835886379009 2017-08-13 10:44:20 UTC <redridingwolves> Nothing quite like 5am baking (leading to a 6am Walmart run for baking powder).
883421482524848129 2017-07-07 20:24:29 UTC <redridingwolves> True friendship is driving for an hour so you both can sit on the floor, ignoring each other, and feel at peace.
880575972554223616 2017-06-29 23:57:26 UTC <redridingwolves> Some people are just the human equivalent of nails on a chalkboard and I'm not about it or in a mood to deal with them
876146106157105152 2017-06-17 18:34:44 UTC <redridingwolves> True friendship is cleaning their toilet for them because they're depressed and expecting company.
873253402020642816 2017-06-09 19:00:09 UTC <redridingwolves> Peter S. Beagle and his work are important to me in a way that strikes deeply but is difficult to articulate.
870663214177992705 2017-06-02 15:27:41 UTC <redridingwolves> I caught a gold magikarp this morning. His name is Taco because I love and will miss breakfast tacos.

869610847924105216 2017-05-30 17:45:57 UTC <redridingwolves> I love Texas BBQ but I wish its general attitude towards veggies was something other that "boil it to death and put some pork in"

869346775924187138 2017-05-29 00:16:37 UTC <redridingwolves> @ne0npink Paul Stanley is wonderful & well adjusted and far better than Gamzee ever could be.

869330748112818176 2017-05-29 23:12:56 UTC <redridingwolves> @ne0npink For once, no actually! Paul Stanley (aka The Starchild) is just a lying liar who lies in the lyrics to the KISS song "C'mon and Love Me" !!!
869320525801283585 2017-05-29 22:32:19 UTC <redridingwolves> "I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer" my ass!! Paul Stanley is an Aquarius!! All men do is Lie!!! Thank god I'm a lesbian.
