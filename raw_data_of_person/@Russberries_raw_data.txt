And because she was using all the machines I then had to walk to another laundromat. I survived and am being dramatic but it just struck me as very inconsiderate.
933002797393444866 2017-11-21 16:02:55 UTC <Russberries> There's a woman at the laudromat using 7 washing machines. There are no other working washing machines. This woman is a fucking monster.
