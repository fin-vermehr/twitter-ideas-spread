897472937661526016 2017-08-15 14:59:57 UTC <4_babbitttree> @realDonaldTrump Maybe because you took 2ish days to condemn white supremacy. Just a guess.
897472230061461504 2017-08-15 14:57:08 UTC <4_babbitttree> Of the earth to defend white supremacy and a president who's at the very least, complicit in it. (Fin) #TuesdayThoughts #CVille

896458092258439168 2017-08-12 19:47:19 UTC <4_babbitttree> Marginalized people have every right to defend themselves against violence perpetuated on them. Their lives matter. They are people/10
896457079053066240 2017-08-12 19:43:17 UTC <4_babbitttree> "Anti white hate" is totally justifiable when you look at how shitty white people have been throughout history. But it's still not a thing/9
896455580990230528 2017-08-12 19:37:20 UTC <4_babbitttree> Alt right brought the counter violence on themselves. If you don't like people getting mad at you for being a bigot, maybe don't be one?/8
896454823922499584 2017-08-12 19:34:20 UTC <4_babbitttree> Lives are at stake. Nazi pricks have already committed 3(?) acts of attempted vehicular manslaughter against counter protestors in cville/7
896452806739185666 2017-08-12 19:26:19 UTC <4_babbitttree> Taking the high road doesn't work when rabid Nazis will stop at nothing, and I mean NOTHING to uphold their white supremacist agenda./6
896452367067033602 2017-08-12 19:24:34 UTC <4_babbitttree> I'm definitely not the first to say this: This neoliberal idea that we shouldn't stoop to their level, or take the high road is bullshit./5
896451835187396608 2017-08-12 19:22:27 UTC <4_babbitttree> People are like mirrors, you reflect back what you put in. If you put in death threats, bigotry, racism, and violence, guess what bitch?/4
896451371888771072 2017-08-12 19:20:36 UTC <4_babbitttree> I want Nazis dead because they are a direct threat to my life, and more so the lives of people of color, immigrants, disabled, etc/3
896450859902672898 2017-08-12 19:18:34 UTC <4_babbitttree> What am I supposed to do? What are marginalized people supposed to do? Just let some cousin fucking redneck say that we shouldn't exist?/2
