970472782604718080 2018-03-04 01:35:16 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Emma4Change Makes me wish my state took a vote too. Hell, every state. A concrete vote would put a lot of incumbents out of office if they voted pro-NRA, even if the bill didn't pass. People deserve to see their legislators take a stand, ready to face the consequences. #VoteThemOut #arleg
968904958115446785 2018-02-28 17:45:18 UTC <nick_sabaj> @ArkDems @gregleding @HaydenShamel Does the Garland county committee have open membership year-round?
968673799418908672 2018-02-27 02:26:45 UTC <nick_sabaj> ...right next to 25, the one I was trying to run in. I'll be working in community organizing and activism throughout the next 2 years and beyond, and I hope to one day have the honor to serve the people of this district. #arleg #arpx
968673688798277633 2018-02-27 02:26:19 UTC <nick_sabaj> It's come to my attention that you need to be an Arkansas resident for 2 years, not 1. I'm deeply sorry to everyone who supported me, and I'll ask those who donated to me whether they want me to return their donation, keep it for 2020, or forward it to candidate Kallen in D 24...

Calling people, running around, scrambling to raise $1800 to pay the filing fee. If just 18 people donate $100, we're in. I have a donation page set up, though its auto goal thing doesn't display verbal pledges and cash. #arleg #arpx #donate http://bit.ly/2Fc7xIA
968404283313065984 2018-02-27 08:35:47 UTC <nick_sabaj> If you can, please donate to my campaign. We're $1800 away from paying for the $3000 filing fee to represent the Democratic party. We can do this, but we need help. #arleg #arpx #FlipItBlue  Our donate page lists a small goal due to automatic goal settings we can't change. $1800
968342288144437249 2018-02-26 04:29:27 UTC <nick_sabaj> Also: the donation page has a low goal because it's auto-generated based on current donations, and doesn't account for pledges or cash. Currently need about $1,900 to reach the filing fee. I don't think the platform has an option to set a fixed goal. #arleg #arpx
968273441949437957 2018-02-26 23:55:52 UTC <nick_sabaj> @pashulman Stuff like this is part of why I'm running for state representative in my district. Trying to pay the filing fee- it looks like I have a chance to win, if I can afford to get on the ballot. Republican 1-term incumbent is currently unchallenged. Student trying to make a difference
968264678332944384 2018-02-26 23:21:03 UTC <nick_sabaj> @AACF We need to make sure pre-k is well funded. If I'm elected to AR House 25, I'll be a fierce advocate for our children.

968177582494666753 2018-02-26 17:34:58 UTC <nick_sabaj> @MomsDemand @CollinsARK @gelderbailey I'm on board! I'm running as Democratic candidate for AR House District 25. I want to be a voice for gun control in the state legislature. I'm about 1/3 to raising the filing fee, and @HaydenShamel seems supportive. What should I do next?
968174996811059200 2018-02-26 17:24:41 UTC <nick_sabaj> @gregleding @CollinsARK @DeniseforAR @Michelle_In_AR I'm raising funds to file as the Democratic candidate for AR House District 25, strong supporter of gun control.

968169953437405185 2018-02-26 17:04:39 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Cfeltstaylor @RisherRev @lcretain40 @evesuzanne @SpiceyGirl512 You're doing amazing work. I'm running as the Democratic candidate for AR state rep. in district 25, near Little Rock, and it amazes me what some people onject to. Last night, a man on twitter said "all background checks infringe on our rights". Absurd.
968039711255203840 2018-02-26 08:27:07 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog @JustinJonesAR I'm advocating for making sure the laws work, and having background checks before you buy a gun. It could help, doesn't hurt anyone, and makes sense. Beyond that, I think we understand each other, and I wish you goodnight.
968038912613670912 2018-02-26 08:23:56 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @JustinJonesAR @Arkyhog "Private sellers" at gun shows aren't required to perform background checks if they, essentially, don't think they need to.
968038587857072128 2018-02-26 08:22:39 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @JustinJonesAR @Arkyhog We clearly disagree there, and I don't think your mind will change tonight on that. Courts and public opinion has consistently sided with me over you on that.
968037068524879872 2018-02-26 08:16:37 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog @JustinJonesAR Do you think the United States just happens to have such an abundance of school shootings compared to other countries? It's because guns are easier to get here. And I saw you cited the 2nd amendment- did you consider the phrase "well regulated" in there?
968036548133511173 2018-02-26 08:14:32 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog @JustinJonesAR I didn't say anything about disarmament and you know it. You also know that making obtaining things difficult for prohibited people is the purpose of much regulation, and it works. And if a potential school shooter can't buy a gun, he might not go forward.
968034564135366656 2018-02-26 08:06:39 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @JustinJonesAR @Arkyhog -you isn't a crime isn't infringing anything. It's making sure the law works.
968034265744240640 2018-02-26 08:05:28 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @JustinJonesAR @Arkyhog Background checks at gun shows aren't mandatory except in a handful of states, and Arkansas isn't part of that handful. It helps prevent school shootings by making it more difficult for a gun to fall into the hands of someone who doesn't have them. And checking that selling to-
968033012142178304 2018-02-26 08:00:29 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Arkyhog Also- expanding availability of marijuana and regulating it like alcohol would help reduce crime and gun trafficking. Arkansas has minor medical marijuana measures, but lacks direction in ending the black market around recreational use of an innocuous substance.
968032135528550402 2018-02-25 07:57:00 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Arkyhog Besides that, we need increased education spending and support for our public schools. A fraction of defense spending, and a reliably great return on investment both in qualitative benefits and $ spent/saved. It's a multidimensional issue, but it's one we can address.
968031051632214017 2018-02-25 07:52:42 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Arkyhog And here's an article & study showing it works.http://cnn.it/2HOsCr5
968027856700936192 2018-02-25 07:40:00 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog @JustinJonesAR Thank you. That's essentially what I'm proposing we do. Background check are useful and reasonable, and they ought to be done whether at a gun store or a gun show.
968027463564619776 2018-02-25 07:38:27 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Arkyhog Background checks are a pretty mundane and reasonable recquirement, and they do good when they're done. So why not do them?
968027143006507008 2018-02-25 07:37:10 UTC <nick_sabaj> @Arkyhog I just said I think we should have background checks at gun shows and such, and that we should make sure background check paperwork gets processed. I don't see what's bad about that, or out of line with trying to have existing law work. Why not?
967975668439973889 2018-02-25 04:12:38 UTC <nick_sabaj> The more people interested in gun control & progressive values who hear about me, the better. My Republican opponent has only been in office for one term, and hasn't been a resounding voice for change. If you want another supporter in the state legislature, you can count on me.
967974606073147392 2018-02-25 04:08:24 UTC <nick_sabaj> @juleskills If you or your friends and colleagues want to help push a candidate into action, consider me. I'm trying to raise funds to pay the filing fee to run as a Democrat in AR House District 25, and I'm racing against time. Any help could help me make the funding deadline.
967972620099571718 2018-02-25 04:00:31 UTC <nick_sabaj> @MomsDemand @dbishop0 I'm trying to become a lawmaker for AR House District 25, and you can be sure that I'll act on gun control measures. We need universal background checks and a background check system without paperwork backlogs. I'm raising funds to pay my filing fee to run as a Democrat. #arleg
967968825936351233 2018-02-25 03:45:26 UTC <nick_sabaj> I want to be a progressive voice in our state legislature.

Your support would me the world to me- I'd love to work together.
967967447969095680 2018-02-25 03:39:58 UTC <nick_sabaj> @INDIVISIBLEArk If elected to AR House 25, I'll be a strong advocate for universal healthcare. We can get it done on the state level if Congress doesn't fight for it. I'll also fight for universal background checks for gun purchases. Fundraising now for my campaign's filing fee.
967958344530001921 2018-02-25 03:03:47 UTC <nick_sabaj> @MomsDemand @evesuzanne I'm raising funds for the filing fee to register my campaign. If you can donate or pledge a future donation, it would go a long way towards showing my viability to win. I think I can win this seat, and be a proponent of your cause, working closely with you. What do you think?
967957685634306048 2018-02-25 03:01:10 UTC <nick_sabaj> @MomsDemand @evesuzanne You do wonderful work! I think we could do even more with a fresh voice in the #arleg. I'm running as the Democratic candidate for AR House District 25, and I support Universal Background Checks, preventing backlogs in our background check system, and progressive values. Join me?
967933722082279424 2018-02-25 01:25:57 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog If further laws are proposed, I'll reach out to my constituents & seek their insight, through town halls and referendums. I want to support the people, and inform them of what's going on in their state legislature. I'll meet with constituents for and against measures and listen.
967930871134261250 2018-02-25 01:14:37 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog - are well funded, preventing paperwork backlog. What do you think? Not radical enough?
967930622609063936 2018-02-25 01:13:38 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV @Arkyhog A few that have wide acceptance. Universal background checks for one, by closing the gun-show loophole. Second, moving the age to purchase a rifle to 21. Besides that, principally just good legislative housekeeping, making sure state resources for performing background checks-
967907155218239488 2018-02-25 23:40:23 UTC <nick_sabaj> I believe we can make a difference.
967907019364687872 2018-02-25 23:39:50 UTC <nick_sabaj> We can do better than we are now on every level, including states. I'm running as the Democratic candidate for AR State House District 25 because I saw no one else had done so. I'm fundraising to pay the filing fee, and I think I can win. Please, donate and follow if you can.
967899212015964160 2018-02-25 23:08:49 UTC <nick_sabaj> @FaceTheNation @WAGV Not cool with that- we need common-sense gun control.

967895656244432896 2018-02-25 22:54:41 UTC <nick_sabaj> @DrVEvansWinters This is totally true. While the Florida shooting had elements which brought it the acclaim it has, we need to protect kids from guns whether it's a kid or a cop pulling the trigger. I remember marching in Oregon when Quanice Hayes was killed, also unarmed, also by an AR-15.

964930507464232966 2018-02-17 18:32:15 UTC <nick_sabaj> @voidlicker @videodante Frustrating that it seems to rely on heroic stewards of wealth rather than individuals accountable to the people.
