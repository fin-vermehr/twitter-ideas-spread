969815074973024256 2018-03-02 06:01:46 UTC <Fuhhrank> Arnold Schwarzeneggers Snapchat is probably my favorite ever. Its always him either:  1. Hyped on national monuments/the history of different countries he visits  2. Hyped on meeting with world leaders to reduce our carbon footprint  3. Hyped on people lifting weights

958034404491874304 2018-01-29 17:49:36 UTC <Fuhhrank> So since were both sick, were meeting for pho for lunch then going to our homes to nap, right? True friendship.

946392121459793920 2017-12-28 14:47:19 UTC <Fuhhrank> Alright, rant of the morning over lmao
946392064433979394 2017-12-28 14:47:05 UTC <Fuhhrank> Besides, if theyd listen to the albums lyrics theyd be able to tell that its someone still dealing with depression but theyre getting better at overcoming it & things have gotten better.  Not someone whos dealing with depression & moping around like the first two albums.
946391105674891264 2017-12-28 14:43:17 UTC <Fuhhrank> Even if I didnt like the album, Id still be like, Well, at least thats great for him! Hes conquering his demons & his depression and I may not be that into the happier feel but at least thats one less person losing the battle against depression.
946390580237623298 2017-12-28 14:41:12 UTC <Fuhhrank> Im still a little salty toward old skool TFB fans hating on Back On Top just because either:  1. TFB signed to a major label 2. The album is happier than the first 2 albums because Brian is happier with life now & coping with his depression better
