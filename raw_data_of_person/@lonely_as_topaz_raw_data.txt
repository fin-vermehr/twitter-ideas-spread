970367980751081472 2018-03-04 18:38:49 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> BtwI finally watched Wonder Woman last night. Yall hyped this movie up way too much.Either that or I am not as affected by the lack of female superheroes as the rest of yall because with the exception of wishing I could live with the Amazons, it was a bit if a snooze fest.

I like the feeling if being right but this office is like being in High School again and it is all drama and cliques and whispering rumours today. Its very exhausting. I just wanna got home now, curl up with my fur-babies, and wait for Once to come on again.

969683122253004800 2018-03-02 21:17:26 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> The drama in the office todayApparently people never expected me to actually be the powerhouse bitch that I play on TV.They thought it was an act & when I stepped up last night AND was in the right w/evidence to back me up, it turned the  on its axis.
969673864446791680 2018-03-02 20:40:39 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @persnickets @_notsoevilqueen I dig the smoke, and maybe a spiced wine she drinks. I dont see EQ drinking a peasant booze. And perfume would be an expensive spice from her fathers homeland or flower that reminds her of Daniel. Maybe a mix of leather from riding in the stables & a flower he gave her.

I put the sticker on and use a stila pen to fill in and dust makeupforever hd powder over to make it stay. Then take off and do the rest of my makeup & go over the liner again with my urban decay 24/7 to make it pop.

955916724057997313 2018-01-23 21:34:41 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 I think theres confusion over where to put it. Does it fall under horror, drama, etc? Its got social commentary to it but its not a documentary, & it is not a horror film or a straight up drama either. So they said Oh look! some black men telling jokes;Must be a comedy.

So how much faith do we really want to put in their taste in TV shows obviously they were pandering to a select audience.
954908899366154240 2018-01-20 02:49:57 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 @_SinginPrincess @BarbaraHershey8 So I was thinking about this during dinner and come up with this list for you.

She can see all the birds, rabbits, & squirrels. She chirps & chatters, and tries to get at them through the window. Its very frustrating for her that she cant be outdoors,  but we also have coyotes.

The walk and stance, and especially the way you held your mouth & spoke. Reminded me very much of my grandmother who was very hard and tight-fistedlike Ruth.

Not only the continual dismissal and denials, but even just watching her body language & her face, how she fidgetted when ever she was obviously hiding things. It was frustrating to watch.
953747567136849922 2018-01-17 21:55:14 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @audreysl0ve This should also apply to all the Lana haters. Block them & dont pay them attention. Retweets and screenshots only draws activity to their accounts which makes them feel more important.

Do I keep the weekend free? Did they change their mind? Did they text the wrong person accidentally? WTF?

952760296359120896 2018-01-14 04:32:10 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @BarbaraHershey8 @BrokenRegal108 That is a correct response too.If you see someone you care about is upset but they dont want to talk about why, just sitting with them so they know they arent alone is being just as good of a friend as if you were listening to them or giving advice.
952745389995696129 2018-01-14 03:32:56 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @BarbaraHershey8 @BrokenRegal108 Sometimes just sitting with a person is the only support they need. They dont always need advise or want to talk about what is wrong. Just knowing someone is there is enough.

I adore my spoiled fur-baby!

939912612589969408 2017-12-10 17:40:04 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Apparently my pilot walked off the job before he brought the plane back to PA, so my flight to Chicago, this morning, was cancelled and I got booked on a new route into SanFran.   Its a sign; the fates want me to go home to California.  #AllRoadsLeadHome

937429994279546880 2017-12-03 21:15:01 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @johnsanders0 Sadly, I have not traveled outside the continent; was supposed to go to Europe for my 40th but my fam cant afford it so we cancelled.    I think the number of single people is the same, we are just more absorbed in ourselves & our devices to interact with each other these days.
937427942874931200 2017-12-03 21:06:52 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @johnsanders0 I do that also. I figured out how to correct the results. Apparently auto-sets to collect popular searches from people around me in the areas I am around when I log in (usually at work or on the bus)- which explains a lot.
937387548682338304 2017-12-03 18:26:22 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 Ill check for it, or I am sure @SearingUnicorn will know where it is. She has the in on all of them.
937254515970940929 2017-12-03 09:37:44 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @johnsanders0 No worries, no offense or judgement taken from it. There is a lot more of us around these days.
937252270227439616 2017-12-03 09:28:49 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @johnsanders0 True, I just prefer to use it to scan for real time events, and look for conversations about arts-related topics & events that more my interest on here. Britney and Mariah are not usually involved in thoses.
937251246611632128 2017-12-03 09:24:45 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @johnsanders0 Yup.

845838479690915840 2017-03-25 03:23:03 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @audreysl0ve okay but only if we address Regina's cringe as well when she learns...maybe she and David can go on a binger at Grannys
845836986690654208 2017-03-25 03:17:07 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @audreysl0ve - laughing but cringing at the brutality to my poor David. Can it be Archie instead? He & Hook have become quite close lately.
845835751065473024 2017-03-25 03:12:12 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @audreysl0ve you say that like its a bad thing. It only enhances the commentary.

775516116160438273 2016-09-12 02:07:05 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @darkswxnqueen @KryssiKakes I would imagine it was discussed by them since Lana seem to be so detailed in she approaches every aspect of EQ.

775496540634828800 2016-09-12 00:49:17 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 @KryssiKakes - collars & chips won't stop people from stealing anyways. These days it's pretty common for people to take cuz

739270631988944900 2016-06-04 01:40:28 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @BarbaraHershey8 @ariestess69 I'm still trying to break my #OUAT fic habit. At this rate I will never be productive again.
739269767626776576 2016-06-04 01:37:02 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @BarbaraHershey8 @ariestess69 *perks up* Am I going to develop a #Damien FF addiction out of this? 
739218300438093824 2016-06-04 22:12:31 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> I've decided @glenmazzara & the other #Damien writers need to hold a q+a session so we can get our unfinished story & answers to Qs we have.
739217535573204993 2016-06-04 22:09:29 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> 10 episodes of @DamienAETV & a gave myself a mani/pedi. Fairly productive day so far. 
739187446026362880 2016-06-04 20:09:55 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> - I need someone to design a beautiful Oz / broken heart tattoo w/ this quote. I asked a friend many yrs ago & she flaked.

739176131266371585 2016-06-04 19:24:57 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Episode 8 of #Damien re-watch : I am too emotionally involved in this. I'm already getting frustrated that I wont get the answers I need.
739175186281332736 2016-06-04 19:21:12 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Aww Damn. I always miss the fun stuff. 
739148734571778048 2016-06-04 17:36:05 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Holy hell! Woke up to 47 notifications in my twitter.   Did the apoloclypse come last night while I was lost in my #Damien binge?

738913516229263361 2016-06-03 02:01:25 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 just starting ep 1 - hoping to catch lots of things i missed the 1st time thru cuz I was mesmerized watching @BarbaraHershey8 
738910110269898752 2016-06-03 01:47:53 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @ariestess69 i give them too much of my money. They would probably send a rep to my home if they didn't hear from me.
738909795638349825 2016-06-03 01:46:38 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Finally got all 10 episodes of @DamienAETV #OnDemand! Guess what I am binge watching this weekend?!?   TY @comcastcares & @AETV !

738631067993657345 2016-06-03 07:19:04 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> I need to stop reading FanFic. I always compare my love life (or lack there of one) to them & end up feeling so much worse about myself.

738586874118168576 2016-06-02 04:23:27 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @ariestess69 I think buckingham nicks is his best work.   Its a shame he left before they had a chance to tour much on tango.
738584894792601601 2016-06-02 04:15:35 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @ariestess69 I know. The demos i've already heard kill me. I would die for some of Chris's demos and some tango live w/ LB.
738583659586818058 2016-06-02 04:10:41 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @ariestess69 all of the re-releases are like this: 4-5 discs of live and demos. Trying to counter act the underground bootlegs

738558415736184833 2016-06-02 02:30:22 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @BarbaraHershey8 - I am still not over the hair; each time I see it I have flashback to the wigs DollyP wore in the 1980s.

738536463864762368 2016-06-02 01:03:08 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Apparently I am considered 'management material' but still considered too 'intimidating & scary' - I believe that makes me CEO material!

738382696783585282 2016-06-02 14:52:08 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes - that sounds like me now except you can replace 'school' & 'studying' with 'life' & 'working'.

737451278914052096 2016-05-30 01:11:00 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @paigesturco i know tan - I was teasing. I usually go by imdb dates which reads 1966 because they research their info more.
737447681128206336 2016-05-30 00:56:42 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @paigesturco @KryssiKakes i am taking about the date on Kristen's picture.

737445146858389505 2016-05-30 00:46:38 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @paigesturco @KryssiKakes dang - she looks 'developed' for a 7 year old 
737438508206325760 2016-05-30 00:20:15 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes @BarbaraHershey8 - can we print this on a pillow or tshirt so we all remember this every time we start to self-loathe?! 
737437835611934722 2016-05-30 00:17:35 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes Agreed; I don't normally like sport films either but with this cast, it is not standard. It won lots of awards & great score!

737368319532011520 2016-05-30 19:41:21 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @FINALLEVEL - not to mention a tranq gun would have sufficed. They did not need to put the Gorilla down. Both patent & zoo at fault here.
737363671626584065 2016-05-30 19:22:53 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @ariestess69 @BarbaraHershey8 - I'm intrigued. Going to have to make a list of movies to watch in my free time.

736962350033428480 2016-05-29 16:48:11 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @cherubino88 @maayanvoss - I will. Erin McMullen, mezzo. She'd probably like to meet y'all since she is thinking of NYC/Bard 4 her masters.

736759953348694020 2016-05-28 03:23:55 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @classicalsinger - In case you were unaware, your website is currently down.

736713515570847745 2016-05-28 00:19:24 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @thewisdomtooth do you have a specific fandom or ship you want?
736712140086595586 2016-05-28 00:13:56 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @MadeUpAsIGo go make it happen. You already sold me on Hook/Cora. You may sell me on this too. All my ships range M/M, F/F, F/M and group.
736711339352039424 2016-05-28 00:10:45 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @MadeUpAsIGo dont put mind in it. Ships are just our own fantasies playing out with other peoples characters so if u want Gold/Hook ship

736710450297987072 2016-05-28 00:07:13 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @MadeUpAsIGo It would be nice to have A&E go back and actually finish/resolve the Gold/Hook storyline. Its just one of many lost to thier

736706305256128512 2016-05-28 23:50:45 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @KryssiKakes Agreed. Most of my paycheck goes to paying school loans &Med/Dental bills - things that are covered elsewhere
736703745875054592 2016-05-28 23:40:34 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> @MadeUpAsIGo other male characters though, but that is just Colin's inability to not be sexy and playing Hook as typical lurid pirate.

733872285891756032 2016-05-20 04:09:22 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> Why is no one asking the real question - why were you thinking about Donald Trump or his pubes?!?
733869220845359104 2016-05-20 03:57:11 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> - hmm seeing that couch in the room though, the darker may be better choice as it will match it more.
733868731357487106 2016-05-20 03:55:14 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> - Lol...understood. Only time it is ever applied to me is if there is additional mood-altering substances aiding in my cheeriness.
733866810819252224 2016-05-20 03:47:36 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> - hmm, so which is more you : bright &  electric, subtle & sultry , or dark & moody ?
733865414619365378 2016-05-20 03:42:04 UTC <lonely_as_topaz> - are u trying to match something in particular? If not, i like the middle-not to bright to hurt eyes and not to dark to be acrypt.
