932011032909885440 2017-11-18 22:22:00 UTC <lane2217> @Curtis_Pope @BoycottUtah @bj2048 Yes - there's been some progress from this moment but not enough.
932010716135116802 2017-11-18 22:20:45 UTC <lane2217> @Curtis_Pope @BoycottUtah I would say first bravo! & would distinguish this from ridicule-
932009413489152000 2017-11-18 22:15:34 UTC <lane2217> @Curtis_Pope @BoycottUtah Respectfully I deeply, passionately disagree with you about ridicule - believe me I slip into it & for individuals such as Trump what else is there? But otherwise it's a hateful game that promotes an atmosphere of contempt
932008629456244737 2017-11-18 22:12:27 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope Your original tweet didn't mention a percentage but seemed to suggest all Alabama women are raised to hate - that "these women" stand for all Alabama women
932007801030959104 2017-11-18 22:09:10 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope I think you do your point a disservice - just sayin - not all Alabama Women are white nationalists- thankfully & the women supporting Moore are delusional but they're not all the women
932007270489128960 2017-11-18 22:07:03 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope Ridiculing doesn't change anything it merely encourages entrenchment and hate Maybe work to get people to see the truth that would have definitely helped during Hitler's rise to power
932006379296043008 2017-11-18 22:03:31 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope You misunderstand what I'm saying - and don't seem interested in my point - you also seem unaware that there's never one monolithic culture - there are people everywhere, working for better - if we give up we have nothing
932003056941785089 2017-11-18 21:50:19 UTC <lane2217> @Curtis_Pope @BoycottUtah Sure but make sure you know who the Nazis are - it's this idea that some subset of women - even if they say they do - stand for all women of Alabama & that Alabama and other places are a monolithic culture -
932000347891093504 2017-11-18 21:39:33 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope It's worth the trouble- I was raised in the world you're pointing out - I don't hate I wasn't raised to hate. It's generalizations that get us to turn on groups rather than argue positions
931999859225387008 2017-11-18 21:37:36 UTC <lane2217> @BoycottUtah @Curtis_Pope 25% isn't 100% & it fails to understand the dynamics- even if you don't persuade you can move the needle a bit

880617062590291972 2017-06-29 02:40:43 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary So how does this relate to sanctuary cities
880616950803640320 2017-06-29 02:40:16 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary You've yet to explain how this policy addresses unfunded liabilities - some Depopulated cities - states need immigrants to increase tax base
880616397138780161 2017-06-29 02:38:04 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary Condescension is the resort of those who lack an argument
880614521861263361 2017-06-29 02:30:37 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary Is it safety or economics
880614448544833540 2017-06-29 02:30:20 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary But even if you're concerned about that it doesn't address how this policy fixes that better than some other policy
880613467417452544 2017-06-29 02:26:26 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary I disagree

880610711629701120 2017-06-29 02:15:29 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary If they're paying taxes then what's the problem - and yes we can save ourselves
880610318644379648 2017-06-29 02:13:55 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary ? How exactly does this relate to sanctuary cities? To which unfunded liabilities to you refer? We need tax reform- not tax breaks

880608859194359808 2017-06-29 02:08:07 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary But if you mean what do we owe the victims of dom violence- I was referencing the original tweet
880608589752270855 2017-06-29 02:07:03 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary I think as a species we do better if we honor our common humanity-

880605808647708673 2017-06-29 01:56:00 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary What does that mean? You're saying Jesus wasn't about opening your hearts to others?
880604169018777601 2017-06-29 01:49:29 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary What do we owe to the victims of domestic violence?
880603709432115200 2017-06-29 01:47:39 UTC <lane2217> @HouseGOP @HouseJudiciary But at any rate I think prioritizing based on greatest risks- check out the statistics on domestic violencehttp://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/relationships/a37005/statistics-about-domestic-violence/
