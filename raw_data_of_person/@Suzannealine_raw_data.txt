942061856847360001 2017-12-16 16:00:23 UTC <Suzannealine> I'm really trying to care less.
941346929983741952 2017-12-14 16:39:32 UTC <Suzannealine> You must be completely insane, to think that all of this isn't completely insane.
941322787536306176 2017-12-14 15:03:36 UTC <Suzannealine> Some of this paradigm is real. The rest is made of expanding foam.
940977315772710913 2017-12-13 16:10:49 UTC <Suzannealine> @CBCHealth @CBCTechSci @CBCNews @CBCWorldNews @CBCAlerts @cbcasithappens That sucks.
940946587462725633 2017-12-13 14:08:43 UTC <Suzannealine> It's remarkable how much time we spend fending each other off.

938951866053828608 2017-12-07 02:02:24 UTC <Suzannealine> I came up with a word to make it easier to refer to NRA gun nuts. And the word is  GUNTS. Your welcome.
938936420684611584 2017-12-07 01:01:01 UTC <Suzannealine> @TheLancet @CBCNews @CBCAlerts @CBCWorldNews @CBCHealth @cbcasithappens This is so wrong. Breaks my heart. I don't know how people can read this and then still function.
938918360242208768 2017-12-07 23:49:15 UTC <Suzannealine> @connorsureis Also, this is for now. This is not the set-in-stone rest of your life.
938918083007201280 2017-12-07 23:48:09 UTC <Suzannealine> @connorsureis Why don't you word it differently.
938917919773167616 2017-12-07 23:47:30 UTC <Suzannealine> @connorsureis Well you shouldn't. I'm sure they understand. They should understand. Make them understand. Let them try to play what you do. That have to get their own bass though.

938616741273280512 2017-12-06 03:50:44 UTC <Suzannealine> @NewYorker But it has over a thirty-thousand dollars in library fines.
938614114422628354 2017-12-06 03:40:18 UTC <Suzannealine> I look at you. I adore you. I take the mint. An old woman from the village comes out to paint her goldfish. She looks at me and says, "Don't forget to take the wrapper off or you'll choke, idiot." Then it is June.
938555920233127936 2017-12-06 23:49:03 UTC <Suzannealine> I always think of Ron Lea's beautiful blue eyes when I think of the Halifax Explosion. Where the hell is that handsome man these days?

936979643709530112 2017-12-02 15:25:29 UTC <Suzannealine> The U.S. just turned into a Dickens novel. Cue ghosts:  "What train wreck have you made, you back-brained idiots? Even the worms will despise you at your death."
936978851695026177 2017-12-02 15:22:21 UTC <Suzannealine> I took some stress relief supplements and my pants fell off.

936717052219244545 2017-12-01 22:02:03 UTC <Suzannealine> Why do retail stores ask for your postal code, but never what your greatest dreams and fears are?
936661003810381824 2017-12-01 18:19:20 UTC <Suzannealine> Don't forget to load your points. God, oh God, load your points. This is your last chance. Your very last chance. WHY ARE YOU NOT LOADING YOUR POINTS? GOD! LET ME GET CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR YOU!
936656108873072640 2017-12-01 17:59:53 UTC <Suzannealine> I'm waiting for Conrad Black to write an essay on why Trump is doing everything right again. It's coming, even though the rest of the world sees the U.S. as once great-now on a sleigh ride to where carp feed.

936081022214483968 2017-11-29 03:54:41 UTC <Suzannealine> @JulieNesrallah @colinmochrie Hi Colin, I was at symphony and the guy beside me was texting...so I kicked him.  Yes, my son was playing on stage so I may have been, you know, motherly, but  the guy turned his phone off. Then I think he got some ice for his leg. :)
936048425665101824 2017-11-29 01:45:10 UTC <Suzannealine> The Internet should be more like cable TV said no one, ever. Agree? Tell the #CRTC:https://act.openmedia.org/TheOpenInternet

888474918316158981 2017-07-21 19:05:02 UTC <Suzannealine> @TabathaSouthey "...titern..." Nice! Another excellently witty piece.
888145460594126849 2017-07-20 21:15:53 UTC <Suzannealine> Is Dante's Inferno considered "off the grid?"
888145311239213056 2017-07-20 21:15:17 UTC <Suzannealine> Well, Trump certainly doesn't speak it. Not in any intelligible way, at least.https://twitter.com/JessicaValenti/status/887997477680533504

885248968179023872 2017-07-12 21:26:15 UTC <Suzannealine> @jengerson Not if you make your own. And especially if you knit it. Especially that!

829109007684104196 2017-02-07 23:26:06 UTC <Suzannealine> DeVos' heart to be on exhibit at Smithsonian since she doesn't plan on using it for the next few years.
829106299417792512 2017-02-07 23:15:20 UTC <Suzannealine> Republicans change "conflict of interest" to "COMFORT of interest." There. Easier.
829095694480896000 2017-02-07 22:33:12 UTC <Suzannealine> @connorsureis I think the Trump drinking game gave me some wiggle room. And I beat Borowitz to the DeVos spelling theme. But ...I know...
829093695504924672 2017-02-07 22:25:15 UTC <Suzannealine> @connorsureis It was the Vanilla Ice joke wasn't it. I know. I threw up just a little while writing that one.

809808214162341888 2016-12-16 17:11:38 UTC <Suzannealine> Anyone else get the sense that the world is being run by blowhards? Their parents should have used protection. I blame them.
