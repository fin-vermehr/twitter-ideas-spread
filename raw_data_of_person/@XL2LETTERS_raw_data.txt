936521150041075713 2017-12-01 09:03:36 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @RebelFleurr For real unfortunately. Let's get down to it. Abraham paid first tithe, it was optional not a law. It's not unscriptural to pay tithe. It's even the motive that is important. U r not paying pastors for work, u r supporting the work of God. If they misuse it, it's btw them n God
936519861689307136 2017-12-01 08:58:29 UTC <XL2LETTERS> Most of these pastors are too busy to reply daddy freeze, they are managing churches, and taking time out to seek the face of God for bigger issues, not answering OAPs with tithing debates.

It makes being faithful in marriage easier. Doesn't make u worth more than someone who has had sex tho. Just be faithful in marriage.
933954461256609792 2017-11-23 07:04:30 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 20. And finally, pls marry a God fearing woman, and you sef be a God fearing man! There are some things that only God n prayer can fix in a marriage.

933950529646063616 2017-11-23 06:48:52 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 14. Marry a woman who has a mind of her own, not a hive minded woman controlled by her friends. If she rolls with her friends too much, be careful. If they know all ur relationship business, don't marry her.
933950142062956545 2017-11-23 06:47:20 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 13. Marry a woman that you trust! Marry a woman who can cover ur secrets. Marry a friend who u can rely on. If u don't her don't put a ring on it.

933947757609537537 2017-11-23 06:37:51 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 9. Only a fool needs to be reminded not to cheat on his wife. If you wanna live like a dog n hump every other babe, stay single n sling all you want! Marriage is for mature folk.

933944449088081920 2017-11-23 06:24:43 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 6. Help out in the house bro. Help with the dishes n cooking when u can. Ur wife is meant to help you not to be ur slave. Once in a while buy food for the family to relieve her off cooking.
933944052176834560 2017-11-23 06:23:08 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 5. As u marry, u will spend less time with ur friends more time with her. It's normal. But don't lose urself trying to always spend time with her.

929618533578956800 2017-11-11 07:55:04 UTC <XL2LETTERS> The church is supposed to transform hearts and minds, and it is not done by force. So if a church member does something wrong, how is it the church's fault? Churches don't create zombies, who mechanically obey God's word! Same for pastors.

929319694976409600 2017-11-11 12:07:35 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus You are still referring to the law of moses, that is why you call it a tax, IT IS NOT A TAX OHHHHH DAMMY! we are not Jews, the law of Moses is dead n gone!
929319383238881282 2017-11-11 12:06:21 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus In Acts, the people gave 100%, because they were spiritually mature enough to do so. A lot of pastors empty their accounts for the work of God, n God rewards them in due time.
929319022893699072 2017-11-11 12:04:55 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus My point is tithing is an issue because deep down some people don't wanna pay anything to God's work on Earth but yet want the be blessed! If it wasn't , tithing won't be an issue.
929318685717811205 2017-11-11 12:03:35 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus There is something the head of my fellowship said and I believe he was directed by God. He said 'where or whom you gain from spiritually, is where you pay your tithe, if you grow by urself, pay to the less fortunate'
929318194329849856 2017-11-11 12:01:38 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus And which is why Jesus was angry with them. They we're paying tithe out of obligation n ignoring the heavier things like living an upright life and loving their neighbors.
929317879085981696 2017-11-11 12:00:22 UTC <XL2LETTERS> Tithing is a matter of spiritual maturity. That's the truth. If someone died for me, created me, gave me everything, guides me, teaches me, 10% is chicken change. It's not like I am paying for his blessings, it's to show I appreciate. Simple.https://twitter.com/DammyMarcus/status/929316908616306688

929316727552344065 2017-11-11 11:55:48 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus As I have stated, tithing is not compulsory, and if u don't tithe you are not cursed. A Christian is not obligated to pay tithe. Facts.
929316383883710467 2017-11-11 11:54:26 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus Ok, but the very first instance of tithing by Abraham, who gave Melchizedek (Jesus) without being instructed to. It is not a sin. Just as marriage is not a sin.
929315319188983809 2017-11-11 11:50:12 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus Well said. But tithing in itself is not wrong, not a sin, and the very origin of tithing was wilful and not a law or forced.

936521150041075713 2017-12-01 09:03:36 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @RebelFleurr For real unfortunately. Let's get down to it. Abraham paid first tithe, it was optional not a law. It's not unscriptural to pay tithe. It's even the motive that is important. U r not paying pastors for work, u r supporting the work of God. If they misuse it, it's btw them n God
936519861689307136 2017-12-01 08:58:29 UTC <XL2LETTERS> Most of these pastors are too busy to reply daddy freeze, they are managing churches, and taking time out to seek the face of God for bigger issues, not answering OAPs with tithing debates.

It makes being faithful in marriage easier. Doesn't make u worth more than someone who has had sex tho. Just be faithful in marriage.
933954461256609792 2017-11-23 07:04:30 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 20. And finally, pls marry a God fearing woman, and you sef be a God fearing man! There are some things that only God n prayer can fix in a marriage.
933954281606139904 2017-11-23 07:03:47 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 19. Marry someone who is willing to apologize and forgive. These 2 are too important. Trust me. Because there are many things u will do to each other that u need to overcome.
933953693069795329 2017-11-23 07:01:27 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 18. Marry a woman that has purpose, and a purpose you support, she must also support your own purpose. Notice I said purpose not just business. Big difference.
933952382278434816 2017-11-23 06:56:14 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 17. Never marry a woman who respects you solely on how much u earn. If someone richer comes along, ur marriage is in trouble.
933951780953690112 2017-11-23 06:53:51 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 16. Don't use sex to solve all ur problems in marriage, one day it won't be all that n the problems would have piled. Sit down n talk, discuss without creating arguments.
933951348596453376 2017-11-23 06:52:08 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 15. Never be too busy for ur woman. No give devil chance to let another man carry your woman away from you. Gist with her, laugh with her, Nack her well!
933950529646063616 2017-11-23 06:48:52 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 14. Marry a woman who has a mind of her own, not a hive minded woman controlled by her friends. If she rolls with her friends too much, be careful. If they know all ur relationship business, don't marry her.
933950142062956545 2017-11-23 06:47:20 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 13. Marry a woman that you trust! Marry a woman who can cover ur secrets. Marry a friend who u can rely on. If u don't her don't put a ring on it.
933949754035310593 2017-11-23 06:45:47 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 12. Pray with you woman. Trust me, it works like magic. That's why it's not good to fight with ur wife. If u fight, u can't pray with her, n blessings u need dey inside that joint prayer.
933948851387617280 2017-11-23 06:42:12 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 11. Don't go bankrupt on having a big wedding, if ur folks want a big wedding, they should drop big money, shekena. But secure ur house first before all the marriage wahala.

933947757609537537 2017-11-23 06:37:51 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 9. Only a fool needs to be reminded not to cheat on his wife. If you wanna live like a dog n hump every other babe, stay single n sling all you want! Marriage is for mature folk.
933947422891560960 2017-11-23 06:36:32 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 8. Have great sex with your wife alone. Keep fit, eat right, u got work to do young man. And make sure she climaxes as often as possible!
933944770015252480 2017-11-23 06:25:59 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 7. Never transfer aggression! This one is hard. Work, traffic is very stressful, I know. But do ur best not to transfer that to ur woman, if not u end up with a toxic marriage.
933944449088081920 2017-11-23 06:24:43 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 6. Help out in the house bro. Help with the dishes n cooking when u can. Ur wife is meant to help you not to be ur slave. Once in a while buy food for the family to relieve her off cooking.
933944052176834560 2017-11-23 06:23:08 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 5. As u marry, u will spend less time with ur friends more time with her. It's normal. But don't lose urself trying to always spend time with her.
933943363602087936 2017-11-23 06:20:24 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 4. Make ur wife happy n she will make u happy (if she is a good woman), be humble, let her have her way, be the bigger man, ladies first.

933942657658875904 2017-11-23 06:17:36 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @gboukzi 2. Marriage is about sacrifice. U can't be selfish n self centered and expect a marriage to work sir. Gotta think of her n the family first.

929319383238881282 2017-11-11 12:06:21 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus In Acts, the people gave 100%, because they were spiritually mature enough to do so. A lot of pastors empty their accounts for the work of God, n God rewards them in due time.
929319022893699072 2017-11-11 12:04:55 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus My point is tithing is an issue because deep down some people don't wanna pay anything to God's work on Earth but yet want the be blessed! If it wasn't , tithing won't be an issue.
929318685717811205 2017-11-11 12:03:35 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus There is something the head of my fellowship said and I believe he was directed by God. He said 'where or whom you gain from spiritually, is where you pay your tithe, if you grow by urself, pay to the less fortunate'
929318194329849856 2017-11-11 12:01:38 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus And which is why Jesus was angry with them. They we're paying tithe out of obligation n ignoring the heavier things like living an upright life and loving their neighbors.
929317879085981696 2017-11-11 12:00:22 UTC <XL2LETTERS> Tithing is a matter of spiritual maturity. That's the truth. If someone died for me, created me, gave me everything, guides me, teaches me, 10% is chicken change. It's not like I am paying for his blessings, it's to show I appreciate.

929316383883710467 2017-11-11 11:54:26 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus Ok, but the very first instance of tithing by Abraham, who gave Melchizedek (Jesus) without being instructed to. It is not a sin. Just as marriage is not a sin.
929315319188983809 2017-11-11 11:50:12 UTC <XL2LETTERS> @DammyMarcus Well said. But tithing in itself is not wrong, not a sin, and the very origin of tithing was wilful and not a law or forced.
