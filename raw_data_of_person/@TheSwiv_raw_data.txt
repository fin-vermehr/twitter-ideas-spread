701142246356348929 2016-02-20 20:31:52 UTC <TheSwiv> The trouble is if they'd called a ambulance, I'd have been in for weeks again.  It is nice that passers-by care.
701138365048102915 2016-02-20 20:16:27 UTC <TheSwiv> After a good day had to be rescued by Kirsty before a kindly passers-by called an ambulance. Home is better than hospital.
