728778162012835840 2016-05-06 02:47:08 UTC <mattteed> @DavidGilmore33 @Wilnerness590 it enables the pitcher who left in the middle of the inning to get the win.
728774401437663232 2016-05-06 02:32:11 UTC <mattteed> @Wilnerness590 Mike if a pitcher leaves say in middle of 7th and tied and team scores in bottom half then he would get the win.
