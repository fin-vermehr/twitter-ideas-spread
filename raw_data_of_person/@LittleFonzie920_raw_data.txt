970800149621600256 2018-03-05 23:16:06 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DonaldJTrumpJr ...your daddy had a bi-partisan deal that he refused to sign. Just because you string a lot of words in a sentence does not make them true.
970799624578650112 2018-03-05 23:14:01 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump ..you had a bi-partisan deal that you said you would not sign.
970755568552964096 2018-03-05 20:18:57 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump ...millions of people are addicted and dying because of opioid addictions from prescription pills...that was our doing.
970754161007579136 2018-03-05 20:13:22 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump You are a special kind of stupid for not realizing that we import specialized steel for some products we dont make in the United States. Furthermore, the country most effected would be Canada, which right now, we have a trade surplus with.
970753802985930758 2018-03-05 20:11:57 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump So much of what you say is false. If anything, the Obamas administration gave you more lee-way BECAUSE you were from the other party, and they wanted to preserve our Democracy. Who knew your campaign was being wiretapped? Not the public.
970315889160704000 2018-03-04 15:11:50 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @Marmel Sends wads of Russian cash at them...
970315382362988545 2018-03-04 15:09:49 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @mjfree @andrewbrodie331 It goes to show how entrenched we are on our sides. If you ask someone on the right about this they will, with a straight face, tell you he wasnt making fun of disabled people..and they will believe it!
970312159510040582 2018-03-04 14:57:01 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Huh? So some crazy billionaire is out there claiming that YOU were born in some African country?
970011174845763592 2018-03-03 19:01:00 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @The_Trump_Train Well then its a good thing we liberals dont want to abolish the second amendment
969924412916068353 2018-03-03 13:16:15 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews In the words of Maury Povich.. ...and thats a lie.
969923127215116293 2018-03-03 13:11:08 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Hey, 1995 called, they want their scapegoat back...
969794413277872128 2018-03-02 04:39:40 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Youre an embarrassment to our country! Russia shows a video of their new nuke hitting Florida, and you respond about your feelings getting hurt. Sad!
969723697681616901 2018-03-02 23:58:40 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @GovMikeHuckabee Hate won for a moment..then you were forced out and righteousness was once again restored!! Your views on homosexuality are a sin sir. Grow up, and maybe you can have a chair at the big boy table.
969315704712331266 2018-03-01 20:57:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Huh!?!? I hope they laugh at him and walk out. 17 people die at the hands of an AR-15, but lets blame video games. 
969235099593166848 2018-03-01 15:37:09 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Pssst..gun free zones have guns in them. They are strapped to trained professionals known as police officers.. 
969234857858621442 2018-03-01 15:36:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Our Aluminum industry is primarily owned by the banks who sell the aluminum to themselves to keep prices inflated. Nice try..
969234412679450624 2018-03-01 15:34:26 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews ...the government cannot go after a private business simply for not liking their views..even if I agree with this Governors sentiment.
969232876377133057 2018-03-01 15:28:19 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews ..ok..posting this once to show the craziness of people is one thing..but devoting multiple tweets to a rural church in Pennsylvania? Cmon NBC News.
969018121284661249 2018-02-28 01:14:58 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @SenDuckworth Paper ballots!!!!!
968895560223780864 2018-02-28 17:07:57 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @TheBrownFolder Yes..Nepotism is the reason she used for the question being inappropriate. Would it be inappropriate if Sarah Sanders got asked that question?
968870709228396549 2018-02-28 15:29:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN I wish people would at least understand facts. Gun free zones have guns..but only trained professionals known as police officers.
968863800282767360 2018-02-28 15:01:45 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @chrislhayes ...and cue a teacher shooting a student who isnt causing a mass shooting...
968861951634919425 2018-02-28 14:54:24 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @Amylostat40 @Mikeblumhardt I am the outdoorsy type. Also, Im not anti 2A. Im anti-non sportsman rifles.
968860891868487680 2018-02-28 14:50:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Bless a killing machine!? Oh Lord, what have we become?
968689365802274816 2018-02-27 03:28:36 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @mjfree ...dont worry about electronic ballots they said...we have safeguards they said... no need for paper ballots they said...
968686072598290432 2018-02-27 03:15:31 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DLoesch AR-15 DO sound different than a hunting rifle. Geeze..you guys are REALLY that blinded by propaganda that common sense goes right out the window!
968682088328294400 2018-02-27 02:59:41 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DLoesch What you fail to realize is in a country of 300 million people, some will slip through the cracks. What we are trying to do is make sure there isnt an AR-15 with an extended clip waiting for them when they are in the crack.
968681292379426816 2018-02-27 02:56:31 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DianaBialkowski @DLoesch @DonnaWR8 ...yeah..thats exactly what @realDonaldTrump does on a daily basis.
968266272806002689 2018-02-26 23:27:23 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @TheBrownFolder It is different in the fact one ran on it,letting people know that, as a married couple,they consult and are a team.They let the American people know that.The point of this wasnt even about http://nepotism.It was about a member of his administration being asked a question.
968244166814822401 2018-02-26 21:59:33 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @TheBrownFolder ..if you run on it, and tell the American people so they know what to expect, thats different than appointing after the election.
968240444420378624 2018-02-26 21:44:45 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Smart people who havent been in that situation HOPE they could. Stupid people who havent been in that situation believe they would.
968239478912544769 2018-02-26 21:40:55 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @Wendys Keep it forever!!! Once again be The best dollar menu in town!
968238037737136129 2018-02-26 21:35:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @TheBrownFolder So they told the American people what they were going to do and got elected on it? Very different. You would have had a better argument if you said JFK and RFK..
968179369255620609 2018-02-26 17:42:04 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Like he did at his rally when they thought there was a shooter? 
968178715736924166 2018-02-26 17:39:28 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @Tmbldr Well..I cant speak for the entire left. I can speak about history though..thank you for bringing up the Kennedys. What happened after JFK appointed his brother? Congress voted on a bill that did what? Attempt to stop nepotism.
968157123778670594 2018-02-26 16:13:40 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @LTMac61 @billobrien1968 @whatalife_1992 Wow...what does a vote do? What happens when someone gets the most votes? Who is the decision maker in that process? The decision maker is the boss. WE are the bosses, because we have the ability to fire them (I.e. vote them out of office.)
968156547766476801 2018-02-26 16:11:23 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @LTMac61 @billobrien1968 ...no...its not. Furthermore, the whole point of this thread was discussing how asking a Presidential advisor a question about the Presidents behavior was inappropriate.
968155365459283972 2018-02-26 16:06:41 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @FoxNews Is this the shooting survivor that our trashy President used to get campaign contributions?
968154836826034177 2018-02-26 16:04:35 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @la_smithee Of course there is something fishy, that is how propaganda works. Releasing information very slowly so @FoxNews can frame the story.
968154380569600002 2018-02-26 16:02:46 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @FoxNews You arent a news channel. You are an entertainment network! You should be sued for misrepresentation!
968152628646567939 2018-02-26 15:55:48 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @Tmbldr Nepotism is not a fallacy in this administration. See: Ivanka.
968151852285071360 2018-02-26 15:52:43 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @HearnBob No..thats an entertainment network. Not a news network.
968151066121564163 2018-02-26 15:49:36 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @joeltheornery Blind loyalty: the only true blind loyalty is Nepotism. See: Ivanka.
968150905592926208 2018-02-26 15:48:57 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @joeltheornery Groveling: See; Romney/Trump picture.
968150568685498368 2018-02-26 15:47:37 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @joeltheornery Cash: You mean like all politicians? Even more so now since citizens united? P.S. President Trump just sent out a donation e-mail with a picture of a 17 year old school shooting survivor!
968149422227025920 2018-02-26 15:43:04 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @TazerSnap Thats what is known as an assumption. You know what they say about assumptions, right?
968148669219426306 2018-02-26 15:40:04 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @LTMac61 @billobrien1968 Hence why, during the Apprentice, no one had a leg to stand on if they were upset that Ivanka was an advisor to her father. Now that she is a Govt employee, things are different.
968147895370309634 2018-02-26 15:37:00 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @LTMac61 @billobrien1968 Ok..stay with me class. When a private organization decides to hire someone, they dont need to answer to anyone besides themselves. When a public institution hires someone, they need to answer to the American people, because we are their bosses. Get it?
968145702768521221 2018-02-26 15:28:17 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @Wendys Thank you thank you THANK YOU Wendys!My fianc and I were moving and had to grab a quick bite @Hardees and they have a double cheeseburger for $1. I almost took a picture and put it on your page to say that you have officially been dethroned as the best dollar menu. Not anymore!
968144597175209985 2018-02-26 15:23:53 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore @Tmbldr ...and how many times did Hillary get asked about Monica? Oh, and since we are on the subject, how did the right feel about a politician having an affair on his wife? Please apply same logic now.
968143906843045889 2018-02-26 15:21:09 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore Furthermore, if you dont think that a payoff and an affair is a fair question for a Presidential advisor to answer, then YOUR bias is showing.
968143260765032450 2018-02-26 15:18:35 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore Every Presidential administration gets asked the tough questions. It happened under Obama, Bush, Clinton and so forth. Its not liberal just because it happens to be a tough question against the right. Its called a free press.
968140826206498817 2018-02-26 15:08:54 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Merit based..yeah..because its so easy to tell which 12 year old that we grant citizenship to will become successful... 
968139758290591744 2018-02-26 15:04:40 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro Ivanka WORKS at the White House. Chelsea merely lived there. Big difference.
968139114917883904 2018-02-26 15:02:06 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @benshapiro @jaketapper @_treymore Did Chelsea Clinton work in the White House? No. The Clintons didnt use Nepotism when appointing people.
968138682908758017 2018-02-26 15:00:23 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN Yes..for a daughter to the President it is in appropriate. As an employee at the White House, it is highly appropriate.
968121425637859328 2018-02-26 13:51:49 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You used a high school shooting survivor to solicit money for your campaign. #presidentwhitetrash

967928671343398912 2018-02-25 01:05:53 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN How can one disagree about intelligence!? One is lying, and one has the last name of Schiff.
967928032894898176 2018-02-25 01:03:20 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DLoesch @NRATV ..I guess one persons holding accountable is another persons parcels through real journalism to frame a narrative. ..notice how all those press clippings say opinion?
967835533220118529 2018-02-25 18:55:47 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @rebhawkn2 @phlubup @mgw926 If you want to look at how much was added under an individual President, one needs to look up deficit spending per year. Lesson to make you less stupid.
967835162514948096 2018-02-25 18:54:18 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @rebhawkn2 @phlubup @mgw926 Youre right..you didnt see liberals up in arms about the National DEBT because liberals are smart. The National Debt is the debt that has accumulated over the lifespan of our great nation. I wont say the right is stupid, but you just proved you are.
967826010640089088 2018-02-25 18:17:56 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @VollrathTammie @Infidevil Yes! Do THAT!! Then, all the sane people would be free of this massive waste of tax funds.
967817874587967488 2018-02-25 17:45:37 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @rebhawkn2 @phlubup @mgw926 And get stuff done? Oh he will. Hell build a wall that WE will pay for..he already overhauled our tax plan and robbed the middle class to give to the wealthy. Hell get stuff done alright...
967817008158052357 2018-02-25 17:42:10 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @rebhawkn2 @phlubup @mgw926 Lol..struggle? I suppose its a matter of perspective what struggle is. In my book struggling is wondering how youre going to pay for groceries, or how you will pay for your rent/mortgage. Do I think Donald had to go through that? No.
967807609146404864 2018-02-25 17:04:49 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @rebhawkn2 @phlubup @mgw926 Real job? He was born into wealth. The only thing he earned was a golden ticket in the birth lottery.
967804311597207557 2018-02-25 16:51:43 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @NinaHarrelsonTV @apenutz37 Far left? No..lets get a few facts straight. The right has moved soooo far off the political spectrum that center,to you, looks like left. Let me ask you something..how often are you TOLD that the liberal media is conveniently responsible for all the bad things Republicans do?
967779247971586048 2018-02-25 15:12:07 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @PPFA @CNN @davidhogg111 @NRA @CareyDavisFml @MTMason @pat_prerost @Mark15King The best part about this meme is I have fired both. VERY different shooting styles. When gun owners post this, I know they dont know what they are talking about.
967777457477701635 2018-02-25 15:05:00 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @NinaHarrelsonTV @apenutz37 She gets paid for sharing the news. She puts it in context because shes nice...and a journalist..
967501491496996864 2018-02-24 20:48:25 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Why has the Republican Party taken on so many traits of sociopaths? Republicans have gerrymandered some states so bad, that federal judges have overruled them! What have federal judges said about these maps?
967433983016558593 2018-02-24 16:20:10 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @marcorubio Losing their grip? What does a grip do? Hmmmm...lets see. It makes it quicker to aim with precision and take out many targets in a short amount of time. So yes..that is a big difference when you are talking about those targets being humans.
967422320141832192 2018-02-24 15:33:49 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @PaleoBeard 100% agree! The Liason Officer at the school in Florida proves that. Prior to this incident he was praised as a great Liason Officer. He was a good guy. However, when confronted with ending someones life, he couldnt. That doesnt make him a coward, just human.
967406573290229760 2018-02-24 14:31:15 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump You are so right about AFRICAN AMERICAN unemployment. When you came into office, you waived a magic wand and poof! Lowest African American unemployment in history. 
967405011943723009 2018-02-24 14:25:03 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @PaleoBeard I think Trump is a moron as well, but I do believe there are guns in the room when the Presidents in the room (secret service.)
967278695445618688 2018-02-23 06:03:06 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews ...said no teacher ever..oh wait..yes..the jerk teacher who was always on a power trip. The great teachers would never in a million years do it, because they are smart enough to realize they may have to kill one of their own students @realDonaldTrump
967276809539739653 2018-02-23 05:55:37 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews If youre trying to avoid something very unfortunate for the world by DOING something very unfortunate to the world, doesnt that just make you the mad man? @realDonaldTrump
967275432256200704 2018-02-23 05:50:08 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump E Pluribus unum!!!!!!
967053863357440001 2018-02-23 15:09:42 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @jaketapper Called a LIASON Officer a coward. Wow. This is why the good guy with a gun argument is invalid. One will never know if they can end a life until they are presented with the situation.
967028567677849601 2018-02-23 13:29:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DLoesch Are you going to talk about how youre a coward? How you wouldnt dare say the media loves crying white mothers at the town hall, but have no problem saying it at CPAC? #dloesschcoward
967028166136082432 2018-02-23 13:27:35 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Ahhhh..gotta love nepotism.
967024151839027201 2018-02-23 13:11:38 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @browardsheriff @DLoesch ...and this is what makes your good guy with a gun argument invalid.

Its time to try things, and I believe,a ban on assault style weapons, as well as high capacity magazines is something we should try.

If they would have a choice between walking into a gun shop, or the 27 steps to make their own, they will most likely choose the gun shop.
966759648941494272 2018-02-22 19:40:36 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CPAC @NRA @cameron_kasky @aj_harris86 @viper___jet @holywar777 @tresmonsieur201 Yes..many criminals will be stopped. What is more likely..a deranged individual walks into a gun store and buys a gun, or deranged individual goes out, acquires a 3-D printer, gets schematics for AR-15, 3-D prints an AR-15, then makes their bullets....
966758318302810112 2018-02-22 19:35:19 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NRA @waynelapierrejr Can I call you out for a duel? Since you dont believe guns are the issue, and anything can kill, you get a pencil and I get an AR-15. Sound fair?
966756971113336840 2018-02-22 19:29:58 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Well its good the NRA is ready to write our laws...oh wait..what!?
966756449534832640 2018-02-22 19:27:53 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CPAC @NRA @cameron_kasky @aj_harris86 @viper___jet @holywar777 @tresmonsieur201 We, as a society, have always used the lessons of yesterday to effect our policies for the future. This is not new. What weapon would be used then? A gun that isnt as effective at killing mass amounts of people in a limited amount of time.
966732684885135364 2018-02-22 17:53:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CPAC @NRA @cameron_kasky @aj_harris86 @viper___jet @tresmonsieur201 @holywar777 The AR-15 was the tool used. Why in the world are some so obtuse..you see children, its not about killing, its about the effectiveness and speed at which one can kill. Thats the most important point. Thats why in the most deadly shootings on US soil involve an AR-15.
966723508054233088 2018-02-22 17:16:59 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CPAC @NRA @cameron_kasky @aj_harris86 @viper___jet @tresmonsieur201 @holywar777 A person with an AR-15 got up and killed people. A weapon that can shoot multiple rounds per second. A person alone could not have caused the carnage that has unfolded time and time again in our schools, at the Las Vegas concert, or the movie theatre shooting.
966721066201739264 2018-02-22 17:07:17 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @toddstarnes Oh my lord..because they wrote the questions out, they are scripted!? Get a clue.  
966720264867328000 2018-02-22 17:04:06 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @toddstarnes @InfiniteDaveC @ExposeAltRite @LouiseJune18 The assumptions are what this original post is meant to sow. It would be really easy for a reporter to go ask the father if he pulled his child from the town hall, as CNN s statement says. Unfortunately, they would rather ask who do you BELIEVE, instead of facts.
966719345253601285 2018-02-22 17:00:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @toddstarnes @WeeJimmyLogie ...except for this kid...this kid supports their agenda, so hes good!
966719031360319488 2018-02-22 16:59:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @toddstarnes How about you research CNNs statement and see if its true, rather than who do you believe. Oh thats right, your goal isnt to be a journalist, but rather an entertainer.. 
966718241845514240 2018-02-22 16:56:04 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CPAC @NRA @cameron_kasky @aj_harris86 @viper___jet @tresmonsieur201 Yes..do that..especially about the part about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No one is talking about taking away handguns or hunting rifles. Only semi-automatic rifles that have been proven, time and time again, to infringe on our right to live.

966708290897014785 2018-02-22 16:16:31 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NRA I believe CNNs statement until Fox News (or the NRAs news outlet) can provide evidence that their statement was false. Most likely you wont though, as your primary focus isnt facts, but seeds of doubt.
966707164692836352 2018-02-22 16:12:03 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN The problem with his statement is as usual. Weve done it the NRAs way for many years, and we still have as usual when talking about school shootings. Its time to try something different!
966702628402024449 2018-02-22 15:54:01 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @JackPosobiec Heres a test for you Jack..watch Fox News for an hour and every time they say liberal media, or mainstream media put a hash down on a piece of paper. Then go to CNN and do the same for conservative media. Then tell me who are more journalistic.
966701688668254208 2018-02-22 15:50:17 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NRA @realDonaldTrump Thats pretty easy to say when they have you 30 million dollars.. 
966700948834930688 2018-02-22 15:47:21 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Its very apparent that youve never gone to a public school. Guess which teachers would want the guns? The teachers who have the power trips. The good ones would never want to carry a gun as they would know that youd be asking them to kill one of their students.
966328371272671232 2018-02-21 15:06:51 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @ChrisChastainSC Of course she responded this way. Look at her body language. The sad part is, this reminds me of how Fox News will send that idiot out and ambush targeted individuals to ask them hyperbolic questions.
966018661482942464 2018-02-20 18:36:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @JackKingston Pssst..its not the intel community..they have been traditionally right leaning since the beginning of time. However they are Americans first. Its you, and the side you represent that needs to stop making this a partisan issue.
965996265795407873 2018-02-20 17:07:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BrandonLeeTV @Estleton12 ..and the fun of shooting an AR-15 is now lessened by the knowledge of knowing that this is the weapon of choice for mass shooters.
965995508140531712 2018-02-20 17:04:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BrandonLeeTV @Estleton12 Any gun that can fire multiple rounds per second is fun (Ive shot an AR-15,) but doesnt lend itself to the sportsmanship of hunting.
965994989242277889 2018-02-20 17:02:07 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BrandonLeeTV @Estleton12 Probably blocked you because he started out by explaining exactly what you slammed him on (him not being a hunter or gun owner.) Just because you are not a hunter, or gun owner doesnt mean you cant have an opinion.
965947078999408640 2018-02-20 13:51:44 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BrandonLeeTV @Estleton12 Chris, I am a hunter, and you are false. One of the most disgusting things I hear on opening morning (and throughout our two week deer hunt,) is the sound of tap,tap,tap,tap,tap.  This sound and cadence is different than a traditional hunting rifle, or shotgun.
965599537783037952 2018-02-19 14:50:44 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @keslar_emerson 2 security guards? Do you know how huge most of these schools are?

See, Im not sure if youre aware, but the NRA spends A LOT of money to make sure regulations on guns are kept to a minimum. Therefore, the topic was NRA spending, not the broader topic, which is campaign spending.
965292156842848257 2018-02-18 18:29:19 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @yvon6463 @jonb1000 @KellyJBlanpied You inferred that Trump didnt get any money from the NRA. I provided you with information that disputed that claim. Your response? Run to Hillary.

965276860656574464 2018-02-18 17:28:32 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @jaketapper @SusanBakerDeeds ...you do realize that there was just an indictment of 13 RUSSIANS doing what your meme describes. For the love of the United States, realize the reality of the situation at hand and put your anger towards what really matters. Our foreign enemies, not your domestic ones.

If the gun debate has taught me anything, its how easily manipulated some can be when they want to. Not to mention the tactics are horrible, you proved me wrong on this point, so Ill bring up this now.
965004490918322176 2018-02-17 23:26:14 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @RyanAFournier @MichRourk ..you mean the argument that 60% of the guns used in Chicago come from OUTSIDE OF THE STATE!!!

Its proven through the fact that we are the only nation with this problem. We are also the only nation that allows 18 year olds to buy weapons meant to kill PEOPLE, not animals.
963820919042072583 2018-02-14 17:03:08 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @TheJadeCox @BBlahbah Please source where that information came from..because that seems like a lie. Furthermore, a trip to Africa is considered state business, going to Florida almost every weekend is just traveling to another state.
963808500202770433 2018-02-14 16:13:47 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @SpeakerRyan Yeah..that $1.50 for a public school secretary REALLY improves lives.

959099064439787520 2018-02-01 16:20:10 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @DrMosesAB Maybe its because Nunez doctored up the document before it went to the White House. Maybe it was because Nunez cherry picked information to make it look like nothing was wrong. Maybe it was because the FBI confirmed that Nunez doctored these documents. But no. Youre right.

Its the reason you see so many out-patient facilities popping up. Why? Because hospitals get paid more through Medicare if they can get you out quicker.
946509909637640192 2017-12-28 22:35:22 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @DemConsigliere @chyang888 Im talking about their factories in China. Foxconn elected to go to China to save money and essentially use forced labor. As a Wisconsinite, I am not happy about rewarding a company with these practices.

946398299522772992 2017-12-28 15:11:52 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NinaHarrelsonTV You mean the unemployment that has continued to go down from President Obama? You do realize President Obama holds the record for most months with employment gains, right? Also, Trumps gains are less than Obamas when you Look year over year. Nice try.
946057281166299136 2017-12-27 16:36:47 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Queue the racists who are easily manipulated by someone stating their opinions when they involve race...
945721464577282048 2017-12-26 18:22:22 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @foxandfrlends @realDonaldTrump Is our President stroking out again? This doesnt even make sense.
945381732089520129 2017-12-25 19:52:23 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump The Obamas have over 300k likes on their Christmas message. Didnt your bring that back? 
945337867412410368 2017-12-25 16:58:05 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Uh oh..Obamas MERRY CHRISTMAS post has 300k likes...I thought you brought that back?
945168876458954752 2017-12-24 05:46:35 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump @shawgerald4 @unravelingjenna I feel sorry for you that you stopped saying it. Obviously youre alone as Christmas commercials, television shows, peoples houses, restaurants, etc. have been saying it after Thanksgiving for at least the last 50 years. #stopdrinkingthekoolaid
944957465099202562 2017-12-24 15:46:30 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN Kinda sucks for our Jewelish service men and women...
944948679521206272 2017-12-24 15:11:36 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @seanrose2045 Only for stupid people who dont understand the Abrahamic religions.
944948530598367235 2017-12-24 15:11:00 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @OneNation0 The fruit of Islam is the Abrahamic religion. Same as Christians and same as Jewish people. Learn your religious history. SMH
944948165073080320 2017-12-24 15:09:33 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @mickeyseeker6 ..yeah..its not like Jesus is mentioned more in the Koran than Mohammmed or anything...smh
944634504974618624 2017-12-23 18:23:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN The epitome of pay to play.
944589252196818944 2017-12-23 15:23:22 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews No! Just KNOW that speech that may incite violence is not protected. This has been on the books for awhile. We just need to be smarter.
944557708216291333 2017-12-23 13:18:01 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 I used to work in health savings accounts (HSAs.) I would receive calls from people who turned 65 who were giddy that they now received Medicare, and didnt need the crappy insurance. The VA is hindered because veterans cant go to regular hospitals. We need to take profit out!
944556857967996928 2017-12-23 13:14:38 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Havent you realized that the right has taught you to hate the messenger so youll never believe any of their messages? Me; I just took the statistics from where Trump got his numbers (right wing source,) and established my argument. You: Nope, left leaning source. End of story.
944407634643488769 2017-12-22 03:21:41 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Yes. The governments role is to step in when sectors dont fall under the capitalistic model. ...like healthcare..
944406759095062529 2017-12-22 03:18:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 .15% of their population.  ..and thats from a right wing source.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/11/trumps-claim-about-canadians-traveling-to-the-united-states-for-medical-care/
944263021811159040 2017-12-22 17:47:02 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump I remember a time when the corporate tax rate was 90% with deductions for expansion and hiring new employees. This put the focus on making America great, as opposed to making shareholders and CEOs even more rich. SMH
944262053103009794 2017-12-22 17:43:11 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NewsandGuts @haywood_cm I agree. He did this awhile ago when sales started slipping, only to come back when quality went down. This could be more of a hiatus.
944234930795663360 2017-12-22 15:55:25 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 We have never been a 100% Capitalist society. Ever heard of SOCIAL security? The beauty of our country is that we provide a safety net so people wont starve to death. P.S. How do you like your fire and police departments? Again, elements of socialism.
944233932790419456 2017-12-22 15:51:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Thats false. Also, did you know that Canada just past The U.S. in regards to the richest middle class?
944006625152643072 2017-12-21 00:48:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews So when our Embassy is attacked multiple times are you going to take responsibility for that too? Will you remember this day then as well?
944006086625021952 2017-12-21 00:46:04 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 No it doesnt. Unless youre forgetting about our infant mortality rate, our total number of Americans in the prison system, and the fact that we are the only industrialized nation in the world without healthcare. Then you may have an argument.
943873526481682432 2017-12-21 15:59:19 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Yeah..because we werent a bully before. Until @realDonaldTrump that is...
943871322412716032 2017-12-21 15:50:34 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @eshh85 @stcyjnkens @blizzard_tony Capitalism fails when you dont have a choice. Thats healthcare. You dont have a choice.
943871142837747712 2017-12-21 15:49:51 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @CNN @eshh85 @blizzard_tony ..and it went up higher before Obamas entered office. Thats why it became a huge issue in the 2008 elections.
943870357202710528 2017-12-21 15:46:44 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump If other news outlets did to you what Fox does to Democrats, youd have a stroke.
943870142202765312 2017-12-21 15:45:52 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump ..the tax scam is about as popular as you are right now... (so you are completely aware, thats LOW!!)
943869848207200261 2017-12-21 15:44:42 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Why!? This has been debunked time and time again! It takes multiple international approvals as well as multiple approvals within the U.S. Hillary wasnt the only decision maker!!!
943634797678690304 2017-12-20 00:10:42 UTC <LittleFonzie920> In the key of the Folgers jingle;The best part of waking up,is a tax scam passed in the middle of the night that will have adverse effects on your job because your pay is directly effected by how the middle class is doing.Well that didnt have the same ring to it:/ @maddow
943497779695013889 2017-12-20 15:06:14 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @newtgingrich @squirellsRnutz Well, the most recent example is the Bush tax cuts that expired. Also, its written in this tax plan. ..literally written in this tax plan...
943475735301447683 2017-12-20 13:38:38 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Your a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
943475077361946624 2017-12-20 13:36:02 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews ACA took over a year and multiple congressional hearings to pass. The tax scam took a mere month with no hearings. This is the difference between how Republicans do things, and how Democrats to things.
943474414687019008 2017-12-20 13:33:24 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @POTUS @marcthiessen @HeatherChilders ..and the worst approval rating of any president in their first 11 months..coincidence? I think not.
943474073207803905 2017-12-20 13:32:02 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @newtgingrich It does in the short term. In the long term it is wealth hoarding. Dont focus on my 6-figure tax cut. Youll see a tax cut of hundreds of dollars.
943473420154654720 2017-12-20 13:29:26 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @DanScavino ...or because the bigger issue is coordination between a group with illegally obtained documents and a Presidential campaign... Jr. is just too stupid to realize that.
943472769362202624 2017-12-20 13:26:51 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Thats fine, know that Im not a liberal because they are my team.Im a liberal because I believe everyone has the right to healthcare.Im a liberal because the top .1% of Americans holds more wealth than the bottom half of our country.These arent lies fed to me.These are facts.
943319035772620802 2017-12-19 03:15:58 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews Speaking of listening, how many hearings did Republicans have before they voted on this bill? 0! You have to have hearings to listen!
943222268783681541 2017-12-19 20:51:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Yeah..like Al Franken.See,Im not saying this stuff to gain a point in our debate.Id rather have you realize how bad Republicans are making this country by playing to peoples fears.When one hates the opposing side,it makes any outlandish claim believable.See: Benghazi,UraniumRS
943149433851645952 2017-12-19 16:02:02 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NewDay ..but citizens wont learn about the clean up until its law!? SMH
943147020277239814 2017-12-19 15:52:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Yeah..he did, because thats what Democrats do when they are negatively brought into the spotlight. They step down. ..unlike Republicans..
943146732875124737 2017-12-19 15:51:18 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Since EVERYONE needs healthcare, the marketplace is flush with consumers! The problem is associating profit with human life. Thats immoral.
942923684385312770 2017-12-18 01:04:59 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 The people who made that video have been tried and convicted in a court of law for using deceptive journalism tactics as well as misleading slicing of their footage to make it seem really bad.
942923095450505217 2017-12-18 01:02:39 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Exactly!Healthcare would be in the service category,like getting your hair cut,or getting your car repaired. The differences are, healthcare is life or death,and everyone will need healthcare at some point in their lives.That makes it a monopoly, which we should be protected from
942896847055675393 2017-12-18 23:18:21 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 ...thats false. If it was discovered that a political party paid someone to incite violence, A LOT of people would be going to jail.
942896403331903488 2017-12-18 23:16:35 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Cell phones are different then health insurance because a cell phone is a physical object. Healthcare is not. Furthermore, healthcare is a matter of life and death. We value life at a far greater monetary value than we value cell phones.
942867185290104832 2017-12-18 21:20:29 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Its a shame though..because your bio leads one to believe that deep down, we agree. We do need affordable healthcare. We wont get it with Trump.
942851574048739329 2017-12-18 20:18:27 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 I heard Trump advise that it was ok to hit a protester. Ive seen a Trump supporter punch a protester. Ive heard Nazis praising Trump. Ive seen a Trump supporter run over a protester. Which incident are you referring too?
942850579390398465 2017-12-18 20:14:30 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 Benghazi had over 10 government hearings!!! And NO CHARGES! What happened is an illusion in your head! Fox News is the reason we are rated so low. Because people such as yourself dont allow facts to lead you to conclusions,but rather you reach your conclusion and search o/ facts
942806170972180480 2017-12-18 17:18:02 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @brookefoxnews WHO did he send the money too? Its these important MISSING little facts that allow @FoxNews propaganda machine to run. Hes brown and hes from Pakistan..he must be a terrorist! SMH
942796347467542528 2017-12-18 16:39:00 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @Scaramucci @FoxNews Why would he have to when he has a whole television network devoted to his propaganda. Speaking of which...can one get sued for saying a government agency is planning a coup with no evidence to back it up?
942780740051316738 2017-12-18 15:36:59 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCFirstRead @NBCNews @Nance0881 ..thats exactly what your side did when Obama was president. Who came up with the term Obamacare?
942752929873907712 2017-12-18 13:46:28 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCSports @NBCNews Yes they do! ...which is why when someone is shot by police without a weapon and had their hands in the air, we should be outraged.
942751502573232128 2017-12-18 13:40:48 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @foxandfriends @bodine08 The only idiots here are the ones who believe an NFL team would not be profitable. Oh..and people who want to BELIEVE that the protests are intended to disrespect our military. They are idiots too.
942750481654452224 2017-12-18 13:36:44 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @foxandfriends @2UsDeplorables Has your guy Trump not taught you anything? Denying can get you very far. What cant get you very far? A money trail that proves your guilt!
942749984096706561 2017-12-18 13:34:46 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @foxandfriends @TED0781 ..he is getting out because hes a sexist, racist jerk who shilled out millions of dollars in settlements.

942088559946805248 2017-12-16 17:46:30 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @yates_ricky ...yeah..thats the local part. Furthermore he wasnt a community witness. He was a community organizer. He did more than witness.
942077093759905793 2017-12-16 17:00:56 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @NBCNews @yates_ricky ..yeah..its not like community organizing lets you see first hand the plight of our citizens at a local level or anything...smh

941703157863927808 2017-12-15 16:15:03 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @GovWalker You are giving BILLIONS of OUR dollars to a corporation that has suicide nets in front of their factories. Rewarding corporations that need suicide nets so their workers wont kill themselves is SICK!

941032207237382144 2017-12-13 19:48:56 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BernieSanders @realamericadrew Who bought him!? Calling him a socialist and saying he was bought and paid for is an oxymoron.

940617911860854784 2017-12-12 16:22:40 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Your administration initiated the probe! YOU, through your administration, appointed Mueller who has already found wrongdoing. #realnews
940610421526028289 2017-12-12 15:52:54 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump So you believe unemployment numbers now? Of course you do, because now they make you look good! ...unfortunately not as good as Obamas numbers though..
940597035459317762 2017-12-12 14:59:43 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump THANKS OBAMA!
940596815690334208 2017-12-12 14:58:50 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump Its not Democrats you stain on Democracy! Its AMERICANS. When one is suspected of colluding with a foreign power, AMERICANS investigate. P.S. They have already charged two people who pled GUILTY, so your just blabbering.
940595671198990337 2017-12-12 14:54:18 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump ..and Roy Moore is a pedophile. Vote Jones!  I win!

940226686704025600 2017-12-11 14:28:05 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump So you must be a mind reader then! As A LOT of your tweets are just what Fox News said 5 minutes earlier...

940058462792196098 2017-12-10 03:19:37 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @BernieSanders @jimlanham Its not about the people who earn it. Its about the people who make the most money from it. This is about CEOs, not a foreman in a factory. This is about multi-generational wealth, where people who dont earn it also dont have to pay taxes on it.
940050555262476288 2017-12-10 02:48:12 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @Lrihendry ...half of America didnt support him.

939977986014695424 2017-12-10 21:59:50 UTC <LittleFonzie920> @realDonaldTrump The stain on America is the skid mark known as your presidency! #scrooGOP
