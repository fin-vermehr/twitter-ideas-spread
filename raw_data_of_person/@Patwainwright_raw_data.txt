966057027209453568 2018-02-20 21:08:38 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail I keep hearing that thing is way better than it has any right to be.
944851011264565248 2017-12-24 08:43:30 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman Happy to do my bit, Mr H.
944617576734306305 2017-12-23 17:15:55 UTC <Patwainwright> Approaching the 4 year anniversary of that time I ate an entire chocolate orange in 10 minutes.
943872990122532864 2017-12-21 15:57:11 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir Best ending music of all time.
934742834657349632 2017-11-26 11:17:13 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail Conventional cameras seem to be unable to capture your dog's features. I'm concerned that she may be an interloper from a hell dimension. Something to consider.
932352417869557760 2017-11-19 20:58:33 UTC <Patwainwright> The new Morrissey song is so astonishingly bad it actually makes me like The Smiths less.
921685498950799360 2017-10-21 10:32:01 UTC <Patwainwright> Finished Mario Rabbids just in time for Odyssey next week. Plus destiny 2 PC on Tuesday. Really need to clone myself.
921378350991663105 2017-10-20 14:11:31 UTC <Patwainwright> I love that bit in Fire Walk With Me where David Bowie is just screaming in big trousers.
914052449513611264 2017-09-30 09:01:00 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight Everytime by Britney Spears. Lovely song, that.
913717048328507392 2017-09-29 10:48:15 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail I could never get my head around that mechanic, I'd like to see From revisit it at some point though.
913101941462507527 2017-09-27 18:04:02 UTC <Patwainwright> @jozborne Nice one chief!
910415798887428097 2017-09-20 08:10:15 UTC <Patwainwright> @jozborne You can't lead with a three! This is Go Johnny Go Go Go Go, not Bamalama-Fizz-Vaj...
901703783352344578 2017-08-27 07:11:49 UTC <Patwainwright> @itsmaccy If I was your neighbour, I'd like it.
900482016189321217 2017-08-23 22:16:57 UTC <Patwainwright> @Chazzmission Yep, lovely stuff isn't it? Also, that bit in chemical plant zone with the moving diagonal blocks is still a complete bastard, it turns out.
900042458381393920 2017-08-22 17:10:18 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight Completely couldn't handle that. I'm a mess.
894466856282730497 2017-08-07 07:54:51 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail You do realise that will involve playing ff8? Shudder...
893237203039649793 2017-08-03 22:28:39 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman Yeah it's fantastic mate, can't recommend it highly enough!
893189069634719744 2017-08-03 19:17:23 UTC <Patwainwright> I still think about Nier Automata most days, months after finishing it. A genuine masterpiece.
891217518630719488 2017-07-29 08:43:09 UTC <Patwainwright> What makes someone think it's OK to smoke in a kid's playground? Seeing this a lot recently.
884457804781821953 2017-07-10 17:02:27 UTC <Patwainwright> @IanCutress That's a great price for Rift & Touch. I love my Vive, but not sure its worth twice the price.
882668855981735943 2017-07-05 18:33:49 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir My tactics were generally "build 30 mammoth tanks, click in middle of enemy base then wait until everything blows up". Worked well.
882665231528452097 2017-07-05 18:19:24 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir Terrifying stuff mate. I spent too long playing command and conquer generals to not be scared by this.
879799412024913920 2017-06-27 20:31:40 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail Nice. With odyssey and xenoblade still to come this year, and even that rabbids thing actually looking good, Nintendo killing it right now.
879797745233612805 2017-06-27 20:25:02 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail Yep, the Switch is awesome. Is Arms worth a go then? Still occupied with Zelda, Mario Kart and Bomberman currently.
878514470833852416 2017-06-24 07:25:46 UTC <Patwainwright> @stevomax @ewenmacintosh @mrmatthickman Mungo Jerry!
872928849427869703 2017-06-08 21:30:30 UTC <Patwainwright> So it turns out campaigning on a platform of the removal of human rights might be a bad call. Who knew?
872556804580012033 2017-06-07 20:52:08 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight I know. Imagine the life choices you've made if somehow you consider that term a pejorative.
870033269445844992 2017-05-31 21:44:30 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight I still remember the night you were so into Christmas Steps you almost plunged to your death out of your loft window. Listen to the drums!!
868742982211690496 2017-05-28 08:17:22 UTC <Patwainwright> @samdimmer Seems like a productive day mate! I'm currently trying to shepherd my crew out into town, easier said than done...
859502463308754945 2017-05-02 20:18:50 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir Exciting! If I had that I would probably spend all my evenings constantly slapping Ornstein and Smough in the face.
859483579050594304 2017-05-02 19:03:48 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir Ooh, is that the dark souls board game? You played it yet?
859354938555723776 2017-05-02 10:32:38 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman Indeed mate. A timeless classic for sure.
859135650716680193 2017-05-01 20:01:15 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight Yep, always lovely to see those.
859118318648774657 2017-05-01 18:52:23 UTC <Patwainwright> Just finished the 5 story endings in Nier Automata and Im a complete mess. Incredible experience. And I definitely didn't have a little cry.
856964801238626305 2017-04-25 20:15:04 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail @GavWeir Boobs is boobs tho mate.
856964439249125377 2017-04-25 20:13:38 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail @GavWeir I dunno you guys. I remember playing that on my mates mega cd and I think there were almost some boobs at one point.
856571953947303936 2017-04-24 18:14:02 UTC <Patwainwright> You probably played Assassins Creed 3 on the WiiU.
856094149589782528 2017-04-23 10:35:25 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir @TightToTheNail Right, maybe I'll try one day. Too much else to play right now and Nier is blowing my tiny mind.
856072170610536448 2017-04-23 09:08:05 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail Oh shit, congrats! I've finished the game several times but never quite felt up to that particular challenge.
855885689627475968 2017-04-22 20:47:04 UTC <Patwainwright> Just finished the first playthrough of Nier Automata and by crikey I'm ploughing straight through into the second. Holy shit.
853901675144388609 2017-04-17 09:23:18 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail Say hi to O&S for me. What a pair of arseholes.
853337786950311940 2017-04-15 20:02:37 UTC <Patwainwright> My god, the music in Nier Automata is incredible.
851058322769948674 2017-04-09 13:04:50 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail It's next on the list for me once I'm finished with mass effect. Heard too much good stuff not to.
850795095397990401 2017-04-08 19:38:52 UTC <Patwainwright> I could never consistently achieve U Rappin Cool in Parappa. It always seemed just out of reach.
850081527203581954 2017-04-06 20:23:24 UTC <Patwainwright> Ahh, Kos, or some say Kosm... Do you hear our prayers? As you once did for the vacuous Rom, Grant us eyes, grant us eyes.
849665776965607424 2017-04-05 16:51:21 UTC <Patwainwright> Remember when MGS4 was an astounding, unique experience in almost every way and then Star Sailor inexplicably plays over the end credits?
849663012390797312 2017-04-05 16:40:22 UTC <Patwainwright> @WillSmithGCC @louistwois I found that way funnier than I should have done. People are staring at me on the train.
849659320816066561 2017-04-05 16:25:42 UTC <Patwainwright> @WillSmithGCC @louistwois True. A bigger potential issue will arise when our computer servants inevitably gain sentience and turn on us. That'd be one angry bin.
849512344866754560 2017-04-04 06:41:40 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois I never understood who that thing was aimed at. Or why it was so expensive. Or why it was in a bin. Weird product all round, really!
849370111786012672 2017-04-04 21:16:29 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois Really? Amazing!
849322034664546309 2017-04-04 18:05:27 UTC <Patwainwright> Hey do you remember when apple released that desktop computer but it was in a bin for some reason and you couldn't upgrade it.
846454735615995906 2017-03-27 20:11:49 UTC <Patwainwright> Question Time Brexit Special? I'd rather watch a video of my own testicles being set on fire.
845986206844407810 2017-03-26 13:10:04 UTC <Patwainwright> You probably bought the HD-dvd addon for the 360. And still use it.
845961842212192256 2017-03-26 11:33:15 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman I had not! Lovely stuff indeed.
840650097402748929 2017-03-11 19:46:16 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois I can't help but feel partially responsible for that...
840647939563352066 2017-03-11 19:37:41 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois the bag was overflowing mate, never seen anything like it in my life.
840645948619575296 2017-03-11 19:29:47 UTC <Patwainwright> When I was at school someone I knew once spent 7 on pick n mix like it was nothing. I have never gotten over this.
833408487321387009 2017-02-19 20:10:42 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight if only he'd "confessed with his mouth" he wouldn't be dead. Presumably a written confession is unacceptable?
832530043758841856 2017-02-17 10:00:04 UTC <Patwainwright> @htcvive @seanboyxx @wolfandwood thanks a lot for the reply, best of luck with the new release and I look forward to whatever you do next.
832332215954657280 2017-02-16 20:53:58 UTC <Patwainwright> @wolfandwood looks fantastic, any plans for an @htcvive version? A chair in a room is still the best vr horror experience out there.
831601822989172738 2017-02-14 20:31:39 UTC <Patwainwright> Just in case you were not aware, or had forgotten, MGS: Peace Walker featured a character named Hot Coldman. Thanks.
827978823958482944 2017-02-04 20:35:09 UTC <Patwainwright> @Patwainwright honestly didn't think Capcom had it in them after 6, but that was a heck of a return to form.
827975482499014656 2017-02-04 20:21:52 UTC <Patwainwright> Just finished yer RE7. Loved it. Someone should probably go tell Aunt Rhody.
826361288188166144 2017-01-31 09:27:38 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman happy times indeed my friend!
825425682666762240 2017-01-28 19:29:53 UTC <Patwainwright> Exploring the house in RE7 really is an absolute joy. Feels like being back in the Spencer mansion but new and unique at the same time.
825068401953533954 2017-01-27 19:50:10 UTC <Patwainwright> Favorite thing about RE7 so far? Putting crests in doors again. Bloody love that.
824946096526995456 2017-01-27 11:44:10 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir mate, the sonic back catalogue has got some outrageous shit on it. Check out the soundtrack to the first Sonic Adventure...
819812956993044480 2017-01-12 07:46:54 UTC <Patwainwright> @gildenlow_eng @Road_Salt @mrmatthickman tasty! I'll have to get right on that.
818550529458634752 2017-01-09 20:10:28 UTC <Patwainwright> Oh man, Scalebound cancelled and Kamiya taking time off for mental health issues. Very very sad.
818091016746135555 2017-01-08 13:44:32 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight indeed. I read one piece with about 20 plausible interpretations! Let me know what you think went down.
818083256713277440 2017-01-08 13:13:42 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight messed up isn't it?
817842549679394816 2017-01-07 21:17:13 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight maaaaan, the last 10 minutes of that game sure is a thing...
815125951923294209 2016-12-31 09:22:25 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight great choice mate, some beautiful Olly Moss art to boot. Did you like it?
815124488853553152 2016-12-31 09:16:37 UTC <Patwainwright> @roundonefight what did you play?
806819027385511936 2016-12-08 11:13:40 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail @GavWeir its weird, I found that fight pretty easy. Ludwig totally destroyed me time and again though.
806818437574098948 2016-12-08 11:11:20 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail @GavWeir "you were at my side all along...". I think Lady Maria is my fave BB boss though. Work of art, that fight.
805433057083850752 2016-12-04 15:26:19 UTC <Patwainwright> @JonVonHero best of luck chief. I advise against turning up naked.
805099895212359680 2016-12-03 17:22:27 UTC <Patwainwright> Do you remember when they were sinking cities with a giant worm? I liked it when they were sinking cities with a giant worm.
800013026682281985 2016-11-19 16:29:03 UTC <Patwainwright> @NGMoreton @louistwois the Infosec crowd have basically been embarrassing themselves for years. Nothing to worry about lads.
799983590306037760 2016-11-19 14:32:05 UTC <Patwainwright> @SkyBet @NGMoreton turns out its actually fine because that guy said. Phew!
796437275697676289 2016-11-09 19:40:18 UTC <Patwainwright> Hey remember when the leader of the free world told us all to check out Miss America's fake sex tape? On balance 2016 had been a weird year.
794462654593138688 2016-11-04 08:53:51 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir it sounded like a real bad time for all involved.
794462162567786496 2016-11-04 08:51:54 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir I still haven't got over Albert Fish to be honest with you...
793143566805692417 2016-10-31 17:32:16 UTC <Patwainwright> Brilliant, @SouthernRailUK finally reinstated my trains today. Hmm, morning train cancelled, evening train hideously delayed. Progress!
791710457308536833 2016-10-27 18:37:36 UTC <Patwainwright> @jozborne lovely stuff!
790498951342481408 2016-10-24 10:23:31 UTC <Patwainwright> @LewieP hi Lewie, I'll happily take zombie training simulator off your hands if it's still going!
789029629013135361 2016-10-20 09:04:57 UTC <Patwainwright> @louismrose potentially relevant if one of them was Lady Penelope.
788281326000607232 2016-10-18 07:31:28 UTC <Patwainwright> That was another miserable morning brought to you by the fine folks at @SouthernRailUK !
783737855092879360 2016-10-05 18:37:20 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail I had a job once where I was shredding novelty cheques for 8 hours a day. Stress-free but honestly still hard to recommend.
781220448013017088 2016-09-28 19:54:03 UTC <Patwainwright> Hey, remember when I beat Ludwig solo on new game plus? NO YOU DON'T BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T THERE.
780497239215075328 2016-09-26 20:00:17 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman I like to think I've had a profound impact on many aspects of your life, music being just one.
775102228298432512 2016-09-11 22:42:26 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois well, let's just say it "threw the towel in". Maybe that pun works?
774947757035556864 2016-09-11 12:28:37 UTC <Patwainwright> @louistwois I'll be honest, in a straight up battle with the bath, I totally won. It's now in several pieces at the local tip.
774611096703528961 2016-09-10 14:10:51 UTC <Patwainwright> Me? Oh, I'm just smashing up this bathtub with an axe like some kind of madman. I don't give a fuck mate.pic.twitter.com/o4N92svuX8
772892853601243136 2016-09-05 20:23:10 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail can't be as bad as the one a while back with the 911 calls. Man alive...
771438479188295680 2016-09-01 20:04:00 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail I'm running at them now with my trousers down.
771430197619032064 2016-09-01 19:31:06 UTC <Patwainwright> I case anyone was wondering, Resident Evil 4 continues to be one of the greatest things ever. Thanks.
769941492236443648 2016-08-28 16:55:31 UTC <Patwainwright> Kids love virtual reality, it turns out.pic.twitter.com/iI3Cho3NGr
764563191665946624 2016-08-13 20:44:04 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir it's long been an ambition of mine to try one. I just need to know.
764560771711954944 2016-08-13 20:34:27 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir what... what was it like?
764556596076773376 2016-08-13 20:17:51 UTC <Patwainwright> Never trust someone who openly dislikes Event Horizon. They are probably plotting your demise.
764461403826745348 2016-08-13 13:59:36 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail most of my planets are named Shatner's Basoon. Look out for 'em.
761994449933201413 2016-08-06 18:36:48 UTC <Patwainwright> Finally getting back to the witcher to do the DLC. Some nice UI upgrades here. I bloody love a good UI upgrade.
761682799317385216 2016-08-05 21:58:25 UTC <Patwainwright> @TightToTheNail @GavWeir you dont need to play through the repeat ones to advance the story.Make sure you do the new missions, theyre great!
761594605066412032 2016-08-05 16:07:58 UTC <Patwainwright> Doesn't really matter if @SouthernRailUK strike or not, appalling level of service regardless. Astonishing that they retain the franchise.
761594228715773954 2016-08-05 16:06:28 UTC <Patwainwright> Despite a hugely reduced service, @SouthernRailUK still incapable of running a competent service from Southampton to Brighton. Ridiculous.
761553741082427392 2016-08-05 13:25:35 UTC <Patwainwright> @jozborne @samdimmer Darwinian selection perhaps?
760548088289320961 2016-08-02 18:49:29 UTC <Patwainwright> @jozborne safety warnings to the Pokemon? In case Bulbosaur wanders onto the track probably.
759860051850911745 2016-07-31 21:15:28 UTC <Patwainwright> The Stranger Things intro makes me want to play Hotline Miami. You know, more than my baseline desire to play Hotline Miami.
759679865872379904 2016-07-31 09:19:28 UTC <Patwainwright> @mrmatthickman I watched the 1st 2 eps last night, great stuff. So what are you up to these days? Nothing too derogatory I hope.
759493974725894149 2016-07-30 21:00:48 UTC <Patwainwright> Good god, the soundtrack to Stranger Things is pretty incredible isn't it?
758408621768269825 2016-07-27 21:08:00 UTC <Patwainwright> I actually think the last boss from Metal Gear Rising would do pretty well in the US presidential election were he to stand.
754575510424944641 2016-07-17 07:16:35 UTC <Patwainwright> Great night out last night. Well, I say night out, it was more me sat on my own playing video games and eating a chocolate orange.

709047717830459392 2016-03-13 16:05:24 UTC <Patwainwright> @GavWeir that game was amazing. Am I right in thinking that at some stage a glowing skull rolled down some stairs? That's all I remember...
