842460831145201664 2017-03-16 19:41:28 UTC <Hardshell213> @halrudnick That's why you need to Google this stuff before you see it.
841661051368275969 2017-03-14 14:43:26 UTC <Hardshell213> @UrsinusCollege How about you stop risking people's safety?
841096383520206848 2017-03-12 01:19:39 UTC <Hardshell213> @PhillyD If you weren't eaten or beaten, then you weren't in Florida.

839980689063837696 2017-03-09 23:26:17 UTC <Hardshell213> @dickfundy Now if only they would shut down obvious troll accounts.
837742361413365761 2017-03-03 19:11:58 UTC <Hardshell213> @dickfundy I love how he's going after random YouTube stars he's never heard of until now.
837684644694863875 2017-03-03 15:22:37 UTC <Hardshell213> @dickfundy Is that counting the Deadpool movie or...?

836354868591874048 2017-02-27 23:18:34 UTC <Hardshell213> @jroberts332 How many pancakes would it take to get you to kill off Tailgate? Asking for a friend.

831655377175457792 2017-02-14 00:04:27 UTC <Hardshell213> @dickfundy You sure he's prez? He hasn't been acting like one so far...
830846139784118272 2017-02-12 18:28:50 UTC <Hardshell213> @pablohidalgo The guy in charge of Star Wars canon is also a Transformers fan. My day is now perfect.
829839509894332418 2017-02-09 23:48:51 UTC <Hardshell213> It's something they invented for the weak.
829837072684953602 2017-02-09 23:39:10 UTC <Hardshell213> How fucking disgusting.https://twitter.com/AltStateDpt/status/829824222113492992
829709157112676352 2017-02-09 15:10:52 UTC <Hardshell213> @seibertroncom It looks so much better than what we actually got.
829482625605726208 2017-02-08 00:10:43 UTC <Hardshell213> I saw Jim Jones was trending on FB and immediately assumed it was about Jonestown. Turns out it was a rapper.
829337894515044353 2017-02-08 14:35:37 UTC <Hardshell213> @jroberts332 LL no.2 was good. Any idea on a street date for no.3?

827581019951943680 2017-02-03 18:14:25 UTC <Hardshell213> @jroberts332 Show him MTMTE memes to put him in his place.

827493385468522497 2017-02-03 12:26:11 UTC <Hardshell213> @dril @jroberts332 Why aren't you writing this?
