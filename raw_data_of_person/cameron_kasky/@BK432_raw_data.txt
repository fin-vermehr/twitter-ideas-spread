971493080477159426 2018-03-07 21:09:34 UTC <BK432> I feel horrible for De Leon, who will now have presumably 2 lost seasons upcoming and will almost certainly be a bullpen guy in any MLB time going forward.  But have to say, told you so to all those who wanted to trade Dozier for him straight up.https://twitter.com/TBTimes_Rays/status/971491692305178624
971440203339653121 2018-03-07 17:39:27 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert it's all good - kids recover quickly. The only rain of the vacation was this morning anyway.
971416091363872770 2018-03-07 16:03:38 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert little bout of stomach flu. First time ever for him, actually. Threw up 6 times last night and once this morning but seems to be turning the corner! Today turned into a relaxation day at the house! :)
971404340211650561 2018-03-07 15:16:57 UTC <BK432> No better place to have a pukey kid than in your rental house poolside with a sweet, dewey cross-breeze coming through the house.
971234108092403713 2018-03-06 04:00:30 UTC <BK432> We don't know the end of Joe's story yet, but as of now....  Joe was the better player (by just a bit) Kirby was the more memorable player (by a lot, actually)  Not sure it has to get any more complex than that.
970868681227071493 2018-03-05 03:48:26 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 right! He seems like he's looking for a compliment or something. Good luck.
970867533996797954 2018-03-05 03:43:52 UTC <BK432> I don't give two shits about either of these two people but why is this guy still hanging out there? Does he think this is helping?
970857878713262085 2018-03-05 03:05:30 UTC <BK432> @PJHughes45 stay with it. Insider info. Watch all the way till 11.
970848793422974976 2018-03-05 02:29:24 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert just trying to live it up Seth style!
970835932701188097 2018-03-05 01:38:18 UTC <BK432> I'm sitting on the lanai with a glass of wine, next to the pool of my home for the week. Sun set a while ago but it's still near 70 here on Marco Island. I have a bit of FOMO with the snowstorm back home, but damn, this is awesome.
970496942676631553 2018-03-04 03:11:16 UTC <BK432> This world is pretty sweet. Heading out on vacation tomorrow, found someone on @Nextdoor to snowblow my driveway for $25.  Take that, 1980s.
970456588212490240 2018-03-04 00:30:55 UTC <BK432> Of course Hudson won.  #TwinCitiesSuburbhttps://twitter.com/wiaawistate/status/970069315507679232

970357023773790209 2018-03-04 17:55:17 UTC <BK432> So @LauraBetker, not to be selfish, but my flight takes off for SW Florida at 7:15 tomorrow morning. Snow won't delay us, correct? #PleaseSayNo
970349795662581761 2018-03-04 17:26:34 UTC <BK432> Other people's preferences and opinions aren't wrong.  Except this. This is wrong.https://twitter.com/munchies/status/970335591626936320

970092413992751104 2018-03-03 00:23:49 UTC <BK432> I have very few in-person outlets for serious fantasy baseball and analytics talk. For that, I really appreciate afternoons like today with @w0rstbeat and @JimMelichar7. Great chat and beers.
969998262274011136 2018-03-03 18:09:42 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid nothing bothers me more than quote marks used in this way. It reminds me of my aunt or something. I dont even understand why theyd be used like this.
969720157143740416 2018-03-02 23:44:36 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar has to be right up there. Some fun memories (and some not so fun too)
969413026976804869 2018-03-01 03:24:11 UTC <BK432> This is fascinating on a couple different levels, obviously. Makes me think @tangotiger could offer him a job post-retirement.https://twitter.com/JustinVerlander/status/969390004769316864

969008020503121920 2018-02-28 00:34:50 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 I like to overanalyze my own trades and I tweet to get feedback. Usually no one cares, which is understandable.
968864779707314178 2018-02-28 15:05:38 UTC <BK432> 1 for 1 trade. Interleague (my league is actually two leagues, AL-only and NL-only)  Scooter Gennett ($4) for Mitch Haniger ($8). Pretty fair, actually. I had to clear Haniger off my roster to make room for SB, ang Gennett is a good get in return.
968657307876954112 2018-02-27 01:21:13 UTC <BK432> Ladies and gentlemen......we're on the precipice of a deal. Awaiting acceptance.  #RotoLife

968153326318706694 2018-02-26 15:58:35 UTC <BK432> Hey @Lkummer we just saw this in Golden Valley and now Crystal is hopping on board.https://twitter.com/citypages/status/967768055232200704
967944470401400832 2018-02-25 02:08:39 UTC <BK432> #MNTwins are making big boy moves that the other teams all used to make and I'd get so jealous.  This is fun. It really is.
967941622548828160 2018-02-25 01:57:20 UTC <BK432> I do believe that #MNTwins will sign another SP once they're able to do just 3 years.  Cobb might have to settle for something like 3-39. Here's to hoping the Twins pounce on it.
967887441716699136 2018-02-25 22:22:03 UTC <BK432> @JimMelichar7 best signing and they made the best trade, for Odo :)
967883515563069440 2018-02-25 22:06:27 UTC <BK432> If he makes 600 PA we should be happy to pay $10M for 2019https://twitter.com/LaVelleNeal/status/967877582346686466

967851056397987841 2018-02-25 19:57:28 UTC <BK432> Had a nice 4 feet or so of cul-de-sac snow piled in front of my driveway this morning. Can't believe I didn't die of a heart attack.  Next time I hear the plow after snow, I might venture out to have a few words.
967846361419993090 2018-02-25 19:38:48 UTC <BK432> @HerringLegal @gvgillian @RepFreiberg and I know two of you!

965616732588175360 2018-02-19 15:59:03 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer we tend to forget some of the small bullpen moves, but that 'pen looks markedly improved over what we started with last year.
965615867693338624 2018-02-19 15:55:37 UTC <BK432> Nice analysis on a local guy (but not necessarily a Twins fan).  Can't help but wonder what his thoughts are on them adding Odorizzi? :) @JimMelichar7https://twitter.com/JimMelichar7/status/965615479061696512
965599906281992197 2018-02-19 14:52:12 UTC <BK432> @Ex_Twins_News right on. I'm no huge Souhan fan or anything, but I read that column last summer 4 or 5 times, trying to find what I was missing. I was left scratching my head over the mass hysteria.

965075365155786752 2018-02-17 04:07:51 UTC <BK432> This is a fair statement. I hope it works out.https://twitter.com/MNfanfromafar/status/965074013105029120
965067964385984512 2018-02-17 03:38:27 UTC <BK432> Short track speedskating is the best Winter Olympic sport. If you think otherwise, you're dead to me.
965059238472151040 2018-02-17 03:03:47 UTC <BK432> Whoa. This feels awfully light. Odorizzi is controllable through '19. Gotten for a potential future utility player.https://twitter.com/Feinsand/status/965058797671714816
965058797248106497 2018-02-17 03:02:01 UTC <BK432> Finally - I am now excited. Odorizzi is a nice consolation prize and shouldn't cost the Twins tons. I assume it's more than Palacios but it won't be a huge haul.
965040663086673922 2018-02-17 01:49:58 UTC <BK432> Wait, what? Seriously? That seems crazy. Has to be some sort of trade coming.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/965040122734563329

965034872132788224 2018-02-17 01:26:57 UTC <BK432> @w0rstbeat 2 years ago I remember Anibal dominated the Twins his first start out (Twins would go on to lose 103, so go figure). He just awful after that and ever since. I doubt he'll make the Twins out of Spring Training.
964907239306924032 2018-02-17 16:59:47 UTC <BK432> Seems like Falvine were less than enamored with any of the other top SP names besides Darvish. Looks like plan B is cheap flyers and developing the youngsters.  I'm not sure I disagree with them but I'm still a bit disappointed.
964702276333031424 2018-02-16 03:25:20 UTC <BK432> Holy crap. I know next to nothing about HS wrestling but I know this is massive. Apple Valley has made state every year since I was 2 years old.https://twitter.com/ChrisLongKSTP/status/964701773490458624

963965459015065600 2018-02-14 02:37:29 UTC <BK432> @BK432 I wont mince words: if this killing machine (AR-15) is that important to you, then screw you. You have no decency.
963964964032712704 2018-02-14 02:35:31 UTC <BK432> It is truly amazing how, when the blood isnt even dried yet, some race to Twitter to start defending ownership of weapons of mass destruction like the AR 15. I guess we know whats more important to them than the lives of 17 teenagers shot dead in their school.

962875645641613313 2018-02-11 02:26:57 UTC <BK432> @w0rstbeat Have you seen the reports of Miller Park having some exit velocity overstatements in '16?  That's what I blame. Keon is dead to me.
962874385999843329 2018-02-11 02:21:57 UTC <BK432> @w0rstbeat Kepler would be included I believe. Depends who the like more. Santana is fine but Kepler with 5 years of team control is probably the prize.

962144016627269634 2018-02-09 01:59:43 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets @twikipedium very true, considering they built this stadium literally only for the opening and closing ceremonies, I believe.
962143059071860736 2018-02-09 01:55:55 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets @twikipedium really? So are citizens not allowed to watch inside the stadium??

961718282352058368 2018-02-08 21:48:01 UTC <BK432> @BaseballATeam @JimMelichar7 @w0rstbeat Ha, yes, that is pretty good. Though the correct parallel would be something closer to getting drunk the night keepers are due and deciding "ah screw it, I'm keeping Price and his expensive salary, I'm sure his elbow will be FINE
961665028419092480 2018-02-08 18:16:24 UTC <BK432> Nice recap of a fantastic article by @BaseballATeam on Luis Castillo and probabilistic thinking, which is hard for most humans.  https://www.fangraphs.com/fantasy/some-kind-of-headline-about-not-being-stupid/ #RotoBaseballTweetpic.twitter.com/sGma5aWbwO
961447664125607936 2018-02-07 03:52:40 UTC <BK432> @BaseballByTom @SheaMcGinnity yep. Let's overpay by a bit. It might suck in 2023. I promise not to bash them over the head with this at the end of the contract.  Let's just take a shot.

961443684897230853 2018-02-07 03:36:51 UTC <BK432> Wiggins had no chance there. He can't guard LBJ one-on-one.
961440655250743296 2018-02-07 03:24:49 UTC <BK432> Honestly, it was Lebron, but you'll take that possession and shot from the Cavs every time.
961087101348573184 2018-02-06 03:59:55 UTC <BK432> Wow does this ever suck. UGH!!!!https://twitter.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/961086441508962310

960001524494675968 2018-02-03 04:06:14 UTC <BK432> The lesson: Wolves play well at home when there are plenty of passive, semi-interested high-rollers from out of town in Target Center.

959988498978824192 2018-02-03 03:14:28 UTC <BK432> This is great. Moss was the best I've ever seen at WR. Transcendent is the perfect word to describe him.https://twitter.com/espn/status/959975017760030725
959987593248165888 2018-02-03 03:10:52 UTC <BK432> This is why, in contract negotiations and labor disputes, I'm almost always 100% pro-player. Get as much $ and bargaining rights as you can, when you can.  Because the alternative is scumbags like Loria keeping it all.https://deadspin.com/report-jeffrey-loria-takes-one-last-dump-on-miami-1822662664

959576653218435072 2018-02-02 23:57:56 UTC <BK432> @JimMelichar7 I have such good memories of that storm as a 12 year old

959225246510473216 2018-02-01 00:41:34 UTC <BK432> @J_D_Cameron that's pretty surprising. I want more, but it hasn't been a bad offseason at all.
959057730437812224 2018-02-01 13:35:56 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 we all did! But in the end, he was merely a 4th/5th outfielder

958732390628823040 2018-01-31 16:03:08 UTC <BK432> So wait, @enosarris is done at @fangraphs too? Lots of changes....which is fine. I'll miss Eno's work but people should chase dreams.
958727888488026112 2018-01-31 15:45:15 UTC <BK432> It makes me feel weirdly positive and happy that my son's principal starting next year has nearly 22,000 Twitter followers.
958536869272223744 2018-01-30 03:06:13 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood that's what I decided as well. I watched the recording for 2 minutes and had no appetite for it.
958533914741673985 2018-01-30 02:54:28 UTC <BK432> Parise. Walk-off.
958518808779612160 2018-01-30 01:54:27 UTC <BK432> I literally just realized that Trump's SOTU is tonight. Had no idea until now. Will set the DVR and watch I guess. Not sure why.

958203229145391117 2018-01-29 05:00:27 UTC <BK432> So, I have a fantasy golf team. I don't actually watch golf. Like, ever.  It's early in the season. But my team is 3-0 & has the most points in the league.  I literally have no idea about who's good. I get a cheat sheet online and draft. Shows you how much skill l is needed.
958197241000419329 2018-01-29 04:36:39 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer Media Day was at Xcel. Radio Row is at MOA.
958196733628092416 2018-01-29 04:34:38 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer this is an odd take though. Radio Row is at MOA, nothing else is. Perhaps he needs to get out of his bubble. Plenty going on downtown.
958184382006743040 2018-01-29 03:45:33 UTC <BK432> Well, yeah....https://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/958184295394312193

957703181819052038 2018-01-28 19:53:26 UTC <BK432> This story is pretty crazy. The mayor of Blue Earth doesn't want the story covered? What a bizarre stance by a community leader. This should be covered and the consequences to the perpetrators should be compelling.https://twitter.com/StarTribune/status/957614489440063488
957700651693281286 2018-01-28 19:43:23 UTC <BK432> This will earn some hate I'm sure, but I'm rooting for the Pats next week.  Not because of rude Eagles fans.  Because I would have anyway. I'm aroused by excellence. Pats are the most consistently excellent organization in sports.
957438352952889344 2018-01-27 02:21:06 UTC <BK432> It's January 27 and outside of FAs who haven't signed, I actually feel nearly ready to auction in every roto league I'm in.  #PreparationIsKey

Linking to some godawful study that even someone like me can read and know it's shit. And now people hate me.
957075294346719232 2018-01-26 02:18:26 UTC <BK432> I can't comprehend why it's this difficult to stop. People with power need to stand up for those with little of it.https://twitter.com/NicoleAuerbach/status/957056460327964673

955642498411565056 2018-01-22 03:25:01 UTC <BK432> Snow's done in west Plymouth. Crazy storm and we were spared the worst. Maybe 8 inches. For once we finally got an overperforming storm.

955250970505744385 2018-01-21 01:29:13 UTC <BK432> If we run into injury issues, maybe the Eagles will trade us Carson Wentz. Foles is an MVP candidate next season.

955188257779802114 2018-01-21 21:20:01 UTC <BK432> Well, I know we all want the Jags to win, but you can't just push a guy out of bounds on his way to catch a pass.
955187926996054016 2018-01-21 21:18:42 UTC <BK432> That should be a flag and an ejection. Awful hit.

954786403052867585 2018-01-20 18:43:12 UTC <BK432> @JimMelichar7 let me ask you this one....changing gears.  How much worse is Cutchs outlook in San Fran? How much relative value does he lose?
954741408048603137 2018-01-20 15:44:24 UTC <BK432> Woo hoo!!!!!https://twitter.com/pdouglasweather/status/954737165463965697

954707524963487744 2018-01-20 13:29:46 UTC <BK432> My guy: Manny Margot. Nice analysis on his launch angle gains last year from @enosarris on @fangraphshttps://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/manny-margot-and-the-stickiness-of-a-launch-angle-breakout/

952943287563882496 2018-01-15 16:39:19 UTC <BK432> Got a little lost last night, but the Wolves won again last night. 29-16, 1/2 game out of the 3 seed. They are ROLLING right now.
952936721804611585 2018-01-15 16:13:13 UTC <BK432> Just noticed Engelb Vielma was DFA'd again yesterday. 3rd time in like 4 or 5 months, this time by Pittsburgh.

952754414833623041 2018-01-14 04:08:48 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @patmayo exactly. There would be some lost hospitatility $. I'm personally okay with that.
952753688287858688 2018-01-14 04:05:55 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @patmayo that has been discussed at length. Probably the worst SB revenue was still-alive. Jaguars v Vikings.

952733153952718853 2018-01-14 02:44:19 UTC <BK432> I hyperventilated and I teared up. Not sure how to explain it; I had detached myself from this team years ago. At least I thought I did.  #SKOL

952679904054833158 2018-01-14 23:12:43 UTC <BK432> 15 minute reprieve from the headache-inducing noise for the Saints.  Don't worry, it'll be back.
952678728286527488 2018-01-14 23:08:03 UTC <BK432> Let's tack on 3 more boys
952676241320136704 2018-01-14 22:58:10 UTC <BK432> Buck/Aikman keep trying to suggest ref misses benefitting Vikes.  Maybe. I don't know.  I do know that Vikings fans don't care. #BountyGateRevenge
952674505817772032 2018-01-14 22:51:16 UTC <BK432> D is playing great. Go for it.
952674183825252352 2018-01-14 22:49:59 UTC <BK432> If the Vikes can put at least some sort of drive together here, the Saints may have to pack up the run for the afternoon.
952673181051088897 2018-01-14 22:46:00 UTC <BK432> Horse collar should tack on 15. HUGE!!!!!
952670525175803904 2018-01-14 22:35:27 UTC <BK432> TD Latavius!!!
952669540554625025 2018-01-14 22:31:32 UTC <BK432> My heart went up in my throat. Whoa.
952661669049786368 2018-01-14 22:00:16 UTC <BK432> One Bama tweet, then I go back purple:  Daboll was at times great, and at times infuriating. I ended up feeling they won it all despite some shortcomings in playcalling. Best of luck to the Bills and Daboll.https://twitter.com/CBSSportsCFB/status/952661127221141505
952661156442918912 2018-01-14 21:58:13 UTC <BK432> But I'll say this - those who didn't watch much Vikings the second half of the season probably don't realize who actually really good this team is. Hopefully they continue to execute.
952659811971354624 2018-01-14 21:52:53 UTC <BK432> Let's everyone remember that there are 55 minutes left in the game. Tennessee scored first last night.
952658945449095169 2018-01-14 21:49:26 UTC <BK432> That's a great, great start. #SKOL
952649458562617346 2018-01-14 21:11:44 UTC <BK432> FWIW, it's a small thing, but I like letting the 2 minute warning happen after 1st down there. Takes the pass option mostly out of play on 2nd and 3rd downs.
952645414251048962 2018-01-14 20:55:40 UTC <BK432> The Steelers' defense......leaves something to be desired. You can't give up 35 to Bortles (and allow a scoop & score to boot). Yikes.
952632232291729408 2018-01-14 20:03:17 UTC <BK432> Just caught this highlight from the 1st half. Couldn't agree more.https://twitter.com/DanBarreiroKFAN/status/952631082641510403
952629770906406912 2018-01-14 19:53:31 UTC <BK432> Give Le'veon an Oscar for that one.
952629461656178693 2018-01-14 19:52:17 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls ha - nice cute shovel pass for 2 yards and a first down there
952398365957992448 2018-01-13 04:33:59 UTC <BK432> This. Totally. There is so much anti-Patriots obsession out there. It's insane.https://twitter.com/greentroit/status/952397931725893632
952390402883117057 2018-01-13 04:02:21 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets @Brandon_Warne So we're trading Conforto ABs for Bruce ABs and Gonzalez ABs I guess....like I said, I don't get it.
952389963412332544 2018-01-13 04:00:36 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne @SethTweets Pretty sure Bruce is going to play a corner OF, which if that wasn't bad enough, means Conforto plays CF. I don't get it at all.
952367520811569153 2018-01-13 02:31:25 UTC <BK432> Oh my god this is so goodhttps://twitter.com/JasonMan811/status/952297726045249541
952348775099633664 2018-01-13 01:16:56 UTC <BK432> @cinatyte ya nailed it - now we just have to win tomorrow....
952320762098089987 2018-01-13 23:25:37 UTC <BK432> Thats it? Thats all they had to trade?https://twitter.com/TBrownYahoo/status/952318954160050177
952299992861106176 2018-01-13 22:03:05 UTC <BK432> @cinatyte you may be right. I might be leaning that way
952298615644606465 2018-01-13 21:57:37 UTC <BK432> I dont even know who Im rooting for. Philly looks slow and not too good at QB, but Falcons give us the home game.
952298273792057344 2018-01-13 21:56:15 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt I completely agree.
952291810222669825 2018-01-13 21:30:34 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt I would hope they don't care about losing him altogether. I fear they probably have enough invested, however, that they want to keep him on the 40 in case he ends up being able to provide some value.
952291469121019905 2018-01-13 21:29:13 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt I believe he can, yes. But we can DFA and get him off the 40 if we're willing to eat the money.
952289311625539584 2018-01-13 21:20:39 UTC <BK432> So coming off the 40 is probably Boshers, right? But wouldn't it be great if they decided to pull the plug on Hughes?
952288034296299522 2018-01-13 21:15:34 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan @fran_the_man   It probably doesn't matter, I suppose. Reed can pitch in more meaningful spots if they approach this correctly.https://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/952287603277156352
952286163666075648 2018-01-13 21:08:08 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan @fran_the_man and frankly, I'd simply prefer they just have the best arms in the pen that they can and not worry about defining a closer role.....but I've resigned myself to the idea that baseball isn't there yet.
952282154905559041 2018-01-13 20:52:12 UTC <BK432> @NoDakTwinsFan Ha - OMG. Totally. Whoops!
952282076623048704 2018-01-13 20:51:54 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan I've really enjoyed Reed the last 2 years. Cut his walk rate and increased his K rate. Doesn't overpower but pounds the strike zone with pitches that are touch to hit.
952281775539130370 2018-01-13 20:50:42 UTC <BK432> I should have tweeted this out when I read the article yesterday. This is an awesome article on baserunning measured by BsR and sprint speed. Twins rank well. Highly recommend you take 5 minutes and reed.https://twitter.com/NoDakTwinsFan/status/952281262772883456
952280890033496065 2018-01-13 20:47:11 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan I hope our guys don't always keep promises. Reed is far and away the better pitcher.
952280249424908288 2018-01-13 20:44:38 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan I suppose you can view him that way. But I don't think he's the backup option. He is the closer. Rodney is simply a wild card.
952279677896417280 2018-01-13 20:42:22 UTC <BK432> Reed and Neshek have been very similar results-wise over the last 2 years. Got identical contracts, essentially.  But Reed is 29. Neshek is 37. Again, great signing.
952276466854694912 2018-01-13 20:29:36 UTC <BK432> I've been an Addison Reed fan for a few years, enjoying his underrated services in one of my fantasy leagues.  Excellent K-BB%, 16th best of all relievers last two seasons. 2/17 is a great buy.
952211874669580290 2018-01-13 16:12:56 UTC <BK432> Brad Hand is every bit as good as, say, Andrew Miller and yet hes a virtual unknown. Not sure how Padres compete in the near-term so he may finish this deal elsewhere.https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/952210624695562242
952210060222042112 2018-01-13 16:05:44 UTC <BK432> Great idea.  Take a knee: working at Runners Edge.

951959652006326272 2018-01-12 23:30:42 UTC <BK432> And this. Can you imagine what your life is like to have this sort of reaction to a fun, alternate reality piece as we approach the next Vikings playoff game?

950598989874950144 2018-01-08 05:23:55 UTC <BK432> I told many of my friends that Alabama did not have a championship caliber team this season.  After the Clemson win, I changed my tune. They got REAL good at the end. Crazy.
950595628001882113 2018-01-08 05:10:33 UTC <BK432> HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!
950593273520967680 2018-01-08 05:01:12 UTC <BK432> Really glad an internet cam wasn't on me during that kick.

950587677270822912 2018-01-08 04:38:57 UTC <BK432> Huge. First down!
950585274345623552 2018-01-08 04:29:25 UTC <BK432> We've looked overall crappy - but it's a one score game. Much better with Tua. #RollDamnTide
950582825635414016 2018-01-08 04:19:41 UTC <BK432> Did you see that block by Juedy?
950578798092746752 2018-01-08 04:03:41 UTC <BK432> That is a hell of a lot of balls for being up 10. Nearly blocked.
950576171477098497 2018-01-08 03:53:14 UTC <BK432> Now, THAT'S a big play. We were on the brink. And we're still alive.

950572025701167104 2018-01-08 03:36:46 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 don't get me wrong. They need to make the right calls. The face mask was a blatant miss.
950571732963856384 2018-01-08 03:35:36 UTC <BK432> That drive. My goodness.
950570504691376129 2018-01-08 03:30:43 UTC <BK432> Huge surprise herehttps://twitter.com/Newsweek/status/950570399284322305
950570375011819520 2018-01-08 03:30:12 UTC <BK432> It pretty much does. Crummy product for the national championship so far. https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben/status/950570280266682368
950570251665707008 2018-01-08 03:29:43 UTC <BK432> @lakeshow73 I'll give you that one :)
950570046300016641 2018-01-08 03:28:54 UTC <BK432> They have no vested interest in the result. They missed a call. They're professionals, but they're also human.https://twitter.com/NathanSchultz79/status/950569792930570240
950568700918337536 2018-01-08 03:23:33 UTC <BK432> But even if this is true, it's dead ball, no blocked punthttps://twitter.com/lakeshow73/status/950568608828198912
950567788745314304 2018-01-08 03:19:56 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert Despite the first drive result, I believe it's the right decision.

950565642687668224 2018-01-08 03:11:24 UTC <BK432> UGA is absolutely destroying Bama. Unless something changes, this won't be a close game down the stretch.
950557898572206080 2018-01-08 02:40:38 UTC <BK432> Honest to god, outside of two runs, Hurts looks awful. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing some Tua in the second half.
950556943831232517 2018-01-08 02:36:50 UTC <BK432> The front 7 of the Tide look great against the run, but we've rarely pressured Fromm. Lucky to get off the field here.
950548661716467712 2018-01-08 02:03:55 UTC <BK432> Caught the last minute. Wow. Jimmy ends it with STYLE!https://twitter.com/chipscoggins/status/950548499174711297
950547597772587013 2018-01-08 01:59:42 UTC <BK432> OK quick during the first quarter break, give my boy @JimMelichar7  a follow. He's got the best analytical baseball mind of people I personally know and he's breaking out on the scene.
950539805041020936 2018-01-08 01:28:44 UTC <BK432> Ridley slowed briefly. Not sure that's all on Hurts TBH
950539416778534914 2018-01-08 01:27:11 UTC <BK432> Great, great cut by Jalen. Wow.

949857758408593408 2018-01-06 04:18:31 UTC <BK432> @dynastyguru @JimMelichar7 I'll look for your post on his offensive potential. I've heard it before. He hasn't been special yet. Maybe it's still coming.  Even still, his limitations defensively will limit his fantasy value.
949857364970295296 2018-01-06 04:16:57 UTC <BK432> Nope. Incomplete pass.
949854557672271873 2018-01-06 04:05:48 UTC <BK432> Fantasy Owners: Oh, NOW Julio can get 100 and a TD. Funny....
949848885203259392 2018-01-06 03:43:16 UTC <BK432> Matt Bryant has never missed an important FG. Ever.
949827796775432192 2018-01-06 02:19:28 UTC <BK432> Jared Goff looks completely out of sorts.
949826304052027396 2018-01-06 02:13:32 UTC <BK432> @dynastyguru @JimMelichar7 I can't believe that dude is still only 25 and has over 2300 PA and less than 3 fWAR in his career.  He keeps getting chances, so there must be SOMETHING the Tigers see.
949825181308080128 2018-01-06 02:09:04 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man I thought so through 5....Rams' mistakes are killing them.
949823707492552704 2018-01-06 02:03:13 UTC <BK432> Didn't really expect the Rams to struggle in this game. Blunders are allowing Falcons to take control early. Perhaps the Vikings true scout game is tomorrow.

948584944623865856 2018-01-03 16:00:49 UTC <BK432> If MLB teams are just holding their money for the 2018-2019 FA class, it will be interesting to see if/how many guys take 1 year pillow contracts this year.  I think it's more likely the later into 2018 we get.
948360414299086848 2018-01-02 01:08:37 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood your problem is using the sprinkle function. You are much better off just going with the dump and pour part of the spigot

948061060304703488 2018-01-01 05:19:05 UTC <BK432> Ball game. Wow. I'm actually kind of surprised.
948058434590658561 2018-01-01 05:08:39 UTC <BK432> I know Clemson is trying not to go all-pass, but you're down 18 with under 3 to go.....
948053539917647872 2018-01-01 04:49:12 UTC <BK432> Of course, things began on the upswing in 2007 with Saban starting. I've never had better timing on anything in my entire life. It's been a hell of a last 12 years with the greatest college football program in history.
948053197062594565 2018-01-01 04:47:50 UTC <BK432> Despite the 2006 season being so dreadful, that is the year I caught the bug. Being on campus so much, I couldn't help but fall in love. I was a fan of no college team, and I could pour my energy into this one community that was passionate unlike anything I've ever seen.
948052945190387712 2018-01-01 04:46:50 UTC <BK432> As the 2006 season began I continued to spend two weeks a month in Alabama. It also happened to be Mike Shula's last season as coach in Tuscaloosa.  The team isn't good. They finish 6-7 after a bowl loss. After the season, Shula is fired and Saban is hired.
948052312450371584 2018-01-01 04:44:19 UTC <BK432> As I'm wading through lots of 'issues', I end up spending a lot of time in particular in the Tuscaloosa market. In fact, one of our business units happens to be on campus.
948052058241929217 2018-01-01 04:43:19 UTC <BK432> So, it begins in 2005. My job changed, as I was promoted to oversee some business units in Alabama. All over the state.  Because of business circumstances (not all good) I am forced to spend a lot of time in the state over the next two years.
948051768419782656 2018-01-01 04:42:10 UTC <BK432> I feel like I should explain how I became an Alabama fan. Here goes.
948050570597883905 2018-01-01 04:37:24 UTC <BK432> Nope, but it won't be reversed. Not sure how they got that spot.https://twitter.com/js_hicks/status/948050426829705216

948044991514935296 2018-01-01 04:15:14 UTC <BK432> They FINALLY look like Alabama again. The magic that has seemingly been missing all year is coming together. Keep it going boys!

948041812819800064 2018-01-01 04:02:36 UTC <BK432> That's the kind of play we haven't gotten all damn year. Seems like we've been a split second late in every big moment. #RollTide
948020107212738561 2018-01-01 02:36:21 UTC <BK432> Great start for the Tide. About as good as you could draw it up. Defense is playing fantastic so far. Will it last?
947999777274331136 2018-01-01 01:15:34 UTC <BK432> Whoa Ive actually been kinda hoping for this. Kid is supremely talentedhttps://twitter.com/mzenitz/status/947989681010085888

947685904885444608 2017-12-31 04:28:21 UTC <BK432> I think this is fair. Clemson is a tough matchup. Alabama should not be the favorite. They've got their work cut out for them tomorrow night.https://twitter.com/BarrettSallee/status/947685061150822400

946117384368263171 2017-12-27 20:35:37 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne Yeah, his FIP hit an upward blip in '16 but was right back within norms last year. Nearly a 5-win pitcher last year in fWAR. Might not actually be much to fix; just get rid of the bad luck.
945757356918562816 2017-12-26 20:44:59 UTC <BK432> @katebrickman @Matt_Brickman life comes at you fast....
945727462528503808 2017-12-26 18:46:12 UTC <BK432> From the @twinsdaily 2018 Prospect Handbook (which, if you haven't bought, go buy now!: http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/sethspeaks).  Easy to forget this part of things. Teared up a bit reading this section about Mitch Garver. Baseball - what a game.pic.twitter.com/V8pwqxcq7r
945690720622522368 2017-12-26 16:20:12 UTC <BK432> The T-Wolves have the 7th best record in the entire NBA...and yet we (rightfully) feel pretty gross about the state of the team.  Perhaps a good sign they can win some games like this, but they have a long way to go to be what we want them to be.
945519295190138880 2017-12-25 04:59:01 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 weird indeed. In any case, it was a fumble, and I don't think the whistle caused a difference in the outcome of the play. so perhaps it's serendipitous. Still, it was pretty clear IMO.
945516535686287360 2017-12-25 04:48:03 UTC <BK432> There was hope, and then a kneel down taketh away.https://twitter.com/RandBall/status/945516406766006272

944793415354634240 2017-12-23 04:54:38 UTC <BK432> Sweeping the Packers. Feels good. Losing Nick Easton. Not so much.  Nevertheless, should end the season 13-3 after next week and a nice week off.

942946500451209216 2017-12-18 02:35:39 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls they could. I just think as its stated now I havent seen many problems.  I wouldnt be opposed to a change though.
942940211465674752 2017-12-18 02:10:40 UTC <BK432> Fantastic. We apparently still do chain mail, facilitated by parents of preschoolers who have nothing better to do than guilt other parents into participating.pic.twitter.com/0D0rC3vqIB
942901130450866181 2017-12-18 23:35:22 UTC <BK432> Once again, @DanBarreiroKFAN is the voice of reason. The "catch controversy" is not a controversy. Pretty easily a drop. People just want the Patriots to lose so bad I guess that they can't use their heads.

942773556169072640 2017-12-18 15:08:26 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls sure, maybe. I was specifically talking about the rule about securing the catch all the way to the ground. I don't know if there's a lack of consistency in general.
942613296296923137 2017-12-17 04:31:37 UTC <BK432> I can't believe I'm going to defend the NFL, but here goes. That catch rule has been consistently enforced the last several years. Love it or hate it, it at least has been applied equally across many catch scenarios.  Blaming the NFL is sour grapes. Period.
942600874651680769 2017-12-17 03:42:15 UTC <BK432> I went to Target for 30 minutes this afternoon so my son could by his mom a present.  Otherwise, spot on. No need for that craziness. @NadineBabuhttps://twitter.com/NadineBabu/status/942600487236521985
942586996177895424 2017-12-17 02:47:06 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls it's fun to get stuff like that now and then.

940802839634497536 2017-12-12 04:37:30 UTC <BK432> This Moore speech is perhaps the most unbelievable thing I've seen from this campaign yet.  IT IS OVER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN. GOD ISN'T CONTROLLING THE RESULTS, AND EVEN IF HE WERE, HE WOULDN'T HELP A CHILD MOLESTER!
940787872092819456 2017-12-12 03:38:02 UTC <BK432> And we won't forget that @realDonaldTrump supported a bigot child molester Republican that couldn't win in freaking Alabama.  Hard to overcome that little nugget.
940787496832634880 2017-12-12 03:36:32 UTC <BK432> This is just the start, @GOP. The bell tolls for thee. You have some good people. But you sold your soul behind these horrible bigots. America's coming for ya.

940781676476686336 2017-12-12 03:13:25 UTC <BK432> Ugh, I'm getting sucked in to actually believing the GOP won't elect a child molester. i'm letting the hope get to me.

938616800589307905 2017-12-06 03:50:58 UTC <BK432> @MikeBerardino phenomenal tweet. As I told Mackey, its willful ignorance. Not worth energy. Block and ignore.

938601747609776128 2017-12-06 02:51:09 UTC <BK432> @PhilMackey there's no point in even arguing with this sort of stupidity. They refuse to even try to understand. It's willful ignorance. Ignore and/or block. It's wonderful.

938600706570723329 2017-12-06 02:47:01 UTC <BK432> @BaseballByTom Correct indeed - the slot money, or the ability to spend, are tradeable assets. Pretty sweet deals.
938593451209379840 2017-12-06 02:18:11 UTC <BK432> Amazing work by Falvey/Lavine. I'm just so used to prior GM/leadership teams that this seems incredible. But trading an asset of value to others for a solid return should be table stakes. Still, I'm loving this.

938589813376208897 2017-12-06 02:03:44 UTC <BK432> I have a hard time believing that moderates/indys won't look at this and say, "well, one party is clearly more ethical than the other".  If GOP really want their spokesmen to be Roy Moore and Don Trump, go for it. It's a ticket for death.
938589145567563776 2017-12-06 02:01:05 UTC <BK432> This is exactly it. Can't play the "but what about him" game. GOP will have their steep, steep price to pay for looking the other way.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/938567500907929605
937901017416560640 2017-12-04 04:26:42 UTC <BK432> @MikeBerardino @JMHardinwrites 1 in GA, technically zero in Atlanta. Which is his point. Most of country considers Anaheim to be in LA. So if only one team in Los Angeles, then there's zero in Atlanta.

937538884669526016 2017-12-03 04:27:43 UTC <BK432> I think both these things are true. We'll see where this goes. Seems like there's a lot of good teams up top in the NFC but perhaps no GREAT teams.https://twitter.com/KummerA/status/937536623113392130
937532862894628864 2017-12-03 04:03:47 UTC <BK432> Forward pass.
937527512531423232 2017-12-03 03:42:32 UTC <BK432> Have no idea what the tiebreakers look like, but a Seattle win is obviously good for Vikings. So, this is good.
937519894748426240 2017-12-03 03:12:15 UTC <BK432> Easily a correct call. Touchback.
937519338860548096 2017-12-03 03:10:03 UTC <BK432> Carson Wentz is a damn good QB sneak guy.
937442265336832001 2017-12-03 22:03:47 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer even if they win out 10-6 may not be good enough. Chances are remote for them
937401909895417861 2017-12-03 19:23:26 UTC <BK432> @xylemmaster for sure. They had big time warts
937398225786503168 2017-12-03 19:08:47 UTC <BK432> @xylemmaster wouldnt have been my decision. I think they erred. But bring on Clemson.
937195321511366657 2017-12-02 05:42:31 UTC <BK432> This Alabama fan says:  Clemson Oklahoma Georgia Ohio State   There will be better years for the Tide.
937192136734371840 2017-12-02 05:29:52 UTC <BK432> @KummerA Ohio State over Alabama. Tide beat no one this season
937063131590942720 2017-12-02 20:57:15 UTC <BK432> I would have assumed it way too predictable and formulaic to have Trump's tweets help bring him down.  But it was probably inevitable.

935713693215744000 2017-11-28 03:35:03 UTC <BK432> There's such a big part of me that loves when our dog, who Leo calls his "sister", decides to sleep in his bed with him.  They absolutely love each other so much.....when he's not tormenting her.
935713082143395841 2017-11-28 03:32:38 UTC <BK432> Ugh, so much.......https://twitter.com/MLB/status/935712939444723712
935369538681655296 2017-11-27 04:47:31 UTC <BK432> @NoDakTwinsFan his tweet history indicate anger, delusion and possible mental instability. I'd steer clear.
935176055719153666 2017-11-27 15:58:41 UTC <BK432> Worth 5 minutes of your time, and a good reminder that TTO baseball likely isn't disappearing anytime soon.https://twitter.com/tangotiger/status/935175068082094080
934655883312812038 2017-11-25 05:31:42 UTC <BK432> If you aren't angry at this disgrace in the White House, then you aren't paying attention. I love Democrats. I love Republicans. #NeverTrump  How anyone could side with Trump is beyond me. No matter your party, he's an utter failure and embarrassment.https://twitter.com/GenMhayden/status/934640869562515457
934575549036552192 2017-11-25 00:12:29 UTC <BK432> Not making excuses for Gophers, but Tide made nearly every shot the last 10 minutes and Gophers were (understandably) tentative on offense. Gophers win but I can understand the story for Alabama.
934574801221545986 2017-11-25 00:09:30 UTC <BK432> This is very true. Florida State sucking has worked against the Tide for sure.https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/934574553262632960
934569594471305216 2017-11-25 23:48:49 UTC <BK432> Holy shit now Alabama (basketball) has an injury. They might have to play with 3. They might forfeit the rest of the game.........
934567806707949569 2017-11-25 23:41:43 UTC <BK432> This is the most bizarre game I've ever sort of paid attention to.https://twitter.com/GopherHole/status/934567724575002629
934567430742999040 2017-11-25 23:40:13 UTC <BK432> Basetball vs Gophs. Wow. Got quite chippy there, Gophers have dominated for the most part.https://twitter.com/thomasmcmahon22/status/934566795180232704
934566321215430661 2017-11-25 23:35:49 UTC <BK432> That looks awful for Kerryon Johnson. That is the worst thing that can happen if they are SEC championship bound. Awful.
934563526265491456 2017-11-25 23:24:42 UTC <BK432> Ugh, I've never seen anything like this from a Saban team. I said it early in the season; not sure this team is championship material. We'll see what happens. Might have to settle for a BCS bowl game this year.
934561258690490368 2017-11-25 23:15:42 UTC <BK432> As good as Auburn has been, that was a very odd play for the 2 pt.
934560051003580416 2017-11-25 23:10:54 UTC <BK432> Auburn has played an incredible game. We need some luck to get back in this. #RollTide
934551319200727040 2017-11-25 22:36:12 UTC <BK432> Have my 21 inch monitor streaming the @GopherMBB game so I'm keeping an eye on it. In this game I am NOT rooting for Bama. So the Gophers' performance is awesome so far. Crushing Alabama 30-13 at the under 8 TO.
934548467426480128 2017-11-25 22:24:52 UTC <BK432> Auburn has to feel like they've played a nearly perfect game (minus the fumbled snap) and they're still losing with 13:22 to go in 3Q.
934548297448153090 2017-11-25 22:24:11 UTC <BK432> Great response after halftime. Took 1:38. Bo rumbles to the endzone. XP makes it 14-10.
934546786512982017 2017-11-25 22:18:11 UTC <BK432> Probably would not be looked upon favorably. Might drop in the rankings if they only win by 35 TBH.https://twitter.com/patmayo/status/934546448519135233
934536753406464002 2017-11-25 21:38:19 UTC <BK432> That's our frosh. What a play by Jeudy to score. Nice deep pass by Jalen. XP ties it. New game.  #RollTide
934531513772859393 2017-11-25 21:17:30 UTC <BK432> Nice to get one back there. Huge break. Let's turn this into points, Bama.
934528301284151297 2017-11-25 21:04:44 UTC <BK432> That was so obvious, it's embarrassing that we didn't cover the kid. The entire stadium should have known that was coming.

934276994606526464 2017-11-24 04:26:08 UTC <BK432> Wow, what a terrible tourney for the Wildcats. Shocking, actually. They should sink quickly in the rankings.https://twitter.com/JonRothstein/status/934276693941981184

934156487680765952 2017-11-24 20:27:17 UTC <BK432> It's probably better this happened now. If the #Canes had played an actual good team this season they'd have gotten killed.
934131115014676480 2017-11-24 18:46:27 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man he said in his tweet that he did read it. I didnt.

932398477115568131 2017-11-19 00:01:34 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man I still think they're waiting for the right moment and not willing to force it. Which makes perfect sense to me.
932389207204605957 2017-11-19 23:24:44 UTC <BK432> It's been a slow burn for these Gophers. Yet, they're almost up 30. Sign of a good team? I think yes.

931635518697242626 2017-11-17 21:29:51 UTC <BK432> OK, it's been 16 days since the end of the World Series. I'm officially back in Fantasy Baseball mode.  Need some trade action BADLY. It's like a damn drug.

931368579987013632 2017-11-16 03:49:08 UTC <BK432> That was such a great goal by Zucker and I fear it wont be appreciated enough. Just a hell of a snipe.
931366209274175489 2017-11-16 03:39:42 UTC <BK432> @ktcole1 @KummerA you should blast Butterfly and wake her up and the kids and then leave and go to the bar. Send a GD message.

930247914932367360 2017-11-13 01:36:00 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man @Karl123459 ha, I'm on your side, trust me. Just wanting to hear different opinions.
930247845038391296 2017-11-13 01:35:44 UTC <BK432> Really nice win for a @GopherMBB team to win at Providence. Not Earth-shattering, but it's an easy game to let get away from you. Shows me they're on a different level.
930247277045788672 2017-11-13 01:33:28 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man @Karl123459 I tend to agree, though you may be right. I just fail to see any real evidence yet that Teddy is worth that gamble. I hope he is, but we just don't know, really.
930244374272847872 2017-11-13 01:21:56 UTC <BK432> A valid argument as well. I would personally hate to break up something that seems to be working, though.https://twitter.com/fran_the_man/status/930243583847710720
930242771868372993 2017-11-13 01:15:34 UTC <BK432> @BryzTwinkieTown And, I think we have a lot of hope that Teddy is good. Perhaps a decently educated guess. But I would argue we have virtually zero evidence of it.  All in all, seems a like a pretty damn risky move to replace a guy getting results.
930242311765811200 2017-11-13 01:13:44 UTC <BK432> There's probably something I'm missing. Heard from my man @BryzTwinkieTown that process < results. Very possible.  Just feels hard to turn the page on what's been a pretty electric season. QBR is near the top of the league.
930237524357926912 2017-11-13 00:54:43 UTC <BK432> I'm certain I'm not a super smart NFL fan, so please someone explain this to me.  Case Keenum is playing very, very well.  We all want Ted Bridgewater to be the guy. But Keenum has been very good.  So....why are we ready to replace him immediately?
929574661041610752 2017-11-11 05:00:44 UTC <BK432> Glad he's doing okay. Have loved following LaMonte's career since he was drafted. He has overperformed vs expectation at every level.https://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/929573752979025920
929572074250735617 2017-11-11 04:50:27 UTC <BK432> I literally cringed when I looked up the St. Thomas - St. Olaf score from today.  That ain't right. I'm not blaming anyone. But 97-0 just shouldn't happen.
929569576119087104 2017-11-11 04:40:32 UTC <BK432> @KummerA niiiiice, that's pretty good. For the record, I was watching with a Mississippi State Alum and fan at his house. Could have easily gone pear shaped......phew.
929533990322794501 2017-11-11 02:19:07 UTC <BK432> @mntrailrunner what? Like 7:40/mile right?? Thats amazing!!
929484894719348736 2017-11-11 23:04:02 UTC <BK432> Was driving through Georgia a couple weeks back. Guy on the radio was adamant that Georgia was the best team in the country and that they would crush Auburn and beat Alabama. It was quite precious, and this game shows his ridiculousness.
929411299867594759 2017-11-11 18:11:36 UTC <BK432> Not taking anything away from the Gophers, who seem to be playing well....  ....but this Husker defense is one of the worst I've seen this year. The tackling, the leverage, all of it, just awful.

928030649088380931 2017-11-07 22:45:23 UTC <BK432> @MikeBerardino that had to be a surreal and sobering situation. Wow. This is just so damn sad.
928029023183228928 2017-11-07 22:38:55 UTC <BK432> Some people are debating Roy Halladay's HOF credentials. If Roy Halladay ain't a HOF pitcher, I don't even know what one looks like anymore.
928027533219680257 2017-11-07 22:33:00 UTC <BK432> It's now a 280 character world, people. Get used to it.
928025550576410624 2017-11-07 22:25:07 UTC <BK432> He was one of the first players that I ever grew to love much, much more based on a growing knowledge of stats. Dies before HOF enshrinement
928025250096472064 2017-11-07 22:23:56 UTC <BK432> Man, the Halladay news hit me like a punch in the gut. Was at the top of his game during my aha re: stats-based fandom growth.
927993331203919873 2017-11-07 20:17:06 UTC <BK432> Might be a long shot, but really liking the idea of going after Carlos Santana for the #MNTwins.
927752752813494272 2017-11-06 04:21:07 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer The o/u was 43, which made it a loss based on the touchdown with no time left. Bad beat.
927752457278689280 2017-11-06 04:19:57 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer it was DET -2.5

926471582477946880 2017-11-03 15:30:12 UTC <BK432> What a fantastic 2017 post-mortem from @DCameronFG, fittingly about Charlie Morton:https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/charlie-morton-was-baseball-in-2017/
925941795078529024 2017-11-01 04:25:01 UTC <BK432> Not a lot of guys can match that sort of proposal. Thanks, Carlos.

925937367856361472 2017-11-01 04:07:26 UTC <BK432> Cool thing for Twins fans is we have leadership from the same cloth. The Astros can be us. Need some luck but our leaders get it. Thats big.
925936947335491584 2017-11-01 04:05:45 UTC <BK432> Congrats all around and to the SI team. They believed in organizational development and player development.https://twitter.com/schwartzstops/status/925936522976813056
925935523662790656 2017-11-01 04:00:06 UTC <BK432> Way to go Astros. What a phenomenal season and win for that organization. Love it so much.
925912650210476032 2017-11-01 02:29:13 UTC <BK432> This is quite true. Lot of games in front of us. Wolves have been pretty good actually so far.https://twitter.com/Seth_Kaplan/status/925912158625456128
925899209248821248 2017-11-01 01:35:48 UTC <BK432> Ain't this the truth. Justin Turner will be black and blue after the game fo' sho'https://twitter.com/StelliniTweets/status/925899047227088897
925888501257850881 2017-11-01 00:53:15 UTC <BK432> Well, 2-zip Houston, so they have to be happy, but 25 pitches from McCullers means bullpen sooner. They will need more than 2.

925569106513932288 2017-10-31 03:44:05 UTC <BK432> Game 7 y'all. Baseball should always go to a game 7.

923012287710969856 2017-10-24 02:24:12 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert GREAT PICTURE! And to Butch's credit, he was PISSED after the game about it

921476795261771776 2017-10-20 20:42:42 UTC <BK432> 2. If you can help anyone in a job search/career search, do it. Do it every time. Connect them with others. Meet with them for coffee.
921476572426665984 2017-10-20 20:41:49 UTC <BK432> Recognize accomplishments. Pay them well. Give them the benefit of the doubt. They'll reward you ten-fold.
921476339911315458 2017-10-20 20:40:54 UTC <BK432> I guess what I want to say is two-fold. 1 - if you own/run a company, your duty is to treat employees like gold. Value the hell outta them
921476031084748800 2017-10-20 20:39:40 UTC <BK432> I don't know why I feel compelled to say this out loud. But I worked there 16 years and the company was stolen from me. So there's that.
921475794358145025 2017-10-20 20:38:44 UTC <BK432> it's causing serious implications, health-wise, to those still there. They want another job. They're looking. But for now, they're stuck.
921475634932715525 2017-10-20 20:38:06 UTC <BK432> But here's the deal: my former employer is a nightmare right now. I'm glad I got out. I feel so, so bad for those still there.
921475441675980801 2017-10-20 20:37:20 UTC <BK432> I'm so relaxed right now. Enjoying a @InboundBrewCo Wild Rice Baltic Porter (which is brilliant), great wife, great kid, great job.
921470152151109633 2017-10-20 20:16:19 UTC <BK432> This is not a 10/10.  This isn't okay.  They still need help and our President seems to think we're done. Help now.  https://www.unicefusa.org/donate/support-unicef-usas-hurricane-relief-efforts-puerto-rico/32952?utm_campaign=2017_misc&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=0178/2/_Google&utm_content=PuertoRico&ms=cpc_dig_2017_misc_0178/2/_Google_PuertoRico&initialms=cpc_dig_2017_misc_0178/2/_Google_PuertoRicohttps://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/921396695841329152

921223101928448000 2017-10-19 03:54:37 UTC <BK432> Fun Thursday night game. Now I go to sleep.
921213712958152704 2017-10-19 03:17:19 UTC <BK432> Really happy to see the best team get to the World Series. And Clayton Kershaw too. Love this.
921210215357435904 2017-10-19 03:03:25 UTC <BK432> What a night for Kike Hernandez...... wow.
921201627452887041 2017-10-19 02:29:17 UTC <BK432> Will be awesome to see perhaps the best ever finally in the World  Series!!https://twitter.com/MLBONFOX/status/921201456463495168
921196340159369218 2017-10-19 02:08:17 UTC <BK432> @BryzTwinkieTown So sorry...
921021024979898368 2017-10-19 14:31:38 UTC <BK432> These laws were never intended to curb voter fraud. They're meant to suppress 'certain' voters that GOP knows go against them.https://twitter.com/thomyorke/status/921012547888836608
921018919514787840 2017-10-19 14:23:16 UTC <BK432> I'm sad that many states have pursued voter suppression laws, but as always, I'm damn proud of my state. We defeated it in here in Minnesotapic.twitter.com/34t9tdBQt4

920124003741765637 2017-10-16 03:07:12 UTC <BK432> @dbrauer dude, awesome thread and so happy for you and your son. My 4.5 year old wouldn't listen at all at football tonight. Small potatoes, huh?
920106582347866112 2017-10-16 01:57:58 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 that Indians org is one that is so good at using data and interpreting it. It's why I'm so happy with Falvey thus far. Brought it with him.
919760568449486848 2017-10-15 03:03:02 UTC <BK432> This wins. Well done, Stu.https://twitter.com/RandBallsStu/status/919760031905669121

919748074267922432 2017-10-15 02:13:23 UTC <BK432> Unlike too much of the playoffs so far, this Dodger-Cub game 2 is a fantastic baseball game.
919729177808556033 2017-10-15 00:58:18 UTC <BK432> As always, it's 1 guy of 22. A-Rodg is great, and QB is important, but I couldn't agree with the below more.https://twitter.com/NathanSchultz79/status/919725374149484545
919728466211241984 2017-10-15 00:55:28 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls oh. Perhaps that is true. Im not up to speed on Packer injuries. If so, disregard.
919716143874666503 2017-10-15 00:06:30 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan right! Or - are their trainers skilled in voodoo?
919715123123707906 2017-10-15 00:02:27 UTC <BK432> One of the most incredible stats Ive ever seen. Their lack of injuries is something other teams should study.https://twitter.com/Seth_Kaplan/status/919710677975023616
919412661204471809 2017-10-14 04:00:34 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I think they are talking about it, but in scattered ways. That's why the rule exists. To protect Contreras.
919412386636890113 2017-10-14 03:59:29 UTC <BK432> This. This is why I don't tolerate this "that's the way I raised" crap.  I used those words. I stopped. It's not hard to do.https://twitter.com/jessespector/status/919411993848811520

919410884333785088 2017-10-14 03:53:31 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert Croft has looked awfully solid at times this half. What do you think?
919407282978467842 2017-10-14 03:39:12 UTC <BK432> UTAH GOING FOR 2 POINT CONVERSION AND THE WIN ON ABC!!!
919399374316240897 2017-10-14 03:07:47 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I'm watching mine via streaming on mute, but I can only imagine. That's what @TBS gets for employing Ron Darling.
919398473874792449 2017-10-14 03:04:12 UTC <BK432> That's the proper call. Umps did their job. #NLCS
919080148338606080 2017-10-13 05:59:17 UTC <BK432> "Let's Play Two" was so damn good. If you're a fan of a team, watching the Vedder-Cubs connection should bring you to tears.
919058289597538304 2017-10-13 04:32:26 UTC <BK432> This @PearlJam special on @FS1  is incredible. I could watch McCready play guitar all damn day
919053717177094144 2017-10-13 04:14:16 UTC <BK432> @donnelly612 I can only imagine. Enjoy the show.

918991305149239297 2017-10-13 00:06:15 UTC <BK432> @KevinCRobb i mean that song is in my head constantly anyway so it easily morphs to Fleck
918991103357054977 2017-10-13 00:05:27 UTC <BK432> @KevinCRobb already done it many times.
918699368693166085 2017-10-12 04:46:12 UTC <BK432> Well, at least I have a clear rooting interest. Astros vs Dodgers or bust.
918697971146829825 2017-10-12 04:40:39 UTC <BK432> If they win with this, it's pure luck.https://twitter.com/joe_sheehan/status/918697839076577283
918695356937801728 2017-10-12 04:30:16 UTC <BK432> In a sport with the 'neighborhood play', surely we could find a way to avoid the Lobaton out. Christ.

918692076581134338 2017-10-12 04:17:14 UTC <BK432> At 9-8, Nats have a real chance in the 9th. Wow.
918684766400122880 2017-10-12 03:48:11 UTC <BK432> He's it. So sure. It's a 7 out save then.https://twitter.com/KummerA/status/918684230653132801
918681608697339904 2017-10-12 03:35:38 UTC <BK432> Quintana in the middle of the inning. This inning is EVERYTHING.
918641847366496256 2017-10-12 00:57:38 UTC <BK432> I was thinking the same thing. Went up out of the zone to crush that. https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/918641696283512832

917145424774955009 2017-10-08 21:51:23 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer why would they cut him? Isn't he still their #2 WR?
916864544428916737 2017-10-07 03:15:16 UTC <BK432> Horrible penalty by Sparty and then that ball - how was that not caught? They may survive....
916862874554916864 2017-10-07 03:08:38 UTC <BK432> 97 made the block and the tackle. Heck of a play.https://twitter.com/UAB_FB/status/916859983630872576

915765695178305536 2017-10-04 02:28:50 UTC <BK432> Cheryl Reeve is the GD best. I wish we could clone her.

915761432305815557 2017-10-04 02:11:54 UTC <BK432> @38Godfrey yeah, I don't think you quite understand Myron's point.
915426892949450752 2017-10-03 04:02:33 UTC <BK432> Damn good year but hell if I didn't want more.  Let's go Twins.
915406643130707968 2017-10-03 02:42:05 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 and there's no perfect stat. Anyone who tells you otherwise is crazy.  I did think he'd be slightly better.
915406421432393728 2017-10-03 02:41:12 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 you can choose to buy into whatever you want. There's no wrong way to do it.
915406120918937601 2017-10-03 02:40:01 UTC <BK432> The boy had the right idea. During top of 1st he was cheering, clapping, etc. Once top of 1 ended, he requested Team Umizoomi.
915405640490737664 2017-10-03 02:38:06 UTC <BK432> Really wish this weren't the case, but this game is over.
915396026953093121 2017-10-03 01:59:54 UTC <BK432> What's good for the goose (Yanks) is good for the gander (Twins)  Swinging bunt. Man on, one out.
915393669733257221 2017-10-03 01:50:32 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 meh, he's a 1.5 WAR player. I was hoping for a bit more bat AND glove but he's been an okay bridge.
915392783107620864 2017-10-03 01:47:01 UTC <BK432> This is it right here. Already had a couple of fleeting "I wish we didn't make it so I could just enjoy this game" thoughts.https://twitter.com/KummerA/status/915388409576902666
915391843520729088 2017-10-03 01:43:17 UTC <BK432> Nice snag by Castro there to secure the K.

915383823583596550 2017-10-03 01:11:25 UTC <BK432> BUCK
915383027852771333 2017-10-03 01:08:15 UTC <BK432> Side note - you can really feel the longer playoff commercial breaks. Feel like I could read a book between half innings.
915382907979669504 2017-10-03 01:07:46 UTC <BK432> I tried not to care about this game. Ugh. I couldn't do it. I'm hopelessly partisan and will be devastated if they lose. #MNTwins
915379994674769920 2017-10-03 00:56:12 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls @bhole1980 that was too much to take. 8 more innings of this?
915373120495775744 2017-10-03 00:28:53 UTC <BK432> It's a whole new world for us allhttps://twitter.com/MikeBatesSBN/status/915372763380158467
915370239461920768 2017-10-03 00:17:26 UTC <BK432> Nothing at all like playoff baseball. I'm hanging on EVERY pitch. #MNTwins
914921728933007360 2017-10-02 18:35:13 UTC <BK432> This man makes laws. Do we even have a chance? https://twitter.com/RepBarryMoore/status/914909483461173249
914589277572468737 2017-10-01 20:34:10 UTC <BK432> @Twins @Vikings @kellerjustin But this is just the tip of the iceberg, Keller. Win or not on Tuesday, the future is bright!
914585077950054401 2017-10-01 20:17:29 UTC <BK432> Pretty fun first couple minutes. I love the barbs she's already thrown Bert's way.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/914584773854720000
914583023361904640 2017-10-01 20:09:19 UTC <BK432> In any event, nice AB there from Rosario. I love this team.
914582726111645698 2017-10-01 20:08:08 UTC <BK432> Twins over the last year have more or less done exactly what they've needed to do. And criticism from meatheads continues every day.https://twitter.com/BK432/status/914582221763366918
914582221763366918 2017-10-01 20:06:08 UTC <BK432> I realize this is dick-ish, but to all the self-adulating Viking fans who have loved to take pot shots at the Twins over the years, congrats
914581832720580609 2017-10-01 20:04:35 UTC <BK432> @donnelly612 well, they were going to until the false start. On 3rd and whatever I get it.
914581467061202946 2017-10-01 20:03:08 UTC <BK432> Vikings got away with it. But it just amazes me how often NFL coaches fail to apply logic to their decisions.
914580472545644544 2017-10-01 19:59:11 UTC <BK432> So with the timeout at 2:03, Lions can now take a stab at a pass without a time penalty....
914338358482096128 2017-09-30 03:57:06 UTC <BK432> Not missing Lane Kiffin at all #RTR
914317187502002176 2017-09-30 02:32:59 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg I don't disagree. Just really liked what I've seen from him. If nothing else he should have an impact next year.
914305079720759296 2017-09-30 01:44:52 UTC <BK432> Curtiss had a great inning. Will we see him on Tuesday?
914192643193819137 2017-09-30 18:18:05 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert oh man that is too good - ha!
914001276563869698 2017-09-29 05:37:40 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg ah, that's the double meaning attached to a dribbler that becomes a hit. Less true today than past years but still fun :)
913959200748969984 2017-09-29 02:50:28 UTC <BK432> @_SuperMike you're the worst
913952154133630978 2017-09-29 02:22:28 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 are you with her?
913951886146985985 2017-09-29 02:21:24 UTC <BK432> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S STILL THE FIFTH INNING!!!

913942075468652544 2017-09-29 01:42:25 UTC <BK432> Lol the guys behind me are mad at Molitor for pulling Gibby in the MIDDLE OF AN INNING!
913935323243130881 2017-09-29 01:15:35 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yes! And then the series after that too! #GottaBelieve
913932982414643200 2017-09-29 01:06:17 UTC <BK432> For a couple 2nd inning HRs it got pretty electric in here. Let's get us some October baseball here! #MNTwins
913884343789084672 2017-09-29 21:53:01 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls this is 100% positive news. I agree, it won't be if they play him Tuesday if rust isn't shaken off.
913884033884540928 2017-09-29 21:51:47 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls @bhole1980 I'm at the game tonight too with a buddy. He's running in the mascot race. Where are you sitting?
913606930727399424 2017-09-28 03:30:40 UTC <BK432> Yuphttps://twitter.com/scott_pianowski/status/913606858501476352
913605661346418689 2017-09-28 03:25:38 UTC <BK432> One of the dirtiest hits I've ever seen. That is awful.
913603772944912384 2017-09-28 03:18:08 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert me even more so. I need this!!
913596667399680001 2017-09-28 02:49:53 UTC <BK432> Going to the game with @SethHilgert tomorrow. Will be super fun to welcome home our playoff-bound Twins!!
913595899451985920 2017-09-28 02:46:50 UTC <BK432> What an article by @rumhamlet. Wow - absolutely worth your 15 minutes. Please go read now.https://www.fangraphs.com/tht/foul-balls/

913257377268453376 2017-09-27 04:21:40 UTC <BK432> This was beyond improbable when the season started. Now we prepare for next Tuesday in the Bronx.

913246395456466950 2017-09-27 03:38:02 UTC <BK432> Ugh. They deserve to lose.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/913246071366848513
913243736532013056 2017-09-27 03:27:28 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer so was I
913238195235704832 2017-09-27 03:05:27 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yes
913227643243376640 2017-09-27 02:23:31 UTC <BK432> Danny Salazar was electric for 14 outs. Clevinger great after that.  These are their #5/#6 guys. Wow.
913187397080436737 2017-09-27 23:43:36 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @birgej you're right. There's no way to argue that at all

912873238803427329 2017-09-26 02:55:15 UTC <BK432> it's been a great run for the Royals' core - should be a heck of a celebration in KC on Sunday.https://twitter.com/michaelengel/status/912872871139119111
912871361726607360 2017-09-26 02:47:47 UTC <BK432> That was a great, great win. Wow.
912870787924860928 2017-09-26 02:45:30 UTC <BK432> @mntwinssisters yep. Twins got a caught a lot of grief nationally for not accepting the shit sandwich offer of De Leon, but they were 100% right.
912870118727798784 2017-09-26 02:42:51 UTC <BK432> Would have to think Dodgers, with benefit of hindsight, wish they had give up extra for Dozier instead of settling for Forsythe.
912869192646496256 2017-09-26 02:39:10 UTC <BK432> @TwinsGeek the voters are never wrong, except when they are. 100% should be Jarvis Brown.
912868471758901251 2017-09-26 02:36:18 UTC <BK432> Buxton drives it home! Love it!!!
912865933588402176 2017-09-26 02:26:13 UTC <BK432> Hildy with the perfect 8th. I'd take an insurance run or two, GUYS.
912865432192905221 2017-09-26 02:24:13 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls there's been a few. I was on the Trade Dozier train this offseason for sure. Really glad we didn't.
912865121482964992 2017-09-26 02:22:59 UTC <BK432> WOW. No other CF makes that catch.https://twitter.com/Travis_Sawchik/status/912864928251424768

912864497404141568 2017-09-26 02:20:31 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls Fun team to watch.
912864188615331840 2017-09-26 02:19:17 UTC <BK432> 6 more outs, and a the magic number becomes 1. Come on, bullpen.
912857911239561216 2017-09-26 01:54:20 UTC <BK432> I love Kep, but I would think Grossman would be the better play here....
912517342185345024 2017-09-25 03:21:02 UTC <BK432> Magic number is 2 - it's gonna happen. Twins will be playing a week from tomorrow. This world is insane-o.
911912783528198144 2017-09-24 11:18:44 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 was the surgery because of a needle in the eye? Or was that part of the surgery?

911429551921750016 2017-09-22 03:18:33 UTC <BK432> That is at best a debatable decision by Craig Counsell. Wow....
911428532869451776 2017-09-22 03:14:30 UTC <BK432> Ballgame in Houston. Angels are 3 GB. Texas may pass but currently losing.
911410782553993216 2017-09-22 02:03:58 UTC <BK432> Boom. Ballgame. 2.5 game lead at worst at end of night with 8 games to play.
911399149110775808 2017-09-22 01:17:44 UTC <BK432> That HR fron Kinsler notwithstanding, I'm buying what Gibson is selling right now. He looks like a different pitcher.
911386891899031552 2017-09-22 00:29:02 UTC <BK432> Gibby settling in and dealing. Let's tack on a couple more! #MNTwins
911385322906406912 2017-09-22 00:22:48 UTC <BK432> Hopefully they go out and earn that respect.https://twitter.com/timfaklis/status/911383940660891649
911267350112030722 2017-09-22 16:34:01 UTC <BK432> Outstanding write-up. I was slow to warm to Rosario this year, but it seems to be coming together.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/911262325721763840
911066098388422657 2017-09-21 03:14:19 UTC <BK432> Whoa - Baez down to his last strike and he hits a seeing eye grounder to CF to tie it.
911065687208218624 2017-09-21 03:12:41 UTC <BK432> Good lord I swear I could strike out Javy Baez - guy swings at everything.
911060768052965382 2017-09-21 02:53:08 UTC <BK432> 2.5 game lead with 9 games to go. Shit's getting real.  #MNTwins
911053486451765248 2017-09-21 02:24:12 UTC <BK432> @MikeBerardino I remember the article which sent me off to a 30 minute dive on Fangraphs. The signs were there. BTW, the comments on the article are great.
911051646670536705 2017-09-21 02:16:53 UTC <BK432> Eric freaking Sogard ties up this ballgame.  Telling you right now: Rockies ain't going to the playoffs. This Brewers team is ELECTRIC.
911051422514458624 2017-09-21 02:16:00 UTC <BK432> Truly amazing. Glad he'll be back in 2018 (can't believe I'm saying that!)https://twitter.com/InsideEdgeScout/status/911040738900791298
910990561309577216 2017-09-21 22:14:09 UTC <BK432> Fancy restaurants, theatre, galas, okay.  But a baseball game? Pamela is deranged.https://twitter.com/mschlegel34/status/910989575606202369

910975844327313413 2017-09-21 21:15:41 UTC <BK432> So, I start work downtown @cityofsaintpaul next week - any bets on how long till I visit @BarrelTheory and @wabashabrewery??
910570259719053319 2017-09-20 18:24:02 UTC <BK432> Well, this got less fun in a hurry.
910569601553043458 2017-09-20 18:21:25 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 seen it, haven't tried it. Will have to venture over someday.
910566129113985024 2017-09-20 18:07:37 UTC <BK432> And, another mound visit. Ugh.
910565776956026880 2017-09-20 18:06:13 UTC <BK432> I don't agree with Bert all the time but he couldn't be more right here. Ump has gotta get control of the mound visits.
910502871204077569 2017-09-20 13:56:15 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yeah, and if I could fit it in between trips to Lowe's and the recycling center! :)
910488873591087104 2017-09-20 13:00:38 UTC <BK432> First unemployed day since I was 15 (I'm now 38). Kinda crazy. I only get 3 days before Monday comes so gonna live it up with some errands.
910321766605709313 2017-09-19 01:56:36 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne you deserve it - you work really, really hard
910316444499562496 2017-09-19 01:35:27 UTC <BK432> Lesson for the day: a dose of ibuprofen can get the kid through the day before the fever comes back. #ParentLessons

910219562557337602 2017-09-19 19:10:29 UTC <BK432> @TheAthleticMIN @Brandon_Warne can't wait. Great job there so far.

910179673455423489 2017-09-19 16:31:59 UTC <BK432> @PhilMackey I'm not a Gopher fan, but I would personally reserve judgment a little longer. Beat a couple decent Big Ten teams and I'd be in, I think.
910170929610788865 2017-09-19 15:57:14 UTC <BK432> Yeah, I'm not sure it's wise to form any conclusions on the basis of what Doug's wife said. Agreed. https://twitter.com/McGive_It_To_Me/status/910162722335096832

908502451132567552 2017-09-14 01:27:18 UTC <BK432> If you're not nice, above all else, people won't want to help you.  Sounds simple but it's so true and so important.
908502044079738880 2017-09-14 01:25:41 UTC <BK432> Bottom line lesson: be good to people. Be nice. Be nicer than you need to be. People will run through walls for you if you're nice.
908501842568630273 2017-09-14 01:24:53 UTC <BK432> At peace. Last day at current job upcoming. Hard to leave the comfort of what we know. But the future holds good stuff.

908176545885323265 2017-09-13 03:52:16 UTC <BK432> Eddie Rosario's transformation (against what I believed possible) this season has been incredible. Legit ballplayer.
908176046633222144 2017-09-13 03:50:17 UTC <BK432> Rosario does it!!!!!
908152323314241536 2017-09-13 02:16:01 UTC <BK432> That young man is why I'm proud to be a Dinelson Lamet owner on my rebuilding NL squad. Kid has some serious stuff.

907410169251995648 2017-09-11 01:06:57 UTC <BK432> Well, I see #19 is pretty much a given already for the Indians. Tigers giving no resistance.
906732820923654144 2017-09-09 04:15:25 UTC <BK432> I never played the game (well, not after 6th grade at least) but I will never understand how a player makes a fair catch at their own 2.

906680950284845056 2017-09-09 00:49:18 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin I just meant it was like watching Russell-Tyler-Ruthton pound JCC #duh
906621104487354368 2017-09-09 20:51:30 UTC <BK432> I mean, if Bama wasn't out there trying to work on things, it kind of feels like they could do what they just did every drive. #RTR

905251589073637377 2017-09-05 02:09:32 UTC <BK432> Things changed 5 months ago. A great reminder how important it is to have good people at the top. And how we all have the power to leave.
905251191122268160 2017-09-05 02:07:57 UTC <BK432> Was treated very well for the vast majority of my run. Compensated fairly enough. Benefits have mostly sucked but people & culture were A+.
905250798069833728 2017-09-05 02:06:23 UTC <BK432> I was 21 years old & an incoming college senior when I joined my current company.  Today, 16+ years later, I gave my notice. Was a good run.

904398573437104130 2017-09-03 17:39:57 UTC <BK432> @twikipedium love it! Exemption for my 4.5 yr old?
904301504135405568 2017-09-03 11:14:14 UTC <BK432> I have no doubt that there are still some people who would find fault in Joe Mauer right now. Because some people are very miserable.
904182967202979840 2017-09-02 03:23:12 UTC <BK432> @jalbus I kinda wish I was there tbh
904176987702525952 2017-09-02 02:59:27 UTC <BK432> Francois isn't gonna win a lot of friends amongst his teammates by blaming his WR for a terrible throw.

904172436807147524 2017-09-02 02:41:22 UTC <BK432> A little daylight for Damien and boom, he's in. After 2 point conversion it's 21-7 good guys.  Well, my good guys.
904167439050702849 2017-09-02 02:21:30 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man ha!  Mackey: "The Twins wiped out a -75 run differential in one month...."
904166160614264836 2017-09-02 02:16:25 UTC <BK432> This is the big story here. Wow. Team is playing some great, great baseball.https://twitter.com/PhilMackey/status/904166042326499328
904165685651263488 2017-09-02 02:14:32 UTC <BK432> @1500ESPN_Reusse @todd_dingmann @JeffStottlemyer I mean, I'm a Tommie but what do you want them to do? Outside of taking a knee the entire 2nd half what more could they have done?
904162796321083393 2017-09-02 02:03:03 UTC <BK432> May not be the first to note this, but if this score holds, Twins run differential on the year is suddenly +1.
904150655018958852 2017-09-02 01:14:49 UTC <BK432> Twins have been in more games this year decided by 10+ runs (on both sides of them) than I ever recallhttps://twitter.com/RhettBollinger/status/904150430803951616

904149181299920896 2017-09-02 01:08:57 UTC <BK432> Seems like FSU is mainly keying on stopping the Bama tailbacks, daring Jalen to beat them. That drive it bit them in the ass.

904147241799168000 2017-09-02 01:01:15 UTC <BK432> @_SuperMike I actually want Noah to tweet out some Bama takes.
904147030850797569 2017-09-02 01:00:25 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne and the one comment - guessing he won't be back to offer his apologies
903811699475697664 2017-09-01 02:47:55 UTC <BK432> @michaelengel and I'll text Jesus.
903811242418110464 2017-09-01 02:46:06 UTC <BK432> Sure, say what you will, but that was a horrific called strike. Not even close. Twins should expect the same zone.https://twitter.com/michaelengel/status/903810853098717184
903776614860951556 2017-09-01 00:28:30 UTC <BK432> What can you even say about Jorge Polanco right now. Unreal.

903424835916836865 2017-08-31 01:10:40 UTC <BK432> Phew - finally sitting down to watch some Gopher football. Figured they'd be winning by a bit more by now. What's going on @SethHilgert?
903424625610194944 2017-08-31 01:09:50 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man Barely indeed

903093590729125888 2017-08-30 03:14:25 UTC <BK432> Every team has these games, but man do the White Sox look absolutely shitty.
903084812696776706 2017-08-30 02:39:32 UTC <BK432> Mike Pelfrey: turning a 6-3 groundout into an infield hit. Love that guy.
902733962237415424 2017-08-29 03:25:23 UTC <BK432> F yeah. Twins win, now 68-63 on the year. 5 more wins and they clinch a non-90 loss season, despite the preseason predictions of many.
902728441547587584 2017-08-29 03:03:27 UTC <BK432> @TheEconomist @kellerjustin thanks for making my night so awesome, KELLER.

902724118298144768 2017-08-29 02:46:16 UTC <BK432> Jorge Polanco cannot be stopped. Wowie.
902720354933555200 2017-08-29 02:31:19 UTC <BK432> As an Abreu owner, I'm happy to take that RBI double so long as the Twins shut this shit down.

902695168129863680 2017-08-29 00:51:14 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar kinda insane, thinking back to April and May.
902694899811799040 2017-08-29 00:50:10 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar Dozier is the only one ahead of him in fWAR, correct?

901957305981394946 2017-08-27 23:59:13 UTC <BK432> @Ex_Twins_News it's not even worth the time. People can't fathom there's a level between all-star and terrible when it comes to Joe Mauer
901954635057045511 2017-08-27 23:48:37 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood that's also true
901925635190390785 2017-08-27 21:53:23 UTC <BK432> And I love Judge, but since Rhys isn't a Yankee, many still haven't heard of him. Sad!https://twitter.com/TheGoodPhight/status/901909996283277313
901924581501526016 2017-08-27 21:49:11 UTC <BK432> 32 games left....and the #MNTwins are in it and playing good ball. Buxton has arrived. Amazing. Should be a really fun last 5 weeks.
901900919373266945 2017-08-27 20:15:10 UTC <BK432> Buxton has changed the level to EASY. This feels like something, doesn't it?
901645946576130048 2017-08-26 03:22:00 UTC <BK432> @michaelcbarr I must have missed that. I hope everything's okay....

896365166534823936 2017-08-12 13:38:04 UTC <BK432> @Swydan I'd let someone pay (overpay?) for they hype and at least that crosses off one. Eaton is a tough call....
896364768981811202 2017-08-12 13:36:29 UTC <BK432> @Swydan can you trade Devers in offseason?
896360716583567360 2017-08-12 13:20:23 UTC <BK432> Kinda need to start fantasy football prep, but the rankings on @TheHuddle look like they've been hacked or something.  Mike Glennon #1 QB?
896339929646735360 2017-08-12 11:57:47 UTC <BK432> I will proudly say that Falvey/Lavine have done a terrific job. It's nice to have leadership that understands how to build a winner.
896339663010574340 2017-08-12 11:56:43 UTC <BK432> I can understand the second-guessing if you believe Garcia and Kintzler make a difference (I don't) but where were these fans a week ago?
896339135753015300 2017-08-12 11:54:37 UTC <BK432> Well, the comments on the Strib #MNTwins gamer are landing right where you'd expect.  Fire Falvey. Fire Lavine.  Awesome people out there...
896336288063868928 2017-08-12 11:43:18 UTC <BK432> If the season ended today.....  .....one game. Yankee Stadium. Twins v Yankees.  Just what we all want, right? Right?
895835970100133889 2017-08-10 02:35:13 UTC <BK432> @PhilMackey damn, this is truly gutting. I'm so sorry. She'd love this tribute I'm sure.

895664810792235008 2017-08-10 15:15:06 UTC <BK432> @twikipedium yes! Every year was pure domination in those days.  I told my dad that we were going to sweep all 4 this year. Just one more to get.
895663190025146368 2017-08-10 15:08:39 UTC <BK432> @twikipedium you have to. I think we'll have a playoff-caliber team next year, but may as well enjoy mid-August and being in it.
895662017696202755 2017-08-10 15:04:00 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yeah, ya think? :)
895661986515759104 2017-08-10 15:03:52 UTC <BK432> @twikipedium well-written column and hard not to have the same feelings. Colon won't do that every time but last night was great.

895651078741557248 2017-08-10 14:20:32 UTC <BK432> 50 games to go. Twins are still in it. Focus on what you want, but man, this has been a fun season.
895367928677380096 2017-08-09 19:35:23 UTC <BK432> @TwinsGeek @BenRemington Oh my god that's brilliant. Would be the greatest troll job ever.
895111544861843460 2017-08-08 02:36:37 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @Plouffe24Fan Exactly - he won't get to a team that might want to work out a trade. Dozier isn't a waiver trade guy.
895110453864656897 2017-08-08 02:32:17 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I don't see how he would clear waivers, though. They could try but I can't see him getting through all 29 teams.
895104438821683200 2017-08-08 02:08:23 UTC <BK432> Got to watch that #DozierSlam with Brewer fan and dad @jeffreykummer. Felt a little bad for my fist pumps
894768454686965760 2017-08-07 03:53:18 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne very interesting. I hope he gets a couple starts later this year.
894767473626456067 2017-08-07 03:49:24 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne Looking at his @fangraphs page....he's shown nothing of this ability before this year. What's changed?
894761184510976000 2017-08-07 03:24:24 UTC <BK432> Or his skills are easily replaceable. One way or the other.https://twitter.com/Ex_Twins_News/status/894760649875521537
894692807818063872 2017-08-07 22:52:42 UTC <BK432> @BaseballPirate They need to stop being babies. It's a horrible trade. But you handle it by kicking out the bad owner at the end of the year and replacing.
894692192404504577 2017-08-07 22:50:15 UTC <BK432> I mean, I'm kidding because we can't take those not in an MLB org, not because I don't trust that swing. Holy moly.

893504071067467778 2017-08-04 16:09:05 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer man, some of that's just generational change but I find it sad.
893502982456832000 2017-08-04 16:04:46 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer he's our German. Not yours. You can't have him.

892223252742975488 2017-07-31 03:19:34 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls always trade relievers. Always.
892150491328778243 2017-07-31 22:30:27 UTC <BK432> Watson to Kernels. He should dominate therehttps://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/892148251926962176
892115432806731776 2017-07-31 20:11:08 UTC <BK432> Tyler Watson likely to join Fort Myers for the rest of the season. Looks to be a solid pickup. Kintzler, well done to you and good luck.
891657191882727424 2017-07-30 13:50:15 UTC <BK432> Levine and Falvey convinced ownership to use these $ to buy prospects. Not sure I ever saw former guy be able to pull that off.
891656554625331200 2017-07-30 13:47:43 UTC <BK432> This Jaime Garcia scenario tells me all I need to know about this FO.  High-level baseball guys. We are in good hands.
891641193293115392 2017-07-30 12:46:41 UTC <BK432> Ha! Yes.  If this trade is as reported, this is a heckuva flip for Twins.https://twitter.com/jeremynygaard/status/891640145073623040

891364864442159109 2017-07-29 18:28:39 UTC <BK432> @smokeysdugout no he actually wasn't really that good. That was the problem. Was way out pitching his peripherals
891364246176632832 2017-07-29 18:26:11 UTC <BK432> @smokeysdugout LOL that's actually not me at all. That was just a terrible trade. Was I wrong?

890616943333355520 2017-07-27 16:56:40 UTC <BK432> Right? I'm shocked at the return the Diamondbacks always give us for mediocre catchers.https://twitter.com/MikeBatesSBN/status/890612749750816769

889533337819164674 2017-07-24 17:10:49 UTC <BK432> I'm happy to see Busenitz back with the Twins. He's shown he can be at least useful.  Best of luck to Craig Breslow.
889484400420950016 2017-07-24 13:56:21 UTC <BK432> Hit maybe 25 chips on to the backyard green yesterday afternoon and my right forearm is quite sore.  In related news, I am pathetic.
888957093105078273 2017-07-22 03:01:01 UTC <BK432> That 8th inning was a bit scary but hey, a win is a win is a win. #MNTwins

888952935354441728 2017-07-22 02:44:30 UTC <BK432> Feels weird to be buying instead of selling in my HBL league. But with Correa, Starlin and Polanco all landing on the DL, gotta buy.

888922525308248065 2017-07-22 00:43:40 UTC <BK432> It (kind of) worked out but nobody should be walking Escobar intentionally to get to Granite.
888922020402147328 2017-07-22 00:41:39 UTC <BK432> That is an interesting intentional walk of Escobar. Huh.

887769872134004737 2017-07-19 20:23:26 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 aggregation of statistics. I certainly don't use it as a be all end all, especially in one season. Just a datapoint.
887765285134008320 2017-07-19 20:05:12 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 FWIW their framing ranks haven't been great so the Twins did buy some regression there.
887764607871397888 2017-07-19 20:02:31 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 maybe? I dunno. That contract is peanuts. They can afford a lot more.

887315146888105984 2017-07-18 14:16:31 UTC <BK432> Was wondering what I drove by this morning. Stolen car, went over embankment here down wooded hill into creek, NE corner of intersection.https://twitter.com/wwozzydo/status/887301744560136192
887200203815755776 2017-07-17 06:39:46 UTC <BK432> It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning. Most people on this plane are sleeping. If you could refrain from laughing like a coyote it would be great
887148734932561922 2017-07-17 03:15:15 UTC <BK432> BOOM! Not the thunder, but the Twins' win.. Nice 8th inning rally to set up the win.
887148195574427649 2017-07-17 03:13:06 UTC <BK432> Seems like a race between storms starting and baseball finishing at Target Field. Should be close......
887146358813192192 2017-07-17 03:05:48 UTC <BK432> Really surprised Smith is pitching to Dozier here.....
887124475619098628 2017-07-17 01:38:51 UTC <BK432> Flying next to drunk guy and the girlfriend who wants to help him. Wish I could jump out of this airplane.
887112660742950912 2017-07-17 00:51:54 UTC <BK432> In the least shocking news ever because most Senators don't wish to harm their constituents.https://twitter.com/donnelly612/status/887111877066731520
887111394386001920 2017-07-17 00:46:52 UTC <BK432> That was one hell of a double play turned by Boston. Whoa.
887088219430330368 2017-07-17 23:14:47 UTC <BK432> @justabicho @Patrick_Fenelon it's actually higher than I would have expected......
887081793576345600 2017-07-17 22:49:15 UTC <BK432> @justabicho @Patrick_Fenelon actually, take heed. 55% of Trump voters admit this unethical at best meeting took place. I think that's meaningful.
887080922595549184 2017-07-17 22:45:47 UTC <BK432> So now we have our number. 45% of Trump voters are completely unhinged and moronic.https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/887042589622403073
887065455193497600 2017-07-17 21:44:20 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne ah. Was wondering why his name was on their roster.
886962028295749632 2017-07-17 14:53:21 UTC <BK432> Umm....I mean, I'm one of the biggest Brad Hand fans out there, but Preller, this is a bit insane.https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/886957168586620929
886760960358195200 2017-07-16 01:34:22 UTC <BK432> This is what I keep thinking. Does nothing well but BB%https://twitter.com/Swydan/status/886756812841734144
886745144145264640 2017-07-16 00:31:31 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yeah, baseball happens....
886728042051018752 2017-07-16 23:23:34 UTC <BK432> Never been prouder to fly Deltahttps://twitter.com/Delta/status/886714198880866305
886727223599742976 2017-07-16 23:20:19 UTC <BK432> All is right in the world again, as I lose all 3 bets today (STL, TB, ARI)  I see you, Vegas.
886714579534753792 2017-07-16 22:30:04 UTC <BK432> Rough go for your guy, @yoshihenhttps://twitter.com/kellerjustin/status/886628000883777538
886691528927625217 2017-07-16 20:58:29 UTC <BK432> @BryzTwinkieTown Indeed, we did.
886443232816644097 2017-07-15 04:31:50 UTC <BK432> A very rare Saturday evening. I won 3 of 3 MLB bets (thank you Tigers, Cubs and Rays). Feeling more positive about Las Vegas by the minute.
886404273394769920 2017-07-15 01:57:02 UTC <BK432> Taylor Rogers is doing WORK!
886393672488468480 2017-07-15 01:14:54 UTC <BK432> Ball, strike, whatever - that was a GREAT pitch by Sipp there. Elite.
886370560384446465 2017-07-15 23:43:04 UTC <BK432> I can understand why Mauer wanted to cut that, but bad play. Robbed Rosario of an amazing assist.
886303665434238976 2017-07-15 19:17:15 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan I see what you did there
886280688583942145 2017-07-15 17:45:57 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets thanks Seth!
886265774398156800 2017-07-15 16:46:41 UTC <BK432> Anyone know when Enlow and/or Leach may pitch for GCL? @SethTweets ?
886263517204107264 2017-07-15 16:37:43 UTC <BK432> Nice to see the Twins get 2 of their recent draftees in this write-up. Both should be promoted soon.https://twitter.com/BaseballAmerica/status/886261579276103680
886257436285390849 2017-07-15 16:13:33 UTC <BK432> Yes - we are seeing vintage (peak?) Kluber now and it likely has legs. He'll be damn fun to watch in his remaining 15-16 starts.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/886255379499364353
886250943712514048 2017-07-15 15:47:45 UTC <BK432> I'll be landing in Las Vegas in 90 minutes. It's 8:45 AM there right now. It's currently 98 degrees. Kill me now.
886201090290716672 2017-07-15 12:29:39 UTC <BK432> @KummerA MLB's Facebook feed was showing it via Facebook Live last night. Never seen them do anything like that before.
886023482387177472 2017-07-14 00:43:54 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man I feel ya - but what if FB/Twitter/Insta could do more broadcasting? Open the game up to more? That's not a bad thing....
886019364276895744 2017-07-14 00:27:32 UTC <BK432> I want to encourage this behavior, so I'm watching the Twins-Astros game on Facebook. I suggest you do the same. #CutTheCord
886010502991761408 2017-07-14 23:52:19 UTC <BK432> @CoorsLight @ZIMA_JAPAN @Aeddy11 Where's the Facebook 'Haha' reaction?
885974904243458048 2017-07-14 21:30:52 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt EXACTLY
885974085896941572 2017-07-14 21:27:37 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt Mark, Nick, it's basically the same name.... LOL
885973238391721984 2017-07-14 21:24:15 UTC <BK432> Wow does that suck. At least Mark and Zack can rehab together...https://twitter.com/mlbtraderumors/status/885972939912478720
885973071361953792 2017-07-14 21:23:35 UTC <BK432> 100 minutes until baseball....finally. #LifeIsHard
885967963286900736 2017-07-14 21:03:17 UTC <BK432> I'm late, but a great piece from @based_ball on the big trade. One of those deals you have to love for both teams.http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/cubs-accurately-rate-underrated-jose-quintana/
885964297926586369 2017-07-14 20:48:43 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg ha - of course Mike!
885917175789301760 2017-07-14 17:41:28 UTC <BK432> I've finally made it in life. Bought 3 bottles. Can't wait to have this tonight.pic.twitter.com/ZFSov8Iy2F
885694951941713920 2017-07-13 02:58:26 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man shocking. No one could have seen that coming.
885691349990871044 2017-07-13 02:44:07 UTC <BK432> Wow - what a photo and story. https://twitter.com/ellehardytweets/status/885665029567254529
885682034450075648 2017-07-13 02:07:06 UTC <BK432> AL-only league, I have pitching points to pick up. Running Kluber, Hamels, Fulmer, Britton and Giles out all 2nd half. I think I have a shot
885675400587874304 2017-07-13 01:40:45 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls ha! No room for nuance on Twitter. I bring that positivity to field every game, coach.
885667802740404226 2017-07-13 01:10:33 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man that's a good point.....
885663744864522240 2017-07-13 00:54:26 UTC <BK432> I'm dying a little on the inside. No baseball again. Just gotta make it to tomorrow night.....
885657588674834433 2017-07-13 00:29:58 UTC <BK432> @andrewhelmers a damn smart one Helmers. Bell is proven. Mejia is still a non-MLB guy
885565251541979140 2017-07-13 18:23:03 UTC <BK432> @Debased_Gamer @Kreepy_Kralle24 I just know enough that he's only thrown 60 IP so far this year. Hard to see him stretched out for a rotation spot by next year.
885560666400141321 2017-07-13 18:04:50 UTC <BK432> @Debased_Gamer @Kreepy_Kralle24 perhaps another reason to draft the OF. Buehler won't be in a rotation before June 2019.
885557396428423171 2017-07-13 17:51:50 UTC <BK432> @Debased_Gamer @Kreepy_Kralle24 excuse the age error. It will be interesting for sure. Just saying if I were GM I prefer the OF to a SP
885556229854162946 2017-07-13 17:47:12 UTC <BK432> @Debased_Gamer Buehler is solid but I can't make him the primary return. 19 years old and 70 professional innings = too much risk
885541389085405184 2017-07-13 16:48:14 UTC <BK432> @mike_petriello talks begin with Verdugo, right? Orioles shouldn't even pick up the phone if Dodgers won't move him.
885333451142029312 2017-07-12 03:01:58 UTC <BK432> After trading Josh Bell and a draft pick, I own Francisco Mejia in one of my leagues. Couldn't be happier. I see a multiyear all-star.
885318909611692032 2017-07-12 02:04:11 UTC <BK432> Are we this stupid as a human race?https://twitter.com/JimmyTraina/status/885249539850084352
885251509725876224 2017-07-12 21:36:21 UTC <BK432> It's true. You literally can't find a written article on the site.  Aaaaaaand I will never visit the @FOXSports site againhttps://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/885242822122770432
884970764168048641 2017-07-11 03:00:46 UTC <BK432> The little dude started t-ball tonight. He is......not a superstar. But damn if that wasn't fun for all of us.  #WhatAllStarGame?
884609238399668226 2017-07-10 03:04:12 UTC <BK432> @BryzTwinkieTown yeah, these umps lose themselves a bit sometimes. If it's a tournament or something, fine. But my god, we suck and we got run-ruled.
884608258471845890 2017-07-10 03:00:18 UTC <BK432> @BK432 I'm fine with rules but I was trying to get the game over with. Swing at the first pitch I see. Seemed overly prodigious. Am I wrong?
884607978476896256 2017-07-10 02:59:11 UTC <BK432> Played in shitty D league game tonight. I barely stepped in front of plate trying to hit non-strike. We were losing by 20. Ump called me outpic.twitter.com/SsannKbXcE
884604626846326784 2017-07-10 02:45:52 UTC <BK432> @bhole1980 it wouldn't have mattered. Judge would have hit 35 if he needed to.
884604151019261953 2017-07-10 02:43:59 UTC <BK432> I will never tire of watching Tim Raines and Andre Dawson go back to back, I don't care if it's slow pitch softball.
884598550591660033 2017-07-10 02:21:44 UTC <BK432> Aaron Judge is on another planet. That was insane.
884597689845002240 2017-07-10 02:18:18 UTC <BK432> @KummerA but holy shit he has no chance against Judge, does he?
884593313776623616 2017-07-10 02:00:55 UTC <BK432> Miguel Sano has no chance, does he....?
884593048474329088 2017-07-10 01:59:52 UTC <BK432> JUDGE WENT 504 THEN 513
884589936476815364 2017-07-10 01:47:30 UTC <BK432> Not gonna lie, I love seeing Sano make the finals.
884578949438873605 2017-07-10 01:03:50 UTC <BK432> That was fun. Bellinger and Blackmon put on a show.
884246301038325760 2017-07-09 03:02:01 UTC <BK432> West coast delay. At pick 1.3, @whatupbill goes to a major league ready bat as well, selecting Rhys Hoskins. Great BB/K and slash. Good pick
884245260368584706 2017-07-09 02:57:53 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @BaseballAmerica @tom_bigwood so true....
884202758840217600 2017-07-09 00:09:00 UTC <BK432> @BaseballAmerica @mattkummer hey, I took a guy with ZERO pro innings in the 1st last year, so no ripping on you from me.  BTW, Puk is shooting up rankings this year.
884189274488410112 2017-07-09 23:15:25 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @BaseballAmerica I own pick 1.2. I'm thrilled to select Alex Verdugo. Hard to find many 21 year olds at AAA with more BB than K & a .346/.416/.463/.879 slash
884188690033102848 2017-07-09 23:13:05 UTC <BK432> @BaseballAmerica 1.1 goes to @mattkummer and he selects Walker Buehler. Good prospect, less than 70 IP as a pro. Risky but could be nice reward.
884188350667796480 2017-07-09 23:11:44 UTC <BK432> Captain's Deck League minors draft is underway. Top @BaseballAmerica prospect available is #15 Mitch Keller.
884128345436418048 2017-07-09 19:13:18 UTC <BK432> Grossman could be a 1 WAR player with a 110-115 wRC this season. Huge get.
884127865255714819 2017-07-09 19:11:24 UTC <BK432> Who would have guessed that when the Twins added Grossman in May of last year after he opted out in Cleveland that we'd be getting THIS?
884127308243755008 2017-07-09 19:09:11 UTC <BK432> Quick reminder: absolutely NO lead is safe when you have Ubaldo Jimenez on the mound.
884127045357363201 2017-07-09 19:08:08 UTC <BK432> That is a big-boy, professional at bat there by Grossman. Love that so much.

883162525830983680 2017-07-06 03:15:29 UTC <BK432> I'm not sure who that Brandon Kintzler was. Where did that stuff come from?!?
883075645697339392 2017-07-06 21:30:15 UTC <BK432> I prefer all-star selections to be, you know, actual stars, instead of those having a good 80 games.  But let's enjoy all-star Josh Harrisonhttps://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/883072595356266498
882616543317815296 2017-07-05 15:05:56 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls @bhole1980 ah - I understand now. Good - I can agree with you then :)
882606965922439169 2017-07-05 14:27:53 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls @bhole1980 Underdog? For 1 1/2 seasons now, Ramirez has been the superior player. It's not really even that close. I love Sano but that's just facts.
882070979329052672 2017-07-03 02:58:04 UTC <BK432> However the runs come in, we will take them. #MNTwins
882068024114761733 2017-07-03 02:46:19 UTC <BK432> Jack, if that was a breaking ball I'll eat my hat.  That was a 92 MPH meatball down the middle of the plate.
882067148281188352 2017-07-03 02:42:50 UTC <BK432> I don't want to overreact, but man, Buxton makes that looks routine. And it was far from it.
882064109608595457 2017-07-03 02:30:46 UTC <BK432> #MinnesotaMade and extremely good. Partial to the rye whiskey myself but it's all very, very good.https://twitter.com/JCarverSpirits/status/882062026784112641
882062081708654592 2017-07-03 02:22:42 UTC <BK432> @BaseballPirate would have been him or Kepler. Technically yes but it was Kepler's error.
882061493231128576 2017-07-03 02:20:22 UTC <BK432> 100% this. Reporters don't have to cite sources - we as a society have fought for and won that right for them. Defend the free press.https://twitter.com/heelsonthefield/status/882061150229336069
882060791721189377 2017-07-03 02:17:35 UTC <BK432> Incredible swing by Sano. Bona fide star for the Twins. This core is super fun to watch most nights.
882060059236323328 2017-07-03 02:14:40 UTC <BK432> You gotta fight "facts" with facts.https://twitter.com/mschlegel34/status/882059920211722240
882059159847542784 2017-07-03 02:11:06 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls eh, by nearly every metric Ramirez has been superior. I love Sano but Ramirez has been unreal.
882048799077695489 2017-07-03 01:29:56 UTC <BK432> I dream of a Twitter where @ ing people to make fun of their opinions didn't exist.
882045362739060736 2017-07-03 01:16:16 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne especially with guys on. He just doesn't trust his stuff with men on, it looks to me at least.
882044377945833472 2017-07-03 01:12:21 UTC <BK432> That was a double because of the high wall?  I have no idea what Bremer is smoking. That hit like 4 feet up on the wall.
882040079803441152 2017-07-03 00:55:17 UTC <BK432> 106 MPH EV from Mauer - that has to be among his hardest hit.
882036952106717184 2017-07-03 00:42:51 UTC <BK432> That was insanely close. Great play and throw by Kole.
881988915649024001 2017-07-03 21:31:58 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls and it shouldn't matter - Sano will make team too
881988644193673216 2017-07-03 21:30:53 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls Ramirez is a better selection
881715187962847237 2017-07-02 03:24:16 UTC <BK432> I can understand the concern - it's real. But 13 Reasons Why is a fantastic watch. Season 1 was absolutely amazing. Highly recommended.
881356721385558016 2017-07-01 03:39:51 UTC <BK432> Taylor Rogers has been a godsend for this bullpen. He looks very tough to hit.
880985029786128384 2017-06-30 03:02:53 UTC <BK432> Has anyone else looked at Oswaldo Arcia's AAA numbers with Arizona? Wow....  http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=10306&position=OF
880979842568683520 2017-06-30 02:42:16 UTC <BK432> You wanna not be generalized by this crap? Then police each other #Milwaukeehttps://apnews.com/13dab2b582d94c25b2c0357fd273632d
880622772384399364 2017-06-29 03:03:24 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yeah, this hasn't gone well at all.....
880622005091016704 2017-06-29 03:00:21 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls yeah, exactly. My mom of all people brought that up tonight. Ridiculous.
880594800306728966 2017-06-29 01:12:15 UTC <BK432> Heard Pat Benatar's "Heartbreaker" today. Just like everything else in life it made me think of "Seinfeld".https://youtu.be/YTcZ9THPX1E
880467160363126784 2017-06-29 16:45:03 UTC <BK432> I mean, I think I'm afraid of the answer. But seriously, if you support this President, I simply struggle to understand.
880466395238207488 2017-06-29 16:42:01 UTC <BK432> I will not be retweeting Trump's disgusting Mika tweet from this AM.  My only question is, is this the level of comportment we expect?

878783962491039744 2017-06-24 01:16:38 UTC <BK432> @TCFBankStadium @gottlightmpls really???
878456127142453249 2017-06-23 03:33:56 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @Plouffe24Fan Grossman should not be losing any ABs. The dude is an OBP machine.
878455896694812672 2017-06-23 03:33:01 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @Plouffe24Fan I agree with this. It's Escobar or Adrianza. But Granite probably doesn't come up until there's an OF injury to be honest.
878452684227059712 2017-06-23 03:20:15 UTC <BK432> FELIPE RIVERO JUST WALKED ERIC FRYER IN THE 9TH WITH A 1-RUN LEAD.....
878444865956327424 2017-06-23 02:49:11 UTC <BK432> That was a pro's pro play by Dansby on that two-hop smash, getting the lead runner at 3rd. Well done, kid.
878438150808510464 2017-06-23 02:22:30 UTC <BK432> Love that from Hildenberger. Nice inning and the Twins win in a shutout. Would love them to win the next two as payback as well.
878438009837953025 2017-06-23 02:21:56 UTC <BK432> Zack Granite is ridiculous. Not sure how much longer the Twins can wait.https://twitter.com/SethTweets/status/878437352754077696
878436461556760576 2017-06-23 02:15:47 UTC <BK432> That's the pitch that can make him some money.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/878436382267629571
878435933506482180 2017-06-23 02:13:41 UTC <BK432> Very excited to see @t_hildy pitch in his debut. I think he'll stick in this 'pen.

878403300244291584 2017-06-23 00:04:01 UTC <BK432> That's why Mejia still is tantalizing. Those last two pitches. 94 MPH heat and then a nasty slider.

878081797262893057 2017-06-22 02:46:29 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 Hopefully it works out. I'd love a reason to go to Target Center again.
878056306481016832 2017-06-22 01:05:11 UTC <BK432> I don't have the NBA knowledge I once did, but I'm scratching my head wondering how the package Wolves offered got a top 10-15 player. Wow.
877902508466868224 2017-06-22 14:54:03 UTC <BK432> Love this - I had been wondering and was too lazy to look for myself.https://twitter.com/mschlegel34/status/877901753055932416

877723526492549122 2017-06-21 03:02:50 UTC <BK432> @hlrule ah. Thank you - I'm am often ignorant to these things.

877722767382110210 2017-06-21 02:59:49 UTC <BK432> Berrios has been filthy from inning 4 on. I'd feel a lot better leaving him out there for the 9th if Twins can score one more run.....
877350427066593281 2017-06-20 02:20:16 UTC <BK432> @amykjensen very true on this

876805162056265732 2017-06-19 14:13:35 UTC <BK432> Well-written. I certainly am not sure Granite is an upgrade over Rosario, but more and more, OBP is life.https://twitter.com/TwinkieTown/status/876801769262731267
876626160603586560 2017-06-18 02:22:18 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man Nope - and look, we're not far away from each other. And I hope you're closer to right than I am.
876624772414791680 2017-06-18 02:16:47 UTC <BK432> this is a team with a bright future - but it isn't quite here yet. Our time is coming, keep the faith y'all...
876624558509490176 2017-06-18 02:15:56 UTC <BK432> if you viewed them otherwise that's fine, but don't drag me along; I'm not going to go jumping on the complain train.
876624368012546048 2017-06-18 02:15:10 UTC <BK432> I think there's 2 groups of Twins fans. I was/am part of the group that viewed them ALWAYS as a 78ish win team off to a good start.
876571308871622656 2017-06-18 22:44:20 UTC <BK432> Isn't it awesome to remember how many fantastic and incredible people live amongst us?pic.twitter.com/AaKwaJoS4S

876184380070297601 2017-06-17 21:06:49 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert horrible baseball takes. I like his perspective as an ex player, but I don't need to hear his front office thoughts
876184159269662720 2017-06-17 21:05:56 UTC <BK432> Now Dan Gladden is saying that exit velocity is overrated. I need none of this.

876152498360373250 2017-06-17 19:00:08 UTC <BK432> I pray that Dan Gladden never has access to a general manager with the Minnesota Twins. Ever.
876121726731550720 2017-06-17 16:57:51 UTC <BK432> @bennyc50 was probably my nephew. Seriously. Big dude in his 20s?  In any case I keep telling him to get a new job....

875508077717487616 2017-06-15 00:19:26 UTC <BK432> One man's opinion but it feels real good to readhttp://m.mlb.com/news/article/236553468/twins-used-no-1-pick-to-have-best-2017-draft/

875470594187382786 2017-06-15 21:50:29 UTC <BK432> @AbbottHospital In the NICU it was all about Leo. But Lisa stayed admitted for another 9 days after birth until all parties were ready to discharge.
875470427694542849 2017-06-15 21:49:50 UTC <BK432> As for us, @AbbottHospital was incredible in 2012 for us. Fought for 2 weeks to reduce hypertension and put Lisa first in maternal ward.
875470021555834880 2017-06-15 21:48:13 UTC <BK432> In any event, this is an excellent long-form story. Highly encourage you all to read it.https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system

874996523955834880 2017-06-14 14:26:42 UTC <BK432> Scalise shooting is despicable. Glad no one's life is in danger, but those responsible deserve everything they get.

874825577798283264 2017-06-13 03:07:25 UTC <BK432> Twins still have a chance at 30 hits if the Mariners hang 14 or more on the bullpen in the 9th.  So, probably 50/50.....
874825344448180224 2017-06-13 03:06:30 UTC <BK432> @ChrisGimenez5 @mattkummer dude needs a day off!

874818711336751106 2017-06-13 02:40:08 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin that's one way. Facebook stalking is another....
874818460408320001 2017-06-13 02:39:08 UTC <BK432> This is ridiculous. Nice to see the Twins on this side of one for once.
874470211197521925 2017-06-12 03:35:19 UTC <BK432> Kevin Durant is the best player on the Warriors. By quite a bit, actually.
874460388003282945 2017-06-12 02:56:17 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 that's fair. I kinda did too. I hope they both crush it.
874460072298119169 2017-06-12 02:55:02 UTC <BK432> Listen, I get that the MLB draft is way different from NFL/NBA. But the Viking fan bozos with an opinion tonight are driving me crazy.
874429318927192064 2017-06-12 00:52:50 UTC <BK432> @Dave_Schwartz @storm_chaser82 deal would have already been worked out before pick. No guesswork needed now.
874428873315930113 2017-06-12 00:51:04 UTC <BK432> These people would have been mad regardless of who was taken. Ripping the Twins is a simply a hobby for them. No need for facts.https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/874422949532585984
874101848445202438 2017-06-11 03:11:35 UTC <BK432> I tend to give fans a break, but the amount of boos from Nashville's fans is kinda bothersome. Show some class, Tennessee.

871915478125596673 2017-06-05 02:23:44 UTC <BK432> @BengalBrian keep writing your own narrative. That's fine. I've read your other tweets. I know you love Trump. Be you. I'll be me. I wish you well, sir.
871914450558869504 2017-06-05 02:19:39 UTC <BK432> @BengalBrian Ha. "Violence proclamation." You knew what I meant. You're now blocked for a snowflake hyperbolic statement. No time for that, snowflake.
871913896470343682 2017-06-05 02:17:26 UTC <BK432> @BengalBrian and you choose to believe Donald Trump. So there you go.
871913330960732160 2017-06-05 02:15:12 UTC <BK432> @BengalBrian you're sure as hell right I'm politically motivated! I'm a part of the PISSED OFF electorate that will make 2018 a bloodbath.
871909719526584321 2017-06-05 02:00:51 UTC <BK432> @BengalBrian Well, I could ask you the same question. Who do you believe? Your answer will say a lot about your character, but it's your choice.
871908246067576834 2017-06-05 01:54:59 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @Lkummer and I saw "American Idiot" on Broadway several years ago. Billie Joe was there too. It was incredible.

871907220421738497 2017-06-05 01:50:55 UTC <BK432> The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie.  Billie Joe Armstrong sang it 13 years ago and it's still true today.
871900704893526016 2017-06-05 01:25:01 UTC <BK432> Well, he knows it's over so he's just holding a Twitter campaign rally now. It's really fucking pathetic.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871899511525961728
871895777450356738 2017-06-05 01:05:27 UTC <BK432> @RickCarpiniello @Slappy002 LOL. Nah, I don't think so.

871556676490592256 2017-06-04 02:37:59 UTC <BK432> When Golden State is interested, I don't know how they're beaten. Incredible squad.
871548756843528193 2017-06-04 02:06:30 UTC <BK432> The Warriors are an all-time team. They've changed basketball.

871511357736267776 2017-06-04 23:37:54 UTC <BK432> @realchriswebber I know the before feeling very well, and the after. It's so emotional, but now you can pour that love into the kids. Happy for you. Congrats
871499971958366208 2017-06-04 22:52:39 UTC <BK432> Boom. 3 of 4 for the #MNTwins. I saw exactly one out, Revere's SB and pickoff. But that alone made me happy. Twins stopped the slide.
871364735287128066 2017-06-04 13:55:16 UTC <BK432> Good for Mayor Khan. Trump continues to be a monumental embarrassment to our nation.https://twitter.com/MattChorley/status/871361532126429184
870844791155814400 2017-06-02 03:29:12 UTC <BK432> Incredible plays aside, it's the positioning, the preparation and routinely doing the little things well that makes 2017 so different.
870844520715497477 2017-06-02 03:28:07 UTC <BK432> I'm not saying this simply because of that play. But the defense has made this Twins team so much more fun to watch.
870844132079669249 2017-06-02 03:26:35 UTC <BK432> That was an incredible play by Mauer. Wow.
870839341328871424 2017-06-02 03:07:33 UTC <BK432> I think we have a large enough sample size to say this: Robbie Grossman is a good MLB hitter.  Pinch me.  #MNTwins

870048086697050112 2017-05-31 22:43:23 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne OMG barf.  I assume he meant Herrera but I would disown the Twins for such a trade
870031836675796993 2017-05-31 21:38:48 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer he was
869692717764403200 2017-05-30 23:11:16 UTC <BK432> God bless you @DanBarreiroKFAN. Protect the extra innings.
868917328901230592 2017-05-28 19:50:09 UTC <BK432> Not a lot of guys could get thrown out on that but a very nice playhttps://twitter.com/SethTweets/status/868917044401582081

868903158852046848 2017-05-28 18:53:51 UTC <BK432> That inning was better but in general it is so frustrating to witness Kyle Gibson s pitching
868689894230687746 2017-05-27 04:46:24 UTC <BK432> Done with season 1 of @BrockmireIFC. Highly, highly, highly recommended.
868440036089487360 2017-05-27 12:13:34 UTC <BK432> Media is anti-Trump? For shit's sake, the clicks they must be getting.

868276613233999872 2017-05-26 01:24:11 UTC <BK432> Hector Santiago sure has gotten a lot of outs on the warning track.

868275695121727488 2017-05-26 01:20:32 UTC <BK432> It does suck that this is against the Twins, but it is really fun to watch Chris Archer pitch.
868269910274838530 2017-05-26 00:57:32 UTC <BK432> Hey @andrewhelmers I'm proud to say that I am the inspiration for this @fangraphs by Melichar.  http://www.fangraphs.com/community/should-you-be-buying-into-zack-cozart/

867939950129430528 2017-05-25 03:06:24 UTC <BK432> Hockey is far from my favorite sport. But Game 7 OT to go to the Stanley Cup is as thrilling as sports gets. Hockey is amazing.

867933661940903940 2017-05-25 02:41:25 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood But no seriously, Montana has big cities?
867933557209145345 2017-05-25 02:41:00 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood Its a great bit going back several years among Twins fans :)  I actually used to own a t-shirt that read #ItsHappening. I think I outgrew it

867863038258446336 2017-05-25 22:00:47 UTC <BK432> @rcglanzer damn if that ain't the truth. Kinda scary, actually
867861440543285248 2017-05-25 21:54:26 UTC <BK432> Deals for guys like Jake Odorizzi interest me lots more. You still have to give up a strong piece, but could be more palatable
867861191389057024 2017-05-25 21:53:26 UTC <BK432> The future is still the future for this team, 2018 and beyond. Don't mortgage important pieces for 2017, as tempting as that is.
867861009150746625 2017-05-25 21:52:43 UTC <BK432> Talk of Cueto and/or Archer being available is intriguing, but I'm not sold that's the kind of trade Falvey/Levine should be making
867860747841392640 2017-05-25 21:51:41 UTC <BK432> Lots of fun talk on this off day about SPs the #MNTwins could target now or nearer deadline. I have thoughts, of course...

867548779376979968 2017-05-24 01:12:01 UTC <BK432> @joe_sheehan @mattkummer @donnelly612 or limit the # of pitchers on an active roster, have inactives, etc. Too easy for managers to keep putting out guys who throw 98

867514414412517377 2017-05-24 22:55:28 UTC <BK432> You all go on and worry about drugs, length of game, etc if you want. But you're missing the big issue. (h/t @joe_sheehan)pic.twitter.com/AmRcIiIi4q

867466052912992256 2017-05-24 19:43:18 UTC <BK432> You can't stop these Twins. 7 games over .500.  Pack a lunch, our squad is going to be relevant for quite some time.

866858231460704258 2017-05-22 03:28:02 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man it's an impossible argument. The league was smaller then. But it was such a different league too.  I just think they belong in that group.
866857532459028480 2017-05-22 03:25:15 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man Fran, don't be the "back in my day" guy. I'm almost 40, I remember and celebrate the 90s Bulls. I think I'd side with them.  But GS is legit
866856918723305472 2017-05-22 03:22:49 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man that's a different argument, Fran.

866021256650534912 2017-05-20 20:02:12 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan Not worth the effort. Some people are literally incapable of not letting their emotions cloud what they read/hear.

866007575543918592 2017-05-20 19:07:50 UTC <BK432> Serious question: is it normal in fastpitch to throw over 160 pitches with no relief pitcher?

864241633298141187 2017-05-15 22:10:36 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg proud to know you, Mike.
864238633091571712 2017-05-15 21:58:41 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg Mike Herring? Kidding - love the pickled herring.
864238473498300416 2017-05-15 21:58:03 UTC <BK432> @FLOWknight2 The Jai Alai is a wonderful beer. Proud of you.
863584575527690240 2017-05-13 02:39:42 UTC <BK432> So, my 4 year old did this today off a dock with a kiddie pole, hook and a worm.  I do believe that fish sometimes seek to make kids happy.pic.twitter.com/k5NR6Me0TY
863583324387680256 2017-05-13 02:34:43 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert I deserve it? OK - yes, I'll go with that. I deserve it!! :)

863216673070866434 2017-05-12 02:17:47 UTC <BK432> 1-zip victory gets the Twins to 18-14. If nothing else, this is so much more fun to watch than last year.
862887048310661120 2017-05-11 04:27:58 UTC <BK432> This COULD be true which is way more fun than the last few years already.https://twitter.com/NickNelsonMN/status/862886738242539520

862886215313391616 2017-05-11 04:24:40 UTC <BK432> If the season ended today, Twins go to Camden Yards to start the playoffs #EternalHope

861381947989340160 2017-05-07 00:47:14 UTC <BK432> Forecast low tonight is 43 degrees. That's the coldest low temp forecasted in the next 15 days. #ItHasSprung

860701365345165312 2017-05-05 03:42:51 UTC <BK432> I'm not the first to say it....Mauer's peripherals and secondary stats have been screaming this season. Could have more of this ahead of him
860699556576624641 2017-05-05 03:35:39 UTC <BK432> Wow wow wow.
860699429778620418 2017-05-05 03:35:09 UTC <BK432> What. The Hell. Just happened.
860699210290794496 2017-05-05 03:34:17 UTC <BK432> He can't go back down. He's been way too damn good.https://twitter.com/MLB/status/860699010805501952

860593815144587266 2017-05-05 20:35:29 UTC <BK432> Indeed they did. Not surprising. More interesting is Drew Rucinski - I didn't even know who he was??  AAA peripherals look decent, however.https://twitter.com/mattkummer/status/860589642630000640
860298147259703296 2017-05-04 01:00:36 UTC <BK432> @StarTribune @RepFreiberg Great letter and go Joe!
860266526582112256 2017-05-04 22:54:57 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer probably not. I was at the game today. Gibby was brutal. If it was ever going to happen, now's the time.
860248216780013568 2017-05-04 21:42:12 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert like we were saying...
859972949184585728 2017-05-03 03:28:23 UTC <BK432> Ah yes, thank you Trevor Plouffe.
859966818542342144 2017-05-03 03:04:01 UTC <BK432> Sano rightly sat on the first pitch there. Just slightly got under it. Man....
859955281140342784 2017-05-03 02:18:10 UTC <BK432> THAT'S the bunt you're going to take issue with Bert? Seriously?

859954630159204353 2017-05-03 02:15:35 UTC <BK432> Rosario hits the 9 ball with his pool cue and Twins lead 7-3.
859950728173027328 2017-05-03 02:00:05 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin the odd time for my job that an org will only take something via fax drives me into fits of anger and depression.
859948644442800130 2017-05-03 01:51:48 UTC <BK432> @TCAnelle it's the KFAN parrots who think they're funny. I mean I like KFAN somewhat but it's those who take it as gospel that drive me crazy.
859947263988301824 2017-05-03 01:46:19 UTC <BK432> Nice lil play at 1B by Mauer. He's had a pretty good season there so far in 2017.
859930066498854917 2017-05-03 00:37:59 UTC <BK432> I may have tried Davis' arm on that fly ball but it's no slam dunk. Oh well. 2-zip after 1. #MNTwins
859897693556101120 2017-05-03 22:29:20 UTC <BK432> @thrylos98 clearly my reading comprehension is pretty shitty today. Thanks. That's real ugly and confirms what Ive always thought: a return is unlikely
859896525945802752 2017-05-03 22:24:42 UTC <BK432> @thrylos98 ah - was in March but still. That's not encouraging.
859893958603886592 2017-05-03 22:14:30 UTC <BK432> @thrylos98 eesh - that's not good. Where did you see 78 MPH?

859600354396299264 2017-05-02 02:47:49 UTC <BK432> If "it's always been that way" is your best reason to justify inaction, you have a terrible argument. That's a universal truth.
859599701632593920 2017-05-02 02:45:14 UTC <BK432> @pond7 that's a horrible reason not to do something about it. At one time slavery was legal because "it always has been".
859599128422219777 2017-05-02 02:42:57 UTC <BK432> @MLB @pond7 it's childish, dangerous and moronic. I don't care what team you root for.
859599045236576256 2017-05-02 02:42:37 UTC <BK432> @MLB @pond7 LOL homer glasses - I'm not a fan of either team. Guessing you can't say the same.  We should all be mad about ANY guy getting thrown at.
859597378432663552 2017-05-02 02:36:00 UTC <BK432> @MLB we suspend guys 80 games for taking homer pills, but we allow guys to throw a hard object 100 MPH at a defenseless guy 53 feet away?
859597110127337472 2017-05-02 02:34:56 UTC <BK432> Wow Manny Machado was mad tonight. And he really should be.  @MLB is it going to take an awful tragedy to take this issue seriously?
859595366114758656 2017-05-02 02:28:00 UTC <BK432> essentially, he recognized slider after he started his swing load, slowed himself down and got rewarded. Impressive.
859595046294876161 2017-05-02 02:26:44 UTC <BK432> Buxton's shot was impressive. I've watched it a few times now and he actually got out in front a bit but kept his hands back and crushed it.
859594271300747264 2017-05-02 02:23:39 UTC <BK432> Some serious power display tonight for the Twins. This one's Mauer. Wow.
859582748301905921 2017-05-02 01:37:52 UTC <BK432> I just watched Sano's mammoth shot. Lost in all that was some lady got plunked on the face it looked like. Ouch.
859577846796353539 2017-05-02 01:18:23 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 I had to look it up - off Felipe Paulino.

857407627587977217 2017-04-26 01:34:42 UTC <BK432> BBux just looks like a different hitter the last 5 games or so. Settling in and getting the ball in play.
857398393253089283 2017-04-26 00:58:01 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne @spikebillyb @SethTweets and what exactly do you want the Twins and/or Mauer to do about that?
857335371608338434 2017-04-26 20:47:35 UTC <BK432> Are there really people celebrating people's job loss? Glad I haven't seen anything - that is sickness of nearly the highest degree.
857239341105598464 2017-04-26 14:26:00 UTC <BK432> Strongly recommend this read on a kid that will most likely be drafted by the Twins in June.https://twitter.com/NoDakTwinsFan/status/857236256882929669
857052154439376898 2017-04-25 02:02:11 UTC <BK432> Well....that was a nice little inning. #MNTwins
857035120758456321 2017-04-25 00:54:30 UTC <BK432> Yeah, Andrew Cashner is not very good these days. Twins need to make him pay.https://twitter.com/LaVelleNeal/status/857034725466284032
857034784492703744 2017-04-25 00:53:10 UTC <BK432> Pudge on the FSN broadcast - nice break from the norm.
856835809663733760 2017-04-25 11:42:30 UTC <BK432> @Taylor_Callais Ugh, I completely agree. I just roll my eyes every time I hear it.

855639222941884416 2017-04-21 04:27:42 UTC <BK432> Now I'm into old stuff and it's super easy to forget how good @facetofacemusic's 'Big Choice' album was. Holy shit.

855621419207675904 2017-04-21 03:16:57 UTC <BK432> @LVLUPBAND is amazing. Glad I decided to check out some new music - lots of good stuff out there.
855619167675973633 2017-04-21 03:08:00 UTC <BK432> @_SuperMike ha - I actually know the Chainsmokers. They ain't no Radiohead.
855619065209028608 2017-04-21 03:07:36 UTC <BK432> And man, Maren Morris. I'm probably way late on all this, but holy crap that was good.
855613944446283777 2017-04-21 02:47:15 UTC <BK432> Back to back new artists to me....Car Seat Headrest is intriguing.
855613172354605056 2017-04-21 02:44:11 UTC <BK432> Watching #MNTwins and doing some new music listening. My first aha? Chance The Rapper's stuff is pretty damn amazing.
855607908637319168 2017-04-21 02:23:16 UTC <BK432> Wow! #MNTwins showing some fight here! Battled Verlander out of the game and now a 6-run 6th.
855594109322612736 2017-04-21 01:28:26 UTC <BK432> Verlander looks ridiculously filthy out there. Gonna be tough to do much off him at all.

855587210208456706 2017-04-21 01:01:01 UTC <BK432> I'm admittedly about as pro-player as you can get, but man, it's like MLB guys aren't supposed to do anything but play ball and sleep.
855586362673827840 2017-04-21 00:57:39 UTC <BK432> We just love to judge 27-year-old dudes for riding a dirt bike, don't we?  Can't possibly have empathy, gotta judge everyone #amirite?
855585344082911232 2017-04-21 00:53:36 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets Well, my son's been climbing all over me the last inning and a half, but my general impression is positive! Lots of personal to add.
855572607558709248 2017-04-21 00:03:00 UTC <BK432> This is a @toriihunter48 game in the booth tonight?!? Sweet, can't wait.

853447319987122176 2017-04-15 03:17:52 UTC <BK432> Awful news. Was wondering what was going on here.http://www.startribune.com/pedestrian-struck-killed-in-plymouth/419541453/
853408470791598081 2017-04-15 00:43:29 UTC <BK432> @Dave_Schwartz I love the Common Man, but other people trying to basically do his shtick on Twitter really bores me.
853081682538377218 2017-04-14 03:04:57 UTC <BK432> Outfield defense is going to keep this team competitive past the all-star break.

853075881136357376 2017-04-14 02:41:54 UTC <BK432> Dare I say, 2 minutes of 4 on 4 benefits the Wild. Let's get it done.
853074568772243458 2017-04-14 02:36:41 UTC <BK432> That's a stat right there.....https://twitter.com/EvanDrellich/status/853073908655849472
853072030715043840 2017-04-14 02:26:36 UTC <BK432> TOOTBLAN for the Sox, nice little play by Mauer.
853067255835439104 2017-04-14 02:07:37 UTC <BK432> @thrylos98 good luck with that :) :) :)
853062819083948032 2017-04-14 01:49:59 UTC <BK432> I'm not a hockey expert but that was either boarding or a cross-check on Haula, right?
853060066097942528 2017-04-14 01:39:03 UTC <BK432> That's a pretty nice play for Polanco there.
853055734594097153 2017-04-14 01:21:50 UTC <BK432> Jorge has a bat that can play at this level. With his future at 2B, it will take the sting off a bit once Dozier is playing elsewhere.

853049826409369600 2017-04-14 00:58:22 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne Watching him last game and first inning tonight I actually think he has a chance to stick as a mid-rotation starter.
853046542252605441 2017-04-14 00:45:19 UTC <BK432> Wow is this bizarre - 4 year old has been sleeping since 7:15. I don't even know what to do with my time.

852386858222985216 2017-04-12 05:03:58 UTC <BK432> That was totally worth staying up until after midnight.  Wild outplay 'em. But they don't beat 'em.  A win is a win is a win.
852384269116821504 2017-04-12 04:53:40 UTC <BK432> PP for the win, boys.
852375009796534273 2017-04-12 04:16:53 UTC <BK432> Had 2 glasses of wine tonight, just chill - but now I'm forced to consider a late night beer. Trying to resist....
852374516990914560 2017-04-12 04:14:55 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert yeah, but man, they deserved that. I don't say this lightly - they were BY FAR the better team for the first 59 minutes too.
852373992195461120 2017-04-12 04:12:50 UTC <BK432> My lord, it took 44 shots.

852361350257012736 2017-04-12 03:22:36 UTC <BK432> Yeah, outside of 1 save I haven't seen anything spectacular from Allen. Just lots of whiffs and missed chances.https://twitter.com/BMileskiKFAN/status/852361066197770240
852360977022676992 2017-04-12 03:21:07 UTC <BK432> @xdabluesfan yeah, lot of whiffs, near-misses for Wild. More scoring chances. Agree Blues D is playing well but bounces have gone against the Wild.
852359520303054848 2017-04-12 03:15:20 UTC <BK432> Well, it's clear that #MNWild are the better team and outplaying the #stlblues.....but....  Blues 1, Wild 0.
852336420643635200 2017-04-12 01:43:32 UTC <BK432> Go #MNWild....but this is going to be hell to stay awake for.....

851965337113419777 2017-04-11 01:08:59 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer you're loyalty to media and the airline industry blinds you somewhat
851965103981436928 2017-04-11 01:08:04 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer you're making me me into the offended social justice pitchfork nation guy. I'm not that.
851963550545399808 2017-04-11 01:01:53 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer you're missing the point
851963298929139712 2017-04-11 01:00:53 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @BK432 would be similar to high profile rape story and then paper running story on victim's past transgressions.
851963029323436033 2017-04-11 00:59:49 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer again I don't really care that they ran the story, but I just don't understand the relevancy.
851962792290787329 2017-04-11 00:58:53 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I don't understand how your response had anything to do with what I said
851962100520013825 2017-04-11 00:56:08 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah I don't know on that. Story says he got a couple short stories over a decade ago. I think that's a bit overstated.
851931891938865152 2017-04-11 22:56:05 UTC <BK432> Amen. Republican, Democrat, something else, it doesn't matter. We deserve far superior leadership.https://twitter.com/VicenteFoxQue/status/851882181647642624
851931655216533509 2017-04-11 22:55:09 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I just can't for the life of me understand the relevancy, even in the context they gave.  I'm not offended by the story, but I'm puzzled.

851462929497161728 2017-04-10 15:52:36 UTC <BK432> This is insanity at its finest. Curious for your thoughts, @mattkummer ......https://twitter.com/Gizmodo/status/851433557742551044
851461453014065154 2017-04-10 15:46:44 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert he's extremely good, isn't he? He has a long career in front of him in radio/TV if he wants it...
850750031573508096 2017-04-08 16:39:48 UTC <BK432> For your reading enjoyment, today's #MNTwins game thread, started by yours truly on @twinsdailyhttp://twinsdaily.com/topic/25489-game-thread-twins-white-sox-4817-110-pm-ct/
850553455026503681 2017-04-07 03:38:40 UTC <BK432> By the way, I have the honor of writing the Game Thread intro on @twinsdaily tomorrow. Not sure why they let me do it but hey, check it out.
850552587736809473 2017-04-07 03:35:14 UTC <BK432> Can't get over Tyler Duffey's 2 innings tonight. I mean, he looked goddamn electric. If Twins stay relevant he could be a huge plus.
850550904038322176 2017-04-07 03:28:32 UTC <BK432> Russell Westbrook is revolutionary. First since the Big O to have triple-double season averages. That is astounding.
850546406670688256 2017-04-07 03:10:40 UTC <BK432> My lord, thank you Jacob May.
850541636597817344 2017-04-07 02:51:43 UTC <BK432> Gave no indication but yeah, seems like he's a multi-inning, high-leverage guy right off the bat. Looks great.https://twitter.com/NickNelsonMN/status/850541378501320704
850541011889795073 2017-04-07 02:49:14 UTC <BK432> Hmmm......3 inning save, anyone? Tyler Duffey looking absolutely FILTHY.
850540554349924352 2017-04-07 02:47:25 UTC <BK432> That wasn't a bad pitch to Melky. Feeling okay here with Duffey.
850539089191477248 2017-04-07 02:41:35 UTC <BK432> @fsnorth @donnelly612 that's hilarious - I don't know how you miss a new pitcher.....
850538922216214532 2017-04-07 02:40:55 UTC <BK432> With Jones and Putnam in there, I don't know why Sox didn't move Robertson in the offseason. He's almost sure to move by the deadline.
850538208156930048 2017-04-07 02:38:05 UTC <BK432> It's really bothering me that @fsnorth still has Nate Jones' pitch count going instead of Putnam's
850530403467370496 2017-04-07 02:07:04 UTC <BK432> Sheesh. Well, it goes in the books as a 6 IP, 1 R QS for Hughes. Always an adventure.  Assuming it's the pen's game for the last 3 innings.
850529925958389761 2017-04-07 02:05:11 UTC <BK432> Just as it's always been - OF defense is perhaps the most underrated factor in how a team performs. Twins look good so far in 2017.https://twitter.com/Twins/status/850529386377773056
850528391099035648 2017-04-07 01:59:05 UTC <BK432> I know he's at 73 pitches to start the inning, but after 20 hitters or so I have very little trust in Phil Hughes. Short leash, please.
850515908124606464 2017-04-07 01:09:28 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer it's a legit concern. But for those calling for a trip to AAA, it's been 3.5 games. I mean, that's not even close to fair.
850514692225339392 2017-04-07 01:04:39 UTC <BK432> But seriously though, Buxton has no idea what he's doing at the plate right now. I thought we were past this.
850512122551447552 2017-04-07 00:54:26 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer could be. Highly paid versus racial minority. It's going to be close.
850510712510271492 2017-04-07 00:48:50 UTC <BK432> @StarTribune @mattkummer that is pretty much quite true
850510361765830657 2017-04-07 00:47:26 UTC <BK432> @StarTribune @mattkummer Replace Surly with any other MN brewer and you get a tepid response.  People hate a successful brewery, I guess.
850509672838778880 2017-04-07 00:44:42 UTC <BK432> @StarTribune @mattkummer I mean, see any Surly article ever, but here's the most recent one: http://www.startribune.com/surly-will-introduce-12-ounce-cans/418567883/  Or this one:http://www.startribune.com/surly-goes-down-vote-in-the-ultimate-minnesota-beer-bracket-foamy-four/417126353/
850506164714573828 2017-04-07 00:30:45 UTC <BK432> Everyone who is complaining about Buxton at the plate can screw off. He'll get there. For now, that D!
850463892698431489 2017-04-07 21:42:47 UTC <BK432> @JRMahoney22 love the Roth conversion.
850456308306386948 2017-04-07 21:12:39 UTC <BK432> This is where it would be nice to have another RH bat available instead of a 13th pitcher.......https://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/850451458432663552
850447044342943744 2017-04-07 20:35:50 UTC <BK432> This is insane. If only there was some sort of medicine kids could be given to prevent catching such an illness.....https://twitter.com/NPR/status/850445828418187264
850404198344790017 2017-04-07 17:45:35 UTC <BK432> Forget the Twins and Obama....not sure there's a better instigator of comment wars on @StarTribune than a story on Surly Brewing.
850375079741591560 2017-04-07 15:49:52 UTC <BK432> Big news - my favorite site and my favorite writer teaming up. This is awesome!  @joe_sheehan @fangraphshttps://twitter.com/schwartzstops/status/850373059513118720
850310390491873280 2017-04-07 11:32:49 UTC <BK432> I'm going to go 85% just to be safe. No price is too high to pay for the next Trout.https://twitter.com/sporer/status/850141736097775621
850082690112131080 2017-04-06 20:28:01 UTC <BK432> At 0-9 to start a season you feel like you get robbed of a season of hope for your team.  That's why 3-0 feels so good  #ThisYearIsDifferent

849719352446398464 2017-04-05 20:24:15 UTC <BK432> #MNTwins are +14 in run differential, which currently leads MLB.  Which is not meaningful. But it is fun.
849719059633639425 2017-04-05 20:23:05 UTC <BK432> Good win for the squad today. Offense looking good, Twins pitchers doing a good job preventing runs.
849715677837635584 2017-04-05 20:09:39 UTC <BK432> Well, if that's how BBux's first hit of 2017 had to come, I guess you have to take it.
849709116599783425 2017-04-05 19:43:34 UTC <BK432> Pitchers are going to have to start throwing Mauer strikes at some point.
849709013503758337 2017-04-05 19:43:10 UTC <BK432> Mauer with the great at-bat to load  the bases, Sano clears the bases.  That's how this was all set up.
849697027084701697 2017-04-05 18:55:32 UTC <BK432> Man, who was THIS Hector Santiago?  I'll take this day from him almost every time.  #MNTwins #ThisYearIsDifferent
849684030140424192 2017-04-05 18:03:53 UTC <BK432> No-hitter through 3 for Santiago.  #MNTwins
849673891823964160 2017-04-05 17:23:36 UTC <BK432> Nice first inning from Hector. Let's jump on the Royals early.
849094493055971329 2017-04-03 03:01:17 UTC <BK432> I know I'm not close to the first to say it, but I really don't think the general populace understands how good Mike Trout is. Historic.

848376494888022016 2017-04-01 03:28:13 UTC <BK432> This is pretty incredible.  Don't bet, Tweeps. Well, don't bet badly.https://twitter.com/joe_sheehan/status/848376066066583552
848375779406774272 2017-04-01 03:25:22 UTC <BK432> I wanted Oregon to win but screw that. Glad it's UNC v Zags.
848375651665149952 2017-04-01 03:24:52 UTC <BK432> Sure, miss 4 free throws and Oregon can't even box out. Ridiculous. Go back to Eugene.
848375383586209792 2017-04-01 03:23:48 UTC <BK432> It is amazing how not boxing out can happen at this level.
848367555576291328 2017-04-01 02:52:41 UTC <BK432> Bingo. Spent the entire day outside until the final four started. Incredible, beautiful.https://twitter.com/pdouglasweather/status/848344180204220416
848366983519326208 2017-04-01 02:50:25 UTC <BK432> This Tar Heel team is no joke. Their pressure on both ends of the floor is relentless.
848361472476557312 2017-04-01 02:28:31 UTC <BK432> I'm enjoying this basketball tonight and all, but can't stop thinking/reading/talking about baseball. Can't believe it begins tomorrow.
848353136842596352 2017-04-01 01:55:24 UTC <BK432> @KummerA http://moby.to/memzcm
848331596113604609 2017-04-01 00:29:48 UTC <BK432> That was a really fun game to watch. Hope the 2nd semifinal lives up to it.
848324757158326274 2017-04-01 00:02:37 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man we'll see. Not sure what was going on during those 3-4 minutes.
848324585527406592 2017-04-01 00:01:56 UTC <BK432> And there's the alternative. The young big did not need to put the ball on the ground there. Rebound and go strong to the bucket young fella
848323980670971907 2017-04-01 23:59:32 UTC <BK432> That was one hell of a play. Big fella never brought the ball down. Tough to teach.
848322140818595840 2017-04-01 23:52:14 UTC <BK432> Gamecocks looked absolutely cooked. Now we have a game!

847536393677099008 2017-03-30 19:49:57 UTC <BK432> And let's be honest - this should be a somewhat fun-to-watch 75 or 77 win team as it is. I know last year warped us, but we're not that bad.
847536135027007488 2017-03-30 19:48:55 UTC <BK432> Let's evaluate the 25 and 40 man rosters in October. How have players developed?  I know it sucks but that's what this year is.
847535720285831168 2017-03-30 19:47:16 UTC <BK432> We really shouldn't care so much who is on the 25 man roster on April 3. I know it feels important, but it's so, so not.
847535582590971904 2017-03-30 19:46:43 UTC <BK432> Man, the pissed off Twins fans are out in full force today. I can understand impatience and frustration, but what changed today?
847431208380190720 2017-03-30 12:51:59 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood think so? I'm not sure there's much. His looney base is at least 30% I think
847416468643790848 2017-03-30 11:53:25 UTC <BK432> Why do I get the feeling that 35% of the country will never see this poll?  #AlternativeFactshttps://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/847174131070185472

846686665129316354 2017-03-28 11:33:26 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan holy crap that was a 10 minute dive into another dimension. There's a community for everyone on Twitter.
846556501464502272 2017-03-27 02:56:12 UTC <BK432> Thank you @tom_bigwood for introducing this to my timeline.https://twitter.com/bentolmachoff/status/846476110846017536
846168000940134402 2017-03-26 01:12:27 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man you may have me there! :)
846167013294772224 2017-03-26 01:08:31 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man maybe. They're not the first, won't be the last.
846166803864850433 2017-03-26 01:07:41 UTC <BK432> Oh wow, this is incredible.https://twitter.com/rob_bennett/status/846063256938729472
846166069119254528 2017-03-26 01:04:46 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man \_()_/  I mean, whatever. This is a contrived controversy.
846163912462647300 2017-03-26 00:56:12 UTC <BK432> I mean, you can not like the policy if you want, but employees know the rules and are expected to adhere. Just like any other company rule.
846162910162440192 2017-03-26 00:52:13 UTC <BK432> Is it okay for me, as a liberal, to say this is the dumbest 'scandal' ever?  Lede is buried, they were on passes, dress code enforced.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/846108517136302080
845664235489312769 2017-03-25 15:50:40 UTC <BK432> Probably a pretty played take by late this morning but seriously, who thought there'd be 3 SEC teams in the Elite 8? Wow...
845663935558799363 2017-03-25 15:49:28 UTC <BK432> I should have probably not fallen asleep before the end of Badgers-Gators. Wow what an ending.
845471978299514881 2017-03-24 03:06:42 UTC <BK432> I realize I'm awful but it would make me chuckle to see 1 ACC team, zero BigTen teams and THREE SEC TEAMS in the Elite 8.  #GoGators #GoCats
845461997613387776 2017-03-24 02:27:02 UTC <BK432> @matthewpouliot I mean, shouldn't Mauer be leading off anyway? That seems like the choice that's been missing.

844760008252276738 2017-03-22 03:57:35 UTC <BK432> Well done, @MStrooo6.
844759746708103169 2017-03-22 03:56:33 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer he was alright I thought. 2 outs, then ground ball base hit, pitch got away to hit Hosmer, then pitched well in BB to Cutch.

844749846934441984 2017-03-22 03:17:12 UTC <BK432> Berrios strikes out Stanton, Lucroy and Kinsler. Whoa.
844749343768895488 2017-03-22 03:15:12 UTC <BK432> Nah. We got a 4-zip lead. I like this version quite a bit.https://twitter.com/blessyouboys/status/844749235102867456
844748614245273600 2017-03-22 03:12:18 UTC <BK432> Ha - nice. Berrios just gets the swinging K from Giancarlo  #MNTwins
844746540317130754 2017-03-22 03:04:04 UTC <BK432> Nice play by Brandon Crawford, even if it was Beltran running.

844739574182154241 2017-03-22 02:36:23 UTC <BK432> I disagree with some of Leyland's tactics but I will give him this: he sure seems to do a great job bringing a team together.
844738697253806085 2017-03-22 02:32:54 UTC <BK432> Possibly is a key word here, but lots of smoke. Worth following.https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/844703456136974337
844737733063036928 2017-03-22 02:29:04 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls yes, philosophies have flipped some between then and now, very true.

844403917752586240 2017-03-21 04:22:36 UTC <BK432> USA!  Gregerson was pure nasty in the 9th.

844393971434573827 2017-03-21 03:43:05 UTC <BK432> All I was thinking was don't swing at the first pitch, Adam.  And then he does.  And then, PHEW.
844393710850916354 2017-03-21 03:42:03 UTC <BK432> That was a meatball and a half...Kinsler kind of hit it too square. Man. Let's get a run home. #WBC
844379897392959488 2017-03-21 02:47:10 UTC <BK432> He was pretty clearly out when watching live. Not sure what the 1B ump was looking at.
844374049887326208 2017-03-21 02:23:55 UTC <BK432> Cutch is clutch.

844181302094036992 2017-03-21 13:38:01 UTC <BK432> Jurickson Profar didn't exactly have the game of his life last night. That throw from CF....yikes.
844023149750636545 2017-03-20 03:09:34 UTC <BK432> Great relay, great tag, great call by the ump. Excellent baseball.
844022548321001472 2017-03-20 03:07:11 UTC <BK432> Did I hear that right? It's "Analytics'" fault that Wladimir Balentien isn't on an MLB team?  What a lazy, stupid thing to say.

842352741989117952 2017-03-16 12:31:58 UTC <BK432> TFW when you gag multiple times and almost throw up because of what the previous person did in the airplane bathroom. Yowza.

835575936250691584 2017-02-25 19:43:22 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer all I know is, watching this inning, we won't win 50 games! This is pathetic. Check into the old folks home, Vogelsong.  :)
835571443874279426 2017-02-25 19:25:31 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah, but you're the one who JUST SAID process > results. And you're right!  These games mean almost nothing.

835563319570354177 2017-02-25 18:53:14 UTC <BK432> @mschlegel34 I agree, he's a pretty bad AAAA player. We won't see much of him with the Twins.
835562958986096640 2017-02-25 18:51:48 UTC <BK432> This is just so damn fun, watching a little Red-Sox v Twins. I've been glued to my TV the first 3 innings despite a 'B' lineup from Minny.

835482446913236992 2017-02-25 13:31:52 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood all 3 have potential for breakout years as AL pitchers. Especially James Paxton. Man I love him. I'm still in mourning...

834942873527255040 2017-02-23 01:47:48 UTC <BK432> @FLOWknight2 that has a good ring to it
834938518669524992 2017-02-23 01:30:29 UTC <BK432> Starting to see NO ACCUMULATION forecasts for much of Twin Cities, including Plymouth.  This storm. What a disappointment.
834806792253210624 2017-02-23 16:47:03 UTC <BK432> FWIW my @wunderground forecast never bought hype on snowfall in NW metro. Went as high as 5 inches in last 2 days. Now forecasting an inch.
834805465880076289 2017-02-23 16:41:47 UTC <BK432> Bummed on what that means for snow totals in NW metro but fascinating.
834805361777504256 2017-02-23 16:41:22 UTC <BK432> I love meteorology, very interested observer. So I don't know much, but man, the shift in storm track on this snow seems pretty rare.

834606512282669056 2017-02-22 03:31:13 UTC <BK432> Wow. Yeah, you can lock up a NCAA bid at this point. Would hope they can still win a couple more league games.https://twitter.com/APkrawczynski/status/834606167196389376
834602868141391875 2017-02-22 03:16:44 UTC <BK432> Wow. Go @GopherMBB. This is very impressive. They have completely taken over in the last 6-7 minutes.
834599185517277184 2017-02-22 03:02:06 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 oh yeah for sure. I've already set my schedule to allow for it if needed, as I'm sure you did the same. Very nice.
834585074020519936 2017-02-22 02:06:02 UTC <BK432> Near as I can tell we are going to get 1 to 24 inches of snow in Plymouth. Man I dont envy the weather people with a storm as fickle as this
834488182213398528 2017-02-22 19:41:01 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @mattkummer but you started off by saying, definitively, Wild have no chance. Do you see the difference in the nuance?
834487832660045824 2017-02-22 19:39:37 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @mattkummer I would say the more rational argument too. I never disagreed with premise that Hawks were formidable & could stop Wild

830241541201485824 2017-02-10 02:26:23 UTC <BK432> Pretty bad power play for 90 seconds but then Wild do what they need to do! Nino with the PPG!!!

828445230332571648 2017-02-05 03:28:29 UTC <BK432> Tom Brady will now go down as the greatest ever, if he wasn't already.  The greatest ever.
828444704710807552 2017-02-05 03:26:24 UTC <BK432> He's in. TD. For Vikings fans, it's kind of incredible that that happened to the Falcons, the team of our '98 nightmares.
828441459246395392 2017-02-05 03:13:30 UTC <BK432> God I wish the drop kick was still a play.

827607638275977216 2017-02-03 20:00:11 UTC <BK432> I don't understand this logic. Total remaining cost on contract is $9M. He's not clearing waivers. https://twitter.com/LaVelleNeal/status/827595931533058049
827593871542611968 2017-02-03 19:05:29 UTC <BK432> I hate this move by the Twins. Hate it.  I'm fine signing Belisle but just DFA Danny Santana. Or Tonkin. Or Boshers.
827592989375606784 2017-02-03 19:01:59 UTC <BK432> I don't understand why it's assumed that Park will clear waivers. $9M is pennies in MLB 2017.  Would be shocked if a team didn't take a shot
827565837452193792 2017-02-03 17:14:05 UTC <BK432> Whoa, Byung Ho Park DFA'd. Was not expecting that at all.

826633396428369920 2017-01-31 03:28:54 UTC <BK432> The Wild are getting very good at forcing starting goalies to leave the game.
826628701236449282 2017-01-31 03:10:15 UTC <BK432> At the risk of speaking too soon, looks like there's no post-All-Star Game slump at hand for the Wild. Goodness.

824456592359886849 2017-01-25 03:19:03 UTC <BK432> Over next 18 months, contact your House Rep. Especially GOP reps. They will lose their jobs if they don't #ResistTrump
824242682855882761 2017-01-25 13:09:03 UTC <BK432> @mntwinssisters @fran_the_man you're probably right on this.
824234825460674565 2017-01-25 12:37:50 UTC <BK432> With all due respect, it's embarrassing how stupid our President is.  It won't be funny when he starts a war by being stupid.
824087459403272193 2017-01-24 02:52:15 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar you, me and about 2/3 of the country.
824009676715159553 2017-01-24 21:43:10 UTC <BK432> Drove by this last night - was wondering what was going on. Crazy.  http://www.startribune.com/rescuers-pluck-3-workers-stranded-near-top-of-golden-valley-water-tower/411665926/
823954715704696833 2017-01-24 18:04:47 UTC <BK432> Oh no.....https://twitter.com/thauserkstp/status/823954525425963008

823682442024353792 2017-01-23 00:02:52 UTC <BK432> Relieved. A Dozier for Deleon deal straight up would have been a disaster. For Forsythe? Seems fairly square.
823374708557148161 2017-01-22 03:40:02 UTC <BK432> Thank you @based_ball; very well done.http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/yordano-ventura-and-andy-marte-have-died/
823365003025805313 2017-01-22 03:01:28 UTC <BK432> @yoshihen $20 a bet usually. Lost my parlay on the NFC game because I took the under. But I digress.
823363977874915333 2017-01-22 02:57:24 UTC <BK432> @yoshihen 5dimes can give me appropriate odds, you cannot.
823363885663158272 2017-01-22 02:57:02 UTC <BK432> @yoshihen I am, but if you want money on the line personally, give the points.
823362946701082624 2017-01-22 02:53:18 UTC <BK432> @yoshihen well I'm confident straight up but why would I do that? Give me the points and I'm in.
823361881264033792 2017-01-22 02:49:04 UTC <BK432> The clear 2 best teams in football to play in Super Bowl LI.  I'm taking the Falcons straight up. Looking forward to seeing what the line is
823346179547267073 2017-01-22 01:46:40 UTC <BK432> @smugdingus it's sad and you don't have to apologize for acknowledging that.
823346108994711552 2017-01-22 01:46:24 UTC <BK432> @smugdingus it simply makes you human. Guys like Tavares, Fernandez and Ventura aren't supposed to die, at least in our minds.
823340913741230080 2017-01-22 01:25:45 UTC <BK432> I feel like I was the only one outside the state of Georgia who knew how good the Falcons were/are. Really damn good. Super Bowl favorite.
823307096913571840 2017-01-22 23:11:22 UTC <BK432> There goes my parlay (Falcons -4.5, under 61.5). But it's still a good day.

820823143010934784 2017-01-15 02:41:02 UTC <BK432> This team. This Wild team. Incredible.
820812853389172736 2017-01-15 02:00:08 UTC <BK432> Shout out to @TAshley305 - had a ton of fun at her show last night at @AcmeComedyCo. Very funny.

820045627962884098 2017-01-13 23:11:28 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne absolutely. That's a nothing contract with no risk. I would think almost any team would have done that contract for Tyson.
819978750226010112 2017-01-13 18:45:43 UTC <BK432> But so many live this way by default. It's so sad. Others' opinions and philosophies can be so enriching.
819978536362606592 2017-01-13 18:44:52 UTC <BK432> I would never want to live a life in which all who agreed with me were good, and all who did not were evil. Terrible way to live.

819322326294679557 2017-01-11 23:17:19 UTC <BK432> @mschlegel34 I agree - I think it will be a mistake if they don't acquiesce to what the market (Dodgers) will pay
819286182274224128 2017-01-11 20:53:42 UTC <BK432> @AndrewFleser nicely done, but if I pick nits, David Vitter is kind of exactly the opposite of toilet. A toilet-alternative, if you will.

818654119242170373 2017-01-09 03:02:06 UTC <BK432> First half as expected. Very even, Alabama takes advantage of mistakes. Will be a battle to the end.

817966029724852224 2017-01-07 05:27:53 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls you should - it's kinda fun.
817372886642159616 2017-01-06 14:10:56 UTC <BK432> @mattychamp that is true for sure. People excited by Les Miles have no idea how horrible that would have been.
817364129572913152 2017-01-06 13:36:09 UTC <BK432> @mattychamp in truth I have no idea, but the guy seems like a bit of a spazz, a one trick pony.  Hope it works out for Minny. You?

817219101206704129 2017-01-05 03:59:51 UTC <BK432> That's a really nice win - after the collapse vs Sparty last week I assumed @GopherMBB would be 0-3 in B10 after this game. Instead, 2-1.

816120245211512832 2017-01-02 03:13:23 UTC <BK432> Oklahoma is a good football team. Of any team I've watched not in the CFP, they seem to be the best.

816108280355418112 2017-01-02 02:25:51 UTC <BK432> Boom.  USC was better team and it's good to see them win.
816106898361552896 2017-01-02 02:20:21 UTC <BK432> How does McSorley throw two passes in a row like that. Trash.
816105764733468672 2017-01-02 02:15:51 UTC <BK432> Well, USC wasted no time at all. Wow.
816102727021428737 2017-01-02 02:03:47 UTC <BK432> Good advice - can confirm it's getting quite slick in Plymouth/Medina area.https://twitter.com/NWSTwinCities/status/816093968010248192

815918725811552256 2017-01-02 13:52:37 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I believe FOX and CBS get first pick, it's written into their contracts. Sat games are always the less desirable

812118119279972352 2016-12-22 02:10:22 UTC <BK432> @mschlegel34 well now I see it's only a 3 year deal. Pretty good signing for them
812117435759398912 2016-12-22 02:07:39 UTC <BK432> @mschlegel34 to replace a career year from Napoli. The bat doesn't hurt but net gain after year 1 is relatively minimal.

810865265730797569 2016-12-19 15:11:59 UTC <BK432> This makes me horrified to the point of tears....time to move on to better things, Monday.  http://www.kare11.com/news/nation-now/mother-who-left-son-in-freezing-car-expected-in-court-this-week-/373053789
810707198917672961 2016-12-18 04:43:53 UTC <BK432> @A_Ditt23 I wish you could!  I just think they acted pretty dumb. Seems like an energy suck to get angry about it, but certainly reckless.
810705289242673152 2016-12-18 04:36:17 UTC <BK432> @A_Ditt23 I'm just saying I sure wish we'd direct anger at the issue, not at the tweeter.
810704854058471424 2016-12-18 04:34:34 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar @A_Ditt23 I didn't say it wasn't dumb. It was, in fact, very dumb. It was his failed attempt at sarcasm.
810703969303543808 2016-12-18 04:31:03 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar @A_Ditt23 I agree - it certainly is not. I'm not sure I understand your point.

810614316273696768 2016-12-18 22:34:48 UTC <BK432> Ah, I see the Unrepentant Child Abuser had a helluva game today. He should probably take the rest of the year off.

810313529291116544 2016-12-17 02:39:34 UTC <BK432> Really glad the Arkansas State coach got the gatorade bath after the big Autonation Cure Bowl victory.
810311824411426816 2016-12-17 02:32:48 UTC <BK432> Not breaking news here, but damn, the Rockets take a ton of 3 pointers. When they don't go down, they look awful.

809988940635762688 2016-12-16 05:09:46 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood I'm disappointed...
809979864988184576 2016-12-16 04:33:43 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne well that guy is a complete idiot.

809951091928526848 2016-12-16 02:39:23 UTC <BK432> Hmm....Plymouth, MAYBE 2.5 inches since last night? Very light flakes falling. I guess maybe we get a ton overnight, but 6-8 seems high.
809948945296330752 2016-12-16 02:30:51 UTC <BK432> @Ex_Twins_News awesome. Haven't thought about them in like 10 years. Pretty good band!
809936810373738497 2016-12-16 01:42:38 UTC <BK432> And, I would argue that if students are defending their teammates, it's probably a logical conclusion that this team not play a bowl game.
809936570149175296 2016-12-16 01:41:40 UTC <BK432> If that U of M report is even half accurate, fans shouldn't concern themselves with the Holiday Bowl. Only with human decency.

809617435737387009 2016-12-15 04:33:33 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood that is quite fair actually
809606065591635968 2016-12-15 03:48:22 UTC <BK432> This @mnwild team is starting to look like a I squad to be taken seriously. We'll see where they're at in 10 more games.

807355842618134528 2016-12-09 22:46:47 UTC <BK432> @CrimsonTider74 he's on here in MN as he's a famous ex-Viking. Just rambles and is very uninformed
807353780475990017 2016-12-09 22:38:35 UTC <BK432> Fran Tarkenton is hands down the worst guest @DanBarreiroKFAN has on. Really hard to listen to.
807348698590117891 2016-12-09 22:18:24 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc we now own David Price and Daniel Murphy. Traded Addison Russell and Lucas Giolito
806984659217371136 2016-12-08 22:11:50 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc good beer? We made a big trade! I emailed you at work about it but you're not there :(
806949860238905346 2016-12-08 19:53:33 UTC <BK432> I am the proud new owner of a David Price and a Daniel Murphy. Fills two HUGE needs on my full keeper team.  Buh-bye, Giolito and Addison.
806326906937376768 2016-12-06 02:38:10 UTC <BK432> @KummerA I suppose but man they did pretty good regardless.
806326480292741121 2016-12-06 02:36:28 UTC <BK432> @KummerA nah, Swihart has lost quite a bit of shine. Not even for sure the Red Sox starting C.
806307393411940352 2016-12-06 01:20:37 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan I mean, we all can disagree, that's okay, but when I see things like "let's restructure Mauer's contract" I cringe...
806306352855445505 2016-12-06 01:16:29 UTC <BK432> This is me just being a little bit of a dick sorry, but really glad many of the commenters on Twins Daily aren't actually in charge of Twins
806279897484234754 2016-12-06 23:31:22 UTC <BK432> @morningmoneyben report him. Former military guy. First comment on the link below.  http://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/3914/MICHAEL-L-BIANCHINI
806269726922014720 2016-12-06 22:50:57 UTC <BK432> Well, this worked out well.https://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/806269346062405632
806206886882185220 2016-12-06 18:41:15 UTC <BK432> Big trade for Red Sox. That is a 5 win swing potentially for them.
806155961316605952 2016-12-06 15:18:53 UTC <BK432> Transparent HOF ballots = good thing.  People who use Twitter to yell at writers they disagree with = bad.  Good reminders for all.
805954823220842496 2016-12-05 01:59:38 UTC <BK432> I'd just add one line to this (Tommies beating Johnnies) and start a new argument.  Love this.https://twitter.com/bracehemmelgarn/status/805953817737097216

805846715039358976 2016-12-05 18:50:03 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne it should/will be the Dodgers. I'm fine with Deleon & Puig but takin on that salary should mean an additional piece
805591357842751488 2016-12-04 01:55:21 UTC <BK432> All I know is from roto - OBP guy. Don't know what he's like defensively.https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/805588149720256512
805539126606987267 2016-12-04 22:27:48 UTC <BK432> So, yeah, Bama versus Washington in Atlanta. Feeling pretty good about making another championship game. We shall see.
805538853658443776 2016-12-04 22:26:43 UTC <BK432> They picked the right 4 teams for the CFP, even if it feels weird to take Ohio State instead of Penn State.  Seeded perfectly too. Well done

805172760666312704 2016-12-03 22:12:00 UTC <BK432> Boom. Jalen got it right there.  And, the o-line blocked for the XP.  23-9.

805162324910833669 2016-12-03 21:30:32 UTC <BK432> Well Verne, that's because it was actually a 36 yard punt, not a 46 yarder.

804124709336088576 2016-11-30 00:47:25 UTC <BK432> Every time I go back and listen to The National's "Boxer" I'm more amazed by it than the last time.  Can't believe it's almost 10 years old.
804086000851046411 2016-11-30 22:13:36 UTC <BK432> @jgkfan no - missed it! Podcastable downloadable later on?

803738963148230656 2016-11-29 23:14:36 UTC <BK432> @DJMichaelGreyMN man I wish this was the 10th instead - @Lkummer and I will be looking for things to do on date night!
803705431717773312 2016-11-29 21:01:21 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne agreed. If so would be impressive 2 WAR gain with supposed improvements passed along to pitching as well.  I'm bullish.
803703383311941632 2016-11-29 20:53:13 UTC <BK432> Hey @Brandon_Warne is there a better than 50% chance the Twins can get > 2.5 WAR out of C this year if they platoon Castro/Murphy?
803661532269834244 2016-11-29 18:06:55 UTC <BK432> Whoa....https://twitter.com/mlananna/status/803660664422207488
803340759365718016 2016-11-28 20:52:17 UTC <BK432> Just as Twins decided previously, ABW absolutely is a non-tender candidate. I know his enthusiastic supporters believe otherwise.https://twitter.com/jeremynygaard/status/803339486147055616

801440616211169280 2016-11-23 15:01:47 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 this explains it best: http://coldomaha.com/2016/twins/report-minnesota-twins-sign-catcher-jason-castro/
801440239919177728 2016-11-23 15:00:17 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 this should be a great help to young pitcher development. Was the #1 move I wanted this offseason.
801439905809334274 2016-11-23 14:58:58 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 many expect a platoon (Castro hits RHP decent, Murphy can hit LHP)  And they're two of the best pitch framers in baseball
801203955539656705 2016-11-22 23:21:23 UTC <BK432> As a reminder, ZiPS is conservative on pitch framing. Even if Twins overpaid this is a hell of a signing. https://twitter.com/DSzymborski/status/801202007549812736
801202052437254144 2016-11-22 23:13:49 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne I have no doubt he'll get plenty of "direction" from the FO

797658393360142336 2016-11-12 04:32:35 UTC <BK432> Alabama is already virtually assured of a spot in the CFP. Crazy, crazy, crazy.
797658246056124417 2016-11-12 04:32:00 UTC <BK432> What a day in college football.

797652111899131904 2016-11-12 04:07:37 UTC <BK432> .@CrimsonTider74 right - kinda hard to see them sliding behind many (any?) 1-loss teams if that should happen.
797651762601742338 2016-11-12 04:06:14 UTC <BK432> Hmmm, I'm kinda wondering...do the Tide basically have a CFP spot locked up already, assuming win next week and not dropping both of last 2?
797649948472905729 2016-11-12 03:59:01 UTC <BK432> #2 and #4 now go down...#3 on the ropes. Go Hawkeyes I guess?

795727100166676481 2016-11-07 20:38:19 UTC <BK432> @DanBarreiroKFAN you won me over this year. I voted last week, and the sticker went in the garbage.
795713051609677824 2016-11-07 19:42:29 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I'm very confident in saying that they're prepped on the more notable members of the local press scene prior to the press conf.
795449604900843521 2016-11-06 02:15:39 UTC <BK432> OK, some fun begins.  I didn't say a lot of fun. Just a little fun.https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/795449431868862464
795443471498825728 2016-11-06 01:51:16 UTC <BK432> Never accept hate. Never accept bullying. Push back. Every goddamn time.  Because if we don't, it becomes normal.
795443102869843968 2016-11-06 01:49:48 UTC <BK432> @Chris_Hawkey @nstep1980 you were justifying that disgusting t-shirt. I take that personally. Reexamine yourself.
795442315083005953 2016-11-06 01:46:41 UTC <BK432> @Chris_Hawkey @nstep1980 this is extremely offensive & not remotely true. I have two family members in media. You want to kill them? Screw u

795401441586409473 2016-11-06 23:04:16 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg exactly
795378653161029632 2016-11-06 21:33:42 UTC <BK432> Oh, I see the Vikings lost. Shame.
795377939667947520 2016-11-06 21:30:52 UTC <BK432> Trump: don't talk about our state, please. You even being in it right now feels violating.

795105638674210816 2016-11-05 03:28:51 UTC <BK432> Should be 2 relatively easy wins the next two weeks and then the Iron Bowl.  Breathing a sigh of relief. Death Valley is scary place to play
795103950051672065 2016-11-05 03:22:08 UTC <BK432> Man was that a tough win. LSU played hard with a great game plan. Best team we've played this year. But......  #ROLLTIDE
795101018098962432 2016-11-05 03:10:29 UTC <BK432> That's what we call a big F'ing field goal there. Nice kick Adam.  #RollTide

795044277105659904 2016-11-05 23:25:01 UTC <BK432> Really too bad, on a day Baylor fans defend and celebrate rape, to see their team get absolutely blown out.  Karma, yo.
795041072242192386 2016-11-05 23:12:17 UTC <BK432> @KummerA right. I mean, if they're this bad at math and details, can't imagine how bad they are a the stuff we don't understand.
795040556946702337 2016-11-05 23:10:14 UTC <BK432> I have no earthly idea why Minnesota didn't just kneel on the ball 3 times &walk off. I mean, they'll still win, but the coaching is AWFUL.
795038676015284225 2016-11-05 23:02:46 UTC <BK432> Gophers-Purdue have the honor and distinction of being the last 2:30 game still going.  Over 3 1/2 hour now....
795037659127226368 2016-11-05 22:58:43 UTC <BK432> That is an awful non-call on that - that was so much pass interfernce, someone might be pregnant.
795017546789429248 2016-11-05 21:38:48 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood maybe but not necessarily so - not a great squad.  Not like the 1997 Bears to which I can attest personally.
795013091645935616 2016-11-05 21:21:06 UTC <BK432> Deep reaches of college football takes: watch out for Washington State. After rough start, they look like a PAC 12 contender.
795012567852871680 2016-11-05 21:19:01 UTC <BK432> I'm not a snap judgment, hot take guy. But I will say this:  Tracy Claeys should not be coaching a Big Ten football team.
794983723787841537 2016-11-05 19:24:24 UTC <BK432> Auburn is the 'hottest team in the country' because they've won 6 games in a row.  Dude, they aren't even the hottest team in the state.
794982853960417280 2016-11-05 19:20:57 UTC <BK432> Well, that's over.
794982756870746112 2016-11-05 19:20:33 UTC <BK432> Getting ahead of myself but if Vandy scores a TD they HAVE to go for 2.
794982588930781185 2016-11-05 19:19:53 UTC <BK432> Poor Bears..... at least "Area" made it as @RosemountCC would call them.https://twitter.com/mntrailrunner/status/794977236617142273

794209082303397888 2016-11-03 16:06:15 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 agreed. I do believe with better player development Twins can and will do far more in FA market too.
794203725006938112 2016-11-03 15:44:58 UTC <BK432> @NateSilver538 @mattkummer absolutey. Nate's is the only projection I bother to follow.

794198670467997696 2016-11-03 15:24:53 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 ....but it is not the primary reason they were a contender.
794198596442652672 2016-11-03 15:24:35 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 LOL no way. Rizzo, Russell, Bryant are the core of this franchise and were all developed in Chicago. Spending $ helped...

794040989010817025 2016-11-02 04:58:19 UTC <BK432> The Cubs and Maddon and Epstein. Maddon was OK managing but Epstein has been magnificent. Happy for all of them.

794037725280215040 2016-11-02 04:45:20 UTC <BK432> And it's Mike Montgomery to face Michael Martinez.

793996173732352000 2016-11-02 02:00:14 UTC <BK432> You talk about everything else. Jason Kipnis ran some BASES on that play.
793995927933612032 2016-11-02 01:59:15 UTC <BK432> Whoa......
793995867237871616 2016-11-02 01:59:01 UTC <BK432> they're too quick with their flags these days...
793994996764512257 2016-11-02 01:55:33 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 sure, of course. He'd pitch all night if he could. And at least get the 'W' for whatever that's worth.
793994616152334336 2016-11-02 01:54:02 UTC <BK432> That being said, letting Hendricks get into the heart of the Indians lineup for a 3rd time had the potential to go south. So you be you, Joe
793994311734009857 2016-11-02 01:52:50 UTC <BK432> I don't really want to rag on aggressive managing but man: Hendricks looked GREAT.
793992845304745984 2016-11-02 01:47:00 UTC <BK432> I'm not sure I'm taking out Hendricks any time soon.....
793989619616534529 2016-11-02 01:34:11 UTC <BK432> Yeah I have no problem with Kluber trying to get Baez and Fowler in the 5th - would have handed it off to Miller for Schwarber most likelyhttps://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/793989060003926016

793983802603343872 2016-11-02 01:11:04 UTC <BK432> Wow - Bryant completely surprised Davis there. He's got some wheels.

793970795471077376 2016-11-02 00:19:23 UTC <BK432> He had plenty of time to make a good throw. Bad.

793948678994227201 2016-11-02 22:51:30 UTC <BK432> Boom. 70 minutes till first pitch, no rooting interest, and I am as excited as my son on Halloween. https://twitter.com/NathanSchultz79/status/793947370170052608
793947570737475584 2016-11-02 22:47:06 UTC <BK432> Oh man @MLBNetwork just ran #Game7 highlights of 1991....bring us back there Derek Falvey!
793658827564462080 2016-11-01 03:39:44 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 Indians have advantage tomorrow with Kluber starting and Miller/Allen fresh. But it's 60/40. It's why I don't predict. You?
793656408663175168 2016-11-01 03:30:07 UTC <BK432> I'm on board with this, however. Wasn't a great decision, but he'll be fine for tomorrow I would think.https://twitter.com/robneyer/status/793656207873495040
793656134989025281 2016-11-01 03:29:02 UTC <BK432> Now. Now. I guess Maddon didn't think Strop was ready when the Cubs took the field.
793653968668733441 2016-11-01 03:20:26 UTC <BK432> OK pull Chapman. Come ON.
793649696262631426 2016-11-01 03:03:27 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood or just because that's what Thibodeau wants:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-lt6jDaVnc

793646594994221056 2016-11-01 02:51:08 UTC <BK432> This is really aggressive by Maddon. Wow. I truly hope he doesn't have to get all 7 outs left.

793631486696001536 2016-11-01 01:51:06 UTC <BK432> OK if the Wolves blow this lead I'm officially off the bandwagon.
793620062980542464 2016-11-01 01:05:42 UTC <BK432> Hey @grahamatc about our boy Addison....

793545611446456320 2016-11-01 20:09:51 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I knew what you meant. There's an obvious fit.
793532583854215168 2016-11-01 19:18:05 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah, I know. That would be my guess, but definitely not a sure thing.
793527388202164224 2016-11-01 18:57:27 UTC <BK432> Whoa - makes me sad unless it's the Twins he's joining. Which it's almost certain it's not.https://twitter.com/AaronGleeman/status/793524482031751168

793206346418184196 2016-10-31 21:41:44 UTC <BK432> Apparently if you 'check in' at Standing Rock the protesters win. People will believe anything these days....

790309826903638017 2016-10-23 21:52:00 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood man, I just disagree. He 'gets' his role and he usually delivers IMO
790306696346243072 2016-10-23 21:39:34 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood he's super arrogant and loves himself, but actual broadcasting skills have always impressed me.
790035959823884289 2016-10-22 03:43:45 UTC <BK432> I couldn't be more thrilled to see Ohio State lose. Fan.....freaking....tastic.
790032708210688000 2016-10-22 03:30:50 UTC <BK432> Career long attempt + 6.5 yard snap back for FG = block.  I believe holder was at least 1/2 yard too close to line of scrimmage.
790032068117946368 2016-10-22 03:28:17 UTC <BK432> UNREAL. Penn State now leads.
790029324883755009 2016-10-22 03:17:23 UTC <BK432> God it's like Kentucky has no idea what to do in this situ.....oh, yeah, okay.

790021853960138752 2016-10-22 02:47:42 UTC <BK432> Only thing I don't like about the result is the narrative on Kershaw. He's the best pitcher alive. Love watching every pitch from him.

789989541633458176 2016-10-22 00:39:18 UTC <BK432> Ugh....Eddie Jackson out for year with broken leg. Sucks for Tide, obviously even worse for him.

789929188916547584 2016-10-22 20:39:29 UTC <BK432> A booming punt and a block in the back to boot. Huge play by the punter and the special teams unit #RollTide

789827762563325952 2016-10-22 13:56:27 UTC <BK432> Hey @ktcole1 we finally used the big jug of dish soap to refill our soap brush this AM. It was a two-person job.

788944003727228928 2016-10-19 03:24:43 UTC <BK432> Well @kayleighmcenany just basically said she is for Trump contesting legitimate election results. Can't believe she's on CNN.
788935777191391232 2016-10-19 02:52:01 UTC <BK432> That was perhaps the most patriotic thing I've ever heard from @VanJones68

788932691496435716 2016-10-19 02:39:45 UTC <BK432> At this point, I'm starting the hashtag #Clinton400. Let's push for a landslide electoral college victory. Trump is a doofus.
788932415385378818 2016-10-19 02:38:40 UTC <BK432> Once again Trump got his ass kicked. His only path is a Hitler-like infancy in not accepting election results. We're better than this.

788929481775976448 2016-10-19 02:27:00 UTC <BK432> "I'm going to create tremendous jobs."  I really wish I could say this at work and get paid for it. #WheresYourPlanDoofus???
788928318527725570 2016-10-19 02:22:23 UTC <BK432> It is so easy to get Trump off message. He is an undisciplined infant. I don't understand how anyone would be comfortable with him as prez.
788927936594337793 2016-10-19 02:20:52 UTC <BK432> On the heels of Trump's "judgment" claim......https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/788927235759767552
788927287496478720 2016-10-19 02:18:17 UTC <BK432> Trump is a child.
788925582155345921 2016-10-19 02:11:30 UTC <BK432> That question was totally Trump's. He completely dropped the ball. The election is officially over.
788924804502028288 2016-10-19 02:08:25 UTC <BK432> Fuck him. Seriously. He is the worst candidate in the history of presidential elections.
788924601740955649 2016-10-19 02:07:37 UTC <BK432> Done. Election is over. We will have another President Clinton. Done. Done.
788923570982359040 2016-10-19 02:03:31 UTC <BK432> Trump ruined it. He let her off the hook by interrupting. This is now a zero-difference subject where Trump should have trounced her.
788923216555282433 2016-10-19 02:02:06 UTC <BK432> I'm a Clinton voter but Chris Wallace is EASILY the best moderator we've seen. Now Trump is interrupting and ruining the moment.

788907270843297792 2016-10-19 00:58:45 UTC <BK432> Second take: I think he's safe. 1-zip Dodgers.
788907173191553024 2016-10-19 00:58:21 UTC <BK432> First take: looked out
788902307576553473 2016-10-19 00:39:01 UTC <BK432> Not cool, Chase.

788846691596308480 2016-10-19 20:58:01 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 seriously! You just @cantpredictball
788844948854538241 2016-10-19 20:51:06 UTC <BK432> 2-0. This is starting to look quite hard for the Jays to win. Francona can use McAllister and then get aggressive with Miller/Allen. https://twitter.com/NathanSchultz79/status/788843977483190272
788836359008088064 2016-10-19 20:16:58 UTC <BK432> Worst case scenario there for Jays, going down before they even have an at-bat against the AAAA pitcher.
788579681331064832 2016-10-18 03:17:01 UTC <BK432> So....if Urias throws well tomorrow...Kershaw could pitch for the series in game 5. Big Wrigley gulp.
788577393585848320 2016-10-18 03:07:56 UTC <BK432> I love postseason managing. These games are a ton of fun
788213054605492225 2016-10-17 03:00:11 UTC <BK432> @JeffPassan we have a lot of smart people. Let's find the system that's best. And then use it. At least there will be consistency.
788212472381632512 2016-10-17 02:57:52 UTC <BK432> @JeffPassan dude, this is horrible logic
788209557277380608 2016-10-17 02:46:17 UTC <BK432> @brotherexpo well, not all offers are made public. I choose to believe the likely. You're free to do what you choose.
788207369905901568 2016-10-17 02:37:35 UTC <BK432> As always, if one hit can make you pull Shaw for Allen, why did Shaw start the inning??
788204322073042944 2016-10-17 02:25:29 UTC <BK432> @brotherexpo you can google it my man. Had some steep contract demands prior to the season.
788202071589806081 2016-10-17 02:16:32 UTC <BK432> @spacemnkymafia turning down lucrative extension offers with a year left on his contract
788201840206897152 2016-10-17 02:15:37 UTC <BK432> @jasoncollette primary DH, yes.

788174985093316613 2016-10-17 00:28:54 UTC <BK432> Bauer's finger is beyond disgusting, and I believe Terry Francona just flipped off the TBS camera
788154578533511168 2016-10-17 23:07:49 UTC <BK432> @StelliniTweets eh, I agree with the decision to let him walk. QO was too risky for the GOP.
788152471688474624 2016-10-17 22:59:27 UTC <BK432> I'd like to think that most of us could resist Billy Bush's urges to joke about sexual assault.https://twitter.com/HuffPostPol/status/788152122462375936

787839323316051968 2016-10-16 02:15:06 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @kellerjustin that was a wondrous 12:30 AM listening once I returned from Cheapo. I was blown away.
787804930589458432 2016-10-16 23:58:26 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan it is very very good.

787495293524774913 2016-10-15 03:28:03 UTC <BK432> Mm-hmm.
787494928997900288 2016-10-15 03:26:36 UTC <BK432> Too many fluky bad things can happen with the bases loaded. Batting average increases greatly. Not worth it.
787494723627978753 2016-10-15 03:25:47 UTC <BK432> Wow....I understand this but I vehemently disagree.
787491057001005056 2016-10-15 03:11:13 UTC <BK432> That was unexpected. Had a whole tweet written up about those who argued Cubs gave up too much for Chapman, yadda yadda yadda.
787490167259004928 2016-10-15 03:07:41 UTC <BK432> Who thought Rizzo wasn't going to catch that...lordy, he's made them 100x tougher than that.
787488817305518084 2016-10-15 03:02:19 UTC <BK432> Was thinking Bryant got greedy trying to get lead runner but he may not have gotten anyone, MAYBE Turner.
787396259850006528 2016-10-15 20:54:32 UTC <BK432> That's our man. Jalen. Hurts. #RollTide
787384577841045504 2016-10-15 20:08:06 UTC <BK432> And that's why the Tide are the tide. Dominating ground game on a 91 yd drive. 7-zip.
787135608254857220 2016-10-14 03:38:47 UTC <BK432> It's true, guilty as charged.  Bon Voyage, What Up.https://twitter.com/whatupbill/status/787112219351724033
786760919456092160 2016-10-13 02:49:55 UTC <BK432> Correct. But if you're going to bunt, don't bunt badly.https://twitter.com/joe_sheehan/status/786760778716184577
786758068310798337 2016-10-13 02:38:35 UTC <BK432> What the hell is the 3B coach doing here?????https://twitter.com/MrIrrelevantDC/status/786757402679017472
786757681285632001 2016-10-13 02:37:03 UTC <BK432> JOC
786757517229559808 2016-10-13 02:36:24 UTC <BK432> Who is the Nats 3B coach? He looked like he was looking to LF instead of coaching his runner...
786757002722762752 2016-10-13 02:34:21 UTC <BK432> Did the 3rd base coach really send him? If so that is the worst I've ever seen.
786756068080775168 2016-10-13 02:30:38 UTC <BK432> Wow Reddick played that one horribly
786752175678623744 2016-10-13 02:15:10 UTC <BK432> That is really close to a balk if not a balk. Hmmmmmm.......
786750950803443712 2016-10-13 02:10:18 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer absolutely. Transparency (rightly or wrongly) is now the expectation. NYT absolutely right to publish.
786747915326918656 2016-10-13 01:58:14 UTC <BK432> You had to pinch for Blanton here. Continued good managing. Urias has to get 3+ IP
786744289602707456 2016-10-13 01:43:50 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I doubt they knew either for sure but with 2 guys on in the 3rd they went to the pen
786738471390019584 2016-10-13 01:20:43 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls it always seemed like they'd roll Hill-Blanton-Urias through the first 6 or 7 innings. They're on plan if just a bit early.
786738251549839362 2016-10-13 01:19:50 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls just got in a bit of trouble. I doubt they meant for him to face more than 18 batters on short rest. Faced 13.
786735574556221440 2016-10-13 01:09:12 UTC <BK432> That is a great baseball play. The tag from 2nd to 3rd with nobody out. Gets buried in the game story. But great baseball.

786189841000230912 2016-10-12 13:00:39 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 sounds like there's agreement on that! :)
786189779243261952 2016-10-12 13:00:24 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 no question resources make it easier. My point was the talent development and trades were the real reason for success.
786173567637610496 2016-10-12 11:55:59 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 you could put all 5 of those guys on the Twins and they wouldn't even be a .500 ball club.
786173360346656768 2016-10-12 11:55:10 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 they would have no problem affording a couple of them even with a ton of dead money on the roster.
786056731415736320 2016-10-11 04:11:43 UTC <BK432> Whoa - I'm no Cubs fan but this team is largely built from within - player development, yo https://twitter.com/NathanSchultz79/status/786055003127570432

786017040628871169 2016-10-11 01:34:00 UTC <BK432> That is an insane play regardless of whether he was out or not. Javier Baez is a MAN

783850204915171328 2016-10-05 02:03:46 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I just landed from Dallas. Gonna have to watch some highlights I guess

783844892673966080 2016-10-05 01:42:40 UTC <BK432> Huh. Isn't James Loney worse than Noah Syndegaard at hitting? Especially against a left?
783843982061215745 2016-10-05 01:39:03 UTC <BK432> TJ Rivera leadoff double.  [checks upcoming lineup]  I'm having a hard time figuring out how Rivera scores, much less reaches 3rd base.
783839758292230145 2016-10-05 01:22:16 UTC <BK432> @KummerA dunno but even if it were conclusive I hate it. This isn't the first time. Not what replay was made for.
783839431753072640 2016-10-05 01:20:58 UTC <BK432> Sightings during this brief trip: @jamiewatson77 yesterday at MSP airport & Chris Berman at unnamed Dallas-area hotel. Dreams do come true.
783835120629346305 2016-10-05 01:03:50 UTC <BK432> @KummerA if that's true, they need to write a rule allowing for incidental incidents of runners coming off bases. Ridiculous.
783834929545314305 2016-10-05 01:03:04 UTC <BK432> @KummerA I'm not watching, I'm on a plane, but some saying his foot hopped off the bag for a millisecond.
783834003388391424 2016-10-05 00:59:23 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert that place was GOOOOOD. You eating there again?
783819221880844288 2016-10-05 00:00:39 UTC <BK432> Ok let's try for 0 for 2! Predictably I'm taking the Giants in a low-scorer. 3-2 Giants.
783510817429921794 2016-10-04 03:35:10 UTC <BK432> Gonna be fun to find out what was going on with Zach Britton. This was seriously some fucked up shit.
783502973183721472 2016-10-04 03:04:00 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @donnelly612 ha! Exactly.

783501531941253121 2016-10-04 02:58:16 UTC <BK432> I can't believe it. Wow. I am clearly the idiot and Showalter is the Jedi Knight.
783500950682021888 2016-10-04 02:55:58 UTC <BK432> Sure. Pull Brach after the K for O'Day. O'Day is damn good but he ain't Britton. I hope it works out....
783500268335828993 2016-10-04 02:53:15 UTC <BK432> How the fuck is Britton STILL not coming in?????
783499068249022464 2016-10-04 02:48:29 UTC <BK432> I.....I don't know what to say. I kind of hope the Blue Jays win now. Orioles only have perhaps the best AL pitcher in reserve....https://twitter.com/RhettBollinger/status/783498760584298497

783498637250744321 2016-10-04 02:46:46 UTC <BK432> This strike zone is horse crap. Straight horse crap.
783496270115590145 2016-10-04 02:37:22 UTC <BK432> This is a hell of a baseball game. Lots of fun. Go O's!

783493979396419584 2016-10-04 02:28:15 UTC <BK432> Hey drunk, fat Blue Jays fan behind home plate in the white jersey. Sit down. You suck.
783493071530958848 2016-10-04 02:24:39 UTC <BK432> I really hope Jones goes yard here.....
783492294015979524 2016-10-04 02:21:34 UTC <BK432> @jonbernhardt true - but it's just a shitty thing to do. Whoever it was should be kicked out of MLB stadiums forever.
783492017070288896 2016-10-04 02:20:28 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I hate that shit with a fiery hot passion. That person should be kicked out and never allowed into another MLB game ever.
783491503653998592 2016-10-04 02:18:25 UTC <BK432> Someone needs to be kicked out of the fucking game. Toronto hick fans are the worst.
783482236255428608 2016-10-04 01:41:36 UTC <BK432> Underrated DP turn there; Schoop with a terrific turn on that.
783481446329647104 2016-10-04 01:38:27 UTC <BK432> Finally a reliever but no reason why Tillman went as long as he did. Disappointing managing there.https://twitter.com/jazayerli/status/783481294013333504
783480693942652928 2016-10-04 01:35:28 UTC <BK432> Bad defense and bad baserunning. Yikes.
783480568180715520 2016-10-04 01:34:58 UTC <BK432> How is Saunders not standing on 3rd when Bourn misses that????
783480115502063616 2016-10-04 01:33:10 UTC <BK432> Do the O's have anyone up warming? This shouldn't be Tillman's game anymore...
783475306489257984 2016-10-04 01:14:03 UTC <BK432> @mntwinssisters That's better, though I picked the O's so......
783474946945093632 2016-10-04 01:12:38 UTC <BK432> I won't watch any more VP debate. Pence can't even get the name of the university right. No need for me to watch further. Go baseball.
783474043710164993 2016-10-04 01:09:02 UTC <BK432> Did Pence say Norwood University? I believe he did - that's a nice gaffe to begin on.
783472662798409728 2016-10-04 01:03:33 UTC <BK432> And Trumbo give the O's the lead. Big shot.
783472501548396544 2016-10-04 01:02:55 UTC <BK432> Nice play by Pillar. That's phenomenal.
783471427169071104 2016-10-04 00:58:39 UTC <BK432> Full count to Kim but Stroman hasn't thrown a strike yet...
783469759459319808 2016-10-04 00:52:01 UTC <BK432> 3 innings done QUICKLY. One hit - a Bautista HR. Surely more to come.
783336610003902464 2016-10-04 16:02:56 UTC <BK432> I've got the O's winning tonight's game in Toronto - Tilllman gets maybe 18 batters and the 'pen does the rest. Enough offense to win 4-2.

781698310860136449 2016-09-29 03:32:55 UTC <BK432> That's not a bad pitch at all by Jon Gray, just a great swing by Pence.
781696987687182336 2016-09-29 03:27:39 UTC <BK432> I agree, but if I have a challenge, I challenge immediately. You don't have to wait for a phone call you can't hear. Game is over otherwise.https://twitter.com/djshort/status/781696122733625349

779419596650532864 2016-09-23 20:38:07 UTC <BK432> Buxton will end 2016 with about 1.5 WAR in half a season. Going forward 3 should be an undesirable floor.
779419185872986112 2016-09-23 20:36:29 UTC <BK432> Billy Hamilton is a 3-win player in 2016. Not bad but worth wondering if this is his career peak. Maybe a couple more 3-win seasons coming.

778854250243760128 2016-09-22 07:11:38 UTC <BK432> I'm crammed in the 3rd row of a minivan cab headed up 52 to the airport. This is my glamorous business travel.
778834803659386880 2016-09-21 05:54:21 UTC <BK432> I'm not typically active on 1 AM Twitter. This is actually pretty boring. Yet less boring than 1 AM Rochester Airport.
778792092193611776 2016-09-21 03:04:38 UTC <BK432> This. It's like a broken record over there. This stuff should not happen routinely.https://twitter.com/MikeBatesSBN/status/778791074982617088
778783489017712640 2016-09-21 02:30:27 UTC <BK432> Well, I called that. Rochester, I'll be on you shortly.
778777427304673280 2016-09-21 02:06:22 UTC <BK432> Jeez, your wife posts a picture of your 3.5 year old son wearing pink kitty rain boots on FB and your notifications go all sorts of nuts...
778777096457949185 2016-09-21 02:05:03 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan and going SE too....wonder if we'll have to exit the area to refuel before we get clearance. I've always loved Rochester....
778776035139674112 2016-09-21 02:00:50 UTC <BK432> Is my plane going to be able to land at MSP tonight? Been in a holding pattern for a bit....
778764893013049348 2016-09-21 01:16:33 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I'm sure they've discussed that at this point in the interview process. Seems both parties are comfortable.
778755810113515520 2016-09-21 00:40:28 UTC <BK432> I still laugh so hard at the Louis CK Hilarious album.  "My phone sucks."  "No it doesn't, it's AMAZING!"
778418262312792064 2016-09-20 02:19:10 UTC <BK432> And then Campbell gets a hit because Terry Collins is a jedi knight.
778417379713781760 2016-09-20 02:15:40 UTC <BK432> How bad is Jay Bruce against LHP that he's getting pulled for Eric Campbell?!?

777715082817970176 2016-09-18 03:44:59 UTC <BK432> You take Diggs and I get it. But Bradford had a game. That is super impressive stuff. Night y'all.
777714563043106817 2016-09-18 03:42:55 UTC <BK432> So the refs all know now that intentional grounding doesn't extend the game, correct?
777712754903752706 2016-09-18 03:35:44 UTC <BK432> Well sure, who didn't see that coming. Hacky writing, NFL.

777710066027732992 2016-09-18 03:25:03 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood I think that's right, that first year with Favre.
777704763919962112 2016-09-18 03:03:59 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man that's a penal system issue. It's not the NFL's fault that he's not in prison. I say all this DETESTING the man.
777704043099492352 2016-09-18 03:01:07 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man you're probably right but the main issue for me is the child abuse. He deserves to play just wish it wasn't in Minny.
777702505685803009 2016-09-18 02:55:01 UTC <BK432> So it's a knee on AP. Again, I don't root for injuries but my fandom would step up a notch or two if he hits Injured Reserve.
777701289190760449 2016-09-18 02:50:10 UTC <BK432> But hey, you know who else is having a coming out party?  Sam Bradford.
777700188190220289 2016-09-18 02:45:48 UTC <BK432> I don't root for guys to get hurt, but I don't cry over a child beater tweaking an ankle #sorrynotsorry

777697559447863297 2016-09-18 02:35:21 UTC <BK432> Didn't get it
777697483749138432 2016-09-18 02:35:03 UTC <BK432> Looked flaggable to me there on Alexander
777693315441369088 2016-09-18 02:18:29 UTC <BK432> Eesh - awful field awareness there
777688413075976192 2016-09-18 01:59:01 UTC <BK432> Aaron Rodgers is the absolute best at exploiting the offsides/free play. His center has to snap it though.
777687282887208960 2016-09-18 01:54:31 UTC <BK432> Brilliant coaching. You can't trust Walsh inside 45 yards. I was more nervous for the XP earlier.
777683687261376512 2016-09-18 01:40:14 UTC <BK432> Cracked a beer at 8:40 on a Sunday night because it will either put me to sleep or make things more interesting. I'm already bored.

777679347092029440 2016-09-18 01:22:59 UTC <BK432> That's a nice throw by Bradford. Impressive.
777671650301005824 2016-09-18 00:52:24 UTC <BK432> I know I'm no expert, but I think you should try not tackling the WR before the ball gets there.
777670196899086336 2016-09-18 00:46:38 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood there's no way. I'll fall asleep or get bored.
777668738292211712 2016-09-18 00:40:50 UTC <BK432> It really should be a fresh set of downs for the Pack.
777668689575354368 2016-09-18 00:40:38 UTC <BK432> That ball was recovered by the Vikings and re-fumbled.

777666908397023232 2016-09-18 00:33:33 UTC <BK432> So the Vikings kind of have their "Let's Play Hockey" thing with the horn now. Got it.
777666507023134720 2016-09-18 00:31:58 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 did the Vikings get a new stadium or something? I kid, I kid...
777665937361149953 2016-09-18 00:29:42 UTC <BK432> Hopefully I'l stay awake because my 3.5 year old NEVER STOPS and doesn't nap anymore. I wouldn't have the energy to be him, that's for sure.
777665490181206017 2016-09-18 00:27:55 UTC <BK432> OK fine, I'll watch the Vikings game and occasionally share my opinions via Twitter. I know you all were dying for this moment.

775516841628368897 2016-09-12 02:09:58 UTC <BK432> Easy to root for the consistently underrated, underappreciated and ignored Kyle Hendricks. I'm an unabashed Cubs fan this 9th inning.
775516263279910912 2016-09-12 02:07:40 UTC <BK432> Hendricks is gonna get this. Awesome to see a guy like Kyle Hendricks with this shot.

775168427799478272 2016-09-11 03:05:29 UTC <BK432> I mean, my league was happy to let me take Fitz for $3 so I guess they have to accept this lickin' and move on...

773513111718469633 2016-09-07 13:27:51 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 @fran_the_man Fran, I'll play in a league with you any time :)
773482813710409728 2016-09-07 11:27:28 UTC <BK432> I like it. I love the zero RB approach.
773373136230293504 2016-09-06 04:11:38 UTC <BK432> Happy to have switched away from the trainwreck at Target Field and watch the Lynx instead. Big win over LA. Best record in WNBA now.
773370830877327361 2016-09-06 04:02:29 UTC <BK432> Yep. These are still ringing in my head. Can't forget it, can't un-know it.https://twitter.com/minnie_jax/status/773370333017407488
773360571991334912 2016-09-06 03:21:43 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man I would argue you SHOULD have half a roster you don't want. You don't win with depth.
773359157449818112 2016-09-06 03:16:06 UTC <BK432> look at it this way. You're smart. Auctions favor the smart.
773358730926784512 2016-09-06 03:14:24 UTC <BK432> that's part of the strategy! Auctions are WAY better than drafts.
773356749604675584 2016-09-06 03:06:32 UTC <BK432> This is really hard for me to say....but I might be done watching the Twins for the year. It's almost like they're trying to be awful.
773355953102131200 2016-09-06 03:03:22 UTC <BK432> The comments on this article show some serious, serious denial http://www.collegian.psu.edu/opinion/editorials/article_ef670526-70c0-11e6-a202-1f38a58c7167.html
773355189776646145 2016-09-06 03:00:20 UTC <BK432> Hey @AdrienneAmell nice little 5 point lead at the half for you squad #LosLynx

773009995642335232 2016-09-05 04:08:39 UTC <BK432> Well week 1 of college football is over.  We know this:  Alabama will be tough to beat in SEC ACC is loaded  We'll see where we go from here
772983907260198912 2016-09-05 02:24:59 UTC <BK432> @RepFreiberg hard to see another reason for writing that distinction. Slippery slope in writing that way....yikes.
772982752002076672 2016-09-05 02:20:24 UTC <BK432> @KummerA I hear ya - still though.
772982068070457344 2016-09-05 02:17:40 UTC <BK432> @KummerA we should communicate with each other in more meaningful and effective ways.
772981377880948736 2016-09-05 02:14:56 UTC <BK432> @KummerA Legends Club C - we paid $30/each for them. You?
772980700849070080 2016-09-05 02:12:15 UTC <BK432> @KummerA we were there too.
772906563644383232 2016-09-05 21:17:39 UTC <BK432> My god. What a game to be at. #Dozier #MNTwins
772889296663613440 2016-09-05 20:09:02 UTC <BK432> Heh. Juan Centeno bunt single

772882236391686144 2016-09-05 19:40:59 UTC <BK432> Bit of a mixed bag for Berrios today. Got his Ks, walked only 1 but still struggled command-wise and got hit pretty hard.

772804097716158464 2016-09-05 14:30:29 UTC <BK432> Good stuff here on Bradford trade: http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2016/09/04/sam-bradford-trade-minnesota-vikings-philadelphia-eagles-nfl
772621563472453634 2016-09-04 02:25:10 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer how did you come across the Sunday Sermons interview?
772620518574796800 2016-09-04 02:21:00 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer well done to them. I appreciate the information in the Barreiro interview because we've all been wondering how it all came to be
772619004598857728 2016-09-04 02:14:59 UTC <BK432> Really is a brilliant interview. Highly recommended. Roughly 15:00 to 33:00. Use this link: http://kfan.iheart.com/media/play/27285740/https://twitter.com/mattkummer/status/772521577275588609
772519811830120449 2016-09-04 19:40:50 UTC <BK432> This is the kind of stuff that keeps Sept ball interesting around here. Perhaps some confidence is building for BBhttps://twitter.com/Twins/status/772508964693028864
772408241263378433 2016-09-04 12:17:30 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert that is awesome!! They can be Gophers and Bama fans :)
772292615979098112 2016-09-03 04:38:02 UTC <BK432> Good game between Auburn and Clemson, fun watch. More than anything, makes me realize Tide is true #1 in the nation.
772292068010065920 2016-09-03 04:35:52 UTC <BK432> Uh, yeahhttps://twitter.com/ESPNCFB/status/772291992697069568
772284004557004800 2016-09-03 04:03:49 UTC <BK432> @KummerA they came a long way. Was fun to see the progression
772274886656061440 2016-09-03 03:27:35 UTC <BK432> Hard not to - this is really impressivehttps://twitter.com/kwsanders/status/772274072759578624
772272438365347840 2016-09-03 03:17:52 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79  happy birthday!
772271396173049856 2016-09-03 03:13:43 UTC <BK432> Way too early to be super positive but Tide has never looked this good this early. That's all I'm gonna say.
772270578392784896 2016-09-03 03:10:28 UTC <BK432> In addition to the Tide rolling tonight, the Tommies crushed the Blugolds today too http://www.tommiemedia.com/news/tommies-roll-in-season-opener-at-eau-claire/
772269033072783362 2016-09-03 03:04:20 UTC <BK432> I mean this is as impressive a Tide win on opening week as I can remember. This team is ready for the grind...
772268260347740160 2016-09-03 03:01:15 UTC <BK432> I'm sure Cooper Bateman is the nicest kid but I'm really happy to see Hurts and Barnett take the job and run with it. #Bama #RollTide
772259108875567104 2016-09-03 02:24:54 UTC <BK432> And I was botching about this game into the 2nd quarter! Turning into a RollTide blowout
772155311973081088 2016-09-03 19:32:26 UTC <BK432> All credit to Houston - great win. I just don't know how good Oklahoma is this year. Tough to gauge. Gotta let the season play out.
772154310016823296 2016-09-03 19:28:28 UTC <BK432> Oh my lord Mississippi State loses to South Alabama. Awful, awful loss for a squad that hoped to compete this year.
772150484643741697 2016-09-03 19:13:16 UTC <BK432> And Northwestern is going to lose to Western Michigan. That was not on the agenda in Evanston I wouldn't think...
772045970653667328 2016-09-03 12:17:57 UTC <BK432> KSTP going one step further saying some remains were found. Wow.https://twitter.com/1500ESPN_Reusse/status/772045316300296193
772040440346476544 2016-09-03 11:55:59 UTC <BK432> I truly hope this is a big step toward closing this casehttps://twitter.com/WCCO/status/772035660882423808
771909244991963140 2016-09-02 03:14:40 UTC <BK432> This isn't sounding good at all. If you know those at the shore this weekend tell them to get out.https://twitter.com/pdouglasweather/status/771901977643061252

771697223767879680 2016-09-02 13:12:10 UTC <BK432> @shamelesstubby but it's a BALLSY 95%....
771565361032343552 2016-09-01 04:28:11 UTC <BK432> Claeys explains it lucidly and clearly. Mase can disagree all he wants.
771564045832892416 2016-09-01 04:22:58 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 man, don't say that. Need some shuteye :)

771562976327327745 2016-09-01 04:18:43 UTC <BK432> Critical thinking skills are important. I absolutely loved the callhttps://twitter.com/PhilMackey/status/771562852050022402
771562599322296320 2016-09-01 04:17:13 UTC <BK432> I still love it. Without question.
771562363992498176 2016-09-01 04:16:17 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 I hope he doesn't chicken out on this timeout
771562207192551425 2016-09-01 04:15:39 UTC <BK432> God I love this. I've actually never seen a team do this. I don't care how it works out I love this.
771562065110577152 2016-09-01 04:15:05 UTC <BK432> Go for 2. It's the right thing to do.
771561177822273537 2016-09-01 04:11:34 UTC <BK432> I want this take first....if the Gophers score a TD, they should absolutely go for 2. I realize this will be unpopular.
771554679129985024 2016-09-01 03:45:44 UTC <BK432> Hooray for Gophers, but what an awful non-tackle there by the Beaver defender.
771554173510791168 2016-09-01 03:43:44 UTC <BK432> Mase - I love you, but predicting Leidner will run on 3rd and 9 isn't exactly going out on a limb.
771552377648259073 2016-09-01 03:36:36 UTC <BK432> Oh my god a pass that went more than 5 yards downfield, impressive stuff.
771551859089616897 2016-09-01 03:34:32 UTC <BK432> The Beaver defenders are cheating the 5-yard patterns. I think they figured Leidner out.
771550964394315776 2016-09-01 03:30:59 UTC <BK432> The Gophers sure don't look like they're on their way to 10-2, @DanBarreiroKFAN.....
771547844696117248 2016-09-01 03:18:35 UTC <BK432> Whoa - 55 yd FG puts the Cocks up 13-10 over Vandy with 35 seconds to go. Wow.
771540575602380801 2016-09-01 02:49:42 UTC <BK432> Gotta save that last timeout for when there's zero seconds left I guesshttps://twitter.com/MattMackowiak/status/771540412703969280
771539610639839232 2016-09-01 02:45:52 UTC <BK432> If you have SEC network I suggest flipping over....monumental upset is possible...
771538989178163201 2016-09-01 02:43:24 UTC <BK432> So if I want that America, I vote for Hilary, right?https://twitter.com/Mediaite/status/771516997343535104
771538122932822016 2016-09-01 02:39:57 UTC <BK432> Tennessee is getting a big test in Knoxville. Appalachian State...they beat Michigan on opening weekend 9 years ago. 13-all, 4 min to go
771536619476127744 2016-09-01 02:33:59 UTC <BK432> Bizarre decision by Gary Andersen there. Declines the penalty, keeping Gophers in FG range. Carpenter gives Gophers the halftime lead. Huh.
771534328853430274 2016-09-01 02:24:53 UTC <BK432> I can't help but think the Twins could use at least a couple more runs here if we want to end the streak...
771505539050115073 2016-09-01 00:30:29 UTC <BK432> Well, hopefully Teddy is smiling watching this onepic.twitter.com/LLp6ktECG0
771474658118041600 2016-09-01 22:27:46 UTC <BK432> @TCAnelle true. Good luck with transportation tonight. Stay late at the Twins game.
771472579890667520 2016-09-01 22:19:30 UTC <BK432> @TCAnelle never fret. I'll be flipping between Twins and college football. No Vikes for me.

770732012093136896 2016-08-30 21:16:45 UTC <BK432> This is irresponsible somewhat to speculate but based on everything we know, dislocated knee is my guess on Teddy http://www.coreperformance.com/knowledge/injury-pain/dislocated-kneecap.html
770731384776163328 2016-08-30 21:14:16 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer dislocated knee sounds more probable to me http://www.coreperformance.com/knowledge/injury-pain/dislocated-kneecap.html

770669623914004480 2016-08-30 17:08:51 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert ha - they really do. It's crazy. The food there sucked. That's why it closed.

769625742439096320 2016-08-27 20:00:50 UTC <BK432> In a season full of disgusting that was the worst. The absolute worst. Twins fans we deserve so much better.
769600930841038848 2016-08-27 18:22:15 UTC <BK432> @MplsMaggio even in my 2 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR/TE, 1 FLEX league people are still shocked when I spend hardly any auction $ on RB.
769585949072199680 2016-08-27 17:22:43 UTC <BK432> Probably. I stand too. But I don't know why we have to make someone's personal decision a national controversy. https://twitter.com/bcuban/status/769585680569688064

769531382863454209 2016-08-27 13:45:53 UTC <BK432> You can be conservative. You can vote Republican. Those are supportable things to do. But voting Trump? No way. Indefensible.
769530991690022913 2016-08-27 13:44:20 UTC <BK432> It should cause us all pain. He's unsupportable as a candidate for Prez.https://twitter.com/JoshRaby/status/769530739897536513

768943210953662464 2016-08-25 22:48:42 UTC <BK432> I think I'm allowed to say that it's actually really cool to see Alex Wimmers come up to the bigs. It's been a hell of a road for him.

768134431349444608 2016-08-23 17:14:54 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer probably but we discussed this last week. You said people clamor to work here. Supply/demand lowers wages.
768133130137980928 2016-08-23 17:09:44 UTC <BK432> @KeithLeventhal @mattkummer I just find the article laughable at face value. San Fran housing prices are AT LEAST triple MSP
768132697650712578 2016-08-23 17:08:00 UTC <BK432> @KeithLeventhal @mattkummer but to be fair you do leave out that you are two levels job-wise above what you did in MSP...

766798500411637765 2016-08-19 00:46:23 UTC <BK432> I shouldn't be surprised anymore but DAMN IT @NBCOlympics why do you have to take a commercial break during the 5K?!?!?!?

766378975916593152 2016-08-18 20:59:21 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer so at 49-71 in mid August, this is not a battle I'm remotely interested in fighting.
766378844903407616 2016-08-18 20:58:49 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer and one's hitting 4th. The other 6th. The data shows lineup optimization is worth maybe a win if you're generous in a season.
766377867202666496 2016-08-18 20:54:56 UTC <BK432> @michaelcbarr but over Harambe???? Have we all gone insane??
766377417267109888 2016-08-18 20:53:09 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer it's probably worth calming down a bit about the lineup. The squad is 49-71...

766362678998753280 2016-08-18 19:54:35 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne yeah, the premise re: Cy Young award is fine but way too much reliance on fWAR for me, especially in comparing RPs.
766361825386586112 2016-08-18 19:51:12 UTC <BK432> @ppppolls @SSReaney @alexnextdoorkr well are you denying it? Because if not THAT'S a story. LOL.

765374353479524352 2016-08-15 02:27:20 UTC <BK432> @xylemmaster that 400 meters was pretty amazing too. The 5K will be great

763177941027069952 2016-08-09 00:59:34 UTC <BK432> Reminder: a vote for Trump is a vote for killing the president. Never forget that. You can't separate the two.
763174047718871040 2016-08-09 00:44:06 UTC <BK432> Ben Revere made a sensational catch in DC to keep Scherzer's no-hitter (yes another one) alive http://atmlb.com/2b6NWvG 
763166764796489729 2016-08-09 00:15:10 UTC <BK432> That throw - wow
763108746855718912 2016-08-09 20:24:37 UTC <BK432> Last RT - if you vote for Trump, just know you're voting for a guy who suggested you kill a President. Which side you on?
762837740429815811 2016-08-08 02:27:44 UTC <BK432> Nice little play by Polanco there - SS capable but probably a better 2B
762834037115269120 2016-08-08 02:13:01 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 I don't quite understand why someone like Boone would say those things. Literally zero chance you look good afterward.

762485444550402049 2016-08-07 03:07:50 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid if I'm picking people to hang out with he'd be nowhere near the top of the list. But I have enough friends :)
762485272512565248 2016-08-07 03:07:09 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid I get it - he's a dick. I just don't care. I care about his baseball accomplishments.
762483665112674304 2016-08-07 03:00:46 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid but let's be clear: they're not magic pills.
762483590198202369 2016-08-07 03:00:28 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid he knew they were illegal so count that against his character

762115610012749824 2016-08-06 02:38:15 UTC <BK432> @yoshihen yes he is. You can feel how you want about the drugs but not doesn't change what he did. By the way you still look at Twitter? :)

761748939913572353 2016-08-05 02:21:14 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood yeah but for me personally that is the one highway I don't take.
761741952677097472 2016-08-05 01:53:28 UTC <BK432> Sure, let's cheer Dozier for getting himself out on purpose with 2 guys on  up 2 in the 9th. Whatever.

758857076768550912 2016-07-28 02:50:00 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan yeah, really nice move for the interim GM. Nunez has been great but wasn't going to be here when we contend.

758041828209860609 2016-07-26 20:50:30 UTC <BK432> @jaw229 @morningmoneyben I am beyond jealous.....enjoy
757957120365133824 2016-07-26 15:13:54 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood they did - and it's quite sad.
757778672430362625 2016-07-25 03:24:49 UTC <BK432> Would have been nice to see that speech from Bernie two months ago. Better late than never. Sure hope we all get on board.
757764679452139520 2016-07-25 02:29:12 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin fine. I may even agree. But my god, let's be honest, a vote for 3rd party or a non-vote is one vote closer to Prez Trump.
757763105912795136 2016-07-25 02:22:57 UTC <BK432> If you want anger, bullying, racism, sexism, etc. vote for the other guy. But if you're against that? Vote for Hilary. Don't throw this away
757762824818995201 2016-07-25 02:21:50 UTC <BK432> That speech. And during it the other candidate was making gay insinuations about Cory Booker. This isn't tough America.
757762537660125184 2016-07-25 02:20:42 UTC <BK432> Wow.....
757761085512425473 2016-07-25 02:14:55 UTC <BK432> Just preaching decency and levelheadedness. Shouldn't be anti-anything.https://twitter.com/rickklein/status/757760827030114304
757759137895755776 2016-07-25 02:07:11 UTC <BK432> The @FLOTUS is deservedly getting a huge ovation. One of the best results of @POTUS' presidency is the country getting to meet her.

757606955321954304 2016-07-25 16:02:28 UTC <BK432> Cubs paying steep price but can afford to do so. My initial reaction is just to love this deal. Both are winners.https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/757605903554207744
757297397554880512 2016-07-24 19:32:24 UTC <BK432> @MikeBerardino @mattkummer completely agree with Mike. Sano needs reps and absolutely should be opening day 3B next year.
757067388470697984 2016-07-23 04:18:25 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan well....I get your perspective. I just fear that it will cause the best qualified candidates to look elsewhere for work.
757062280060153856 2016-07-23 03:58:07 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc yes! keep getting after it!
757055890532896768 2016-07-23 03:32:44 UTC <BK432> People: only trust trade confirmations in your Twitter baseball list, first-person reports only. You'll never get fooled that way.
757055299563905024 2016-07-23 03:30:23 UTC <BK432> And Ryon Healy just ended it in Oakland on a solo shot - newly signed last weekend to my AL squad by the way
757054384215732224 2016-07-23 03:26:45 UTC <BK432> Wow - Jake Smolinski just went yard to tie the Rays up at 3 in Oakland in the 9th
757053636207742977 2016-07-23 03:23:46 UTC <BK432> I know a lot of people don't care but there continue to be some positive signs with the Twins. Can't help but root for them every day.
757053331835465728 2016-07-23 03:22:34 UTC <BK432> Boom - Twins win.
757043206630481920 2016-07-23 02:42:20 UTC <BK432> On the flip side of Gladden, Roy Smalley is actually really good with Bremer. I really enjoy him.
757042731910729728 2016-07-23 02:40:27 UTC <BK432> I can't stand listening to Gladden. I just find his whole bit asinine.https://twitter.com/TwinkieTown/status/757041427977162752
757038064396939265 2016-07-23 02:21:54 UTC <BK432> My goodness, everything has been working since the 2nd out of the inning. Twins take the lead!
757034952915419136 2016-07-23 02:09:32 UTC <BK432> Vargas is safe.
757034597666349057 2016-07-23 02:08:07 UTC <BK432> Kind of a sloppy game at Fenway tonight after last night's barnburner.
757029706684170240 2016-07-23 01:48:41 UTC <BK432> Absolutely. He starts at 3B opening day next year no matter what. https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/757029203388862464

756622580308553728 2016-07-22 22:50:55 UTC <BK432> Anyway....enough on politics. Back to regularly scheduled programming.

756328461195743232 2016-07-21 03:22:11 UTC <BK432> This speech is off the rails. My lord.
756325677574545408 2016-07-21 03:11:08 UTC <BK432> There are precisely zero non-Trump supporters who are being swayed by this speech. I am disgusted by this.

756321437854695424 2016-07-21 02:54:17 UTC <BK432> Whoa, did Trump scrap the LGBT line????
756320818595000324 2016-07-21 02:51:49 UTC <BK432> How dare he take the evil in Baton Rouge and blame Obama. That is beyond sick.

756290584462131200 2016-07-21 00:51:41 UTC <BK432> @andrewhelmers right. But even still, they're both good pitchers traditionally and sabermetrically. This isn't one or the other. Hate it.
756281155595403264 2016-07-21 00:14:13 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer they need to stop letting the crazies talk. We're better off with two smart, intelligent parties

755866866619289600 2016-07-20 20:47:58 UTC <BK432> Feels mean-spirited, but I am LOVING the fact that the Royals are getting blown out and will be 47-47 and nearly 10 games out of 1st.
755854825116405761 2016-07-20 20:00:08 UTC <BK432> Now Mr. Anti-Walk himself, Eddie Rosario - 2 run bomb after the error. 4-1 Twins, on the verge of taking the series at Comerica.

754493312514465792 2016-07-16 01:49:58 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin that's true. I think we all thought Pikachu was annoying but you just needed to change it up now and then.
754492650997161984 2016-07-16 01:47:20 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin this from Mr. Pikachu himself....

751613883509452800 2016-07-08 03:08:08 UTC <BK432> You don't always run for a guy just for  a speedy guy. You can also get someone on the bases who actually understands baserunning.

751608371753590784 2016-07-08 02:46:14 UTC <BK432> I can't fathom killing anyone, but beyond that, who could kill a 2 year old? How can you pull a trigger on a baby? It's truly unfathomable.

744723031902289920 2016-06-19 02:46:21 UTC <BK432> The NBA still gets so much shade thrown its way by the masses. But WHAT A LEAGUE. The NBA has a great product they're selling...

743878286799937536 2016-06-17 18:49:38 UTC <BK432> Hm. I thought the decision to DFA Arcia was a poor one too, but people it's not like he's an imminent all-star. Serious warts on him.
743652573786284032 2016-06-16 03:52:44 UTC <BK432> @KummerA or just don't DFA him for a nobody like Danny Santana.

741728906999255041 2016-06-11 20:28:46 UTC <BK432> NUNEZ (someone GIF that)
741728676182532096 2016-06-11 20:27:51 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood it's true and I have to try really hard not to be angry about it each time
741728588093755392 2016-06-11 20:27:30 UTC <BK432> Buxton is having more and more big league at-bats; nice to see. The hits and power will come.
741724975703281665 2016-06-11 20:13:09 UTC <BK432> The other option is you ask your pitcher to cover 3rd in that situation, but I would guess that is not the case.
741724359157374976 2016-06-11 20:10:42 UTC <BK432> I had them backwards - assumed it was Nunez over there. It was Plouffe. It's got to be him.
741724106911932416 2016-06-11 20:09:42 UTC <BK432> To me, Plouffe will naturally cover 2nd on that play, Nunez needs to see the ball to his left and wheel over to 3rd immediately
741723657072836609 2016-06-11 20:07:55 UTC <BK432> That was Nunez who needs to cover there, right?
741720990640525312 2016-06-11 19:57:19 UTC <BK432> Huh. I'll admit it, I gave up on this game after Bradley's 3 run shot. Guess I'll be tuning back in #CantBlameMe
741478781387341824 2016-06-10 03:54:52 UTC <BK432> @gaulstone they will. Game 3 was a complete outlier. Cavs are outclassed
741478177818562560 2016-06-10 03:52:28 UTC <BK432> @gaulstone wrong - just 23 minutes, MORON
741477803917381636 2016-06-10 03:50:59 UTC <BK432> If Curry makes one of these two and makes the final score we still don't have a game decided by single digits
741470287435161601 2016-06-10 03:21:07 UTC <BK432> Warriors are about to blow this open. Cavs look literally dead on offense.

738196083499732994 2016-06-01 02:30:35 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer tell Jordy to stop going to farmers' markets and get back to the jugs machine #IfPackersFansWereTwinsFans #ActuallyTheyreWorse
738190237785051136 2016-06-01 02:07:22 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I've never wanted to do either of those things
737979212410195969 2016-06-01 12:08:49 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer hey  you're talking to the wrong guy - I own Danny Valencia in roto, not Trevor Plouffe.
737846236628287488 2016-05-31 03:20:25 UTC <BK432> This is the kind of nonsense that makes me want to quit Twitterhttps://twitter.com/ryanvanyo/status/737839258329718784
737845136642740225 2016-05-31 03:16:03 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer you just love to troll, don't you.....
737841287974510592 2016-05-31 03:00:46 UTC <BK432> Well, you have to give Sano a lot of credit for beating that. He's surprisingly quick down the line. Too bad he's out now...
737836876531433472 2016-05-31 02:43:14 UTC <BK432> I mean, I have a hard time caring about Sano's troubles in RF when Nunez and Duffey can't complete a simple DP.
737836565456621568 2016-05-31 02:42:00 UTC <BK432> "That's a tough play."  Well, no, it's really not. Little Leaguers turn a 3-6-1 routinely.
737836064308625408 2016-05-31 02:40:00 UTC <BK432> Uh ohhttps://twitter.com/NFLSTROUD/status/737835862776545281
737834210354995200 2016-05-31 02:32:38 UTC <BK432> I love the moonshots, but the oppo field 2-strike double is a beautiful thing from Byung-Ho Park
737831799234166784 2016-05-31 02:23:03 UTC <BK432> @shamelesstubby are you planning on picking him?? #Lakershttps://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/737830430590697472
737831441149644801 2016-05-31 02:21:38 UTC <BK432> Two first pitch swings for Davis and Alonso.....letting Duffey off the hook big time.
737783225813209093 2016-05-31 23:10:03 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne @ObermillerNate as compared to league average? I'd be shocked. Screenshot the proof please...
737779358585237505 2016-05-31 22:54:41 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne that's pretty freaking cool
737777664279339008 2016-05-31 22:47:57 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne it's probably the best measure of OF defense....and yeah, wow.

737018699983560704 2016-05-29 20:32:05 UTC <BK432> I feel like I need to start actually doing some research on Robbie Grossman - could he be okay?

736391645122441216 2016-05-27 03:00:24 UTC <BK432> @twikipedium very odd. Trying to look smart I guess.....
736391060998529024 2016-05-27 02:58:05 UTC <BK432> Well....when I saw in roto that I got a Felix v Twins this week I already put that in the W column. Not sure if I'm happy or sad.
736390722664943616 2016-05-27 02:56:44 UTC <BK432> What a bizarre non-call there...
736389874081792000 2016-05-27 02:53:22 UTC <BK432> Not fan interference...
736388457531068416 2016-05-27 02:47:44 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne Roy liked it because "likely a low scoring game." I heard that and thought, "FOR WHO????"
736388105289273346 2016-05-27 02:46:20 UTC <BK432> But whatever. Baserunners. And Dozier got a ball on the inner half.
736387961319784448 2016-05-27 02:45:46 UTC <BK432> Im not sure what Roy likes more; the decision to bunt, bunting a ball that almost bounced or that Ianetta was painfully slow to get the ball
736386238605824011 2016-05-27 02:38:55 UTC <BK432> Drives you nuts, doesn't it? Interviewing 101 tells you not to do that. https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/736386005897449473

735854486434914305 2016-05-26 15:25:55 UTC <BK432> Looks as if Urias may make a few starts - which is great. He'll shift to the pen later for sure which makes sense.
735843225387180037 2016-05-26 14:41:10 UTC <BK432> I understand the innings concerns but I hate that he's going to the bullpen for the rest of the year.https://twitter.com/BNightengale/status/735842842745180160

733489925509648384 2016-05-19 02:50:00 UTC <BK432> @realjimandrews @kellerjustin @gaulstone I finally watched this - wow. Don't even remember the sketch. Pretty awful.

732555669627277312 2016-05-17 12:57:36 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan you're probably closer to it than me but I personally have no idea what Kaler did or didn't do.

730881395745247233 2016-05-12 22:04:38 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood HR/FB ratio is higher now than during 'steroid era'. That's what doesn't wash with me.

730869165356138496 2016-05-12 21:16:02 UTC <BK432> @TwinsGeek @Seth_Kaplan and let's remember, they don't have to open. If they feel forced, close on Mondays to save operating expenses.

730426442035662849 2016-05-11 15:56:49 UTC <BK432> At home with an ear infection. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. But, I did get the @twinsdaily game thread started. http://twinsdaily.com/topic/22409-game-thread-twins-vs-orioles-51116-1210-pm-ct/
730232627110809600 2016-05-10 03:06:40 UTC <BK432> My fever broke right around the time the wheels fell off for the #MNTwins. Sorry folks but I'm happy with the trade.
730227214525050882 2016-05-10 02:45:09 UTC <BK432> @bridman77 I don't think anyone's ever mentioned it!
730210258031759362 2016-05-10 01:37:46 UTC <BK432> You won't get away with a pitch like that too often. Let's see if he can settle down and get maybe 4 more outs.
730209756443336704 2016-05-10 01:35:47 UTC <BK432> Manny Machado is ridiculous
729843476750163970 2016-05-09 01:20:19 UTC <BK432> Too bad we missed out on Mauer at leadoff tonight. Gotta wait one more day. Some of us have been waiting for this for two years or more.
729843151406424065 2016-05-09 01:19:01 UTC <BK432> Strasburg hit struggles post TJ, but super cool to see him back and get rewarded financially. Good on him.
729508025707462656 2016-05-08 03:07:21 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I concur with this. Let him rip it up at AAA a while.
729473860400078848 2016-05-08 00:51:35 UTC <BK432> This is insane....if true, obviously Lynch off team and Pitino probably needs to be fired.https://twitter.com/GopherHole/status/729471988197023744

729036569575866368 2016-05-07 19:53:57 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne I can't stop thinking about this. Would be super interesting to see.
729029673502552064 2016-05-07 19:26:33 UTC <BK432> And I get that Pat Dean is on the 40 so sure, he was in line, but it's so uninspiring and reminds me of my wonder why he was added at all.
729028493435113472 2016-05-07 19:21:52 UTC <BK432> Best of luck to Casey Fien who certainly had some moments with #MNTwins. But really glad to see him continuing his career elsewhere.

728402732885921792 2016-05-05 01:55:19 UTC <BK432> Like many of you, I personally advocated for letting Fien walk this winter. He's not terrible. But he's completely ordinary.
728051990807334912 2016-05-04 02:41:35 UTC <BK432> In other 'ball news, we lost the inaugural game of the season 19-9. At least it was against the defending champs....we'll get some Ws...
728050419562250240 2016-05-04 02:35:21 UTC <BK432> Really glad I turned the game on....
728050328327852032 2016-05-04 02:34:59 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer that's what I meant , you'd want The Bends #1. And new album isn't out yet so I can possibly rank it
727987969634799617 2016-05-04 22:27:11 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I know you'll strongly disagree with that set of rankings
727987812155404288 2016-05-04 22:26:34 UTC <BK432> @radiohead So my @Radiohead list goes:  1. Kid A 2. In Rainbows 3. OK Computer 4. The Bends 5. Hail To The Thief 6. Amnesiac 7. King of Limbs 8. PH
727987435322392576 2016-05-04 22:25:04 UTC <BK432> As an 'In Rainbows' fan, I would potentially flip that to 2, but hard to argue with anything here http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/ranking-every-radiohead-album-from-worst-to-best/9/
727979886741180416 2016-05-04 21:55:04 UTC <BK432> This is awful - Ft McMurray fires. This is a LOT of lost homes - not sure I've ever heard of anything like it.https://twitter.com/MPRweather/status/727966400212406272

727704528288649216 2016-05-03 03:40:54 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin well played
727652560753045505 2016-05-03 00:14:24 UTC <BK432> Off the Chick-Fil-A sign I believe. Solo shot for Santana. Nice start.
727562964992065536 2016-05-03 18:18:22 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin i'll take the over - he won't do it. Here's who should: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZARAldXlSyA

727321834077581313 2016-05-02 02:20:12 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne you search things I would never dare....
727321352097533952 2016-05-02 02:18:17 UTC <BK432> Wasn''t great, but we're seeing what makes Berrios special. He'll continue to get better at his new level - it's what he does.
727317035365994496 2016-05-02 02:01:08 UTC <BK432> God that was awesome - threw the exact same pitch.
727316281410486273 2016-05-02 01:58:09 UTC <BK432> I'm not one to complain about umpiring/refereeing but this umpiring has been an absolute joke. Has missed on at least a half-dozen pitches.
727258884537208834 2016-05-02 22:10:04 UTC <BK432> In case anyone from Canada follows me, my last tweet should have been an obvious poor attempt at humor.

727174942731563011 2016-05-02 16:36:31 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin well then I had Maggie right, just flipped the boys. Damn it.
727170609868738560 2016-05-02 16:19:18 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin clockwise from top-left: Bobby, Freddy, Maggie
726890516311379968 2016-05-01 21:46:18 UTC <BK432> To say Sano got a bit carried away there would be a massive understatement. What a super disappointing #MNTwins weekend.
726871970692747265 2016-05-01 20:32:37 UTC <BK432> Ugh. Hate to see an awful player like Castellanos play a role like that.
726584784575729664 2016-04-30 01:31:26 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer right. And Zuke and Murphy are pretty awful at the dish right now. Not sure I'd opt for the 3rd catcher, but I might.
726583527337242624 2016-04-30 01:26:26 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer Buxton needs time at AAA so he isn't striking out in half his at-bats. Quentin is fine. 3rd C only to pinch hit twice for Cs
726583058795757569 2016-04-30 01:24:35 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer and you?
726582176779739136 2016-04-30 01:21:04 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer going to assume only position players. Polanco, Mastrioanni and maybe Vargas? Or carry a 3rd C....
726579311642288128 2016-04-30 01:09:41 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer nice - Sheehan has brought up the idea of expanded roster with 2-3 inactive for 3 years now. I'm a big fan as well.

725518360679579648 2016-04-27 02:53:51 UTC <BK432> Oh, and it looks like the NDSU QB is going #2 now. Whatever.

725493493594869760 2016-04-27 01:15:02 UTC <BK432> That was a tough call on 2-2 but Berrios responds to get the pop-up.
725491669752147968 2016-04-27 01:07:47 UTC <BK432> Nice little cushion for Berrios. Let's keep it going boys #MNTwins

725161354060042242 2016-04-26 03:15:14 UTC <BK432> See, now this is a quality baseball take. Jepsen was garbage all inning.https://twitter.com/mattkummer/status/725154997290295296
725160384810868737 2016-04-26 03:11:23 UTC <BK432> Just to be clear, I don't waste my time arguing baseball with people who  call Brian Dozier a a weak contact hitter. #NowYouKnow
725158591611715588 2016-04-26 03:04:15 UTC <BK432> @Sodjacket @Bill_TPA @Brandon_Warne okay you're blocked. Buh-bye.
725158472086638593 2016-04-26 03:03:47 UTC <BK432> Thank you Mr. Jepsen for making it interesting and 'winning' this ballgame.
725158152728133632 2016-04-26 03:02:31 UTC <BK432> @Sodjacket @Bill_TPA @Brandon_Warne sorry, go elsewhere for your sustenance young fella
725157870233378817 2016-04-26 03:01:23 UTC <BK432> @Bill_TPA @Brandon_Warne @Sodjacket was just wondering the same thing. Don't feed the trolls, guys.
725157631501979648 2016-04-26 03:00:26 UTC <BK432> They'll walk Mauer
725157049991106562 2016-04-26 02:58:08 UTC <BK432> That was a a great catch and tag by Kipnis. Wow.
725156502764441600 2016-04-26 02:55:57 UTC <BK432> Danny was very lucky that was a high throw. Hopefully he got in there.
725154598718152704 2016-04-26 02:48:23 UTC <BK432> I'll leave this herehttps://twitter.com/BK432/status/725138445178404870
725154357520523264 2016-04-26 02:47:26 UTC <BK432> Joe Mauer is once again a legitimately very good baseball player.
725153768958992385 2016-04-26 02:45:05 UTC <BK432> He's just so dreamy....https://twitter.com/Pirates/status/725153671923773440
725152535821074432 2016-04-26 02:40:11 UTC <BK432> Oh my god this is everyone's Facebook feed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHS-K7OuLAc
725150101296013313 2016-04-26 02:30:31 UTC <BK432> And.....Casey Fien.....come in and gets two outs with a runner at 2nd. Huh. Wasn't expecting that!
725148436627070976 2016-04-26 02:23:54 UTC <BK432> Whatever the hell pitch that was had no movement, no life.
725145732097953792 2016-04-26 02:13:09 UTC <BK432> I literally have the greatest 3 year old boy in the history of history. He makes being a parent so easy. #Leo
725145143175712768 2016-04-26 02:10:49 UTC <BK432> Well, he's hardly been great, but Nolasco will leave with the lead and an ok start
725141453219991552 2016-04-26 01:56:09 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man no question that has been the other weak spot. Unfortunately it's a little worse now with B-Bux at AAA.
725138445178404870 2016-04-26 01:44:12 UTC <BK432> This is kind of ridiculous I admit, and rest of team hasn't been perfect, but if pen is passable this is a .500 ball team right now #MNTwins
725138096199729154 2016-04-26 01:42:49 UTC <BK432> Nevertheless, another ball absolutely stung by Park. Nice play by Lindor, but this middle of the lineup....man. Appointment TV.
725103032870936577 2016-04-26 23:23:29 UTC <BK432> @Brent_Watson41 I would be a little annoyed if I were you. It'll melt like in a day but still...
725047022454083584 2016-04-26 19:40:55 UTC <BK432> @mightympls that's in your settings. You're probably already tipping, you shouldn't have to do anything.
725018125217861632 2016-04-26 17:46:05 UTC <BK432> It can, in fact, be too early. Like today. Today is like a year too early.https://twitter.com/espn/status/725017876407541760
725016647321296901 2016-04-26 17:40:13 UTC <BK432> Berrios time, baby. #MNTwins
725014250679316480 2016-04-26 17:30:42 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar especially from a guy who hates to credit others. Blech.
724982845110788096 2016-04-26 15:25:54 UTC <BK432> David Gilmour FTW http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/david-gilmour-prince-comfortably-numb-purple-rain_us_571eb607e4b0f309baee5c98?
724804389278519297 2016-04-25 03:36:47 UTC <BK432> Oswaldo Arcia is one of the most enigmatic players ever. But whatever. Love him tonight.
724804115440766976 2016-04-25 03:35:41 UTC <BK432> WOW!!!

724801717301334016 2016-04-25 03:26:10 UTC <BK432> I think it's safe to say that the LAST thing the Twins need tonight is an extra inning affair.....

723572930911850496 2016-04-22 18:03:24 UTC <BK432> @KummerA you got some love on this tweet
723349624887484416 2016-04-21 03:16:04 UTC <BK432> @mightympls I'm with you - on everything you said.
723335114470510594 2016-04-21 02:18:24 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer they just came back from commercial, back into Prince
723334552752549888 2016-04-21 02:16:10 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer channel 45 just led the first 15 minutes of their news with Prince coverage.
723333739632160768 2016-04-21 02:12:57 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @DanBarreiroKFAN had him for a good 25 minutes today too - was great radio.
723248512280875008 2016-04-21 20:34:17 UTC <BK432> Love that inning for the #MNTwins. Buxton doing his thing, Polanco doing 2-strike sac fly, and a #dozboom. Cool.
722986119193710594 2016-04-20 03:11:37 UTC <BK432> Missed the tip till replay - wow.
722981410651271170 2016-04-20 02:52:55 UTC <BK432> Chris Carter = 3 true outcomes. Don't like that outcome.
722981186377637890 2016-04-20 02:52:01 UTC <BK432> Just when Arcia had started to get back in some good graces....that is just awful fundamentals.
722979512338636800 2016-04-20 02:45:22 UTC <BK432> @LValsvik @Twins you can also try http://foxsportsgo.com - you should be able to stream it there
722979267450048512 2016-04-20 02:44:24 UTC <BK432> @LValsvik @Twins no good! I wonder if you have have a certain tier of service??
722978618566008832 2016-04-20 02:41:49 UTC <BK432> @LValsvik @Twins FSN alternate: 668-2
722978549351632896 2016-04-20 02:41:33 UTC <BK432> I guess after 7 straight misses, it needs to be right down the middle. That pitch didn't miss....
722977958084796416 2016-04-20 02:39:12 UTC <BK432> Oh Dick Bremer....
722976966614249472 2016-04-20 02:35:15 UTC <BK432> Nelson's AB was worth two outs and putting the tying run in scoring position. I seriously don't get it at all.
722976174264045568 2016-04-20 02:32:06 UTC <BK432> @Patrick_Fenelon it's always very strange to me in uncapped scenarios why people care about the money. Who gives a shit?
722975379892264960 2016-04-20 02:28:57 UTC <BK432> I mean, he gets 3 more outs MAXIMUM, right? Why would the Brewers give up an out for that?
722975225663492097 2016-04-20 02:28:20 UTC <BK432> Why was Jimmy Nelson in the box after 6 IP and 4 runs?
722974418738155521 2016-04-20 02:25:08 UTC <BK432> I love that by playing Aaron Hill, the Brewers are announcing "we aren't trying." And then he goes yard.
722972545431920642 2016-04-20 02:17:41 UTC <BK432> Man, just like that it's a new ballgame.https://twitter.com/SethTweets/status/722972447444635649
722972059953844225 2016-04-20 02:15:45 UTC <BK432> That was a shot. Wowie.
722971867456233472 2016-04-20 02:15:00 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan @MNfanfromafar @Brandon_Warne @jeremynygaard  we're both quick on the internets
722959140021104640 2016-04-20 01:24:25 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan @MNfanfromafar @Brandon_Warne @jeremynygaard  I think Brandon is correct http://apple.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa-PLUTO.exe?A2=ind9704&L=TWINS&P=123698
722957853636452352 2016-04-20 01:19:18 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne @jeremynygaard @MNfanfromafar no way, Snapper Mow 'Em Down Inning was striking out the side in order. Nothing else!
722950552095555584 2016-04-20 00:50:18 UTC <BK432> I guess I don't really care about Dozier's running there. What I do care about is how bad Jimmy Nelson's toss was. WTF was that?
722859412340125696 2016-04-20 18:48:08 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood I had to look up who that was. And then I was like "oh yeah!"
722527148716609536 2016-04-19 20:47:50 UTC <BK432> Michael Strahan co-hosting Good Morning America is something that makes sense now but time travel to 2005 and try to explain it.
722283380751118336 2016-04-18 04:39:12 UTC <BK432> Going to bed. 4-9 y'allhttps://twitter.com/tylermason21/status/722283284856762368
722281890430980096 2016-04-18 04:33:16 UTC <BK432> @KummerA seriously....I'm about ready to go to bed. No way they play...
722269657093259264 2016-04-18 03:44:40 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man at least it's a weeknight though
722268797407772673 2016-04-18 03:41:15 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man how dare you
722264408265748481 2016-04-18 03:23:48 UTC <BK432> I hope @Lkummer is cool sleeping on the couch for a while. Don't really want to go to bed after the Wild win and Twins in delay...
722264094259220481 2016-04-18 03:22:33 UTC <BK432> Don't want to be a Debbie downer....but Wild....do it again on Wednesday or it's all for naught. You still have a hill to climb.
722262982240157696 2016-04-18 03:18:08 UTC <BK432> Hell of a steal and shot from mid-ice. The Pommer.https://twitter.com/Russostrib/status/722262890166755329
722261263745728513 2016-04-18 03:11:18 UTC <BK432> @johnkriesel they are. And they're the same ones taking pot shots at the Twins all season long.
722259333489303552 2016-04-18 03:03:38 UTC <BK432> And if Parise and the boys wanna keep lamenting "negativity" fine, but this crowd has responded when they actually saw quality hockey.
722258728309776384 2016-04-18 03:01:14 UTC <BK432> Honest to god, where has this Wild team been? No way this is the team I've watched the last couple weeks.
722258297454247936 2016-04-18 02:59:31 UTC <BK432> I'm not seeing how this rain delay doesn't turn into a rain-shortened final. Gonna be raining for a while.
722257113658036224 2016-04-18 02:54:49 UTC <BK432> @xylemmaster attaboy. Hope the liquor is tasty and the tax result is a refund
722256538568650752 2016-04-18 02:52:32 UTC <BK432> Unreal. Wild lead by 2. Consider me SHOCKED at this point. #Koivu
722255943312875521 2016-04-18 02:50:10 UTC <BK432> I wonder how many times in NHL history a team has lost 7 games in a row before winning a playoff game. Cross fingers Wild do it tonight
722254470873223168 2016-04-18 02:44:19 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @Plouffe24Fan or ever. I'd rather watch a game in snow than with the roof closed. Metrodome ruined my childhood.
722253236539940866 2016-04-18 02:39:25 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer in the same vein I guess he thinks it's better than Wrigley, Fenway, PNC, Petco....unreal.
722253066473455617 2016-04-18 02:38:44 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah, the occasional rain delay/rainout in no way diminishes the stark differences between the two parks. TF is far superior.
722252306721480705 2016-04-18 02:35:43 UTC <BK432> Radar doesn't make it look like this rain is going to stop anytime soon. Rain-shortened 7-4 win? I'd take it...
722249580520345600 2016-04-18 02:24:53 UTC <BK432> You can't stop Joe Mauer right now. You can only hope to contain him.
722248955489349637 2016-04-18 02:22:24 UTC <BK432> Love that double from Dozier. The bats are heating up for sure.
722245718099025920 2016-04-18 02:09:32 UTC <BK432> I'm done. Let's drink some whiskey (no seriously, I'm going to drink some whiskey).https://twitter.com/BK432/status/722194435145134081
722194435145134081 2016-04-18 22:45:45 UTC <BK432> It's fine guys, I still have 6 hours to finish my taxes....

721418727569387521 2016-04-16 19:23:22 UTC <BK432> Well Plouffe is definitely getting his poop in a group.
721418505451646976 2016-04-16 19:22:29 UTC <BK432> Carrier is going with a "in this economy...." line in their commercial. I don't think they know what that means.
721188785468235776 2016-04-15 04:09:40 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man oooh, export it to California, sell high
721188185607241728 2016-04-15 04:07:17 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @CommonManKFAN @BMileskiKFAN I figured but was really hoping so.
721187977267773441 2016-04-15 04:06:27 UTC <BK432> I love the Omega Block - all apologies to North Dakota and all...

721182159625527296 2016-04-15 03:43:20 UTC <BK432> Twins will now relax and start putting some runs on the board.
721181609525809152 2016-04-15 03:41:09 UTC <BK432> I am certain this is true https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/721181498716655616

721181320492093440 2016-04-15 03:40:00 UTC <BK432> One more strike, one more out, whatever....end the pain.
721177625901707264 2016-04-15 03:25:19 UTC <BK432> Please, can Dozier hit for Suzuki??
721176909099327493 2016-04-15 03:22:28 UTC <BK432> Way to stroke it, Park! Please, let's get him in too. Let's pad the lead, boys.
721176758024671232 2016-04-15 03:21:52 UTC <BK432> FUCK YES!
721175610333106177 2016-04-15 03:17:18 UTC <BK432> It's more fun to watch baseball when the team you root for can get hits.
721174386934308868 2016-04-15 03:12:27 UTC <BK432> exhale
721173905340125184 2016-04-15 03:10:32 UTC <BK432> [talking himself into the idea that Casey Fien can luck his way into getting an out]
721167452923494400 2016-04-15 02:44:54 UTC <BK432> I already got my QS out of Richards, so yeah, let's go Twins!
721167009703006209 2016-04-15 02:43:08 UTC <BK432> Well hot damn, these Twins are showin' some fight
721164622695260160 2016-04-15 02:33:39 UTC <BK432> @Lkummer come on....you know me well enough by now
721163373371482112 2016-04-15 02:28:41 UTC <BK432> Was super happy with my decision to pause game while putting kid to bed with Sano at plate.....until now I'm not. Sheesh.
721153415397666816 2016-04-15 01:49:07 UTC <BK432> @Lkummer this is hard to stomach, no?https://twitter.com/BK432/status/721153076443406336
721153076443406336 2016-04-15 01:47:46 UTC <BK432> Been doing some odd Friday night research. Mind is a bit blown that the same kid voices Zuma from Paw Patrol and Romeo from PJ Masks.
721120915765891073 2016-04-15 23:39:58 UTC <BK432> Excellenthttps://twitter.com/SethTweets/status/721119152300134400
721092529735802881 2016-04-15 21:47:10 UTC <BK432> This just feels weird https://twitter.com/ZacharyBD/status/721092349913247744
721063876071022592 2016-04-15 19:53:19 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer how dare you hang out in Montreal without me...
721063339783098368 2016-04-15 19:51:11 UTC <BK432> My god @CommonManKFAN @BMileskiKFAN this is too freaking good. Is this guy for real?? #BRODY
721062709496688640 2016-04-15 19:48:41 UTC <BK432> This Brody guy on the Common Man show has to be a parody - this guy can't be for real....
721054705296678912 2016-04-15 19:16:52 UTC <BK432> Sorry Denver - see @mattkummer no complaininghttps://twitter.com/AerisWeather/status/721032600517632001
721049923039330304 2016-04-15 18:57:52 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I love Clete!
721006245499416576 2016-04-15 16:04:19 UTC <BK432> @Lkummer man you went to Ike's too....totally jealous
720808737393344512 2016-04-14 02:59:29 UTC <BK432> That's about as perfect a poke check as one can execute.
720805597721944064 2016-04-14 02:47:01 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin looks like you and Maddox back in the day
720690307730419712 2016-04-14 19:08:53 UTC <BK432> That throw was unreal - I spit out my beer! https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/720690122379759616
720676145352568832 2016-04-14 18:12:37 UTC <BK432> Oh nohttps://twitter.com/CoryProvus/status/720675704380063744
720581944875081728 2016-04-14 11:58:18 UTC <BK432> Just sit and absorb this for a minutehttps://twitter.com/AlexKennedyNBA/status/720490295679455236
720441430204878848 2016-04-13 02:39:56 UTC <BK432> @hmspinniped FOX Trax is awful. FSN has to use it but seriously they'd be better off drawing a strike zone and guessing.
720438549452087297 2016-04-13 02:28:29 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer overmatched for now - it's a slump. They're not this bad.
720438269566128128 2016-04-13 02:27:23 UTC <BK432> That was not patience.
720438096773451776 2016-04-13 02:26:42 UTC <BK432> Nate Jones throws some nasty heat. Patience, Miguel.
720437447365169153 2016-04-13 02:24:07 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer bad time to go through a team wide slump - if this happens in July, it's just not under the microscope
720433717555175426 2016-04-13 02:09:17 UTC <BK432> Holy crap - the Pelicans decided to play all-star game defense or something?
720392004052451328 2016-04-13 23:23:32 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne he's a hack. Plain and simple.
720377280841691138 2016-04-13 22:25:02 UTC <BK432> @tlschwerz true - don't NEED to source it. But giving credit to those doing the work is never a bad idea.
720375751317549056 2016-04-13 22:18:57 UTC <BK432> @tlschwerz @Brandon_Warne if it's just about sharing the lineup Ted, why not RT somebody getting the info first hand?
720334080257056769 2016-04-13 19:33:22 UTC <BK432> My coworker: "The co-op is a magical place."
720304215331966977 2016-04-13 17:34:42 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin @spike @FXNetworks @gaulstone JERRY JERRY JERRY!
720297265793884160 2016-04-13 17:07:05 UTC <BK432> yeah, that's where we're at. I was hoping this would happen, though I guess I'd prefer Chargois.https://twitter.com/MNfanfromafar/status/720292182188371968
720291119066533889 2016-04-13 16:42:39 UTC <BK432> @gaulstone your guess is as good as mine. Hope not!
720091666057707520 2016-04-12 03:30:06 UTC <BK432> That was shockinghttps://twitter.com/jasoncollette/status/720091590899986432
720087200092827649 2016-04-12 03:12:21 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood total amazement. I need to go to McDonald's more in the middle of the night.
720081204716945408 2016-04-12 02:48:32 UTC <BK432> If Trevor Story gets an AB this inning and doesn't hit a homer I'm f'ing dropping him....
720055691822678016 2016-04-12 01:07:09 UTC <BK432> I'll admit it's a SSS but the kid is ready. Let's slide someone to the DL pronto.https://twitter.com/SethTweets/status/720055083073822720
719962851763294208 2016-04-12 18:58:14 UTC <BK432> Already has gotten tons of buzz, but this is a must-read from @talkhoops. Amazing read. http://www.cbssports.com/nba/feature/25551583
719657207332114433 2016-04-11 22:43:43 UTC <BK432> @MNfanfromafar I have a pretty low bar. Says a lot that he couldn't overcome it.
719656362481815554 2016-04-11 22:40:22 UTC <BK432> We're done. Two 9-year olds behind me just called Mauer's contract an anchor.
719653499940634624 2016-04-11 22:28:59 UTC <BK432> Had to unfollow Ted. His takes have gotten borderline awful.
719653207794843648 2016-04-11 22:27:49 UTC <BK432> @hmspinniped Plouffe screwed up
719652365977030656 2016-04-11 22:24:29 UTC <BK432> He would have been out by 15 feet https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/719652263468204033
719645631606865925 2016-04-11 21:57:43 UTC <BK432> Man @gottlightmpls where you're sitting is for the birds. Find some sun!
719628008777248768 2016-04-11 20:47:41 UTC <BK432> Well I got to witness history....Eddie Rosario just walked
719623763789262848 2016-04-11 20:30:49 UTC <BK432> I actually didn't hear anyone curse Mauer out after the GIDP so perhaps our fan base is making progress
719621608068030464 2016-04-11 20:22:15 UTC <BK432> We eked out 42 at first pitch. Beautiful out here #MNTwins
719616157955813376 2016-04-11 20:00:36 UTC <BK432> @jeremynygaard you did a good job #ImNotAtAllCreepyIPromise
719608238090620929 2016-04-11 19:29:08 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 come on out to Minnie and Paul's if you get a chance
719608109900107779 2016-04-11 19:28:37 UTC <BK432> @gaulstone @kellerjustin I think he's a little busy right now
719607889539768322 2016-04-11 19:27:45 UTC <BK432> @Lkummer oh I totally have more hair than him.
719607200289832960 2016-04-11 19:25:00 UTC <BK432> @Audra_Martin glad you're here
719590401267654656 2016-04-11 18:18:15 UTC <BK432> Like a bosshttps://twitter.com/TFEATS/status/719589902724292608
719590339510722560 2016-04-11 18:18:00 UTC <BK432> Guys...Minnie & Paul's in CF is awesome. It's the new cool kids spot to have a beer (and pouting) and watch baseball. #MNTwins
719580416349487106 2016-04-11 17:38:35 UTC <BK432> It's a bit of a party out herehttps://twitter.com/RandBall/status/719580228058615808
719577130871472128 2016-04-11 17:25:31 UTC <BK432> Dude....seriously?https://twitter.com/tlschwerz/status/719562787060469760
719576696811364352 2016-04-11 17:23:48 UTC <BK432> I love this day. I get to be such a rube. In line waiting till 1 PM #MNTwins
719543107700662273 2016-04-11 15:10:19 UTC <BK432> No, I'm not going to watch that. I started to gag just thinking about it.https://twitter.com/UPROXXSports/status/719542534087819265
719487967773863937 2016-04-11 11:31:13 UTC <BK432> Can't wait to get back inside at about 1  today!https://twitter.com/Twins/status/719484315285848064
719355952382672896 2016-04-10 02:46:38 UTC <BK432> This is so underrated and maybe my favorite Family Guy moment http://moby.to/lvn156
719354704711458817 2016-04-10 02:41:41 UTC <BK432> Looking at the chances, I guess I'd prefer 44 to 40....https://twitter.com/CodyMatzFox9/status/719349757957644289
719338377288351745 2016-04-10 01:36:48 UTC <BK432> It's right there now for the Warriors. A home win against a decent team like Memphis isn't a gimme, but they should be motivated.
719287709970337795 2016-04-10 22:15:28 UTC <BK432> Too bad that Twins have actually played pretty good. Bullpen has let them down big time - and the lineup's lack of contact hasn't helped.
719273409423794176 2016-04-10 21:18:38 UTC <BK432> @mightympls @mattkummer need to see much more baseball to definitively say, but signs don't look good.
719271940821790721 2016-04-10 21:12:48 UTC <BK432> Apologies to @mattkummer - Perkins looks pretty awful out there.
719271523803119618 2016-04-10 21:11:09 UTC <BK432> Wow, that is really disappointing....
719268938299875333 2016-04-10 21:00:52 UTC <BK432> Impressive walk for Kepler.
719259380223488000 2016-04-10 20:22:54 UTC <BK432> The response HR from Dozier was very tasty. Twins really needed that.
718900156779724800 2016-04-09 20:35:28 UTC <BK432> I'll flat out admit it....I don't know what goes on during a pedicure, but I have no idea how they take 2+ hours.
718890792648118277 2016-04-09 19:58:15 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin @kellerkrista it's just the proper thing to do
718643740588511233 2016-04-08 03:36:34 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan 9 leagues! Wow. Yes, and he probably would have caught enough games for eligibility next year (if you play keepers)
718643547696730116 2016-04-08 03:35:48 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne I'm in the same spot. I mean, even if that was a Dozier call there, I almost think of bringing in Arcia after the SB.
718642499288436736 2016-04-08 03:31:38 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan tough luck on Schwarbs
718641959146024964 2016-04-08 03:29:29 UTC <BK432> If he hurt my roto catcher, so help me, so help me
718641698503585792 2016-04-08 03:28:27 UTC <BK432> Even his catcher can't believe Davis threw a fastball!!

718639627301756928 2016-04-08 03:20:13 UTC <BK432> I don't care what the result of this at-bat is, the fact that Arcia has yet to pinch hit is criminal.
718639447835877376 2016-04-08 03:19:30 UTC <BK432> National media is catching on....https://twitter.com/matthewpouliot/status/718639341359116288
718639180599975936 2016-04-08 03:18:26 UTC <BK432> Really nice at-bat from Dozier. Wow.
718638794136797192 2016-04-08 03:16:54 UTC <BK432> Wha? How did Dozier even get a piece of that???
718638282356191232 2016-04-08 03:14:52 UTC <BK432> How about for Santana?https://twitter.com/jeremynygaard/status/718638159110750208
718635857452888064 2016-04-08 03:05:14 UTC <BK432> Kevin. Jepsen.
718635258732802048 2016-04-08 03:02:51 UTC <BK432> For some reason I get a kick out of seeing fans in the background on slow mo replays looking at their phones. I always look for it.
718634166066290688 2016-04-08 02:58:31 UTC <BK432> I wouldn't have bet on a Suzuki triple. Gotta love ball.
718633816584282113 2016-04-08 02:57:08 UTC <BK432> We're not PAYING you to just lay the bat down, son.https://twitter.com/glp_vt/status/718633666969251840
718633248180592640 2016-04-08 02:54:52 UTC <BK432> There we go - Park just crushed that.
718632397726748672 2016-04-08 02:51:29 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer the league figures out hitters all the time. The good ones adjust and learn. Sano seems like he can do it.
718632035544403968 2016-04-08 02:50:03 UTC <BK432> Frankly, neither was I.
718631976320835584 2016-04-08 02:49:49 UTC <BK432> Wow. Morales wasn't expecting that at all.
718630594876436480 2016-04-08 02:44:19 UTC <BK432> I didn't think guys wearing the Royals jersey struck out. Odd.
718621102914854912 2016-04-08 02:06:36 UTC <BK432> Big hit there, Ed. Attaboy.
718616759742394368 2016-04-08 01:49:21 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls nice to see you back on the twitter
718600790890442752 2016-04-08 00:45:54 UTC <BK432> He'll learn. Just a rookie mistake there. https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/718600692374597632
718600556038787073 2016-04-08 00:44:58 UTC <BK432> Nice knock by Suzuki but damn, slow your roll, Zuke. Eyes up.
718596169107169280 2016-04-08 00:27:32 UTC <BK432> Everyone....Sano went around. Stop it.
718572896998830080 2016-04-08 22:55:03 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @mattkummer it took me back to all the awkward long silences of our childhood...
718572197309231106 2016-04-08 22:52:16 UTC <BK432> @CheapSeatChron @SethTweets I own Hundley in my NL only - if he gets enough ABs can be a nice value for cheap.
718571904739708932 2016-04-08 22:51:07 UTC <BK432> @CheapSeatChron @SethTweets would have given the exact same advice. Montero available in many because of lack of ABs. Part of that now gone
718571255214051328 2016-04-08 22:48:32 UTC <BK432> @NickGeorge2 yes. Not discounting any of it - but only 140 characters to tweet. Probably wasn't clear.
718570320530173952 2016-04-08 22:44:49 UTC <BK432> Extreme Flyball Hitter + Decent Power + Coors Field = Trevor Story  Still, this is a 'beyond expectations' debut week.
718509692226383872 2016-04-08 18:43:54 UTC <BK432> @LilBKFAN its literally not going to happen unless he's ready. Worth a try the way they suggested. If he's ready, it'll happen. If not, nope

717536930410397697 2016-04-05 02:18:30 UTC <BK432> Those behind Bernie are probably an average of 21 years old. They identify with the guy.

717533699730964480 2016-04-05 02:05:39 UTC <BK432> @ERolfPleiss I'm with you
717490593698590720 2016-04-05 23:14:22 UTC <BK432> It's a Bends night. Always makes me feel better on a really tough day. #PowerOfRadiohead
717489516764913664 2016-04-05 23:10:05 UTC <BK432> This is maybe the best thing ever http://deadspin.com/there-are-two-ninja-turtles-behind-home-plate-thanks-to-1769155451
717487631769210880 2016-04-05 23:02:36 UTC <BK432> Didn't get past the first photo without mistiness. Well done, @DanBarreiroKFAN http://kfan.iheart.com/onair/dan-barreiro-11904/ode-to-rainy-14570432/
717422611161030656 2016-04-05 18:44:14 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer it's already been a very nice late winter/early spring. That would continue the trend.
717353669931450369 2016-04-05 14:10:17 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc thanks. Just prayers for the family. They need all they can get.
717348218695233536 2016-04-05 13:48:37 UTC <BK432> @angeladallman thank you. That's very sweet of you.
717340617257431040 2016-04-05 13:18:25 UTC <BK432> Not much negativity comes from this account, but pretty damn hard to feel up right now. Just awful for my friend, his kids & his late wife.
717339991349846017 2016-04-05 13:15:56 UTC <BK432> I'm a proven optimist, but sometimes life really sucks. Moms just shouldn't die and not get the chance to raise their kids.
717326368686678016 2016-04-05 12:21:48 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer did you wear your TedHead shirt while you pulled the lever for Cruz?
717320920587747328 2016-04-05 12:00:09 UTC <BK432> Whoo man, Delta, you can tell me it's Starbucks coffee, but if you're using piss water then it really doesn't matter #MayAsWellBeFolgers
717313486834032640 2016-04-05 11:30:36 UTC <BK432> Huhhttps://twitter.com/business/status/717308529061851136
717294524549218304 2016-04-05 10:15:15 UTC <BK432> Yeah, it's just after 5 AM but MSP seems dead this morning. Room to stretch out!
717192218910539777 2016-04-04 03:28:44 UTC <BK432> Now that was a final.
717191445778731008 2016-04-04 03:25:40 UTC <BK432> What.....the hell....was that
717191246616219648 2016-04-04 03:24:52 UTC <BK432> You have to go for a 3. Bill is wrong.
717188105116196864 2016-04-04 03:12:23 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 following that too on my phone. Pretty damn incredible debut so far
717183438374174720 2016-04-04 02:53:50 UTC <BK432> How about some of these moves from these Nova kids? Perfectly executing the moves we learned as kids...
717182009395843072 2016-04-04 02:48:10 UTC <BK432> Just bad timing I guesshttps://twitter.com/nickpiecoro/status/717181814855446531
717181821109317633 2016-04-04 02:47:25 UTC <BK432> This is a legitimately fantastic title game. Really fun to watch.
717180356777082881 2016-04-04 02:41:36 UTC <BK432> Hehhttps://twitter.com/jay_jaffe/status/717178195519385601
717141827036569601 2016-04-04 00:08:30 UTC <BK432> @Seth_Kaplan congrats man!
717124782551134208 2016-04-04 23:00:46 UTC <BK432> And as an aside, those who are tweeting every time Sano catches a routine flyball are really starting to get on my nerves.
717124644277497856 2016-04-04 23:00:13 UTC <BK432> Boy, Pressly has given Twins two nice innings. Looks good, impressive velo.
717114404622450689 2016-04-04 22:19:32 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah. At least Sano and Park will take a walk. Rosario is allergic to them.
717113901813538816 2016-04-04 22:17:32 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer sure, I suppose. Any lineup with Sano and Park is probably destined for that.
717113532689592320 2016-04-04 22:16:04 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I wouldn't consider contact rate to be an issue 6 batters into the season.
717113265655062528 2016-04-04 22:15:00 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer true - Tillman seemed OK though
717112491428487168 2016-04-04 22:11:55 UTC <BK432> The way Santana was getting rocked perhaps we're better off. He didn't look super sharp.https://twitter.com/MikeBerardino/status/717112173621809153
717084034858229760 2016-04-04 20:18:51 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer just checked 15 day forecast for both of us. We're a bit warmer. But this spring is not complaint worthy at all. Not even close.
716963943537836032 2016-04-04 12:21:39 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc knew what we needed but I couldn't have guessed it would move the needle to that extent. Wow. We really are a threat.
716963748481736704 2016-04-04 12:20:52 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 yeah that's their team name.!I guess some guys never grow up.
716818486627069952 2016-04-03 02:43:39 UTC <BK432> Wow....hey @grahamatc here are the post-auction ZiPS projections I ran on our leaguepic.twitter.com/DxPyaHMyVv
716805613662113792 2016-04-03 01:52:30 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer that's not the long range forecast I've seen....and don't tweet an 8 day outlook as evidence.
716779547870498816 2016-04-03 00:08:55 UTC <BK432> That's a pretty crazy intrastate high temp spreadhttps://twitter.com/dkayserwx/status/716775648476266496
716484308370849792 2016-04-02 04:35:45 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood wow - bringing me back!!

716446625531621376 2016-04-02 02:06:01 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc I think Gibby will have a surprisingly good year. Trending up for sure.
716441982197972992 2016-04-02 01:47:34 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc added Kyle Gibson as well. And a couple other guys.
716441835732905984 2016-04-02 01:46:59 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc got the top closer on the board in Kenley Jansen. Filled some SB/AVG gaps with Brett Gardner/Justin Turner
716330274854821888 2016-04-02 18:23:40 UTC <BK432> Last roto auction about to start. Not many roster spots to fill, not many dollars. Need SV+HD and SB. Let's roll.
716246916317712384 2016-04-02 12:52:26 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer that's a kick in the nards. Still, it will melt in a day or two.
716030494085754880 2016-04-01 22:32:27 UTC <BK432> Tanner Roark looks like he may finally fulfill his promise this year. Looks great through 2.
716027628214353920 2016-04-01 22:21:04 UTC <BK432> Nats broadcast showing fWAR leaders from last year. MASN does a nice broadcast.
716027246574592000 2016-04-01 22:19:33 UTC <BK432> @mightympls no contest.
716027133630357504 2016-04-01 22:19:06 UTC <BK432> Eh, don't worry Hughes-ie. It's only Bryce at the dish now.

715209393214660609 2016-03-30 16:09:41 UTC <BK432> I want #Justice4Jamar but I don't know what that is. We do know his death is a true tragedy.
715209232564420608 2016-03-30 16:09:03 UTC <BK432> Agree or disagree, I believe Mike Freeman has handled this decision well. No grand jury was correct decision.
715198434286772225 2016-03-30 15:26:09 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 excellent - he seems like he will get a legit opportunity.
714933780293795840 2016-03-29 21:54:30 UTC <BK432> Huge thanks and adulation to @FLOWknight2. I brought everything to fantasy auction....except computer. Lucky Wolf works at same place as me.

714191366759133184 2016-03-27 20:44:25 UTC <BK432> 8 days. 8 days until the Twins open it up in Baltimore. Very, very ready.
714185244421672960 2016-03-27 20:20:05 UTC <BK432> @WarneUnfiltered @NoDakTwinsFan I'd take it.
714184902258745346 2016-03-27 20:18:44 UTC <BK432> He ain't gonna turn into Corey Kluber, but Gibson looks ready to take a very big step. Would be huge for the squad.https://twitter.com/NoDakTwinsFan/status/714184470463700992
714184668547928064 2016-03-27 20:17:48 UTC <BK432> Well, this is truly depressing... http://nypost.com/2016/03/27/greedy-parents-ruin-easter-egg-hunt-leaving-kids-in-the-dust/

713397831298494466 2016-03-25 16:11:11 UTC <BK432> Um.....wow. I guess I'm glad I was born in 1979? https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/713397413327802368

713208543831322624 2016-03-24 03:39:02 UTC <BK432> @tlschwerz I panicked for a second after realizing the dual nature of the name!
713207421481648128 2016-03-24 03:34:34 UTC <BK432> @tlschwerz and I mean Aaron Eldred, not Aaron Gleeman
713207331878801409 2016-03-24 03:34:13 UTC <BK432> @tlschwerz tweets like Aaron's are some of the dumbest I see on Twitter. And he has no idea why.
713198648075677696 2016-03-24 02:59:42 UTC <BK432> For those pesky "Joe Mauer is soft, he should be catching" arguments, keep this site in mind (h/t @robmonroe)  http://isjoemauercatchingtoday.com
713194052087365634 2016-03-24 02:41:27 UTC <BK432> It's just really weird that fans can't just sit back and enjoy a really good player. https://twitter.com/AaronGleeman/status/713193458761142272
713192477168123904 2016-03-24 02:35:11 UTC <BK432> @Brandon_Warne @robmonroe @daynperry this should come in handy on the Star Tribune comment boards....
713187316672675840 2016-03-24 02:14:41 UTC <BK432> I love this. People just love to say things they don't know are true. Esp. about Joe Mauer for some reason.https://twitter.com/PhilMackey/status/713186859015233536
713186680845570048 2016-03-24 02:12:09 UTC <BK432> Wild look great tonight. Just in time, man. But that might get overturned.
713173606340116481 2016-03-24 01:20:12 UTC <BK432> @bennyc50 I often want your life.

712826590045061120 2016-03-23 02:21:17 UTC <BK432> @KummerA you're right - did you make it up to six inches?
712809804427878400 2016-03-23 01:14:35 UTC <BK432> Yephttps://twitter.com/MPRweather/status/712799749653602306
712763033441976320 2016-03-23 22:08:44 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I would doubt they'd do that with Duffey. I think they'd stash him at AAA and have him start.
712761852665720832 2016-03-23 22:04:02 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan @NickNelsonMN I think Rogers already got sent down
712761191358181376 2016-03-23 22:01:25 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer if Nolasco is in, who's out? Is Duffey going to AAA?
712754031991631873 2016-03-23 21:32:58 UTC <BK432> @KummerA the cutoff even from Edina to Golden Valley is ridiculous. 2-3 inches in Edina. This at 55/100pic.twitter.com/pisSJWre6N
712477555215962112 2016-03-22 03:14:21 UTC <BK432> This is truehttps://twitter.com/Plouffe24Fan/status/712477289741754368
712477516452208640 2016-03-22 03:14:11 UTC <BK432> Well, that's a huge win for the Wild.
712433922781609985 2016-03-22 00:20:58 UTC <BK432> @KummerA what do you think about these model discrepancies and gradients? There could literally be inches of difference between our houses.
712104003090382848 2016-03-21 02:29:59 UTC <BK432> Great effort by Wiggins on the board but probably could have gotten a better shot....
711749579696435200 2016-03-20 03:01:38 UTC <BK432> Huh - picked a good time to work for 2 hours. Missed some good basketball it looks like.

711239633812652032 2016-03-19 17:15:17 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yeah, I found that one odd. I agree with you.
711237599214444544 2016-03-19 17:07:12 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer kowtow? Nope. Needs to be rules, guardrails, consequences.  But there's also incredibly talented people you don't want to lose.
711237443383468033 2016-03-19 17:06:35 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer I think the onus is on everyone to make it work. Anything less is a recipe for disengagement.
711235217307017216 2016-03-19 16:57:44 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer yes, they need to learn to assimilate. But you're fighting a losing battle if you just draw a line in the sand...
711206457224646657 2016-03-19 15:03:27 UTC <BK432> If true, if he was a 'leader', then the Sox roster should be ashamed of themselves.https://twitter.com/PhilMackey/status/711206052528656384

710676150356484096 2016-03-17 03:56:12 UTC <BK432> @MinnySportsFan but basketball players have to attend 1 year, football players 3 years. They don't have that choice.
710675159846428672 2016-03-17 03:52:16 UTC <BK432> @MinnySportsFan @WarneUnfiltered NCAA makes so much money off these kids and it's okay because <1% of them can make money post-grad? Weird.
710674867851550721 2016-03-17 03:51:06 UTC <BK432> @MinnySportsFan @WarneUnfiltered can't help saying this is bizarre argument. "We won't pay you, but after grad you can make money overseas!"
710600060069806081 2016-03-17 22:53:51 UTC <BK432> That Purdue kid that caught the inbound pass had no idea what the score was. That is a travesty.
710595325258387456 2016-03-17 22:35:02 UTC <BK432> That. Is. Good.https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/710592439883603968
710580565544542210 2016-03-17 21:36:23 UTC <BK432> Well, I did pick Yale so I suppose I can be happy about that. Good freaking game. But they ain't beating Duke.
710579723127029760 2016-03-17 21:33:02 UTC <BK432> Wowhttps://twitter.com/espn/status/710579649672163329

710572780727640065 2016-03-17 21:05:27 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc they gotta close it out here but yeah, feel good about this pick
710568986253983744 2016-03-17 20:50:22 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @RamseySheriff heck yeah! No DUIs for us!!
710568291731832832 2016-03-17 20:47:37 UTC <BK432> @KummerA Yale is athletic too - they can get to the basket and to open spots. They're going to win this game.
710566072605286403 2016-03-17 20:38:48 UTC <BK432> Heck of a jump ball there by the Yale kid. I freaking love good defense.
710560527781462016 2016-03-17 20:16:46 UTC <BK432> Tweeps - I have a great setup at @Rockelmtavern here in P-Town. Great viewing angle to all 4 TVs, each tuned to the appropriate channel
710559570221879296 2016-03-17 20:12:57 UTC <BK432> @shipleykid well, the hard part is over in my opinion
710558538918027264 2016-03-17 20:08:51 UTC <BK432> @KummerA and they're horrible defensively. Hate teams like that.

710553106308685824 2016-03-17 19:47:16 UTC <BK432> Man Iona is pretty terrible defensively.
710552568041058304 2016-03-17 19:45:08 UTC <BK432> Boom. Start of the Pac12 meltdown.https://twitter.com/SethDavisHoops/status/710552413086883841
710550313825017856 2016-03-17 19:36:10 UTC <BK432> This Yale-Baylor game is going to be tight all the way. Yale can move the ball and get to the basket.

710533439087218688 2016-03-17 18:29:07 UTC <BK432> Mom's now on mom duty with the sickie - I'm finally saddled in at the local establishment. No complaints - love #DadLife
710518125146427392 2016-03-17 17:28:16 UTC <BK432> @SethHilgert there will be quite a bit more after Mom gets home (t-minus 20 minutes or so)
710512450798362624 2016-03-17 17:05:43 UTC <BK432> It's getting slightly real in Providence...Dukies are down 6, almost halftime
710493872896356352 2016-03-17 15:51:54 UTC <BK432> @1500ESPNJudd I side with his right to make that decision. But I also side with the Sox completely on their stance.
710493574501109760 2016-03-17 15:50:43 UTC <BK432> 20 Minutes until the start of the best 4 days of the year.

710471675201003520 2016-03-17 14:23:41 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood my immediate thought too. Probably some BS homeschool thing. I don't get why White Sox look like the bad guy on this...

710469488005623808 2016-03-17 14:15:00 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood ha! One could only assume...
710464579461992448 2016-03-17 13:55:30 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc lotta people love Little Rock over Purdue. I'm not buying that one.
710464477435551747 2016-03-17 13:55:05 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc you're not alone on that one. Could happen. But I'm not picking it.
710463208386002945 2016-03-17 13:50:03 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc I don't disagree to some extent but they ended up a tad overseeded IMO and it's a bad matchup for them
710462516497764352 2016-03-17 13:47:18 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc I guess the only other one I think has a decent shot is the late game. Zags have a great shot to beat Seton Hall.
710462213933416448 2016-03-17 13:46:06 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc Yale is a good team that could exploit Baylor
710462058735599616 2016-03-17 13:45:29 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc I do actually give Iona a shot against Iowa State - those MAAC squads can be tough
710461884638502912 2016-03-17 13:44:47 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc day is starting at home! Leo had a fever overnight I am home with him until 1 PM. Then maybe I'll venture somewhere at that point
710456531892875264 2016-03-17 13:23:31 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 cool. I commissioner a full-keeper roto league and play in a full keep roto with minor league rosters. Super fun.
710455763651571712 2016-03-17 13:20:28 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 you play roto at all?
710455719607148544 2016-03-17 13:20:17 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 and now with Reyes situation and his monster spring, he's a solid keep!
710455624094453761 2016-03-17 13:19:55 UTC <BK432> @NathanSchultz79 no question! I stashed him LY due to the Tulo situation and him breaking out at AA & AAA.
710453375435821057 2016-03-17 13:10:58 UTC <BK432> Was tempted to throw Trevor Story back in my keeper league, but he has moved into keeper status at this point.
710448064167813120 2016-03-17 12:49:52 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @Plouffe24Fan yes, most likely.
710316457654140928 2016-03-16 04:06:55 UTC <BK432> A guy in a full-keeper roto baseball league I play in decided to quit. Today. 17 days before the auction. That's pretty awful.
710297895807938560 2016-03-16 02:53:09 UTC <BK432> @Plouffe24Fan @mattkummer at the end of the day, in 2016, he's very ordinary.
710297469532442624 2016-03-16 02:51:28 UTC <BK432> Very possible. I'm not sure he gets claimed if DFA'dhttps://twitter.com/mattkummer/status/710285082351632385

710280343228715010 2016-03-16 01:43:24 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer they look pretty good - chance to be a top 5 AL offense for sure.
710274670805839872 2016-03-16 01:20:52 UTC <BK432> The #MNTwins can definitely bang the ball around. Lineup is looking pretty good...

702650959940288513 2016-02-24 00:26:58 UTC <BK432> @kellerjustin what Hilary needs to do is pick a VP like Cory Booker or Julian Castro that would energize the base. Tough beat then.

700097074373771264 2016-02-17 23:18:44 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc nice try but I really don't care that much :)
700094846854299648 2016-02-17 23:09:53 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc dork :)
699810916452405249 2016-02-16 04:21:38 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc so I think it all serves as an interesting example but to your point, it doesn't serve to do much at this point to dwell on...
699810722155511808 2016-02-16 04:20:52 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc in the 90s, we just didn't have the ability to follow these stories so closely. Could say the same for Kirby Puckett...
699810283158691840 2016-02-16 04:19:08 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc which could be racial but I think likely has more to do with the era in which they committed their transgressions
699810171405651968 2016-02-16 04:18:41 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc both seem to be be living great adulthoods but there seems to be a double-standard in how they are perceived
699810018821021696 2016-02-16 04:18:04 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc kid does horrible things in college and we still hold it against him to this day (Newton)
699809917264334848 2016-02-16 04:17:40 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc right - I think the bigger lesson is: kid does horrible things in college and gets off relatively scott-free (Manning) vs.
699792297379155968 2016-02-16 03:07:39 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc the weird thing is it's an old story. Not sure why it's gaining so much steam now.

699365912042827776 2016-02-15 22:53:21 UTC <BK432> @KummerA I love this - this is the point behind all children's programmingpic.twitter.com/FwzXpMv94f
699355972649627648 2016-02-15 22:13:51 UTC <BK432> @KummerA second, I'm really glad he called out Ryder's two voices. Like in season two, Ryder has suddenly entered puberty. Drives me nuts.
699355816927703041 2016-02-15 22:13:14 UTC <BK432> @KummerA two things - first, he f'd up Zuma. Zuma does NOT drive a racecar, it's like a hovercraft for the water. Stupid Drew.

699050012827906049 2016-02-14 01:58:05 UTC <BK432> @SethTweets I agree - very odd time for the event.
698976956184989702 2016-02-14 21:07:47 UTC <BK432> I predict it will be 2 days maximum before Trump starts crowd-testing this ridiculous conspiracy... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m65rNq0gG9k

698710348686303232 2016-02-13 03:28:23 UTC <BK432> Sorry, that's the best dunk right there. Damn.
698710085191786497 2016-02-13 03:27:20 UTC <BK432> @DanBarreiroKFAN wow, I don't even get what you said to get them going! They have some serious issues....
698709319185993728 2016-02-13 03:24:17 UTC <BK432> It's not just the dunk contest, but seriously becoming a big Lavine fan. Serious trio possibilities with him, Wiggins and KAT.
698697626414358528 2016-02-13 02:37:49 UTC <BK432> I think this is pretty much true. But I'm a Dem who tries not to watch any of them. Waste of time.https://twitter.com/JimCrikket/status/698697387569623041

698594198568767489 2016-02-13 19:46:50 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc I will be after Leo is in bed and we're done with PJ Masks - how far into it are they?

698259416164880384 2016-02-12 21:36:32 UTC <BK432> I realize this is a lot to hope for but if Mauer can just be Mauer-like that solves some problems for this team short term.
698250897642508290 2016-02-12 21:02:41 UTC <BK432> @heatwaveholm @jeffbarthel very true. He did disclose in the article that he perhaps could have said more, but would guess Twins were aware.
698250113907462144 2016-02-12 20:59:34 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel I would advise against that.
698249127763644417 2016-02-12 20:55:39 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel you actually think he doesn't have insurance on that contract? Craziness.....
698248889065824256 2016-02-12 20:54:42 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel he played through it. But when he has 'bilateral leg weakness' and sits out, he gets crushed. Can't win.
698248485733203968 2016-02-12 20:53:06 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel and by the way, he gets paid either way. It has nothing to do with the money. But I know that fact interferes with your reality
698248177959370752 2016-02-12 20:51:53 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel it amazes me how many humans exist that have zero empathy. Whatever. It's your life, dude.
698247271142436868 2016-02-12 20:48:16 UTC <BK432> @jeffbarthel @AaronGleeman all the while moronic fans and media were making fun of him for being 'soft'. What would you have done?
698246652490952704 2016-02-12 20:45:49 UTC <BK432> But they won't. They'll probably say Joe is making excuses. Because people are awful.https://twitter.com/AaronGleeman/status/698243600140922880
697903790695911425 2016-02-11 22:03:24 UTC <BK432> @lana_slygh just warning you that you may regret following me - use a list to filter me out during sporting events.
697858306518446080 2016-02-11 19:02:40 UTC <BK432> This is correct. Angels just need to go for broke and spend through 2020 at this point. It's the window.https://twitter.com/MikeBatesSBN/status/697853802620256256
697626928736444418 2016-02-10 03:43:15 UTC <BK432> Think about how preposterous this question is: would you trade KAT for Love? Amazing how good the youngster is...

697078221490167808 2016-02-09 15:22:53 UTC <BK432> @mreich35 I'm having a hard time stopping laughing at this...
696904653896810497 2016-02-08 03:53:12 UTC <BK432> Models have been showing it, but no one has wanted to say it. Huttner comes closest: early spring is coming.https://twitter.com/MPRweather/status/696848751302942720

696564244813320192 2016-02-07 05:20:32 UTC <BK432> Guy in my roto league wants Correa/Giolito from me via trade and said he'd package "(Kyle) Seager and something else". Bizarre.
696558349484216320 2016-02-07 04:57:06 UTC <BK432> @mikepomeranz I don't disagree, and I'm sure he'll wish he did better, but this is real life. People screw up. That's all I'm saying.
696557264950448130 2016-02-07 04:52:48 UTC <BK432> I bet that Cam will wake up tomorrow and wish he'd handled press better. We've all had similar situations just not in national spotlight.
696556988445126657 2016-02-07 04:51:42 UTC <BK432> Yes, true - but also we should know he's human, he's young and can make mistakes. Empathy, y'allhttps://twitter.com/mikepomeranz/status/696556062409756672
696540145659543552 2016-02-07 03:44:46 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc Alex, what's it like to root for a Super Bowl champion? #GeniunelyCurious
696530399204392961 2016-02-07 03:06:02 UTC <BK432> Not so sure everyone would be pissed at Peyton for not trying to recover a fumble in that situation.
696518454787076096 2016-02-07 02:18:34 UTC <BK432> Heinz comes in and wins the damn thing late. Didn't see that coming.
696517212656562177 2016-02-07 02:13:38 UTC <BK432> Wow, what a throw and catch. Helluva play.
696510306944729088 2016-02-07 01:46:12 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc it's super easy for people to be cynical and crap, I mean Chris Martin isn't great but it was entertaining
696509647331663872 2016-02-07 01:43:35 UTC <BK432> Not exactly my thing but I think the Halftime Show producers should feel pretty good about that one. It was fun.
696496182617640961 2016-02-07 00:50:04 UTC <BK432> @mightympls I'll one up you - I have no interest in ever attending another NFL game again. TV = ok, but in person? No way.

696494295721889798 2016-02-07 00:42:34 UTC <BK432> I would literally die if I were Demaryius right there. Literally....die.
696493385713111040 2016-02-07 00:38:58 UTC <BK432> Well that TMNT commercial was the first thing that caught the 3 year old's attention lately

696489756427972608 2016-02-07 00:24:32 UTC <BK432> I really love @BMileskiKFAN's timeline tonight because it's basically everything @Lkummer says too
696488644333457409 2016-02-07 00:20:07 UTC <BK432> Big early-game play here....
696487292895150080 2016-02-07 00:14:45 UTC <BK432> You just...can't....take that penalty. I mean, emotional intelligence Mr. Talib. Develop it.
696486397977497600 2016-02-07 00:11:12 UTC <BK432> Biakabutuka for 15
696486197460406272 2016-02-07 00:10:24 UTC <BK432> My 3 year old has basically had a meal of hot cocoa, puppy chow and cheese over the last hour. Embracing the Super Bowl binge.
696485662359490566 2016-02-07 00:08:16 UTC <BK432> People underestimated this defense of the Broncos for two weeks. Cam and co. are feeling it for sure.

695060328007233537 2016-02-03 01:44:30 UTC <BK432> @KummerA @mattkummer did you go all shovel to get it cleaned up? Or did you borrow a snowblower?
695047249659822080 2016-02-03 00:52:32 UTC <BK432> I'm reading this nodding in agreement with Ted Cruz. I've NEVER done that before. Look what Trump has done to us!http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/03/donald-trump-says-ted-cruz-stole-victory-in-iowa-caucuses/
695030846500265985 2016-02-03 23:47:21 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer @KummerA it was more than was forecasted, but strangely, I'm not upset about it. Really glad I have bigger fish to fry in life.
695027970130452480 2016-02-03 23:35:55 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer we got 9-10 in west Plymouth....@KummerA may have been closer to 11
695027032284069888 2016-02-03 23:32:12 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer it's really weird, isn't it? How much ya get? I think we ended up with more than you guys, actually.

692564440173133826 2016-01-27 04:26:44 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man but fill it I will! Love the drama, starting with the conference tourneys.
692563405002149888 2016-01-27 04:22:37 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man can't dispute that. NBA not what it was. But at this point, with game on upswing and college game in disarray, NBA is better.
692561868641157120 2016-01-27 04:16:31 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man game enjoyability perhaps defined by 'pace factor'...possessions per 48 min...now at highest level since 92-93.
692561640638824448 2016-01-27 04:15:36 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man it was in decline. I agree 70s and 80s were glory days, but the game is on the upswing the last few years.
692559041323732993 2016-01-27 04:05:17 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man classic agree to disagree I guess. To me it's the best its been since early 90s.

692550120991297536 2016-01-27 03:29:50 UTC <BK432> I know there are those that disagree but the entertainment level of NBA basketball is so superior to that of the NCAA product.
692549511894425602 2016-01-27 03:27:25 UTC <BK432> Well, I thought the Wolves played pretty darn well there. Lavine had himself a game.

691373125099847681 2016-01-24 21:32:52 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood @grahamatc @gottlightmpls they trail by 5 after playing pretty poorly....don't count them out yet.
691372967796674560 2016-01-24 21:32:15 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc @gottlightmpls I love you guys....but I love seeing a villain win too. Makes the big games so fun.
691372524152553472 2016-01-24 21:30:29 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc @gottlightmpls I agree with your assessment, but disagree on respect. He's an all-timer. Always fun to watch.
691372069812981760 2016-01-24 21:28:41 UTC <BK432> @grahamatc no! Was just discussing this with @gottlightmpls....I don't hate Brady at all. Seriously.
691371533634174976 2016-01-24 21:26:33 UTC <BK432> My lord that was an awful throw and an even worse decision to throw it
691368797807063041 2016-01-24 21:15:41 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls don't hate any of those guys but probably like Jeter least....only because he was the most overrated of the 3. Still a HOFer
691367948116631552 2016-01-24 21:12:18 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls nah, I don't hate Brady. Dude's an all-timer, even if he's a bit arrogant and a whiner
691367248552787968 2016-01-24 21:09:31 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls you can rudely disagree too :)  I mean - it's fun to have a team that people love to hate. Yankees, Lakers, etc.
691366778631430144 2016-01-24 21:07:39 UTC <BK432> @gottlightmpls I'm not rooting for them (not for Broncos either) - they just make it more fun if they're in it.
691366368021643264 2016-01-24 21:06:01 UTC <BK432> Don't have a rooting interest in this game, but I love it when New England wins. Gotta love a good villain.
691365425796386816 2016-01-24 21:02:17 UTC <BK432> @mattychamp @mntrailrunner that sounds like the start to an epic day for sure
690993049183227904 2016-01-23 20:22:35 UTC <BK432> Glad I added @capitalweather to my must see list for the weekend. Incredibly great storm coverage for us simply eating popcorn in Minnesota.
690982445848489984 2016-01-23 19:40:27 UTC <BK432> Man, is this ever true.https://twitter.com/stevesilberman/status/690946037083611136
690981207723474944 2016-01-23 19:35:32 UTC <BK432> This is absolutely phenomenalhttps://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/690979525077962752

690747269126184961 2016-01-22 04:05:57 UTC <BK432> Crazy good get by Mets. Wouldn't be shocked at all to see the opt out exercised in November. Meet the freaking Mets.https://twitter.com/JonHeyman/status/690746819408760833
690743887699283970 2016-01-22 03:52:30 UTC <BK432> @RonSRosenbaum they gotta spell Dan's name right next week...pic.twitter.com/26BevOOC4m
690742249097949184 2016-01-22 03:46:00 UTC <BK432> C'mon @DanBarreiroKFAN they gotta spell your name right on your own show....pic.twitter.com/cJuPZIlrud
690660965780586496 2016-01-22 22:23:00 UTC <BK432> And in case you missed it, @radiohead will headline Lolla, Outside Lands and Osheaga per @coslive http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/radiohead-to-headline-lollapalooza-other-major-north-american-festivals/
690660560719912960 2016-01-22 22:21:24 UTC <BK432> Radiohead playing Polyethylene on their summer tour....yeah, I hope so too, but I try not to wish for the impossible http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/10-radiohead-songs-we-want-to-hear-on-their-2016-tour/
690659152150933504 2016-01-22 22:15:48 UTC <BK432> This has to be a joke, right?https://twitter.com/StuJackson32/status/690657374890233856
690629367387402240 2016-01-22 20:17:27 UTC <BK432> Looks like Mike Strong was already claimed by Miami this offseason from Milwaukee. Packs his bags again. Good K/9 so there's that.
690627256054452224 2016-01-22 20:09:03 UTC <BK432> Huh???? https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/690626890860748800
690394498799632384 2016-01-21 04:44:10 UTC <BK432> @KummerA what are you saying now, BUDDY BOY??
690386479034601478 2016-01-21 04:12:18 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer which leaves Hail To The Thief a deserving #8 but still a decent album.
690386319529345024 2016-01-21 04:11:39 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer 1. In Rainbows (criminally underrated) 2. OK Computer 3. Kid A 4. Amnesiac 5. The Bends 6. The King of Limbs 7. Pablo Honey
690385821296414720 2016-01-21 04:09:41 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer and All I Need is top 5 for me as well. So you can see where my loyalties lie.
690383829916356609 2016-01-21 04:01:46 UTC <BK432> And @mattkummer this is the 2nd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njCps4jGaks
690382060440195073 2016-01-21 03:54:44 UTC <BK432> @mattkummer their best ever song. Right here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZZnKmzkU04
690380217047736320 2016-01-21 03:47:25 UTC <BK432> I won't agree with @mattkummer that The Bends is the best album Radiohead did, but damn if it doesn't feel like it at times.
690371147205079042 2016-01-21 03:11:22 UTC <BK432> Doing some music-ing tonight. If you've never "gotten" Radiohead, give this a try. Absolutely as good as it gets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KglFXn0fg9M
690322069104365568 2016-01-21 23:56:21 UTC <BK432> This is so good. https://twitter.com/Brandon_Warne/status/690318817172434944
690307958538829824 2016-01-21 23:00:17 UTC <BK432> It just occurred to me, #MNTwins need to tank the '16 seasonhttps://twitter.com/brianmctaggart/status/690307592401190912
690307207359926272 2016-01-21 22:57:18 UTC <BK432> @RonSRosenbaum PTSD and lack of support for veterans are valid problems. But blaming prez for these leading to abuse is ridiculous and wrong
690306799346417665 2016-01-21 22:55:40 UTC <BK432> Possible trade coming in the HBL roto league. Feeling good, hopefully we can come to terms. More details later #NobodyCares
690301207575801856 2016-01-21 22:33:27 UTC <BK432> Set to record on the DVR - I would recommend you do the same.https://twitter.com/enoughsaidfox9/status/690227784120074240
690299937838366720 2016-01-21 22:28:24 UTC <BK432> This is so good out on @twinsdaily by @SethTweets. On prospect pitcher Stephen Gonsalves. Check it out. http://twinsdaily.com/topic/21206-article-catching-up-with-lhp-stephen-gonsalves/
690297059648274433 2016-01-21 22:16:58 UTC <BK432> Sanders seems to have legit chance to win both Iowa and New Hampshire #FeelTheBernhttps://twitter.com/Seth_Kaplan/status/690295894822944770
690262503058608128 2016-01-21 19:59:39 UTC <BK432> Well then CLEARLY he's an MVP candidate for 2016https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/690244084687114240
690257112337780736 2016-01-21 19:38:14 UTC <BK432> This storm is going to be insane. Wow.https://twitter.com/pdouglasweather/status/690246418393632768
690221322861842432 2016-01-21 17:16:01 UTC <BK432> This is the correct answerhttps://twitter.com/tom_bigwood/status/690220750540681216
690217157519486976 2016-01-21 16:59:28 UTC <BK432> What a complete moron http://deadspin.com/radio-dummy-on-female-nfl-coach-theres-no-place-for-a-1754257086
690213051883085824 2016-01-21 16:43:09 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man I actually would advocate for both of them in the pen if the Twins are determined to keep May there regardless
690212882701639682 2016-01-21 16:42:29 UTC <BK432> @fran_the_man ha! Yes, I personally swap the two. I know that won't be popular with some (such as Mr Fran the Man himself) :)
690211783248732160 2016-01-21 16:38:07 UTC <BK432> Not sure I buy it, but I hope it's at least close to true.
690211648578068480 2016-01-21 16:37:35 UTC <BK432> Working from home with an illness, have @MLBNetwork Hot Stove on, Molitor interviewed and said May "could go back to rotation". Hmm...
690202437890666496 2016-01-21 16:00:59 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt I think one of the two will make the team, and hopefully they can perform to what I believe the team expects.
690201493283057667 2016-01-21 15:57:13 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt true - could have been worth the shot. Relief pitchers - who knows, right?
690195927047376896 2016-01-21 15:35:06 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt got it. I'm not sure Bastardo would have been worth it. I'm fine seeing if Rogers or Darnell can help too.
690194353814286339 2016-01-21 15:28:51 UTC <BK432> @glp_vt did I miss something? What makes you say that?
690184406414196736 2016-01-21 14:49:20 UTC <BK432> @Lkummer good for you, my bride
690160690225635328 2016-01-21 13:15:05 UTC <BK432> Now that's a festival right therehttps://twitter.com/Primavera_Sound/status/690097875196497920
689821119784812544 2016-01-20 14:45:45 UTC <BK432> Mediocre starter goes to 'pen? We've seen it work many times. Love Blanton to the Dodgers' bullpen for $4M. Great deal.
689789979359186944 2016-01-20 12:42:01 UTC <BK432> @tom_bigwood was this in PHX? Where were you staying - that looks like a resort I was at in July down there...
