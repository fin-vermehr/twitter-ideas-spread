964008100184371201 2018-02-14 05:26:56 UTC <taraclocastro> I know about guns. "Assault" rifles are rifles modified to add extra ammunition clips (magazines) and a rapid fire (fully automatic) trigger mechanism. THEY STILL DON'T NEED TO BE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE MILITARY. Period.
964005012862062592 2018-02-14 05:14:40 UTC <taraclocastro> I REFUSE to engage any idiots in a discussion about assault rifles. THEY. SHOULD. BE. BANNED.  NO CIVILIAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ANY WEAPON THAT IS CAPABLE OF FIRING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS A MINUTE: NO ONE.

963998847923052544 2018-02-14 04:50:10 UTC <taraclocastro> @Justalakegirl An assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge & a detachable magazine. A knife can't kill dozens of people in a matter of minutes: You can't drive a car into a school. This happened in my back yard & it's the 30th mass shooting THIS YEAR. Fuck off

963264441918816256 2018-02-12 04:11:54 UTC <taraclocastro> @randyprine Sex abuse related, that is.

As expected, you've received nothing but deflection, ignorance, name calling and blame shifting. They do get an "A" in those departments!

Cultists usually live in a concentrated cluster near their leader. This societal cancer has spread everywhere, and like cult members, it's impossible to see and understand
963072605333938176 2018-02-12 15:29:36 UTC <taraclocastro> Nothing could be further from the truth; however, members of the cult who worship at "The Church of the Poisioned Mind" are in self-denial, hiding behind the cloak of Patriotism ready to ensure these existential threats don't rob them of the rights they believe to be exclusively
963072603727581184 2018-02-12 15:29:36 UTC <taraclocastro> his supporters are most afraid of; they believe that anyone who looks different, worships differently, loves someone other than who they think a partnership should be, speaks a different language cannot be "American" or possibly uphold the tenets this country was founded upon.

963072599977791489 2018-02-12 15:29:35 UTC <taraclocastro> the answer to your original question, may not be easily defined: Instead, it may be more of a "mob mentality" in order to feebly attempt to prevent the "Browning" of America (which by the way, cannot be stopped) and the preservation of what the ill-informed perceive the
963072597981310977 2018-02-12 15:29:35 UTC <taraclocastro> feeble, but never ending quest by Drumpf et al to delegitimize Obama with the birther conspiracy, attacking him whenever he played golf (from the "king" of golfing vacations), the conspiracy theories surrounding HRC (Pizzagate, the Uranium "deal", the e-mails, Bengazi etc). So
963072596374941704 2018-02-12 15:29:34 UTC <taraclocastro> the slogan "Take America Back", the meaning resonated with me that our country is in danger of being toppled by minorities, Muslims, etc. The "white race" is in danger of extinction and our government is controlled by "terrorists" akin to those responsible for 9/11. Hence the
963072590830022661 2018-02-12 15:29:33 UTC <taraclocastro> I think I may have a "qualifier" for your question: I believe, Drumpf has awakened the deep seeded primal hatred simmering just below the surface in so many supporters who still are in shock & disbelief that the U.S. elected a black man as President. When I heard @johncusack

He's an unscrupulous, lying, cheat & fraud. Everything he touched turned to . He stiffs people who work for him (contractors etc.) &  he won't release his tax returns because he owes Russians billions.

I have no quality of life w/out them. Until you're in a position 2 pass judgement, U should refrain from doing so. Tobacco & alcohol kill far more people a year than opioids.
962754273300840449 2018-02-11 18:24:40 UTC <taraclocastro> @BigStrongFast @larryf_ISO News Flash: "Opioids" are much more than "pain pills". The opioid crisis includes Heroin which is included in this category.

Yes, age is definitely a factor. His VP pick should be a young, emerging face for the Democrats if Biden's a contender. We need a seasoned, political veteran to at least start cleaning up this train wreck. (Just my opinion.)

I know all about Drumpf (I worked 4 1 of his Accountants in Palm Beach yrs ago) & he's a heretic. He doesn't believe in God, & admitted he's "Never asked 4 forgiveness". He believes in 2 things: Himself & the almighty $. Period.

According to them, Drumpf's "born again" so he's got a golden ticket to heaven. That has to be one of the funniest things I've ever heard. The sign of the beast that has been manifesting itself is purely coincidental in their eyes

Calling people names who don't agree w/ you & see right through the lame "superman" faade u try & push off on ur ignorant, moronic "followers" is getting old.

The point I was trying to really make was that the "protest vote" (or non-vote) sealed the fate of the race. Whoever the nominee is, we should rally behind that person. Biden had a front row seat to greatness.
960405633181810688 2018-02-04 06:52:01 UTC <taraclocastro> @realDonaldTrump @ForeverLogical @divine_mzm I've spent time actually working with Drumpf. I can speak from experience, no-one can be a bigger idiot than he is. Trudeau might be an insensitive jerk; but believe you me, Drumpf wins out in that category too.

However, if  2016 taught us (the Dems) anything, we mustn't allow the fracturing of our party 2 become a downfall. Even though Bernie wasn't the nominee, those who decided to sit out (or voted Stein) because he wasn't, handed victory to Drumpf.

957797202407100416 2018-01-28 02:07:02 UTC <taraclocastro> Hermann Goering stated in 1934: "We love Adolf Hitler because we believe firmly and profoundly that he was sent to us by God to save Germany.". We all know how that ended up. Now, Drumpfsters exalt that he was "selected by God" to be Pres.. Disgusting & inexcusable. #NeverAgain

957781760070373376 2018-01-28 01:05:40 UTC <taraclocastro> @Alyssa_Milano Drumpf supporters claim "God" put him in the WH. Here's a little snippet from pre-WWII Germany: Hermann Goering, 1934: "We love Adolf Hitler because we believe firmly and profoundly that he was sent to us by God to save Germany.". #NeverAgain

That neglect occurred even though I went as often as I could. I would change the sheets, sponge bathe & hand feed him. Those places are horrible. The VA hospitals aren't much better.

I found him lying in his own feces, on urine soaked sheets, food tray from breakfast & lunch on the bedside table UNTOUCHED. He developed a horrible bedsore. I went twice a day until he passed. I raised 1/2

944289589375750145 2017-12-22 19:32:36 UTC <taraclocastro> @funder Nearly the amount Obama spent in EIGHT years as President, but his supporters can't/won't acknowledge this. What an outrage! Can't fix stupid.

I'm merely pointing out Drumpf is an opportunist who is fleecing America & lining his pocket w/taxpayer . He berated President Obama whenever he took time off, but he's been at one of his properties for almost 40% of his "Presidency". A tad hypocritical 2 most.

He bought Mar-A-Lago as an "investment" because he wanted to tear it down & build several homes on the property. The Town of Palm Beach Historic Preservation Committee nixed that idea because the estate is a historic landmark. He turned it 1/2

Holidays, okay, but what about the other 100+ days he's spent golfing & bullshitting? We the taxpayers pay for those "jaunts". He benefits financially from visiting his properties by having them in an LLC (corporation)

The middle class died in the 80s and your "brilliant" tax plan further insures the middle class STAYS EXTINCT. People with a memory & a modicum of intelligence can see your sham.

The fiscal year started October 1st & you still haven't passed a budget; but I wouldn't expect you 2 know this since you stopped paying attention in school in 3rd grade. Where r transcripts & tax returns?
941326664738529282 2017-12-14 15:19:00 UTC <taraclocastro> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, to millionaires. Have someone explain "Reaganomics" to you. (In the most simple terms, of course). Your "tax cuts" are nothing but "Voo Doo" economics. Don't worry, it has nothing to do with actual Voo Doo, but that's not a bad idea. Well, gotta go; I have a doll to make.

940811842666074113 2017-12-12 05:13:17 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 A fetus cannot survive outside the womb before 22 weeks. (Science thought 27 weeks before further research). Late term abortions should be illegal and are in the majority of states.
940811239378292736 2017-12-12 05:10:53 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 LOL! How are you going to prosecute a dead person? People take their lives every day. I was raised to believe that only God can take a life. I'm not "for" suicide either, but if someone makes that painful choice, then it's theirs 2 make. I don't have to stand & be judged 4 them.
940810395383664640 2017-12-12 05:07:32 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 I don't have to. I would NEVER terminate a pregnancy. The women who decide to have to live with their choice. If a woman wants an abortion, she will find a way. I don't judge them since I'm not in a position to.

940808749027090432 2017-12-12 05:00:59 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 Oh, I "get it"; you believe you should control other people and what they do. We live in a free country, not under a dictatorship.
940808349746126850 2017-12-12 04:59:24 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 It is inside her body and until the baby is born, it is her decision whether or not to bring a child into the world. She'll have to answer to her higher power (whatever she believes) if it's wrong. Neither you nor I have any right dictating what someone else does.
940807696260976640 2017-12-12 04:56:48 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 That doesn't always work, and you know that. Repubs want to eliminate birth control coverage under employers insurance plans, defund Planned Parenthood (which does give out birth control) and end sex education in schools. What's the answer then?
940806679301689344 2017-12-12 04:52:46 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 I'm am NOT pro-abortion. I'm pro-choice. If a woman wants to terminate her pregancy, it's her choice. I'm personally against abortion, and I would never have one; conversely, I shouldn't impose my beliefs on anyone else: Just my opinion.
940805770626596864 2017-12-12 04:49:09 UTC <taraclocastro> @JacobAWohl @treadway_pd_67 A woman has the right to handle her body the way she decides to. The decision is between her, her partner (if so involved) and her higher power. Not ANYONE else. Period.
