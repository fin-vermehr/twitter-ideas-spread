Selling your name to market condos for money laundering is not a Billion dollar enterprise. Sorry LW.  Luckily you get to keep your red cap.

Airline, Football League, Casino, Water, and Mortgage businesses all failed. (90s-2008) 3. Trump U failed and fined $25 million in 2017.  Its Did he sell a Billion Red hats? Its borders on the absurd. 
966328437093949440 2018-02-21 15:07:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TeaPainUSA Also can evidence tainted by a woman be used against me?   Thats actually his message to his base.

Trump has some how hidden $3-10 Billion in assets and no one can say how he accumulated his wealth. Its just absurd.

966160278747525120 2018-02-20 03:58:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepMaxineWaters @JOEROWE409 So $100 million per deal on average? Nice work if you can get it.

966109444064071680 2018-02-20 00:36:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepMaxineWaters @Earn_my_respect @meRobertHerrera A Trust fund is a thing not and an insult. Setting up multiple LLCs is a common money laundering technique. Trump has never run a Billion dollar business.  Its not my fault you find these facts offensive.

966099869302755328 2018-02-20 23:58:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepMaxineWaters @meRobertHerrera @Earn_my_respect Not really. The real estate failure was the most spectacular. Its how he first came to my attention. The first Billion dollar deadbeat. That was a headline in a business publication.
966099149887344645 2018-02-20 23:56:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepMaxineWaters @meRobertHerrera The real estate was his first spectacular failure. He owed the NY banks so much ($900.000,000)they ended up restructuring bankruptcy laws.  He hasnt had a successful business besides naming rights and the Apprentice. Hes wealthy. Doesnt add up to a Billion. No way.
966098085704290304 2018-02-20 23:51:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepMaxineWaters @meRobertHerrera You do realize youre describing money laundering, right?

965670392386990086 2018-02-19 19:32:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> The thing is conservatives are primarily disingenuous. Hardly any of their rhetoric is sincere. They just have talking point the mire in real debate in partisan rancor.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/965645211283189760
965669667019853824 2018-02-19 19:29:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid @spamaps @raballentine1 @MikeDMarler The willingness in the media to go along with their ridiculous rhetoric is a major part of the problem.  The 2nd amendment arguments is completely empty. Conservatives treat the constitution like a conservative Bible. Its only useful to support some perverse view. Otherwise nada

965661914465435648 2018-02-19 18:58:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> Rush Limbaugh on radio now:   1. Im the most honest news source in media.  2.

965650110146232321 2018-02-19 18:11:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @vorrell Theyre desperate. The media is downplaying the heart of the indictment. Calling the whole affair a conspiracy make Don Jr and Jared guilty by public admission.

The media hasnt really played up the real gem in the indictment.  Mueller deems the whole sorted affair a criminal conspiracy against the US and the election in particular. That make ANY collusion criminally culpable.
965642408141709312 2018-02-19 17:41:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> Seriously?   This guy has got to be nervous about Muellers probe. The unwitting claim is not valid after Fridays announcement. https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/965592246165889025

965375846432296960 2018-02-18 00:01:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HoarseWisperer I suspect Mueller may be after a bigger fish. He could indict an American Oligarch.

965267753761460224 2018-02-18 16:52:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @realDonaldTrump @FredFleitz Anyone still openly Gaslighting after the indictment is complicit.  This guy is an ex CIA analyst, we have to assume he can read. Theres no more room for unwitting participants.

965256847639891969 2018-02-18 16:09:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> In very plain terms re indictment:  1. Mueller exposed a very serious conspiracy to defraud the US and to interfere in the 2016 election.  2. By saying that the whole sorted affair is a conspiracy, hence a crime, anyone involved is criminally liable.  3. Don Jr and Jared  1

965244757441171456 2018-02-18 15:20:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @boyndog They rotten by design. You cant be a national GOP politician without Koch Brothers network funding. The Koch sponsored conservatives movement is hostile to our democracy.
965243838544695296 2018-02-18 15:17:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TuckerCarlson @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews @boyndog Understand the subtext of the indictment.  Muellers practically shutting down the collusion is not a crime nonsense of cable news. By calling the whole affair a conspiracy, hence a crime, anyone that colluded is in deep trouble.

965238848807677952 2018-02-18 14:57:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepAdamSchiff @grammyisabel Its ridiculous to think the MSM would have supported Obamas claims. It would have created chaos and Congress would have opened an investigation of Obama.
965236961299652609 2018-02-18 14:49:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HoarseWisperer @blankslate2017 Exactly. Anyone with a good lawyer hasnt slept well since the indictment was released.

960254837442203648 2018-02-04 20:52:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> Donald Trump Jr. said the GOP memo his dad declassified is a "little bit of sweet revenge." https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-the-memo_us_5a772b3be4b06ee97af3bc07?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 via @HuffPostPol

955419924180144129 2018-01-22 12:40:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> The GOP clearly operates in bad faith on all major issues for 7+ years.  Shutdown debate:  Dem- want to protect DACA and CHIP.  GOP- Dreamers and their liberal supporters are complicit in murder.   Cable news: we cant tell which side is causing a rift.

950444443223633921 2018-01-08 19:09:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The Dems are pretty much a center left party. The GOP/Conservative movement has decided fascism is better than democracy. Especially if it produces elected officials of color.

950433981538951171 2018-01-08 18:28:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Cool. What about the conservatives movement.
950433055180840961 2018-01-08 18:24:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Ok. Theres no conservatives party. No conservatives party has existed in the last 40 years. However, your sure that same party has great policy ideas. 
950432530737614848 2018-01-08 18:22:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Magical is a strawman. See how that works.
950432123319738369 2018-01-08 18:20:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Ok. So where is this Conservative party? When did it exist? What did it do?
950431610691817472 2018-01-08 18:18:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Come man. Use the context clues. You defined free riders. Are you really confused that confused by the term. Wow
950430014096453633 2018-01-08 18:12:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast A really smart policy wonk like you should be able to sum up the conservative policie implemented in the last 30 years. Right?
950429436310163456 2018-01-08 18:10:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast I accept that. The problem then becomes why would the party plagued with free rider policies ignore the largest free riders?  It sorta undermines the basis of your argument.
950428778769080321 2018-01-08 18:07:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Your examples, right? You said free riders are entitlement cheats and oil companies.
950428267655417862 2018-01-08 18:05:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Theres the problem. In the dictionary word meaning are fixed depending on usage. You however feel free to refine terms to fit you narrative no matter how ridiculous.
950427630108594177 2018-01-08 18:02:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Saying its a scam= perfect policy idea? Oh boy. 
950427266651246595 2018-01-08 18:01:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Free riders as defined as oil companies and entitlement cheats. However, the oil companies dont really pertain to this argument because,  strawman. Right?
950426090463465472 2018-01-08 17:56:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Perfect policy idea? Thats a strawman.  When you project an argument on to someone else.
950425563843514369 2018-01-08 17:54:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Is this a joke?  You redefined conservatives. You redefined free riders. You introduced examples not germane to your argument and then excuse me of creating a strawman. JFC
950424687137513472 2018-01-08 17:51:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast You said they are plagued by free riders. Then you said oil co are free riders. However, in spite of being the largest free riders you didnt actually include them.  What exactly is the plague you speak of?   And please include only relevant examples.
950423614842703873 2018-01-08 17:47:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Seriously, do you understand the strawman concept?  Its not a strawman to disagree with your fact pattern.
950422755438157825 2018-01-08 17:43:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Lol. So... now they are plagued by policies that they dont advocate.  Your genius is unchallenged. 
950422300075216897 2018-01-08 17:41:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Separate plague then. 
950421843688779776 2018-01-08 17:40:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Must be my education level. My bad.
950421553698820102 2018-01-08 17:38:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast You said plagued. Thats a pretty aggressive term to now try to walk back.
950421357208186880 2018-01-08 17:38:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Lol. You are literally comparing conservatives and liberals.

950419162899386368 2018-01-08 17:29:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Ok. So you identify the problem with liberal as advocating for free riders and in the same argument exclude the largest free riders from consideration.  I clearly need you help understanding policy.
950418228244877312 2018-01-08 17:25:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The people involved with the GOP who call themselves conservatives are really conservatives. Better?
950417720260071424 2018-01-08 17:23:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The current GOP is not really Conservative.  Right?
950417588458344448 2018-01-08 17:23:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The Dems are plagued by free riders. However, the largest free rider in the US economy is excluded.  Correct?
950417233846718469 2018-01-08 17:21:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The conservative movement is not conservative. Is that your position or not?
950417035279982595 2018-01-08 17:20:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast My education level is adequate. Im sure Im not as smart as you , but your argument lacks any basis.
950416278971396096 2018-01-08 17:17:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast I apologize. Where am I going wrong with the summation?
950415548269187072 2018-01-08 17:14:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Which part of the summation do you take issue with?
950415358653018113 2018-01-08 17:14:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast You defined the terms. You set the examples. Where is the strawman?
950415025679884288 2018-01-08 17:12:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Actually, that exactly what you did. You defined the terms and gave examples. If that example doesnt follow you would have to specifically exclude it. 
950414207064961024 2018-01-08 17:09:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Isnt that how I summed up your argument?
950413639919570944 2018-01-08 17:07:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Did I miss anything? I differ to your policy expertise.
950413414060392456 2018-01-08 17:06:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast I understand.  I cant call the Conservatives movement conservatives because there not you know, conservative.  Dems advocate for free riders , except the largest free riders (oil).  The real conservatives movement has nothing to do with the current GOP.
950412231354789889 2018-01-08 17:01:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The liberal movement plagued by free riders. Example of free rider: oil companies.

950411235757117440 2018-01-08 16:57:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The Conservative movement as currently defined by our political system is a scam. Wishful thinking about a Conservative party that never existed is ridiculous.
950410678682247168 2018-01-08 16:55:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The Dems are advocating for oil interest? This is just getting ridiculous. 
950409128387760128 2018-01-08 16:49:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The free riders?
950407944125939713 2018-01-08 16:44:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The idea that a $20 Trillion stable economy has to neglect is poor for financial reasons is simply a moral crisis of character.
950407425387126786 2018-01-08 16:42:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast All of that is rhetoric never backed by any policy. Also,  I dont see how youre toned down maker versus takers rhetoric is any better. 
950403483823476736 2018-01-08 16:27:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Not conservative small C. Ok.  The group the falsely identifies as Conservatives and aligns itself with the GOP is fraudulent.  The Conservative party that you seem to enjoy has never actually existed in US politics.
950397571553546240 2018-01-08 16:03:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @drvox @NickJanusch The US is a stable $20 Trillion economy. The notion that we cant afford anything is a ridiculous conservative movement propaganda feat.
950395279693500416 2018-01-08 15:54:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast The parties have policy positions. They constantly market their policy positions. How is that conflation?   Again, please explain conservatism. Im confused.
950392573847318528 2018-01-08 15:43:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast Lol. If you change the identification the problem remains the same. The conservative movement is a scam. The GOP rhetoric is based on that scam.  What are you defending?
950390257194848257 2018-01-08 15:34:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Clumsy_Beast I agree it was Randian foolishness. I dont understand how you are separating the GOP, which self identified as the conservative movement, from the policies.

943228806818656257 2017-12-19 21:17:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AJentleson The country was still recovering from a economic downturn. That wont work again until the economy crashes. The rascist clarion call will prevail outside of actual trauma.

943210864840265728 2017-12-19 20:06:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @johnastoehr The GOP has acted in bad faith for decades. This is a failure of democracy on several levels. Sad
943209576807174144 2017-12-19 20:01:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Green_Footballs Exactly. And we are way past phone call and tweets.  We need disruption in the system to reclaim a voice in the US.

943208678555078656 2017-12-19 19:57:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> Unless we demand more from our media, this wont be the godsend were expecting. The media is interested in rating and profit.

941684149081071617 2017-12-15 14:59:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @limitlesskait @SusanDanzig219 Its a disgusting lie. The ACA actually helped the turnover in the small group markets. There was no individual market to disrupt. Its all GOP proganda.

941679991921823745 2017-12-15 14:43:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AKRNHSNC Thats all true and because there  wasnt a vibrant individual market before ACA few people in the exchanges would have experienced a doctor change.  The employer markets doctors turn over was slowed by the ACA due to stabilizing small group markets.

941667752976281600 2017-12-15 13:54:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Rickwritesnow And its still the same GOP lies for 8 yrs.  where did the doctors go?  Who lost their plans?  Its completely bs.

941666318197149696 2017-12-15 13:48:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @amcphaull I still think the Dems dont market the true value of ACA well enough.
941666012491108353 2017-12-15 13:47:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @amcphaull This is the most infuriating part of the GOP proganda. No one lost a doctor because of the ACA. The ACA doesnt manage doctor networks.  There wasnt any individual market to speak of , so no one lost than plans either.
941664165416067074 2017-12-15 13:40:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> Where did the doctors go? How does the GOP keep getting away with saying that?  #MorningJoe

938868448091885569 2017-12-07 20:30:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @thismamatweets @RobinBrenizer Its seems inevitable that it will come to that. 
938868045421907968 2017-12-07 20:29:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JackHokie Lol. Is that really what tipped you off Jack? 
938865812290592768 2017-12-07 20:20:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @DavidEBurke Lol. Love the bright outlook. It will be crushed in short order.  Fascist are not nice reasonable people. Dont listen to Chuck Todd. 
938864625050882050 2017-12-07 20:15:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AdamEichen Is water wet?
938864329289584641 2017-12-07 20:14:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EdanClay Mueller needs to step it up. We need to know if any elected Democratic are compromised.

938861136929312768 2017-12-07 20:01:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EdanClay Really. This ticked me off more than that stupid healthcare bill. 
938859578372050945 2017-12-07 19:55:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog I never questioned that our goals align. Im just not as optimistic about the depth of this abyss.
938858975868710912 2017-12-07 19:53:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @DavidEBurke The political calculus here is super flawed. Its borders on malfeasance.  Its a mistake for Dems and #metoo.
938856997096755201 2017-12-07 19:45:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mybellmichell @JohnJHarwood The one good thing they say about Putin is hes a strong leader. Make a decision already.

938853014852521984 2017-12-07 19:29:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> No problem believing a foreign power can install a POTUS.   Unbelievable that same political operatives would set up a Senator fighting that foreign power.   #metoo
938851960492646401 2017-12-07 19:25:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> The fascist around the world chuckle.  You American are so cute with your moral high ground. https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/938819077941944322
938851106779795457 2017-12-07 19:22:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @_celia_marie_ Its not going to stop unless we stop it. Welcome to unfettered capitalism.  Or as the GOP says Freedom.
938850286063546368 2017-12-07 19:18:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Well on Twitter we can raise awareness. Stop ignoring the problem.  We can protest, we can boycott, we can create a general work stoppage.  We can demand better from our media.
938848426359435269 2017-12-07 19:11:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> Its really not like Putin to be wishy washy. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/938847369969524736
938848128240902144 2017-12-07 19:10:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> The last time a fascist controlled a major Western democracy we had a world war and historic human tragedy.  Im almost certain American fascist will respect the high ground the Dems gained.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/938826200230825989
938845482163605504 2017-12-07 18:59:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Im honestly dont think we are accessing the threat in the same way.  The GOP is not interested in Rep Democracy. Theres no plan to let a stupid vote count stop them.
938842892772216833 2017-12-07 18:49:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MattMurph24 @JKH2 Thats morally correct. I hope the fascist currently usurping our government abide by those standards.
938842231359901696 2017-12-07 18:46:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> This is no better than the GOP playing politics with our lives.  We need a peoples party.  These guy are going to fall to fascism.https://twitter.com/TomPerez/status/938456573046874113

The one that showed remorse?  The DNC goes after the handsy comedian?  Not the multi child molesters. Not the monsters creating a hostile work environment. 
938838317260558336 2017-12-07 18:31:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> When the emotions calm and the lust for mob justice subsidies the Dems and the #metoo movement will rue this day.  There will be no moral high ground. We simply loss. https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/938828517076332546
938837017357582337 2017-12-07 18:26:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> The DNC is a motherfucker.  -someone a the back of the congregation.
938836297250197505 2017-12-07 18:23:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> Attacking Sen Franken was a craven political move. I would never consider voting for you.   @SenGillibrand
938835818176827392 2017-12-07 18:21:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> Take a bow DNC. You ceased the high ground. https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/938815409737928704
938833463519731712 2017-12-07 18:11:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> Al Franken showed no remorse - Hugh Hewitt  Hows that high ground going DNC?  #suckers
938829566046597120 2017-12-07 17:56:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> After the Dems remove Franken:  1. Leeann can do her next Fox News segment or her next soft core porn shoot and feel safer.  2. Fascism get another firmer grip on our body politic. 
938821311966695424 2017-12-07 17:23:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> The Democratic Party bowed to the GOP and cable news in allowing sexual assault to become a partisan issue. Fine.  The Dems then decide to stake out an untenable moral position on this same political issue?   I need a new party with better strategists.
938818297365229569 2017-12-07 17:11:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> In the midst of a movement to flush out sexual assault the Democratic Party claimed the scalp of a handsy comedian.  Nice job everyone.  #metoo
938817439374217217 2017-12-07 17:08:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> The Dems participated in a right wing hit job on a honorable public servant.  This is in sane. Bigly bad move.https://twitter.com/Mikel_Jollett/status/938816299357974528
938816560923316224 2017-12-07 17:04:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> The Democratic Party will not protect us from Fascism.   Democrats, Republicans and Independents need a coalition of the decent to fight for a democracy.  Were getting creamed. 
938815362535186432 2017-12-07 16:59:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AriBerman @scrutatrix 
938814617165488129 2017-12-07 16:57:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AriBerman Anyone who cares about #metoo should recognize the terrible tactical error this represents. Bigly mistake. 
938813919761764357 2017-12-07 16:54:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AriBerman Al Franken has a very credible reason to question the motives behind his allegations. Hes deserves a fair hearing.  Rolling over to the fascist just means we dont appreciate the threat they pose.
938811818675404800 2017-12-07 16:45:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> Lol. The moral high ground.  Were complete idiots.  Democracy will rue this move. History will not be kind.https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/938810208457056256

938809115937329152 2017-12-07 16:35:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @goldietaylor Baby steps. Ill take it. 
938806622884978688 2017-12-07 16:25:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> Can someone correct the quote please.  Come on WH. This is embarrassing. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/938786402992578560
938803227826556930 2017-12-07 16:11:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> Guys. Wake up. A tax bill like this couldnt survive in a functioning democracy.  We are officially a theocracy. The Koch Brothers are fascist.https://twitter.com/OrangeResistanc/status/938801463639228416
938802725252366336 2017-12-07 16:09:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HallieJackson @jljacobson Cable news is a fail.  Trading Al Franken for a few news cycles with the high ground is political malpractice. The Dems are screwing themselves and the #metoo movement.
938799493025357824 2017-12-07 15:56:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> We have two child molesters and several predator creating hostile work environments.  The Dems formed a coalition to take down a comedian acting like a boorish clown.  Please explain the upside morally or politically of this strategy. 
938798108695199744 2017-12-07 15:51:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> Putin will not allow his main country to be shut out while his subsidiaries perform unfettered. https://twitter.com/marthamaccallum/status/938562978747748352
938795726322257920 2017-12-07 15:41:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PolitikMasFina I agree. The argument should be is bowing to fascist in the best interest of the #metoo movement.
938795288877305856 2017-12-07 15:40:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> Doing the right thing is not letting Bannon and Stone control the narrative on sexual assault. The Dems are making a huge mistake on Franken. #metoo will lose.
938794617776017409 2017-12-07 15:37:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PolitikMasFina Trump is unhinged and has nuclear weapons.  All Franken faked a grope of a women in a flak jacket.

938791000750874624 2017-12-07 15:23:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SenFranken Hillary took way more barbs than this Senator.  Buck up. We need you to reclaim democracy from these fascist.   DIO NOT ABANDON YOUR COUNTRY WHEN WE NEED YOU MOST. 
938787584347705344 2017-12-07 15:09:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EricBoehlert  Just explain how we can ease the economic anxiety. Easy peasy.pic.twitter.com/oWQfziLGCl

938780074245087232 2017-12-07 14:39:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog We are fighting fascist. The ripped of the middle class. Theyre coming after SS. Excellent messaging points.  We dont need moral high ground in a fight where it doesnt matter.
938779473004068864 2017-12-07 14:37:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Senator Frankens job Is in question because of the moment. Any other time he would get due process.
938779064055328768 2017-12-07 14:35:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Fight back. Stop with the insanely stupid idea of politics by cable news.  We dont have to accept right wing or cable newscast framing.  Reality is on our side.
938778057674018817 2017-12-07 14:31:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Good luck with that. 
938777679528169473 2017-12-07 14:30:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog A tax bill where millions lose healthcare coverage? A healthcare bill where $1 Trillion dollars gets transfered out of the system?  Fascist are monsters. Were still sleeping soundly.
938777045982728192 2017-12-07 14:27:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Lol. They just mugged the middle class. The stole a SCOTUS seat. They aligned with a foreign adversary.  When will be enough to convince us the threat to democracy is real. 
938776171084419073 2017-12-07 14:24:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog The Koch Brothers are fascist. We are not responding correctly to that threat to democracy. Fascist dont respect weakness. It will only embolden them. They will message around the Dems morality and laugh at us.
938774724796211200 2017-12-07 14:18:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog I would love that. We dont have to give up Franken for that to happen.  As a matter of fact this works against that goal.
938774231504039937 2017-12-07 14:16:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog We are gift wrapping a method to discredit Dems and slow #metoo.
938773970459025410 2017-12-07 14:15:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Thats correct.  Roger Stone and Bannon will create a Dem child molester if Roy Moore win.  Youre underestimating the threat.
938773233347706880 2017-12-07 14:12:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Of course theyre going to allow free and fair elections. No worries.
938772825694965760 2017-12-07 14:10:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Of course. Everything is fine.  $1.5 Trillion dollar theft from middle class. No big. The fascist will stop there.
938771587834228736 2017-12-07 14:06:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SamSeder @chrislhayes The Dems need to show a little backbone and plush back against the right wing on Franken.
938770641284685829 2017-12-07 14:02:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog I understand that. If it political then let be political. Its a losing strategy all around to take a moral position on a political issue.  The GOP wont stop picking off Dems with simple allegations. Dumb.
938769724900593665 2017-12-07 13:58:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog We dont have rational somber management in DC. Losing a talented policy wonk and a democracy fighter is worse thing Dems can do to the country.
938769269214580736 2017-12-07 13:56:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog You need to think bigger. These fascist arent concerned about morals.  The GOP will use Franken as a weapon against Dems and #metoo.
938767606164713472 2017-12-07 13:50:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Losing Al Franken to a right wing hit job just win a few news cycles is dumb.
938767235065270272 2017-12-07 13:48:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @boyndog Sexual assault shouldnt be political.   The Dems accepted the political framing and then take an untenable moral position.   Thats just stupid.

938480645222912001 2017-12-06 18:49:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> Tom Perez should step down.  This cannot be the focus of the DNC.   Can we get advocate that wont roll over the stupid right wing hit jobs. https://twitter.com/TomPerez/status/938456573046874113

938478275009146880 2017-12-06 18:40:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> The media nor the democrats are going to save democracy.

938467738418368512 2017-12-06 17:58:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> I fully support the #metoo movement.   But if we are dumping Senator Al Franken because of Roger Stone and because we have to believe the women, I have a question.  Do you believe Sarah Huckabee Sanders or KellyAnn Conway?

938463858997506048 2017-12-06 17:43:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Amy_Siskind Fascist are in a full scale assault on our democracy and we have a group of Dems lobbying Al Franken to resign. SMDH  Im sure the fascist will be better for the #metoo movement. 
938462725558165504 2017-12-06 17:38:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MarkHarrisNYC 1. Sexual assault is not partisan.  2. Roger Stone orchestrated the hit job on Senator Franken.   3. The fascist attacking our democracy are laughing at our misguided morality.
938459865844011009 2017-12-06 17:27:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> Maybe marginalized communities understand better what fascism will bring.

938458057817903109 2017-12-06 17:20:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @fawfulfan If we let Roger Stone take down Al Franken in the middle of a fight for democracy then we deserve what follows.

938456142694535168 2017-12-06 17:12:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @RussellBrasel @TheRickyDavila Another example of Dems being suckers. Were fighting Fascist.  Making sexual assault partisan is stupid and plays into the fascist hand.
938455447819964416 2017-12-06 17:09:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jdice03 I see.  You guys think the fascist will back off after Franken is gone.  Yeah. Great plan.  Democracy is really overrated anyway. Amirite?

938450017953738752 2017-12-06 16:48:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SenKamalaHarris This is a losing strategy for the #metoo movement.  The Dems are losing to stupidity.  The fascist dont care about our morals and sexual assault is not partisan. JFC
938449178262417409 2017-12-06 16:44:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> I would rather fight the fascist for control of our democracy.  Senator Franken is willing to accept an ethics investigation.

938419586843725824 2017-12-06 14:47:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ericgarland All true. However, Romneys constant falsehoods during his campaign made it difficult to listen to him.
938416807957946371 2017-12-06 14:36:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TopherSpiro Sure. Lets allow Roger Stone to usher the US into full blown fascism.   Come on guys. AL Franken deserves a chance to clear his name.

936943490046529536 2017-12-02 13:01:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> How to lose an American Democracy in 30 years:  1. Conservative movement  2. Koch Brothers  3. Various other American oligarchs 4. Fairness Doctrine (Fox, Limbaugh etc) 5. MSM driven by profit and entertainment  6. McConnell and Ryan 7. Trump/Vlad and the Kremlin 
936941631848185857 2017-12-02 12:54:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @MSNBC @msnbc and @cnn will report on a GOP victory today.  They will readily admit the GOP did it for their donors. There will be no outrage. 
936940287146020866 2017-12-02 12:49:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @krassenstein @CHHolte The ridiculous horse race cable news coverage. The full media decision to both sides ever transgression.  Example: sexual assault and child rape are now partisan issues.  That cant happen without media assistance. 
936939412319023104 2017-12-02 12:45:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @krassenstein @CHHolte One of the reasons democracy failed in the US is because journalism failed.   Chuck Todd will announce a victory for GOP today.

936929073598795776 2017-12-02 12:04:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> The LBO of the American economy for $1.5 Trillion.  $5000 per person to extend the dire effects of white supremacy to future generations.  There should be more serious conversations at holiday dinner.

936366328113491969 2017-11-30 22:48:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @chucktodd when are you going to ask Trump to step down. Should POTUS be a role model?  Youre a waste of oxygen. 
936365904434253829 2017-11-30 22:46:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> Fuck Chuck Todd.  Sexual assault is not partisan. This is stupid.

936362812640759809 2017-11-30 22:34:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @NBCNightlyNews @CasablancaRic The key is getting rid of Chuck Todd.  Hes the best at making the fascist conservatives movement seems like a normal party.

936359647681896454 2017-11-30 22:21:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> We cant get democracy back with guys like Chuck Todd representing MSM.  The politics are more important than the people narrative is corrosive. Its why were not outraged. Theoretically we should be in the streets.

935669718295498752 2017-11-28 00:40:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @softballscifi @nedprice We dont which side POTUS is on. A land war or god forbid a nuclear war in Asia is a really bad idea.
935668698156761088 2017-11-28 00:36:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> Im doing for my donors Out loud on National TV.  We should be outraged.  They used to call that fraud.  When did it become legal to peddle the public trust? In this instance a direct quip pro quo?  This is insane.
935667003859329024 2017-11-28 00:29:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @DMiddletonCbus @EricPavlat Sure.
935665716719767552 2017-11-28 00:24:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Karoli Maybe theyre apart of the attack. 
935664684388188160 2017-11-28 00:20:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump Actually the worse part is the verification that we dont have somber  rational people in charge of the worlds largest economy.
935663898753208323 2017-11-28 00:17:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @Litzz11 For the third time with the same trick. Theyre not even brothering to throw in a middle class bone this time. Sad
935661745103925248 2017-11-28 00:08:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @chrislhayes Chris. This tax bill is criminal. Its theft using fraudulent means.  Someone has to be more explicit. 
935660974144720900 2017-11-28 00:05:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @nomoremister @EllisWeiner Its BS that media is still committed to its silly both sides narrative. The is an egregious theft. The largest single wealth transfer in human history and marketed with fraudulent propaganda. Its actually criminal behavior.

935658109925806080 2017-11-28 23:54:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> Come down folks. Mr. Fake Medals is going to jail soon.  The Kremlin is trying to distract. https://twitter.com/SheriffClarke/status/935151269009903616
935657014944034817 2017-11-28 23:49:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @DMiddletonCbus @EricPavlat The GOP is running a Ponzi Scheme level fraud on the US. We have citizens so invested in their grievances theyre allowing and cheering it on.
935647283764441088 2017-11-28 23:11:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> So..,part time OMB for largest economy on earth?  This is simply perverse.https://twitter.com/CFPBDirector/status/935577727264083970
935639573878788097 2017-11-28 22:40:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @DMiddletonCbus @EricPavlat @LeifHanson7 We are in the middle of a robbery and we still have citizens and the media using the both sides narrative. It so depressing.
935637702845837312 2017-11-28 22:33:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid @erick70115 This is insane. And were just paralyzed and watching.
935636887989051395 2017-11-28 22:29:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> I wonder if Reagan knew his tax scam would eventually lead to a point of surrendering our sovereignty to the Kremlin. 
935631989264257024 2017-11-28 22:10:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> If you dont run a hedge fund then youre either Russian or a complete fool.  The same trick for the third time. Sad.
935627486955737095 2017-11-28 21:52:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> This tax scam will put the economy in a poor position to deal with an economic downturn. It will rob millions of coverage and raise rates for millions more.  It will force cuts to SS and Medicare.  Its bad policy and terrible morally.
935618850305036288 2017-11-28 21:18:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> Trump, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Koch Brothers and Vladimir Putin are actively stealing our democracy.  We know the players and yet we just watch as our way of life changes without any real resistance.
935617454952402945 2017-11-28 21:12:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> Our democracy depends on us defending it.  Were not doing our part.  The Koch Brothers took it while we just watched.  Sadhttps://twitter.com/BruceBartlett/status/935222651785764865
935616745905192960 2017-11-28 21:09:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> When we allowed the GOP to vote on that crazy healthcare scam with no real consequences we emboldened them.  Democracy is a participation sport and were not seemingly committed to the cause. 
935613946664554501 2017-11-28 20:58:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> POTUS is very likely a Kremlin linked mobster.  Senator Corker is considering allowing him to restructure the US Tax code.   America is over. Turn out the lights.  @SenBobCorker

935612454419214337 2017-11-28 20:52:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> This is a scam.  If this goes through the US has officially ceased being a Democracy.  If we dont take to the streets then we should buy big furry hats for the winter. 
935604032621735938 2017-11-28 20:19:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> Will Senator Corker allow a Kremlin mobster to sign a tax bill that will likely cause a major recession?  If so, the US as we know it is already over. https://twitter.com/SenBobCorker/status/935562239733649408

935589921796091906 2017-11-28 19:23:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @marcorubio Senator, we cannot let a Kremlin mobster sign major tax policy. 
935589527279763456 2017-11-28 19:21:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SenJohnMcCain Senator,  we cannot let a Kremlin mobster implement  major tax policy in the US.  This is insane.

933066109867167745 2017-11-21 20:14:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> Roy Moore was menance prior to these accusations. This press conference borders on the absurd.

933049589762068484 2017-11-21 19:08:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bariweiss @quityourlife We dont need hypotheticals. Roger Stone is Kremlin connected political operative. He has a picture of a guy pretending to grab a US military flak jacket. The crime is boorish behavior.
933047989169422337 2017-11-21 19:02:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bariweiss @quityourlife Roger Stone said Hillary mudered 26 people. He also said there is a sex ring in a Pizza restaurant.  I dont believe Roger Stone even if he uses a woman as the messenger.
933047024630542337 2017-11-21 18:58:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bariweiss @quityourlife Actually its just a picture. The narrative is highly questionable
933046168015310848 2017-11-21 18:55:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bariweiss @quityourlife The Kremlin will exploit the line of thinking and destroy the process were making.  Apparently, were incapable of learning.
933045738984165376 2017-11-21 18:53:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bariweiss @quityourlife Roger Stone has a picture of Al Franken making a bad joke while he was a comedian. He added the narrative to make it into a sexual assault on par with a child molester.
933042845472165888 2017-11-21 18:42:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> Chris is still very eager to do the bidding of the Kremlin/RWNJs.

932994273670320131 2017-11-21 15:29:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump Agreed.  However, given the stakes and the circumstances we should be making a affirmative defense of Senator Franken.  When I say  we Im speaking of decent Americans, not Democrats.

932709287633276934 2017-11-20 20:36:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> The media should pretend Barack Obama is still POTUS and report according to current events. Trump would be gone by Thanksgiving. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/932706181646290945

932702128489029632 2017-11-20 20:08:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shakestweetz @Riginal_Zin Senator Al Franken is a lion in our fight to maintain a democracy. Hes a decent man. He should be allowed to maintain his integrity until we have proof to the contrary.
932700758528724993 2017-11-20 20:02:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AidenWolfe Theres a Russian mobster in the WH systematically deconstructing our democracy.  We have major media outlets parsing the Clintons  Involvment,  related to oral sex from the 90s. 
932697006119800832 2017-11-20 19:47:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bartlet4amer @AidenWolfe Fuckin aye.  To lose Al Franken to Roger Stone, Sean Hannity and Brietbart would be a huge error.

932676428893687808 2017-11-20 18:26:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shakestweetz If we let Roger Stone and Sean Hannity package a victim they will dilute the moment we are having addressing sexual assault.  Does anyone believe that have female empowerment as their goal?

932291040152838144 2017-11-19 16:54:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ProfessorShakey I voted for Clinton and he was an effective POTUS. I also remember Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr spent $70 million and two years on a corruption probe.  Meanwhile, a Kremlin connected mobster is currently in the WH.

931567698806476801 2017-11-17 17:00:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JuddLegum @rvabooklover If a claim is credible it should be investigated. To allow the Kremlin  right wing to conflate boorish behavior with predatory child molestation is how we got Trump. 
931566868242059264 2017-11-17 16:57:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JuddLegum @rvabooklover I disagree with that premise. All claims should be taken seriously. Letting the right wing define sexual assault as a partisan issue is a huge mistake.
931563832257994752 2017-11-17 16:44:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MyWchu Roy Moore is a pathological child molesters. That doesnt just go away. He will fall to continued national media scrutiny. The truth will take care of him. 
931562986212352000 2017-11-17 16:41:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JuddLegum @rvabooklover He remembers the kiss differently. The probe is a smart political move. Im concerned with Dems abandoning Franken without due process. 
931562402876882945 2017-11-17 16:39:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LindaCollins11 She a regular at Fox News and the soft core porn model has no comment of that snake pit.  Her worse experience is Al Franken 2006?  Ill say it. Its bullshit. 
931560511510065153 2017-11-17 16:31:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JuddLegum @rvabooklover I gave it a day. We need to push back. This stinks. He was pretending to grope a US military issue flak jacket.  
931559382936145922 2017-11-17 16:27:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid Roger Stone, Hannity and a soft core porn model model meet at a bar.  They have an 11 yr old picture of Al Franken grouping a flak jacket.  Leading Democrat(decent guy) down.  Have we learned nothing?

930822380804562945 2017-11-15 15:38:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @hellerspeaks Exactly. When I complain about the cost of tires for my truck, I dont usually blame the Department of Transportation. The ACA is not why healthcare is expensive. Im sorry you cant understand that.

930811489258299393 2017-11-15 14:55:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @hellerspeaks Only 17% of the population believe those ridiculous assertions. Its a wealth transfer. Dont be daft.

930804946521423872 2017-11-15 14:29:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @hellerspeaks Nothing works without taxes. Calling it subsidies doesnt change that. If you make less than $1mm youre taxes are not effected.

922933945565577216 2017-10-24 21:12:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> The Russians exploited the conservative movements 30 yrs of racial dog whistles. Not admitting that is a tragic mistake. https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin/status/922915760661348352

922929561603641346 2017-10-24 20:55:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Acguiredtaste Thats not partisan. Thats math. 
922929440555982848 2017-10-24 20:55:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Acguiredtaste It take a $1trilliin out of healthcare and still dont have enough room for the tax proposal. The money will have to come from middle class.
922928812215734272 2017-10-24 20:52:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Acguiredtaste Thats correct. But it has to fit in the budgetresolution  to pass with 51 votes. The math is there.

894331068341506048 2017-08-06 22:55:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 The libertarian/conservatives movement is utter nonsense. All of requires poor assumptions and bad strawmen. Sad
894330437455269891 2017-08-06 22:52:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BillWaters7 @RussSegner Socialist, communist, , party boss all strawmen necessary to advance your argument. ALL unnecessary in a rational fact based discussion
894327202375979008 2017-08-06 22:39:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 The US has the largest economy on earth. Where exactly has this free market successfully worked?
894326880702271490 2017-08-06 22:38:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 Free markets are a libertarian and radio shock theory. It's silly.
894326380904808448 2017-08-06 22:36:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 My healthcare is with Blue Cross    Where is the party boss?
894324912235610112 2017-08-06 22:30:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 Of course not. We should bestow that power on private interests with a profit motive. That way they will act honorably.
894324028055408642 2017-08-06 22:27:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 WTAF. We don't need healthcare because China?

894321805388914688 2017-08-06 22:18:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 The GOP can't convert grievance to policy so the just stuck with same ridiculous rhetoric. 
894321501578702850 2017-08-06 22:17:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 I'm sure you have long list of compelling strawmen.  At the end of the day, policy has to rational to be effective.
894320511873888256 2017-08-06 22:13:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BillWaters7 @RussSegner Yep. Every other advanced economy in the world is under communist control through their healthcare system. 
894318638076964864 2017-08-06 22:05:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 I've seen horses fail as a system for farming.  You can't govern by grievance.

894317045642403841 2017-08-06 21:59:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BillWaters7 @RussSegner So what if 50 million people have healthcare interrupted?  You have a theory based on book most people dismissed in high school.
894316195389820929 2017-08-06 21:56:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BillWaters7 @RussSegner Just like majic.

894313934085378048 2017-08-06 21:47:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RussSegner @BillWaters7 I don't understand these flippant assessments. Citizens lives and finances are involved with healthcare.

889693895902322688 2017-07-24 03:48:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @praisinallday I'm quite certain. Maybe you should take a closer look.
889692726802907136 2017-07-24 03:44:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @praisinallday Trump has nuke codes and clearly unstable. The whole RUSSIAN mob thing is damaging our democracy. I have issues with him.

889682837158408192 2017-07-24 03:04:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BluZephial My fault. You do seem slow. We would have to agree on the facts to have a debate. If you just deny the facts, then we're  trading comments.

889674944950546432 2017-07-24 02:33:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @praisinallday Why not. The evidence standards don't apply to Democrats. Let's just dismiss that the investigation found nothing.
889674482373328900 2017-07-24 02:31:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BluZephial Outside of Trump America facts are stubborn.  I wouldn't consider your comments as a disagreement as such.
889673137335537664 2017-07-24 02:26:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @praisinallday It's not an attack. Trump said you don't have to hide anymore. Why do you feel attcked?

884823961149853696 2017-07-11 17:17:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> It's the conservative movement empowering Trump.  Trump is just another  symptom of this  toxic movement. https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/884813352308011008
884822499334270978 2017-07-11 17:11:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> Don Jr is chum for the feeding frenzy. It's a distraction from higher ups. He's betting on a pardon. 
884821818825224193 2017-07-11 17:08:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> The conservative movement made Trump's  rise possible.  Why would they turn on him while they have power?   Focus on Mueller and FBI/CIA.

884765838112415744 2017-07-11 13:26:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SRuhle  The Trump camp is essentially making a Twitter argument. It won't work in a FBI interview.

884496573505339392 2017-07-10 19:36:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 Yes. ACA. Is a GOP plan. Romney did it first in MA.  The GOP didn't hate until Obama got it thru congress.  They're a bad lot.
884495804031021056 2017-07-10 19:33:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 My original point is the ACA is not the problem. It's the insurance market and the GOP that arevcausing all the problems.
884495323602747392 2017-07-10 19:31:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 I'm sorry to hear.  Single payer make the most sense. But ACA could easily work without GOP interference.

884493360223932418 2017-07-10 19:23:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 It will be expensive. The healthcare delivery isn't bad. Very few people really understand the market and the GOP uses that against us.
884492046861565953 2017-07-10 19:18:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 It's true but spin. Conflating all  the problems makes it difficult to understand. Ultimately it's expensive and GOP doesn't want to fix.
884491042946506752 2017-07-10 19:14:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 That should be subsidied just like it is for everyone else. It's not that hard.

884485649306443776 2017-07-10 18:53:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 Lol. It's not failing. Look at CBO  or any official report. A few areas out of thousands is not failure. It's silly.
884484571919769601 2017-07-10 18:48:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 That's correct and a political issue.  We can't let the GOP blow up the insurance market because we don't understand it.
884483859512995841 2017-07-10 18:45:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 The ACA does work and will work better without GOP obstruction.
884483435716382720 2017-07-10 18:44:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 The GOP wants you to believe any problem in healthcare is a ACA problem. Actually, the made most of those concerns better.

884480845221900290 2017-07-10 18:34:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 Insurance is too expensive. The ACA doesn't dictate rates to private insurance cos.
884480006407294976 2017-07-10 18:30:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 The ACA is a law. It's not an insurance program.  The GOP is just trying to confuse the issue to advance their agenda of no healthcare.
884478849525968898 2017-07-10 18:26:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @OliMauritania @rbridges0916 Are you referring to the exchanges?  There are only 10-12 million enrolled. That an easy fix.

884477688479666181 2017-07-10 18:21:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @KeithOlbermann Can we agree that's ridiculous?  Trump had a rag tag campaign. They knew the weaponized media manipulation would swing enough votes.

884472636918697985 2017-07-10 18:01:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MSNBC @CNN  The GOP lied for 7 yrs about the ACA. Now , somehow MSM still allows them to frame it as a promise. It's  ridiculous.

883767992806502400 2017-07-08 19:21:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Letting empty GOP talking points to get vote against your on interest is pathetic.
883767645975310343 2017-07-08 19:20:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers What ever bothers you about government will still be there after a doctor visit. It's not mutually exclusive.
883764369292759040 2017-07-08 19:06:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Polling for stupid grievances bills from congress. Of course you know that too.
883763908158394373 2017-07-08 19:05:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers If you can't see how stupid that sounds...I can't help. 
883763646320574464 2017-07-08 19:04:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers 88% of US citizens don't want to voluntarily give up there healthcare.

883760734693462016 2017-07-08 18:52:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers For the record Ayn Rand was an Atheist.
883760457810685953 2017-07-08 18:51:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Just like Jesus would do. Reclaim healthcare from the grifters that don't deserve it.
883758848154238976 2017-07-08 18:45:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Again. Completely nonsensical.  The conservative movement is a scam. Unless you're a billionaire you're a mark.
883758477486829568 2017-07-08 18:43:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Yes stabilized. Cost inflation is a fact of life. Not just in healthcare.  You assume no one what's insurance? They're all forced?  Wow
883757261914558464 2017-07-08 18:38:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Paul Ryan would be upset about you giving up the game.  He can't pass a bill because it doesn't work. You need facts and logic.

883752973540753411 2017-07-08 18:21:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers The ACA. Insured 20million fellows citizens. It stabilized the healthcare markets.  Policy by grievances gets you AHCa.
883750974879346688 2017-07-08 18:13:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers So we're just going with goofy now? A Trillion dollars out. Everything will be fine? Cmon man. 
883749380356001792 2017-07-08 18:07:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Name any GOP policy that isn't grievance based  or the solution isn't a huge donor class wealth transfer.
883748887101624320 2017-07-08 18:05:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers I may have missed it.  Tell me how taking a Trillion dollars out of Healthcare market is good for anyon.
883748428702003201 2017-07-08 18:03:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers I didn't. And could care less whether you are or not.
883748004901130240 2017-07-08 18:01:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Conservatives/libertarians like to conflate and confuse. However every solution is a tax cut for wealthy. It's a scam.
883747517149655040 2017-07-08 18:00:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> That's just stupid.  How about facts, logic and math?https://twitter.com/dgventers/status/883747057068105728
883746666087682049 2017-07-08 17:56:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers I didn't call you a rascist. I said the movement is sold using grievances. Rascism being the most reliable.
883746212817645568 2017-07-08 17:54:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers That's not important. I really don't mind you having grievances.  However you can't have policy based on it.
883745773111967744 2017-07-08 17:53:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Of course because rascism isn't real. 
883744423347204096 2017-07-08 17:47:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers None of the conservatives/libertarians nonsense fits a logical policy. It's all a tax scam powered by grievances. Rascism mostly.
883743169824903168 2017-07-08 17:42:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Theft, if working and middle class. Gift to job creators if in donor class.  Grievances drive that logic. You can't really be that daft.
883742079305875456 2017-07-08 17:38:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Lol. Yea. Sounds exactly like what you're saying. 
883741261936697345 2017-07-08 17:35:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers How is any of the libertarians nonsense compatible with Christian faith? 
883740986383511553 2017-07-08 17:34:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Great Twitter riddle.  Let the grown up handle policy.
883740270990422016 2017-07-08 17:31:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers Again. Nonsense.  Nothing is tree. It's just a dog whistle for the grievances crowd. 
883738985159380992 2017-07-08 17:26:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers The libertarians don't include actual humans in its calculations.
883738480844693506 2017-07-08 17:24:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dgventers GOP can't convert grievances to policy without exposing the emptiness of the philosophy.

883065446034964481 2017-07-06 20:49:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @HHSGov @kaylatausche @OkeyMor57 The Dems have failed to explain how the ACA mate the healthcare market vastly better for everyone. All you hear are exchange problems.
883062406309720069 2017-07-06 20:37:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TomPerez @dscc @HouseDemocrats @DNC @GOP @HHSGov @kaylatausche @OkeyMor57 Healthcare hits to close to home for everyone for the GOP to spin this away. They're trying to confuse us.

883054586348621824 2017-07-06 20:06:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HHSGov @kaylatausche @OkeyMor57 Pretty much everything the GOP says about ACA is misleading.
883054352209989632 2017-07-06 20:05:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HHSGov @kaylatausche @OkeyMor57 General point is correct. An insurer needs approval from state. There is no genenrc restaurant from state or a ACA.
883049691956613120 2017-07-06 19:47:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @kaylatausche @Tompayne76 That's not a thing. There is no Federal restrictions.

883048697415831552 2017-07-06 19:43:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HHSGov @kaylatausche @OkeyMor57 Actually there are no restrictions. Several carriers are in different states.  That's  more GOP nonsense.

882243139335061505 2017-07-04 14:22:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MarthaWolkonsky Why do you think you can't have healthcare and still be a hateful bigot?  A simple wellness visit won't stop you from being rascist on twit.
882241838823989248 2017-07-04 14:17:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MarthaWolkonsky Lol. That's hysterical and nonsensical.  You can't craft policy out of grievances.
882238282905636866 2017-07-04 14:02:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MarthaWolkonsky Therefore we should sell our sovereignty to Russia to make Trump a billionaire.  Great thinking in progress.

879525190149038081 2017-06-26 02:22:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Backstorymom1 @igorvolsky The Koch Brothers have to be convinced that the working class deserve healthcare.  It's simple.

879506088785321985 2017-06-26 01:06:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @funder @MichaelSchmel11 It's not technical difficulties. It's political. Nothing else.

879504166695075841 2017-06-26 00:58:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JohnCornyn @phuggins Healthcare hits to close to home for everyone. Really wins versus rhetoric when face to face.
879503515722362881 2017-06-26 00:55:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JohnCornyn @phuggins He's only interested in the red meat loving base. It won't work. You can't convince the most rabbid Trump fan Obama gave his kid cancer.
879496849714970624 2017-06-26 00:29:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelSchmel11 More point was actually that know one is suffering from ACA.  Insurance companies are private entities. The GOP likes to blame the ACA.
879494330473426948 2017-06-26 00:19:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SenateGOP @GOP @PoetryNEarth That's the list that dies in the blast. We'll all suffer from the nuclear winter.  A Trillion dollars leaving the healthcare market is bad.
879491850205310978 2017-06-26 00:09:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @chrislhayes  ACA has 14 million. TrumpCare drops 22million.
879489492356395009 2017-06-26 00:00:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> The ACA  exchange has 14 million insured.  Somehow TrumpCare leaves 22 million uninsured.  The donor class get a TRILLION DOLLARS. Cmon man!pic.twitter.com/t23JpiOGX5
879487766178017281 2017-06-26 23:53:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> Here are some of the people the GOP wants to save from the ravages of the ACA.pic.twitter.com/erVPQVFeix
879485950979706885 2017-06-26 23:46:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @brucepknight Hence the speed. The more you dig in the worse it gets.  There are 14 million in the exchanges. Were all able to do the math.
879485079164268544 2017-06-26 23:42:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HardballChris  If the exchanges collapsed 100% it would be better than TrumpCare. 
879484405965783041 2017-06-26 23:39:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HardballChris  TrumpCare dumps a minimum of 22 million citizens off insurance rolls.  There are 14 million in the individual exchanges. 
879482455501230081 2017-06-26 23:32:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HardballChris  Montel is correct. Everyone's ins could be weakened with benefit caps. They can take out essential benefit like pregnancy.
879479225555853313 2017-06-26 23:19:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest @magannini Is that bad?
879475601542918144 2017-06-26 23:04:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jaisle This is Tom Price's hand picked guy. These numbers are likely the best case scenario,
879473098466185216 2017-06-26 22:55:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @iRhysTay You don't have to look that far. Your insurance will likely be affected. Employer markets will see benefits caps.
879465448064110592 2017-06-26 22:24:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> This rest of us will deal with a healthcare system deprived of $1,000,000,000.  While McConnell, Ryan and Price get a refund check this yearhttps://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/879442247162482688
879462785658355712 2017-06-26 22:14:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy It is all by design  Donor class just considers everyone prey. The congress is fully controlled by Koch Network.  Cable news silent.
879458389927100420 2017-06-26 21:56:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Funny know one says a team owner is lazy when we give them $200 million for a ballpark.
879457958907826176 2017-06-26 21:54:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy We could fix healthcare and pay for public university tuition for everyone.  The GOP says that would make you lazy. 
879457449689980928 2017-06-26 21:52:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Our healthcare problems are purely political. The GOP doesn't want you to have it. Period.  Cost isn't a real issue. We can afford anything.
879456317831868416 2017-06-26 21:48:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy The ACA was a political compromise that made healthcare delivery better in this country. 20 million insured and markets stabilized.
879455853832810496 2017-06-26 21:46:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy ACA by no means a perfect system. Single payer is less expensive and produces better outcomes.
879455169372704769 2017-06-26 21:43:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Now these samevpeople are attacking all of us. Some people are still not convinced.
879453961962631169 2017-06-26 21:38:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy The GOP did there best to screw you. You still think its Obama.
879453704138698752 2017-06-26 21:37:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Facts are Perdue turned fed money. Fact Marco Rubio cut guardian provisions to control cost. Fact GOP is currently withholding payments.
879452760319643653 2017-06-26 21:34:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Attack. Confuse the issue. Soothe grievances. No healthcare.  Perfect GOP voter.
879451199904391169 2017-06-26 21:28:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Doesn't matter. ACA was designed for you. You buy the rhetoric but not the healthcare.
879447024483143680 2017-06-26 21:11:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Wait a minute that was all the bad stuff. We haven't even got to the good part.
879446478690889728 2017-06-26 21:09:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy ACA was designed with you in mind. You follow right wing proganda instead of using programs, the blame Obamacare.
879444912755945473 2017-06-26 21:03:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Enlightened me on your preferred proganda outlet.
879441613742854144 2017-06-26 20:49:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Im concerned about your grievances level.  Sean Hannity play on your emotions. I don't think intelligence has anything to do with it.
879440602768842757 2017-06-26 20:45:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy Marco Rubio cut a key funding mechanism early on. That causes uncertainty. Uncertainty raises prices. They are right now playing games w/$
879439783759683585 2017-06-26 20:42:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy The GOP governor  turned down free Federal money out of spite. That would have allowed subsidies to reach higher incomes.
879439226328240128 2017-06-26 20:40:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy In order for it to work, younger people have to participate, hence the mandates and subsidies.
879438823574392832 2017-06-26 20:38:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy If we start with the individual markets, it was the Wild West before ACA. The 10 essential health benefits set a national standard.
879438097573916672 2017-06-26 20:35:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy It's hard to answer that because we started with employer coverage and went to exchanges and Medicare/Medicaid. 3 separate things.
879436017937379328 2017-06-26 20:27:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy The GOP and right wing media takes advantage b/c it's a difficult topic to understand.  All the GOP complaints are misleading.
879435542756290560 2017-06-26 20:25:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy The individual exchanges  Stevenjust a part of ACA. The ACA is law the helps regulate the healthcare markets.
879434418368196608 2017-06-26 20:21:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy I work in the market. She ignoring the fact to project a grievance.
879433316218306560 2017-06-26 20:16:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy the expansion would have done for your situation. She clearly doesn't want Obamacare. You figure that out.
879432588141576192 2017-06-26 20:14:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy At that income level ACA or Medicaid is available.  It's clear the grievances out weighs healthcare needs. It's like a cult.
879421785560801280 2017-06-26 19:31:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> Rupert Murdoch and Sean Hannity at work.  Even  with family in peril.   Blame Obama. https://twitter.com/RightButCrunchy/status/879419850313129985
879420492603678720 2017-06-26 19:25:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelWelchAct @RightButCrunchy By keeping the ACA structure in place minus a Trillion dollars that will go to Panama.  That should help.  GL
879419346795319296 2017-06-26 19:21:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelWelchAct @RightButCrunchy Concerning the individual exchanges you're saying you make too much to qualify for subsidies?  High salary not benefits sounds like bad boss
879418812126375938 2017-06-26 19:19:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelWelchAct @RightButCrunchy You're employer may had dropped due to cost but not because of ACA.
879418524447461376 2017-06-26 19:18:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelWelchAct @RightButCrunchy That's a lot to unpack. However, you're a little off base on who to blame in that scenario. The ACA improved the cost curve for group mkts
879417228231409664 2017-06-26 19:13:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RightButCrunchy @MichaelWelchAct Unless you're very wealthy  it's going to hurt everyone.  Very few people that work for a living can afford a premature birth w/o maternity.
879415740960518144 2017-06-26 19:07:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MichaelWelchAct @RightButCrunchy How exactly did the you lose insurance?
879412896056389633 2017-06-26 18:55:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> If we let the GOP get away with calling this tax scam a healthcare plan, then democracy has failed in the US.

879396176738619393 2017-06-26 17:49:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> GOP/Cable news 'Dupe of the day':  Trump colluded with Putin to become POTUS.   Obama was a black POTUS when it happened.   BOTH SIDES... 
879394833969893377 2017-06-26 17:44:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Also don't confuse Trump with the conservative movement. The conservative are trying to steal Trillion dollars and tell us its healthcare.
879394223182798849 2017-06-26 17:41:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Hey, go big or go home.  Can't risk treason then start half stepping. It wouldn't be prudent. 
879393584088322048 2017-06-26 17:39:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf He doesn't appear to like the job. If he can save himself and Ivanka it could be enough.  Maybe wishful thinking. 
879392943475503105 2017-06-26 17:36:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Lol. Where not screwed. Take a breath. Every GOP admin in my life time has been corrupt.
879390665330786312 2017-06-26 17:27:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Mueller has them nailed to a wall. But we will have constitutional showdown trying to prosecute POTUS.  Easier to get him to quit.
879390196399255552 2017-06-26 17:25:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Ivanka is the key. It's the only thing outside of his image he cares about. She's the leverage to get him to step down.
879389340547371008 2017-06-26 17:22:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g @IsaLeeWolf Agreed. My point is still the public sentiment matters. The GOP had all the facts. The won't impeach until necessary and will always cover.
879388550172684290 2017-06-26 17:19:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf I would predict he doesn't go to jail. Ivanka won't go to jail. He turns on spy ring and campaign finance ring and 60-90 people get jail.
879387875598622724 2017-06-26 17:16:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf Don't get me wrong he deserves it. He might get it. It will be his call. If he fights until end there can be no alternative.
879387127863267328 2017-06-26 17:13:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g @IsaLeeWolf When the Republicans house (Newt) impeached Clinton has approval ratings went up. Overall we still call bulshit when pushed.
879386315057451008 2017-06-26 17:10:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf @altug_g Lol. It absolutely was hacked. They are being paid and blackmailed. Putin didn't risk war without some assurances outside Trump team.
879385657478705152 2017-06-26 17:07:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump @IsaLeeWolf I agree they are capable now, but we the people are still here. Know one wants POTUS in jail. Even if Ttump currently fit the description.
879384452081872896 2017-06-26 17:02:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g Sure they can. He's just need to get out of the WH. I personally think he's just another GOP crook.  My goal is Finger off the button now.
879383606321393666 2017-06-26 16:59:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g Trump in obvious collusion with Putin is equal to Obama being black when Pitin attacked.  Both are bad to GOP.
879382994418585600 2017-06-26 16:56:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g Hillary is a few months old. Yet none of GOP or cable news can recall the pearls clutch over post classified emails.
879382032048062464 2017-06-26 16:53:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g Every Democratic POTUS going forward would have to fear prison. That wouldn't be good.
879381465561276416 2017-06-26 16:50:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @4everNeverTrump @altug_g He deserves jail. If he fights and gets dragged out, he will go to jail. If he steps down ,it's an easy sell not to jail POTUS.
879380576943394816 2017-06-26 16:47:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @seanhannity @NanPitre @CharlesTheHamr @StocksAllUp The sitting AG can have an opinion on a politically motivated investigation.   You have to be a Republican to see these things as equal
879379027601088512 2017-06-26 16:41:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> The conservative movement openly gaslighting the American public.   THIS IS A TRILLION $ WEALTH TRANSFER!! PERIODhttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/879023658789949440
879377519899795456 2017-06-26 16:35:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @altug_g @4everNeverTrump Putting a POTUS In jail is an incredibly slippery slope. Hopefully Trump won't force that decision.
879375752583684096 2017-06-26 16:28:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @4everNeverTrump Conservative movement propaganda made us a easy target for Putin. Have any of them stop pushing it?

879370002851401728 2017-06-26 16:05:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid  Ask Paul Ryan , Mitch McConnell and Tom Price how big their tax cut will be personally? How big will the refund check be now?

879359546980003840 2017-06-26 15:23:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AliVelshi   If possible can you squeeze in a segment on the GOP attacks on ACA. The exchange problems used as talking put are caused by GOP
879358971081097217 2017-06-26 15:21:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AliVelshi  Thank you for explaining healthcare to the American public. We need more cable news journalist up to speed on this topic.

879145554122604545 2017-06-25 01:13:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Yep.
879144772195295233 2017-06-25 01:10:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Cable news feeds on the horse race. Always bow to GOP rhetoric. It's dangerous.
879143660201422849 2017-06-25 01:05:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Only in politics would you consider losing an operator of Pelosi's level. It's really stupid. Really
879143163302223873 2017-06-25 01:03:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX If we get back to governing we need Pelosi to get shit done. End of story.
879142849580867584 2017-06-25 01:02:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX I think we need to quit rigging the votes. GOP gerrymandering and voter trick are the problem. There's plenty national talent.

879138605486280704 2017-06-25 00:45:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX All conservative rhetoric. They just want the money. The negative policy outcomes are a bonus.

879137043053518848 2017-06-25 00:39:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX This could very possibly turn out well. Could root out a lot of corruption. Could get worse. Healthcare bill will be major data point.

879130145382162437 2017-06-25 00:12:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Yes. It was a goofy plan. You can't take over the world with US IC. Lol. They're idiots. Trust fund babies gone wrong.

879126717926961152 2017-06-25 23:58:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX No idea. Just would seem to make sense. Maybe just some Dem operatives.  Putin risked war. This runs deep.
879125709179953152 2017-06-25 23:54:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX You can't be a national politician GOP contender w/o Koch Network money.  Legally corrupted.  Putin made higher bid to corrupt men.

879123324244307968 2017-06-25 23:45:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Of course Putin spent his formative years in the KGB mastering geopolitical propaganda.  We where too easy.

879122488688611328 2017-06-25 23:41:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX The theme music has been playing for years. Fox News was Ray Charles level genius. Dark and evil, but genius.  Trump showed a little thigh.
879121583104819203 2017-06-25 23:38:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX Great value proposition this time. Trump promised to restore the order. Do you want it to continue to be a white country? All told. Yeah.
879120864096251905 2017-06-25 23:35:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TrueFactsStated  What's up with Tim Ryan D-OH?
879119754266587137 2017-06-25 23:30:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX My point was taking a Trillion out of the healthcare market is an assault on everyone.
879119379388129281 2017-06-25 23:29:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AmerickaX We can afford the debt. You ever notice it's only a concern during Democratic admin.
879118818903248898 2017-06-25 23:27:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> The working poor don't have a Trillion dollars to steal. Cable news won't help. Stay salty.
879118010145013766 2017-06-25 23:24:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> We bailed out the US financial industry with $780 Billion. With a B. Not a T.  They're stealing from us. Not the working poor. That's spin.
879117281443401728 2017-06-25 23:21:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> Quick question: When's the last time you used the word TRILLION in a sentence?

878969657218215937 2017-06-25 13:34:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> Fun fact: In 2008 the US used $780 billion to bailout the financial sector.   In 2017 the GOP want take $900 billion out of the healthcare.

878323168951230464 2017-06-23 18:45:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CraigFelder It's not healthcare. It's a tax cut putting the US healthcare markets in peril. The unintended consequences are hard to imagine.

878281412536745985 2017-06-23 15:59:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LeoKapakosNY @TDPRobert That's sounds  suspiciously like all the RWNJ and Russian rhetoric.
878281061792272385 2017-06-23 15:58:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LeoKapakosNY @TDPRobert It's tough to contradict yourself in under 140 characters. 
878277040159342593 2017-06-23 15:42:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 All the trolls have the same line. Show me evidence.  However, no standard of evidence can be articulated. In essence, prove a negative. 
878275195240275968 2017-06-23 15:34:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LeoKapakosNY @TDPRobert Cool. Now in the land of adults that has little to do with Pelosi's effectiveness as a Democratic leader.
878274613184266240 2017-06-23 15:32:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 I asked Twitter if anyone has FBI files to review. Sadly know one did. Therefore there's no investigation.  Brilliant strategy. 
878271596452098048 2017-06-23 15:20:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 There's your big flaw. The FBI is going to use US criminal code.  You think they should use a standard of evidence you refuse to identify.
878269913500012544 2017-06-23 15:13:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 If the evidence doesn't matter to you that's fine. To say it doesn't exist make you a liar or stupid.

878261718509469696 2017-06-23 14:41:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @greta @TrueFactsStated @bartlet4amer Yep. One ofvthe very rare times I don't agree with Claude's assessment.
878260988243562497 2017-06-23 14:38:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LeoKapakosNY @TDPRobert That kinda silly but ok.  The adults in the party realize political rhetoric may help with elections but it does nothing for governing.
878260389389193216 2017-06-23 14:36:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 I hope you understand that I can't prosecute.  The FBI/IC is investigating.  Maybe you should tweet at Mueller.

878259021962072064 2017-06-23 14:30:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @alexlloyd723 The conservative movement turned the GOP into a criminal grievance movement. Cable news is still doing both sides. 
878257411949068288 2017-06-23 14:24:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 The FBI/IC is concerned enough to launch several investigations. They like the evidence.  What would the evidence you need look like?
878256799065026561 2017-06-23 14:21:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 Do a little homework. We can chat later.   What would qualify as evidence for Trump?

878255288238735363 2017-06-23 14:15:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 All your arguments fall apart as soon as you try to verify the facts.  You simply avoid the facts you don't like.
878254969476042754 2017-06-23 14:14:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YouTube @AlisonTheiss2 @RickyAgyekum2 Some no evidence will be good enough. You're not interested in evidence.  Why can't you just be honest about that.
878254077653680128 2017-06-23 14:11:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LeoKapakosNY @TDPRobert That's fair. Unfortunately we still have to pass laws.  We can't afford to lose Nancy at this critical time.

878237460215599104 2017-06-23 13:05:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PolitikMasFina Pelosi not turning Newt's old seat is RWNJ reasoning for removing a leader.  This is silly.

877962427605725184 2017-06-22 18:52:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RickyAgyekum2 @pdx_mavs This is even worse. A single payer system would require a transition tax but would be much cheaper and stabilize the market.  Just greed.

877633355218468864 2017-06-21 21:04:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ @NicolleDWallace Higher premiums and more. NONE of this is limited to the exchanges/individual markets (read:working poor).  This means YOU and I are losing.
877632387315671040 2017-06-21 21:00:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ @NicolleDWallace Lose of coverage, higher medical costs, pre-exiting conditions, reduced promity to care, medical financial risk, cap on coverage,
877631439579344898 2017-06-21 20:56:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ @NicolleDWallace The intrigue. It's silly   200 million people will experience negative outcomes from this bill.
877630684667490304 2017-06-21 20:53:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ @NicolleDWallace This will be a body blow to the middle class. GOP/cable news pushing working poor handouts narrative. The USmedia  audience doesn't care.

877481834728370177 2017-06-21 11:02:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Morning_Joe   Why can't the conservatives pass a bill?  Because all their  rhetoric is fraudulent.   All of it. All of it.
877481285236686849 2017-06-21 11:00:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> #morningjoe Know one voted for a huge tax cut for the wealthy cut to replace their HC. The GOP promised lower premiums and better care. 
877477133588844550 2017-06-21 10:43:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Morning_Joe  Can anyone identify one conservative policy that not actually a tax cut.  It's all spin.

876970597372264450 2017-06-19 01:10:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> Fun fact: Paul Ryan is attempting the largest one event wealth shift in modern history.

876946952797265920 2017-06-19 23:37:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PersistShe Paul Ryan doesn't care. He can send $900 billion to tax shelters all over the Caribbean. It will be great right?   THIS A GODDAMN SCANDAL!!
876945753280831488 2017-06-19 23:32:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PersistShe When people get the bill for assistant  living centers for their parents, who can barely afford their medicine, without Medicare...
876944413657894914 2017-06-19 23:26:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PersistShe Paul Ryan is well aware of these things. This is criminal level cruelty.  It's bad for the economy, so it's just unadulterated greed.

876941514215219200 2017-06-19 23:15:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @MSNBC Cable news just parrots the negative rhetoric from GOP because they're too lazy to understand it. @msnbc Except for Ali. He's the only one.
876940925074894849 2017-06-19 23:13:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> Not just rolled out. Lil Marco cut a key finding source. They challenged and smeared from beginning. GOP govs REFUSED federal$   20m insured
876938113070837761 2017-06-19 23:01:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> The Democratic should be beating them over the head with these simple truths 24/7.  Mueller has TRUMP on a spit. He's almost ready.
876937574178316292 2017-06-19 22:59:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> In hindsight it a brilliant piece of legislation. Thx Obama.  Paul Ryan wants to ship $900 billion  to Panamanian tax shelters and kill it.
876936732662431747 2017-06-19 22:56:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> It also stabilized and improved and industry that represents 1/6 of our GDP.  Which is the real reason it's proven so difficult to repeal.
876936062714695680 2017-06-19 22:53:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> It did a great job insuring 20 million including the working poor, but it's so much more!  It vastly improved the healthcare for everyone.
876935420478709761 2017-06-19 22:51:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> It's also a perfect time to change the perception of ACA. The GOP and guillibe cable news framed it as hand out to the working poor.
876926693092601856 2017-06-19 22:16:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @NBCNightlyNews @brianbeutler @gregggonsalves It's not just the working poor taking a hit.

876547653584203778 2017-06-18 21:10:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WayneDupreeShow @Marie10066461 So do we believe Trump or his lawyer?

876542628589957125 2017-06-18 20:50:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WayneJ28791698 @wrow51 I guess. It's really works better when the president is not being investigated for espionage.  That's just me.
876540988684206081 2017-06-18 20:43:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WayneJ28791698 @wrow51 Right. Hence the confusion. He said it in a tweet.  Is that the best source. Asking for one liberal only.

876116135153995776 2017-06-17 16:35:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jeffleins @dmcparson @everlong554 Less than 5% unemployment. Trickle down will start in just a minute. Look up. 
876115693284077568 2017-06-17 16:33:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jeffleins @dmcparson @everlong554 Come on guys. You can still be angry after a wellness visit.  I guarantee it. If you like your anger, you can keep your anger. 
876115159412080641 2017-06-17 16:31:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jeffleins @dmcparson @everlong554 A billionaire pays a guy $30 million to convince you that anything for the working class is socialist. 
876114150459662336 2017-06-17 16:27:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PhilipRucker @JLongGallegos Have you ever heard him speak like a regular human?  That won't work under oath? Not with a counter terorisn investigation.
876113542193262592 2017-06-17 16:25:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jeffleins @dmcparson @everlong554 It's an anology for starving grandma and taking away her medicine.
876113047911366656 2017-06-17 16:23:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jeffleins @dmcparson @everlong554 Actually single payer is better. ACA was a conservative plan to try for partisan support. 
876112608394444800 2017-06-17 16:21:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 A billionaire paid a guy $30 million dollars to believe that. It's really sad.    We can't afforded in the best con yet
876111991739473921 2017-06-17 16:19:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @everlong554 @jeffleins @dmcparson I understand you don't care about liberal citizens. But what about the conservative ones. They need healthcare also.
876110470205276162 2017-06-17 16:13:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 You can still be angry after a wellness visit.  I'll still be a liberal. All the memes will still be available for Twitter. 
876110068923715584 2017-06-17 16:11:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Again they have convinced you your grievances exceeds your self interest.
876109011703169030 2017-06-17 16:07:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Sound great.   Iin reality they passed a bill cutting $900 billion in taxes and called it AHCA.pic.twitter.com/OQtmIRVJao
876108368083079168 2017-06-17 16:04:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Koch, Murdoch and Hannity disagree. 
876108145415917568 2017-06-17 16:03:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Actually I'm not alone.  Every other industrialized country in the world  agrees.
876107514592583680 2017-06-17 16:01:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Yep. That's great theory. In the meantime real people have to deal with their health.
876107104427364352 2017-06-17 15:59:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Koch, Murdoch and Hannity tell you healthcare is out of reach.  Come on man. 
876106816660393984 2017-06-17 15:58:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 $18trillion GDP. Record stock market. 5% unemployment    Record Corp earnings. Record CEO pay.  Trillions iin offfshorr tax shelters.
876105223709786114 2017-06-17 15:52:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @and @dmcparson @everlong554 No bow. Just act like an adult.  You can be tough, angry , rascist or Nazi.  Who cares.  It shouldn't effect your healthcare. Smh
876103878256754688 2017-06-17 15:46:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 If you can't explain in simple terms. The facts are bad or you don't understand the topic.  That applies to any topic.
876103543505264640 2017-06-17 15:45:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Lol. The premise of an anolgy is to simply.
876103057167220742 2017-06-17 15:43:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Spouting Fox News false talking points can't explain the $900 billion tax cut
876102200564625409 2017-06-17 15:40:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Let's say that's true.  How does robbing the system of 900 billion help?
876100147087802368 2017-06-17 15:32:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 $900 Billion sucked out of healthcare markets and you some how think it will be better.  Math much. 
876099128014643202 2017-06-17 15:28:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 A billionaire pays a guy $30 million to be angry about Your healthcare.  Billionaire gets huge tax cut.   You're not even  suspicious ?
876097784142843904 2017-06-17 15:22:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Again policy not your thing. Easy annology.  You want a Coke. We have Pepsi. You light your hair on fire.   Great solution?
876096985241190401 2017-06-17 15:19:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 You sited CBO. It's doesn't support that. But good story.
876096324856422400 2017-06-17 15:16:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 You could. It would be violent and illegal. So...
876095793350004736 2017-06-17 15:14:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 You can be a rascist and a tough guy on Twitter and have healthcare.  How about that.  Let's not let Paul destroy healthcare.
876095085821276163 2017-06-17 15:12:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 You don't seem like a policy wonk. I'll make it easy.   ACA minus 900,000,000,000 tax cut for top 1% equals TrumpCare.
876093687532593153 2017-06-17 15:06:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Good job Vlad.  Koch Brothers( $80 bill) pay Sean Hannity $30 million to convince you rascism is more important than healthcare. Sad
876092545058709504 2017-06-17 15:01:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Did you know Russia has universal healthcare?
876092091989995521 2017-06-17 15:00:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Yep. That's science. 
876091857725513728 2017-06-17 14:59:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 It's Shakespeare.  I have google if I wanted to look up Nazi propaganda.  You've gotta do better.
876091232149221378 2017-06-17 14:56:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 We all have google.
876090586129997824 2017-06-17 14:54:07 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Ok the way it is or TrumpCare?
876090287008993285 2017-06-17 14:52:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Any thoughts on healthcare?
876089846955225088 2017-06-17 14:51:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Jr i really don't care if you play a rascist on Twitter.  Why you have to craft a victim narrative first is just confusing.
876089001001791488 2017-06-17 14:47:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 No idea.   How do feel about healthcare?
876088462511931393 2017-06-17 14:45:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 How do feel about healthcare?

876086123147255809 2017-06-17 14:36:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Wait...wit?

876084948792422400 2017-06-17 14:31:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @everlong554 @dmcparson Can't you guys come up with a better straw man.  Kinda pathetic. 
876084478405480448 2017-06-17 14:29:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 How about you relax. It's a nice day. Go outside for a walk.
876084105955430400 2017-06-17 14:28:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Are you saying it's not a white power symbol?
876083104380846080 2017-06-17 14:24:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Shakespeare.   It's silly.
876082385556819968 2017-06-17 14:21:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Yep. I'm hoping you're not one of them.
876081621451104257 2017-06-17 14:18:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 With all the violence from left going on, you took your talents to the park for a play. 
876081157464621056 2017-06-17 14:16:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Shakespeare was in on it I guess. 
876080777037053954 2017-06-17 14:15:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 It's distressing to think there are people who can be influenced by an argument that thin. 
876080316221468673 2017-06-17 14:13:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid   Joy you can't clown your guest.
876079205511036929 2017-06-17 14:08:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Exactly. It's silly
876079007749558272 2017-06-17 14:08:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Cool story.   I'll consider that.   How will that effect the FBI/IC?
876077685759496193 2017-06-17 14:02:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PhilipRucker @jhaygood @storyseen Possible. Let's see who is indicted.
876076931954991104 2017-06-17 13:59:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson @everlong554 Nice try Vlad.  None of this is going to stop the FBI investigation.
876074953019449346 2017-06-17 13:52:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @everlong554 @dmcparson Yep.  Violence by Shakespeare.  Get a grip.
876073415878246400 2017-06-17 13:45:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Lol. You should write a book. 
876072560227749892 2017-06-17 13:42:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson The second the violence in Chicago effects someone other than POC I'm sure you'll really care.
876070079548575745 2017-06-17 13:32:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Cool. Violence exists in Chicago.  Are you for more?
876065951418068992 2017-06-17 13:16:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Did you have your white sheets cleaned for the weekend?

876064494157541376 2017-06-17 13:10:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jpodhoretz @TCBettini The conservative movement turned the GOP into a criminal cabal.
876064127659237376 2017-06-17 13:08:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson There is a mass shooting in this country every day.   Of course cherry picking outrage has become and art form.
876062788111798272 2017-06-17 13:03:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Why are only white supremacist and trolls tweeting about this.  Quite telling.
876060414936846337 2017-06-17 12:54:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Steal from more sick children?
876057675158749184 2017-06-17 12:43:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TDPRobert Yep. They completely made the step from race-baiting to full support of Nazi's.
876057220231901184 2017-06-17 12:41:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> The trolls are out in force pushing violence narrative. 
876055959382241280 2017-06-17 12:36:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dmcparson Shakespeare Is not a liberal. This is silly.

875926655507857408 2017-06-16 04:02:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigJBeezy @ProfessorShakey @magnumpi032003 Or maybe you shouldn't take it personally. There 100million liberals. I don't want to judge by 3. Ok?
875918725706285056 2017-06-16 03:31:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigJBeezy @magnumpi032003 You see the solution ascproducing a conservative nut job? More violence?
875917753961631745 2017-06-16 03:27:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> Either you're civil or you're the shooter. Easy Hope you stay this side.
875916217181237248 2017-06-16 03:21:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> David. That's a reason to be concerned. Doesn't rise to the level of attacking a play or assaulting citizens. Right?
875915129866637313 2017-06-16 03:16:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigJBeezy @magnumpi032003 If liberals just being there upsets you...maybe you're the violent one.

875913843549097984 2017-06-16 03:11:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> I doubt it.  But you've got your gun, right? So all good. Settle down.   Shakespeare hasn't taken down a POTUS in history.
875912247368970240 2017-06-16 03:05:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> Ouch.   Are you going to storm a little league game also?
875911442603663360 2017-06-16 03:02:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigJBeezy @magnumpi032003 John. Come on.   Is Shakespeare a liberal?
875910921721454592 2017-06-16 03:00:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> This is hilarious     This tough want to storm a play in park because of the violence.   Apparently Shakespeare saw Ttump coming.https://twitter.com/Dogtownz/status/875906307311583232
875908897021841408 2017-06-16 02:52:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigJBeezy @magnumpi032003 Nope. Shakespeare Wasn't stopped for Obama or Bush or Clinton or Reagan.
875908470230396930 2017-06-16 02:50:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JaynePenelope Shakespeare Is shorter.

875902841294139392 2017-06-16 02:28:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @fumbelsmcstupid All the violence yet you choose a play in a park.
875901002947362817 2017-06-16 02:20:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @fumbelsmcstupid Do You think he wrote a play about Trump?  Or you think this will end the investigation?
875900480664240130 2017-06-16 02:18:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @DRUDGE_REPORT @SdBWorking Shakespeare In the park.  Go get tiger. Short and picnic baskets no match for you.

875761657225646081 2017-06-16 17:07:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PhilipRucker @jhaygood Too early for that. Also Ryan is complicit.

875713390341226496 2017-06-16 13:55:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LadyWhiteWalker Trump biggest problem is he's guilty of everything. Special prosecutor is a nightmare.  His business model has been fraud since late 80's.
875710578924429312 2017-06-16 13:44:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @LadyWhiteWalker Money laundering involves the kids. That's where he's vulnerable.

874474731675820033 2017-06-12 03:53:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @devchelle @JosephGReilly62 So Vlad in summation the US is doing it completely wrong. 
874473849089392641 2017-06-12 03:49:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JosephGReilly62 @devchelle Actually he just explained no more interpretations is needed. He's got this. 
874473327770906625 2017-06-12 03:47:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @devchelle @JosephGReilly62 Civics and constitution law.  Yep. Exactly the same.  How old are you??
874472968214261760 2017-06-12 03:46:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @devchelle @JosephGReilly62 SCOTUS can clear their calendar. I don't know how I missed that. English. It's so simple. Right there.
874471504569933824 2017-06-12 03:40:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @devchelle @JosephGReilly62 So basically you see a document then freely interpet any way you like. Then tweet a few times.  Just like majic healthcare is no longer.

874465762685177856 2017-06-12 03:17:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TrueFactsStated Any day a FBI counterintelligence agent comes a knocking it's not a good day. You're guilt or innocence is irrelevant.

874459467563372545 2017-06-12 02:52:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @janemiami @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @fannyfae Paul Ryan is a complete fraud. He can't navigate the technical issues as policy "wonk". It's so reckless it's breath taking.

874458505750753280 2017-06-12 02:48:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @janemiami @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @fannyfae It actually worse than the votes. It's could cause a calamity in the healthcare markets. It's really reckless. The unintended issues..:

874456031262330880 2017-06-12 02:38:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @GOP @janemiami @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @fannyfae The GOP could repair the damage this week if they desired.  Fun fact. They don't.

874440795486650368 2017-06-12 01:38:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @BoredLosing @janemiami It's ok to be an uncaring human being. You're not alone. Why you have to attack healthcare is perplexing. 
874440360440868865 2017-06-12 01:36:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @BoredLosing @janemiami They don't. They're attached to very high incomes.  Tres's are funny. But people have family's.
874439867559751682 2017-06-12 01:34:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @janemiami You sign up in the million dollar income line. That's who paying the subsidies.  Go to bed. Are you old enough to vote?
874439351295496192 2017-06-12 01:32:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @janemiami That's not true. It's real life for adults. Take a day or two and understand the ACA. You don't have a clue.
874438946872336384 2017-06-12 01:31:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery Me too. Some Dems going down also. This is huge.
874438717406097408 2017-06-12 01:30:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated The premiums could stabilize with risk mitigation  denied by GOP.  Most don't appreciate the improvements to the employer markets.
874438020535123969 2017-06-12 01:27:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated Yes I can. Most of the complaints would be addressed. The funding would have allowed for subsidies at higher incomes.
874437450977988615 2017-06-12 01:25:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TinaMarie88888 @TrueFactsStated @janemiami Nope
874436932998180864 2017-06-12 01:23:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami That's hardly millions.  All policy includes basic wellness without charge.  Private ins companies set rates. YOU understanding ACA.
874436006354833408 2017-06-12 01:19:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami @TrueFactsStated @TinaMarie88888 ACA is successful in spite of GOP. It's hard to repeal because of multiple stake holders involved in process.
874435478514270208 2017-06-12 01:17:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami @TrueFactsStated @TinaMarie88888 They have sabotaged from the beginning, it's not just adjustments. Rubio killed a key funding element. SCOTUS effected Medicaid expanse.
874433755854884868 2017-06-12 01:10:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @janemiami How did it take healthcare from millions?
874432906713812994 2017-06-12 01:07:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery I'm not sure. But they need to call someone. The IC and FBI are pissed.
874429989508321280 2017-06-12 00:55:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery I've got nothing past Klingon.
874429181513396226 2017-06-12 00:52:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery It also explains the personal responsibility mantra that quickly flips to Hillary//Obama did it whenever necessary. Aliens. It's so clear.
874427889789394946 2017-06-12 00:47:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery Alien thing way better. Probably Klingon. They tend to suck up to Russians.

874420951680790528 2017-06-12 00:19:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery It's just new for American. We not used to cabinet members being soft. 
874420615914156036 2017-06-12 00:18:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @buckeyery It's make sense. Comes from the top. Trump flufffs Putin. Cabinet fluffs him.  I see it now.

874326618155749376 2017-06-12 18:04:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> It problematic that this will suffice as an argument for 20-25 percent of US.  Unfortunately that's enough for a Vlad/Trump to control GOPhttps://twitter.com/JosephGReilly62/status/874325574923276289

874323173839392769 2017-06-12 17:51:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> RWNJ's and Russian disinformation use same techniques.  Strawmen arguments and absurd arguments to stimulate debate.https://twitter.com/JosephGReilly62/status/874319837241192448

874143951422468097 2017-06-11 05:58:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey I do prefer the American version.
874143564875300864 2017-06-11 05:57:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey Fox News is a proganda outfit not news.  Megyn Kelly can build a career race baiting and move to network. That's disgusting and bad for demo
874142535794528257 2017-06-11 05:53:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey Lol. That's silly. Paul Ryan is a hood, a crook, a liar, a thief.
874142083518517249 2017-06-11 05:51:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey I'm concerned about what's missing from the content. In a democracy the media job is to keep the public informed and hold powerful to acct.
874141503974768641 2017-06-11 05:49:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey Here's a better question for you. Which news organization has made it plan that Paul Ryan is a fraud. He's a demagogue and a policy clown.

874138432171372548 2017-06-11 05:36:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CaNettoyant @ProfessorShakey All of them. The GOP is a defacto criminal cabal.  You're comparing them to Twitter trolls.  What else do they have to do for you to see it.

873914876309229570 2017-06-11 14:48:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 So not conservative Jesus, then.
873914201122779136 2017-06-11 14:45:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 Snap with a twist.  I guess that settled it.

873908254711173120 2017-06-11 14:22:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 Last time. The ACA is a law that effects all insurance markets. The exchanges that you,and Jesus, hate is only  a part of it. It does help

873903527621529600 2017-06-11 14:03:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 The GOP can't pass anything bc it's all BS.  7 yrs and no plan. Really?  And yet you still believe Twitter memes because...liberals? 
873903012279877632 2017-06-11 14:01:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 We can't govern with ignorance. When greviance meets reality it's always a problem.

873897034289467393 2017-06-11 13:37:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Miriam2626 Trump could bomb Sacramento and CNN would have a both sides debate.
873896182845779969 2017-06-11 13:34:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 The GOP has convinced you that policy can be crafted by grievance. It's silly.
873895813306601472 2017-06-11 13:32:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 Again, simply because you refuse to understand the ACA and have grievances is no reason to lose healthcare.
873895006242824192 2017-06-11 13:29:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 Unless you make $1mill per annum. You're not. Small details.
873892116983930880 2017-06-11 13:18:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 Can you at least remove Jesus from your profile?

873890309847097345 2017-06-11 13:11:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YCCOTSL @MTcowboy3250 You can maintain your grievances and have healthcare. No reason to be mutually exclusive.

871050021524955136 2017-06-03 17:04:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jhaygood @RDubJr @paulhue Conservatives version. No because debt is higher than income.

871028811621650433 2017-06-03 15:40:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @juliawb The conservative movement turned the GOP into a criminal cabal.  CNN is saying both sides. It's insane.

869832335029567488 2017-05-31 08:26:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SpeakerRyan @CNN @Titou4004 Trump's to busy being Putin errand boy with NATO to care. He's not a conservative.  Jeb! might have gotten Ryan's plan thru. Think on that.
869830511744749568 2017-05-31 08:18:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SpeakerRyan @CNN @Titou4004 Steal public education funds under the  guise of choice. Steal $800 billion and call it healthcare.  The conservatives should be shunned.
869829783584157696 2017-05-31 08:15:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SpeakerRyan @CNN @Titou4004 Agreed
869829202199146496 2017-05-31 08:13:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SpeakerRyan @CNN @Titou4004 Yes. Not just him.  Seriously, any conservative policy that sounds reasonable, run it out logically. It's all a tax/privilege scam.
869826821558337538 2017-05-31 08:04:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Paul Ryan passed a bill to transfer $870 billion in wealth from the working poor and middle class to the top 1%.  Is that bad?
869825852472741888 2017-05-31 08:00:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Yep. It didn't just happen. Trump rode the wave. Some now all in ,other are like wasn't me.  A  Jeb! admin would look exactly the same.
869824527479517184 2017-05-31 07:55:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @puppymnkey @gtoledo3 Viewing Trump as a menace is a low bar. The administration would be the same minus Russia with Jeb!
869824063761514496 2017-05-31 07:53:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @puppymnkey @gtoledo3 Nope. It's a scam. All of it. They know that or not very bright.
869823473744588800 2017-05-31 07:50:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Lol. I need the choir to listen. They mainstreamed conservatives. They're the problem. We need a moderate GOP to get democracy back on track
869822841826545664 2017-05-31 07:48:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @puppymnkey @gtoledo3 I'm sure he hates Trump. Saying you're still conservative after this shit show gives me pause
869822165805346816 2017-05-31 07:45:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 The conservative movement hijacked the GOP in the 80's. Direct line to Trump.
869821913564164096 2017-05-31 07:44:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Ok. Try this. Pick any conservative policy.  Try to run it out to a logical conclusion. It's all nonsense.
869820317233012737 2017-05-31 07:38:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Jeff Zucker doesn't even bother to deny it's a clown show.
869819992841351169 2017-05-31 07:37:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Great life spirit. Still if we don't accept the real root of the problem it never gets corrected.
869819083407183872 2017-05-31 07:33:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Or the conservative movement is completely fraudulent. A tax/privledge scam fueled by grievances.
869817865968521216 2017-05-31 07:28:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Titou4004 Micheal Steele. The rest think Trump is ridiculous.

822153222748045312 2017-01-19 18:46:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @bubbasnowboards @ddale8 Yea. We've seen this movie before. It wasn't a hit with POC.
822152836058333184 2017-01-19 18:44:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ddale8 @bubbasnowboards what do imagine they would say differently?
822150275246985218 2017-01-19 18:34:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joemed3 If we survive Trump and ignore the root of the evil it will just cycle back.
822149803199123457 2017-01-19 18:32:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joemed3 Those are features not bugs. We are underestimating the level of cruelty inherent in authoritarian regimes.
822148337914806272 2017-01-19 18:26:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joemed3 Trump is P T Barnum but the conservative movement created the circus.
822147856429629440 2017-01-19 18:24:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joemed3 He doesn't care about policy. This cabinet is GOP all the way. Check out Jeb! cheering the picks.

820462497408937985 2017-01-14 02:47:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @u4eahh @JordanChariton Trump is a raging rascist strongman. Possibly compromised by a hostile power. You look up J Lewis for malfeasance.
820462023075131392 2017-01-14 02:46:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JordanChariton @basedbryank @u4eahh My point is John Lewis is a national treasure.
820461238270459904 2017-01-14 02:42:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JordanChariton @u4eahh @basedbryank I would try to explain it but you just seem too stupid. Don't slur John Lewis.
820460442036408321 2017-01-14 02:39:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JordanChariton @u4eahh @basedbryank Grow up.

820459646800560128 2017-01-14 02:36:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JordanChariton @u4eahh @basedbryank Its a stupid comment he has no standing to make. This purity bs is not helping anything.
820459094767239169 2017-01-14 02:34:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @u4eahh @JordanChariton So if we check your advertisers they're all pure. No cheap labor. No tax advoidance.
820458328287510528 2017-01-14 02:31:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JordanChariton The man literally laid his life in the line. You're talking shit in a studio. Get a fucking grip.

819974339550269440 2017-01-13 18:28:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TR0bbins its a procedure to avoid needing 60 votes. Intent remains the same. Did you read the article?

819969057713688576 2017-01-13 18:07:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @kurteichenwald @TR0bbins The GOP stopped all the funding they could long ago. That contributed to rate spikes. Kept more people from subs.

819965493696221184 2017-01-13 17:53:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> What does it say about the GOP that he had to become a right wing bot to run?
819964994704068609 2017-01-13 17:51:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> Slow down. I'll give him competent. 
819963287827783680 2017-01-13 17:44:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> I'm shocked. This is way better than political robot empty suit he played on campaign trail.

819807745608060929 2017-01-12 07:26:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass I agree both side have corruption. I think Trump is going to be the most corrupt we've every seen.
819806937210490880 2017-01-12 07:22:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass That's great to hear. I hope you're right about Trump. Nothing has happened so far to make me comfortable.
819805813053108224 2017-01-12 07:18:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass Its not a game to POC. Trump has created a real sense of dread in a lot of communities.

819801995351498752 2017-01-12 07:03:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass Election is over. Enjoy Trump. Don't like Paul Ryan fool you. He doesn't have a different plan.
819801563841445918 2017-01-12 07:01:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass Paul Ryan is counting on you being reckless because of your grievances.

819800603522043905 2017-01-12 06:57:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass ACA is a GOP plan used for Republicans support to get healthcare reform.
819800018664112129 2017-01-12 06:55:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass There is no Majic plan. It's a bait and switch. They don't think the citizens deserve insurance. Save for congress.
819799628384063490 2017-01-12 06:53:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass I'll go slow. The laws are formed in congress. It's not exploding. It could work better if GOP would fully fund it.
819797651201789953 2017-01-12 06:46:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @pullheadfromass whatever. Anyway the sub are paid by a tax on incomes above $1mil. Ur premiums are high b/c the GOP allows ins co to gouge

819609817522311168 2017-01-12 18:19:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Most can't. Look at Ryan's plan and see if it helps citizens or is simple.
819607005161811971 2017-01-12 18:08:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Good. Watch Paul Ryan. Make sure simple works to citizens benefit.
819602178331594753 2017-01-12 17:49:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 The citizens are the US.
819600785059311616 2017-01-12 17:43:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @renaissanceeast Official estimate is 129 million. Repeal will effect more than just working poor.

819594441350639616 2017-01-12 17:18:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Ok. Pay attention to Paul Ryan. Read his budget. His plans are a threat to the middle class.
819590984937996288 2017-01-12 17:04:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul Easy to look at his plan. Just look and find the part that helps you.
819590367247003648 2017-01-12 17:02:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Agreed.  But It's necessary. Even non libitard get old and sick.
819588246812422145 2017-01-12 16:53:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Repeal without replacement is bad for market. Bad for everyone. 129 mill have pre-existing conditions
819587836064268295 2017-01-12 16:52:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul We can disagree on politics without you allowing Paul Ryan to screw middle class.
819587363529748482 2017-01-12 16:50:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Good. That's all I'm saying. We don't have to agree on policies. Just don't let Paul Ryan screw us because you don't like libs
819586850725761024 2017-01-12 16:48:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul So 30 million lose coverage and no effect economic effect?
819586373321682944 2017-01-12 16:46:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Obama is gone. You can't blame him for being reckless now. Watch what Paul Ryan is doing.
819585691793428480 2017-01-12 16:43:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @kgbveteran @Mindflayer1969 It's possible to hate liberals and not destroy your healthcare.
819585345293549572 2017-01-12 16:42:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @kgbveteran @Mindflayer1969 Using your logic the GOP shouldn't have to repeal in the middle of the night.
819584674926395393 2017-01-12 16:39:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul Which part is delusional? Please explain without the venom.
819583687402594304 2017-01-12 16:35:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul We lose 3 million jobs. Just so you can rant on Twitter? You're settling up your kids for failure.
819583404123492353 2017-01-12 16:34:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul Do you realize you pay either way? Emergency room care for uninsured fall to the tax payers. $350 bill in additional cost.
819578906634227714 2017-01-12 16:16:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 you don't have to let Paul Ryan screw you because you don't like liberals.
819578511656714241 2017-01-12 16:15:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Having healthcare doesn't prevent you from insulting strangers on twitter. You can have both.
819576037495472128 2017-01-12 16:05:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 We will pay cost for repeal up to $350 billion. So we get cost with no benefit. Not smart.
819572088377704452 2017-01-12 15:49:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @SilversmithPaul Voting against your own interests is a not a good life choice. Paul Ryan wants to kill the middle class.
819568816086777856 2017-01-12 15:36:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Even if that were true taking it away from the people it does help is not a solution.
819566408162037760 2017-01-12 15:27:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BigPapi765 Blowing up the healthcare market does nothing for middle class. Paul Ryan is the problem. Pres Obama's term is over.
819564033145733121 2017-01-12 15:17:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> repealing ACA will not solve that problem. Ask Paul Ryan to fund plan and let it work.
819560771004796928 2017-01-12 15:04:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Exactly. Enjoy Trump. Watch out for Paul Ryan.
819560522794278912 2017-01-12 15:03:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Turn down the hate. Look at what's actually happening. Paul Ryan wants to destroy the middle class.
819558844670103552 2017-01-12 14:57:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields If you have a job with group insurance how does this effect your paycheck?
819557860728311809 2017-01-12 14:53:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields I just don't understand why you have to act against your own interests to be hateful.
819557532578566144 2017-01-12 14:51:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields No. just a concerned citizen.
819557205687074816 2017-01-12 14:50:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Sounds good. But you can still insult people on Twitter without screwing your self.
819556642731782145 2017-01-12 14:48:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields The past you long for never existed. Hate will destroy both of us.
819556193333051393 2017-01-12 14:46:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Exactly. You're just confused about who is taking your shit. Paul Ryan is the problem. Not me or liberals.
819554389849423872 2017-01-12 14:39:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Screwing yourself won't fix any of that.
819554212438745088 2017-01-12 14:38:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields At the lowest wages possible. We will get more pictures like that if we go down this path.
819546279848144896 2017-01-12 14:07:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields Not screwing yourself doesnt keep you from hating liberals. You can do both.
819542036558807041 2017-01-12 13:50:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Shaggy2fields You're letting GOP pick both our pockets just so you can say silly tings on Twitter?

817509285454376961 2017-01-06 23:12:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Di_719 Completely agree. Trump is a wildcard. Putin has to know that and he's literally risking war. He would have to be an idiot also.

817500187522371584 2017-01-06 22:36:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @hoosercharles58 The only reason he's not in Trumps swamp is record breaking Medicare fraud. He's #1!
817498957156937728 2017-01-06 22:31:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Pandaphant1 Lol. I guess you don't know Rick Scott? He literally set records for GOV'T fraud.

817463165290250240 2017-01-06 20:09:40 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Gamerben111 @megreystroke So we need to improve ACA or get a better plan. right?
817462822426804229 2017-01-06 20:08:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Gamerben111 I know your excited about Trump but in the meantime Paul Ryan is picking both or pockets.
817461879459184640 2017-01-06 20:04:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Gamerben111 I have. I think a lot of people are emotionally over different political views. Clouded judgement gets  them screw themselves.
817459964109275137 2017-01-06 19:56:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Gamerben111 Let's say that's true. Can you explain how repeal corrects any of those problems.
817459491578986496 2017-01-06 19:55:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PAWarnhoff All true. Conservatives movement is con. They simply want to loot Ss.
817459014082711552 2017-01-06 19:53:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Gamerben111 Assuming your chart is correct do you think repealing ACA will fix that?

817454682155126785 2017-01-06 19:35:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PAWarnhoff Good point. How do you feel about clean air and water. Any thoughts on healthcare or SS?
817451209388937217 2017-01-06 19:22:10 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PAWarnhoff Do you have a minute to explain exactly what a conservative is?
817449336950898688 2017-01-06 19:14:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RepBarbaraLee I agree. I hope they do. We have to if they don't. It's our country and lives on the line.

815720270627532800 2017-01-01 00:44:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CowabungaG @ZariaVonMars Is being against insurance as a concept the same as being against ACA?
815717541733605377 2017-01-01 00:33:11 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars @CowabungaG if you don't want to understand how it works I respect that.  Most people need ins so I try.

815709867797348352 2017-01-01 00:02:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars @CowabungaG Blame GOP not ACA. They prevented subsidies in all states.
815709088059457537 2017-01-01 23:59:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars @CowabungaG Healthcare is too expensive. ACA helps with that.  Beef is with drug cos, hospitals and insurance cos.
815708153287495680 2017-01-01 23:55:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars @nomaddrums72 yep. And US  citizens fight it tooth and nail. GOP propaganda machine has a strong grip on US.
815706820941676544 2017-01-01 23:50:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Without ACA that premium could easily double. I think it's important to understand that. I understand the pain. I have it also
815706118261526528 2017-01-01 23:47:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Lol. Simmer down. No malice intended.
815705240540430337 2017-01-01 23:44:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Middle class gets short end for sure. Misunderstanding ACA allows for further screwing.
815704855566286848 2017-01-01 23:42:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Again. Incorrect. It effects all markets. GOP gutted funding that would reduced premiums for higher incomes.
815703071019909120 2017-01-01 23:35:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Universal healthcare is best method. Anything moving in that direction is great. Taking it away would be a mistake.
815701865371435008 2017-01-01 23:30:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars ACA doesn't dictate the costs.
815701042461409280 2017-01-01 23:27:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Yes. Yes. I'm saying the car needs gas. Taking out the engine is not the solution.
815700463412772864 2017-01-01 23:25:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Giving misleading info about plan doesn't improve it. Not understanding doesn't help you get what you want from it.
815700112697688064 2017-01-01 23:23:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Insurance markets are out of control. ACA is a compromise plan originally put forward by GOP. It needs major improvements.
815698970743816192 2017-01-01 23:19:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> The willful ignorance of the electorate make it too easy for right wing to prevail. https://twitter.com/ZariaVonMars/status/815696834484142081

815695649635180544 2017-01-01 23:06:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Do you know that how insurance works?!
815695455661281280 2017-01-01 23:05:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Again. Your concerns are with the market. Not the bill.
815695110373601280 2017-01-01 23:04:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Your econ status doesn't shield you from injury or sickness. That's a right wing ploy to get you ta act against self interest.
815694283789500417 2017-01-01 23:00:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> The ACA is a set of rules regulating healthcare markets. Private insurance cos, drug costs and hospitals drive the costs. https://twitter.com/ZariaVonMars/status/815690619565834241
815692666948243456 2017-01-01 22:54:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars I day in hospital can easily exceed $6 thousand. We have public healthcare so your tax dollars would go there either way.
815691018599276544 2017-01-01 22:47:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars I key question is how much would it be without the law? Most people just don't understand how it helps to contain your costs.
815690252853641216 2017-01-01 22:44:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars Most individual market clients get subsidies bringing cost under $100/mth.
815689737000419328 2017-01-01 22:42:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars The insurance is expensive because of the industry not the bill. Healthcare cost have come down.
815683266871169025 2017-01-01 22:17:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ZariaVonMars I'm not sure what point you're making.

764968196654837760 2016-08-14 23:33:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @dailey_dennis @unpozzed Conservative movement is root of this evil. Race baiting for votes to enact tax scams.

763418659423391744 2016-08-10 16:56:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ananavarro Sure Jeb! would have cut the estate tax and finished cleaning up the Middle East. Just what we need right now.

761673021237133312 2016-08-05 21:19:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @brianefallon this election has exposed a lot of things. Cable news is 60-80% garbage. Non scientific estimate.

761659725222178816 2016-08-05 20:26:44 UTC <EaleyGregory> @fmanjoo maybe because Trump is an active shooter scene. You want us to be concerned about traffic tickets?
761658922197483520 2016-08-05 20:23:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmhpro @ron_fournier @MerrittJennifer Ron is one of the original framer of the liar theme. Goes back decades. He's just lazy. Go to theme.

761655918614446080 2016-08-05 20:11:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HillaryClinton @ron_fournier @jmhpro Ron is one of the main propaganda peddlers. Has been for decades. Wasting your breath.

761640149251977216 2016-08-05 19:08:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @KingEric55 There are a lot of "conservatives" hiding behind legitimate news organizations. Conservative movement needs to be exposed.

761291924921683969 2016-08-04 20:05:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR Wow. That would piss me off. Did someone actually call you a rascist?

761288282147725312 2016-08-04 19:50:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EWErickson @MikeMayZ I don't understand. If the polls move after an event, that means their not real? What does it have to do with sheep?

761285214412808192 2016-08-04 19:38:33 UTC <EaleyGregory> @any @JennyL2KelLAR no one likes abortion. It's a very difficult thing.
761284500496064512 2016-08-04 19:35:43 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR K-12 Needs more money. US colleges are great. It won't increase middle class taxes. We have the money. problem is political.

761280293894434816 2016-08-04 19:19:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR nothing is free. It's tax allocation. Both sides like free trade. Nobody 'likes' abortions.
761279449836818432 2016-08-04 19:15:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR there is a video of a liiberal black guy and a right wing radio host. Everyone should see it. Would you mind watching?

761273005410357248 2016-08-04 18:50:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR Paul Ryan GOP budget not good unless you're very wealthy.
761272490005975040 2016-08-04 18:48:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR The real divide is economic. We need to functioning party for our form of govt. GOP has become extreme. Sorry but true.
761271864257753088 2016-08-04 18:45:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR YES!!
761271344558256130 2016-08-04 18:43:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian was actually trying not to have policy debate. We're citizens first. Trump is dangerously unstable. Party of no concern
761270720370319360 2016-08-04 18:40:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR BLM is just trying to raise awareness of a very real problem. Know one outside of Fox News thinks that their violent
761268937556242432 2016-08-04 18:33:53 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR lol. I inow
761268781314301956 2016-08-04 18:33:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian not really. Nuke deal is working. It's there money. No war. Not good reason to give unhinged nuke codes
761268349246451712 2016-08-04 18:31:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR its the same. Awareness is better. Might be a little uncomfortable but we have to address it
761267941950099457 2016-08-04 18:29:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EWErickson so there's a polling cartel?
761266713820139520 2016-08-04 18:25:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR again I hope I don't sound resentful. Acknowledging the problem is first step in solving it.
761266021361561600 2016-08-04 18:22:17 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian its not a game. Nuclear weapons can kill all of us. Citizens before party.
761265352676249600 2016-08-04 18:19:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR Let me apologize if that how you feel. No one is saying that. But I don't have the luxury of pretending rascism is not real
761264339156279297 2016-08-04 18:15:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian I'm not really in a position to forgive the rascism. But that aside I'm a citizen first. Unstable=no nuke codes.
761263465847672832 2016-08-04 18:12:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR possible that POC have had a different experience than you? We have to listen to each other. You're mad at me. Ryan takes SS
761262538709278720 2016-08-04 18:08:27 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian So it's Ok to give nuke codes to an unstable person because you don't like Hillary. Smart
761262032624635905 2016-08-04 18:06:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR Great talking points. Absolutely no substance. That's the conservative movement. Tax and privledge scam. Look up Ryan budget
761261264920190976 2016-08-04 18:03:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @hughhewitt @YoungContrarian well, you could consider putting country above party. Just an option.
761260719652208640 2016-08-04 18:01:13 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR look up Ryan's plans. POUTS want to expand SS. How is POUTUS race-baiting?
761259889276571649 2016-08-04 17:57:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @YoungContrarian I'm not sure where ur going with this. I was pointing out how hypocritical @hughhewitt is. When did he cure the cancer?
761259007122079744 2016-08-04 17:54:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BradThor @JennyL2KelLAR you list yourself as a conservative. Trump is race bating for political gain.
761258531626496000 2016-08-04 17:52:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JennyL2KelLAR Pau Ryan want to take away your social security. Are you Ok with that?

761256222695710720 2016-08-04 17:43:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BradThor @JennyL2KelLAR Not Republicans. The 'conservative movement' that took it over. It's a tax and privilege scam.

758852940601827328 2016-07-28 02:33:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @seanspicer @HillaryClinton @DemConvention I recommend Sun Tzu and single malt.  Time to regroup guys. The 4 yrs will fly bye.
758849575557795841 2016-07-28 02:20:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp where the personal responsibility? You nominate a fascist. Not Dem. See you in 4 buddy.
758847689932943360 2016-07-28 02:12:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ron_fournier @tracym so... the personal responsibility exemption applies here also?

758744416907440128 2016-07-28 19:22:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmartNYT @EWErickson I'm guessing he doesn't realize that kind of rhetoric has led us to the brink of Fuhrer Trump.
758741950543507457 2016-07-28 19:12:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @EWErickson Is that a joke? It's dark man.
758738809097822208 2016-07-28 19:00:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoeNBC How can we get ur buddies to vote for Hillary before we end up with a Trump crisis?
758738240517971969 2016-07-28 18:57:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoeNBC welcome abroad the reality train.

758721164873269248 2016-07-28 17:49:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ron_fournier uh...it that the same thing? Or are you making a different point?
758719751656992768 2016-07-28 17:44:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @marcorubio @MattPalumbo12 @PatriciaMazzei Dad why did you give nuke codes to a madman?---I'm a conservative son.
758719187527340032 2016-07-28 17:42:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @marcorubio @MattPalumbo12 @PatriciaMazzei How about a citizen? Cuban are fond of strongman types, right? Or unhinged = nuke codes.

758716854105964544 2016-07-28 17:32:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jonlovett @newtgingrich lol. Have you heard Rush Limbaugh or Herman Cain on radio. They don't even try to make sense. It's fascinating 
758713331838509056 2016-07-28 17:18:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive I don't watch CNN. And actually agree with most of your concerns. I'm making a citizen argument for safety
758712230263263232 2016-07-28 17:14:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive is it game? Best I have. Hope you consider before voting. God speed
758710680115613696 2016-07-28 17:08:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive I gave nuke codes to an unstable person because I don't like Hillary's policies. Kids would be proud, right?
758709517102288896 2016-07-28 17:03:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive are safety is not a partisan issue for me or the people I care about.
758709127602470913 2016-07-28 17:02:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive no drama, we have different political views. That's good for country. However, Unhinged = no nuke code.
758703364389662720 2016-07-28 16:39:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive we are citizens first right? The guy is not even conservative. Unhinged can't get codes. SMH
758702796334067712 2016-07-28 16:36:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ChrisCuomo @grnmedina_chris not bias. More like malpractice. Why do you have to 'balance' a demagogue with  standard American politician?
758699525666140160 2016-07-28 16:23:57 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @MarDimfive is that what you can say to kids to justify giving Nuke codes to a clearly unstable person?

758682439975927809 2016-07-28 15:16:03 UTC <EaleyGregory> @BruceBartlett and Paul Ryan is willing to give nuke codes to an unhinged proto-fascist so we can enjoy these results nationally.

758646901059252224 2016-07-28 12:54:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @RBReich @VanJones68 can we start to have a real accounting of Hillary's career. Not the right wing controlled narrative.

758643528658513920 2016-07-28 12:41:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @chrislhayes We need to break the right wing defined view of Hillary
758643103154728960 2016-07-28 12:39:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JoyAnnReid We need more positive Hillary stories. The right wing defined here wile the media piled on.
758641989118205952 2016-07-28 12:35:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @howardfineman we need to have more positive Hillary stories. The media has let the right right define her unfairly.

758506063675138048 2016-07-27 03:35:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp goodnight Matt. Great chatting today
758470999260143616 2016-07-27 01:15:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jaybookmanajc I'm hopefully. Trump is frightening.
758466791966400512 2016-07-27 00:59:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jelani9 I'm not sure. How does that explain Manafort?
758466205804027905 2016-07-27 00:56:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jaybookmanajc pull the tape from Fox on any police shooting in either direction. It's appalling. Lead with Furhman and gets ugly.
758465346835800064 2016-07-27 00:53:24 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jaybookmanajc this is nothing new. Fiox has been horrendous for years. Trump is making overt racism an issue again.
758459963207548928 2016-07-27 00:32:01 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmp9999jmp I would hope would could agree on unstable person having nuclear codes. Our politics are different. That's ok
758459410255601664 2016-07-27 00:29:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmp9999jmp very concerned about Isis. Don't think we should give nuclear codes to unstable person.
758458664474804224 2016-07-27 00:26:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmp9999jmp I'm worried about unstable guy having control of nukes. I can only vote.
758455431681368064 2016-07-27 00:14:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmp9999jmp I'm guessing you don't have kids. Still country should come before party.
758454794138767360 2016-07-27 00:11:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp a little humor. Civil always. Really good chat tho
758453609201799169 2016-07-27 00:06:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp "I'm sorry son. I didn't think he could figure out how fire a nuke. I hope you forgive me."--- sounds good
758451116426334209 2016-07-27 23:56:52 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jmp9999jmp same to you
758446030635593728 2016-07-27 23:36:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp we have to be civil. Good luck
758443697377804288 2016-07-27 23:27:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp if ur comfortable with clearly unstable guy having nuke code because of Hillary. I can only pray for us.
758442222824095744 2016-07-27 23:21:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp our politics are different. That should be OK. As citizens unstable and nuclear codes don't go together
758441933538746368 2016-07-27 23:20:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp ok. Your going to tell ur kids we gave nuclear codes to a unstable person because Hillary etc.
758441178652172288 2016-07-27 23:17:22 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp is this a reason to give unstable person nuke codes?
758434145982873600 2016-07-27 22:49:26 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @seadawg14 not making lib/cons play  We can have different views.  unstable person shouldn't get nuke code
758431765518221312 2016-07-27 22:39:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @seadawg14 as a citizen we can disagree on court issues. Can't tell kids SCOTUS if we end of in nuke war
758431223354122240 2016-07-27 22:37:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @seadawg14 Lol. Trump is not gonna be restrain by the courts
758430861683466240 2016-07-27 22:36:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jbouie @Redistrict Wake u press. Strongman dominates new cycle. Us versus them play. Simple bet he can get them out
758429598736613376 2016-07-27 22:31:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @byronNME @WPJ4 Trump can say anything he wants. Anything. Making us versus them argument. If media doesn't wise up where doomed.
758423930281549826 2016-07-27 22:08:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ over/under 21 days
758421610441433091 2016-07-27 21:59:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @stephenfhayes @jkirchick ok thank. That sound like a good reason to give nuclear codes to a unstable guy. The kids will understand
758416455008477184 2016-07-27 21:39:08 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Dan2582Ortiz he's exposing a lot. The entrainment new style can't compete. Simply not equipped.
758413411025874944 2016-07-27 21:27:02 UTC <EaleyGregory> @andersoncooper nothing and I mean nothing he has said can pass thru a logic prism.
758413219316793344 2016-07-27 21:26:16 UTC <EaleyGregory> @andersoncooper he's with us against them. He will lead us. Very simple
758412938768183296 2016-07-27 21:25:09 UTC <EaleyGregory> @andersoncooper He's following fascist script. Simple us versus them. Fear and loathing will get them to the polls. It's working.
758412337120411648 2016-07-27 21:22:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @andersoncooper Listen please: Trump can say anything he wants. Anything. It's an emotional appeal. Can't keep up balanced debate.
758408832582311936 2016-07-27 21:08:50 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @sanuzis No doubt. I've seen you too.  Nice guy.  Different views. That's ok. We need that. This guy is a threat. I'm  a citizen
758407504711782400 2016-07-27 21:03:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Bakari_Sellers @High_n_Right yep. Thanks
758407024593997824 2016-07-27 21:01:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @sanuzis I wish we didn't have such problematic options But we do. One can't be trusted with nuke code.  Cho cho would appreciate
758406169299910656 2016-07-27 20:58:15 UTC <EaleyGregory> @sanuzis @mschlapp @seadawg14 OK. Come back in 4yr with a candidate that won't put our lives at risk
758405574153367552 2016-07-27 20:55:54 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @sanuzis is your youngest going to OK dad that make sense. That explains why Trump is starting a nuclear war.
758404921632890880 2016-07-27 20:53:18 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @sanuzis Fine. Not good enough to turn country over to fascist.
758404333159473156 2016-07-27 20:50:58 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CNN @Bakari_Sellers @High_n_Right explain?
758403864668336128 2016-07-27 20:49:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @ezraklein @JohnJHarwood It's not crazy. Trump appeal is emotional. If we can't get the media to realize that we going to lose to a fascist
758402525754167297 2016-07-27 20:43:47 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @sanuzis Matt stop it. Come back in 4 yr  You can't tell ur kids u voted for Trump because Hillary wasn't tech savvy.
758400949027270660 2016-07-27 20:37:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @Bakari_Sellers @High_n_Right @CNN  their not dumb. It's an emotional appeal. We have to understand that.
758399696234745856 2016-07-27 20:32:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WPJ4 The hair is natural. Women love it. 
758399078015307776 2016-07-27 20:30:05 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WPJ4 Next one may have even nicer hair and not be unhinged. We gotta start now.
758398634740285440 2016-07-27 20:28:19 UTC <EaleyGregory> @HillaryClinton @WPJ4 very true but logical. We have to over come emotion. I don't concede 40% to Trump. No good even if Trump loses
758397688811548672 2016-07-27 20:24:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WPJ4 appeal as citizen. Find common ground. Trump is dangerous. What about kids?
758397163856662530 2016-07-27 20:22:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> @WPJ4 can't give up on them.  make emotional vs logical appeal. We have to starting listening. We can't surrender 40% to fascist 
758394875461206016 2016-07-27 20:13:23 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp clarify?
758391841976938496 2016-07-27 20:01:20 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @jmp9999jmp speaking as a citizen not as a Dem. We can't lose sight of that
758391283576635392 2016-07-27 19:59:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 very similar except that we need to functioning parties for our system of govt. Radicals high jacked one.
758389653372272640 2016-07-27 19:52:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 which is why it's effective. Human frailty. If you can't do anything about its easier to ignore.it. Coping mechanism
758388261463220225 2016-07-27 19:47:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 You no longer even have to have any animus really. It's just business.
758387682779209728 2016-07-27 19:44:48 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 yep and Koch bro has poured so much money into movement you can make handsome living being right wing talking head
758386437167407104 2016-07-27 19:39:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 also the emery is us. Fox News hugely profitable. CNN is clearly moving to similar model. Rush has 50 m tuned in.
758384621121892352 2016-07-27 19:32:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 in all seriousness. We have areal problem. Entertainment obsessed media is not equipped for this fascist threat.
758383831066021888 2016-07-27 19:29:30 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 He's in his 70's and his real hair is getting longer and shiner. What not to like.
758382638105329664 2016-07-27 19:24:45 UTC <EaleyGregory> @danieljwindham @WPJ4 it's an emotional appeal. Logic no use. Simple us versus them. Trump is Rush Limbaugh with nicer hair.
758381189963087872 2016-07-27 19:19:00 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joshtpm @Dan2582Ortiz Trump is Rush Limbaugh with nicer hair do
758380649753481216 2016-07-27 19:16:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joshtpm @Dan2582Ortiz AM Radio and Fox New has large part of country locked into a separate world view
758367984893165568 2016-07-27 18:26:32 UTC <EaleyGregory> @KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump is hacking legal now?
758364031631622150 2016-07-27 18:10:49 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JeffreyGoldberg After press conference CNN ranted for 10 minutes. Then went to break. New topic. WTH
758359061557571584 2016-07-27 17:51:04 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp if Party over country is your official position? How do we go forward?
758353889112580096 2016-07-27 17:30:31 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp if your not at least paid to be that partisan we have little hope.
758349569214275584 2016-07-27 17:13:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp really Matt.  Does contract allow you to speak freely in matter of National security?
758348393718673408 2016-07-27 17:08:41 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JeffreyGoldberg I'm officially afraid
758338386927190016 2016-07-27 16:28:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @JeffreyGoldberg @PriceSjrw5614 I know. This is insane. What does he have to do or say for media to acknowledge he's unstable.
758333676279259136 2016-07-27 16:10:12 UTC <EaleyGregory> @davidfrum @AriFleischer Dem or Rep are we not in agreement on sanity before nuke codes. WTH
758330530580561924 2016-07-27 15:57:42 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp We agree on so much more than we are willing to admit. We all have to do better.
758329502611177473 2016-07-27 15:53:37 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp I appreciate  urservice to country. Our politics are different. Dem or Rep I want basic sanity before nuke codes.
758328070176698369 2016-07-27 15:47:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AprilDRyan @kalebsands @mschlapp we can disagree on our politics. I would hope not on our safety.
758327244649529345 2016-07-27 15:44:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @AprilDRyan we have to talk to each other. Thank you

758324962298097668 2016-07-27 15:35:34 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mschlapp @AprilDRyan whatever your politics we have to agree...we can't entrust nuclear codes to an unstable person. Cmon man
758324005510213633 2016-07-27 15:31:46 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AprilDRyan @mschlapp Last week?! He's melting down at his press conference as we speak.

758293858937634816 2016-07-27 13:31:59 UTC <EaleyGregory> @CapehartJ Relax. They just need time to adjust. Trump will do enough to make danger clear before election.

757304685204234240 2016-07-24 20:01:21 UTC <EaleyGregory> @davidfrum Trump will now get top secret briefings. Sad
757298111094132736 2016-07-24 19:35:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @TulsiGabbard @ananavarro Anna come on over.  The Republican Party that you loved is no more.  We could use your smarts and insight.
757281059407065088 2016-07-24 18:27:28 UTC <EaleyGregory> Republicans are putting their party over our country. Shame on them. Watch @dccc's new ad:  http://dccc.org/sidekicks

757270601757237248 2016-07-24 17:45:55 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AprilDRyan lol. Thanks for not throwing your shoe at Steve King on national tv. Your glare however was priceless.
757268634863534080 2016-07-24 17:38:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @AprilDRyan @JoyAnnReid Joy we are depending on you.  Great show today.
757260034967478302 2016-07-24 17:03:56 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala @mwolf1124 Thanks for pointing that out.
757258664067657729 2016-07-24 16:58:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala just to be clear. Love you man.
757258254686748672 2016-07-24 16:56:51 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala @mwolf1124 Tough to be clear in 140c. I love Paul and Carville. Always slice thru the foolishness. Refreshing.
757256927902572544 2016-07-24 16:51:35 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala @mwolf1124 sorry not about Paul. Saying that we should be concerned that a large part of our country is open to a dark vision
757255688422821896 2016-07-24 16:46:39 UTC <EaleyGregory> @woodruffbets  stop it
757254917828579328 2016-07-24 16:43:36 UTC <EaleyGregory> @jaketapper Jake it's wrong.  But with all the news of the week... This is the lead story. Fascist assault on democracy needs more attention
757250651248271360 2016-07-24 16:26:38 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala believe me. you usually relieve my concerns amongst the madness. But we shouldn't surrender the disaffected to this fascist
757247069702787077 2016-07-24 16:12:25 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala maybe not so smug. We have very real concerns if a significant portion of the voting public is ok with that dark vision.
757243752461307904 2016-07-24 15:59:14 UTC <EaleyGregory> @joanwalsh I it's wrong and needs to be addressed.  But is it a scandal? fascist making inroads into our democracy. That's a scandal.
757237274602078208 2016-07-24 15:33:29 UTC <EaleyGregory> @PaulBegala unfair...kids generally not that obnoxious until 7-8th grade.
757235665679638528 2016-07-24 15:27:06 UTC <EaleyGregory> @mtaibbi fair point. However, so of us may be losing perspective as a fascist make a play for our democracy.
