971771185540288512 2018-03-08 15:34:39 UTC <UrbDAA> @EricDirnbach Ill keep coming back to it, they should be called Labor-Freeloading laws. Agreeing to call them right to Work laws already puts us on the back foot.
970408482913640448 2018-03-04 21:19:46 UTC <UrbDAA> Congrats @RamblersMBB. How cool would a November or December weekend at the @UnitedCenter be for a city tourney with Loyola, @DePaulHoops, @UICFlamesMBB and @NUMensBball ??

968678188850302976 2018-02-27 02:44:12 UTC <UrbDAA> @RightToWork @Columbia @EricDirnbach There has to be a better phrase than right to work, labor free-loading? Or something to describe it means no dues but people get to work under the labor agreement...if the union survives without dues.
968614012681424896 2018-02-27 22:29:11 UTC <UrbDAA> @EricDirnbach hi! When the public sector employees in Wisconsin struck and protested at the capital, people across the country could send pizzas from a local place. Any small gesture you heard of to support @AFTWV ?
967073193088503808 2018-02-23 16:26:31 UTC <UrbDAA> Any politician proposing a regulation that improves access to firearms should answer, how does this help to form a well regulated Militia?

848949139438219264 2017-04-03 17:23:42 UTC <UrbDAA> Is it wrong to cheer against the braves because they moved out of the urban proper? (Along with a truly hideous stadium deal)
