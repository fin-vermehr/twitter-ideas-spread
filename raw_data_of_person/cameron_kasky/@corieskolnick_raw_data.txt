969290619280506880 2018-03-01 19:17:46 UTC <corieskolnick> @wokeluisa The NRA will take her in a shot.
969287348520345600 2018-03-01 19:04:47 UTC <corieskolnick> @MrFilmkritik In 1972 social psychologists Berscheid and Walster described this phenomenon as "what's beautiful is good". It's a powerful stereotype that overrides even all provable evidence to the contrary. Thus beautiful scum often gets a free pass.

966540616132775936 2018-02-21 05:10:14 UTC <corieskolnick> The suggestion that teachers be armed and that the arming of teachers become mandatory has zero to do with school safety. It's about $$$$$$ and only about money. The bean counters in the gun industry lobby are already calculating how many schools and guns per school will net.

958772266036162560 2018-01-31 18:41:36 UTC <corieskolnick> @zachbraff A photo or it didn't happen.
958771730285150208 2018-01-31 18:39:28 UTC <corieskolnick> @TomiLahren @votevets Thank you for your tireless efforts to inform. Some bigotry dies a hard death. Somebody hurt that poor girl and now she's put it on display. So sad.
958579657984659456 2018-01-30 05:56:14 UTC <corieskolnick> We need a Diane @SenFeinstein moment now.https://twitter.com/OfficialJonZal/status/958355725515882496
958575229554581505 2018-01-30 05:38:38 UTC <corieskolnick> You can tell by the sweat they break which of these guys have been paid a visit by the Pollonium boys...Nunes, Gowdy, Ryan, and now Graham and a few others.https://twitter.com/GORDORICH/status/958567578682699776
958527005569400832 2018-01-30 02:27:01 UTC <corieskolnick> @realDonaldTrump @brezzo @elk_l That will get outsourced to the boys.

958461245413236736 2018-01-30 22:05:42 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenSanders Business types are always a little slow at grasping the long game in pursuit of the closest nickel.
958438817513402368 2018-01-30 20:36:35 UTC <corieskolnick> @GovHowardDean Maybe why 30+ Rs have "retired" this year?
958408023562600448 2018-01-30 18:34:13 UTC <corieskolnick> Is Senator Diane @SenFeinstein Feinstein the only one up there who knows how to defy a R led committee and release shit to the public?
958407032524042240 2018-01-30 18:30:17 UTC <corieskolnick> @coldfootfilms The only reason I'm tempted to watch is so I don't miss this fantasy become reality. Imagine the FOMO!

943740127603343360 2017-12-20 07:09:14 UTC <corieskolnick> @shannonrwatts @NicolleDWallace Does mother mind his "public displays of fellatio"?
943686919929585664 2017-12-20 03:37:49 UTC <corieskolnick> @JohnWDean Nunes is filthy. Rubles in his Swiss accounts.
943681105181343749 2017-12-20 03:14:42 UTC <corieskolnick> @StephMillerShow @robreiner Yep. In '98 they impeached a pres for a bj. Today they stood in line to blow Trump in front of cameras.
943673154320326657 2017-12-20 02:43:07 UTC <corieskolnick> @JoyAnnReid And lots of "invites" on FB.

943659856900141056 2017-12-20 01:50:16 UTC <corieskolnick> @SpeakerRyan Why not just make a mandatory living wage the law and skip the middle men?
943659532592365568 2017-12-20 01:48:59 UTC <corieskolnick> @stevesilberman Yep.https://twitter.com/corieskolnick/status/943654124364619777
943654124364619777 2017-12-20 01:27:30 UTC <corieskolnick> 1998: the entire Rep party loses its shit over one blow job. 2017: the entire Rep party blows the president on camera. @DavidCornDC
943642160053628928 2017-12-20 00:39:57 UTC <corieskolnick> @HillaryClinton @NickMerrill I bought two in the midtown B&N. Gave one to my niece and started the other one on the plane home. I couldn't finish it, I got so upset. We got robbed. #ImStillWithHer
943636823217025024 2017-12-20 00:18:45 UTC <corieskolnick> @ProudResister Happy holidays right back at your two!
943572565439660032 2017-12-20 20:03:24 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenatorCollins @johnpavlovitz She knew because I told her on here several times and so did everyone I know.

943571066810593280 2017-12-20 19:57:27 UTC <corieskolnick> @ReneDenfeld Really happy about this one good thing today.
943568429453230081 2017-12-20 19:46:58 UTC <corieskolnick> @Amy_Siskind The year is 2169 and Roy Moore has still not conceded. (Just a hunch based on the fact that he's not yet conceded the results of the Civil War.)
943565757346070528 2017-12-20 19:36:21 UTC <corieskolnick> @JoyceCarolOates Oh, that shirt. And they say irony is dead.
943564372227616768 2017-12-20 19:30:51 UTC <corieskolnick> @Amy_Siskind Evil, Wrong, and Emblematic.

943223047003168768 2017-12-19 20:54:33 UTC <corieskolnick> Sure, Paul. Next year when you retire and take that well paying lobby position for Big Ag you'll save a bundle. No wonder you look so happy.https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/943202290856538122

942978134525300736 2017-12-18 04:41:21 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenBobCorker What will you do with your $1.9 mil? More REAL Estate investment?
942977599847796736 2017-12-18 04:39:14 UTC <corieskolnick> @LouDobbs @MollyJongFast I snotted.
942977517291429888 2017-12-18 04:38:54 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenBobCorker I'm disgusted by you.
942977333664800768 2017-12-18 04:38:10 UTC <corieskolnick> @POTUS @PressSec @tedlieu Well no, Sarah. Every analysis explains this "cut" as bogus as the increases to this family's actual expenses caused by this bill will not "save" them one cent, will in fact cost them thousands. But, you go on...
942976939110776832 2017-12-18 04:36:36 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenatorCollins No. Sorry. Somebody wrote that for you. It's trite and canned and not worthy of you. So sad that you have completely abandoned your constituency.
942927477269176320 2017-12-18 01:20:03 UTC <corieskolnick> @EJDionne If someone as low on the pole as Bob #CorkerKickbacks Corker is making out like this, imagine the payoffs up the chain. Lordy.
942923114475806721 2017-12-18 01:02:43 UTC <corieskolnick> @ClintSmithIII And, students, never underestimate how grand it is to hear this from an old student.
942917231100305408 2017-12-18 00:39:21 UTC <corieskolnick> @sahilkapur Prepare for her announcement to retire. #SelloutSusan won't be able to win another election in her state.

942881979569020929 2017-12-18 22:19:16 UTC <corieskolnick> At the core of every single Trump supporter I have ever met is an unstable identity cloaked in a patina of insecurity and wearing a mask of righteous grandiosity. #Resist

938487243768860672 2017-12-06 19:16:09 UTC <corieskolnick> I agree with the @SenateDems @SenatorFranken should leave the Senate. He should immediately replace @realDonaldTrump in the #WhiteHouse as President.

936763321268572160 2017-12-01 01:05:54 UTC <corieskolnick> @SDIndivisible @SenFeinstein Thank you but your colleagues across the aisle seem hell bent on the destruction of our country.
936762874302676994 2017-12-01 01:04:08 UTC <corieskolnick> @kathieallenmd @ASlavitt I once thought @SenatorCollins  was compassionate and intelligent. If she believes this pair will protect Medicare, she is neither.
936704751734898688 2017-12-01 21:13:10 UTC <corieskolnick> Paul Ryan is a lying, conniving traitor. That's the nicest thing I can say about him.https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/933116636390928385
936702937677537281 2017-12-01 21:05:58 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenateMajLdr You are absolutely wrong and there is not ONE credible non-partisan source that agrees with you. Trickle down is a myth. Raise the wages. Build the infrastructure.
936696730405371904 2017-12-01 20:41:18 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenFeinstein Please reach across the aisle and tell this to @SenatorCollins who used to possess some ethics but sadly now supports this "atrocious" tax scam.
936684508262293505 2017-12-01 19:52:44 UTC <corieskolnick> @mattmfm @SenatorCollins Please listen to this. Trickle down doesn't work. It never has and it won't this time.
936684290967875584 2017-12-01 19:51:52 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenatorCollins Pay attention to @SenJeffMerkley. This is the right direction for the middle class. Your amendments are throwing bones at the middle class.
936683990366294016 2017-12-01 19:50:40 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenatorCollins Not good enough. Please don't vote on this bill without a trigger to protect the country from another massive deficit.
936667124851924992 2017-12-01 18:43:39 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenatorCollins Sorry Senator but this is a bone. Please reconsider your support of this disastrous bill. I cannot find a single non-partisan source that thinks this tax "reform" is anything but a monstrous give-away to the wealthy. We trusted you.
936420274764840961 2017-11-30 02:22:46 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenateGOP Why did you reject the amendment requiring corporations to use their tax savings to increase employee pay at the same rate of Exec. compensation, stock buybacks and dividends?
936419585674190848 2017-11-30 02:20:01 UTC <corieskolnick> @SenFeinstein Thank you!

936407982392225793 2017-11-30 01:33:55 UTC <corieskolnick> @lisamurkowski Trickle down doesn't work. Never has. Never will. Jobs and economic growth ONLY ever come when there is more demand. Giving the rich more will result in stagnation.
