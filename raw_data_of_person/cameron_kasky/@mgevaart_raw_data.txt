972254518300889094 2018-03-09 23:35:15 UTC <mgevaart> @braun4indiana Hey Mike, hard to understand how a life long conservative can back the GOP headmaster Trump. You voted for him and you will blindly follow him when the Koch $ lands, if you win the primary, youll be their lap dog. You are no different- rookie. Just another #GOPTool
972252012514627586 2018-03-09 23:25:18 UTC <mgevaart> @realDonaldTrump @RepLukeMesser You missed the news. When last President tried to talk with DPRK - nukes could not to be talked about. What will be different now? Nothing. Your blind support of Trump is crazy. What about faith and family? Party is 1st no matter how embarrassing Is what we see. #GOPTool
972184789418725377 2018-03-09 18:58:10 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, as a Constituent I have seen you led around by the GOP party. At the State & now on a national stage. Appearing on any FOX show is fake. Go to a real news outlet, a network not built since Regan killed the fairness doctrine. Trump is not a leader, but U defend him. #GOPTool

What of the Russian sanctions you voted yes on? Your GOP headmaster in the WH is walking all over it, like you never passed that legislation. Well?

970331800219373569 2018-03-04 16:15:03 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks What is the GOP plan to help our low wage workers? There are many in your district that are trapped and need a hand up. The 2017 - Raise the wage act is good legislation waiting for you to support it. The GOP wants no part of real solutions for those people. GOP Tool.
969318171655245828 2018-03-01 21:07:15 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks You Tweet about it, yet you are silent, show us the letter you write to Trump. Call him out, you will not. You are part of the GOP Get Along Gang pretending to care for workers. You passed RTW back home in INDIANA you do not support working Hoosiers. Tough talk U GOP Tool.
969282400726503425 2018-03-01 18:45:07 UTC <mgevaart> The average tax cut a minimum-wage earner can expect to receive from the Tax Cuts &Jobs Act is based on Tax Policy Center analysis for households with income between $10,000 and $20,000 per year, which will see an average tax reduction of $50 in 2018. @RepJimBanks @SenToddYoung

You waste time to gloat about legislation that needs a few years to prove its worth, Yeah not a good look on you. Work on your serving the people of the district skills that is what we need in the IN3rd. GOP Tool.
967116511088390144 2018-02-23 19:18:39 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Congressman, you have seen the proposed budget and the cuts to NASA budget. Why?! I understand David being picked but Fred! What are his qualifications? Oh yes, he donated to Pence and supports him endlessly. A total hack appointment and you guys all know it -wink wink.
966778223601307650 2018-02-22 20:54:25 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks What Union represents the hourly employees Jim? Here or in Ohio? Oh thats right, you support RTW. You hate Unions. You never visit a workplace that the employees have the guarantees of a collective bargaining agreement. Sad!
966059375336058881 2018-02-20 21:17:58 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, You and the GOP headmaster at WH are in control. Where you failed was not getting on the Russian money train like the top GOPs did. You hitched your wagon to David Longs Koch Brothers love in. Low payout. SAD! Do you think this tweet shows us how tough you are on Russia?

What are you going to do? Jim, stand up & speak out. Tell the WH and the GOP Headmaster to....Oh thats right, your a GOP tool, part of the get along gang. Talk is cheap
963753424411070470 2018-02-14 12:34:56 UTC <mgevaart> @SenToddYoung Congress & House overwhelmingly passed strong sanctions against Russia-Trump signed it. Trump refused to implement them - saying no longer necessary. Based on Trump national security team report on 2/13/18 sanctions are more necessary than ever.     Why R U Silent?
963752712922959872 2018-02-14 12:32:07 UTC <mgevaart> Hey Mr. Young & Mr. Banks. When will you stop defending this man? We are told you are good men.

961640086998781952 2018-02-08 16:37:17 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Nice to hear there is growth in Portland IN. Do you know what the average worker there makes an hour? Of course you dont. Be a hero Jim, intro legislation to raise the minimum wage to 15$, that will help elevate their wages. Then the community will benefit, bigly.
961264967650603012 2018-02-07 15:46:42 UTC <mgevaart> @ChipotleTweets @RepJimBanks Jim, this too is a phony front.

Get the food chains to pay a living wage! #Raisetheminimumwage
961213957787803648 2018-02-07 12:24:00 UTC <mgevaart> Hey Mr. Banks & Mr. Young, this is a writer you should be familiar with. A man of integrity and faith.

961047128767418368 2018-02-06 01:21:05 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, start by telling your GOP headmaster in the WH, not to tell us he wants a shutdown. That is not working, that is a cry-baby. You wanted to go to DC, now do your job and get a bipartisan deal done. Not pointing fingers of blame, try actually working at it.
960988516929998854 2018-02-06 21:28:11 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks A part of this long career is his health. He has enjoyed consistent HC coverage & wage throughout his 50 yr career. Due to the fact that he was an APWU Union member who had the support and guarantees of a union contract. In spite of Congressman who try to strip that right.

959125225270104065 2018-02-01 18:04:08 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks So when Constituents drop you hints on Twitter, that does not work. We send your surveys and in the comments tell you to address the issue, nope not working. Then- Banks says Jennifers story inspired him to cosponsor the Homeless Veteran Families Act.
958740065835978752 2018-01-31 16:33:38 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Wait, did you just Tweet the darkness of communism? Yes you did.

958650845482160128 2018-01-31 10:39:07 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Work with my colleagues is GOP talk for only the people  who share our view. You come from the David Long/Bosma school of watch us rule. The GOP, still choosing to only help a small portion of constituents, those who pay to play. Help the rich folks Jim. You are a GOP Tool!
958470790600642560 2018-01-30 22:43:38 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @AngryLib1776 YES! Thank you for your comments. Youre a Vet Jim, we had to tweet this idea to you & you hear it at a town hall. Come on, what have you been doing in DC? You are a total GOP Tool. Your constituents know you only work for a select handful, the rest do not matter to you.
958383451929014273 2018-01-30 16:56:35 UTC <mgevaart> @nikkihaley @RepJimBanks @SpeakerRyan so will Niki and Paul and Jim be speaking about the Russian Government and their treatment of their own citizens? We passed the Sanctions? When are they enforced? Oh thats right you all share the same bed. The American Republican party is very disappointing. Sad!

Not due to the #goptaxscam - get to work on long term Infrastructure for the country. Stop focusing on building bombs and tanks, take care of the Veterans with more than talk. Raise the Minimum Wage! U GOP Tools!
956979005651062784 2018-01-26 19:55:49 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks You can do something too Congressman. Start by helping the working poor in your district. Raise the Minimum Wage! You never meet those Constituents, but they need you. Do something to help long term, not more theatrical charts, showing growth that was happening in spite of you.
956973500698431490 2018-01-26 19:33:56 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Always good to visit the companies and constituents in a controlled setting, that way no one tells you BS and calls you out for your consistent misrepresentation of fact. I am guessing they are a donor too.

956576825400070145 2018-01-25 17:17:42 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Are you aware of what a Starbucks Barista makes? Many of them are barley making ends meet. Many do not even get full time status, so it is one of several jobs they do. Good job putting out the propaganda, Speaker Ryan loves that. GOP Tool.

956226949285806080 2018-01-24 18:07:25 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, when you actually hold a meeting that working Hoosiers can attend, you may be representing us. Announced this week, 3 one hour meetings, two of them during working hours. That is the Paul Ryan playbook. You do not have an original idea. You are a GOP Tool and you like it!
956002075166601217 2018-01-23 03:13:51 UTC <mgevaart> This is how the Indiana GOP  & @RepJimBanks take care of Constituents. (Same as @VP did it) Announce 3, one hour town halls, over 3 days, the day before they start.   YOU TOOL !#TrumpShutdown #GOP @realDonaldTrump @SenToddYoung @https://banks.house.gov/media/press-releases/banks-announces-town-hall-meetings-week-pending-government-reopening
955982008248922122 2018-01-23 01:54:06 UTC <mgevaart> @WOWOpatmiller @RepJimBanks how do you listen to concerns from Constituents for one hour? A 1/4 of which will be you talking about how awesome the GOP is. So one is in the evening the other two are during the work day. Great job avoiding us.
955981994550231040 2018-01-23 01:54:03 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @WOWOpatmiller So where is the schedule? Where do we find it? Did not hear the show Pat, where is the Congressman going to meet Constituents?
955891857032142848 2018-01-23 19:55:52 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @RepJimBanks @SenToddYoung here is a story you should be bragging about! The new lower business tax scam you passed is going to further gut jobs in the US. Great Leadership gentleman.https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/12/tax-jobs-overseas/547916/
955887677315911685 2018-01-23 19:39:16 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, what you miss is that Indiana ranks among the lowest in terms of pay. So many working poor in your district, both husband and wife work at a job that pays low end wages. Employing people is good, giving them wages they can survive on is what all these new jobs dont do!
955539142234001408 2018-01-22 20:34:19 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks All of Indianas economy? No, just the folks who contribute to your GOP campaign fund. There you go again supporting small segments of the constituency.  What about the Homeless Vets? What about the working poor. They could not even vote, so they do not count to the IN GOP. Sad!
955484625287118849 2018-01-22 16:57:41 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @SenToddYoung and you Jim are the phonys who have to own this. Stop blaming others and do your job. Oh... Thats right, you remain in the shadows throwing darts until Paul Ryan gives you a sign.  GOP Tool! #TrumpShutdown Looking forward to your 2019 replacement. @CourtneyTritch

We all can see you continue to be a tool of the GOP. You are truly comfortable perpetuating the lies of your team leader in the WH. Sad.

You can do more than just be a rubber stamp GOP tool. Plenty of Constituents in the 3rd district need this help.

954144463475105792 2018-01-18 00:12:21 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @SenToddYoung We remember a year ago when your GOP team leader said we are hiring the best people, believe me, only the best, thats what I do. Great example here.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/954141640075116544
954142716367077376 2018-01-18 00:05:25 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks So you are just like your team leader in the WH. Claiming victory & credit as if it is your doing. So why not take credit for the Government Shutdown! GOP owns all 3 branches yet you blame others, you can not even get your entire team on the same bus. The GOP cannot Lead, SAD!
953995548125736960 2018-01-18 14:20:37 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks That is your belief, you are entitled to that. As my Congressman I expect you to help the child born into poverty, in your district. You care about the unborn, once born, pick yourself up by your boot straps kid, the GOP is dismantling all social programs that might lend a hand
953967650258018304 2018-01-18 12:29:46 UTC <mgevaart> It took Indiana until 1977 before the state legislature ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. The last in America. Does that help you better understand @VP Pence? Yeah, me neither. https://twitter.com/rayboomhower/status/953953321114533888

Oh, we see, you are just re-Tweeting what Paul Ryans staff did. We get it, you are a mere tool. Its OK, so was Stuzman before you.
953435185680445440 2018-01-16 01:13:56 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Of all the world leaders to have a problem with, you choose Canada? What about the guy right down the street Congressman? So you & @realDonaldTrump are a team. The GOP team. He can vilify everybody on Twitter and you give him a pass. SAD!
953295886691467264 2018-01-16 16:00:25 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Great Congressman, good, I will note it on my calendar. Now get back to work doing real legislative things that actually will help your district. When is your scheduled FW Town Hall? Or any 3rd district Town Hall? Where do we find the schedule of those?

Your lack of voice and action against a President who has repeatedly shown his racist biases is how you will be remembered. Regardless of what PR you released in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.

952561479915589632 2018-01-14 15:22:09 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @RepJimBanks @SenToddYoung here is the real news Walmart employees are eligible for the $1,000 bonus only if theyve worked at the company for 20 years. Not having 20 in, those employees will receive a smaller bonus based on seniority. Your #TaxCutsandJobsAct Failed, Sad!

951609521205661697 2018-01-11 00:19:24 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @RepJimBanks now we know why Walmart was excited to give new LOW starting wages ($11.00) and a bonus. That business move had ZERO to do with your so called Tax Cut Job Act. They are closing a number of Sams Club locations. You want to take credit for that?https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/951527233801375745

Can we also work on funding for the VA to better handle our Homeless Vets. There are lots of reasons why they are homeless, they have served us all, we need to help more, not loose more of them.
951477985336549377 2018-01-11 15:36:43 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Jim, wake up! A starting wage of $11 an hour, why is that good news? $ a bonus is a band aid to a large financial wound at best. People making that wage with a family can BARELY make ends meet, in fact, they cannot. They are working poor. Raise the Minimum Wage to $15! Then brag.

948930468493381634 2018-01-04 14:53:48 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Sounds like you are really doing a great job. In words only. Now get back to doing the real work Constituents need.

Constituents want you to get co-sponsers and work legislation that will help us. In 2018 can you actually be an advocate for our Homeless Veterans? Asking for a Homeless vet.
948604845635919872 2018-01-03 17:19:54 UTC <mgevaart> @SenToddYoung Okay, okay, settle down Todd. This is a small drop in the bucket, a 1 off.

945778225267003392 2017-12-26 22:07:55 UTC <mgevaart> While this does sound like a good idea, many of us have a fear of a Pence presidency. He was my Congressman and Governor - Americans deserve a public servent, not a religious ideologue.https://twitter.com/edkrassen/status/945751472117108736
944284480566693888 2017-12-22 19:12:18 UTC <mgevaart> @JGfortwayne @RepJimBanks We agree that the military needs updated equipment to work effectively. We also need a spending bill for the US infrastructure. You have failed to even start that discussion in this session. Great to see you working in a bipartisan fashion. Unlike the tax cut bill you voted on.
943978696423165954 2017-12-21 22:57:14 UTC <mgevaart> @WOWOpatmiller @WOWOFORTWAYNE @RepJimBanks Jim, what is the schedule and where do we find the town hall meeting schedule for this Christmas-break? We want to have a public Q&A on a number of issues. You are home soon, you just said so, can you meet with us your Constituents? Or are U just meeting with the Biz interests.
943968873036083200 2017-12-21 22:18:12 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @MeetThePress Jim, more good paying jobs? Thats what you claim this Tax plan will do? Prove it. You voted (your wife) for RTW in Indiana so you already have a track record of hurting working class families. You are not in our corner as working Hoosiers. Show us you mean it and raise Min Wage!
943951965566001152 2017-12-21 21:11:01 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks You cant be serious! This is completely a BS story by some Bot, designed to skew the numbers to look good for Republicans. Your staff sold you on this idea and and you told them to post it.  Thats my Congressman!
943943664023298048 2017-12-21 20:38:01 UTC <mgevaart> @nikkihaley @RepJimBanks Hey staff, let Jim know we are waiting for the Christmas break schedule of town hall events the  Congressman has planned. Is it invitation only, like before, so you can control it better? Where? When? We want to know. Then we can talk about Nikis leadership.
943890195841277952 2017-12-21 17:05:33 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks If you want to be a hero spend the time and money to investigate your boss @realDonaldTrump. Why look in the rearview mirror? Oh yeah, that is all a conservative can do, no fresh ideas and ways to help. Just retread the same old stuff. Dont forget Bill Clinton and whitwater too
943848939975008256 2017-12-21 14:21:37 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @MaryTrausch Yes I do expect him to vite against it. He knows it is wrong to saddle his Constituents with this bill but does it based on the people he salutes. Ryan and McConnell, and the donors. We get it, he has a right to be wrong and he knows it, he lives with it.

943507875246346246 2017-12-20 15:46:21 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Thanks for showing us this article staff. We do know the tough talk ends when Qatar invites the Congressman-for a visit in middle of winter. Hell be so happy he goes to see the country first hand. Then he is swayed. Others in his chair in the past, did it that way.
943461370036703232 2017-12-20 12:41:33 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks @dsheldonboggs @TracyStoller @MaryTrausch Yes I pop off everyday. I do have my facts straight. I am not asking about past town halls done during the work week for an hour with a controled group of attendees. I simply am asking for an open two way public conversation, he and his staff avoid the idea.
943424464502566912 2017-12-20 10:14:54 UTC <mgevaart> @RepDeSantis @RepJimBanks Jim, do not change the subject, we were trying to ascertain the date and times of your Christmas town hall meetings in the 3rd District of Indiana. Now focus an let us know those details. When? Where? Oh so youre hiding out this holiday, not meeting with concerned Constituents.
943294681911349249 2017-12-19 01:39:12 UTC <mgevaart> Did you make the list?https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/top-1000-comedians-of-2017-zach-broussard
943281283463110658 2017-12-19 00:45:57 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Wow you are a true fighter for religious-liberty  I said sarcastically. Show us you care and have a Christmas town hall, we will show up even if you hold it in a church. We have a lot of questions for you to answer. Remember us?  The Constituents?
943250466116382720 2017-12-19 22:43:30 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Nice to see your pride in smashing the future for Constituents. So when was your town hall meeting? You are home for the holidays, where will you be, when will you let us quizz you about a number of things? You are exactly like Souder and Stuzman, rubber stamp GOPer. Sad!
943216569462779904 2017-12-19 20:28:48 UTC <mgevaart> @SenToddYoung No, you should not.  Vote NO be a hero.
943205990400495616 2017-12-19 19:46:46 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @SenToddYoung please VOTE NO ON GOP TAX BILL. Today we Hoosiers ask you to help us out and bote no on the #GOPTaxBillScam  Please pass this request on staff, we know the Senator does not have a tweet machine, you guys do it all.
943188551918915584 2017-12-19 18:37:29 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @RepJimBanks VOTE NO TODAY! Vote no on the #GOPTaxScam. Can you please pass that on staff, he does not have a tweet machine, you guys handle it.
943168528860971008 2017-12-19 17:17:55 UTC <mgevaart> Hey @RepJimBanks staff what does the Congressman stand to gain by supporting this bill? A rhetorical question, yes. What did the GOP promise him to vote yes? Schedule the Town Hall - we have questions!http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/the-trump-tax-cuts-just-got-even-more-skewed-to-the-rich.html
943166333939838977 2017-12-19 17:09:11 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Unleashes job growth -We know you were handed this and told to re-tweet it. Your staff listens well, you oblige the GOP power players. As a Rep. For us who disagree and want you to VOTE NO. We get the long range- shaft. What do you stand to gain? What did they promise U?
943130268403150848 2017-12-19 14:45:53 UTC <mgevaart> A very sad story about what we are doing to our future generations. In the name of reducing job killing regulations. What a bunch of fools! Masquerading as conservatives.https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-regulatory-rollback-epa
942798030809559040 2017-12-18 16:45:41 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks You are so proud of this bill. Okay, prove it. Stand and answer questions in a Town Hall, you obviously have all the graphics and signage you need, let your Constituents check in with you.  Hey staff! Tell the Congressman to quit hiding from the 3rd District.
942126789828149248 2017-12-16 20:18:25 UTC <mgevaart> Nice to see that Senate and Congressional Reps actually do Town Hall meetings. Not  @RepJimBanks IN 3rd District. He has controled 1 hour events in the middle of the work week. He is a rubber stamp GOPer. Working Hoosiers in NE IN have no voice in Jims controled world.https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/942114376139632640
942080134751965185 2017-12-16 17:13:01 UTC <mgevaart> This is how a real Representative of their Constituents does it. @RepJimBanks you do not even have 10 Town Halls to speak of in 2017. When is your IN 3rd Congressional Dist. Christmas Town Hall? Where is it? Oh! Too Busy, right....https://twitter.com/clairecmc/status/942036693342973953
941842342969044992 2017-12-15 01:28:07 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Yes Jim your staff is playing along with the GOP media machine nicely. Even using the graphic they sent you. The Constituents of your 3rd District have questions we want to ask in the Town Hall setting. What makes you nervous about that option?
941708580637544449 2017-12-15 16:36:36 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks The Washington Examiner! Is that the only Fake News outlet you could get to run the Op-ed? Are you serious?
941678841289945088 2017-12-15 14:38:25 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Exciting! More one way communcation with Constituents. You follow the NE IN GOP model flawlessly Jim. We are ready for your Christmas  break 2017 Town Hall. Where? When? Tweet the details Staff!
941671078337933312 2017-12-15 14:07:35 UTC <mgevaart> @JokelahomaMic @Blankeddie You gotta love the edit at Wikipedia too!pic.twitter.com/0UcLgCxmhu
941335557677907968 2017-12-14 15:54:20 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks So your Staff has a sense of humor. This tweet is not yours Jim. So since staff only sends and reads these. Tell your boss that we are waiting for a Christmas Town Hall announcement. When? Where? We fully expect he is so booked there is not time at all.
941240944132853760 2017-12-14 09:38:23 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Constituents look forward to you Christmas Town Hall in Fort Wayne. When? Where? Details please. Then you can explain how this card, not part of your Tax Cut bill,  is gonna make our lives better.
940948029208776705 2017-12-13 14:14:26 UTC <mgevaart> @USNationalGuard @RepJimBanks We all look forward to meeting you at your Christmas break back in Fort Wayne. We can talk about the great work our Service Women and Men have done over the years. We can ask you questions WHY, about a # of things. Where? When is your open to Constituents meeting?
940598288172142593 2017-12-12 15:04:42 UTC <mgevaart> Now that is some progressive Alabama thinking.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/940591925358448641
940225393138823168 2017-12-11 14:22:56 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks That is correct Congressman. As Constituents we look forward to you exercising our freedom to question your decisions in an open and public forum. When is your Fort Wayne Town hall during the Christmas 2017 break? What date? Where? Details please!
939164788365590535 2017-12-08 16:08:29 UTC <mgevaart> @RepublicanStudy @RepMarkWalker @RepJimBanks So Americans who need the help of Health Care the most are on your list of things to take away. violating individual freedom and liberty is what you claim the ACA does. You have No Plan to replace it, why repeal it! All talk, no action.
939136574788440065 2017-12-08 14:16:22 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Hey Staff, thanks for keeping the Congressmans Twitter feed looking like he is in touch and cares about us. That is not an easy job. So back here in the 3rd District, we are waiting for a town hall in Fort Wayne. Not controled, just let us quiz him. When? Where?
938770432433500161 2017-12-07 14:01:27 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks I think the sentiments of this tweet are correct. You, unfortunately do not get a pass on this historic day. You still stand with and back a corrupt @POTUS - you will always be remembered for that.
938359323268452353 2017-12-06 10:47:51 UTC <mgevaart> @RheaButcher Does this unit also page Jesus? I got some tough questions for him.

937754916847804421 2017-12-04 18:46:09 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks You are perfect for the millionaire class, you will slap each other on the back & vote yes to what they tell you is good. Hurting Constituents In your wake. They even made you a graphic to post. VOTE NO on the bill Jim. Think of us back home.
936291887530561536 2017-11-30 17:52:36 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks We hope your staff tells you what we wrote here. Stop the President. Why is he exempt from not facing his accusers? Why do you cover for him? Protect America and make that a priority, CONGRESSMAN!
936254709018583040 2017-11-30 15:24:52 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Knowing you never read the responses to your tweets, done by staff, you should. The Constituents commenting here are correct and make great points. You are not helping Hoosiers at all. Just the money millionaires youre beholden to.
935952770942799874 2017-11-29 19:25:04 UTC <mgevaart> @IBDinvestors @RepJimBanks Knowing you never read these responses, I will continue. You are sold out to the money team at the exspense of your Constituents. We implore you to think about the people you will be hurting, doing the work of the millionaire class. They will cast you out like trash, soon....
935918426488561664 2017-11-29 17:08:36 UTC <mgevaart> @SenToddYoung as you decide how to Vote on the GOP Tax Bill, we have some headlines for you to review. Stand alone! VOTE NO  ON GOP TAX BILL.  Stop hurting Constituents!pic.twitter.com/Lj5blaMovf
935670245649534977 2017-11-28 00:42:25 UTC <mgevaart> @CFPBDirector @RepJimBanks Who writes these for you? In the best interest of consumers Mick is in it for the millionaires, not you, the Constituents or any consumers.
935655450141478912 2017-11-28 23:43:37 UTC <mgevaart> @RepJimBanks Good to hear, I hope it does pass! We remember Mark Souder had your seat and was awesome at exploiting his staff.
935652291687968768 2017-11-28 23:31:04 UTC <mgevaart> @USCBO @jctgov @RepJimBanks As a Constituent, I am concerned that you continue to support this so called tax cut plan. It only takes care of the people who bought you in the last election. Remember Jim, they will dump you when you do not get re-elected. You never read the responses anyway.
