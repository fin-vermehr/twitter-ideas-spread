913450032703012865 2017-09-28 17:07:13 UTC <estockel> @huzzahmpls And they know this because they've tried. Repeatedly.
913449773704740864 2017-09-28 17:06:11 UTC <estockel> @thehill And, in typical fashion, it will occur days AFTER funding for the program expires, bc, well, they're heartless and incompetent.
913445413935489024 2017-09-28 16:48:52 UTC <estockel> @thehill It will also cure male pattern baldness, feed the hungry and increase Netflix's streaming movie catalogue tremendously.
913445072691019776 2017-09-28 16:47:30 UTC <estockel> @realDonaldTrump @thehill @silveraa Sure they do. But they're far better at blatant lying.

913441171782877185 2017-09-28 16:32:00 UTC <estockel> @TPM And we should all be taking advice on how to protest from self-proclaimed genius Paul Ryan for what reason?
913440821348769792 2017-09-28 16:30:37 UTC <estockel> @DLeonhardt Maybe he needs to rewatch this? (Or watch it for the first time?):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otbml6WIQPo
913439525833031680 2017-09-28 16:25:28 UTC <estockel> @markos And they know this because they've tried. Repeatedly.
913439353099100166 2017-09-28 16:24:47 UTC <estockel> Hey @MEPFuller, I know we've moved on, but 1 q about G-C -- did it ever go thru a "Byrd bath"? So much of it seemed regulatory.
913438936566919168 2017-09-28 16:23:08 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @Meteor_Blades So it achieves its goals? I'm sure they'll be happy to hear it.

913437309638385664 2017-09-28 16:16:40 UTC <estockel> @Atrios It was awful. Iraq, Katrina, gay marriage. But, W wanted a war vs terror, not Islam, and was clear abt it. Trump the open racist is worse
913216853958209537 2017-09-27 01:40:39 UTC <estockel> @Slate If the entire point is a massive giveaway to the wealthy, hard to say it's "pointless." Cruel and misguided, sure, but there is a point.

913215277503995904 2017-09-27 01:34:23 UTC <estockel> @thehill So about 61 cents per person whose credit file was hacked?
913214828189065216 2017-09-27 01:32:36 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein Why not Homeland Security? What with all that experience tracking down the real killers.

912829955687333888 2017-09-26 00:03:15 UTC <estockel> @thehill Given the 1st Amendment has been around since 1789 or so, hard to believe a statement like this should b newsworthy.

912406641001115648 2017-09-25 20:01:09 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin A statement that is both a) flatly and empirically untrue and b) an intentionally inaccurate description of our current system.
912405952829128704 2017-09-25 19:58:25 UTC <estockel> @thehill Um, good.
912405817575354368 2017-09-25 19:57:53 UTC <estockel> @TPM So, we only broke the law a few times. Which is ok. Because "whoopsie."

911726438365020160 2017-09-23 22:58:16 UTC <estockel> @thehill That's a pretty low bar.

910656179172401152 2017-09-20 00:05:26 UTC <estockel> @jimmykimmel @benwikler Cassidy's problem is that Kimmel does, in fact, "understand completely" and raked him over the coals as a result.

910623184096919552 2017-09-20 21:54:20 UTC <estockel> @digby56 Ok. But if Dems can get something (Dreamer bill) of real value, should they abstain simply to avoid boosting his approval? Tough call, no?

910621835686928384 2017-09-20 21:48:58 UTC <estockel> @Atrios Same hacks who elevated Paul Ryan to the status of "reasonable, reliable GOP-er" even though he lies endlessly about everything.

910610025571262464 2017-09-20 21:02:03 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes But, but. Cassidy says there's a deadline. And he's never lied to us.

910608856660578304 2017-09-20 20:57:24 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Explains how loudly undertaker lobby is pushing for it, I suppose.

910293285087756288 2017-09-19 00:03:26 UTC <estockel> @sahilkapur But did they? The word "endorse" appears nowhere in the letter. Seems like they only "thanked" and offered to work with.

910253026941661185 2017-09-19 21:23:27 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @Goingtothegulag Seriously, I think that's what Hayes meant, yes. Don't support it, as I've had to tell about a gazillion people the last hour.
910251021204570113 2017-09-19 21:15:29 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @NomieDpuma Not to my knowledge. Hope they're not. Just trying to understand Hayes's argument; not advocating it.
910250803335540736 2017-09-19 21:14:37 UTC <estockel> @VozdeRaquel Not at all. Terrible idea. Thanks.
910249361195405312 2017-09-19 21:08:53 UTC <estockel> @VozdeRaquel It was answering Armando's question as to what Hayes meant. Geez.
910249203858731008 2017-09-19 21:08:16 UTC <estockel> @VozdeRaquel Um, no. Never said that. Said that's what Hayes seemed to be arguing. I support the ACA. Happy to support improving it and/or single payer 2
910248947406348288 2017-09-19 21:07:15 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @backyardsage Correct, which is y it's a terrible argument. Explaining the argument is not agreeing with it.
910248798126878720 2017-09-19 21:06:39 UTC <estockel> @gilmored85 Not my argument, so no thanks. Analysis not the same as approval. My family gets its insurance from Covered California.
910248038077046784 2017-09-19 21:03:38 UTC <estockel> @steph_bello You're clearly still stuck in a pre-banana republic mindset.
910247445728071680 2017-09-19 21:01:17 UTC <estockel> @mf_buckley Totally agree. I was just trying to understand what Hayes was saying. In no way do I support it.
910247135320227841 2017-09-19 21:00:03 UTC <estockel> @VozdeRaquel I wouldn't do anything to sabotage the ACA. Maybe read my prior text.
910244612857462784 2017-09-19 20:50:01 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @LanceMannion Defeat Graham-Cassidy, preserve ACA as best we can
910244004024819712 2017-09-19 20:47:36 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @LanceMannion True, but they might b able to expand Medicare (and pay for it) under reconciliation. But, yes, not till 2021.
910243712575275009 2017-09-19 20:46:27 UTC <estockel> @VozdeRaquel Ur anger is misdirected. I'm fighting vs this monstrosity. We're on the exchange, too. Sorry abt ur husband.
910243468580024320 2017-09-19 20:45:29 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @emsprater1 Last time -- not advocating, simply trying to understand where hayes was coming from. I agree it'd b a disastrous plan.
910242870174420992 2017-09-19 20:43:06 UTC <estockel> @MEPFuller Wouldn't he achieve same goal if, u know, red states opted in to Medicaid expansion? Oh, right, no tax cuts then.
910242590825390080 2017-09-19 20:41:59 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @eCareDiaryJohn Agree. It's y I'm phone banking vs. Graham-Cassidy. My family's on the freaking exchange, thank u very much.
910242335698567168 2017-09-19 20:40:58 UTC <estockel> @beebigelow Not my plan, thanks. I agree, it's nuts. Not my fault some r actually arguing it.
910241959079317504 2017-09-19 20:39:29 UTC <estockel> @reesetheone1 Gee, thanks I guess. U, too, confused analysis for advocacy, but whatevs.
910241656246493184 2017-09-19 20:38:16 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @LanceMannion Agreed. Except, maybe Dems use reconciliation next time and only need 50 votes, with this train wreck as a template?
910241270102089729 2017-09-19 20:36:44 UTC <estockel> @TPM Opposed:  AMA, hospitals, nurses, insurance industry, patients. In favor: Koch Brothers. Naturally, it has 48 or 49 GOP Senators in favor
910240365747122176 2017-09-19 20:33:09 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @mybookbucket @Lovesxox Except they fund war and defund healthcare, but yeah.
910239867669377024 2017-09-19 20:31:10 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @michele5411 No worries.
910239462705078273 2017-09-19 20:29:33 UTC <estockel> @tomwatson Which is y it's a terrible argument and and awful position to take.
910239283541196800 2017-09-19 20:28:51 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @michele5411 Um, I think u misunderstood analysis for approval. I'm working to defeat Graham-Cassidy and I don't believe in heightening contradictions.
910238483280666624 2017-09-19 20:25:40 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @marya_pasciuto Sounds about right. Terrible argument, but the argument some seem to be making nonetheless.
910238296625655808 2017-09-19 20:24:55 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos Really? Don't you think that was the underlying point of the original quote? Not saying I agree (I'm phone banking for "no" votes).
910237992437952512 2017-09-19 20:23:43 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos @TheStagmania Agreed. Not saying I'm a heighten the contradictions advocate, merely trying to understand the argument.
910237021930582016 2017-09-19 20:19:52 UTC <estockel> @sahilkapur Sure. We can totally count on Ted Cruz to protect the ACA.

910235068513128450 2017-09-19 20:12:06 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Which (apart from tax cuts for the wealthy) is kinda the point, no?
910233549046915073 2017-09-19 20:06:04 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos With no ACA to defend, Dems are a lot freer to advocate for single payer, since there will b no system to disrupt.

868256742785794049 2017-05-26 00:05:13 UTC <estockel> @thehill Which shows he's clearly stupid and arrogant enough to merit a position in Trump Administration.
868255895691472896 2017-05-26 00:01:51 UTC <estockel> @paulkrugman Not so much a question of fingerprints as of blame -- GOP wants to b able to point to another culprit even tho they're holding weapon.

868223697844228096 2017-05-26 21:53:55 UTC <estockel> @thehill He could no doubt help them more by resigning tonight.
868223469296668672 2017-05-26 21:53:00 UTC <estockel> @thehill Because, politics aside, literally everyone hates Ted Cruz.
868223372361998336 2017-05-26 21:52:37 UTC <estockel> @JoyAnnReid And he showed her his electoral college victory map, because we've "elected" an addle-brained authoritarian wanna be.

867902542386085893 2017-05-25 00:37:45 UTC <estockel> @pashulman Completely disingenuous for York to claim ALL Muslims would have to b affected -- all Southern Blacks lynched weren't lynched, FFS.
867898002752495616 2017-05-25 00:19:43 UTC <estockel> @thehill Well then, don't get too close to them unless you want to be body-slammed.
867896633526112257 2017-05-25 00:14:16 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Sure, because it's not like Christie ever hired criminally hackish staff.

867886819223797760 2017-05-25 23:35:16 UTC <estockel> @thehill Well, since he pretty clearly did lie, the Gov isn't really going out on a limb here.

867114804124594176 2017-05-23 20:27:34 UTC <estockel> @NPR How about on a deliberate lie, double-counting the supposed growth effects of tax cuts? And not counting revenue losses from same cuts?
867114603330756609 2017-05-23 20:26:46 UTC <estockel> @Slate Man, will he be surprised when he finds out.

865295483786244096 2017-05-18 19:58:14 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes So, he's fine with his reputation going into garbage as long as we get his name right?
865295133490556928 2017-05-18 19:56:50 UTC <estockel> @Atrios And, not only does one get no credit for that, it's almost like one gets credit demerits. Ur credit negatives must be yuuuge by now.
865294575811809280 2017-05-18 19:54:37 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias Just how disappointed will everyone b if there's no 5:30 bombshell today? It's become expected part of day.
865294346353901568 2017-05-18 19:53:43 UTC <estockel> @JuddLegum They should focus on BENGHAZI!!, IRS and Fast 'n Furious. Don't waste time with AHCA or tax cuts. I'm on board.
865293864747245569 2017-05-18 19:51:48 UTC <estockel> @thehill Let's see. 1) Unqualified; 2) Loves to piss off liberals; 3) Sanctimonious. Check, check and check. Perfect Trump appointee.
865293581967175681 2017-05-18 19:50:40 UTC <estockel> @huzzahmpls "He understood that riling up and terrifying older voters was the key to undermining democracy and the welfare state." There, fixed it 4 him
865293260045991936 2017-05-18 19:49:24 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin You've got nearly 2 hours -- long walk?
865293097021743104 2017-05-18 19:48:45 UTC <estockel> @davidfrum And DC cops stood by. Dry run?
865292777147441152 2017-05-18 19:47:29 UTC <estockel> @FiveThirtyEight 39.5 seems really, really high.
865292697094955008 2017-05-18 19:47:10 UTC <estockel> @thehill He knew he was being used, chafed at then being used, and appointed Mueller as payback.
865292537417809920 2017-05-18 19:46:31 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @K8brannen Yup. Glad he opted for payback.
865292367137357824 2017-05-18 19:45:51 UTC <estockel> @JohnJHarwood They all knew it was a lie, and it all fell apart bc Pres unable to maintain cover story for even 24 hrs. Mueller is Rosenstein's revenge
865290099617026048 2017-05-18 19:36:50 UTC <estockel> @davidfrum @JohnAvlon And Rosenstein sat by (publicly) while WH lied that memo was reason for dismissal. Appointing Mueller is CYA attempt; + right thing to do
865289705658621952 2017-05-18 19:35:16 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw So, he knew it was entirely a pretext. Makes special counsel appointment seem even more like a CYA exercise. Even so, glad he did it.

864974717114925056 2017-05-17 22:43:37 UTC <estockel> @RandySchoenberg To be fair, he may have rethought his position on sp. counsel after Trump threw him under the bus, and Comey memo came out.
864974185486929920 2017-05-17 22:41:30 UTC <estockel> @markos Yeah, they should've saved that for tomorrow around this time. Poor coordination.

864973827050164225 2017-05-17 22:40:05 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes And given how profoundly stupid it would be for Trump to fire Mueller, expect it to happen tomorrow.

864970957747769346 2017-05-17 22:28:41 UTC <estockel> @thehill What's truly sad about this is that it had to be said at all.
864970848158994432 2017-05-17 22:28:15 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein Sadly, you are presuming he retains a morsel of honor and that really might not be the case.

864969906764210176 2017-05-17 22:24:30 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos So, more of a mixed bag?
864969588601049088 2017-05-17 22:23:14 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @DavMicRot What's serious, imho, is that he believed this and yet did nothing about it.

864545457493516289 2017-05-16 18:17:54 UTC <estockel> @JohnJHarwood He meant a "war on white bread" by that nefarious combo of rye and whole wheat.
864545255323914240 2017-05-16 18:17:06 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP It was only meant to be shared with the RUSSIAN media.
864544796387311616 2017-05-16 18:15:16 UTC <estockel> @Salon He's making honest lickspittles look bad.
864544626677436416 2017-05-16 18:14:36 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw @NickRiccardi It's almost a relief to be back on avocado toast. Thanks.

864543580244779009 2017-05-16 18:10:26 UTC <estockel> @RandySchoenberg That sound you heard was McMaster's integrity leaving his body.
864538688117587968 2017-05-16 17:51:00 UTC <estockel> @huzzahmpls Also, way too many steps.
864537928571039744 2017-05-16 17:47:59 UTC <estockel> @kurteichenwald Which is why defense of "it's legal for President to do it" is so profoundly dense. Issue is whether it was wise/thought out. Clearly not.
864537040225837056 2017-05-16 17:44:27 UTC <estockel> @ALT_uscis Nah. Unlike Trump, Bibi is able to hold two opposing ideas in his head at same time and still function.
864535897412259841 2017-05-16 17:39:54 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw You think? Bibi isn't exactly known for letting perceived (or real) slights go by without taking revenge.
864535650187399170 2017-05-16 17:38:55 UTC <estockel> @thehill No. Another in a series of simple answers to stupid questions.
864535223555432449 2017-05-16 17:37:14 UTC <estockel> @ALT_uscis Fortunately for Trump, Bibi is fine with being mistreated, never seeks revenge.
864535058165542912 2017-05-16 17:36:34 UTC <estockel> @JakeSherman Bibi must be so pleased.
864534470216601604 2017-05-16 17:34:14 UTC <estockel> @Toure He could share his own drawing of the Prophet. That I'd love to see.

864533580298428417 2017-05-16 17:30:42 UTC <estockel> @ALT_uscis In fairness, this is according to Kim Guilfoyle, whose primary qualification for job is being accomplished liar.
864532717957914624 2017-05-16 17:27:16 UTC <estockel> @Toure @nycjim Which is perfect -- since she's at Fox, she's already sold her soul and has nothing to lose.
864530840268619776 2017-05-16 17:19:49 UTC <estockel> @thehill That is some epic trolling. They can't believe their good fortune. It won't last boys, so enjoy it while you can.

864528151208009728 2017-05-16 17:09:08 UTC <estockel> @LemieuxLGM Also, Trump "could theoretically" become rational, competent and effective. Equally likely.
864524595411394560 2017-05-16 16:55:00 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Clearly no. But didn't the voters kinda make that decision in November? It's almost as if they didn't care.
864524287146733570 2017-05-16 16:53:46 UTC <estockel> @thehill Is he being held hostage? The guy can quit.
864523923492229120 2017-05-16 16:52:20 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw Then why share it with, you know, Tass?
864523618453118977 2017-05-16 16:51:07 UTC <estockel> @digby56 What could possibly go wrong? "In conclusion, let me share my own drawing of the Prophet Mohamed. Great guy, did some amazing things."
864523051014119424 2017-05-16 16:48:52 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger @JohnnyMcNulty I think he gave the football to the Russians last week, so we're good.
864522850719252481 2017-05-16 16:48:04 UTC <estockel> @mirandayaver Same standard? Heck, I'd be happy with any standard at this point, beyond whatever he does we're ok with as long as he signs tax cut.
864522291647963137 2017-05-16 16:45:51 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw He was more worried about his soul, AFAICT.
864522109162094592 2017-05-16 16:45:07 UTC <estockel> @sahilkapur On upside, seems to be ruling out 10 year tax cut that explodes deficit. Which is deeply surprising, if true.
864521734715695104 2017-05-16 16:43:38 UTC <estockel> @thehill Meh. It's all about name recognition at this point. Useless clickbait until at least 2019.
864515503859023873 2017-05-16 16:18:52 UTC <estockel> @seungminkim @burgessev @rachaelmbade @politico McCain raised his threat level from "concerned" to "disturbed" with furrowed brow. At some point, may even reach "upset." Will do squat.
864515147401805824 2017-05-16 16:17:27 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @sparksjls They always opt for stupid when other choice is evil. At the root of it, he's stupid, the rest are evil.
864514842006179840 2017-05-16 16:16:14 UTC <estockel> @HunterDK More specifically, he leaked it to the Russian PRESS. I guess their press is more trustworthy?
864514488413806592 2017-05-16 16:14:50 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @MacFarlaneNews In other words, it's Tuesday.
864513256886378496 2017-05-16 16:09:56 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin That line would seem to apply to pretty much any information in Trump's head.

864512744099282946 2017-05-16 16:07:54 UTC <estockel> @DavidCornDC Completely eliding fact Trump leaked info to Tass (i.e., media). So, it's only bad to leak to US press?
864511732953169920 2017-05-16 16:03:53 UTC <estockel> @AdamSerwer Eliding the fact Trump shared the info with Tass -- Russian press agency. Hypocrisy is annoying. Moronic hypocrisy it titanically annoying
864511361870475265 2017-05-16 16:02:25 UTC <estockel> @sahilkapur Um, Trump shared the info with the RUSSIAN PRESS. They, like Wapo, have opted not to print it thus far.
864296619797225472 2017-05-15 01:49:06 UTC <estockel> @voxdotcom Nope, just furrowing brows and expressing concern bf getting back to trashing health care and cutting taxes

864265574901207040 2017-05-15 23:45:44 UTC <estockel> @thehill @Vladimir_Putrid Nope. Means there's something in the story he can point to as wrong, without getting to the gist. Very lawyerly and intentional.

864248561520697344 2017-05-15 22:38:08 UTC <estockel> @JohnJHarwood Which isn't close to a denial. But you already knew that.

859874158607347712 2017-05-03 20:55:49 UTC <estockel> Coming down to the wire and it may get the votes unless the calls keep flooding in.https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/859873241703337984

859822908264243205 2017-05-03 17:32:10 UTC <estockel> @thehill @seanjbillings They were all winnable, Sean, and she would've won them sans Comey. Winning WI & MI but not PA doesn't change result so what's ur point?
859821605286838272 2017-05-03 17:27:00 UTC <estockel> @thehill @seanjbillings My point is that Axelrod is being an ass. Visiting Wis doesn't lead to EC win; Comey following rules does.
859818588936429568 2017-05-03 17:15:00 UTC <estockel> @thehill And campaigning in Wisconsin would have swung Pennsylvania precisely how?
859811965404758016 2017-05-03 16:48:41 UTC <estockel> @thehill Congressional GOP doesn't care if it gets in the way of cutting taxes for the 1%.
859808153717714944 2017-05-03 16:33:32 UTC <estockel> @TPM Vote for something that will never be law, but will be fodder for 2018 ads? So compelling it's a wonder they're having tough time with it

859456692806852608 2017-05-02 17:16:58 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias A good test of whether GOP really is post-truth party.

859212552324079616 2017-05-01 01:06:50 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes So, per Trump, Jackson (a Dem) > Lincoln (who, unbeknownst to most, was a Republican)?

857372710548127744 2017-04-26 23:15:58 UTC <estockel> @TopherSpiro It was "should" in the normative rather than the legal sense. It "shouldn't" happen, and when it does, we'll be sad.

853022791750176768 2017-04-14 23:10:56 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm @Hadas_Gold It was either that or drop "News"
853018839772090368 2017-04-14 22:55:14 UTC <estockel> @ABCWorldNews @aravosis Are you sure they weren't "deaccomodated"?
853017829150294016 2017-04-14 22:51:13 UTC <estockel> @Atrios @EnBuenora Why are you leaving out the millions who believe chemtrails cause Bigfoots?
853017191406460928 2017-04-14 22:48:41 UTC <estockel> @Atrios Sure. But "we're sucking up to crazy people" doesn't sound so hot, either, even if more honest.
853014419705438208 2017-04-14 22:37:40 UTC <estockel> @jbarro You missed the fine print in his statement: "Unless someone wants to hire me to run the thing; in that case, never mind."
853013712667463680 2017-04-14 22:34:51 UTC <estockel> @thehill Apparently meaning Russia is manufacturing more and more "evidence" it was staged.
853013413701615617 2017-04-14 22:33:40 UTC <estockel> @EricBoehlert Don't give them any ideas. Please.
853013314141536257 2017-04-14 22:33:16 UTC <estockel> @EricBoehlert Around 15% of Americans (which is millions of people) disapprove of interracial relationships. Do they get a spot on NY Times Op-ed page?
853005869771915265 2017-04-14 22:03:42 UTC <estockel> @thehill @timothyj9090 I know. I meant to exclude that element by including "sentient."
853005355621556224 2017-04-14 22:01:39 UTC <estockel> @FiveThirtyEight Silly question. If Brownback were to blame, November would've looked identical. It didn't. So, it's clearly backlash to Trump.
853004935620771840 2017-04-14 21:59:59 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Does anyone else remember all those press stories in 2009 about whether Obama voters still supported him? Yeah, me either.
853004665473990657 2017-04-14 21:58:54 UTC <estockel> @thehill Since it seems all Carter Page does is lie, does this mean all the lies really aren't coming out into the open? So confusing.
853004079798210561 2017-04-14 21:56:35 UTC <estockel> @Nate_Cohn In fairness, his election is this week, theirs aren't for 18 months. Big urgency level distinction.
853003803074871296 2017-04-14 21:55:29 UTC <estockel> @thehill Well, since most sentient humans long ago reached the same conclusion, how does this add to the discussion?
852985295158919168 2017-04-14 20:41:56 UTC <estockel> @thehill No. Instead, by all means continue to permit yourselves to be lied to and taken advantage of.

852027798013083648 2017-04-11 05:17:11 UTC <estockel> @BarbinMD Maybe, then. But, from context it's possible Spicey's trying for "de-escalate", since he links it to weakening ISIS?
851979076915081217 2017-04-11 02:03:35 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Ah, how about majority of voters?

851958223544492032 2017-04-11 00:40:43 UTC <estockel> @tribelaw Nothing whatsoever will set it straight. It'd be at least a tad reassuring to know Comey regrets his actions, I suppose.

845304351765643264 2017-03-24 16:00:37 UTC <estockel> @LemieuxLGM So, Trump's as vain, stupid and lacking in discernment as a typical DC pundit?
845303557708365828 2017-03-24 15:57:27 UTC <estockel> @jonfavs @Taniel Well, he also hasn't come out for it, which, to me, hints he's opposed but afraid to say so until he knows it's going down

845056041238745089 2017-03-23 23:33:55 UTC <estockel> @davidaxelrod And, yet, not god-awful enough for Freedom Caucus quite yet.
845055613713317888 2017-03-23 23:32:13 UTC <estockel> @HuffingtonPost Because of course they do. It's like they want to b seen as Dr. Evil's henchmen.
845054784541409281 2017-03-23 23:28:55 UTC <estockel> @Bencjacobs @BenjySarlin @CharlesPPierce And a Freedom Caucus/Tuesday Group fight broke out, amirite?

845039853955821568 2017-03-23 22:29:35 UTC <estockel> @KCB0801 @TrumpTrain09 Hah. Ryan's dream is to destroy Medicaid. He does NOT want bill to fail.
845039688528252928 2017-03-23 22:28:56 UTC <estockel> @KCB0801 @TrumpTrain09 Actually 3, but I get that math is hard. Ryan's bill proves he can't understand it, either.

845038787264602113 2017-03-23 22:25:21 UTC <estockel> @KCB0801 @TrumpTrain09 So, it passes House with zero Dem votes; fails in Senate with zero Dem votes, and it's the Dem's fault? 1/
845030873401442305 2017-03-23 21:53:54 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Predictions r hard, esp about the future, but I have zero confidence in any Trump selection.
845030124785303552 2017-03-23 21:50:56 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Well, ship has sailed, since Schumer seems to b planning a filibuster.
845029924104650754 2017-03-23 21:50:08 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Doesn't matter what he believes (if anything) -- he's delegated judicial picks to ideologues.
845029073860509696 2017-03-23 21:46:45 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Didn't say it did. Just explaining base's justifiable anger, which Dems need to account for.
845028727264194561 2017-03-23 21:45:23 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Maybe 1, but he still fills the seat, absent extraordinary circumstances, no?
845028326200639488 2017-03-23 21:43:47 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Well, in fairness, they're right.

845026482174910464 2017-03-23 21:36:27 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus So, ur theory is when filibuster gets nuked next time, Dems get more political mileage out of it?

845025338828607489 2017-03-23 21:31:55 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @PsychSailor @DMiddletonCbus Explain how it would be worse?

845021746705022976 2017-03-23 21:17:38 UTC <estockel> @TopherSpiro But if anyone can do it, it's our boy Ryan!
845021612172750848 2017-03-23 21:17:06 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus Reid never thought otherwise, but GOP was blocking every DC Cir appointee -- couldn't let that stand.
845021341891739648 2017-03-23 21:16:02 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus I c ur point, just don't think a filibuster u can never use w/o losing it is worth preserving.
845020736800538624 2017-03-23 21:13:38 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus I think you have nothing at either point, because filibuster is illusory even now. Garland response a must now.
845020140856999936 2017-03-23 21:11:15 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus True. And what would happen to filibuster if Dems tried to use it then?
845019912569466880 2017-03-23 21:10:21 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus 1) Don't reward GOP behavior re: Garland; 2) filibuster not much of weapon if u can't ever use it.
845019219880112128 2017-03-23 21:07:36 UTC <estockel> @conor64 @DMiddletonCbus Probably forcing GOP to end filibuster for SCOTUS nominees, either for Gorsuch or whoever comes next.

845017836477071360 2017-03-23 21:02:06 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS Maybe if they added human sacrifice (of poor people and their children), it'll be cruel enough?

845011836227379200 2017-03-23 20:38:15 UTC <estockel> @thehill Maybe taking health insurance from millions to give tax breaks to a wealthy few wasn't such a good idea after all?

845010117913300992 2017-03-23 20:31:26 UTC <estockel> @Salon Maybe they'll just end up with the ACA and pretend they've done repeal and replace? We should b so lucky.
845009472338591744 2017-03-23 20:28:52 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias So, FC just holding out for maximal gain? And then voting "yes." Could b. Result dies in Senate, no?
845009179962044416 2017-03-23 20:27:42 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS And, to whom? Each offer seems to lose as many votes as it gains.

845008754856812544 2017-03-23 20:26:01 UTC <estockel> @digby56 And as soon as we find that cover, we'll put it in bill form and hold a vote.
845008396642217984 2017-03-23 20:24:35 UTC <estockel> @Slate @MBkgirl Absolutely. Just couldn't resist a little fun at their expense. Keep calling -- it's clearly working.

845007035687100416 2017-03-23 20:19:11 UTC <estockel> @digby56 Maybe, but Trump turns on Ryan in a heartbeat if this goes down and Paul ends up in a hammock next to Boehner, sipping whiskey.

845006234197508096 2017-03-23 20:16:00 UTC <estockel> @RogueSNRadvisor Because the Dems have a majority in the Senate? Even Trump voters not that stupid.

844987754429612032 2017-03-23 19:02:34 UTC <estockel> Just got blocked by AHCA supporter who thinks ACA is like single-payer and apparently couldn't stand facing rational argument. Typical.https://twitter.com/estockel/status/844987315663454208
844987315663454208 2017-03-23 19:00:49 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 Yes, for a small # that's true. AHCA would make this worse -- out-of-pocket costs would soar to keep govt costs down.
844987052290584577 2017-03-23 18:59:47 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 W/o which, 2 members of my family used to be uninsurable at any cost, for very minor preexisting "conditions."
844986912976756736 2017-03-23 18:59:13 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 ACA is primarily market-driven (which is one of its weaknesses, imho). It "works" for me b/c of pre-existing condition rule. 1/
844985895937687553 2017-03-23 18:55:11 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 1) We don't have a system like any of those. 2) They spend far less than we do per capita and largely get better results.
844985467460186112 2017-03-23 18:53:29 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 That includes home insurance, fire insurance, car insurance. It's all cost-sharing. And it totally works, btw.
844985357816905728 2017-03-23 18:53:03 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 By your definition, insurance is "socialism" since it's spreading the cost around a lot of people.

844984019922051072 2017-03-23 18:47:44 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 It's not a question of preferences (and, btw, only I pay for mine, thx), but insuring a minimum level of access to care
844983691487031296 2017-03-23 18:46:25 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 Bronze level plans on the exchanges really pretty much are catastrophic plans, so, really, go right ahead
844983550713593856 2017-03-23 18:45:52 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 Oil changes don't cost quite as much as, say, an MRI, at least not in my neck of the woods.
844981718314450945 2017-03-23 18:38:35 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Kind of a low bar. They'd be a lot more competent with the Three Stooges sharing the role.
844981402625978369 2017-03-23 18:37:20 UTC <estockel> @NickKristof At some point in 2018 or so, Trump will look an interviewer straight in the eye, and deny ever having been President.
844980291168972800 2017-03-23 18:32:55 UTC <estockel> @EJDionne The longer this hangs over them, the tougher the vote will be. And, if it's only gonna die in Senate, y take tough vote at all?
844979573058027522 2017-03-23 18:30:03 UTC <estockel> Torn between those who want millions to lose coverage and those who believe remaining "insurance" should cover nothing, answer is "delay."
844978569226838017 2017-03-23 18:26:04 UTC <estockel> @thehill To never would be good.
844978259389403136 2017-03-23 18:24:50 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias You attract some really sad trolls, apparently. If only their mommies had loved them.
844786432434593796 2017-03-22 05:42:35 UTC <estockel> @Lynn_Rose1 Lynn (it appears we're on a first name basis) -- No, just no. Health insurance that covers nothing isn't insurance.
844723323686727680 2017-03-22 01:31:49 UTC <estockel> Honestly, what is wrong with these people?https://twitter.com/johnjharwood/status/844700541376745474

844687078864519168 2017-03-22 23:07:47 UTC <estockel> @emptywheel Only the best enemies.
844686999420256256 2017-03-22 23:07:28 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin Absolutely. Huge incentive to pass this steaming pile of horse dung to the Senate and even there, it might survive w/ changes
844682455109922816 2017-03-22 22:49:25 UTC <estockel> @aravosis Is he consistently wrong or consistently lying (i.e., stupid or evil)? Or is he both?
844681007726931968 2017-03-22 22:43:40 UTC <estockel> @DecisionDeskHQ @ThePlumLineGS Maybe they'll go ahead with the vote anyway -- bill reveals they are terrible at math.
844678916409196546 2017-03-22 22:35:21 UTC <estockel> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @RepTedLieu Should be called the "Making Americans Poorer Act."
844678292925964288 2017-03-22 22:32:53 UTC <estockel> @tedcruz @sahilkapur Meaning it doesn't do enough to raise deductibles and copays. Once an a$$hole, always an a$$hole, Ted.
844677595887108096 2017-03-22 22:30:06 UTC <estockel> @aravosis @DavidMDrucker And he may soon be joined on that porch by Paul Ryan.

844676818913308673 2017-03-22 22:27:01 UTC <estockel> @wilw Can we appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Nunes? Please.
844676660968378368 2017-03-22 22:26:23 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin @ChadPergram Awesome -- making it even more impossible to get thru the Senate (and possibly losing "moderate" votes in House)

844667994957463552 2017-03-22 21:51:57 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein @tribelaw Fairly certain in today's GOP that merits a huge promotion for Nunes (whenever next scandal opens Admin position)
844666559201128449 2017-03-22 21:46:15 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein And the chances of that happening? Vanishingly small.
844423720513028097 2017-03-21 05:41:18 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein You mean it's an atom bomb?
844345064125980672 2017-03-21 00:28:45 UTC <estockel> @thehill And it's no doubt already failing.
844344659597934592 2017-03-21 00:27:08 UTC <estockel> @jonfavs Lincoln had no idea health care could be so complicated, though.
844344402256453632 2017-03-21 00:26:07 UTC <estockel> @peterdaou So tired of all the winning.
844342005144600576 2017-03-21 00:16:35 UTC <estockel> @thehill If this is true, such devices can come onto planes at any airport, so why limit ban to a few (in mainly Muslim nations)?
844325562629865472 2017-03-21 23:11:15 UTC <estockel> @thehill Racism? White nationalism? Taking insurance from millions? Turtle's fine with it. But don't mess with State Dept budget
844324763866578944 2017-03-21 23:08:05 UTC <estockel> @ChelseaClinton Another great reason to live elsewhere
844324437549727745 2017-03-21 23:06:47 UTC <estockel> @conor64 Oh, so only GOP Senators can flout constitutional norms?
844324117276909568 2017-03-21 23:05:30 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Would b priceless if they're forced to postpone vote, then bring up debt ceiling
844314640205004800 2017-03-21 22:27:51 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Or Hardee's!
844285068969324544 2017-03-21 20:30:21 UTC <estockel> @thehill Wow. I'm agreeing with Bill Kristol. Hell must seriously be frozen.
844282747602452480 2017-03-21 20:21:07 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @StevenTDennis Well, that is why it's unpopular with Freedom Caucus, right? Rest of America another story.
844282244294311936 2017-03-21 20:19:07 UTC <estockel> @thehill Maybe because he was so helpful in getting him elected?
844271685213667328 2017-03-21 19:37:10 UTC <estockel> @thehill Putting cart before horse -- who even knows if this train wreck can pass the House?
844249134706057216 2017-03-21 18:07:33 UTC <estockel> @BruceBartlett Number was far higher before Judge Wapner died. Wait, what?
844247721758240769 2017-03-21 18:01:56 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Except they'd have to buy her off with a special Ketchikan kickback, no?
844246928124620800 2017-03-21 17:58:47 UTC <estockel> @anylaurie16 And one very old white women, don't forget.
844246787623854080 2017-03-21 17:58:14 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin So, special deal for Alaska? And, what gets Cotton on board?
844245256333737984 2017-03-21 17:52:09 UTC <estockel> @TPM Yeah, that's it. Who is this Manafortissimo guy anyway?
844244741436854272 2017-03-21 17:50:06 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Beauty of it is their careers are on the line either way.
844244401060700161 2017-03-21 17:48:45 UTC <estockel> @RepLanceNJ7 @daveweigel @JonathanTamari WTF is "strong lean no"? He's either a strong "no" or he's leaning "no" but hasn't decided.
844243553131753472 2017-03-21 17:45:23 UTC <estockel> @stevebenen Apparently allowing a petulant man-child under FBI investigation to make successful appointment.
844241503027265536 2017-03-21 17:37:14 UTC <estockel> @jbarro @kyledcheney Finally, an upside to electing rigid ideologues to Congress!
844236481375887360 2017-03-21 17:17:16 UTC <estockel> @ASlavitt If they cared about health policy, they'd have had at least 1 hearing on the bill. Craven hacks is all they r.
844234702248554496 2017-03-21 17:10:12 UTC <estockel> @thehill Just put a period after "Republican" and that about sums it up.

844011316775854080 2017-03-20 02:22:33 UTC <estockel> @TopherSpiro So, it all comes down to which side is marginally less terrible at vote counting?

844000325279203328 2017-03-20 01:38:52 UTC <estockel> @thehill Or, more accurately, aimed a bright spotlight at said big, grey cloud.
844000135042408448 2017-03-20 01:38:07 UTC <estockel> @tribelaw He never had anything other than yuuge credibility gap. Wasn't obvious to all b/f now b/c press covered it as circus not news.
843999367862206464 2017-03-20 01:35:04 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP William Henry Harrison such a piker -- only President for 30 days, couldn't even get FBI to investigate him b/f he died. Sad.
843998740906106880 2017-03-20 01:32:35 UTC <estockel> @tribelaw And, ironically, Ryan only has that support conditionally and will be thrown under the bus at first opportune moment.

843997934500769793 2017-03-20 01:29:22 UTC <estockel> @Reuters @fulelo Because Trump is Putin's plemennaya sobaka, of course.
843997333331222529 2017-03-20 01:26:59 UTC <estockel> @thehill Also, peanut butter a nice combo with jelly.

841774270044753920 2017-03-14 22:13:20 UTC <estockel> @jbarro True. But AHCA would force many to spend much more, up to more than 100% of income on insurance. Kind of a problem, no?

839934315492278272 2017-03-09 20:22:00 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein Is there a formall legal term for when cumulative circumstantial evidence is more massive than a mid-sized planet?
839652350033723392 2017-03-08 01:41:34 UTC <estockel> @danpfeiffer Was originally 99% and 99%, so, in comparison, POPULISM!!
839652057711718401 2017-03-08 01:40:25 UTC <estockel> @NormOrnstein I think he meant 20 years of experience lying about health policy, and it shows.
839650260293070848 2017-03-08 01:33:16 UTC <estockel> @daveweigel Eternal question -- stupid or evil? Or, maybe some combination? Stevil?

839648631896485888 2017-03-08 01:26:48 UTC <estockel> @aravosis He can hardly be less qualified for his gig than Carson is to be Secretary.
839648282133463040 2017-03-08 01:25:25 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger I think rather than calling that "redistribution", they refer to it as "just desserts."
839637439329140736 2017-03-08 00:42:19 UTC <estockel> @politico Which, tbh, sounds like he has no idea if it's serious. Which is likely the case.
839636944489336832 2017-03-08 00:40:21 UTC <estockel> @costareports "The big gun"? Bringing in Cheney?
839626577906282496 2017-03-08 23:59:10 UTC <estockel> @thehill There's something deliciously ironic in the use of the word "boy" here.
839603178098196480 2017-03-08 22:26:11 UTC <estockel> @TPM Against: AMA, hospitals, AARP            For: Partisan hacks who wouldn't recognize health policy if it ran them over. Please proceed
839593427608096768 2017-03-08 21:47:26 UTC <estockel> @thehill In fairness, Spicer isn't being paid. Doing all this in hopes of impressing Melissa McCarthy.
839592387131252736 2017-03-08 21:43:18 UTC <estockel> @EricBoehlert It's all part of plan to heighten contradictions -- between them and any sense of competence. Totally working.
839590366609195008 2017-03-08 21:35:16 UTC <estockel> @Reince @aravosis @oliverdarcy Breitbart logic: "Treason -- putting country (or anything) before alt right web site."
839589863464677376 2017-03-08 21:33:16 UTC <estockel> @politico Right. Call it "Dead on Arrival"
839586381617758208 2017-03-08 21:19:26 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Of course, had to look up what that is. But, yes ma'am, will do!
839585252725026816 2017-03-08 21:14:57 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Also allowing coal companies to crap in rivers, mentally ill to buy guns, and Russia to influence our elections. Just sayin'
839584826298523648 2017-03-08 21:13:15 UTC <estockel> @thehill So, more validation of solid Obama economy he inherited. I'm confident in his ability to wreck it -- just give him time.
839584150193524736 2017-03-08 21:10:34 UTC <estockel> @daveweigel Did they actually say "grow after a loss"? Engage in an epic Twitter meltdown is a lot more likely.
839583570322608128 2017-03-08 21:08:16 UTC <estockel> @thehill Because, after all, what do hospitals know about health care?
839303940948668416 2017-03-07 02:37:07 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Not convinced he ever had one.
839303710559752192 2017-03-07 02:36:12 UTC <estockel> @brianefallon Is there snow in the ground in Hell? No? Then not much chance for Dem votes in support.
839303496713170945 2017-03-07 02:35:21 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm Why not just name a post office and call it a day?
839297281295704064 2017-03-07 02:10:39 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Nope. Another in a series of simple answers to simple questions.
839297105747296256 2017-03-07 02:09:58 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Fortunately for GOP, older white people rarely vote in midterms.
839296792122421249 2017-03-07 02:08:43 UTC <estockel> @nycsouthpaw So, a typical GOP dinner then.
839295459277447168 2017-03-07 02:03:25 UTC <estockel> @thehill Also will not support accusations with anything remotely resembling evidence. So there.
839294314643496961 2017-03-07 01:58:52 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias @HeerJeet Maybe Ted saw that as some sort of compliment?
839286308711227392 2017-03-07 01:27:03 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias Haven't you noticed all the time travel shows lately? Based on GOP Congress.
839285803700248576 2017-03-07 01:25:03 UTC <estockel> @jbarro I miss Admiral Stockdale. Nice reference.
839269888472428544 2017-03-07 00:21:48 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes In fairness, everyone mocks Rand Paul. It's kind of a thing and almost makes Trump an iota more relatable.
839269486628749314 2017-03-07 00:20:13 UTC <estockel> @aravosis As opposed to actual bloodbath for the poor, near-retirement and/or sick if the thing passes.
839247134100578304 2017-03-07 22:51:23 UTC <estockel> @JuddLegum All they care about is cost to the government, which they will be lowering.
839246942064422912 2017-03-07 22:50:38 UTC <estockel> @EricBoehlert Because they all happen to love borscht, not paella, kung pao, or kebabs, and it was all a recipe exchange.

839232766516420608 2017-03-07 21:54:18 UTC <estockel> @samsteinhp As in "mercy killing"? 'Cause that's only way it makes any sort of sense.
838887861021614080 2017-03-06 23:03:46 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm @ChrisJansing They do. But the question wasn't whether Trump should be institutionalized.
838878635255726080 2017-03-06 22:27:06 UTC <estockel> @politico Maybe u should've considered that before u screwed with our elections, and helped put a petulant man-child in charge, Vlad
838871166437621760 2017-03-06 21:57:26 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm Flaw in theory:  Trump has never read a book.
838870246240899074 2017-03-06 21:53:46 UTC <estockel> @CharlesPPierce That's consistent -- they're bad at pretty much everything else, aside from high-volume lying.
838869980460404736 2017-03-06 21:52:43 UTC <estockel> @jbouie Can't tell. Is he for or against that?
838868506397425664 2017-03-06 21:46:52 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Josh, are you suggesting he was an affirmative action hire? I'm shocked. ; )
838868244547043328 2017-03-06 21:45:49 UTC <estockel> @altusda Fortunately, we have a President who has shown he will react calmly in a crisis. What's that? It's 2017? Never mind.
838867814727311361 2017-03-06 21:44:07 UTC <estockel> @Slate Because of his mind control powers? Cool. Can he now make Trump resign?
838867665779216385 2017-03-06 21:43:31 UTC <estockel> @thehill Reading that, it's almost like he has someone from Exxon in his cabinet.
838866634022367232 2017-03-06 21:39:25 UTC <estockel> @RealBenCarson @PeterBeinart @JamilSmith Well, we all know immigration isn't his real area of expertise; housing is. Wait, what? Never mind
838865519637745664 2017-03-06 21:34:59 UTC <estockel> @markos On the other hand, he's a very accomplished liar -- always try to see the good in people, Markos.
838864864579727366 2017-03-06 21:32:23 UTC <estockel> @HuffingtonPost Well, sure. Except in the sense they didn't come here voluntarily and were paid nothing at all, and were, u know, slaves.
838857439915040768 2017-03-06 21:02:53 UTC <estockel> @JuddLegum By immigrants? No? Then the DOJ doesn't care.
838857194435031041 2017-03-06 21:01:55 UTC <estockel> @anylaurie16 @BBGVisualData Which is a merely a remarkable coincidence. Times two.

838547859217633282 2017-03-05 00:32:43 UTC <estockel> @tribelaw Also that Obama did nothing w/ wiretap info letting Trump "win" in November. What was the supposed point?

838510026272591873 2017-03-05 22:02:23 UTC <estockel> @jbview Right. Golf hypocrisy of zero signif, unless calling it out undermines his ability to undermine our institutions.

838505145080033281 2017-03-05 21:42:59 UTC <estockel> @joanwalsh Well, he's recused himself. And, no other Trump political appointees in place, right?
838504727897747456 2017-03-05 21:41:20 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS Sessions is recused. Any other political appointees around?

838480277500370944 2017-03-05 20:04:11 UTC <estockel> @IndivisibleTeam But Hillary once bought a Russian nesting doll for her granddaughter. And had a private e-mail server. Both sides.
838479910867906560 2017-03-05 20:02:43 UTC <estockel> @KagroX Isn't it also possible that there's no there there and inquiry will turn up zero?
838479690163605504 2017-03-05 20:01:50 UTC <estockel> @latimes Also demands Congressional inquiry into Cruz's father as Grassy Knoll shooter, Area 51 and status of Elvis's health.

838448648295866368 2017-03-05 17:58:30 UTC <estockel> @kurteichenwald Reminds me of the certitude last year that Hillary would be in jail long before the election. Rubes.

838269814674079744 2017-03-04 06:07:52 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS @0burns @RealSallyWade Nothing whatsoever. Issue is why Trump would want us all to know he was under FBI investigation.
838211627178565632 2017-03-04 02:16:39 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS @0burns @RealSallyWade Is it normal to want to prove you r under FBI investigation?

838210699566317569 2017-03-04 02:12:58 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS @0burns Perhaps in the fever swamps. In reality, only way to wiretap is with FISA court order obtained for FBI investigation
838209103847575552 2017-03-04 02:06:38 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS So the goal is to prove Trump is under investigation? And here I thought people mostly try to avoid that.

838177610525900800 2017-03-04 00:01:29 UTC <estockel> @jbarro You know that and I know that. When will HE know that?

838148241732489216 2017-03-04 22:04:47 UTC <estockel> @jbarro Saddam had something to gain. Trump?
838144747625537536 2017-03-04 21:50:54 UTC <estockel> @NancyPelosi @politico And she lied about it under oath precisely when? To call this "derp" would be an insult to derp everywhere.
838138369129357312 2017-03-04 21:25:33 UTC <estockel> @thehill Impressive. Gathering in groups of 6 or 7 all over a few places.

838131619344998400 2017-03-04 20:58:44 UTC <estockel> @thehill Because if today shows us nothing else, no harm could possibly result from removing more barriers to Trump being himself
838129984635953152 2017-03-04 20:52:14 UTC <estockel> @altNOAA At this point, pretty sure they're all using burners -- learned that from "The Wire."
838129755022974977 2017-03-04 20:51:19 UTC <estockel> @jbarro It may have occurred to Mitt on occasion.

837800655800557568 2017-03-03 23:03:36 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger And there were no JCC bomb threats or defacement of Jewish cemeteries? Ah, the halcyon days of January, 2017.

837764428506398720 2017-03-03 20:39:39 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP @quasimado But libs and law enforcement officials who warned of this very kind of thing are snowflakes.

837421635783139328 2017-03-02 21:57:31 UTC <estockel> @KagroX He's probably a member of Mar-a-Lago by now, too.
837421429184319488 2017-03-02 21:56:41 UTC <estockel> @politico And she lied under oath about these meetings exactly when?
837421170966179840 2017-03-02 21:55:40 UTC <estockel> @DavidCornDC So, either they confiscated his phone, or we are counting down the Vesuvius of twitter meltdowns.
837420934420025345 2017-03-02 21:54:43 UTC <estockel> @TPM It's almost as if they were coordinating campaign attacks on Hillary and r trying (poorly) to hide it.

837419795364524032 2017-03-02 21:50:12 UTC <estockel> @LOLGOP Or if they "suspect" you voted for Hillary.
837419697058390016 2017-03-02 21:49:48 UTC <estockel> @NPR And I only just realized this today, when someone leaked I had met with Russian Amb, not before, when I hoped to brazen my way thru.
837418954637205504 2017-03-02 21:46:51 UTC <estockel> @christinawilkie @HuffingtonPost And by this I mean he was in no sense "gay", not that he told the truth, whatever that may be.

837408477030973440 2017-03-02 21:05:13 UTC <estockel> @politico And by "honest" I mean only lied under oath about one thing, as far as I currently know. And don't hold me to that.
837407936875880448 2017-03-02 21:03:05 UTC <estockel> @JoyAnnReid Would vetting reduce number of candidates? Then, no -- too few willing to serve already.
837407640305061888 2017-03-02 21:01:54 UTC <estockel> @AltStateDpt If it walks like an authoritarian and talks like an authoritarian, then it must be a member of the modern GOP?
837405777522487296 2017-03-02 20:54:30 UTC <estockel> @anylaurie16 Also were they coordinating Russian attacks on Hillary's campaign? No? Then a pathetic distraction.

837099635743178752 2017-03-01 00:38:00 UTC <estockel> @AdamSerwer Fair point. Maybe this just seems more brazen, but then so does just about everything about him

834128777206652928 2017-02-21 19:52:52 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Not to mention, story is about conservatives disinviting pederasty defender, not liberals' schadenfreude over it
834107850850852864 2017-02-21 18:29:43 UTC <estockel> @thehill Conservatives invited a pederasty defender to speak; conservatives disinvited him and the story is about liberals? Twit.
834096555179126784 2017-02-21 17:44:50 UTC <estockel> @thehill Hardly surprising this twit doesn't understand what censorship is. Apparently consent is also a problem for him.

833752781034905600 2017-02-20 18:58:48 UTC <estockel> @KagroX He meant "defeat ISIS in the Jihad Cup" -- new international golf competition he's practicing for assiduously.

833416456570228736 2017-02-19 20:42:22 UTC <estockel> @politico Whereas sane people dismiss Limbaugh as preposterous. Tomato, tomahto

832783634624978944 2017-02-17 02:47:45 UTC <estockel> @AdamSerwer @liamstack All because he wouldn't dare hurt his base's fee-fees and denounce this kind of obscenity. What an asshat.
832783273495449600 2017-02-17 02:46:19 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Don't confuse the 2 ideas. Impeachment has 2 go thru Congress; 25th Amend just requires majority of cabinet.

832682934331076608 2017-02-17 20:07:36 UTC <estockel> @thehill To do so, they'd pretty much have to stop talking entirely.

832306125458399232 2017-02-16 19:10:18 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm @keithbuell And the deal I got on the price!! Amazing.
832305995015532544 2017-02-16 19:09:47 UTC <estockel> @juliaioffe Trump can't possibly stay away from his tv watching for that long, so don't worry all.
832305840455507968 2017-02-16 19:09:10 UTC <estockel> @thehill "I'm absolutely terrified that you are stark, raving mad, but I don't hate you."
832305718308933632 2017-02-16 19:08:41 UTC <estockel> @thehill Out of? 10?
832304997312237568 2017-02-16 19:05:49 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos That we are ruled and surrounded by morons?
832304346326896640 2017-02-16 19:03:14 UTC <estockel> @jonfavs @alexwagner Watch out. That might be coming soon.

832302730563645440 2017-02-16 18:56:49 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias I think he means for him to spell.
832302084846260224 2017-02-16 18:54:15 UTC <estockel> @kurteichenwald Leaking inaccurate information wouldn't be much of a leak, but I suppose logic is now irrelevant.
832301638417125376 2017-02-16 18:52:28 UTC <estockel> @BenjySarlin Of what year?
832301386205270016 2017-02-16 18:51:28 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @HotlineJosh But are we sure Flynn's not on it?
832301206194188288 2017-02-16 18:50:45 UTC <estockel> @thehill Hopefully from himself.
832300717998120960 2017-02-16 18:48:49 UTC <estockel> @thehill Well, we know which one Trump will tout, don't we?
832300488980770816 2017-02-16 18:47:54 UTC <estockel> @jonathanchait Fake fires are the hardest to put out: can't see them.
832300330939412481 2017-02-16 18:47:16 UTC <estockel> @juliaioffe Trump -- speaking into a mirror.
832300149426642945 2017-02-16 18:46:33 UTC <estockel> @digby56 @thegarance So did OJ.
832299857360543745 2017-02-16 18:45:24 UTC <estockel> @jbarro @DVNJr And at the end "Live from DC, it's Your National Nightmare!!!!" Wheeeee!
832299528615190528 2017-02-16 18:44:05 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @TomKludt FAKE NEWS!!!
832299014578016257 2017-02-16 18:42:03 UTC <estockel> @thehill Meaning Flynn didn't actually contact the Russian Amb? Or didn't really talk about sanctions? Or didn't really resign? So confused
832297649852198913 2017-02-16 18:36:37 UTC <estockel> @TPM So the media demanded and then accepted his resignation? Can u all now demand and accept Trump's? Please!
832297360541704192 2017-02-16 18:35:28 UTC <estockel> @AdamSerwer You liberals, with your fancy "logic."
832297065749348352 2017-02-16 18:34:18 UTC <estockel> @MarkHarrisNYC Did he have a mini-stroke in the midst of that answer? Not a doctor, but did stay at Holiday Inn Express last night.
832295470508580864 2017-02-16 18:27:58 UTC <estockel> @DemFromCT @mattmfm So then why resign?
832295322697150464 2017-02-16 18:27:22 UTC <estockel> @peterdaou You're assuming a GOP Congress would hold him to account. Waiting for any sign of that.
832294021892485120 2017-02-16 18:22:12 UTC <estockel> @peterdaou @DemFromCT From your lips . . .
832293522002751489 2017-02-16 18:20:13 UTC <estockel> @armandodkos Or, he could ban himself and every one of his appointees from government service for life? That'd certainly make us safer.
832293094695395329 2017-02-16 18:18:31 UTC <estockel> So, what'd I miss?
832292826385833984 2017-02-16 18:17:27 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm @ThanksMrSandman Troublingly, might cause an upward bump.
832291748332269568 2017-02-16 18:13:10 UTC <estockel> @Atrios @jamisonfoser That's why he said "I guess." Plausible idiocy.
832291530383585280 2017-02-16 18:12:18 UTC <estockel> @MrDanZak FDR & Co routinely warned about WWII in 1940, said Dan Zak, trying to justify warning about "looming Nazi aggression" in 1948.
832254965179518976 2017-02-16 15:47:00 UTC <estockel> @thehill And focused primarily on his amazing EC victory!
832051863574884353 2017-02-15 02:19:57 UTC <estockel> Read the entire thread. Trump's bs is just overwhelming us all.https://twitter.com/juddlegum/status/832041523659341825
832047423274901505 2017-02-15 02:02:19 UTC <estockel> @EJDionne @LOLGOP @washingtonpost Of course his business is only reason he wants 2 b Pres, but yeah, monumentally unqualified
832046848776953856 2017-02-15 02:00:02 UTC <estockel> @thehill Are you suggesting he's sane?
832038037311729664 2017-02-15 01:25:01 UTC <estockel> @JuddApatow He claims he will next find the "real killers."
832037685279674368 2017-02-15 01:23:37 UTC <estockel> @thehill Wow. Just like nearly half of Americans voted for the tiny-fingered vulgarian
832037391787450368 2017-02-15 01:22:27 UTC <estockel> @SarahLovesTx2 I don't purport to know. Again, why did he resign?
832035134039732224 2017-02-15 01:13:29 UTC <estockel> @jeremyscahill @conor64 Feel free to say "too nauseated" though.
832034863037321217 2017-02-15 01:12:24 UTC <estockel> @thehill And we are totally thankful for that. #incompetentauthoritarians
832034434073235457 2017-02-15 01:10:42 UTC <estockel> @washingtonpost @TPM @SarahLovesTx2 Don't see the point of a Jan 23 story based, of course. R u defending Flynn? Y did he resign?
832028682340364290 2017-02-15 00:47:50 UTC <estockel> @jbarro On whose orders?
832026963577495552 2017-02-15 00:41:01 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes Well, he's not likely to last long, is he?

832024385393340416 2017-02-15 00:30:46 UTC <estockel> @TPM By US or Russian intelligence?
832022569544937472 2017-02-15 00:23:33 UTC <estockel> @thehill Bannon even turned from burying that knife deep in Preibus's back to denounce the story as fake news.
832022046938849280 2017-02-15 00:21:28 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger What about batshit crazy sharks?
832017648753926144 2017-02-15 00:04:00 UTC <estockel> @Slate I hope no one allows these jokers anywhere near sharp objects
832014499636928512 2017-02-15 23:51:29 UTC <estockel> @CNNMoney @PhilippeReines That high?
832014101773590528 2017-02-15 23:49:54 UTC <estockel> @CNNMoney @tedlieu You mean the same logic can be applied to previous Breitbart stories? Who knew?
832011746495787008 2017-02-15 23:40:33 UTC <estockel> @TPM Staffer was lucky; another toddler might have exercised 2d Amendment rights
832006286677913601 2017-02-15 23:18:51 UTC <estockel> @digby56 Kinda obvious follow up: Then why did he resign?
832005130681585664 2017-02-15 23:14:15 UTC <estockel> @joshtpm Well, that's subtle. Nice country you've got there; shame if something happened to it.
832004858022465536 2017-02-15 23:13:10 UTC <estockel> @brianbeutler @nycsouthpaw That's more withholding than FICA.
832004755966697473 2017-02-15 23:12:46 UTC <estockel> @TPM @joshtpm If only it were like The Purge.
832004431101075457 2017-02-15 23:11:28 UTC <estockel> @joanwalsh @SimonMaloy Is he high? Complaints about deductibles have plagued ACA; only will get worse under GOPcare.
832002299744526336 2017-02-15 23:03:00 UTC <estockel> @ActualEPAFacts Cool. What's he running for?
832002140629397504 2017-02-15 23:02:22 UTC <estockel> @Green_Footballs @StephenMillerAL @JenniferJJacobs R we certain Stephen Miller is real? Possible he's reanimated Andy Kaufman pranking us?
832000421669400576 2017-02-15 22:55:33 UTC <estockel> Flynn's response when told of revocation of security clearance: "Russian or American"?
831994443494363136 2017-02-15 22:31:47 UTC <estockel> @HeerJeet Did he rub his handlebar mustache while chortling evilly while saying this?
831994023510364162 2017-02-15 22:30:07 UTC <estockel> @politico Did he finish up with "Now watch this drive"?
831992113772376064 2017-02-15 22:22:32 UTC <estockel> @peterdaou @keethers Both sides.
831990789156663296 2017-02-15 22:17:16 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger You are SO constrained by reality. Move past it to a land of pure imagination!
831989332319694848 2017-02-15 22:11:29 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Were his lips moving? Then, lying, of course.
831989239243960320 2017-02-15 22:11:06 UTC <estockel> @TPM Is that his American or his Russian security clearance that's been suspended?
831988517727150080 2017-02-15 22:08:14 UTC <estockel> @Slate 220, 221, whatever it takes.
831987947054379010 2017-02-15 22:05:58 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias So surprising, given his apparent immunity to crazy conspiracy theories.
831987497273946112 2017-02-15 22:04:11 UTC <estockel> @jimsciutto @DanaBashCNN His American or Russian security clearance?
831987216314281985 2017-02-15 22:03:04 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias Syria has oil?
831984477018558464 2017-02-15 21:52:11 UTC <estockel> @peterdaou And "we might not like the results" doesn't count.
831980711707947008 2017-02-15 21:37:13 UTC <estockel> @jbarro @jtlevy He has the same problem estimating length of his (tiny) dick.
831978474088771584 2017-02-15 21:28:20 UTC <estockel> @thehill I guess there weren't enough puppies to kick today.
831977788802420737 2017-02-15 21:25:36 UTC <estockel> @TheAtlantic @AllMyChandler But I'm totally sure he's thought thru the implications of one state solution. Totally.
831977050969825280 2017-02-15 21:22:40 UTC <estockel> @rmayemsinger Isn't it at least possible Sessions IS at the bottom of Trump's Russia connection? So, kinda easy for him, really.
831975742703427584 2017-02-15 21:17:29 UTC <estockel> @RepAdamSchiff It's a wonder an ego that obscenely large and yet obtuse can fit in the briefing room.
831971672903151616 2017-02-15 21:01:18 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias Dead cat bounce.
831965210000846848 2017-02-15 20:35:37 UTC <estockel> @emquiry @TPM @KT_thomps Um, isn't Trump in charge of the White House?
831964893381144576 2017-02-15 20:34:22 UTC <estockel> @brianbeutler Because "both sides" and all that, amirite?
831964350248148992 2017-02-15 20:32:12 UTC <estockel> @NPR Because nothing says "freedom" like mentally unstable people wielding assault rifles.
831962934532124672 2017-02-15 20:26:35 UTC <estockel> @thehill Can't remember. Is he pro- or anti-leaks?
831959802578231296 2017-02-15 20:14:08 UTC <estockel> @brianbeutler Can you expand on that a tad?
831959613285109760 2017-02-15 20:13:23 UTC <estockel> @GeorgeTakei Seems fair. Herpes has probably reduced unwanted pregnancies. What has Congress done for us since 2011?
831959151152504832 2017-02-15 20:11:33 UTC <estockel> @tedlieu It's the "eventually" part that's troubling. These bozos can do quite a bit of damage before "eventually" arrives.
831957972297281537 2017-02-15 20:06:52 UTC <estockel> @realDonaldTrump @duettonut "Fake news" or "dangerous leaks"? Can't really be both.
831957062787608576 2017-02-15 20:03:15 UTC <estockel> @Salon It couldn't happen to a nicer pair of Brownshirts.
831956151658897408 2017-02-15 19:59:38 UTC <estockel> @DavidCornDC Can't it be both? Oh, please, please, please!!
831954859439988736 2017-02-15 19:54:30 UTC <estockel> @LindseyGrahamSC @politico And that would be? Promotion?
831952626887512065 2017-02-15 19:45:37 UTC <estockel> @SCClemons @JRubinBlogger He's in no way suggesting all this FAKE NEWS isn't surprisingly convincing. To him.
831952146933256192 2017-02-15 19:43:43 UTC <estockel> @natparkundrgrnd Of course, mostly about yuge EC win and nasty leaks (which r either fake new or accurate enough to justify firing Flynn).
831951079042490368 2017-02-15 19:39:28 UTC <estockel> @SteveKingIA @billyeichner Giving twits a bad name since, well, forever.

831948835723173888 2017-02-15 19:30:33 UTC <estockel> @chrislhayes @davidjoachim Great. Now we can get a nominee who is both anti-labor and anti-immigration!!!
831947618473226241 2017-02-15 19:25:43 UTC <estockel> @latimes By then, they hope to have located all the light switches.
831947375761453056 2017-02-15 19:24:45 UTC <estockel> @Reince @markos Not Conway?
831947259088510976 2017-02-15 19:24:18 UTC <estockel> @mattyglesias Or they're planning on turning Orlando into a Trump Potemkin village.
831946898315415554 2017-02-15 19:22:52 UTC <estockel> @natparkundrgrnd He stole that quote from his wife's divorce papers.
831946726835499008 2017-02-15 19:22:11 UTC <estockel> @thehill Because campaigning is so much more fun than, you know, governing.
831946266401648641 2017-02-15 19:20:21 UTC <estockel> @ThePlumLineGS @DeliliaOMalley And we should all be thankful!
831937549585113088 2017-02-15 18:45:43 UTC <estockel> @Salon Can't it be both?
831935510163566593 2017-02-15 18:37:36 UTC <estockel> @thehill It's only news if it's new. He's been doing this consistently.
831935414046904320 2017-02-15 18:37:13 UTC <estockel> @thehill @john_slotkin And you'll be providing evidence for this assertion any minute now. Any minute.
831932430172844032 2017-02-15 18:25:22 UTC <estockel> @thehill Is it still an assassination when the fatal wound was self-inflicted?
831929785634873344 2017-02-15 18:14:52 UTC <estockel> @thehill I guess they're tired of so much winning?
831926677735247872 2017-02-15 18:02:31 UTC <estockel> @juliaioffe Quite a coincidence -- Russians have video of Trump taking gold showers with Russian hookers.
831923682154983424 2017-02-15 17:50:36 UTC <estockel> @thehill Thereupon shoots self, has to change shirt before briefing can commence.
831921268995743744 2017-02-15 17:41:01 UTC <estockel> @Herring_NBA @FiveThirtyEight @alyndanoel So can I. Of course, I'd need to be in a moving vehicle.
831920758678974464 2017-02-15 17:38:59 UTC <estockel> @RepAdamSchiff Or the truth thereof!!
831918483164114945 2017-02-15 17:29:57 UTC <estockel> @rachaelmbade @BresPolitico @politico Umm, maybe because he was part of the transition and could himself be implicated?

831914546239467520 2017-02-15 17:14:18 UTC <estockel> @stevebenen @ThePlumLineGS Absolutely. The subtext about "all these damnable leaks" is "why do all these leaks have to be so true?"
