971527662572376067 2018-03-07 23:26:59 UTC <nicky8009> @williamlegate @hglidewell727 The @NRA could be the good guys for once, but they choose not to. They could push for strong enforced backround checks and at least act like they care. Imagine if the NRA would have called for a mandatory class on all guns, a gun insurance on each weapon, and more. (1/2)
971524825238900736 2018-03-07 23:15:43 UTC <nicky8009> @williamlegate @gazymodo To defend yourself from the other people with a gun of course! (And to make more money!) (Sarcasm).
971514419791454208 2018-03-07 22:34:22 UTC <nicky8009> @williamlegate Its a shame that we have to keep this in mind. Most of my classrooms have one way in, one way out too. I couldnt imagine living on campus right now. This is the only reason im happy that i drive up to my college every day

There is a rating system, however the parents dont use it. Lets take care of the actual problem. This is a gun problem and a parenting problem.

971301879555723265 2018-03-07 08:29:48 UTC <nicky8009> @charliekirk11 Imagine if that solved the bigger problem being gun violence in general, not just in schools
971283622949945344 2018-03-06 07:17:15 UTC <nicky8009> @BetsyDeVosED @KyleKashuv @TinfoilTricorn I will respect anyone until they disrespect me, notice how i was trying to have a civilized coversation with you, and now you are just attacking what i believe in. And you know what ive learned? That you arent deserving of my respect either. Have a good night.
971282792750485504 2018-03-06 07:13:58 UTC <nicky8009> @BetsyDeVosED @KyleKashuv @TinfoilTricorn What is that supposed to mean? I thought that we were having a civilized conversation, however you result in attacking my character. And yes, im proud that they are doing this peacefully. It is important to question what you dont believe is right. This country was built on that.

They experienced something that most wont have to experience. Respect goes both ways. And they are demanding respect right now. Im just proud they are doing it peacefully.

Not saying its right, but thats how it is. They should at least listen to what she has to say. Either way, they will create change at the polls.

970171561796874240 2018-03-03 05:38:19 UTC <nicky8009> @z0mgItsHutch @KingChizz Sympathy is a normal response to kids that saw their friends die. While they arent wrong in that aspect, i do think that the fact that these students saw their friends die is a really good reason to push for gun reform.

Also, you need a license and. insurance to drive? A stricter backround check would certainly allows those who claim law abiding citizens to purchase a gun, as long as they actually are
969066463968493568 2018-02-28 04:27:04 UTC <nicky8009> @NialaCharles @Tecgale @ParentsPromise @stopUSAA Again, no one wants to take away your 2nd amendment rights. We are pushing for stricter backround checks, limits on magazine sizes, repeal of the Dickey amendment, a required gun license thoughout the country, a longer waiting period, and a required insurance to own a gun.
969046996492476416 2018-02-28 03:09:42 UTC <nicky8009> @Walmart @measi @TheBigRuss77 I really dont understand the idea that if someone wants gun reform, they automatically are pro-choice. I support gun reform, but i also do not support abortions. It honestly weakens your arguement if you compare the two. Note how i said reform, and not banning guns.

968346547384672257 2018-02-26 04:46:22 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @peri_vest No one wants to repeal the second amendment. No one. We want some basic restrictions on who can purchase a gun, what kind of guns can be purchased, and the repeal of the Dickey Amendment.

968344596211257344 2018-02-26 04:38:37 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @justsothankfulr What is disrespectful is the fact that they pushed for an amendment that prevents the CDC from doing any research on gun violence. Look into the Dickey Amendment.

967519176117153792 2018-02-24 21:58:41 UTC <nicky8009> @AndyWHumphreys 1. These games are popular in other countries as well, you dont see this problem there. 2.

The criminal shoots someone, then we have 60 people pull out thier guns and start shooting. Would the place not turn into a warzone? Especially those who just heard the gunshot? More people will die.

967482305848709122 2018-02-24 19:32:11 UTC <nicky8009> @FBIMiamiFL @NRA @davidhogg111 @jordan_serena Dont get me wrong, they dropped the ball on this one, but the NRA is not innoncent just because @browardsheriff deserves some blame. Any legislation concerning gun control, automattically gets shut down because the NRA puts the most money in the politicians pockets. (1/2)

967332829813198849 2018-02-24 09:38:13 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @cjjohnsonjr @xCarmelionx While i agree that they screwed up, it still is not their best PR move. What they should be doing is working with LE to make sure this doesnt happen again, not attacking them.
967331554744786944 2018-02-24 09:33:09 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA I havent seen a single person calling for a complete ban on guns. We need a stronger backround check and waiting period when someone wants to purchase a firearm. If the law-abiding citizen was exactly that, they would have no problem obtaining a gun.
967301523071029248 2018-02-23 07:33:49 UTC <nicky8009> @waltshaub @maika_mcmath We've known that for a long time. Why else would he repeal net neutrality without the cable compainies lining his pockets? Especially with all the public outrage there was around it. And the fact that he was a former lawer for verizon.
967228235284180999 2018-02-23 02:42:36 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @RY2066 They start. Most of these people know that these games are not reality. I still never understood why theres the stigma against video games but not movies or tv. They both depict violent acts, but you really dont hear as much about how movies cause these violent acts. (2/2)
967227516200062977 2018-02-23 02:39:44 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @RY2066 I understand what you are saying, but i just want to mention that a lot of kids play video games, and an overwhelming majority have never imitated any of the acts depicted in video games. I feel as if a parent should know if thier kid is mature enough to play them before (1/2)
967223211506139136 2018-02-23 02:22:38 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @RY2066 I am a gamer myself. I enjoy playing them when college gives me free time. Just note that children in other countries play these games too, and they dont have these problems. (Not that i advocate for children to play these violent games, thats their parents decision, not mine)2/2
967222389170991105 2018-02-23 02:19:22 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @RY2066 While i personally dont believe that there is a correlation, i would like to see more research on the topic.

967181450373148673 2018-02-23 23:36:41 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @FBI @davidhogg111 @JobTrendr And i do agree that those are some ideas that would be a great start. And i dont want to ban sport rifles. While i dont agree that an AR-15 is a sport rifle, i do want it to be more difficult to get a firearm in general.
967180681213247489 2018-02-23 23:33:38 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @FBI @davidhogg111 @JobTrendr The issue is that our politicians dont like to act without the data, and the dickey amendment blocks just that. I want research to be done before we act. If they were allowed to do research beforehand, we would have an idea as to what to look for in these potential killers.
967165191531126785 2018-02-23 22:32:05 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @Angelbowranch The CDC should be able to research ANY health hazard to Americans. I have no problem with them researching brain disease. I have a problem with them not being able to research gun violence.
967164533994385410 2018-02-23 22:29:28 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @M__Walker Your other tweet attackes him by calling him an idiot. Am i wrong?

You are saying that Guns are not a public health hazard. So if someone shot a gun at me, (the main use for guns is shooting them) would my health not be at risk? Your analogy doesnt work.
967161199568871426 2018-02-23 22:16:13 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @davidhogg111 @ErukaMoseley How does your stance on abortion have anything to do with a stance on gun control? I am Pro life, however i also want tighter gun laws and stronger backround checks.
967159542017642496 2018-02-23 22:09:38 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @M__Walker Sorry that you have to attack me for a typo, my friend. You are just proving my point. Keep doing it.
967158943687602178 2018-02-23 22:07:15 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @RY2066 Lets talk about the video games arguement. They have been many studies that have determined that there is no correlation between playing violent video games and actually doing something violent. I dont understand why we place blame on video games but not movies and TV.
967157932579344384 2018-02-23 22:03:14 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @ShannCohrs Did it ever occur to tou that mentally ill people tend to not make it easy to tell that they are? I dont know how he would have blood on his hands, if he was the one attacked.
967157334756773888 2018-02-23 22:00:52 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @davidhogg111 @jordan_serena They are both to blame, just look at the Dickey Amendment.

967156834229514242 2018-02-23 21:58:52 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @Roxiepurgatory But the NRA does put money into those legislator's pockets to influence them. Just look at @marcorubio
967156196795977728 2018-02-23 21:56:20 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @Trumpapedia I dont think ive seen anyone talking about how Planned Parenthood is in any way better than the NRA. However while the NRA does not recieve tax dollars, what it does have is influence. Enough influence to, i dont know, ban the CDC from researching gun violence? (Dickey amendment)
967154737853419521 2018-02-23 21:50:33 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @NYCMemphis Get a clue, They actually do promote laws by lining the pockets of the politicians so that they act in the NRAs best interest. Why dont you look into the Dickey Amendment?
967153959273189382 2018-02-23 21:47:27 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA @FBI @davidhogg111 @JobTrendr Dont worry, they are both to blame for this. The Dickey Amendment is something that we can blame the NRA for. Something that also may have caused this not to happen.
967153033414144001 2018-02-23 21:43:46 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @billh07882 Orr... Maybe the NRA has been lining the pockets of the Congressmen/women so that they wont correct this.
967151917091753988 2018-02-23 21:39:20 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @Angelbowranch Explain to me the Dickey Amendment. The CDC cannot do any research on gun violence because of it. And guess who supported it? The NRA. Its time to stop.
967150980801449985 2018-02-23 21:35:37 UTC <nicky8009> @davidhogg111 @HokieMBA00 So standing up for what you believe in makes you a douchebag? Too bad he doesnt want killers taking a shot at him or other students.

966944530963431425 2018-02-22 07:55:15 UTC <nicky8009> @NRA See ther problem there is something called the Dickey amendment. Something you supported that blocks the cdc from doing research on gun violence. I say we get some research done first. Heres a suggestion: If you want better research, you might want to do something about it.
966824128450834433 2018-02-22 23:56:49 UTC <nicky8009> @SenSanders @MJavedNaseem2 So if you could not pay taxes one year you would still send over cash? If the new tax codes allow them not have send over cash LEGALLY, i dont see the problem. Attack those who make the tax codes, not the people benefitting.
966750155474128896 2018-02-22 19:02:53 UTC <nicky8009> @realDonaldTrump Please push to repeal the Dickey Amendment. No one in congress is going to do anything without research. And that blocks the CDC from doing any of it.
966749426650935303 2018-02-22 18:59:59 UTC <nicky8009> @realDonaldTrump @Annakhait @GaitherBrad @RealCTPARLIONAS @tilly_rachal @skylerguns @wasp74820 @rockrapunzel Yes, however there are limitations. For example you cant scream fire in a crowded place without there being a fire.
966553843441029120 2018-02-21 06:02:48 UTC <nicky8009> @CNN @LeighLeonards We can only hope.
966547759250714624 2018-02-21 05:38:38 UTC <nicky8009> @CNN @LeighLeonards While the NRA did not pull the trigger, they do deserve some blame for this. The Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC from doing any research on gun based violence. And guess who pushed for this amendment. The NRA. The first step is to repeal this. Then we can go from there.
966544719147872257 2018-02-21 05:26:33 UTC <nicky8009> @CNN @LeighLeonards Sometimes you have to fight for what you believe him. He is tired of nothing being done to stop this. You are missing the entire point.
966541820313382912 2018-02-21 05:15:02 UTC <nicky8009> @FBI @FoxNews @cbreiner24 For your information, i do want more gun laws. However, i am not pro-choice. And please tell me of someone who is pro illegal immigration. He should have never had access to a gun in the first place. Times are chaning my friend.
966489017566056448 2018-02-21 01:45:12 UTC <nicky8009> @realDonaldTrump Now actually do something about it.

966351602780131329 2018-02-21 16:39:10 UTC <nicky8009> @REALtrumpbureau @DineshDSouza @MindfulnessWins See the problem is. They want the right not to be shot at for children in school. (Or while they are working even) and guess what? If they get shot at, and killed, they are gonna lose those rights anyway.
966350436667215872 2018-02-21 16:34:32 UTC <nicky8009> @DineshDSouza @therealdaveism @paakahh The arguement is that it needs tighter restrictions.
966191306342109184 2018-02-20 06:02:13 UTC <nicky8009> @BillOReilly @shannd63 1. Every generation has their insanely stupid trends. And guess what? Id venture to say that is a very small part of the generation. 2. Eventually "the generation that eats tide pods" will have a say. 3. You should really look into what an ad hominem attack is.

And the parents should have them in a safe anyway, with ammo in a seperate one. 4) i feel as if you are doing the opposite of what you are advocating with the passive agressive attitude here. (2/2)
966127328437964800 2018-02-20 01:47:59 UTC <nicky8009> @ABC @mk7don How about this?  1.) Bullying is going to exist no matter what. And its not all that easy to point out someone with mental issues. (Not advocating bullying) 2.) Cant argue with that point. Except that im sure that not as many do that as you think (1/2)
966101952584183809 2018-02-20 00:07:09 UTC <nicky8009> @KamVTV It actually is pretty interesting. I'd argue that it's even inspiring. They see a need for change and they aren't going to stop until it happens.
966101530679050240 2018-02-20 00:05:28 UTC <nicky8009> @KamVTV This is the most disgusting tweet ive seen on the internet in a long time. And i follow our president. We should be proud of them for trying to make a change, because we sure as hell know that anyone currently in office isnt going to do it.

And inviting people is much more complicated. And the fact that you have to fight with games from there to get them to launch every single time.(i bought ark survival evolved on xbox before i got a pc, thats how i know)

I do prefer the songs with a guitar involved, but if people want it transcribed to guitar, why not? Music is Music. Thank you for discussing this in a mature matter. You dont see this too often on the internet.
961357389361565698 2018-02-07 21:53:57 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyTheGame @ravingdragoon @lhypnotized_ It was in one of the this week at bungie blogs
961343116258217984 2018-02-07 20:57:14 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyTheGame @1dillywilly1 Its a meme at this point. Its not gonna stop. This is a step in the right direction.

961341935796609025 2018-02-07 20:52:33 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyTheGame @lunar_jayden If they did that people would complain even more. "Oh they didnt even bother to reskin the content this time?" Its a step in the right direction for these to be earned through gameplay.
961341115961049089 2018-02-07 20:49:17 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyTheGame @mssd7m Your poll has 2 questions for anwsers. Doesnt make any sense.
961340517387730944 2018-02-07 20:46:54 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyTheGame @Awesome_M10 Then go play overwatch? Dont understand why you need to announce that.
961335237115547649 2018-02-07 20:25:55 UTC <nicky8009> @ladygaga @Rocksmithgame @thomas_cawston I dont see why they wouldnt put the music in. The goal is to have a diverse music library, and adding this makes the library more diverse.
961334916343623680 2018-02-07 20:24:39 UTC <nicky8009> @ladygaga @Rocksmithgame @thomas_cawston Because one song pack is really gonna make someone pick up the game. People are gonna buy the game if they want to learn guitar. While there may have not been as many requests for Lady Gaga as Megadeth, there were still requests for it. So if the RS team could get Gaga (1/2)
961299081611173890 2018-02-07 18:02:15 UTC <nicky8009> @A_dmg04 Good job. This was needed.
961286710545043456 2018-02-07 17:13:06 UTC <nicky8009> @ladygaga @Rocksmithgame @thomas_cawston Would you prefer having to buy a new game every year to get 30 random songs? Its about learning how to play music, and if people want to play this on their guitars, then so be it.
961286258306756609 2018-02-07 17:11:18 UTC <nicky8009> @ladygaga @Rocksmithgame @thomas_cawston Guess what? People actually requested this! I know its hard to believe. Im not a fan either, so guess what i am doing. Not buying it. Its as simple as that. Dont like it, dont buy it. Im happy that the people who wanted the pack got  it.
961113391485071360 2018-02-06 05:44:23 UTC <nicky8009> @PlayStation @Rocksmithgame @TheMonsterNoah @MuteParallax Thats up to microsoft. Keep your eye on the Humble Bundle. Id highly recomend buying it on steam if possible. Steam sales are great for stocking up on DLC.
961112756039618560 2018-02-06 05:41:52 UTC <nicky8009> @Rocksmithgame @RaptorRider193 Sadly youd need to write your strongly worded letter to physics. Data transfer is just not fast enough. Any latency would be really awkward while playing with others.

I have an unpopular opinion about this, but i dont think the community was very good at communicating until recently either. While they have to lead the communication, we arent perfect either.

958896236223922176 2018-01-31 02:54:12 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @Extremlzm @juberto_ I never said that it was handled well. And its a shame that you cannot talk to me like a human being. Im was just giving reasons as to why it is taking a long time. I'd love to continue to discuss this with you once you learn to talk to people. Enjoy your day
958848251339464704 2018-01-31 23:43:32 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @Extremlzm After that, they need to test it. Then, in this case, they need to coordinate with Sony, Microsoft, ect. To update their product. After they are able to update the product, you Finally see it on your console.
958847663864152065 2018-01-31 23:41:12 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @Extremlzm Lets talk about how large companies work. First, someone has an idea for a product/service ect. Second, they need to flesh out the idea. Third, they need to get green lights from many higher ups before any other work is done with the idea. Next, they need to actually make it

958796788231745538 2018-01-31 20:19:02 UTC <nicky8009> @BungieHelp @WestCoastTyrant My understanding of this, which i could be wrong, is that it was just displaying the wrong number. I think you were getting the correct amount of points the entire time. Again, could be wrong.
958795683380817921 2018-01-31 20:14:39 UTC <nicky8009> @BungieHelp @CTD_SLIM @DjDATZ @Bloo_Ba Open your eyes. All software developers have this problem.
958795201493028864 2018-01-31 20:12:44 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @mjmanross79 @JohnJohn_pat Yes, but do you really want artists and writers coding the game? Let me explain this. You are at work, and your coworker stops working. Does that mean you should stop working? No. You continue doing your job. The artists and writers were hired to make the story, not code the game
958792428441489409 2018-01-31 20:01:43 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @mjmanross79 Starting off by saying "Not trying to be a dick, ..." Automatically makes you one. Theres multiple teams at any company. Some make merchandise, some do PR, some manage, and so on.
958546183856754688 2018-01-30 03:43:13 UTC <nicky8009> @BungieHelp @the_gloworm Im gonna make the mistake of talking to you like a human being. While testing is done before a patch is released, they will NEVER find everything. They cannot emulate the number of people who will find bugs. Its just that simple They can change one thing, and it can break another
958197002659139584 2018-01-29 04:35:42 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @TheCryptarch @ImOnlyRavenV2 Id bet that youd not want to see threats on your personal social media accounts daily. Its not ok to do this
958196712983662593 2018-01-29 04:34:33 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @TheCryptarch @ipwn_starr So theatening people is okay because of that? Sorry but its not. Grow up.
958195870163460096 2018-01-29 04:31:12 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @MrAwesome495 They dont owe you a refund, you payed for the game, and you got the game. Go find something better to do with your free time. I hear monster hunter is great.
958195339160444930 2018-01-29 04:29:05 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @FearEliteAce That will never happen. While i agree that bungie made some questionable changes, They need to pay the bills. Unless you want everything locked by a paywall, in a free to play format. And honestly, you paid for the game, and you got the game. They owe us one more DLC, thats it.
958194116571156485 2018-01-29 04:24:14 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @Dbuckfan @CL0UDS1972 May I suggest trying to expand your vocabulary if you struggle to find a better way to say that? Maybe use the time that your using to make worthless comments on a bungie post? Come back when you have something constructive to say.
958193306911039488 2018-01-29 04:21:01 UTC <nicky8009> @Bungie @orngoak54 You do realise their goal, as with any other company, is to make a profit. And if they dont work to make the game better, their sales for their next game, destiny or not, will go down. This is the kind of comment that is a waste of everyones time.
958167880943788032 2018-01-29 02:39:59 UTC <nicky8009> @damour007 @the_HogDragger let me give you an example, saying "you f*cking stole my money" and "fix your sh*t game" dont help in any way. Saying that you need to feel more rewarded for completing the high lever activites are two different things.
958167395486625792 2018-01-29 02:38:03 UTC <nicky8009> @damour007 @the_HogDragger You dont seem to understand. The uproar slowed the progress down if anything. Ive seen people threatening Bungie employees. On their personal twitters. The constructive criticism that has been given from the disappointingly small part of this community has done more.
958150148093370368 2018-01-29 01:29:31 UTC <nicky8009> @damour007 @the_HogDragger Theres a difference between positive constructive criticism, and negativity. The negativity gets you nowhere. So yes, we would still be getting these changes.

954258814487924736 2018-01-18 07:46:45 UTC <nicky8009> @erichirshberg @Activision @changa_chimmi No. They will still be here. Dont worry. Its not like he has the end all decision on whether or not they are in games.
951906908109201408 2018-01-12 20:01:07 UTC <nicky8009> @DeeJ_BNG @trhl4589 It was a design decision, not a limitation.
951906405270917122 2018-01-12 19:59:07 UTC <nicky8009> @DeeJ_BNG @LightUpMySenses Then tell me this, why do you care? If you moved on, then go. They made a mistake, and now are taking the steps to fix the mistake. Youve gotta give them credit for even acknowledging it. Most would just ignore it entirely and move on.
951905514644037632 2018-01-12 19:55:34 UTC <nicky8009> @MyNameIsByf @sjostern10 Yes. The features are not there, and they are putting them there. Simple as that. It is a step forward from where we are now.
951905149622083589 2018-01-12 19:54:07 UTC <nicky8009> @MyNameIsByf @DystopianSnowmn @Absolu1eZero They will probably stay closer to the original because they see what bungie did with d2. They arent blind, they knlw whats happening.
951904475484229632 2018-01-12 19:51:27 UTC <nicky8009> @MyNameIsByf @sebguts10 I feel like we all need to get into that mindset sooner rather than later. But i dont think most will be able to get into that mindset sadly. I totally agree with you
951903426019020801 2018-01-12 19:47:16 UTC <nicky8009> @MyNameIsByf @reclusivedrag0n @G__Willikers Its not as simple as copy pasting it.
951760496948137984 2018-01-12 10:19:19 UTC <nicky8009> @DestinyNews_net @yatz00 Surprisingly difficult for a large company. Changes need to go by multiple green lights before they are even worked on. And changes take time.
946843173342638081 2017-12-29 20:39:38 UTC <nicky8009> @Gothalion @javersteeg You said you wanted tbe bundle, so i pointed out the bundle. No need to call me stupid.
946828267914489857 2017-12-29 19:40:24 UTC <nicky8009> @Gothalion @javersteeg They already did, has been bundled since the game came out. Its the season pass.
944995416017391616 2017-12-24 18:17:19 UTC <nicky8009> @cgbarrett @Gothalion @RelaxedVictim @owzley They have families. You arent looking at the big picture. I was stating the fact that it isnt realistic to expect it to disappear, unless some legal regulation happens. It just wont happen, because people will spend money on microtransactions. Its proved lucrative in the past.
944648421088137219 2017-12-23 19:18:28 UTC <nicky8009> @cgbarrett @Gothalion @RelaxedVictim Not that im a fan of microtransactions, but removing them outright just isnt realistic for most games. These companies need to attract employees, and thats where some of the funds go. And if those employees find a better job, working for a different game, they are going to do it.
