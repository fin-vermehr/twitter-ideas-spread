964976771924922368 2018-02-17 21:36:05 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @HamlerPearlene Hi Mom!  Are you following me yet??? How are you?  Hope you're doing okay and staying strong.  I love you!!  Hope you're ready to switch to the other side now that the indictments are making it clear that your guy has been lying about the Russians all this time!!!

964534950157586432 2018-02-16 16:20:26 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> Even worse, he is denying the threat even exists. This is an alarming dereliction of duty. This is a betrayal of the oath of office he swore to uphold. This is treasonous behavior and grounds for impeachment.https://twitter.com/kurtbardella/status/964521410826788867
964529085979426821 2018-02-16 15:57:08 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @decider @MichTomeo Yes he got emotional again, as most of us did when confronted with the pain, suffering and loss those children and families are experiencing. I would expect someone who works with vulnerable children & families to exhibit the same sensitivity and empathy.
964525041638629379 2018-02-16 15:41:04 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @decider @FemiAbodunde The GOP have sold themselves out to the NRA and are not looking out for our children or countrys best interests. Democrats, independents and republicans of goodwill stand with the people against the NRA.

963521785160495105 2018-02-13 21:14:29 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @HamlerPearlene Hardly.  Its  not Comey, Lynch, Holder, Obamas or even HRCs fault that Trump and the people around him are so badly compromised by Russia!  ;)  Christopher Steele is more of a friend to the US than Trump and his cronies!
963520518866505728 2018-02-13 21:09:27 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @HamlerPearlene This conspiracy theory is fake news.  In fact, the FISA warrant for Carter Page was LEGAL.  FISA warrants can be requested to monitor U.S. citizens believed to be acting on behalf of a foreign power - i.e., Carter Page since 2013.  http://theconversation.com/3-questions-about-the-fisa-court-answered-91208https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/02/who-is-carter-page-trump-ex-adviser-memo-furore-russia-fbi
963455229072158720 2018-02-13 16:50:01 UTC <HarmoniousLivn> @HamlerPearlene Actually, no - most Americans want Mueller to complete his investigation and report their findings.  And they want Congress to step up, be a co-equal branch of government and hold this president accountable.
