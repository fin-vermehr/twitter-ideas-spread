971548209343582208 2018-03-07 00:48:38 UTC <Cluw_girl> @ProgressOutlook @T2inDC Yes sadly they get sucked in and are constantly angry at the fake outrages cooked up by Fox
971537406573842432 2018-03-07 00:05:42 UTC <Cluw_girl> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @sksnky @watch4democracy @Lovesbaking63 I am so sorry.
971210286349811713 2018-03-06 02:25:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> @kylegriffin1 Canada should be exempted as a trading and intelligence partner
971209995508502528 2018-03-06 02:24:41 UTC <Cluw_girl> @kylegriffin1 In 2017 alone steel imports increased by as much as 25 percent since the president announced the 232 studies. Aluminum imports hit an all time high in 2017. Are we supposed to rely on Russian and Chinese steel?  There is a difference between trade wars and trade fairness
971209150486188032 2018-03-06 02:21:20 UTC <Cluw_girl> @kylegriffin1 I find it amazing that somehow the steel used in tanks and planes and ships isnt national security issue. The domestic steel industry has seen 10 blast furnaces shut down and 64000 jobs disappear due to unfair trade since 2000
970873745090007041 2018-03-05 04:08:33 UTC <Cluw_girl> @thehill @balignum @jimmy_tho Lets not forget that they are being told constantly by conservative news that it was only because of environmental regs that coal declined.  If someone tells you look like Elvis 50 times a day at some point you might believe it
969688929388695552 2018-03-02 21:40:31 UTC <Cluw_girl> @NBCNews @FoxNews @RiskyLiberal As much as it pains me to agree, why is there no background or commentary about other countries putting tariffs on? Or that if our steel plants are shut down we will have to buy steel for military tanks, planes or ships from a foreign,possibly enemy country?
969668892066045952 2018-03-02 20:20:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MonsterMarcia @SenBennetCO @democratmo @OnlyRealFred Chinese production far exceeds Chinese domestic demand. Steel is crucial for the defense industry think, ships, tanks, planes, submarines. Do we want to depend on another countries steel by shutting down our capacity? Especially when our industries have been targeted?
969666452281229312 2018-03-02 20:11:12 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MonsterMarcia @SenBennetCO @democratmo @OnlyRealFred China is worlds largest producer of steel. What they produce far exceeds demand.  raw materials & utilities are subsidized by the Chinese government plus they get tax breaks. They also peg their currency to U.s $ which allows them to dump below cost. EU has put tariffs on too.
969647923003842560 2018-03-02 18:57:34 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MonsterMarcia @SenBennetCO @democratmo As for oversupply what about a country building plants to make oil country tubular goods when they cant use a single foot of in their country?
969630502868135936 2018-03-02 17:48:21 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MonsterMarcia @SenBennetCO @democratmo Overproduction has been an issue for years. China has a huge overcapacity in Steel and aluminum. Their industries receive support from the government so they dump steel at below the cost to produce it. They peg their currency to give them advantage.
969627791376506880 2018-03-02 17:37:34 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SpudLovr @UrbanMilwaukee Would you have us reliant on China for everything? Money to support our huge deficits, steel and aluminum. This is just like what Wal-mart does coming into town. Destroy the competition and raise prices
969627170506190849 2018-03-02 17:35:06 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SpudLovr @UrbanMilwaukee These tariffs are being levied because other countries are dumping steel and aluminum below the cost to make it and destroy American firms. This is a national defense issue because steel and aluminum go into the military defense as well
963925426933583872 2018-02-14 23:58:25 UTC <Cluw_girl> My heart goes out to the parents and families in the FL high school shooting. Yet another shooting with an AR-15.  Why are these legal again? Its not for hunting unless you want to kill the herd.
963803950813196290 2018-02-14 15:55:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenFeinstein @ChrisJZullo Also there is a big budget cut at the Labor Department which keeps employers from stealing from their workers. Obamas DOL recovered millions a year in stolen wages for workers. But if you refuse to enforce the law you dont need to investigate
963802131009622016 2018-02-14 15:48:29 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenFeinstein @BadProductionz CEOs make roughly 400x the average worker in the United States. Just saying. The ratio is much lower in other countries.
963801116495446016 2018-02-14 15:44:27 UTC <Cluw_girl> @harveyjkaye Thanks!
963678519996887041 2018-02-13 07:37:18 UTC <Cluw_girl> So you lose health insurance if not working or disabled & budget cuts SS budget so backlog of disability cases grows and #TrumpBudget
963561722127806465 2018-02-13 23:53:11 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MxSba wouldnt it be nice to know how much these folks are offering in pay -in comparison to previous years pay? Companies in the U.S complain about a lack of skilled workers in housing yet few articles point out they are offering lower pay now than before the Great Recession.
962721106066059264 2018-02-11 16:12:52 UTC <Cluw_girl> Its  totally Ok to let folks without a security clearance read classified information. Not being careless with classified information or jeopardizing national security. How does this double standard thing work?
961922222133796864 2018-02-09 11:18:24 UTC <Cluw_girl> @RepThomasMassie @justinamash @RandPaul Yeah you voted to add over a trillion dollars to the deficit by giving the wealthy and business huge tax breaks and after having screwed over the little guy claim you are fiscally responsible
961785556098314240 2018-02-08 02:15:20 UTC <Cluw_girl> @NBCNightlyNews @NBCNews @kumailn @T2inDC Where are the patriots in the Republican Party?
961561448219541505 2018-02-08 11:24:48 UTC <Cluw_girl> @ricardorossello @DavidBegnaud Looking at OH charter school bankruptcy, why would you want to?
961558586060046336 2018-02-08 11:13:26 UTC <Cluw_girl> @BethBourgeois @VABVOX @saltyconchy Is there a patient assistance program available to help? You might be able to get help through drug maker or a program for people with a particular condition. I believe the GoodRX app might help with these
961555892167692288 2018-02-08 11:02:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> @realDonaldTrump @realMatMolina How about spending money on homeless vets instead of a parade?
960736848611102720 2018-02-05 04:48:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MartinHeinrich @curmudgeon_girl @dpm327469 Both employer and employee pay. The U.S. is the only industrialized country with zero weeks of paid leave. Its a competitive advantage to have paid leave because fewer trained employees leave. Families are healthier as a result
960734370771427329 2018-02-05 04:38:18 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenTinaSmith @runyan50 Its not pie. We can do both.
960733493134266368 2018-02-05 04:34:48 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenateDems @PattyMurray @JGotti79 Wow except the majority of other countries have paid family leave of some sort when the U.S has zero weeks. There are three countries that dont. We are one. We are competing against Papua New Guinea?? Not having it is a competitive disadvantage...
960730615661367297 2018-02-05 04:23:22 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenFeinstein @bud48314887 California and NJ have state insurance plans that cost employer and employee very little.  It costs money to recruit and train new employees up to 25% of annual salary. State plans make it affordable for smaller businesses and employers win by retaining trained employees
960729534290186240 2018-02-05 04:19:05 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenFeinstein @ak49conservativ This is precisely why states such as California and NJ have state insurance to lower the costs to employer and make it possible for businesses to retain trained employees rather than have them quit. It costs as much as 25% or more of annual salary to replace an employee.
960728274937753600 2018-02-05 04:14:04 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenFeinstein @lcbchefperry Fortunately the rest of the world does not agree. They actually value families and their employees.  It costs less to offer leave than to replace trained employees. Its not welfare its retention
958658439437221888 2018-01-31 11:09:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> @krassenstein They ignore anything reported because its fake or biased. Many believe what their church tells them or just because you are support abortion restrictions you are automatically a good person
953258231270400000 2018-01-16 13:30:47 UTC <Cluw_girl> ,the principle of impeachment assumes we have have people of integrity willing to uphold the good of the nation over their own partisan ideals.
952174101086515200 2018-01-13 13:42:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @kurteichenwald @ultipatriarch So where were you folks when I was forced to buy car insurance for my car years ago? Folks wanted bigger risk pools to make the costs lower.  What is a bigger risk pool than the whole country?  Having been hit by uninsured driver I dont mind at all. Just regulate them heavily.
950515154483019776 2018-01-08 23:50:47 UTC <Cluw_girl> Why does a conservative putting families first seem to mean no increases to minimum wage, no paid sick days to care for yourself and family, no paid maternity leave  or paid family leave to heal and bond with your child
949595211965091840 2018-01-06 10:55:15 UTC <Cluw_girl> @kurteichenwald Those were negotiated by the union Long in advance of tax bill.we pay more for mobile phone service and internet than the rest of the world and I cant get fast internet unless go to cable
949533141290635269 2018-01-05 06:48:37 UTC <Cluw_girl> @thedailybeast So which male potential candidate or congressional rep would you have made the same comments about in the same tone? None I believe
949215895494283264 2018-01-05 09:47:59 UTC <Cluw_girl> @jilevin We are only industrialized nation without mandated paid maternity leave. No mandated paid vacation or paid sick leave. Our love of corporations means workers aren't treated fairly. We talk family values but really don't value families at all. That leads to #1 status
947992076288962560 2018-01-01 00:44:58 UTC <Cluw_girl> So where was the upset when Ken Starr appointed conservative prosecutors? And if the FBI was so tilted towards Clinton why did Comey tell the country days before the election that Clinton was under investigation but not Trump? It was so bad that Congresss was briefed?
943471116395433984 2017-12-20 13:20:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> The tax bill will send jobs overseas but the extremists in Congress who rewrote the tax code to enrich themselves and their donors are hoping voters are too stupid to figure out
943293804047749120 2017-12-19 01:35:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenateMajLdr So tell me how 9 million children without health insurance isnt more important than a tax bill that the majority of Americans dont want and passed in dead of night without public hearings.
943291134931095552 2017-12-19 01:25:06 UTC <Cluw_girl> @ProgressOutlook @rey_lowe The Dems dont have cutting Medicare, cutting Social Security and repealing health care on their 2018 agenda.  Nor are they denying health care to sick children with their failure to reauthorize the Childrens Health insurance program.
943288814369374208 2017-12-19 01:15:53 UTC <Cluw_girl> @PoliticalShort Considering that half of America hates this bill and had it shoved down their throat so the White House could give itself a whopping big Christmas present, I would be worrying about the 2018 elections. Not to mention the mood of the country after the bald faced lies about bill.
943285067622834176 2017-12-19 01:01:00 UTC <Cluw_girl> @AriFleischer Pity the poor millionaires and billionaires they really need the private jet deduction and golf course deduction so seniors cant pay skyrocketing medical bills and no one else can afford health care. Give me a break.
943283530309791751 2017-12-19 00:54:53 UTC <Cluw_girl> @RepSwalwell Better yet lets raise the minimum wage and the tipped workers wage which hasnt been raised in 25 years  so corporations have some place to put those record profits an
943283108501250048 2017-12-19 00:53:13 UTC <Cluw_girl> @RepSwalwell Why not fund health care for little kids, infrastructure and invest in people? Our effective tax rates werent out of line. Why not close those Cayman Island loopholes?
943282338242416640 2017-12-19 00:50:09 UTC <Cluw_girl> @robinhobb All I know is according to my spam, everything I have is too small, male or female. Makes you wonder why the hot Russian chicks want me or the pornographic folks who apparently have problems finding partners.
942829734463000577 2017-12-18 18:51:40 UTC <Cluw_girl> If u are worried about opioid crisis, you should call your congressperson to vote against the #GOPTAXScam bill now! In spite of dire report on crisis, no more money has been allocated for treatment or Help and the #GOP plans cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that provide treatment.
942745051741999104 2017-12-18 13:15:10 UTC <Cluw_girl> The #GOPTaxscam cuts taxes for corporations and wealthy while forcing a #Medicare cuts. Why are the elderly and disabled paying for #GOPTaxScam
942737343328477185 2017-12-18 12:44:32 UTC <Cluw_girl> It a time of record profits wages are increasing slowly but the stock market is setting records. Record profits going to shareholders not wages. Yet  @GOP says that the #GOPTaxScam will change this and not overheat market more
942736321126256640 2017-12-18 12:40:28 UTC <Cluw_girl> Dear @GOP the Chinese own most of our debt. They are shutting down our steel industry which is a national security issue and you have done nothing about it. Now you want them to buy more debt with #GOPTaxScam?
941321850327531521 2017-12-14 14:59:52 UTC <Cluw_girl> @mitchellvii @ms_holstein @FeysPerson @sky11star1 Thats completely untrue. My mother in law was born at home never had a birth certificate. She was in senior citizens housing. Shed been living in same small town for years. Clerks at bank knew her.
941120407847006213 2017-12-13 01:39:25 UTC <Cluw_girl> @pnuts_mama @MarisaKabas Only if it were a Democrat ....
940304610119634944 2017-12-11 19:37:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> So how many ways can @GOP kill you. No orphan drug tax credit, no medical expense deduction, raising insurance prices through various actions #GOPTaxScam
938721065039224832 2017-12-07 10:45:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> @clairecmc Can we at least investigate before resignation? The allegations against Moore and Trump are well sourced these do not appear to be.
937488713675886592 2017-12-03 01:08:21 UTC <Cluw_girl> When you think Alaskas senator might be interested in protecting the Alaska wilderness not destroying it. @lisamurkowski #GOPTaxScam
936964596266651648 2017-12-02 14:25:42 UTC <Cluw_girl> So we have the best Congress money can buy and now the donor class can afford to buy more politicians. #GOPTaxScam
936773315556810753 2017-12-01 01:45:37 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenBobCasey @mattwhouse Im glad to know that the fiscally irresponsible Lying #GOP is in such a hurry to wreck this country and send my job overseas.
936742416945766400 2017-12-01 23:42:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenatorCollins The CEOs already said it will just go to buy back stock. Why are you lying to us? What about grad students and the disabled. I believed you had an ounce of integrity. I was wrong. #GOPtaxscam
936740031875731456 2017-12-01 23:33:22 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenatorCollins And you believed the men that will let children go without health care and let folks in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico die?  I used to believe that you felt some sort of responsibility towards your constituents instead this is a CYA move.
936519050422882304 2017-12-01 08:55:15 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenJohnMcCain You and the rest of the deficit hating @GOP are hugely increasing the deficit and rushing this through apparently so terrified of Trump that youll do anything #GOPTaxBill
932345583041437696 2017-11-19 20:31:23 UTC <Cluw_girl> #GOPTaxScam requires that graduate students pay taxes on waived out of state tuition among other things while retaining private jet exempt
931977212621926400 2017-11-18 20:07:37 UTC <Cluw_girl> @RVAwonk How about discussing his values and plans to help folks not Im not Roy Moore
931255516914954240 2017-11-16 20:19:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> The evidence clearly shows #PaidSickDays laws benefit workers, businesses, our economy, & public health. #ProtectSickDays
931255013455867905 2017-11-16 20:17:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> Coalitions have secured #PaidSICKDays laws from coast to coast. We must stand strong against efforts to undermine them! #ProtectSickDays
931254261618495488 2017-11-16 20:14:52 UTC <Cluw_girl> No working parent should have to choose between taking care of a child with the flu and keeping a job. #ProtectSickDays
931253934416646144 2017-11-16 20:13:34 UTC <Cluw_girl> Real #PaidSickDays laws benefit workers,families,employers, & public health.Fake flex bill will benefit only big biz. #ProtectSickDays
931253401966571520 2017-11-16 20:11:27 UTC <Cluw_girl> Fact: @RepMimiWalters fake flex bill, HR4219, would make work less flexible and paid time to care less available http://bit.ly/2IXapAT #ProtectSickDays #PaidSICKDays
930797518019006464 2017-11-15 13:59:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> #GOPTaxBill when #taxreform means pick the pockets of the #MiddleClass so the #GOPDonorClass can get their political donations back
930793674283388928 2017-11-15 13:44:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> So with #recordprofits, many corporations paying #Notaxes, offshoring profits and taking manufacturing overseas the #GOPTaxBill drastically lowers corporate tax rates while raising taxes for #MiddleClass
930557560855425024 2017-11-14 22:06:26 UTC <Cluw_girl> @TRACKSTARTER Small business owners should be angry with the scam they are running. #Delawaretax hurts small business
930556740952821760 2017-11-14 22:03:10 UTC <Cluw_girl> As a PA taxpayer, Mike Turzai running for governor should strike fear into your heart. After all he singlehandly lowered the PA credit rating by refusing to raise taxes. This means we need more taxes to pay for interest. Who knows what he could do as Gov?
930549299775188992 2017-11-14 21:33:36 UTC <Cluw_girl> Mike Turzai, the man singlehandly responsible for lowering the pa credit rating i is running for governor, so he can wreck our economy even more
929357449924104192 2017-11-11 14:37:37 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rebeccavallas @dbongino There are areas where health care premiums have gone up. It depends on many factors like the number of insurers. Recent actions by the administration have increased uncertainty therefore risk and premiums.
928422993155510272 2017-11-08 00:44:25 UTC <Cluw_girl> @TuesdaysToomey @mattyglesias Oh, you mean like how they were supposed to be allowed a higher rate to put fast internet everywhere in  PA? ROFL
928218995328774151 2017-11-08 11:13:48 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JeffRicksDude Im so sorry. I cannot begin to imagine what you are going through.
927500976717692928 2017-11-06 11:40:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> Wouldnt this be a good time for extreme vetting of assault rifles?
927500026254970880 2017-11-06 11:36:53 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SpeakerRyan Try banning assault weapons again!
927337590289727488 2017-11-05 00:51:25 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SpeakerRyan Maybe try banning AR-15s or maybe extreme vetting of white males with guns
926079516212191232 2017-11-02 13:32:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> The anti consumer congress has denied consumers the right to file class action lawsuits against widespread financial fraud by big banks

924305881491263488 2017-10-28 16:04:29 UTC <Cluw_girl> A small child who just had surgery is not a threat to national security and should not be separated from Drs, family and deported
924302971122409475 2017-10-28 15:52:55 UTC <Cluw_girl> When John Kelly talked about valuing women was it b4 the religious right supported a thrice married man bragging about grabbing women?
924301454185246720 2017-10-28 15:46:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> So when John Kelly talked about valuing women did he mean before we elected men public ally bragging about assaulting them President.
924300526400999425 2017-10-28 15:43:12 UTC <Cluw_girl> So if there were no irregularities in the GA elections why would you wipe a server clean up the day after lawsuit was filed requesting data

914195268207284225 2017-09-30 18:28:31 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JeremyKonyndyk @WatchingIslam Which has is why the three star general in charge said they need manpower and supplies. The damage is so bad they need more people.

914137709987422209 2017-09-30 14:39:48 UTC <Cluw_girl> @nypost @tinagolden71165 @loucitmyway Hmm when general in charge says not enough men or supplies, he must be wrong.

849484421757579264 2017-04-04 04:50:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> @CNN @MeytarDr those pictures of Ivanka vacationing with Putin's girlfriend.and Russian connections of appointees. Trail of dead Russians

849347321397694464 2017-04-04 19:45:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> @gutito21 Yep.https://thinkprogress.org/charlize-theron-negotiates-10m-raise-after-sony-hack-reveals-male-costar-was-to-be-paid-millions-905ab69c11a7
849331911881363456 2017-04-04 18:44:42 UTC <Cluw_girl> In 13 states, Latina women would have to work past 100 to make up losses from the lifetime wage gap http://bit.ly/1MObeTF #EqualPayDay
849331332174020608 2017-04-04 18:42:24 UTC <Cluw_girl> We can't talk about #BlackWomenEqual Pay without talking about #BlackLivesMatter. Racism is a systemic issue. #EqualPayDay
849330901720989701 2017-04-04 18:40:41 UTC <Cluw_girl> It's 2017 and U.S. women who work full time are still paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to men. #wagegap #EqualPayDay
845998189727617024 2017-03-26 13:57:40 UTC <Cluw_girl> @nancaroling We had a rally yesterday with planned parenthood speaker and many others on ACA, Gorsuch, state bills etc
844759608170168320 2017-03-22 03:56:00 UTC <Cluw_girl> @nancaroling Met with legislative aides last week in D.C. Used to go to meetings with my rep at home but he hasn't had open ones for a while
844383300118597632 2017-03-21 03:00:41 UTC <Cluw_girl> @TeenVogue @nancaroling How many times have you called and met with legislators?
841726460998090755 2017-03-14 19:03:21 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@SenBobCasey please remember TransAm Trucking vs Admin Review Board during the hearings. Please protect constituents. #StopGorsuch
841725879004864512 2017-03-14 19:01:02 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@SenBobCasey please remember Hwang vs Kansas State University during the hearing. #StopGorsuch
841724136057667586 2017-03-14 18:54:07 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch thinks it's Ok for a company to fire you for refusing to work in dangerous conditions. #StopGorsuch
841722195894235136 2017-03-14 18:46:24 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch's academic qualifications are independent of his extremist record. #StopGorsuch
841720825942331392 2017-03-14 18:40:57 UTC <Cluw_girl> Tell @SenBobCasey we need an independent check on out-of control administration. Sign the petition: http//bit.ly/2lfkrsY #StopGorsuch
841719314503876609 2017-03-14 18:34:57 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch's ability to be an independent check on a reckless administration is in question. #StopGorsuch
841718803889311744 2017-03-14 18:32:55 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@SenToomey Judge Gorsuch is not worthy of backing. Pennsylvanias' deserve an independent nominee w/bipartisan support. #StopGorsuch
841717528959299584 2017-03-14 18:27:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch has sided with employers over the safety concerns of workers in most egregious cases. #StopGorsuch
840151756566888448 2017-03-10 10:46:02 UTC <Cluw_girl> @owillis Thank you. This is a big reason why we don't have a female president.
839260159750856704 2017-03-07 23:43:09 UTC <Cluw_girl> @AlexMLeo @RVAwonk @mlanger @LindaAnnecrawf3 They eliminated essential benefits. Pregnancy and Childbirth were considered essential
839019059232530433 2017-03-06 07:45:06 UTC <Cluw_girl> @ASlavitt @Scarlet_Urban This was a tax under original ACA. Tanning beds = more skin cancer
837891166943182848 2017-03-03 05:03:16 UTC <Cluw_girl> So who in the Trump administration hasn't met with Russians and has no business ties with them?? #RESISTANCE
837889580368080896 2017-03-03 04:56:57 UTC <Cluw_girl> So can we have a new election to get a full time President? This one doesn't work weekends. #ResistTrump
837871559654191104 2017-03-03 03:45:21 UTC <Cluw_girl> Ok someone explain this - given Trump promises. The Keystone pipeline no longer has a Buy American requirement.
834842651862130689 2017-02-23 19:09:33 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch's record is extreme on the rights of women,minorities,persons with disabilities & LGBT Americans. #NoOnGorsuch
834841916046974977 2017-02-23 19:06:38 UTC <Cluw_girl> Judge Gorsuch is not worthy of backing. Pennsylvanians' deserve an independent nominee w/bipartisan support. #NoOnGorsuch
834840693587730433 2017-02-23 19:01:46 UTC <Cluw_girl> Thank you @SenBobCasey for meeting w/ judge Gorsuch & discussing PA's concerns about the SCOTUS  nominee's extreme record #NoOnGorsuch
831857025583767552 2017-02-15 13:25:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> Trump's first act rolling back public protections on oil & mining  companies  already required in other countries.
829315183759728641 2017-02-08 13:05:22 UTC <Cluw_girl> @bannerite @ABC Of course not, he removed the whitehouse comment line!!! But I bet he has gotten calls at his properties!
828348820123709440 2017-02-05 21:05:23 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 wow asking u questions about serious things is bullying. Real Nazis aren't important.  SMH
828346944774889474 2017-02-05 20:57:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 So now you r telling me I'm a nazi because I am concerned about a real Nero-Nazi making policy?? Doesn't make sense to me.
828346090416177153 2017-02-05 20:54:32 UTC <Cluw_girl> @VirginiaInCal Steve Bannon is white supremacist also known as a neo-Nazi. Not my call but groups that track hate groups and everyone else
828342758087749633 2017-02-05 20:41:18 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 you don't find that to be extreme? Minimizing the threat of Nazis? Look at anti Semitic graffiti in 3 cities?
828342216359870464 2017-02-05 20:39:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 I don't mean it to be a threat but comparing Dems to Nazis with real Nazis in the White House?
828338813009330176 2017-02-05 20:25:37 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 because using Nazi Germany with a real neo-Nazi in the Whitehouse is funny in a sad way.
828338440357937153 2017-02-05 20:24:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> @rosevine3 Are you telling us you support Trump and his policies?
828337859572690948 2017-02-05 20:21:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @VirginiaInCal Are you actually saying that Make America Sick again is the same as ACA? It's not. I want single payer but ACA saved lives
828017016254631936 2017-02-04 23:06:55 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenateGOP Betsy DeVos isn't remotely qualified vote No! For those of you who accepted money recuse yourself. #payfor play
828016196759015424 2017-02-04 23:03:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> @SenSchumer Yes let's talk about how @SenateGOP  wouldn't even give a highly qualified nominee a hearing under Obama
827893394412277760 2017-02-04 14:55:41 UTC <Cluw_girl> Check out how your member voted.https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/
827446217500192772 2017-02-03 09:18:46 UTC <Cluw_girl> Matt Taibbi on Donald Trumps strange appeal http://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/2/1/14412450/donald-trump-matt-taibbi-elections-2016-hillary-clinton-media?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter via @voxdotcom
826392261281865728 2017-01-31 11:30:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@SenToomey So how do I register my opposition to Sessions, DeVos, travel ban etc if every voicemail is full??
826390078041767937 2017-01-31 11:22:02 UTC <Cluw_girl> Trump wants to eliminate 75 percent of public protections and reduce the size of departments protecting the public by the same amount
825800972861571073 2017-01-29 20:21:09 UTC <Cluw_girl> Obama gave us the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. What will @AndyPuzder do for #EqualPay? #forwardnotback #AntiLaborSecretary
825800108587495424 2017-01-29 20:17:43 UTC <Cluw_girl> It matters who is in charge. #AndrewPuzder opposes minimum wage. #antilaborsecretary
825797060431642624 2017-01-29 20:05:36 UTC <Cluw_girl> @USATODAY How the Internet reacted to Steve Bannon's growing power in the White House http://usat.ly/2jL27GM via @usatoday
825716931894398977 2017-01-29 14:47:12 UTC <Cluw_girl> Several Trump appointees shared unflattering views of minorities, women on social media http://politi.co/2keVQXg
825353501366689792 2017-01-28 14:43:03 UTC <Cluw_girl> I am ashamed to be an American. The Muslim ban is Unamerican, only on countries Trump doesn't do business with! Saudi Arabia not there
825349450071683073 2017-01-28 14:26:57 UTC <Cluw_girl> Muslim ban is disgraceful & people being held at borders except for countries he does business with.
824925357077823488 2017-01-27 10:21:46 UTC <Cluw_girl> http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-aetna-obamacare-20170123-story.html
824924406518538241 2017-01-27 10:17:59 UTC <Cluw_girl> Wait we have billions of dollars for a wall which we will pay for with an import tax  but none for health care, natural disasters #gop
820382814965219329 2017-01-14 21:31:19 UTC <Cluw_girl> @BillKristol @Sailingflyingd He will destroy NATO and give Putin the Ukraine. He supports Russia before America
820373060809347072 2017-01-14 20:52:34 UTC <Cluw_girl> @BillKristol @Sailingflyingd No Putin is just destabilizing the government. Why would he attack his candidate.
818587728740814848 2017-01-09 22:38:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> So if jobs are important then why get rid of the #ACA? When 30 million less people have healthcare you need fewer people to care for them.
817801007027683331 2017-01-07 18:32:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> Shouldn't it tell you you something when Trimp's cabinet picks have swamped the Ethics office because there are so many problems??
817538779279933442 2017-01-06 01:10:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> So if you are from KY and voted R,did you vote to cut your pay,,remove safety regs, get rid of KYConnect, get rid of black lung benfits etc?
816246927352360960 2017-01-03 11:36:47 UTC <Cluw_girl> The House GOP has announced its New Years resolution by removing the independence of Ethics oversight. Personal responsibility is not #GOP
815324683830788096 2016-12-31 22:32:07 UTC <Cluw_girl> So is it important now that the Russians have hacked a utility?
815318352663035904 2016-12-31 22:06:57 UTC <Cluw_girl> So if Putin is Trump's friend and the people who didn't vote for him his enemy, doesn't that make America an enemy? #TinyFingeredPuppet
813532101740036097 2016-12-26 23:49:02 UTC <Cluw_girl> So minimum wage is going up in 21 states and 22 cities and the newly nominated labor Dept head is against increasing minimum wage??
812792956776316928 2016-12-24 22:51:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> @business So how much have wages gone up and how do make $70,000 a year installing auto glass?
809949286662340608 2016-12-16 02:32:12 UTC <Cluw_girl> @peacebewithus11 I suspect just business as usual. Sigh.
809946380676562944 2016-12-16 02:20:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> @peacebewithus11 I don't think she ever got it? I don't think she would be happy if majority changed and they did the same thing.
809909450169581572 2016-12-16 23:53:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> @realDonaldTrump No we are talking about a foreign country that you are the patsy for. Time to decide - continue to be a patsy or be patriot
809908699716354048 2016-12-16 23:50:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 So when the #GOP majority is gone it will be Ok if this is undone because it's a Republic right???
809908155354349573 2016-12-16 23:48:46 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 We elect officials who make decisions for us, all of us just not those in right group. That's what a Republic is.
809891637245644801 2016-12-16 22:43:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Not a Marxist either. Still can't debate without trying to be insulting must be fun being homeschooled by you.
809891231585157121 2016-12-16 22:41:31 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Ok, so in the course of this you have attempted to discredit by using temper tantrum, pouting, hysteria & insulting. Got Facts?
809890430473093120 2016-12-16 22:38:20 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Not pouting either. I can't say I'm surprised either. I'm sure that was what they said about reconstruction too
809889525614936066 2016-12-16 22:34:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Kari the only one threatening meltdown is you. Your attempts to discredit people by name calling do you no credit
809889065814360064 2016-12-16 22:32:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> @mmfa @owillis @lauradeemcgee He believes whatever he believes will benefit him at that point in time.
809888587391102976 2016-12-16 22:31:00 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Once again not hysterical and you can't seem to talk without being nasty or calling names so hysteria would be on your side
809888200504262656 2016-12-16 22:29:28 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 Yep as I thought can't debate without calling names. Note: Your Republic is not equal to your GOP power.
809887591164211200 2016-12-16 22:27:03 UTC <Cluw_girl> So is there anything #GOP can't justify by saying they are doing God's work or the end justifies the means.
809867969803251712 2016-12-16 21:09:05 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 The #NCGA is willing to do anything to stay in power. Including repressing free speech and anything illegal and immoral
809867151305752576 2016-12-16 21:05:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @happit1776 I'm not surprised that you want to go back to Reconstruction. After all the end justifies the means. Immoral is the new normal
809865386376265728 2016-12-16 20:58:49 UTC <Cluw_girl> @OpinionatedTim @happit1776 Ohh ...so that's why the GOP in NC has done the unimaginable to steal power from the people who voted.
809861625285148676 2016-12-16 20:43:52 UTC <Cluw_girl> @mmfa @owillis @lauradeemcgee Trump is a big supporter of Alex Jones and infowars
809861315267330052 2016-12-16 20:42:38 UTC <Cluw_girl> @OpinionatedTim @happit1776 Given what is going on in your state house where the GOP is trying to grab power at all costs - not a democracy
809820993065721856 2016-12-16 18:02:25 UTC <Cluw_girl> @OpinionatedTim @happit1776 It doesn't matter that you live in a democracy and the people voted does it?
809820000190140417 2016-12-16 17:58:28 UTC <Cluw_girl> @tokyo_jon @kip202017 @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider You do know that there are more faiths than Christianity, don't you?
809818430522200064 2016-12-16 17:52:14 UTC <Cluw_girl> @mmfa @owillis @lauradeemcgee Have you listened to his speech in Hershey? SNL seems to have nailed it with what he hears and says
809817935837589504 2016-12-16 17:50:16 UTC <Cluw_girl> Before Trump is even in office he has wrecked the two mainstays of U.S. Foreign policy.
809813354571329536 2016-12-16 17:32:03 UTC <Cluw_girl> Does anyone remember Ivanka Trump vacationing with Putin's girlfriend? #RussiaHacking
809812369262178304 2016-12-16 17:28:09 UTC <Cluw_girl> @France4Hillary of course he knew. But he is going to do anything he wants to do until he is impeached. Don't hold your breath.
809720601346801664 2016-12-16 11:23:29 UTC <Cluw_girl> IRepublican-you must completely ignore Russian influence if it means you won & any possible conflict of interest by ur president
808670300405698560 2016-12-13 13:49:58 UTC <Cluw_girl> The Republicans and the Russians seemingly wanted the same thing to weaken the country.
807428601499029505 2016-12-09 03:35:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> @oreillyfactor @Mediaite @robinlmeade would you prefer bought and paid for by Putin?
807427692022951936 2016-12-09 03:32:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> Welcome @ChuckJonesUSW19 to Twitter!
807426220757577728 2016-12-09 03:26:26 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@MitchMcConell You attended a briefing in Sept on Russian interference in elections. You did nothing. Wife gets Cabinet post. #russianspy
806993531919331328 2016-12-08 22:47:05 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JuddLegum @EF517_V2 @TANSTAAFL23 Once again you can't do anything without labeling or being condescending- pathetic
806962417427169280 2016-12-08 20:43:27 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@USWBlogger @realDonaldTrump #ImwithChuck since someone has to call bullying leaders out on false promises and inflating numbers.
806954207408431104 2016-12-08 20:10:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @USATODAY @steelworkers @unitehere @tceplus3 With that many of your members losing jobs there was nothing childish. Accountability DJT
806953559443075072 2016-12-08 20:08:15 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JuddLegum @bvkcitizen Funny your twitter feed indicates that you regularly engage in name calling "humor"
806951194501541888 2016-12-08 19:58:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JuddLegum @TANSTAAFL23 once again can't have a debate without calling names. Stay on topic cite facts. Really not so hard.
806945900031606786 2016-12-08 19:37:49 UTC <Cluw_girl> @JuddLegum Seriously? Instead of a conversation make a personal attack. No wonder there is no debate anymore
806813298511450112 2016-12-08 10:50:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> .@realDonaldTrump You didn't say a peep when Republicans stripped out Buy American provisions that would keep jobs here. #ImWithChuck
806807056724303872 2016-12-08 10:26:06 UTC <Cluw_girl> @realDonaldTrump The Republicans just blocked Buy American regs that would keep jobs here in water bill w/o a peep from you

781285937313484800 2016-09-28 00:14:17 UTC <Cluw_girl> @Ronutan Paid family leave and paid sick days would also help close the gap and it benefits men and women.

709513955601989632 2016-03-14 22:58:03 UTC <Cluw_girl> @carrot22221111 @mcoop possibly because I have seen video of people being sucker punched by Trump supporters while being lead out
709313830812258304 2016-03-14 09:42:50 UTC <Cluw_girl> @carrot22221111 @mcoop Given the number of White Supremacists at his rallies and he wants to bring people together? Right
709312297336840192 2016-03-14 09:36:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> @ladies4trump Last time I checked punching people is violence and when someone in front of crowd says it, it incites violence.
708648422102929408 2016-03-12 13:38:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> @realDonaldTrump It takes a real man to allow people to disagree w/out inciting supporters to violence. Maybe you should try it #TrumpRally

703453209461915648 2016-02-26 05:34:49 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger I agree that money in politics has caused government policy to be tilted in favor of business
703452760914698240 2016-02-26 05:33:02 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Big diff between paying according 2 demand for labor and paying enough 2 afford your product.the 2nd mean shared prosperity
703451488887173120 2016-02-26 05:27:59 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger and in the end greed is why capitalism will fail. Because uncontrolled greed and too much power are why economy was regulated
703450904410906624 2016-02-26 05:25:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger so  r prices higher in states where the wage has gone up? Or have they simply cut back on profit sharing more with guy who makes
703448643303567360 2016-02-26 05:16:40 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger precisely my point. They have forgotten how to share equitably in profit so that workers can afford to buy their product. Policy
703448109322526720 2016-02-26 05:14:33 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Companies no longer care if workers can afford their product because they are greedy.They let taxpayers support workers instead
703447198395195392 2016-02-26 05:10:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Henry Ford knew he had to pay his workers well so they could afford to buy his product. Higher wages means more demand.
703446889329528836 2016-02-26 05:09:42 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger ok riddle me this. Those state that have upped minimum wage are doing better economically than those that haven't
703446434926993408 2016-02-26 05:07:54 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger China sets their currency so they have a roughly 40% advantage. They subsidize raw materials and utilities. Not a level field
703444322302214146 2016-02-26 04:59:30 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger This government has pursued many trade cases most companies won't join on case because they have a business in China. Greed
703443638722928641 2016-02-26 04:56:47 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger in Australia McDonalds pays a higher wage, ma pension & health insurance. A meal is a few cents more It's not suicide it's greed
703442869806301184 2016-02-26 04:53:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Wages used to track with productivity since the worker shared in  profit. Now the CEO gets the profit & company pays no taxes.
703441966948884480 2016-02-26 04:50:08 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Perhaps you should study Germany. They have not outsourced their economy
703441459463249920 2016-02-26 04:48:07 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger So under that philosophy, what would you make here? We outsourced military electronics to China, wonder how they hacked us?
703440141164089345 2016-02-26 04:42:53 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger nope I'm not. Our military has wasted enormous amounts of money that would be better spent replacing lead pipes
703439832404598784 2016-02-26 04:41:39 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Wait he makes ties in Mexico and China. Explain how that means he really is good on trade. Walk the talk.
703438960866009088 2016-02-26 04:38:12 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger When the government spent money to put a man on the moon, it was to  fulfill a dream not to make a buck. #GOPdebate
703435617280114689 2016-02-26 04:24:55 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger So if Trump is so good on trade why isn't he making his ties in the United States #GOPDebate
703435100952915970 2016-02-26 04:22:51 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger Building a border wall is not spending our money wisely. It means spending money on bricks not on seniors and vets
703434461627719680 2016-02-26 04:20:19 UTC <Cluw_girl> @hamstanger if spending it "wisely" means not taking care of our vets, not taking care of seniors then we as a country have lost our way
703432048271335424 2016-02-26 04:10:44 UTC <Cluw_girl> Running the country is not the same as running a business. Many of the things a country is responsible for are not money makers #GOPdebate

696360148294574080 2016-02-07 15:49:31 UTC <Cluw_girl> What small government really means. You are expected to save more for retirement, health care,college while wages have decreased

693492373112930304 2016-01-30 17:54:00 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MicahLance @tedlawfla @vj44 @redsteeze Ok so if you guys are willing to post everyone's wages on a bulletin board that would help.
693490852790943746 2016-01-30 17:47:58 UTC <Cluw_girl> @tedlawfla @vj44 @MicahLance @redsteeze I would also add that it has been proven that "business" won't give a pregnant woman a stool.
693490097191272450 2016-01-30 17:44:58 UTC <Cluw_girl> @tedlawfla @vj44 @MicahLance @redsteeze  Two words, Lily Ledbetter. She won awards and was paid way less than her male counterpart.
693480024587005952 2016-01-30 17:04:56 UTC <Cluw_girl> businesses have to be forced to provide pregnant workers a stool, more frequent bathroom breaks or the opportunity to stay hydrated. Sad.
693115678233083908 2016-01-29 16:57:09 UTC <Cluw_girl> @MicahLance @redsteeze @vj44 your boss can fire you for asking about pay rates. Rates are not published. How do you know? #equalpay
