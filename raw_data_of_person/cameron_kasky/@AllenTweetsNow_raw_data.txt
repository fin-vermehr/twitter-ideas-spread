970878376109072384 2018-03-05 04:26:57 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @laurenzima What the Bachelor franchise did tonight was gross and I may not watch anymore seasons. I am legit angry. They crossed a line.
970876192533467146 2018-03-05 04:18:16 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @BachelorABC Hey, what I just watched was disgusting and smarmy. I feel dirty.  I dont know if Ill watch upcoming seasons. To inflict this level of humiliation on anyone (regardless of the contract) is unethical.
956296962868903938 2018-01-24 22:45:37 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @mrjoshz @GET2DACHOPPANOW So what. So what. His family perished under Hitler. So what, so what to your point.
956296577596960768 2018-01-24 22:44:05 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @mrjoshz @jramirez83nj Stupid question. Stop with the whataboutism. How often do you speak on the Jewish holocaust? What about the Armenian genocide? His family members perished under Hitler. He is not obligated to speak about every other world tragedy.
955667702219190273 2018-01-22 05:05:10 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @RoseTwatters True.

951282181376266240 2018-01-10 02:38:40 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @CNN @cnn @ChrisCuomo Please see the tweet that I sent to CNN in 08/17. Just turned on CNN to check out Chriss new show. I saw Kellyanne and turned it off. Maybe  Cuomo v. Kellyanne drives up ratings. You all keep doing this. I cant imaginehttps://twitter.com/allentweetsnow/status/893294584134066176
951153485969612800 2018-01-10 18:07:17 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @sunny Great job today. Youre a strong capable woman. My mother (who is retired) initially pointed out the Whoopi dynamic and I noticed it since Ive been sick at home.  My mom, just called me, because she noticed the difference today too. Were proud of you
950915208272334848 2018-01-09 02:20:27 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @TheRickWilson Ha. You have quite a talent for ad hominem insults.

950777936247971843 2018-01-09 17:14:59 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> Best.
950777934712844289 2018-01-09 17:14:58 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> Get with Whoopi the way Meghan has gotten with Joy and Whoopi will back off you. She treats you more hostile than anyone on the panel and you take it. Please stop. Stand up for yourself. She doesnt respect you. Are you scared of her?
950777931831357441 2018-01-09 17:14:58 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @sunny When are you going to stand up for yourself and stop letting Whoopi take pot shots? You address a lot of your commentary to her. She is dismissive and borderline disrespectful to you. I know you can get with people. Why not her?
950766116388986881 2018-01-09 16:28:01 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @benshapiro Your criticism of what Oprah knew about the Hollywood crowd and Weinstein is perhaps a fair one.  Your critique that she has done nothing over the last 20 years  for victims of sexual assault  is incomplete and incorrect. Do your research.https://twitter.com/mmfa/status/950760875757129728
950754292847316992 2018-01-09 15:41:02 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @PagosaUberguy What a demeaning and irrelevant statement to make. What a reflection of your character. For the record - the word is youre. It is a contraction of you are not your.
950614947788218368 2018-01-08 06:27:19 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @StefanMolyneux Being childless is an indicator of? The assumed correlation to globalism is? As youre fond of saying - not an argument against her or anyone.
950497276878901249 2018-01-08 22:39:44 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @Oprah @oprah I agree. You are my hero. However, you dont have executive governmental experience. Trump is a singular temperamental disaster. You would far exceed him. I dont want to see another trial by presidency.

884460196378161152 2017-07-10 17:11:57 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @CNN You've got to stop booking Kellyanne Conway. The combative 36 min intvu with Cuomo was not substantive. Click bait. Please stop.
878706282370396161 2017-06-24 20:07:57 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @ava I hope Nova and Calvin are addressed (even their resolution) is addressed in season 2. Weird that there is no mention of relat so far.

869049876394455040 2017-05-28 04:36:51 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @GQMagazine ??? I do not agree at all. This show has nothing in common with Game of Thrones except costumes.

851623683940646912 2017-04-10 02:31:23 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @united That non apology by the CEO is not sufficient. It is a legal 'apology'. I'm horrified by the treatment of that passenger.

833775195458531329 2017-02-20 20:27:52 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @Angeliiiiique both things can be true.        Also, an observation isn't an attack on Rick and Michonne. It is just an observation.
833774845435445248 2017-02-20 20:26:28 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @Angeliiiiique I think it is great Rick and Michonne are together. I also pointed out the chemistry I noticed between Rick and Jadis.
833774524877402112 2017-02-20 20:25:12 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @Angeliiiiique your tweet is in the Rick thread. Again, Andy described their dynamic as 'combative, sexual, and flirtatious."

833711625760866304 2017-02-20 16:15:15 UTC <AllenTweetsNow> @sonequamcbride Rick and Jadis do have chemistry. Andrew Lincoln said exactly this in an EW interview. I noticed it immediately.
