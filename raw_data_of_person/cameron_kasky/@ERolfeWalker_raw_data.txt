963126177190825985 2018-02-12 19:02:29 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @bearingdrift @BarbaraComstock The Republican Party is an absolute embarrassment. Reagan would be disgusted. You might not agree on policy but you need to be able to respect the person holding office. Trump and anyone who doesnt hold him accountable needs to go. Bye bye Babs.

956234243968991232 2018-01-24 18:36:24 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @andylassner @daxshepard1 Is Trump the guy who watches Trading Places and roots for the two old white dudes?  Im pretty sure hes that guy.

944286616935456769 2017-12-22 19:20:48 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @goldengateblond Im wondering why the wave of change in the house that will hopefully happen next year didnt happen while President Obama was in office. Do you think its because those of us who are mobilizing now were just so comfortable with him in office? We took our off
944285241329496064 2017-12-22 19:15:20 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @goldengateblond @cmclymer Is the Die Hard stat in there to make sure people read it?

941674410049724417 2017-12-15 14:20:49 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @marcorubio senator, please hold out. Do not vote for this garbage tax bill. Everything Trump touches turns to crap.
941009189161316352 2017-12-13 18:17:28 UTC <ERolfeWalker> Now, if Wisconsin can get rid of @SpeakerRyan and Kentucky can ditch Mitch McConnell then real change could happen. 
941005767850721280 2017-12-13 18:03:52 UTC <ERolfeWalker> @BarbaraComstock please defend #NetNeutraility.  Without a free internet we will be in even greater trouble as a country. Thank you.
