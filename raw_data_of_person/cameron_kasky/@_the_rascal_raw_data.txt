970071366207549440 2018-03-03 23:00:11 UTC <_the_rascal> How is it that we live in a country where owning a gun is a right, but if you get shot then treatment and recovery are a privilege? #NeverAgain #NRAKillsKids
970064875480236032 2018-03-03 22:34:23 UTC <_the_rascal> @realDonaldTrump @ZabuzaTheMist No, war is the reason were in huge debt. Yes raising taxes lowers the debt, but the republicans just lowered taxes and are increasing spending. A tariff is a tax on imported goods that is passed on to the consumer here so WE end up paying the price.
969970472468201473 2018-03-03 16:19:16 UTC <_the_rascal> @ZabuzaTheMist @realDonaldTrump We get steel from others. Why is that so bad? Why are you so afraid of the rest of the world you pussy?
969968328373501952 2018-03-03 16:10:45 UTC <_the_rascal> @ListenUpMatt Looooooooooool
969968239668215808 2018-03-03 16:10:24 UTC <_the_rascal> @ZabuzaTheMist This is true
968711306500038656 2018-02-27 04:55:47 UTC <_the_rascal> @FPWellman Its like saying global warming isnt real because its cold sometimes. People arent one thing or emotion.

968677639912214528 2018-02-27 02:42:01 UTC <_the_rascal> It was supposed to rain 2 days in a row and then it just didnt. Also, it was sunny. Thats like seeing someone wind up to kick you in the balls only to slip on a banana peel and wind up roasted
968497544467640321 2018-02-27 14:46:23 UTC <_the_rascal> @ZabuzaTheMist They were committed with a gun. It counts towards the total. Its much harder to kill yourself without it and numbers show that decreased access to guns lowers suicide rates
968370889724133376 2018-02-26 06:23:06 UTC <_the_rascal> more Americans have died from gun violence, including suicides, since 1970 (about 1.4 million) than in all the wars in American history going back to the Revolutionary War (about 1.3 million). We played ourselves man, whats the deal?
968370409367330817 2018-02-26 06:21:11 UTC <_the_rascal> The terrible truth is that the Florida school shooting was 100% predictable. So is the next one. After each such incident, we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims, but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability.
968367942877564933 2018-02-26 06:11:23 UTC <_the_rascal> We know how much guns are harmful and we still dont ban them. We banned lead from gasoline, we banned children from getting cigarettes, we can damn sure ban guns. The second amendment can be removed as surely as it was added. Its in the name: AMMENDMENT
968367339493314565 2018-02-26 06:08:59 UTC <_the_rascal> When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to research gun violence, Congress responded by cutting its funding. #fucktheNRA Wake up.
968366531896860672 2018-02-26 06:05:47 UTC <_the_rascal> As much as I cant stand authoritarian governing, I see it as acceptable in getting guns out of our lives. We can change the culture. Fuck the culture if it means people die in the name of peoples feelings or opinions. Ban them all.
968366031071776768 2018-02-26 06:03:47 UTC <_the_rascal> In many places in the U.S., there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms. Face facts, that shit is ridiculous. #GunContolNow #ThingsICantAccept #

You have to have a test to know that youre capable of driving a car and do hundreds of hours of training. So why should it be easier to buy a gun?

964022007896526848 2018-02-14 06:22:12 UTC <_the_rascal> @theneedledrop Mostly agree, although I have a really strong attraction to YAH and the way its just so spacey and different. FEAR would be my number 1
