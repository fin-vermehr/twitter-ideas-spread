972203919525818368 2018-03-09 20:14:11 UTC <franlondon> Wow. It seems some folks think the only college majors available are gender studies, film history,  regional studies, & women's history. Or that every new grad with degrees in geology, chemistry, psychology, & business can get a job that pays the rent AND tuition debt.
