967184060664524802 2018-02-23 23:47:04 UTC <erkj72> @thekwakuel Plus, you dont want any girl who says crap like that! The girl you deserve will love you no matter what. Youve got more mission war stories than a lot of people who go out. Youre a good man and you always will be!
967183686499094528 2018-02-23 23:45:34 UTC <erkj72> @thekwakuel But youre a great servant of the Lord now! If you decide to go, great! If you dont, great! Well all love you just the same and youre doing the Lords work right here and right now.
967183348488548352 2018-02-23 23:44:14 UTC <erkj72> @thekwakuel What Im trying to say is whether you go or dont. Its whats best for you. Youre doing the Lords work here and now. You dont need a name badge to be a servant of the Lord. Well hear the voices in our head and the words of those who will never understand.
967182999312678912 2018-02-23 23:42:51 UTC <erkj72> @thekwakuel When I came home. He said, No matter what we support and love you. Go, dont go, thats your choice. Dont do it for your church or your parent. Not for anyone but you. Everyone will love you just the same.
967182698115510272 2018-02-23 23:41:39 UTC <erkj72> @thekwakuel Youre the man! It sucks to hear the thoughts in your head. I didnt go until I was 20 and turned 21 in the MTC. Well heres the thing, I went to the MTC at 19 and left four days into it. Have that hanging over my head forever but my uncle, whos not LDS gave me the best advice
966860131051819008 2018-02-22 02:19:53 UTC <erkj72> @amberhasalamb Im still trying to figure out why anyone would be proud of this comparison...

966077124195975169 2018-02-20 22:28:29 UTC <erkj72> @poetickate @itsabsaf I agree. Plus, it adds a layer of trust that should exist in your marriage. This way youre totally comfortable and dont feel like secrets were kept from or that youre keeping secrets from them. Trust trust trust!
966004536732041216 2018-02-20 17:40:03 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz Haha we need to move to Ohio where our political views matter
965999225052909569 2018-02-20 17:18:57 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz Haha oh we could. It would make us really depressed though haha
965998679751454720 2018-02-20 17:16:47 UTC <erkj72> @Papa_Ostler And then Alma saying, Hey thanks Korihor! I hope the Nephites like me too!
965998106054504448 2018-02-20 17:14:30 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz Glad were the few who see that. Ugh. We have the same problem here in Idaho.
965996698861318145 2018-02-20 17:08:55 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz Especially when his values dont align with ours on any level. Trump doesnt stand for any kind of Christian values, even though he says he does. He is the total opposite of what any of us stand for...or should stand for at least.
965989868105973761 2018-02-20 16:41:46 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz It does, but it still doesnt resolve the fact that he accepted it and hell now have to justify to Utahans why he accepted it. Although the vast majority are pleased that he did.

965988457506947072 2018-02-20 16:36:10 UTC <erkj72> @MittRomney @ananavarro @ToddOrtiz I said this to my wife last night. Mitt is going to win, so Trump is attaching himself to the guarantee. Problem is, Mitt will now be beholden to Trump on some level for his whole tenure as a Senator.

965807181869195264 2018-02-19 04:35:50 UTC <erkj72> @ToddOrtiz Same. I aligned with conservative values my entire life, until I saw that the Party of Lincoln really looked more like the Party of Only Me. They only care about themselves as individuals and no one else.
965796860056166400 2018-02-19 03:54:49 UTC <erkj72> @ToddOrtiz I was hoping hed stand up to the cretin thats in office and do something to right the GOP ship, although I no longer support them. But this, this shows me that anything can be bought with money...

964567150244503552 2018-02-16 18:28:24 UTC <erkj72> @amberhasalamb Trump said that he had enough money on his own to campaign and didnt need donations. He sure used all those donations and has been swayed by money. I think Mitt has real intentions, but itll be interesting to see if its for real. I hope it is.

963409198372478976 2018-02-13 13:47:06 UTC <erkj72> @realspencervail @parkeratyler The part I dont get is if things change then it must mean it was never right, even in the new form. But if things dont change then its old fashioned and out of touch.
963287850329325568 2018-02-12 05:44:55 UTC <erkj72> @realspencervail People are still getting mad about how things were interpreted or done a hundred years ago. Not surprised. Anything to rile up the hornets nest

961111772764786688 2018-02-06 05:37:57 UTC <erkj72> @twalker201 Yeah I just think him staying in NE will be better long term. Bills system where its already known. The hard part is whos available? Really just the coaches from Philly, but theyre not bad options!

959056677843554304 2018-02-01 13:31:45 UTC <erkj72> @itsabsaf its a BYU/BYUI fallacy that being married in college means success. There are so many positive things about being single through college.

956590778083454976 2018-01-25 18:13:08 UTC <erkj72> @dnlrntr I think you just tell her to stop yelling. Ive had roommates or their significant others who were loud like that and I just tell them to tone it down...Sometimes in a funny way, that may come off a little spiteful...whoops!
956589517443485696 2018-01-25 18:08:08 UTC <erkj72> @JosephHorner But as soon as you say youre moving them everyone will come out of the woodwork saying how much they love them. Example: Seattle 1.0, St. Louis Rams, San Diego Chargers.

954747109198118914 2018-01-20 16:07:03 UTC <erkj72> I told her as an HR professional, as a man, and as a father I was very, very impressed with her. I commended her for her bravery and expressed how proud I was of her for standing up to him. 6/

954746468333535232 2018-01-20 16:04:31 UTC <erkj72> Instead of staying quiet she stood up to him. She also went above him to report the harassment that they were all experiencing. They listened, he was let go and banned from theater property. 4/
954746178041610241 2018-01-20 16:03:21 UTC <erkj72> Remember, shes in high school. At the movie theater her manager was sexually harassing her, and other female employees. She was scared to say anything, as were all the other ladies working there. 3/
954745845806637056 2018-01-20 16:02:02 UTC <erkj72> I asked the question, tell me about a time you used your leadership skills of One of the young women I had the pleasure of interviewing. She told me about a time while she was working at a movie theatre. 2/

953407232896417792 2018-01-16 23:22:52 UTC <erkj72> @dnlrntr He said drop the m so I think he means Orons... I think Clacks been reading too much 60s science fiction

946158345785765888 2017-12-27 23:18:23 UTC <erkj72> @twalker201 I think the new jazz jerseys are cool. Super different, but the line on the sides representing the roads between North and south are great!
946156572287176704 2017-12-27 23:11:20 UTC <erkj72> @twalker201 As for him being cut, that happens to a lot of players who are UDFA. He did work to get to where he was. The weirdest part is how vocal hes been against the Pats and Goodell then he just waltzes into their arms. But business is business 
946156183529730048 2017-12-27 23:09:47 UTC <erkj72> @twalker201 I hear you on that. he was frustrated with not playing, but would anyone play him over Watt given his production? I dont think so. Its more just out of all the teams he couldve signed with it had to be the Pats.
946148069669707776 2017-12-27 22:37:33 UTC <erkj72> @twalker201 That is true, although it sounds like he forced he way out then went to their arch nemesis. Seems like a punk move to be an all time great for one organization and then go to their arch rival for bird seed. That being said, hes gotta do whats best for him.

I look at it as a political issue, i.e. they may view the procurement of healthcare through other avenues. When we consider the sexual abuse of a child thats not political, thats a crime.

938512458561462272 2017-12-06 20:56:21 UTC <erkj72> @JonRiley7 I dont consider myself a Dem but I lean left. Id rather have someone in that seat that opposed my political views who isnt morally repugnant that someone who shares my views that is morally bankrupt
938503517421019136 2017-12-06 20:20:49 UTC <erkj72> @KylaPadbury This is a trash explanation covering for his trash employer. Hatch didnt have to do anything. Supporting Moore is supporting sex offenders, period. Kayla I believe you and I believe all the women who were CHILDREN when Moore abused them.

For normal ppl we loo for the one, where the weirdos look for the only one. Might sound harsh but thats how Ive see it...also, PENIS!!

925494908646973441 2017-10-31 22:49:15 UTC <erkj72> Hey @Twitter your targeting software is off...#GetThisTrashOuttaHerehttps://twitter.com/foxnews/status/925424651865612288
925494131828207616 2017-10-31 22:46:10 UTC <erkj72> @JazzJargon Haha hey man Im hoping he brings people here!!
925492884870119424 2017-10-31 22:41:13 UTC <erkj72> @JazzJargon Lets hope its a recruiting tool to bring them to SLC and not other way around. Yeah, Ive become a pessimist.
925492325370904577 2017-10-31 22:38:59 UTC <erkj72> @joshgroban its about how other respond and rally is where we see Gods hands(you said it). We just need to believe He will take care of those taken.
925491809496702976 2017-10-31 22:36:56 UTC <erkj72> @joshgroban I dont think God wills things. He allows people to make choices, unfortunately it can cause dire consequences for those affected.
925483071679356928 2017-10-31 22:02:13 UTC <erkj72> @GZSports_ZM They should be happy it didnt go through. Not for A.J. McCarron...
925437262640189440 2017-10-31 19:00:11 UTC <erkj72> @brookamimi Seriously though, I agree. Dont know much Hamilton but Les Mis is everything!!
925424370956169216 2017-10-31 18:08:58 UTC <erkj72> @Steel_Curtain4 @Nobe412 I agree and thats why I kept him for so long. Hard part is holding out hope, starting him and getting no points. I was tired
925413269698887680 2017-10-31 17:24:51 UTC <erkj72> @Steel_Curtain4 Added him last week and dumped Bryant. Paid off!!
925413004174168064 2017-10-31 17:23:48 UTC <erkj72> @hankschulman  Strickland one of few proven relievers for Giants. Most good pitching prospects I wouldnt want to trade. But its enticing...
925366235801546752 2017-10-31 14:17:57 UTC <erkj72> @JoshMarino420 Seriously though. $10 mil to Cutler for one year. Trade your top producer for a 4th with no o-line. Rough
925363842921705472 2017-10-31 14:08:27 UTC <erkj72> @JoshMarino420 I mean...Lets just hope the 4th rounder isnt your next starting QB...

924775403994071040 2017-10-29 23:10:12 UTC <erkj72> @realspencervail Have you seen the Parts Unknown @Bourdain did on Georgia? It looks amazing!!

924761553676537856 2017-10-29 22:15:10 UTC <erkj72> @realspencervail Id say go to Iran. Its something not many Americans have or will see
924757964568662016 2017-10-29 22:00:54 UTC <erkj72> @realspencervail Iran would be so sweet!! How does that work with travel restrictions and such?

924750771031117824 2017-10-29 21:32:19 UTC <erkj72> @notmenken Sounds like something Id do too. My thought is dont worry about it really. Just enjoy the ride and whatever happens, happens.
