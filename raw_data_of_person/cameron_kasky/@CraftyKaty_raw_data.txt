963913213724131328 2018-02-14 23:09:53 UTC <CraftyKaty> Hey all- Stop being ashamed of how you met your significant other. I don't care if it was on the internet, in a bar, through your mutual lawyer, at community service, at AA... if it has brought you happiness, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Hooray love or similar emotions!
963551567516286976 2018-02-13 23:12:50 UTC <CraftyKaty> Real talk, the old woman who lived in a shoe was a victim of poor sex education and a culture of shitty men. The shoe was just a smart home buying choice. Stop shaming a lady for doing her best.
