951231569519235073 2018-01-10 23:17:33 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump That's odd, in the meeting you said you wanted a clean DACA bill.
951150125065306112 2018-01-10 17:53:55 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump What does "take control" mean exactly? Do you want the Republican party to obstruct justice with you? Or are just going to seize power outright and abolish Congress altogether?

913164682067881984 2017-09-27 22:13:20 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You've passed no significant legislation in 9 months! The economy is still running on Obama's policies. And you have all 3 branches: SAD!
913008677174562816 2017-09-27 11:53:26 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Now there's a perfect example of fake news! Unless you work with Dems to fix the #ACA, you will never get anything passed.

912627859356815360 2017-09-26 10:40:12 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Too bad you couldn't hear the millions upon millions booing you after you stole the election.

911736597003034624 2017-09-23 23:38:38 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Its time to follow McCain's advice and return to regular order. Fix the #ACA work with the Dems, you'll finally be more than a tragic clown.
911663451822575617 2017-09-23 18:47:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Is there anyone besides the Neo-Nazis that you haven't pissed off yet? Just asking.
911568923379806208 2017-09-23 12:32:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @joncoopertweets @VedEnvy @CPinNashville It bothers me that Collins and Murkowski have been so quiet. I thought they would be the first "no" votes.
911568032933273602 2017-09-23 12:28:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind Exactly! So is there any hope of fair elections in 2018/20? It doesn't seem like the dems are really on top of this issue.
911566129784639488 2017-09-23 12:21:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind What worries me is that there has been nothing done to prevent this happening in 2018. And nobody has checked if congress races were hacked.
911544060095160320 2017-09-23 10:53:34 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Here's an idea: work w Schumer and Pelosi to fix the ACA, and declare it a victory.

910504372118933505 2017-09-20 14:02:13 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump My s/o has been in the ICU for 3 days, thanks to the #ACA she's covered, otherwise we would end up in bankruptcy. Stop #GrahamCassidy
909437497901555712 2017-09-17 15:22:50 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump So why did you spend all morning retweeting childish memes? Did Gen Kelly forget to slip you meds this morning?
909400418509258752 2017-09-17 12:55:30 UTC <parabolicmirro> @JoyAnnReid This one in particular deserves the same level of outrage as Kathy Griffin or Jemele Hill.
909084956604993542 2017-09-16 16:01:58 UTC <parabolicmirro> Great thread on the importance of Mueller's investigation into Facebook.https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/909046790292418561

908773099788734464 2017-09-15 19:22:45 UTC <parabolicmirro> Graham Cassidy is the SOS in a slightly newer bag. #IStandWithPP #ACA #UniversalHealthCare
908748499700928512 2017-09-15 17:45:00 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenateDems @SenSchumer Block Graham Cassidy bill by any means necessary! Don't let 32 million Americans lose insurance. #ACA
908669930211610624 2017-09-15 12:32:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> For the Nazis and Botzis rushing to Trump's defense this morning. Here's proof https://nyti.ms/2eZFtK2 #Nazibucketchallenge
908659762170155008 2017-09-15 11:52:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @kharyp Wasn't this a plot in the last season of Kimmy Schmidt?
908658652495716359 2017-09-15 11:47:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> I am a writer, an animal rescuer and a patriot, and I believe Trump is a white supremacist. #NaziBucketChallenge
908645813945028608 2017-09-15 10:56:58 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You left out unconstitutional, that's a little more important than politically correct.
908645359861235713 2017-09-15 10:55:10 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Start with #facebook, #Russia and #WhiteSupremacists.
908419030612144128 2017-09-14 19:55:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You love them enough to watch some of them suffer and die from lack of healthcare, while others go bankrupt? #ImpeachTrump
908416622121152518 2017-09-14 19:46:14 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump There's a trump tweet for everything- except that. You never mentioned single payer.
908416046574514177 2017-09-14 19:43:57 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Curse everyone with healthcare? Your brain is actually wired backwards isn't it.
908370579803303937 2017-09-14 16:43:17 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear I'm sure he just forgot to add a few zeroes.
908368113686675457 2017-09-14 16:33:29 UTC <parabolicmirro> @OhNoSheTwitnt Maybe Alex Jones was right, they've started secretly medicating him.
908105773091344385 2017-09-13 23:11:02 UTC <parabolicmirro> @HuffPost So glad the judge did the right thing here.

(Yes I'm kidding.)
907939890893135877 2017-09-13 12:11:53 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Sooooo , you'll be golfing on a long weekend.
907938747332907008 2017-09-13 12:07:20 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Yes please try to rush through more badly written legislation before the CBO can score it and let us know what damage will be done. #resist
907925800984432640 2017-09-13 11:15:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @GeorgeTakei It's true, Trump has zero Russian ties, they're all made in China.
907736367945469953 2017-09-12 22:43:09 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind First person who says "party of Lincoln" gets slapped. That changed a long time ago.
907735891162083328 2017-09-12 22:41:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind This is not just #Trump. A large part of the #GOP has always been racist. Trump just encouraged it rather then pretended it didn't exist.
907733298432143360 2017-09-12 22:30:57 UTC <parabolicmirro> My s/o just sent me a quote, I seriously had to ask her if it was from #Trump or #HomerSimpson.
907319287123234816 2017-09-11 19:05:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> @oneunderscore__ @willsommer A mood stabilizer would be a better idea, just saying.
906581570739466240 2017-09-09 18:14:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @RVAwonk I worry the magnitude of this investigation will take a decade to complete. Trump needs to be charged with something soon.
906580789726515202 2017-09-09 18:11:18 UTC <parabolicmirro> @DailyFreeman Why does this report have an ad claiming "Sting's body found at the bottom of a river?" Please don't allow fake news to be advertised.
906555293114490881 2017-09-09 16:29:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear You have a nice day too.
906553084452769793 2017-09-09 16:21:12 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear #BernieSanders is an idealist, his message has been consistent for decades. I think he's actually more effective outside the presidency
906545377117077504 2017-09-09 15:50:35 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear Bullshit! He campaigned for Hillary. But she made no effort to reach out to his supporters.
906544563229257729 2017-09-09 15:47:21 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear Once again, that's the past. Campaigns get nasty, HRC was just as tough on Bernie and Obama. After the convention Bernie backed her.
906543754068328448 2017-09-09 15:44:08 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear being attacked. If he should not reply because of HRC's gender, then you're reinforcing the double standard that she's trying to overcome.
906542208630878208 2017-09-09 15:37:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear This is a very different scenario BTW then say Warren's "yet she persisted" moment. You can't expect someone to remain silent after 1/2
906540239308705792 2017-09-09 15:30:10 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear She attacked him directly in her book, how should he respond? I think he was gracious in not revisiting the past and calling her on her shit
906504058323824640 2017-09-09 13:06:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Realmommabear This is pure BS, there's a huge difference between saying "move forward" and "be quiet."
906498860180275200 2017-09-09 12:45:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear LMSW jobs where I live start as low as 24k, and not necessarily non profit companies either. Many people are working 2 ft jobs to survive
906497066607812610 2017-09-09 12:38:37 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear To some extent yes, but its fallen so far behind a "livable wage" which in turn lets companies suppress all wages. 1/2
906495091438751744 2017-09-09 12:30:46 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear Or was it getting big money out of politics? It will never really happen, but it should be strived for instead of ignored by both parties.
906493961505832960 2017-09-09 12:26:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @gregolear You mean like #MedicareForAll which Kamala and other Dems are getting on board with? Or raising the min wage which Hillary slowly adopted?
906107215005745152 2017-09-08 10:49:29 UTC <parabolicmirro> @OhNoSheTwitnt That read like some kind of SNL skit, the fact that it wasn't is very depressing.
905882512274202627 2017-09-07 19:56:36 UTC <parabolicmirro> @GinaWFox @WilliamTurton That's probably the family motto.
905751143623647232 2017-09-07 11:14:35 UTC <parabolicmirro> @POTUS @HouseGOP @Indivisible19NY @AdamSchiffCA 2018 is coming.
905528054088437761 2017-09-06 20:28:06 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenSchumer Do not comprise the DREAM act with funding for Trump's Wall. We don't need a 3000 mile monument to racism.
905525362750345216 2017-09-06 20:17:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @RepJohnFaso @Indivisible19NY @Brianbr13 He didn't when he promised that woman on video that he wouldn't vote for an ACA repeal that didn't protect Medicaid recipients.
905516805514461184 2017-09-06 19:43:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @AGSchneiderman Thank you! And hopefully your criminal investigations get him out of office.
905481844380061696 2017-09-06 17:24:29 UTC <parabolicmirro> @UlsterCntySPCA It would be great if their pics were available when you post these.
905395686476271616 2017-09-06 11:42:07 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @ericgarland I appreciate the thoroughness, but in the meantime these criminals keep destroying the country. #ImpeachTrump
905387166884356100 2017-09-06 11:08:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump But keep telling people #climatechange  is a hoax made by the Chinese. Look at how many record breaking weather events in the last 20 years.
905382498917654528 2017-09-06 10:49:43 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump We're not even close! Do you ever get your facts straight?! #Impeach45
905026558754267136 2017-09-05 11:15:20 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You have taken away worker protections, overtime pay, and everything you produce is made in China, you don't get to wish us a happy laborday

904312786955755520 2017-09-03 11:59:04 UTC <parabolicmirro> For his #LaborDay message, #Trump will announce that he's creating jobs by eliminating minimum wage.
904311787327295488 2017-09-03 11:55:06 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump And how can you guarantee the safety of millions of South Koreans from conventional weapons, if you attack #NorthKorea? You can't.
904310490284924928 2017-09-03 11:49:56 UTC <parabolicmirro> @OhNoSheTwitnt We know he won't blame global warming.
904140950137647108 2017-09-02 00:36:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> @HuffPost Must share this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHYJhFh6fRY
903034208427356162 2017-08-30 23:18:27 UTC <parabolicmirro> @FoxNews @foxnewspoll Trump didn't start this, he capitalized on it. This is the culmination of 30+ years of Fox News, Rush, Savage etc....
902568816764481536 2017-08-29 16:29:09 UTC <parabolicmirro> @JoyAnnReid Wtf?
902198402045407233 2017-08-28 15:57:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> @HillaryClinton @VedEnvy @Zebop @Sabertrooth Sounds good to me, (although I am a white man.)
902135253615116288 2017-08-28 11:46:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop @Sabertrooth Also, look at who ran in the 1980 GOP primary, there were plenty of big names. In 2016 only one Dem congressman ran and then outsiders.
902133865199886337 2017-08-28 11:40:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop @Sabertrooth Reagan picked Bush as his VP, who filled out his shortcomings. Hillary ignored hers and picked a VP with similar issues. That hurt her.
901901065406353408 2017-08-27 20:15:45 UTC <parabolicmirro> @RedCross @citizenservant @ZZZZaa_AH @soniagupta504 When the El Nino floods cut me and my gf off from the world. The Red Cross flew  us and our dogs out by helicopter.
901782783172980737 2017-08-27 12:25:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop Which means voter info could be deleted and those votes not counted. The 1% wins are suspicious as well. Hillary should've called recounts.
901781756319338496 2017-08-27 12:21:39 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop Hillary's real loss had to do with Russian interference, and very possibly Russian hacking. We now know they accessed voter rolls 1/2
901780850068611073 2017-08-27 12:18:03 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop Biden could've run, he would've been a viable challenger, there were many other potentials. Certainly more notable than John Wolfe Jr.
901779924184432640 2017-08-27 12:14:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop The buzz among the party was that it was Hillary's turn, much like 2008 was supposed to be McCain's turn. That's why no other major Dems ran
901767887475658752 2017-08-27 11:26:33 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop Bernie ran, because he saw a chance to win. He represented the pre-Clinton Dems, as many of us felt Bill sold out the party to big biz. 2/2
901767190365515778 2017-08-27 11:23:46 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @Zebop The very idea that 2016 was "Hillary's Turn" and no Dems were supposed to challenge her demonstrated that she was a weak candidate. 1/2
901407038940565504 2017-08-26 11:32:40 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump By doing so, you've reconfirmed that you are a racist, and that you support unconstitutional actions. You sir, are unfit to hold office.
901266761462554624 2017-08-25 02:15:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> Soooo, then Gorka's gone,   and Arpaio has been pardoned, now it feels like a "normal" Friday in Trumpworld.
901203863499411456 2017-08-25 22:05:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> It's Friday evening and there's no new scandal or meltdown from #45, is anyone else disturbed by this? #FridayFeeling
901043678583685120 2017-08-25 11:28:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump It was 3 Republicans who (thankfully) stopped #Trumpcare, It will be Dems in 2019 who impeach you. Maybe that should be done by 51 votes.
900462731593216000 2017-08-23 21:00:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> @politico And if you have a 401k invested in the market, does that get taxed now?
900462475199512580 2017-08-23 20:59:18 UTC <parabolicmirro> @politico If part of the tax plan is to shift corporate tax burden to the shareholders, won't that negatively impact the stock market? 1/2

900393137037856768 2017-08-23 16:23:47 UTC <parabolicmirro> @WBUR That was the consolation prize after his neo-nazis were run out of Boston.
900328770569220096 2017-08-23 12:08:00 UTC <parabolicmirro> @bill_auclair Just another "fine person" to defend.

900167243195195392 2017-08-22 01:26:09 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ppppolls @MaddowBlog Astounding that its still 37%. It just shows how successful the propaganda machine is.
900051236359221253 2017-08-22 17:45:11 UTC <parabolicmirro> @mmfa The bar for this administration has been set so low.
900037065450115074 2017-08-22 16:48:52 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind When you've believed "government is the problem" for so many years, then that sounds pretty appealing.
899221492659093505 2017-08-20 10:48:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> @BBCWorld That had the promise of being an interesting article, instead it was two minutes of music and factoids w no real story.
899021840663949314 2017-08-19 21:34:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump ICYMI: You are the source of these White Supremicists coming out of the sewers. That 20K in Boston is just as much against you! #impeach45
898920253933178880 2017-08-19 14:51:04 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SpeakerRyan Opioid addiction requires treatment not punishment. Stop trying to slash Medicaid, save the #ACA, and resign to boost the everyone's morale.
898886350916775936 2017-08-19 12:36:21 UTC <parabolicmirro> @JoyAnnReid I noticed Jerrod considers himself a "moderate Republican," considering how extremely right the party shifted under #45 that may be accurate
898627066442035200 2017-08-18 19:26:02 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VedEnvy @peterdaou Peter, your non stop Bernie bashing is the reason I stopped following you. Let 2016 go, you're as obsessed as 45. Time to unite not fight.
898524870736199681 2017-08-18 12:39:57 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump While you enable domestic terrorists by taking them off watch lists and equate neo-nazis with those brave enough to stand against them.
898138769165078529 2017-08-17 11:05:43 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump In other words: "He said mean things about me, I don't like him anymore."
898137322771931136 2017-08-17 10:59:58 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Your own words damn you, whether it's about racism, Russiagate or any other subject. I hope Mueller gets you on the stand. #impeach45

894634227295244288 2017-08-07 18:59:55 UTC <parabolicmirro> @joncoopertweets @VedEnvy @MKlave Especially when you add the fact that 39 states were hacked, and amateurs were able to hack electronic voting machines.
894521312798011392 2017-08-07 11:31:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Keep telling yourself that, you keep busy with your rallies while Mueller does his job. #ImpeachTrump
894243634358480897 2017-08-06 17:07:51 UTC <parabolicmirro> @TomPerez @Eiregirl_420ppl There are two articles for you to alleviate your ignorance. There are dozens of sources across countries. One way to spot real news.

894210889599119361 2017-08-06 14:57:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @TomPerez We need paper ballots and automatic recounts for every election. Dems should make this a major issue going into 2018. 2/2
894210489395412992 2017-08-06 14:56:08 UTC <parabolicmirro> @TomPerez I hope the Dems have a serious plan to protect the integrity of the #2018 elections. 39 states hacked, electronic voter machines hacked 1/2
893906597667381248 2017-08-05 18:48:35 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind Can we get them carved into stone tablets, in case #Trump collapses civilization before the impeachment?
893860779446939648 2017-08-05 15:46:31 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Amy_Siskind At least the Senate is not allowing him any chance for recess appts.
893797457368420352 2017-08-05 11:34:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @funder Is there anyone in the #GOP not beholden to #Russia ?
893657574997979138 2017-08-04 02:19:03 UTC <parabolicmirro> For the record: If the Dems support anti abortion candidates, they will not see another dime from me. @SenSchumer @SenateDems @dccchttps://twitter.com/CecileRichards/status/893471814084702209
893595479900123136 2017-08-04 22:12:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> @BarackObama Happy Birthday! We miss you as President!
893502176101892096 2017-08-04 16:01:33 UTC <parabolicmirro> @Medium @adamcbest I also like all 3, except I think we need a new face for 2020 and not a rerun. I won't bash any Dem unless there's evidence of wrongdoing.
893235735091961856 2017-08-03 22:22:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> So if the systems were hacked, Russia could have deleted Dems from the rolls and possibly invalidated their votes.https://twitter.com/ProgressWeekly/status/893158536565448704
893087242188673024 2017-08-03 12:32:45 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou I've seen a bunch of attacks on Bernie, many shared by you. I've seen some bot attacks on Kamala, but nothing compared to the Bernie bashing
892922045079715840 2017-08-02 01:36:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump So add Sports Illustrated to your list of "fake" (meaning accurate) news sources.
892828843588898819 2017-08-02 19:25:58 UTC <parabolicmirro> Its never good to have a court decide which religions are "real."https://twitter.com/AP_Oddities/status/892818566952693763
892826890419007488 2017-08-02 19:18:13 UTC <parabolicmirro> @davidfrum @EliotACohen So the good news is that Higgins was fired, the bad news is #Trump has a new candidate for AG. (I hope I'm joking.)
892718224797597696 2017-08-02 12:06:25 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump  what he said.https://twitter.com/MichaelSkolnik/status/892709526289469440
892486572410621952 2017-08-01 20:45:55 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ibwells2 WTF?
892469106125000706 2017-08-01 19:36:30 UTC <parabolicmirro> @chapien This is the first I've heard of Kamala being transphobic, do you have any documentation on this?
892423921554903040 2017-08-01 16:36:57 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump I want you to keep incriminating yourself, just don't get us into a nuclear war. #ImpeachTrump
892162793755070464 2017-07-31 23:19:20 UTC <parabolicmirro> @AlexMLeo MACA!
892056261759578113 2017-07-31 16:16:01 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You do realize that since you haven't passed any significant legislation, you're still coasting on Obama's policies
891996791079612416 2017-07-31 12:19:42 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Are you advocating Congress Ins for all? I would support you on that!
891796962147749888 2017-07-30 23:05:39 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou You might be offended by the concept, but @BernieSanders is far more principled then most of the Dems.
891644595569905664 2017-07-30 13:00:12 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenateDems @SenSchumer Thank you Senators! Hopefully, McConnell will work with you now to fix the #ACA.
891634502346444800 2017-07-30 12:20:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Give it up! Its time to work with @SenSchumer  and fix the #ACA! The world would applaude that!
891618306939125761 2017-07-30 11:15:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump China also owns a large portion of our national debt, the same way you owe Putin. If they cash out our economy will plummet. #impeach45
891346021275631617 2017-07-29 17:13:46 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump How about we stop throwing temper tantrums and actually work with the Dems to fix the #ACA, then you can have some chocolate cake!
891268260385173506 2017-07-29 12:04:46 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Read the bills you actually sign! Kates Law was just an attack on immigrants and great healthcare? Not in any Trumpcare version! #impeach45
891267284030947329 2017-07-29 12:00:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Hmm, there's this word: compromise, which you, Ryan and Mitch need to look up. It's a magic word, like bipartisanship. #impeach45
891266225543798785 2017-07-29 11:56:41 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump ICYMI Mitch couldn't get 50 Republican votes to pass your #Trumpcare disaster. It's not the process at fault, it's the bad bills put fwd.
891265020742574080 2017-07-29 11:51:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Aww is Donny upset about the Democratic process? Maybe you should watch Schoolhouse Rock to learn how the process works. #impeachtrump
891263750631817216 2017-07-29 11:46:51 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump No, that's just some of the blackmail they have on you. Although I think the millions of dollars you're in debt to them is better leverage.
890942973202092034 2017-07-28 14:32:12 UTC <parabolicmirro> @estherlallen @SenatorCollins Thank you Senator for being a voice of reason in this insanity.  A real debate on improving healthcare w/o tax cuts for the 1% is needed.
890898768501112833 2017-07-28 11:36:33 UTC <parabolicmirro> How come the GOP screams CONSTITUTION over 2nd Amendment, but wants to repeal all the others? @GovMikeHuckabeehttps://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/890837365891018752
890755280614588417 2017-07-27 02:06:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenJeffMerkley Can you confirm if the bill is blocking funding for abortions aside from rape, incest or danger to the mother's life?https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/890754718238220289
890754428030111744 2017-07-27 02:02:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> Reading the so called #skinnybill , four pages in it looks like abortions are not paid for except in cases of rape, incest or life danger.
890536746542354432 2017-07-27 11:38:00 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed It's an amazing, fantastic plan, and only 12.00 a year!
890536111856025600 2017-07-27 11:35:29 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump In what world does taking healthcare away from millions in order to give tax cuts to the top 1% count as "a chance to shine?!" #impeach
890300711602454528 2017-07-26 20:00:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Your ignorance and prejudice is astounding. #ImpeachTrump
890169473252163584 2017-07-26 11:18:35 UTC <parabolicmirro> @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump She's an American hero for putting country above party.
889934474485673985 2017-07-25 19:44:47 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ASlavitt @BillKristol The American people don't deserve this though.
889594763900592128 2017-07-24 21:14:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenJeffMerkley There is no other way for them to push this nightmare through.
889521401778110465 2017-07-24 16:23:23 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ashleyfeinberg I wonder how that Kool Aid tastes.
888900343941259266 2017-07-22 23:15:31 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenateDems @SenSchumer  Is there no way to stop this nonsense? #ImpeachTrumpNowhttps://twitter.com/BeauWillimon/status/888788899161681920
888729861203873792 2017-07-22 11:58:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> Not surprising. I just hope #45 doesn't get any ideas.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/888624909764755456
888451798746505219 2017-07-21 17:33:10 UTC <parabolicmirro> @jonfavs They're just attacking the CBO now, and next week we'll get the alternative facts.
888442169819901957 2017-07-21 16:54:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> Goodbye #Spicey , you were our generation's Morbo. #Futurama
888419843032178689 2017-07-21 15:26:11 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou If Mueller is fired I believe the protests will be more than the GOP can ignore.
888222055723827200 2017-07-20 02:20:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> We should trust Trump's 12.00 a year explanation instead.https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/888160545853120513
888177081833619456 2017-07-20 23:21:32 UTC <parabolicmirro> @POTUS @PressSec @VP I believe in Robert Mueller.
888143790585851904 2017-07-20 21:09:15 UTC <parabolicmirro> @crooksandliars As long as he signs whatever they put in front of him.
888125101945700354 2017-07-20 19:54:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @TheDemocrats @Grace4NY That's been my experience in #ny19. Dems need to be out front and center. I'd like to see them speak at some local protests.
888123482000678913 2017-07-20 19:48:33 UTC <parabolicmirro> @WhiteHouse @POTUS @PressSec @SenSchumer @SenateDems  please keep a tally of the regs these clowns remove so we can reinstate them when Trump's out.
888098329682423810 2017-07-20 18:08:36 UTC <parabolicmirro> @jbendery Do the proceeds go to 45's legal defense fund?
888077251719331840 2017-07-20 16:44:51 UTC <parabolicmirro> @POTUS @PressSec Except for the 32 million who will lose healthcare, or the families being torn apart be his immigration ban, or anyone non-white & non-xtian
888074877449764864 2017-07-20 16:35:25 UTC <parabolicmirro> @DHSgov @SpeakerRyan Now do something about Russian spies in the Whitehouse.
888012080342859777 2017-07-20 12:25:53 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Despite the fact that #Sessions was involved with the campaign when the #collusion was happening. No one would believe it was unbiased.
887999822153887744 2017-07-20 11:37:10 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenateDems @SenSchumer If the #GOP manages to bring this to the floor, please #Filibuster! There is too much at stake here!
887885251736764417 2017-07-19 04:01:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @PressSec Who wanted clean water or worker safety anyway? Oh yeah, all of us who aren't corporate CEO's.
887722942045577218 2017-07-19 17:16:57 UTC <parabolicmirro> @POTUS @WhiteHouse @PressSec Their best option is #UniversalHealthCare, and screw the tax cuts.
887715359108866055 2017-07-19 16:46:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump So, lunch is almost over, how's that health plan coming?  There's plenty of room for improvement. Start with keeping 23mil insured. #resist
887440873952301056 2017-07-18 22:36:06 UTC <parabolicmirro> @JohnFasoNy You should ask the #Mercers to throw you some twitter bots, so it would look like you have supporters. #WheresJohnFaso
887439986341142528 2017-07-18 22:32:35 UTC <parabolicmirro> I will gladly spread the word. It would be an honor if @NancyPelosi would address #ny19. The district you're supposed to represent.https://twitter.com/JohnFasoNy/status/887416939861213185
887438173395144707 2017-07-18 22:25:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @FoxNews @marthamaccallum @RandPaul You lost, and unless the #GOP starts working for a real healthcare solution, you will continue to lose. Repeal for tax cuts is not an option
887437303165145089 2017-07-18 22:21:55 UTC <parabolicmirro> @FIRE_THE_FOOL The Illuminati would be much better organized. I haven't ruled out Reptilians though, McConnell does resemble a turtle.
887397905723793410 2017-07-18 19:45:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump You'll need help from Putin, the bot army and all the voter suppression you can muster just to keep the seats you have. #ImpeachTrump
887396596647940096 2017-07-18 19:40:10 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump That's how our founding fathers intended it. We used to get consensus before McConnell and his "no to everything."
887282563110326272 2017-07-18 12:07:02 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump LOL! You were let down by the opposition who are trying to keep 23million from losing healthcare? Poor baby! Get Donny some cake!
887274729681412098 2017-07-18 11:35:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou Bullshit! Bernie has had a consistent message for decades. The Clintons have always been too connected to Wall St, he just highlighted that.
887273028001902592 2017-07-18 11:29:09 UTC <parabolicmirro> @HillaryClinton @peterdaou @teresainnj There is a lot of disinterest out there. 2016 had a low voter turnout and a lot of people I know feel that neither party represents them 2/2
887271667013234689 2017-07-18 11:23:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @HillaryClinton @peterdaou @teresainnj If the Dems think they have a winning strategy for 2018 or 2020, they are mistaken. The base is energized against Trump, but... 1/2
887270222515908608 2017-07-18 11:18:00 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou Because the GOP expects her to run again, so they're keeping the flames high.
887269643387326464 2017-07-18 11:15:42 UTC <parabolicmirro> Repealing the #ACA without a replacement seems like the #GOP wants to lose the Senate in 2018.
887266154036768768 2017-07-18 11:01:50 UTC <parabolicmirro> @RandPaul Fix the #ACA! Undo the damage Trump has done, and work with dems to fix its flaws.
887138160551104512 2017-07-17 02:33:14 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Dems will not join a repeal without a replacement. Even some #GOP aren't that stupid. Either fix the #ACA or go for #UniversalHealthCare.
886986251429130240 2017-07-17 16:29:36 UTC <parabolicmirro> @jbendery You're nobody on the internet until you've pissed off a White Supremecist troll, don't let it ruin your day.
886917076509745153 2017-07-17 11:54:43 UTC <parabolicmirro> @AlexMLeo We're only 7 months in to Trump's term. Let's see if their opinions change in two years when nothing improves in their town.
886555966933794816 2017-07-16 11:59:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter what your cronies say, there are paper trails now. Impeachment is only a matter of time. #ImpeachTrump

886351110809808898 2017-07-15 22:25:47 UTC <parabolicmirro> @TopherSpiro @jonfavs @JWGOP A lot more thought and work goes into the studying thr zodiac than was ever put into  Cruzcare or Trumpcare.
886293568670883845 2017-07-15 18:37:07 UTC <parabolicmirro> @VP When the CBO backs your claim, I'll believe you. Right now all I believe is that your pants are on fire. #SavetheACA #resist #Pence
886291977452605442 2017-07-15 18:30:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Next week the Senate will ignore the AMA, AARP, millions of Americans and even some ins. companies, to give the 1% a tax break. #resist

885816473058512897 2017-07-14 11:01:19 UTC <parabolicmirro> Yes, people really hated all that affordable healthcare. Good thing you're liberating them from it. (That's sarcasm, it's confusing, I know)https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/885772727315030020
885178898983604224 2017-07-12 16:47:50 UTC <parabolicmirro> @mmfa WTF? Even for Fox that's a stretch.

885097703117553666 2017-07-12 11:25:11 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Like when you said Everyone at G20 was talking about Podesta? NYT, WP & Maddow produce hard evidence of your family's crimes. #ImpeachTrump
884958510240366592 2017-07-11 02:12:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ShaunKing @ClaraJeffery Of course! And if Trump survives, there will be a pardon at the end of his tenure.
884953080781033472 2017-07-11 01:50:30 UTC <parabolicmirro> But what I fear will be that after two years of stalled investigations, the new Democratic majority will say: "We're moving forward" 3/3

872777408847458304 2017-06-08 11:28:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @AlexMLeo A lot of ex cons are patients where I work. They all wanted those work details for the chance to be outside, but they were paid 15 cents/hr.
872775897769758720 2017-06-08 11:22:44 UTC <parabolicmirro> @GOP @gregolear That's the most optimistic version I can believe in.
872759341920792576 2017-06-08 10:16:56 UTC <parabolicmirro> @FedUpInNY19 @RepJohnFaso claims he hasn't heard from anyone in his district, but he won't hold any town halls to listen to us! #wheresJohnFaso
872626552424603648 2017-06-07 01:29:17 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump @peterdaou This is exactly what I expect as well. Even if the Dems take over in #2018, I have no faith in their courage to do the right thing.
872045250927263746 2017-06-06 10:59:24 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump As for tax cuts forget them! No tax cuts for the rich! Invest the money in infrastructure instead of selling it to the Saudis. #resist
872044583898816512 2017-06-06 10:56:45 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump The only "right" would be #UniversalHealthCare or at least ditching #Trumpcare  and fixing the #ACA.

870357228875862016 2017-06-01 19:11:48 UTC <parabolicmirro> @jbendery Why did the NYT give a climate denier a column? As long as the media treats science as entertainment for ratings, we will see this crap.
870252618001592320 2017-06-01 12:16:07 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump This is your dementia. The BIG story is your collusion with Putin to steal the election. #impeach

869159559063097344 2017-05-29 11:52:41 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou Here's a perfect example of Dem silence. They're afraid of the NRA, so we only hear tough talk when a major crisis happens.

869156323958693889 2017-05-29 11:39:50 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou The Dems as a party need a message. Right now that message is "We're  better than these a-holes, but not by much."
869155622465536000 2017-05-29 11:37:03 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou But what ARE the Dems doing? Aside from Pelosi endorsing 15.00 min wage, I hear nothing, except from the most liberal members like Warren.
868813353526984704 2017-05-28 12:56:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SpeakerRyan Is that going to be your excuse when you eliminate the VA next year?

858023229092487173 2017-04-28 18:20:53 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SpeakerRyan @FinancialCmte You've been trying to repeal it since it passed. A sure sign that it's doing a lot of good, like the ACA.
858002291143716865 2017-04-28 16:57:41 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ZephyrTeachout Is there anyone up for election in Ulster County this year? I tried an online search recently and found nothing.
857769927679365121 2017-04-27 01:34:22 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SpeakerRyan Yes, now the #Republicans can screw them over directly, as the #Trump admin has already started doing.
857677706431004672 2017-04-27 19:27:54 UTC <parabolicmirro> @GeorgeTakei Would Fox have done that if the remark was about Hillary or Chelsea?
857556887964975104 2017-04-27 11:27:49 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou It's just more proof that GS controls both parties.
855796858144395265 2017-04-22 14:54:05 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou You sound like we're still in the primaries. Instead of Bernie bashing, how about trying to bridge the divide for  2018 and 2020?
855560846495416321 2017-04-21 23:16:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou Trump's been a criminal for years without getting arrested, so I can see why he believes that.
855559050217607169 2017-04-21 23:09:07 UTC <parabolicmirro> @mmfa Its rare to see the right wing at war with the alphabet agencies. The Dems should jump on this and be the flag waving patriots.

854664189943709696 2017-04-19 11:53:16 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou @jkfecke With all due respect, #HillaryClinton had her shot, so did #BernieSanders. We need a new candidate in #2020 or we will lose again.
854662762244571136 2017-04-19 11:47:36 UTC <parabolicmirro> @armandodkos @peterdaou Really? Because the base was and is much more energized behind #BernieSanders than it was about Hillary. Wise up Dems or we'll lose #2018.
854304032919363584 2017-04-18 12:02:08 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump Why is it that every time you slam someone, I want to run out and support them? Oh right because you're a fraud who stole the election.

853233441973972992 2017-04-15 13:07:59 UTC <parabolicmirro> @peterdaou @VABVOX This is blatantly untrue. Bernie supported Hillary immediately after she got the nomination. That's the way primaries work.

848529734803877888 2017-04-02 13:37:08 UTC <parabolicmirro> @realDonaldTrump The strength of the GOP lies in mutual greed, not love. Taking ins from 24 million is NOT motivated by love. #ACA
848528363044167680 2017-04-02 13:31:41 UTC <parabolicmirro> @ZephyrTeachout Aside from the GOP ignoring these laws, I worry that #NancyPelosi  in #2018 will say "we're moving forward" like w Bush.

832053786881511425 2017-02-15 02:27:36 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenSchumer Please make sure this investigation is bipartisan and that AG Sessions recuses himself. This is a crisis bigger than Watergate.

831945986104778753 2017-02-15 19:19:14 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SenSchumer automatic weapons aren't enough? Do they believe the 2nd amendment covers explosives too?

829776600132640768 2017-02-09 19:38:52 UTC <parabolicmirro> @SpeakerRyan giving the 1% more tax cuts won't fix anything. If you want to make a difference, raise minimum wage! #RESISTANCE
