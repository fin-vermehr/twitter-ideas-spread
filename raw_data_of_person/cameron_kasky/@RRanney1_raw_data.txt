971572596591427584 2018-03-07 02:25:32 UTC <RRanney1> @TimCary Not sure why any reputable reporter is still devoting any time to these guys. Their 15 minutes was up a long time ago, let them fade into obscurity.

971495243647455234 2018-03-07 21:18:10 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 while the AFC South is very different than it was, I don't know that the Colts roster is worse than it was when Grigson arrived and turned the roster over. That was an extremely young team with less cap room available and less veterans to build on.
971443197468700677 2018-03-07 17:51:21 UTC <RRanney1> @wolves10 @ebosshoops I thought this would end with the promise of 4 year scholarships, but then it became "they are promised a 4yr scholarship, not a 4yr ATHLETIC scholarship". Thus if the coach realizes he reached too far, the kid gets told if he wants to be on a team it will have to be elsewhere.
971058148793516032 2018-03-06 16:21:18 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 @myleshandley87 @Mauty480 Lie, Lie, Lie... It's only a sprained knee, he should be back in a few weeks, we are very fortunate. After seeding: Aww shucks... turns out the injury was worse than originally diagnosed. Our bad. No doubt Painter wouldn't go along with it, but I am sure it happens all the time.
970887475433439232 2018-03-05 05:03:07 UTC <RRanney1> @IndyStarSports I liked it better when we could just take an annual look at the graduating WAC and Mountain West o-linemen and have a decent guess at who Polian would turn from 4th-6th rounders into eventual starters.
970880001871613952 2018-03-05 04:33:25 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Wow @StacyClardie, tell us how you really feel.pic.twitter.com/BMZoTskHHp
970736883788546048 2018-03-05 19:04:43 UTC <RRanney1> @DougGriffMAX983 They have stopped playing with the sort of effort and intensity we are used to. Not sure if it is physical or mental, but for a month they've been winning off of being more talented. When games have been decided by heart Purdue has lost. Hopefully they use this time off well.
970439312255971329 2018-03-04 23:22:16 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Did he come to see them play THIS badly?
970438194604007424 2018-03-04 23:17:50 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Sounds like the backup brigade should have been in a while ago. Shots not falling is tough but the lack of effort and discipline is more concerning.

970094383059087361 2018-03-03 00:31:39 UTC <RRanney1> @DougGriffMAX983 @TheAndyKatz The games have been good. The crowds have been good. Still doesn't mean it was a good idea or that it should ever happen again. Plenty of places in and around the Midwest where the game should go before ever returning to NYC, especially w/ how it screwed league schedule.
970091129369702400 2018-03-03 00:18:43 UTC <RRanney1> @StarTrek DS9 by about a mile. Loved the other series too, but DS9 was just on another level.
970087581525446656 2018-03-03 00:04:37 UTC <RRanney1> Hate that everyone but @Cboogie_3  seems to freeze against pressure defense. Turn on the speed and push the ball! #BoilerUp
970086332784611328 2018-03-03 23:59:39 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Was worried the refs would find some way to T him up, like if he got tackled again.
970080787637956608 2018-03-03 23:37:37 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc Tangled up my ample backside, that was a tackle
970080513741459457 2018-03-03 23:36:32 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports No way that SHOULD be a double foul

970073997533642753 2018-03-03 23:10:38 UTC <RRanney1> Regardless of the outcome of the #BigTenTournament #Purdue needs to do some serious work on rebounding before the NCAAs. Effort level and hand eye coordination are both pretty sub-par on the glass on both ends.
970072352200458241 2018-03-03 23:04:06 UTC <RRanney1> @myleshandley87 @Schultz975 Kansas loses to OkSt (18-13) by 18.
970069687294939137 2018-03-03 22:53:31 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Played that awful and still came away with a lead at halftime.pic.twitter.com/YeXSs3MVXH
970064458847485952 2018-03-03 22:32:44 UTC <RRanney1> Still shocked #Purdue continues to play as well as it does when they are SOOOO often beaten on effort plays by every team they face.
970061275899289602 2018-03-03 22:20:05 UTC <RRanney1> @myleshandley87 @Schultz975 Cincinnati went from #1 in the nation to a #2 seed when Kenyon Martin got hurt. Obviously Guy ain't that good, but it shows it CAN happen. His loss and two losses to close the season would definitely give the selection committee an excuse to throw out the rankings.
970059118823333892 2018-03-03 22:11:31 UTC <RRanney1> @myleshandley87 @Schultz975 If Guy is out for long their seed plummets, but again they can always withhold and act like they are resting him for the NCAAs. As for the rest, Duke and Nova have some iffy losses recently so if they drop early league tourney games they too could fall.
970054564086009856 2018-03-03 21:53:25 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 @myleshandley87 Yep, Purdue dropped mightily due to losing Hummel to injury his junior year. Of course if they are smart they will just talk that Guy will be back, even if he won't (like Syracuse did with Arinze Onuaku the same year as Hummel's injury, retaining their #1 seed).
970051908869255169 2018-03-03 21:42:52 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 Still possible, albeit not probable, but only if other a couple other #1 seed possibilities drop early in their league tourneys.
970024242111766528 2018-03-03 19:52:56 UTC <RRanney1> @RichNye13 Technically Anunoby, Bryant, & Blackmon left on Miller's watch as did Curtis Jones, though had Crean stayed Hartman might have stuck to leaving. Would have been better in non-conference play & similar in league play, but they look better defensively going forward.

969800014179561472 2018-03-02 05:01:56 UTC <RRanney1> @tommchenry @yellowcardigan To be fair she did kick a couple kids in the crotch, drill a dentist's thumb, and burn down a police station. Not too delicate, but then makes her relationship with her ex more of a headscratcher.
969798817674645504 2018-03-02 04:57:10 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 Seems like the #Colts stand a better chance of being on the receiving end of a Ditka-esque trade than be the one shelling out picks. Like last time they might love their choice too much to drop (last time it was Edgerrin James, this time it better be Chubb not Barkley).
969796209295716352 2018-03-02 04:46:48 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 Then Colts own a prime piece of real estate for whichever team wants the top QB. Seriously, that pick SHOULD be worth a lot in that scenario, even the Browns might have to give up something big just to block other teams from jumping there.
969783548470276096 2018-03-02 03:56:30 UTC <RRanney1> @purduebass Would be nice. Even a bull fighter ol would be better than the half hearted effort that just leads to enough contact to draw the whistle but make the shot no harder.

969780552357302272 2018-03-02 03:44:35 UTC <RRanney1> Is it just me or does it seem like Ryan Cline has more and one fouls than anyone on #Purdue?
969769552493076480 2018-03-02 03:00:53 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports They have blamed Crean for the poor talent at their disposal, yet they've ridiculously overhyped their players. As bad a coach as Crean is, I am guessing he would have lost less non-conference games and had IU finish similarly in league play.
969689575856762887 2018-03-02 21:43:05 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports @NicoleAuerbach Lame. I am sure it will limit some injuries (most seem to happen to blockers and tacklers, so those will still potentially occur) but it will also mean very few exciting returns on special teams as some coaches will give guys the freedom to try but most will demand a fair catch.
969661444232015874 2018-03-02 19:51:18 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 I'm just excited he might have convinced the top 2 teams he is too good to pass up so that we won't have the chance to take him. No way we need to take a top 3 pick on a running back. We could probably trade a 2nd rounder for a current starter if it is that big a need.
969412395780202496 2018-03-01 03:21:40 UTC <RRanney1> @boiler149 @tbeindit What about the "survivors"? What do you owe them? You think the victims of your former (and future) players give a damn about you winning?
969329416466763776 2018-03-01 21:51:56 UTC <RRanney1> @JasonSpells A bit like the attempt to get refunds for the fans because of NFL players kneeling. Thankfully our state legislators weren't stupid enough to pass that nonsense (even if the mere notion of it being proposed was embarrassing enough).
969328645293649920 2018-03-01 21:48:52 UTC <RRanney1> @kgrant5 ..and starting in February. Not sure how the league brass saw almost any of this as a good idea. Sure lots of guys will now get to say they played or coached in MSG, but it was hardly worth all the headaches to get to this point (unless the rest before NCAAs ends up a big deal).
969299349514616832 2018-03-01 19:52:28 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich why did it take that long to "figure it out"? Didn't MSU show it only takes an hour or so to conduct a "thorough" investigation?
969261337057558530 2018-03-01 17:21:25 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Luck is where he is, he's at where he's at, was that Dr. Seuss? No, Chris Ballard said that.
968948457343012869 2018-02-28 20:38:09 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Marijuana seems to have more public support but enjoys stronger opposition than sports betting (big pharma and liquor lobby having deeper pockets than the lottery and local casinos). Can't see either having enough push to get even close to legalized in a decade though.
968917802395545601 2018-02-28 18:36:20 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich similar to NCAA Football and Basketball games from EA, most guys thought it was awesome they were in a video game, people whined, now it's gone

968289507605958658 2018-02-26 00:59:43 UTC <RRanney1> @WTHRcom No. Will come to grips with it if they make the pick, but it is a bad call with the kinds of needs on this team and the devaluation of the running back position. Yes, it is phenomenal to have an elite back, but then you have to pay them and they have to stay healthy.
968258575079477249 2018-02-26 22:56:48 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle @dandakich @MikeWritesSport Everything I saw said he was expelled from his local school Edgewood Catholic (for using his member as a typing tool), attended LaLumiere for one year then returned to Edgewood.
968257798487396352 2018-02-26 22:53:43 UTC <RRanney1> @peterp2000 @JayBilas So your pals got busted alongside a lesser program and you didn't hold that program to a different standard, what a hero. I will give you that you are consistent, you are just consistently wrong. You want to ruin college basketball for the 1% who don't even want to be there.
968256093502758912 2018-02-26 22:46:56 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Opening this up to pay players just takes something dirty and makes it way worse. The rich get richer, the poor basically get forced to drop to a lower division. Eventually college ball turns into the G league or AAU, and at that point much of the money disappears with the fans.
968253476743630848 2018-02-26 22:36:32 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 Important to stay angry and keep pointing out the stupidity, or in 5-10 years they will revisit this nonsense and think "it really wasn't THAT bad".
968223660652793856 2018-02-26 20:38:04 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Guys who are adamant they deserve to be paid now should be kept away from the NCAA. Athletes who have no interest in being students shouldn't be able to skate by for a few semesters on a fake courseload.
968219124949188608 2018-02-26 20:20:02 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling You pay the players then Congress should pull their non-profit status. Better call is to convince the NBA to get rid of the one & done rule and make it tougher for kids to go that route (be it going back to freshman ineligibility, or simply enforcing REAL academic requirements).
968217837838983169 2018-02-26 20:14:55 UTC <RRanney1> @JayBilas @peterp2000 THANK YOU! If this were mid or low tier schools he'd want the book thrown at them, since it is the blue bloods everyone wants to change the rules to accommodate how they operate.
968212133866598401 2018-02-26 19:52:15 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich MSU still has nothing to say about past football and basketball sexual assaults either. I guess Miles Bridges is more important than the "survivors"
968199906224754689 2018-02-26 19:03:40 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich apparently Farley attended La Lumiere for only one year as he was expelled from Edgewood Catholic (Madison, WI) for entertaining his classmates by typing with his... ...lets just say not his hands, feet, elbows, nose...

968024015423066119 2018-02-25 07:24:44 UTC <RRanney1> @Weather_West Glad it is Europe enjoying the cold weather rather than North America, mostly for selfish reasons but also because we won't have to listen to republicans claim they "could use some of that global warming about now".
967955586951368706 2018-02-25 02:52:50 UTC <RRanney1> @DanaONeilWriter @PeteThamel Headline seems misleading, appears NCAA is more drawn to his "success" than his "tactics". Shouldn't they show at least a LITTLE interest in how the loaded teams continue to find All-Americans willing to ride the bench or take tiny roles as freshmen?
967858134546046976 2018-02-25 20:25:35 UTC <RRanney1> @DanFahey10 Cough, cough, Larry Nassar, cough...
967602537619775489 2018-02-24 03:29:56 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Is it bad I keep seeing tweets about Gov. Holcomb declaring disaster emergency for flood counties and expect one of them to be a disaster emergency for Indy's pothole crisis?
967492434161799169 2018-02-24 20:12:26 UTC <RRanney1> @insidethehall @Symatika_ Based on the handling of the Nassar nonsense and the allegations against your FB and BB players, how can any MSU fan act like their athletic department has any shred of credibility? Enjoy your soon to be vacated league title.
967443510981996544 2018-02-24 16:58:01 UTC <RRanney1> @franfraschilla Still can't stand how many people have said for decades that this sort of stuff happening is the worst kept secret in sports. Yet it always seems to take an outside entity to expose it for the media and NCAA to pursue it. Even then the punishment is often too soft.
967441909089296384 2018-02-24 16:51:39 UTC <RRanney1> @jemelehill Given those choices I vote ineligible players and fired coaches. No reason to cater to the 1% pretending to be amateurs, big money would still be there without them and for most schools that revenue is all that keeps 100s of other athletes on scholarship.
967440460385062913 2018-02-24 16:45:54 UTC <RRanney1> Can't stand that the #NCAAHoopsScandal is somehow generating more support for paying athletes. Guys are cheating so the solution is to pay them? They know what they are signing up for, if they don't like it they can play overseas. Don't screw things up for the 99% who are clean.
967179351111462912 2018-02-23 23:28:21 UTC <RRanney1> @espn @BoiledSports At least they are admitting it finally. Nothing worse than the constant denials of something so blatantly obvious. Now if we could just get the officials to admit they have absolutely no idea how to officiate Isaac Haas...
967175899773919233 2018-02-23 23:14:38 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 IU fans claim they were behind Sampson firing? Go back & re-watch that last game he coached (against Purdue) Assembly Hall was hardly "against him" (students especially). Even on social media most IU fans seemed to just be whining "just phone calls!" Anger came later.
967162261151322118 2018-02-23 22:20:26 UTC <RRanney1> @MySportsUpdate @NFLfootballinfo @ojdons @R__D__3 Depends who they signed to offset it, in this case I am guessing the NFL saw Mike Glennon's addition essentially cancelling out the loss of Jeffery (again they are comparing contracts, not on field impact).
967156369026617344 2018-02-23 21:57:01 UTC <RRanney1> @MySportsUpdate @NFLfootballinfo @ojdons Might have happened more than once, but the weirdest thing I recall with compensatory picks was Philly gaining a 3rd round pick for Jeremiah Trotter even though he rejoined their team after only being with the Redskins for one season.
967153871004078081 2018-02-23 21:47:06 UTC <RRanney1> @MySportsUpdate @NFLfootballinfo @ojdons Basically comes down to they lost more than they added in free agency last season (mostly decided by contract value, not actual production). Doesn't count guys cut, just guys whose contracts ended and they signed with another team.
967147886009085953 2018-02-23 21:23:19 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 Hanover was a gorgeous campus, but felt a little Twilight Zone-esque, like you'd stepped out of time to a college campus in the Conner Prairie days.
967139794194194432 2018-02-23 20:51:10 UTC <RRanney1> @Andy_Staples @unclejohn1000 How many people are going to G league games? You make college basketball pay for play that is what it becomes. On the other end of the spectrum it essentially becomes high school basketball (which is essentially how it started) and lots of people go to those games.
967139157805092865 2018-02-23 20:48:38 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich does Andrew get additional merchandise and gifts from going to the postseason or any of their exempted tournaments? I know football players get them from bowl games, wasn't sure if basketball was similar.
967137934309842944 2018-02-23 20:43:46 UTC <RRanney1> @1070thefan @dandakich But Dan they are living off of Ramen and going to bed hungry at night (probably crying into their arm sleeve tats). Someone call Sally Struthers and Sarah McLaughlin, we need a commercial for these poor kids.
967137120887476230 2018-02-23 20:40:32 UTC <RRanney1> @mikefreemanNFL Hopefully with Metallica playing loudly in the background, random explosions, and Tina Turner in an elevated position laughing maniacally the whole time.
967120255804936192 2018-02-23 19:33:31 UTC <RRanney1> @BTNBrentYarina Will be insane the sort of style change we could see from the Boilers. So much more athleticism, but lots of experience, passing, and skill lost. Still feel like the potential is there to stay a very good team, but the drop-off is much bigger than losing Biggie was.
967111826600284161 2018-02-23 19:00:02 UTC <RRanney1> @jdemling @Katie_George05 Problem being you end up with schools and boosters providing fake jobs in order to funnel players money, and they use that to gain a recruiting advantage as well. Players aren't going hungry unless they are just being dumb with their stipend.
967107556652011520 2018-02-23 18:43:04 UTC <RRanney1> @Andy_Staples Guessing more people would pay to watch walk-on basketball than the version of semi-pro ball Jay Bilas and many others seem to be lobbying for. It would be a shame if it had to go that far, but would prefer that end of the spectrum to the alternative.
966417555362603008 2018-02-21 21:01:15 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Certainly would have given him better job prospects and might have given IU a bit more options as well (assuming all the kids who eventually bolted for the NBA wouldn't have just done so a year sooner).
966416722486968320 2018-02-21 20:57:56 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Suing oneself seems like something Donald Trump or Al Davis might have tried at one point.
966416362854928385 2018-02-21 20:56:30 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 Seems plausible the 2nd hand Drakkar exposure could end up with Liam Neeson mistaking MJB for one of the bad guys and inflicting massive head trauma while trying to save his abducted 3rd cousin once removed.
966414712417210368 2018-02-21 20:49:57 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Wouldn't the NCAA need to sue you THEN you sue Pitino to make it a true circle? If nothing else it'd be intriguing to know just what one would have say to warrant a lawsuit from the NCAA. They take an endless barrage of bad press (much deserved) with little to no response.
966412635892830209 2018-02-21 20:41:42 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle Talent can be wasted, and in the case of injuries it isn't necessarily through any fault of the individual. Would it seem absurd to say Bob Sanders was the most talented defensive back in Colts history (in spite of his too brief tenure)?

966279300172402689 2018-02-21 11:51:52 UTC <RRanney1> @BarstoolPU Won't have to vacate. Like with UNC they let pretty much everyone join in the abuse and cover-up, so they really didn't show preferential treatment to athletes. If somehow they do win a national title Izzo will have the audacity to claim it helps the survivors in their healing.
966277419400335360 2018-02-21 11:44:24 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc Here I assumed this was going to be video of Cards players who went out and paid for their own prostitutes, you know the real victims in all of this.
966171906541080576 2018-02-20 04:45:07 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Such an inspiration. Can't wait for the movie to come out. Thoughts and prayers to those young men and the fans of Sexual Assault U.
964494130280894465 2018-02-16 13:38:14 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle Times like this I really do fear that the issue isn't just political, its that somehow a large part of the nation is missing the capacity for common sense. Make any logical argument you want, they will always cling to "Is it a gun? Then I have a right to it".
964318617188950022 2018-02-15 02:00:49 UTC <RRanney1> Why do #Purdue fans always wait for the bottom to fall out? Because it always does.
964240100254154753 2018-02-15 20:48:49 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @ProducerKyle People bringing up someone has to swing the club. Yes. But... how many are you going to kill with one swing? How far from each victim can you be? How hard would it be to disarm you? It is like telling a child they can't have ice cream and they claim you are trying to starve them.

963647589215293440 2018-02-13 05:34:23 UTC <RRanney1> Apparently massive outtages, yet you cannot spare one intern to tweet... "we are aware of the problem and are working on it?! @Ask_Spectrum

961050101803372544 2018-02-06 01:32:54 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 @BMurphySports The dbag hired assistants for a job he has now backed out on and strung us along to the point we missed on other canidates. He has made the job fairly toxic and a lot harder to recruit to. He deserves every ounce of crap that gets flung his way.
961048673688879104 2018-02-06 01:27:13 UTC <RRanney1> @jakequery Hopefully he gets the Jim Caldwell Colts treatment (sans the Super Bowl run, just the injury plagued epic collapse leading to an unceremonious exit).

961045092533460992 2018-02-06 01:13:00 UTC <RRanney1> @FOX59 @mchappell51 Gotta imagine his "assistant coaches" are pretty furious as well, as some of them probably missed out on other opportunities and have now shown their current employers they have one foot out the door.

960653199668600832 2018-02-05 23:15:45 UTC <RRanney1> @Espngreeny Does make no sense. If he didn't play at all, then injury or disciplinary reasons are plausible. Only alternative seems to be it was a schematic decision, yet the way the game played out makes it seem impossible he could have done any worse than the guys who replaced him.
960630159903744003 2018-02-05 21:44:12 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports He was the prettiest girl from the group no one else wanted to dance with. It was just a bad year to be in the market for a head coach. Had a little hope for more when the media started talking about Tomlin outstaying his welcome in Pittsburgh but that died down fast.

In any event NFL chances might be the same. Tough call.
959135094991663106 2018-02-01 18:43:21 UTC <RRanney1> @MattGlenesk As I said, it has been a great improvement (I started up a subscription months ago after cancelling my last one about a decade ago), but it will take time to shake the "IU Star" label that was earned with decades of disproportionate and biased coverage.
959130493080997888 2018-02-01 18:25:03 UTC <RRanney1> @MattGlenesk https://twitter.com/MarkMontieth/status/957873195130015745?ref_src=twcamp%5Ecopy%7Ctwsrc%5Eandroid%7Ctwgr%5Ecopy%7Ctwcon%5E7090%7Ctwterm%5E2
959130324054806531 2018-02-01 18:24:23 UTC <RRanney1> @MattGlenesk Mark Montieth acknowledged the disproportionate coverage (chalking it up to the larger number of IU fans) and while the balance has gotten vastly better it will take awhile to shake the skepticism and hatred the Indystar has built up in most of Purdue's fanbase.
958818948383985667 2018-01-31 21:47:05 UTC <RRanney1> @Rachel__Nichols So much for their hopes of signing him to a long term deal. No chance he will overlook this perceived "slight" even if it would have sent him to a better LA team than the one he so desperately wants.
958816386675085312 2018-01-31 21:36:55 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Glad for the earlier starts to the spring game. Seemed like in the past it was always the same weekend as the NFL draft, which was a bitter pill to swallow for rabid football fans.

958030802671063040 2018-01-29 17:35:17 UTC <RRanney1> @JWReamer Agreed. Any Spartan fans over the age of 30 outraged about this now have little excuse as the rest of the league's fans were railing on this stuff at the time and their fanbase was just victim shaming and saying if anything really happened those guys would be in jail.

They might have pens and microphones in their hands instead of pompoms but their efforts make it easier for IU to recruit
957866667446603777 2018-01-28 06:43:04 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz @TriciaWhitaker @eberwein23 @jakequery @Schultz975 @MarkMontieth To be fair Purdue has spent decades being treated as the lesser program by Indy media. No, not all of the media is biased, but the amount of content has long favored the Hoosiers. Do you honestly think IU would be getting the same coverage if roles were reversed and they were #3?
957431686765142016 2018-01-27 01:54:37 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Certainly hope they do. Far more impactful players to have at 3 than a running back. The position just isn't what it once was in terms of value, you have to have 2 or 3 to protect against injuries and you can find them later in the draft.
956977081329610752 2018-01-26 19:48:10 UTC <RRanney1> @drwilliams131 @amschroer Is the Boilermaker Special available?
956973091514650624 2018-01-26 19:32:19 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich obviously different than an actual game, but Purdue played WVU in a secret scrimmage to start the year and won comfortably:https://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports/wvu/news-begins-to-bubble-around-wvu-hoops-season/article_17a7c7ae-eb9f-54a1-8cc5-2633efd66fca.html
956737184316428288 2018-01-25 03:54:54 UTC <RRanney1> May have led to some worsening heart health for Boilermaker fans, but that epic back and forth game  came at a great time with @BoilerFootball junior day visitors in the house. #BoilerUp
956729791683727360 2018-01-25 03:25:32 UTC <RRanney1> @stephenasmith @FirstTake Good lord. Stop playing backseat GM and let your front office build a team. Certainly in the conversation for GOAT, but Lebron should lose some respect for the way he keeps trying to micromanage his front office.
956727615460659200 2018-01-25 03:16:53 UTC <RRanney1> Is it ridiculous to think #CaptainMarvel suit is green because they are going to change the color in post production? A little cringeworthy (Green Lantern?) perhaps, but might explain why.

956713840783364096 2018-01-25 02:22:09 UTC <RRanney1> @mchappell51 Agreed. You can get by without a great pass rusher if the rest of your defense is extremely good, but a top tier pass rusher can often make an average defense look good or a decent one look great.

955522692576436224 2018-01-22 19:28:57 UTC <RRanney1> @TonyD1070 If you go by Nebraska's streak then it is still going due to having a practice squad player on the Pats roster. They continue to claim theirs is still ongoing in spite of 2 consecutive years of only practice squad players (2014 & 2015 if I recall correctly).
955419758140317698 2018-01-22 12:39:55 UTC <RRanney1> @BoilerFootball @IndyStarSports Fairly certain a couple years ago Nebraska pinned their own Super Bowl streak on the back of a practice squad player. If they can, why not Purdue as well? Does seem flimsy, but I don't recall anyone in the media calling them out for it.
955204290817257472 2018-01-21 22:23:44 UTC <RRanney1> Is it bad that on reviews the guessing isn't "which way will the call go?" but rather "which obscure rule will they pull out of their butts to favor the Pats?" Shocked they didn't say he had secured the ball to his hip #JAXvsNE
955184843284938752 2018-01-21 21:06:27 UTC <RRanney1> Good thing we have announcers to constantly tell us how great Brady and Belichick are as they trail by two scores.

954768643262427136 2018-01-20 17:32:37 UTC <RRanney1> @theoriginalhaas, if he gets the chance, could end up a better pro than college player. He simply cannot do anything without being called for a foul.

954149703561744384 2018-01-18 00:33:11 UTC <RRanney1> @WhitlockJason Seems pretty relevant given the nature of the President's base. The moral high ground seems to be willing to overlook anything so long as it keeps guns in their hands, lowers taxes, and makes oppressing minorities great again. oops, I meant makes "America" great again...
954147689096196096 2018-01-18 00:25:10 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Pass rusher. Lots of teams do well with running backs picked in the 3rd round or later, only a handful of pass rushers excel picked after that. Also running backs tend to have a shorter career these days than rush ends.
953714783211147264 2018-01-17 19:44:58 UTC <RRanney1> @timkaine Absolute disgrace. No chance even a month would be tolerated anywhere in the lower 48, no reason our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico should be getting so much less respect.
953703363635568640 2018-01-17 18:59:35 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Do you think IU is actually better than Maryland, or is it more about the difficulty of their respective conference schedules to this point?
953685615547166721 2018-01-17 17:49:04 UTC <RRanney1> @franfraschilla Coaches will hate it but they certainly won't get behind themselves sitting out for a year before moving jobs, so it only seems fair players enjoy similar freedom of mobility. No question, there will be cheating and it will decimate lesser conference teams.
953354569467211776 2018-01-16 19:53:36 UTC <RRanney1> Record may not reflect it, but I love the way the @Colts are building under Chris Ballard. Defense has more solid individual pieces than this point last year. Defense needs a playmaker or 2 from draft, pick up some solid FAs at OL, RB, and a wideout and they are back above .500.
953351199713120257 2018-01-16 19:40:13 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar I don't agree with your article entirely, but I like it. McDaniels with a healthy Luck is a step in the right direction. However it is far from a sure thing, and part of why it looks good at all is because there are so few other options.
953338142299389952 2018-01-16 18:48:19 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich why are there so few quality NFL head coaching options available these days? In previous years there were a lot more obvious assistants on the rise. Are too many failed head coaches taking OC & DC jobs or is good coaching in short supply like great QBs?
952042605646352384 2018-01-12 05:00:19 UTC <RRanney1> @Mark_J_Boyle No.
951912210858725377 2018-01-12 20:22:11 UTC <RRanney1> @Mark_J_Boyle Because 36% of us are apparently complete & total morons who are willing to overlook pretty much anything so long as we pay less taxes (with no regard for the fact we will end up paying a hell of a lot more in the long run and probably be left in apocalyptic cesspool). Thats why.
951654412828672000 2018-01-11 03:17:47 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Would anyone in their right mind have given them a chance in Luck/Pagano/Grigson's 1st year? Yes the division was worse, but then again the team was even worse the year prior and most of the vets were cut in offseason cap moves. Now at least SOME experience & foundation remains.
951588760772317188 2018-01-11 22:56:54 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 I still feel like Hope might have had a chance to succeed if he'd have had better resources at his disposal. He had a fraction of the budget or facilities Hazell had and yet took Purdue to two bowl games.
951586155044237312 2018-01-11 22:46:33 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 I'm still shocked at the way Hope hasn't gained more respect from Purdue faithful (even those who hated Morgan Burke with a passion towards the end of his run) and it makes me sick to hear people lump the two together in the "Hope/Hazell years" as tho they were at all similar.
951531871967555584 2018-01-11 19:10:51 UTC <RRanney1> Sick of the constant talk about paying college athletes. The amount being "exploited" is a drastically small %. For that tiny number we'd kill the golden goose & make tens of thousands of kids pay their own way every year, because the #NCAA went semi-pro?
951512385440964608 2018-01-11 17:53:25 UTC <RRanney1> @SheaGoodpaster @rtv6 @JuliePursley6 Weird. Both stores seemed fairly busy any time I've gone there. Neither seemed as well maintained as the 96th St store though.

951272708431581184 2018-01-10 02:01:02 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 It is the fact that he and the Bears feel the need to boost his credibility by saying he was the guy we wanted and they got him. Fact is he was just ONE of the guys the Colts talked to. It seems like something George Castanza would pull, not an NFL head coach.
951218042008231942 2018-01-10 22:23:48 UTC <RRanney1> @mchappell51 not that he would necessarily do things the same way again if hired by the Colts, but what was Josh McDaniels staff like in Denver?
951213758700978178 2018-01-10 22:06:47 UTC <RRanney1> @DougGriffMAX983 You are not crazy for THAT thought.
951186781629767680 2018-01-10 20:19:35 UTC <RRanney1> @Mark_J_Boyle Wow. The text version of slowly and confidently taking of your glove and using it to smack your foe into next week.
951185538492575744 2018-01-10 20:14:39 UTC <RRanney1> @Mark_J_Boyle @MarkMontieth Would be nice to see a reset at some point where coaching salaries as a whole drop significantly back to a reasonable level. If you want to get rich, go to the pros and succeed, that should be true of players and coaches. No clue how to get there though.
951184623081488384 2018-01-10 20:11:00 UTC <RRanney1> @rickbozich Yeah they just have to persevere.  ...and hope every team comes in without one of their best players or a severely diminished roster.

951181001828569088 2018-01-10 19:56:37 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich I had to stop following @GoodmanESPN and @SInow because of their near constant tweets about the Kardashians of basketball. Love Goodman's stuff, but until he gets back to actual basketball I'm not gonna follow that nonsense.
951171836255010816 2018-01-10 19:20:12 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich given how the Colts coaches butted heads with Grigson and his picks, how can you be so certain they were correct in refusing to play Wilson?
950943113585004544 2018-01-09 04:11:20 UTC <RRanney1> #BoilerUp!!! Big road win, great job @BoilerBall
950844553057132544 2018-01-09 21:39:41 UTC <RRanney1> @TheAthleticCFB @slmandel Thank you! Can't stand the way so much of the media is catering to that man and continuing to give him the attention he craves. Let him be an annoying player parent the local news can choose to talk about or ignore, he shouldn't be given anymore national air time.
950595602290704384 2018-01-08 05:10:27 UTC <RRanney1> @espn @DickieV Really do wish people would stop covering him. He is quickly making his family the Kardashians of basketball, and I can't stand the way all of the media is embracing it by continuing to provide him a platform.
950594173685698560 2018-01-08 05:04:46 UTC <RRanney1> @CharlieDaniels Hey it's nacho business
950593724798644224 2018-01-08 05:02:59 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich I can see it now... Will you please show us on this doll where Mr. Dakich hurt you? ::plaintiff points to the ears:: Is that all? ::plaintiff points to the head:: Anywhere else? ::plaintiff fights back a sob and points to the heart jury gasps audibly:: Your honor I rest my case.
950411776365088768 2018-01-08 16:59:59 UTC <RRanney1> @clubtrillion However Purdue has more wins and less losses and has gone longer without any loss.
950231171681615872 2018-01-07 05:02:20 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Its your ACL...
950110188228497409 2018-01-07 21:01:35 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz Running back just isn't the same as it once was. You can lead the league in rushing with running backs picked later in the draft. Early first round backs often put up elite yardage but they also get unsustainable pay and rarely win Super Bowls.
950103975746994176 2018-01-07 20:36:54 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar If he didn't have IU still on his list would he be getting almost any press in Indy? Obviously as a player he is deserving of accolades, but it just seems like 90% of this is just people hoping he is the next savior for the Hoosiers.
950102172083081216 2018-01-07 20:29:44 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Seems like players "buying in" has been a mantra for a long time, but usually the coaches made it seem like their approach or system was bigger than themselves. Never heard a coach sound this whiny before though, sounds like he is tattling... "they won't play with me!"
949332086351126528 2018-01-05 17:29:41 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich When this guy book come out he really say smart and stuff I think for reading 
949331402838958082 2018-01-05 17:26:58 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich there is cause for optimism with the last draft class, but most felt good about the young oline picks a couple years ago, now they have a lot of work to do there. Heres hoping that Hooker & Wilson look better with a new coach and better pass rush.
948717942111457280 2018-01-03 00:49:18 UTC <RRanney1> @timkaine I am sure you and your fellow democrats will and maybe a republican or two will join you, the rest will try to stir up patriotic support with the president.
948637908218667008 2018-01-03 19:31:16 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @Cbruce576 How much did OG play last year? Were you really excited about Blackmon & Bryant "leading" this team if they'd returned? Great talent but hardly leaders you build around. Isn't Miller a "dramatically" better coach? He may not have "his guys" but IU shouldn't be this bad.
948627777200193536 2018-01-03 18:51:01 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich say what you will about Crean and his sideline antics, but the guy coached his butt off all game. Obviously the Hoosiers lost a lot from last year, but they still have plenty of bodies and more than enough talent to play much better than this.
948299671159615488 2018-01-02 21:07:14 UTC <RRanney1> @realDonaldTrump So the US is gonna overthrow your administration? Good to hear. 2018 starting off with some hope.
948299101338259457 2018-01-02 21:04:58 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Oh for the love of god no. I'd rather take 3 3rd-5th round running backs than a #3 overall pick RB. Probably a better chance you hit on one of them and you certainly are better protected against injury.
948295278871961602 2018-01-02 20:49:47 UTC <RRanney1> @RapSheet Colts would take Avril in a heartbeat.
948293845871218689 2018-01-02 20:44:05 UTC <RRanney1> @JimIrsay @dandakich Perhaps when he says that he is referring to an actual horseshoe. He is after all rich and quite eccentric.
948239590565056512 2018-01-02 17:08:30 UTC <RRanney1> @STTimelines Absolutely ridiculous timing for this to happen, right before the event ends.
948074378352320512 2018-01-01 06:12:00 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Maybe it is just because I was just watching Rick and Morty, but I couldn't help reading your article without hearing the voice of an old mad scientist trying to explain something complicated as though it is the simplest thing in the world. Kudos.

947959736120602624 2018-01-01 22:36:27 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Did you hear Adam Schefter break the news about Bruce Arians? I saw it retweeted somewhere.
947959147345178624 2018-01-01 22:34:07 UTC <RRanney1> @JayBilas Doesn't say when. I will now wait for the announcement that Arby's is taking over the naming rights to Value City Arena. THEN the sweating really begins...
947955752894951425 2018-01-01 22:20:38 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 Six games lost by 7 points or less, that is fairly close. By the same reasoning though they were even closer to losing every game but the last one.
947542716430389249 2017-12-31 18:59:22 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Does flying off to spend extended time in the Netherlands send up any red flags to the NFL that they need to institute a "random" drug test?
947540757690437632 2017-12-31 18:51:35 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Seems likely he had some sort of treatment involving stem cells and just realizes how such baby killing witchcraft would play with such a conservative fan base.
946758967102988289 2017-12-29 15:05:02 UTC <RRanney1> @zkeefer @GreggDoyelStar hard to imagine he should break the bank, so if Luck will be back then bring Moncrief back. too many other needs to pile up more.
946757195089305600 2017-12-29 14:57:59 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Given their multitude of needs, cutting Moncrief loose makes little sense... unless Luck isn't coming back and a full rebuild is on.
946608205941170181 2017-12-28 05:05:58 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 Agreed. Let him finish his career behind a better oline elsewhere and let us start grooming younger backs for the future. If Luck and other injured players return 100% (far from certain) this may be a playoff team, but the oline will still be iffy at best.
946527811883413504 2017-12-28 23:46:30 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @GreggDoyelStar Republicans are extremely fond of claiming "the free market" fixes everything. Don't buy tickets, sell your season tickets, refuse to watch games on TV, boycott NFL advertisers. Forcing NFL players to forego their right to free speech is more disrespectful than their kneeling.

943979832836321280 2017-12-21 23:01:45 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc Regular season? Did you mean non-conference play or first semester maybe?
943914853994987520 2017-12-21 18:43:32 UTC <RRanney1> @rtv6 IPS is also asking for more money, but in this instance shouldn't you be referring to IPL?
943891720923762688 2017-12-21 17:11:37 UTC <RRanney1> @STTimelines Hate the downtime but appreciate the speedy notification admitting a problem.
943187782784167936 2017-12-19 18:34:25 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Nowhere to go but up. Young players getting snaps. Not too expensive to re-sign our own free agents. Other free agents will see easy opportunity for starting jobs. Tons of cap space. Lastly, doing a good job of locking up great draft position. #Colts positivity!
942869383264788480 2017-12-18 21:29:13 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 is Marty Schottenheimer still alive? If not, try to lure Harbough away from Michigan or get Cowher out of the broadcast booth. If Fisher is the best we can do, just bump one of the assistants up to interim coach and wait on something better.
942857542270705664 2017-12-18 20:42:10 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 maybe the Luck issues are on him more than the #Colts medical staff, but he is hardly the only one injured or the only one handled in a very questionable way. There needs to be a major overhaul there.
942092517897658368 2017-12-16 18:02:14 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 True but Purdue historically allows runs under Painter, whether by shots not falling or fouls on bigs, their defense then starts to flounder.
942092010709757954 2017-12-16 18:00:13 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 not sure I would agree with that, cynically pessimistic seems more appropriate
942091449159561216 2017-12-16 17:57:59 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 16 points isn't insurmountable , but it is nearly double their point total. So that is pretty overwhelming.
941666347431464960 2017-12-15 13:48:47 UTC <RRanney1> @SeanAstin @AjitPaiFCC @MackenzieAstin Russians dude. Russians.
941345696883593216 2017-12-14 16:34:38 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Teams that draft for need rather than value will be drafting early again the next year as well. If there is a can't miss pass rusher then that would be one thing, otherwise you take positions you cannot usually find impact players late in the draft like LT, DT, or CB.
941095323191140352 2017-12-13 23:59:44 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Often those guys take 2 or 3 years to be successful. Easy enough to deal with if you don't spend an early pick on the player, but a top 5 pick? Will agree that is too early for an OG. LT, CB, or DT are all good value picks that early (QB if Luck is still an uncertainty).

936736407342723072 2017-12-01 23:18:57 UTC <RRanney1> @IPSSchools @FOX59 @Gabby_Gonzalez Big shock, they keep pulling away from public schools but now need a ton more money to funnel into charter schools. Makes you wonder if those school board members who spent so much $$$ for their low paying posts knew there would be a payout coming later.
936732660281626624 2017-12-01 23:04:04 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc @DougHaller Players should know him from his time with ESPN (otherwise they must not really LIKE, let alone LOVE football), but even if they don't know him his personality will either draw them in or push them away really quick.
936687085372788736 2017-12-01 20:02:58 UTC <RRanney1> @Vol_Football should hire #Colts head coach Chuck Pagano. He needs a change of scenery and they need a quality hire that will end the embarrassment.
936677669999185920 2017-12-01 19:25:33 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich do we really know Basham has been a disappointment? This is the coaching staff that didn't want Freeney back and let Jerry Hughes walk. Also they refuse to play Quincy Wilson. They didn't seem to listen to Grigson why listen to Ballard?
935973788281397249 2017-11-29 20:48:35 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Thank god it was Tennessee in pursuit. If it were another SEC program we might have had to wait for more than a few hours for them to: report, celebrate, contradict, argue, and then concede. Even the Painter to Missouri stuff took waaaay longer than this to resolve itself.
935967373584207873 2017-11-29 20:23:05 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar That would be SOOOO Tennessee at this point though wouldn't it? Trying to put out a dumpster fire by throwing gas on it.
935964099099447297 2017-11-29 20:10:05 UTC <RRanney1> @BTNTomDienhart ...and a public intox! Oh wait, that somehow got cut off of Cobbs list of achievements.
935946106269327360 2017-11-29 18:58:35 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Yeah. From their perspective he makes sense, given they have swung and missed on sooooo many candidates already. For Brohm, that just looks like a dumpster fire, to jump into that just after doing such heavy lifting to get Purdue back to credibility makes little sense.
935939738929950720 2017-11-29 18:33:17 UTC <RRanney1> @bobandtom @allibreen It works so long as you look like Colonel Sanders and always walk around with either swait tay or a tall glass of lemonade while fanning yourself with a straw hat.
935938119924355073 2017-11-29 18:26:51 UTC <RRanney1> @TonyD1070 Forget number one option, if this were a football team he MIGHT be in the two deeps.
935936211096612865 2017-11-29 18:19:16 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Presumably they would at some point want him to have a decent relationship with them as a former player and arguably their greatest QB ever. As sad as Peyton's departure was, the Colts seemed to handle it well and Peyton didn't seem to hold any ill will towards them.
935934098102726656 2017-11-29 18:10:52 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Obviously the Painter "hire" at Missouri shows that these sort of pronouncements aren't always accurate, and in that instance Matt had legit reasons to bolt (and wasn't out on the road recruiting for Purdue at the time of the rumors).
935931566844465153 2017-11-29 18:00:48 UTC <RRanney1> @DanWetzel They also have crazy fans, shock jock media, unrealistic expectations, delusions of grandeur...
935926702005542912 2017-11-29 17:41:29 UTC <RRanney1> Have little doubt @JeffBrohm would find success at @Vol_Football, but their fans won't appreciate his hire and even 9-10 win seasons wouldn't be enough for them. Better to stay at Purdue, keep winning, be celebrated, and wait on the @UofLFootball job to open up.
935132081637781505 2017-11-27 13:03:56 UTC <RRanney1> @McClain_on_NFL @RoFlo @DanWetzel @BoiledSports It is certainly cringe worthy, but I don't recall hearing OSU fans upset over him as their DC (or having Larry Johnson SR on their staff either for that matter). This comes down more to the Vols fans not wanting him for football reasons and latching onto his PSU issues later.
934964629700251649 2017-11-26 01:58:33 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Poor Indiana fans. 1 win in 5 years or 14 wins in 21 years... just which is better? Also 3 of those 4 wins were in Bloomington due to a Big Ten scheduling quirk, and against Hazell which is essentially like beating a toddler at chess.
933408044381298688 2017-11-22 18:53:14 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Vince has got to lose that move, seems to get called for it constantly.
933404651659153410 2017-11-22 18:39:45 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue has got to slow it down on offense, looking way too panicked out there.
933204560755257344 2017-11-21 05:24:40 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Wouldn't 2-3am in LA essentially be the purge hours where everyone driving around is either drunk, high, or a cop (who then assumes you are one of the first two)?
933202611431292933 2017-11-21 05:16:55 UTC <RRanney1> @GoodmanESPN @RobDauster @stephenasmith and a megaphone. Give Stephen A. the megaphone, he will use it to rant absurdly loudly about pretty much anything because why wouldn't he, and while Statham and the Rock fight over which gets to kill him I could slip away.
933071812174450692 2017-11-21 20:37:10 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 what has Brohm done? He has Purdue 1 game away from a bowl with Darrell Hazel's players. Allen inherited a bowl team and has they are 1 game away from missing a bowl.
932440723667943425 2017-11-19 02:49:27 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Is it pretty much a given someone will hire Holt away this off-season (be it a head coaching gig or simply a bigger program willing to pay more and give him a bigger stage & better talent)?
932439420556455942 2017-11-19 02:44:16 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Is it overstating it to call this the biggest bucket game since the one that sent Purdue to the Rose Bowl?
932383630776848385 2017-11-19 23:02:35 UTC <RRanney1> @realDonaldTrump Would seem like doing the right thing is the right thing whether you get credit, praise, or thanks for doing so. To whine about how you didn't get thanked enough and say you should have left them to rot in jail says a lot about you as a human, let alone as a president.
932031569644187650 2017-11-18 23:43:37 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 Onside not inside
932031441709551616 2017-11-18 23:43:06 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 fairly deflating if you miss, makes both the inside and the defense afterward both play halfheartedly as they know they have little to no chance
932026297894793216 2017-11-18 23:22:40 UTC <RRanney1> I know a @BoilerFootball touchdown seals this, but keep the clock moving!
932024815002771458 2017-11-18 23:16:46 UTC <RRanney1> if @BoilerFootball pulls off this win a big assist has to go out to @IowaFootball for helping to run the clock so much in the 3rd and 4th quarters. #BoilerUp
931538198639017984 2017-11-17 15:03:08 UTC <RRanney1> @drewhastings Always possible he did so prior to ALS, given a lot (most?) of the accusations have come out decades after the fact.

930120386586533888 2017-11-13 17:09:15 UTC <RRanney1> @YahooForde ...and that was the beginning of the end...
930107966509998081 2017-11-13 16:19:54 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Caleb was/is a phenomenal talent, but he was turnover prone and not a tremendous defender, 2 things Painter seems to value above all else. His rebounding, scoring, passing, and overall intensity are huge losses regardless of any shortcomings though.
929187895595937792 2017-11-10 03:23:52 UTC <RRanney1> Absolutely hilarious to see #iubb go down to the Sycamores, however I do recall Painter and the #Boilers dropping a game at Terre Haute by 19 in 2006, with an eventual NCAA tournament team led by @CarlLandry. Crazy stuff happens early in the season.
928641588603088897 2017-11-09 15:13:02 UTC <RRanney1> @Grady what about way the #Colts have deal with injuries in the past few years would make big Joe put ANY faith in them?

928370660446961667 2017-11-08 21:16:28 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Take away every kid who feels entitled to "a piece of the pie" and college football & basketball would still be enjoyable, would still rake in a boatload of money and most of those "stars" would probably amount to very little in the pros.
927560564716572674 2017-11-06 15:37:26 UTC <RRanney1> @woodypaige It would be interesting to see if Eli could close out his career in similar fashion to Peyton with a few years in Denver. Not a good longterm solution for the Broncos, but if it nets them another Lombardi trophy or even a much better shot at one it is worth it.
927335323524390912 2017-11-05 00:42:24 UTC <RRanney1> @TonyD1070 Draft pick. Wins at this point do nothing but ensure a worse draft position.
927283881144877056 2017-11-05 21:18:00 UTC <RRanney1> #Colts can't even tank right!
927282765493620742 2017-11-05 21:13:34 UTC <RRanney1> Bleh. #Colts screw up and beat #Texans. Draft position matters more than how many games you miss the playoffs by.
925803680372281345 2017-11-01 19:16:12 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 think the Browns GM was locked in his office listening to Italian opera as loud as possible Andy Dufrene style instead of submitting the trade?
923928503724146688 2017-10-27 15:04:55 UTC <RRanney1> @Espngreeny UM medical staff screwed up the Speight injury way more than Purdue. Let him walk off the field then dealt with lowest level staff all the rest of the way rather than taking him out to the ambulance ON THE FIELD.
923191347598774272 2017-10-25 14:15:43 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL @smullikin83 At this point he might be the Tom Brady to Andrew Luck's Drew Bledsoe. Obviously we hope Luck returns to form but there is no guarantee of it, and we have seen just how little we want to rely on Tolzien. I'd rather shop TY tho his stock is obviously hurting.
923169668378095618 2017-10-25 12:49:35 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL @smullikin83 With Luck's injury history why in the world would you trade Brissett? Better off holding onto him.
923169063198699520 2017-10-25 12:47:10 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Chant: "Keep Chuck so we suck!" [REPEAT] No point in jumping ship now so we can get 4 or 5 garbage wins to ensure a worse draft position. Pay him to take the L's and shift focus to next year.

912711409770868736 2017-09-26 16:12:12 UTC <RRanney1> More thorough? Certainly, however their concerns are larger than recruiting violations, so there may be avenues they don't pursue.

911738264331194368 2017-09-23 23:45:16 UTC <RRanney1> Too much Brian Langford-Johnson today for #Purdue. Counter to #Michigan speed best served by Richie Worship but only got 2 carries (18yds)
911734057238753280 2017-09-23 23:28:33 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue has officially imploded. Just too little offense, no running game whatsoever, and dumb penalties. On to Minnesota...
911728459155738630 2017-09-23 23:06:18 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue defense falling apart, but really seems like refs and lack of any offense are main problems
911726411047669761 2017-09-23 22:58:10 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz Gotta make a change at QB and RB
911725902186377216 2017-09-23 22:56:08 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Several times now he has come close to throwing beyond the line of scrimmage, will be interesting to see if the refs miss it when he does
911724120722870272 2017-09-23 22:49:04 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue come on! Time for a switch at both QB and RB. Sindelar and Langford-Johnson just aren't getting it done.
911723063322046464 2017-09-23 22:44:51 UTC <RRanney1> Blatant hold by #Michigan o-lineman 75 on that TD
911720738822000647 2017-09-23 22:35:37 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Lazy pass rush with 5 rushing
911717467881443328 2017-09-23 22:22:37 UTC <RRanney1> Would really like to see #Purdue give some more carries to Richard Worship or DJ Knox.
911713971903877120 2017-09-23 22:08:44 UTC <RRanney1> @MikePereira Yep, thanks just wondered.
911713832527171584 2017-09-23 22:08:11 UTC <RRanney1> @katiegearlds4 Quite the roll model. Who axed for this clarificaton?pic.twitter.com/hPCtupxBUj
911712844349104133 2017-09-23 22:04:15 UTC <RRanney1> @MikePereira what was your thought on the hit on Jackson Anthrop in the #MICHvsPUR game?
911703351305351168 2017-09-23 21:26:32 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Looked far more like an intent to injure than the hit that got Neal ejected in game one.
910355130893127682 2017-09-19 04:09:11 UTC <RRanney1> Biggest key for #Purdue is to avoid turning the ball over. Make #Michigan offense beat you. Worried Blough may try to do too much. #BoilerUp

909473527010557954 2017-09-17 17:46:00 UTC <RRanney1> Amazing how much better both sides of the ball look with the #Colts not going with Scott Tolzien.
909165909784309760 2017-09-16 21:23:39 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Apparently not.
909164820150222848 2017-09-16 21:19:19 UTC <RRanney1> Seems #Mizzou plan is to leave #Purdue offense on the field to wear them down while their O rests up for 2nd half.pic.twitter.com/3slDvul81T

909163535132954625 2017-09-16 21:14:12 UTC <RRanney1> Send SOMEONE after the punter! That could have ended up a TD, or if the punter was smart he could have walked to a 1st down #BoilerUp

908706989261324288 2017-09-15 15:00:03 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom Does Purdue stand a better chance if this game is low scoring or a shootout?
908031659135643648 2017-09-13 18:16:32 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz But who else will tell us about their upcoming game against the Seahawks?!

907635475149676545 2017-09-12 16:02:14 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Even better when there is snow on the ground and they decide the road is safer than trudging through snowy sidewalks or grass.

907322648249733120 2017-09-11 19:19:11 UTC <RRanney1> @KineticoIndy @JMV1070 depends entirely upon getting Luck back and him being near 100 percent. Do that and they may still win the division.
907233752677576704 2017-09-11 13:25:56 UTC <RRanney1> @Colts @dandakich The #Colts are tied for 2nd in their division.
907032715492503556 2017-09-10 00:07:05 UTC <RRanney1> @JimIrsay @pwilson24 Maybe Ballard knew roster was so bad he didn't want to hang this on a new hires shoulders. Let Chuck take it, give new guy good draft picks.
907012781471420416 2017-09-10 22:47:53 UTC <RRanney1> Even in taking the safety Brissett was a better QB than Tolzien, have little doubt that he'd have let the Rams recover it for a TD #Colts
907008820018335744 2017-09-10 22:32:08 UTC <RRanney1> Brissett screwing things up for #Colts brass. Just made it too quickly apparent there was no reason Tolzien should have been in there.
907006169591541760 2017-09-10 22:21:36 UTC <RRanney1> @mickey_canuck Have you seen them throw the ball? It is a wonder they aren't punting or chucking it out the back of their own end zone.
907005788765474816 2017-09-10 22:20:06 UTC <RRanney1> Was that facemask the best offensive play the #Colts have managed today?
907004998478962688 2017-09-10 22:16:57 UTC <RRanney1> Who is most at fault for this nonsense? Irsay, Ballard, or Pagano? Tolzien is awful but they had plenty of time to replace him. #Colts
906348462849097730 2017-09-08 02:48:07 UTC <RRanney1> Les Miles has been incredibly awkward, glad he didn't show up earlier #PurduevsOhio
906329473523572736 2017-09-08 01:32:39 UTC <RRanney1> #BoilerUp what a difference coaching makes!
906328785578053632 2017-09-08 01:29:55 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom @AMSTS However a big part of why the fake worked was the lack of rush, the punter had all day and no pressure.
906325409540833281 2017-09-08 01:16:31 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom why isn't #Purdue going for the block on punts? Nearly got there last week a few times but keep sitting back this week.
904182569125675008 2017-09-02 03:21:38 UTC <RRanney1> Always dissappointing when @BoilerFootball loses, but very proud of how they played today.

900020768364482560 2017-08-22 15:44:07 UTC <RRanney1> Shouldn't be able to drop a kid purely for coach's mistake. You can try to scare him off w/ lack of PT but if he stays you should be stuck.
900019376023363585 2017-08-22 15:38:35 UTC <RRanney1> Then drop transfer restrictions, because if a coach can drop a kid cuz prior guy made a mistake, no reason that kid should have to sit out.
900018607110934528 2017-08-22 15:35:32 UTC <RRanney1> @HinnyM Recruiting mistakes are MEANT to hurt. Otherwise theres little protection for athletes, who can't leave whenever they want w/o punishment.
900017312253739008 2017-08-22 15:30:23 UTC <RRanney1> Plenty news worthy if Miller is doing same sort of quick turnaround BS that Crean did often, esp after raves about him keeping roster intact
900014904505249800 2017-08-22 15:20:49 UTC <RRanney1> @HinnyM Crean's mistake sure but the bill of rights was to protect kids from this sort of BS. Kids don't sign w/ Big Ten school just for free ride.

883876853039206400 2017-07-08 02:33:58 UTC <RRanney1> Biggie is a great talent but was a bad fit for #Purdue. His 2 biggest deficiencies were the 2 areas Painter values most.
883804785736069123 2017-07-08 21:47:35 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @GreggDoyelStar Still yet to see anyone draw parallels to when Pacers traded J. Rose & got back unheralded R. Artest & B. Miller
883802364943228929 2017-07-08 21:37:58 UTC <RRanney1> Biggie was bad fit, poor defender & too turnover prone. Enough of a rebounder, passer, & scorer to excel but still poor fit.
881995792835371008 2017-07-03 21:59:18 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling @gordonhayward @Sports1430AM That all changes in a hurry if he "takes his talents to South Beach" yet don't expect as much ire if he stays in Utah or joins the Celtics.
881992822945132545 2017-07-03 21:47:30 UTC <RRanney1> 15 years ago #Pacers traded away J. Rose landing B.Miller & R.Artest http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/rose_020219.html hope trade w/ OKC looks as good in hindsight
881529447723216897 2017-07-02 15:06:13 UTC <RRanney1> @ReggieMillerTNT Either he or his agent leaking that he wouldn't re-sign and that he wanted to go to LA absolutely torpedoed his trade value tho.
881163440785674240 2017-07-01 14:51:50 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz not that it is the same, but how well regarded were Artest & B. Miller when we traded for them? Was that trade seen as a win?
879143392768339968 2017-06-25 01:04:53 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakichpic.twitter.com/7vhWavQxHL
877909484571688962 2017-06-22 15:21:46 UTC <RRanney1> Love that so many teams are interested in @Yg_Trece, but can't help but expect #Pacers will find a way to screw this up.
877673176842547200 2017-06-21 23:42:46 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz Bleh. Has waiting EVER worked out for the Pacers with trades? They always seem to unload players too late for nearly nothing.
875066600579313668 2017-06-14 19:05:10 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Should be that all have to sit out a year, but not lose that year (or be forced to use a redshirt).
874657830997024769 2017-06-13 16:00:51 UTC <RRanney1> @jconline @carmin_jc 3-4 wins seems plausible. Even under Hazell we could beat Illinois & Rutgers. Could beat Ohio & IU. Beyond that is NCOY territory.
872251915400335361 2017-06-06 00:40:36 UTC <RRanney1> @birbigs they are with Jesus now. - Trump supporters (no reasoning with these people, better to just brace for the steady march to Idiocracy)
871793962620792832 2017-06-05 18:20:52 UTC <RRanney1> @slmandel Wow. Was he unable to travel or is this solely on a lack of verbal commits? If the latter that is a messed up call to make in early June.
869217457709473793 2017-05-29 15:42:45 UTC <RRanney1> It may be sacrilege but the areas Biggie struggled (defense & turnovers) were so important to Painter we may be a better team w/o him.
867827365140975617 2017-05-25 19:39:01 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 didn't you interview Kevin Costner around the release of Draft Day? It was pretty horrible.
867515844364042240 2017-05-24 23:01:09 UTC <RRanney1> @PatMcAfeeShow What? Is it that he could do no better than that dumpster fire or that he has almost no chance at success?
865305069142626306 2017-05-18 20:36:19 UTC <RRanney1> More like 90/10 or 80/20 but incredible to have even that. Would really make a mockery of early predictions for 2017-18.
862838063604666368 2017-05-11 01:13:19 UTC <RRanney1> He hasn't "developed" as much as hoped, but then again Grigson failed to surround him with much or to protect him.
862707855450877952 2017-05-11 16:35:55 UTC <RRanney1> @brianneubert Does it matter? Florida & its Tebow clones will win again . Too bad Saban's brain in a jar was stolen by aliens, SEC'd be more competitive.
861686093820940288 2017-05-08 20:55:48 UTC <RRanney1> @mchappell51 Rebuilt it the right way, but that doesn't mean it will be a quick fix. Still should contend in the AFC south though.
860297738457677825 2017-05-04 00:58:59 UTC <RRanney1> @GaryParrishCBS Little more Biggie can prove, but continuing to drop weight, less turnovers & better perimeter defense might alleviate some NBA concerns.
860294148565368832 2017-05-04 00:44:43 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports So have they bailed completely on the notion of an upper deck opposite the press box?
860236704741040128 2017-05-04 20:56:27 UTC <RRanney1> @dennisdoddcbs any update on the prospects from your "agent of misfit kids" article? I keep hoping to see Richardson signed by the Colts.
859866994224623620 2017-05-03 20:27:21 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 @jakequery @jcason515 Stray bullets included?

858668259381571584 2017-04-30 13:04:00 UTC <RRanney1> @Colts how about signing D2 pass rushers (McKendree) Lucky Baar and/or (Lane College) Whitney Richardson ?
858665695353212928 2017-04-30 12:53:49 UTC <RRanney1> @MelKiperESPN anyone sign Lane College's Whitney Richardson yet?
858144629002317825 2017-04-28 02:23:17 UTC <RRanney1> For those whining about #Purdue taking WKU recruits and a transfer, 2 WKU players drafted thus far on day two of the NFL draft.

857782987911557120 2017-04-27 02:26:15 UTC <RRanney1> @FOX59 @Chris_Widlic Shades of Bob Sanders start with the Colts, though differing style of play should help him enjoy a longer career than Sanders
857782409856765952 2017-04-27 02:23:57 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL be interesting to see how many ladies will wear the 1st rd pick's jersey, not sure I will rush out to buy my wife one
857780263476232192 2017-04-27 02:15:26 UTC <RRanney1> @mchappell51 Gotta wonder if there were any trade options they passed up though, as it seems like they submitted the pick quickly.
857778773286146050 2017-04-27 02:09:30 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Good value and a position of need, but seemed like there were harder to fill spots with great talent available.
857776027581505537 2017-04-27 01:58:36 UTC <RRanney1> 15th pick and the Colts go safety? Bleh. Had to be a chance to trade back, or better yet take Allen and solidify the dline.
857768403418927110 2017-04-27 01:28:18 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Phenomonal to keep seeing teams reach on offensive players. Should be great value available.
857607922167271424 2017-04-27 14:50:36 UTC <RRanney1> @Grady if you haven't heard it before give Chris Porter's take on pickles a listen: https://m.soundcloud.com/comedydynamics/chris-porter-pickle-manners
857430648289726464 2017-04-26 03:06:11 UTC <RRanney1> #ESPNLayoffs Are there are more tweets blaming left wing politics or tweets complaining about black reporters who weren't fired?
857332415227990016 2017-04-26 20:35:50 UTC <RRanney1> @slmandel If ESPN went to a model like HBO, Starz, etc, they would see subscriber #s go back up, but they're too tied in with cable.
856478721854799873 2017-04-24 12:03:34 UTC <RRanney1> @IndyStarSports No. Maybe the era of 1st rd RBs will circle back around, but too many quality backs are available later in the draft.
854344303816134657 2017-04-18 14:42:09 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 @CoreyElliot ...yeah CJ Miles and whoever shot Iman Shumpert in the head.
854339748755800065 2017-04-18 14:24:03 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL @dankmagee @sethIU98 @BreaultMathieu Beyond that, young, fairly cheap, and you would have to think very motivated given whatever $ he does have will go to legal and civil cases
854338427239763970 2017-04-18 14:18:48 UTC <RRanney1> Hope #Colts don't part ways w/ David Parry until legal process is finished. Dude needs help & it isn't as tho they have too many DL bodies.
854333511670648833 2017-04-18 13:59:16 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL @dankmagee @sethIU98 @BreaultMathieu Agreed. Too often the Colts react to a FA signing by cutting the former starter, that is no way to build depth.
853777752742404097 2017-04-16 01:10:53 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar Time for a spring Creaning.
852158087758835718 2017-04-12 13:54:55 UTC <RRanney1> @creanytom So @CreanyTom might be gone, but looks like Creaning will still be alive and well at #iubb.
851837895367417856 2017-04-11 16:42:35 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich autoerotic asphyxiation, if I recall correctly that is how David Carradine died.
851065388041465856 2017-04-09 13:32:55 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom @CledisCanTweet If Swanigan leaves as expected, then yes.
850512588794458112 2017-04-07 00:56:17 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @Quervojones69 Standard scholarship disbursement to cover room and board. Differs by university to reflect local housing costs.
850457350024695810 2017-04-07 21:16:47 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz Can't see that happening. Might have made sense if IU had hired Alford but they did not.
850421963264806912 2017-04-07 18:56:10 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @Quervojones69 32k a year. Based on the monthly check his son was receiving.
850421443687067648 2017-04-07 18:54:06 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Ones who live in dorms likely get a lot less, but its still more than most non-athlete students who work part or even full time
850418335875563520 2017-04-07 18:41:45 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom any discounted football tickets tomorrow during, or prior to, the spring game?
850020402776743936 2017-04-06 16:20:31 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich do players in basketball get "swag" for the postseason and/or exempt tournaments like football players do for bowl games?
849401486496976896 2017-04-04 23:21:10 UTC <RRanney1> @JasonSpells Hard to imagine his stock getting higher, yet NBA scouts still seem skeptical. Improved defense & less turnovers are areas to work on.
849399697219481602 2017-04-04 23:14:03 UTC <RRanney1> @FSKPart3 Most regular students leave college at least $20-40k in debt, even if they work while earning their degree. I don't hear walk-ons whining.
848249002290294784 2017-04-01 19:01:36 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling If Morgan Burke were still in charge this may not be a joke, don't forget short lived "Brownish Pete".pic.twitter.com/vRlONkb3zp
847434954468319238 2017-03-30 13:06:52 UTC <RRanney1> @insidethehall Matt Roth sarcastically slow claps
847177446923362305 2017-03-29 20:03:37 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @IndyStarSports um, "ain't never"? I see what you did there Tom, rocking the double negative. Classy.
847176069006442496 2017-03-29 19:58:09 UTC <RRanney1> @DanWolken @Schultz975 makes you wonder what might have happened if IU had hosted GT in the NIT? Might Crean still be coaching?
847175215130009600 2017-03-29 19:54:45 UTC <RRanney1> Really hope @KLowe_20 gets the open asst coaching spot @BoilerBall he will be a great recruiter & has a ton of knowledge to impart #BoilerUp
847173691347795968 2017-03-29 19:48:42 UTC <RRanney1> @SFY @NFLonFOX during the season more a distraction for visiting teams than the Raiders, offseason is where it could be an issue for Raiders
847138879929040897 2017-03-29 17:30:22 UTC <RRanney1> @1070thefan @MattGlenesk where does ducking his boss to avoid bad news coming in person fall on that spectrum?
846751856575627264 2017-03-28 15:52:29 UTC <RRanney1> @undisputed @NFLonFOX @criscarter80 I think that was decided a hell of a lot longer ago than yesterday.
846747429961699328 2017-03-28 15:34:53 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom improtance is a big deal. I see tons of commercials about it. Old people in tubs and all. Creepy.
846746644066586624 2017-03-28 15:31:46 UTC <RRanney1> http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-energy-idUSKBN16Z1L6 ...a big win for big business & global warming. For planet earth? Not so much. #globalwarming
846743804375904256 2017-03-28 15:20:29 UTC <RRanney1> Excited for @BoilerFootball Spring Game but injuries have me worried it will be... bleh. Oh well, Fall matters much more anyway. #BoilerUp
846459084001947649 2017-03-27 20:29:06 UTC <RRanney1> @DustinDopirak roster balance and having enough smart "players" (not athletes) will be key, can't have the rollercoaster seasons Crean did.
846458344361672704 2017-03-27 20:26:10 UTC <RRanney1> @DustinDopirak true. Miller can't fall in love w/ national recruiting just because he CAN. Hard lesson for lots of former mid-major coaches.
846456262237851651 2017-03-27 20:17:53 UTC <RRanney1> @DustinDopirak after that? Aside from "can go anywhere" types most in-state kids he took were walk-ons. Result? BIG drop in BB IQ.
846454093145145350 2017-03-27 20:09:16 UTC <RRanney1> Caleb Swanigan is a great player, but I don't think he ever truly fit for Painter. Too many turnovers & not good enough defensively.
846452683989024770 2017-03-27 20:03:40 UTC <RRanney1> I don't get the rally the troops way the IU media is acting like Archie Miller is the perfect hire. He's plan C, less proven than Crean was.
845851203145752576 2017-03-25 04:13:36 UTC <RRanney1> how much are they paying to "trade up" from Tom Crean to Archie Miller? Hardly seems like much of an upgrade.
845826019298807808 2017-03-25 02:33:32 UTC <RRanney1> @Dstrang63 wouldn't people have claimed the same of Tom Crean?
845825593295978496 2017-03-25 02:31:50 UTC <RRanney1> strikes me as a lesser Tom Crean. He would have been a good hire at a mid tier major conf school. Isn't IU better than that?
845338117469036544 2017-03-24 18:14:47 UTC <RRanney1> @HammerAndRails @JeffWashburnJC I'm more upset about our play in the 1st half than the 2nd. Upsetting to get routed but KU is just that good
845123686113849344 2017-03-23 04:02:43 UTC <RRanney1> Upsetting to see the season end like this, but proud of @BoilerBall. #BoilerUp
844599805548658688 2017-03-22 17:21:00 UTC <RRanney1> @GabeDeArmond @ebosshoops Cuonzo will be a great hire & his trend of 3 years & out is over. Not happy for #Purdue to recruit vs him tho.
844596334774636545 2017-03-22 17:07:12 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Made sense when ADs hired guys before their coach was fired. Now it reeks of a protection scheme w/ a middleman wanting his cut.
844592431173713920 2017-03-22 16:51:42 UTC <RRanney1> @BTNTomDienhart @BigTenNetwork Ryan Cline, he has gotten PT ahead of @Cboogie_3  due to defense but #Purdue needs his shooting to show up.
844561103350890496 2017-03-22 14:47:12 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Classy as always. I know almost every media guy worshipped at the altar of Tom Crean, but he always struck me as thin skinned.
844248010255224833 2017-03-21 18:03:05 UTC <RRanney1> @sn_ncaab @PilotNewsdoug may not need IU guy, but need someone who has HEAVILY recruited the state. IU has built in advantages, use them.
844239224966647809 2017-03-21 17:28:11 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich if an IU guy when they got RMK...maybe they would've gotten Slick Leonard & had similar success w/ a much nicer guy at the helm.
844228113001332737 2017-03-21 16:44:01 UTC <RRanney1> #Colts are making tremendous moves, not front page names, but low risk, solid hires. Just hoping draft goes similarly well.
844225869249986560 2017-03-21 16:35:06 UTC <RRanney1> @NeverDauntedNet @KentSterling go for a 2nd masters or a doctorate. Roth was a program guy who did things the right way, he deserved better.
844219342317412352 2017-03-21 16:09:10 UTC <RRanney1> @NeverDauntedNet @KentSterling gotta disagree w/ you on Roth. Crean should have honored his scholly until eligibility was up.
844211545034964993 2017-03-21 15:38:11 UTC <RRanney1> If #Purdue  beats Kansas and @_SniperXII posts two more games like his 1st two gotta think NBA scouts will give him a looooong look.
844208874118955008 2017-03-21 15:27:34 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling how on earth could ANY Indiana college could rely on 1 or 2 players for their collective "basketball IQ"?
844208535626043393 2017-03-21 15:26:14 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling true, but it didn't seem like Crean lacked for dedication, just never seemed to "get" Indiana basketball
844207637260652550 2017-03-21 15:22:39 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich worked out great! Signed Purdue and the rest of the Big Ten #keepmovingon
844207113496940544 2017-03-21 15:20:35 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling main concern=going back to Izzo coaching tree, secondary=inexperience. Wouldn't turn his back on in-state kids tho.
844206262795558912 2017-03-21 15:17:12 UTC <RRanney1> @Rivals @ebosshoops Martin gets bigger bump from Sweet 16 than Painter, Purdue "should" be here, has to get further to get a legit bump.
844205739543592960 2017-03-21 15:15:07 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue should defend #kansas like E'twaun Moore's HS squad did Eric Gordon's. They get numbers in transition, FOUL. Make em earn it via FT.
843871132742811648 2017-03-20 17:05:31 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle couldn't get it to work off the website but got it on the tunein app
843866592001888259 2017-03-20 16:47:28 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle is there an issue with the stream? I cannot bring up the show.
843323693459783680 2017-03-18 04:50:11 UTC <RRanney1> @AndrewPogar has any other tandem come close to the tourney these two have put together thus far?
843323204261285892 2017-03-18 04:48:14 UTC <RRanney1> @BTNTomDienhart nevermind missed your other tweet. Still, hard to believe the stats Vince is "quietly" piling up
843322133568733188 2017-03-18 04:43:59 UTC <RRanney1> @BTNTomDienhart don't forget Vince Edwards... 42 points (19-30 shots), 15 boards, and 7 assists
843313395730472960 2017-03-18 04:09:16 UTC <RRanney1> Had to check the stats. Vince had a very quiet 21, 10, and 4. Phenomonal games for both him and Biggie in this tourney thus far. #boileruphttps://twitter.com/BoilerBall/status/843309420125868032
843264018299211776 2017-03-18 00:53:03 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeMillerHT so IU is equal to UCLA and Iowa? Not every program is on equal footing. Would Crean have gotten Cody or Yogi at Marquette?

842844489328877568 2017-03-17 21:06:00 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 now isn't the time to do it, but at some point Painter has to go after the refs in defense of Haas.
842829470390243330 2017-03-17 20:06:19 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 #iubb = popular girl w/ penchant for bad decisions. Alford = best friend. SHOULD give him a chance... thinks she can do better.
842827259450933248 2017-03-17 19:57:32 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 Crean was a used car salesman, he may have had a good APR but it seemed like he was always recruiting to replace guys he just got
842543414784737280 2017-03-16 01:09:38 UTC <RRanney1> Damn Isaac go up strong!!! #BoilerUp
842542928459370496 2017-03-16 01:07:42 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue has got to start putting this game out of reach. Cannot let Vermont hang around with their 3pt shooting
842528231991508993 2017-03-16 00:09:18 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 being so poorly officiated seems to get in his head, he plays too finesse, yet still gets called for too many fouls
842526966045691904 2017-03-16 00:04:16 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom there needs to be some serious work this offseason on teaching Haas to dunk
842410462675365889 2017-03-16 16:21:20 UTC <RRanney1> @YahooForde shouldn't be stunning. Figured him soft landing elsewhere was more likely, but a change had to be made.
842391490512998400 2017-03-16 15:05:56 UTC <RRanney1> @HolderStephen @GreggDoyelStar @indystar lot of work to do, hope additions continue to be mid level guys. In the draft trade back repeatedly
842128197252702212 2017-03-15 21:39:42 UTC <RRanney1> @GaryParrishCBS IU is oversigned, they NEED guys to leave to add their recruits
842124846993702912 2017-03-15 21:26:24 UTC <RRanney1> Very glad to see @CuonzoMartin coming back to the midwest, but I do worry he and Painter will go head to head for recruits quite a bit
842120841156517903 2017-03-15 21:10:29 UTC <RRanney1> @GaryParrishCBS Cuonzo coming home makes a ton of sense, he will be a tremendous recruiter for Missouri and I expect him to put down roots
842118479805349888 2017-03-15 21:01:06 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling @tsnmike 4 tourneys in 9 years with all of IU's resources, that too is "tremendous"
842117521864044545 2017-03-15 20:57:17 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling @tsnmike building a consistent winner is better than an occasional big winner who drags bottom every couple years
842114990207295489 2017-03-15 20:47:14 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling @tsnmike beyond that I said FIT, he is a midwest guy, he was out of his element a bit at Cal and Ten but still was successful
842114640108752896 2017-03-15 20:45:50 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling @tsnmike no less than 20 wins in his 2nd & 3rd seasons at any of his 3 stops, Crean has 2 of those in the last 4 years at IU
842111237139881985 2017-03-15 20:32:19 UTC <RRanney1> @CBSSports @GaryParrishCBS great fit for Cuonzo and think he'll stay there a decade plus.
842110740211347456 2017-03-15 20:30:20 UTC <RRanney1> @tsnmike @KentSterling gotta disagree on Mike's take on Cuonzo, he is a tremendous fit for Missouri, far better than Crean.
841867025412718592 2017-03-14 04:21:54 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar ridiculous to think he'd go to Illinois when few are sure he'd take IU job if offered. Not the same Butler of a decade ago.
841865647487365121 2017-03-14 04:16:26 UTC <RRanney1> should be, but question is does he take the soft landing or force Glass & IU to pay him to pack his things?
841801028987154432 2017-03-14 23:59:39 UTC <RRanney1> @EvanDaniels a little surprised there haven't been as many or more noteworthy transfer downs from elite conference teams
841800269553905664 2017-03-14 23:56:38 UTC <RRanney1> @timkaine apparently all he needs to do is order a bunch of microwaves

841797248509960192 2017-03-14 23:44:38 UTC <RRanney1> @WTHRcom @KentSterling "We agree completely," says every fan of the other 13 Big Ten schools
841796578721583106 2017-03-14 23:41:58 UTC <RRanney1> @franfraschilla @GoodmanESPN you say that like you think its an AD's responsibility to know who is a good coach & how to hire them
841403253917155328 2017-03-13 21:39:02 UTC <RRanney1> @CoachPainter w/o looking, I am guessing PU has least wins in big dance of those teams. Gotta do better.
840280525675868162 2017-03-10 19:17:43 UTC <RRanney1> So damn sick of #Purdue getting screwed by the officials. They had chances in spite of it, but they just couldn't get any calls late.
840278299284774914 2017-03-10 19:08:52 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue totally screwed by refs today. Absolute BS!
840277527692226564 2017-03-10 19:05:48 UTC <RRanney1> Rebounding and poor officiating killing #Purdue
840273616566648832 2017-03-10 18:50:16 UTC <RRanney1> CARSEN EDWARDS!!!
840269008708468736 2017-03-10 18:31:57 UTC <RRanney1> Officiating in #Purdue game has completely turned to crap.
840259558882848769 2017-03-10 17:54:24 UTC <RRanney1> @DanielleMuscato @tommchenry literally anyone with rich family members willing to coddle them can do this! What an inspiration!pic.twitter.com/zMqdH6F1VK
840105901323255808 2017-03-09 07:43:49 UTC <RRanney1> @theMMQB @SI_PeterKing @AlbertBreer when he says "you can't let that FA get out of town w/o a deal" apparently Dan Snyder really means it
840105135254646784 2017-03-09 07:40:47 UTC <RRanney1> @FOX59 thankfully he is okay so everyone can say... liar liar pants on fire.
840014056736071684 2017-03-09 01:38:52 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar @PilotNewsdoug @NatJNewell @indystar if he did do this, why'd IU give him $500k? Maybe theres something else both R hiding?
839951913399517184 2017-03-09 21:31:56 UTC <RRanney1> hard to imagine they wouldn't take a look at him, but you would expect SOME attempt at PR spin if that were the plan
839924095391313920 2017-03-09 19:41:24 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 ...after about a minute or so of tear inducing laughter
839612437586378753 2017-03-08 23:02:59 UTC <RRanney1> @FOX59 @BrianBondus sounds like the premise of a Seth Rogan movie
839610761324412929 2017-03-08 22:56:19 UTC <RRanney1> @SBNationCFB @CoachBradyBrohm @SBNation an offensive identity, as long as it isn't just... "misdirection" is a vast improvement
839610112138432512 2017-03-08 22:53:44 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar @GaryParrishCBS Crean has too many misses in recruiting and next year #iubb looks likely to be worse.
839602289228787714 2017-03-08 22:22:39 UTC <RRanney1> Dissappointed to see Dwayne Allen traded (esp for so little in return) but it makes Doyle signing far more palatable. #Colts
839570034091511808 2017-03-08 20:14:29 UTC <RRanney1> Ditching @directvnow I had high hopes as the price & channels are good, but their service is horrible & I'm not waiting on it to get better.
839565856564707328 2017-03-08 19:57:53 UTC <RRanney1> @NatJNewell @IndyStarSports anyone honestly think he's 16th best TE in the NFL? Good player on a team w/ few of those but he's not THAT good
839550834564349952 2017-03-08 18:58:11 UTC <RRanney1> @schadjoe strange to think the first time most of us heard of Romo was Terrell Owens griping that he should be their starting QB. Tony who?
839548636212125696 2017-03-08 18:49:27 UTC <RRanney1> @Rosenberg_Mike Crean hasn't recruited or coached well enough to stay off hot seat. His results fine most places but IU has to expect more.
839525172919078912 2017-03-08 17:16:13 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich same excuse for why Purdue's individual honors were so sparse... teammates stole each others votes
839278705700634624 2017-03-07 00:56:51 UTC <RRanney1> Torn on #Colts resigning Doyle. He's 1 of their few young talents. But too many holes to be paying that much for 2 "solid" TEs
839137519161733120 2017-03-07 15:35:49 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 ? is whether they can replace him cheap. Gotta have backups, what are chances a late rd or undrafted rookie will be better?
839110647732371458 2017-03-07 13:49:02 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC no preseason predictions had Purdue #1, postseason honors lead one to believe PU is Biggie & 4 scrubs
839109283048472576 2017-03-07 13:43:37 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 he should come pretty cheap, depends on if he was a guy Grigson was forcing on the coaches rather than one they wanted
838885901480636416 2017-03-06 22:55:59 UTC <RRanney1> @KentSterling Crean would know how to do that job, but wouldn't want it. Cuonzo makes more sense, chance to return home & to beat TN yearly
838873101408559104 2017-03-06 22:05:07 UTC <RRanney1> prayers go out to @CoachVersyp, get a big win over cancer coach! #HammerDownCancer
838837121192427520 2017-03-06 19:42:09 UTC <RRanney1> @MizzouHoops @KentSterling wonder how much of this is just wishful thinking of IU fans hoping to help Crean pack his bags?
838836511651028994 2017-03-06 19:39:43 UTC <RRanney1> @GaryParrishCBS @Purduebball55 agreed, media more upset w/ IU, Wisc, & MSU than impressed w/ PU (incl Parrish who picked PU 4th)
838455200104992773 2017-03-05 18:24:32 UTC <RRanney1> Had an awesome morning at the #NFLCombine thanks to @1iotapic.twitter.com/dBJKFes8Cq
838185523999047680 2017-03-04 00:32:56 UTC <RRanney1> @HolderStephen @IndyStarSports @indystar need more Walden-esque additions, guys coming off rookie deals who are largely unproven
837315015732527106 2017-03-02 14:53:50 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @GreggDoyelStar yep, there are some risks you can and should take, this guy isn't one of them.
837062094906355713 2017-03-01 22:08:49 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 a selling point for #iubb keeping Crean... Purdue struggled prior to getting its JRs, one class & some subtractions changed culture
837060476559372293 2017-03-01 22:02:24 UTC <RRanney1> @MarkMontieth was glad to hear Painter be so outspoken about the nonsense calls going against Haas.
836999365432655881 2017-03-01 17:59:34 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich isn't it on the coach if he keeps playing guys who aren't buying in? PU was kinda similar prior to adding this year's JR class.
836749833981558784 2017-02-28 01:28:01 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom would love to see a highlight reel of his fouls. Half seem like BS, and that ignores how often he gets fouled w/ no call
835589977945878528 2017-02-25 20:39:09 UTC <RRanney1> @directvnow I get why they won't give out refunds, but they should extend subscribers 2-3 months free service as apology
835586412598734848 2017-02-25 20:24:59 UTC <RRanney1> @directvnow only hope is that things improve... THEN locked in price is a good deal. How long (if ever) till that occurs?
835585525667008512 2017-02-25 20:21:28 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 beyond that does it look like help is on the way? Maybe better "team" w/o stars but they are at best middle of pack bubble team.
835583639865917443 2017-02-25 20:13:58 UTC <RRanney1> @directvnow Anyone considering @DIRECTVNow should wait 3-6 months before even free trial. Quality & customer service are abysmal, MAYBE it'll get better
835508010592124929 2017-02-25 15:13:27 UTC <RRanney1> @espn @MikeWellsNFL Could? Yes. Should? No. Colts spend too much on dead cap money for players who can still contribute, always have.
834261551397863424 2017-02-21 04:40:28 UTC <RRanney1> @WISH_TV @ACwishtv shouldn't have a prayer without winning the Big Ten Tournament
834259856177643520 2017-02-21 04:33:44 UTC <RRanney1> gotta think there are plenty left out who are more deserving than the multiple sub .500 in league play hi majors who'll make it
834259219566227456 2017-02-21 04:31:12 UTC <RRanney1> shoulda held up a sign
834258987419734016 2017-02-21 04:30:17 UTC <RRanney1> THIS is the year they take more mid majors!!! Haha, no, no they won't. Probably should though.
834196644358979585 2017-02-21 00:22:33 UTC <RRanney1> Every time #Purdue gets it down to one they settle for a 3pt attempt and then let up an easy bucket in transition.
834189666807119872 2017-02-21 23:54:49 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue may trail, but only by 4. Felt like they played horrible and Penn State great, but only trail by 4. Water WILL find its level.
834112588204142592 2017-02-21 18:48:32 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich pork rinds, celery, Buffalo Wild Wings medium sauce hot wings, eggs, bacon, it ain't easy but stick with it...
833860159516585985 2017-02-20 02:05:29 UTC <RRanney1> Like #DIRECTVNOW price and channel lineup, but their connection issues and lack of roku support will likely lead to me dropping them.
833855631564083200 2017-02-20 01:47:29 UTC <RRanney1> @SethDavisHoops pic.twitter.com/tmFaQ7HOhx
832979011236151296 2017-02-18 15:44:06 UTC <RRanney1> @Espngreeny maybe they can trade him to the Pacers for Paul George and both clubs can hope change of scenery is all each star needs
832972841708498944 2017-02-18 15:19:36 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @IndyStarSports would probably be better off shopping Paul George and starting over from scratch
832298038832017408 2017-02-16 18:38:10 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich has Kravitz strong support of Crean surprised you at all? Seems like he is usually 1st to criticize local coaches.
832293535772729344 2017-02-16 18:20:16 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich am I wrong or should every team just look to foul Biggie & Haas constantly? Seems like that has been the way to beat PU.
832292635477999616 2017-02-16 18:16:42 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz are Paul Giammatti or Danny Devito available?

831537761496731649 2017-02-14 16:17:06 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 yet "protecting" us from gays and non christians got the old one a promotion.
831249568385871875 2017-02-13 21:11:55 UTC <RRanney1> @ScottEHorner @IndyStarSports @zkeefer @indystar Good riddance. Need to find another mid round Mathis and "someone else's Jerry Hughes".
829426943892324353 2017-02-08 20:29:28 UTC <RRanney1> @espn @MikeWellsNFL Colts have no business taking any 1st rounder. Indy has so many holes they should look to trade back multiple times.
827174051693129728 2017-02-02 15:17:16 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz what the hell, it is groundhogs day, not april fools day! This sucks, 1 of the few positions where the Colts were good.
826965437288218624 2017-02-01 01:28:19 UTC <RRanney1> Can't believe #PennState is less than 30 seconds from upsetting the #Hoosiers in Assembly Hall.
826524990480728064 2017-01-31 20:18:08 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom ...on a play where he was no doubt "not fouled"
826198720265859072 2017-01-30 22:41:39 UTC <RRanney1> @Mark_J_Boyle you overestimate large segment of the nation, he'd be 25% or better if he literally wiped his butt w/ bill of rights
825848550512873472 2017-01-29 23:30:12 UTC <RRanney1> Worst officiated #Purdue game this season. Hope the league reviews this game, though it will mean little to the Boilers.
825834025772253184 2017-01-29 22:32:29 UTC <RRanney1> @BoiledSports Minny did same, but refs at least blew the whistle, Purdue just failed to exploit Gophers foul troubles, this is far worse.
825827555177590784 2017-01-29 22:06:46 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom thoughts on officiating thus far? Seems like Purdue is getting manhandled with few calls.
823389622713597952 2017-01-22 04:39:18 UTC <RRanney1> @ChrisForman12 @PilotNewsdoug are we counting active roster or are practice squad players included as well?
821960810096369664 2017-01-18 06:01:43 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 it could have been a great moment for both him and the team, showing growth & maturity. Instead he decided to be himself.
821895772832731136 2017-01-18 01:43:16 UTC <RRanney1> @politico @GerryDick @realDonaldTrump huh. With his Education pick you would think he could have found a vegan to run the USDA.
821758528650153984 2017-01-18 16:37:55 UTC <RRanney1> @GoodmanESPN if he can't keep his team from fighting after tough loss then he has no business bringing em onto the court in the first place
817844118286192640 2017-01-07 21:23:27 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC do we EVER have an away game when our students are on fall break?
817420820612083713 2017-01-06 17:21:25 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle agree entirely. "Vote of confidence" is one of the most useless piles of crap in sports. If no news, no need to speak.
817420212492349440 2017-01-06 17:19:00 UTC <RRanney1> @mchappell51 what if good coach/gm unexpectedly get canned during/after playoffs? I want both gone but have no problem w/ Irsay being quiet.
817418273104994304 2017-01-06 17:11:17 UTC <RRanney1> @Schultz975 ...because you might end up with Darrell Hazell. You can think "things can't get any worse", but brother they can.
817190628220145664 2017-01-05 02:06:43 UTC <RRanney1> Great win #Purdue! Not pretty but a heck of a lot better than the Minny loss and in a venue where the Boilers almost never win.
815934044407992320 2017-01-02 14:53:30 UTC <RRanney1> People keep talking about how well Minny defended him, but they fouled him constantly and he didn't get to play when guys fouled out.https://twitter.com/PilotNewsdoug/status/815786351178162176
815933238363455489 2017-01-02 14:50:17 UTC <RRanney1> Needed either Haas or C. Edwards in the game to start OT, could've taken advantage of their interior foul trouble better with fresh bodies.https://twitter.com/PilotNewsdoug/status/815785975628566528
815726726948986880 2017-01-01 01:09:41 UTC <RRanney1> So did winning #JAXvsIND cost the Colts anything in draft position or help the Jags much? @MikeWellsNFL @mchappell51
815705294114344960 2017-01-01 23:44:31 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue foul, foul, foul, and foul some more make em earn it from the FT line
815703836031647744 2017-01-01 23:38:44 UTC <RRanney1> #Purdue playing like crap in OT, yet no substitutions until it is too late
815703412646039553 2017-01-01 23:37:03 UTC <RRanney1> Why no Haas and/or C. Edwards @BoilerBall?!
815701007657213960 2017-01-01 23:27:29 UTC <RRanney1> Come on @BoilerBall take this to OT and win it in the paint.
815689057594380288 2017-01-01 22:40:00 UTC <RRanney1> No reason #Colts should retain Pagano or Grigson, both may be good guys but just haven't done enough. AFC South won't stay this easy.
815685900776521728 2017-01-01 22:27:28 UTC <RRanney1> Would rather @BoilerBall not be trailing at the half, but shocked analysts are so supportive of Gophers getting into heavy foul trouble.
814831811373174784 2016-12-30 13:53:37 UTC <RRanney1> @bkravitz @PilotNewsdoug fairly certain you spoke similarly of Painter's hire as well, and it only took 2yrs. Did you say same of Tiller?
814504837341675520 2016-12-29 16:14:20 UTC <RRanney1> @AskEASupport @EAMaddenMobile horrendous customer support by EA. Day 5, still waiting on customer service response.
814249766137843712 2016-12-28 23:20:46 UTC <RRanney1> @AskEASupport day 4 of no response from EA customer support, re: Madden Cash not being delivered. Not terribly supportive of customers.
814249376428290048 2016-12-28 23:19:14 UTC <RRanney1> @EAMaddenMobile day 4 of no update from EA Support. Just what is the purpose of your customer service department?
813861796817813505 2016-12-27 21:39:07 UTC <RRanney1> @EAMaddenMobile day 3 of waiting for EA Customer Service response for Madden Cash not received
813795154205274114 2016-12-27 17:14:19 UTC <RRanney1> @AskEASupport day 3 of waiting on a response from EA "customer service" for Madden Cash never received due to the app crashing
810938329298505728 2016-12-19 20:02:18 UTC <RRanney1> @brianneubert seemed to hurt Mitrione, but then that assumes his draft stock was around the 3rd round as some of the previews said.
808735988159836161 2016-12-13 18:10:59 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich which coaches tend to build the best lines, guys who were a lineman or guys who played a skill position?
808735166483066880 2016-12-13 18:07:43 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich as a Purdue fan I'd love to see Grigson succeed, but he has done worse than Pagano. Both gotta go.
806515187117412353 2016-12-07 15:06:19 UTC <RRanney1> @DIRECTVNowHelp nope, just waiting on apple tv to ship and hoping some other devices (and LG smart tv) add apps for DirecTV Now.
806366729626681344 2016-12-06 05:16:24 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc ideally Brohm brings WKU staff but won't be shocked if $$$ lets him shop around. I may die of laughter if he got Hope to coach OL.
806321307176628224 2016-12-06 02:15:55 UTC <RRanney1> @jmanon @DIRECTVNowHelp then what is this about...pic.twitter.com/7z4ZoMICqt
806318168180457472 2016-12-06 02:03:26 UTC <RRanney1> @DIRECTVNowHelp need to revise the recent email about using DirecTV Now on your TV. It makes it seem like you guys ARE supporting Smart TVs.
805888306412224513 2016-12-05 21:35:19 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 how many assistant coaches does Fleck bring with him?
805505062378373121 2016-12-04 20:12:27 UTC <RRanney1> Don't really care if #Purdue ends up with Brohm, Fleck, Holtz, Calhoun, or Spack so long as they don't get the poison pill buyout Hazell had
805161557353177090 2016-12-03 21:27:29 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich also picked 2 other QBs (Henry and LSU's Etling) to start ahead of him BEFORE benching him in favor of David Blough
805160535633240064 2016-12-03 21:23:25 UTC <RRanney1> Woohoo Austin Appleby!!!
804737433149509632 2016-12-02 17:22:10 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich so you saying Purdue hired too likeable a guy in Hazell? Otherwise you'd think he could have been canned a year or more ago.
803091138659971076 2016-11-27 04:20:22 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar PU fans stopped watching because we've slid on rock bottom for 3yrs. But this is IU's high water mark, why so much apathy?
802000705183776769 2016-11-24 04:07:23 UTC <RRanney1> @DustinDopirak would help if Tolzien even pretended there was a chance he'd throw, that little fake so often makes the defender pause
801286130696077312 2016-11-22 04:47:55 UTC <RRanney1> @Grady should probably take Purdue's spot
801184870106013696 2016-11-22 22:05:32 UTC <RRanney1> If Purdue offers Les Miles, he better talk to Hazell, Hope, & Tiller. Burke may be gone but Purdue still has a lot working against it.
801183371007246336 2016-11-22 21:59:35 UTC <RRanney1> Fleck has proven he can be a good head coach at the D1 level, Olson only proven he can be an average or mediocre NFL OC.
801182594998136832 2016-11-22 21:56:30 UTC <RRanney1> Miles isn't the only canidate who'd be a break from tradition. If they manage to "steal" another BCS coach that'd be bigger.
800780126648696832 2016-11-21 19:17:14 UTC <RRanney1> big NAME, but style of play leaves a lot to be desired.
794537837727248384 2016-11-04 13:52:36 UTC <RRanney1> @tommchenry I recall you helping an old man at Walmart buy a Cubs blanket & telling you he'd be buried w/ it. Wonder if he got to see the WS
794247094017998848 2016-11-03 18:37:18 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @GreggDoyelStar also gotta wonder how Friday games may impact recruiting, big primetime games w/ few recruits able to attend.
794038451477712896 2016-11-02 04:48:14 UTC <RRanney1> Woohoo!!!  #WorldSeries
794032646032457728 2016-11-02 04:25:09 UTC <RRanney1> Wow. Tribe and Shaw falling apart in a hurry like Chapman and Cubs did earlier #WorldSeries
794024925250011136 2016-11-02 03:54:29 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich go ahead and say it, you know you want to... ..."in Joe we trust"
792732028609318914 2016-10-30 14:16:58 UTC <RRanney1> @SethDavisHoops and shouldn't the IRS wrap up its "audit" of Donald Trump any day now so he can finally turn over his tax returns?
792059068865060865 2016-10-28 17:42:52 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich just do a wildly inappropriate children's book about your life, maybe a pop up book
791698243650330624 2016-10-27 17:49:04 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich if you saw pulled groin on a injury report would you react the same as if you heard pulled scrotum?
789833969537720324 2016-10-22 14:21:07 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @GreggDoyelStar total BS. Anyone who stopped watching NFL because of these "protests" wasn't that invested anyway.
789833027543183360 2016-10-22 14:17:22 UTC <RRanney1> @OliverKamm can we revisit Hillary's "deplorables" comment and realize just how fitting it was?
789831303986159616 2016-10-22 14:10:31 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC guessing you "just realized" because the last few have been sooo forgettable.
789470421414400001 2016-10-21 14:16:30 UTC <RRanney1> @espn @billbarnwell @MikeWellsNFL Grigson needs to stick to cheaper FAs and trade back in the draft to load up on mid and later rd picks
789202971573690368 2016-10-20 20:33:45 UTC <RRanney1> @KyleNeubeck @PilotNewsdoug @Liberty_Ballers no one made the kid go to LSU, he could have gone overseas or NBDL. He chose LSU.
789162581122424832 2016-10-20 17:53:15 UTC <RRanney1> @indystar @HolderStephen @IndyStarSports yeah, that... and his inability to play the position anymore, those were his only issues
789161313175900160 2016-10-20 17:48:13 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich ouch, Todds on IUBB had a rough stretch there (hopefully Lindeman has avoided trouble) glad to see Jadlow is turning it around
789157128703320064 2016-10-20 17:31:35 UTC <RRanney1> agree Purdue better than 15 ranking, but they will be a VERY different team, nothing wrong with proving themselves
789155676920565760 2016-10-20 17:25:49 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich could be wrong but I doubt Fleck seriously considers Purdue, Polini wouldn't be a bad hire, but ideally Purdue finds passing guru

789135008791351297 2016-10-20 16:03:42 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar actually he hung out with these two which seems even weirder...pic.twitter.com/MfUw9lHIoM
788849102633050113 2016-10-19 21:07:36 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 do you think Purdue should go after Art Briles or is he too much of a PR nightmare?
788382740051701761 2016-10-18 14:14:27 UTC <RRanney1> @drewbrees good your palette has improved since PU where you asked for pork fritter covered in ranch cuz it looked like country fried steak
788039243226488833 2016-10-17 15:29:31 UTC <RRanney1> A nice little run on size & skill from Purdue. Still gotta hope we land Eastern tho, and if he ends up w/ MSU that'll be devastating.https://twitter.com/brianneubert/status/788029901790150656
788017797141889024 2016-10-17 14:04:18 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC you kidding? A purdue loss with Hazell fired was a big win for Purdue fans.
787761360562028544 2016-10-16 21:05:18 UTC <RRanney1> hopefully he finds another Tiller, but the odds seem against it and I can't help but be skeptical.
787760182755418113 2016-10-16 21:00:38 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @DaveG_Sports to be fair DH was 3-3 during Bobinski's time & his performance & bad contract are the reasons we have a new AD.
787759351993765888 2016-10-16 20:57:20 UTC <RRanney1> @MarkMontieth attracting a QB doesn't seem to be the problem. Protecting them & putting them in a situation to succeed seem bigger issues.
787740765812166656 2016-10-16 19:43:28 UTC <RRanney1> Halle-friggin-lujah! Hazell may have been a nice guy, but he DESTROYED Purdue football. Lets move on. #BoilerUp
787306722276745218 2016-10-15 14:58:44 UTC <RRanney1> @EAMaddenMobile what happened to stamina boost? It isn't showing up as an option anymore (but coin and xp boosts are)?
785305105117478912 2016-10-09 02:25:01 UTC <RRanney1> Disappointed Hillary doesn't just own it and not back down from it. If you embrace and encourage bigotry then you are indeed deplorable.https://twitter.com/KellyMcCreary/status/785303235934289920
784254169062346752 2016-10-06 04:48:59 UTC <RRanney1> actually in hindsight Hope was an incredible bargain, pennies on the dollar per win compared with Hazell.
784084875276001280 2016-10-06 17:36:16 UTC <RRanney1> Purdue fans as a whole need to stop showing up entirely. Sucks for  the players, but a glaring statement needs to be made.
783378994875936768 2016-10-04 18:51:21 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom he must not ride many roller coasters, most aren't rough, bumpy, all downhill, and then just ride off the rails.
783378157210435584 2016-10-04 18:48:01 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom we're also over 3/4 the way through Darrell Hazell's tenure at Purdue & first 80% tells us how the remaining 20% will look
783117904497614848 2016-10-03 01:33:52 UTC <RRanney1> I'm voting for #Indianapolis to receive a #BenefulDogPark makeover. Cast your vote! http://wm6.walmart.com/beneful
783067295979479040 2016-10-03 22:12:46 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC DH took a midlevel team and cemented them as the worst in the B10 by a wide margin. Any other industry he'd already be gone.
783055163481128960 2016-10-03 21:24:34 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC tragic, because there is no possible way Hazell turns this season around enough to save his job and everyone knows it
782985538202578944 2016-10-03 16:47:54 UTC <RRanney1> @ProducerKyle he is sadly the best they have, and they have whiffed so badly so often they couldn't afford to replace him
782973286791557120 2016-10-03 15:59:13 UTC <RRanney1> @newsmax @DougBenson they can't all be Sarah Palin... though that is probably a good thing, aside from the easy comedy material she provided
782971948707876864 2016-10-03 15:53:54 UTC <RRanney1> Come on #Purdue, #FireDarrellHazell already! At the very least fans will see you give a damn and you can openly pursue his replacement.
782970660129648640 2016-10-03 15:48:46 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar @IndyStarSports @indystar there is tons of interest in Purdue football, all of it centers on when they will fire Hazell tho
782970161808576513 2016-10-03 15:46:48 UTC <RRanney1> @DougBenson @newsmax a lot of Indiana residents will vote for Hillary in large part because of Pence being on Trump's ticket
782968810508685312 2016-10-03 15:41:25 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeAndMike only on organization in terms of keeping both Grigson & Pagano. Too many misses in draft & FA, too many slow starts in games.
782967705804558336 2016-10-03 15:37:02 UTC <RRanney1> @ScottWTHR @chickmcgee1 shouldn't he be wearing a seat belt? #safetyfirst
782951194192863234 2016-10-03 14:31:25 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC @BMurphySports @BoiledSports Long overdue. Wasn't done earlier because of the buyout & need for new AD to make the hire.
782949542543056898 2016-10-03 14:24:52 UTC <RRanney1> @Grady players have underperformed but much of that goes back to coaching. The slow starts HAVE to STOP! Need to start game like they trail.
782948476648689664 2016-10-03 14:20:37 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC unlike Hazell in year 1, Bobinski should review tape. Players can be mismanaged but its not like Burke held back Hazell.
782947065680637952 2016-10-03 14:15:01 UTC <RRanney1> @JeffWashburnJC not only poor recruiting or he'd at least beat more non Big Ten foes. Plus Hope left him decent talent, just undisciplined.
782667511972007936 2016-10-02 19:44:10 UTC <RRanney1> Agree completely. May expose defense, but the Colts don't score until they crank up the pace out of necessity, instead of by design.https://twitter.com/ReggieWayne_17/status/782627115346829312
782666492101832704 2016-10-02 19:40:07 UTC <RRanney1> Sums it up pretty well. Fans certainly care, but more about getting rid of Hazell than anything his teams do on Saturday.https://twitter.com/GreggDoyelStar/status/782587476313534465
780213728079773696 2016-09-25 01:13:43 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @jwgerard773 ...unless you lose like vs the Lions because you fail to put the game out of reach, could've had that today too
780212598591528960 2016-09-25 01:09:13 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @jwgerard773 never said a thing about playoffs, the issue is Luck not showing up until a heroic comeback is required
780208650052702208 2016-09-25 00:53:32 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @jwgerard773 as tough as Manning's first 5 years were he still didn't cut it as close as Luck has, 24 wins of 8pts or more vs 14.
780195262253846528 2016-09-25 00:00:20 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich @jwgerard773 absolutely, Peyton didn't have this many comebacks because he was too busy leading blowouts
780191015948783616 2016-09-25 23:43:28 UTC <RRanney1> @kim_ranney now on boomstick to show some hang time
780190828471869441 2016-09-25 23:42:43 UTC <RRanney1> @kim_ranney whew! That is a relief. Good to see the defense step up like that after a good showing today.
780188975335997440 2016-09-25 23:35:21 UTC <RRanney1> Did the #Colts just score too fast again? Don't have a repeat of the Lions last drive debacle.
779715490218254340 2016-09-24 16:13:53 UTC <RRanney1> Purdue cannot pass the ball with Hazell as coach, yet that will not stop them from trying (and failing). #BoilerUp
777277711983206400 2016-09-17 22:47:02 UTC <RRanney1> @IPLPower Seriously @iplpower, why in the world is power out at 6pm on Saturday when it hasn't rained in hours? Over half an hour on hold... thus far
776831509705601024 2016-09-16 17:13:59 UTC <RRanney1> @GreggDoyelStar against MSU in recruiting, a tsunami would be a more appropriate term than waves. Biggie was a rare exception.
776462354221367297 2016-09-15 16:47:05 UTC <RRanney1> @nbairdjc @GreggDoyelStar @indystar yep, hard not to have a defeatist attitude when constantly defeated

775117152797929472 2016-09-11 23:41:44 UTC <RRanney1> Getting sick of #Colts sick fetish for improbable comebacks. You may quite literally be killing your fans. #givingmeaheartcondition
772123587755016192 2016-09-03 17:26:23 UTC <RRanney1> The Darrell Hazel era cannot end soon enough. You have the lead, run the clock, run the ball, move onto the next game. Don't try to be cute

745723177347645441 2016-06-22 21:00:35 UTC <RRanney1> Love the #Pacers trading for Jeff Teague, assuming they extend his deal. Shocking that #Jazz gave up 12th pick for Hill.

727171612869455872 2016-05-02 16:23:17 UTC <RRanney1> Love the #Colts draft. Maybe a year too late to find protection for Luck, but better late than never. Haeg & Blythe were awesome value late.
710611140997328896 2016-03-17 23:37:53 UTC <RRanney1> @clubtrillion @MichaelBruesh can't count on the refs that late in the game, all crews seem to swallow their whistle towards the end
710609367230361600 2016-03-17 23:30:50 UTC <RRanney1> Epic fail #Purdue. Feel ashamed, very ashamed. Mostly falls on the coaches, totally wasted the best frontcourt in the nation.
710608465941495808 2016-03-17 23:27:15 UTC <RRanney1> Should've put in Swanigan and Haas a long time ago, this loss will be on Painter. #Purdue very disappointing, even if they win.
710606926917140480 2016-03-17 23:21:08 UTC <RRanney1> Why in the world hasn't #Purdue made a substitution?! This lineup isn't working!
710304556052254720 2016-03-16 03:19:37 UTC <RRanney1> @GoldandBlackcom How many of Purdue's players have experience playing in Colorado's altitude via @usabasketball tryouts?
707325625632169984 2016-03-08 22:02:25 UTC <RRanney1> @JMV1070 solid so far. Cole move is a bit of a head scratcher, but wonder what cap hit was if they cut rather than redoing his deal?
707324982016274432 2016-03-08 21:59:51 UTC <RRanney1> @kk_mr93 If only one day... the Flash. You could get a ridiculous amount of stuff done and still have time to spare.
707324139019878401 2016-03-08 21:56:30 UTC <RRanney1> @MikeWellsNFL Too bad. Werner seemed like a nice guy with some upside. I was hoping if nothing else he'd be a serviceable backup.
707224100930977792 2016-03-08 15:18:59 UTC <RRanney1> @pwilson24 Hopefully #Colts look to draft for pass rush, tho not necessarily the 1st rd, need a bustproof pick there or trade back.
707222078479572992 2016-03-08 15:10:57 UTC <RRanney1> Awesome to see #Colts retain @Dallen83! Now just get him the ball more.
705839544860422144 2016-03-04 19:37:16 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich seems "personal" combine questions are mostly about seeing if you can get a rise out of the player or shake them "off script"
699665314997473280 2016-02-16 18:43:04 UTC <RRanney1> @dandakich Why so supportive of the moves in IU football, yet down on the head coach, who Glass not only retained but gave more $?
