972098532533522432 2018-03-09 13:15:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @MarconeAntelius Thank you, sir. It comes with the territory. I'm not really bothered by it as much as saddened that there are people this angry and bitter out there where the only solace is to insult someone's work online anonymously.
971984299128897536 2018-03-08 05:41:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Actual comment I received on the @LivingIn8Bits YouTube channel tonight. This very angry person is a ray of positive sunshine and should be a motivational speaker.   The joys of being a filmmaker and putting your work out there....pic.twitter.com/NgkJDHKcN5
971931650757201920 2018-03-08 02:12:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> News of Smash Bros coming to the Switch is neat. But then while playing online tonight, I remember once again how much I hate Smash Bros players.
971545699010662402 2018-03-07 00:38:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Spent my snow day finishing the original Bayonetta. Truthfully, I found the game frustrating, repetitive, and annoying. Not a particularly fun experience. Hopefully Bayonetta 2 is more fun.
971544850784022529 2018-03-07 00:35:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I always feel like I've been hit by a dump truck after shoveling, especially the wet and heavy snow like today's storm brought.
971434726170005506 2018-03-07 17:17:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My snow day will likely be filled with a lot of video games and TV watching. Wouldn't have it any other way.
970894183149039616 2018-03-05 05:29:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ShadowTodd Not unless you count Octavia Spencer on AL-TV.https://twitter.com/alyankovic/status/939160812471459841?lang=en
970522374746595329 2018-03-04 04:52:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And there we have it folks. Another #Oscars come and gone. Thanks for indulging my annual tweeting that had absolutely no significance or importance whatsoever beyond me musing some of my internal thoughts in written form. Goodnight everybody!
970519729940193281 2018-03-04 04:41:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Take 2 #Oscars
970512687422754816 2018-03-04 04:13:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No lifetime achievement award this year? #Oscars
970511816232177665 2018-03-04 04:10:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very nice performance by Eddie Vedder. Lost some great talent. #Oscars
970507993321271296 2018-03-04 03:55:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Keala Settle is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I get chills every time she sings. #Oscars
970506647734046721 2018-03-04 03:49:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I may not have cared much for the Blade Runner movies, but I can't deny they are beautiful looking films. Definitely deserved. #Oscars
970503786719531009 2018-03-04 03:38:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Original screenplay was an incredibly tough category this year. I loved those screenplays. #Oscars
970501926407294977 2018-03-04 03:31:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I really want to go make my movie now after that piece. #Oscars
970490645805785089 2018-03-04 02:46:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil @adamsdayoff We're all failures in the Pixar movie fandom category. It's on my Netflix queue.
970489572076421120 2018-03-04 02:41:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I still need to see Coco. #Oscars
970489044340703233 2018-03-04 02:39:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Kobe Bryant has won an Oscar. That is something I didn't think I'd say. But go Philly. #Oscars
970485204476456964 2018-03-04 02:24:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Rita Moreno is still awesome. 'Nuff said. #Oscars
970478174860664832 2018-03-04 01:56:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I loved that 90 years of movies montage. #Oscars
970474412100243457 2018-03-04 01:41:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm not a fan of the wide angle steadicam right up in the presenters faces onstage. #Oscars
970471528474300417 2018-03-04 01:30:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The envelopes are very obviously labeled this year. #Oscars
970469211700154368 2018-03-04 01:21:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Whenever I see Sam Rockwell, I think of that moment I realized he was in the original TMNT movie (which is beyond awesome). #Oscarshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEWLnvqOsls
970468066764214273 2018-03-04 01:16:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very nice start by Jimmy Kimmel. #Oscars
970462895254499329 2018-03-04 00:55:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love the #Oscars every year and continue to dream. Hopefully one day....
970329220063944706 2018-03-04 16:04:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I would've loved to be in the room for this.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLFEvHWD_NE
970135449065881600 2018-03-03 03:14:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love the amazing songs on The Greatest Showman's soundtrack. In needed inspiration after this week's craziness, @missmalindakat's cover of This Is Me is awesome and makes me jealous as hell that I never had great signing talent.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckM97kSinLw
970131365659402240 2018-03-03 02:58:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Being terrified multiple times a day shouldn't be something that citizens should go through.https://twitter.com/greenhousenyt/status/970122791596052480

969696757440483330 2018-03-02 22:11:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan I did a handful of Top 10 videos a few years ago and still get insane hate insult messages several times a week. And then the comments (sometimes essays) I get on No Footing are ones to behold. It is quite baffling, indeed.
969680575475970049 2018-03-02 21:07:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Was totally about to tweet this and then you beat me to it.https://twitter.com/mikeyil/status/969679837936979968

969046275554410496 2018-02-28 03:06:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> When you're having a bad week, but you come home from work to find an adorable package from the girlfriend, instantly brightening your day.pic.twitter.com/v1HmnCkCGC
968745299681382402 2018-02-27 07:10:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Insomnia musings: I'm fairly certain I would be a far more successful, wealthier filmmaker if I was a much meaner and sleazier person. But I guess I wouldn't be me if that were the case. One of many things on my mind tonight as I can't sleep.
968274622214033409 2018-02-26 00:00:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Praying for a speedy recovery, sir. I've met you many times and you've been a cordial sweetheart and inspiration to me every time.https://twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith/status/968038297200091136
968273432130609152 2018-02-26 23:55:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sure, the draft dodger with bone spurs (where he couldn't remember which foot they were in) would've run in without a weapon. This man's arrogance knows no bounds. How people continue to support him is insane.http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-bump-stocks-congress-act/story?id=53362605
967852480154480641 2018-02-25 20:03:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And of course @Vimeo and @VimeoStaff's recent policy changes to 5gb storage limits gets in the way of doing anything productive on the platform without being strong armed into paying them money. What a crock.
967530798999113729 2018-02-24 22:44:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally got to see Black Panther today and it was pretty damn awesome. Ryan Coogler has knocked it out of the park twice with franchise movies/characters. He's one hell of a director. I can't be the only to say it, but can we give him a Star Wars movie?
967524307906768896 2018-02-24 22:19:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Wouldn't be part of my Marvel movie experience without waiting around to see @TheJimmyV in the credits!pic.twitter.com/7qYbiqsAk1
967409208302952448 2018-02-24 14:41:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am back home in cold and rainy Jersey. Missing the warmth, palm trees, and sunsets of Clearwater. It was a nice week long escape from the tumultuous current events.pic.twitter.com/4Gj6bflFGz
967057258801762309 2018-02-23 15:23:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Who has a knack for getting to their gate 2 hours before their flight? This guy. Going to do some fine reading while waiting.pic.twitter.com/kjTa0k0Udx
966533856810733568 2018-02-21 04:43:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just a thought: If you are so devoid of basic human empathy that you  need a cheat sheet of talking points where one of those is "5. I hear  you," then you should not be a public official of any kind.
966529877410287616 2018-02-21 04:27:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also, "5. I hear you" is beyond embarrassing. If you need to write that down as a talking point note, you should not be President.
966529540788031488 2018-02-21 04:26:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been away over the past week so I haven't been able to keep up with the news as much as I usually do. But I am thoroughly inspired by the teenagers using their voice as they're soon be able to use their vote. I am hopeful for the next generation.
965030072817274880 2018-02-17 01:07:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I very much want to see Black Panther but I'm out of town for a week for work. I'm hoping one of these nights I can get out to see it. If not, got to wait until I get home next weekend.
964355884951388161 2018-02-15 04:28:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This interview with 2 students is worth a watch. Kelsey's story is heartbreaking and David's words are poignant, direct, and important. I want these students to go to Congress and address them to their faces.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoM2_0qvaIU
964346860881301505 2018-02-15 03:53:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You made an absurdly irresponsible video where you wrapped bacon around an assault rifle, fired it to cook it, and then ate the bacon off the gun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZGaJrd3x8  You contribute to the gun fetish, offer only prayers, and happily cash your NRA checks. Shame on you.https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz/status/963885539274510336
963944481811783680 2018-02-14 01:14:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thoughts and prayers while happily cashing checks.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-nra-funding-senators.html
963926250229248001 2018-02-14 00:01:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am sincerely far too heartbroken and angry that I do not even know what to say anymore. But what else is there to say that hasn't been said ad nauseum? Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need legislative action. We're supposed to be better than this as a nation.
963905692506652678 2018-02-14 22:40:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Heartbroken once again. When will we as a nation finally do something?https://twitter.com/DanRather/status/963872256039383040
963624963726036993 2018-02-13 04:04:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Oh man, this NFL Films production of the Super Bowl is an amazing watch. As an Eagles fan, I still cannot believe this is real. #FlyEaglesFlyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_RHOB9xkqo

963278799638073344 2018-02-12 05:08:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @retrowaretv @IAmMyOwnMusical I believe we did! That was an awesome night.
963278689965395969 2018-02-12 05:08:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @IAmMyOwnMusical @retrowaretv And yes, she is just as amazing live.
963278242810617862 2018-02-12 05:06:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @IAmMyOwnMusical @retrowaretv I saw her in Allegiance a couple years ago. Got her autograph.pic.twitter.com/RYV5NC7f4P
963278108701986816 2018-02-12 05:06:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @retrowaretv @IAmMyOwnMusical Previous tweet. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zlNCkUwFTU We've done several musicals at this film camp: Born to Run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZBn2Om0rgU Life's a Happy Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6iY-nGOSj8 Lonely Island Medley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIFNhabPNkM  And I did a production of Avenue Q before. I was Trekkie.
963276189661048832 2018-02-12 04:58:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @retrowaretv Funny enough you say that. When I taught a film camp, we did our own rendition of One Day More from Les Mis. I was Valjean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zlNCkUwFTU
963273685275762688 2018-02-12 04:48:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In a musical mood lately, which of course makes me want to make a musical film. I wish I was a more talented musician and had the ability to write a musical to make a film out of.
963209632390045696 2018-02-12 00:34:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @CinescapeCast If beer acts as currency that pays production costs, sure.
962914453007339520 2018-02-11 05:01:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage As do I, sir. As do I.
962914022298398720 2018-02-11 04:59:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's sad to say it. I miss producing consistent videos. But we're all older now with real life responsibilities. With less viewership and return on financial and time investment, the incentive just isn't there anymore. The dynamic changed too much, unfortunately.
962912756633661440 2018-02-11 04:54:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've always tried to maintain a certain level of production value which prohibits consistent weekly content. That then hurts us in the algorithm and views have decreased dramatically. Gone are the days when we were a channel on the rise with big numbers.
962912142826536960 2018-02-11 04:51:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> People wonder why I don't actively pursue producing more videos for YouTube that much anymore. The truth is that the system is stacked against us. Over the past year, I've put out 12 videos with only one barely cracking 4 digits. Most now struggle to reach 100+ views.
961661901632622592 2018-02-08 18:03:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Some photos I took of the Eagles Super Bowl Championship Parade! What a day! #FlyEaglesFlypic.twitter.com/sRfn9o76vB

960714439468175361 2018-02-05 03:19:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt Even last night, UMass had rioting after the loss. So please don't perpetuate the myth that it is somehow exclusive to Philly. The extreme vast majority was positive euphoria with a handful of idiots.

960713942938083330 2018-02-05 03:17:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt It was tears, hugging, and chants. A couple idiots, yes, but the extreme majority was joyous euphoria.

Sometimes I'll go weeks sleeping fine and then I'll have weeks like this one where I can't sleep for 3 nights. The fact that it has put me out of commission canceling my plans today has me extremely annoyed. I'm not a happy Mikey today.

958543925689618432 2018-01-30 03:34:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've said it before and I'll say it again: I miss having respect for the President and long for the days when that respect can return. I will do everything I can to help make sure things change come the November 2018 election and beyond.
958540436796313608 2018-01-30 03:20:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just a reminder to pundits: the ability to successfully read prepared remarks written by someone else on a teleprompter doesn't suddenly make you dignified or respectable. It also doesn't automatically negate past petulant behavior.
958535187465457665 2018-01-30 02:59:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Has anybody else noticed that for over 20 minutes, he won't even look to his right at the Democratic side? They won't give him his adulation, so instead he claps for himself.
958532310546157570 2018-01-30 02:48:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This man is horrible in ways that are unimaginable. But what is worse to me are those enablers standing, hooting, and hollering in the interest of their own party and donors' power. What a disgrace.
958522048329977856 2018-01-30 02:07:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seeing the Sergeant at Arms introduce the President of the United States and then seeing that horrible man enter the chambers just invokes an utter sadness unlike none other. Sigh.
958517178390712320 2018-01-30 01:47:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So can't wait for the State of the Uniom.
958208438961569792 2018-01-29 05:21:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've already deleted a half dozen videos and I'm still not under @Vimeo's new ridiculous and downright insulting storage limit policy. It is impossible to host anything of substance anymore without being strong armed into paying. @VimeoStaff should be ashamed of themselves.pic.twitter.com/RIo7AwjbbF
958202954024185856 2018-01-29 04:59:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Vimeo @BoterBug They informed us a week ago. And when I wrote to tell them what nonsense it was, they literally suggested, and I'm not making this up, to just create multiple accounts instead.
958161674468503552 2018-01-29 02:15:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been playing Rainbow Connection on my guitar a lot recently because I need something positive and inspirational in my life with all of this insanity going on.
958144777165385728 2018-01-29 01:08:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I can not understand how anybody can look at what is happening with the President and majority party and think that it is not only okay, but enthusiastically support it.  Utterly disgraceful and frightening.
957736656710389763 2018-01-28 22:06:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @JoeGoesRetro Those "feel the power" stickers aren't kidding.
957732845589495809 2018-01-28 21:51:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This air dryer was abnormally powerful.pic.twitter.com/QrYG8tOq5n
957720547315634176 2018-01-28 21:02:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally got to see @LadyBirdMovie and I really, really liked it. It resonated so much with some parts hitting very close to home making me glassy eyed. Very well deserving of its accolades.
957462569958150144 2018-01-27 03:57:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @johndelia I have sincerely tried to find and experience the aspect that appeals to everyone. It actually really bugs me because I feel like I should love these movies. I know how well made they are. I'll let it sit for some time and try again in a few months or year.
957461200517894150 2018-01-27 03:51:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @johndelia For reals, I own both movies on blu-ray. The original never did anything for me no matter how many times I've watched it. 2049 is visually stunning but very long to its detriment. I have sincerely tried to love them, but they do little for me which seems sacrilege as a film buff.
957457741462822912 2018-01-27 03:38:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @johndelia pic.twitter.com/rdHah45StH
957456301126246400 2018-01-27 03:32:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I watched Blade Runner 2049 again. Although it is visually stunning and overall well made, the Blade Runner movies just do nothing for me. Not to say I hate them or think they're bad. I appreciate the artistry that goes into them. I just can't explain why they don't appeal to me.
957357071107751939 2018-01-27 20:58:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is going to be extremely unpopular to say, but I never cared much for the original Blade Runner and I don't quite get 2049 either. That being said, I do plan to watch it again this weekend. Maybe it just requires a 2nd viewing. We'll see.

957010471827247110 2018-01-26 22:00:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> As I have asked time and time again: how can anybody continue to excuse this petulant behavior by the President?https://twitter.com/TheLeadCNN/status/956997954769846272
956646280687742984 2018-01-25 21:53:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So @VimeoStaff's canned response to me about their storage cut was just to create multiple @Vimeo accounts to compensate. What an absolutely insulting response. Why cut storage space but offer unlimited acounts? What a crock. It is an insult to longtime users.
956306973955362827 2018-01-24 23:25:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 Pro controller first and foremost. A carry case would be a good idea if you plan to take it around in handheld mode a lot.
956298412978311169 2018-01-24 22:51:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So now @Vimeo is screwing over by cutting storage limit from 25gb to 5gb, which makes it all but impossible to host any decent amount of content. To keep using it, I have to delete old videos to make space. What a way to strong arm into paid plans. What a load of crap, Vimeo.
956020101597290499 2018-01-23 04:25:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm not in any of the entertainment unions, but I totally would if I could just to receive the award season screeners for all the movies I haven't gotten to see.
955934834513383424 2018-01-23 22:46:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've lost track of the number of times I've felt sorrow over yet another mass shooting.

955635267372769280 2018-01-22 02:56:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also worth noting how much I miss someone who can speak with eloquent class, proper grammar, and use complete and coherent sentences.
955632853513048064 2018-01-22 02:46:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm currently watching David Letterman's interview with Barack Obama on Netflix and I'm immediately remembering, missing, and longing for what it was like to have respect and admiration for the President of the United States.
955606283993997312 2018-01-22 01:01:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A very important read about the majority's party willingness to excuse the behavior of our petulant and unfit President.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/20/opinion/the-Republicans-Guide-to-Presidential-Etiquette.html

951668511113465856 2018-01-11 04:13:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was sincerely hoping to avoid current events for the start of 2018, primarily for my own mental health. The continuous downward spiral has been exhausting and heartbreaking. But we are barely 2 weeks in and it has been impossible to avoid. It is beyond disgraceful. For shame.
951620024548065287 2018-01-11 01:01:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The President of the United States sinks to yet another low. How anybody can continue to support and excuse this man's behavior is baffling to me. This is beyond disgraceful.https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/951568993458053121

950178734623088641 2018-01-07 01:33:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil It never sparked my interest when the first couple initially came out and now that there are 86 of them, I haven't had a chance or desire to catch up.
950175013805658118 2018-01-07 01:19:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil Go figure, apparently it has already happened and now I am stupid. Would you believe me if I told you that I have not seen one single Fast & Furious movie? Not even scenes beyond a trailer.
950174142187425793 2018-01-07 01:15:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I also now want to see Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson team up in a movie together. #GoldenGlobes

949663942833471488 2018-01-06 15:28:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing says intelligence and competence like self proclaiming to be "like, really smart" and "a very stable genius." Also, nothing greatly disproves a book saying you are childish like acting childish. Genius smart people on Twitter generally know how to thread a tweet, though.
949510493110140928 2018-01-05 05:18:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I personally loved The Last Jedi. It was an exhilarating experience for me. I feel like so much of the hate stems from how much of the film is unexpected and some are upset that their theories weren't correct or didn't repeat redundant story aspects from previous movies.
949508254240997376 2018-01-05 05:09:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @TheJimmyV I haven't experienced Comic-Con, but I could only imagine how it would be if something like that went viral there. Magfest is 24 hours for its duration, so the insanity goes all hours of the night, hence staying away from the convention hotel when sleep is needed.
949506719062863872 2018-01-05 05:03:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @TheJimmyV It does get old pretty quickly, but truthfully, it wouldn't be Magfest without it. Every time I've gone, I've stayed in a hotel across the street, so luckily haven't experienced middle of the night Colossus roars. Sad I couldn't go again.
949504997472993280 2018-01-05 04:56:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TheJimmyV I've been to Magfest several times and this is very much a real thing. Our first year there with @LivingIn8Bits, we did a video recap and did a segment about the Colossus roar.https://youtu.be/1TFi6XMJbfg?t=8m46s

948368175175032832 2018-01-02 01:39:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What is worse are the people who are proud of and relish this petulant behavior. The @GOP made their bed with this insanity in the interest of their own power and are actively allowing a madman to drive our country down a path of what I fear will be irreparable danger.
948361810427695104 2018-01-02 01:14:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The President of the United States is a man who is in no way of sound mind. How can the @GOP continue to support such petulance and reckless abandon for general decency, intelligence, coherence, and competence? It is insane and absolutely disgraceful. It's only day 2 of 2018.

947992823483297792 2018-01-01 00:47:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My favorite of the Mummers string bands today was Fralinger, but maybe I'm biased from being a movie buff. http://phl17.com/2018/01/01/fralinger-string-band-at-the-2018-mummers-parade/  But a close second is definitely Duffy.

947906116062728192 2018-01-01 19:03:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Wouldn't be a New Years Day without watching the Mummers String Bands perform. Always a favorite for me.

947301539332452353 2017-12-30 03:01:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I was able to get myself a couple boxes. Not going to lie, it isn't that good. Kind of disappointed.
947135545767063552 2017-12-30 16:01:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't mind that a President golfs. What I mind is blatant hypocrisy.

946766215573397504 2017-12-29 15:33:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Squarepainter It's even scarier that there are people who enable and support this stupidity and ignorance in the interest of their own power and agenda. Sigh. I tried to stay away from this nonsense for Christmas/New Years, but sometimes it can't be avoided....

944664621251735552 2017-12-23 20:22:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "E pluribus unum" has been the motto on the great seal of the United States since our country's founding.

944438277188317184 2017-12-22 05:23:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Played this incredibly arrogant player and had one of the most satisfying spikes ever.

943951019364552707 2017-12-21 21:07:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There is nothing quite like sitting in the theater seeing "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...." and hearing the Star Wars theme playing as the opening crawl scrolls. That will never get old for me.

942613551583285248 2017-12-17 04:32:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sarahbbraun Those Steadicam operators deserve a good chiropractor/masseuse afterwards. That is impressive that they were able to do that for 3 straight hours with little breaks not counting days/weeks of rehearsals.
942546452450107392 2017-12-17 00:06:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And of course, I got very excited when I saw Joseph Robinette's name in the opening credits of #AChristmasStoryLive
942524665565777921 2017-12-17 22:39:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm excited about the A Christmas Story musical broadcast tonight mainly because the book was written by Joseph Robinette, an acting professor I had while in college.

942086085433315330 2017-12-16 17:36:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Force Awakens made me feel like a kid again with a sense of cinematic joy I hadn't felt in years. Rogue One gave me a Star Wars movie from a different perspective that I didn't know I wanted. And The Last Jedi challenged the norms with new themes and ideas. I loved all 3.
942066960094973953 2017-12-16 16:20:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @CinescapeCast I love that there is so much to discuss and dissect about it. Kind of wish I had my own movie review blog or channel now to talk about it, but alas we never went in that direction.
942064554850299904 2017-12-16 16:11:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great analysis of The Last Jedi. Don't read/open unless you have seen it.http://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-jedi-defense/
941862085071441920 2017-12-15 02:46:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Of all the many iconic Star Wars themes composed by John Williams, the Force theme is one that will give me chills every time I hear it. It's one of the most powerful pieces of music ever written for a movie (and in general).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcZ9kQ1h-ZY
941786055916838912 2017-12-15 21:44:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, one thing for sure is that the reactions to The Last Jedi have been quite polarizing. I personally loved it with the exception of some lag in a middle section. Seems to be a trend with all Star Wars sequels historically. Empire and Jedi had many detractors initially.
941540836315189249 2017-12-14 05:30:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @retrowaretv The Last Jedi was great! To me, the only thing about Blade Runner 2049 that tops The Last Jedi to me is that its run time is longer. That's about it.
941529397600931840 2017-12-14 04:44:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @rianjohnson I did read a couple of the reviews now and many of them contain spoilers that ruin surprise moments. Definitely avoid reviews and spoilers at all costs. It makes the viewing experience that much more special. "Don't be a Homer" as @HamillHimself puts it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZRFA0cLaM
941527123751292929 2017-12-14 04:35:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Here's what I tweeted out earlier. I loved it and felt a whirlwind of emotions watching it. It's so hard to talk about any aspect of it without spoiling and I certainly don't want to be a Homer as @HamillHimself puts it. How about you? What did you think?https://twitter.com/MixedNutsMikey/status/941504264744112128
941526120108879872 2017-12-14 04:31:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 It varies theater to theater. Some have stadium seating. This particular one has reclining seats.
941504264744112128 2017-12-14 03:04:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Star Wars: The Last Jedi is exhilarating. The many emotions I felt cannot be described without spoiling it. Don't worry, the trailers didn't spoil the movie at all. It was amazing! @rianjohnson made one hell of a Star Wars movie that left me squealing in geeky glee and tears.

941413703181918209 2017-12-14 21:04:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MikeBGameGenie @cwr2 Makes sense. I actually find it harder playing in 2 player. I haven't replayed it in a while after playing through Contra 4 earlier in the year (which was hard as hell).
941412516030287872 2017-12-14 21:00:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MikeBGameGenie @cwr2 I used to be good at Contra no death runs but it's been a few years since I've been able to do it. I haven't replayed it regularly enough in recent years. I can still do a no code run easily, though.
941357701589884929 2017-12-14 17:22:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just going to put it out there. I have zero tolerance for anybody making smartass remarks in response to victims of mass gun violence and a plea to address it.
941344284514627584 2017-12-14 16:29:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I asked that you keep it to yourself today and you refuse to respect that.
941338969555554304 2017-12-14 16:07:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That is true. But as we've observed that the lust for power takes precedent and once they feel the tides of that slipping, they may turn on each other to save themselves.
941336434367238145 2017-12-14 15:57:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel hopeful that is attainable after the what happened in Alabama and the previous state elections. It is mind boggling to me that 5 years later nothing has been done and even worse massacres have occurred since. It is unbelievable.
941334197268041728 2017-12-14 15:48:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am only going to say this once. I am not in the mood for your right wing nonsense today. Kindly keep it to yourself or take it somewhere else.

941096471948034049 2017-12-13 00:04:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa The wait hasn't been bad until this week. Basically after it premiered Saturday night and now seeing reviews pop up. So hard to avoid all!
941096264250417152 2017-12-13 00:03:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Probably be right around when I'll be getting out my time. I'll be thinking of you.

941091529657110528 2017-12-13 23:44:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino 7pm is where it's at. Longest 24 hours since the last Star Wars movie.
941090781430984704 2017-12-13 23:41:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In 24 hours, I'll be sitting in a theater waiting to watch Star Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi. I am so stoked.

940791452774387713 2017-12-12 03:52:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The past two elections have restored a bit of my faith in the country. I proudly donated to Doug Jones' campaign and am thrilled to see him as the winner apparent in the special election in Alabama. Time to keep up the fight and onward to the midterms.
940611432185462784 2017-12-12 15:56:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There is only one evil in that race and his name is Roy.
940588667567067137 2017-12-12 14:26:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear Alabama, please don't screw this up today. Praying they elect Doug Jones.
940417805198987264 2017-12-11 03:07:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I really would love to make another feature film. Unfortunately time, money, and adulting limit the logistical feasibility. Very nostalgic for being on long form narrative sets tonight.

Cherry picking a few corrected errors doesn't discredit the entire story at large. Journalism is about getting all the facts right, not fitting some twisted narrative.
939612098824495104 2017-12-09 21:45:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 @Buried_On_Mars All news outlets & people make an error at some point. Reputable ones report retractions and corrections, as in this singular case here. Clinging to such minute inconsistencies is desperation. News isn't fake because it doesn't fit a predisposed narrative or Trump's fragile ego.
939545842620526592 2017-12-09 17:22:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 So that automatically discredits all 9 women who accused an already horrible man with a history of saying/doing awful things? Or is that just selective outrage/believing? Also, you share a CNN article after diatribes of why you irrationally distrust it.

938637062269480960 2017-12-06 05:11:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It always seems to me that anybody who has ever done musical theater did a production of The Music Man at some point in their lives. And the general consensus is always the same: nobody ever likes The Music Man. It's like a right of passage for theater peeps.
938614672219140097 2017-12-06 03:42:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 Yet you dismiss the myriad of instances I just gave where from his own mouth he brags about the exploits by abusing his power, all of which constitute as sexual misconduct, harassment, and/or assault. And the lawsuit going on right now is indeed sexual assault.
938613114899230726 2017-12-06 03:36:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 And actual lawsuit being filed against him right now. But I'm sure you show the same due diligence in believing accusers of Roy Moore, Bill O'Reilly, and Roger Ailes, right?https://www.npr.org/2017/12/05/568618889/lawsuit-could-put-trumps-sexual-misconduct-accusers-back-in-spotlight

938281044842774528 2017-12-05 05:36:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is really, really funny. I didn't expect to laugh as much as I did. https://twitter.com/cafedotcom/status/938113263648227328

936979418962186240 2017-12-02 15:24:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Shame on the Republican party for clearly showing that they care more about their wealthy donors and party's power over the country. This past year has been a nightmare and we're all going to pay for the consequences for years to come.
936668077592399873 2017-12-01 18:47:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have no patience or tolerance for people who defend the indefensible. I just witnessed a friend of a friend arguing and legitimately believing that infamous Access Hollywood tape is proof of consensual relations because of the phrase "let you do it." How much lower can we get?
936456050848477184 2017-11-30 04:44:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Although he isn't running for my state, I donated to @GDouglasJones's Senate campaign. I am hopeful the people of Alabama vote for him. We need to have faith restored that good people can still be elected in this country.
936420753045680130 2017-11-30 02:24:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I did recently find the Macarena monkey from A Search into Destiny. Major plot point. It still works 20 years later. @KOConnorJr @adamsdayoffpic.twitter.com/1b2ZqD7CEF
936410361095491584 2017-11-30 01:43:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very unlikely. Little reason to completely re-edit a 30 minute movie shot on VHS 20 years ago that is not exactly -- good. I didn't quite understand what generational copying was back then or how badly VHS looks nowadays.
936381218777640960 2017-11-30 23:47:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's amazing what a difference on year makes during those fragile early teenager years.  I wish I had a cleaner copy of it. The original tape is so many generations down and a tracking nightmare. I do still have the raw, though. Special edition re-edit?
936375041218015234 2017-11-30 23:23:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @thegamechasers This football is also flat. See, look how flat it is. What's that? You want me to back the camera up to see its full view and perspective? No, I just proved it was flat.pic.twitter.com/DDuwRLWmSF

936358016370315264 2017-11-30 22:15:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf Epicenter of the Earthquake was near Dover, Delaware.http://6abc.com/weather/51-magnitude-earthquake-hits-near-dover-delaware-/2718716/
936356929324056577 2017-11-30 22:11:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seems to be that we did indeed have an earthquake that came out of Dover, Delaware. http://6abc.com/weather/51-magnitude-earthquake-hits-near-dover-delaware-/2718716/
936354653650018304 2017-11-30 22:02:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuakesToday @RewindMike So I guess that was indeed an earthquake I felt here in South Jersey.
936353826310942720 2017-11-30 21:58:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf I believe there's fracking in PA, but not that I know of drilling wise in South Jersey. But whatever I felt was felt in Philly.
936353290106830848 2017-11-30 21:56:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino We had one in 2011 that actually damaged part of the Washington Monument and Smithsonian. I didn't feel it because I was mowing the lawn at the time. But this I was sitting at my computer and everything shook.
936352582846513152 2017-11-30 21:53:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @thelindsayellis I felt something here in South Jersey.
936352471848570882 2017-11-30 21:53:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So, ummm, everything here in South Jersey just shook for a couple seconds. I thought, "Hmmm, that's odd." Now I see on Twitter asking about an earthquake in Philly. I think we just had an earthquake.
936005928880570369 2017-11-29 22:56:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Again, how can anybody think that this man is of sound mind? How can anyone continue to defend/support this persistent narcissistic, petulant, petty, and downright dangerous behavior and rhetoric? It is unbelievable how low we've sunk.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/935946546344005632
935908435337662466 2017-11-29 16:28:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage But how much irreparable damage must be done before it is over? How can any person be okay with this day after day? It's come to the point where we're all, myself included, just numb.
935905380768591872 2017-11-29 16:16:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How could anybody look at the President every day and think that he is a man of sound mind? Not only that, proudly proclaim "Yeah, he's my guy?"
935893137595293696 2017-11-29 15:28:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Never in my life would I think we would see a movie like Avengers: Infinity War.

934152115974475778 2017-11-24 20:09:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey I'm also half joking. I'm looking forward to it. I actually had relatively positive high school experience. Just funny that I've become nerdier/geekier in my older age and now am professionally geeky/nerdy.
934094510375698432 2017-11-24 16:21:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alycatphotos One thing is for sure. I'm at least a professional geek/dork/nerd now!

933353891957301248 2017-11-22 15:18:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen.

933080585098100737 2017-11-21 21:12:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> By the way, #NetNeutrality is not tin foil hat government control. This comic by The Oatmeal from a couple years ago illustrates how Net Neutrality works and why it's important.http://theoatmeal.com/blog/net_neutrality

931633357104009216 2017-11-17 21:21:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TheJimmyV I believe ultimately it's the victim of a hodge podge reactionary production cycle. The movie runs under 2 hours. A lot was obviously cut with conflicting visions, tones, and themes. I'm not mad or disappointed by it anymore. Just bored.
931631999969910785 2017-11-17 21:15:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TheJimmyV If you had told 10 year old me that during the golden age of comic book movies that I'd be bored by a Justice League movie, I wouldn't have believed you. I'm also a curmudgeon.
931627074237943808 2017-11-17 20:56:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I never thought I would be so bored by a Justice League movie, but I was. Oh well.

930602895107555334 2017-11-14 01:06:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> After reading the news from today, I ask the question I have continually asked for the past couple years. When is enough enough?
930302650498932736 2017-11-13 05:13:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I had almost forgotten what a true leader and good man in politics looked/sounded like. Then I watched the @JoeBiden interview with @StephenAtHome. My faith has been restored.
930289198577475584 2017-11-13 04:20:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've taken more consistent breaks from the news, politics, and social media the past few days for mental health reasons. Last week's election results helped as well. I certainly feel better as a result.
929897844047302662 2017-11-12 02:24:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Saw Thor: Ragnarok again this weekend with the girlfriend. All action scenes should be cut to The Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin. What other Zeppelin tunes would make great action sequences?

928028018538434561 2017-11-07 22:34:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was fortunate to share an elevator with Roy Halladay and Steve Carlton once. Halladay said to me "You know, when I was in Toronto, I wore number 32, but I couldnt wear it here because some guy name Carlton had to have it retired or something." I'll never forget that. RIP Doc.

926978958200934400 2017-11-04 01:06:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Collected 450 moons in Mario Odyssey and that's only about halfway there. That's a lot of moons.
926921248851968000 2017-11-04 21:17:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thor: Ragnarok was very funny and entertaining. Very different kind of Marvel film. Jeff Goldblum was great playing himself. See it!
926872202905047040 2017-11-04 18:02:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So much yes. Got my tickets.pic.twitter.com/aFa4bJtwz7
926100054322176001 2017-11-02 14:53:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimStoeckle https://youtu.be/iXwP780LBw8
925936676043677696 2017-11-01 04:04:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This was an awesome World Series to watch for any baseball fan. Congrats to the Astros on a well deserved win.
925572352687124480 2017-10-31 03:56:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It does amaze me how often people feel the need to belittle filmmakers' careers in a manner that it somehow discredits us intellectually.
925568619534278656 2017-10-31 03:42:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing better than being called "snowflake," told to go "shoot a silent movie or something," and then blocked. I guess facts hurt feelings?
925567817218449408 2017-10-31 03:38:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @thelindsayellis @CallidusDominus I'm a big fan of all of her video essays/opinions, even when I don't agree. They are so well researched, presented and argued. Much respect.
925560059974873088 2017-10-31 03:08:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> If your response to being called out for stupid and ignorant things include the words "triggered" or "snowflake," you are the problem.
925547330706837504 2017-10-31 02:17:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Or better yet, let's celebrate Thanksgiving first and not worry about Christmas until that is over. There's plenty of time after that. Cool?
925539577976311808 2017-10-31 01:46:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I adore Christmas and go all in during the season. But it's still Halloween. Let's wait until we're closer to Thanksgiving to celebrate, OK?
925515554764582912 2017-10-31 00:11:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've always loved Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame. @thelindsayellis' video essay about it is brilliant, as always!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIIWy3TZ1eI
925443877259108353 2017-10-31 19:26:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Make sure everyone has their bottle of Authentic Bulgarian Miak tonight.https://youtu.be/iZNJE0TYmmE?t=1m6s
925409762115837957 2017-10-31 17:10:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Now I've got "Jump Up, Super Star!" from Super Mario Odyssey stuck in my head. So of course I downloaded it and been listening on repeat.
925376742998642688 2017-10-31 14:59:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Happy Halloween!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlcFTbgoeBk
925192021161234432 2017-10-30 02:45:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The ending is great. I dare not spoil it here, but it was ridiculously fun and the reward for beating the game is great.
925191846950768640 2017-10-30 02:45:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I beat Super Mario Odyssey tonight. I was initially very lukewarm to it. But as I kept playing, the more it grew on me.
925059645961629697 2017-10-30 17:59:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The White House yesterday, today, and every day it seems for the foreseeable future.pic.twitter.com/VFhVErqEjJ
925049886768353282 2017-10-30 17:20:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil No joke, the guy who wrote/drew this went to my high school. We were in National Art Honors Society together.
925013895852515329 2017-10-30 14:57:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Today. Wow. Just wow.
924774635014705152 2017-10-29 23:07:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I certainly was not expecting a follow by @HBO_Films today, but I'll take it! Hope you like my random musings about geeky stuff and movies!pic.twitter.com/CFLNuqME0W
924761542121410562 2017-10-29 22:15:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Mario, he's only playing basic scales. Not exactly hip tap your toes, snap your fingers jazz music. #SuperMarioOdysseypic.twitter.com/3h2Y977wfQ

924681817126514688 2017-10-29 16:58:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Time to take a break from Mario Odyssey. It's #FlyEaglesFly time!
924339773715767299 2017-10-28 18:19:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finished the binge of #StrangerThings and it was so satisfying. I love the show and the characters so much.
924101314258374656 2017-10-27 02:31:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A required prerequisite for being an elected official should be the ability to competently speak in complete sentences.https://twitter.com/williamlegate/status/923363818213851136
924098169268506625 2017-10-27 02:19:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> When someone leaves you a negative comment about your movie and you can't resist commenting back.pic.twitter.com/Ma82aYPtdN
924076769937895428 2017-10-27 00:54:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've spent more of today watching Stranger Things than playing Super Mario Odyssey. Why haven't I been loving Switch games the way I should?
923985379581222913 2017-10-27 18:50:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Alright Super Mario Odyssey. Entertain me.pic.twitter.com/Y6i8euIxQu
923984351876042755 2017-10-27 18:46:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How about no.pic.twitter.com/5KftEEqfvz
923922316316246017 2017-10-27 14:40:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @facebook @PixelDan All social media algorithms seem to be set against us now. That's why I'm kind of fed up/done with the whole thing.
923737740730163201 2017-10-26 02:26:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I think you and I were assigned homework.
923707968025014273 2017-10-26 00:28:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees Mario will probably just toss the dinosaur aside the way he tosses all dinosaurs aside.pic.twitter.com/sMwBYB4CBp
923700476045955072 2017-10-26 23:58:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Confession that will be wildly unpopular. I am not at all excited about Super Mario Odyssey. Nothing about it has garnered my interest.
923360717486600192 2017-10-25 01:28:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally saw The Big Sick. I'm behind, I know. What an excellent wonderful film! Huge congrats to @kumailn @emilyvgordon @mshowalter & crew!
923341658506358784 2017-10-25 00:13:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Vin Scully during the first pitch ceremonies at the World Series is awesome.
923312120661512192 2017-10-25 22:15:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Really pretty sky right now.pic.twitter.com/KwO8tEXxCG
923221485598146560 2017-10-25 16:15:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BewareTheSlimes $2400 more per year. On top of the over $3000 already paying.
923184393501454337 2017-10-25 13:48:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 You and me both. But apparently that is too socialist and that's scary (ie: the corporate overlords won't make as much money).
922907438948519936 2017-10-24 19:27:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So what you're saying is that he is a vindictive, petulant liar who is entirely unfit to serve the office.https://twitter.com/NBCPolitics/status/922905068424388609
922829232417529856 2017-10-24 14:16:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing conveys confidence in a leader like a penchant for vindictiveness fueled by petulant, narcissistic, ego maniacal insecurity. Sigh...
922825991352999936 2017-10-24 14:03:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I had a good private insurance plan through the ACA for a fair price. It's an over 77% increase thanks to our idiot President & his party.
922824376650579968 2017-10-24 13:57:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Welcome to the US healthcare system where it it is a privilege and not a right while one party actively sabotages it out of political spite.
922668454406164480 2017-10-23 03:37:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Fairly certain I just saw myself (or my arm/camera) during Monday Night Football when they showed some footage (not mine) of this event.
922620479088873473 2017-10-23 00:27:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Game time. #FlyEaglesFly
922610587074428928 2017-10-23 23:47:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I produced this video. Check it out!https://twitter.com/PDQFreshFood/status/922608772253716480
922566610262507521 2017-10-23 20:53:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Check that. The whole album is great. I've listened to about half of the songs and each one is great.
922557140891553792 2017-10-23 20:15:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I only just recently heard Kesha's song "Praying." It is insanely beautiful. I love this song so much.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8XnTciTjdM
922514918603198470 2017-10-23 17:27:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My health insurance premium is going up by over $2,000 next year with a higher deductible. Thanks for that @realDonaldTrump and @GOP.
921954487564165120 2017-10-21 04:20:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I somehow have been able to avoid that song Swish Swish for several months. I've now finally heard that unholy assault on the ears.
921937638436884480 2017-10-21 03:13:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I got to work with former NFL coach and Monday Night Football Announcer Jon Gruden today.pic.twitter.com/CF6zz8smYK
921917638837788673 2017-10-21 01:54:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This scene in Spider-man Homecoming is one of the best hero/villain dialogue scenes in all superhero movies.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB5HTcFhCso
921756462891917316 2017-10-21 15:14:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Who doesn't like a widespread power outage on a Saturday morning?
921457628286541824 2017-10-20 19:26:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ChrisXCross64 Without a doubt.
921444207667175425 2017-10-20 18:33:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MikeBGameGenie It's over $450 to get the whole set. And they're huge. Near 2 feet tall. Wouldn't mind seeing a 6" set of these, but doubt we will.
921437381831680001 2017-10-20 18:06:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> These are awesome. Just not  $109 awesome. I wish these kind of figures were made in smaller scale. Def my favorite TMNT character designs.pic.twitter.com/ldcRjQZQXs
921424770192805888 2017-10-20 17:15:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Some days, you just need some Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2BvmL2MMJ8
920851288933502976 2017-10-18 03:17:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The lenses were just wide angle lenses that had no way to focus. So even outdoor photos with tons of sunlight are blurry.
920848145134833665 2017-10-18 03:04:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Disposable 35mm film cameras were must have mainstays throughout high school. Now scanning old photos, I realize how blurry the photos are.
919780740660940800 2017-10-15 04:23:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Beat Super Metroid for the first time. 4:25 at 81%.pic.twitter.com/PuMWnBf5UO
919657173239681024 2017-10-15 20:12:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got to meet the awesome @yakkopinky at @Retrocons. We talked Spielberg, @GoofyBill, voices, and I plugged @LivingIn8Bits. Thank you, sir!pic.twitter.com/hXvKMRe1P5
919590938929922048 2017-10-15 15:48:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Only at @Retrocons can you see the Green Goblin give Spider-man a box of Uncle Ben's and Spidey fall to his knees wheeping.pic.twitter.com/SWOiJpCSxe
919380477768847361 2017-10-14 01:52:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been stuck here for 20 minutes. Got to the top twice and was ambushed by flying things and knocked down. The control mechanic sucks.pic.twitter.com/dGpp9EbRFz
919379665369882625 2017-10-14 01:49:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Playing Super Metroid for the first time. I like it, but one mechanic is broken and I'm stuck. The Wall Jump. It's such a backwards control.
918945844962955265 2017-10-13 21:05:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @retrowaretv @RetroWorldExpo Hoping to at least make it out to @Retrocons on Sunday.
918944911835189249 2017-10-13 21:01:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sad I will not be at @RetroWorldExpo this year. I'll miss seeing all the @retrowaretv folk & shamelessly plugging @LivingIn8Bits. Have fun!
918848962207109120 2017-10-13 14:40:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I and many of my colleagues receive our health care through the ACA. It is going to cost us thousands more all because of his spiteful ego.
918848669755101185 2017-10-13 14:39:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The President is intentionally sabotaging the ACA to use as leverage for his own vindictive political spite. Absolutely disgraceful.
918833937442537472 2017-10-13 13:40:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You did this out of vindictive spite to appease your petulant fragile ego. You are an ignorant leader & a terrible President. Shame on you.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918797009133465600
918684895177736192 2017-10-12 03:48:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great hard fought win. #FlyEaglesFly

917950336194764800 2017-10-10 03:09:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just watched the wonderful Spielberg documentary that HBO produced. Very inspiring. Makes me miss making feature films. Been a long time.
917599917908119553 2017-10-09 03:57:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Colbert was merciless during his monologue as well. I & many friends work in the industry, so seeing inaccurate nonsense really bothers me.
917595376198307840 2017-10-09 03:39:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @rianjohnson Got my tickets! Is it December yet? I don't know if I can wait that long!
917584594878296064 2017-10-09 02:56:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy I suspect we'll see another cut of Blade Runner insinuating it was all a dream or something before we see a Ronto in a Star Wars movie again
917584338547593216 2017-10-09 02:55:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy As much as I jest, it's obvious he isn't calling any shots any more. Just my joke of the day. I'm legitimately quite stoked about this movie
917582480617689088 2017-10-09 02:48:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The only thing missing from The Last Jedi trailer was several shots of a Ronto walking through the frame. Every Star Wars movie needs it!pic.twitter.com/XBuHx59hDR
917578341686882305 2017-10-09 02:31:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 It's a Furby -- I think. At least it's not a giant Ronto walking through the frame. (I'm milking this Ronto joke to everybody today).pic.twitter.com/0jjZt6SXjJ
917576675671576576 2017-10-09 02:25:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Both Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers post clips on YouTube prior to airing. Both have segments about it tonight.
917573158122786823 2017-10-09 02:11:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It was. I am very excited. But needed more Ronto shots blocking the frame.pic.twitter.com/GUxXoamSCL

917555772023861248 2017-10-09 01:01:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino @ContraryHook31 I don't mind the football aspect although I have no vested interest in either team. I just want me some Star Wars.
917554881065562112 2017-10-09 00:58:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Looks pretty. The trailer has got to be on YouTube already, set to private, right? I doubt anyone would mind if it were released early, hmm?https://twitter.com/starwars/status/917543277942804482
917456114383499264 2017-10-09 18:25:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @rianjohnson Is there a Ronto Walks Thru The Frame Filter to cover up any potential spoilers? Asking for a friend.  I'm looking forward to the movie!pic.twitter.com/osqRCh4p8P
917454475241099271 2017-10-09 18:19:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> We could use the Ronto Walk Thru the Frame Filter to cover up any spoilers. All Star Wars movies need more Rontos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgbPxpXcNXc https://twitter.com/KOConnorJr/status/917433439304822784
917452565532631040 2017-10-09 18:11:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Colbert has already tweeted a joke about it. Probably shouldn't get news from a website that anti-virus software doesn't trust.pic.twitter.com/zAdDvlY9aK
917448593618997248 2017-10-09 17:56:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The news broke Thursday night. Most late night shows tape their Friday show on Thursday. New episodes don't tape until today.
917435476243615745 2017-10-09 17:03:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Considering we know practically nothing about the movie, any new information would be a spoiler. Plus he said "But its gooooood....."
917422420788641793 2017-10-09 16:12:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Star Wars trailer tonight. Going to be a long 10 hours waiting, especially on a day off. Guess I'll start Super Metroid on the SNES Classic.
917422056828006400 2017-10-09 16:10:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Beat Metroid: Samus Returns. Great Metroid game. Went for 100%. Doubt I'll be able to shave off 10 hours for the better endings though.pic.twitter.com/YxrVd9EDxn
917183979765272576 2017-10-08 00:24:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Another day where our so called leader embarrasses the nation through his petty petulance and fragile narcissistic ego. Sigh. Disgraceful.
917117807845879809 2017-10-08 20:01:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great win! #FlyEaglesFly
917082801312272384 2017-10-08 17:42:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Loving this. Keep it up! #FlyEaglesFly
917078154342256641 2017-10-08 17:24:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great start! #FlyEaglesFly
917041280307421184 2017-10-08 14:57:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Note to self. Apparently playing Metroid games stimulates the brain. So don't play until 2am and try to go to sleep. It won't happen....
916721171730698240 2017-10-07 17:45:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I finally started playing Metroid: Samus Returns. It is awesome. Loving it so far.
916412712112001024 2017-10-06 21:19:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @CinescapeCast I watch it every couple years and just can't get into it. I even own the blu-ray. I was curious about 2049. My review: It was -- long.
916412352119148545 2017-10-06 21:18:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Rewatched the Final Cut the other night and just saw 2049. I just can't get into it. I realize I'm committing film lover sins by saying so.
916411958697570304 2017-10-06 21:16:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Confession that will probably be extremely unpopular. I'm just not into Blade Runner. By all accounts and interests I should love it.
915923476443205632 2017-10-05 12:55:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I had a nightmare where I worked for the Trump social media team. He told me I was doing a fantastic job. It was horrifying.
915262290877911041 2017-10-03 17:08:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I refuse to respond to stupid ignorant people today. My brain hurts enough from yesterday's misadventures.
915090536477986816 2017-10-02 05:46:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm learning to fly, around the clouds But what goes up must come down  #RIPTomPettyhttps://youtu.be/s5BJXwNeKsQ
915068556399783936 2017-10-02 04:18:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm hopeful for a better day tomorrow. I'm hopeful for less ignorance and more logic and love. I pray for a better world and peace.
915055907133894656 2017-10-02 03:28:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My question for a lot of people today.https://youtu.be/rhtLoA3X21s?t=54s
915055581005795329 2017-10-02 03:27:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, this is a new one for me. I was called a punk and physically threatened today. Seriously.
915047788819484672 2017-10-02 02:56:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Disgraceful.
915044032631459840 2017-10-02 02:41:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have learned today that you simply cannot argue with ignorant stupidity. No amount of logic can will penetrate.
914865566409687041 2017-10-02 14:52:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> To all lawmakers who offer their "thoughts and prayers" while continuing to cash checks from the NRA, go to hell. You are all a disgrace.
914860307914293249 2017-10-02 14:31:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking.
913210415949238274 2017-09-27 01:15:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Update to the Metroid amiibo saga. Got 1 thru Nintendo's website, though still unhappy about Best Buy screwing up original preorder.pic.twitter.com/GCHZ2ao0fb
912806424199286784 2017-09-26 22:29:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @RewindMike Whoah, that's some Inception level stuff there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKGJZt83_JE
912527117325398016 2017-09-25 03:59:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm going to take a break from this ever burning dumpster fire and try to stick to video games, movies, and other nerdy/geeky stuff.
912516680030486528 2017-09-25 03:18:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hats off to @TheDailyShow tonight on an excellent episode. Truly one of the best since Trevor Noah took over.
912511054965563392 2017-09-25 02:56:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You are an absolute embarrassment and a disgrace. Also, learn how to thread a tweet. It's seriously not that hard.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912481556127780865
912486304096641024 2017-09-25 01:17:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Notice how I was able to make a tweet thread to tie it together. #MeSoSmart
912486209594814464 2017-09-25 01:17:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Then again, I cannot understand how someone so awful, petulant, narcissistic, ignorant, and downright stupid could be President.
912485754365935617 2017-09-25 01:15:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I cannot understand how our President uses Twitter constantly, yet still cannot figure out how to make a tweet thread. What the hell?
912481392432484352 2017-09-25 00:58:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So how's that "give him a chance" mantra working out?
912059557626679298 2017-09-24 21:01:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I found this speech from The American President particularly relevant today.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC2jhQ0KAAU
912054533509050369 2017-09-24 20:42:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 61 Yards! #FlyEaglesFly

911965102307446784 2017-09-24 14:46:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every day, I wonder if I'll wake up without being embarrassed and ashamed by our petulant President.  Nope.
911639708555517957 2017-09-23 17:13:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sick for the third time in a month. What the hell, body?
911426490818027520 2017-09-22 03:06:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Though I can still recite the "Because it's my name" Proctor speech from The Crucible. That one will forever be ingrained in my memory.
911426247619686400 2017-09-22 03:05:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm a theater junkie and used to be in so many plays. I do wonder though how I remembered all that dialogue including Shakespeare.
911362678337294338 2017-09-22 22:52:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And so it begins. Fuller House Season 3. Yup, it's happening.
911347155947999237 2017-09-22 21:51:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport @BestBuy @dblguardian Thanks. Nintendo actually had it on their site store so ordered it that way. Had to pay shipping but at least I'll get one now.
911257850130944000 2017-09-22 15:56:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6l8MFdTaPE
911085152209485824 2017-09-21 04:30:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Update to the Metroid Amiibo saga. Unbeknownst to me, Nintendo launched an online store & I ordered from there. So I will have 1 eventually.
911052583380426752 2017-09-21 02:20:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PuzzleMaster7 I did see that maybe an hour ago. Didn't know Nintendo opened its own online store. Ordered!
910988534999343110 2017-09-21 22:06:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, the shrug off  "nothing I can do" continues. Like I said, anybody able to help a dude out getting a Metroid 2Pack amiibo, let me know.
910986045466038279 2017-09-21 21:56:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport So it essentially remains a shrug of "nothing I can do" while I remain Amiibo-less and would have to pay scalper prices if I want one. Cool.
910984103088066561 2017-09-21 21:48:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport Manager said would talk to employees about it. The issue is that there is no stock to replace or fulfill. I'm not interested in credit.
910983734425473025 2017-09-21 21:47:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport I filled out the information, saw a price with 10% off for inconvenience, filled out my #, confirmed my info, and left. Today, no record.
910983492388958210 2017-09-21 21:46:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport Initially, yes, on Sat when I picked up the game. Was told it would arrive today. I showed up & the only record is the original preorder.
910982624356823040 2017-09-21 21:42:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport I was not and am not interested in the $30 credit or some other amiibos. I was only interested in the Metroid 2 pack, hence the preorder.
910982396337586177 2017-09-21 21:41:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport Yes. Was essentially given the shrug of "nothing I can do" b/c there is no stock to give. Gave my information for follow up but that's it...
910981837312446464 2017-09-21 21:39:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuySupport @BestBuy And thus ends my rant regarding "Mike's Metroid amiibo deprived because of Best Buy screwing up the pre-order and then lying to me" week.
910981481379573760 2017-09-21 21:38:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very annoyed with @BestBuy and @BestBuySupport over this. Had I known, I would've preordered somewhere else. Or went out day of to buy 1.
910981302106681344 2017-09-21 21:37:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy So if anybody out there has a Metroid 2 pack amiibo they're looking to get rid of, I sure would be happy to have it.
910981038343622658 2017-09-21 21:36:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy So now I'm without the Metroid amiibos because somebody didn't read the sticker correctly and I end up screwed and empty handed.
910980779026599937 2017-09-21 21:35:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy I never went searching for one because I was under the impression I had it guaranteed. Now they're near impossible to find in any stores.
910980672537399296 2017-09-21 21:34:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy So they offered me $30 credit on anything else. The thing is I don't want anything else. I wanted the Metroid amiibos. Hence the preorder.
910980522322612232 2017-09-21 21:34:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy Flash forward to today and I show up finding that the order was never placed, there's no trail of it, and now I'm amiibo-less.
910980386469036032 2017-09-21 21:33:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy So I put in my info and all of that and opted for email receipt. Was told I'd get updates and even 10% off for inconvenience.
910980163546083330 2017-09-21 21:32:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy So my amiibo was put on the store shelf and sold. I was told that they could cancel my preorder and have another 1 there today.
910980020146982915 2017-09-21 21:32:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @BestBuy They put the preorder sticker on another copy of Samus Returns as opposed to the amiibo. I didn't raise a big fuss, just as long as I got 1.
910979843902320640 2017-09-21 21:31:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm honestly really annoyed. I pre-ordered the Metroid 2 Pack Amiibo from @BestBuy back in June. Guess who doesn't have one? What happened..
909978126930907136 2017-09-18 03:11:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @RewindMike Thank you. I guess I don't act like somebody in my 30s. I just wish I was as skinny and in shape as I was in my 20s. Getting old isn't fun.
909977027675029506 2017-09-18 03:06:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I guess I should take it as a compliment that many of my coworkers have been under the impression that I'm in my 20s. Forever young?
909475896813391872 2017-09-17 17:55:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't like the CGI Energizer Bunny. Its weird. I miss the old school rolling robot bunny.

909082444204249089 2017-09-16 15:51:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I sometimes feel like I'm the only person who liked Metroid: Other M.
909082312272433152 2017-09-16 15:51:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But funny because there's a lot of talk about Other M and how "bad it was" since it was the last Metroid game released.
909082141690073088 2017-09-16 15:50:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Picked up Metroid: Samus Returns. Probably won't get to play it for a few weeks, though.
908539720594018304 2017-09-14 03:55:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What I used to think looked awesome looks like garbage now, especially in an HD world. Seeing this old footage is so blah....
908539497587073025 2017-09-14 03:54:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> If there's one thing I definitely do not miss about editing analog with tape is the generation loss with editing/copying/transferring.
908490346828574725 2017-09-14 00:39:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @njhorrorcon Also neato that we're nominated for Best Editing and Best Actress! Go team @sarahbbraun @cinevore @stephanieyuhas !
908490229161627649 2017-09-14 00:38:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is cool! I've been nominated for Best Cinematography for Vessel at @njhorrorcon's Film Festival! Neato! http://www.newjerseyhorrorcon.com/film-festivalpic.twitter.com/dEBA8eGzmW
907825408216793090 2017-09-12 04:36:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ah ha! Found it finally after 2 days of looking! Now I can go to bed.
907811705727660038 2017-09-12 03:42:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's old footage on a random VHS tape that I know I have but cannot find anywhere. And it is driving me crazy.
907460251389227009 2017-09-11 04:25:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing like hearing some poor animal screaming bloody horror while probably being brutally murdered by some other animal in the night.
907447089654910976 2017-09-11 03:33:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MrJerseyJosh I'm actually starting to convert all of my old Rewind tapes since I'll be combing through them all anyway. I have so many VHS tapes.
907357167405162499 2017-09-11 21:36:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian @pxlsicle That's how we Jersey folk like to roll (pun intended).
907349911720615938 2017-09-11 21:07:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was way off!pic.twitter.com/8m7n0Ts1EL
907091122538909696 2017-09-10 03:59:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MrJerseyJosh Funny enough, it was your video that was sent to me as an example! I'm going through Rewind tapes, Video Yearbooks, Senior Memories, etc.
907087721331609600 2017-09-10 03:45:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Case in point, found this footage of @michaelponter that hasn't been seen in 15 years.pic.twitter.com/PsF82ZGOKk
907086586893959168 2017-09-10 03:41:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What's really funny is how many people begrudgingly say "Hi Mike" or angrily scream "NO!" An odd time capsule for a day in my senior year.
907084220677357568 2017-09-10 03:31:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It is so weird seeing such an older life. It's such a weird surreal feeling looking at such old footage. Feels like a different life.
907084044743081984 2017-09-10 03:31:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Upcoming High School Reunion and me being the video/VHS/Mini-DV pack rat, I volunteered to put videos together for it.

905632782680031232 2017-09-06 03:24:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm amazed how someone as dumb as Rush Limbaugh could be so wealthy by continually saying such stupid things.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/06/rush-limbaughs-dangerous-suggestion-that-hurricane-irma-is-fake-news/?utm_term=.b84650b5ebfc

904036493353787392 2017-09-02 17:41:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been eagerly anticipating getting back on set and behind the camera on a personal film project. Waiting for tomorrow is the hardest part.
903824749209550848 2017-09-01 03:39:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going through my high school yearbook. It is amusing to me how many signatures include AIM screen names. That's all we had back in '02.

903483843126018053 2017-08-31 05:05:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finding 35mm film nowadays is near impossible. Luckily I was able to find a couple rolls in an old 35mm SLR camera I had.

903331491643613185 2017-08-31 18:59:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Something I actually just heard in the Boscov's furniture department. "This is how real women sit! Honey Boo Boo Child!"
903083754612289537 2017-08-30 02:35:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> An actual fact check page had to be created for this nonsense. How could there be this much stupidity in the world?http://www.snopes.com/barack-obama-katrina/
902210585198297088 2017-08-28 16:45:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My body and immune system just hates me this year. Been sick (again) since Saturday and not feeling better yet.
901994168611983360 2017-08-27 02:25:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't want to wait another year to see what happens next. Oh man, oh man. #GameOfThrones #GameOfThronesFinale
901472613838585856 2017-08-26 15:53:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This pathetic excuse for a President and man is an absolute disgrace.https://twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes/status/901263384087334914
900919156794675200 2017-08-24 03:13:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I miss when films could be simply enjoyed and not need some kind of political or societal commentary pitting sides as a requisite to review.
900168898229751808 2017-08-22 01:32:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have a conundrum. I very much want to read @KatyTurNBC's book but I really don't want to relive that petulant man's awful campaign.
900121543065444358 2017-08-22 22:24:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But still, why must it be so difficult to get? The demand is very well known. Just flood the market. Sadly, it's never been Nintendo's way.
900121284549464064 2017-08-22 22:23:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I managed to get an in store preorder of an SNES Classic today, which made some cavity filling at the dentist a little more pleasant.
899843732022972416 2017-08-21 04:00:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish I had the time and funding to produce videos and films more often. So many people I'd love to work with. Life gets in the way.
899840484885057537 2017-08-21 03:47:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been all kinds of hooked on @JonathanYMusic and @missmalindakat's music channels. They're both great!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBK-4YSLDew
899488113554214913 2017-08-20 04:27:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The funny thing is how they were all shot on film, but edited/sourced through tape, so they're all only 480p resolution.
899482723575898113 2017-08-20 04:06:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Binge watching music videos from the 90s is bringing back all of the nostalgia feels. I'm all kinds of missing high school now.
899455241413898240 2017-08-20 02:16:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Oh man, this isn't going to be good. I mean, it'll be good entertainment, just not good for the characters.... #GameOfThrones
899304078337036293 2017-08-20 16:16:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I successfully avoided the Sunday morning news shows for a second week in a row. Today can't get any worse, can it?
898954091883372544 2017-08-19 17:05:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino I've seen DD Season 1 & 2, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage. So if that's enough, then I'm game. Didn't want to waste time if it's not worth it.
898951941832687617 2017-08-19 16:56:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I haven't watched Iron Fist. Heard nothing but bad things about it. Hopefully not required to enjoy The Defenders.
898763728648192002 2017-08-18 04:29:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sonic Mania is good and all and feels like an amped up classic Genesis Sonic game, but Titanic Monarch Zone is brutally cheap.
898355397161086977 2017-08-17 01:26:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm fairly certain Tina Fey's cake eating coping method for the country's current climate is what everybody needs. I need to buy a cake now.
898346489784680448 2017-08-17 00:51:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa It's way bigger than I thought. I expected a 6 inch or something like that. When I saw the big box inside another big box, I was confused.
898332016923385856 2017-08-17 23:53:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ADDatWork Hey, don't go try taking my stuff.
898320675768872961 2017-08-17 23:08:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil I guess I didn't read it close enough. I wish they had a Switch cartridge inside the repro cart or something!
898320514048983040 2017-08-17 23:07:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil Nope, no physical copy. It's the huge statue, a fake Genesis cart with a gold ring in it, a weird metal card, and a slip with download code.
898320028210262017 2017-08-17 23:05:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @quinn4318 Switch. Only of those consoles I own.
898319328218624001 2017-08-17 23:03:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @quinn4318 I didn't even know this was a download code only. I thought it would be on a cartridge. It's just a slip of paper with this giant statue.
898318464988925955 2017-08-17 22:59:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I can't be the only one disappointed though that the game was a slip of paper with a download code instead of an actual cartridge. Am I?
898317787394785280 2017-08-17 22:57:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> When I preordered Sonic Mania, I wasn't expecting the collectible to be so gigantic. This thing is massive. I don't know where to put it.pic.twitter.com/i49Ds7dhC5
897654330299469826 2017-08-15 03:00:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have seen some people defend the indefensible. I have disassociated myself from said people.
897279450634735616 2017-08-14 02:11:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just watched Colossal. It's a very unique and interesting movie. Definitely check it out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqcZtz8VXXE
896939872233115648 2017-08-13 03:41:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> At least Weird Al @alyankovic appearing on @LastWeekTonight with John Oliver at the end of another brilliant episode was great.
896883149342420993 2017-08-13 23:56:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm going to play some video games and watch Game of Thrones. I need to escape for a while to maintain my sanity.
896876904631984128 2017-08-13 23:31:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But I am just so angry, heartbroken, and saddened over everything that has happened since this repugnant, vile President has taken office.
896876650759151617 2017-08-13 23:30:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I would much rather spend every day talking about sports, video games, movies, TV shows, music, and other nerdy geek culture all the time.
896591362640015360 2017-08-12 04:36:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> We have devolved so much as a country simply because one side was so desperate for power that they blindly gave the keys to a crazy man.
896590944773984257 2017-08-12 04:35:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How is this happening? How do you even fend off crazy? How did someone so monstrously crazy get into power and inspire so many crazy people?
896590644331917312 2017-08-12 04:34:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am trying to find the words tonight in regards to what has been going on and I can't. I am in utter shock and disbelief.
895834029110558720 2017-08-10 02:27:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just watched this very important documentary on Netflix. A free and independent press is more important than ever.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHow1B32WZw
895483976760143872 2017-08-09 03:16:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @UrzasRage Haha, thanks. We've definitely received our fair share though not just for LI8B, but films in general. I could write a book on the comments.
895483141615472641 2017-08-09 03:13:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @SpaceKappa Dawwww, thanks! You're a pretty swell guy yourself! But yeah, anyone who has done YouTube has been there, done that with comments.
895481138193543168 2017-08-09 03:05:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't need a Sarahah. I've had enough anonymous comments made about me through being a filmmaker, on YouTube, and @LivingIn8Bits as it is.
895421607530815489 2017-08-09 23:08:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa It was quite delicious (pepperoni), but rarely do I eat a whole pizza by myself.
895420992838713345 2017-08-09 23:06:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I just ate an entire Tombstone Pizza by myself because it's been that kind of week/month/year.
894389443133661185 2017-08-06 02:47:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Darren Daulton was my favorite baseball player growing up. Very fortunate to have gotten to meet him, albeit briefly. Very sad.https://twitter.com/Phillies/status/894387535350292480
893844829993672704 2017-08-05 14:43:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sesame Street seems to have been covering more mature topics since its move to HBO.pic.twitter.com/yOpL8B53Sd
892558171633586176 2017-08-01 01:30:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Moray Towers is the worst map in Splatoon. Yet I feel it is the one I end up in the most frequently.
892172766069350400 2017-07-31 23:58:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every time I see the word "great" used in a statement regarding current events and politics.pic.twitter.com/2fpxR9Q1vH
892161039156031488 2017-07-31 23:12:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> William Henry Harrison had a more successful Presidency 6 months in and he would've been dead for 5 of them.
892160944469671936 2017-07-31 23:11:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Remember, all of these people being fired or "resigning" were supposedly the A-Team, the very "best people."
890809678489280513 2017-07-27 05:42:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thank you Senator Collins, Murkowski, and McCain for doing the right thing. I and millions others are grateful. And McConnell, you're awful.
890803909614157824 2017-07-27 05:19:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I shouldn't be having anxiety problems and losing sleep over watching the United States Senate proceedings.
890803625190084608 2017-07-27 05:18:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm exhausted, yet I'm still up watching what's going on in the Senate because of the direct effect it will have on myself and those I know.
890754113235038208 2017-07-27 02:01:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Excellent documentary about the infamous game Night Trap by @MyLifeInGaming. Great work guys!https://youtu.be/df2zptiviBo
890420042646597632 2017-07-26 03:54:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Late night TV has been amazing this past year but I would gladly trade the brilliance it's been for a return to a normal and sane President.
890302010083430400 2017-07-26 20:05:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The President is a despicable disgrace of a human being. Absolutely Shameful. What a petulant, ego maniacal, and downright idiotic man.
890029509084426242 2017-07-25 02:02:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love the show Adam Ruins Everything. One of the best infotainment shows out there. And go figure, tonight's episode is about Healthcare.
889898554432659456 2017-07-25 17:22:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I had a blast producing this sketch! Check it out. Merry Christmas in July!https://twitter.com/Phillies/status/889893147991580674
889697115320057858 2017-07-24 04:01:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Maybe it's because I hate petulant ego maniacal arrogance. One of the many reasons I hate our "leader." Humility goes a long way for me.
889696273158332417 2017-07-24 03:58:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I get way too much satisfaction out of beating obnoxious, arrogant, self proclaimed greatest competitive Smash players who dance around.
889636824435613698 2017-07-24 00:02:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I may have played a key role in this scene occurring.https://twitter.com/TMacPhils/status/889594503878848513
888976510023086081 2017-07-22 04:18:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'll definitely check the movie out and see what it's all about. Again I have no context to the book itself, so I know very little about it.
888976275133665280 2017-07-22 04:17:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I haven't read Ready Player One. I love Spielberg and 80s stuff of course, but the trailer didn't do much for me. I have no context either.
888958185343725568 2017-07-22 03:05:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MichaelRayBower I'm very sorry to hear about the passing of your father. My condolences to you and your family. My thoughts and prayers are with you.
888143787788304385 2017-07-20 21:09:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Everytime I sit in rush hour traffic, I lament how we were promised flying cars by now to no avail.
887845148725477376 2017-07-19 01:22:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also, I had no idea that was Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones and frankly I didn't care. Didn't take me out of it.
887844909474086913 2017-07-19 01:21:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In other news, I had never heard of this Despacito song until today. Apparently the most streamed song ever. News to me.
887843600616370178 2017-07-19 01:16:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The universe has it out for me lately. I don't know what I ever did to offend it, but please stop. Could use some more good fortune....
887150886031642628 2017-07-17 03:23:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dwarfbeard I've been eagerly awaiting a reply to my response, but my guess is I won't receive one. Usually shouldn't engage, but I was in a bad mood.
887031245024219136 2017-07-17 19:28:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dwarfbeard Unwritten rule of indie filmmakers is to not trash each other's work publicly. For a self proclaimed film savant, you'd think he'd know.
887031026937200646 2017-07-17 19:27:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dwarfbeard Pretty much. I'm just amazed at the amount of effort used through multiple platforms. I felt compelled enough to respond on YouTube.
886798638617436160 2017-07-16 04:04:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I guess it's easier to dismiss the "can I scrape this from my memory" and "this sucked" one sentence reviews. The long ones sting more....
886798283053682689 2017-07-16 04:02:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Which I realize the irony in myself expelling energy talking about it here. They say not to read the reviews, but I always do.
886795198231195648 2017-07-16 03:50:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Not only writing a scathing essay review on YouTube, but an even longer one on IMDB. The amount of effort expelled is extraordinary.
886788057986465792 2017-07-16 03:22:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Always fun to read a review of your work that argues that you're an incompetent filmmaker. Great morale booster. Comes with the territory.
886767829449674752 2017-07-16 02:01:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Shall we begin?
886753058843217920 2017-07-16 01:02:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Game of Thrones time.
886719295966859265 2017-07-16 22:48:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I like how everything I post on the @LivingIn8Bits Instagram & Facebook pages are "performing better than *arbitrary %* of previous posts."
886641695332474881 2017-07-16 17:40:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And then I see something and I say "damnit, I need that" and end up taking something home. Darn you, @PixelDan!pic.twitter.com/UsF63ZvJoH
886641039313956865 2017-07-16 17:37:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Even though I am what most will consider an adult, I find the need to stop at a toy store whenever I pass one. I blame @PixelDan.
886229581467971586 2017-07-15 14:22:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Because we all need a tweet like this to make our lives a little better today.https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/886214010898612224
885606305678970880 2017-07-13 21:06:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The sky is blue, water is a liquid, and 2+2=4. A lot of people don't know that.
885506258027020288 2017-07-13 14:28:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was given a fidget spinner as swag at a conference and now I understand why they are so addictive.
884160713652097024 2017-07-09 21:21:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's something odd and about attending a conference in the same ballroom as your high school prom.
884126005748785153 2017-07-09 19:04:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, the Universe let me down today -- yet again.
884072913229557761 2017-07-09 15:33:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear Universe, I could really use a win today. Thanks.
883165421360304129 2017-07-06 03:26:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @RewindMike Voice Acting. 'Nuff said.

882104390647255045 2017-07-03 05:10:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finished the Trial of the Sword which was very hard. Nice to finally have a Master Sword that doesn't lose "power" so definitely worth it.pic.twitter.com/l9fnTH5Kxc

881633978813435904 2017-07-02 22:01:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @pxlsicle Great, enjoy! This sketch is on the DVD with an easter egg of video outtakes of me shooting @michaelponter with nerf darts for goof ups.
881631930109898752 2017-07-02 21:53:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @michaelponter @pxlsicle I gave Pat a Super Plumber Bros DVD at TooManyGames to give to you. Hope you got it!
881341043635097602 2017-07-01 02:37:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @realDonaldTrump Can we please go one week without your petulant insecurity embarrassing our nation? It is beyond disgraceful.
881292155326803969 2017-07-01 23:23:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ok, need to tweet about something positive. So I'll talk about our Best of @LivingIn8Bits screening next weekend at the Delco Film Festival.https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/881157611122511872
881288256662503424 2017-07-01 23:07:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is not a man of sound mind. This is an embarrassment. When is enough enough? When will this petulant behavior be held accountable?https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881281755017355264
881247237774483456 2017-07-01 20:24:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear Kohl's -- Why? Are you trying to stock wardrobe for 80s cover bands?pic.twitter.com/ZGky1Ckqo4
881011182525480962 2017-06-30 04:46:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Long day. My computer bricked this morning. I pulled the hard drive and have been backing everything up. Need a new one. What a day....
880832007353372677 2017-06-30 16:54:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Computer bricked this morning. Not how I wanted to spend my day off.

880227401925615616 2017-06-28 00:52:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have 2 personality modes with little in between: reclusive introvert and obnoxious extrovert. I sometimes wonder how people tolerate me.
880202128580587520 2017-06-28 23:11:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> New @LivingIn8Bits sketch we created for the Super Plumber Bros DVD! Check it out!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZjb84rtFQw
879826971408171008 2017-06-27 22:21:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 I was counting that in the collection of silly videos that exist of me "singing." But I wouldn't consider that skilled singing.
879537104572776448 2017-06-26 03:09:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Probably my favorite @LivingIn8Bits @TooManyGames memory. At our 2014 panel, we performed Mario Kart Love Song live.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOIZQsqt4sg
879534836993716226 2017-06-26 03:00:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Granted, there are tons of video projects that exist of me singing or rapping in various odd voices, but I wish I could actually sing well.
879526787943936000 2017-06-26 02:28:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been blessed with many talents and skills and am very thankful for them, but I wish I could sing. I'm tone deaf to my own singing voice
879514624256856064 2017-06-26 01:40:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Why server maintenance during prime time hours? No Smash Bros for me tonight.pic.twitter.com/QkIDfyPl2M
879512124724301824 2017-06-26 01:30:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Of course not. Instead they'll probably send 5 units to a store on launch and call it a day. Then claim ignorance about demand anticipation.
879509948388057090 2017-06-26 01:21:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I can't wait until we can all have a fight to the death outside a Best Buy for the privilege to merely look at a purchase voucher from afar.
879381773783838720 2017-06-26 16:52:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So there will be an SNES Classic. Hopefully they will make more than 5 this time.
879336280479412224 2017-06-26 13:51:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg @PeteSkerritt The Schuylkill Expressway has been ticking off Philly area drivers for the better part of 60+ years. Retroworld remains to be seen. Hoping!
879322921768038400 2017-06-26 12:58:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Dawwww, oh you! It was a good time. Wish I could have stayed longer. Til next time!

879000514226266112 2017-06-25 15:37:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I didn't pick up too much at @TooManyGames this year. First con I didn't buy a game actually. Got an Everdrive and a couple misc fun things.pic.twitter.com/CTXkcnL22W
878814325015801857 2017-06-24 03:17:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @sfurze76 Thank you for attending! I hope I wasn't too scatterbrained trying to explain stuff. Wish we had more time. Look for those Easter Eggs!
878808914594328576 2017-06-24 02:55:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @tinyneenja @Squarepainter @GamingHistorian @KeithApicary @NathanBarnatt @PixelDan @LivingIn8Bits Few more pics from today at @TooManyGames. Good times had by all!pic.twitter.com/SxyUq7fRxB
878808751859519489 2017-06-24 02:55:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Prices were high on everything. I didn't buy any games. Bought an Everdrive, though. But found a couple cool incidentals.
878808298484637696 2017-06-24 02:53:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A great time at @TooManyGames today. Saw a lot of great friends I only see a couple times a year. Met many @LivingIn8Bits fans. Great times!pic.twitter.com/vRa9pSnEaB
878730062245310464 2017-06-24 21:42:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want all of the videogames here at TooManyGames. And there's a gold NWC cart here. No big deal.pic.twitter.com/YuDoMKalBf
878375055268433926 2017-06-23 22:11:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TooManyGames @PixelDan I will say hi tomorrow. And give you a big prolonged awkward hug, which will make up for my wet phone butt dial earlier today.
878356632371163136 2017-06-23 20:58:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally saw Wonder Woman and it was great. I've seen this meme passed around and it's very accurate. Nice to see a good DC movie again.pic.twitter.com/bNjPzosBCO
878356247740911617 2017-06-23 20:57:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @_Cappelli_ I'll be there tomorrow only.
878290661728026624 2017-06-23 16:36:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan Which was probably just audio of me carrying heavy stuff up a flight of stairs and complaining about it while out of breath. Yeah....
878290271724646400 2017-06-23 16:34:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The dangers of a drop of water on a smart phone touchscreen. It ended up dialing @PixelDan and held a 3 min 11 sec call while in my pocket.
878283921682780160 2017-06-23 16:09:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic @NextGameDave I can only go to the con tomorrow. Let me know if there's a Retroware home base for merch. Got DVDs to peddle. See you there! Awkward hugs!
878282261837303808 2017-06-23 16:03:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa They had only 11 in store. But ordering through their system with no shipping cost. I hate exclusives. Still waiting on Skyward Sword Link.
878281256210792448 2017-06-23 15:59:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'll be at @TooManyGames tomorrow with a @LivingIn8Bits panel at 6:30 about post production editing. Also will have LI8B and SPB DVDs on me.
878280784804683776 2017-06-23 15:57:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I stopped by Best Buy looking for one and the clerk ordered one for me through the system to ship next week. So maybe in store order only.
878110786131968001 2017-06-22 04:41:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Have fun! I'll see you there on Saturday.
878052387402924032 2017-06-22 00:49:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My favorite movie of all time.https://twitter.com/OldSchool80s/status/877906574869766144
878047853544783872 2017-06-22 00:31:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A lot of jimmies went overboard at work. Rainbow colored ice cream toppings all over the carpet. Jimmies everywhere.pic.twitter.com/f6T01n77gM
878013476689596416 2017-06-22 22:15:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @8biteric @ShadyJay1908 @JordanFringe94 @PixelDan It wasn't me, but I'll gladly take credit! Made my day seeing them up there. Hope you all had fun at the game!
877535502987128833 2017-06-21 14:35:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf I've been sick since Friday. I started feeling better and then it suddenly got worse. And of course during one of my busiest weeks. Ugh...
877531722329542656 2017-06-21 14:20:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going on Day 6 of this mystery illness and it still is not showing signs of going away. Seriously? I've got stuff to do. Go away.
877165789568172032 2017-06-20 14:06:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear mystery illness, you have overstayed your welcome. I've got work to do.
876849660920553472 2017-06-19 17:10:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Did not expect to be followed by @TayZonday today, but will take it. Hey Tay, check out @LivingIn8Bits! You may like it!

876267632911142912 2017-06-17 02:37:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> One of the things I'm looking forward to when The Last Jedi comes out is having yet another Star Wars movie marathon prior to seeing it.
876123933103325184 2017-06-17 17:06:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sick again. So stupid. 3rd weekend in a row, something preventing me from seeing Wonder Woman. Stupid illness.....
875779524008562689 2017-06-16 18:18:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @michaelponter Marty and Rocky I believe.
875777303644692480 2017-06-16 18:09:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @michaelponter Yup, that was the How to Play Baseball tutorial. Found the raw footage on VHS-C
875567495561621504 2017-06-15 04:15:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here they are. My first 2 cameras where Mixed Nuts Productions started. Brings back a lot of memories.pic.twitter.com/2NzaIgxgRn
875563774735810561 2017-06-15 04:00:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Probably the craziest aspect of looking through an old VHS-C viewfinder is how it makes everything feel like it was taped 15 years ago.
875558952058093570 2017-06-15 03:41:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Found footage on these old VHS-C tapes of @michaelponter hitting the camera with a batted tennis ball circa 1999/2000.pic.twitter.com/kCeRtt6e7s
875554422029516800 2017-06-15 03:23:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Found a stack of old tapes and my old compact VHS camera. Surprised that it still works and laughing at the crazy stuff on the tapes.
874093431139729408 2017-06-11 02:38:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @sfurze76 Thank you for the kind words! Much appreciated!

873213494396628993 2017-06-09 16:21:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Eating chicken nuggets and tater tots for lunch because I'm an adult.
873001451353776129 2017-06-08 02:19:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Like, quit during the results screen and not even go back to the lobby. They dance around, yet too cowardly to stick around when they lose.
873001224857104385 2017-06-08 02:18:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You ever notice in Smash Bros that the players who are the most arrogant and showoff tend to be the quickest to rage quit when they lose?
872292425062129666 2017-06-06 03:21:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just saw Split also. Very impressive performance by James McAvoy.
872291391619178498 2017-06-06 03:17:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I liked La La Land. Wasn't into Moonlight as much. My favorite film from last awards season was The Edge of Seventeen.
872287964121923589 2017-06-06 03:03:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally saw Hidden Figures. Excellent film.  Sad it took me so long to see. Tried to see it in theaters, but screenings were sold out.

871730062940393472 2017-06-05 14:06:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> John Oliver was on point last night with this story.https://youtu.be/5scez5dqtAc
871557391594270720 2017-06-04 02:40:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Was told "USUCK," "UNOGOOD," and "GOKILLURSLF" by several players I beat tonight in Smash Bros. This guy in particular didn't like me.pic.twitter.com/jaEylJhub9
871525569258815488 2017-06-04 00:34:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I play my Wii U far more than my Switch by a lot. Smash Bros has a lot to do with that.
871505321751187456 2017-06-04 23:13:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Haven't gotten to see Wonder Woman yet, but have been hearing great  things. Hoping to see it next weekend. Adulting gets in the way again.
871493142826168320 2017-06-04 22:25:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> First time at the batting cage since October. Dang am I out of shape. Need to remedy that more often as I'm only getting older and fatter.
871209459552575488 2017-06-03 03:38:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@theavettbros put on a hell of a show tonight. Great performers and absolute class act people. It was an honor to work with them again.pic.twitter.com/886PGn3HJJ
870863368302854144 2017-06-02 04:43:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've posted it before, but I adore this Goofy Movie video by @stuart_edge and @PeterHollens. Can't stop watching.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYhvAIEGI_Y
869771210049105921 2017-05-30 04:23:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> We've learned a new word today. It's "covfefe." It may be a verb, but I think it sounds more like a noun to describe a breed of fluffy cat.
869714634504364032 2017-05-30 00:38:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Started the new season of House of Cards and already realizing that our current reality is stranger than fiction.
869380888689356810 2017-05-29 02:32:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the Scrubs marathon reminds me of how much I love and miss it. It's so funny with great characters and packs an emotional punch.
869037855523446784 2017-05-28 03:49:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Want to find the worst drudges of humanity? Play any videogame online over a holiday weekend. You'll encounter the worst of the worst.
869002436672978944 2017-05-28 01:28:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love dialogue in Kimmy Schmidt: "My favorite show is the dining hall menu. Does that mean you get the menu ahead of time? When's chicken?"

868835740175794177 2017-05-28 14:25:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 7 years ago, I had an idea for a web series combining my love of filmmaking and retro games and @LivingIn8Bits was born. Now we have DVDs!pic.twitter.com/lhIQJYxJAz
868655094681800704 2017-05-27 02:28:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Picked up Ultra Street Fighter II and learned a brutal truth. I'm really, really bad at Street Fighter. Not having an SNES haunts me again.
868480653725245440 2017-05-27 14:54:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LivingIn8Bits @dwarfbeard Can't wait to see it!
868477045541662721 2017-05-27 14:40:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dwarfbeard Woohoo! Quite a haul! Hope you enjoy the extra goodies we threw in there for you. Thanks for being such a generous @LivingIn8Bits fan!
868284715920437249 2017-05-26 01:56:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 200cc in Mario Kart is insane. How anyone can get 3 stars is beyond me.
867954720157061120 2017-05-25 04:05:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @KFremonCraig You're very welcome! I've been sincerely gushing about the film. Hoping to get out and make a short in the near future. Take care! Thanks!
867930640322355200 2017-05-25 02:29:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @KFremonCraig Thank you for making such a wonderful film. I wish I could tell you in more detail why I loved it. Truly a special film.
867930423808081920 2017-05-25 02:28:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @KFremonCraig I finally saw and absolutely adored The Edge of Seventeen. It floored me. It makes me want to get back out and make a movie.
867927936665518088 2017-05-25 02:18:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I fell in love with this movie. I can't even describe how much I loved this movie. Maybe that I'm now buying it after Netflixing it.
867926964862046208 2017-05-25 02:14:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Edge of Seventeen is one of the best written, best directed, best acted films I've seen in a long time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vswj96INhmo
867909083109765123 2017-05-25 01:03:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 40 years of adventures in a galaxy far, far away. Thank you @starwars and here's to 40 more years of adventures!pic.twitter.com/nmHZZ14Qsl
867874453111394304 2017-05-25 22:46:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Check out this commercial I filmed with the Phanatic and @theavettbros.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9dC99unofU
867578519467040768 2017-05-24 03:10:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very often I feel remakes tend to be done with the wrong intentions, failing to recognize what made the original so special to begin with.
867575963189739520 2017-05-24 03:00:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are irreplaceable.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9BbUqHrWFI
867575673484972033 2017-05-24 02:58:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got home just in time to see the big end scene of the Dirty Dancing remake. Who thought this was a good idea?
866659481425465345 2017-05-22 14:18:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The day started with my car hyrdoplaning in the heavy rain. I sure hope that's not an omen.
866504541864431620 2017-05-21 04:02:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I still don't fully understand what the purpose of dabbing is and why it ever was a thing --if it even still is a thing.pic.twitter.com/bEVLja7CHn
866445214382268416 2017-05-21 00:06:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seems like a good night to sit back and watch UHF.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvy2tRH7HNE
865940914811928586 2017-05-20 14:42:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> International shipping. Yay.....
865413349273518080 2017-05-18 03:46:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage It was a good way to open the reboot series with a bang. I've always been a more casual Chris Cornell fan, but this tune always stuck to me.
865408198953402369 2017-05-18 03:26:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sad that Chris Cornell passed away. My favorite song of his is You'll Know My Name from Casino Royale.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnzgdBAKyJo
865035947993444352 2017-05-17 02:46:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> If there's one thing I can't stand during TV shows and movies are when computers make weird beep sounds that would never happen in real life
863586580988129280 2017-05-13 02:47:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nostalgia can be often be both comforting and depressing simultaneously.
863533254019866626 2017-05-13 23:15:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Billythechode I'm in the same boat. I overall enjoyed it, but took like 30 hours to like it. The survivalist stuff and weapon durability is annoying.
863532919108902912 2017-05-13 23:14:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Those wings I just ate were delicious. I would have taken a picture of them, but I was far too busy eating them.
863509642776903681 2017-05-13 21:41:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Why are XL shirts by some companies now sized like L or smaller? It's quite frustrating.
863451601352216577 2017-05-13 17:51:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Exhaustion has overtaken my body. Moving has been difficult today. Yay to being an adult.
862157045767733249 2017-05-09 04:07:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I had to remove a previous post commentating on crazy people only to be retweeted by bot crazy people. I'm done with social media today.
862153736285634560 2017-05-09 03:54:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage I'm more concerned with this person not knowing that the language we speak is called "English."
862153000936247296 2017-05-09 03:51:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't know whether to laugh or be seriously concerned for the future of humanity and civil discourse. Welcome to 2017 America.
862152692768141312 2017-05-09 03:49:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The best part. I poke fun by saying "You speak English good." The actual response: " DO I LOOK ENGLIS BROAD? HUH YOU DO MIKE..NOW GTFOH.."
862143894951276544 2017-05-09 03:14:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been waiting patiently for the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros DVD manufacturing to finish. And by patiently, I mean very impatiently...
861715277184159748 2017-05-08 22:51:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is required Monday evening watching because who doesn't want to rock out to the music from A Goofy Movie?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYhvAIEGI_Y
861008618317127680 2017-05-06 00:03:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Baby Groot is one of the most adorable characters ever. I want one.
860289841166262272 2017-05-04 00:27:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> On the plus side, every day is Star Wars Day, so I will enjoy it more this weekend.
860289752024719361 2017-05-04 00:27:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Today was a dark, depressing day. Where I should've been happy about Star Wars Day, instead I'm lamenting many things. Sad day all around.
860136293984022528 2017-05-04 14:17:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> May the 4th be with you. Happy Star Wars Day!
859260448583102465 2017-05-01 04:17:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hey, it's me!https://twitter.com/diegoettedgui/status/857689046902026241
858876811425570816 2017-04-30 02:52:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I picked a hell of a time to start watching The Man in the High Castle.
858177997702139904 2017-04-28 04:35:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Mario Kart really has some of the most unforgiving and punishing Rubber Band AI in all video games. Worst is original RC Pro Am on NES.
858177541814837248 2017-04-28 04:34:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And now blue shelled 3 times in another race in 100cc. Luckily was so far ahead that time that I didn't lose the race.
858173359921795072 2017-04-28 04:17:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Was just red shelled, blue shelled, lightning struck, and red shelled again right before the finish line in Mario Kart 8. Rubber band AI....
858126620934230016 2017-04-28 01:11:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino Sadly more difficult the older you get. Real life gets in the way far too much now.
858126555737976833 2017-04-28 01:11:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 Need both available time and money first. But possibly if any of those come to pass.
858124612974112771 2017-04-28 01:03:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My biggest goal for the upcoming months/summer is to make at least one short film. Got an itch to get back to filming something new.
858107816460120065 2017-04-28 23:57:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, this is a new one. Someone blocked me on all social media because I pointed out that Stonehenge was real and not a conspiracy. Huh?
858095043323756545 2017-04-28 23:06:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still keeps the ridiculous Rubber Band AI that the series is known for in full effect.
857792352605306882 2017-04-27 03:03:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt @dyhptg I hate internet fickleness and revisionism.
857791220218777600 2017-04-27 02:58:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt @dyhptg I really liked Other M. I don't understand the immense hate.
857783582366081024 2017-04-27 02:28:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nobody asked for a New Nintendo 2DS XL. You know what people did ask for? More NES Classic units. Take a guess which will be more available?
857020454049112064 2017-04-25 23:56:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PrincipalWTHS Hands down one of the best in the business. Fortunate to have had him for history during my junior year. Happy Retirement!
855950897578483712 2017-04-22 01:06:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Done bug testing the SPB DVD. Everything is there, buttons work, and all videos play (even the Easter Eggs, but shhhhh). Now back to #MST3K.
855919894772232196 2017-04-22 23:02:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been spending several hours bug testing the @LivingIn8Bits DVD. Watching all the features. Testing all the buttons. Hoping to send out soon.
855187682309308418 2017-04-20 22:33:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Another one of my DP contributions to the #MST3K universe with these intros in the Turkey Day DVD. I had to pick one up. Loving the reboot.pic.twitter.com/s6t38iCSCk
854905242332409857 2017-04-19 03:51:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey No reason to feel guilty. I haven't seen every MST3K episode either. But def. watch the new ones, especially to see Matt and Steph's names!
854903224041689088 2017-04-19 03:43:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Oh good, your wedding yeti is here!" I don't know why, but this joke made me laugh so much that I had to stop the episode. #MST3Kpic.twitter.com/0AEX2oHNjW
854525715139760128 2017-04-18 02:43:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @stephanieyuhas @cinevore Also, #MST3K is one of the rare TV theme songs I never grow tired of, never skip, and listen/sing along every viewing.
854524178623606784 2017-04-18 02:36:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @stephanieyuhas @cinevore Glad to have #MST3K back. Feels like early-mid 90s years all over again watching on Comedy Central after school, but now after work. YAY!
854522272647917568 2017-04-18 02:29:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Best part of watching the #MST3K return is seeing @cinevore and @stephanieyuhas' names in the end credits! YAY! Super funny and awesome!pic.twitter.com/6S7nwVVqEu
853640911871410176 2017-04-16 16:07:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Christos Voskrese! Happy Pascha!
852914786664931328 2017-04-14 16:01:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Absolute chills. This is an amazing time to be a Star Wars fan!https://twitter.com/starwars/status/852913950060494848
852913991953391616 2017-04-14 15:58:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Between the teaser poster and the trailer -- absolute chills. Wow!https://twitter.com/starwars/status/852912773910548480
852688997902151680 2017-04-13 01:04:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ActionFigureAdv Absolutely ridiculous.
852612259755036673 2017-04-13 19:59:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I managed to find an NES Classic back in November but haven't seen a single one on shelves since. This is ridiculoushttp://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/13/nintendo-discontinues-the-nes-classic-edition
852561548916797440 2017-04-13 16:38:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Still get choked up. Carrie was the best.https://twitter.com/starwars/status/852559051086979072
852556399213244416 2017-04-13 16:17:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ugh, more retail exclusive amiibo. I love those little things, but the limited edition exclusive nonsense is annoying.
852008068758073344 2017-04-11 03:58:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Which is pretty much why I made a @LivingIn8Bits sketch roasting the behavior/attitude of some Smash Bros players on the upcoming SPB DVD.
852007858036248576 2017-04-11 03:57:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> First night off in a while, so I played some Smash Bros. I'm then quickly reminded how awful some players can be.
851071297798889472 2017-04-09 13:56:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 24 hours left to pre-order the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros DVD. Don't miss out! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixednutsproductions/super-plumber-bros-dvd-pre-orderpic.twitter.com/kwMt1MHXW1
850920794700034048 2017-04-08 03:58:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thank you, Scott.
850920543339655170 2017-04-08 03:57:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg It kind of devolved further when I said that it was for video production. "Oh, you mean movies? I like movies." Just give me my receipt.
850874359942172673 2017-04-08 00:53:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> At Staples, the clerk asked me with absolute seriousness: "Oh, Mixed Nuts Productions...Do you run a peanut factory?"
850506346973843461 2017-04-07 00:31:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Only a couple days left to Pre-order the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros DVD. Get one before time runs out!http://kck.st/2mdp72h
849444368863961089 2017-04-04 02:11:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And of course, oh man, that Vader scene at the end of Rogue One.
849438689990258690 2017-04-04 01:49:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.
849429335220117508 2017-04-04 01:11:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The gleeful giddiness watching and hearing Darth Vader in Rogue One cannot be stated enough. One of the greatest characters in film history.
848995489496354816 2017-04-03 20:27:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> #GoPhils
848681811500830720 2017-04-02 23:41:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sfurze76 I was hoping for a clean version of it without the sound effects and such, as well as high quality bit rate recording.
848587467884310533 2017-04-02 17:26:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Is there anywhere to get the trailer music from Breath of the Wild?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE
848552616728690692 2017-04-02 15:08:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Only 1 week left to Pre-Order Super Plumber Bros! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixednutsproductions/super-plumber-bros-dvd-pre-orderhttps://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/848552152280817664
848375487164542977 2017-04-01 03:24:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> NC was attractive for movies to film in during the 80s and 90s. It's fun when movies are filmed near you. I obviously love Philly/NJ movies.
848372506645995524 2017-04-01 03:12:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the original TMNT movie tonight again. I love it every time. Jim Henson's Creature Shop were geniuses. I miss movies made like that
848335501274820609 2017-04-01 00:45:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been called a "pusi," "bad," & told to "git gud" & "getbetr" in 5 matches so far - all where I won. Just another night playing Smash Bros.
848242945555935233 2017-04-01 18:37:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Wish I had a @LivingIn8Bits April Fool's video. Sadly, been so under the weather this week that got nothing done. I'll enjoy all the others.
848006347018952704 2017-03-31 02:57:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Very true. I don't have the child element. Couldn't imagine that. I did have many 3/4am nights and then back to it after work the next day.
848005924518285312 2017-03-31 02:55:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Ah, you're getting there. I've clocked maybe 120 hours. The completionist in me dreading the 700+ more korok seeds there apparently are.
848005312804249600 2017-03-31 02:53:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa How far along are you? I got all shrines, divine beasts, some tunic upgrades to max, and around 170 Korok seeds.
848004458827087873 2017-03-31 02:49:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa But you haven't stormed the castle yet? I went in there early on just to peak around and found some goodies in there. Worth a sneak in.
848004348231786505 2017-03-31 02:49:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa We've also long established that I'm in the minority on my feelings with Breath of the wild, so take my jabs with a grain of salt.
848003143657033729 2017-03-31 02:44:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Because it may be underwhelming and unsatisfying like the final battle in Breath of the Wild. Oh, snap, zing.
847994211823747073 2017-03-31 02:09:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 3rd time fighting Ganon in Breath of the Wild. Anybody else seriously underwhelmed by the final battle and ending?
847616819510657024 2017-03-30 01:09:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching music videos from the late 90s. So many classic jams. Brings me back to those high school formals. I also feel very old....
847605750981513221 2017-03-30 00:25:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimStoeckle Also:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB2yqeD0Nus
847605464602877955 2017-03-30 00:24:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimStoeckle Make sure you do a carbo load and eat fettuccine alfredo while abstaining from water. It'll work wonders....
847534155051257857 2017-03-30 19:41:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Agreed! Best TMNT movie out there.https://twitter.com/PixelDan/status/847531944892092425
847214385080733696 2017-03-29 22:30:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear mysterious illness that suddenly hit me like a brick and now has taken me down for the count, please go away. Ain't got time for that.
845674822990548994 2017-03-25 16:32:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Performing open heart surgery in my dear NES. 72 pin connector is toast. Replacing with Blinking Red Light Win.pic.twitter.com/lrPAdIvt9o
844711213695143941 2017-03-22 00:43:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have the Hylian Shield, but I rarely ever use it because I'm afraid if that breaking and losing it. I'm afraid to use many of my weapons.
844710742892924928 2017-03-22 00:41:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Truthfully, the weapon fragility across the board in the game irks me. There's great stuff in it, but this just brings it down for me.
844710382354808832 2017-03-22 00:40:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's more frustrating because the Master Sword runs out of "power" so quickly that you result to other swords. They then break. It's dumb.
844709601547292676 2017-03-22 00:37:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's the Master Sword, sword of the goddess that can only be wielded by the Hero of Hyrule. It shouldn't be recharging or losing power.pic.twitter.com/t6fHkV2YcW
844708507249262592 2017-03-22 00:32:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> To me, the dumbest mechanic in Breath of the Wild is the Master Sword "losing power."
844389868654510085 2017-03-21 03:26:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Someone crazy who knows nothing about me claims they know a lot about my life because of my blog. I didn't know I had a blog. News to me.

843945583643705345 2017-03-20 22:01:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @tinyneenja Many issues on many different computers (both PC and Mac). Just one of those days....
843926440714424323 2017-03-20 20:45:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm at my wit's end with computers failing today.....
843627775827349506 2017-03-19 00:58:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This scene in the remake was done so poorly, removing all emotion and character. That was the moment that broke the whole movie for me.
843627484226686981 2017-03-19 00:57:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Rewatching the original Beauty and the Beast and this is the most impressive scene to me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf1bu2ZQ1tc
843613678037536768 2017-03-19 00:02:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the original animated Beauty and the Beast to cleanse the bad taste of the remake.

843542721096761344 2017-03-19 19:20:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I really hated the Beauty and the Beast remake. Absolutely hated it.

842438451467288576 2017-03-16 18:12:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There are some people who are so obsessively delusional and sick that they desperately need a hobby. I suggest basket weaving or knitting.
842174192946712576 2017-03-15 00:42:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Even though I beat Breath of the Wild, still exploring. 109 shrines completed now. I'm totally maxing out Link as much as I can.

841072385533071361 2017-03-12 23:44:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't think I've laughed this much in years. For anyone playing Breath of the Wild, this is a much watch.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvbqxBUG_c
841037840196730880 2017-03-12 21:27:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just saw Logan. The most mature and dramatic X-Men movie. Very good stuff.

840787044922200064 2017-03-11 04:50:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It wasn't my favorite Zelda game though and not perfect. Not sure I'd put it in my Top 5 Zelda games. But still a satisfying game overall.
840786366032183296 2017-03-11 04:47:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But it was an epic adventure with a lot of exploring and fun battles which of course are what makes Zelda games fun.
840786120808026113 2017-03-11 04:46:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just beat Breath of the Wild. Overall, it was a good experience playing. Didn't like it much at first. Took a long time to warm up to it.
840622314345680896 2017-03-11 17:55:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Pre-Order Super Plumber Bros on DVD from @LivingIn8Bits! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixednutsproductions/super-plumber-bros-dvd-pre-orderpic.twitter.com/k1lNTYmFCM
839325965968887808 2017-03-07 04:04:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm all around leveling up as much as I can. Funny enough, it's making Link faster, stronger, and all around unstoppable. Lots of questing.
839325681922289664 2017-03-07 04:03:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel like I've abandoned the main story of Breath of the Wild in favor of exploring, finding shrines, Korok seeds, and towers.
838952664222294016 2017-03-06 03:21:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Very sorry. Won't say how or where I found it. Lots of questing to get it.
838951095657508866 2017-03-06 03:15:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I had assumed it was a foregone conclusion since the sword was  in the trailers and the Master Edition bundle. Sorry.
838950438993031168 2017-03-06 03:12:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Why the skeptical face?
838948972072947712 2017-03-06 03:06:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I now wield the Master Sword in Breath of the Wild. All that questing and exploring has paid off. Come at me now, monsters and Ganon.pic.twitter.com/a4OKiY21V7
838573354621808641 2017-03-05 02:14:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've only beaten one dungeon so far. At another one ready to go in but instead sidetracked to more exploring so level up before I enter.
838573075188838400 2017-03-05 02:12:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been finding myself going to areas I probably shouldn't go to yet for hours, activating towers, and searching for shrines to level up.
838572916501540864 2017-03-05 02:12:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Day 3 of Breath of the Wild and it's definitely getting better. One thing for sure is you get lost in playing the game and exploring.
838067723284410370 2017-03-04 16:44:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Impa making Michael Scott jokes in Breath of the Wild. #nintendoswitch #ZeldaBreathoftheWild #Zeldapic.twitter.com/xXUTyjTsyW
838039277984485377 2017-03-04 14:51:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Cooking essentially replaces dropped hearts and potions so far. That isn't too bad. But you're constantly breaking weapons.
837915211210317824 2017-03-03 06:38:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Which in turn makes combat very annoying. Lots of Game Over screens so far. I've been very lukewarm to it so far.
837904188516499456 2017-03-03 05:55:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been playing Breath of the Wild for about 6 or 7 hours now. I'm not loving it yet. Not a fan of the survivalist/breaking weapon system.
837795665422004225 2017-03-03 22:43:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got my Switch. Let the games begin.pic.twitter.com/qWOEjJpGxO
837534047299497987 2017-03-02 05:24:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No midnight launch for me. My Switch will be coming by way of carrier pigeon.
837500001546821636 2017-03-02 03:08:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yeah, I'm totally wearing Zelda pajama pants and socks in anticipation of the Switch and Breath of the Wild tomorrow. I'm a geek and proud.pic.twitter.com/5SMBVG0o55
837125393220005888 2017-03-01 02:20:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally watching Kubo and the Two Strings. It's sooooo good.
836776414955319297 2017-02-28 03:13:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Reading somebody's speech written for you on a teleprompter well doesn't mean what you're saying is true.
836765374150492160 2017-02-28 02:29:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My blood is boiling from this.
836758567835295744 2017-02-28 02:02:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm watching the speech tonight because apparently I like migraines caused by incompetent stupidity.
836440898514878465 2017-02-27 05:00:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Jon Stewart on Colbert right now. I miss him being on TV. The world needs him back so bad.pic.twitter.com/oVQ93ML613
836229567492804610 2017-02-27 15:00:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Again, @jehorowitz handled an awkward and embarrassing situation with class and grace.

836083029240078336 2017-02-26 05:18:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I couldn't even fathom how I would feel in such a situation.
836082319425486852 2017-02-26 05:15:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, that just happened. Crazy. #Oscars
836081093925298176 2017-02-26 05:10:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I liked La La Land a lot. I don't understand the hate. I haven't gotten to see the other movies nominated, but hope to soon. #Oscars

836078419028946944 2017-02-26 05:00:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Emma Stone was great in La La Land. Dare I say she was better in Birdman. Either way, she's great. #Oscars
836075420516769793 2017-02-26 04:48:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> La La Land was definitely a visioned film and very well directed so well deserved. #Oscars
836070987024203777 2017-02-26 04:30:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Kimmel ragging on Matt Damon all night has been great. #Oscars

836056460677238784 2017-02-26 03:32:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got to say, the VFX for The Jungle Book were pretty astounding. Well deserved. #Oscars
836055138666229760 2017-02-26 03:27:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So that was a somewhat odd moment. #Oscars

836039841112522753 2017-02-26 02:26:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also, that performance by @auliicravalho was amazing. She has such a bright future. Such a talented young woman! #Oscars
836037842493128705 2017-02-26 02:18:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How Far I'll Go is such a great song by @Lin_Manuel. Also, @TheRock is quite possibly the most charming man alive. #Oscars
836036493638520832 2017-02-26 02:13:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Katherine Johnson at the Oscars is awesome!  Scientists are superstars. #Oscars
836032190131683329 2017-02-26 01:56:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I haven't gotten to see Moonlight yet, but everything else I've seen Mahershala Ali in, he's been fantastic. Happy for him! #Oscars
836015518662393856 2017-02-26 00:50:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love the Oscars. I watch every year and dream big. Maybe, hopefully, God willing someday..... #Oscars
835350335107526656 2017-02-24 04:46:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've had my reservations about a Beauty and the Beast remake since it was announced. Still not convinced.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT1VQkTTT7M
835177627031842818 2017-02-24 17:20:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's near 80 in South Jersey and I'm wearing shorts and sandals in February. What the...?
834873763665756160 2017-02-23 21:13:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Florida was 70+ degrees and sunny in Feb when I left. I come home to Jersey and it's 70+ degrees and sunny in Feb. What?
834782889971740672 2017-02-23 15:12:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Who got to their gate a full 2 hours before their flight? This guy.pic.twitter.com/VY820RufbL
834226620655353859 2017-02-21 02:21:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 It's at a mall in Clearwater. Wish it was near home. ThinkGeek does have a website which is how I knew if it before.
834199318718472192 2017-02-21 00:33:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's as if the heavens designed a store just for me.pic.twitter.com/B9xYq8Qfx9
833511102013112320 2017-02-19 02:58:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There is so much stupid in the world. To counter the stupid, here's another picture of a palm tree in sunny Florida.pic.twitter.com/O3DUZpJKWE
832733687393484800 2017-02-17 23:29:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Greetings from beautiful Clearwater!pic.twitter.com/V3sD49WfRw
832435586615091200 2017-02-16 03:44:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Very true there. Sometimes even more passionately than politics somehow.
832434862741188608 2017-02-16 03:41:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg I dare expressed an opinion about best/worst Mega Man weapons. Waiting to see how new sketch coming on SPB DVD will be received...
832433516289855488 2017-02-16 03:36:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Any opinions I offer in my films are in the writing. No more straight up reviews for me. I still get roasted for Mega Man Top 10s.
832431004237307904 2017-02-16 03:26:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg That's why I've always been so controlling about the quality control of LI8B and be as inoffensive as possible.
832429454873993216 2017-02-16 03:20:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Didn't realize there was a hubbub about it. I hate drama. I try to run and avoid at all costs, especially with LI8B.
832426465081827329 2017-02-16 03:08:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dyhptg Is something apparently going on today? I feel like I completely missed something here.
832293173502287873 2017-02-16 18:18:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great article on my childhood idol @alyankovic. I'm so lucky to have gotten to meet & interview Al back in the day! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKzLkS0cjeMhttps://twitter.com/geoffedgers/status/832257056761577475
832261656625500160 2017-02-16 16:13:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @JayHooft That or Luke is using his green lightsaber still from Return of the Jedi.
831718230020542464 2017-02-14 04:14:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Window shopping is both enlightening and heartbreaking at the same time.
831589927251038208 2017-02-14 19:44:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I ask what I have asked time and time again. Why is everything going on right now excusable? Why is this OK?
831364281828524032 2017-02-13 04:47:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every day just keeps getting crazier and crazier. Just when we think it can't possibly get crazier, it does. What is this universe?
830859005547384836 2017-02-12 19:19:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Now have all of the elements for a new @LivingIn8Bits sketch filmed. Heavy post production continues. Sketch will be on upcoming SPB DVD.
830651523382255617 2017-02-11 05:35:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I want one day where a CNN alert doesn't scare the hell out of me!" SNL
830637229731147777 2017-02-11 04:38:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> SNL has been beyond brilliant. Melissa McCarthy on point. That opening sketch was hilarious. SNL is trolling so much and it is amazing.
830636467013767168 2017-02-11 04:35:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "The slaughter at Fraggle Rock!" Hilarious!
830635740421824512 2017-02-11 04:32:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want to see Melissa McCarthy on SNL every single week.
830633730960138241 2017-02-11 04:24:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very much curious what SNL is going to do tonight. Last week's episode was one of the best they've ever done. Going to be hard to top it.
830555877828608000 2017-02-11 23:15:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hey all, did anybody else get their 1099 for professional protesting yet? I still haven't received mine and can't file my taxes without it.
829897836649205762 2017-02-09 03:40:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Billythechode XOXOXO
829895211870453760 2017-02-09 03:30:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The segment on George Carlin reminds me also how fortunate I was that I got to meet him before he passed away. #historyofcomedy
829893908222078976 2017-02-09 03:25:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching The History of Comedy on CNN. Reminding me how important comedy is and why it is so important to our society, especially nowadays.
829720485386711040 2017-02-09 15:55:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You know what would be nice? A leader who doesn't act like a petulant, immature, spoiled brat on a daily basis. That would be very nice...
829404819622334465 2017-02-08 19:01:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's near 70 degrees here in Jersey today. Snow storm expected tomorrow with 8" of snow. What...?
829171116744785920 2017-02-07 03:32:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Listening to the Sanders/Cruz debate on CNN has been great. I miss actual civil discourse and debate with good arguments on both sides.
829033408265334786 2017-02-07 18:25:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How can anyone be proud of this?
829030542993661953 2017-02-07 18:14:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> All of this anger & frustration, make sure to hold onto it through to the 2018 midterms. Vote out the people who enabled this nonsense.
829025701420474368 2017-02-07 17:55:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Money may not be able to buy happiness or love, but it can surely buy you power, especially if you're not even remotely qualified for it....
829024515321630721 2017-02-07 17:50:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Party and power over country seems to be the motto now......
829022505344065536 2017-02-07 17:42:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's not like education matters or anything..........
828846646813290497 2017-02-06 06:03:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's absolutely crazy how many hours of the day go by when working in After Effects on a post-production VFX heavy project.
828702014121111552 2017-02-06 20:28:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @AdioBRoyster @Jovan10 And who was the one who was saying that it wasn't over until it was over, hmmmm?
828689332840067073 2017-02-06 19:38:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Rotobrush to the rescue in After Effects. Just taking an eternity to render and work on.
828444900588937216 2017-02-05 03:27:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, that totally sucks big time. Ugh. I need a drink.
828438550291030021 2017-02-05 03:01:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Unbelievable. #SuperBowl
828435418693640192 2017-02-05 02:49:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Julio Jones with a beast mode catch. Incredible. #SuperBowl
828431577885634561 2017-02-05 02:34:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ghost dog ad was...bizarre.
828419586852794368 2017-02-05 01:46:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wonder what PuppyMonkeyBaby has been up to...
828415115477262337 2017-02-05 01:28:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So hats off to Lady Gaga on that great halftime show. That was excellent. #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
828412973370769413 2017-02-05 01:20:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Lady Gaga rocking the keytar for the win. #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
828409745723838466 2017-02-05 01:07:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sean Spicer's halftime report is that Tom Brady had the great first half of a QB in #SuperBowl history, period.
828404408799154178 2017-02-05 00:46:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Beautiful Pick 6! #SuperBowl
828399374942224385 2017-02-05 00:26:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The number of people who mentioned Terry Bradshaw's shirt stain just got trolled in probably the biggest advertising win of the #SuperBowl
828398536358244356 2017-02-05 00:22:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the #SuperBowl and eating tater tots. Great way to enjoy the big game.
827371463212724226 2017-02-02 04:21:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Had a nice view of the skyline tonight.pic.twitter.com/6EhUqwuVTT
827167976327610368 2017-02-02 14:53:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties 'cause it's cooooold out there today.
826950533034434560 2017-02-01 00:29:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I do not have the mental ability to comprehend and consume the news on a daily basis anymore. I'll age 20 years in 4 if I don't take breaks.
826654215007256576 2017-01-31 04:51:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I miss Jon Stewart on TV. We really need him to return.
826640775383506944 2017-01-31 03:58:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LadyStarstorm @SpaceKappa Yay, congrats!
826489504362020865 2017-01-31 17:57:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Today's fortune cookie at work.pic.twitter.com/UlKuBKWQrp
826135026492436481 2017-01-30 18:28:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This has got to be one of the strangest things I have ever watched. http://screenrant.com/spider-man-homecoming-weird-trailer/?utm_source=SR-FB-P&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_campaign=SR-FB-P&view=lista
825954374685966337 2017-01-29 06:30:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Can't sleep. Been up watching old @LivingIn8Bits videos.http://Youtube.com/MixedNutsProductions
825899564716720129 2017-01-29 02:52:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Still amazed every time I watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit. It will always be my favorite movie.
825897744413949952 2017-01-29 02:45:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Walt sent me."
825785278048649217 2017-01-29 19:18:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino Actually haven't rewatched Who Framed Roger Rabbit yet. But on the docket today.
825784433903075329 2017-01-29 19:15:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been watching my favorite movies lately to ease my mind and to maintain a certain degree of mental sanity in these uncertain times.
825521534919966721 2017-01-28 01:50:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am here because my great grandparents on both sides immigrated to the USA to find a better life. We are a nation of immigrants.
825371862884614144 2017-01-28 15:56:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm honestly in shock all around with what is happening in this new administration. This is not what America is supposed to be.
825145323270049792 2017-01-27 00:55:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going through old family photos and came across this cool one my dad took. The back it says "Willie Mays batting at Wrigley Field." 8/7/66pic.twitter.com/WXQdzYRpvd
825054227261190144 2017-01-27 18:53:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Shot a couple elements for a @LivingIn8Bits sketch this past week for a SPB DVD Exclusive. It's wonderfully silly. Still got more to go.
824838378197762049 2017-01-26 04:36:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love science and wish my brain was better at comprehending it. That is why I have a great deal of respect & admiration for those that are.
824797696926031874 2017-01-26 01:54:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just going to leave this here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_P9PR5ckFk
824293137241833472 2017-01-25 16:29:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> These were good times. Miss you guys!https://twitter.com/PixelDan/status/824292365141737473
824283094538653698 2017-01-25 15:49:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic @GamingHistorian Did you also cross state lines to vote again in another state? I hear that's what the cool kids are doing.
823964733619531776 2017-01-24 18:44:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hats off to the Dutch for this brilliant satire. It's fantastic, believe me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELD2AwFN9Nc&
823751187157700608 2017-01-23 04:36:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Please read this thread.https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/823607638357397505
823604301826244608 2017-01-23 18:52:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yes. So much yes. Can't wait.https://twitter.com/starwars/status/823561256078548992
823367453199712256 2017-01-22 03:11:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've seen E.T. so many times, but watching it tonight for the first time in years really hit me.
823349648408670208 2017-01-22 02:00:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching E.T. for the first time in years. It's such a great film. Spielberg is a master at his craft.
823332944374861824 2017-01-22 00:54:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Mixed Nuts Productions channel and @LivingIn8Bits are the most subscribed to, most watched videos in history, period. #alternativefacts
823239771967410176 2017-01-22 18:43:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@KOConnorJr Hope you've been practicing your @LivingIn8Bits Zig Zags to prepare.pic.twitter.com/nzbVkT0J9r
823232971658448898 2017-01-22 18:16:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Awesome that @springsteen offers archive concerts. Hope to see my first Bruce show on there some day. Best ever. http://live.brucespringsteen.net/
823231827678785537 2017-01-22 18:12:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @springsteen Today is definitely a day where the music of Bruce @Springsteen is needed. Listening to an archive concert from last year.
823203341048180736 2017-01-22 16:19:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I felt the same way when my coworkers told me that they thought I was in my mid 20s. I felt good about myself then.
823195841183776770 2017-01-22 15:49:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going to need a lot of distractions going forward.
823195055125045248 2017-01-22 15:46:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the news this morning just hurts my head. It's only been 2 days. Is this really what the next 4 years will be?
823028574659706880 2017-01-21 04:44:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That was an awesome monologue by @azizansari on SNL.
822895214964699136 2017-01-21 19:54:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Remember that the next major federal election is the 2018 midterms. Remember to vote in 2018, not just 2020. It is extremely important.
822865000268238850 2017-01-21 17:54:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Awesome to see the massive crowds marching today. Be safe, be diligent, and be heard.

822591771226021895 2017-01-20 23:48:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 Mine was Tombstone pizza. Delicious.
822583047858044929 2017-01-20 23:14:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm making pizza too! Def feels like a pizza night.pic.twitter.com/8JxLFLIQNq
822505349907357699 2017-01-20 18:05:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Final episode of Girl Meets World today. Man, what a gut punch of a day.
822490722305789952 2017-01-20 17:07:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel a great disturbance in the Force.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKu7TYWNxqA
822477955322540033 2017-01-20 16:16:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 @UrzasRage All any of us can do is be resilient and diligent.
822465786207932416 2017-01-20 15:28:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Today is a dark, dark day for America. It is going to be a long 4 years. May be watching movies or playing video games all day.
822272709300256769 2017-01-19 02:41:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A sincere thank you to President @BarackObama for your service to the country.
822259835580350468 2017-01-19 01:49:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Good Place. Well, that was a twist I didn't see coming.
822108327551401984 2017-01-19 15:47:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Note to self, don't ever give a dissenting opinion to the Power Rangers movie. Me comparing the busy designs to Transformers is blasphemy. 
821777597348646914 2017-01-18 17:53:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Saw this at Target earlier. That's creepy.pic.twitter.com/V8qT1DLYCI
821557356442042368 2017-01-17 03:18:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm always ridiculously impressed by cosplayers and their costumes. It's amazing how good cosplayers are at it.
821436765068230657 2017-01-17 19:19:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was never a big fan of Space Jam, even when it came out. I have more nostalgia for classic Looney Tunes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKnnThTfNY
821391502454747136 2017-01-17 16:19:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> ICYMI, check out the Ghostheads Music Video from yesterday! It was really fun making a Ghostbusters themed video!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMoBU9rrIhw
821099178965237761 2017-01-16 20:57:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Years of packing film gear into trucks and cars have made me a master packer at Tetris-ing my parents' Christmas stuff.pic.twitter.com/4vekciBsT5
821050001262608388 2017-01-16 17:42:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GhostheadsMovie @honahleemusic @alysonf78 Thanks! Glad you dug it!
821020487014875138 2017-01-16 15:45:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I Directed, Shot, and Edited the @honahleemusic music video for @GhostheadsMovie. Check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMoBU9rrIhwpic.twitter.com/KBs5gMoblt
820697203333275649 2017-01-15 18:20:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's always fun when people who don't know a thing about me like to assume everything about me.
820645064942714880 2017-01-15 14:53:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa @alli90 I love that Link was added to Mario Kart in 8. That makes me so happy. The Wii U had good games. It's a shame.
820421734658621445 2017-01-14 00:05:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also, how much more talented can Ryan Gosling even get? It's somewhat unfair how good he is. I also wish I could look that good in a suit.
820419888401567744 2017-01-14 23:58:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Really liked La La Land. Great callbacks to classic Hollywood musicals. The stuff that's good is really good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWhKWhFWoc
820351127472537600 2017-01-14 19:25:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've recently created a library of @LivingIn8Bits GIFs. They've come in handy lately.https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/820350824450838528
820342785064767488 2017-01-14 18:52:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ShadyJay1908 @JayHooft I wanted the Master Edition as well. I preordered Special.
820117013792256000 2017-01-13 03:55:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That said, I have a preorder in for it just so I have a reservation while I mull over whether I want the console or not. Can always cancel.
820116893520502784 2017-01-13 03:54:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have no desire to see the Nintendo Switch fail at all. I want it to be a super success. Just don't think it's a rush out and get system.
819999519215681536 2017-01-13 20:08:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm conflicted. There's a part of me that wants to get the Nintendo Switch, but nothing about the console has sold me on getting it yet.
819778841891614721 2017-01-12 05:31:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Squarepainter @mikeke352 Only game I'd want to play is Zelda and it's coming out on the Wii U, so I'll just play it there instead.
819778552253947905 2017-01-12 05:30:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That being said, I preordered it on the Wii U since I already own the system and nothing about the Switch makes me want to buy right away.
819778146224336896 2017-01-12 05:28:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I always give Zelda games the benefit of the doubt and the new trailer looked great.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw47_q9wbBE
819776869553704960 2017-01-12 05:23:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian I've preordered for the Wii U as well. The Switch hasn't sold me yet. I'm not all that excited.
819772965990506497 2017-01-12 05:08:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But I'll likely play it on my Wii U as opposed to rushing out to get a Switch. And there lies the problem with the Switch Presentation.
819772801137582080 2017-01-12 05:07:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ok, so that Breath of the Wild trailer actually looked good. The past few have been so meh. I hope it rocks. I love me some Zelda.
819772273745760256 2017-01-12 05:05:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm not even all that excited about Breath of the Wild, though this new trailer looks far more promising than past.
819772046297088000 2017-01-12 05:04:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Squarepainter @mikeke352 It feels like they will suffer with a small launch library. There's nothing that says we must buy right away.
819770405661523970 2017-01-12 04:57:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm not sold on the Switch. I can't explain why, but nothing about this has made me at all think I need to buy this Day 1 or even Year 1.
819767350274703360 2017-01-12 04:45:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sega presenting at a Nintendo console presentation. Never would've thought it.
819765350107676672 2017-01-12 04:37:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Judging by my twitter feed, I seem to be the only person who did not like the teaser for Super Mario Odyssey.
819764697180307456 2017-01-12 04:35:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Even this new Mario game looks like a yawn. What's with the cityscape stuff? Doesn't really fit. I wish there was Mario Galaxy 3 instead.
819764184279826432 2017-01-12 04:33:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey It's been Smash Bros for me. Having a paid online service though for the Switch worries me.
819763667331874817 2017-01-12 04:31:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I played Splatoon a lot when it came out, but haven't much since.
819763264229928960 2017-01-12 04:29:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, another Splatoon. Guess that was to be expected.
819762636392951815 2017-01-12 04:26:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, we've seen the Joy Cons and 2 games and I'm still not all that excited. I'm somewhat concerned.
819760608186875904 2017-01-12 04:18:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey It'll be like every special console controller gimmick that is eventually abandoned after launch.
819759987811553280 2017-01-12 04:16:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Man, I can't wait to play a glass pouring game.
819755948873056256 2017-01-12 04:00:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nintendo Switch Presentation starting with a literal count down. Here we go.
819752437489733633 2017-01-12 03:46:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 @SpaceKappa I dig the Wii U. Smash Bros for Wii U is fantastic. So many of the 1st party games have been great on it.
819726687487332352 2017-01-12 02:04:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Oh, and my windows are open. In January.
819726151916617728 2017-01-12 02:01:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Two days ago it was 8 degrees with snow and ice on the ground. Today, it was up near 70 with all the snow gone in January. Think about that.
819716901614063616 2017-01-12 01:25:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil But hey, tonight's presentation may talk about launch titles and that may sell it. We'll see. I still play my Wii U a lot.
819716052179419137 2017-01-12 01:21:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil I have not gotten a new Nintendo console at launch since the original NES. I guess keeps me from being disappointed.
819715340510838789 2017-01-12 01:19:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil I know, me a  Nintendo fanboy not excited about a new Nintendo console. I'm not even excited about Zelda. What's wrong with me?
819709242953310208 2017-01-12 00:54:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here's hoping the Nintendo Switch event tonight makes us excited. I've been very lukewarm about the Switch since it was announced.
819664377720803329 2017-01-12 21:56:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What President Obama just did for Vice President Biden was amazing and much deserved.
819357609052565506 2017-01-11 01:37:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I ask again with absolute sincerely? How can anybody condone Donald Trump's petulant behavior? Why is it excusable?
819015467906060290 2017-01-10 02:57:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm really going to miss him. #ObamaFarewell
819011088557735936 2017-01-10 02:40:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm going to really miss watching a Presidential address that features dignity, class, humility, compassion, and intelligent thought.
819000229982834689 2017-01-10 01:57:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Please check out @pxlsicle's gofundme. He's an absolute sweet heart and a friend of Living in 8 Bits. https://www.gofundme.com/ians-medical-help
818997079586566144 2017-01-10 01:44:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I TYPE IN ALL CAPS SO THAT MEANS MY THOUGHTS ARE WELL THOUGHT OUT AND RATIONAL. ALL ARE WRONG EXCEPT ME! CAPS CAPS CAPS UPPERCASE CAPS!!!!!
818611063075770370 2017-01-09 00:11:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want to know with absolute sincerity why the consistent petulance of Trump is excusable? Why is his behavior OK? Why are standards gone?
818306733005307904 2017-01-08 04:01:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seeing Sylvester Stallone and Carl Weathers together again brings me so much geeky joy.
818299418134900737 2017-01-08 03:32:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This was amazing. Meryl Streep wins all.https://twitter.com/DanRather/status/818299103725703169
818294716680826880 2017-01-08 03:13:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Meryl Streep is an American treasure as well as a New Jersey treasure.
818285374791368705 2017-01-08 02:36:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thor and Wonder Woman on the same stage. Curious how many out there think that is comic book blasphemy.
818259775884558336 2017-01-08 00:55:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going to kick back and enjoy the Golden Globes tonight before having to rest up for another exhausting week ahead.

818149245572317184 2017-01-08 17:35:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @CoryBooker Especially for freelancers/contractors like myself and others working in the film/video industry. We benefit greatly from ACA.
817965133603491840 2017-01-07 05:24:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Though I fully admit that I shouldn't get hung up over criticisms I've also given myself to the film that I made going on 8 years ago.
817963831687344128 2017-01-07 05:19:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> They always say don't read the comments, but I do. I often must resist the urge to respond. https://youtu.be/JFrEO0nqNsQpic.twitter.com/tJW4aKcrIU

817873889221087232 2017-01-07 23:21:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @NJRetro1 @cwr2 I've never gotten that much game wise at Magfest, but have gotten great shirts, collectibles, art stuff, etc. before.
817868202210426884 2017-01-07 22:59:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finished shoveling the snow. Body is saying "I hate you." Stomach is saying "Feed me."
817571025181351936 2017-01-06 03:18:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I only personally got to go to 2014 and 2015, but they were both great. Timing wasn't great this year sadly. I miss everyone.
817565067633954817 2017-01-06 02:54:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My first trip to Magfest was one of the coolest and most memorable cons I've ever gone to. Missing all the good people there.https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/817564623830478848
817473655441682432 2017-01-06 20:51:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm apparently not great at reading signs.pic.twitter.com/Q5XRk1NHWo
817470339877847040 2017-01-06 20:38:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's always great when the end of the week film days wrap early. Body is wiped out. Going to crash before I get to do it all again next week
817176681911844867 2017-01-05 01:11:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> By relief, do you mean take away the access to health care that I and many of my colleagues have?https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/816672335310692353
816860297159962624 2017-01-04 04:14:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees That was one of the dumber scenes. The movie was a general mess. I'm surprised there aren't Entrancess hula hoop gifs out there.
816849237757620224 2017-01-04 03:30:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also, what was with the extremely bizarre Enchantress dance? The whole movie made so little sense.
816843645441757184 2017-01-04 03:07:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally watched Suicide Squad. Yeah...... Also, can there be a movie climax without some kind of sky portal? So many sky beams nowadays.
816088386809303041 2017-01-02 01:06:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Cape Feare episode of The Simpsons is on right now. Such a classic episode.

815724607047172096 2017-01-01 01:01:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ate a steak dinner. Stuffed. Now in pajama pants and ready to watch the Mummers Fancy Brigades.
815707323922599936 2017-01-01 23:52:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Mmmmmm, filet.
815679113562386436 2017-01-01 22:00:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Speaking of which, the film is available to view on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFrEO0nqNsQ as well as most of my work athttp://youtube.com/MixedNutsProductions
815677947344461824 2017-01-01 21:55:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So this is cool! Oscar Winner @Paul_Haggis liked my post on Instagram about No Footing reaching 25k views. So giddy! https://www.instagram.com/p/BOm67qTDUlz/?taken-by=livingin8bitspic.twitter.com/D5jH3VmD7E

815065264127700993 2016-12-30 05:21:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've probably listened to How Far I'll Go from Moana at least 20 times today. Hard to shake that tune out of your head.
815009077101260804 2016-12-30 01:38:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@Lin_Manuel conducted Moana with a Legend of Zelda shirt. I feel we would bond well over a mutual love for Zelda & Weird Al. @LivingIn8Bitspic.twitter.com/0gjDQnscQN
814974222372130816 2016-12-30 23:19:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil There was a little girl, 3 or 4 years old, singing along with every word next to me. It was adorable.
814973822369677313 2016-12-30 23:17:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Saw Moana today finally and really liked it. I love Disney animated films. Been humming How Far I'll Go since.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPAbx5kgCJo
814506161063989248 2016-12-29 16:19:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Amazed that my feature film No Footing has over 25,000 views. So happy that the film is still finding its audience.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFrEO0nqNsQ
814494362881183744 2016-12-29 15:32:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So when I or others refer to 2016 as a bad year, we're not blaming it on the calendar, but simply stating that 2016 wasn't a positive year.
814494178361143298 2016-12-29 15:31:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Reflecting on 2016 as a whole hasn't been a positive one for many people personally, creative heroes passing away, and that awful election.
814493939755577344 2016-12-29 15:31:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But this is the time of year when one reflects on the previous while heading into the New Year.
814493804988395521 2016-12-29 15:30:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I fully understand that the year 2016 isn't personally killing off beloved people or causing such awful things to happen.
814359038053978112 2016-12-28 06:34:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That moment when you realize you don't own Singin' in the Rain and intend to rectify first thing in the morning to honor Debbie Reynolds.
814294629034131456 2016-12-28 02:19:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I couldn't even begin to imagine the sorrow, pain, and loss that the Reynolds/Fisher family is experiencing right now.
814288124201275392 2016-12-28 01:53:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Debbie Reynolds now, also? So sad. 2016 has been a heartbreaking year all around.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu4v5hB1dKk
814185157733261313 2016-12-28 19:04:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Empire Strikes Back is absolutely the best Star Wars movie. It is just such a well made film across all facets of filmmaking.
814148358147342339 2016-12-28 16:37:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing says maturity and leadership like tweeting a "NOT!" reference.
813958746015760384 2016-12-27 04:04:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watched the original Star Wars tonight in honor of Carrie Fisher. Makes me want to go through Empire, Jedi, and Force Awakens now.
813841147663618051 2016-12-27 20:17:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I remember watching this years ago. Really shows how incredibly quick witted and funny Carrie Fisher was.https://youtu.be/PGEMwtj68FQ
813838985759981569 2016-12-27 20:08:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan Just let it go, man. I lost it once I listened to the beautiful John Williams theme.
813827991902056448 2016-12-27 19:24:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "No matter how I go, I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra." - Carrie Fisher
813825319119503361 2016-12-27 19:14:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I listened to this beautiful theme written and conducted by John Williams and cried. Rest in peace, dear Princess.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoMfL2MYIa8
813816601728401409 2016-12-27 18:39:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This one hurts a lot.
813812971877138432 2016-12-27 18:25:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 2016 is one of the worst years imaginable. It cannot come to an end soon enough, though 2017 doesn't look much brighter....
813812654154321921 2016-12-27 18:23:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Absolutely heartbroken. Words cannot describe the impact Star Wars has had on me and my life. Rest in peace, dear Princess.pic.twitter.com/HheuvvWJtV

811771084081078274 2016-12-21 03:11:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 Thanks!
811747627826106368 2016-12-21 01:38:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great way to cap off a delicious birthday dinner.pic.twitter.com/78IOG4VDZA
811697232290476036 2016-12-21 22:17:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @toxicradiolive @CinescapeCast Thank you!
811445917702361088 2016-12-20 05:39:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt But also worth noting that the less you know going in, the more enjoyable it is. I loved it.
811445316973170688 2016-12-20 05:36:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt The whole movie is very good and worth watching in full. I've only seen it once, but many reviewers note 2nd time is better.
811044065038962688 2016-12-19 03:02:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey Turns out Philly area comedian Joe Conklin beat us to it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-Auao3WPAk
810993828068986880 2016-12-19 23:42:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trump will soon be in the Hall of Presidents in Disney World. Think about that.....
810985956916547584 2016-12-19 23:11:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, for the second time in the past five elections and my adulthood, the person who lost the popular vote will become President. Yeah....
810714397521956865 2016-12-18 05:12:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, you're the Charlie Browniest.
810702590791024642 2016-12-18 04:25:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ERP2009 That's a bleak sci-fi interpretation of a Dr Seus fantasy. But I guess, what exactly are The Who's to begin with.
810701048608329728 2016-12-18 04:19:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching Mickey's Christmas Carol and it is so bizarre hearing Goofy's voice in that weird period between Pinto Colvig and Bill Farmer.
810697658801291265 2016-12-18 04:05:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm actually curious. Why does Cindy Lou Who have a pair of antennae on her head?
810695822702678016 2016-12-18 03:58:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's amazing how accurate "You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch" still is if you replace one word: "Grinch" with "Trump."
810286554409267201 2016-12-17 00:52:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It feels like he is so insecure that he needs them to feed his ego maniacal desires with immediate adulation. #smallhands
810245505783578624 2016-12-17 22:09:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In all seriousness, why is Trump still holding rallies? What is the purpose? Who is paying for it? Aren't there more important things to do?
810232236725374976 2016-12-17 21:16:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Current historical context definitely changes how a lot of movies are viewed. Casablanca a good example. But yes, evil....
810231761418518531 2016-12-17 21:14:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Never realized one of the VHS tapes on the player in Home Alone was a Bruce Springsteen tape.pic.twitter.com/nH9rYOkUpF
810220798850060289 2016-12-17 20:31:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Home Alone 2 is considerably less enjoyable now because of a 5 second cameo where context and perception has dramatically changed recently.
810154235178471424 2016-12-17 16:06:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A true Christmas miracle and small saviing grace of 2016 would be the Electoral College voting to make Trump "unpresidented" on Monday.
810153567134814210 2016-12-17 16:03:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf Not even political norms. It's basic adult maturity and human decency he is ignoring.
810142048280072193 2016-12-17 15:18:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Is it too much to ask the future President of the United States to have basic English, Grammar, and Spelling skills? #unpresidented
810139133544984578 2016-12-17 15:06:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GeorgeTakei Don't forget the time he had 3 spelling errors in one when he wanted to call Hillary a "lose cannon."https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/759191265988653056
810005803549724672 2016-12-16 06:16:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love video games, but I sometimes really hate playing against other gamers online. Some of them just act like such arrogant pricks.
809949891392835584 2016-12-16 02:34:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @dwarfbeard I ordered lunch or dinner from this deli at least twice a week. Since it closed in February, I've felt lost. Was a mile away.
809937618259607552 2016-12-16 01:45:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> If you've never gotten a chance to see it, do so. It is a beautiful and incredible film.
809923795393937408 2016-12-16 00:50:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching Joyeux Noel. Such an incredible movie about the true story of the WWI truce on Christmas.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424205/
809886435411193856 2016-12-16 22:22:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> An awesome deli near me all my life closed back in February. Since then, I've been in a constant state of food grief. What do I want to eat?
809809742734524421 2016-12-16 17:17:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Force is with me and I am one with The Force. #RogueOne
809632715335172096 2016-12-15 05:34:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It felt like the first Star Wars movie that really dealt with the aspect of war, the moral ambiguity of the alliance, and sacrifices taken.
809632576272998400 2016-12-15 05:33:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Loved #RogueOne! Great addition to the Star Wars universe with a very different take on what you can do with it.
809587571219173376 2016-12-15 02:34:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> For the second year in a row, got my favorite Star Wars shirt on, seeing a new Star Wars movie opening night. How cool is that?! #RogueOnepic.twitter.com/BNWHSyrxw1
809460387846332416 2016-12-15 18:09:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Man, it would be so awesome to play Super Mario Run, but I do not have an iPhone.
809188331850498053 2016-12-14 00:08:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I TYPED THIS IN ALL CAPS, SO THEREFORE I AM SMARTER THAN YOU WITH A MORE VALID ARGUMENT. I AM RIGHT, YOU ARE WRONG BECAUSE IT IS IN CAPS!
808899355495321600 2016-12-13 05:00:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dang, Alan Thicke now, too. 2016 is quite possibly one of the worst years ever. I used to love Not Quite Human TV Movies with him.
808875574697611264 2016-12-13 03:25:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just my luck/timing. I would be the first car behind the police closure of the bridge.pic.twitter.com/HJpO3FfXxJ
808446466721218562 2016-12-12 23:00:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Making an effort to use the rowing machine now at least 4 days a week. My body has not been ready.
808101019783667712 2016-12-11 00:07:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In happier news, we released the @LoreleyReed Don't Look Back music video a year ago today.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi9qyLzAVMQ
808088976959688704 2016-12-11 23:20:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It doesn't matter if I have zero knowledge in a particular field with no prior experience because "you know, I'm, like, a smart person."
808088518291558400 2016-12-11 23:18:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> From now on, I'm going to dismiss any information from anyone more educated on a subject than I am because "I'm, like, a smart person."

807812812693274624 2016-12-10 05:02:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I hope we get to see one more appearance of @TheRock Obama on @nbcsnl before President @BarackObama leaves office. That would be amazing.pic.twitter.com/6bdG4Vgrb5
807803739096698880 2016-12-10 04:26:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very curious what SNL is going to do tonight.
807360439311073280 2016-12-09 23:05:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm continually amazed by how good the CGI is in the Planet of the Apes reboots. Something to behold.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEP1Mk6Un98
807092416109047809 2016-12-08 05:20:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Spider-Man Trailer looks pretty good, though may be relying a little too heavily on Tony Stark. Can it stand on its own?
806978182641582081 2016-12-08 21:46:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Godspeed, John Glenn.

806733418046197760 2016-12-07 05:33:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Miyamoto with a guitar playing the Mario theme with The Roots on @FallonTonight was awesome!
806731761044463617 2016-12-07 05:26:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seeing Miyamoto on The Tonight Show is great. I want to hang out with him. He's so cool.
806708389233487877 2016-12-07 03:54:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> #HairsprayLive was a good production. I'm glad there's been a trend to continue these live event musicals for TV. Hope it continues.
806706369525088256 2016-12-07 03:46:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You Can't Stop The Beat is always a great Broadway showstopper song. #HairsprayLive
806700823786950656 2016-12-07 03:23:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Jennifer Hudson has a hell of a voice. #HairsprayLive
806698832541126656 2016-12-07 03:16:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The film/theater tech side of me is always looking at the tech/production end of these live broadcasts. #HairsprayLive
806695328988721152 2016-12-07 03:02:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> He's going to call out and dox every person who dares disagrees with him, sicking his minions on them. Petty and petulant.
806689576391741441 2016-12-07 02:39:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt Part of the issue is that it gave voices to characters that never had voices before, so it didn't meet preconceived notions.
806688225775468544 2016-12-07 02:33:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I feel like I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed Metroid: Other M.
806684841680965632 2016-12-07 02:20:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been enjoying #HairsprayLive, but I was somewhat bothered by how the rules of dodgeball were bent in that previous scene.
806680660148686849 2016-12-07 02:03:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This sums up how I feel fairly well.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/806673882228867072
806680304878579712 2016-12-07 02:02:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is extremely important. Trump is a thin skinned, narcissistic bully who is a loose cannon and it frightens me to no end.https://twitter.com/CNN/status/806674300254175232
806679775599349760 2016-12-07 02:00:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @kimhornz There feels like a great deal of "too soon" throughout Hairspray. It's oddly relevant, more than ever, now.
806673828877320192 2016-12-07 01:36:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> #HairsprayLive has been pretty good so far. It's feel more relevant now than ever considering the current political climate.
806660117789818887 2016-12-07 00:42:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So, umm, something tells me that having a new game show called The Wall is a really poor choice in the current American climate. Just sayin.
806614100042272771 2016-12-07 21:39:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've never watched PewDiePie videos. Seriously. I can't think of ever watching more than 2 minutes of one. I feel like I'm out of touch.
806613190952026114 2016-12-07 21:35:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alysonf78 The only one that I recognized/subscribed to that wasn't a mainstream celebrity was Andre.
806599738040733703 2016-12-07 20:42:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I did not recognize about 90% of the people in the YouTube Rewind video. I think I'm getting old.
805983390881185792 2016-12-05 03:53:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino I can't sufficiently express my distaste for the it all in 140 characters or less.
805979263635693570 2016-12-05 03:36:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's supposed to be a degree of levity and fun to these movies. Yet the new Mummy and Transformers just seem bleak, depressing, and dull.
805978954381348864 2016-12-05 03:35:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Remember when Transformers was just a goofy, silly series about cars that transformed into alien robots? Yeah....https://twitter.com/transformers/status/805971507566387200
805969594649288705 2016-12-05 02:58:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The new Mummy movie looks stupid. What made the original so fun was the period piece, playful, Indiana Jones style movie. This looks dumb.
805626736968892416 2016-12-04 04:15:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So how about that Westworld finale?
805612595260620800 2016-12-04 03:19:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Paul Ryan's response to Trump tweeting falsehoods, incorrect statements, etc.: "He won the election. Who cares?" Well, I care, Mr. Speaker.
805528369060343808 2016-12-04 21:45:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A lot of talk about YouTube subscription issues lately, which I feel has been reflected in our video view counts lately.https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/805527364033802242

805444682956279808 2016-12-04 16:12:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 Indeed! Several of the kids had lightsabers instead of candles. It was cute.
805442901928984577 2016-12-04 16:05:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dan Rather had another great commentary about it on Facebook. Worth following if you haven't.
805442322032893952 2016-12-04 16:03:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The funny thing is that the sketch was about Trump's inability to control his tweet impulse. He responds by impulse tweeting.
805435129426571265 2016-12-04 15:34:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> From the St. Nicholas celebration last night at my church. Always the start of the Christmas season for me. 13 years I've run tech for it.pic.twitter.com/p4CRgXILQH

804535751060975616 2016-12-01 04:00:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 My N64 hasn't been turned on much since the 3DS remakes also, though I only played Majora on 3DS (which I hated). NES is my fave.
804534422833864704 2016-12-01 03:55:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I had the NES since initial release, so both Zelda's were fixtures for us. My gold original Zelda is 5 Screw. No SNES, though.
804533304364036099 2016-12-01 03:51:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I love the originals. May be nostalgia driven affection, but the NES ones are the ones I never tire of.
804532753496702976 2016-12-01 03:48:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 It was great fun playing again, although a tad easy. I just replayed the originals on the NES Classic. Still my favorites of all.
804532135067533312 2016-12-01 03:46:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I haven't played through Wind Waker, despite owning the GC version. May have to get WW HD and give a whirl.
804531542181769216 2016-12-01 03:44:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 It had great story, characters, & gameplay. I had fun playing it and was a great final battle. I just replayed Twilight Princess.
804531190283829248 2016-12-01 03:42:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I like a good story driven Zelda with good characters. Skyward Sword had the best, most fleshed out Princess Zelda to me.
804529975911215105 2016-12-01 03:37:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 That's the thing, I never wanted or felt like Zelda needed to be "changed up." I had great fun playing Skyward Sword. I was fine.
804529340465709057 2016-12-01 03:35:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I love Ocarina of Time & Twilight Princess. Hard to say which is my favorite. I like Skyward Sword also. Hated Majora's Mask.
804528371996721152 2016-12-01 03:31:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Another Breath of the Wild preview that yet again doesn't make me at all excited about the game. I'm sensing quite a let down soon.
804505270260998144 2016-12-01 01:59:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every preview I've seen, the world just looks too vast, empty, and dare I say it --  boring. Don't know, just making me not want to play it.
804503751927169025 2016-12-01 01:53:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I haven't played Skyrim, so that aspect doesn't phase me. But yes, it does look empty and dare I say it -- boring.
804502995782266880 2016-12-01 01:50:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love Zelda games, but I feel like I am the only person on the planet who is not all that excited about Breath of the Wild. Am I alone?
804369057269116928 2016-12-01 16:58:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yup. They're on a very short leash....
804368320279482368 2016-12-01 16:55:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The biggest wake up call will be if they gut medicare/medicaid the way they want to. That will change their tune very fast.
804367662239383553 2016-12-01 16:52:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The only solace I can take is that as the popular vote margin grows, it confirms that the majority of Americans don't like it.
804366016088260619 2016-12-01 16:46:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My head has been in a constant state of hurt since watching both of these last night.
804182328834723840 2016-11-30 04:36:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trevor Noah just showed incredible restraint during that interview on The Daily Show just now.
804162474975043584 2016-11-30 03:17:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got my ticket for Rogue One. At there's something to look forward to coming up.
804043127245967360 2016-11-30 19:23:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been incredibly productive all day, editing like a machine. Wrapped up and rendering out, feeling exhausted and it is not even 2:30. How!?
803667044436680704 2016-11-29 18:28:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Was invited to participate in the Nielsen ratings, but I'm ineligible since I & many I know work in the Radio, TV, and Film industry. Dang..
803470477230534657 2016-11-28 05:27:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> One would think someone elected President would have more important things to do than troll people they don't like on Twitter. #petulant
803456274662879232 2016-11-28 04:31:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm about done with you, 2016. You started off promising, but overall have been a gigantic pile of stupid.

802970125628489729 2016-11-27 20:19:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I just received an email about Magfest registration and that I'm a panelist. I never put in for it though. Wasn't planning to go to Magfest.

802318861978611712 2016-11-25 01:11:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Best part of NES Classic is the save states. I could never beat Castlevania before and needed to save state the hell out of it to beat it.
802232988620746753 2016-11-25 19:30:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Montana and Rice's 49ers dominate Elway's Broncos 42-14 for the Tecmo Bowl Championship. #NESClassicpic.twitter.com/REIWDF8Ax4

801580716911955969 2016-11-23 00:18:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy I got my Wii at midnight on Smash Bros Brawl launch night and karma was on my side that night.

801081017163358208 2016-11-22 15:12:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I got my @GhostheadsMovie DVD over the weekend. I directed the @honahleemusic Music Video on it.

800367646361419776 2016-11-20 15:58:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Somebody patting themselves on the back for settling a fraud lawsuit for $25 million, claiming victory clearly has no grasp of reality.
800208904730935296 2016-11-19 05:27:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Best joke on SNL about Trump costing taxpayers millions: "It's all worth it so a billionaire can go night night in his big boy bed."
800128863426715652 2016-11-19 00:09:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going to relax & watch Independence Day: Resurgence and eat ice cream because the past 2 weeks haven't been depressing enough in the world.
800064113317539840 2016-11-19 19:52:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Saw this and think it sums up a response to Trump's definition of "harassment." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk
799998414356217856 2016-11-19 15:30:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'd say this was more eloquently worded than rude. But Trump will be the President of Twitter tantrums and rants.https://twitter.com/HamiltonMusical/status/799828567941120000
799805318163206145 2016-11-18 02:43:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I guess it's a good thing just about everyone I work with thinks I'm about 5 years younger than I actually am.
799691166337945604 2016-11-18 19:10:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great video by @GamingHistorian about The Super Mario Bros movie. I've always had a soft spot for this "so bad, it's great" guilty pleasure.https://twitter.com/GamingHistorian/status/799681234695843841

798715575019208704 2016-11-15 02:33:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, the new live action Beauty and the Beast trailer is making me sit and watch the original animated film. My favorite animated film.

797661866885582849 2016-11-12 04:46:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And then Dave Chappelle's monologue to follow it up. SNL was spot on so far.
797660602458062848 2016-11-12 04:41:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That opening on SNL was unexpected, yet sobering and important. Kate McKinnon's performance gave me chills. I was choked up.
797574481413885952 2016-11-12 22:59:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> We're about to go on the @CinescapeCast at 6pm to talk @LivingIn8Bits. Listen live at http://toxicradio.net/metalpic.twitter.com/DlMxMdytQ2
797500611059220480 2016-11-12 18:05:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Curious if the demand and short supply of the NES Classic will bring down the costs of the original since scalping prices are higher now.
797499517239169024 2016-11-12 18:01:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I want one..... :-(
797450343927992320 2016-11-12 14:45:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sfurze76 Awesome if he succeeded. Just sad that it has to be that way. We should be able to just walk in and get one.
797293526140784640 2016-11-11 04:22:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No NES Classic today. My original NES will stand in fine then for tonight.pic.twitter.com/neuMiWsbmn
797249101708591104 2016-11-11 01:26:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Why set up the Nintendo Powerline and do the whole #NESterday promotion when not enough units of the #NESClassicEdition were produced?
797221632205012992 2016-11-11 23:37:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 @NESpayne You need to rewind those Nintender Tapes.
797210198351945729 2016-11-11 22:51:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This NES Classic debacle has sincerely made an already awful horrific week worse (though yes, the earlier event was no doubt far, far worse)
797209841534177280 2016-11-11 22:50:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @AlphaOmegaSin It baffles me how there was zero foresight into this. How could they be so ignorant to the demand?
797201583259971584 2016-11-11 22:17:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't know, there's a different between being careful and retailers getting literally under 10 unites total on LAUNCH DAY.
797201358596308992 2016-11-11 22:16:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan I'm already in a salty mood this week and this is certainly not making it any better. I shouldn't have to hunt this stuff down.
797201069390565376 2016-11-11 22:15:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I definitely saw that, but how could they be so ignorant to not anticipate demand? I'm tired of this excuse. It was obvious.
797200757917421568 2016-11-11 22:14:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @jnkaufman I'm really fed up with this short changing suppliers strategy.
797200674333331456 2016-11-11 22:13:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It is absolutely ridiculous. How couldn't they anticipate the demand? The excitement over it couldn't have been more obvious.
797199708984844288 2016-11-11 22:09:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've had the @amazon page loaded in my browser for 2 hours and refreshed at 5 and saw it. Seriously @NintendoAmerica, this is not right.
797199365588865026 2016-11-11 22:08:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Had the NES Classic page on @amazon there, clicked Add to Cart and took me to a page that said "Cart is empty." This is ridiculous.
797127323497668608 2016-11-11 17:22:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nintendo is saying they will have more stock, but didn't anticipate demand. Everyone seemed to know the demand but the company.
797116287545708544 2016-11-11 16:38:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Do no pay scalper prices for the NES Classic. It will be available again. Just really a shame it couldn't be easier on launch day for once.
797107936573161472 2016-11-11 16:05:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan I went to 4 stores this morning in close proximity and called a few others. Just going to wait until 5 EST on Amazon at this point
797106999712481281 2016-11-11 16:01:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan What burns me about it is that they knew it would be in high demand. They didn't anticipate how popular amiibos would be at first.
797106873895964672 2016-11-11 16:01:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan I understand supply and demand, but they short change themselves in the process by making it so scalpers take advantage.
797106061648031744 2016-11-11 15:57:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan You'd think they would've wised up by now. They knew demand would be high based on reactions to the announcement.
797101756694069248 2016-11-11 15:40:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nintendo has once again screwed up by shortchanging suppliers with the NES Classic when demand was known well in advance.
796391601245327360 2016-11-09 16:38:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel like we all need a good laugh today. I put together a couple Super Plumber Bros outtakes to add some much needed levity today.https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/796391200760745985
796295798325727232 2016-11-09 10:18:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been lying in bed unable to sleep all night. I have never been more disappointed, saddened, angry, and downright terrified in my life.
796222844631973888 2016-11-08 05:28:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Stock Market is also crashing. The Futures Market literally halted due to hitting the "automatic brake." Think about that.
796221231859191808 2016-11-08 05:21:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Please America, flip the Senate. Give us hope.
796204719551250432 2016-11-08 04:16:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I sincerely cannot fathom this. This is like a nightmare that you cannot wake up from right now.
796190884878553088 2016-11-08 03:21:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been editing for most of the day to try to keep my mind off this. But It's getting harder to concentrate. I am sincerely terrified.
796184426891935745 2016-11-08 02:55:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 My state (New Jersey) isn't messing up and my neighbor/2nd home Pennsylvania is doing its part. Elsewhere, I'm shaking.....
796182772763205632 2016-11-08 02:49:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I'm more terrified that the joke is just only beginning.....

795649508742991877 2016-11-07 15:29:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Does Hallmark channel realize the irony in airing a movie in early November where the character laments the commercialization of Christmas?
795464855771811840 2016-11-06 03:16:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @thegamechasers I always spelled Oscar Mayer wrong. I even have a weenie whistle and truck and still swore it was spelled differently.
795463299508867072 2016-11-06 03:10:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @thegamechasers Actually mentioned in this list on Buzzfeed.https://www.buzzfeed.com/christopherhudspeth/crazy-examples-of-the-mandela-effect-that-will-make-you-ques?utm_term=.pnPb2rq7l#.xtZbkL29z
795459837236801537 2016-11-06 02:56:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Die in real life, please." Add that to the list of obscene/angry things opposing Smash Bros players have said to me. Maturity.
795436507054174208 2016-11-06 01:23:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I'm wondering if any of them are doing midnight releases. Many Walmarts are 24 hours.

795301843106729984 2016-11-06 16:28:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sounds like a Simpsons campaign commercial. https://youtu.be/Vey7GKNpl4Q
795297831481442305 2016-11-06 16:12:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Hillary Clinton only cares about money, power, and herself." That is from a commercial promoting Trump. Think about that for a moment...
795289091369762816 2016-11-06 15:37:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's football Sunday and I'm watching 2 Sunday morning news shows instead of football pregame shows. I hate this election.
795108890023170053 2016-11-05 03:41:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You know things are dire when SNL needs to just break character with the sketch and implore everyone to vote wisely.

794185377049350144 2016-11-03 14:32:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Proof that I've been wearing geeky Nintendo shirts since I was a kid. Though Mario seemed more maniacally violent in the earlier days. #tbtpic.twitter.com/SkEIXHrW1j
794045929515089920 2016-11-02 05:17:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How does one sleep tonight?
794039075619618816 2016-11-02 04:50:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What a great World Series! Amazing to watch! Some of the best sports I've ever watched. Wow!
794024680604712960 2016-11-02 03:53:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Man, there is nothing like postseason baseball. This is one of the most amazing series I've ever seen. So awesome!
793993968375701504 2016-11-02 01:51:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I bet @PixelDan was the culprit. He did play as Toon Link and named "Butts" during our Smash games at Magfest before.
793943311304290305 2016-11-02 22:30:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally beat Contra 4! Woot!pic.twitter.com/6uP9oLS2nV
793674915438268416 2016-11-01 04:43:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love these kinds if wins. Dude was spamming gyros and lasers on the edges, so I kept stealing the gyros. He quit out of frustration.pic.twitter.com/N9a4HkoL8w
793639279624908800 2016-11-01 02:22:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The American President is one of my favorite movies. One of the most well written, best acted, overall great entertainment films.
793639124536262656 2016-11-01 02:21:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "People want leadership, Mr. President, and in the absence of genuine leadership, they'll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone."
793614661535105024 2016-11-01 00:44:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Contra 4 is sooo hard. I completed 36 out of 40 challenges, but I can't beat the main game. I get stuck in the City Stage. So hard.....
793290005976350721 2016-10-31 03:14:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This episode of The Daily Show is great satire. The bleak dsytopian future seems like a very real reality. I'm worried about this election.
793283522865860608 2016-10-31 02:48:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love the Christmas season and am all about it. But let's get through November/Thanksgiving first before we go all in for Christmas.
793279617318649856 2016-10-31 02:32:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy I think the same company licensed all the properties in the 80s/early 90s.
793270905283735552 2016-10-31 01:58:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I can't find the photo, but I was Link for Halloween as a kid wearing this horrendously awful costume. My sword was made out of Construx.pic.twitter.com/Y5FPuJBOkj
793193983925182464 2016-10-31 20:52:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage As do I. Watching it while waiting for trick or treaters.
793192122451099648 2016-10-31 20:45:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Take note. Very important.pic.twitter.com/5QdkIDGT5i
793187618737496064 2016-10-31 20:27:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Frau Blcher horses joke in Young Frankenstein is one of my favorite running gags in movie history.
792962504293027844 2016-10-30 05:32:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Way too worked up still, so winding down so I can sleep by doing some editing. Thankfully, nothing on the docket tomorrow.
792901663522684928 2016-10-30 01:31:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No matter what opposite coast we're on, @KOConnorJr is always my football text buddy. #FlyEaglesFly

792794724038021120 2016-10-30 18:26:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I can take solace in the fact that I was able to beat someone named PooPooMan twice today.pic.twitter.com/VyrStoekl0
792580049434189829 2016-10-29 04:13:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just finished reading @springsteen's book Born to Run. Much of it resonated with me, especially the final sentences at the end. "Go tell it"pic.twitter.com/PbmTsCySCt
792507499266076672 2016-10-29 23:24:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Was great to see you for a couple days! Can't wait to do it again sometime!
791458064390029312 2016-10-26 01:54:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Secondly, I don't think I'd have the temperament to handle it. I play a lot of online 1v1 and those players tick me off with how they act.
791457882415984640 2016-10-26 01:53:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Firstly, I play with a Pro Controller instead of Gamecube, which is borderline sacrelig in the Smash Community.
791457768641335296 2016-10-26 01:53:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm a decent, maybe slightly above average Smash Bros player and friends have asked me why I don't enter tournaments.
791388317635923968 2016-10-26 21:17:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel like the blinking cursor is taunting me.
791367497916227584 2016-10-26 19:54:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PixelDan Well, I have to find that motivation now for my pal, Dan!
791365545966854144 2016-10-26 19:47:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trying to write a sketch, but having a lot of trouble getting it going. Need the motivation to get it going.
791064534756851712 2016-10-25 23:50:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got Contra 4 new and been playing it. It is unforgiving for sure. Trying to unlock stuff with challenges is a blood pressure boiler.
790691389969424384 2016-10-24 23:08:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been getting a lot of political phone calls lately. I was happy to tell the one from the NRA that they were full of shit and hung up.
790568803310723072 2016-10-24 15:01:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The lack of punctuation on this sign makes its message confusing.pic.twitter.com/jwbc8Z35Y8
790391416157528064 2016-10-23 03:16:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alexnz Zombies just never did it for me.
790388330127130624 2016-10-23 03:03:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I guess it's a good thing I've never seen a single episode of The Walking Dead.
790353315024560128 2016-10-23 00:44:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I still laugh watching our @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros episodes. All kinds of funny! Give us a share! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjiVBVaK8BU&list=PL7LLTJC5dDlEM53yBP-0LRBymWkDzWbVU&index=2

790035472638676992 2016-10-22 03:41:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want to have a beer with @tomhanks.
790027590245507072 2016-10-22 03:10:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf The amount of effort haters go through to hate is infinitely astounding. Highly motivated people, though.
790026934273048580 2016-10-22 03:07:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "It's a simple question, Doctor. Would you eat the moon if it were made of ribs?" http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/harry-caray-space-the-infinite-frontier/n11002
789299965642280960 2016-10-20 02:59:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It goes without saying that @alyankovic is a national treasure and is my childhood/life hero. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdBF6h7oH5I
789260536529711108 2016-10-20 00:22:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is a very unpopular opinion, but I've never been a big fan of Rocky Horror.
789220403621208064 2016-10-20 21:43:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel like I'm the only person who was not all that excited about the Nintendo Switch announcement. I haven't even had my Wii U 2 years.
789195972748337152 2016-10-20 20:05:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very pretty.pic.twitter.com/klNUnZCbqJ
789125745503330304 2016-10-20 15:26:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimStoeckle I just want to tell you good luck. We're all counting on you.
788948129110331392 2016-10-19 03:41:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I love the Wii. There's so many great games on it.
788947969374433280 2016-10-19 03:40:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Colbert is killing it right now.
788932798048448512 2016-10-19 02:40:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, the big positive is that we will never have to watch another debate like this again, right? Right? I hope so.....
788931926203568130 2016-10-19 02:36:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've said "Did he really just say that? He just said that" more times during these debates than ever in my life.
788928138101166080 2016-10-19 02:21:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trump: "Bernie said this & you should believe what he says." Us: "Bernie's thinks you're a moron." Trump: "Bernie should shut the hell up."
788925584126586881 2016-10-19 02:11:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt @mikeke352 I think in Delorean Time Machines there is only shotgun.
788925090641608704 2016-10-19 02:09:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I will keep you in suspense?" NO! NO! There should be no suspense! That's not how you do it! That is legitimately frightening!
788924313554460672 2016-10-19 02:06:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "You should have changed the law!" Trump has no idea how the branches of government work, does he?
788923717963309057 2016-10-19 02:04:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The most amazing thing about social media is that every time Trump says "wrong," immediately after are videos and quotes of him saying that.
788922986011078656 2016-10-19 02:01:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Look at the tape! It's true and proves it. The other tapes, they're false. Only the one tape is true.
788920909302083584 2016-10-19 01:52:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I've built all these companies and great assets, some of the best." Yup, all of the Atlantic City ones are closed and people out of work.
788920494313484288 2016-10-19 01:51:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Excuse me, my turn." The king of interrupting just said that. What an ass.
788920090179756032 2016-10-19 01:49:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trump: "They fact checked that one thing!" Everyone else: "They fact checked your many things." Trump: "They should shut the hell up."
788919248261263361 2016-10-19 01:46:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yes, Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, but it was proposed, negotiated, and agreed on by Bush. Merits or not, why does he keep bringing it up?
788916311237591040 2016-10-19 01:34:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Yeah, yeah, yeah." The response as a man who wants to be President.
788913622705577984 2016-10-19 01:23:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> He really just said that? He really just said that. Wow. #debate
788911384310329345 2016-10-19 01:15:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trump is all Sniffles and no substance.
788909711152156673 2016-10-19 01:08:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Is it me or do the cameras' white balances look off? #debates
788908876397588480 2016-10-19 01:05:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here we go. Going to eat ice cream straight out if the container tonight.
788872321851273216 2016-10-19 22:39:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Friends of mine made this great election season parody video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbkrlZuAW4

787097178917466113 2016-10-14 01:06:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Our hotel has The Book of Mormon with its Bible. Was hoping it'd be the musical since I haven't seen it yet. Sadly, just the real book.pic.twitter.com/akt1xEU2gN
787047828484919297 2016-10-14 21:49:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, a 3+ hour trip turned into a 5+ hour ride. Finally where I need to be. Now if only had food.
787024480237387776 2016-10-14 20:17:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Feel like this is an Old Man Zelda clue. One of many musings while stuck in awful traffic in Connecticut.pic.twitter.com/lMScTSNhq3
787010186548576256 2016-10-14 19:20:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Smooth sailing thru New Jersey and little bit of New York. Once get to Connecticut, bumper to bumper stopped traffic. Sigh....
786782593555374080 2016-10-13 04:16:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> To bring my 3DS to @RetroWorldExpo or not to bring my 3DS to RetroWorld? That is the question.
786730391549927428 2016-10-13 00:48:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm excited for Rogue One and loved the first 2 trailers. This one not as excited. But still stoked. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC9abcLLQpI
786729250837688320 2016-10-13 00:44:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Some movies get better with repeated viewings. Others not so much.

786216889164922880 2016-10-12 14:48:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been having frequent bouts of insomnia lately and it has really been taking its toll.
786039969466818560 2016-10-11 03:05:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Oh, YouTube comments, you never cease to amaze me.
786036896405131264 2016-10-11 02:52:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The thing that amazes me with retro video game collecting is how some games I've owned since release have skyrocketed in value. Insane.
785955508578455552 2016-10-11 21:29:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Check out @GhostheadsMovie on DVD and Blu-Ray today!

785314720626585600 2016-10-09 03:03:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I ate half a bag of nachos during football and several scoops of ice cream with cookies during the debate. Somehow, I didn't pass out.
785314075077062657 2016-10-09 03:00:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeyil Ooo, I've had their chicken and waffles before.  I felt like I couldn't move afterwards, but was delicious!
785308509592182784 2016-10-09 02:38:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Credit where credit is due, that was actually a nice answer by Trump to wrap up. I just complimented him. I feel like I need a shower.
785306266633666560 2016-10-09 02:29:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Supreme Court is important. Let's talk about the money I put into my campaign instead. #debate
785301636814102528 2016-10-09 02:11:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> He is trying to argue with an expert foreign affairs journalist. I will trust Martha any day over your idiocy, Donald.
785300999854522368 2016-10-09 02:08:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Did Trump not pay attention during the Cold War?
785299527888736257 2016-10-09 02:02:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Clinton was a Senator for 8 years, not 30, you nimrod. And took office 5 years after your billion dollar loss, you nimrod.
785298072570126336 2016-10-09 01:57:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Please somebody tell me they gif'd Trump walking off and that guy's eyes looking at him like "Where are you going?"
785296775565291521 2016-10-09 01:51:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It was a comparison to Lincoln, not blaming it on him you nimrod!
785294777784803332 2016-10-09 01:43:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You're being interrupted because you are not answering the question. Don't whine when you deflect.
785293123488325635 2016-10-09 01:37:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Drowning my sorrows in ice cream and cookies. #debates
785292213307662340 2016-10-09 01:33:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic Because somehow Trump has gotten this far and is a vile, deplorable human. And now he's bashing Canada.
785291704475656192 2016-10-09 01:31:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel physically ill. #debates
785288968484958208 2016-10-09 01:20:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is a Presidential debate. This is the circus that he has brought.
785288437859438592 2016-10-09 01:18:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Things that people say doesn't make it ok to say it.
785287973596110848 2016-10-09 01:16:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just words, folks? He really just said that.
785286914307784705 2016-10-09 01:12:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Clearly he was coached to not answer the question and deflect to an irrelevant topic.
785286245144342528 2016-10-09 01:10:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Return of the Sniffles.
785285180822999041 2016-10-09 01:05:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here we go....
785284161787486208 2016-10-09 01:01:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, ready to watch another debate. I wonder how many times I will yell at the TV in anger this time around. How has it come to this?
785210497473908736 2016-10-09 20:09:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, now I'm in a bad mood. I'm sure tonight's debate will lift my spirits.....
785137248366841856 2016-10-09 15:18:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> All of us that did High School Theater can relate to this #SNL video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkjjtX83-Cc
785129874830733312 2016-10-09 14:48:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ThatKevinSmith I saw @YogaHosers Friday night. Thought it was big, dumb, harmless fun. It's ridiculous, absurd, and a whole lot of fun.
784960715845017600 2016-10-08 03:36:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I said it last week, but damn, Alec Baldwin does a creepy, scary good impression of Trump on SNL. It's both unsettling and hilarious.
784959316608417796 2016-10-08 03:30:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Looks purty!
784958862289801216 2016-10-08 03:29:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got a blister on my left index finger from the batting cages yesterday. It's making playing the guitar today painful. Fail....
784770943042199552 2016-10-08 15:02:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Remember when we all thought that Sarah Palin was the craziest it would get?
784581793991319553 2016-10-07 02:30:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> But this is consistent. He never learns. He never matures. It's consistent. What a scumbag.
784581560318169088 2016-10-07 02:29:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Everybody at some point in their life has said something stupid, regrettable and out of line, mostly in our teens and early 20s.
784580868803289089 2016-10-07 02:27:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> One thing is for sure is that I'll be looking forward to SNL tomorrow night and the inevitable 3AM twitter tirade. And the debate is Sunday!
784579552941117441 2016-10-07 02:21:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> He said it in his later 50s. He wasn't an ignorant high schooler/college student (doesn't make it OK). He's a vile, deplorable person.
784578555942502400 2016-10-07 02:17:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hearing people defend Trump's newest scandal by saying it is "locker room talk" over and over ignores that pattern of it being consistent.
784553089487470592 2016-10-07 00:36:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yoga Hosers is big stupid fun. I fully recognize the absurdity and strangeness of it, but it's stupid harmless fun.
784235361559949312 2016-10-06 03:34:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Probably my favorite stand up comedians is @iliza. Watching her new special and cracking up. Love her specials. Funny stuff!
783482400340844546 2016-10-04 01:42:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Don't act like Trump doesn't insult people. That's his entire mantra.
783480949266931712 2016-10-04 01:36:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Pence is coming across calm. Kaine feels frantic and interrupting. It's not going great so far, regardless of facts.
783477992840372224 2016-10-04 01:24:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Kaine, seriously, don't act like Trump. Please don't interrupt Pence, no matter how wrong the statements may be. Respond at the right time.
783477664745189376 2016-10-04 01:23:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "You can roll out the numbers, but people think different." Facts vs Perception, the biggest opponent of this election.
783462624155488256 2016-10-04 00:23:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I wish I had that kind of clairvoyance. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/04/the-gop-declares-debate-victory-for-mike-pence-90-minutes-before-it-starts/?tid=sm_Fb
783139839814361088 2016-10-03 03:01:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Enjoyed the pilot of Timeless. Curious to see where it goes next.
783068999445680128 2016-10-03 22:19:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Giant steaks, get in my belly!pic.twitter.com/kvvhiGoPCE
783067170108379136 2016-10-03 22:12:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Probably the most profound statement ever written on a door.pic.twitter.com/ZmBQvu3Qb2
782425019930464257 2016-10-01 03:40:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm actually kind of creeped out at how accurate Alec Baldwin's portrayal of Trump was. Crazy spot on. Kate McKinnon killed it as usual #SNL
782038525310926851 2016-09-30 02:04:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The more crazy things Trump says and does, the more I continually ask myself, "How is this happening?" Seriously, how?
781621517226430464 2016-09-29 22:27:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Something fun I got to film. https://www.wwe.com/videos/daniel-bryan-throws-out-first-pitch-philadelphia-phillies-game
781303307440488448 2016-09-28 01:23:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Damn you tear jerking sad movie for making me feel sad. Need to play more video games to go from sad to just plain annoyed and angry.
781257838878273536 2016-09-28 22:22:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> One of my favorite Smash Bros KOs ever. Beat this arrogant jerk 5 in a row, but this was the most satisfying. Dash dancing is stupid.pic.twitter.com/AyvNRZvEn3
780606466034020352 2016-09-26 03:14:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going to get my mind off the insanity and instead watch some videos about Star Wars instead. Need to put the mind in a fantasy world.
780603305743425536 2016-09-26 03:01:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I may not have agreed with McCain or Romney, but you could at least feel somewhat confident that the US would still exist if they won.
780597699900952576 2016-09-26 02:39:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My head hurts so much now.
780597287428853761 2016-09-26 02:37:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> All of Hillary's ads against Trump are just sound bites of Trump himself. How is that "mean?" It's his own words.
780596405287038976 2016-09-26 02:34:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Winning isn't what temperament is. Temperament is attitude and tone, and how you choose to act and react.
780594534509977600 2016-09-26 02:26:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Such a good temperament that tries to make a point, but misspells simple words by typing way too fast.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/759191265988653056
780587543666364416 2016-09-26 01:59:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic @Squarepainter Aladdin in Genesis forever.
780587381342687233 2016-09-26 01:58:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The moderator seriously needs to moderate, including cutting off opponents microphones. #debates
780585885972606976 2016-09-26 01:52:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I can't believe that was actually said by a person seeking higher office.
780585374057766912 2016-09-26 01:50:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Did anybody else hear that grammar? "He is a very against police judge." This was said by a Presidential candidate. #debates
780581768327864320 2016-09-26 01:36:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @JoonStudios This is not the election to be choosey like that. The scale isn't remotely even.
780581304635043841 2016-09-26 01:34:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Donald Trump is an awful, deplorable human being. How can anyone vote for such a vile man?
780577415076548608 2016-09-26 01:18:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish I had a very small loan of $1 million, because that's such a small number. #debates
780574334578401281 2016-09-26 01:06:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here we go.....
780442643574562816 2016-09-26 16:23:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got this gigantic book today! Can't wait to read it!https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/780442355618811904

779828462152364032 2016-09-24 23:42:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm in love with this new Green Day song. It's been on repeat for me the past few days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnTZa4FY_7I

779758568757157888 2016-09-24 19:05:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing ominous about all those Cobra agents lining up single file in front of the @LivingIn8Bits booth. @Retrocons #retrocon.pic.twitter.com/Xdkm5UYSAv

779490633505316864 2016-09-23 01:20:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TimidWerewolf I know they say don't read the comments/reviews. I taught a class preaching thick skin. But every time, I still get upset.
779482384454393856 2016-09-23 00:47:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> As a filmmaker, I do want everyone to enjoy my work. I legit get shaken up when I read snarky or bad reviews. I guess it's just natural.
779438842164248576 2016-09-23 21:54:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm continually amazed by people who park like this and are like, "Yeah, that's good."pic.twitter.com/DhIL2HmtUM

778432998568001536 2016-09-20 03:17:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Third time within 10 minutes. Seriously, the 3DS online play is awful.pic.twitter.com/I46VMkzzmR
778431718768467973 2016-09-20 03:12:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The 3DS online play is beyond awful. It constantly disconnects and then punishes you for it.pic.twitter.com/u7xYgCvrff
777593857403789312 2016-09-18 19:43:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Spice Up Your Life" by Spice Girls was playing over the PA in Walgreens earlier today. It has been stuck in my head on loop ever since.
777348756136001538 2016-09-17 03:29:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Signs you are a cameraman: You come home to discover a giant welt on your right shoulder, yet you feel stronger on that side.
777157328713814017 2016-09-17 14:48:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got @Retrocons next weekend with the @LivingIn8Bits & @cinevore crew. Panel at 11:15AM on Sat the 24th. Come say hi!https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/777157022429044736
776611289791541248 2016-09-15 02:38:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's amazing to me how often "A communication error has occurred" pops up on the 3DS when beating an arrogant player in Smash Bros.
776228381809451009 2016-09-14 01:17:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finished up Twilight Princess HD. Still one of my favorite Zelda games.pic.twitter.com/VVDF0Px3cQ
775049393124745216 2016-09-11 19:12:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage To give an example, Super Plumber Bros from conception, thru writing, production, editing, and release was over a year.
775048738976903168 2016-09-11 19:09:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage Many factors get in the way:  time, money, real life. Common misconception is that video/filmmaking is cheap, quick, and easy.
774992779222986752 2016-09-11 15:27:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Who talks like that?pic.twitter.com/9ssMcKbdNb
774762299160616960 2016-09-10 00:11:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Man, you can really lose track of time while playing a Zelda game. Need to take a break from questing for a bit.
774694820207955970 2016-09-10 19:43:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Continuing my quest through Hyrule. More Twilight Princess HD this weekend.pic.twitter.com/jmRxHssHNa

772952892303151104 2016-09-05 00:21:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 Oooo, purty. Very nice. Wish I had a single top loader. And many of those NES games. Hell, I'll take both shelves.Sure you won't mind.
772617570809581569 2016-09-04 02:09:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love me some Twilight Princess, but I forgot how awful these Tears of Light sequences were.
772475311589961729 2016-09-04 16:44:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally started playing Twilight Princess HD this weekend. Loved it back when I first got the Wii. Love it still.pic.twitter.com/3Bwj1PVB6E
772265683786735616 2016-09-03 02:51:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Liam Neeson's suit in the Birthday Party scene in Batman Begins is so styling and fly. I want that suit.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAaRlTrSNcE
772246503289217028 2016-09-03 01:34:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching Batman Begins tonight. I forgot how excellent that film is. I love the Christopher Nolan Batman films.

772093238026964992 2016-09-03 15:25:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love being a cinematographer and having gigs. The part I don't love: having to unload the gear and carry it back when done.
771903420588359680 2016-09-02 02:51:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Governor Chris Christie, you are an awful governor and I am ashamed that you represent my state. http://6abc.com/news/christie-ending-decades-old-tax-agreement-with-pennsylvania/1496392/
771557608352194560 2016-09-01 03:57:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't know why this made me laugh as much as it did, but dang, it is amazing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji9qSuQapFY
771521929702416385 2016-09-01 01:35:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The movie adaptation second half was good and reminded me of reading the comic. Just sad that the first half didn't really fit/match.
771521602605486080 2016-09-01 01:34:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Killing Joke graphic novel was one of my first "grown up" comic books and always one of my favorites. It's such a chilling book.
771521353207996418 2016-09-01 01:33:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally just watched Batman: The Killing Joke. Yeah, the first half hour was kind of weak. But the second half was a faithful adaptation.
770445432338153472 2016-08-29 02:17:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66a59bOGTzU

769347772214497280 2016-08-26 01:36:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ContraryHook31 Very flattering, thank you. Age and time are just not kind.
769343210611171328 2016-08-26 01:18:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Time is not friendly to the human body. Definitely getting old.
769336739156615169 2016-08-26 00:52:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I look at my younger self and compare it to me now and I honestly say out loud "What the hell happened?"
769227754046828544 2016-08-26 17:39:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Tonight Tonight by Smashing Pumpkins is hands down one of my favorite music videos ever. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOG3eus4ZSo
768646837209149440 2016-08-24 03:11:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's safe to say I have averaged approximately 18 hours a day almost nonstop the past 3 days between work and the Ghostheads music video.
768270941105164288 2016-08-23 02:17:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Definitely pushing my After Effects abilities to the max with this new Ghostheads music video. But it does look pretty cool!
767875660677165056 2016-08-22 00:06:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Another fun shot from today's @GhostheadsMovie music video shoot from today. https://www.instagram.com/p/BJbWmk-hcYN/
767843497848168448 2016-08-22 21:58:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mail_bag Yup, it was produced by @TommyAvallone. We filmed with one of the Ghostheads, Tom, and his Ecto. It'll be on the DVD.
767842157164015617 2016-08-22 21:53:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Spent my day filming a music video with @honahleemusic for @GhostheadsMovie with @TommyAvallone and @j0elees. https://www.instagram.com/p/BJaqp0FBliS/?taken-by=ghostheadsmovie

767457882946142208 2016-08-21 20:26:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Definitely getting old. Got winded after loading up the car for a shoot tomorrow. Granted, heavy equipment up steps, but still.
767410548799524864 2016-08-21 17:18:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Won't lie, I always get really giddy when I see stuff I've shot or edited air on TV. It never gets old for me.
766797909253771266 2016-08-19 00:44:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Force Awakens is so good. Love watching it again.
766292170303168513 2016-08-18 15:14:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Think @LivingIn8Bits: Super Plumber Bros is worthy of a Philly Geek Award? Nominate now for Multimedia Project at http://www.phillygeekawards.com/nominations/nomination-form/
765382753386958853 2016-08-15 03:00:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So I'm kind of inspired by Stranger Things and want to write/make a monster film thriller. Can't get it out of my head.
765361078855401472 2016-08-15 01:34:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Pretty sure this is how I look to my friends who are younger than me. https://youtu.be/ZywVV0T5DcA?t=1m6s
765215051019980800 2016-08-15 15:54:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It took every bit of willpower to resist a 2 for $4 sale on Vienna Fingers cookies. They're so delicious, but must resist......
764914742385270784 2016-08-14 20:01:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So late to the party, but started watching Stranger Things. Definitely hooked.
763932536212824065 2016-08-11 02:58:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @starwars Yes, yes, so much yes! Very much looking forward this film! @StarWars #RogueOne #StarWars #StarWarsRogueOne https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frdj1zb9sMY
763757499581202433 2016-08-11 15:22:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You realize you're getting old when you're still incredibly sore and have trouble moving 2 days after the company softball game. But we won!
763554461897793537 2016-08-10 01:55:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm generally not into this genre, but damn was Green Room intense. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4062536/
763501964332195840 2016-08-10 22:27:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Experiencing some deja vu right now.
762036666513043456 2016-08-06 21:24:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In Michael Bay films, the color looks like the sun is setting in every shot. High contrast saturated warm colors. I kind of dig it.
761345354050699264 2016-08-04 23:37:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TopherPCLE Bolex and old 16mm Arriflex. Not great. Had a short with 3 reels, 2 messed up. Low battery on one. Scratched in take up on 2nd.
761249176244002816 2016-08-04 17:15:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Totally just got meet Miss Philadelphia Freedom herself, Billie Jean King.
761027902246785025 2016-08-03 02:36:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TopherPCLE I only got to shoot with film a handful of times. Started with VHS and then was Mini-DV for a long time. Went HD in 2009.
761020417079259136 2016-08-03 02:06:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There is something about John Williams' Force Theme from all of the Star Wars films that gives me chills every time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUBUlKgsNK8
760972702572085248 2016-08-03 22:56:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I was interviewed by @geekadelphia about @LivingIn8Bits and Super Plumber Bros. Check it out! http://www.geekadelphia.com/2016/08/03/catching-up-with-mixed-nuts-productions-about-living-in-8-bits-super-plumber-bros/
760746805525045249 2016-08-03 07:59:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Been having this bad case of insomnia lately. Another sleepless night tonight. It feels like I forgot how to fall asleep.
760674796766056449 2016-08-02 03:12:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish I had HD back in the day. Watching my old film/music video projects that were made in SD is somewhat painful.
760662983454273537 2016-08-02 02:26:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic Take On Me - Aha, just to name a few.  So many good ones.  I love music videos.
760662780873576448 2016-08-02 02:25:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @epicgamemusic Jeremy - Pearl Jam, Smooth Criminal - Michael Jackson, Amish Paradise - Weird Al, Tonight Tonight - Smashing Pumpkins....
760324765630406656 2016-08-01 04:02:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In an age of incredibly unnecessary movie remakes, this Ben-Hur movie may be the most unnecessary. Why? Just, why? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BmeR9GYdDU
760281945460707328 2016-08-01 01:11:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Not all that into Snapchat but this was a pretty awesome filter.pic.twitter.com/JOuej6MKfr
760107277315481604 2016-08-01 13:37:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Woot woot!
759924732644818945 2016-07-31 01:32:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I think the novelty of Sharknado may be beyond its peak. I know they're silly fun, but they're not even that fun anymore.
759901974833737728 2016-07-31 00:02:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I can't believe I'm watching another Sharknado movie right now.
759869020761788416 2016-07-31 21:51:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I should find time to sit down and watch the Harry Potter movies again. Only seen each once. Was never into HP that much. Want to try again.
759772525974786048 2016-07-31 15:27:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've never understood the need or desire to comment "first" on YouTube videos.
759591646136786944 2016-07-30 03:28:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I always hate new strings on guitars. Takes a while to break them in and get the right sound.
759476947881562112 2016-07-30 19:53:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You are running for President. The least you can do is learn to spell simple words correctly.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/759191265988653056
759191503046443008 2016-07-29 00:58:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching The Truman Show for the first time in a while. Always loved this movie. Inspired me a lot as a teenager. @JimCarrey is awesome.
759079229862637569 2016-07-29 17:32:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sometimes something as simple as taking a dog for a walk can be relaxing and make the world a better place.pic.twitter.com/E18EPK8FZF
758875312138575874 2016-07-28 04:02:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is an apt visualization.https://twitter.com/sadydoyle/status/758874471641907201
758867126538993664 2016-07-28 03:29:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Please America, do not screw this up. Register to vote. Show up in November. Remember it is not just President, but Congress elections.
758861333362204672 2016-07-28 03:06:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Scratch that: "He spoke for 70 odd minutes, and I do mean odd."
758861028482351104 2016-07-28 03:05:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Proud that this is happening in Philly.
758860596536193024 2016-07-28 03:03:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I believe in science." My favorite line of the night.
758852770673811458 2016-07-28 02:32:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The genuine look of pride and admiration on Chelsea and Bill's faces as they see Hillary addressing the DNC is ridiculously adorable.
758849682881781760 2016-07-28 02:20:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want my life highlight film narrated by Morgan Freeman also.
758744885402808324 2016-07-28 19:24:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well that looks unstable.pic.twitter.com/xYYquq4xq7
758727311457865748 2016-07-28 18:14:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sky is getting dark. Looks like a storm is coming.
758507476987867138 2016-07-27 03:40:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Great speech by the President.
758502750988726272 2016-07-27 03:22:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Can't help but think of the crazy YouTube conspiracy video we watched with "Title Text Here" with @cinevore @stephanieyuhas @sarahbbraun.
758500569917100032 2016-07-27 03:13:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Don't boo. Vote!"  Quote of the night?  Convention?
758499596721152001 2016-07-27 03:09:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt The job is the most literal sense of the phrase "weight of the world on my shoulders."
758498974349266945 2016-07-27 03:07:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt He, like any President before him, certainly deserves the break afterwards. I think history will remember him fondly.
758498191209668608 2016-07-27 03:03:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "It's precisely this contest of ideas that pushes our country forward."
758497250565689345 2016-07-27 03:00:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino You're fortunate to have grown up with him. My adult life through the end of high school, college, and to work force was W.
758495000774582272 2016-07-27 02:51:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This video is reminding me how much I'm going to miss having President Obama as our @POTUS. I hope to meet him sometime.
758488805347164160 2016-07-27 02:26:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ok, Kaine just got major points for making fun of Trump's favorite phrase: "Believe me."
758486844728221696 2016-07-27 02:18:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Kaine seems like a nice dude. His speech just isn't as inspiring as The First Lady or Vice President.
758485475128508416 2016-07-27 02:13:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This is truthfully the first time I'm really getting to "know" Tim Kaine.
758473908693504000 2016-07-27 01:27:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Joe Biden drops the mic at the DNC. Hell of a speech.
758472196012449792 2016-07-27 01:20:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And points to Biden for bring the word "malarkey" back into the vernacular.
758471143737090048 2016-07-27 01:16:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It amazes me how a man who has faced such unspeakable tragedy throughout his life could still be willing to serve, be positive, and hopeful.
758470373725790208 2016-07-27 01:13:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Vice President Biden is someone I'd like to shake his hand, have a beer with, and kindly say "thank you" for his service.
758123616189845504 2016-07-26 02:15:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish I didn't care so much about politics. Probably why I'm so into video games, movies, sports, and other geeky things to escape reality.
758122961563848706 2016-07-26 02:12:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Plus, his main takeaway about why the Republican Convention was better was because the set was better and timing his applause. Dope.
758122829132931075 2016-07-26 02:12:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Does anybody else find the great deal of hypocrisy when Donald Trump tweets someone to get the facts straight?
757762500783812608 2016-07-25 02:20:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hell of a speech by the First Lady at the DNC.
757738675870453761 2016-07-25 00:45:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I don't agree with his Bart-killing policy, but I do approve of his Selma-killing policy."
757738445334642688 2016-07-25 00:44:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Simpsons where Sideshow Bob runs for Mayor is on. "No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it."
757387602819284992 2016-07-24 01:30:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How could this happen? I was so careful. I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?
757376274444783616 2016-07-24 00:45:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You are the audience.  I am the author.  I OUTRANK YOU!
757247586033991680 2016-07-24 16:14:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa @PeteSkerritt Personally, I'm voting for Thing 1 and Thing 2.
757245789164871680 2016-07-24 16:07:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Making @LivingIn8Bits: Super Plumber Bros was a blast. Take a look Behind the Scenes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsCinJWLO_8
756338781909680130 2016-07-21 04:03:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've been coughing so much that it hurts like hell. It's keeping me from sleeping or having any sense of happiness. Please body, get healthy
756327516072124420 2016-07-21 03:18:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every time Trump says "believe me," the less I believe him. This has to be a joke, right? How did this happen? (Rhetorical Question).
756324646669213697 2016-07-21 03:07:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So Trump really is the nominee running for President. This isn't a joke anymore right? Because it isn't funny anymore. It's now frightening.
755409488832712704 2016-07-19 14:30:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Do you also have real chicken, also? Not so sure here Stateside.....
755251163415453697 2016-07-18 04:01:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Stephen Colbert riding in on a chariot wielding a sword and Captain America Shield is the greatest thing to happen this year.
754869484725243904 2016-07-17 02:44:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's insane how incredibly charismatic @TheRock is in Ballers and everything he does. Totally would love to have a beer with him sometime.

754362619247464448 2016-07-16 17:10:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian Don't cut off those locks of sexiness.
754171551029731328 2016-07-15 04:31:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt It wouldn't be as bad if it didn't keep me from sleeping or making my head and chest hurt from consistent coughing. Sigh...
754170459894091777 2016-07-15 04:27:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt Yeah, I've been sick since Monday. Lately it's just been the lingering cough.
754169544273305600 2016-07-15 04:23:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I would so love to not be sick anymore. This coughing thing is getting old.
754106603788316672 2016-07-15 00:13:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Going to sit back, drink an Ecto Cooler, and watch @GhostheadsMovie on Netflix. Congrats @TommyAvallone .pic.twitter.com/EeRc0GWiUf
753785436271550464 2016-07-14 02:57:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Think I'm going to enjoy some Ecto Cooler now.
753776967510622209 2016-07-14 02:23:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @floydlumpkin Kate McKinnon stole the show. This cantankerous, stubborn guy really enjoyed it. I definitely want to see their next adventure
753776231175290881 2016-07-14 02:20:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @floydlumpkin Also, my favorite line: "It's 2040 and our President is a plant."
753776142469959681 2016-07-14 02:20:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @floydlumpkin What if you got a positive review from this man? I thought it was a lot of fun and had a really good time watching it.
753772661520543744 2016-07-14 02:06:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage Believe it or not, no.  Actually enjoyed it.
753772534495973376 2016-07-14 02:05:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino I had a lot of fun with it. Not as funny or memorable as the original but very fun and entertaining.
753768618702307328 2016-07-14 01:50:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ghostbusters is a lot of fun. Not as funny or memorable as original but still a damn good time. Very entertaining.pic.twitter.com/KUBILs1pYy
753732358965235717 2016-07-14 23:26:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> About to see Ghostbusters.  Fingers crossed.pic.twitter.com/Llp3x3Mwbo
753434361886871552 2016-07-13 03:42:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've only caught 2 Pokemon so far. Haven't had much chance to play with it yet. Hopefully may get a chance this weekend to catch some.
753433012189167618 2016-07-13 03:36:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @floydlumpkin Should I stick to the rivers and lakes that I'm used to?
753432706567077888 2016-07-13 03:35:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @cwr2 Very nice and versatile mic. We used it for our podcast interviews and DVD commentary tracks.

751938740893970432 2016-07-09 00:39:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's so awesome to go into a book store, see a book by @ericsmithrocks, and get to gleefully exclaim "I know him!"pic.twitter.com/YKe4AkjjI7

751437562397335552 2016-07-08 15:27:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian You're not alone. I have it. Haven't played through it yet other than to make sure the cartridge I bought worked.
751269594975789057 2016-07-07 04:20:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How did things in this world come to this? I pray it gets better, but also know that prayers are not enough.
750517851505586176 2016-07-05 02:32:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've had Snapchat for approximately 2 hours and fail to see its function and purpose. I also have no idea how to use it.
750480232029847552 2016-07-05 00:03:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MrJerseyJosh I've gotten a few messages about that. If I had Snapchat, I'd check it out myself.
750161365940056065 2016-07-04 02:56:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Some days, you just feel defeated. Today is one of those days.
749814939783659520 2016-07-03 03:59:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's somewhat disappointing watching old childhood 80s cartoons. Doesn't quite hold up the way I remember them.

747645022774902784 2016-06-27 04:17:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian Looking sexy.
747644587724967936 2016-06-27 04:15:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Call it nostalgia, but I'm just smiling. And yes, I totally understand the irony in being nostalgic for a comedy series based on nostalgia.
747644257511612416 2016-06-27 04:14:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seriously, I may have to marathon these on the DVD one day. I'm usually hesitant to watch my old work. Generally makes me cringe.
747643522707259392 2016-06-27 04:11:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There are so many great jokes in these old @LivingIn8Bits episodes that I totally forgot we wrote. Love and miss these great old characters.
747642055401312256 2016-06-27 04:05:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So I've spent my night watching the old @LivingIn8Bits episodes for the 1st time in a long time. Great silly times. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1F4D37AF38233C12
747608304172539904 2016-06-27 01:51:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @seotoyreview Good times hanging out this weekend at @TooManyGames. Thanks for coming to the @LivingIn8Bits panel! Til next time!
747578458365132800 2016-06-27 23:52:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I hate the day after con depression. It's always a tough transition back to reality/normalcy. Very much missing all the great people already
747456763234942976 2016-06-27 15:49:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got a bunch of really cool uncommon/rare games at @TooManyGames this weekend, including one gifted to me by the ever so nice @_Cappelli_!
747287395196764164 2016-06-26 04:36:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Billythechode @alli90 So what you're saying is the computer is close to sentient? That's one step away from Skynet.

746789458238935040 2016-06-25 19:37:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Ran into my old buddy @mclars at @TooManyGames. Gave him some @LivingIn8Bits swag!pic.twitter.com/8kNS5fkofO
745811388518567936 2016-06-22 02:51:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've never seen anything like this before. It's amazing. #NoBillNoBreak
745781485093920768 2016-06-22 00:52:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpeakerRyan No sir, it is not a publicity stunt. How about you and your colleagues stop cashing checks from the NRA and do your job.
745048428607119362 2016-06-20 00:19:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @tedcruz Absolutely disgusting and despicable.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.
745046051497836544 2016-06-20 00:09:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Absolutely disgusted by every member of the US Senate who voted no to this while happily cashing their NRA checks. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-gun-control-bills-orlando_us_57681a1be4b015db1bca03fa
744711500011573252 2016-06-19 02:00:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That episode of #GameofThrones had my heart racing. Wow!
744701220208676865 2016-06-19 01:19:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I finally figured out who Ramsay Bolton reminds me of. He's the Ted Cruz of Game of Thrones.
744605402604703744 2016-06-19 18:58:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Man, Anton Yelchin? Such a shame.
744386135821029376 2016-06-18 04:27:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@SenTedCruz, when you treat firearms as your own personal breakfast skillet, you shouldn't be allowed to speak about anything. #Disgraceful
744210475383144448 2016-06-18 16:49:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got a new buddy sitting on my desk at work.pic.twitter.com/0D0s4fbG3t
744020327445958657 2016-06-17 04:14:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The end of this speech by @hasanminhaj needs to be watched. So well said. https://youtu.be/NUymQKZqP6w?t=18m19s
744001762366001153 2016-06-17 03:00:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm curious how every post I put on the @LivingIn8Bits Facebook Page manages to perform better than 75% of the other posts.
743644708929429505 2016-06-16 03:21:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Something I'm curious about. Why are people who are pro 2nd Amendment against regulation when the word "regulated" is in the writing?
743572458389778434 2016-06-16 22:34:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Got one of the worst brain freezes ever in the cafeteria at work. Lasted a good minute. Coworkers all saw. That's been my night.
743289355297505280 2016-06-15 03:49:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've broken toes before, but it's been so long that I forgot how incredibly annoying it is. Hopefully it heals sooner rather than later.

742934347846684673 2016-06-14 04:18:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I know I've said it before, but watching The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross is so relaxing and helps for a peaceful night's sleep.
742912138851782660 2016-06-14 02:50:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @averagejosh Game should be fun, but people act like arrogant jerks.
742910676918804481 2016-06-14 02:44:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, you just did you arrogant jerk.pic.twitter.com/U93Wcxobgb
742843196456198145 2016-06-14 22:16:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This dude from @TenSecondSongs is quite possibly the most talented musician I've ever seen. I'm amazed.https://twitter.com/TenSecondSongs/status/742775423826853888
742554474405842944 2016-06-13 03:09:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Trevor Noah and @TheDailyShow just had a very poignant, well said segment on the mass shooting epidemic and America's fetish with guns.
742527800721047552 2016-06-13 01:23:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> As long as it heals by the company softball game, I'm good.
742527746438369280 2016-06-13 01:23:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So my toe and part of my foot is bruised purple. 99% sure I broke it yesterday. Taping it seems to help the pain.
742482433447170050 2016-06-13 22:23:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Although this is satire, it accurately depicts Senator Mitch McConnell.  http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/times-we-need-pull-ourselves-hold-our-loved-ones-c-53086
742414376460681217 2016-06-13 17:52:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MrJerseyJosh Got mine case on Amazon Pantry.  Ordered it last week.
742410672819044352 2016-06-13 17:37:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Totally got myself a case of Ecto Cooler. Haven't had it in probably 20 years.pic.twitter.com/gXqmB8Ny6d
742386516727586816 2016-06-13 16:01:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Zero Suit Samus Figma coming very soon. Where were all these toys when I was a kid? http://nintendoinquirer.com/blog/2016/06/13/zero-suit-samus-figure-pre-orders-open-tomorrow/
742365120529997824 2016-06-13 14:36:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I either badly sprained my toe or broke by fluke accident yesterday at the batting cage. Pretty badly bruised.
742190989226463232 2016-06-12 03:04:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @asiakoala I'm quite a fan of him. Loved the series "Chuck" and of course Flynn Rider.
742157188890808320 2016-06-12 00:50:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Haven't watched The Tony Awards in a long time, but watching tonight. I love musical theater. I miss performing onstage on nights like this.
742058397873414144 2016-06-12 18:18:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm absolutely sickened again. Going to go for a long walk and maybe to the batting cage to clear my head.
742058247314624512 2016-06-12 18:17:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Only in America can a guy who is described as "mentally unstable," who beat his ex wife and on a watch list obtain a concealed carry permit.
742058045702819840 2016-06-12 18:16:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The 15th time the President has had to address the nation after a mass shooting in the country.
742038344377466881 2016-06-12 16:58:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@SenateMajLdr As you continue to take money from the NRA, obstruct the President, and support ignorance. How about do something this time.
742037246950420480 2016-06-12 16:54:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, it's somewhat worse. Read Trump's "I told you so" tweets in response.....
742033214504640512 2016-06-12 16:37:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@KOConnorJr  And gun porn fetishes where lawmakers like Ted Cruz treat guns as their own personal breakfast skillethttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZGaJrd3x8
742028294321770496 2016-06-12 16:18:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> People, read this Twitter feed. Shows why mass shootings continue to happen over and over. https://twitter.com/igorvolsky
742026779196526592 2016-06-12 16:12:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> All accurate and correct, yet all falls on deaf ignorant ears by our hypocritical Congressmen.......
742024791624953856 2016-06-12 16:04:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@KOConnorJr Oh and let's not forget the NRA dumping thousands upon thousands into Mitch McConnell's campaign to vote down gun legislation.
742024408030695424 2016-06-12 16:02:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm curious how a guy who was on a reported law enforcement watch list was able to obtain a conceal license.....
741998114396098560 2016-06-12 14:18:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Absolutely heartbroken over two more senseless shootings, this time in Orlando....
741837902242566144 2016-06-11 03:41:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@PeteSkerritt I chalk it up there with fast food campaigns calling their food "real food."
741834990581886976 2016-06-11 03:30:19 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You know, the more Donald Trump says "believe me," the less I actually believe him.
741802816356777984 2016-06-11 01:22:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Turtle Power will always be my favorite hip hop song. I've totally killed it in karaoke before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFsTr0kGAqU
741801709630947330 2016-06-11 01:18:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I surprisingly really enjoyed Out of the Shadows. They got the essence and characters of the Turtles right in the new movie.
741800550627344384 2016-06-11 01:13:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I still get a kick when the Turtles are facing Shredder & Mikey and Donny play paper rock scissors to see who takes him next
741790037034061828 2016-06-11 00:31:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the original 1990 TMNT tonight and it's still so good. It's so well shot and edited. Sound mix is great. My favorite TMNT anything.
741784524741345280 2016-06-11 00:09:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Cause I wanted to redecorate, you know.  A couple of throw pillows.  A TV News Reporter.  What do you think?
741450611716165632 2016-06-10 02:02:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm sorry, I just didn't like The Hateful Eight or most of Taratino's movies. The only one I enjoyed all the way was Inglourious Basterds.
741442559571025921 2016-06-10 01:30:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching The Hateful Eight tonight. I know this isn't a popular opinion for movie buffs, but I just can't get into Tarantino movies.
741357217157386240 2016-06-10 19:51:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> TMNT Out of the Shadows was big dumb fun. Really enjoyed it, honestly. Second best of the TMNT movies with the original '90 being the best.
741316774658854912 2016-06-10 17:11:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seeing TMNT. What is it with me and seeing movies in empty movie theaters?pic.twitter.com/qM4KV5x0hw

737118253156343808 2016-05-29 03:07:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt The arrogance and stupidity grow exponentially. My response as an old guy (I guess) is "Learn to spell."
737117475603615744 2016-05-29 03:04:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love video games, but hate the culture it produced. Everytime I see phrases like "Git Gud" and "Rekt," I feel society getting dumber.

736685676696109057 2016-05-28 22:28:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I do enjoy grilling although I'm not all that sure I'm good at it yet.

736299896354004992 2016-05-27 20:55:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I would say that X-Men: Apocalypse was ok. Perfectly serviceable X-Men movie and had good stuff in it.
736239473860747264 2016-05-27 16:55:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> About to see X-Men Apocalypse in a completely empty movie theater.  Lots of leg room at least!pic.twitter.com/vtXGjD65B3
735649934695747584 2016-05-25 01:53:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @JayHooft I'm convinced that our stuff gets lost in the algorithm grapevine. It's almost like we're being punished for taking time off.

734962396020809728 2016-05-23 04:21:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @asiakoala So I've heard. I've heard so much about it and after watching Lin Miranda's speech at Penn, I was intrigued. Wasn't disappointed.
734929202579922944 2016-05-23 02:09:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> And I say that totally understanding that I may not see it for years due to the insane ticket demand. But definitely fun to listen to.
734928870584004610 2016-05-23 02:07:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Listened to Hamilton the Musical for the 1st time today. Can totally get why it's the hottest ticket on Broadway. Wonder how it sounds live.
734564910005399552 2016-05-22 02:01:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Hold the door.....
734199551637217281 2016-05-21 01:49:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Today has been a rough day.
733865115397722112 2016-05-20 03:40:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @TopherPCLE I could see that. Though a big part of me thinks it would be better served by an unknown actress, so she can make it her own.
733809259524194304 2016-05-20 23:58:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> News that Nintendo may explore movies again. Would love to see Metroid. Who plays Samus? Celebrity or unknown?https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/733808812839317504
733790617864658944 2016-05-20 22:44:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Although I have my issues with a new Ghostbusters film, this trailer finally makes it seem like a fun film to watch. I'll def see it.
733789734720425984 2016-05-20 22:41:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear marketing team for #Ghostbusters, THIS is the trailer that should've released 1st in the US. Not 4th in the UK. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-cbccWXvcs
733647114429947908 2016-05-20 13:14:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Speaking at a career day about video production and that awkward question gets asked: "What kind of money do you make?" If only they knew...

733137421072797696 2016-05-18 03:29:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> ... tackling something so beloved. When the idea was suggested to remake it, Admiral Ackbar should've warned them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA
733137113181499392 2016-05-18 03:28:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Final thoughts for the night: I think it the talent behind it is great and have done great work before, but are in a no win situation...
733131709206659072 2016-05-18 03:06:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Then again, this Presidential primary season has done more to destroy intellectual and critical discourse more than any movie ever could.
733131568684929026 2016-05-18 03:06:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's tough to go into this without predetermined hate or support. I'm honestly concerned about intellectual and critical discourse.
733130536818987009 2016-05-18 03:01:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I can't think of a more polarizing piece of pop culture than the new Ghostbusters movie coming. Marketing hasn't helped.
733110355635908608 2016-05-18 01:41:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Regardless, I'm going to do the best I can to avoid any reviews, spoilers, etc. before the movie comes out so I can see it & judge on my own
733109007607554048 2016-05-18 01:36:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The new Ghostbusters trailer hasn't done much to instill my faith in this movie. The marketing hasn't been great on an already DOA movie.

728374484714033152 2016-05-05 00:03:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel like The Angry Birds Movie is 2 years too late.

727351963722092544 2016-05-02 04:19:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Chris @hardwick is awesome, but it just still blows my mind to think that he was the host of Singled Out when I was a 90s kid.
727344548700127232 2016-05-02 03:50:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy This guy was particularly bad. Lots of dash dancing, taunting, and losing. Just play. Don't act like an arrogant idiot.
727339563975364608 2016-05-02 03:30:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Said it before and I'll saying again. Don't act cocky and dance around in Smash. So satisfying to defeat many times.pic.twitter.com/USZlnoFD8b
727316590564380673 2016-05-02 01:59:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nice response to the 1st episode of @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros. Let's get more views! Like, Share, Subscribe! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjiVBVaK8BU&list=PL7LLTJC5dDlEM53yBP-0LRBymWkDzWbVU&index=2
727277937532215297 2016-05-02 23:25:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I have a firm belief that all Mac computers should be dropped from tenth story windows.
727003777274904577 2016-05-01 05:16:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Not only am I learning about Altered Beast, but also how middle aged nerds hack for hot women online!pic.twitter.com/45PjJkbKNB
726487396192247809 2016-04-30 19:04:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Excuse me, Professor Xavier. How does one gain access to your School for the Gifted?pic.twitter.com/pntbSm7Cfp
726460357003325441 2016-04-30 17:17:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just watched The Never Ending Story in an old timey vaudeville style movie theater and it was awesome!
725704397720813568 2016-04-28 15:13:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> 1st Episode of Super Plumber Bros, the new series from @LivingIn8Bits!  Watch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjiVBVaK8BUpic.twitter.com/G6ePRpGAsY
725541821686931457 2016-04-27 04:27:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I realize that my love for video games, sports, musical theater, filmmaking, music, the arts, & geek culture etc. all clash with each other.
725540389516537856 2016-04-27 04:21:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Word of Advice for Smash Bros players: If you're losing 5 in a row badly, don't then dance and start with a taunt.pic.twitter.com/Vr3meD9h6c
725133304761094144 2016-04-26 01:23:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's some calm, settling, eerie, and beautiful about an orange glowing sky after a storm.
725122272764239872 2016-04-26 00:39:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Prince of Egypt is one of my favorite animated films. The music by @composerstephen and @RealHansZimmer gives me chills. So amazing.
724404648103280640 2016-04-24 01:08:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Love hearing that Game of Thrones theme song.  Here we go.
724346229589696513 2016-04-24 21:16:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> First time taking swings in the batting cages this season. Muscles are out of shape and sore, but good to see I can still drive the ball.
724246839483072512 2016-04-24 14:41:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No Footing is still find its audience. Now over 15,000 views!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFrEO0nqNsQ
724043556751585280 2016-04-23 01:13:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love collecting NES games. I wish I jumped on it more when Funcoland was still around. The "market" has become so outrageous. Fun is lost.
724043147442040832 2016-04-23 01:11:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage Thanks. Just had to cancel plans for the day that I was very much looking forward to.
723906991559704577 2016-04-23 16:10:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My body could have picked any day the past week or next to not feel well and fall apart. It had to pick last night/today......
723670826487259136 2016-04-22 00:32:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros debuting next week!https://twitter.com/LivingIn8Bits/status/723196104926437376
723357010335436800 2016-04-21 03:45:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "I know it's not a problem because I know the words to describe it."
723292575843651584 2016-04-21 23:29:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino Yes. Went there with the Avenue Q cast after a show when I doing that.
723287173617856512 2016-04-21 23:07:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> When you hear about how good a place is, you order food from there, and then after eating you're just like "meh, that wasn't very good."
723253080981118976 2016-04-21 20:52:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, Sneaky, you did just lose. Twice in a row. Then you quit. Maybe you shouldn't act so arrogant. Oh Smash Bros.pic.twitter.com/E6ZGLC5YwB
722963992105230336 2016-04-20 01:43:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I just ate a donut and it was gloriously delicious. But now I'm sad there are no more donuts to be eaten. What a dilemma.
722622068672569345 2016-04-19 03:05:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Best part is then receiving a message: "I didn't do anything to you. You were just rude."
722620291592142849 2016-04-19 02:57:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I get way too much satisfaction out of beating an arrogant, taunt happy, dash dancing player in Smash Bros over and over.
722087689034600448 2016-04-18 15:41:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @elizabeth_panos I should've practiced self control about 5-8 years ago when I still had a metabolism. Now I'm just getting rounder....
722063191010844673 2016-04-18 14:04:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @elizabeth_panos You have more will power than I. I walk by the donuts or ice cream and say "Yes, please, and make it a double."
721861490626707456 2016-04-17 00:42:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm pretty fried and exhausted, but man do I get to do some really cool things with my life. I am very fortunate.
721511094448164864 2016-04-16 01:30:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @DianaLez I had an ice cream/sherbert mix after mine. Forces to be reckoned with, we are.
721186508863049728 2016-04-15 04:00:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Just watched Carol and it was very good, but the score didn't do it for me, which is a shame because I dig Carter Burwell.
721184048547237888 2016-04-15 03:50:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's a shame when a good movie has a so-so, not so good score. Really takes the brevity out of the goods.
721162054837657600 2016-04-15 02:23:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> How is this woman still relevant? I feel like I'd be far richer if I acted this consistently ignorant and stupid. http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/276365-palin-bill-nye-as-much-as-scientist-as-i-am
720726467794116608 2016-04-14 21:32:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I think my body is politely asking me to take a break from everything I'm doing for a few days. I will in a week, I promise.
720632761208414209 2016-04-14 15:20:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @HamillHimself I'm sure I've asked this before, but worth asking again. Will you be my friend? Would love to have a Jedi as a friend.
718951421337415680 2016-04-09 23:59:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sfurze76 @LivingIn8Bits Trust me, I can't wait to get it out to everyone either. A lot of moving parts with no budget is time consuming.
718894262298013697 2016-04-09 20:12:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I just watched all of @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros through. It's so good and funny. Only a few more tweaks to go. Hope to show it soon!
718825158597865473 2016-04-09 15:37:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So, ummm, why is it snowing outside? It is April. It is Spring. Baseball has started. There should be no more snow. Snow, go away, please.
718426871357169665 2016-04-08 13:14:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This particular scholar of the English language screams "I huff aerosol cans on the side." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFrEO0nqNsQpic.twitter.com/EJX4kqGaer
718097026022383616 2016-04-07 15:24:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @JayHooft It's right before IV, the battle that resulted in the Alliance getting the Death Star plans mentioned in the opening crawl.
718096593476517888 2016-04-07 15:22:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've watched the Rogue One trailer at least 10 times now. I'm loving this. Disney buying Marvel and Lucasfilm has proven to be amazing!
718091513834651656 2016-04-07 15:02:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So who is excited about the return of Mon Mothma to Star Wars? Many Bothans died to bring this character back.
718075141595537408 2016-04-07 13:57:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Star Wars: Rogue One.  Yup, I'm on board! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg
717902397834661889 2016-04-06 02:30:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @danthefan That's ridiculous. I actually semibroke the seal on the insert to make it easier to slide in/out. Wish I got the standard version
717892273418149888 2016-04-06 01:50:30 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @danthefan I'm not a fan of the exclusive packaging either. I'm afraid I'm going to damage the discs too easily in it.
717426182757679104 2016-04-05 18:58:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey Not even referring to the artwork. The discs are packed in an annoying way in cardboard slips.
717425312620027904 2016-04-05 18:54:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey Target exclusive.  Not a fan of the packaging though.
717354991720263680 2016-04-05 14:15:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Had to make an important pit stop on my way in this morning. #StarWarsTheForceAwakenspic.twitter.com/4yQT6i9BJd
717198535242997760 2016-04-04 03:53:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @EShroba I'm not into Basketball that much, but wow! I know so many people who go/went to Villanova being Philly area including my brother.
717194221099294721 2016-04-04 03:36:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Unbelievable! Villanova wins! I had my signed Rollie Massimino ball with me for the game. Need Jay Wright on it now!pic.twitter.com/468n0ZHYr3
717192234349817856 2016-04-04 03:28:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Unbelievable!!!!  Villanova!!!!!
716798973843996672 2016-04-03 01:26:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Steven Spielberg, Janusz Kaminski, and Tom Hanks are a dream team. Masters of their respective crafts. Bridge of Spies was so good.
716759910235639808 2016-04-03 22:50:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally watching Bridge of Spies. I'm continually amazed by what a master Spielberg is at composing a scene and Kaminski at framing a shot.
716688081018036225 2016-04-03 18:05:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Rog029 It's just answering generic questions and watching the Miis walk around in circles, speaking in gibberish.
716683819022163968 2016-04-03 17:48:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So this about sums up my thoughts on Miitomo so far. I have no thoughts since I have no idea what its purpose is.pic.twitter.com/FZEM0CWsCE
715010640855830528 2016-03-29 02:59:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The BookFace has a tendency to casually remind me of memories that I'd rather not remember on a daily basis.
714670713546928128 2016-03-28 04:29:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's funny because the user has disabled comments on their own videos. At least it isn't like the comments on the Mega Man videos we made.
714670414337818625 2016-03-28 04:27:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Always great to get a well thought out review of one of your films that you worked hard on: "Unbelievably stupid .... gave up at 10mins."
713909992257167361 2016-03-26 02:06:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Celebrating Easter Byzantine style. Paschal Basket Blessings.  Christos Voskrese!pic.twitter.com/lxotYEGHZj
713790282429571072 2016-03-26 18:10:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey Seems less horrifying, though being in the presence of any of those guys is nightmarish enough.
713781076796301312 2016-03-26 17:34:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Anybody out there may possibly know where/how I can procure one? Thanks!
713780677263638528 2016-03-26 17:32:29 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm still searching for a Mega Man 5 NES Manual to complete my Mega Man Box Collection. I'd like to not pay $50+ on ebay for it.
713767639278034944 2016-03-26 16:40:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @HamillHimself What's your favorite aspect about being a geek lore legend in multiple franchises? Also, will you be my friend? #AskHamill
713740593504116736 2016-03-26 14:53:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I had a dream last night that I was in a Presidential Debate with Ted Cruz. And I was being cordial to him. It truly was a nightmare.
713208107296534528 2016-03-24 03:37:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Batfleck is totally the best part of #BatmanvsSuperman  and there's lots him. But damn, the movie is dark, grim, and cynical at times.
713204120472199168 2016-03-24 03:21:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just got out of #BatmanvSuperman .  Need time to think/process it. Will say this. I'm totally on board with Batfleck!
713126730781863937 2016-03-24 22:13:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The rush hour commute home is far more interesting and intense when blasting the Mortal Kombat techno theme.
712831162855657472 2016-03-23 02:39:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish there were more hours in the day, sometimes. I've been wanting to start Twilight Princess HD, but not enough time to play it.
711396592927031296 2016-03-19 03:38:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Me: "Why is Harrison Ford so damn charming?" GF: "Because he's Harrison F-ing Ford!"
709928721919188992 2016-03-15 02:26:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa It hasn't been a good year/season. I'm genuinely and sincerely worried.
709927963740016640 2016-03-15 02:23:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> America, I ask this with the utmost respect: what the hell have you been doing with these primaries? How did you allow this to happen?
709871979793354753 2016-03-15 22:40:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @DianaLez https://youtu.be/WZcqkTIOZRU?t=5s
709590261605769216 2016-03-14 04:01:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's something incredibly soothing and relaxing ending your day watching The Joy of Painting. I miss Bob Ross. https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc
709381150435897346 2016-03-14 14:10:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Rainy Mondays are a big pile of nope.
709123092812009472 2016-03-13 21:04:54 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @AcDestroyer333 Very similar. Cheap media shelves at Target.
709114353681874944 2016-03-13 20:30:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian Only time I've ever come across it in the wild. First time I ever heard of it was your video. Looking forward to playing it
709107075700359168 2016-03-13 20:01:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt I'll have to sit down and play it. I sadly haven't gotten to play all the games in my collection.
709105880151805952 2016-03-13 19:56:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PeteSkerritt Haven't played it, but came across it for the first time in the wild. I remember Norm's video about it.
709105770177171458 2016-03-13 19:56:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy @GamingHistorian Average $15ish-$25ish, depending where. It's fairly uncommon. First time I've ever seen it in the wild.
709105161965314049 2016-03-13 19:53:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Came across Conquest of the Crystal Palace today and had to pick it up because @GamingHistorian told me to.pic.twitter.com/Q3aqBsoUwR
709041518057807872 2016-03-13 15:40:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Yes, Daylight Savings is tough for the first day. But really, I don't think it's enough to get this worked up about.
709032628402442245 2016-03-13 15:05:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching Ted Cruz on Meet the Press reminds me how much I absolutely hate him. He's a deplorable human being.
708879304663425024 2016-03-12 04:56:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @elizabeth_panos Come back! Not enough awkward headlock hugs!
708842524207611904 2016-03-12 02:30:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So many smiles watching The Peanuts Movie again. It's so perfect, sweet, and adorable.
708832356661108736 2016-03-12 01:49:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingFuturist It's just so damn charming. Watching it again reminds me of how much I enjoy it.
708832240009084929 2016-03-12 01:49:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingFuturist There were so many ways they could've screwed it up. They didn't modernize it or over flash it. It is as it should be.
708831018611044352 2016-03-12 01:44:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I adore The Peanuts Movie. I'm so glad the makers of it did it the way they did.
708748130133606403 2016-03-12 20:14:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Totally ate chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs for lunch because I'm an adult. What of it?pic.twitter.com/vV5jhD5y1X
708729198127554561 2016-03-12 18:59:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love Mega Man games and am happy with the Mega Man Legacy Collection, but playing on the 3DS isn't that fun. Controls don't translate well
708510978615463936 2016-03-11 04:32:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I don't at all disagree with the sentiment, just interesting to see "FreeKesha" in Smash Bros. By any means I guess.pic.twitter.com/iE4ES5aYm7
708112436679843840 2016-03-10 02:08:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @KOConnorJr Problem is that it costs thousands per day to rent a somewhat decent package. Super expensive.
708110495442726912 2016-03-10 02:01:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Why do I keep doing this to myself? I already have a headache. #GOPDebate
708092781974126592 2016-03-10 00:50:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Happy Mario Day! #MarioDay #MAR10Daypic.twitter.com/co0h0wwATP
707811408285724672 2016-03-09 06:12:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 It's what the majority of my stuff has been shot in the last few years. The new @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros is shot with it.
707801910393348096 2016-03-09 05:35:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Don't get me wrong, my AF100 rig is a work horse and has served me well. But my "I want more" Disney princess song is about cameras.
707800914166468608 2016-03-09 05:31:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 Well, all I need is between $50,000 - $70,000 for a basic camera package and have to forgo any other life goals. Sigh.......
707797595259797505 2016-03-09 05:17:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 I've never worked with an Alexa. I've held a RED One a couple times. Even pushed a button, too. But I'm poor. No nice things for me.
707790526351876096 2016-03-09 04:49:46 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish I had a RED Camera. Or an Arri Alexa. Hell, any of those super fancy high end cameras. Wish I had those big toys. Would be so nice.
707398670149427201 2016-03-08 02:52:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Holy wow! I'm late to the party, but this Darth Marth fan film by @shawn_bu is incredible! Seriously check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djo_91jN3Pk
707363590945300480 2016-03-08 00:33:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's oddly relaxing to watch The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross. I love that the old episodes are being released on YouTube.
706992341190631426 2016-03-07 23:58:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa I'm bad at adulting which is probably why I'm a perpetually a child stuck in a 30s body.
706990587791208449 2016-03-07 23:51:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Every night when I get home from work, the first thing I do is take off the work clothes and put on pajama pants because adulting is hard.
706679761804922881 2016-03-06 03:15:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's also fun to Up B out of Mario's cheap Up Tilt combo and they realize they have to actually fight you instead of being cheap.
706672258912272384 2016-03-06 02:46:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> It's so much fun playing a ROB in Smash Bros and taking their Gryo and hanging onto it. They have no idea what to do.
706529949788860416 2016-03-06 17:20:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sad to hear about the passing of Nancy Reagan. May she rest in peace as she rejoins her husband and continue to serve the country in spirit.
706324636036931584 2016-03-05 03:44:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm curious, what is a "Spamer?" I would reply with "Learn to spell" but there aren't enough characters.pic.twitter.com/77Vtcyn7ls
706244218453364736 2016-03-05 22:25:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LMikeP No interest in owning an Xbox. Not enough games that interest me on the system to justify it. I'm a Nintendo guy through and through
706242908370948096 2016-03-05 22:20:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @LMikeP Don't have an Xbox or PS4. So I was running Netflix/HBO Go/etc. off my Chromecast, which was awful. I've always liked Rokus more.
706201550520242176 2016-03-05 19:35:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> You know what, I'm tired of my Chromecast always cutting out, disconnecting, and just overall working poorly. Switching to Roku.
706178094864965632 2016-03-05 18:02:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I just ate hot dogs and tater tots for lunch because although my body may be an adult, my diet and brain is that of a 12 year old child.
706151082909630464 2016-03-05 16:15:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Released the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros trailer last week and it's gotten a nice response so far. So excited!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2uYAOUQu7c
706145397014712320 2016-03-05 15:52:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I loved @creedmovie. @TheSlyStallone and @michaelb4jordan are fantastic and Ryan Coogler's direction, cinematography, & editing is spot on!
705956493246472193 2016-03-04 03:21:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Not only do my allergies hate this constant weather/temperature shifting, but so do my guitar strings....
705882063560450048 2016-03-04 22:26:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Comments are always amusing, but this short thread on No Footing is curious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFrEO0nqNsQpic.twitter.com/2KoURdEIsM
705625348004667394 2016-03-03 05:26:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Still not completely sold on it, but warming up to it. I'll definitely see it when it comes out and hope that it's awesome.
705625234016043009 2016-03-03 05:25:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The Ghostbusters trailer is growing on me a bit. I wonder if the weaponry they're using at the end are Boson Darts like from the game.
705596675621044228 2016-03-03 03:32:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "We must make sure Flint never happens again. Now let's get rid of those pesky regulations that would prevent it."
705585669293342720 2016-03-03 02:48:27 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear Candidates: Being liberal doesn't make you evil. And shut up about off the record tapes. Off the record means off the record.
705579472158908416 2016-03-03 02:23:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This debate is a disgrace.
705573469203857410 2016-03-03 01:59:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I'm going to subject myself to the #GOPDebate. They need Michael Buffer to introduce the candidates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5eE_xZDI1s
705554466746081282 2016-03-03 00:44:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Cinemasins nitpicks are way too subjective. Maybe also I'm bitter because it went after my favorite movie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAiMtfBAeYs
705542207395254273 2016-03-03 23:55:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That being said, the best aspect of it is Kate McKinnon's character. She's great on SNL and she was the standout of the trailer to me.
705541713335599108 2016-03-03 23:53:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Lukewarm to the new Ghostbusters trailer. Hoping it turns out awesome. I do like the talent behind it. Just felt the trailer fell more flat.
705404012250701825 2016-03-03 14:46:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Joebocop93 We don't need the fancy stuff. Just your friendship and hospitality.
705245561436372993 2016-03-02 04:16:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I miss Jon Stewart being on TV every night. I feel we need his sobering comedy commentary to bring balance to the Force known as politics.
705240731334668288 2016-03-02 03:57:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm pretty sure @Joebocop93 doesn't like me anymore. He hasn't invited me over for tea in quite some time. Sad face...
705232284585222144 2016-03-02 03:24:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees I'm still waiting for a Smash Night. And a screening of The Room. And a lot of other things we talked about doing
705230371655393280 2016-03-02 03:16:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dash dancing in Smash Bros is stupid and serves no tactical purpose. It's so satisfying to defeat an arrogant dash dancer.
705205933744496640 2016-03-02 01:39:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 @Gamester81 One of the best around.
705205303504199681 2016-03-02 01:37:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 A lot of people attacking @Gamester81 by falsely and unfairly associating him with a controversy, in turn creating another one.
705200179146858496 2016-03-02 01:16:39 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> An unfortunate side effect of the Internet age is an overabundance of ignorance. False assumptions go viral and die hard.  #teamgamester81
704868732619911168 2016-03-01 03:19:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> This election year is quite possibly the absolute worst in my lifetime. I'm legit scared.
704451740394000384 2016-02-29 23:42:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> We're on @geekadelphia for Super Plumber Bros! Check it out at http://www.geekadelphia.com/2016/02/29/super-plumber-brothers-to-premiere-in-march/pic.twitter.com/w5uMSj24za
704172187654201344 2016-02-28 05:11:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> In all seriousness, I'm glad how Leo used his time to speak about Climate Change. It's an important issue that needs to be tackled #Oscars
704171732362530816 2016-02-28 05:09:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So now it's Leap Day. Should we be concerned that the extra day in the year may somehow randomly devalidate Leo's Oscar? #Oscars
704170414734331904 2016-02-28 05:04:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> . @KOConnorJr Won't lie, the Leo with Oscar memes are pretty hilarious as well.
704169447729270784 2016-02-28 05:00:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Didn't see that one coming with Best Picture. Another #Oscars in the books.
704168346095321090 2016-02-28 04:56:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, I guess the Leo not having an Oscar memes will go away forever. Kind of a sad day for cheap internet humor. #Oscars
704164650204532736 2016-02-28 04:41:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> What matters more than the Oscar is that the message of The Hunting Ground and the song resonate and make a change. #Oscars #ItsOnUs
704163898686119936 2016-02-28 04:38:50 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Not saying it's right. Just sadly it was probably cast over compared to others. Votes are cast pre-performance. #Oscars
704163421936295936 2016-02-28 04:36:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Joebocop93 Sadly, the Gaga song was from a lower profile documentary, so less saw/heard it than others. Not saying it's right.
704163086656208896 2016-02-28 04:35:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Surprised by the Best Song Oscar. Votes are casted before and Lady Gaga's song was more low profile than others sadly. #Oscars
704162448643858432 2016-02-28 04:33:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @MrJerseyJosh He's been around for years as a trained Shakespeare an stage actor. Just not as well known.
704158487769706497 2016-02-28 04:17:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Lady Gaga with the killer powerful performance. The Hunting Ground is an important documentary about a very serious problem. #Oscars
704155260659625984 2016-02-28 04:04:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Apple boxes to the rescue as always. #Oscars
704154672530137088 2016-02-28 04:02:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Also so happy to see the photo used of Haskell Wexler with his "12 on 12 off" hat on. #Oscars
704154413452161025 2016-02-28 04:01:09 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Beautiful performance of Black Bird by Dave Grohl. Many great ones lost. I was fortunate to meet Vilmos Zsigmond on Jersey Girl. #Oscars
704151131304423426 2016-02-28 03:48:06 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Big reaction to Stallone not winning. Imagine the outcry (and eventual memes) if Leo loses. #Oscars
704149120815075328 2016-02-28 03:40:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Louis CK with one of the best jokes of the night: "This Oscar is going home in a Honda Civic." #Oscars
704148664898424833 2016-02-28 03:38:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> No matter what, Rocky Balboa will be a character that will live on forever. Stallone will forever be remembered for his creation. #Oscars
704148148529307650 2016-02-28 03:36:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Nothing against Mark Rylance, I don't know much about him. But Stallone truly deserved a win. Rocky Balboa is a timeless character. #Oscars
704147425829769216 2016-02-28 03:33:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm legit disappointed. Stallone fully deserved to win an Oscar in his life. His performance in Creed was amazing. Very sad. #Oscars
704145338857349121 2016-02-28 03:25:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Twice the TD switched to the handheld shot by mistake tonight. Someone is getting a talking to tonight. #Oscars
704144195284549632 2016-02-28 03:20:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees I'm very surprised See You Again wasn't nominated.  That was the movie soundtrack song of the year for sure.
704142479227035648 2016-02-28 03:13:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Pete Docter with the best words of encouragement you can give. #Oscars
704141689812852737 2016-02-28 03:10:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Buzz and Woody!!!!!!! #Oscars
704141136928047104 2016-02-28 03:08:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Is it wrong that I don't like the Minions that much? I feel they wore out their welcome. #Oscars
704139850597998592 2016-02-28 03:03:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I want a BB8.  Such an adorable little droid. #Oscars
704139481805414401 2016-02-28 03:01:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> C3PO, R2D2, and BB8 always welcome to the party. And of course John Williams is the man! #Oscars
704137469583892481 2016-02-28 02:53:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @kimhornz It was fun, but I don't have the same affection for it either. Still, huge to see a sci-fi/action/fantasy do so well. #Oscars
704136606840705024 2016-02-28 02:50:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That was a great montage to show for Sound Editing. Nicely illustrates how important it is. #Oscars
704134459671646209 2016-02-28 02:41:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm in the minority and didn't love Mad Max: Fury Road the way everyone else did, but it was super well edited. Very deserving. #Oscars
704130865719332864 2016-02-28 02:27:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Mad Max cleaning up with 3 in a row. #Oscars
704129768204140544 2016-02-28 02:23:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Tina Fey is amazing. #Oscars
704120083610804224 2016-02-28 01:44:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Chris Rock just killed it with the opening monologue for the #Oscars
704116030159716353 2016-02-28 01:28:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @QuietTimeAquino Not in the slightest.  I love the Academy Awards.
704115381997273088 2016-02-28 01:26:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I love Oscar Night.  #Oscars
704073593102147584 2016-02-28 22:40:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Oscar night steaks. Because I can.pic.twitter.com/FDMUuQJ9zt
704068664115523584 2016-02-28 22:20:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Some days are just a Pearl Jam kind of day. Today is one of those days.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8177ovFmLzY
703972995040157697 2016-02-28 16:00:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sarahbbraun Oh dem fightin words there....
703804375215579136 2016-02-27 04:50:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> After playing tons of Corrins tonight, it occurred to me why so many like playing as the Fire Emblem characters in Smash: they're all cheap.
703726980513009664 2016-02-27 23:42:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seriously, what is this magic elixir that has made John Stamos so handsome into his 50s and where can I get some?
703719174007353344 2016-02-27 23:11:40 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Fuller House has taught me that I should strive to look like John Stamos when I reach my 50s. If only. Hey, one can dream, right?
703680053008318464 2016-02-27 20:36:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Fuller House makes Steve seem so lonely and pathetic. It's sad. Poor Steve.
703614270739709952 2016-02-27 16:14:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So Fuller House has an entire episode centered around Mexican wrestling... Because when I think of Full House, I think of that.
703251315930091524 2016-02-26 16:12:34 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Poster for Super Plumber Bros, the new @LivingIn8Bits series coming soon. See the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2uYAOUQu7cpic.twitter.com/IVKzrrOYWf
703059471317274625 2016-02-25 03:30:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Actually avoided watching the debate tonight and am glad I did. Instead, I plugged the Super Plumber Bros trailer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2uYAOUQu7c
703055982138695681 2016-02-25 03:16:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching @adamfgoldberg's love letter to Weird Al @alyankovic was great! Tremendous inspiration on my life as well.
703010658690924544 2016-02-25 00:16:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Here's the trailer for Super Plumber Bros, the new @LivingIn8Bits series coming soon! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2uYAOUQu7c
702985570809679872 2016-02-25 22:36:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Tonight seems like a fine time to release a @LivingIn8Bits trailer.
702647049171374088 2016-02-24 00:11:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> With the bad storm going on right now, all I can think about is missing being in the beautiful Florida weather.pic.twitter.com/cJfFSxCw3j
702307630098862080 2016-02-23 01:42:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees The lack of shirts is the least of the show's problems
702227184866430986 2016-02-23 20:23:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @sarahbbraun Thanks! I got a little to used to the beautiful weather and palm trees.
702144715341348864 2016-02-23 14:55:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa @GamingFuturist Hoping RetroWorld doesn't fall on a bad weekend. Last year I had to leave early and drive back to Jersey.
702137281356894210 2016-02-23 14:25:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingFuturist @SpaceKappa I hate post con culture shock. Sad I miss Magfest this year. Hope to be at the next one. TooManyGames in June?
702133531498012672 2016-02-23 14:10:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Worked in Florida for a week. Left mid 70s and sunny to come back to mid 30s and rainy. It is a culture shock coming home.

699750147358531585 2016-02-16 00:20:10 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Matt, Steph, Joey, and I wrote. Steph, Carmen, and I produced. Matt and I directed. Big team effort.
699749747821834240 2016-02-16 00:18:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Although I created @LivingIn8Bits, it is a true team effort. Matt & Steph were just as creatively responsible for SPB as I am.
699745291176648705 2016-02-16 00:00:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Bummed I won't be at Magfest for the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros trailer premiere. Can't wait to hear how about the response!
699689390214352901 2016-02-16 20:18:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Sad to say I won't be at Magfest now. But the @LivingIn8Bits Super Plumber Bros trailer will go on as scheduled at the @retrowaretv panel.
699425213453373440 2016-02-15 02:49:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Frankly, I know very little about Hamilton.  Just the love and disgust contrast from the Grammy performance I didn't watch is amusing.
699424681871413248 2016-02-15 02:46:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Though I do find it funny the number of Hamilton extremes I saw in my feed. Everything from "That was amazing" to "What the hell is this?"
699420515837026304 2016-02-15 02:30:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I am not watching the Grammy's.  I very seldom ever watch them since they rarely have music or performers I listen to or care about.
699311574562050052 2016-02-15 19:17:26 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Teaser for the new @LivingIn8Bits series SUPER PLUMBER BROS. Full trailer at @retrowaretv panel at @MAGFest. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjsI_JdpPsI
699268425101746176 2016-02-15 16:25:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @UrzasRage @actblazer @SpaceKappa I'll be off to the side laughing at everybody, but then realizing that I'm lonely and socially inept.
699241512677306369 2016-02-15 14:39:02 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @actblazer Don't know how to respond to that one.
699094416858939392 2016-02-14 04:54:32 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 Many were either collected over long period of time, given as gifts, or just lucky bargain clearance price finds.
699094245194514432 2016-02-14 04:53:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ADDatWork Damn proud of my nerdy geekiness.
699093998087106561 2016-02-14 04:52:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 Yup, I've got him also, along with several others. Got the Samus Figma as well. New Link Figma coming soon and Zero Suit Samus.
699093833875853312 2016-02-14 04:52:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @ADDatWork Takes one to know one.
699093325526212608 2016-02-14 04:50:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I had already gotten this guy for $20 on clearance. My Link figures are growing into large numbers.pic.twitter.com/xclox1sICb

699090974648233985 2016-02-14 04:40:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 20". He's pretty gigantic. Got him for $20 clearance at Gamestop.
699090286694289408 2016-02-14 04:38:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @PushinUpRoses Seen him 3 times. Twice solo and once with Elton. Definitely worth seeing!
699089802344398849 2016-02-14 04:36:11 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Do I leave him in the box or do I take him out to display?  Decisions....pic.twitter.com/gXHo20yjA5
699042531825291264 2016-02-14 01:28:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I so wish I could have my steak dinner again. It was super delicious.
699031903689641984 2016-02-14 00:46:07 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Billythechode @elizabeth_panos @VintageVGGeek There's a lot of sexy being discussed in this thread that it can barely be contained.
698951309861527552 2016-02-14 19:25:52 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Very fortunate to have seen @allegiancebway 2 weeks ago before it closed. Great show!   https://twitter.com/MixedNutsMikey/status/693869852025606144https://twitter.com/MixedNutsMikey/status/693508149614100480
698727220211269632 2016-02-13 04:35:25 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm a big fan of date night!
698553667042070528 2016-02-13 17:05:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Seeing @PixelDan's updates from the Toy Fair is making me want the toys.  All the toys!
697288367453642753 2016-02-09 05:17:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @elizabeth_panos Usually that's my reaction within 4 hours of anything I film, especially if it features myself.
696860209046798336 2016-02-08 00:56:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian @thelindsayellis I would also add Slumdog Millionaire.
696711226886324224 2016-02-08 15:04:35 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @SpaceKappa Bring it on. Though Corrin is hella cheap.
696710840607760384 2016-02-08 15:03:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @elizabeth_panos She's possessed!  Kill it with fire!
696541815932059648 2016-02-07 03:51:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Let us never forget that Super Bowl 50 will always be remembered as the one that introduced us to PuppyMonkeyBaby https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql7uY36-LwA
696529635836891136 2016-02-07 03:03:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I feel sorry for whoever has been sitting next to "Wooo" Guy this whole game.
696528913430945793 2016-02-07 03:00:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @j0elees Once I started hearing it, it was all I could hear. "Wooo" Guy is really irritating.
696527826355412994 2016-02-07 02:55:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Can we please have Helen Mirren moderate the next round of debates?
696527174019457025 2016-02-07 02:53:13 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Placement of field mics for live events is crucial and is evident by the "Woooo" guy tonight.
696518762321809410 2016-02-07 02:19:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Someone definitely had to have dreamed Weiner Dogs running to ketchup  in a field after an all night pizza binge. We've all been there.
696517481012264960 2016-02-07 02:14:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> PuppyMonkeyBaby is kind of like a Pokmon, right?
696507921312649216 2016-02-07 01:36:43 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Camera framerate changes to 24p for Halftime Show.
696503832818360320 2016-02-07 01:20:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> If this upcoming Halftime Show doesn't begin with a Power Rangers Tiger Zord or feature dancing sharks, I'm going to be very disappointed.
696493366935216128 2016-02-07 00:38:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Looks like Krang will be in the next TMNT.
696492456695693312 2016-02-07 00:35:16 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Vimini I had to watch it again to see if it was real.
696486331451600896 2016-02-07 00:10:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I still can't shake the horrifying image of PuppyMonkeyBaby.  It's the stuff nightmares are made of.
696187624256638977 2016-02-06 04:23:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> A Zero Suit Samus Figma is in the works?  Just take my money now.  Take it.https://twitter.com/NintendoInq/status/696174351457120257
696167297422118912 2016-02-06 03:03:12 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> These debates and candidates continually make my blood boil.
695787884310347777 2016-02-05 01:55:33 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Just watched The Hunting Ground documentary and am so angry, saddened, and upset.
695683016715329536 2016-02-05 18:58:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There is something fairly intense about listening to One Day More from Les Mis while getting your tax information together.
695462877810061312 2016-02-04 04:24:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian Fun can't even begin to describe 1099 and Schedule C's!
695451124241981440 2016-02-04 03:37:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Right....https://youtu.be/HQfzwFloVqA
695450032699367424 2016-02-04 03:33:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Bayonetta is cheap with those air combos.  But that time stop counter is unreal cheap.  Wow....
695443104833208321 2016-02-04 03:05:31 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I'm don't know anything about Fire Emblem, so what is Corrin exactly?
695100556201844741 2016-02-03 04:24:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamingHistorian @Roo_CotGW If you need someone to film the music video, you know who to call.....
694307667272146944 2016-02-01 23:53:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the chariot race from Ben-Hur is still so thrilling. I wish they still made films that way.
693990574790156288 2016-01-31 02:53:41 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Legit question for those watching Grease Live. Where are they hiding the microphones and transmitters on those costumes?
693973034080825344 2016-01-31 01:43:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Only half paying attention to Grease Live. Forgot it was on so I missed a lot of the first half. Will have to catch it On Demand this week.
693962462295691264 2016-01-31 01:01:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's a part of me that really doesn't like how the songs have to be censored for #GreaseLive
693872437478453252 2016-01-31 19:04:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> For those wondering, here is @GeorgeTakei explaining the saved seat for Trump for @allegiancebway https://www.facebook.com/georgehtakei/videos/1426957877333661/
693869852025606144 2016-01-31 18:53:58 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> .@allegiancebway was wonderful! So moving and touching. Congrats @GeorgeTakei @MsLeaSalonga @tellyleung and cast!pic.twitter.com/DMLHlov9Hb
693508149614100480 2016-01-30 18:56:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> About to see Allegiance starring @GeorgeTakei and Lea Salonga. The seat behind me is reserved for Donald Trump.pic.twitter.com/XTaNtk0H0m
693209006274379777 2016-01-29 23:08:00 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Nope, didn't get it.
693193324740644864 2016-01-29 22:05:42 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Amazing! Anyone who grew up a TMNT fan would love this.pic.twitter.com/YBs2b21aDV
692920114241486850 2016-01-28 04:00:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Debate over. Much of me raising my voice at the TV, specifically repeating "answer the question instead of scripted rhetoric."
692898053091536896 2016-01-28 02:32:23 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Don't get mad at the question being asked. Get mad that the question asked isn't being answered. Stop the rhetoric.
692892369952198658 2016-01-28 02:09:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Dear Candidates, I don't want to hear about how you think Obama is a bad President or Hillary will fail. I want to hear about your ideas...
692891357208117248 2016-01-28 02:05:47 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Watching the debates...again...and it saddens me to admit that Ted Cruz made an actual good point in his opening remarks.
692786793163284480 2016-01-28 19:10:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> That being said, Jessica Jones was a ridiculously good show. They did a really good job with the writing/characters/etc.
692786620613799937 2016-01-28 19:09:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> There's a certain degree of irony that Jessica Jones was written/created by the same writer of the Twilight movies. Think about that....
692719996481462274 2016-01-28 14:44:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @alli90 That is a big burger.  It's so burger-ly.
692576800615047174 2016-01-27 05:15:51 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thanks to Jessica Jones, I'm going to always say the name "Jessica" so deliberately the way David Tennant does. Thankfully I don't know many
692197109550940161 2016-01-26 04:07:05 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Over the weekend, I had a dream that I won the big hockey game Mighty Ducks style with a Flying V and all. Goal assist by Averman.
692125196703133697 2016-01-26 23:21:20 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @DianaLez I want to go.
692111002364723200 2016-01-26 22:24:56 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Truthfully, I don't like the binge watching model of TV shows. I'm probably in the minority.
691764059277004800 2016-01-25 23:26:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> On the flip side, it'd be nice to use my Chromecast without it crapping out mid-stream at least once. I may just get a Roku instead.
691762736620007424 2016-01-25 23:21:03 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Finally started watching Jessica Jones. 3 Episodes in and digging it. Would be cool to see her and Daredevil team up with the Avengers.
691707180018462721 2016-01-25 19:40:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @GamerGoingGrey I'm still skeptical. Now that I'm in my 30s, I'm more mindful of the various activities that are out to destroy my back.
691706252351672320 2016-01-25 19:36:36 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> The realist adult in me realizes that I'll probably sink into the middle and probably hurt my back trying to climb out.
691706103730716673 2016-01-25 19:36:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Whenever I see snow mountains in parking lots, the kid in me wants to scale and conquer them like in my younger dayspic.twitter.com/XCFYMuRe1y
691474844756631552 2016-01-24 04:17:04 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I've never played the Ocarina of Time Master Quest. Is it worth playing?
691473524964335616 2016-01-24 04:11:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Squarepainter I'll need to sit down with it sometime. I didn't play Link to the Past until I was well into my 20s.
691473100752437249 2016-01-24 04:10:08 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Squarepainter You're not alone. I've never played it (though I have it). Didn't have an SNES growing up, so missed out on lots of games.
691471403497996288 2016-01-24 04:03:24 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> "Gee Mike, how did you spend your blizzard weekend?" Playing video games. Lots and lots of video games. Way too many video games....
691314206747029505 2016-01-24 17:38:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wish the Super Mario Bros movie was on blu-ray. The UK has it with a 60 minute retrospective doc. Such a guilty pleasure, but I love it.
691289196372365312 2016-01-24 15:59:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @KOConnorJr Didn't you hear? They're all Google Hangouts and Face Time now. Meeting and talking to someone in person is so 90s.
691116195232235520 2016-01-23 04:31:55 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Tina Fey does Sarah Palin so well. I love election season sketches on SNL.
691068908703449088 2016-01-23 01:24:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 I had an NES, Genesis, N64 growing up. Didn't have SNES or Gamecube, so my affections/loyalties lied with those games.
691066791779504130 2016-01-23 01:15:37 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 So I don't have the same affection for LTTP that others did, or really any game on the SNES library.
691066701564215296 2016-01-23 01:15:15 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @mikeke352 My favorite will always be the original on NES. I didn't have an SNES growing up, so I didn't play LTTP until I was much older.
691060592656908288 2016-01-23 00:50:59 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @actblazer I've played the N64 Ocarina 3 times and 3Ds once. I've always loved that game. I didn't make it through MM N64. Played 3Ds now.
691057918007992321 2016-01-23 00:40:21 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @actblazer I love Ocarina of Time. I haven't played Wind Waker, though.
691056983173152768 2016-01-23 00:36:38 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @actblazer Should be a fun discussion. I like Mario Kart 64 ok, but not my favorite of the series. Majora's Mask on the other hand, boo.....
691052351243841536 2016-01-23 00:18:14 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Hit me up if you see me on there.
691051542091292673 2016-01-23 00:15:01 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy Probably. I may hop on at some point. Taking a game break after finishing Majora's Mask today.
691040291235745793 2016-01-23 23:30:18 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> My week long rant about my dislike for Majora's Mask is done. Whew. Looking forward to the Twilight Princess HD release.
691039899873611778 2016-01-23 23:28:45 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I wasn't a fan of Majora's Mask when it first came out and even less of a fan now completing it. Not my favorite Zelda game at all.
691039658654973953 2016-01-23 23:27:48 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Thankfully, the Fierce Deity Mask made the final battle with Majora's Mask go by quickly and finally end the game.
691039325040033792 2016-01-23 23:26:28 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I tried giving it a fair shot, but each dungeon and boss just made it worse. Great Bay Temple was awful. The last 2 Temple Bosses awful.
691039049667219456 2016-01-23 23:25:22 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> I sincerely don't understand why it has gotten so much esteem the past few years. It was laborious, a chore, frustrating, annoying, etc.
691038692320870401 2016-01-23 23:23:57 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Well, finished Majora's Mask and it was the most miserable experience I've had playing a Zelda game.pic.twitter.com/hlDIBztzUK
690008988591742978 2016-01-20 03:12:17 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> Mac would wear his duster while skiing.  #AlwaysSunny
689649736547188736 2016-01-19 03:24:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So The Great Bay Temple was without a doubt the most miserable experience I've ever had playing a Zelda Game. Stupid Majora's Mask....
689639959460999168 2016-01-19 02:45:53 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> For those who praise the gameplay in Majora's Mask, I present to you the dissenting argument: The Great Bay Temple, swimming, and the camera
689638683251707907 2016-01-19 02:40:49 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> @Comic_Kathy The arrows can be as cool as they want. The temple still sucks.
689634132108906500 2016-01-19 02:22:44 UTC <MixedNutsMikey> So now I'm playing the Great Bay Temple. It's the Water Temple over all over again. Ugh.....
