947714699193303040 2017-12-31 06:22:46 UTC <pgaines937> @danharmon Holy shit this is so meta it's meta times meta. Just stay true to yourself. Abstraction doesn't make sense until it's the thing that literally makes all of society work because we have such a large complex civilization that we literally have to overthink the micro and macro.
