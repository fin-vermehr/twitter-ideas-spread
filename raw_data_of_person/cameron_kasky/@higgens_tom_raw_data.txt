I had a 16ga rem 1100 semi and I loved that gun but it had a 3rnd plug. I just dont think anyone needs more than 5rnds for hunting or home defense. Joust my idea and feelings!

Are you saying you would go to a civil war over a type of gun?

Semi auto no problem but no more than 5rnds for anyone carrying a weapon. This time for any made before the ban too! Nobody needs 30rnds its idiotic!

966503037576630272 2018-02-21 02:40:55 UTC <higgens_tom> @DebtTrut I know the feeling and sometimes you have to back away for your own well being I have felt that way too. Take a break then come back if and when you feel like it to fight another day! Youre doing a good job!
966502526282600449 2018-02-21 02:38:53 UTC <higgens_tom> @DebtTrut I did not see them and have been looking but I suppose I could have missed them. I was trying to support you!
966502146656096257 2018-02-21 02:37:23 UTC <higgens_tom> @DebtTrut I agree with you! Kansas has cut all kinds of services so the Kochs could get many millions in tax breaks! I do believe trump promised not to touch Medicaid or Medicare did he not? I know he had no intention of keeping it.

966475765234765825 2018-02-21 00:52:33 UTC <higgens_tom> @car_nove So true and if was simply a matter of mental health why dont people with the exact same problems in other countries commit mass murders? Are our illnesses special somehow aside from adding guns to the equation?
966468604970651648 2018-02-21 00:24:06 UTC <higgens_tom> @StephLouiseATB I couldnt agree more! What does it take from you? A kind word??

Direct and well put but in the age of trump they are going to latch on to anything they can and just ride it into the ground. I guarantee if PBO was still President these same people would be blaming him for it!

962704723106304001 2018-02-11 15:07:46 UTC <higgens_tom> @ClarkeMicah This is such a strange statement because if you were indeed an atheist why would you have hated what I as an atheist believe to be a fictional character. I certainly dont hate the non existent. To me its just as silly as saying that you hate Santa Clause.

It just goes into DJTs business practices over the years. I am into my 7th decade & I dont think I have ever missed a SOTU after JFK. Politics have always interested me.
958726085230911488 2018-01-31 15:38:05 UTC <higgens_tom> @POTUS @RealMattCouch @bekind4america @MyPrezTweets watch the show I suggested, my offer is still open. Had Trump lost at running 4 President he was getting ready 2go down in flames as he had more debt than he could pay off. I honestly believe one of the reasons he wanted 2win so bad was 2get Secret Service protection from Rushnns
958723279023419393 2018-01-31 15:26:56 UTC <higgens_tom> @RealMattCouch @bekind4america @MyPrezTweets I hope Trump succeeds too as I want whats best for our country even if I have to eat crow. I truly hope you are right and I am wrong!

How can u be conned so easily?
958484906056867840 2018-01-30 23:39:44 UTC <higgens_tom> @RealMattCouch @bekind4america @MyPrezTweets I cant possibly imagine PBO sitting and taking the horseshit praise heaped upon Trump by members of his Cabinet & Congress with a straight face.

Politics R kind of tools of the trade when it comes to art on either side of the political spectrum. Wasnt Picassos Guernica a political statement made by its showing?

I just think even though you and Connie R right we cant let any issue tear us apart. We have to hold our noses sometimes 2defeat our common enemy. I have learned more about Bernies lack of strength on womens issues but we R up against people that will kill R V Wade

They stick 2gether backing a pedo. We cant alienate bern bros or greens we have bigger fish to fry.

You wont take yes for an answer.

I think a man who jokes around about grabbing women by the crotch is a bigger issue. I dont think Bernie is some kind of monster as so many seem to want to portray him.

U might be right about Jane but she isnt doing as good as many wives nor is she running. There maybe something there I need to do more research! Thanks for clearing it up!

How many other children that were drowning or dying prayed unsuccessfully for a similar outcome only to get nothing?

I wonder why the Bible didnt help people out with a few tips about health and medicine  or about the cosmos? Its because it was written by men with 0 divine input. A great book but all the same  just a book.

Trump though hes probably a racist too, is horrible but the worst thing about him is some of his followers and people who are absolutely racists and continue to defend him no matter what he says.

We have a problem with guns here in the states because they leave a constant trail of broken hearts and destruction, more guns is absolutely not the answer.

Keep on trying to defend Benedict Donald though he will be reviled in US history!

950844857618137088 2018-01-09 21:40:54 UTC <higgens_tom> @CatEarthSociety @Mitchrick @KassandraSeven I agree but the reality we are facing is that even the Green Party on its own cost us 4 or 8 yrs of DJT we have got to work within the party to improve it not divide it anymore.

950778230021197826 2018-01-09 17:16:09 UTC <higgens_tom> @HPTweeter Where does TV news get most of the real news they report? Losing newspaper reporters will complete the dumbing down of America making it easier for TV stars on both sides to dupe the dolts.

950047908283502593 2018-01-07 16:54:07 UTC <higgens_tom> I would have loved to have heard Chuck Todd ask Lindsay Graham on Meet the Press this morning if he is being so vociferous about the FBI because of the 800k he got from the Russian gangster and oligarch Blavatnik. Asked him what other $ he is taking from oligarchs and thieves.

Conservatives want to keep things as they are or return to the past. They trick the lowest common denominator to advance life for a rich few.

Not good at all! She was one of the best contributors you had. I have no idea what you could have been thinking but it was idiotic at best.

They almost acted scared of him, how third world is that? Pence greased that pig the day before Iwant to thank pres trump 4 his honesty WTF? 103 lies in 11 months NYT article. PBO 18x in 7yrs.
944517044367699970 2017-12-23 10:36:26 UTC <higgens_tom> The only thing I like about Pence aside from being a good sport about the welcome he got at Hamilton is that when he speaks he looks like hes in extreme pain!!

944508599010766849 2017-12-23 10:02:52 UTC <higgens_tom> @RWPUSA Even though Franken didnt try to get Sessions to perjure himself he did that all on his own showing he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. U know he was on Sessions target list. This all stunk every bit of it. I wont support Kirsten Gillibrand anymore or any of the others.

944496295166840832 2017-12-23 09:13:59 UTC <higgens_tom> @nikkihaley @MalcolmNance Sad to see that all of the great work done by our diplomats since WWII as leaders of the free world come to this because of one mans ego! We are no longer world leaders but shills for a corrupt con artist.

944010306124165121 2017-12-21 01:02:50 UTC <higgens_tom> @thehill I think that 11 is incredibly generous
944009527627788289 2017-12-21 00:59:44 UTC <higgens_tom> The republicans tell us how great the economy is doing then tell us the corporations need our help.
944009018875482113 2017-12-21 00:57:43 UTC <higgens_tom> @TeaPainUSA @bebe_bichon Much better but that doesnt help campaign coffers
944008516578238466 2017-12-21 00:55:43 UTC <higgens_tom> @TeaPainUSA The only thing we found out from trickle down was it doesnt work because there is no bottom to their pockets.

944002610155094017 2017-12-21 00:32:15 UTC <higgens_tom> @kylegriffin1 @StevijoPayne Good point and its so sad to see all these kids have to put their chosen career on hold because our president is too dumb to understand why diplomacy is our best and cheapest option.
944001659683921921 2017-12-21 00:28:29 UTC <higgens_tom> @kylegriffin1 We will get back to being the beacon of light and hope we once were when we kick these fear merchants out on their butts again!!

943978446929170432 2017-12-21 22:56:14 UTC <higgens_tom> Nikki Haley who told you the American people want to move our embassy? Its already caused mayhem and its just another republican payoff to donors!
943976017273729025 2017-12-21 22:46:35 UTC <higgens_tom> @ProAntiTheist Couldnt agree more. That limestone was compressed down by the hand of god? I watched NASA iSS camera today if people think thats phony whats the point in even attempting an honest discussion and sad to say some issues politically are just as crazy. Trickle down for one.
943951686908960769 2017-12-21 21:09:54 UTC <higgens_tom> @mnewsince @pfbt @MrBrendanBlack @JosephOMorrow1 I dont believe that is true we have evolved in the last several centuries look at the best statistics available which are military medical info and the heights of soldiers since Napoleons Armies. Civil War Soldiers and up to the 1st gulf war height statistics.
943950076875034629 2017-12-21 21:03:30 UTC <higgens_tom> @RWPUSA Stay Al rescind your resignation you are a victim here. I used to like Sen Gillibrand. That woman from Tx that claimed you were groping her with her husband taking the picture was full of it. The other accusations are nonsense. This was a RR Job All Aboard! Choo Choo!! 
943874981867421696 2017-12-21 16:05:06 UTC <higgens_tom> Mr. President I want to thank you for your honesty! Mike pence

943770738711986176 2017-12-21 09:10:53 UTC <higgens_tom> @MrBrendanBlack Makes perfect sense to me!
943769562490732544 2017-12-21 09:06:12 UTC <higgens_tom> I really wish people would stop putting up anything about the Kardashians. I would be much more interested in just about any other subject that doesnt include celebrities esp celebs that have never really done anything at all! Tell me about your job it would be more interesting!
943767918302715904 2017-12-21 08:59:40 UTC <higgens_tom> @NBCPolitics Thats sickening Al should rescind his offer!! Now he can write another book and I cant wait. He got railroaded!! All aboard!! Choo! Choo!!
943643398262738944 2017-12-20 00:44:52 UTC <higgens_tom> You already know whats going to happen the stock market will crash because of these cuts & since we cant let the big banks fail well u know the rest of the story. Were the republicans celebrating 13 million people losing their healthcare? Chip? Tiny Tims going to die Yeah!
943640300647534593 2017-12-20 00:32:34 UTC <higgens_tom> @krassenstein @Trumpgot2go Trumps balls wont lick themselves but evidently thats what Pences job description is!
943639431260622849 2017-12-20 00:29:07 UTC <higgens_tom> Trumpys butt must be sore tonight from all of that disgusting sucking up! He just stands there like an  imbecile with a straight face but these politicians would sell him out in a flash! Hahahaha!!! He is a sucker! What an Ego!
943638249595162626 2017-12-20 00:24:25 UTC <higgens_tom> When Trump said he wasnt going to fire Robert Mueller unsolicited I knew something was up and Gaetz Sean Hannity,Pirro and & the rest of these clowns  proved it. Talk of a coup which is defined as a violent overthrow of a Govt. so over the top that its a joke. Not funny!
943602666915225601 2017-12-20 22:03:01 UTC <higgens_tom> @JoyAnnReid Al was a victim of timing and Im disgusted by these phony charges against him! Choo choo!!All Aboard!!
943598300787281921 2017-12-20 21:45:40 UTC <higgens_tom> @tribelaw @LoralynHegland Whenever I get a bit down and begin to feel despair I just youtube a Randy Rainbow interview or song and before long Im laughing about it! That guy has got more creativity than the entire GOP!! I put one on today after watching the ass kissing contest for trump 
943577543948595200 2017-12-20 20:23:11 UTC <higgens_tom> 60% goes to the top .01% of the top 1% this is the largest transfer of wealth to the greedy in human history! The republicans should be ashamed!! The people want the middle and poor to get help not the wealthiest who get another fortune! This SUCKS!!!! Trumps get &1billion alone.
943190892839567361 2017-12-19 18:46:47 UTC <higgens_tom> Right back at ya !! We all get carried away now and again but we keep it real!! You are ok in my book!!
943178457483268096 2017-12-19 17:57:22 UTC <higgens_tom> I know I was drunk it was late and dark in there but she wasnt that oh the media right... uh C-span is ok but boring man is it boring. 
943170572569194498 2017-12-19 17:26:02 UTC <higgens_tom> The media makes more of our differences than there really is. Hype butters their bread! Most on both sides are more in the middle than the congress is willing to admit bcuz of their bases. Reasonable rarely gets re-elected! I dont agree with the far left either.
943168434417950720 2017-12-19 17:17:32 UTC <higgens_tom> I wish the congress could come together and work these issues out with civility! We are polar opposites on some politics but at least we have productive debate with no venom!! If only huh??
943167779821236226 2017-12-19 17:14:56 UTC <higgens_tom> Good job once again!!
943167516385345536 2017-12-19 17:13:53 UTC <higgens_tom> Trump and the wealthy dont live with the pollution created by deregulation. I lived through the DDT years and the effects of agent orange  cancer and leukemia and all the other horrors of the 50s so once bitten twice shy! Great points made by you though good job 
943165162051325952 2017-12-19 17:04:32 UTC <higgens_tom> 7trillion in Iraq but what choice did Obama have? Half of that was spent by W and their recklessness caused Isis not Obama. Even with the regulations that protect our environment the economy still was growing and strong why gamble with another crash?
943164259340611585 2017-12-19 17:00:57 UTC <higgens_tom> I have no problem with small businesses and even medium sized Corp getting some help its the ruthless giants I have a problem with they are flush with cash and I dont even care about most of the 1% its the top 1/30 of the top 1% that own half the wealth of the entire country!
943117610283126785 2017-12-19 13:55:35 UTC <higgens_tom> @aa_tweeter She put trump in office and so did Gary Johnson please dont fall for division again.
943116895582146562 2017-12-19 13:52:44 UTC <higgens_tom> 2hear republicans tell it this tax bill is really going 2get the economy up &running. I thought it was? They love to talk about the dreadful Obama years,but I would like to remind them of the shape the economy was in when he went into office. He handed off trump great economy.  .
943102912804409344 2017-12-19 12:57:11 UTC <higgens_tom> Rep Tom Cole thanks for being a good sport!!however we know who this tax bill helps and its not the poor and middle class. The wealthy dont have bottoms to their pockets! People know what the end result will be!
943074147630047232 2017-12-19 11:02:52 UTC <higgens_tom> @MamaRose2017 We cant afford to help the poor with healthcare or food stamps for single mothers!
943073607319719936 2017-12-19 11:00:44 UTC <higgens_tom> @CyrusToulabi The Governor of Maine also didnt want to allow some the use of narcan that brings people back from an opiate overdose! The true definition of the word DICK, in the dictionary it says see Gov. Paul LePage!
943072386664095745 2017-12-19 10:55:53 UTC <higgens_tom> @Green_Footballs Or possibly of most of life on planet earth! I believe its called a nuclear winter
943049689020104705 2017-12-19 09:25:41 UTC <higgens_tom> @AtheistRepublic I grew up with guns got my first shotgun when I was 13 but for hunting, nobody needs weapons that hold more than5-8 rnds only M&P, get caught outside your house with one U get an all expense paid free govt vacation for a very long time. Stop selling  cheap ammo all of it!
943046729095630849 2017-12-19 09:13:55 UTC <higgens_tom> @TheRickyDavila You know why all they are staying late to put in special provisions?? So they can cut backroom deals with lobbyists lining up for the pay and play the republicans are stinking up the place with! Ever American should be ashamed if you voted for these con artists!
943040949906759680 2017-12-19 08:50:57 UTC <higgens_tom> @caspmax Well its that special time of year when the nativity scenes are out and the sweet baby Jesus was born & pastor greglocke feels the need to vomit fire !!! Why isnt that special!!!
943040317938438144 2017-12-19 08:48:27 UTC <higgens_tom> @freespeechtv @RickSmithShow Sounds great I am very interested to see it !! I dont think we have it here.
942902107744669696 2017-12-18 23:39:15 UTC <higgens_tom> This republican /trump tax scam is going to give $48 Billion to foreign stock holders at the expense of the middle class! Everyone should be disgusted!! Add 1.5 Trillion dollars to the debt. I never want to hear republicans complain about the poor or the deficit. Sick!!
942899505170649094 2017-12-18 23:28:54 UTC <higgens_tom> @ICallahan1966 the definition of a coup is a violent overthrow of a govt. sorry we have a difference in time zones Ill have to catch Bret tomorrow as It is just 17:29 here.

942835741679382528 2017-12-18 19:15:32 UTC <higgens_tom> @Transcendian I read the End of Faith but it was Hitchens God is not Great that I really liked. Dawkins the Magic of Reality is great too! Im still reading Neil D Tysons Astrophysics for people in a hurry but it has slowed me down a might its a really good book though!
942834511209009153 2017-12-18 19:10:39 UTC <higgens_tom> @Transcendian Grant could be funny, he didnt care for music and said he could only recognize two tunes, one was Yankee Doodle and the other wasnt.
942834098799824896 2017-12-18 19:09:00 UTC <higgens_tom> @Transcendian Stonewall brigade liberated a huge supply of salt on one of his raids so they had plenty of salt and they said they mostly ate green roasting ears of corn and lots of apples so it was a joke that CSA stood for corn, salt and apples. Another joke was they were called cornfeds!

Why hell it could even cause some guy that sees himself like some Hollywood movie character to commit violence, like some quack that sees himself as Dirty Harry to go off the deep-end!

942722638492983296 2017-12-18 11:46:06 UTC <higgens_tom> @GartrellLinda Did U read the entire article? Automation is the real job killer not the incremental raise that will only hit by 2023. G.W. Bushs tax cuts trickle down BS cost the country more jobs than an increase in wages to $15 ever could, Yet here we go again right back down that same road.

If you watch Fox you become so used to the lies that they blow right by you with no second thought. The others have had to move left just to keep up with Fox success as a business model
942694625696993280 2017-12-18 09:54:47 UTC <higgens_tom> @MrWalterShapiro @Edsall @JonahNRO @charlesmurray @pablo_danger @ICallahan1966 Yeah Fox is first rate if youre used to RT and other state run media sites! The lies Sean Hannity tells in one hour exceed the sum total for the big four in a year. Fox the Original Fake News!

940966943602946049 2017-12-13 15:29:36 UTC <higgens_tom> I think the only thing Sean Hannity has proven as a fact, is that hes a lunatic and wrong about most things he reports on. The really only amazing thing about him is that people still watch it.
940959797234601984 2017-12-13 15:01:12 UTC <higgens_tom> The people dont want 2 C billionaires & already flush with cash giant corporations get another tax break, adding another 1.5 trillion to the deficit for our kids to pay.

939173242895589376 2017-12-08 16:42:04 UTC <higgens_tom> @WilDonnelly Wasnt it the very night after the meeting with the Russians and with Dorko jr. the night Dorko started using the number 33,000 missing E-mails? Was that just a coincidence or did the Dorko just pull that number out of his ass??

It doesnt worry me nearly as much as this squinty eyed weasel in the WH who is now trying to start a war in the ME, anything to get away from his problems with Russia.

Which party has been responsible for huge increases in defense spending? Which party consistently votes in favor of big biz &the wealthy? Which party has made arms deals? Iraq? Afghanistan? Both R to blame for war!

934558925722148866 2017-11-25 23:06:25 UTC <higgens_tom> The Alabama player should have been ejected from the game no. 32 What he did was every bit as bad as targeting when he tried to break the QBs neck and ripped off his helmet as he was defenseless on the ground with another def player on top of him! Not Good!

915227298663731200 2017-10-03 14:49:26 UTC <higgens_tom> @adrienneelrod @JacobAWohl @UggManASG Our lame gun laws really helped 2stop all of the Mass shootings every one of which I believe were legally owned idiotic firearms 4retardates
