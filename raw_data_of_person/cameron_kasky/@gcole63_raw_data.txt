Also true, that amendment applies to the government. Much like how twitter can infringe on free speech all it wants because the amendment only applies to gov infringing.pic.twitter.com/e5XJZdON8G

Cost of ammunition to hunt. Cost of tent. Worse if you use a travel trailer. Cost of food. Cost of other camping gear. Cost of gasoline. Cost of winter clothing. Trust me, I was married to a hunter.

967465798091530240 2018-02-24 18:26:35 UTC <gcole63> @scully_sullivan I think hell eventually resign as well. Trump is a f**ing idiot.  Tillerson doesnt like him and his job is impossible to do with Trumps daughter continually inserting herself into his job. This would be funny if it were fiction.

967340523487768576 2018-02-24 10:08:47 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump @Sethvulca She never got a chance to get in there and do anything. She had one vote when she was a senator and 0 votes as Secretary of State. But she did champion it while the GOP is now trying to reduce healthcare.
967339033792716800 2018-02-24 10:02:52 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump @Sethvulca Pulling out was decided during Bush right? Bush signed the agreement with Iraq setting the withdrawal date. Obama tried to get the Iraqis to allow us to keep a residual force behind, but their parliament said no. We werent at war with them at that point. We couldnt force it.

962356211034161152 2018-02-10 16:02:55 UTC <gcole63> @NBCNews I agree. I grew up poor with three sisters. It would have devastated my parents. I didnt play soccer, take ballet, piano lessons, or even go to the prom because of money. I wasnt miserable. Uniforms are a good equalizer, but they should be affordable.

956270498320547840 2018-01-24 21:00:28 UTC <gcole63> @NBCNews @MarkByers17 We currently have a viable country. We have since its inception. Weve always taken in immigrants. This is not new.

956263286848106496 2018-01-24 20:31:48 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp Mexicans serve and die in OUR military.
956262856747397120 2018-01-24 20:30:06 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp OUR way of life is not diminished by the Mexicans living in this country.
956262517730258944 2018-01-24 20:28:45 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp You are a racist. I am not a rapist because of my heritage. My culture has enriched yours. It influences your art, your music, and has enhanced your genetic pool.
956261958432387072 2018-01-24 20:26:32 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @david_j_martino Im sorry youre not a fan of ACLU. Its done much for minority rights. Read its history and court battles won. Many of them affect you without your knowing. They dont create law, they litigate. Our court system of judges establishes the law. Many times it agrees with ACLU.
956260743178895360 2018-01-24 20:21:42 UTC <gcole63> @washingtonpost @JameyFunny No I cant, I can only hope in change. I believe change us coming.  While faint, there are signs of change coming. Progress is slow, I know, but dont lose hope. Losing ground in countries that are most progressive affects the rest of the world.
956260080923566080 2018-01-24 20:19:04 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp Of course it would. Its a human rights organization.
956227424592674816 2018-01-24 18:09:18 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp I think thats the crux of ACLUs involvement.
956225007885037568 2018-01-24 17:59:42 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @david_j_martino I think our question is THE question and the reason ACLU is taking the case.
956224758978260992 2018-01-24 17:58:42 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @david_j_martino It seems its a gray area that needs to be settled in court. More like a precedent setting case.
956223933723766784 2018-01-24 17:55:26 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @david_j_martino I dont know? Just curious.
956220791338582017 2018-01-24 17:42:57 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @david_j_martino Military court? I thought that was just for military personnel???
956220570785406976 2018-01-24 17:42:04 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @Simon2Sharp Because it sets a legal precedent for all American citizens, you included. If the law fails one, it fails us all.
956219637951119360 2018-01-24 17:38:22 UTC <gcole63> @ACLU @pshark47 They represent all people. If they lose their case, then theyre wrong, if they win, theyre right. Why are people afraid of the legal system?

Were not bringing it in, they are. From policing the bedrooms of gay people to trying to control womens bodies. Its there and is already part of the discussion. Im just pointing out the hypocrisy.
956213733457620992 2018-01-24 17:14:54 UTC <gcole63> @washingtonpost @JameyFunny Things are starting to change there.  True, theres a long journey ahead for them, but theres hope. We should focus on continuing to move our own country in a more progressive direction. Were not there yet.

908036609185947648 2017-09-13 18:36:12 UTC <gcole63> @InternetHippo @Condoc64 @TobiasBDog I doubt it was damaged. Read an article about how well it was built. It will still be there when Florida goes underwater. I plan to Scuba.

908035381223866368 2017-09-13 18:31:20 UTC <gcole63> @InternetHippo @NERRRRDS Seems commerce is thriving. Check out the market. It's been steadily climbing over the last 8 years.
908035096539578373 2017-09-13 18:30:12 UTC <gcole63> @InternetHippo @frozenblueber That only helps the rich. That tax doesn't apply to people with less than 5,000,000 in assets. Are you sure you didn't mean real estate tax?
908034515431415808 2017-09-13 18:27:53 UTC <gcole63> @jidk1187 @InternetHippo Sorry about your home. Unfortunately, can't do much but donate to Red Cross and wish you the best.

906895083756077056 2017-09-10 15:00:11 UTC <gcole63> @yashar @JewelsinMo @ArtworkKing I know it was after someone accused Yashar's article on sexual harassment of being the reason this kid died.

897947481496928256 2017-08-16 22:25:37 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC It's deeper. Every time a small business foregoes leasing space in favor of Amazon, people like Trump lose money. Rent increases prices.
897912316632506368 2017-08-16 20:05:53 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC @knot_donald I predict the next Real Estate bubble burst will be in commercial real estate. They're not adapting to e-commerce. They're a dinosaur.pic.twitter.com/8d3pkeFJmJ
897911506901245952 2017-08-16 20:02:40 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC @knot_donald When the last recession hit real estate, strip malls had higher vacancies. Rather than lower rent, they just let tenants fold. Sheer greed.
897911129355059202 2017-08-16 20:01:10 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC @knot_donald It's rent. Most of what you pay for is the vendors rent. This is why Trump cares. He's a developer taking a smaller cut now.

897908780985233408 2017-08-16 19:51:50 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC @knot_donald Well, maybe real estate developers like Trump should lower rents so businesses can compete with internet companies.
897908442551033856 2017-08-16 19:50:29 UTC <gcole63> @CNBC @rayrosewall No. That wouldn't make it to the states. It's just another federal excise tax.

897179704033132545 2017-08-14 19:34:44 UTC <gcole63> @yashar Fox needs to correct their article. They said he was convicted of defying a state judge's order. Fox F**k up.
897179252931543040 2017-08-14 19:32:57 UTC <gcole63> @yashar @MerrillLynched The 2011 order he defied was issued by  federal district judge, G. Murray Snow.
897179144357789696 2017-08-14 19:32:31 UTC <gcole63> @yashar @MerrillLynched I think the article is incorrect in that it says he was convicted of defying a state judge's order. Damn Fox reporters f**k everything up.
897178724390404096 2017-08-14 19:30:51 UTC <gcole63> @yashar The article said it was a state judge. That's incorrect. It was  federal district judge, G. Murray Snow who issued the order in 2011.
897176770771689472 2017-08-14 19:23:05 UTC <gcole63> @yashar @EmilianoLincoln Article says federal judge found him guilty for violating a State judge's order. Doesn't make any sense. ?????

897175978153132032 2017-08-14 19:19:56 UTC <gcole63> @yashar Yup, I thought so too, at first, because it was a state judge order he defied. It's complicated.

896268024402952192 2017-08-12 07:12:03 UTC <gcole63> @508gloryFelix @Im_TheAntiTrump It was a small crowd. There were very few women there. Comfort yourself in knowing none of those guys will be getting laid any time soon.

885609109269000192 2017-07-13 21:17:20 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @goaloa But IRS has been auditing him. They also have a criminal investigation unit with Special Agents like FBI does. They just don't leak at IRS.
885608543168086016 2017-07-13 21:15:05 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @Eileen_Gaughan He can request the audit files also.
885608392840028160 2017-07-13 21:14:29 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @bdylan234 Ha ha, geeks. I'm an accountant. They teach us this.
885607939473420288 2017-07-13 21:12:41 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @SueBee0619 Yes, as previously mentioned, it's not a subpoena. It's just a court order to IRS. Gov. Can't subpoena what it already has.pic.twitter.com/IigTpOp8Lx
885607220943101952 2017-07-13 21:09:49 UTC <gcole63> @xeni @chrislhayes @trabernlaw I think he can get the audit files with a court order also. His audit must be a real pain.
885606848342118400 2017-07-13 21:08:21 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @jimmerSF Not if he cheated. But they're not very bright.
885605689497759744 2017-07-13 21:03:44 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @Not_A_Banker He's been under audit forever. They must keep finding things that are wrong.
885605061375647745 2017-07-13 21:01:15 UTC <gcole63> @chrislhayes @IvanTheK @Jmamaspesh IRS gives it to them directly if there's a court order.

885603595797708800 2017-07-13 20:55:25 UTC <gcole63> @Airotcivyarrum @chrislhayes I'm sure he can. But IRS has their own special agents. There might be more going on that we don't know. IRS isn't prone to leaks like FBI.

880420338185551874 2017-06-29 13:39:00 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump Mid sogyny. Unbecoming of a Pres. If your response to someone bleeding is to insult them, no wonder you're ok with taking healthcare away.
880391236917395456 2017-06-29 11:43:22 UTC <gcole63> @JoelOsteen @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Let's add guns to the recipe. NRA is a voice of the gun manufacturing industry. manipulating the poor into voting for their own poverty.
880319518706290689 2017-06-28 06:58:23 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Blood is the consequence, not the cause.
880319300384440320 2017-06-28 06:57:31 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Treasure, same as oil. Oil is just today's treasure in war torn Middle East countries.
880319011900112896 2017-06-28 06:56:22 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Religion has historically been front and center in most wars.
880318301565460480 2017-06-28 06:53:33 UTC <gcole63> @JoelOsteen @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 The two, oil (represents money in the Middle East), and religion are intertwined.
880317921242660868 2017-06-28 06:52:02 UTC <gcole63> @JoelOsteen @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Into believing we're going to destroy their churches and take their guns away. They, in turn, vote against their own interests.
880317472699633664 2017-06-28 06:50:15 UTC <gcole63> @JoelOsteen @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 There's a type of idiot easily manipulated into being a foot soldier for greedy. In the US, the GOP manipulates evangelicals by scaring them
880317234639282176 2017-06-28 06:49:18 UTC <gcole63> @JoelOsteen @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 It's the cause of war. Oil greed is behind ISIS. The two are intertwined.
880164875762253824 2017-06-28 20:43:53 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters @danny_cdn1968 @dcnblues Funny Danny. Kind of lost on the rest.
880163992601153536 2017-06-28 20:40:23 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters @JosephMarsilio1 Religion and oil are the causes of war in this modern world. We don't need either.
880162476926550016 2017-06-28 20:34:21 UTC <gcole63> @Reuters Breaking them seems to be ok if your name is Trump. Bearing false witness, adultery, coveting someone else's wive, theft, and likely more.

880155253110222853 2017-06-28 20:05:39 UTC <gcole63> @jkarsh That video only proves that CNN's workforce is diverse. He shared an opinion I don't agree with. It's like that in every work place.

880134060235825152 2017-06-28 18:41:26 UTC <gcole63> @CBSNews @JanetBrzinski Janet assumes much. "Bad for them in the next life"? It's bad for them in this one. Why would California be concerned with such nonsense.

880126832749592577 2017-06-28 18:12:43 UTC <gcole63> @hardhouz13 That happened to me last night. I didn't do anything.
880126513449902080 2017-06-28 18:11:27 UTC <gcole63> @bobcesca_go And if by chance it fails, blame it on the Democrats, even though they control nothing.

879728580481044483 2017-06-27 15:50:12 UTC <gcole63> @deborah_berned Jesus apparently provided health care to all that needed it. You're a liar when you say you live according to the Bible.

879404064366133248 2017-06-26 18:20:42 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @Theresa78375601 Still an EO and not a law.

879378800307351552 2017-06-26 16:40:18 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls Congress would have to enact a law. They can't agree on anything.
879378510682308608 2017-06-26 16:39:09 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @jgmonte922 Also, nothing happened. What threat?
879377980329410564 2017-06-26 16:37:03 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @realAngryBob So glad younger generations are not as hateful as you dinosaurs. They will change this.
879377679849357313 2017-06-26 16:35:51 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @adamnpeck @russnet It will.
879377402165460992 2017-06-26 16:34:45 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @Theresa78375601 This was not a law. This was a temporary executive order.

879376214552584193 2017-06-26 16:30:02 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @lucille46904543 It's a ruling on a temporary order.

879373921274830849 2017-06-26 16:20:55 UTC <gcole63> @KellyannePolls @NabilaHaniss I thought this was temporary. You all are acting like this is permanent.

878580696561745920 2017-06-24 11:48:55 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump He did.
878578893308829696 2017-06-24 11:41:46 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @chaos_4ever They did. They just can't reveal methods. FBI  knows what they're doing. You and Hannity do not. I trust FBI. I do not trust Hannity.

878570938924539904 2017-06-24 11:10:09 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @chaos_4ever They meaning the FBI. Yes. They SAID it was the Russians that Hacked the DNC. FBI NEVER said it was a leak. It was always a Hack.
878570026873176065 2017-06-24 11:06:32 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @chaos_4ever I'm calling it debunked now. There are a lot of unsolved murders in America. Police have got this. Hannity does not.

878280190840889345 2017-06-23 15:54:49 UTC <gcole63> @thehill The police have made their statements and stand by them. You're distrust of them is irrational.

878278462036779008 2017-06-23 15:47:57 UTC <gcole63> @thehill Burying evidence? You're accusing agents of wrongdoing? They work hard and smart to keep us safe and this is the thanks they get.
878278009748299780 2017-06-23 15:46:09 UTC <gcole63> @JulianAssange @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell How would you or anyone know what they're on to? Agents are well trained and good at their job. You think you'd do better from an armchair?
878277155876032513 2017-06-23 15:42:46 UTC <gcole63> @JulianAssange @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 Now we're on to deep state conspiracy? CIA agents are as loyal to this country as any other citizen. Why accuse these agents of malfeasance?
878276366545764352 2017-06-23 15:39:38 UTC <gcole63> @JulianAssange @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell I find it odd you think our law enforcement isn't up to the task of rooting this out.
878275889351360512 2017-06-23 15:37:44 UTC <gcole63> @thehill Well, Law Enforcement did. All statements from law enforcement combined debunk this nonsense.
878275621004103680 2017-06-23 15:36:40 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @chaos_4ever Law enforcement and Even GOP have acknowledged the Russians hacked DNC. Keep up. You think Hannity knows more than FBI?  You're irrational.
878274710751948802 2017-06-23 15:33:03 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 I'm going with what law enforcement is telling us, not with Hannity.
878274404177764353 2017-06-23 15:31:50 UTC <gcole63> @DNC @thehill @AquamanINaz DNC doesn't have to prove anything. Law enforcement does and they're confident it was the Russians. Your argument is nonsensical.
878274121443835904 2017-06-23 15:30:42 UTC <gcole63> @DNC @thehill @AquamanINaz DNC isn't lying about anything. The statements came from law enforcement. You're making no sense.
878270106899365888 2017-06-23 15:14:45 UTC <gcole63> @JulianAssange @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 "All but said" let him present evidence and testify.
878269680200294402 2017-06-23 15:13:03 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 Because, law enforcement has stated they're confident Russia hacked DNC. Why do you distrust our Federal Law Enforcement Agencies?
878269054837866496 2017-06-23 15:10:34 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Those agencies have methods they're unable to disclose. They're doing their job. I believe Russia hacked DNC because law enforcement is sure
878268586141155330 2017-06-23 15:08:43 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Yes they can, if they have a warrant. They haven't done that because they're not idiots chasing down conspiracy leads.
878268221970759680 2017-06-23 15:07:16 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Imply? That's a conclusion you drew from nothing.
878268016798031873 2017-06-23 15:06:27 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell What exactly did Wikileaks say to support your theory? Besides, It's not about believing Wiki Leaks, it's about believing FBI.
878267427867340800 2017-06-23 15:04:06 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 Pretty ugly at the White House too.
878267264037928960 2017-06-23 15:03:27 UTC <gcole63> @DNC @thehill @AquamanINaz If any law enforcement thought there was something on there, they would have gotten a warrant.
878267035075072000 2017-06-23 15:02:33 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Grow up. Several agencies concur with confidence, DNC was hacked by Russians. I'll trust them before I believe Hannity.
878266463005495296 2017-06-23 15:00:16 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell If they want it, they can get a judge to sign a warrant for it. They won't, no cause. Gowdy could subpoena it too. He hasn't? Why not?
878265826633068545 2017-06-23 14:57:45 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Someone wants idiots to Believe this crap.
878265644147326976 2017-06-23 14:57:01 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell He's looking for information? That's what you have. Has he offered evidence?
878265259085094912 2017-06-23 14:55:29 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell Really, you draw conclusions from nothing.
878264642178400256 2017-06-23 14:53:02 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell And you believe Hannity and not the police. You're a blind nut.
878264448661635072 2017-06-23 14:52:16 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 It's not. Have you not paid attention to testimony by Federal Law enforcement. They hacked DNC. Keep up.
878264147544231936 2017-06-23 14:51:04 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell But the police do say they're investigating it and have given hannity nothing to support his nonsense. Trust the police a little.
878263720530464768 2017-06-23 14:49:22 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell That's just nonsense. Law enforcement is confident Russia Hacked DNC. I trust FBI while you Trust a TV mouth piece. You're irrational.
878263299195916288 2017-06-23 14:47:42 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell He's an idiot. He's just perpetuating a conspiracy theory. He has zero evidence to support this theory. I trust the police to do their job.
878262803802411009 2017-06-23 14:45:44 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 There's nothing to support it. Absolutely nothing. That debunks it.
878262572134260736 2017-06-23 14:44:49 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell @TomStark913 The police have made statements saying they don't know who did it. They've never suggested this nonsensical theory.
878262248849907712 2017-06-23 14:43:32 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @TomStark913 @RealRyanCornell The FBI isn't investigating his death, the police are and they've made statements. Google them. They don't know who murdered him.
878261880636059649 2017-06-23 14:42:04 UTC <gcole63> @thehill @RealRyanCornell Police are working on it along with other crimes committed in the area. If you think you can do a better job, feel free to do it yourself.

877929226984345600 2017-06-22 16:40:13 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump Think, they can only make requests. They don't approve their own requests. And how do they know who until after the unmasking. Keep dreaming

875405769654456320 2017-06-15 17:32:54 UTC <gcole63> @realDonaldTrump That was a typical bully tweet. You're inciting violence.
875395557207924736 2017-06-15 16:52:19 UTC <gcole63> @AthenaCNN @CNN @Heckuva_Guy Because he's President. He handles pressure from the press poorly. In fact, he's handling everything poorly.
875394115235495937 2017-06-15 16:46:35 UTC <gcole63> @AthenaCNN @CNN I think his response was clear. He's both, under investigation and he's a jerk.
875393530616717312 2017-06-15 16:44:16 UTC <gcole63> @CNN They're all sitting in his cabinet.

875392340768116736 2017-06-15 16:39:32 UTC <gcole63> @cmclymer @Drawjordan @edabny54 I truly felt for Hillary in having a nation of men trying to crucify her. Worse was the betrayal of women who called her a Bit@h.
875391904501841920 2017-06-15 16:37:48 UTC <gcole63> @cmclymer @Drawjordan @edabny54 All because they said I "walked around like I owned the place". What's harder is the women in the office that blindly supported these nuts.
875391611890302976 2017-06-15 16:36:38 UTC <gcole63> @cmclymer @Drawjordan @edabny54 I'm still reeling over a coordinated effort by two men in my office to oust me from my position.

874950263089405953 2017-06-14 11:22:53 UTC <gcole63> @CNNPolitics @KellyannePolls Then that just means they'll work with professional skepticism and not be easily pressed to drop the investigation. What are you afraid of.

873642151376150528 2017-06-10 20:44:55 UTC <gcole63> @MuslimIQ I know, right? It's not like the majority of congress are Muslim and getting ready to pass Shariah law. They're just idiots without a cause.
