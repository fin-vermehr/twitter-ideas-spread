940838481760342016 2017-12-12 06:59:08 UTC <lindhays> Should we trust @DNC again? Twice now they've lost presidencies, uncontested! They're clueless. Gore should have sued and @DNC was too credulous on Trump. Now they should be on the treason issue. They should dare call it treason.https://twitter.com/AamerISmad/status/940798198297317377
940835933393510401 2017-12-12 06:49:01 UTC <lindhays> @MsPackyetti @DNC will never do this, don't trust them. They have essentially forfeited 2 presidencies now. For how much $? There needs to be a raw, real data release so we can see where our donations go. How many 1%ers fund the DNC? How many banksters? We need, imo, democratic socialism.
