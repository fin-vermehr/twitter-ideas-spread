959484929053687809 2018-02-02 17:53:28 UTC <RichOaks> Ok, so I read this, and it does make some clear accusations of partisanship, but it's really just an op-ed on letterhead. Check the web for analysis of it, and you will see that many "facts" in here are disputed. It looks to me like a partisan attack alleging a partisan attack.https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/959481600709931008

947179487837515781 2017-12-30 18:56:02 UTC <RichOaks> Hi @ericgarland, your tweets make me feel like someone is doing something, but wondering how you suggest we keep ourselves/others motivated when it seems stuff is being taken care of by the IC. Do you feel like you have to toe a line to raise spirits, but not discourage action?
942101279463092224 2017-12-16 18:37:03 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi @Nakamurdahh Oh noooooooo

936466808164552704 2017-11-30 05:27:40 UTC <RichOaks> @Alexander_Avg @SadiqKhan @CatyKean Dude @gehrig38 you were my hero when with sox. Cant you get into politics without running on the hatred platform? Is it really the only way you think you can get elected? Bet you could do better promoting your qualities and strengths, with some help from your hall of fame career
936465121592926209 2017-11-30 05:20:58 UTC <RichOaks> So @comcast when you no doubt DO charge more for particular websites, or throttle the speed of others after a year or so, am I supposed to like you MORE because you spammed my feed with promoted tweets? Or are you hoping for monopoly so I can't get away? #NetNeutrality
936350099164291072 2017-11-30 21:43:54 UTC <RichOaks> This is totally nuts. This is separate from my typical political re/tweet. This was an organized effort to fake public support to end net neutrality. Now who would want to do that?

If your attention lasts only 1 second and you miss it, then shame on you, not them. Conservatives benefit just as much from #freeandopeninternet

927718294504779777 2017-11-06 02:04:12 UTC <RichOaks> Guns are to stop bad people, right? What if you could stop them with a stun gun? Why is loss of life preferred in this scenario? #nra #texas
927717439672119296 2017-11-06 02:00:48 UTC <RichOaks> ? for those who think #Antifa killed innocent Texans-when you heard that sources were photoshopped or fake, did it change your mind?
927678347483770880 2017-11-06 23:25:28 UTC <RichOaks> Please pretend #texas victims are your family. You'd find out the complete truth re: means, and motive, and would work to fix it.

927673976683364353 2017-11-06 23:08:06 UTC <RichOaks> 3/ maybe this means rethinking gun laws, maybe it means new ways to assess mental health (and provide help), or maybe it's a mix of both
927673674219577349 2017-11-06 23:06:53 UTC <RichOaks> 2/ Lets honor those fallen by 1) Having the courage to learn the whole truth, and 2) trying to fix it before there's a next time.
927673226393681921 2017-11-06 23:05:07 UTC <RichOaks> 1/ Terrible news out of Texas. In a time when healing is needed, desperately, there are those that exploit terror to divide via fake news.

919017705293873153 2017-10-13 01:51:10 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi Was thinking about this today-should require any public speaking by officials include debate. No more unopposed shouting into the void
919016209152167936 2017-10-13 01:45:13 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi Everyone who serves public. They need to be paid more to compete with industry, and have better ethics checks/balances

919008407910342656 2017-10-13 01:14:13 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi Second, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's not age, maybe it's IQ, and lie detector tests to be eligible to run

919004207805554689 2017-10-13 00:57:32 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi Im with you though-allow discrimination against 1 group is slippery slope-Can't help but wonder what is needed to defend democracy though
919003427480440832 2017-10-13 00:54:26 UTC <RichOaks> @kurteichenwald Kurt I love you but I hate numbers like this-sensational amount to post but divided by 300mil people could be $8/person-Need more specifics
919002427877134337 2017-10-13 00:50:27 UTC <RichOaks> @RJAmi Fair point but I have a feeling that when there aren't more pressing issues, science could prove that old = bad for evaluating risk v reward

908889617763577858 2017-09-15 03:05:45 UTC <RichOaks> @BretBaier @thehill @MykingRichard1 This is the most incomprehensible tweet I've ever read
908883224318939136 2017-09-15 02:40:21 UTC <RichOaks> 3/ which means the party isn't afraid of public opinion 'getting in the way', but that those facing reelection will cave w/ public outcry
908882472439549952 2017-09-15 02:37:22 UTC <RichOaks> 2/ But the only reason I can fathom that this tactic would be taken is that GOP leadership don't want their senators pressured by public
908882150094721025 2017-09-15 02:36:05 UTC <RichOaks> 1) Yes. This thread is great, and points out what seems like a purposeful campaign to minimize possibility of ACA repeal happeninghttps://twitter.com/benwikler/status/908872659773075458

906349498414321664 2017-09-08 02:52:14 UTC <RichOaks> @chorye I mean, this stuff is tracked right? They can't get away with this, right? 1 in 2 people in US are affected, some possibly forever
906347600009408512 2017-09-08 02:44:41 UTC <RichOaks> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Buddy look in the mirror. Liberal and conservative relate to policy direction. How are your questions of any substance?

906343948997853184 2017-09-08 02:30:11 UTC <RichOaks> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews It sounds like you have no need for opposing views. They just get in the way, amirite? I mean, using the word ignorant is kind of ironic :)
906338523502047233 2017-09-08 02:08:37 UTC <RichOaks> @TuckerCarlson If I were @FoxNews and my ratings depended solely on hocking hate, I TOO wld find most ridic people & pretend they represented "the enemy"
