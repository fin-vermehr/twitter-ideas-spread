971545365911621632 2018-03-07 00:37:20 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @BlowUpRadio I believe the issue was more that he dumped her for his ex and if I remember correctly it was on live TV.
971544282837512192 2018-03-07 00:33:02 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @BlowUpRadio There are so many tweets about what happened and it's nothing. I saw on the news this morning. Long story short the final girl got dumped for the ex. The internet went insane (shocker) like it's high school. I asked, out loud!!! "Why is this news? Why am I hearing about it?"
971542442288799745 2018-03-07 00:25:43 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> If you're more upset about #TheBachelor than you are about the Tax Scam Bill, Parkland, Russia, Gerrymandering, Medicare and Social Security cuts, the travel ban, the wall, voter ID laws & the constant attacks on the LGBTQ community & women's health rights you ARE the problem.

966463912509132800 2018-02-21 00:05:27 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> New #MLB proposal to let trailing team use 3 best batters in 9th is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. This is baseball, not Sportscenter, not a video game, baseball! Are they trying to ruin the game!? It's ridiculous! The commissioners gotta go.   #MLBNow #BaseballIsBack
966461703335620609 2018-02-21 23:56:40 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @MLBNetwork @Al_Leiter22 If 1994 strike doesn't happen Fred McGriff is over 500 homeruns. Talk about getting robbed. Never heard a PED accusation. Where's the votes from the "PED players shouldn't go in I'm not voting for them" crowd? 23 percent!? Blasphemy!
965938360459153413 2018-02-20 13:17:06 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> Thinking about #MLBHOF have 2 thoughts. 1, no strike in 94 = 500+ HR by McGriff should-be HOFer. 2, 500 HR still a special number many of the recent members under PED suspicion or confessed already, the game has changed since then.   @MLBNetwork #MLBNHotStove #MLB #BaseballIsBack
965731354762719234 2018-02-19 23:34:32 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> No one ever gives @rayliotta enough credit for his amazing performance in Field of Dreams. He gives depth to Shoeless Joe and humanizes playing a ghost giving the film it's credibility. If you don't buy Mr Liotta's Shoeless Joe you'll never buy into the film.

965388009163165698 2018-02-18 00:50:12 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> Major League 2 on @MLBNetwork the ending would be an epic Game 7. Multiple lead changes, big moon shot homerun putting the home team ahead in the 8th. Top 9 2 outs bases full for the big bat...the drama!

I was able to lyrically verbalize what young people have been saying for a few years now. Disillusioned Blues is a #Millennials song.

It was a part of an abandoned rock opera from 2015, a very Broadway style rock opera. It was an alternate song for the female protagonist but I changed the lyric to make it a better pop song.

941869635418370048 2017-12-15 03:16:34 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @Yankees @xiggy89x You don't need to trade him. If he refuses a minor league assignment he forfeits the contract. Hopefully they force his hand.
941856343937429505 2017-12-15 02:23:45 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @Yankees Im not wild about him either to be honest.
941853451708960768 2017-12-15 02:12:16 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> The fact the #GOP wants to shut down #Mueller so badly leads me to believe there's something big he's getting close to. If this was a witch hunt, they wouldn't be against the investigation turning up nothing. There's literally no argument for shutting it down if nothing's there.
941852577272037376 2017-12-15 02:08:47 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @Yankees Neither. Id rather them give Sheffield a shot at the rotation. If it doesn't work out then they can deal at the deadline. Someone will be available in July. I'm just not sure Cole is worth what it'll take to get him in the long run. Especially if Hicks can't stay healthy.
941816701720473600 2017-12-15 23:46:14 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> In all seriousness I'd be shocked if Mark Hamil didn't get the #Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for #StarWarsTheLastJedi he was incredible. I can't think any other acting performance (I'm sure many were great) as memorable since Heath Ledger in Dark Knight.
941812716657770496 2017-12-15 23:30:24 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> @Yankees please don't do Garret Cole deal. He isn't worth both Fraizer and Chase Adams. And get Ellsbury off the team, he's terrible 30% of the time, hurt 45% of the time, mediocre 20% of the time and good but not worth the money you're paying him 5% of the time.  #yankees

Me outside NJ: WHOA WHOA WHOA THUNDER ROAD OH THUNDER ROAD OH THUNDER ROAD!   Me in North Dakota: Why am I in North fucking Dakota? Bro, do you even pork roll?  #Jersey #Proud #PorkRoll
935669263708381184 2017-11-28 00:38:31 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> A move completely void of class, I feel no need to watch any of the remaining games. Extremely disappointed, this in no way benefits the organization; it only hurts @Giants fans! When do pitchers and catchers report?  #EliManning #NYGiants #Football #BenMcAdoo #NFL #NFLWeek13
935633528192192513 2017-11-28 22:16:31 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> Whatever you think of Eli he's synonymous with the team. He's the choice of the fans. This move is like the Yankees replacing @PaulONeillYES with Rondel White. It's bad for the team and the fans. Let Eli take his final bow!   #EliManning #NYGiants #NFL #NFLWeek13 #Football
935631564519694339 2017-11-28 22:08:42 UTC <DiegoMusicNJ> I wonder if Ben Mcadoo knows how much the fans hate him. If he had any honor he'd let Eli finish the season as starter and resign after week 17   #giants #EliManning #BenMcadoo #NFL #NFLWeek13 #NYGiants #NYG #Football
