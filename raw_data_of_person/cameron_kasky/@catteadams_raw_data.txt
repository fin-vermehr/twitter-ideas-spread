971579818637631490 2018-03-07 02:54:14 UTC <catteadams> @cameron_kasky I think WE should require them to not take money and WE should set the limits of how much they can take. We have finally found our collective power again. WE could totally end this BS. YES. We could. YES. We can.
971579140485754880 2018-03-07 02:51:32 UTC <catteadams> @destineybleu Frankly, I think that's perfect. Some ppl need to be trained to be considerate. HUZZAH!

Dodd/Frank? I'm sick to death of GOP
971285009268183041 2018-03-06 07:22:46 UTC <catteadams> Trump: We're doing a very very deep study. No. You're not. That department of the govt. has not received a dollar and they won't. @realDonaldTrump  My god you're a sick fuck. I've never been happier that Natalie Cole set fire to your stupid bungalow. #MaraLago #ShitHole
971283844069576704 2018-03-06 07:18:08 UTC <catteadams> @cher To not see the majesty, intelligence and importance of this amazing creature is to ignore your own humanity. To see this gorgeous creature as just a thing to exterminate is the lowest form of consciousness I can even think of or imagine. Pls lets identify them, and call them out!
971267129080238080 2018-03-06 06:11:43 UTC <catteadams> @xdelmar59 @TitusNation No one said criminals were smart. In fact it's only they themselves who think they are. And they still feel that way,..... in jail.

970896587839881216 2018-03-05 05:39:19 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman Jen you are too nice
970892093739565056 2018-03-05 05:21:28 UTC <catteadams> @50inaug @kbeninato Gotta admit tho, it saves time. In a big family there arent even commas
970889231101968384 2018-03-05 05:10:05 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman I get those. But they add, and fat. So, hey, not so bad.
970859262929850369 2018-03-05 03:11:00 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter I do. Smells like vested interest. And that's always about follow the money. Someone benefits when someone else loses. Always. Especially when it comes to govt. regulation. Few altruistic things seem to pass. Hands are always in the cookie jar. So I do what I can locally 4 change
970858768136224769 2018-03-05 03:09:02 UTC <catteadams> @ONDCP @lizbethkb @AGPamBondi @reversechapter I should think there would be a standard of values in med. and pharm. that would address chronic illness fairly.  But again, it was greed, avarice, and corruption that changed that landscape. Disgusting.
970858091674660864 2018-03-05 03:06:21 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter This has been a real eye opening year for me. I have never thought of our givt as being so corrupt so self interested and so not interested in real constituents, but rather their corp. sponsors
970857576962273281 2018-03-05 03:04:18 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter I know where you are coming from. It's a huge sweeping attempt to fix a social ill with legislation. PPL feel desperate. But again, research shows the clearest path to opiate recovery is treatment, and we shouldn't treat chronic pain patients like criminals. It's an overreach
970856932926869504 2018-03-05 03:01:45 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter The govt has never made me fearful. Its usually too slow in doing anything to affect change. LOL I tend to go by research and studies. I have done a lot of studying on poverty.  But in general I'm with you. Less govt.
970856273125113856 2018-03-05 02:59:07 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Actually research on poverty shows we haven't been getting along just fine regarding child marriage and poverty. The poor stay poor or get poorer and the multi-generational poverty deepens with child marriage which affects all of us. It ultimately costs us all.
970848316459225089 2018-03-05 02:27:30 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter We have evolved over time to change out understanding what "adult" means. That's no different than other things. When you know more you can do better. What is the existing law age? I don't know it.
970845658948108288 2018-03-05 02:16:57 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter There's always someone who will disagree w/ any kind of policy for all because individual cases vary so much. But in general, it's meant to help all. Will some be hurt? Maybe. But it's a "greater good" thing, isn't it? RE: marriage, I should think adulthood should be a requisite
970844906578067456 2018-03-05 02:13:57 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter I guess my point is that children shouldn't be able to marry. States differ in ages but if policy has to be set to regulate it nationally & change it so be it. Because poverty & ignorance drives it. What's wrong with a law preventing a child to marry a rapist anyway? Who's hurt?

970836614338375682 2018-03-05 01:41:00 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Child marriage is about tremendous generational poverty and ignorance. That anyone would seek to end child marriage could only be a good thing.  Perhaps if you were the one who had to bear children as a child you might think differently. I dont know what pork is in that bill tho.

This time however, they seem 2 B crawling like snails...and it's taken longer to rehab it than to build the original. COME ON. Went thru B.C. to see the progress while under construction a few months back. Not much done

970053098012950528 2018-03-03 21:47:35 UTC <catteadams> @rabiasquared The PBS or BBC show, about the kids coming together in free zones to play and do homework, Palestinians and Jews in Israel, was just a fantastic program. And it deeply affected the kids. And that's where we start...the little ones...before they get all indoctrinated.

969353093929304065 2018-03-01 23:26:01 UTC <catteadams> @JoshontheGo I'm sorry I won't be able to make it after all.
969352869974392832 2018-03-01 23:25:08 UTC <catteadams> @KamalaHarris I loved Shirley Chisholm. One of the bravest, clearest women I have ever witnessed. Smart, savvy, and absolutely resolute in her quest for justice and truth. I'm so glad to read this today! It's time for an honor for Shirley Chisholm! A great woman!
969351694554300416 2018-03-01 23:20:28 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle She 2/a perfectionist and therefore didn't want anything that wasn't perfect getting out. She was obsessive about controlling her output &not having BS bootleg tapes out there. I can understnd that. My problem was that she was not kind about it. I had no idea it wasn't allowed
969341360951107584 2018-03-01 22:39:24 UTC <catteadams> @jennafabulous You're my hera!
969340867067592705 2018-03-01 22:37:26 UTC <catteadams> Whoa. Time to ask the evangelical right. they have the most bizarre way of justifying evil I have ever seen. Can't imagine the wild spin they would put on this one.https://twitter.com/MuslimIQ/status/969339626690416640
969339973131522048 2018-03-01 22:33:53 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle He has a great deal to hide. Thus the NDA's as a matter of course. Not uncommon in business anymore. Celeb's use them all the time 2. While working with Tracy Chapman we were NEVER ever allowed to record anything. Not even a rehearsal. Nothing. But she wasn't an evil basted. LOL
969338051817172992 2018-03-01 22:26:15 UTC <catteadams> @Sen_JoeManchin Do you actually need to know someone personally who committed lethal crimes with an AR 15 to ban them? Absurd. Are you taking NRA money too? Step down. We don't need anymore truly ignorant ppl like you in govt. And enuf death from AR 15'shttp://www.newsweek.com/joe-manchin-ar-15-ban-democrat-824444
969336060751654912 2018-03-01 22:18:20 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @LiberalUSA1 And they chased Reagan's. Remember star wars? LOL..Oh those goofy Reagan shenanigan years.http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/19/opinion/the-star-wars-hoax.html
969335367756169217 2018-03-01 22:15:35 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer That would inspire me to believe in political justice again. And frankly to Miss @TomiLahren , you should worry about who you offend...have you not seen the roll out at the WH lately? No one's immune child, no one. Watch your mouth.
969330978391973888 2018-03-01 21:58:09 UTC <catteadams> @andylassner Congrats! I pray my nephew gets clean soon. So many relapses. I love him so much. And I know how hard it is. Now I have a great example to show him. Thank you my friend. 
969326538440171520 2018-03-01 21:40:30 UTC <catteadams> @Conquistador314 Me too. The problem with Twitter is we can't hear tone.  However the maid HAD just left. lol
969155030249910273 2018-03-01 10:18:59 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz They would be correct in that desire! Oh how I wish I was trailing along on this one! But, gigs all wknd. Howevr we don't miss out, musicians party on Tuesdays. LOL & with a mom in law in Oceanside, we have our great MEX, craft beer places & Pub Diego haunts that never fail.
969140319064240128 2018-03-01 09:20:32 UTC <catteadams> @firepfeiffer1 But we can vote ppl out and do better. We can always do better. But we have to be active and never let up. Because they don't. They always come out. ALWAYS. We must take a card from their playbook.
969136973548941312 2018-03-01 09:07:14 UTC <catteadams> @firepfeiffer1 That is astonishing. But I am sure it's not the only state that is this partisan. Not by a long shot. And even if it's not legally allowed in other states, I'm sure ppl are pressured out in other ways. Politics has always been a dirty business, so nothing surprises me anymore.
969135517714464768 2018-03-01 09:01:27 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz Yup. Same thing! And have a great vaca in beautiful San Diego! No matter what you do or where you go it's just fabulous!
969135211324751872 2018-03-01 09:00:14 UTC <catteadams> @donlemon Happy Birthday! Wakanda forever! Enjoy the show!  &&&&& Have a blessed and wonderful celebration! We just love ya! #DonLemon #FAN #muchAppreciation
969126275917869056 2018-03-01 08:24:44 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz You know...it probably won't be much if it does rain...and it's not we're out waking around in it..Not usually in San diego..we're going, doing, indoors...seeing stuff and having fun...! Too bad you're not going to be in Palm Springs area...Doing a concert. :)
969125133494317056 2018-03-01 08:20:11 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Everyone who works for him signs a NDA. I didn't have to because I was there with Natalie Cole. We were invited performers...not real employees...you know..in, out, sauerkraut.
969124789481697281 2018-03-01 08:18:49 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Mara Lago is a an ostentatious place...a Southern "breakers" built by Marjorie Merriweather Post..built in 20's...gold and marble everywhere.  Truly fascinating history. Check it out.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-mar-a-lago-180965214/
969123052192595968 2018-03-01 08:11:55 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Yes. Concerts.  Also NYC concerts.  The Uber rich & the shakers and movers of NYC parties as well. He seemed to me to B an outsider looking in desperate to be included. He wasn't allowed into the Uber class. No. He is a contradiction until you see him over and over again.
969121887665008640 2018-03-01 08:07:18 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Did a lot of NYC parties where he, no exaggeration he held a sort of court. That is until we were among the TRULY NYC, rich.  THEY didn't give him the time of day.  However he would arrive with his OWN press and the next day you'd think he owned the damn event, by the coverage.
969120740879446016 2018-03-01 08:02:44 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer NOW THAT was a good one!
969120352835026946 2018-03-01 08:01:12 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz Sometimes U are so damn cute.  Dunk elbow in water for a good while. Push it into a sink...let it sit a bit, it will sink in or not sink in...somethings are water resistant, meaning it can keep you dry for a while, and it will roll off a bit but after a while it sinks in.   GL
969080069162352642 2018-02-28 05:21:07 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle I have some stories. Worked at Mara Lago several times. He was awful. And very predatory. Thank God i was too old for him by then. HAHAHAHAHAHAH And still Yuk.
969078581677604864 2018-02-28 05:15:13 UTC <catteadams> @AaronFullerton It's Bye Felicia....for Hope Hicks.
969078019921911808 2018-02-28 05:12:59 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle I have never seen it. NEVER. He is the most self unaware person I have ever met. And completely unconcerned about it too. He is ALWAYS thinking about what he wants 2 boast about while U R talking. Doesn't know how to actively listen. I saw nothing but self interest in his eyes.
969077024647102464 2018-02-28 05:09:01 UTC <catteadams> @car_nove Beautiful.  The older you get the more you will appreciate the thoughtfulness, and kindness you just brought to those people. We all want to be seen. And a thank you goes such a long way on some days....often just when you need it too.
969076184557395968 2018-02-28 05:05:41 UTC <catteadams> OOOOOoooopppppsie. But then, none of his tweets age well.https://twitter.com/KarenMKunkle/status/969072725284278273
969075876049518597 2018-02-28 05:04:28 UTC <catteadams> @k_Bryer Quoting my gynecologist  Me: But, but,...how  did I even get this? I'm not sexually active. Her: "It's a doidy woild."  Still cracks me up and that was 25 years ago.
969069608421400576 2018-02-28 04:39:33 UTC <catteadams> @Conquistador314 Maid just left, dude. I don't do dishes either.
969069091553034241 2018-02-28 04:37:30 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @JoeBada Your info is wrong. Better fact check that hot mess you're serving up.
969068832550629376 2018-02-28 04:36:28 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Damn that's astute. It's the weirdest thing eh? You end up sorta pitying him because he is so insecure and desperately wants to impress. He doesn't our need pity, or sympathy but somehow U feel sorry for him.  Never stops selling.  He also has a sorta rough charm as well.  Weird
969055343631253505 2018-02-28 03:42:52 UTC <catteadams> @marcushjohnson The whole concept of woke is dumb. I hate the term. No one wakes. We evolve hopefully into better ppl and prove it by our actions over time.  It's not a happening. Boom. Now I'm woke. It doesn't work that way. But that's how it's often described. That's language for ya, too. 
969054412898385920 2018-02-28 03:39:10 UTC <catteadams> @laurenduca HELL TO THE YES. I had to answer for the dumb, young, ridiculous, crap I pulled. No one said, awwww...she didn't know...she was just 29 yrs old.
969052793083379712 2018-02-28 03:32:44 UTC <catteadams> There is no such thing as an ugly cry. There is only the soul crying out from pain and crying out for comfort. It isn't about pretty, or polite. Let it out anyway you can...or it turns to bitterness, and fear of feelings. We can accept those who cry out in pain, just fine.
969051394144591872 2018-02-28 03:27:11 UTC <catteadams> @PressSec If that's the most talented and skilled person you've ever met you neeeeed to get around more. I'm sure if you want some of what Hope Hicks has, you can resign for more "family time" too. MMMMMMmmmm BUH BYE
969050332763373568 2018-02-28 03:22:58 UTC <catteadams> @MotherJones And absolutely NO ONE is surprised. Pshhhhttttt!
969050168543727616 2018-02-28 03:22:18 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Damn straight. I'm first.
969049941648728065 2018-02-28 03:21:24 UTC <catteadams> @lindsaygoldwert Shoot for two out of three of those options, and you got something.
969049683078258688 2018-02-28 03:20:23 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer @tarabea80 Me. Cuz, I'm from Upper Michigan. And we sound like you do.  Ya eh? Sure, you betcha!
969049451430952960 2018-02-28 03:19:27 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer God that was funny. And embarrassingly true too.
969049193581920256 2018-02-28 03:18:26 UTC <catteadams> This made me feel so good. Humanity, compassion, basic goodness. I have to watch this every day now. Restores my faith. In all of us.  'cept the Trump family, who kills wild endangered animals for the glory sport of killing, for killing.https://twitter.com/yashar/status/969020140082925569

968638228235304960 2018-02-27 00:05:24 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz I would. Ask him to solve that mystery pain thing...Like hey doc, why do we have pain?  He'll bean ya! LOL & Best wishes to your dad too.
968609989328699392 2018-02-27 22:13:12 UTC <catteadams> @VP @FaithFlaherty3 That's what you want to show your VP? How completely ignorant/uninformed/dumb his supporters are? Well, MmmK, then...You deserve each other, come to think of it.
968607648701493248 2018-02-27 22:03:53 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz That's kind of unusual. But every now and then a random pain can happen anywhere for any reason and it goes away fairly fast. I'll never know what that is. I only know it happens to everyone. LOL  So I call it normal. If ti's recurring or lasting, have it checked out.
968607009497952257 2018-02-27 22:01:21 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @ajplus @Shnookie04 Sadly an all too common story among most every woman I know. Women of all ages, sizes, colors, shapes, qualifications and positions.
968606514213613569 2018-02-27 21:59:23 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz Scar tissue can. It can also itch. scar tissue is inferior to healthy tissue. Unrelieved pressure on scar tissue can make it hurt. Like if it was at your waist and jeans were tight against it.
968603482281336833 2018-02-27 21:47:20 UTC <catteadams> @GOP @thehill @ecclesias @LorraineDWilke It's not kids they love so much, it's our uterus. They have a perverse attachment bordering on stalking, with them. Always wanting to know what's in them, and how can they legislate so they can know what's in them at all times. They want to know what we are doing with them, 24/7
968595814598651904 2018-02-27 21:16:52 UTC <catteadams> @truth_balloon Just said the same thing. This feels like so much stuff and nonsense. These grifters don't play by any rules. Look at what they done thus far. This is a corrupt family at every level. They gave up honor and ethics loooong ago.
968595141068861440 2018-02-27 21:14:11 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay I think it's just posture. I think daddy can/will give him anything he wants. Because Trump thinks he's the CEO of a company, the big BOSS. I don't believe 4 a minute that his access will be cut off. & I'm waiting on the rat who leaks that he's still getting briefs. Wait 4 it
968593463385051137 2018-02-27 21:07:31 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @ajplus This exact thing happened to me and I had to quit my job. Best job I ever had. At the very top of my profession. I knew it would never end, and that they woudn't do anything about it. I reported it. I was mocked. Ignored. And told to ignore it. I quit.http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-sexual-abuse-allegations-stylist-details-1202710460/
968589631741616128 2018-02-27 20:52:18 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @ajplus That's E's position, and he's their cash cow.  You should also speak to the independent investigation that found CREDIBLE allegations. Fair is fair. But the golden boy gets to live on as tho nothing at all happened eh? In fact lets serve him up for Oscars. How appropriate.
968585689649442816 2018-02-27 20:36:38 UTC <catteadams> You'll never guess how relieved I was to see that it was back to normal trending topics on Twitter today. Its national Pancake day everybody!  Oh, and Streisand clones her dogs. Back on yer heads!
968420369261461506 2018-02-27 09:39:43 UTC <catteadams> Dang. We went from days in the high 80's to days in the high 40's. I'm freezing! Probably wake up tomorrow and start sweating my butt off again tho. Good times.
968404090584629248 2018-02-27 08:35:01 UTC <catteadams> @SDotSDotSDotS They boy is recovering well and good and thank you for asking, my friend!  Dodged a bullet for sure.  We now eat rabbit food only. Some but very little fish. All heart healthy.  May I say, kale stinks the house up like zoo farts! LOLOLOL
968403054876700672 2018-02-27 08:30:54 UTC <catteadams> @Ms_Liz2 Thank U, kind lady. Your memory is a good one. So they voted for sanctions and Trump lets the deadline go by. So who enforces the deadline? I've been reading up on it, but this seems so messy....& the committee involved with crafting the sanctions won't say what's up. Coquettes
968399998902706176 2018-02-27 08:18:46 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay You took the words.....
968392921769742336 2018-02-26 07:50:39 UTC <catteadams> @SDotSDotSDotS That boy is adorbs squared! What a little heart breaker. He is never a dull moment I bet.
968392677313142784 2018-02-26 07:49:40 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn @Squishiebunnie I did lose jobs. Great jobs. It's them my friend. It's them. But the culture was, put up with it back then. It's changing. Slowly, it's changing.
968392338413408256 2018-02-26 07:48:19 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn @Squishiebunnie U are not a magnet. These ppl look 4 vulnerability & R predators. Predators look 4 a weakness We learn to bring armor to every event in time. And isn't that a shame too? To have to be so guarded all the time. When we are young we don't have a good spidey sense. They know this
968391326315286528 2018-02-26 07:44:18 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @Squishiebunnie @FlrkilrCarolyn Because he thought he could get away with it. And he's a sick basted. But it's a new day. My daughter is empowered. We talked about it since she was little. She puts up with NO mess. But that doens't mean she couldn't still be assaulted. Anyone can. 
968390755881570304 2018-02-26 07:42:02 UTC <catteadams> @SDotSDotSDotS Oh my! LOOK at that smile! He's hilarious. Who couldn't love that face?
968390096604008448 2018-02-26 07:39:25 UTC <catteadams> @ambertamblyn Ok. I'm up.
968389880211562496 2018-02-26 07:38:33 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @Squishiebunnie @FlrkilrCarolyn Seems like we are not that small anymore. I'm so glad the #metoo happened. Men got a real wake up call. Something is shifting.
968389432696102912 2018-02-26 07:36:47 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn @Squishiebunnie And I am very sorry that happened to you. That is the real heart breaker. They steal our innocence.
968389191452299267 2018-02-26 07:35:49 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn @Squishiebunnie WE have to. And WE always will. Back in the day, my day ... it wasn't even discussed. Children were never believed. Totally covered up & allowed to continue. Had one in the family. It's sick. They are sick. One in the Lutheran church too. There U go. Everywhere there is access
968388406903558144 2018-02-26 07:32:42 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn I was not raised Catholic but I saw the absolute, unquestioned authority that the priests had, while I was doing music for Catholic church and it astonished me. I can see how it could happen with absolute authority, corruption & deeply sick ppl. breaking
968384134149214208 2018-02-26 07:15:43 UTC <catteadams> Enough already. Sick of old white men telling me what I can and cannot do with my body.https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/968288365052354568
968383351789948928 2018-02-26 07:12:37 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost @FlrkilrCarolyn There it is. Hypocrisy at the highest level. But being a private institution and a church I guess they can do it. They pick and choose their morals and ethics like low hanging fruit.
968380294721089539 2018-02-26 07:00:28 UTC <catteadams> @enzoandlucy @RachelGonKCMO When you're good, you're good. Some ppl think that just because they challenge you, they will be right. But. Grades. Classes. Doing the work. And how amazing that you saved that! LOL Kinda makes that smugness shrink back behind the little laptop from whence it came.
968378803557945344 2018-02-26 06:54:33 UTC <catteadams> @Delta @seankent No special interest there.....check THOSE senate donors. Uh huh, thought so.
968378358018043904 2018-02-26 06:52:46 UTC <catteadams> @kaitlancollins The whole nincompoop family is "playing government".  It's clear, they only the got Grifter the board game, for Christmas.
968377915011461120 2018-02-26 06:51:01 UTC <catteadams> Quite brilliant.https://twitter.com/ajplus/status/968377431345184768
968377341729759232 2018-02-26 06:48:44 UTC <catteadams> I have a question. Almost everyone voted for sanctions re Russia but the pres doesn't sign it. What happens if DEMs regain senate and or house or both again, and he just refuses to sign whatever gets passed? Help me understand.
968374869078528002 2018-02-26 06:38:54 UTC <catteadams> @SDotSDotSDotS I remember when this story first came out. I just thought to myself. Yup. That's him. Absolutely no one is surprised either and that is really sad. I just can't wait for 2020. It can't some soon enough. Each day is sicker than the next with him. Thank god for pets! They help.

968371780191694848 2018-02-26 06:26:38 UTC <catteadams> Absolutely incredible interview. Brave Uma. My god. Can't stand Tarantino or his misogynistic movies. Never could. Sick of his movies where women play out his death fantasies of women. He's got issues.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html

968220355130093568 2018-02-26 20:24:55 UTC <catteadams> Trumps Proves once again, he is no where near the smartest man, in any  room, ever. He's just a fool with a microphone and cameras. I'm so sure he would run toward an assailant armed with an automatic weapon of war, using only a hand gun.  (i outta slap him in the head.)

967595179292082176 2018-02-24 03:00:42 UTC <catteadams> @sahilkapur We used to call ppl who continued to sell the product after they already sold it, chasers. They just never knew when to shut up. We'd watch the sale, walk right out of the show room. They wanted to buy, they were ready to buy, they had their wallet out. Gotta know when it over.

967305835557736448 2018-02-23 07:50:57 UTC <catteadams> The most disgusting misuse of this poem I have ever heard.... "Oh shut up you silly woman..." Trump, CPAC today Not to mention the rest of his talk. Gross, on par with what? Can't even come up with anything. Left me with a big Ewww in my whole being. But they ate it up like candy
967294811358167040 2018-02-23 07:07:09 UTC <catteadams> @MichaelSteele Why do we keep giving them the benefit of the doubt when they say racist things like this and damn near to our face? RNC/CPAC, so comfortable doing this So tired of this. Of course you, as always, are more elegant than this moment, more decent. I'm mad as hell.

Been looking for a way to pass this stuff around as I am no longer going on the road.... Don't know if you looked at my page, but 42 years of sho biz, garners you a lot of stuff over time. And what the hell do you do with it
966899736912408576 2018-02-22 04:57:16 UTC <catteadams> Start tweeting your heads off. This is where to apply the pressure.pic.twitter.com/CqtnmX8yrE

966893983631724544 2018-02-22 04:34:24 UTC <catteadams> @davidhogg111 LETS DO THIS!
966892324650287104 2018-02-22 04:27:48 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold My girlfriend did the same thing. She told the movers U have 2 hours to pack this house up before my old man shows up with a gun. Take everything. Don't leave SALT in the shaker! They didn't.  He was a brutal, violent guy.  So, F him.   Never forgot that line. #MovieRealness
966889738559922176 2018-02-22 04:17:32 UTC <catteadams> @RoseMarie4Real I just love her sooooooo much.  She was such a CAN DO kind of person.  Gosh I wish I had met her, and that had we become friends. #LoveRoseMarie
966855196000206848 2018-02-22 02:00:16 UTC <catteadams> I'm down. But they'll just replace her head with another head. This one is too pretty to lose. And that's how they're thinking about it too, bet money. This is their golden girl. There will be no outcry.https://twitter.com/starbuck13502/status/966852508483276800

966771355403239424 2018-02-22 20:27:07 UTC <catteadams> @chelseahandler @SaintRanges @Wildphil44 Google it. It's legendary. Do your own work.
966574541903310848 2018-02-21 07:25:03 UTC <catteadams> Nuts, crazy, insane, mad man.  Words from the NRA paid professional spokes-person. Disgusting.
966573402227015680 2018-02-21 07:20:31 UTC <catteadams> @marcorubio Business as usual isn't cutting it anymore. You're talking point and politically slick, I'll give you that. And it's clear you are eyeing the presidency once day. But kids aren't as gullible as you think. Nor are we.
966567551688847360 2018-02-21 06:57:16 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle As we get older we make better & more informed choices.  I made some bad choices in friends. They used me. I cant even remember their names now. Life is like that. But keep your heart open, my sweet friend. More good than bad. It takes time 2 heal. But we get there. I promise
966566836140523520 2018-02-21 06:54:26 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle It's all here. Tru dat. That's why I use my Blockity block weed whacker!
966556577728638981 2018-02-21 06:13:40 UTC <catteadams> You gotta admit, Rubio's slick.
966553381572460545 2018-02-21 06:00:58 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley You've got an idea there.....if only I were smarter. I'd know just how to utilize those numbers. 
966552581479612416 2018-02-21 05:57:47 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Its the same around the world. The rich dont give a damn abt anything but money It's their obsession PPL R not a factor, let alone poor ppl. PPl of color, regular working ppl, women, children, the working poor, dont even figure in their life. Not a thought given. Until we rise up
966551520442372096 2018-02-21 05:53:34 UTC <catteadams> True. I write. Music/Stories. And I tell my stories out loud. Twitter has 240. No ability to share the nuance. And with ppl's stories, it's all nuance. So I dont get into much depth about myself here. Just try to stay connected, and aware, and help how I can, where I can.https://twitter.com/KarenMKunkle/status/966546386471866369
966550342425915392 2018-02-21 05:48:53 UTC <catteadams> @chelseahandler @SaintRanges Oh kee rist. Tell the rest of the story. Tht's barely half. This old chestnut holds no water without the rest of the story. Come forwrd in time jusssssst a little bit. Or masticate on the half past, like popcorn and old movies on Netflix.
966543821738721280 2018-02-21 05:22:59 UTC <catteadams> @AP_Politics @l_blixx Not quite as intelligent as the way in which he uses "strongly".  God how I cringe. Doip.
966543376840499201 2018-02-21 05:21:13 UTC <catteadams> @AP_Politics Hey AP. That was the shot heard round the world today, in 2018. Talk about    ......SCOOOOOOOOOOOP!
966542524851474432 2018-02-21 05:17:50 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Toured the world for 42 years. USA since 15. Every state. You begin to see a pattern. So I know it's about poverty. And no GOP ever wants to deal with it or change it. They say instead these are lazy ppl. Programs have been started, but sooner or later they get killed by GOP.
966540676656635906 2018-02-21 05:10:29 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @Twitter @David_Feldman_ Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh The Ad buyers might hear you.
966535647245713408 2018-02-21 04:50:30 UTC <catteadams> @VicBergerIV What?  The tiny wrist got by you? LOL
966529853422936064 2018-02-21 04:27:28 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle I've spent my life touring this country & I've think I've seen more than most. Wht I think I could speak 2 is what poverty has caused, & how it cripples our society in ways we cnt even imagine. Invisible & generational Take away poverty, & we become a better people on every level
966519381290139653 2018-02-21 03:45:52 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Our country isn't a shit hole. The GOP and the NRA is where I put this blame. This is on THEM.....
966518413177716736 2018-02-21 03:42:01 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold What U said. &or being in/around, a group of people who dont challenge U. There's also comfort in conspiracy theories for some ppl. Feeling a sense of powerlessness over things in life, they come in handy 2 help U feel in control. Cuz now U know whats REALLY going on, doncha know
966506006313295872 2018-02-21 02:52:43 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman I knew you'd leave out the fire throwers!

966444221979705349 2018-02-21 22:47:12 UTC <catteadams> @FBI @David_Feldman_ OK by me.

966408546861465600 2018-02-21 20:25:27 UTC <catteadams> @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @David_Feldman_ What U said. There testimony before congress was a joke. A sputtering, wheezing, back pedaling, embarrassment of half truths and broken promises. Business as usual. It's about the $$, and posture they enjoy, not the "terms of service" they so proudly tout.
966244579233038337 2018-02-21 09:33:54 UTC <catteadams> @owillis Glad to hear that, really.
966243894064168960 2018-02-21 09:31:10 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz towels are what hospitals use.
966204558455304197 2018-02-20 06:54:52 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz Me too.  Got any microwaveable heat packs? Fire them up. If not, a damp wash cloth in the micro for one/two minutes . Wrap it in a towel and put it on your tummy or lower back. Warm up the core.
966202191194345472 2018-02-20 06:45:28 UTC <catteadams> @DanielleMuscato @NotNickFish And the still have lock down drills....Cuz...rapid fire assault rifles are like skittles....want some? Get some.

I'll say the same about Twitter...so much BS and bot-ness and Rusky foolishness. UGH. Be better than a click addict. Way better. Also, one source doesn't make anything true. Consider that source. B better.
966189564661559296 2018-02-20 05:55:17 UTC <catteadams> @RoseMarie4Real How precious is that? She saved it all these years for you Noopy! What a treasure. #LoveMissRoseMarie
966182886381670405 2018-02-20 05:28:45 UTC <catteadams> @Kris_Sacrebleu You know it's BS cause Twitter does absolutely nuthin, about a firestorm until the place burns to the ground. So,....nah...they havent even blinked.

966104785110810624 2018-02-20 00:18:24 UTC <catteadams> @owillis What I hear mostly is they want to be heard.  They dont have to have it all figured out. Their voices crying out should be enough. I am so proud of what they have done thus far. I also get that PPL are trying to help them so their efforts are as results oriented as they can be.
966102318339973120 2018-02-20 00:08:36 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay I just sang "Dance Me To The End Of Love" this Sunday. A heart breaker and so profound.  Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove Dance me to the end of love
966101388181712897 2018-02-20 00:04:54 UTC <catteadams> @David_Feldman_ Me thinks this Pence guy is Do Do-ing too much. Do try. Do think. Uh huh. Do what David said. He's a bit lonely and you're good at it, @VP .
966089790914363394 2018-02-20 23:18:49 UTC <catteadams> #AndThatsHowIGotThisScar  I'm sorry folks, but this is one story that will not be told.   Not even on Twitter.  Not even after wine. Not Later. In the dark. Ever. It's just too weird.

Moving softly forward like a sound wave, she lives and moves and has her being in God. This child has value. This child lives on and breathes free, free from the past. And we welcome her with open arms.

965868328693637121 2018-02-20 08:38:49 UTC <catteadams> Thanking all the nurses doctors & great caregivers who gave their all, while we were in hospital. We are so very grateful.

965813493218738177 2018-02-19 05:00:55 UTC <catteadams> @mterr337 Someone that has built a life and career by doing wrong rarely has a crisis of conscience until the crisis arrives at their door personally. I.E. Gov. George Wallace. But you must embody at least a thimble full of humility. You wont find that in Mr. Trump.

You're all just a bunch of phonies. You're so hypocritical. Such liars.  And now you're acting as if we can't go back in time and read your past statements. INTERNET KILLS LIARS

But you keep doing it anyway. You denounce, then endorse, denounce, then thank. You are exactly alike. Morally bankrupt. I hope you fall upon your own sword. #PatheticRomney

So many really good decent men out there. Mostly, in fact. I've been lucky to meet so many, and my life has been the richer because of these men.  #Grateful
961866061048983552 2018-02-08 07:35:14 UTC <catteadams> @SnezanaJevticBg Oh wow. I can't take that much cute in one night! Awwwwwwwww....
961865719230025729 2018-02-08 07:33:52 UTC <catteadams> @TGIFridaysUK That's admirable. Back in the day all straws had that waxy feel and taste. And WE LIKED IT!
961865436773011457 2018-02-08 07:32:45 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman I gotta steal that one. But, I'll pay royalties! It's true and funny and true and funny.
961864929404833792 2018-02-08 07:30:44 UTC <catteadams> @AuthorKimberley @JenKirkman Ya know, some ppl hear what they want to hear. Some PPL complain about anything, everything. And some PPL are just terminal Debbie Downers.. Ignore. Block. Ignore. Block. Party on. You're hysterical and a most unique voice out here. 
961863578046222337 2018-02-08 07:25:22 UTC <catteadams> @carlreiner He's always informed and his topics are of interest to me, sir. In fact, he could be talking about marshmallow treats and I'd learn something new.
961859574780194816 2018-02-08 07:09:27 UTC <catteadams> @thehill @brandon_r_horan HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Well said. If only they controlled every branch....why I oughta..... POW!  Straight to the kisser!
961859076291420162 2018-02-08 07:07:28 UTC <catteadams> @thehill Talk about your stunts. Can't even imagine what the holy hell balls would have been unleashed if that were the Democrats. Mr. Paul. Take a seat.

961856069533278210 2018-02-08 06:55:32 UTC <catteadams> @laurence .@Laurence I am so glad that MSNBC L.O'Donnell show devoted that last segment to battered women. Incredible choice. For the voiceless you have just rung the silent bells that still toll for so many. Bless you for doing that. Powerful voices spoke tonight, through MSNBC. #MSNBC

961842483247308800 2018-02-08 06:01:32 UTC <catteadams> @starbuck13502 Thank you very much. Sometimes we Twitter folk are all we have. And it is very good. 
961842168561221637 2018-02-08 06:00:17 UTC <catteadams> @starbuck13502 I watched it again and saw that. Appalling. But no less so than the inept and PC answers he offered. Such B.S.  So legally scripted. Absolutely disgusting. And no empathy whatsoever. I hope that conversation keeps him up at night. It should. #Shameful
961841449481326592 2018-02-08 05:57:26 UTC <catteadams> @starbuck13502 Thank you. So sweet of U. I know he'll be ok...the weird part was the doctor scolding him for not getting it done. He scowled at him, why didn't you get in here sooner? Why did you wait? Hubster said, you have a two month waiting list with my insurance. *crickets Sheesh.
961799370197819394 2018-02-08 03:10:13 UTC <catteadams> @thehill @barkatem You won't. That's a certainty. He has a good chance. How very small of you. Must be Russian bot. Should be an emoji for that. LOL Tweensy penis with a bear on it or something.
961798332887678976 2018-02-08 03:06:06 UTC <catteadams> @thehill LOVE LOVE LOVE his decent and clear answer. You GO boy!
961796175283200001 2018-02-08 02:57:32 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Interesting. Well you certainly have less to lose. I'm 63, and for me, I just don't have time to waste on anything but the truth. Cut to the chase. Cuz, I ain't got time baby, ain't got time for no mess. lolololol
961795487048261632 2018-02-08 02:54:48 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz LOLOLOLOL Thre's only one "dear leader". The big orange.
961758239086882816 2018-02-08 00:26:47 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer They act as if a shutdown is a good political move but not one that will affect ppl's lives. That's what's truly reprehensible. PPL still have bills to pay, ppl to take care of, and those creditors don't give a damn about shutdown. If you can't pay, you get charged. #Reckless
961757331443695616 2018-02-08 00:23:11 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter But, I think he should be quiet already. Most of that stuff is just old gossip and catty. As for the hookups, who cares? It's grown folks business, so let it be. Who really cares anyway? Not I. Changes nothing, so what did he gain?
961756662808760320 2018-02-08 00:20:31 UTC <catteadams> @ParilloGary The way he said he would love a shutdown made it quite clear to me that he could give a crap that that means hurting real people. It's not a concept, or a game of checkers. These are real ppl w/ bills to pay & kids to bring to day care, car notes and mortgages that are due.
961748408032673793 2018-02-08 23:47:43 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer @MlleLicious That is the true fact of it all. Far more love and support. They don't matter in the grand scheme of things. They just WISH they did. Love to you Charlotte! 
961747673496748033 2018-02-08 23:44:48 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer & who has that kind of mindset? A disturbed, powerless, isolated, sad, little person. I can't remember why this went down, but one time I got a ton of vile hate stuff on FB too. Never was I so happy to have a blockity block block button. I loved how that worked out. EFF 'em
961719344374755329 2018-02-08 21:52:14 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Ive recently seen several very candid interviews with him. I'd say as ppl die, you can be more candid. In the one I just read he said "I'm sorry I really can't talk to you about that in public" so many times I thought, wow, he's got dirt on everyone. Just gotta live long enough
961429613380485120 2018-02-07 02:40:56 UTC <catteadams> Wherever it is, your gonna need that step stool to get out.
961429032133804032 2018-02-07 02:38:38 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Im not sure why anyone cares tho. Grown folk business be grown folks business
961378880786333696 2018-02-07 23:19:21 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic I get that they feel the confessional is sacrosanct, but isn't the innocence of a childhood stollen by sexual predation enough cause to report anyway?  Seems the greater sin on your soul would be to not report and cause a lifetime of harm to countless other children.
961326406905954304 2018-02-07 19:50:50 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump Do you know how ANYTHING  on earth works?   Me. Bizniz man, the market since inception (look it up) goes up...and ...down.  There have been some good old day crashes too. Thats history. And u should know that. But, you dont read, so weep on you fool, weep on.
961321046971269120 2018-02-07 19:29:32 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic No one would care. The world would continue to turn.  *Pushes Snooze button

961133819230289920 2018-02-06 07:05:34 UTC <catteadams> @thehill @KartSchlarctard Because if ppl don't do what you want, you "rightfully" kill them? That's not a democracy. Go to Russia if that's the govt you want.
961133054331932672 2018-02-06 07:02:31 UTC <catteadams> @thehill He says he'd love to see a shutdown because he doesn't see us at all. A shutdown hurts real ppl. This is not a game. What a callous human being. What a dangerous human being
961131684916879361 2018-02-06 06:57:05 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @tomhensleyy Seems fair. But he doesn't do fair. He does dictator

961105537868890113 2018-02-06 05:13:11 UTC <catteadams> @USCBO @SenatorDurbin We saw that coming. And we don't make policy decisions for a living. Now, did YOU not see it coming? Because this is right out of their playbook. So, let's not pretend to be shocked. Do something about it.
961102732563288064 2018-02-06 05:02:02 UTC <catteadams> @cher I can't think of anything more boring than a military parade. Snooze fest. And the $$spent! Where are the outraged conservative hawks now?

960855283047088128 2018-02-06 12:38:45 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX @DonEoin Thats what I am saying 2. Philly is us at our best. They held it together! They celebrated & some idiots acted up. Big deal. I've been thru many L.A. victories where things got way crazier.. So, 4 me?  There's always a much bigger question/picture/story than who did what & when.
960819939337674754 2018-02-06 10:18:19 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX U are absolutely right. Hidden biases come out in just this way....these ppl I'd dearly love to invite to a workshop. It takes time, but it also takes the right method to open ppl's . I've. had amazing lessons on bias & not pushed in my face. Those are the one's I remember.
960799642270121984 2018-02-06 08:57:40 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman What does Vit. B do 4U now that's a benefit? I used to get shots of B12. When I had bad Epstein Barr Virus CFS & I was still touring 24/7 round the world.  Could barely move. They gave me a little boost &made it bearable to push forward.  In what way does it help U now?
960797002882736130 2018-02-06 08:47:10 UTC <catteadams> @robinbloor Well played.  I am debugging tomorrow with the Termite man. I want NO programming of them from this day forward.  PLSSSSSSsssssssss  Thank you. God bless ya bugs, but ya got to go.  Times up!
960796052075917312 2018-02-06 08:43:24 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Philly PD. had it going ON. I was so proud of what I saw.
960795766980730881 2018-02-06 08:42:16 UTC <catteadams> @valerieonmaui @VABVOX @redreader5346 No one calls destructive behavior celebration. There was celebration, and there was some destructive behavior of a few ppl. Minor by comparison to the crowd size. Most were well behaved, happy and just having a good time.
960794688855752704 2018-02-06 08:37:59 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX This happened more than once.... I saw cops giving high fives in Philly and most everyone was jubilant and festive with NO malice towards anyone. Were there some drunk fools? Yes. There are always drunk fools. That's why they have police out in droves. Proud of Philly. Well Done!
960794232406470656 2018-02-06 08:36:10 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Just to show you how peaceful Philly was...http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/06/18/l-a-s-rowdy-post-championship-ritual-continues/
960790588999127040 2018-02-06 08:21:41 UTC <catteadams> @randyprine That's right. This law used to be in effect, and my sister lost so much $$. As a server in a small town it nearly killed them. Then they also pay taxes on those tips. This is robbery. Anyone who can't see that has never served a day as a server. These ppl work their asses off
960788470405844992 2018-02-06 08:13:16 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman YAY Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate it. Still disturbing to watch. I'm such an old school mom, I guess.  And as a singer I still cringe, when I see ppl vape. Yup. THAT old of a school. LOL  Peace.
960772010862358528 2018-02-05 07:07:52 UTC <catteadams> YES.https://twitter.com/OhioHouseDems/status/960570875652313088
960771044356145153 2018-02-05 07:04:01 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay I hear you heart brother. And I feel the same way. Twitter is nothing if not a sounding board and a bitching board. That's what it's here for! If ppl don't like your tweets today, they can mute you.
960768951075487745 2018-02-05 06:55:42 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman I can't tell you how disturbing it is to see you blow whatever that is at us, before you begin your talk. It just is. Perhaps you could do that before you start. Go in peace.  Do no harm, to yourself, to others, especially women and children.  Be the example.

960759024118464512 2018-02-05 06:16:16 UTC <catteadams> @guapofalbq And Elisabeth Warren has been such a champion in this fight. When her last bill went down I was sick. All our protections ripped away by the GOP. Didn't even hear a ripple. Predatory loans/credit cards are back, bad housing loans are back.  It's just sickening.
960757847238721536 2018-02-05 06:11:35 UTC <catteadams> @liv_thatsme I'll see your kit-kat and raise you a twix peanut butter.
960756707470196736 2018-02-05 06:07:03 UTC <catteadams> @guapofalbq What goes up.....  Banks are pulling the same old shenanigans. Consider the loop holes they took advantage of before the bust. We paid the price. Bailed them out. We will do so again under this admn. as they are doing it again.  Free fallin ain't just a Tom Petty song.

960454598040346625 2018-02-05 10:06:35 UTC <catteadams> @richardbranson So many great ideas that were researched in OC, Calif got scraped because the funding went away with Trump admin.  I am wondering if U would invest in homelessness if U were convinced it would end in ten years. We were almost there. We were ready to begin. Now?  Funding gone.
960433413135122432 2018-02-05 08:42:24 UTC <catteadams> @cat_justrsistin I see he is running tho.... Thankfully we will have a great candidate to bring to the ppl of good reason and sound judgement. Trumpers need not apply.

960399045746294784 2018-02-04 06:25:50 UTC <catteadams> @jennafabulous Well, no matter....what's she offering? What's in the hopper? Nuthin like mom's food.

960385736041099265 2018-02-04 05:32:57 UTC <catteadams> @destineybleu I just wish they had done a better job on costuming. It was pretty drab and didn't read well on camera. I got no bone to pick with anyone who does the super bowl tho. The pressure must be intense. And the level of noise must be the same, from all directions. Loud as hell.

It's managing it that becomes our life's work. And some days we don't do it well. Most days we do. I traveled the world for a living. Which added to it. Better now.

960063878402007042 2018-02-04 08:14:00 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic This is truly insane.  If we were looking at these stats, as if they belonged to another country, we'd think they were barbarians.  And we'd be right. But we cannot, or will not see it in ourselves

In fact, I love the worms in my garden, and every job that they do. They truly turn garbage into beautiful useful things. Every single day.  His efforts, unfortunately, are the reverse.

Owning up to your mess & suffering the humiliation & embarrassment & climbing out of it by yourself can also build character.

Sometimes we get our asses caught in a sling early in life. & our choices are not always the best when we are young & inexperienced. If you learn the lesson, there are usually second chances. God knows I've made some bad choices in my life. Not this public, but bad enough.

957134915866304512 2018-01-26 06:15:21 UTC <catteadams> #DirtyMoney new series, on Netflix is a total mind blower. Wow. You gotta see this. It is deep.
957109238072991744 2018-01-26 04:33:19 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic This is just sick. Time for a few hefty lawsuits to bring this barbaric practice to an end, once and for all. It's insanity.  
957107123900506112 2018-01-26 04:24:55 UTC <catteadams> Hypocrisy.  Great read. Know who you're dealing with at all times. Some kind of sickness in this man.http://jewishjournal.com/opinion/rob_eshman/214361/stephen-miller-meet-immigrant-great-grandfather/

957085743779782656 2018-01-26 02:59:57 UTC <catteadams> @TheRickyDavila While interviewing gymnast Ali Raisman a reporter asked, "do you think this is still going on?" "Yes. The swim team." says Ali. The reporter either didn't hear her, didn't have time to go deeper or just missed it. But I sat straight up & said Wait! WHAT?  Anyone know about this?

956796779831353344 2018-01-25 07:51:43 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay And it always will. The older one gets, the more you know that. PPL are basically good, and want to do good. It's but a few rotten apples that try to run the whole dang deal, and control it all. That is also what make us wake up and get ignited. And baby, we are on fire right now
956796135389016064 2018-01-25 07:49:09 UTC <catteadams> @AndyKindler I'm beginning to relive several food traumas as I think about this. My sister made lemon meringue pie to die for, in our youth. Regularly. Like it was nothin. I just gave up trying to find it, or make it like hers. *sigh Life has it's ugh's, my friend.
956795076230828032 2018-01-25 07:44:57 UTC <catteadams> @AndyKindler Ditto, key lime. Even in Florida keys.  Best to just make it yourself, and gorge the whole damn thing! There will be guilt. But not more than satisfaction. :)

956777629142499329 2018-01-25 06:35:37 UTC <catteadams> @cmclymer I appreciate this tweet so much. My DM says "Married, not looking to change that. Happy." They still do it. Not being nice about it any more. And man, do I get shit for that.
956767363591954433 2018-01-25 05:54:50 UTC <catteadams> @DGComedy I'd go to that beach. Any time!
956767077334794242 2018-01-25 05:53:41 UTC <catteadams> @destineybleu PS. They are NOT too expensive. They are labor intensive, special, and unique. Some ppl will never know the difference between knock off and original. Let them go elsewhere. Quality knows quality.
956766670306947072 2018-01-25 05:52:04 UTC <catteadams> @destineybleu DONT. Keep doing you. The market will continue to come to you and it will continue to grow.  The complaints? They R always there. Tiz the nature of business. You don't have to please everybody.  You're special. And one of a kind. Either ppl get it, or they don't. 
956761710253170688 2018-01-25 05:32:22 UTC <catteadams> @TananariveDue @MsTerryMcMillan Yup.Line the pockets & do what you will. He'll never see a day in jail. He'll B like all other despots who get caught. Fade from history, Nothing bad will happen. & family goes on to dominate financially thru money laundering etc. Same old game. 2 much $$ to pay the justice piper
956760364351242242 2018-01-25 05:27:01 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @DSnelsonSmith Agreed.
956757855725481984 2018-01-25 05:17:03 UTC <catteadams> We stand with you Cory.  Tell us how to be more effective and we will be an army for justice!https://twitter.com/SenBooker/status/956721697297707008
956757346973175809 2018-01-25 05:15:01 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @Strikeoutlookin Not sure if Reindeer sausage is the same as caribou but my gawd, it was not to be missed. We had reindeer, & at another hole in the wall we had caribou. Maybe it's the same. All I know is, Alaskan's know what to do with breakfast!..cuz it be COLD as hell!  Time for critter food!
956755678407741440 2018-01-25 05:08:24 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @Strikeoutlookin YASSSSSS. That pizza... Oh dear...we're gonna make Tom fat....but, in Alaska, this time of year, you need the extra layer. That's what I told myself when I lived in the U.P.   
956751489287913474 2018-01-25 04:51:45 UTC <catteadams> @leemwilliams What PPL? You can't make ppl smart. This started full force with the tea party but had begun a political movement to undermine democracy much before that. It's becoming more divisive day by day.  And Trump and the GOP are only flaming those fires.  It's intentional. It's the plan
956750711752048640 2018-01-25 04:48:39 UTC <catteadams> @KottiPillar @ladyhawkerfinds DONE!
956750473251373058 2018-01-25 04:47:43 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold You must stay long enough to have the caribou sausage and eggs, cuz, it's so damn good. And you can't beat the rustic critter lodges with the small animals stuffed, in their crazy poses. Purdy koo koo. Gwennie's Old Alaska Restaurant can do you no harm. PLUS: Grits. Oh baby!
956748479191138304 2018-01-25 04:39:47 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB I appreciate every single man that steps up and says I had no idea. And then becomes an ally. I am honored by men, when I am believed. And though I don't expect anyone to fight for me, the support is immeasurable. When I know I have real backup, I am stronger.  So, thank you!
956744324573667329 2018-01-25 04:23:17 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB I'm sure you woudln't be surprised to know that I have quit classes, groups, churches, social organizations, all kinds of things because of this.  Things I dearly wanted to be a part of. And I am not unique in this. Not at all.
956743769059049472 2018-01-25 04:21:04 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB True. But this was a Church of Religious Science. They don't do all that stuff. It's all about God/The Christ is within you. It's about certain men. Nothing more. They show up everywhere and take advantage.  I keep my distance from this man. At all costs. Kinda pathetic tho
956742800673878016 2018-01-25 04:17:13 UTC <catteadams> @leemwilliams Amen to that!
956742721720299527 2018-01-25 04:16:54 UTC <catteadams> I'm making shrimp curry Thai style...my whole house smells like garlic, ginger and lemongrass. OOOOHHHHHH Baby!
956742229808234496 2018-01-25 04:14:57 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB I'm not sure that's true. But we certainly know more than we did. I was in church and a lay person who serves the church asked me to "lets take this further" I had only responded to a hug. He also asked me if I was cold.  I now wear double boob pads in every bra. No 1 said a word
956741469167009793 2018-01-25 04:11:56 UTC <catteadams> @BigWinInTx Big Win, that is beautiful.   And, I have never heard that before.  
956735823122059264 2018-01-25 03:49:30 UTC <catteadams> @BigWinInTx Yes, sir.  Most of us will benefit from that blessing in life. Most men pass that on to their kids. Bless the good men of this world who have always done the right thing, by teaching their children well.
956735057674223616 2018-01-25 03:46:27 UTC <catteadams> I just LOVE LOVE LOVE @JoyAnnReid so much! Tell it plain and simple. Does he have the courage? No.  He's gonna burn it all down. And not look back either.
956734363995029504 2018-01-25 03:43:42 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB Actually none of us had a platform. I have had so many men step up around me. They were looking for a way also. Now we all have one. 
956733853925699590 2018-01-25 03:41:40 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB No. U're not. Love men. & I love the men who stand with us. MOST men never do this stuff. Really. I have been hassled forever as have most women. But it's always the same kind of men. Now tho, good men have a chance to help us stop it.  I dont think they had this platform B4
956731570986958849 2018-01-25 03:32:36 UTC <catteadams> Funny how you don't hear about the multitudes of men who don't abuse women. Mostly cuz, they never abuse women. We do hear about the rest, in one way or another, their names come up. Repeat: if they don't abuse, their names NEVER come up.
956716090087714817 2018-01-25 02:31:05 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold That'd be enough for me to stay a few extra days. lol

956703471557689344 2018-01-25 01:40:56 UTC <catteadams> @TimOBrien Cant wait. However, having read all the books, seen all the docs so far, I'll be surprised if anything new comes up. Still, I'll be front and center. 
956701917299621888 2018-01-25 01:34:46 UTC <catteadams> @DearAuntCrabby @_cool_blue_ Heh heh heh. Me too. You caught me. 
956700539437301761 2018-01-25 01:29:17 UTC <catteadams> @jewishlawyerlib @BravenakBlog @21law @NudelHalbWeiner Indeed, and we need more of them. The other side of this is, women judges also have the capacity to be fair and compassionate in sentencing other cases. Not just the monstrous ones.
956695570701103104 2018-01-25 01:09:33 UTC <catteadams> @DearAuntCrabby @_cool_blue_ You first.

956680011578159104 2018-01-25 00:07:43 UTC <catteadams> @jewishlawyerlib @BravenakBlog @NudelHalbWeiner @21law I am not an expert but I have seen a fair share of courtroom hijinx go down. It's just the truth. That's all. A male judge told my mother she should be ashamed of herself for divorcing my father. He had only cheated on her and gotten another woman pregnant.  Oh really?
956679234340012032 2018-01-25 00:04:38 UTC <catteadams> @LateNightSeth @joshgondelman Congrats! Great set! Watched it last night.

956677938795065344 2018-01-25 23:59:29 UTC <catteadams> Well it's about time Twitter got the message.  Cuz, they be laggin' mostly.http://www.newsweek.com/twitter-locks-trump-supporter-accounts-releasethememo-russia-789665

If you think this judge was over the line then you've never been in a criminal courtroom. This stuff goes on all the time w/ male judges & no one blinks. No one talks about legal errors and appeals because of "harshness". And that's putting it mildly.

956455570231279616 2018-01-25 09:15:52 UTC <catteadams> @SecretaryCarson @AprilDRyan @LynnePatton This is what it looks like when you hire someone unqualified, to do a job they prove incapable of, and they prove it, by posting a thoughtless, cruel, and immature tweet like this. April Ryan is the woman you will never be, no matter how hard you try.  You lack what it takes.
956452335915474945 2018-01-25 09:03:01 UTC <catteadams> @mala_munoz So true. I might replace "what if she doesn't offer to pay half the bill?" with "anything the man says" before a date.  Our answer, would remain the same, however.

When you hire someone to deliver food, and they barely speak english, get lost, and then call you frustrated because they are at the wrong address, you've got a few details to work out. To say the least the food is wrong. And cold. NOT happening. #UberEATS
956406567502462976 2018-01-24 06:01:09 UTC <catteadams> @D_Copperfield How many men HIS age arrange for girls HER age to fly out and stay with them in adjoining rooms, just cuz?  Come on.  Ohhhhhh I know, he was trying to teach a pretty, under age, young woman, a new hat trick.  Riiight

Not sure firing her will do much more than bury the hatred.  And trust, it pops up bigger, somewhere else. Find a better lesson, to make her keep her bigotry to herself.

956006460709773312 2018-01-23 03:31:16 UTC <catteadams> @JonRiley7 @cougsta Of course. Name a reporter/publication/network that wouldnt take that press conference, or phone call.

And if he saw you has snap he'd let you run with it. Who does that?
955734637044576256 2018-01-23 09:31:08 UTC <catteadams> @goatgranny63 @reversechapter Doesn't the need for ever more opioid and difficulty managing the amounts make it hard to control long term usage? I'm no expert, but it seems like the usage always escalates. I could be wrong. Agree tho, there are no good and bad drugs. It's how they are used.

955390851844222976 2018-01-22 10:45:04 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter No thanks. No pain meds ever. I go a different route. Pain would have to be off the charts and into the insanity zone for me to take opioids. And they would be well monitored and limited. I'm pretty tough character. I know the dangers, and it doesn't take much to get addicted.

955383840293339137 2018-01-22 10:17:12 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter Whoa. This stuff is horrendous. Thanks for the intel.
955383519596879872 2018-01-22 10:15:55 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter I'm appalled that being a former heroin addict that he was given ANY opiods at all. Psin management doesn't have to be opiods, and a broken hip is a reason to not tour. He was addicted and self medicating. That's what addicts do. Really sad that no one saw this. Addicts B addicts
955380495692345344 2018-01-22 10:03:54 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter What's the difference between illicit and prescribed? Not in the legal sense but is there a street version of fentanyl?
955380175218212865 2018-01-22 10:02:38 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter I don't know what the illicit Fentanyl analogue is in regards to his situation. I haven't kept up on this story.  I thought he was prescribed Fentanyl for his injury. It actually surprises me how many do not know that the combining of the 2, are the deadliest concoction ever. :(
955377354578083840 2018-01-22 09:51:26 UTC <catteadams> @reversechapter An opioid combined with a benzo is a certain death cocktail. Sadly, he probably wasn't warned to not combine those two. Or they were prescribed by different doctors. Look at overdose deaths. That cocktail plays a part in tons of them. A benzo alone, no. Opioid? Maybe. Both? YES
955368105080905728 2018-01-22 09:14:40 UTC <catteadams> @Cernovich @BuzzFeed @nathanTbernard Embarrassing and ewwwwww. These guys are not getting enough sex. And now they'll get even less.

955327615790911488 2018-01-21 06:33:47 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley LOLOLOLOL Oh the humanity!
955327318418972672 2018-01-21 06:32:36 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @KB805 @TinaIsle Maybe they meant farty, old, white men. LOL  I'm an old, classy, golden girls, broad! I don't watch it either. LOLOLOL
955326678040903680 2018-01-21 06:30:03 UTC <catteadams> NOW he decides to tell the truth about what's going on. So funny how the conscience comes back when you have everything to lose.   Hey Senator, do you NOW see yourself sinking & your legacy fading into embarrassment, failure and shame? We do. A little late to the fair, Lindsey.https://twitter.com/ahernandez2bak/status/955313340259090432
955323606443089920 2018-01-21 06:17:51 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Good God man. What are you 12? You sound so insecure. Do you need hormone shots or something? Grow a pair, and stop with all the need for good grades and praise. You need constant validation. Just like a high school boy. But you're boring as F all. NOT presidential, dude.  D-
955322094987886592 2018-01-21 06:11:51 UTC <catteadams> BEAUTIFUL moment fro Sterling K. Brown. Love his acting.  And his words were so generous and loving, and true.https://twitter.com/SAGawards/status/955266246257164288
955320392247201792 2018-01-21 06:05:05 UTC <catteadams> @mcspocky You know that Twitter fool saw it too.  It must have ground him up. Twitter-burger surprise.
955319899764572160 2018-01-21 06:03:07 UTC <catteadams> So true. So we keep marching and building. One step at a time, until we get the change we need.https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/955171264976613377
955319615487328258 2018-01-21 06:01:59 UTC <catteadams> @Maggiemay19th I bought it for my brother and sister in law for Christmas. CBD oil works PPL! And there's no THC in it. I swear by it. Any ache, any pain. Especially arthritis. Miracle worker.
955315371807879168 2018-01-21 05:45:08 UTC <catteadams> Sure we deserve dogs. Thank god he had some dogs to love him back. God bless him and I hope he is better today. Our vets are really suffering today and the suicide rate is sky high for returning vets. They have now gone one 6, 7, 10, tours of duty. Used to be one, maybe two.https://twitter.com/owillis/status/955313494823489536
955314119422353408 2018-01-21 05:40:09 UTC <catteadams> @LadyThriller69 I'm with you. But I'd like to add one wish to that.  I see them, alone somewhere, and I clap slap them in the head, and say, payback's here, bitch!   Then I do my best "happy now" bitch walk off, ever. And my hair swishes, like in a Clarol commercial.  I don't want much do I?
955312749210345472 2018-01-21 05:34:42 UTC <catteadams> @yashar @sesmith That is a great idea. They'd sell a million, trillion, gazillion of them.
955312462789685251 2018-01-21 05:33:34 UTC <catteadams> The pesky thing about facts is, they are irrefutable.   Cuz, ya know, ....facts.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/955069720587206658
955311511873863680 2018-01-21 05:29:47 UTC <catteadams> @lsarsour @vet4democracy @LisaCassandra1 Were there boo's from the crowd when she said that? How did ppl react? I can't believe she would put that forward. And to a group of women who knew EXACTLY why we were marching. Why say something so untrue? I am surprised to hear this.
955310736397369349 2018-01-21 05:26:43 UTC <catteadams> Great question. What is your answer Twitter?  @TwitterSupporthttps://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/955309124069163009
955309993657475074 2018-01-21 05:23:45 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @jasondoylehall That's a total crack up. Even Santa can't get no love in Philly.
955305943260000257 2018-01-21 05:07:40 UTC <catteadams> @DearAuntCrabby Aunt Crabby, you brought me to my happy place this fine Sunday night! You never fail to make my day.
955305200264265728 2018-01-21 05:04:43 UTC <catteadams> @DearAuntCrabby This is so funny. As if those ppl dont know that Trump is the cheapest bastard on the planet. Enjoy your caviar you miserable, cake sniffing, humps. 
955304398841786369 2018-01-21 05:01:32 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Oh my gawd. They boo'd Santa. That's as weird as it is funny.
955304078052966401 2018-01-21 05:00:15 UTC <catteadams> Such a cynical man. He's become a tyrant. Pathetic shell of what a man in his position, could be.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/954825373572726784

955219814041075712 2018-01-21 23:25:25 UTC <catteadams> @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @MSNBC @MichNazz I do it. I have hope.  But the president doesnt know what he wants minute 2 minute. Truly a mess. He says he'll sign then he says no I wont. He's truly incompetent.
955215005976178688 2018-01-21 23:06:19 UTC <catteadams> @RepDonBeyer You all know Paul Ryan had refused to bring bipartisan bills to the floor for months! Why don't you all just say that? Sickening. YOU all lose. We all lose!
955214548700610560 2018-01-21 23:04:30 UTC <catteadams> @sarahcpr @joshgondelman Congrats! Have fun! You'll be great as always.
955213545343410176 2018-01-21 23:00:30 UTC <catteadams> @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @MSNBC @MichNazz They have had bi partisan bills ready to go for months. Ryan won't bring them to the floor. So then what? He's truly evil. And I never use that word. But this train is heading for a wall of it's own.
955212850758221824 2018-01-21 22:57:45 UTC <catteadams> @MSNBC So NOW you decide to tell the truth. Too late pal. You said you wanted it, you made it yours, and now you're mad at the baby man you elected and aligned yourself with?  GTFOH
955210893763125248 2018-01-21 22:49:58 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz There's no poppin' in and poppin' out of a grocery store on Sunday. Unmanageable humanity. LOL

But you took back your power! There's excitement in that too! Shake away, you earned it! YOU WON! Soon you'll be indifferent to them.
955208693552889856 2018-01-21 22:41:14 UTC <catteadams> @ambertamblyn @VocalizeMeToo @MelissaJPeltier @Alyssa_Milano @NancySinatra @EllenBarkin @KarenMKunkle You did it! They will never have the power again. Congrats....one day at a time. Proud of you.
955206170435661825 2018-01-21 22:31:12 UTC <catteadams> @ambertamblyn @VocalizeMeToo @MelissaJPeltier @Alyssa_Milano @NancySinatra @EllenBarkin @KarenMKunkle It happened to me. I left immediately. I regretted that later. I wish I had stayed and taken my power over the situation.  I'm no longer anyone's victim. Don't give your power away. Hold your head up and mentally repeat F U. This is  MY space and I'm not moving.
954949257592631297 2018-01-20 05:30:19 UTC <catteadams> So now, when I hear that Trumps watches at least 8 hours a day of TV, I'm doing the real time conversion of TV watching hours, to porn watching hours.  I didn't want to ever have these kinds of thoughts in life.  Stay classy, President Trump.
954939016159289344 2018-01-20 04:49:38 UTC <catteadams> @tdawgdiggity Mine too.
954935343026921472 2018-01-20 04:35:02 UTC <catteadams> @tdawgdiggity They're beautiful to us tho. And we have to feed them, clothe them, school them, chaperone them, and keep them safe for 18 years.  WE HAVE to love them and think they're cute. Or we'd leave them out in a corn field, ya know? 
954934508159053826 2018-01-20 04:31:43 UTC <catteadams> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @Philosocrat @tedlieu As Ryan lies on his page and says it's all DEMS fault I wonder....do those that support him know how many bi- partisan Immigration bills that never made it to the floor because of him? In my lifetime I had never heard so many lies coming out of the shite house/GOP.  63yrs young
954933195643936769 2018-01-20 04:26:30 UTC <catteadams> @thehill @IhateTr17338238 Oh wow. I've been there before. At will employees have absolutely nothing to hold on to. And I have been fired at will also. It always hurts. Especially when you have tons of skills but no net. Lots of jobs like that. Independent contractor is the nice word for NO RIGHTS 
954929134819422210 2018-01-20 04:10:22 UTC <catteadams> @NatashaBertrand @Kimsuesmom Does this mean there is literally NOTHING in place 2 prevent this? In years past, we only went by traditions, norms, not actual rules, laws? Then we better get our ass in gear & change all of these things he has broken, into unbreakables. Look who he has around him. We want this?
954927564983648258 2018-01-20 04:04:07 UTC <catteadams> @thehill @branch_4th I wouldn't put it all at the feet of the left. That's too easy. Could be one person's bad judgement or prejudice or just crap management always trying to protect their ass. They had a policy in place that addressed this.  But she should have never been fired. And I hope she wins.
954927038720196608 2018-01-20 04:02:02 UTC <catteadams> @thehill She should have been reprimanded. Reminded of policy. Nothing more. Not fired. I hope she wins her case. It's just wrong.
954926491610972162 2018-01-20 03:59:51 UTC <catteadams> @AprilDRyan @dylanakent That's what I'm workin with. Oy yoi yoi
954926418042875905 2018-01-20 03:59:34 UTC <catteadams> @AprilDRyan @dylanakent In my family it's less than 100 yrs. My brother named his child after our grandmother. When  my uncle McCullough came to visit, he proudly told him that he named his daughter McCullough, not even realizing he was speaking to his grandmother's son. My mother's only brother. Geeze.
954925541462691840 2018-01-20 03:56:05 UTC <catteadams> @AprilDRyan @dylanakent And it breaks my heart. I have family who voted for Trump. They listen to nothing but FOX. When you give them other information, and facts. They have never heard it. Had no idea there might be opposing viewpoints that are salient and true. And they don't know only truth matters
954924522863411200 2018-01-20 03:52:02 UTC <catteadams> RT pls. All day long.https://youtu.be/eISqVL2h7cE
954923230887686144 2018-01-20 03:46:54 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Let's stop pretending there aren't bipartisan bills ready to come to the floor. YOU wont let them. So cut the horse shit. You have 8 years to put together an immigrant bill. What were YOU doing? This is your stuff right here. YOU own this. Stop lying already. WE read. #NOTFOXNEWS
954922358287998976 2018-01-20 03:43:26 UTC <catteadams> @AprilDRyan @dylanakent I wudn't even say fictional elite, it's lower than that. It's fictional "I'm better than you" 8th grade ignorance & fear.  They haven't lived w/ grandparents, theyve forgotten them, never met them, or don't care what they were about It's, I, me, mine, & now X. There is no history
954921441153056769 2018-01-20 03:39:47 UTC <catteadams> @AprilDRyan We are seeing a new thing now. This is the dissembling of our institutions. This is changing policy based on Nationalism and fear based "others" as bad guys.  PPL of reason know better. But those that would not be informed will by sound bites. #FOXNEWSworshipBREEDSfools
954919969711579137 2018-01-20 03:33:56 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed Critical care places are open on Sundays. If it gets worse it's bacterial. If it stays the same it's usually virus and it had to leave on it's own. But don't mess around if it's gets worse. I'm throwin' down my Momma card on this one.
954919630925004800 2018-01-20 03:32:36 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley I should download this and blow it up in Photoshop. Bet half the stuff on the wall is FAKE Trump news too. From Alumni praises to graduation awards. Oh, and a few mayor Gulianni BS citations...LOL
954918863522619392 2018-01-20 03:29:33 UTC <catteadams> @thehill WOW. He's finally right about something. But I'd like to ask, what happened to Mr. tough guy, the Greatest, Make 'Merica Great Again, maggilla gorilla, negotiator/deal maker we heard tell of all of 2016, 2017?  Doesn't exist. It was just a cartoon character.
954916986814832641 2018-01-20 03:22:05 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley I guess every day is casual Friday in his mind. No particular reason to get dressed up every day for the White House or the presidency. Unless it's GOLF day. Cuz, he ain't stayin'.
954916400258170880 2018-01-20 03:19:45 UTC <catteadams> @DonaldJTrumpJr @TeaPainUSA @Dovewoman1 Certainly explains the body language. So painful to watch her with hm. Choices. The consequences always hit you when you get older if they don't kill you in the moment....they wait around like a groupie. Just waiting to get their 15 minutes of fame.

954623465943740416 2018-01-19 07:55:44 UTC <catteadams> #TrumpShutdown .  @realDonaldTrump You own this one kiddo. Cuz, Mr. big pants has no plan, no idea of what he wants, and no clue as to governance. Too busy watching porn I guess.
954622779751460864 2018-01-19 07:53:01 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle It's the only way for me to go. I got so much hate stuff last year over stupid stuff really.... I finally said to myself, what do I need this 4?  Then I answered myself... You DONT!  HAHAHAHAHAHA I am so much lighter this year. My block button is like the Vulcan death grip!
954620346367320064 2018-01-19 07:43:21 UTC <catteadams> @ProudResister @DavidSamson47 They needed 60 votes to pass. So they needed some democrats to vote for it.  Kind of an insurance measure to insure both sides work together.
954560972374523904 2018-01-19 03:47:25 UTC <catteadams> #TrumpShutdown . @realDonaldTrump  Can we please remember now that you are the one who said, "if the govt. shuts down, it's gotta be the guy at the top's fault."  Thats gotta be you dude. Or has the game changed, now that you ACTUALLY know what that means?
954560224366440448 2018-01-19 03:44:27 UTC <catteadams> @gettinnoticedmo RANDOM THOUGHTS.... If you went out to a comedy club and saw a comedian say "I'm Fredrick Douglass on Twitter" would you, as a dead guy, maybe even a dead comedian, (Fredrick was many things) still be mad that someone was stealing your shit?
954559113869979648 2018-01-19 03:40:02 UTC <catteadams> @sinbadbad You made me laugh, Sinbad.  And there's nothing to laugh about tonight. Less you say sumthin like that.
954558573253570560 2018-01-19 03:37:53 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @renato_mariotti @leetrautman Yeah, so sad. I remember when McConnell issued his, LET NOTHING PASS edict during Obama. SAD< indeed.
954558140254531584 2018-01-19 03:36:10 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @renato_mariotti @jmccullo Illegal tax payers too. Shameful. They should all be on welfare. Helps the narrative more.
954557558886313984 2018-01-19 03:33:51 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @renato_mariotti I see how you didn't say, you control the white house. LOL There's nothing in control over there.
954555120720560129 2018-01-19 03:24:10 UTC <catteadams> @TopherSpiro @voncile2016 Then I guess we can also forget "MEXICO will pay for the wall!"  HA  HA HAHAHAHAHAHAH HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHAH Cuz Trump knows nothing about how bills are made, passed, and least of all...NEGOTIATED.  Thought he was the BIG negotiator? What a joke. And all the MAGA ppl bought it.
954554366102462464 2018-01-19 03:21:10 UTC <catteadams> @TopherSpiro Exactly who is this "everyone" that forgets? I sure as hell Haven't. Don't. Won't.
954553796461436928 2018-01-19 03:18:54 UTC <catteadams> Welp. Here we go. This is the shutdown Trump so arrogantly & ignorantly orchestrated. & McConnell looks like a damn fool. What an end 2 his career. Limping away like this. Hanging his head in shame. This is what happens when U elect & support someone who knows NOTHING about govt.
954552767128809472 2018-01-19 03:14:49 UTC <catteadams> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Dovewoman1 @TeaPainUSA And booking porn stars, as social companions. Cuz, Melania is not having that mess after her public humiliation by Trump, this week.  What a cad.
954551847171211264 2018-01-19 03:11:09 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle I love losing Trump followers. I haven't got that kind of time left in my life. I only let positive or funny and fun ppl in my timeline. Like YOU. Pick ppl like yourself. Block the rest. LOL Tell them I said so. LOL
954551208093483008 2018-01-19 03:08:37 UTC <catteadams> Trump: No wall, no deal.  US: But, but, but, you said Mexico would pay for it! Trump: Oh come on, you didn't fall for that did you? US: ummm yeah, lots of us did. Trump: Jesus! What a bunch of shit hole RUBES! Shut it down, then. I dont give a shit. I'm late for golf!
954549973374218242 2018-01-19 03:03:42 UTC <catteadams> @sinbadbad I can boycott Netflix. We have more power and it strikes fast when we use it. I love Mo'nique & think she's brave. Speaks her mind. She's speaking 4 all of us.  I hope more ppl will lend their support 2 her. How can we not?  Goes without saying I knew you would be supportive
954547790679498752 2018-01-19 02:55:02 UTC <catteadams> @fredcate always nice 2 have a boogey man.  It just feels so damn good to blame someone. 3 Branches of govt. GOP has maj in all. But it's still the DEMS fault. lololol GOP cant even get a bill to the floor. Too busy blaming Obama for 8 yrs.  No plans, now that its their swing at bat. 
954545359950299136 2018-01-19 02:45:23 UTC <catteadams> @acloughpbp I think I know that drummer.  Hope he didn't give her a rim shot.
954544382392156160 2018-01-19 02:41:29 UTC <catteadams> @SenDeanHeller I love how you blame the Dems. lolololol You have all three branches of Govt locked up. But it's the Dems fault. You guys are all the same. And so are your hollow rants. You made this steaming pile of garbage. Now you wanna say it's not yours.  Good one!
954542483957956608 2018-01-19 02:33:57 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle Govt. shutting down & the GOP saying "it's the DEMS FAULT!" My god how many branches of power do they need to hold, to get a damn bill put up on the floor?  Oh. wait! They already have them all U say? We R real ppl. Not little numbers. They are treating this like it's NBD.
954540600728043521 2018-01-19 02:26:28 UTC <catteadams> @KamalaHarris Thank you for being there for all of us Kamela!
954540298712985600 2018-01-19 02:25:16 UTC <catteadams> @MissButter Well, I guess he better buck up. We work on birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and all the days in between.  So.....awwwwwwww.....poor Trump.  Just kidding. NO sympathy, here. 
954538249011081217 2018-01-19 02:17:07 UTC <catteadams> On really sickening news days like today, it really helps when you can whip up a mean old fashioned chop-suey of your youth, for sheer comfort!

Any doctor that is prescribing 1 or both MUST tell their patients that combining them is certain death. Dont prescribe both. Warn PPL if prescribing evn 1

Dont think doctors know what they R doing prescribing it the way they do. This did NOT have 2 happen. How many more ppl have 2 die this way until we stop this? So sad

But as a human being I feel for her. She probably didnt factor in public humiliation on this scale. *shudder And yet, she knew he was a bag of worms.  Everything is a trade off, I guess

I've never heard anything abut drugs regarding him. It would only add another level of sad, sad, sad, & awful 2 the already awful stories & behavior I have seen. God this story just gets worse & worse. Who has doc. anything about his drug use? I'd like to know.
954271874648719362 2018-01-19 08:38:39 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost Ok. But, like the word "complicit", does she really know what "rivet" means?  How about the word, "genius"? Like, is she "a really smart" daughter "with a good brain" like her dad?  Oh man. This is so confusingly weird.  I'd like Charles Nelson Riley, to block, please. Forever.

That's my T.

The subservient role he puts women in is so disturbing. There R so many women that have been abused & a predator knows EXACTLY how 2 appeal to them. 1 that has been abused can also grow into an abuser. I'm afraid that's exactly what he looks like. I hope I'm wrong

His were all very creepy and made me feel sick inside. That's coming from a very real place. Whatever happened to him truly screwed him up. He needs help.

PPL change over time as does consciousness so I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt. But his misogyny is sick and extremely unconscious.  There is something really wrong with this man.  He has serous anger/control issues re: women
953853963194875904 2018-01-17 04:58:01 UTC <catteadams> @marcushjohnson We now live in the upside down land of the absurd.  Ruled by the racist hypocrites.  Oh. And also ruled by "Christians".
953852543506919425 2018-01-17 04:52:22 UTC <catteadams> @TheRickyDavila This is what we are dealing with. And this is who will be voted out. An old white man who won't even give this woman the dignity of an answer.  Runs away. COWARD. She run and should take his seat away from him.  I applaud HER courage.
953850992944037889 2018-01-17 04:46:13 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed Can't be both. It became clear she was editing her language to me but spewing this hate to others. It made me sick. And it hurt very badly. My daughter's half black, we are a very mixed family on all sides. So what was she saying behind my back? Probably the same stuff. :(
953850287957004288 2018-01-17 04:43:24 UTC <catteadams> @vanesstvlvr @kurteichenwald @neyney2go @terri_albertsen Dont think for one minute that weight is an accurate number either. It ain't. No sir. Not possible.
953849244393160704 2018-01-17 04:39:16 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed I still like this person a lot and she's a great person. Do anything for you. But I saw the horrific things she was saying about Dems/Obama on FB and I was like, what? Who is this person? Really ugly stuff. It was, BYE Felicia after that.
953848721472499713 2018-01-17 04:37:11 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed Yeah, me too. School friend since 8th grade. Michigan folks vote this way a lot. Even my dad voted for Nixon. Ha ha ha. But he never got over that. LOL Dem after that.
953847822037614592 2018-01-17 04:33:37 UTC <catteadams> @culturedstate What a novel, yet completely pointless exercise in futility. It sounds like a good edition to start my bar b que for the weekend, however.
953846807057989632 2018-01-17 04:29:35 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed Yup. Some in my family. Voting against their interests until it hits home. Too ignorant to do anything but parrot Fox news. Disappointing.
953845676525289472 2018-01-17 04:25:05 UTC <catteadams> @sarahwhelmed I applaud your honesty. I did the same thing. However every time I try to talk to a Trumpster they attack and won't  listen or dialogue.  They immediately descend into name calling in seconds.  I just block, cuz I won't be brought down to that level.  It's just too ugly.
953844360348499970 2018-01-17 04:19:51 UTC <catteadams> BOOM. The hypocrisy is absolutely incredible. Almost beyond belief, and yet, it's happening.https://twitter.com/AidenWolfe/status/953811080782008320
953843689243095041 2018-01-17 04:17:11 UTC <catteadams> @sharonstone @ladyhaja PS....And you earned that laugh and answer with your question. Love Sharon Stone! Honey, she served you. After 40 years in this business nothing gets past Ms. Stone.   NOTHING.
953841206466768896 2018-01-17 04:07:19 UTC <catteadams> @sharonstone @ladyhaja @cvborges I felt her heat the minute he asked her. And I think she gave him a slap back he wasn't expecting. You could tell he was bugged.. Tit for tat. And if you're going to ask questions like that, expect to get a fierce answer. The laugh said it all. #SharonStone is my hera~!!!!!
953839971944706048 2018-01-17 04:02:25 UTC <catteadams> @sharonstone @ladyhaja Micro-aggression in his face/tone. "well that's why I asked." That's how it is to feel angry because you've been laughed at or minimized by the very things you say. That's how women have been treated forever. Not so nice, is it?
953833016496766980 2018-01-17 03:34:47 UTC <catteadams> @owillis As long as you're the uncle that brings popscicles you'll never have to
953826820901629952 2018-01-17 03:10:10 UTC <catteadams> @TheRickyDavila Well said. I agree. And remember he has lied 2000 times since elected and in office. But a year....fake news indeed.
953826143999700992 2018-01-17 03:07:28 UTC <catteadams> @Ottawakel Always will be. Super nice person. Very respectful to the band. A good soul. We love her!

953820285492379649 2018-01-17 02:44:11 UTC <catteadams> @Ottawakel Truer words have never been spoken. Too bad he doesn't know anything about being a real man.
953819709908004864 2018-01-17 02:41:54 UTC <catteadams> @JuddLegum This is exactly what happens when you run a candidate that is against everything but has no plans for what he may be for.  McConnell knew who he was when he gave him the party and the keys to the white house. So boo hooo hooo, McConnell. This was your choice.
953818703845498880 2018-01-17 02:37:54 UTC <catteadams> @TigNotaro @RedTRaccoon Her acting was so bad the first season I couldn't hang. Maybe I'll go back and catch the other seasons now.  Everyone gets better.
953818192132022272 2018-01-17 02:35:52 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @Ottawakel HEH HEH....so glad it was just the regular kind of rat. They sent up room a service guy, no joke, a guy with a food tray and a cover. He trapped it in the corner & slid the tray under it & WHAM! slammed the cover over it. Made me think, hmmm...that's not the first rat he's caught
953816031016796160 2018-01-17 02:27:17 UTC <catteadams> @EricTrump @foxandfriends Represent? Not exactly. Just not bright enough to be interesting or compelling. Must be a drag being Eric.

All your vile nature comes forth cuz you feel threatened by a joke? Impressive amount of immaturity.   Julia, you get the block. Oh, PS. Your info has been debunked over and over again. Making you fearful & uninformed But you stay classy. Mmkkkk?
953500383535497216 2018-01-16 05:33:01 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Hope you didn't get the rat room. I'd love to meet Ms Maples. I never have had the pleasure. And I did not know you direct.  Surprise!
953499744130625536 2018-01-16 05:30:28 UTC <catteadams> @allison1025 Friend of @KarenMKunkle ...wanted to ask you about Corey. Having trouble finding articles that explain who he really is. He's got great control of the narrative. But there's something not right there.
953499227396558848 2018-01-16 05:28:25 UTC <catteadams> @allison1025 @loveyou2nite @KarenMKunkle Your tweet is making me very happy. Continue to prosper and be as special as you are, and as special as you are to all of us out here, that you help.  Me included.
953498447587323904 2018-01-16 05:25:19 UTC <catteadams> I don't know about you guys, but this past year has felt like a millennium.  That is all.
953497330346467328 2018-01-16 05:20:53 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Did you ever play the Taj Mahal in AC? What a complete dump. I had a rat in my room. And I had the opening act room!  Gaudy, big, so weirdly decorated gold and black, the penthouse view, and a big fat rat. Foreshadowing? Yasssss.
953495989431582720 2018-01-16 05:15:33 UTC <catteadams> @ericgarland @RedheadFBG Amen to that. They are a scary lot and they will skulk in the wings until the coast is clear. Then BOOM! Back in and doing their dastardly stuff again.
953493978397093888 2018-01-16 05:07:34 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold I've been waiting for his bodyguard to surface. His loyalty must be boneyard, man.

But those are old now too. He's a difficult person to figure out. I have sure tried. I hope you're doing good Karen.
953476297627385856 2018-01-16 03:57:18 UTC <catteadams> Boy that falls in line with Trump's belief in "good genes and bad genes". And how embarrassing for a doctor to say that.https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/953375315543429120

953473433676824578 2018-01-16 03:45:55 UTC <catteadams> @realTomShae It's not gonna happen. PPL are too damn lazy to get off their couch and go vote or do what it takes to get it to pass. So, nah...it's just a bunch of whining that goes nowhere.
953473041119330304 2018-01-16 03:44:22 UTC <catteadams> Born in Upper Michigan. I've seen this all before. We're gonna be our own state! No one even knows we're up here! Then. Nothing happens. PPL go back to football and beer by Sunday. Snore...ZZZzzzzzZZZZZZz 
953472289621737473 2018-01-16 03:41:23 UTC <catteadams> Pls vote and RT. I can't believe the results so far. They must be echo's of Trumpers.https://twitter.com/pollsofpolitics/status/953341232146628608
953471927737139200 2018-01-16 03:39:56 UTC <catteadams> @activist360 I felt like a proud American again, for the first time since the election return.
953471549528449024 2018-01-16 03:38:26 UTC <catteadams> @activist360 Cory @SenBooker  FINALLY! Someone armed w/ the truth excoriates another Trump "amnesia" witness. A witness 2 the truth of the meeting she was in when Trump called countries shit holes. She tried 2 cleverly & smugly not answer/play dumb.  Not on his watch. Thank God 4 Cory Booker!
953461893846392832 2018-01-16 03:00:04 UTC <catteadams> Bannon is so happy cameras are following him again.  He almost looks giddy.
953435582893514752 2018-01-16 01:15:31 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @SDotSDotSDotS He's just babbling at this point. Saying anything. And evidently on Ambien. LOLOL So much for his claim of "I've never taken drugs or had a drink in my life." BWAAAA HA HA HA HA
953435276931559425 2018-01-16 01:14:18 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This is why you shouldn't be taking Ambien and getting up after 4 hours. You're delusional. You are despised by the black Americans in my family. And that's a lot of people. Also, you lost the popular vote.  Two factoids even an Ambien haze can't change.
953429293710757888 2018-01-16 00:50:32 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley How far are we traveling to get here? The hubster's all in.

953427827944169472 2018-01-16 00:44:42 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic Where do they come from?
953423244182175744 2018-01-16 00:26:29 UTC <catteadams> @loveyou2nite @KarenMKunkle Where is the article saying he starved them, drugged them? Where is that? Frankly if someone did to me what she did, I'd be mad as hell too. I'm not seeing abuse here so where is the actual abuse? What she did was unprofessional. There's much more to this story.
953421679782318080 2018-01-16 00:20:16 UTC <catteadams> @unscriptedmike Since when are ppl all one thing or another?  If you have lived on the planet for any length of time at all you know that ppl are complicated, life is messy, and nothing is as it seems. Grow up.  That you might delight in another's confusion and pain says more about YOU than them
953247726023528448 2018-01-16 12:49:03 UTC <catteadams> @alfranken @trolltrumptower @EdanClay True. Had there been a committee investigation he would have been exonerated. Why did they not let it take place? I'd like that Q. answered by the Democrats..
953246514788225027 2018-01-16 12:44:14 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @mrs_w73 Some are some are not. Depends on who you know and who you hang with. I've seen/experienced lots of compassion out here. Gay community is also very supportive. Everyone has their own path for their own reasons. I try not to judge it. We've been thru enuf. All of us.
953203269102268416 2018-01-16 09:52:23 UTC <catteadams> Can't wait for this one to hit the light of day.https://twitter.com/EdKrassen/status/953015685826846720

953194536431370246 2018-01-16 09:17:41 UTC <catteadams> If I change my avatar to a great historical male figure will I get the quality DM's too? I only get offers from web page developers.  Half price weekends deals. Not even close.
953193789576830976 2018-01-16 09:14:43 UTC <catteadams> She can send them to me.  I'll screen them for you. I have a pretty good eye. The one, anyway.
953190454316564480 2018-01-16 09:01:28 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid I swear to god these old white men wear me the fuck out. They are exhausting to put up with.... It's like a smoke alarm is going off and they all look around saying "Someone answer the phone." GAHHHHHHH!
953189319849664512 2018-01-16 08:56:57 UTC <catteadams> This love story is so tender, I have tears.  I hope they make a movie out of it.  I don't know who should play you tho... It could be the comeback role of a lifetime for you. You might want to consider it. I know it would be green lighted. #SayYes
953186775685410816 2018-01-16 08:46:51 UTC <catteadams> @ParilloGary @homemadeguitars These ppl have no shame. They know what they are doing every step of the way. They are degenerate gamblers just playing high stakes odds. They need to go away for good, and never be heard from again.
953186287791480837 2018-01-16 08:44:55 UTC <catteadams> @PattyArquette I'd like to know what the hell was wrong with Kathie Klages that she covered for him? She was so complicit in helping to shield him. And so more women went onto being abused because of it. What is her story? And where did she end up in this horrific abuse case?
953184759622000640 2018-01-16 08:38:50 UTC <catteadams> @PattyArquette I am encouraged tht the judge has allowed this much time & testimony regarding this man's crimes against innocent women & children. We are turning an important page in history. their testimonies will be powerful.  Thank you for your courage Simone Biles.  You are a true champion!
953179194086768640 2018-01-16 08:16:43 UTC <catteadams> @PalmerReport @SDotSDotSDotS He's so insecure and immature. He's the easiest play on earth. And that is more than sad, as a president of a nation. It's pathetic.  We have to turn this sinking ship around. And we will. More ppl of good will and character than bad. #BlueWave2018

953173598998380545 2018-01-15 07:54:29 UTC <catteadams> This is such a frightening story. If a world famous world class athlete can't even get adequate care.......https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/953171225504813056

953164005111078912 2018-01-15 07:16:22 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX I was raised to accommodate men. It took decades to find my own power. And then I had to fight for it, from that point on.
953157326168457216 2018-01-15 06:49:50 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Good god almighty...glad I didn't see that. Sad that there's always someone who will sell a whole group of ppl out for a little TV fame.

953150187479867392 2018-01-15 06:21:28 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX You R right. As a young woman & even a grown woman I have been badgered into sex by men & succumbed w/ a "Oh god, lets get this over with" attitude because I didn't know how to get out of it.  Its hard to explain I never felt empowered or strong enuf to change the outcome safely.

953060839937884166 2018-01-15 00:26:25 UTC <catteadams> I can't believe how many times Trump has said "I am the least racist person you have ever met." This is not only a problem, it's a huge tell.

952850109716340736 2018-01-15 10:29:03 UTC <catteadams> I had the best Kobe burger I have ever had (outside of Japan) tonight. So many places say they have them, charge a fortune & they are...ummm...not Kobe burgers.  Not like in Japan. Not by a long shot. So, I was delighted to have a real one tonight. GOOD OLD ORANGE COUNTY MAN!

952448146629513216 2018-01-13 07:51:48 UTC <catteadams> Frustrated dudes with zero game do this. To put fingers in someone's mouth like that is clearly someone who is so used to porn he doesn't know what real women love and despise. I can't think of anything more gross. And infantile.
952446233691353088 2018-01-13 07:44:12 UTC <catteadams> @kathbarbadoro That's what I thought. This is a guy with zero game. Seems immature as hell. Not only doesn't read a woman's body signals but has no idea what a "YES I'm loving this" is, or "NO, you are getting really fucking weird" is. YUK. This story is very messy.

What other statistics that high would be allowed to stand without huge outcry & tremendous efforts 2 change them? What if those stats were 4 murder of children? Surely the murder of a child's soul should count.
952381018400423936 2018-01-13 03:25:03 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost When I initially saw this interview I thought what the holy hell did this man just say? It went by in a micro blip & I was shocked no more came of it. Why these guys report on sexual assault and misogyny but can't see this behavior in themselves, is so much of the problem

951697183807479808 2018-01-11 06:07:44 UTC <catteadams> The same and worse. When it was about women no one blinked. When it was about blacks in America, no one blinked. Now it's about black/brown from other countries. We're all up in our feelings. Sweet Jesus. Can we get our dignity/I'm so offended/ this is the limit/ alarm straight?

951695846122209280 2018-01-11 06:02:26 UTC <catteadams> Ok. I'm old. I grew up w/ the news of Walter Cronkite.  Huntley & Brinkley. Never, did I hear the word shit hole.  Today I have heard it used relentlessly on the news. I blame Trump. Because he is the architect of this adversity. No one else. GOP going down in shit hole flames.

951692311901057024 2018-01-11 05:48:23 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost Forget the pay cut. Why not insist that women be paid in parity or you say no to the projects? All MEN. This is such a no brainer. Why don't the male actors ever think this way? Oh yeah.  They don't have to.

Its not gonna pass over.

951666739674169344 2018-01-11 04:06:46 UTC <catteadams> @owillis & the GOP's who still support him and defend him. The worst kind of cynicism. And what of the men and women in service right now in  Africa? Will they will have the mililtary support they had before his racist comment? He puts them in harms way. He's no leader. No president.

951601633095331842 2018-01-11 23:48:03 UTC <catteadams> @senorrinhatch U can't fix this 1 Senator. Oh, you'll try. You'll say, that's not what he meant or I don't agree with the president and that's OK, we dont have to agree on everything, but the fact remains.  U allow a racist 2 B president w/o shame or consequence. And that's why we'll vote U out
951599679048962048 2018-01-11 23:40:18 UTC <catteadams> This is important to know. Once a serial creep always a serial creep. Somebody needs to sue this basted.https://twitter.com/calebecarma/status/951598049624842246
951599297828552704 2018-01-11 23:38:47 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed Not to be picky but does Trump even know Africa is NOT a country? Africa is a continent with 54 different countries. And he is the dumbest president on earth.
951598144323698688 2018-01-11 23:34:12 UTC <catteadams> @CleverTitleTK @victoriastudio2 @derkiletian The census at that time and up to 1950 listed the country you were from and if you were not a citizen of USA also. Pretty fascinating to read them.
951565585439064064 2018-01-11 21:24:49 UTC <catteadams> @kaitlancollins Babysitter arrives at 9 AM and is told, you need to go right in there, right now!
951564559499673600 2018-01-11 21:20:44 UTC <catteadams> @brycetache Sneaky to Trump because he's a dumb ass. She did what she did right out in the open and it was going to be released anyway. So enough of the 6th grade school yard name calling. What a whining, baby child, posing as a POTUS.
951563866193850368 2018-01-11 21:17:59 UTC <catteadams> @CleverTitleTK @derkiletian @victoriastudio2 When ppl migrated and went thru Ellis island they needed a sponsor too didn't they? I kinda remember my gram saying that her sisters needed someone they knew over here to sponsor them before they could get in. They had to have as skill as well. This is way back in the day.
951559874827075584 2018-01-11 21:02:07 UTC <catteadams> @debphs5270 Hi Deb! Happy New Year my friend! How's it going? I know it's been cold. Brrrrrr....but that gives everyone a good reason to have a hot toddie. LOL If I were there I'd roll down a park hill with ya. :) Make a few snow angels too!
951559086755037184 2018-01-11 20:59:00 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 Well, somebody has to buy/go see/hear/music or I wouldn't have a job. LOL

951390394176061440 2018-01-11 09:48:40 UTC <catteadams> @LadyThriller69 Any and every time. Like minded hearts can heal each other. We all need soft places in which to fall when this happens, never judgement. It took me years, a decade or more. Many years of therapy helped me to heal & get strong. So did support groups. I'm good now, at 63.
951388841650171904 2018-01-11 09:42:30 UTC <catteadams> @LadyThriller69 I honor your path to healing. Blast away. It's not about anyone else to say how we get where we need to be. You can jump in on my timeline any time. I will always be supportive. And I am so very sorry this has happened to you and your family. The pain is unbelievable.
951388017993777152 2018-01-11 09:39:14 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 I agree. Same thing in Japan however overweight kids were everywhere. It's a real problem there too now. Are you also a touring musician too? And can I join your tour? LOL Kidding.  I've hung up my travel bags.  Just couldn't live out of a suitcase after 40 plus years.
951387075764412416 2018-01-11 09:35:29 UTC <catteadams> @EdKrassen I knew there was a good reason I can never understand him. I graduated from fourth grade in 1963.  I was 8.
951380666725253121 2018-01-11 09:10:01 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost Gee whiz.  Hope they weren't all evangelical and shit. Why is it so hard to want what you have, when you have what you want?
951380161487781890 2018-01-11 09:08:00 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 On the other hand when McDonald's got to Japan they flipped out! KFC is huge there. Tastes different and really good. LOL Been to lots of countries that only had McD's. The French McD's had the most interesting food. Not at ALL like here.
951379511441948672 2018-01-11 09:05:25 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 Few American businesses when I was there.....no Starbucks. We were 1st western act to go over there & tour. We played the forbidden city. It was cool. So they brought over the lowest form of American food? :( Couldn't find a cup o Joe when I was there for love nor money. LOL

951365669752258560 2018-01-11 08:10:25 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 Sounds like my cup o tea. Aside from the spitting & all I'm sure you are enjoying yourself. There are so many truly wonderful things to see, places to go. And just stuff that's so different from what we know. At the time I went it was not overrun with KFC/McDonalds. LOL How Now?
951328123454242816 2018-01-10 05:41:14 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 I've yet to see Hong Kong.  My daughter went last year. She has me hooked on going now.
951323456947109888 2018-01-10 05:22:41 UTC <catteadams> @Trumpet1984 Oh sorry, didn't say how long. Three weeks in each place.

What a weird thing to even think about. I was there for an extended time and horrified going out in public. Cou'rage. Cou'rage. Hang in there.

Failure to see the truth for example.

Once they get into therapy or a healing program you start to look at your behavior more closely. And we change. Thats what I meant.  I do not profit from my abuse story personally.

But we really should not stomp on who gets there and how long it takes or how raggedy the road was getting woke. That anyone gets there at all & can heal from this is a miracle in & of itself.
950612919632277504 2018-01-08 06:19:16 UTC <catteadams> @jonlovett Seeing @IvankaTrump trying to speak to the #MeToo cause and Oprah's speech is sickening. Like someone pissing on a house fire to put out the flames, it's not enough. In order to come together we must first acknowledge the awful truths. What she's doing is lip service. NOT helpful
950607582955159552 2018-01-08 05:58:03 UTC <catteadams> So confidence is better than competence. Hmmm....I did not know that. Ok Trump voters and supporters. I'm gonna have to remember that.
950605413057118208 2018-01-08 05:49:26 UTC <catteadams> @JasonHalle Not only big pharma. Our political process and who gets elected has been hijacked by big corps, and their lobbyists. We need an overhaul. Get rid of superpacs, gerrymandering and limit ALL donations no matter where they come from or it will always be this way.
950602016677482498 2018-01-08 05:35:56 UTC <catteadams> @HolmesJosh Yo Josh. Plenty of DEMS are saying no to Oprah as a candidate.  She's not our last great hope, our savior, or our therapist. Shes a talk show host and an actor, philanthropist.  Will you please try to imagine a world that isnt group think? I know it will be hard, but try, honey.

Because her own father admits to sexual assault and she gives that a pass. It's hypocritical and hard to take.  Yes.  That's the problem.
950587822422990848 2018-01-08 04:39:32 UTC <catteadams> @espiers It's ignorance, indifference, unconsciousness with a hefty does of denial, in differing amounts. None of those qualities are good 4 a person's character, & make her statements hollow and phony. I hear a loud bell ring every time she does one of these.  She hears nothing.
950586265287602177 2018-01-08 04:33:21 UTC <catteadams> @AsiaArgento @rosemcgowan @MrChrisC84 @KarenMKunkle @ArlenePaulineK @EndinStealth I was really disappointed to read that tweet also. One thing I would hate to be judged on is my choices that in part stemmed from being groomed, molested and raped. Without therapy i wouldn't have known how to create boundaries, gain self respect and change for the better.

950577421668855808 2018-01-08 03:58:12 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX PREACH! And they can't see that at all. Try pointing it out and all the vitriol comes at YOU now. It's such an uphill climb some days I swear.
950576931644219392 2018-01-08 03:56:16 UTC <catteadams> @sinbadbad No. I actually didn't know you didn't mean that. It's hard to tell when someone is being literal on Twitter. I took you at your word. Some ppl donlt know who started it and why. Really.
950576617209786368 2018-01-08 03:55:01 UTC <catteadams> @sinbadbad She has an opinion. some dig her for it, some dont. I'm just glad ANYONE is standing with us. 30 years of harassment and assault is quite enough for me.

950554297913131008 2018-01-08 02:26:19 UTC <catteadams> More importantly Network TV doesn't want to KNOW from your personal politics, your religious stances or your UFO alien visitations.

950551097432686592 2018-01-08 02:13:36 UTC <catteadams> @eclecticbrotha All things R not equal tho. One is informed, communicates ideas beautifully, is a successful business woman who truly built an empire on her dime, not daddy's, and is smart enough to seek experts 2 inform herself and others. She is philanthropic, scandal free. Trump? NOT.

950487369576153089 2018-01-08 22:00:22 UTC <catteadams> @lynnv378 Number one thing I learned is when food and water goes in, the dog goes out immediately after. So every time they eat, or drink take them out immediately. They're gonna get the message quickly. Eat, drink, relieve outside.  Trained in no time flat. If you're consistent.

950317696142393344 2018-01-08 10:46:09 UTC <catteadams> @NstyWmnWendy @pricklyeater My new favorite word is whinging. And that's exactly what they do, day and night, chief among them Trump. The biggest whinger of all. Whine, whinge, cry foul, belly ache and act like the poorest sport among them all.  Big babies, all of them. Immature as all get out.

950309551110148096 2018-01-08 10:13:47 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @EdanClay I unfollowed him when he was just a candidate.  As if you aren't going to see the RT's. You will. PPL can't help themselves.  Then there's the news RT'S, bloggers etc..on and on and on. You're gonna see them even if you don't want to. lol
950308128163115008 2018-01-08 10:08:08 UTC <catteadams> @jonfavs @Guinz Well bless your heart.

950289758755766272 2018-01-08 08:55:08 UTC <catteadams> @JimmerThatisAll Sometimes it's hard to hear tone. Attitude. So ppl think their tweets are funnier than they read. See what I did there?
950288836780736518 2018-01-08 08:51:28 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @nixon_fulton There is no easy path to recovery from this kind of pain 4 anyone. Without therapy it's very, very hard to heal and many do not. Many go on to abuse others. It's lasting effects are still with me some 50 years later. So much therapy.  But I'm pretty good now.at 63.
950286580173848576 2018-01-08 08:42:30 UTC <catteadams> If for no other reason than to buy the thick softee toilet paper at Costco, I'm going tomorrow. Of course I'll buy that 12 can pack of pinto beans. & the flat of tomatoes. & those mind boggling, massive vats of dill pickle slices. The salmon. Sox, 6 pack  Wine Ya know I will
950277563858825216 2018-01-08 08:06:41 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman Such an original script! Superb writing. Giant of a show. Congrats all round, and champagne for everyone!
950275588526260230 2018-01-07 07:58:50 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl I was just gonna say ok, sure, and then I read this tweet again. The fearless part. THAT he is not. He smells of insecurity and fear masked by false bravado. I've seen it a million times. It always looks the same. Good luck w your adoration tho.
950273783020929024 2018-01-07 07:51:39 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX God when I saw that headline I just groaned. Come oooooooon. Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. We are soooo much better than this...R U kidding? Solution: Vote women IN.

950270730859560960 2018-01-07 07:39:32 UTC <catteadams> @POLITICOMag @politico W/ an applause addict as president who will sign anything in front of him 2 get more of it, yes.  I think they know they can put any damn thing they want 2 in front of their atta boy, as long as they praise him!  Theyre Floating their wildest hair crap, at this point. He'll sign.

950266554964361216 2018-01-07 07:22:56 UTC <catteadams> @jonfavs @lizzielou66 This I am aware of. Shaping a speech of that importance would be critical. But I have heard her say these things and eloquently forever. I am calm. Don't assume.
950266098724646912 2018-01-07 07:21:07 UTC <catteadams> @PalmerReport @ParilloGary I think his room must stink to high heaven. What with all the old grease and fast food smell and inevitable mean old man farts.
950265635509911552 2018-01-07 07:19:17 UTC <catteadams> I guess it's good that I don't know what they are or how to get to them. Cuz, I'm such a curious little monkey.
950264686779355136 2018-01-07 07:15:31 UTC <catteadams> @Guinz Gary, yo time is UP. Give the key back. We're gonna run some shit for a few hundred years now.

And tons of other superlative and unearned adjectives. But charismatic. Never heard that one. U know the other one we don't hear?  Great sense of humor. 
950263225974599680 2018-01-07 07:09:42 UTC <catteadams> @WeinfeldRuth @lesmarie99017 Welllllll, Yes. Since 2016, any famous person can be president without regard to qualifications, as is evidenced by the bone heads who voted for a game show host and a fraud, con artist.  Yup.  Anyone.
950262525756563456 2018-01-07 07:06:55 UTC <catteadams> He can't compete with Oprah's intellect, humanity, sincerity or good works over her entire lifetime. And he can't come close to touching her approval rating and fan support numbers throughout the world. Not in a million, billion years.
950261672823803904 2018-01-07 07:03:32 UTC <catteadams> @jonfavs @lizzielou66 If you think those are the words of a clever speech writer  and not hers, you haven't followed her career at all. She has said all this and more, many times over, and spontaneously so many times before on her shows. Just amazing what the naysayers wank on about on Twitter.
950260921020006400 2018-01-07 07:00:33 UTC <catteadams> @jonfavs @vegaslamb Oh how it was music to my ears too!
950260785099423745 2018-01-07 07:00:00 UTC <catteadams> @Guinz @jonfavs My god. Are we just gonna shut down every man who says something positive about women and/or Oprah and nit pic them to death because they didn't frame it the way you wanted them to ?....oh wait....these are trolls....for real trolls. Never mind 'em, Jon.
950260037020131328 2018-01-07 06:57:02 UTC <catteadams> @jonfavs She speaks to the world. I think about the little girls around the world who actually know who she is. But know no other American. It's a mind blower.
950259672014991361 2018-01-07 06:55:35 UTC <catteadams> @SafetyPinDaily So, they went up then. GAH. Weren't they at 36 at one point?
950258763348373505 2018-01-07 06:51:58 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @j3nnp4c3 @TrumpsBrain Well number one, you don't know all the other #MeToo victims in the world. So, another thoughtless and minimizing thing to say. You need to change your focus and do something useful and helpful. If you can prove it, do so. If not, you're just throwing stones. Do you. Seems simple
950257406444937216 2018-01-07 06:46:35 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @j3nnp4c3 @TrumpsBrain You know what? I won't. But he can tell his story all day long. I wish him health, and wellness. I sure woudn't want to have had his life.
950257134997925889 2018-01-07 06:45:30 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @j3nnp4c3 @TrumpsBrain How do you know he hasn't tho? You are supposing all kinds of things, and then judging him. It's path, what do you care? Do YOU. For god sake you don't have to listen, just mute or unfollow. Seems so simple a remedy.
950256515536977920 2018-01-07 06:43:02 UTC <catteadams> Oprah has made me cry many times in life.  But never have I felt so much hope and strength as tonight. Thank you Miss Oprah Winfrey. You have made a difference in my life. God bless you for it.
950253489011138560 2018-01-07 06:31:01 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman @j3nnp4c3 @TrumpsBrain That is a very callous thing to say. You can't quantify someone else's pain. You don't know what it takes for an abuse survivor to heal. But you do have an unfollow, mute and block button. Use it. And then you won't have to see or hear a wounded bird ever again.
950252673126752256 2018-01-07 06:27:46 UTC <catteadams> @Corey_Feldman Did you have to go thru years and years of therapy as a result of this abuse? Did you get help? I hope so. It takes a long time to recover from abuse. Do your brothers and sisters also have the same story regarding your parental abuse? Do they support your story and path?
950247679279296512 2018-01-07 06:07:56 UTC <catteadams> @KevOnStage You make me laugh so hard alone, in my house, my neighbors think I have company! I refuse to pipe down. LOL

950216948767326208 2018-01-07 04:05:49 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid @labmom22 You saw that too.  However, I have spontaneously hugged ppl before in excitement and joy. We probably all have. Those kinds of hugs are the least of my worries. That's an innocent thing. A caught up thing. Still....change is here, and it gives one pause for thought, about it all.
950213543671906304 2018-01-07 03:52:17 UTC <catteadams> @violadavis @JoyAnnReid Anything Viola does makes life, shivery good.
950212877566160896 2018-01-07 03:49:38 UTC <catteadams> @RheaButcher If you ever get a chance, listen in on a head set to the producer / director calling the show. Your ears will smoke! They scramble and yell and cuss and get pretty heated by those little gaffs. And then, on to the next fire. Such an eye opener to the stress of that gig.
950211953573576710 2018-01-07 03:45:58 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Nixon had a war with the news agency's tho...and he was petty about it too.

950195247971094529 2018-01-07 02:39:35 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @shawgerald4 @christian73020 Said 22 followers, I'm unfollowing. Cause caps. They're all the same. Caps. No gowns.
950194586185433088 2018-01-07 02:36:57 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump Good god man. What in the hell are you talking about? You sound like a man with a serious mental problem.  Not a good look. Eat your burger and sleep with your bucket of chicken. You have issues.
950192775449821185 2018-01-07 02:29:46 UTC <catteadams> @LABLifeBreath @TheRock @SimoneGJohnson @LungCancerFaces I did NOT know that stat. I am flabbergasted by that.
950192414781669376 2018-01-07 02:28:20 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj I've seen it. I'm talking about USA.
950192290647035904 2018-01-07 02:27:50 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj I would suggest the top 4 reasons anyone is homeless is financial. No? Money and resources give you options.
950191948609986560 2018-01-07 02:26:28 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj And to be sure I am not an expert in this field. Just someone trying to understand. Make a difference. Do what I can. So I try to see the problem from many angles. We have a great new and innovative program here in Calif. I hope the nation takes note.
950191457595310083 2018-01-07 02:24:31 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj Poverty is the most pressing issue. Women R the more vulnerable and women with children the most vulnerable. Perhaps that is why it seems more pressing. There are so many homeless children. They surely should come first. REgardless what gender the parent is. It's a complex issue.
950190370226237440 2018-01-07 02:20:12 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj From what I understand there are hidden homeless which tend to be women. It is just more dangerous for women to sleep rough or stay on the streets. They are easy prey. Also some shelters address children first. More women than men have children to care for when homeless.
950187030524305408 2018-01-07 02:06:56 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj Not only homeless are poor. So are we talking about who is the most poor?  Still women. As for the stat you use I would have to look into that. I'm not sure about charities being more avail for women than men. Good point tho.I'll look into it.  Still have a lot to learn myself.
950185631174475776 2018-01-07 02:01:22 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray @chaboi_bacobj You do know what Google is, right?
950184592673140736 2018-01-07 01:57:15 UTC <catteadams> @TomiLahren @2020fight @Gwendolyn66627 So unready for the fall. The token pretty, young one, for now.  With zero power.  SAD. I guess it's convenient to ignore the network's power structure over there. And their horrific sexual assault history too. That didn't end. It's still going on. Awwwww, Tomi. Poor little fool.
950180915841347584 2018-01-07 01:42:38 UTC <catteadams> @TomiLahren @2020fight Oh, damn your intelligence and logic.  She is a talking point repeater. Not a deep thinker.  Don't expect too much from her Tweets.  They are laughable, immature and fluff.   Have a laugh, and a tipple per foolish TWT.   It's a fun drinking game.
950179271443562496 2018-01-07 01:36:06 UTC <catteadams> @TomiLahren The Hollywood TV and movie industry is still the same unless you know something I don't. Men control and run damn near everything & have all the power. So what you suggest is not only illogical it's absurd. You're on TV.  Who's your boss? A woman? Take a good look at yourself.
950178195717832705 2018-01-07 01:31:49 UTC <catteadams> @conniewang But he was exposed and they are being named & outed. Ever go up against an industry set up 2 shut U up? Alone? Sorry the process is too slow 4 U, consider how difficult it is to even come forward and say what has happened to you in this male dominated and controlled industry.
950175885780398080 2018-01-07 01:22:39 UTC <catteadams> @RealJamesWoods Surely, you can't mean Scott Baio? Surely not nutter Ted Nugent? Oh yeah. We forget the ones who kiss his ass so conveniently. Don't make me list them all.  I don't want this Twitter day to go to waste.

950174036125888513 2018-01-07 01:15:18 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray According to the most recent cencus and many many other published studies that are easily found on line it is true that among the poor, women R poorer than men & historically have always been so. U.S. poverty rates R consistently higher among women as compared to men: 19662015.

He sounds so whiny, creepy and Insincere in one moment and the next back to cheap tabloid cat calling., to I care & must expose this horror Do pure truth. All will B right.

It has no point to be made in any logical connect the dots way... it sounds very ignorant. I read the article you sent.  She protected herself. YAY! Smart woman. Smelled danger. Got out!

Might be a small one, but there will be no lack of news coverage to fill it up.  & We need to document his buffoonery and shenanigans that our country might never be so dumb, easily lead, and deceived, again..

The better looking U R the more it happens. It affords all kinds of problems. Especially if that's all U've got going. But to be a beautiful woman & brilliant, can B the worst. It's always tricky.

It finally got fair a few years back and I remember her being relieved.  When I was a bartender  in Mich anmd Calif we had to share w/ bus. I felt it was fair. But to hand over tips to the manager? No

946673458276057088 2017-12-29 09:25:15 UTC <catteadams> @peterdaou Peter, whatever makes you feel whole and complete and proud, is how you should identify.

946544490210246656 2017-12-28 00:52:47 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Considering all the fires that are still not out, I'd say it's right here. I was surprised how hot it was today. But then again, not.
946319473526501377 2017-12-28 09:58:38 UTC <catteadams> So one end of the country is completely on fire and they other end is under snow and at sub zero temps not seen before. And climate change is a hoax. Okkkkkkkkkkkkk

946295377732308992 2017-12-28 08:22:54 UTC <catteadams> @GOP @aravosis @hhjuliet001 And Ed Royce.  We've got some loons up north in the state, that need to GO as well.

946292518727041024 2017-12-28 08:11:32 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed Lyndon B. Johnson said, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.  Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." Trump used that to a T to ignite old fears. No facts
946289876999184384 2017-12-28 08:01:02 UTC <catteadams> @JKH2 They cannot fathom ever losing to a black candidate, but guess what? This is what a day of reckoning looks like. And they better get used to it.
946288918860894208 2017-12-27 07:57:14 UTC <catteadams> @JKH2 Most white ppl dont know the SOB.  His kind and his day has ended.  He got the black smack down of life for his trouble. LOL  Let the GOP try to decertify. They will get another one.    God, how I wish I could vote down there!
946271131895345152 2017-12-27 06:46:33 UTC <catteadams> @kylegriffin1 @Dovewoman1 Because it's far too difficult to fathom that black women brought that race to a certain and conclusive Democratic win?

943776232440778752 2017-12-21 09:32:42 UTC <catteadams> @JonLemire  U said, & that was, "perhaps" sexist. See how & just minimized that with your perhaps? How we speak reveals who we R and how we think. Had U been speaking 2 someone who could hear sexism, they'd have explored that.  But, ho hum, you were speaking to Brian Williams.

942661529895178240 2017-12-17 07:43:17 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay You are dead on the money. It is a very sophisticated set of tolerated behaviors/unbridled misogyny/old norms/attitudes/biases.  Add blame/shame of the victim. Old ideas spoken and unspoken that we have allowed to thwart justice and  significant change. We need a revolution!

942336472111136769 2017-12-17 10:11:37 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay It was not the lessons you taught her that failed her. It was the abuse of her innocence, and vulnerability at that moment, perpetrated upon her, by a sick and pathetic predator and criminal that failed her. They are always on the watch. Always waiting 4 their moment. 
942334995191828480 2017-12-17 10:05:45 UTC <catteadams> @EdanClay Oh, so sorry.

942219812276600832 2017-12-16 02:28:03 UTC <catteadams> @krassenstein @MustangZeroFive Boom!
942219435330256896 2017-12-16 02:26:33 UTC <catteadams> @MiraSorvino You're not only an incredible actress, but my hera! So very grateful for your strength of conviction. And so very sorry that you were punished for being an ethical and decent human being. Blessing to you Mira! This will turn around for you. I know it.
942218868101070848 2017-12-16 02:24:18 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Bass gear too. 101 closed. they couldnt get back thru to get it. Really bad up there. Marc had the hotel give him a mask and he made a bee line to the gig. Just loaded up all the gear & got the hell out of there..  He just got out before fwy closed. He's home now.

942169575919034368 2017-12-16 23:08:26 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox NEVER! You are forever hip. We just cough a lot. LOL
942169452052754433 2017-12-16 23:07:56 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Wow. I have my inhaler at the ready. Always. Cough is better this week. Wore my ass out last week. OY. lol Yes. Direct message. Hey Melanie, I have to take my next door neighbor to the store. Be right back.

942161866402361346 2017-12-16 22:37:48 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Marc's gig just got cancelled because of fire. He had to run down to the venue and grab everybody's equipment. Our world is on fire in Calif. Scary times.
942159483177799680 2017-12-16 22:28:19 UTC <catteadams> @JKH2 @CBJOHNSON143 @Wsbluelife @RandyHauser lol And true. Better manners than Trump, but that's not sayin much. Bernie needs to go.
942158467590078465 2017-12-16 22:24:17 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Sure. Everything ok? DM me.
942158118552662016 2017-12-16 22:22:54 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX I know. That's why it's so frustrating.
941968160357416960 2017-12-16 09:48:05 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Marc's gigging in Santa Barbara tonight/tomorrow. What part of the globe is Sal in?
941967866374455296 2017-12-16 09:46:54 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox I'm all about the seasons. LOL If I could I'd put myself in a bunny costume for Easter. I still might.
941965405630763008 2017-12-16 09:37:08 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox I went to the Santa Ana one. It was a glorious day!

941952052858560512 2017-12-16 08:44:04 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Victoria, they just cannot see it. It is a huge blind spot. I feel like a damn preacher anymore. But, I will NOT stop sounding the alarm. Nor will you. So, we press on.  PS....Peace to you this morning, friend. 
941951263184265217 2017-12-16 08:40:56 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox So true. But I have been here before, as you have too. If we need to march until our canes break, and our hips go, that's what we'll do. Looking for the one nearest us. Haven't found it yet. Maybe they will text me.

941895824623124480 2017-12-15 05:00:38 UTC <catteadams> @Rosie @pudgedyfudgedy Get in line. When they're in your family you find yourself plotting the strangest murders, ever.
941895349320351744 2017-12-15 04:58:45 UTC <catteadams> @Rosie Well, this made me happier than you could ever know. I think I might be choking and laughing at the same time.  Oh wait. No worries.  Milk bubble.  Good one, Rosie.

If this person doesn't know how basic supply and demand works, they sure as hell don't have the ability to read this tax bill. I'm thinking this was written by a middle schooler. Nah, they'd be smarter.
941893731011063808 2017-12-15 04:52:19 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid @BullAinsworth Did you have no government classes in school, no business classes? This is so basic. If you were in business for yourself you would know. And you would be bankrupt. My god.

941876383608848384 2017-12-15 03:43:23 UTC <catteadams> @JohnBechard If I dont tell you my hair brained thoughts then who will?  LOL Twitter.  Every day of the year.
941876053156315137 2017-12-15 03:42:04 UTC <catteadams> OMG.  I needed that response this week! It's been a slog uphill week, with this crap.https://twitter.com/AriannaDantone/status/941384367837995009
941875266954993664 2017-12-15 03:38:57 UTC <catteadams> @JohnBechard May I add hair brained to the first sentence? Thank you.
941874486642597888 2017-12-15 03:35:51 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Also hanging out at the DOJ.  Prolly not as fun, eh Donny boy?

DEMS are reckless! EVIL. Must be stopped! And not for nothing but Obamacare created massive jobs in the health care, health science, and ins. industries.  But shhhhhhhhhhhhhh
941868543787745281 2017-12-15 03:12:14 UTC <catteadams> @kurteichenwald LETS TAKE A POLL. How many Trump voters know that?  Oh......crickets...eeep eeeep.  Crickets.

941866913457516544 2017-12-15 03:05:45 UTC <catteadams> @SenGillibrand @Wxgirl169 He was ALL that when he campaigned. What kept you from seeing it then? Did you not believe it? Give him the benefit of the doubt? Think it was fake news? No judgement. Just curious.
941866333037256704 2017-12-15 03:03:27 UTC <catteadams> @Trump_Regrets You get there when you get there. And there is a blindness that abusers create in the abused. True. I hope this woman heals, and finds the path toward naming the thing that almost consumed her clarity of truth. God bless.

941865057465417729 2017-12-15 02:58:23 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid I am so glad you said that. Enough wringing of hands and pearl clutching. There is a civic duty to not be cavalier with a vote for president. It can negatively change the landscape of ppl's lives in ways you cannot even fathom.  "he's talks like me" isnt enuf to govern a nation.
941857713289494528 2017-12-15 02:29:12 UTC <catteadams> @JohnBechard And Danger Mouse.
941857315241672704 2017-12-15 02:27:37 UTC <catteadams> @eilperin @bylenasun @EricTopol Let them drop the word based. Go deeper. There are other words, more graphic, more elaborate. Bury those idiots in those. Many ways to play this game. And it IS a game.  This is still, insanity. This is still, NOT normal.
941855813555052545 2017-12-15 02:21:39 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @azmoderate I wish there was another category. A legitimate choice, that isn't just mean spirited, or goofy, but true.  But I get where you're coming from. We're all baffled by the few who will defend in the face of all evidence to the contrary.
941854962350354432 2017-12-15 02:18:16 UTC <catteadams> @RepMaxineWaters @Green_Footballs Two bags of filth. I hope she takes action of some sort. Don't know what it could be, but this is egregious stalking and an invasion as she was completely vulnerable and unaware of him taking pictures. What a putrid person. As well as Omar Navarro. Disgusting.
941852773242433537 2017-12-15 02:09:34 UTC <catteadams> @JKH2 @CBJOHNSON143 @Wsbluelife He is the definition of white power. He COULD have legislated for equal opportunities for minorities but he DIDNT. He's been there 30 years. NOTHING passed that would help minorities. Not his focus. Or concern. THAT'S white power.

Nobody, and I mean NOBODY wanted to hear about sexual abuse, assault or anything negative about the BOSS. I'm sorry you had that horrific experience, and I wish you peace, Jennifer. Wedo what we can, when we can
941841784790847489 2017-12-15 01:25:54 UTC <catteadams> @scienmag No.
941841214512381953 2017-12-15 01:23:38 UTC <catteadams> @MiraSorvino We all owe you a debt of gratitude. Were it not for you, I couldn't have named my #MeToo abuser, Jermaine Jackson. Thank you. You helped me have the courage.
941840667474456576 2017-12-15 01:21:28 UTC <catteadams> @mattmfm This bag of worms is hiding an even bigger bag of worms.  Like Russian dolls, there's always one more and one more and one more.

941834691161681920 2017-12-15 00:57:43 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan In the words of Archie Bunker: Whoop De ZIP! Say this again and again until you realize we know the dif. between Median and Mean.
941834147579883521 2017-12-15 00:55:33 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Why float a pitiful number like that as if its some kind of game changer? You astonish  me. Even when you're not directly talking down to us, you're talking down to us. And, we KNOW the dif. between median and mean. We've told you this before. You're NOT fooling all of us, dude.
941826566119497728 2017-12-15 00:25:26 UTC <catteadams> @krassenstein While this is sad to even think about, I know you are right. And NOBODY wants that job.

941822170677706752 2017-12-15 00:07:58 UTC <catteadams> @SpikeReeds @Twhs_fandoms @vKawaiix That's the dumbest sentence ever. Thought you were trying to prove how smart you are. Just stop it. This is pointless.
941821455603351552 2017-12-15 00:05:07 UTC <catteadams> @SpikeReeds @Twhs_fandoms @vKawaiix I was not referring to anyone specific either.

941820451864551425 2017-12-15 00:01:08 UTC <catteadams> @IjeomaOluo YES. PLEASE. This is his need to show us he gets it? He doesn't and it shows. Matt honey, just stop already.

There's a long line of ppl who have had the exact same interaction w/ them 2. I haven't seen it otherwise as yet. It is abt wielding power over another. Look at the power dynamic
941817597820936192 2017-12-15 23:49:48 UTC <catteadams> @Aki_me2 @MarkyWallace Yes. Just reverse it shall we? Let's say multiple people were constantly trying to touch you wherever they wanted to touch you Matt? And no matter who you told about it, they brushed it off? Lets say they grabbed your balls, snuck their tongue in your mouth on set? Bad joke?
941814245867454465 2017-12-15 23:36:28 UTC <catteadams> @SopanDeb @Mel_Ankoly @BlueEASM @Jennifblair I am 60 yrs old. I just got harassed by someone in CHURCH a few months ago. I dont even belong to the church. I was a guest artist, singing. It was not processed briefly by me, I'll tell you.  It was not this guy's watershed moment.  He's done this before. You just know it.
941813630110015490 2017-12-15 23:34:02 UTC <catteadams> @SopanDeb @Mel_Ankoly @BlueEASM @Jennifblair I've personally NEVER processed it briefly. Constant sexual harassment is enough to make you sick or quit. I quit. Many jobs. EVERYONE on one of the jobs knew about the harasser, never warned me and when I told, they asked me to LET IT GO, no big deal, he's harmless. Sick of it.
941809027394056193 2017-12-15 23:15:44 UTC <catteadams> You can only beat ppl down for so long. When they rise up, it's with a fury. You need to pay very close attention those in battle that have nothing to lose. They are a fierce warrior.  And unstoppable when finding their own power.

941665011750936577 2017-12-15 13:43:28 UTC <catteadams> @Luvvie I LOVE YOU FOR DOING THIS! This is resistance in action! Bless you for thinking of it.
941664717071773696 2017-12-15 13:42:18 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump Remember when Natalie Cole burned down your bungalow? Now that was a record high! We laughed for years about it! Still laughing. You came off like a total ass. Cuz you played it cheap, as usual. Wish the whole world could have heard you THAT night. You embarrassed yourself.
941662538357338112 2017-12-15 13:33:39 UTC <catteadams> @EdKrassen For all the negative criticism, petty jabs, and disbelief in their expertise and intel, I wouldn't imagine he'll get the warm and fuzzy welcome every other president before him has gotten.   More perfunctory.   There he is. Photo, photo.  There he goes.   #whateve's
941660735645483008 2017-12-15 13:26:29 UTC <catteadams> @oohlittleramona So many have disappoint me lately. Surprised me. Revolted me. And the women have encouraged me to remain strong. There is good inside horrible things. I pray for and end to this nightmare. And a shift culturally, to bring this into the light forever. And change the culture 4 all
941660018780151808 2017-12-15 13:23:38 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo Still look down. Right here in America. It is absolutely astounding how much shame is heaped on the woman. PPL like you and me will change this in our lifetime, I pray.
941659521419636736 2017-12-15 13:21:39 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo And God Bless your son and his momma!
941659170012401665 2017-12-15 13:20:15 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo Yes. Many countries use women as chattel, of no worth. Were that a NO could or would make a difference. We have so far to go in this world as to a woman's worth. And to think, no one on earth would be here without us.

941523714662739970 2017-12-14 04:22:00 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo We need to teach our boys and girls that there WILL be consequences to unwanted sexual misconduct. And the girls need to be believed and action taken on their behalf. That has not been happening since the 50's. Not much It's a watershed moment and I hope we don't lose the lesson
941523000469237761 2017-12-14 04:19:10 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo We've been teaching right from wrong, it's crystal clear. I'm a child of the 50's. Keep your hands to yourself I've been hearing since then. Always some men who brake those rules and think it doesn't apply to them. Usually those w much power & no consequences. Now? Consequences
941520674983616512 2017-12-14 04:09:56 UTC <catteadams> @Scott_Wiener Thank you for protecting us!  Let us know how to help, and let us all keep supporting you!

941516819252224000 2017-12-14 03:54:36 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPostPol @AynRandPaulRyan The reason the saying is "Dumb as two stumps" is because there are two Trump stumps. And they are both dumb as each other.
941516356545011712 2017-12-14 03:52:46 UTC <catteadams> @nykass New narrative.   "Maybe that's who I was. A product of my generation. But I've grown and evolved into a better person. I've changed."  Yeah Dustin. You keep telling yourself that. There are MORE stories about you, out here.  So. Don't. Hold. Your. Breath.
941514654156595200 2017-12-14 03:46:00 UTC <catteadams> @CharlesMBlow @lil_fierce1 @PatriciaRaye Well!  A pox upon you then. LOL I support showers and whatnot. Some PPL's kids, man. I felt pretty judged in Seattle for not conforming. Got the hairy eyeball a lot. PPL like that tend to tsk tsk tsk until you get your behavior in line with theirs. BOORS.
941513626308853760 2017-12-14 03:41:55 UTC <catteadams> @luvnewinfo It's in every field. Hypocrisy rules wherever power is misused. It's in Art, Science, Education, corporations large & small, churches, philanthropic foundations, charities, politics, schools. We have a very sick society. Our culture needs to change. B a shining light.

You gotta know your battles, and know when it's even open for discussion. Small town stuff is brutal. And then you got a crap haircut for three months.  Next haircut? They remember you from last time. LOLOLOL
941505550277214208 2017-12-14 03:09:50 UTC <catteadams> @marscrumbs No. They never stop. They are always trying to take advantage of women. It's about power, not sex.
941505216872046594 2017-12-14 03:08:30 UTC <catteadams> @CharlesMBlow @PatriciaRaye @lil_fierce1 True. Its a choose your battles kind of thing. The PPL I see watching FOX I have no interest in trying to convert. I hear them talking as tho they are watching real news. True things. Not spin. But Fox is all spin.  It's exhausting when they are in your own family too. OY

Try going into the only barbershop to get a haircut and it's on. Dont even ask for them to change the channel. LOL It ain't gonna happen kiddo. And you could get a horrible haircut 2
941500885057683457 2017-12-14 02:51:17 UTC <catteadams> So sick to death of Dustin Hoffman's behavior. He's been doing this for YEARS. Another open secret?  Yes. Harmless prankster as he would love you to believe?  Hardly. Just another gropey bastard. #DustinHoffman
941497086092107777 2017-12-14 02:36:12 UTC <catteadams> @nykass God bless you fro coming forward w your #MeToo story. I stand with you! You have given me courage to tell my stories.  Yes. Unfortunately I have a few.  But I have the strength to encourage others thru them, as you have done for me. Thank you forever!
941487174867750912 2017-12-14 01:56:49 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic I heard that too. The more staggering "thing 2" for me will always be, accused of assaulting 17 women.
941486773569445894 2017-12-14 01:55:13 UTC <catteadams> @stillgray Well darlin, context is everything.  Answering for a friend.
941485904719372288 2017-12-14 01:51:46 UTC <catteadams> My sincerest condolences to the family and friends of firefighter Cory Iverson.

941266441268895744 2017-12-14 11:19:42 UTC <catteadams> @ScribeUndead One problem. Jokes are supposed to be funny. So if they are not, ppl don't get that they are jokes at all.. Best you go work on your material then, Hobbs.
941263396346806272 2017-12-14 11:07:36 UTC <catteadams> @ScribeUndead Making jokes about how women got sexually assaulted by Morgan Spurlock and how that news isn't important to you, no real shock or outrage at what he's done to them. But your take away is you're mad cuz you never got to eat fast food because of him. U whine but we got raped/abused
941260834268839936 2017-12-14 10:57:25 UTC <catteadams> #CNN You gonna air this creeps show? He admits to more than most. But it's so self serving. & did he even bother to get permission from the women he names in his story before telling it? Time to check yourself. You might have wrecked yourself.

Cuz, I smell a rat. When someone says a "history of" that's some long term admission of creepy bad acts. This is not a come to jesus moment, and I aint yer choir.

941249666255020032 2017-12-14 10:13:02 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Perhps this man needed more than 280 char. to fully express what he meant. Cuz this comment is a huge disconnect. Who is trying to make men feel ashamed of enjoying sex? I see is women tryin to to get men to stop taking advantage, abusing & using their power to harm us sexually

941225585656832000 2017-12-14 08:37:21 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Wow. Tom. You continue to be a man of intrigue. And you also seem to know where all the bones are hidden. But you wouldn't say it if it weren't true. Which makes the Al Franken story all the more heartbreaking.  Damn, man. And PPL think showbiz is ugly?

It makes all the hypocrisy comes blasting forward and you have 2 C it It's arresting 2 C how 1 can justify ANYTHING to keep the tribe myth's alive.
941176380825387008 2017-12-13 05:21:50 UTC <catteadams> @matthewjdowd @estarianne You're not wrong. And according to the bible, the wife must submit to the husband. The husband is all knowing all powerful and wise. Sheeeeya...rightttt. Basically the wife has no power.

So, your facts are just wrong. And not fer nuthin, but to compare one abuse as being worse than another when it all involves abuse of WOMEN is unconscionable.

THAT is always a factor. You say you been hit on by gay men and it was more aggressive. I believe you. I have had the same thing. Gay men who think, Oh I'm no threat to her so I can do this...and this
941166647406092288 2017-12-13 04:43:09 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost Very valuable info. Better to be prepared than not. It could make the difference between life and death, in your hands. I'll do it.
941165046012395521 2017-12-13 04:36:47 UTC <catteadams> @David_Feldman_ How can you have such balls to wear white and take an at bat, and yet, no visible sign of balls whatsoever? Quandry.
941164630209994752 2017-12-13 04:35:08 UTC <catteadams> @David_Feldman_ A spit take when you are holding a plum and pomegranate martini is just not funny. To anyone. That's what the guy next to me at the bar just said to me.  I blamed you. Didn't buy it. Showed him the pic. He's now cleaning up his craft beer.

I'd love to save it but I don't know how. It's iPhone 6.  I Googled of course. Can't seem to find anything that can save it to somewhere else. Anyone know how to do it?
940831482565799936 2017-12-12 06:31:19 UTC <catteadams> I appreciate the fact that the media didn't get cocky and predict this winner ahead of time and call it with confidence far too soon. And in the lead up talk about a poll winner and obvious winner way before the vote. YAY. Restraint.

940731185147162624 2017-12-12 23:52:47 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold God that is the BEST analogy, Tom.  I felt this but could not articulate it. That is EXACTLY the behavior. It's obvious and feels like a runaway snowball rolling down hill. Unstoppable until it crashes into smithereens at the certain and inevitable bottom.
940704171027611649 2017-12-12 22:05:26 UTC <catteadams> @wkamaubell This ASH SHAEFFER  tweet is incomprehensibly dumb and crass and ignorant. It went there because the writer is also those things. Some PPL's kids, man.
940701590897307648 2017-12-12 21:55:11 UTC <catteadams> @AP @RepGwenMoore All I can say is, how pathetic and sad. What kind of person does that? Some 1 of low moral character.  So the old, birds of a feather....stays true as ever.  Press on, do good. And never let up. Let it feed your strength and resolve to defeat these reprobates.
940695897872072704 2017-12-12 21:32:33 UTC <catteadams> REtweet and report as many time as as you can. This is disgusting and Twitter needs to suspend this account.https://twitter.com/PalmerReport/status/940693185537413126

940520466229354496 2017-12-12 09:55:27 UTC <catteadams> @WI_Resistance Unfathomable. But it will happen too slowly and they won't connect the dots. They will blame something else. But WE WONT.

940509771764965376 2017-12-12 09:12:58 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold Once again, had to go away, evac my Mommala from Oceanside, do some gigs, and now I come back and it's Roy Moore and children in Vietnam? Christ almighty. I'm gonna have to put my notifications on notification.
940509078010306562 2017-12-12 09:10:12 UTC <catteadams> @tptvox Me tooooooooooooooooooooooo. Da Mommala is making me go crazy. She goes home tomorrow. Girlllllll you don't even KNOW.  But I also admire the sheer force of will and pluck.  On a level.  Like a scientist looking in a petri dish.

939758139263422464 2017-12-09 07:26:14 UTC <catteadams> Yeah. This could be a stigmata. Or, it could be that I pinched myself too hard. Cause my mother in law is here, and WILL NOT shut up.
939741857680048129 2017-12-09 06:21:33 UTC <catteadams> Ed Royce voting for no tax deductions as a result of a fire takeing your house away, is unconscionable. Time for you to go dude. PPL have lost everything. That they cannot deduct their losses? What do they have left?

If you are still asking, you haven't done even a little investigation. I dont say this in any kind of hateful way, just matter of fact. You will come away more informed about the difficulty in reporting.

Because it's time to start teaching our little boys and girls a new kind of culture. And SHUT this shit DOWN.
938162967044014080 2017-12-05 21:47:36 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold @br0k3nHalo But that doesn't take into account grooming. Young minds are not only impressionable but can be easily convinced that it's ok...positive coercion. That's the truly sickening part. Well, it's all sickening really.
938162313562951680 2017-12-05 21:45:00 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold And thankfully we have evolved a bit from the 50's, as ya do. 14 years old is a still a child in the USA.  Thank God.

I have watched this film many times and showed it to my husband, a jazz pianist. He did know who he was, but not his body of work. He loved the film too!

How dare ppl spend every damn dime feeding their families, paying 4 kids in school, car notes, mortgages ON TIME, carry ins. on everything, provide elder care 4 aging parents, donate time to 2 working @ local food bank, billions of good PPL things God forbid 1 health crisis
937443193871671297 2017-12-03 22:07:28 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Franklin_Graham But you see, you need to walk your faith, not just say the words you know Christians want to hear. Look @ DT's behavior, he fails miserably as a Christian. U need 2 really take a look @ that. U dont serve yourself defending his behavior & it's not a good look 4 real Christians.

We called, texted, emailed, sent postcards, and were relentless in trying to get them to hear us.  They were completely indifferent to us and remain the same.

937167295624777728 2017-12-02 03:51:09 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Attorney to client:  rule #1: DON'T SAY ANYTHING.  Ergo: Trump wrote that tweet.   No attorney worth their salt would have written that tweet and break their own cardinal rule in such a reckless and haphazard way. That attorney is no fool.
937163185827692545 2017-12-02 03:34:49 UTC <catteadams> I felt the same way. Then i kicked up my heels and said NO! I'm not gonna fade.  I also had my first coke a cola in 10 years. They bent me. They did not break me.  Anytime U wanna share a coke and a smile, I'll be here.

937122169695244288 2017-12-02 00:51:50 UTC <catteadams> @JKH2 This is about one thing. His opponent is pro choice. They have chosen an accused pedophile because they can't abide a "certain" baby killer. That's how they see it, sadly.
937120636584976384 2017-12-02 00:45:45 UTC <catteadams> @monicaisliberal Just did it last night with my hubster of 27 years. A little old fashioned snog or two is good for the heart. And a snuggle in a booth is still good fun.

936866884682575873 2017-12-01 07:57:26 UTC <catteadams> @SenJohnMcCain @TomArnold Right. My cousin Brad died of agent orange. No one wanted to hear. They denied it for years. Damn near decades.  The VA has been underfunded forever, & our men/women coming back with PTSD are going 2 suffer greatly now. Just ask vets & active duty ppl. They know. #Unconscionable

936484217063538694 2017-11-30 06:36:51 UTC <catteadams> @PattyArquette Doug Jones is pro choice. Case closed. To try 2 appeal to someones decency regarding sexual abuse when they see the other candidate, as a baby killer is futile. They WILL vote for Moore. It's a one issue deal to them. I hope this will change one day. :(

936453272033837056 2017-11-30 04:33:53 UTC <catteadams> @owillis It started before that tho....but they doubled down after Obama. They had ppl in place for years.

I'd love to know also if that is based on them believing the corp donors or the ppl. Cuz I don't hear regular ppl saying, YAY!  More taxes for the little guy and more $$ for the rich!
936446770338344962 2017-11-30 04:08:03 UTC <catteadams> This includes some family members, so, hang in there fam. You can fool some of the ppl some of the time, and Trump voters all of the time.

936096739546861568 2017-11-29 04:57:09 UTC <catteadams> @mmpadellan He says hurricane effects as tho it was something that didn't involve PPL. PPL who STILL dont have clean drinking water or power. Language is everything.
936096095234547712 2017-11-29 04:54:35 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Thank you Victoria. You see, when you can't imagine what it is to be harassed and/or assaulted, and have 2 deal with that potential abuse every damn day, you can make jokes like this and think it's funny. It will NEVER be funny. And I'm NOT going to lighten up. Pls buy a clue PPL
936095433914400768 2017-11-29 04:51:57 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold That tweet right there just scared the bejeesus out of some of those employees. I delight in that, more than just a little.
936094393894711296 2017-11-29 04:47:49 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @leemwilliams You are absolutely right. Heh's is repugnant. And doesn't have leadership skills at all. He proves himself to be so ignorant on every level. But the agenda is the most worrisome thing.
936094050431594496 2017-11-29 04:46:28 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @leemwilliams Boy that's not how I am hearing it. They have pulled apart his behavior, his lack of knowledge, his ineptitude on every level foreign and domestic, and his agenda. I don't listen to reg. CBS, NBC, ABC tho. So you may have a different viewpoint based on more news sources.
936085949582163973 2017-11-29 04:14:16 UTC <catteadams> @mattmfm I know HE doesn't know what's in the tax bill, but I was counting on news media to tell me what is in it except 4 the same three talking points over and over again, ad nauseum. I have read, or tried to read many bills over time. They R daunting. Come on news ppl! Help a girl out!
936083816766046208 2017-11-29 04:05:48 UTC <catteadams> They have every comment I have ever said on TWTR.  AND my exact address listed. This is equally disturbing. In fact, more disturbing.https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/935940583885074432
936080883991298048 2017-11-29 03:54:08 UTC <catteadams> Yup.  Different standards for select ppl. That account should have been gone long ago.https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/935912154510872577
936080407925157891 2017-11-29 03:52:15 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @leemwilliams Is MSNBC or CNN considered MSM? Because they most certainly have been calling out Trumps BS. Every day. Sometimes it feels relentless. Like there's no other news. But in this Trump day to day disaster reality, there kind of isn't any other news more important.
936040345564880896 2017-11-29 01:13:03 UTC <catteadams> Well I hope the right ppl vote thumbs down, and stop this madness. Are there any regular ppl who want it?https://twitter.com/SenBobCasey/status/936034359211151361

I fear elevators when I am alone. I fear any work area when I am alone. Because a man can & has changed an innocent work area into a place 2 B feared. Over & over again
936031668963483649 2017-11-29 00:38:35 UTC <catteadams> Worth retweeting.  This happens/has happened all the time. Chime in men, what if this happened to you anytime a man felt like doing that to you? And when you finally have the nerve to tell someone they tell You to modify Your behavior.

The streets are so narrow that they side mirrors get broken off every day. No one even bothers to stop. Then there's the constant pot smokers in the cars. But they're usually going too slow. LOL

LOL Merging doesn't affect the speed of traffic or flow. What stops the flow of traffic is jumping in & out of lanes trying to edge forward.

934546168167653376 2017-11-25 22:15:44 UTC <catteadams> @cher The true problem is they don't give a rats about the constituents. They only care to please their big donors. The rich and the super rich.  So we the ppl NEVER count. We're not big donors. We must VOTE them out.

933495651194699776 2017-11-22 00:41:21 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed Ungrateful is a word whites use to make black ppl feel that they are not justified in any complaint, in any circumstance. It's used to demean, and pull focus off of the real issues, and to refocus it instead on how blacks should stay in their place. I.E. it's an old racist tactic

932843284707229696 2017-11-20 05:29:05 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz I like that. My daughter is a film/ TV/ costume designer so I watch over and over to see the costumes, the background shots, the dolly & tracking shots, set designs.  Details are so fun to watch.  & all the hidden stuff on first glance, is really fun to see at two or three views.

Sexual harassment is repeated, overt physical advances, that are not only rebuked and unwanted but escalate to more than acceptable behavior at a job. Good lord

932824982773678082 2017-11-20 04:16:21 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed @secondgunn74 There's no "end" to endemic, systemic racism. Reparations will not end a system of injustice. We have to dismantle the systems that keep white supremacy in place, its laws, politics, and sick systems that keep racism and white supremacy in place and thriving. U a bot or wht?
932819605587767296 2017-11-20 03:54:59 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed Her words were, what about hard work? Not, black ppl don't work hard. I know the inference was in there, but I wanted you on longer. You were ROCKIN! I wish you had more time to suss that out. I so resent her smug "gotcha" tone and "you're done" style. Damn..
932816625400651777 2017-11-20 03:43:09 UTC <catteadams> @tariqnasheed I'm so THERE

I'm just going by what has happened to me, and what I experience. When someone asks me out, and there's no chemistry there, and it's a no...oh well...no biggie. I dont feel harassed. Dont care where it happens.
932769848366526465 2017-11-20 00:37:16 UTC <catteadams> @JJohnsonLaw Oh. My. God. This made me sick. Thank God this father was on top of this with his conversations and openness.  It could have easily escalated and fast. That man was grooming these young children.

932761685894381568 2017-11-20 00:04:50 UTC <catteadams> "Charlie Rose" I go to work and don't check in for a few days and Charlie Rose pops up in the trend when I come back. I am so plucked. This is absolutely disgusting and the list grows. I mean what the holy hell fuckery business is going on? I'm so sick of this. #MeToo
932760598336507904 2017-11-20 00:00:31 UTC <catteadams> @battymamzelle @freeblackgirl @risingdemise @skankhunter__42 Small correction. Flirting is not the same thing as sexual harassment not technically nor otherwise. I'm guessing if you were a woman, you would keenly know the difference. U need to have some clearer ideas of what the dif. is and get that straight first. But I'm all for love.
932560515414368259 2017-11-20 10:45:27 UTC <catteadams> @battymamzelle @freeblackgirl @risingdemise @skankhunter__42 So say you. There are always those willing to cross over that line. BUT, Would you, if you saw that go down, crossing over the line, stand up for the woman and say, hey that's out of line? Could be risking your job too.

Regardless of their age, while in school, they are children. It's not for us to bring them into the adult world sexually cuz, they are kids. No matter their curiosity. NO. Answer is always no.
931770391697137664 2017-11-17 06:25:47 UTC <catteadams> @RheaButcher Can I have your number? My friends don't answer.

I once told my mom I wanted to hitchhike across America from Mich. to Calif. Well just how R you gonna do that? Oh I'll just sleep on the side of the road. In mom words, my mom told me to fuck off. LOL

931768083659726848 2017-11-17 06:16:37 UTC <catteadams> @battymamzelle @freeblackgirl @risingdemise Well said. We can't go half way. The box is open, everything needs to come out. Then we can maybe be honest about what to do about it. But now is the time for real clarity. Not more murky water.
931767590812237824 2017-11-17 06:14:39 UTC <catteadams> @freeblackgirl Her comment is a mess. And that's all there is to it. And remember this gem?https://arcdigital.media/lena-dunham-faux-survivor-b72f0f28dca6

931762177215623168 2017-11-17 05:53:09 UTC <catteadams> @danilittlewish Heartbreaking loss. I am so sorry. To know they are out of pain is a small comfort, and yet it gives relief too. When our kids hurt, we hurt. To have that hurt end is a gift, but to lose them is a tragedy. Rest in peace little one.
931760218593042432 2017-11-17 05:45:22 UTC <catteadams> @SarahEMcBride @starboard_light @HYL_Mickey_M Not a lie. Historically, it's been men who do the assaulting. But you aren't wrong about women and the rise of teachers abusing children. Now go be nice to someone. As for stupid logic, your last statement is brilliantly so. Gave me a great laugh.
931759575707009024 2017-11-17 05:42:48 UTC <catteadams> @SarahEMcBride @starboard_light @internettufguy I wouldn't ignore any sexual assault, Tim. All sexual assault is wrong & does great harm to the child. The numbers of women teachers assaulting students has risen. True. I was speaking in a more general way. Historically, but yes, the times the are a changing.
931758555987771393 2017-11-17 05:38:45 UTC <catteadams> @SarahEMcBride @starboard_light @internettufguy @EdwinWeymouth There are newer studies too. I agree it is on the rise. And it needs to be addressed. It is a double standard to not have a rigorous standard applied to all teachers. I'm 100% with you on this.
931755670520524800 2017-11-17 05:27:17 UTC <catteadams> @SarahEMcBride @starboard_light @internettufguy @EdwinWeymouth I don't disagree with numbers and facts, but if it comes down to numbers, men win hands down. Throughout all history. Our society is sick and it's growing sicker every day. We have a huge problem that needs to be addressed. This is only the beginning.

931378525260562432 2017-11-16 04:28:39 UTC <catteadams> @SarahEMcBride @starboard_light There would be ZERO sexual assault were it not 4 men in power. It's simple math. Who does the sexual assaulting? MEN. That it has to be explained to anyone at this point, is the problem. The corner is being turned. We R in a unique point in history. The whole culture is changing
931357203306504192 2017-11-16 03:03:55 UTC <catteadams> @aldotcom @Mompreneur_of_3 @kylegriffin1 @AionHoochi To answer the why now, Q it's quite simple. The culture has changed in a very fast manner. A year ago this story could.n't be told. As for them being paid, do you have proof? Cuz I don't know for sure what they get out of it, except relief.
931277867710689281 2017-11-16 21:48:40 UTC <catteadams> @JJohnsonLaw Yes. We. Did. Our ppl have been through hell and back JUST TRYING to keep clean water. You would think they would understand that. But they dont. Those who want the $$$ would sell us, trick us off the land, if they could.
931277263391174656 2017-11-16 21:46:16 UTC <catteadams> @RepMarciaFudge I can't believe all the phone calling, texting, petitions, emails, and more calling did nothing to change the minds of those least affected by this bill. Truly, they dont give a damn about any of us.  They TAKE what they want. And we suffer.

And I saw the guy downtown recently, and it all came back. I am 62 years old and I started running like a kid in trouble. Nearly killed my neighbor who was with me. That was pure instinct.  I'd like to be rid if this awfulness.

I ask because I have someone to expose. World Famous. Could def. get sued. Dont know what to do. It's from 1989. Still traumatized from it. Anyone have any advice?

PPL who sexually assault usually do it to more than one person. Imbalance of power and the thrill they get from overpowering a person is real. It's not misplaced anger about other issues.

Quite a unique psychology of who does it and why. I dont know this case you speak of at all so I can't say anything definitively one way or the other.https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/

929433364913733632 2017-11-11 19:39:16 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis It is less likely to be reported. It's ingrained in our culture 2 not bring the black man down. We get it from cradle 2 grave. & it's a system set up 2 not support black women TO report by having less WOC in the field 2 report 2. It's a lot of complex things. Not just 1
929431939311812608 2017-11-11 19:33:36 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne THAT is without doubt. Hey my friend, you're a seriously thoughtful and smart woman. I learned so much from your thread.

The mom is good enough 2 ask because it's what U want &  u know they R vulnerable 2 say yes? These guys R smart. they choose their victims based on opportunity 2 groom child & parent, no?

That WAS the point. It has weight & bearing. U said "we leave the b.s. behind us an in the hood" that is not true. Sexual assault is hidden, covered up, by a machine of complicit silence
929402176555728896 2017-11-11 17:35:21 UTC <catteadams> @4everNeverTrump Pe, Please dont suggest repugnant things like this. 4 a child 2B raped is an abhorrent thing.

929157485939736578 2017-11-10 01:23:02 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis WAIT. That's only the few YOU know of. I have so many more I culd tell you about. Lets not talk about who does it more, ok? The point is, it's rampant and it has been going on forever, it HAS to stop!
929156713487392768 2017-11-10 01:19:58 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis That is not to say I haven't been assaulted by white men, just not to that degree. But in the world of music/entertainment, it has happened so many times I have lost count. If U knew me, U would know I have a permanent NOT AVAILABLE way of moving thru the world. Happened anyway
929155893664522240 2017-11-10 01:16:42 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis In a predominantly white power structure it will always be white men. As for white women being complicit, there are less situations like the Weinstein case tho it happens enough, without question. In my world, it was a black man who assaulted me. He had all the power. I had none.
929154985606000640 2017-11-10 01:13:06 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis Native women, women of color/ALWAYS highest at risk. It would astound you. Eighty percent of the reported sexual violence against Native women is committed by white men Bcuz, with very few exceptions, they cannot be tried in tribal courts.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bnpb73/native-american-women-are-rape-targets-because-of-a-legislative-loophole-511

929096986376118273 2017-11-10 21:22:37 UTC <catteadams> @jeremynewberger Whooooof. Bring that bad boy to the forefront, Jeremy. Call it out. Make it real. Flip it, reframe it.  Whatever we have to do to wake ppl up. Well stated.
929096343389270016 2017-11-10 21:20:04 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic Some ppl really dont understand that in many cases the age difference imbalance of power makes it impossible to GIVE consent.  Asking questions like, WHY DIDNT THEY JUST LEAVE? OMG. But we are slowly waking up as a culture and nation. And that can only be good.
929095662884478976 2017-11-10 21:17:22 UTC <catteadams> @krassenstein We've been hearing whispers of that for a year. Thank YOU Mueller! This guy is as dirty as my old laundry.

929094038971498496 2017-11-10 21:10:55 UTC <catteadams> @pbump HAHAHAHA I really laughed about this post. Those old Ruskie's are at it again. GAVNO!
929093532190511104 2017-11-10 21:08:54 UTC <catteadams> @fejimanz I'll fed-X you my cane. It's a doozie. Cuz, the ground is a biting bitch with dirt on it's face.

929091309482098688 2017-11-10 21:00:04 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes You dont have to be a victim 40 years later but that doesn't mean you weren't victimized. See how that works? That's called facts, and the truth. OK Ala. GOP?
929090171781267457 2017-11-10 20:55:33 UTC <catteadams> 4 rape allegations. My god. You can choose to hurt us, break us, but you sure as hell don't get to choose the consequences.https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/danny-masterson-rape-allegations
929088061346013184 2017-11-10 20:47:10 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan YES GIRL! YESSSSSSSSSS! #staystrong #MeToo
929087855594430464 2017-11-10 20:46:21 UTC <catteadams> @caleb_blog Older guys do. They really do. If all she ever see's is your smile U haven't been honest with her. That would mean taking a large emotional risk. Sometimes that's just not possible. Because she is the wrong girl.  It's a life signal. The older you get, the faster U hear it
929087005572526080 2017-11-10 20:42:58 UTC <catteadams> @caleb_blog But if a boy feels that way about a specific girl, and she treats him this way, he deserves better.  Much better. It's just hard truth.  One day, the right one comes along and you look back and say, wow, what the heck did I see in her anyway? Promise.
929086244784500742 2017-11-10 20:39:57 UTC <catteadams> @caleb_blog  Caleb, you are quite an artist! Well done, son. I loved your work up on Insta
929074310387449856 2017-11-10 19:52:31 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle I had not heard that. Woof...that's disturbing. And so was that misogynistic show.
929071261996613632 2017-11-10 19:40:24 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle It can be read in a few different ways, perhaps that's why. But apologists? Hit the road. There's a new girl in town! And she has backup.
929070654711664640 2017-11-10 19:38:00 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle So we're not doing Jan Wernner, it's what he did to others. Allegedly.
929070165723004928 2017-11-10 19:36:03 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle A little sarcasm....The story is awful. I hope everyone who has hurt others in this way gets their just deserts. No one deserves to be treated this way. And it's GOT to stop.
929069490234580992 2017-11-10 19:33:22 UTC <catteadams> @EllenPage BRAVA! I stand with you Ellen! You are not alone. 
929068015441682432 2017-11-10 19:27:30 UTC <catteadams> @JonRiley7 Yeah, lets go back thousands of years in history just to say, see? IT'S OK! My god. Have they lost their damn minds? Would they apply that logic if it was their 14 year old CHILD? Sad to think.
929067300363288576 2017-11-10 19:24:40 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle Just what it says.
929065360506044416 2017-11-10 19:16:57 UTC <catteadams> @trollabelle More like, what did Jan Werner do to others? Allegedly.
929064214810976256 2017-11-10 19:12:24 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @Dog4Zebra More like THEY said and then he responded at this point tho.
929064038859882496 2017-11-10 19:11:42 UTC <catteadams> yup. Unless you've been there. https://twitter.com/Dog4Zebra/status/929058457810034688
929063775403065344 2017-11-10 19:10:39 UTC <catteadams> @FoxNews @Variety @bulgar72 @beingmrdavis THE DYNAMIC IS MONEY, DOMINANCE, AND UNEQUAL POWER, NOT COLOR. Power being the main thing, control, dominance there you have it. Oh and being a man who will abuse those things to satisfy himself and ignore the harm to others.. That's about it.

929054362416029697 2017-11-10 18:33:15 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @ShecutIrving More like every week a new man and his predatory behavior is exposed. They chose to take advantage, and abuse power and dominance in a situation with an unsuspecting victim. THEY chose.
929053719211077632 2017-11-10 18:30:42 UTC <catteadams> @Variety @Dog4Zebra Dont you just  love it when ppl say we over react? And it's about dominance and an imbalance of POWER. We dont know the details of that audition.
929052323917176832 2017-11-10 18:25:09 UTC <catteadams> @Variety Proud of all of these women!
929051658906091520 2017-11-10 18:22:31 UTC <catteadams> @jules_su So right Jules. Painful for all, but necessary.
929051275081089025 2017-11-10 18:20:59 UTC <catteadams> @Gawker @nytimes @OptionalLemon @mrscnonah One story is earlier than the other. Perhaps they got better information after the claimants were willing to come forward. I can see how both things could happen. But yes the details are different.
929049093501882368 2017-11-10 18:12:19 UTC <catteadams> @Gawker @nytimes @OptionalLemon @mrscnonah It's both. If it had happened to you perhaps you would have a more nuanced view of what happens to the victim. Lots of articles out there about sexual harassment that explain the dynamic. As it has happened multiple times to me, I understood immediately what happened.
929048156758712320 2017-11-10 18:08:36 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus If U knew the ppl and the common practices here, U would. It's not uncommon for a powerful agent that U need to get work to also represent other high end clients. In no uncertain terms the victim is told 2 back off or else. I recognized the pattern. More will come out on this.
928976400513581056 2017-11-10 13:23:28 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus Those last three posts of mine are from this article...http://defamer.gawker.com/louis-c-k-will-call-you-up-to-talk-about-his-alleged-s-1687820755
928976222767366145 2017-11-10 13:22:45 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus (3)  But the comedian  stood in front of the door, blocking their way  with his body, until he  was done.
928976161522180096 2017-11-10 13:22:31 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus (2) Thinking he was joking (thats exactly  the kind of thing this guy  would say), the women gave a facetious  thumbs up. He wasnt joking.  When he actually started jerking off in  front of them, the ladies  decided that wasnt their bag and made for the  exit.
928976023500218368 2017-11-10 13:21:58 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus (1) At the Aspen Comedy Festival a few years ago, he invited a female comedy duo back to his hotel room. The two ladies gladly joined  him, and offered him some weed. He turned it down, but asked if it would  be OK if he took his dick out.
928975442882715649 2017-11-10 13:19:39 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus NYT article in a lower paragraph that heads apologies w/ troubling Implications. ...read that. Same article talks about the threats from the agency/agent. Mr. Becky.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/television/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur
928972830246449152 2017-11-10 13:09:16 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus These are two different articles...I must have mixed them up in my head. Which said what. Sorry about that...let me get the right ones to you. The agent threatened the two female comedians. And CK did call to apologize..give me a sec.
928957293856567296 2017-11-10 12:07:32 UTC <catteadams> @SamGrittner @LiviaLove You nailed it. It's not the act, it's the dominance over a woman that gets their rocks off. It's always about power. The rest is just the means by which they exert it.
928956705206968326 2017-11-10 12:05:12 UTC <catteadams> @SamGrittner And yes. EFF him.
928956623434891264 2017-11-10 12:04:52 UTC <catteadams> @SamGrittner No. It wasn't enough. That's not what he gets off on. And, I really dont think it's about him escaping himself.  It's about the thrill he gets by committing this crime, and having, and exerting power over women. That's his jones. It's always about POWER. Not a peccadillo.
928955351151534085 2017-11-10 11:59:49 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus it was the agent who threatened them. Why would he need to do that if there was no there there? He wouldn't. And then, Louis CK called trying to apologize for what he did so, he admitted it. That's proof, right? http://defamer.gawker.com/louis-c-k-will-call-you-up-to-talk-about-his-alleged-s-1687820755

928953668816093185 2017-11-10 11:53:08 UTC <catteadams> @vinylchica @xxdr_zombiexx Well said. Indeed. I had to learn what my physical boundaries were in my 30's as I was molested from the age of 3. By the time I was 30 I had no body boundaries. After years of therapy and work, I have some big ol boundaries now, boy! Thank you for your good works!
928952551478673408 2017-11-10 11:48:42 UTC <catteadams> @vinylchica I give you a lot of credit. You are helping us who have been thru hell and back a chance at breathing a safe breath again. And helping us release trauma so it has no power over us anymore. Thank God for therapists like you. It can't be an easy job, but it must be very fulfilling.
928951749527793664 2017-11-10 11:45:30 UTC <catteadams> @bobedgar208 And Bill O'Rielly, cuz he's back in FOX town.

928949089110130688 2017-11-10 11:34:56 UTC <catteadams> Louis C.K. Ok. Not my brand of humor. Little to cynical for me. But I swear I did not see that one coming. Stay strong ladies! Fight on! I'm with you, all the way!
928948285724749825 2017-11-10 11:31:44 UTC <catteadams> @JonRiley7 @xenopoesis3 Have you read up on domestic violence? Perhaps you should. If it was so easy to leave they would.  The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after a victim  leaves. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the  victim has gotten out. Not so easy to hide.
928947321764691971 2017-11-10 11:27:55 UTC <catteadams> @JonRiley7 Amen to that.  And they can choose to not let their partner know and instruct the medical facility to NOT NOTIFY spouse. That is the ultimate in protection,
928946726085451776 2017-11-10 11:25:33 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @Nurjehan8 God's laws didn't expose them. It was brave women. Who took huge personal risks and lost out financially by coming forward. Women. Incredibly brave women. But I hear you.
928946026676764672 2017-11-10 11:22:46 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @DaveyGraus Maybe they will, but the backlash is also pretty great. There are tons of ppl who will never be hired again. This biz is dominated by powerful men. And they can be pretty vicious when you're threatening their main meal ticket.
928945368477208576 2017-11-10 11:20:09 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @JohnnyVHBB Because it's the imbalance of power that sexually charges them, not the act. It's the fear, the anxiety, the high stakes. A prostitute is there FOR you. You can sneak up on them, they know why they are there. ERgo...the thrill is gone.
928944489682452480 2017-11-10 11:16:39 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @OptionalLemon It's sounds like you're blaming them, tho. What did they do? They thought he was joking. It went from a joke to OMG in a flash. Maybe U don't understand the power difference. Pls read more about the subject. You will be enlightened to say the least. 
928943266845696000 2017-11-10 11:11:48 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @OptionalLemon Read up more. It happens 2 us all the time, in compromising ways. He was blocking the door.  U get trapped. U don't know what 2 do. U're in shock. I suppose they could have punched him in the balls. Still, he had all the power inside or outside of the room. And that makes a dif
928941274198978560 2017-11-10 11:03:53 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @Kelly2Teresa REread the article again. It's about power. It is always and foremost about power. That's how ppl know this for years. They get threatened or coerced to keep and stay silent. The woman getting the blame and being forced to B silent has been the pattern and practice for too long.
928940345500372992 2017-11-10 11:00:11 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @KomputerKoder BTW, it's a co-worker, OK?  Reverse the roles. Got a funny line all ready? Of course not. Because you shouldn't have to put up with this bullshit, EVER.
928939542169579520 2017-11-10 10:57:00 UTC <catteadams> @nytimes @KomputerKoder We've been laughing and deflecting forever.  It was never funny.

928578679453577216 2017-11-09 11:03:03 UTC <catteadams> @JamesMartinSJ Beautifully stated.  And those who dont believe in God at all, are also good and moral ppl with infinite dignity and beauty, and should also be reverenced as a beautiful creations.
928577106316890113 2017-11-09 10:56:48 UTC <catteadams> True, but how long have we known this? We've tried and tried to pass campaign reform bills. They go down in defeat every time. Gee. Wonder why?https://twitter.com/SafetyPinDaily/status/928570363088424960
928576621837041664 2017-11-09 10:54:53 UTC <catteadams> @truth_balloon Me tooooooooooo! They've had their fun. It's our turn. Tick tock, yor time is up.
928574971256881152 2017-11-09 10:48:19 UTC <catteadams> @mundanematt @x_matter @VastoLorde_x You'd be surprised how many ppl have said this exact thing today.  Not satirically. Not ironically. Just weirdly weird. But if I was wrong about his twt, I apologize.
928574166386622469 2017-11-09 10:45:07 UTC <catteadams> @TempletonCath Your video is super creepy. I don't know who you are but you're party is crumbling because they embraced a racist. We are known by the company we keep, toots. By all means, dont keep quiet.  The GOP was so "winning" yesterday. I want to see more of that.
928523352020361216 2017-11-08 07:23:12 UTC <catteadams> @AddictNews1 I cannot see how a list like this is helpful.  Nor even accurate. Surely you can do better.

928512744537518081 2017-11-08 06:41:03 UTC <catteadams> @perlmutations Just a failed Hollywood writer looking for a little attention and validation. Not able to earn it in Hlwd. he tried the "next" show business.  Politics.  No smarter there.

928477813128040448 2017-11-08 04:22:15 UTC <catteadams> @NancySinatra It is interesting tho, they are suffering the same kind of ridicule, scorn and derision that we, the rape victims, have suffered for Decades. We were not believed. Now THEY are not believed.  Ironic, no?

928469835675090944 2017-11-08 03:50:33 UTC <catteadams> @Brasilmagic Yes. And YES. And YES. And YES. They get a thrill from our fear and they get sexually charged from that. It's a pleasure response that gets mind mapped over and over and over again. Like a bad habit. Except much worse because they destroy ppls lives w/ impunity.
928468588683390976 2017-11-08 03:45:36 UTC <catteadams> @krassenstein There's a third option.  They are lying.   lol  We know they are good at that.

928456045202046976 2017-11-08 02:55:45 UTC <catteadams> @mundanematt Oh really? You say that NOW. But you know where's "its" going right? That would be rape. Oh, by the way, the rapist decides when you've had enough. And what they'll use. Still want it?

928417112883785728 2017-11-08 00:21:03 UTC <catteadams> @nowthisnews @ThaArchitect Good parenting.  I was pointing out the trap in the question. Serial harassers/abusers also have had good parents who taught them well.  But @ a certain point they made reckless choices, liked the power in it & got off on it sexually Hopefully, will have to pay 4 that, now

928403456750002176 2017-11-08 23:26:47 UTC <catteadams> @nowthisnews @ThaArchitect @whiskeyismyjam Not exactly. Most of the sexual harassment claims are by multiple victims about 1 person. Thats unique I think. And knowing what it takes to come forward, its usually the victim who gets ruined. This seems to me, this is 1st time the victim has had any power at all.
928400986896449536 2017-11-08 23:16:58 UTC <catteadams> @TheJusticeDept @CroxfordRc Those are the rats from the top of the pile that "Dear Leader" brought in with him. He's just replicating himself.

928387201863360512 2017-11-08 22:22:12 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Stop trying to make it seem like $1,182. is a grip of money. It ISN'T. Further, I thought it was $1200. So now it's less? By the time your bill passes you'll be asking us to do a happy dance for $100.! BTW, insurance premiums going up so high, that little squat $$ wont mean

928225653899411456 2017-11-08 11:40:16 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Problem I have is more abt the press using bad photos 2 sell an article thru visual narrative. I've seen it a mil X. U have 2 I may not agree w/ wht she did, but surely 1 can do better than find her worst photo 2 print w an awful byline? We R better journalists than that. Surely
928221769248358403 2017-11-08 11:24:49 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX I did. My comments R really more abt PPL finding the worst pic poss. 2 bash the hell out of her in evry horrid way they can.  Knowing how that goes 4 women, it wouldn't really matter if she did this, or that.  They will make all her pics ugly as they can & demonize her in print.
928198587644706816 2017-11-08 09:52:43 UTC <catteadams> Sometimes i'm so wishy washy I look at Amazon reviews just to see how I feel about the stupid thing I just got in 24 hours.

928195543641202689 2017-11-08 09:40:37 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @therealmrsalett So many Celie quotes apply when you have dastardliness in your heart, for others. That's Ok. I have THAT kind of patience. Celie's day,
928194464299892736 2017-11-08 09:36:19 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @AmyLaVs I did get it. And the sentiment remains the same. How's that for getting it? YOU didn't. Remarkable blindness.
928193069056274432 2017-11-08 09:30:47 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX I really hate that they are finding the MOST unattractive pictures of her to post these articles. This is the part of today's journalism I revile the most. Clicky bait photos. Pfffft!
928180641362984960 2017-11-08 08:41:24 UTC <catteadams> @AddictNews1 "General practitioners in Malaysia have limited training in addiction and Buprenorphine/naloxone." News FLASH. Same thing here. Most Drs that are prescribing it have NO formal training in Addiction. We're so eager to "solve" 1 drug problem by giving another drug. Irresponsible.
928179987642949632 2017-11-08 08:38:48 UTC <catteadams> @AddictNews1 I really fear for all the ppl who are being sold another bad bill of goods with Suboxone. And to be on that for life?  Tell ppl that THAT detox, is a horror show. Stop sugarcoat The panacea Suboxone? BS. Another Phama grab, but worst of all, a P.R. ploy. Addict 4 life w Suboxone.
928178619523915776 2017-11-08 08:33:22 UTC <catteadams> @AddictNews1 This is a common treatment now, but it is NOT the answer. A lifetime of Suboxone? & To suggest weaning off of Suboxone is easier than getting off of opiods is just irresponsible. It's HORRIBLE. Far worse. Much harder. Also, offering methadone as a treatment? Proven failure.

928165841337663488 2017-11-07 07:42:35 UTC <catteadams> @AddictNews1 This may B new 2 Alaska but it's not new. Just another band aid opiate tht they dole out as management. Old treatment. Yes it may keep ppl frm overdosing at first but it also gets abused. Or they stay addicted forever to it. It's also harder to kick thn oxycodone. NOT THE ANSWER
928163279381204992 2017-11-07 07:32:24 UTC <catteadams> @bestofari_ Yup ignorant ppl exist on Twitter. I think we've already covered that.
928163065694076933 2017-11-07 07:31:33 UTC <catteadams> @bestofari_ They are not saying so this, equals that. Stop it.
928153182802296833 2017-11-07 06:52:17 UTC <catteadams> It's so embarrassing to have a POTUS that reads a speech like a 5th grader.  Stumbing over words, ideas, & cumbersome sentences.  2 B fair, his speech writer is not helping him.  4 all the talent out there he chose this guy? Sheeeesh.pic.twitter.com/qmxBSy4hGy
928149131612192768 2017-11-07 06:36:11 UTC <catteadams> @bestofari_ Your tone and the way you question her story is very disturbing and sounds like blaming to me.  Hope you truly are impartial.  PS No one I have seen on twitter has confused reality with an acting job.  Your hypothesis is absolutely absurd. Go in peace and tweet no more.
928144073554194432 2017-11-07 06:16:05 UTC <catteadams> @JeffRicksDude Oh my God Jeff, my heart breaks for you & your family. This is the worst of possible outcomes 4 those who R struggling with health issues & few options. My dear friend died in the same way last month. Poverty and NO health care for far too many years. I am so sorry.pic.twitter.com/FPVolFqk84
928141439338348544 2017-11-07 06:05:37 UTC <catteadams> We CAN FLIP THIS! Darrell and his bigoted political positions have no place in the GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. It's time to say NO to the bigots and call upon the better angels in all of us to vote Darrell Issa OUT. Enough of this madness.https://twitter.com/MikeLevinCA/status/928133792568504320

928139978512613376 2017-11-07 05:59:49 UTC <catteadams> This is VITAL 4 ppl carrying college debt. My god how many things will they take frm those struggling 2 B better? Moms, dads &students w/ huge college debt need this tax break. To lift oneself up thru education is a dream come true 4 all.

928099922179534849 2017-11-07 03:20:39 UTC <catteadams> @MikeLevinCA Wish it was my district. This man is repugnant. He needs to GO!
928096557051789312 2017-11-07 03:07:17 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid @TuckerJS1 @SwiftWriter On the other hand, this is the BEST drinking game EVER.
928095711912062977 2017-11-07 03:03:55 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid That made me laugh.   I've had more effective papers in Jr, High English/Speech and debate class.  Listening to this is brutal, dry, & without any resonance. I can hear his brain saying, sound it out, just sound it out, slowly, slowly.   GAH!  This is torture!
928091992185114624 2017-11-07 02:49:08 UTC <catteadams> @CapehartJ Or crowd size, I swear for god I'll lose it.

928088060561985536 2017-11-07 02:33:31 UTC <catteadams> Jesus, Trump is repeating the same lies in Korea that he spouts here. But hey, they just want to hear him say there will be no war in Korea. "I want peace through strikes?" Yeeeeesh.
928086725179490304 2017-11-07 02:28:12 UTC <catteadams> @TwitterSupport @Twitter @DearAuntCrabby With all of the hundreds of programmers you'd think that would be a skip in the park. They are dragging their feet to change anything. 280? Pffft.
928083210629611520 2017-11-07 02:14:15 UTC <catteadams> @timheidecker What the heck. YOLO. it's Twitter, not a passport. LOL
928082482720784384 2017-11-07 02:11:21 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne Wow. Sounds like you got a great person over there. I just had a beautiful fig tree removed. Found out I am highly allergic.  It had tons of fruit every year. :(  But when it has to go it has to go. Do you eat the loquat?
928081672288976896 2017-11-07 02:08:08 UTC <catteadams> @thetomzone Those ears turned back don't look too happy. I feel a paw punch comin'
928081164744605696 2017-11-07 02:06:07 UTC <catteadams> @jrivera64 I'll double down on that.
928080585389572096 2017-11-07 02:03:49 UTC <catteadams> Tree trimming is sooooo expensive. It's hard to bite that one off.  And then they grow back. LOL Mine's due again. Don't know how it's gonna get done. We took 60 feet off it last time. But now it won't fall on our house. *sigh To think of what I coulda done with that $$.https://twitter.com/estarianne/status/928079136588828672

928078097273954304 2017-11-07 01:53:55 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump It would do you good to remember the words of Celie once in a while. "everything you touch will crumble."
928076875250876416 2017-11-07 01:49:04 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl @ohmar762 @SegBoss Not crying tonight.
928076503232888832 2017-11-07 01:47:35 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump Actually it was the Trump effect. Yeah, that's how you're gonna be remembered. Like the poison you spew, now it's on you.

928065440147914752 2017-11-07 01:03:38 UTC <catteadams> @RepChrisCollins @cimarcos That is deeply disturbing. I hope Chris Collins also knows the PPL are donors too, not just corps.  Chris's statement makes us realize we have no say in how they vote and THAT is truly appalling. Our reps truly don't serve us.
928063567865114624 2017-11-07 00:56:11 UTC <catteadams> @CillizzaCNN If that's the worst anyone says about you in life, you're pretty lucky. SO, happy Tuesday!

928060671652126720 2017-11-07 00:44:41 UTC <catteadams> YES! It took me 30 years to out my sexual /physical assaulter. It is really hard when you're in this business. I didn't tell because he had so much fame and money I knew I couldnt afford to fight him in court. And I had witnesses.
928059403516837888 2017-11-07 00:39:38 UTC <catteadams> @Moona9 @bestofari_ Yeah, ummmm,.... no.

927721526572417025 2017-11-06 02:17:02 UTC <catteadams> @praisethelourd Try on a wig first. Black is a really hard color for most skin tones. And REALLY hard to get out if you don't like it. #Hairdresser4Life

924376918119424000 2017-10-28 20:46:46 UTC <catteadams> @DemocalypseNow @BooBooNyc Saw that. Looking in2 both sides w/impartiality. When I C the biases come out I move on. Either side. Rather the straight facts, not opinion
924375952158683136 2017-10-28 20:42:55 UTC <catteadams> @BooBooNyc Taking your information& converting it in2/assertion Soros himself funded Ferguson-related protests &riots is problematic. But, this is twtr
924372521561886720 2017-10-28 20:29:17 UTC <catteadams> @DemocalypseNow @BooBooNyc I like to read up on your sources for that. If true, I confess it's news to me. Where would you point me to do that?
924372134071115776 2017-10-28 20:27:45 UTC <catteadams> @DemocalypseNow @BooBooNyc SO by that def. A rich white guy holding all the cards gets the little guys to fight, 4 his amusement. So we dont notice he owns them all.
924371263195291648 2017-10-28 20:24:17 UTC <catteadams> @BooBooNyc All lives matter but they are not equal. That is BLM. Started by women 2 protest black ppl being slaughtered by police brutality w/ impunity
924370703033364480 2017-10-28 20:22:04 UTC <catteadams> @jaytay777 & pro women, pro Native American justice, on and on. But they only want one thing. POC and Jews to leave America and never be seen again.
924370181501022208 2017-10-28 20:19:59 UTC <catteadams> @joey_girardi Lots of white and brown ppl of all hues at BLM. And it's cause is different. WLM. Just white ppl wanting what, exactly? Ethnic cleansing.

924367883748098048 2017-10-28 20:10:52 UTC <catteadams> @GrantJKidney Your last line is a classic line of identity politics. U're blaming Dem. U must be the most ironic person ever, or just like the ppl U blame

924366579801788416 2017-10-28 20:05:41 UTC <catteadams> @jbro_1776 @DANNK2 Poor is poor. most ppl dont want to know about it, see it, deal with it, or live it.
924366338700611584 2017-10-28 20:04:43 UTC <catteadams> @DaveChoate @jbro_1776 And you KNOW that because?
924366196610179072 2017-10-28 20:04:09 UTC <catteadams> @DaveChoate @jbro_1776 It's not overt in your face. It's often subtle and hard to see when you aren't a POC. But if it happened to U continually, you'd know it.
924365972944719872 2017-10-28 20:03:16 UTC <catteadams> @DaveChoate @jbro_1776 You are looking for fault, like it's 1 thing, person , group. It's a system of things that work against U. U dont see it, not happening 2 U
924365308885811201 2017-10-28 20:00:38 UTC <catteadams> @sherryj341 @jbro_1776 Big things and little things happen every day to prove that we are not equals. And it's exhausting. We just want an equal playing field.
924364836451975169 2017-10-28 19:58:45 UTC <catteadams> @sherryj341 @jbro_1776 So many things like that, that you may not be aware of, happen from within. I'm white, hubster black. See it happpen for real. denied apts.
924364400311484416 2017-10-28 19:57:01 UTC <catteadams> @sherryj341 @jbro_1776 It's not just bills. We all have bills.  But did you know that black people are paid less than you for the same work, just for being black?

924310111614484481 2017-10-28 16:21:18 UTC <catteadams> @MSNBC Well they have to pretend to do SOMETHING, nothing else is getting done. But what a waste of money. OUR MONEY.

924307555039375360 2017-10-28 16:11:08 UTC <catteadams> @MSNBC @move2canada @Lav_Jade @HD_Bones You're giving musicians (even part timers) a bad name. As a full time musician I'd like to say, stop playing music, it's warping your mind.
924306451698294784 2017-10-28 16:06:45 UTC <catteadams> @MSNBC @Whaddayaneed Rhinestones are to diamonds, as Trump is to a presidency. Not much in substance, and fooling no one..

924183974569656320 2017-10-28 08:00:04 UTC <catteadams> @lightheart1 He did just that. You said it better. It just bothered me at the deepest level. & those kids had not clue one, as to what he was talking abt
924183615289802753 2017-10-28 07:58:39 UTC <catteadams> @KarenMKunkle So many great campaigns at #GoFundMe  Really needy PR cases. And real everyday ppl from here just going and doing quiet humanitarian work.

924180336623329280 2017-10-28 07:45:37 UTC <catteadams> @lightheart1 That he spoke to the kids as a way to mock the press, was cringe worthy. They looked at him blankly like, what? The bad press?   We're 7.
924173144469913601 2017-10-28 07:17:02 UTC <catteadams> This need to be repeated until everyone see's it. That just makes me sick at heart.https://twitter.com/Impeach_D_Trump/status/924172631925854208

924168659026681861 2017-10-27 06:59:13 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ACalmConfucious Yes. When U have been assaulted & raped & abused by men w/ power, U learn 2 trust a woman who has the courage 2 say, "this happened to me"
924165224185212928 2017-10-27 06:45:34 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ACalmConfucious I pray you never do.

919547171669655554 2017-10-15 12:55:04 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ACalmConfucious Anyone who says they just don't get it, just doesn't want to get it, and they don't know enuf about it. Easy 2 judge. Get smart about it.
919546778692677632 2017-10-15 12:53:31 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ACalmConfucious Disgusting beyond. The man makes my skin crawl.  Here's to life without him. Soon.

919545598709075968 2017-10-15 12:48:49 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ninjabitch True. Kids are brought by parents. There is a blind spot where there is money and power.

919462507533570048 2017-10-15 07:18:39 UTC <catteadams> @Liee4Trump @ColumbiaBugle @BurghMan @debsugar If it's basis is power over another human being we can go back to the beginning of time itself. And now it's time to cut the sore out. 
919461407443128320 2017-10-15 07:14:16 UTC <catteadams> @TheAcademy Do we have to personally SHOW Bruce Feldman the diff between execs who belittle and scream at everyone daily & sexual assault?
919460754691997696 2017-10-15 07:11:41 UTC <catteadams> @TheAcademy The ideas expressed by Bruce Feldman R the PROBLEM. 2 start a sentence w "its not that I wouldn't like to see Harvey"  *downhill
919456542377762816 2017-10-14 06:54:57 UTC <catteadams> @voxdotcom @VABVOX If Bruce Feldman doesn't know the difference between being yelled at &being sexually assaulted I think that can be arranged. Men like THIS
919455317833822208 2017-10-14 06:50:05 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost And they eat it up like cereal. Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Pffft! SOOO dumb. Santa, all I want is a "dumb" buzzer 4 xmas! Promise

919438557466411008 2017-10-14 05:43:29 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv That is the dynamic. We have 2 feel safe. Feel supported. Take our power back. B proud U did that. tht's how it works. Brains heal brains
919437720656556032 2017-10-14 05:40:09 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle Bless you. We all can change the world if we talk about the really tough stuff. Not easy. But possible.
919437227951656960 2017-10-14 05:38:12 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv FAntastic! To be supported in your truth is such a profound moment. I don't even know you and I'm proud of you!
919436708550025219 2017-10-14 05:36:08 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle It nearly cost me my life. But I'm here to say that it gets better. There is hope. And there is peace. Truth wins.
919436410502856704 2017-10-14 05:34:57 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle My point is everyone covers up sexual abuse. Everyone everywhere PPL are telling their truths from sea to shining sea, many, 4 the 1st X
919435608598052864 2017-10-14 05:31:46 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv Did your parents help you with that?
919435477324775424 2017-10-14 05:31:14 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv I undrstnd. It took me till I ws in my 20's to tell my mom that my father had abused me since I was 3. then I had 2 keep her frm killing him
919434695061913601 2017-10-14 05:28:08 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle In a weird way it made me very, very, strong. Or maybe that was the decades of therapy. LOL
919434449120518146 2017-10-14 05:27:09 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle I dont have any stats on that. Nthing surprises me. Our culture has become sick w porn. It has changed our brains. True. Tht research I know
919433837846786048 2017-10-14 05:24:43 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv Out him if you can to the BBS on campus.   Tell everyone you can if he still exists.

919433185288527872 2017-10-14 05:22:08 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle Any big city is the same. I grew up in Upper Michigan. In a TINY town. Less than 5 K It happened to me anyway.
919432766520823809 2017-10-14 05:20:28 UTC <catteadams> @ambertamblyn Hey Amber, I got U. Immediately. Lots of triggers happening out here. It's a flash point for sure and lots of stuff is coming up for ppl. 
919429625805029376 2017-10-14 05:07:59 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle Well I hope you realize that Hollywood is largely made up of ppl who came from somewhere else. When you live here. U get that.
919429278176919552 2017-10-14 05:06:36 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle Well if you think it's limited to Hollywood check out the biggest pedo ring in US history. Not LA.

919427996276088837 2017-10-14 05:01:31 UTC <catteadams> @KatyinIndy @ColumbiaBugle @karystus That's absurd. Do you know how enmeshed this city is? A bomb could go off and those parasites would be back in a week.
919427608667856896 2017-10-14 04:59:58 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle I have seen it. It was incredible. Did anything change? If anything they go more underground. Point being it's all about secrecy, no matter
919427068063989760 2017-10-14 04:57:49 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @blkdiamond97 This is a watershed moment. Lets C if real change is possible. My guess? It will die down and go back to the same damn thing.
919426633978732546 2017-10-14 04:56:06 UTC <catteadams> @ColumbiaBugle @ffmicol Lets remember? How old am I? Over 100? Where'd ya get that tidbit of info? Never heard that one. Send me a link pls?

919425120657072128 2017-10-14 04:50:05 UTC <catteadams> @Liee4Trump @ColumbiaBugle @BurghMan All of that was here long before Hollywood and the movies tho...that's the problem.
919424538642804736 2017-10-14 04:47:46 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv @PJJENN_00 When tht happened I literally ran away down the street breathless frm fear. Anxiety overwhelmed me. Tht lasted 4 a few weeks.

919423150110097408 2017-10-14 04:42:15 UTC <catteadams> @rosemcgowan @vemmv @PJJENN_00 It's conflicting. We are torn between casting out a parent who has provided 4 us in many ways, or living w the pain & keeping them in it.

919374641340194816 2017-10-14 01:29:30 UTC <catteadams> I really dont think most men know how common it i for us to be abused in the work place. if they did maybe they would be more protective?

918330349167374336 2017-10-11 04:19:51 UTC <catteadams> what kind of man Seymour was.  I told every1 I could. No one cared. & they knew Put up with it or leave, they said. I left. Broken & bruised
918329907737796608 2017-10-11 04:18:06 UTC <catteadams> call up for maid service. He was thrown out of hotels. Still no one did anything about it. I was never able to tell Lee. but he knew
918329657870524416 2017-10-11 04:17:06 UTC <catteadams> I talked to others in the cast. One woman punched Seymour in the stomach for doing the same thing. He would disrobe in his hotel and
918329423245467648 2017-10-11 04:16:10 UTC <catteadams> I asked to speak to Lee. Nope. couldn't be done. I had to give up a really great gig & I loved Lee, because I couldnt take the sexual abuse
918329174217056257 2017-10-11 04:15:11 UTC <catteadams> coudn't stand it anymore. When it =came time to renegotiate my contract Seymour called my manager. Ask for crazy $$ I said. He'll go away.
918328836130881536 2017-10-11 04:13:50 UTC <catteadams> Oh he's an old man, he's harmless. No I would say. this is not right. I'm scared. He's hurting me. Just ignore him I was told. finally I

918328360404623360 2017-10-11 04:11:57 UTC <catteadams> I asked to be escorted everywhre I was so scared of him. He would do anything to get ppl out of the room and b alone w me. He would rub up
918328071425441792 2017-10-11 04:10:48 UTC <catteadams> He tried to kiss me. I coudnt break away. Every time I saw him he would corner me and push up against me. Ask me to do things to him.
918327789014544384 2017-10-11 04:09:41 UTC <catteadams> His manager Was Seymour Heller & he was anything but a gent. He pushed me up against a wall & pushed himself on me. He was incredibly strong

918323438619574272 2017-10-11 03:52:24 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle @IamCindyNewsome Never know when that time will come when U say, that's enough. Sometimes it hits home in a way you never thought possible be4. Like now.
918322656792928256 2017-10-11 03:49:17 UTC <catteadams> @thatgregorydude @MereMay87 @Bourdain @Engerlandm8 She's not my hero. So start there. & U presume she is playing dumb. Your opinion. And U accuse me of dishonesty. Name calling is so immature

918321190514524160 2017-10-11 03:43:28 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle @_tatvamasi @IamCindyNewsome Only money and power. That's why it's better to act locally to change the quality of our lives. Moguls B moguling. LOL Change the game focus
918320818421035008 2017-10-11 03:41:59 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle @IamCindyNewsome @_tatvamasi Ed Royce. Issa also has 2 go. Seriously a perverse dude. On the way to SD I saw ppl on the overpass w signs NO Darrel Issa lit in neon. COOL

918316508559716354 2017-10-11 03:24:51 UTC <catteadams> I'm so immature sometimes. I still laugh when ppl use the word lugubrious.
918316209015099392 2017-10-11 03:23:40 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle @IamCindyNewsome We are more powerful than we think. In fact we are the most powerful thing in the process of governance

918312068926783488 2017-10-11 03:07:13 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @SRuhle @IamCindyNewsome My M.O is Act locally, show up at local offices, bring massive public attention to the issues. And agitate. Build coalitions with other org

918300672570793984 2017-10-11 02:21:56 UTC <catteadams> I keep saying to myself, surely they know better than this. We need proof. CNN get down there. Book a room and check in, push record. https://twitter.com/ackrantz11/status/917926381547335680
918300420530888705 2017-10-11 02:20:56 UTC <catteadams> @CNN @ARS1978 Wow. Do we have any proof that this was handed out? Can somebody get this on camera? CNN send someone over there to check in.

918287139778916352 2017-10-11 01:28:09 UTC <catteadams> @ABC I just marvel at that hair color and how it keeps morphing from one into another like fall leaves. It's seasonal hair, ya'll.

918281233368457216 2017-10-11 01:04:41 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPost It's a start. Maybe they could remove the videos that assail races religions with hateful rhetoric. It's a company. They can have STANDARDS

918280029355761664 2017-10-11 00:59:54 UTC <catteadams> @Bourdain @monicaisliberal It centers blame on WOMEN that were there. Different. I already got the secondary point. I'm pointing out a hidden bias.

918275821487263745 2017-10-11 00:43:11 UTC <catteadams> @Bourdain @monicaisliberal Actually ALL execs. that know about it should be held accountable w equal blame if they are silent. your twt still blames women either way

916512575004622848 2017-10-06 03:56:40 UTC <catteadams> @jules_su That he still enjoys ANY approval is astonishing to me. The issues that hit us as individuals ar stacking up tho.

916447760416571392 2017-10-06 23:39:07 UTC <catteadams> @billpruitt And I'm kinda curious if Trump was allowed to shape the narrative. How could you know he would run 4 president & win? Nightmare

915819677967724544 2017-10-04 06:03:20 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu Well I know I rarely smelled ppl smoking pot in their cars in Calif. but now that it's legal it's almost every other car on weekends. Honest
915811922577993728 2017-10-04 05:32:31 UTC <catteadams> @CNNMoney @PoliticalAnt IF FB was serious they would create policy to take ZERO political ads. ZERO tolerance for undue influence of naive and gullible ppl.

915803378831179776 2017-10-04 04:58:34 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg So did you move there to do it?
915803272824315905 2017-10-04 04:58:09 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Actually my Q's have been practical, knowing ppl, I wonder what happens there when ppl break the rules. there must b a contract of some sort
915801363866574849 2017-10-04 04:50:34 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Well I thought you said you were going to speed it up somehow. Maybe I got that wrong. You live there now?
915801077982797824 2017-10-04 04:49:26 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Imagine if all of a sudden 2 million ppl moved there,  ppl break social contracts all the time. that's why cities have so many rules.
915800312065138689 2017-10-04 04:46:23 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg What do you do about all the inner city ppl who want it? how do they participate in this? All the ppl wthout financial abilities to do it?
915799664107991042 2017-10-04 04:43:49 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg In a society where travel was almost impossible. Not in the modern age.
915799150750425088 2017-10-04 04:41:46 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Most populations are concentrated in larger cities. They just up and move to where there's land? that takes a LOT of financial resources.
915797898234695680 2017-10-04 04:36:48 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Actually there are tons of regulations/laws/ordnces about lawns & houses & U need land. U need 2 have financial resources 2 buy land..
915796902809034752 2017-10-04 04:32:50 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Actually I'm not trying to compartmentalize. I'm trying to find out who the visionary is and where this happens Is there a movement. Where?
915796594443771904 2017-10-04 04:31:37 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Drug policies have failed when the money incentive is high and corruption rules the outcome. Drug war is completely flawed in conception
915795706320797696 2017-10-04 04:28:05 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Who leads? Where does this exist? where is the movement? Send me the address.  How many are involved?
915795197157502976 2017-10-04 04:26:04 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Where does this place exist and can I by a ticket?
915794992647540736 2017-10-04 04:25:15 UTC <catteadams> @ABC This is who we are. We know where the high bar is and are not afraid to grab it. Beautiful. Well done!
915794517600624640 2017-10-04 04:23:22 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg We already live in a free market society, we live in a competitive society.
915793254385192961 2017-10-04 04:18:21 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg there's the problem. Most ppl are struggling just to live. the middle class can barely make it. The poor arent making it at all.
915792525356523520 2017-10-04 04:15:27 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg We've never had any real effort in trying. It's always half measures or failed at the legislation. Money incentivises everything.
915788093814272001 2017-10-04 03:57:50 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Actually I am talking about the mod's and those are very easy to get. The stockpiles of ammo, easy. The kinds of ammo, easy.
915781014554685440 2017-10-04 03:29:42 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg May I also say how much I appreciate your convo. Sincerely do.
915780163186573312 2017-10-04 03:26:19 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Well we have controls on decongestant for gods sake . You can't get it in any amount you want, &  have to sign for it. Cut off easy access.
915779381091459075 2017-10-04 03:23:13 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg not all thngs progress on all fronts equally but real leaders set the tone for real advancement. Including consciousness.
915778452019539968 2017-10-04 03:19:31 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg I guess what I would say is all of your assertions ar cogent. And in a nearly perfect world... We are light years away from that.
915777735095549953 2017-10-04 03:16:41 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg New approach to automatic weaponry and unlimited ammo stockpiles avail 2 any1 is not an abstract concept 4 me.
915777546641326080 2017-10-04 03:15:56 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg It requires a group consciousness we simply don't have yet in the USA. . We seem 2 B devolving and regressing.
915776251549278209 2017-10-04 03:10:47 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Wish they would....some ppl need to go to prison...they are incorrigibles. I guess I have lived too long to do nothing. Ive seen the change
915775895410941952 2017-10-04 03:09:22 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg That's 1 view. But I have seen great things come frm govt programs 2 numerous 2 tweet. I will not just sit by &say hey everyone fix yourself

915767359930908673 2017-10-04 02:35:27 UTC <catteadams> If I give you a "like" it's because we are speaking like grown folks. As soon as you get snarky and mean, I take em back.  So there.
915766906384031744 2017-10-04 02:33:39 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg An instant appeal? Hardly. So, how much of your personal $ do U want 2 donate 2 solving this complicated issue? Paying taxes isn't doing it
915763251916431360 2017-10-04 02:19:07 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu @jess_bbg Make access to these things harder. Want to now how many ppl smoke weed in their cars now that it's legal? I deal w them all night long.

915751625909604352 2017-10-04 01:32:56 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu But 2 remain motionless and do nothing is unconscionable.
915751560595902464 2017-10-04 01:32:40 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu What is the harm of TRYING banning mods to automatic weapons? Laws are repealed/changed all the time. If it doesn't work change it.
915749855200403456 2017-10-04 01:25:53 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu the numbers R high enough. I'd  like 2 hear ideas 4 the solutions to this that we could actually pass/bipartisan. Ideologues aint cuttin it

915747259643338753 2017-10-04 01:15:35 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders @Suuntzuu I wish it were that simple. And now all the cuts 2 health care, especially mental health care.  We R smart ppl. We can do better than this
915746480614367232 2017-10-04 01:12:29 UTC <catteadams> @SenSanders Nice thought, Bernster.  What's the plan? I'll be right over.

915097959162769413 2017-10-02 06:15:29 UTC <catteadams> To awaken in Trump world is to awaken grimacing, braced 4 what has happened in the night. 2 then await the ineffective, inadequate response.

915089018055823360 2017-10-02 05:39:58 UTC <catteadams> @samswey I take your point, but it's not a contest. We have so much historical violence in our past & this violence will not b the last. #LEGISLATE

914991692389900289 2017-10-02 23:13:13 UTC <catteadams> @Cabbig82 No fault of the gun makers. Why should they have a conscience or C wher this is going? They are in bed w/ our legislative body. Connect dots
914991381805883393 2017-10-02 23:11:59 UTC <catteadams> @Cabbig82 Lets look at the stats for coffee deaths/lawsuits as compared to guns. There it is. Inanimate objects don't do anything. WE ANIMATE THEM.
914990813280559105 2017-10-02 23:09:44 UTC <catteadams> @4everNeverTrump Except when it happened to them at baseball. Then they almost flinched.

914981379527413760 2017-10-02 22:32:15 UTC <catteadams> @Nelba_MG @AnandDharawat1 No. I'm saying the oversimplification of, if everyone would just do what you say, all would be well, no wars, no problems, everyone happy.

914978143185670144 2017-10-02 22:19:23 UTC <catteadams> @Nelba_MG @AnandDharawat1 This is your belief, but as such, it doesn't make it true 4 others. Just like any other person's belief may seem crazy and incoherent 2 U
914977587012579329 2017-10-02 22:17:10 UTC <catteadams> @Nelba_MG @AnandDharawat1 That's incredibly naive.
914976985662681088 2017-10-02 22:14:47 UTC <catteadams> @Nelba_MG We do. All the time. Every time ther is a mass shooting it's usually white males. And we all talk about it, examine it, try to understand it

914808837026091009 2017-10-02 11:06:37 UTC <catteadams> @MSNBC STOP replaying the horrific shooting over &over & over & over. REally? On a loop? WE GET IT.  Report, but stop this. Just like 911. 
914807520639819776 2017-10-02 11:01:23 UTC <catteadams> @cnnbrk Is it really necessary 2 keep running the shooting video every 5 minutes? WE understand what we R seeing/what Ure saying. STOP THIS.

913516941838401537 2017-09-28 21:33:05 UTC <catteadams> That is flat out stealing from taxpayers. He needs to make us whole. I believe he knows the def of that. What a WEASEL. #PriceFullPricehttps://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/913505896021594113

897937767501516800 2017-08-16 21:47:01 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @PepperGii @DD_Beast false equivalency. I.E. those two things are not equal. BTW, they were all faiths, colors, coming out of a church meeting.
897936423151484928 2017-08-16 21:41:40 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @PepperGii @lfazio22 Ok No worries
897935895860355072 2017-08-16 21:39:35 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @PepperGii @DD_Beast Why? What did they do? They were complete innocents.
897935070815592449 2017-08-16 21:36:18 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @PepperGii @lfazio22 And the vice interviews prior certainly did prove they meant harm.
897934816158507008 2017-08-16 21:35:17 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @PepperGii @lfazio22 So you know then, inciting Violence May Not Be Protected Speech. speech must have the intent and the likelihood of causing imminent violence

897751985859866624 2017-08-16 09:28:47 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @Mauijonny I believe you saw my twt saying ANTIFA is about anarchy and anytime they bring violence they should be prosecuted. So pls stop.
897751588608950272 2017-08-16 09:27:12 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @Mauijonny Criminalising the incitement of violence or threats can be seen to be a justifiable limit on freedom of expression. Just look it up.
897750854035415040 2017-08-16 09:24:17 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @whitedevil1492 All have to stop the violence. It solves absolutely nothing. HISTORY. You have to go now. I see your rhetoric coming. Go in peace.
897750311313350657 2017-08-16 09:22:08 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @whitedevil1492 And protesting something is much different than bringing violence to anything.
897749676404817921 2017-08-16 09:19:36 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @whitedevil1492 PPL try to pigeon hole me with that. If you bring violence U should be prosecuted. There is no righter right.
897749140905484288 2017-08-16 09:17:29 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @whitedevil1492 ANTIFA is for anarchy and violence. They are WRONG.

883552825606774784 2017-07-07 05:06:23 UTC <catteadams> @Americanism @trump_woman Too bad he talks it, not walks it. He believes in nothing but himself.  Fake as hell.

882135449451417600 2017-07-04 07:14:15 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump The scariest thing about you DT is your speculating and guessing about world leaders & their moves politically. This isn't DEAR DIARY U know

881585105034067968 2017-07-02 18:47:22 UTC <catteadams> @ananavarro It's modern day delusional. And scary. He appears so unhinged as to be commit-able. And a complete embarrassment.
881584618360651776 2017-07-02 18:45:26 UTC <catteadams> @FLOTUS @thor_benson Soooooo much winning, wrapped in sooooooo much losing. They both look so ridiculous now.
881583308806668288 2017-07-02 18:40:14 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann It's NOT gonna happen. Have you looked at who is IN the cabinet? Honor, dignity, ethics left months ago. Say something real.

873755771858698240 2017-06-10 04:16:24 UTC <catteadams> @RawStory Ironic that the 1 who wanted 2 EDUCATE us knew so little about the subject. His takeaway was the subject is off limits? Still doesn't get it
873754415630606336 2017-06-10 04:11:00 UTC <catteadams> @ajplus This is heartless on a level I can't even describe.

872342712179200000 2017-06-06 06:41:24 UTC <catteadams> @irishheart1960 @TomthunkitsMind Many also turned a blind eye. Thus: the cover up. Again, the GOP and their dirty tricks.

872336167932489728 2017-06-06 06:15:24 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX @loveislove104 Ditto. I am NOT myself. The hubster feels the same. And we feel exhausted with the drama. Not even 6 mos has passed since Trumpy got in.

872220245745819648 2017-06-06 22:34:46 UTC <catteadams> @Forbes @EricTrump @Fahrenthold I gotta say, that was brilliantly constructed. The only thing he can do now is not answer. Cause you just rope-a-doped him.

872217278816833537 2017-06-06 22:22:58 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid It's either than or go back to golfing. Lame duck syndrome, in spades.
872217052588658688 2017-06-06 22:22:05 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid They'll desert him when its time and then suck up to Pence, and so on, and so on, and so on....
872216697301684224 2017-06-06 22:20:40 UTC <catteadams> @BraddJaffy So, once again Kellyanne lied. On TV. To everyone. Her fake indignant blather is more than I can stand. They are all over the map.

872214247727443968 2017-06-06 22:10:56 UTC <catteadams> @owillis Interesting that one would have to consult the magic catalog of answers tho. And that's a biggun.
872213676844924928 2017-06-06 22:08:40 UTC <catteadams> @Freeyourmindkid That word in our mouth does not have an ambiguous meaning. EVER. It has only been used to demean, denigrate. He knows that. Fuck Bill Maher.

872205880011313153 2017-06-06 21:37:41 UTC <catteadams> @guardian @FlorFox88 Yeah, but its about frequencies not necessarily volumes. Covering an infants ears is a better plan, & I'm sure the bonding wud B the same :)
872017630089097216 2017-06-06 09:09:38 UTC <catteadams> @JordanChariton If he's in the 1% he knows of what he speaks. My stomach hurts.
872017169726533632 2017-06-06 09:07:49 UTC <catteadams> @maggieNYT @peterbakernyt @BraddJaffy A guy who wants a loyalty oath doesn't seem to have any himself.
872016393260204033 2017-06-06 09:04:44 UTC <catteadams> @guardian The little ones R the ones who should have ear muffs on. Infant ears can be damaged by sounds adults might think are ok. Hope they know that
872015177557913600 2017-06-06 08:59:54 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @BillWylie3rd Never have the words "because I said so" been so true.  And soooooooo weird.
872014837651472385 2017-06-06 08:58:33 UTC <catteadams> @ABC @brennen_simon I thought it came from FB.
872014599368974336 2017-06-06 08:57:36 UTC <catteadams> @ABC Yeah. Because he can't. Someone should tell him/  
872014140805709824 2017-06-06 08:55:47 UTC <catteadams> @JosephRemiB It was pretty fun. :) Radical was a favorite.  A radical and aggressive maneuver!  So silly to say. Still fun.

872002776515137536 2017-06-06 08:10:37 UTC <catteadams> When did "literally" take the place of "actually"? I hate them both.  Oh hell, Lets bring "like" back.  It was tubular, and pretty gnarly.

871999548465479680 2017-06-06 07:57:47 UTC <catteadams> @USMC_DD What if the plan was even more diabolical, & the GOP wanted Pence all along, & knew Trump would blow it & not serve the whole term? Horrors!

871264013232988160 2017-06-04 07:15:02 UTC <catteadams> @NedSparks Oh LORD I give up. It's both. Looks at the area where the head/face/hair meet. FAKE. Amateurish. Nitey nite.
871263653613326340 2017-06-04 07:13:36 UTC <catteadams> Well party pals, it's been fun, but momma's got to get up for church in the morning. G'nite my lovelies! Have a grand WKND!
871263138540277761 2017-06-04 07:11:34 UTC <catteadams> @NedSparks I'm saying it Is an amateur job of photo shopping an image. I've been doing photoshop since it came out and that's a hack job.
871262648603525121 2017-06-04 07:09:37 UTC <catteadams> @ralph66mg Oh, why does he do ANYthing? Broken brain.. LOL
871261892010012673 2017-06-04 07:06:36 UTC <catteadams> That may be true, but this photo is not.  If he is Mr. kinky boots, one will emerge and it will be irrefutable.
871260932671811584 2017-06-04 07:02:48 UTC <catteadams> @jrivera64 @BillKristol Where DO these mooks come from anyway? They just believe any old thing he throws at them. We used to call that being a rube, an easy fool.
871260045316571137 2017-06-03 06:59:16 UTC <catteadams> @INTPNews @JoyAnnReid He thinks theyre his now, &he needs the money. He'll sell anything he can get his hands on. This was the best deal to fall into his lap ever
871257548623536129 2017-06-03 06:49:21 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @OPSVeracity I've been doing photoshop since it came out and that's bad placement and blending, it's just all off.
871257339852054528 2017-06-03 06:48:31 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @OPSVeracity The angle of the head, the roughness of the merging layers..the physical placement of the face into the head and hair area...it's just wrong
871256646500073472 2017-06-03 06:45:46 UTC <catteadams> That is classic amateur photoshop.
871256377179521025 2017-06-03 06:44:42 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @OPSVeracity That is classic photoshop. And an amateur one at that. The end.
871255716761174017 2017-06-03 06:42:04 UTC <catteadams> @ABC Oh what the effing hell are they thinking?  This is where we kill them and save them from themselves?

871254118597148672 2017-06-03 06:35:43 UTC <catteadams> I can't wait 4 Monday when Spicey has to try to walk back the old Muslim ban again. He must Effing hate the weekends. & Twitter specifically

871251070030290944 2017-06-03 06:23:36 UTC <catteadams> @allanbrauer But Twitter is just rife for a pile on when a twit like that makes it so easy. Much ado about nothing? Perhaps. Better than mowing the lawn.
871250361125748736 2017-06-03 06:20:47 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne He's got about three moves. & All of the tells are obvious. He's no match for the intellectuals & deep thinkers. So he goes away mad.
871249750183378945 2017-06-03 06:18:22 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne Someone should have told him, ah Trumpy, you CANT sue other countries to scare them away.
871249506234269696 2017-06-03 06:17:23 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne Yeah, well, what he THINKS and what it IS, is the problem. LOL
871248939462283267 2017-06-03 06:15:08 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne And he's never had to pay for his business bullying. But now on a world stage, everything has consequences, and they don't stop playing out
871248627192037376 2017-06-03 06:13:54 UTC <catteadams> @estarianne This is true. And when it all goes pear shaped and it STILL does (Canada Trump proprty bankrupt recently) he just dumps out w/bankruptcy
871247690687946752 2017-06-03 06:10:11 UTC <catteadams> @hinterlandg @NBCNightlyNews So he's sick and in need of G.A. What a way to end your natural life. Manila is no joke.  They don't give a damn about G.A. Horribly sad end
871246780414926848 2017-06-03 06:06:34 UTC <catteadams> @Freeyourmindkid Nothing is so good as making it funny when someone goes rabid.  Well done.....lolololololol

871240332846837760 2017-06-03 05:40:56 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR Good and smart momma.
871240127128809472 2017-06-03 05:40:07 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR I dont think he's a white supremacist, I think he's a racist, misogynist, muslim hater. As is evidenced by the words he speaks/ideas he has
871239537329979392 2017-06-03 05:37:47 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR Yeah, well who says I'm not upset when it's used period? Not me.
871239303447191552 2017-06-03 05:36:51 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR It offends me because I know what's behind Bill Maher's using of it. That's it and that's all.
871238996604497924 2017-06-03 05:35:38 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR Cant disagree. But we have to stop it. We can not change history & how it has always been used by whites is to denigrate. Bill Maher hell no
871238489097945088 2017-06-03 05:33:37 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR Hip hop gives everyone a pass on it, as does rap.
871237773432209408 2017-06-03 05:30:46 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR it's up to all of us to weed it out and replace it with a sense of dignity & not keep passing it on like its nothing. nuff said. Go in peace
871237466145017856 2017-06-03 05:29:33 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR If we don't know as a people what's wrong about this we just havent been paying attention. But it's ingrained in our history and culture. p1
871217826735939584 2017-06-03 04:11:30 UTC <catteadams> @RedDahliaPR I love it when ppl completely miss the point.

870904630292561920 2017-06-03 07:26:59 UTC <catteadams> @politico I agree with you. Her father is not smart enough to have guile. Just animal instinct. But she? She KNOWS exactly what she is doing 24/7

870889722326822912 2017-06-02 06:27:44 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Remembering when we used 2 have stay indoors days in LA. Air was so bad. Emission controls turned much around. We don't have those days now.

862527025751273472 2017-05-10 04:37:22 UTC <catteadams> Breaking news from MikeFarb @mikefarb...story about hacking the voting machines. Worth a follow for sure. In depth investigating.

862366793226043393 2017-05-10 18:00:40 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid As the original architect of this mess, and let's be clear, he is the one who started all of this in motion years ago, he will pay the piper
862366505597521920 2017-05-10 17:59:31 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid He has created this ungodly mess, so, he needs to soak in it. Up to his neck. Even Calgon won't be able to take him away. #OwnsIt #SOWReap

862115206788292608 2017-05-09 01:20:57 UTC <catteadams> I'd like 2 ask ANY Trump supporter this Q, what is enough 2 stop supporting Trump? Proof of money laundering? Collusion w Russians? WHT?
862102895063220225 2017-05-09 00:32:01 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Well, it didnt surprise me one bit. He's one of those old white nostalgia guys.  Oh, and get off his lawn. Cuz he's Dennis Praeger, dammit.
862099974271647744 2017-05-09 00:20:25 UTC <catteadams> @MayorEdMurray @andreafree @LOVETrump9 Interesting that Andrea uses the word reign. That's a term for kings and queens, not presidents.  Sorry to reign on your parade.

862095706768646145 2017-05-09 00:03:28 UTC <catteadams> @DavidYankovich oh yeah. That's gonna happen. Leaks like mad. If we thought we had a lot before, get ready. This will be a seismic blast!
862095086166753280 2017-05-09 00:01:00 UTC <catteadams> @MarkWarner @funder He's free to say anything now. How dumb can Trump be?
862091461235429376 2017-05-09 23:46:35 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Thoughts of a prequel alone makes me shudder.
862090663113801728 2017-05-09 23:43:25 UTC <catteadams> @RepJeffDenham Don't forget you voted NO, on ACA, when you are voted out.  No need to review every little thing you did.  Look to this moment alone. #Shame
862047303908995072 2017-05-09 20:51:07 UTC <catteadams> @igorbobic DELUSIONAL. They will never get it. Because they don't WANT to get it.

862046458186420224 2017-05-09 20:47:46 UTC <catteadams> @BraddJaffy Yeah, that letter will go right in the trash. Do we not know who we are dealing with?  Nice symbolic gesture I guess, tho.
862045931725660161 2017-05-09 20:45:40 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley In the words of Archie Bunker, "Well, whoop dee do!"
862045579278295040 2017-05-09 20:44:16 UTC <catteadams> @Freeyourmindkid We fought it for years in LA. And we fought it on both sides. Not black enough, not white enough. It was exhausting.
862044444190625792 2017-05-09 20:39:46 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan I'm curious. Does ANYONE on this time line believe him? Does anyone anywhere believe him? Who is accepting this and saying ok, I trust you?
862043258095976448 2017-05-09 20:35:03 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan @colfitz Wouldn't THAT be unique? But no. They want far better for themselves.  They would never accept what they want to shove down our throats.
862041999704064000 2017-05-09 20:30:03 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan You eat with that filthy lying mouth? I imagine your kids are covered. Mine isn't.

861860590599380992 2017-05-09 08:29:12 UTC <catteadams> @thetomzone Speechless
861860282292989952 2017-05-09 08:27:58 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley Best question ever asked.
861860025123225600 2017-05-09 08:26:57 UTC <catteadams> @MoodiJudi99 Correct. All politicians should B humorless & have no sense of irony. Way better that way. We need to continue going backwards for progress.

858870406257688578 2017-04-30 02:27:16 UTC <catteadams> It really doesn't matter what Trump does or says. Trumpers don't hold him accountable. Need 2 recon with that. It's the GOP fault in the end

858088909892222977 2017-04-28 22:41:53 UTC <catteadams> I can't imagine what's coming Fri. frm Trump 2 try 2 validate his presidency, in the 1st 100. Hmm, he'll invalidate the 100 day thing, yup.

858080067867426816 2017-04-28 22:06:45 UTC <catteadams> Perhaps caring about what Bernie DOES would B a better stance. But then, you'd have to look at his record & taxes, which he will not release

857419417377841152 2017-04-26 02:21:33 UTC <catteadams> @owillis They have one job. And they're still doing it. Demonising Obama and or a Democrat. Oh effin snore already. They bore me.

857395431898140673 2017-04-26 00:46:15 UTC <catteadams> @SethAbramson Absolutely. ActUp was an org. in the 80's 90's fighting 4 AIDS RX Protesting brings attention 2 our causes. Violence sets us all backwards
857325562594861056 2017-04-26 20:08:37 UTC <catteadams> @mmfa Because it lacks common sense and logic. No one would want it for themselves. Including Congress.  They want better for them, crap for us.

857323672142397440 2017-04-26 20:01:06 UTC <catteadams> @Khanoisseur I believe the phrase they used when this was brought up last time was "unintentionally left blank, 2 B completed @ a later date". Called BS
857094631422652417 2017-04-25 04:50:58 UTC <catteadams> @sarahkliff Amazing what THEY want to have, but insist we don't have.  After all how can you FEEL privileged if you don't GET any special privileges?

857029383202066432 2017-04-25 00:31:42 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid Reminds me of how a June bug twirls on a string. Round &round they go, in all directions, &trying everything they eventually hang themselves

856181819112161280 2017-04-23 16:23:47 UTC <catteadams> @areyou0 So what would it ACTUALLY take? I really dont know. They might have to wait for indictments to come down. The ouster, & then it wont matter.

849471291585425412 2017-04-04 03:58:32 UTC <catteadams> @MrJonCryer @Khanoisseur @proud_patriot17 That changed during BUSH/Obama. When is the last time you crossed international borders? It's a GRIP.

849469829107068928 2017-04-04 03:52:44 UTC <catteadams> @MrJonCryer @Khanoisseur @proud_patriot17 I look at what he did to divide us as a people. It's real. Stirring up hate was his game. Anyway, nice chatting. Doing taxes, now. UGH!

849469239278829568 2017-04-04 03:50:23 UTC <catteadams> @MrJonCryer @Khanoisseur @proud_patriot17 They wouldn't have made health care better. The premiums would have gone up, probably still will. Again, premise that ACA is dying.It's not

847279297823817728 2017-03-29 02:48:20 UTC <catteadams> @activist360 Well, do remember that JFK hired his brother Bobby as AG and he was VERY inexperienced, and it caused a big uproar. #Nepotism
847278901617348610 2017-03-29 02:46:46 UTC <catteadams> @TheRickyDavila That is not a fact. She can legally be an unpaid assistant, or staff. Look it up. She has stepped away from her business.
847278088681431045 2017-03-29 02:43:32 UTC <catteadams> No. It will be an unpaid position, she has stepped away from her business, and is compliant with the law. Do I like it? NO
847277524602073088 2017-03-29 02:41:18 UTC <catteadams> @DavidYankovich This is so funny. Complying with the law is so different than complying w/ ethics, & guess where she learned that? Pffffftt

847274390337110016 2017-03-29 02:28:50 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid @cindylou83163 It's been going on forever.  Bobby Kennedy is an example. PPL were mad then 2. But it goes way back. #nepotism

847272515931996160 2017-03-29 02:21:24 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Actually I didn't even respond to your question, so I was also off topic. LOL I guess that's why sing for a living & you do this :)
847271577506824192 2017-03-29 02:17:40 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX White House officials thought the announcement should be a coordinated message backed by multiple agencies not op ed. Me 3. lol
847270813367648259 2017-03-29 02:14:38 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Correct. That's not what I was saying. It must read confusingly. Oh Twtr, wish you had more characters.
847260869398364164 2017-03-29 01:35:07 UTC <catteadams> @DavidYankovich How 2 cover your ass in 10 easy words. "I tried 2 tell U in an OP-Ed piece". That's not where it should have come frm anyway

847256228623302656 2017-03-29 01:16:40 UTC <catteadams> @iChooseHapi Well that's one for the legal folks to take up. It's been going on since we've had presidents. Ethical is different from legal
847255826645438465 2017-03-29 01:15:04 UTC <catteadams> @dvalls1006 But they can have jobs that R unpaid, advisory capacity or staff. Presidents been doing it forever. Is it ethical? better Q

846903604963262467 2017-03-28 01:55:28 UTC <catteadams> @oreillyfactor @kaelke1212 How about Bill O'Reilly the woman hating, wife beating, racist? Seems to cover most of it.
846899626108104704 2017-03-28 01:39:40 UTC <catteadams> @oreillyfactor Mocking an apology is a gesture that speaks 2 the real U. Erm, Bill, your lack of character is showing. #WhatACREEP

846877148379983872 2017-03-28 00:10:21 UTC <catteadams> @mmfa @JuddLegum And sexist. Cuz we always need to negatively comment on a woman's looks. Always. Especially if we have nothing else.

846861026783985665 2017-03-28 23:06:17 UTC <catteadams> @POTUS @VP Oh, like he would even know. He's not exactly a policy guy dudes. We learned that WED. remember? U keep selling it tho. #snakeOil

846858317825634304 2017-03-28 22:55:31 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley That's the guy. The "what's good for me is not good for you", guy. Ultimately, he's saying I'm better than you, every day. FIRED
846857723891265536 2017-03-28 22:53:09 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley He sure played a good game of "nothing to see here, this happens all the time, no big deal" in interviews tho. A Whoa performance
846857377483677696 2017-03-28 22:51:47 UTC <catteadams> @MaxineWaters @eileendefreest Fox news ppl/fans wouldn't be the ones voting for her in any kind of election anyway. Not her base. justNoise.
846856671133499393 2017-03-28 22:48:58 UTC <catteadams> @ShizukaKobayash The sad thing is ppl believe Fox is news because it says it is. It's opinion & skewed info wrapped in a pol. tabloid rag.
846854913120362498 2017-03-28 22:41:59 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid Joe Walsh is not worth your time ppl. Lowered the bar? So that means the whole cabinet and staff needed the bar lower? Laughable

846852775321333760 2017-03-28 22:33:30 UTC <catteadams> @POTUS @SenFranken It's laughable to hear Trump talk about things not grounded in reality. As if he would even know. HA!
846852438036398080 2017-03-28 22:32:09 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Their wives are going to be so mad that they all packed their best suits in a suitcase. And didn't press them at the hotel. LOL
846852105407115264 2017-03-28 22:30:50 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan I give you this. When you bang your goddamn drum you are relentless. Too bad you lost your audience. #FAIL #trumpIsABadTeacher
846851679328788480 2017-03-28 22:29:08 UTC <catteadams> @kurteichenwald Like coal wasn't responsible for killing men early and of hideous deaths. Incl black lung etc. My God Coal never gave a damn
846850898554904576 2017-03-28 22:26:02 UTC <catteadams> @kurteichenwald Listening to formr coal miners talk on NPR about how their daddy was a coal miner and they need coal to come back, was sad.
846849932732465152 2017-03-28 22:22:12 UTC <catteadams> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan Right. You take the ppl here in America for granted. Much better plan fellahs.  But, Ur time is up. Say, Buhbye as U go.
846849061546209280 2017-03-28 22:18:44 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Less than a thousand ppl are even listening to you on TWTR. SAD. Awful crickety up in here on your page, dude.
846848713209229312 2017-03-28 22:17:21 UTC <catteadams> @LawyerRogelio Why do we need more proof tho? His whole career speaks to his beliefs. Purdy clear to me all these years.
846848370861785088 2017-03-28 22:15:59 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan We tried to tell you but U wouldn't listen. Youre being voted out dude. Hear that? That's the career death knel. & U earned it
846847861023096832 2017-03-28 22:13:58 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan You wouldn't know what the ppl sent U there 2 do because U don't listen & have yr own agenda. Now that's a fact. #REpealFAIL

846550332213727232 2017-03-27 02:31:42 UTC <catteadams> @AndrewLSeidel When Trump says WE, he means, "it's just a game I'm playing, & I'LL always be in good shape". "U suckers" is just implied lol
846526207428456448 2017-03-27 00:55:50 UTC <catteadams> @Dovewoman1 @kylegriffin1 Hey man, I'm in Calif. and I sent in money. Never did that before.
846525775532584960 2017-03-27 00:54:07 UTC <catteadams> reading @Trump_Regrets  It truly boggles the mind how gullible these voters were. NOW they are as shocked and horrified as were, then. Pffft
846517761383657472 2017-03-27 00:22:16 UTC <catteadams> @lopker That's why he must step down. It's supposed to be non partisan. But he blew it. GTFO
846516880173019136 2017-03-27 00:18:46 UTC <catteadams> @dnvolz He must recuse himself. How can anyone not see that at this point? It's bad fatih/trust to let him continue. He wrecked it. #Fool
846516081409769472 2017-03-27 00:15:35 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley And you know both of those dudes, in their own way, think they are cool and got it goin on. Ok ...maybe one of them. Both don't.
846515470819778560 2017-03-27 00:13:10 UTC <catteadams> @kurteichenwald Jesus was a pretty serious guy, but even he would be laughing at this point.

846511586537725952 2017-03-27 23:57:44 UTC <catteadams> @Bernade97386460 @SpeakerRyan Why don't U just do YOUR work instead of framing everything that Obama did as a disaster first? Do yr own work
845884607664861186 2017-03-25 06:26:20 UTC <catteadams> @LawyerRogelio The irony is not lost on me. Vote in an outsider w/ no exp. and then cry and blame some 1 else when it all goes pear shaped.
845879085502914564 2017-03-25 06:04:24 UTC <catteadams> @KMPHFOX26 @FoxNewsSunday @DevinNunes More bad judgement. U need to know when 2 shut up dude. But...U don't. The more you talk, oh nevermind

845845449739153408 2017-03-25 03:50:44 UTC <catteadams> @Acosta He showed his whole hand in this, and they saw he had nothing. He will not get anything thru now.  PS. What a quitter.  SAD reality
845845013141471232 2017-03-25 03:49:00 UTC <catteadams> @Acosta & the complexity of a health care bill, real negotiation skills & giving up  DT can bully shrt term, but congress is about long haul

844837581019758592 2017-03-23 09:05:50 UTC <catteadams> In a way, I feel bad for S. Spicer.  His career is a casualty of this admn. in every way He looks like he is havn a stroke defending it.
844836312368660481 2017-03-23 09:00:47 UTC <catteadams> Paul Ryan's career is in a slow death spiral. Until election time. At which time it will be fast & swift and clear, we have had enough of U
844834947235950592 2017-03-23 08:55:22 UTC <catteadams> Why R political wags allowed 2 REinterpret DJT's tweets as, "he didn't mean that or what he really meant was" TWTs R ALL about 140 specifics

844480963186974720 2017-03-22 09:28:45 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX It's clear he has NO understanding of how this actually reads. I mean, this humorless man has no concept of what makes a thing funny

823033068051013636 2017-01-21 05:02:29 UTC <catteadams> @KeithOlbermann So focused on color, I guess he completely missed the fact that WOMEN united in solidarity, created a movement.

815045695048552448 2016-12-30 04:03:31 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX @alaskawater Agreed. Saddest of all is self loathing & distrust of other women. Time to change that.
815045252755005441 2016-12-30 04:01:45 UTC <catteadams> @RawStory Why would they care about truth? The trumpers love the lies. Sho biz, baby. Just ordinary Sho Biz.

814762402218582016 2016-12-30 09:17:48 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Some are so used to hearing it, accepting it, they cant recognize it, in any form, this attuned, empathic listening. *sigh

810023609129267200 2016-12-16 07:27:32 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid Exactly right. How about some come to Jesus statements? I'll wait. A couple of, I apologize words would go a long way.
810022895531356160 2016-12-16 07:24:42 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid How impotent can he be? Just make a declarative sentence condemning it. Tell them it's time for change, starting now. SAD

807028689711996928 2016-12-08 01:06:48 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime Point well taken. Hadn't thought of the profit motive. I forget ppl make money from youtube, but it is, it's own industry.
807027330333872128 2016-12-08 01:01:24 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @steelworkers @softballscifi @SineadSuantrai They don't feel tricked. They're still waiting. But they will. Give it time.

807025932078678016 2016-12-08 00:55:50 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime I'm an optimist I guess. Nothing is that simple.
807025731804938240 2016-12-08 00:55:02 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime What if he did tho? Wouldnt that be amazing? Once you humanize somebody, the differences fall away...over time...it could hapn
807025403437019136 2016-12-08 00:53:44 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime What is it, a youtube channel? I don't have TV. Well my family and I've been fighting this for 50 years...time to double down.

807022882635161600 2016-12-08 00:43:43 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime All kinds of creepy anomalies are going to be popping up now because of Trump. And we have to wack a mole them back down.
807022411845537797 2016-12-08 00:41:51 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime Yes. Exactly that. To be honest it sounded alike a kid parroting her parents.
807021810852036608 2016-12-08 00:39:28 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime I'm not familiar with her at all. Just saw her once on DS show and went eh, ...Ive seen this before. Next.
807021499303374850 2016-12-08 00:38:13 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime Yet he's lived thru a unique set of circumstances. I bought  his book by the way. Months ago. Haven't had time to open it yet
807021218977067008 2016-12-08 00:37:06 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime And why all the yelling? I guess that's her style? She just appeared woefully ignorant and talking parrot like.
807020887627087872 2016-12-08 00:35:47 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime She reminded me of a lot of twenty years olds who think they know everything, & are mouthy, and don't know crap. Plus a bigot
807020325988745216 2016-12-08 00:33:34 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime Oh I see, so ther's been a whole thing going on. Ok I'll read the Time's article...

807014485378547712 2016-12-08 00:10:21 UTC <catteadams> @rodimusprime I really didn't. Yeah, he's got a consistnt messge & he stays on task. but it is a way 2 be open to change, 2 listen. Not easy
807011663933161472 2016-12-08 23:59:08 UTC <catteadams> @speechboy71 Good thing he said it after election. He has no idea what a steel worker does. Dangerous, hard, back breaking job. What a creep

806418355171135488 2016-12-07 08:41:33 UTC <catteadams> @namirari Clothing never made me feel empowered. Self pride for caring about myself, yes. Always dressed in a classic style. Safer? Never.

805530534210215936 2016-12-04 21:53:40 UTC <catteadams> I assumed as much. The casualness of the smug comment was more disturbing than the outfit tho, if that could be possible.
805522852153692160 2016-12-04 21:23:08 UTC <catteadams> This thread. A must read. Clarity, is like bread to a starving man/woman/child right now.https://twitter.com/daniellemuscato/status/805302250159689728

805327609089245185 2016-12-04 08:27:18 UTC <catteadams> @LRBitisnot @emm_fee my big fear. He is truly demented in his beliefs.
805321257650528256 2016-12-04 08:02:04 UTC <catteadams> @Trump @LRBitisnot forget moral imperative. No one is holding him accountable in that department
805318080612237316 2016-12-03 07:49:27 UTC <catteadams> @LRBitisnot I have a feeling Pence has his ducks in a row. Would be good to c Trump go down in a ball of shame.
805317659487154176 2016-12-03 07:47:46 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @LRBitisnot My very real question is, who will demand, force this hand, and what if he doesn't comply?

789004581258661893 2016-10-20 07:25:25 UTC <catteadams> @tonyschwartz I almost dropped my cocktail when she said choked.  Trump bait all day long. Oh, and, #fishedInAgain  So damn easy.
789003928360804352 2016-10-20 07:22:50 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump THAT has to be a quote, because you certainly don't know that word. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
789003659858227200 2016-10-20 07:21:46 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump You DO know  throwing around the words "BIG LEAGUE" makes you sound like a cheap huckster don't you? Google huckster.
789003158970245120 2016-10-20 07:19:46 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump "Big League" is a catch phrase not a plan. When you talk like this you sound like a moron. Carry on, dum dum.
789002699622625280 2016-10-20 07:17:57 UTC <catteadams> You have more lame catch phrases than a crap sitcom. Not EVERYTHING should be a catch phrase you know? PS. You didn't deserve the Emmy, fool
789001479424061440 2016-10-20 07:13:06 UTC <catteadams> @FrankConniff No civility at the buffet.  OK. Fair is fair.

788944110446968836 2016-10-19 03:25:08 UTC <catteadams> From now on, I'm calling my microphone, "the sniffer picker upper". U know It had to be said.

788929446774382593 2016-10-19 02:26:52 UTC <catteadams> Ummmm...what is less than ZERO?
788929356693245952 2016-10-19 02:26:30 UTC <catteadams> @Kris_Sacrebleu @robynsussel Is there anything worse than a bad sport? really awful 2 see in a grown man with such tiny hands be a bad sport
788928900562690049 2016-10-19 02:24:42 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @VeepHBO @OfficialJLD But if they are.....Yay.

788928228995895297 2016-10-19 02:22:02 UTC <catteadams> Another Disaster! bottoms up everybody!  Maybe it's time to change the drinking word. Oy
788927554119839744 2016-10-19 02:19:21 UTC <catteadams> My god, he sounds just like a guy in a bar, you want to move away from.

788926343329177600 2016-10-19 02:14:32 UTC <catteadams> Beginning to hear real frustration and weariness in Chris's voice. I wouldn't want his gig tonight. & He's doing a great job.
788924392826818560 2016-10-19 02:06:47 UTC <catteadams> Look at us were laughing and yelling.
788922336674058240 2016-10-19 01:58:37 UTC <catteadams> I don't know about you, but the whispering by Trump sounds creepier than the yelling.
788921363448799232 2016-10-19 01:54:45 UTC <catteadams> OMG. This is getting WEIRD.
788920725704814593 2016-10-19 01:52:13 UTC <catteadams> WOW. Your 30 years. My 30 years.

788918224054132736 2016-10-19 01:42:16 UTC <catteadams> Oh my god, "I got NATO to pay up" Did I just hear that?
788917321431519232 2016-10-19 01:38:41 UTC <catteadams> @pattonoswalt When it comes to "defending your life" he's only using 11 % of his brain.
788916456888999938 2016-10-19 01:35:15 UTC <catteadams> Here's the rope a dope.
788916181159649282 2016-10-19 01:34:09 UTC <catteadams> I see a shimmy coming on.
788915687905341440 2016-10-19 01:32:11 UTC <catteadams> Here comes the rigged sniffing.
788915577540620288 2016-10-19 01:31:45 UTC <catteadams> Like him or not, Trump has smug down COLD. It's just the natural resting place.
788914262454308865 2016-10-19 01:26:32 UTC <catteadams> Very much better ideas. ~ Trump
788913875143892993 2016-10-19 01:24:59 UTC <catteadams> Some bad hombre's. Holy crap. He's speaking spanglish.
788913437678051329 2016-10-19 01:23:15 UTC <catteadams> @PaulProvenza And holsters for their huggies.
788913109729628160 2016-10-19 01:21:57 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley The tweensy eyes, the tweensy hands.
788910901491445761 2016-10-19 01:13:10 UTC <catteadams> It's gotta be tough when your face has a permanent smug look on it. Even at rest. #AwwwwTrumpy
788910018997346305 2016-10-19 01:09:40 UTC <catteadams> Brilliant, 60 seconds, already whining.
788909798653698048 2016-10-19 01:08:47 UTC <catteadams> @emmykn @emmafreud Excellent orange fade on Trump.
788909535943503872 2016-10-19 01:07:45 UTC <catteadams> Check your rigged microphone, Trump.
788909009365377024 2016-10-19 01:05:39 UTC <catteadams> Here we go.....Oy.
788908662261624832 2016-10-19 01:04:16 UTC <catteadams> @varepall His choices look so very desperate. I wonder, gig anyone say, Ummm ...ya know....this list here....not such a good idea?
788908154062897153 2016-10-19 01:02:15 UTC <catteadams> @NYgrooveX Not to worry, she'll find a way to get her "I want more fame" face in front of plenty of media. I just hopes she speaks. LOLLOL
788907390305349632 2016-10-19 00:59:13 UTC <catteadams> @SimonMaloy Yeah, closing the circle of cray cray. I'll take Paul Lynde to block.
788904057838592000 2016-10-19 00:45:59 UTC <catteadams> @emmykn Scott Baio stopped being relevant the same time he started acting. If you could call what he did, acting. #Next
788878015404974080 2016-10-19 23:02:30 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX What astonishes me is the economy. Do they not read? He bankrupts businesses, not grow them. I'll never get that disconnect.
788872245682642944 2016-10-19 22:39:34 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan This underscores the word ironic. Look what YOU allowed to happen. TRUMP. Kinda late to be our preachy/savior don't you think?
788607156685770757 2016-10-18 05:06:12 UTC <catteadams> @DivineMsEva Yeah, in fact, I got so much exercise doing it, I no longer need glasses. Silver Lining? AH Ha ha ha ha ha ah ha hahaa

787853916356562944 2016-10-16 03:13:05 UTC <catteadams> @Adrian_Benepe The Trump they created, and allowed 2 go forth with impunity,  is the biggest scorch and burn scenario in GOP history.
787852025711120384 2016-10-16 03:05:35 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan You should be able to pick a Rep. with some dignity left, too. When will you jump Trumps sinking ship? #walkAway #DontLookBack

787537612554645504 2016-10-15 06:16:13 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley It's so intertwined in their denial, and ingrained in their behavior. They think they either have carte blanche, or dont care.
787537010219032576 2016-10-15 06:13:49 UTC <catteadams> @TomArnold When Asange says he HATES Hillary & will do anything 2 prevent her from winning, I believe him, but the BS he "creates"? Ah, no.

786711910980911104 2016-10-13 23:35:10 UTC <catteadams> I can't wait for the stupid ppl to crawl back into their caves and pray they don't come back out in 4 years. Jeasas
786711081578295296 2016-10-13 23:31:52 UTC <catteadams> @HuffPostPol @sinbadbad This is insanity leaping off a cliff into total hyperbolic magical thinking. Good. Lord

785985812827484160 2016-10-11 23:29:55 UTC <catteadams> @HillaryClinton Cogent argument here, a way to address it. It should be brought up again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiPjWUn-PUo

785976658486448128 2016-10-11 22:53:32 UTC <catteadams> @VABVOX Imagine that.  Pence pretending to take a high road.  Remarkable. It must be awful 4 Pence dealing with deplorables Trump created.
785975874948444161 2016-10-11 22:50:25 UTC <catteadams> @AndyRichter Oh, I hope William Hung competes again!   A girl can dream can't she? I just know he has a collection of red sweaters.

785964366449344512 2016-10-11 22:04:42 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Possibly. but you NEED to stop supporting the GOP nominee and state it so you don't ruin the whole ticket. Surely you KNOW this
785963712284794880 2016-10-11 22:02:06 UTC <catteadams> @ElectSmucker @PRyan Then WHY in God's name are you still supporting the GOP nominee? Get real. We are so sick of this crap. GET a spine.
785963404380909568 2016-10-11 22:00:52 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Oh THAT is rich. So, does that mean you're willing to be held accountable for letting Trump ruin the GOP? Supporting the nom.?

785745377144086528 2016-10-11 07:34:31 UTC <catteadams> @tobyharnden @janetreitman BOOM! And, it's a hideous expression, vulgar. Ask women, do you like being talked about like that? Ah, NO.
785743621941190656 2016-10-11 07:27:32 UTC <catteadams> @MyDaughtersArmy @allanbrauer @realDonaldTrump Good thing it didn't sound like he was reading from a TelePrompTer.  #loser
785718107142705157 2016-10-10 05:46:09 UTC <catteadams> @AndyKindler Thank God for Andy Kindler! We can laugh again.
785599759113261056 2016-10-10 21:55:52 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Maybe you should tell YOUR NOMINEE this.
785597151866781696 2016-10-10 21:45:31 UTC <catteadams> @cher That is beyond vulgar.
785590339427971072 2016-10-10 21:18:27 UTC <catteadams> @JosephKahn You old poet, you. Ha ha ha ha ha.
785588875074740224 2016-10-10 21:12:38 UTC <catteadams> @LOLGOP I guess he'll be proud to fall with him then. And to slink away never to be heard from again. Career death = choices you made. DOH!
785570343054225408 2016-10-10 19:58:59 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan RT if you agree to oust all those REP's that enabled Trump 2 get this far. And continue to support this reprehensible nominee.
785410491120168961 2016-10-10 09:23:47 UTC <catteadams> @DivineMsEva @BrunoAmato_1 And he's made a nice living cheating & refusing to pay regular people, who just wanted to be paid for their work.
785409814268477440 2016-10-10 09:21:06 UTC <catteadams> @CNN @DivineMsEva @schreiber_jason Whoa. That happened? Astonishing arrogance. Ask any woman if SHE cares. Then remember how many vote.
785408988707827712 2016-10-10 09:17:49 UTC <catteadams> Make no mistake, what we saw tonight was "rope a dope" at it's finest. It pays to remember a little history. Hillary mentioned Ali, and POW!
785399716754300928 2016-10-10 08:40:59 UTC <catteadams> @FrankConniff I heard it comes on right after "Fantasy Career with Donald Trump" He's gonna be a busy boy.
785366479038324736 2016-10-09 06:28:54 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence Oh you wish. Now THAT, was a disaster.
785324423255511040 2016-10-09 03:41:47 UTC <catteadams> @damonbethea1 @MSignorile Creeped me out
785322793164427264 2016-10-09 03:35:19 UTC <catteadams> @damonbethea1 @emmaroller It boggles the mind, & makes me sick. Especially Ryan, who continues 2 B so divisive. Hows that working 4 ya Ryan?
785320562625093633 2016-10-09 03:26:27 UTC <catteadams> @kurteichenwald Nope. They don't. But when you hitch your wagon to a dead horse, all you have are high hopes.
785310634002952192 2016-10-09 02:47:00 UTC <catteadams> Saddest thing?  I'm gonna bet NO minds were changed. What a world.
785309794013896704 2016-10-09 02:43:39 UTC <catteadams> Yup.   Didn't help him, didn't hurt her.
785309141891887104 2016-10-09 02:41:04 UTC <catteadams> @rabiasquared I'd rather they evolve by new thoughts, ideas, and the loss of the fear, that has been inflamed by Trump. Anyone can change.
785306478366175232 2016-10-09 02:30:29 UTC <catteadams> Favorite words of the night....Very Beautifully Reviewed. Supreme court judges? Holy cow. What the hell is that language?
785300911459401729 2016-10-09 02:08:22 UTC <catteadams> I hear the "this debate was rigged" death knell, from Donald, already. Bueller?
785298091838611458 2016-10-09 01:57:09 UTC <catteadams> How much you wanna bet, that Trump goes back to canary yellow hair, and orange cheeto face, when he loses.
785297323676934144 2016-10-09 01:54:06 UTC <catteadams> Oh snap. The worm is gonna turn. In 5..4..3..2..1
785296657906753536 2016-10-09 01:51:28 UTC <catteadams> @AC360 THANK GOD. You both are not playing to the Donald razzle dazzle, BS. Asking the tough questions. FINALLY, 2 ppl, with some guts.
785295747696570368 2016-10-09 01:47:50 UTC <catteadams> Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. What kind of fuckery baby whining is this? Hillary sounds like an adult. donald sounds like a petulant child.
785294526894133248 2016-10-09 01:42:59 UTC <catteadams> That's a weird Trump twirling dance he's doing.  Ewwww.  And, his debate strategy, whatever that is, is dying like a drunk uncle joke.
785293372118269953 2016-10-09 01:38:24 UTC <catteadams> Finally Anderson Cooper got some BALLS. Best moderator yet.
785293203578556420 2016-10-09 01:37:44 UTC <catteadams> @DivineMsEva @BevReese Sadly no one told him how low to hold the mic. Remarkable. An easy fix.
785292474596024321 2016-10-09 01:34:50 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @kcnewhaven @NotesFromHeL BOOM! And as for the terminal sniffing, ah, are we gonna claim BAD MIC again? Sheeeit.
785292216235241472 2016-10-09 01:33:49 UTC <catteadams> @JoyAnnReid U just can't fight intelligence. He's gotten away with so much. Now hes mad because he can't have his way & dominate the convers
785291680207351809 2016-10-09 01:31:41 UTC <catteadams> OH MY FUCKING LORD....Can you say big baby? Jesus Palomino!
785291158045855744 2016-10-09 01:29:36 UTC <catteadams> @PaulProvenza I was thinking, Let's make a deal!
785290853245779968 2016-10-09 01:28:24 UTC <catteadams> @PaulProvenza Oh my GAWD. Funny
785290184329789441 2016-10-09 01:25:44 UTC <catteadams> Holy holy God, the sniffing is getting worse.
785290032592539648 2016-10-09 01:25:08 UTC <catteadams> This is beyond anything I can fathom.   And, Oh oh, he said IF I win. That's new.
785288321274486785 2016-10-09 01:18:20 UTC <catteadams> I'm calling bad sniffy mic, before Trump does.
785287298581540864 2016-10-09 01:14:16 UTC <catteadams> Holy SHIT. Anderson Cooper, KUDOS.

785270691486572544 2016-10-09 00:08:17 UTC <catteadams> This political stunt of Trumps just exploited and used these women. I am stunned they didnt see that. And the Donald just hit a new low. YUK
785264507656376320 2016-10-09 23:43:42 UTC <catteadams> Oh man, It's a bout to get down and dirty up in here. Trump meeting with Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assault accusers.  Trump @ his worst

780933543446798336 2016-09-27 00:54:00 UTC <catteadams> @LauraJSilverman Allow me 2 add one more. Trump moves to Russia, where they truly know how to make a good deal. We never hear from him again

778432755692474368 2016-09-20 03:16:46 UTC <catteadams> @damonbethea1 @AlanIAbramowitz Well stated. So tired of the crazy "look at me"  articles. Exactly where are the numbers to support this?

778277432654651392 2016-09-20 16:59:34 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump You didn't invent that either, dum dum. If you knew even a little history you would know that. Legions have done it B4 U.

778009542630055936 2016-09-19 23:15:04 UTC <catteadams> @drinksmcgee actually, I wasn't being negative, that's how you read it, cause that's who you are.
778009351910981632 2016-09-19 23:14:18 UTC <catteadams> @drinksmcgee Ok sarcasty pants. I'm sorry I wasted my time. Truly sorry. Trust me, I not ever write you again.
778008793770622976 2016-09-19 23:12:05 UTC <catteadams> @drinksmcgee Clearly you are mean spirited. So do us all a favor and keep your opinion to yourself.

778007467091374081 2016-09-19 23:06:49 UTC <catteadams> @drinksmcgee not liking is very different from not understanding. Scroll on, indeed.

777977686341787648 2016-09-19 21:08:29 UTC <catteadams> @sahilkapur @EatTheHat15 @jaydestro Yeah. He wants, he wants. He always wants. But what he needs, is to be a little more educated.
777977329238708225 2016-09-19 21:07:04 UTC <catteadams> @sahilkapur @Duck_person Agreed. U MAY get some choices, but when they show up they R NEVER what U really wanted. Try 2 send THAT back.
777976775729033216 2016-09-19 21:04:52 UTC <catteadams> @sahilkapur If that's how he feels, lets treat Trump that way about his upcoming court case. I believe it has something to do with rape.
777976307531468801 2016-09-19 21:03:00 UTC <catteadams> @damonbethea1 @CapehartJ Best news ever. Finally, some backbone. Perhaps temporary ratings aren't worth those who would drop off forever.

777622688055435264 2016-09-18 21:37:51 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan finally, a tweet that isn't us and them. You might get the hang of this if you apply it often.

777388416795234304 2016-09-17 06:06:56 UTC <catteadams> Does any1 know if Twitter rotates our tweets out again & again, or R ppl really reading & scrolling down, & commenting on months old tweets?

777365759223697408 2016-09-17 04:36:54 UTC <catteadams> @Rschooley You may even B overdue. But the real disconnect 4 me is ppl repeating Trumps bloviate like it's somehow truthful. I don't get it
777362693174927360 2016-09-17 04:24:43 UTC <catteadams> @SamHarrisOrg  So appreciate your waking up conversations. Because U go there, we get there. Thank you.

777324214122459136 2016-09-17 01:51:49 UTC <catteadams> @softballscifi  take away the attention & he'll do anything 2 get it back.

776903992525725696 2016-09-16 22:02:00 UTC <catteadams> @PRyan Some ppl never wake up. They just repeat what they know. Until they fade away....mumbling about how misunderstood they were. WAKE UP!
776903106143543296 2016-09-16 21:58:29 UTC <catteadams> @EricBoehlert I think it's the same self sabotage he has always done. It's the bad boy begging for attention, syndrome. He can't stop it.
776902035123736576 2016-09-16 21:54:13 UTC <catteadams> @PRyan You realize U R tweeting the same old DC politics of divide, divide, divide,  that got you Trump right? See? Dem bad Rep right. Tired

776899563168948230 2016-09-16 21:44:24 UTC <catteadams> @nbc @realDonaldTrump @jimmyfallon @AndyKindler That moment creeped me way the fuck out. Odd, uncomfortable, unfunny, moment. Must B me. ugh
776898727042617344 2016-09-16 21:41:05 UTC <catteadams> @realDonaldTrump @mken17 This statement is absurd on its face. I wont engage in this intellectual ignorance. This is the disconnect.
776688106850222080 2016-09-16 07:44:09 UTC <catteadams> Just ponder broadly, and beyond your own biases. It says a lot more than you might think. And don't pigeon hole me.https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/776452289116639232

776593628353273857 2016-09-15 01:28:44 UTC <catteadams> @GavinNewsom well my friend, sadly those who R voting 4 Trump, just don't care. There's no getting thru 2 them,& that's frustrating & sad
776528335077728256 2016-09-15 21:09:16 UTC <catteadams> @samsteinhp Policy changes like this R all good until T remembers he owns a business. "What have I done? let me take that back" he'd say.
776527548909957120 2016-09-15 21:06:09 UTC <catteadams> @ShariJoel Because she was white? Illegal 2 discriminate based on color. They'd B fired. She should have told somebody that

776142057949700096 2016-09-14 19:34:21 UTC <catteadams> @PRyan Lets start with holding U accountable 4 supporting Trump. Uhave a chance to resurrect your party. But U won't. How's that workin out?

759938451428945921 2016-07-31 02:27:00 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan No matter what good you do, it won't suffice for all the bad you are bringing in the form of DT. What the hell is wrong w/ U?
759938123111378944 2016-07-31 02:25:42 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Too late for moral high ground now. You already hitched your wagon to a sociopath, who is leaking like a bad canoe. Oh, it's on

759934569063718912 2016-07-31 02:11:34 UTC <catteadams> YUP. Ryan is morally bankrupt. There's a term DT is used to hearing. Maybe they deserve each other.https://twitter.com/ForQ2/status/759471541562159104
759934209850957824 2016-07-31 02:10:09 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan @emmykn Oh Ryan lost that long ago. He's out 4 himself. Trump is so unqualified, and Ryan like that. Then DT needs Ryan. #WeCU

759654415703748609 2016-07-31 07:38:21 UTC <catteadams> @shondarhimes This is a callous thing for Trump to say. He's going further and further off the rails 2 C if anyone will stop him. We will.

759512680596058112 2016-07-30 22:15:08 UTC <catteadams> @SpeakerRyan Except ppl of good conscience don't believe anything U say anymore. After supporting Trump, we never will. #RuinedGOPLegacy

758880547145785344 2016-07-28 04:23:16 UTC <catteadams> @JenKirkman Nothing worse than a pillow punching night on the road.   Maybe take solace in the fact that the food will be off the chain?

722602704162271233 2016-04-19 01:48:04 UTC <catteadams> @sarajeanpotato It certainly isn't. It's self preserving, and internal response to fear. We all have it, and plenty of it.
722602439073857536 2016-04-19 01:47:01 UTC <catteadams> @Green_Footballs I know that not funny, but it's kinda funny...well, it made me smile...and chuckle inside. So thank you for that.

722202684137144320 2016-04-18 23:18:32 UTC <catteadams> The worst part of any election year is the precise moment when all various and sundry become HUMORLESS. It's allllllllmost here.
