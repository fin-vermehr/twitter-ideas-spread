971915570663735296 2018-03-08 01:08:24 UTC <dguaraglia> @LevineJonathan This is the ultimate "why you should vote me out of office as soon as you are old enough to vote" justification.

How about you need to get out of your media bubble? https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-sign-bill-revoking-obama-era-gun-checks-people-mental-illnesses/ Did you know the White House refused to release pictures of him signing that after the Florida shooting? Sure you don't get that in Fox News.

You wonder how the same organization that wants "stricter background checks" is the same this successfully lobbied Trump to allow people with a history of mental issues to buy guns? Follow the money. Talk is cheap, but lobbying pays the bills.
971777514291916800 2018-03-08 15:59:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @ABC @drsmith619 @TheyCallMe_Dani Even the Heller decision states that while the second amendment gives us the right to possess arms, such right is not absolute and should be regulated. Guns aren't the problem, but millions of people who shouldn't have access to them owning them is.

971047720025702400 2018-03-06 15:39:52 UTC <dguaraglia> @TheNickGeller Let's use some "conservative" logic: your AR-15 is weird, it disgusts me, it's a clear sign of mental illness, and we'll ban it from entering any places with children.
971046376183250944 2018-03-06 15:34:31 UTC <dguaraglia> @NRATV Man, that "slippery slope" certainly is a common place with conservative types. It's a really easy tactic to deploy when you have nothing intelligent to say: "but... if we start small, we'll end up big!"
971045034614169600 2018-03-06 15:29:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @TomiLahren @FoxNews I lived in "shithole countries" the majority of my life. I've never needed a gun, not a single time.

971041774788423680 2018-03-06 15:16:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @benshapiro Here we go again. When something doesn't conform with conservative narrative then it's either a deep state conspiracy, crazy talk or a witch hunt. Guys, start dealing with reality, what you are doing is not healthy.

Who the fuck gave you that power? You are just another Super PAC milking gullible conservatives to push private interests.

968985510919118848 2018-02-28 23:05:23 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio First person shooters are played the world over. Only the US has a mass-shooting problem. Again, you are just repeating Fox News talking points. For a "freedom lover" you certainly love being told what to say.
968977129491775488 2018-02-28 22:32:05 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio Ah, yeah, there goes another Fox News talking point: blaming the police. When it's black people getting shot, you guys trample each other to jump on the "blue lives matter" bandwagon. But now the police sucks. It's almost like you just parrot what you are told.
968931449117159424 2018-02-28 19:30:34 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio What the fuck does whatever you do inside if your home have to do with what a 19 year old with a semi-automatic rifle he shouldn't possess does in a school? Is that your way to say you give up on having to think for yourself?
968909356237406208 2018-02-28 18:02:46 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio But wait a minute, I thought the argument about having all these guns was self-defense? Are you saying you both *don't need the guns* but also *really, really need them*? Or maybe you are just brainwashed by the NRA? (The latter is most likely, really.)
968909021028663296 2018-02-28 18:01:26 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio As much as I hate Trump, I realize that taking arms against the government *with the best armed forces in the world* is a ridiculous scenario to bring up. Besides, there's a chasm between common-sense gun laws and not having guns at all. Educate yourself:http://for.tn/2oniUDV

968900325594689538 2018-02-28 17:26:53 UTC <dguaraglia> @GavinNewsom @verbalhamradio This argument is so ridiculous, it's beyond belief that Americans actually believe it. Just take a look at the world around you. No other country has the level of gun violence we do, *not even close*. Australia solved their problem in the 80s. But somehow "Murca" can't do it.

968043497876963328 2018-02-26 08:42:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @shawnsteel1 Holy shit, you can't just make up your own reality guys. Seriously, the Trump reality-distortion field is so strong, most of you sound like lunatics nowadays. Get a grip.
967922959632367616 2018-02-25 00:43:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @1IronMan2018 As someone who mostly agrees with Feinstein: what makes you think her position is for life? What makes you think another candidate would lose to a Republican? This line sounds like an empty tack to split the Democratic base.

967184707388493824 2018-02-23 23:49:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @IngrahamAngle How "adults" like Laura Ingraham talk about teens: "OMG they so mean!!! I'm gonna tell my Twitter followers see if they'll defend us! I'm so triggered right now! MOM!!!"

966864926458372097 2018-02-22 02:38:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump I'm used to dumb tweets but this one takes the cake. You assholes passed a bill that removes teachers' tiny exemptions on school materials, but now will fund this? Sure.

966570054908182528 2018-02-21 07:07:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @DLoesch @NRA @ShannonEdwardsL @katneosen Let's solve the problem by throwing more guns at it. That surely will fix it in a jiffy! - GOP, delivering simplistic solution to complex problems since Reaganomics.
966525975625265153 2018-02-21 04:12:04 UTC <dguaraglia> @PreetBharara I think it has to do with not falling for the whole we cant look biased idea, which anyway only honest journalists fall for (you dont see Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity worried about looking biased.)
966525247791931393 2018-02-21 04:09:10 UTC <dguaraglia> @DustinGiebel The problem with Loesch is that you cant go around blaming everything and everyone for the problems created by NRA-backed politicians and them expect to be applauded when you correctly point out a single problem.
966523871028396032 2018-02-21 04:03:42 UTC <dguaraglia> @toddstarnes If the senator in question doesnt have the answers and resorts to talking points, Id applaud them. Enough with the authoritarian shit. These people are our employees, not the other way around.
966523382605930497 2018-02-21 04:01:46 UTC <dguaraglia> @DLoesch @jason_howerton Maybe because shes a piece of work otherwise. A broken clock might be right twice a day, but doesnt mean its working. Her videos are essentially Yall Qaeda recruiting clips.
966474649570770949 2018-02-21 00:48:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ The plans are totally workable. Just look around the world. School shootings with semi-automatic weapons are an almost exclusive American problem.
966474453025570816 2018-02-21 00:47:20 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ And you haven't demonstrated that limiting magazine capacity would reduce deaths. If anything, you have proven that - unlike any other country - we have insane gun policies that supposedly would help in a tiny fraction of cases. Again, do we need anti-aerial batteries?
966434009386442753 2018-02-21 22:06:37 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ Sure, but that's the problem, right? One can always imagine an extreme situation with 0 chances of happening. Should we let kids to continue dying just in case? Should we put anti-aerial batteries on top of every building because of 9/11?
966402929107222528 2018-02-21 20:03:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ So your argument is she wouldn't have run out of ammunition if she had 30 bullets. 6 bullets it's too little. Maybe they would've left after the 29th bullet was fired...
966402467368919040 2018-02-21 20:01:17 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ I'll do that when you demonstrate that more bullets =  more security. So far, you've only argued that without any proof. If we are talking about unknowables, at least mine has plenty of evidence the world over, yours doesn't.
966402229098835968 2018-02-21 20:00:20 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ You didn't link to a single piece of news about them. I'm not doubting you, but...
966401990220693504 2018-02-21 19:59:24 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ Again, you are saying that like "multiple assailants" mean they'll keep coming in after the first one gets shot. That's not how reality works, this is not a zombie apocalypse or a first-person shooter game.
966401693435834368 2018-02-21 19:58:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @RJCHVZ @jypbo1 Huh? Where did I say that?
966378939978473472 2018-02-21 18:27:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ Again, so far I've only got your word for this. Links to articles?
966378825624907776 2018-02-21 18:27:21 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ *Or* he could've changed magazines. This is the first one I *kinda* believe might be valid. Care to link?
966374854738915328 2018-02-21 18:11:34 UTC <dguaraglia> @PhiPhiOhara @Rattwalk ROFL, "bot" are all the people repeating the talking points they get from Fox News. Exhibit A: you.
966373851067072512 2018-02-21 18:07:35 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ No shots were "exchanged" here, just a bunch of assholes entering a house then leaving. You think they would've continued pushing through had they been shot at twice?
966373484124241921 2018-02-21 18:06:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ So, 6 rounds did the trick. Why would you say having more bullets would have stopped two robbers? Do you think robbers just storm a place like people playing Counter-Strike? The moment they start getting shot at, they would get to cover and most likely run away.
966373153789247488 2018-02-21 18:04:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ I'll change my mind given enough evidence. I'm not a Fox News bot repeating propaganda. *Those* are the ones you should be worried about.
966360793506709504 2018-02-21 17:15:41 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ Really? Plenty of examples? Please list them. List 3 and I might change my mind. List 10 and I'll personally go buy a high-capacity magazine.
966360430548430848 2018-02-21 17:14:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @PhiPhiOhara @Rattwalk Who pays them? The same people that said that allowing a tax exemption on school material was too much of a give away to teachers? Looks like we are OK with wasting money as long as it goes straight into the military-industrial pockets, huh?
966351305936551936 2018-02-21 16:37:59 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ I hear this argument all the time, and it's dumb. How many times have you heard of fire fights where 10 or more rounds were exchanged? Never, because real life is not an action movie. Stop fetishizing a heroic Rambo scenario.
966349365609508864 2018-02-21 16:30:17 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @Mystalope @jypbo1 @RJCHVZ I do own firearms. I use them (rarely nowadays) for hunting, so I don't need to shoot 30 bullets in under a minute. BTW, "high capacity" is defined as 10 or more bullets by most of the bans. It's perfectly reasonable, even for self-defense.  People fetishize guns. It's unhealthy.
966338773901438976 2018-02-21 15:48:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @maxwellstrachan @RJCHVZ @Mystalope @WyllomyGreene @jypbo1 Ah, yeah, abortion justifies everything else. I forgot that's both enshrined in the Bible and the Constitution.

Also, one can be converted to something almost like an automatic with a bumper stock, the other one not so much. It's almost like you just repeat talking points but know nothing about the subject.
966336481349398528 2018-02-21 15:39:05 UTC <dguaraglia> @PhiPhiOhara @Rattwalk Do you have any idea how much money a teacher makes? Even if they did had them, they wouldn't be trained for war-like scenarios. It'd also create a massive insurance liability for the school. "Teachers with guns" is just another GOP simplistic "solution".

966209609231986688 2018-02-20 07:14:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @XVGClownFish @igorvolsky @VergeArmyXVG "Gun free zones" seem to work the world over. Only in America they are magically a bad idea. The US is not that exceptional, we just have an exceptionally corrupt Congress that is bought and sold by the NRA.
966209048637997057 2018-02-20 07:12:43 UTC <dguaraglia> @kurteichenwald They are also the same that vote to remove tax exemptions on school materials, but now tells us we should arm them and train them. A gun costs hundreds of dollars, training would cost even more. Tax exemptions cost nothing.  Republicans just lie.
966207772256817154 2018-02-20 07:07:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @CNN Quick! Need to start demonizing them soon, otherwise the NRA will feel threatened!

They have five full hours of undiluted pro-Trump propaganda each day (Fox and Friends, Hannity and Carlson). While Obama was in office, they manufactured "scandals" every week: the tan suit, the "terrorist" fistjab, grey poupon! So balanced!
963927747713155073 2018-02-14 00:07:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @PasteMagazine @danpfeiffer @_Zeets The worst part about this is outlets like NYT and WaPo seem to be under the impression that if they get enough right-winger writers, they'll gain a demographic. They won't. The right won't give up having an "enemy" that easily.
963927098371981313 2018-02-14 00:05:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @PressSec @oufenix @PatCunnane Oh, but you are assuming they give a shit. That's the problem.
963911122356023296 2018-02-14 23:01:34 UTC <dguaraglia> Saw kids on a school trip. Their teacher kept telling them "no phones out unless you are taking pictures". I thought to myself "what's the point?". Then I saw the news and realized she was protecting from the fucked up reality we live in. @NRA #Parkland #ProfitOverLives
963864389047656448 2018-02-14 19:55:52 UTC <dguaraglia> @llanga That's interesting, but it'd be more helpful if we had an actual scale right next to the chart. Did this reduce average CPU usage, or just the volatility?

960649295971020800 2018-02-05 23:00:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @imau2fan Well, @danpfeiffer said that *presidents* shouldn't claim they control the market. You say we should tell this guy, so he *must be the president*. Otherwise, you are just blaming Obama for what some random pundit said, which I'm sure was *never* your intention! Right?

960208764073725952 2018-02-04 17:49:43 UTC <dguaraglia> @adamcurry Or maybe Ill just move on and stop listening to people trying to sell their narrative as non-partisan. Probably healthier in the long term anyway. A shame, the old show was fun.

959869726401863681 2018-02-03 19:22:30 UTC <dguaraglia> @adamcurry I wasn't being a douche, just pointing that the show seems to have taken a very - ahem - "non controversial" position lately.

956749421080846336 2018-01-25 04:43:32 UTC <dguaraglia> @ellievhall @jenniferinc @justindsweeney @rachaelMIDGET @jeshrnndz Probably the same reason they do it in a bunch of places in the US: to avoid a "trial by media", which is why sometimes you see the news show drawings of the courtroom. It kind of makes sense, to an extent.
956738907189657601 2018-01-25 04:01:45 UTC <dguaraglia> @solaris_sunstar Funny, I wonder how you'd react if - the moment Latinos become a majority in this country - some dimwitted Twitter account said "I don't hate whites or anything, I just want this country to be based on Latino interests."

956555445568548864 2018-01-25 15:52:44 UTC <dguaraglia> @meat So that means it should work for me? Excellent! (I match at least two of those categories, possibly all three)
956315336025845761 2018-01-24 23:58:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @Evan_McMullin He's probably still "drafting" it (as in: he's still trying to find something to put in it that would actually pass even the slightest smell test.) @DevinNunes *needs to go*.

955869940728254464 2018-01-23 18:28:47 UTC <dguaraglia> @RealAlexJones The good ole propaganda machine in motion: release to the most gullible sector of the population (InfoWars audience), let them create some "groundswell" noise on Twitter, then launder it through Fox News for the rest of the Republican voters.

Also, why do you think people in other prosperous countries would be motivated to move here, seeing the country is becoming a banana republic?
951849027036856322 2018-01-12 16:11:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants Hell, by Kellyannes logic, now shithole is a presidential term.
951848793678397440 2018-01-12 16:10:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @TomiLahren Would you call Kentucky, Missouri or Luisana shithole states? I want to hear you use the same logic on the poorest American states.

951216037210423296 2018-01-10 22:15:50 UTC <dguaraglia> @NPR When you can't cry "fake news" you have to cry "meanie MSM trying to shame me". Accountability only applies to plebes.

950623059932733440 2018-01-08 06:59:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Cheers to that. Have a nice one!
950622964470366208 2018-01-08 06:59:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Imagine 9/11 lasted 300 years - for a small group of people - while everyone else was allowed to build generational wealth (owning a house, getting one of the kids to study a profession, moving to a better state...) Then tell those people "well, fuck you, 9/11 is over now".
950622474571472896 2018-01-08 06:57:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Uff.. well, I guess I really only have so much time for this. I'd totally share a beer and discuss this in person, but Twitter format is definitely not the way to go about it. Just believe me: we on the other side don't want to take your money and run with it.
950621637195395072 2018-01-08 06:53:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Imagine if I told you this: "I refuse to pay taxes to pay for 9/11 first responders treatment because my I wasn't in the country at the time and my family didn't have anything to do with it". How do you feel about that?
950621344344899586 2018-01-08 06:52:44 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Again, you are ignoring that the group that supposedly is so "special" got shat on for hundreds of years. This is not about *you* being directly guilty of racism, this is about *the country* having fucked their grandparents over.
950620964726779904 2018-01-08 06:51:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA I very highly doubt that when white people apply they get rejected based on skin color either. So what's your point?
950620747159945216 2018-01-08 06:50:22 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA While white people keep getting told how bad they have it compared to X, they won't pay attention to who really is giving them the shitty deal. News Alert: that tax bill was another pallet full of shit on the pile.
950620089677529088 2018-01-08 06:47:45 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Everyone gets the shit end of the stick, but you don't hear that from Fox News or Breitbart, do you? All I keep seeing is "black people are entitled" or "we need to kick out immigrants" or "women should shut up." There's a reason they pitch poor people against other poor people.
950619518165897216 2018-01-08 06:45:29 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Indeed, but because Americans are majorly white, and because poverty doesn't discriminate, they are majorly spent on white people. Look at this chart next time you feel "black people get free shit and we get nothing":https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-enrollment-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D
950619082793009153 2018-01-08 06:43:45 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Man, I feel you. The problem with the term "white privilege" is that a lot of people use it to mean something it doesn't mean. It doesn't mean "white people get free shit". It means "sometimes being black gets you an even shittier deal". That's not their fault, or yours.
950618688327053312 2018-01-08 06:42:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA You say that like those white people aren't getting handouts. What do you think CHIPS, Medicaid, etc. are?
950618055662383104 2018-01-08 06:39:40 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Me? Oh boy, I earned everything I own by working. Kind of interesting you'd assume I didn't, just because I can see through the Fox News fog of bullshit. Having grown up in a developing country gives me super powers, I guess.
950617620956422145 2018-01-08 06:37:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Even better: if everyone can grow weed in their home, then there's no reason to bother with illegal weed. Win-win-win situation.
950617455600181248 2018-01-08 06:37:17 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Having benefitted from several generations building wealth surely has to count for something? Again, if that's not the case, then let's do 100% estate tax and be done with it.
950617181087088640 2018-01-08 06:36:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Ahhh! Good ole neoliberal multiculturalism: "there are some rich black people, therefore there's no discrimination!"  Never mind that with a 16%  black population, there are 3 African American billionaires, while there are 547 white billionaires. Totally the same!
950616076940800001 2018-01-08 06:31:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Common sense would be making sure marijuana is legalized at the Federal level, so cartels can't make money out of it. Prohibition didn't work for alcohol, why do you think it'll work for weed?
950615783310151680 2018-01-08 06:30:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA That's great, we should make sure none of their kids get any money out of it. Same for any rich white folk too. After all, why should kids get money for "shit that didn't happen to them". Let them work just like us normal people!
950615376928190464 2018-01-08 06:29:02 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA The difference is you don't see me making big assumptions about it and calling you fool for not accepting them.
950615180261519360 2018-01-08 06:28:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA So you are saying that generational wealth is not a thing? Then we should pass an estate tax of 100% and be done with it. Would solve the public debt in a jiffy.
950614719307563008 2018-01-08 06:26:25 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Can you prove that? No? Then maybe you shouldn't be so assertive about it.
950614254238932993 2018-01-08 06:24:34 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Slipping into qualifier territory once you realize your generalizations all of a sudden include you? Why am I not surprised...
950614058822131712 2018-01-08 06:23:47 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA By your logic: white people are not the only ones affected by Affirmative Action policies, so they should just shut the fuck up about it.
950613625147805696 2018-01-08 06:22:04 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Not in legal states. Maybe you use your favorite prescription and educate yourself on certain matters.
950613454011772928 2018-01-08 06:21:23 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA News Alert: alcohol is a drug. Whether it's legal or not, it's neither here nor there according to your sweeping statement that "all drug users are losers".

950612787155185666 2018-01-08 06:18:44 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA I am absolutely sure neither you or anyone in your family drinks at all.
950612650240614401 2018-01-08 06:18:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA I'm all for giving them reparations, as long as all people affected by slavery are given reparations. I'm sure you, who claim not to be a bigot, would agree to that?
950611681138294784 2018-01-08 06:14:20 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Do they? Have you ever actually seen anyone defending them? Please point me to that.
950611331920543744 2018-01-08 06:12:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Nobody is forgetting them. The only ones willing to erase their memory are the idiots that can't get over the fact the Confederacy lost that war 150 years ago.
950610921474244608 2018-01-08 06:11:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA Cool, remember to start screaming that to the screen next time Trump talks about the "opioid epidemic". After all, white people doing heroin is no different from black people smoking pot, am I right?
950610558994210817 2018-01-08 06:09:53 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA Wow, that's probably the stupidest thing I've seen all day, and you keep topping yourself. Do you truly expect the Jewish people to go to Egypt for reparations? Or the Irish suing... themselves, I guess? It's almost like you never actually thought this shit through.
950608306363510784 2018-01-08 06:00:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @mollycrabapple @StarScreamUSA You do realize you are an accident away from being a slave of the system like these people, right? Or you think they put drunk drivers or pot smokers in special "nice" prisons?
950607594762076161 2018-01-08 05:58:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @JacquiZebra @BeGoodMike I understand, but hypocrisy cuts both ways. That's the problem with the current divide in this country: lots of people finding fault in the "other side" without acknowledging equivalent behavior on theirs. Everyone is guilty of that, even myself.
950607053600432128 2018-01-08 05:55:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @StarScreamUSA White folks have: 300 hundred years of not being slaves, not being targeted by Jim Crow laws, not being unfairly targeted by police, being given land-grant universities and free land while freed slaves were told to "bootstrap". But keep crying, it makes you look really mature.

950601177627963393 2018-01-08 05:32:36 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @JacquiZebra @BeGoodMike Modern Republican hypocrisy: defending Damore's "right to free speech", while getting their panties in a bunch because Kaepernick kneels against police brutality.
950599176689106945 2018-01-08 05:24:39 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @NFLMcHollington As someone who actually works in the field: Damore's manifesto was at best scientifically flawed, at worst a ploy to get fired and play victim. Notice how the lawsuit provides 0 solid proof of discriminating policies. This is a fishing expedition hoping for a settlement.

950468333542887425 2018-01-08 20:44:44 UTC <dguaraglia> @BenHowe You say that, but I see a full 35% of the population who is convinced that the country's economy CRATERED under Obama and that Trump is generating "way more jobs" than Obama, even though it's objectively not true. Go figure.

Are you telling me someone with a hangover manning heavy machinery is less dangerous than someone who smoked pot the night before? Bullshit. CO traffic accidents in 2017 are the same as 2005, so pot use seems to be neither here nor there.

You aren't for free speech, you just want to claim victimhood. Why don't you focus your crusading on the very real attacks on the free press and free speech by @realDonaldTrump? (Which actually fit the law's definition.)
940367454168956928 2017-12-11 23:47:26 UTC <dguaraglia> @stopFundingHat @slpng_giants Well, this person is just "sea-lioning", a term that I have found to perfectly describe this practice:http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning
940367122365952000 2017-12-11 23:46:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants @stopFundingHat No, I'm just making fun of your hilariously biased view on "freedom of speech". You want to claim that only *your* freedom of speech is worthy of protection. You also keep talking about "free speech rights", even though they don't apply in this case. Educate yourself.
940357567414333440 2017-12-11 23:08:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants @stopFundingHat So what you are saying is that speech should be free *as long as you agree with it*, because disagreement with your point of view is automatically oppression. Seems like you have a very partial understanding of what "freedom of speech" means.
940357111766061057 2017-12-11 23:06:21 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants @stopFundingHat So what you are claiming is that *someone else's freedom of speech* should be restricted, instead of yours. Interesting thought process.

917801540559134720 2017-10-10 17:18:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @JeffLovepugs Fair enough. When stuff like this pops up we need a stronger reaction from everyone. Politicizing it only gives one's "team" a free pass.
917799378106015746 2017-10-10 17:09:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @JeffLovepugs You were saying they didn't comment, now you are moving goalposts? Fox News anchors should be even *more* responsible than comedians.

917795644525338624 2017-10-10 16:55:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @acbenge @JeffLovepugs Ten days ago, the right-wing told us "comedians should stick to comedy". Now they are supposed to represent all liberals? Which one is it?
917793625114734593 2017-10-10 16:47:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @acbenge @JeffLovepugs Surely you kid? "Leftist media" has been covering this 24/7. The right-wing (incl. Trump) defended Ailes. You bought the propaganda, bud.
917788863174606849 2017-10-10 16:28:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @acbenge @JeffLovepugs Roger Ailes got away with same shit (and covered others doing it) for decades. So what's your point? Stop trying to politicize this, bot.

917786358294372352 2017-10-10 16:18:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @SenSanders @SRuhle @vdutat @alimandri @ntelgen Add the price of health insurance (~10% or more, depending on income) and education to that, you are getting a bargain.
917785857603420160 2017-10-10 16:16:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @SenSanders @SRuhle @vdutat @alimandri @ntelgen That's why I specified "just income tax". I'm sure you are aware most states here have a sales tax (8% or more.) It's not that different.
917785440295428096 2017-10-10 16:14:35 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @acbenge @JeffLovepugs Your straw man is politicizing this. Sexual predators - of any political affiliation -should be in prison. At least liberals shun them.
917781801900302337 2017-10-10 16:00:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @acbenge @JeffLovepugs Some "liberals" silent = "all liberals are corrupt". Republicans electing a sexual predator = "you can't judge us!!!"  Hypocrisy much, bud?

917776747713634305 2017-10-10 15:40:02 UTC <dguaraglia> @SenSanders @SRuhle @vdutat @alimandri @ntelgen Really? I paid 27% taxes last year (just income tax). Did you pay 81%?
917669313808539650 2017-10-10 08:33:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @SenSanders @SRuhle @vdutat @ntelgen @alimandri Tax rates in the US, when including state taxes, are on the same ballpark as EU (~30% vs 35%). When your point is weak, you rather lie, huh?
917534815003353089 2017-10-09 23:38:41 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Well, he's spent *so much time* golfing since becoming president it's not a surprise.

915308365701570560 2017-10-03 20:11:34 UTC <dguaraglia> @benshapiro @EWErickson @JacobAWohl @brad_studio There's 89 guns per 100 people in America: shitty crime rates! Because there's no correlation.
915307914247598081 2017-10-03 20:09:47 UTC <dguaraglia> @benshapiro @EWErickson @JacobAWohl @brad_studio Gun control = communist, in the diseased alt-right mind. Anything *not* communist anymore? Pop tarts? COMMUNIST!
915280436686864384 2017-10-03 18:20:35 UTC <dguaraglia> @thedonaldreddit "Stop the hate" coming from r/The_Donald is the most ridiculous, self-pitying hypocrisy ever.
915280222064222208 2017-10-03 18:19:44 UTC <dguaraglia> @NRA @seanmdav @mrgoody_2_shoes The NRA stopped being that decades ago. It's just a propaganda arm for pro-gun lobbyists now.
915279490242142208 2017-10-03 18:16:50 UTC <dguaraglia> @benshapiro @EWErickson @JacobAWohl @brad_studio Stupidest graph ever, showing no correlation. Map homicide rates vs. gun ownership in countries with strict gun control, I dare you.
915249414167453696 2017-10-03 16:17:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @bryansafi "Ta-ching!" I've always found the prices at which these critters sell their souls to be so damn low. Where is Soros when we need him?
914926942863765504 2017-10-02 18:55:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants @broderick Scott Adams crossed the threshold into the magic "old white tool that lives in a fantasy world" during the Trump campaign.
914926071719456768 2017-10-02 18:52:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @HowardKurtz Yeah, man, better wait for a few more massacres before jumping to conclusions, right? For fuck's sake.
914500034418413568 2017-10-01 14:39:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @chrislhayes Yeah, sure, but there's more than 10 words so the average Cult45 follower won't even bother reading that much.
914289938857852928 2017-09-30 00:44:42 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich Base is not your cult, says one of the most faithful acolytes of Cult45.
914289415505301504 2017-09-30 00:42:37 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump He still lost. You still deleted your tweets supporting him. What kind of loser does that?
914242640224366592 2017-09-30 21:36:45 UTC <dguaraglia> @TWMocean @jonfavs @Coolish_Breeze OMG! You have unraveled the COMMUNIST PLOT!!! YOU SO CLEVER! CAN WE BE FRIENDS?

914220402125234176 2017-09-30 20:08:23 UTC <dguaraglia> @KrangTNelson Bill Maher is to liberals what Alex Jones is to conservatives. Just a flamewar instigator that embarrasses more people than he inspires.
914192628333400069 2017-09-30 18:18:02 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @jbro_1776 Says the guy with a big "Pepe" on his Twitter. Surely an unbiased observer.
914190349140152321 2017-09-30 18:08:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @MediaJuggernaut @m4gw "We will not be replaced by Jews", most likely.

912443395238502405 2017-09-25 22:27:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @marcorubio @jonlovett And lose his reputation as the largest invertebrate to get elected? Not worth it.
912440687907491840 2017-09-25 22:16:26 UTC <dguaraglia> @C_AdamskiTrib @AlayeniEQ You complain about people not paying him respect, but can't be bothered to read his words when they don't support your opinion. Nice.

912350118581501954 2017-09-25 16:16:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @AliVelshi You see, the skin colors were reversed at that point. Not saying Trump is racist, just saying there's always a coincidental correlation.
912175824652120065 2017-09-24 04:43:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @JoyAnnReid Jaaaaysus H, that was BRUTAL
912151580174159872 2017-09-24 03:07:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @sadengels That's a pretty good outcome, all things considered.
912150895240126465 2017-09-24 03:04:55 UTC <dguaraglia> @SInow We have a president that ran a campaign on saying America is shit. But a football player saying they are not happy? Unacceptable!
912149876804345858 2017-09-24 03:00:52 UTC <dguaraglia> @PearlJam You influenced my teenage years, you are still inspiring two decades later. #TakeTheKnee

912084368298070016 2017-09-24 22:40:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @peaceandjoy101 The reason you stand is because you fell for propaganda. You can love your country and still protest. Trumps claims to do it all the time.
912080076468097025 2017-09-24 22:23:30 UTC <dguaraglia> @jasoninthehouse I'm sure you can contact some people to get the inquest process started, right? There's a whole machinery setup for this.https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/912068592170078209
912074790005039104 2017-09-24 22:02:30 UTC <dguaraglia> @MisOdios Que raro el hecho de que te haga tanto ruido que escriban eso, no? Digo yo... capaz no te comas la galletita, pero araes el paquete?
912073092125601792 2017-09-24 21:55:45 UTC <dguaraglia> @barry Not all nerds. Most of us are just normal people. Assholes are assholes, no matter their profession.
912072875049390085 2017-09-24 21:54:53 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes Can we please stop giving airtime and pages to these people? They are a fringe minority and publicizing their tantrums only incites more.
912068227450187777 2017-09-24 21:36:25 UTC <dguaraglia> @pulsionparcial Que loco no? Es casi como si la Iglesia fuera un conjunto de individuos con opiniones diferentes. Si no, todos seran pedfilos?
912066892780773376 2017-09-24 21:31:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Most Anti-American shit I've read all day.
912065184507863040 2017-09-24 21:24:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @TomiLahren ... and nobody gives a shit. You realize you are defending a guy who called an American a "son of a bitch" for expressing his opinion?
912060271853744129 2017-09-24 21:04:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @Team_Trump45 You should probably rename your user to "Trumpbot" so it's clearer it's just a propaganda bot.
912058333867249667 2017-09-24 20:57:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @TomiLahren you have done more to popularize hatred towards Americans than anyone else. Must be great making money promoting racism.
912034690193870849 2017-09-24 19:23:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @jaketapper @CalebJHull @DoverNurse06 @nobelpatriot That's the worst part. It's one thing when your enemy is a foreign force, it's worse when you might get shot by your fellow Americans.
912032393401438208 2017-09-24 19:14:01 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 That sad moment when you realize Americans care more about football than your shitty talking points.
912032138458992640 2017-09-24 19:13:01 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 @christas_cheryl @tom_lewisville Exactly. They are paid to play football, not to validate every political point of view you may have. It's called free speech. Respect it.
912030158793711616 2017-09-24 19:05:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @AliVelshi Maybe we should be all united against motorized vehicle accidents too, a far bigger cause of death? Make America Walk Again @DoubleEagle49
912028844923768833 2017-09-24 18:59:55 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @POTUS @seanhannity @wwwillstand @r_little_finger @Dawn_happy2day So essentially "I support repressing the first amendment, as long as it's other people's". You should be ashamed, fake American.
912004197142470657 2017-09-24 17:21:59 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @POTUS @seanhannity @wwwillstand @r_little_finger @Dawn_happy2day Kaepernick destroyed his employer? If anything *Trump* is threatening them by calling for a boycott. Stop defending the indefensible, robot.
911964644453093377 2017-09-24 14:44:49 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @POTUS @seanhannity @wwwillstand @r_little_finger @Dawn_happy2day Because, again, the government works for the *us* not the other way around. Read the Constitution, specially the first amendment.
911717575406624768 2017-09-23 22:23:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @POTUS @seanhannity @wwwillstand @r_little_finger @Dawn_happy2day Because "people" aren't the President of the USA. Aren't all Trump supporters supposed to be for less government power but support *this*?
911712562655432705 2017-09-23 22:03:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @seanhannity Hey, Kat how's your amazing super accomplished life going?
911712306245062659 2017-09-23 22:02:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @NFL @POTUS @seanhannity @wwwillstand @r_little_finger @Dawn_happy2day You do realize that asking for people to be fired is not "tolerance" right? It's like people saying "Nazis just have their opinion"
911677493995859968 2017-09-23 19:43:47 UTC <dguaraglia> @solsanchezbrea @Bracesco @tio_fer Jajaja, los veo por tus retweets. Soy masoca pero tampoco para tanto :P
911677323774251009 2017-09-23 19:43:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @solsanchezbrea @Bracesco @tio_fer No, claro. Yo soy a favor del porte de armas, pero ms a favor todava del uso consciente de armas.
911628291454455808 2017-09-23 16:28:16 UTC <dguaraglia> @jemelehill @jaketapper It's a bit different. When the president is the one asking for a firing, it's unconstitutional.
911627312277401601 2017-09-23 16:24:23 UTC <dguaraglia> @Bracesco @solsanchezbrea @campilongo34 Ah, vos queres volver a la poca donde tener una barba justificaba terminar en un Falcon verde? Macanudo, eh.
911626860752261120 2017-09-23 16:22:35 UTC <dguaraglia> @solsanchezbrea @Bracesco Respuestas como la tuya demuestran que el tipo de la remera tiene razn. Si no podes respetar el arma, no mereces tener una.
911332546079870976 2017-09-22 20:53:05 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants Glorious = "losing a war a hundred and fifty years ago".

910915014739075072 2017-09-21 17:13:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @jonfavs Why won't @BreitbartNews leave policy to the actual experts, instead of supporting a second-tier reality TV star for president?
910914555248857090 2017-09-21 17:12:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @fvrmvn @sophiaedm I was scratching my head about that post last night. Glad @helloBrent clarified.
910873807975583744 2017-09-21 14:30:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @ACLU @slpng_giants Hm... on the other hand, what could trigger more the Breibart authoritarians than ads from the ACLU?
910606451088994305 2017-09-20 20:47:50 UTC <dguaraglia> @JamesADamore @jay6018 Yeah man, this neo-Marxist president, Congress and majority of Governors really are starting to grind on me! Truly oppressed, we the few.
910606038918983681 2017-09-20 20:46:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @JamesADamore Man, just stop digging that hole. Seriously. It's almost like you scout for the dumbest hills to die on over and over.

910520470700740608 2017-09-20 15:06:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @ziberiaI Miren las pelotudeces que buscan para enojarse, no? La mina tiene razn: el Renar es un registro, las leyes las dictan otros. Pero mujer!!!
910519457554010113 2017-09-20 15:02:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @danielha @slpng_giants @disqus has become the alt-reich preferred method to spread their messaging. I guess they are afraid of losing a key demographic?
910494539776962560 2017-09-20 13:23:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @danpfeiffer It makes sense, but it's just a bald-faced lie.
910332246858575872 2017-09-19 02:38:15 UTC <dguaraglia> Hey, look! @BarackObama still cares about using proper Spanish when addressing Spanish speakers. Huge improvement over "bad hombres".

909873876305408001 2017-09-18 20:16:51 UTC <dguaraglia> @FerIglesias @tio_fer Ac nos fumamos a los Republicanos llorando por 8 aos. Ahora tienen poder absoluto y no hacen un carajo. Es todo propaganda incendiaria.
909868351018684417 2017-09-18 19:54:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @FerIglesias @tio_fer Fer, todo bien, pero tampoco a la pavada con estas cosas. El eco chamber pro-Macrista es igual que el pro-CFK. Hay que bajar un cambio.
909861218487291905 2017-09-18 19:26:33 UTC <dguaraglia> @kelseyjharkness "Stop propagandizing" says reporter from literal propaganda outlet.  Irony died in 2016.

909830207296741376 2017-09-18 17:23:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @MisOdios Se, pq son los "progres" solamente que tienen la cabeza cerrada...

909646708887482368 2017-09-17 05:14:10 UTC <dguaraglia> @MarcelaIses @yokozino Ah, pero entonces vos tens PRUEBAS CONCRETAS de que estos son los mismos tipos, no? O es todo conjetura?
909599181685354496 2017-09-17 02:05:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @hanalfabeto Que bueno che, ahora una garca noms representa a todos los "progres". Quien representa a los "anti-progres" me pregunto yo.
909577065434886144 2017-09-17 00:37:26 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 @Sandu_Rodriguez A quien mat, Sandra? Contame por favor, porque ni siquiera Ral que tiene supuesta lista de ataques me nombr una vctima.
909529999564247040 2017-09-17 21:30:24 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Hay una gran diferencia entre "declarar"/"acusar de" y "sentenciar". Me parece que mucha gente, como vos, no entiende esa diferencia.
909519071753986048 2017-09-17 20:46:59 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Es como que los hechos solamente afectan "al otro" en Argentina. Pre-juzgar est brbaro, mientras sea "mi equipo" hacindolo.
909518686490415104 2017-09-17 20:45:27 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Macanudo, entonces explicame: para que carajo repets que Maldonado era un terrorista? Al tipo lo juzgaron ya? No? Entonces son conjeturas.
909506769763827713 2017-09-17 19:58:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Si gendarmera *no* mat a Maldonado, entonces si era "terrorista" o no, no importa. Lo nico que hacs es repetir propaganda poltica.
909506392985358336 2017-09-17 19:56:36 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Si gendarmera mato a Maldonado, decir que era "terrorista" lo nico que hace es justificar la violacin de leyes.
909505228990500865 2017-09-17 19:51:59 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 Mi intencin es que hablemos del tema seriamente, no usando trminos incendiarios. Es fcil decir "terrorismo" y justificar cualquier cosa.
909489236637863937 2017-09-17 18:48:26 UTC <dguaraglia> @Winston_Dunhill Por favor, lean el caso antes de formar su opinin basado en "zurditos quieren derechos humanos para chorros". Somos un pas de leyes o no?
909488658880790529 2017-09-17 18:46:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @Ral15884920 De nuevo, la pregunta es simple: cuanta gente muri por causa de los "terroristas" RAM? Dame un nombre (o 10 si hay tantos.)

909053567398539265 2017-09-16 13:57:14 UTC <dguaraglia> @luisnovaresio @PajaritaTW Convengamos, gente que tiene "miedo de un apriete de la AFIP" no debe tener un historial muy limpio.
908745308691148807 2017-09-15 17:32:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @Olivianuzzi @danpfeiffer So, I guess you could say he never got over the "bro" phase. Sad.

907809931432148992 2017-09-12 03:35:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @elcoya1977 30.000 personas mueren por armas de fuego por ao en Estados Unidos. No todo es maravilloso por ac, eh.
907496001602174976 2017-09-11 06:48:01 UTC <dguaraglia> @meat You can totally tell he doesn't even know how to search for porn like a human, he was like "sexual... posts... Am I doing this right?"
907151528779063296 2017-09-11 07:59:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @danpfeiffer @Nationalism4UK Said, unironically, by someone who's greatest achievement is having a twitter profile with a picture of Nigel Farage.
907147199816986624 2017-09-11 07:42:01 UTC <dguaraglia> @slpng_giants And at least one Hitler-esque haircut on the guy on the left of the picture.

906901878298071041 2017-09-10 15:27:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @AliVelshi Would be a shame if people didn't retweet this all over the place, right? I'm sure @BreitbartNews will appreciate.
906595795629215744 2017-09-09 19:10:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @meat My fav bit: that website's TLS cert didn't mention Equifax, and http://Equifax.com was down at the time. Failure all around.
906200495802503169 2017-09-08 17:00:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @Evan_McMullin This is a scary level of leader worship. Will @mitchellvii #TrusTrump if he takes a really stupid position? What happened to skepticism?

905626724158894081 2017-09-06 03:00:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @LPDonovan This is great. Essentially now you have the Republicans and the Trumpists. This will definitely help the Democrats. For one, I'm happy.

905513244416241664 2017-09-06 19:29:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @TwoPaddocks the link on the twitter profile seems broken. Changing the protocol to HTTPS works. Should be a two minute fix for webadmin.
905512418733903873 2017-09-06 19:25:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @Bracesco Cuanta gente han matado los terroristas mapuches? Se comparan con ISIL o el IRA?
905508830687186944 2017-09-06 19:11:43 UTC <dguaraglia> @ajplus @bakedalaska ROFL, what an embarrassment. Have you at least created your own Uber account now or still using your mom's?

902650484275732481 2017-08-29 21:53:40 UTC <dguaraglia> @jaketapper Not the committees, not the intelligence services, but directly to Trump. Makes you wonder why the secrecy?
902616741863415816 2017-08-29 19:39:35 UTC <dguaraglia> @AnnCoulter Hey, Ann, there's a book about sending troops to Mxico. It was written by Tom Clancy, and it was a criticism to unreasoned jingoism.

902568515890065408 2017-08-29 16:27:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @JoelOsteen Wow, and here I was, thinking that shame didn't work on Evangelicals after they supported Donald Trump. Maybe I was wrong (not likely.)
902544063467057153 2017-08-29 14:50:47 UTC <dguaraglia> @DustinGiebel Well, when you are Steve King, black people dying in Katrina is a win, so this is his wet dream: screw black people *and* pander to racists.

Also, watch this https://twitter.com/realalexrubi/status/896405542305923074 and tell me who is charging who. There's plenty more.

901990700669177862 2017-08-27 02:11:55 UTC <dguaraglia> @NRO @jackfowler @roadhairs @joeydiblasi Good. The next time you see someone tacitly giving the Nazis a pass, call them out on it. Hiding behind "but Antifa is bad!" is horseshit.

890971730893832192 2017-07-28 16:26:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @DaysLeft4Trump @lindathomas102 @CliffMarlowe @gatrgrl82 You mean that old woman in Chappaqua? Remind me why she's important again, when the Republican party has a majority and can't do shit?
890933875677032450 2017-07-28 13:56:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @GovMikeHuckabee so this must be the #whining @realDonaldTrump was saying we'd get tired of. It was #whining, right?
890933848070119424 2017-07-28 13:55:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump Sure, why not give you full control of the country and name you Dear Leader while we are at it? #somuchwinning
889559805349826561 2017-07-24 18:55:59 UTC <dguaraglia> @RealJamesWoods @Mamzie57 A real president would move forward. Obama was hounded for "terrorist fist jabs" and still got shit done. Makes you wonder who is to blame?
888051431349129216 2017-07-20 15:02:15 UTC <dguaraglia> So this is what I've been working on. Exciting stuff.https://twitter.com/iAstrophoto/status/888037024363675649

882476939243433985 2017-07-04 05:51:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @danpfeiffer Savage.
882463626531028993 2017-07-04 04:58:18 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump In Trumperica our most sacred holiday is just another opportunity to push self-aggrandizing propaganda. Founding Fathers would loathe this.
880238776055758848 2017-06-28 01:37:32 UTC <dguaraglia> @JohnCornyn you, sir, are absolutely shameless.
878522936327458816 2017-06-24 07:59:24 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @ReneLeB84932440 @ScottPresler I think what you are seeing here is politicians caring about justice more than their party. Would never happen in a GOP congress.
878516832587481089 2017-06-24 07:35:09 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump you know about the possibility of future election meddling right now, what are YOU doing about it?
875905090271363073 2017-06-16 02:37:01 UTC <dguaraglia> @simonw Hah, have lived in the city for 4 years and didn't even know this was a thing. Now I've got to try it!
875409625264168961 2017-06-15 17:48:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @BreitbartNews so what you are saying is that Muslims terrorists kill fewer people than American gun owners do  in the same timeframe? Neat.
874815413460258819 2017-06-13 02:27:02 UTC <dguaraglia> @FoxNews This post shows that Republicans would rather have revenge over "Obummer" than a realistic healthcare solution. Good job!
874805739272888320 2017-06-13 01:48:36 UTC <dguaraglia> @FoxNews @roney_todd Talk about uninformed drivel. How does having several hearings and dozens of Republican amendments count as "passed in secret"?
874805392496148480 2017-06-13 01:47:13 UTC <dguaraglia> @FoxNews @d_roneal @ckgTrolleyDolly Comey is surely taking your Healthcare away.
869791417387728896 2017-05-30 05:43:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump of all the stupid shit you've said, this is the least offensive.
869680734688002048 2017-05-30 22:23:39 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @AlexMLeo @steveintylertx For all the crying and moaning from the right, Obamacare passed with more scrutiny than Trumpcare. Too stupid to remember?
867616612739760128 2017-05-24 05:41:34 UTC <dguaraglia> @IngrahamAngle You know, for the bunch of snowflakes that you alt-righters are, you surely love to sound tough.
865992886013251584 2017-05-20 18:09:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump Hey, so did you get them to promise free oil for 10 years MASTER NEGOTIATOR IN CHIEF?
865232235833638912 2017-05-18 15:46:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump actually, I think your 7-year campaign of baseless accusations against Obama are way bigger than this, you big fat crybaby.
864707275906105344 2017-05-16 05:00:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @AG_Conservative @HotlineJosh @JamieRJN You might want to stop watching *just* Fox News. Seriously.
864241091872038913 2017-05-15 22:08:27 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump Who would've thought all the dumb shit you said over the years would come back to bite you in the ass?
863135746605031424 2017-05-12 20:56:12 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @wikileaks @MeSharona1 @MEUonamission @schestowitz "but her emails!"
862115689766674432 2017-05-09 01:22:52 UTC <dguaraglia> @justinamash doesn't it remind you of what a 8 year old would write if he was caught with his hands in the cookie jar?
850231931832721409 2017-04-06 06:21:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @AnnCoulter You enabled this shitshow with your years of publishing conspiratorial nonsense. Now own it.
850229602450513920 2017-04-06 06:11:48 UTC <dguaraglia> @Cernovich @surrealkill3r @trudeO1982 Don't even bother. These people live in an alternate universe where everything that hurts their narrative is a "false flag".
850221360177532928 2017-04-06 05:39:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @wwbrrt @realDonaldTrump @ArmedInfidel_US Ah... the apologists springing right into action.
847586509641236480 2017-03-30 23:09:05 UTC <dguaraglia> @MattWalshBlog FYI, most people aren't scared of having friends of different genders. Maybe you are scared you are too weak to resist temptation?
846042216518713344 2017-03-26 16:52:37 UTC <dguaraglia> @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump hahaha, what a coward, the POTUS needs another TV personality to send his message. Weak.
845509214013440000 2017-03-24 05:34:40 UTC <dguaraglia> @YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODXWJWXR2D0&sns=tw via @youtube
838492817294942209 2017-03-05 20:54:00 UTC <dguaraglia> @seanhannity @jonfavs Lynch recused herself from any investigations related to the Clintons. So what's your point?
838492551589969920 2017-03-05 20:52:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @seanhannity @jonfavs @SherrieLevin1 "the rightie right" always plays the "libruls bad" card. So your point is?
833854947166810113 2017-02-20 01:44:46 UTC <dguaraglia> So, apparently Milo has goons brigading his Facebook public page and trying to doxx/intimidate critical posts. Poor unique snow flake.
833096570711134209 2017-02-18 23:31:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @ErickFernandez dude, are you telling me Trump is a hypocrite? I'm shocked, *shocked* I tell you! :o
833096320529289216 2017-02-18 23:30:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump what? The Yee-Haw White House was taken already?
833030206994538496 2017-02-18 19:07:32 UTC <dguaraglia> So @realDonaldTrump has made Mar-A-Lago a political Disneyland for rich people. Pay-for-play, everyone? #LockHimUp?
832495028316495873 2017-02-16 07:40:56 UTC <dguaraglia> @POTUS @johnrobertsFox @FoxNews @LashG yeah man, let's not report on facts, just let the man whine as much as he wants about ratings!
832489556976955398 2017-02-16 07:19:11 UTC <dguaraglia> @zigeist88 @OmniDestiny @DanyelR1 "winners" do shit. The Birther in Chief? So far, just bitch and moan about "unfair media".
832110736113426433 2017-02-15 06:13:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @zigeist88 @OmniDestiny @DanyelR1 not pictured: those are the highest density areas in the country. Trump lost by 3 million votes.
831383246277484545 2017-02-13 06:03:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @JackPosobiec well, that's awkward...
828700605518524416 2017-02-06 20:23:15 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump how long before you propose a Ministry of Truth that only publishes "greatest, tremendous" news?
828699389694664704 2017-02-06 20:18:25 UTC <dguaraglia> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @MikeElgan @Tommyysalami @WereScrewed2017 Trump seems to think so. So which one is it?
826947002055286784 2017-02-01 00:15:03 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @antonnewcombe @tuckercarlsoneg @NahBitchUDidnt nobody knows, do you? The #LiarInChief hasn't provided any proof.
826930367269478401 2017-02-01 23:08:57 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @NahBitchUDidnt @antonnewcombe @tuckercarlsoneg won? Last time I heard, he lost by 3m votes with the lowest participation.
826325052673060865 2017-01-30 07:03:39 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump what do you care? You have #presidentbannon. He should be able to tell you everything you need to do, amirite?
826323837385990144 2017-01-30 06:58:49 UTC <dguaraglia> @DailyCaller @AnnCoulter what "govt" are you talking about? You won. Trump would supposedly have the numbers, let him release them!
826322402632036352 2017-01-30 06:53:07 UTC <dguaraglia> @thehighsign Trump's whole campaign was about how "Democrats have done nothing to secure the border". Which one is it?
826321597812183040 2017-01-30 06:49:55 UTC <dguaraglia> @thehighsign I guess the thread didn't transfer. You were complaining about Democrats "banning visas" (read: suspending.)
826321285403725824 2017-01-30 06:48:41 UTC <dguaraglia> @thetigersez @thehighsign @bullgator2012 I see you are wearing an ass hat, hahahahhahahahahahahahah.
826321087235383296 2017-01-30 06:47:54 UTC <dguaraglia> @thehighsign wait, wait, I thought the Democrats had never done anything for our security? Which one is it?
826320475772968960 2017-01-30 06:45:28 UTC <dguaraglia> @Hero5700 @thehighsign @DropThe_Mic yeah, except for the whole "hating people of color" thing, he's probably super nice. Get a grip.
824492900788510720 2017-01-25 05:43:20 UTC <dguaraglia> @adviseagainstit @kharyp @CynicalPublius so, to you escalation and death is preferable. Gotcha.
824129697831354370 2017-01-24 05:40:06 UTC <dguaraglia> @adviseagainstit @kharyp @CynicalPublius huh? You don't make any sense. #fakenews #alternativefacts
824129002893930500 2017-01-24 05:37:20 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump @kharyp @adviseagainstit because they export criminals to parts of the country with actual money? #itsnothathard
824128440341266434 2017-01-24 05:35:06 UTC <dguaraglia> .@realDonaldTrump I thought Obama was supposed to be the totalitarian monster trying to impose Federal power on states? #stopwatchingtv
823307986516877312 2017-01-22 23:14:54 UTC <dguaraglia> .@KellyannePolls .@seanspicer just when I thought you had shed all your dignity, you manage to prove you can always be *more* reprehensible.
823306239153012737 2017-01-22 23:07:58 UTC <dguaraglia> @meat yeah, but he's a "peaceful" Nazi! /s
823235645761982464 2017-01-22 18:27:27 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump could you go and find the ratings numbers for 8 years ago? Weird you'd compare to a second term inauguration.
823233851354796032 2017-01-22 18:20:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 but trolling people with Nazi memes using a fake handle is noble and courageous? Haha! What a loser!
823233220892184576 2017-01-22 18:17:49 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 this my public handle, which I share everywhere and is a short form of my name. I don't hide behind pepes like a coward.
823228566447931393 2017-01-22 17:59:19 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 the people you call faggots have fought for their rights for decades. You, on the other hand, hide on the Internet. Such courage!
823227631956955136 2017-01-22 17:55:36 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 I just find it hilarious that some whiner hiding behind a fake name tries to use a homophobic epiteth to "offend". The irony!
823224427022168064 2017-01-22 17:42:52 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 haha, you keep saying "faggot", but you know, you are the one hurting insults behind a fake name. A bit insecure, buddy? Aweee...
823223622642765824 2017-01-22 17:39:41 UTC <dguaraglia> @wikileaks @Wulph7 only Republicans consistently follow "a big leader" against their own interests. Just like drones.
823219712079196161 2017-01-22 17:24:08 UTC <dguaraglia> @Wulph7 ROFL, so the moment you have nothing to say to defend Trump (have you ever?) you call me faggot. Triggered much, special snowflake?
823108793693155328 2017-01-22 10:03:23 UTC <dguaraglia> @wikileaks @Wulph7 hey, bud, don't know if you follow the news, but Trump won. Hillary is irrelevant. He chose his swampy cabinet, not her.
823099955921358848 2017-01-22 09:28:16 UTC <dguaraglia> @wikileaks @Wulph7 what is there to debate? Your shtick is trying to troll "the left" with asinine comments. Your recalcitrance is adorable.
823089492424736768 2017-01-22 08:46:41 UTC <dguaraglia> @wikileaks @Wulph7 if you wanna talk mindless drones: look at the people who voted for Trump, then look at his establishment cabinet.
823088522110210048 2017-01-22 08:42:50 UTC <dguaraglia> @DMVFollowers @wikileaks @bbogaard that's some nice #FakeNews you've got there, buddy.

800054949388259329 2016-11-19 19:15:38 UTC <dguaraglia> @realDonaldTrump weren't you a champion of free speech? Now you are asking people to bend the knee and kiss the ring? So un-American!
