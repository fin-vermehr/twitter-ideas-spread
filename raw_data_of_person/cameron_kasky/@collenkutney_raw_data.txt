958410865975406598 2018-01-30 18:45:31 UTC <collenkutney> Nothing this "shoot from the hip" president will discuss tonight at the #SOTU will matter in a week, month, or months after. It's purely for winning the affection of cable news pundits *this week*.
958410057212887040 2018-01-30 18:42:18 UTC <collenkutney> Tonight's #SOTU will be a staged reality show with with no significant policies, olive branches or proposals to fix our government to better serve the people. I'm not watching.
958409231580979200 2018-01-30 18:39:01 UTC <collenkutney> The #SOTU is always a show. Lots of handshaking, pleasantries and symbolic gestures. Also, the president usually makes several proposals that he plans to follow through on. The speech is structured to serve as a recap, temperature check and a vision for the upcoming year.

955505419937632256 2018-01-22 18:20:19 UTC <collenkutney> Protecting Dreamers isn't a "base issue". It's the most common sense, obvious and compassionate thing to do while our immigration system remains in disarray. Dreamers are integral parts of our communities and workplaces. It is a shame to turn our backs on them.

949000318641111040 2018-01-04 19:31:22 UTC <collenkutney> "The same way that Bannon has an almost supersensory ability to divine ways to tie together white supremacy, cultural anxiety, class warfare, xenophobia and government distrust, Trump is supremely aware, on a gut level, that we live in an attention economy." @CharlesMBlow
948978860766515201 2018-01-04 18:06:06 UTC <collenkutney> Trump claims Bannon has "nothing to do" with him. Trump claimed he hadn't spoken with Putin for years and we know that's not true. Trump can't think a day ahead. Bannon plays the long game. Let's see how this plays out.
948977071837077504 2018-01-04 17:58:59 UTC <collenkutney> How do I know? Complete sentences. A thought out argument that hits on several points. Trump has the attention span of 140 characters. That statement is more than one paragraph.
948976520235749376 2018-01-04 17:56:48 UTC <collenkutney> People are giving Trump way too much credit for "drafting" that Bannon take-down. Kushner wrote it.

697266846228045824 2016-02-09 03:52:25 UTC <collenkutney> Every fact I learn about Jeb's spending makes me feel so bad for him. That's a pretty penny in NH. Ouch.https://twitter.com/sppeoples/status/697239337889562624
697214416417378305 2016-02-09 00:24:05 UTC <collenkutney> The newsroom is so excited about the "high" turnout in NH. Still lags greatly behind other democracies. NH not rep of the country.

694513815556218880 2016-02-02 13:32:51 UTC <collenkutney> It's really scary when Cruz wins in Iowa. Then again in the past two cycles they selected Huckabee and Santorum so why am I surprised?
694342658131623937 2016-02-01 02:12:44 UTC <collenkutney> Woof @NateSilver538 Jeb Bush is projecting to win one Iowa caucus vote for every $25,000 spent by Right to Rise.

693106696433070080 2016-01-29 16:21:28 UTC <collenkutney> Is it sad or adorable that Huckabee and Santorum are still hoping to Hail Mary in Iowa? #GOPDebate
