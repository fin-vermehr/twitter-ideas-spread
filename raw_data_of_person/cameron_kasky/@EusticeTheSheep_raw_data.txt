937777426326630400 2017-12-04 20:15:36 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @Dr_Maria_Brink @reepRN @fuzzyblumonster Classic reason knowing dog behavior wrecks internet dogs: squinted eyes: I am not trying to piss you off. Turning away: I don't want any conflict. Tail wagging stiffly (vs fluid loose wag): Go away! Touch me and it's on!
936723864960122880 2017-12-01 22:29:07 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SoberReeval what's your score?
936689649136762880 2017-12-01 20:13:09 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SoberReeval Take a look here:https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/assessing-joint-hypermobility/
936658246781222912 2017-12-01 18:08:22 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> Babywearing came up recently when my friend @pantalonesfuego was asking about something. This website is a pretty amazing source. They've listed video tuts for so many different types of carries. https://sites.google.com/site/babywearingforbeginners/home/tutorials

936324083943215104 2017-11-30 20:00:32 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @medicalaxioms @tdgor To her it meant "keep me out pain and let me die". I don't think anyone else read it that way.
936321916360564736 2017-11-30 19:51:55 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @medicalaxioms @tdgor I am now of the opinion that anyone that gets that kind of tat needs a psych eval every time they present to the ED.

934259450164031488 2017-11-24 03:16:25 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @pantalonesfuego I'm so very happy for you.
934258289201758209 2017-11-24 03:11:48 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse You'd think that maybe she wouldn't want to perpetuate that ...
934257637654327296 2017-11-24 03:09:13 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @Emma_The_Ward I was told it was related to grinding my teeth in my sleep. I haven't had that dream in a while but dentist says I still grind my teeth.
934257209856335872 2017-11-24 03:07:31 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @Emma_The_Ward I used to.

933538748607823872 2017-11-22 03:32:36 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @ALT_uscis please discourage fat shaming. People like Joe Barton think that their fame & power makes them irresistible. But the fat shaming comments really are not the point.
933536535013605376 2017-11-22 03:23:48 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse I wonder the same thing.

917828885869240320 2017-10-10 19:07:13 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter I couldn't do estrogen patches because of the itching red indurated skin. Maybe it'll be mild enough to just do hydrocortisone cream
917828528548192256 2017-10-10 19:05:48 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter Oh yes, it is super uncomfortable. I had autonomic testing and the adhesive of the patches was more uncomfortable than the electric current
917826693506621440 2017-10-10 18:58:30 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter Depending on the adhesive my skin will get so angry that it'll look like a chemical burn.
917823281951936512 2017-10-10 18:44:57 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter I should Google before I tweet... The answer is no.
917822637895671808 2017-10-10 18:42:23 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter Adhesive allergies suck. I wonder if 3M Cavalon barrier can be used with transdermal patches.

917075831343562753 2017-10-08 17:14:51 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @greatersafety Maybe you need to give yourself permission to keep the book handy. You're going to suck at most things the first time you do them.
917072213265616896 2017-10-08 17:00:28 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @greatersafety My no. 1 suggestion is books by http://www.fabermazlish.com their 1st book is great for what you want.

908484662455971840 2017-09-14 00:16:37 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> Just to be clear: registering pts 2.5 hours before "Urgent Care" opens. Apparently everyone knows about this but it's not printed anywhere.

897486108182716416 2017-08-15 15:52:17 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @DrHansman Easy to muddy 140 characters. I need to work on clarity. Also, white (Jewish, but still white). I learn from mistakes. Promise.

897484746720026625 2017-08-15 15:46:52 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @DrHansman Oh no. That's not at all what I meant. I meant that I was blinded by my own perception. I was trying to paint a picture. I won't do that

897123686888513536 2017-08-14 15:52:09 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse Would staying and making public, vociferous disagreement along with putting pressure on WH be a better option?
897122945423654912 2017-08-14 15:49:12 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse Sometimes I wonder if it would be better for good people to stay. If they leave & are replaced by someone worse, who benefits?
896966962621718528 2017-08-13 05:29:23 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @DrHansman Because it's too easy to close collective eyes. I'm also sexual assault survivor who's triggered by assaults. I still want it shown.

887125308100329472 2017-07-17 01:42:10 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse To choose red/blue a minute+ shoes on etc... Matter of fact tone, empathy "I'm sad too, I wanted you to pick but you ran out of time"
887124819036078080 2017-07-17 01:40:13 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @shriekhouse That's the choice. The shoes go on or no [desired thing]. You start with red or blue and narrow choices. Using a timer helps too 10 seconds

883728928505864192 2017-07-08 16:46:10 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter Any hospital would require someone to report a specific level to get tx If so someone doesn't know WTF they're doing. It's subjective!
883728414640717825 2017-07-08 16:44:07 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter There is no 15, if it's "15" you have new "10". Don't try to rate your pain based on anything other than YOUR experience I can't imagine
883727071960113152 2017-07-08 16:38:47 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SamuraiKnitter Most misunderstood measurement! Pain is 100% subjective.  I last worked yrs. ago 0= no pain 10= worst pain YOU ever experienced (more)

855100724287385601 2017-04-20 16:47:54 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> @SmileandConquer Ouch. So you basically have "catastrophe insurance" It doesn't cover anything until you've spent $1000 per incident or illness.

854707443544150016 2017-04-19 14:45:08 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> to be 10 I'll be paying ~290% of original rate! Since @Trupanion deductibles are per illness/incident it winds up being catastrophic only
854706805477261312 2017-04-19 14:42:36 UTC <EusticeTheSheep> I have been happy w/ @Trupanion they pay claims quickly and employees are nice But rates increase on average 29% annually if my dog lives
