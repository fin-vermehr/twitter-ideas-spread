879823513141563396 2017-06-27 22:07:26 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @TheSpun @NDIrishViews giving all that for 1 year is stupid

879434152289939457 2017-06-26 20:20:15 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @warriorsworld @ChrisBHaynes Poverty straighty povo
879297316863266816 2017-06-26 11:16:31 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ChrisBHaynes @ESPNSteinLine Denver would be losing in that deal. They should ask for more like Shumpert or something. Love is an L contract
879030269021491200 2017-06-25 17:35:22 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @F1 The formula 1 organisation is absolutely biased. If @LewisHamilton had done what Vettel did he would have been DQ'd easy
879011465478500354 2017-06-25 16:20:39 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Absolutely disgusting @F1 If Lewis was the one who acted the way Vettel did He would have been disqualified. They are totally biased @bbcf1
877980303666552833 2017-06-22 20:03:11 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @jadande @WindhorstESPN Why would the @NBA be so stupid to project revenue on games which may or may not occur. Salary Caps mst b guranteed
877627472338190336 2017-06-21 20:41:09 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Hey @juliephayer maybe the @warriors should go after Tony Allen. Making a super super superteam @unstoppablebabyhttps://twitter.com/CBSSportsNBA/status/877545097331707904
876922454807121920 2017-06-19 21:59:40 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @hoopscritic  thats a tweet that can shape a career one way or the other
876917405909438464 2017-06-19 21:39:36 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ShamsCharania @TheVertical @YahooSports a play to squeeze every last dollar out of the @warriors by the rest of the league. Nice job

874310884784562176 2017-06-12 17:02:13 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @OfficialNBARefs Derrick Stafford looks like a cavs fan. Come On #nba couldnt you bring out the very best Refs for the #NBAFinals @ESPNNBA
874310347708129282 2017-06-12 17:00:05 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> #NBAFINALS IF @warriors wins the FinalsMVP has to be Steph. Game4 shows if Steph is bad warriors are bad whether KD is hot or not @ESPNNBA
874284666815213570 2017-06-12 15:18:02 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Steph  & @warriors look, sound too casual about game 5. This game should be life or death or they will lose @LetsGoWarriors @warriorsworld
873923571604738049 2017-06-11 15:23:10 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @NBA The refs where on a mission from the @nba to make sure this series extends and is as tough for @warriors as possiblehttps://twitter.com/Ballislife/status/873917742772084737
873892984458268672 2017-06-11 13:21:38 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ESPN_FanCentral ... and silly @mcten fell for it thinking it is news when it had nothing to do with their motivation for the game @espn 
873892480751677442 2017-06-11 13:19:38 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ESPN_FanCentral why is @mcten silly article about Green's comments still up on the @espn page. Kyrie was still trash talking to Green...
873754217529454592 2017-06-10 04:10:13 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @espn @mcten so losing the #NBAFinals and being swept was not motivation enough? you telling me the #cavs are that childish? Dumb article!
873636300573822977 2017-06-10 20:21:40 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @NBAOfficial Why cavs can be as physical as they like on every play but warriors get whistled for touch fouls. @OfficialNBARefs #NBAFinals
873588333263409153 2017-06-10 17:11:03 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @espn so being swept is not motivation. Losing the #NBAFinals & possibly your teammates when LeBron asks for changes wont be motivation ??
873508115848859649 2017-06-10 11:52:18 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @mercnews @anthonyVslater Draymond Green should just shut up and control himself or else he could Cost the @warriors a title @LetsGoWarriors
873507058741641216 2017-06-10 11:48:06 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @TreymondGreen Draymond Green needs to stop his mouth with the media and play Ball. He gave cavs some life when they where dead @BabersGreen
873443805374054400 2017-06-10 07:36:45 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @SekouSmithNBA @NBAcom Great script writing from the NBA for this game. Bad officiating throughout ruines this game
873441024143757312 2017-06-10 07:25:42 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @NBAOfficial shows how terrible you guys are at doing that job. That was a terrible game by the officials

872584816121741312 2017-06-07 22:43:26 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Why is Matt Barnes not playing. He is a solid defender can probably guard LeBron at times. he is being wasted on the bench @warriorsworld
872533670346797056 2017-06-07 19:20:12 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> When is Dan FatFace Coming back from vacation. I need to come back to the show too many Hottakes out here @LeBatardShow @MichaelRyanRuiz !
872156442928787456 2017-06-06 18:21:14 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @RobParkerFS1 Rob Parker is such a liar. How can he say ratings are down when they are the best ratings since '96 Bulls inspite the blowouts
871715772376256512 2017-06-05 13:10:10 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @LeKingJames23 who cares he got away with it like LeBron gets away with travels
870774844174086144 2017-06-02 22:51:15 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Why are @warriors not chopping up Kyrie Irvings hands like cavs. seems to be only way to take his wizard hands out of rythmn @warriorsworld
870618733471031297 2017-06-02 12:30:56 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @BabersGreen I think Draymond Green is a Prophet. I sense an #annihilation coming

867501503283699712 2017-05-24 22:04:10 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Mike Brown should go small to start game 1 for  @warriors so they get into game shape & get focussed quickly @LetsGoWarriors @warriorsworld
866775836522926081 2017-05-22 22:00:38 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @HR8886 looks like you wer prophetic
866775483345756161 2017-05-22 21:59:13 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @BSO i bet Pop put him in there just to do exactly that. So hypocritical. Yet  #NBA does absolutely nothing about it!!! That was intentional
866775087608995840 2017-05-22 21:57:39 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @DefPenHoops thats dirty how can you say its questionable seriously ???
866766865498066944 2017-05-22 21:24:59 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @BBCNews looks so labour. Giving theresa may such a hard time but jeremy corbyn a clear pass on all his lofty debt ridden policies
866150823583207425 2017-05-20 04:37:03 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @KDTrey5 @NBA @hurleyvq I'm sure he will be fine without your money. Dont Watch IT!!@
866150202503286784 2017-05-20 04:34:35 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> "If you dont like it. Don't watch it" - Kevin Durant speaks to fans complaining about the #nbaplayoffs I completely agree.

864260580076646400 2017-05-15 23:25:54 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ramonashelburne @ROSGO21 @espn you are turning your sports network into a kardashians tmz type of network the way you cover these BALLS
864257786523373568 2017-05-15 23:14:48 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @ramonashelburne @ROSGO21 @espn find something else worthwhile to talk about Ramona. Stop dry washing & sucking these balls lavar and lonzo

862043434252734464 2017-05-09 20:35:45 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> LeBronz has to be using Steroids no way he can be such a freak and never get hurt or injured and be playing so many minutes that CHEAT @NBA

860274011728752646 2017-05-04 23:24:42 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> Cavs Channing Frye LeBron are taking practice 3point shots in the playoffs. Dwane Casey @Raptors should be ashamed of themselves @Stugotz790
860273486597632003 2017-05-04 23:22:36 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> LeBron is making Black coaches in the #nbaplayoffs look absolutely terrible & incompetent. Why isnt Dwane Casey running the cavs off the 3?
860237660371202049 2017-05-04 21:00:15 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @bigballerbrand @Chris_Broussard $2.25 and i will reluctantly order them. Else i have better things to pay for

711143810819084288 2016-03-19 10:54:31 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> If it was jordan and bulls/iverson & sixers /kobe and lakers instead of curry & @warriors, @stephenasmith wud be ok with their dominance

693596678528618496 2016-01-30 00:48:29 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @StephenCurry30 @Money23Green @hbarnes and the @warriors must see today's game as a LOSS not a win @SherwoodStrauss @ROSGO21 @SportsCenter
693596089698623490 2016-01-30 00:46:08 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> @warriors should treat today's game as a HUGE LOSS against worst team in the league & get #LockedIn for the 2nd half of the season @ESPNNBA
690314867291586562 2016-01-21 23:27:44 UTC <Maclenore_Demar> So the @NBA Refs dont call fouls on Steph Curry 3s because he is good. Yet he gets fouled almost every time. Rubbish officials  @NBAOfficial
