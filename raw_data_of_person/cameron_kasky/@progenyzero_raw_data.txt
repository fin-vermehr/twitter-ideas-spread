966037366153637889 2018-02-20 19:50:30 UTC <progenyzero> We are talking about gun safety ...the truth is, there are usually occasions in normal like when the safety rule doesn't work. The safest is not to have guns around at all. I don't think guns should be outlawed. People are not thinking straight always.

964603172949057536 2018-02-16 20:51:32 UTC <progenyzero> None of these afterthoughts bring back any of the lives that were lost or souls that are missing now. What they might have brought to our world? 
964603171699089409 2018-02-16 20:51:32 UTC <progenyzero> New weapons could be required to have an RFID Chip installed ...doesn't help with all of the existing weapons.
964603170461769728 2018-02-16 20:51:31 UTC <progenyzero> Furthermore, I agree with the mother who spoke urging metal detectors and sensing equipment on school property; actually, with our technology ...there could be a siginficant distrance to prevent any proximity to schools, libraries, public areas, like in Las Vegas.
964603169295790080 2018-02-16 20:51:31 UTC <progenyzero> Moreover, GUN CONTROL efforts, banning sale of assault rifles to citizens must be pursued.
964603167861346306 2018-02-16 20:51:31 UTC <progenyzero> The weapon itself did not cause the violence; however, like with other, planned criminal activities ...use of a weapon during the commission of the crime should result in prosecution and sentencing consequences.
964603166330368010 2018-02-16 20:51:30 UTC <progenyzero> there might be cause to place groups so professed on a list of potential or suspected TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS in the event that one of their members performs an act of violence such as this ...mass shooting in Florida.

963979370481274880 2018-02-14 03:32:46 UTC <progenyzero> IF your home is nearby and you are registered, not a problem as long as you did not cross into the SCHOOL ZONE, or something. THE PEOPLE WHO CARE do want to do something...
963979369122328576 2018-02-14 03:32:46 UTC <progenyzero> #Democrats  THE COMPROMISE ...none so far. MAYBE IF SAFE ZONES were declared around schools, parks, shopping areas that had 1/2 radius with metal detectors ...it might help the Police to keep children and general public safe.
963979367830433792 2018-02-14 03:32:45 UTC <progenyzero> The greatest concern is that the ILLEGAL ACTIVITY includes the buying and selling of ILLEGAL GUNS ...not just guns WEAPONS TRADE, internationally. Unfortunately, those who want DO HARM TO OTHERS as well.
963979366710546432 2018-02-14 03:32:45 UTC <progenyzero> STILL, REAL PROBLEM ...LIKE ALL LAWS, people neither trained, registered. nor WELL-INTENDED (use enjoy guns recreationally or protect themselves/family/neighbours), can get guns without following ANY EXISTING LAWS.  PEOPLE using guns illegally FORCE MORE LAWS on others.
963979364919541760 2018-02-14 03:32:45 UTC <progenyzero> AND THEN, the people who feel unsafe EVERYWHERE unless they have access to a gun. SOME are a bit insistent (fear-driven); generally registered and responsible ...although to our great misfortunate there are a lot of accidental shootings.

963979362998669312 2018-02-14 03:32:44 UTC <progenyzero> There are people living in remote areas who feel the need to protect themselves, usually registered and responsible ...used to guns, even if not formally trained: they know what they are doing.  GOOD CITIZENSpic.twitter.com/IsPWsSzlew
963979361660653569 2018-02-14 03:32:44 UTC <progenyzero> There are some honest sport enthusiasts who enjoy having guns to collect and use at firing ranges, etc. MOST are well-trained, registered, and responsible. GOOD CITIZENS

960726948346519552 2018-02-05 04:08:48 UTC <progenyzero> @SenSanders @Colorado4Bernie @ForThePeopleFL I think primarying should be encouraged. There should be a No-Confidence Vote mechanism at State-Level if the official does not meet constituent expectations.

WHY? becuase whoever those people are in the party now
960718797903712256 2018-02-05 03:36:25 UTC <progenyzero> @SenSanders @Colorado4Bernie @ForThePeopleFL DNC agreed to be paid back by Obama campaign too late to ramp-up for 2016, in my opinion. BY DESIGN, they planned to be underfunded. I think HRC did the right thing helping them AND monitoring them; yet, as a candidate it was a confict of interest in appearance if nothing more...
960718100890079233 2018-02-05 03:33:39 UTC <progenyzero> @SenSanders @Colorado4Bernie @ForThePeopleFL Frankly, the DNC has demonstrated an alarming lack of ...I think the word is coompetence, in its performance and planning.

956697830344847362 2018-01-25 01:18:31 UTC <progenyzero> @4aPeoplesParty A valid question is how to continue to engage our statesmen when they are going strong into their 80s and 90s. They need to train up the 20/30/40s groups. On the other hand, there's a teenager in Vermont who sounds very capable. It's about finding BALANCE.http://wral.com/16927526
956696467997102080 2018-01-25 01:13:07 UTC <progenyzero> DNC needs to vary its leadership, rotate people more frequently. It appears that there was a long period of stagnation. It isn't about AGE or not being challenged, it is about the PARADIGM. I think that fear (9/11) carried America backward well we should have charged forward.
956696466793336832 2018-01-25 01:13:06 UTC <progenyzero> IF the answer is no, then Democrats need to secure better representation. The DNC has to accept the direction that its people want. DIVERSITY supposedly makes Democrats stronger: Liberals don't want to exist as well-programmed followers.

956561324040949760 2018-01-25 16:16:06 UTC <progenyzero> @SpiritEquality We cannot be defeated to think: it will always be the same way it has been. The TRUTH will come out ...and we have to put it IN PRINT for all to see and read and know.

954070339176337408 2018-01-18 19:17:49 UTC <progenyzero> Instead, I would suggest community-level advocacy campaign. Encourage the "Good Neighbour" businesses to post the sign ALL ARE WELCOME. If the community doesn't see that sign, they should not patronize that business. Some would still go to other places: that is their choice.

954065554746281984 2018-01-18 18:58:48 UTC <progenyzero> Yes, some people are comfortable and familiar with having the 'leaders' dole out orders, 20%.

954033760563015680 2018-01-18 16:52:28 UTC <progenyzero> Frankly, Clinton didn't get as much support as she should have had from the Party either. Don't try to dredge up discord over this fabricated, prolonged rivalry between 2016 candidates. This is about you guys continuing to be CONTROL FREAKS, just like the Republicans.

953874439761997824 2018-01-17 06:19:23 UTC <progenyzero> A few years ago, I had new Russian emigre who had lived in the Soviet Union during the Cold War. She was told to mention MLK Day at our staff meeting which was a teleconference. This is what she said...

953834577105125376 2018-01-17 03:40:59 UTC <progenyzero> Mentioned because, when we talk about #EDUCATION learning as little as possible to 'get paid' really isn't an attitude that reflects being *educated,* is it???
953834574072745989 2018-01-17 03:40:58 UTC <progenyzero> Likewise, in the national superiority of Americans, most expect Scandinavians to speak ENGLISH, even when traveling to their country. Personally, I thought that attitude was inappropriate. I learned to read,write, speak Norwegian while living in the region, working for the UN.
953834571602243584 2018-01-17 03:40:57 UTC <progenyzero> I wrote an email in Norwegian to a Norwegian-American from Minnesota. He stopped by my desk and asked, "What language was that?" He had only heard a few words from his grandmother. That much from Ms. Nielson is very true.
953834564081811456 2018-01-17 03:40:56 UTC <progenyzero> FYI, 3rd+ gen Norwegian-Americans are not Norway savvy, nor do they know anything about the language. The Anglo-American pressure to 'fit-in' and speak only english weakens what could be a very richly diverse culture in the United States.
953834562425163778 2018-01-17 03:40:55 UTC <progenyzero> Another female, casualty, covering for P45.

952378279096389633 2018-01-13 03:14:10 UTC <progenyzero> @Carolyny1948 So srorry to have confused you ...those were the words of our fearless leader P45 on Jan 9 at his DACA meeting, not mine. All the best.
952377760110006273 2018-01-13 03:12:06 UTC <progenyzero> @krassenstein We have to be aware of both as facts and ...the dangers that they mean to our society and culture.
952360604735590400 2018-01-13 02:03:56 UTC <progenyzero> @BretStephensNYT @AmyMiranda @DeanObeidallah This is like an open secret: possibly, unfotunately ...the only ones who might not know the details are his wife and the young son. Frankly, if they didn't know from him ...why are we telling them about it. 2018 and 2020. History will tell what our priorities are.

952359144354451457 2018-01-13 01:58:08 UTC <progenyzero> @AmyMiranda @BretStephensNYT It seems like the Republicans are after P45 ...WHY NOW? after the TaxCut for their donors. IF ANY research was done before he was nominated ...his people know this already.

952356298980560896 2018-01-13 01:46:50 UTC <progenyzero> @Thom_Hartmann @DeanObeidallah @MSignorile  It sounds negative ...I just think that it is true.

952355311842742272 2018-01-13 01:42:54 UTC <progenyzero> @ProgressOutlook They meet in private (or, they don't care).  I know people in their hearts do not want the second answer: I think that it is a valid answer, probaly the most true. They got the money they wanted for their donors.

952338775186792448 2018-01-13 00:37:12 UTC <progenyzero> @Carolyny1948 We are not safe ...MILITARY must be fortified: we must sell arms and support Israel's 'democracy' ...That was discussed in the Jan 9 meeting also.
952338061760847872 2018-01-13 00:34:22 UTC <progenyzero> The gist is they want to bring back 'EARMARKING' ...because it brought people together.
952338060485844998 2018-01-13 00:34:21 UTC <progenyzero> There was a person in the room who I could not identify. He looked to be in disbelief, wasn't buying the 'Let's come together la la ...that was him; Trey Gowdy. It was clearly a photo opp, AFTER Republicans had met already. Trump insisted on meeting with Dems.
952338058854191104 2018-01-13 00:34:21 UTC <progenyzero> Brian:  TGowdy was the one. Thank you. There was a very fairytale ...'Could we perhaps define love' and 'We'll take care of DACA' and maybe we could hang out together, GOP and Dems meeting on 9 January.https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/952278905431478272
952336086218477573 2018-01-13 00:26:31 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa Teere they are: THE ISSUES that must be dealt with ...who talks about; who is focused on them; who has even suggested approaches to start handling them???
952335336092454912 2018-01-13 00:23:32 UTC <progenyzero> @krassenstein This is just like supporting Roy Moore; apparently, a nonissue.
952295227812958209 2018-01-13 21:44:09 UTC <progenyzero> @spacemtn24 @proviewsusa What's that?
952295009394610176 2018-01-13 21:43:17 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa I know party 'loyaty' and control of people ...enough influence to gain their support with dangled advantages. This 'a better deal' is too vague and offers substantial support to people.
952283002347970561 2018-01-13 20:55:34 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa I am sorry for ranting ...it just seems like leaders don't have the real radical (to the root) changes in mind: they're just not into it. I don't know ...I agree with you. Maybe Greens need to help Progressives in getting into the Dem Party to reorganize the whole country.
952273235877482497 2018-01-13 20:16:46 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa They act like Bean counters without any real purpose.
952273110321025024 2018-01-13 20:16:16 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa What we need is SUSTAINABILTIY ...Dems and Republicans cannot figure that out.
952272872428523520 2018-01-13 20:15:19 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa I think that the agencies need to be reorganized around Environment with Interior as a part of it ...Separate out Native Affairs as its own agency
952272473399218181 2018-01-13 20:13:44 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa How can Michigan not have clean water to drink?
952272361440661504 2018-01-13 20:13:17 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa You know, these parties and turf wars ....I think that Greens are a movement that need to be heard and exercise their influence in America to prevent offshore drillling and ensure protection of the water etc. It's ridiculous ...where would we be without the Environment?
952254058244567041 2018-01-13 19:00:34 UTC <progenyzero> @Bill_Cimbrelo @RalphScenic @BarbaraAKelley LOL ...I have heard that mentioned before. I can't tell from the photos that I've seen.
952253767084363776 2018-01-13 18:59:24 UTC <progenyzero> @Bill_Cimbrelo @RalphScenic @BarbaraAKelley It was a joke. I agree with you ...should we still have LIFETIME appoints when LIFETIME is now, what double (maybe triple) than the expectancy back when the Constitution was written?
952252064612089857 2018-01-13 18:52:38 UTC <progenyzero> @MooPersists @lyndastrait @proviewsusa I started out talking about Sen. Sanders yet the same is true for all of the senators on that list ...IF the 2018 BlueWave happens, they need someone there in Congress to guide/support them.

952247136787353603 2018-01-13 18:33:03 UTC <progenyzero> @lyndastrait @MooPersists @proviewsusa YES!
952246164052639745 2018-01-13 18:29:12 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa @MooPersists @lyndastrait ...and truth, he hasnt decided yet to run in 2020 There are going to be a LOT of newbies in Congress ...he has to be torn on what to do, there again as an independent, he wouldn't be the majority whip which might be just as well, too. BIG DECISIONS
952245301758316545 2018-01-13 18:25:46 UTC <progenyzero> @lyndastrait @MooPersists @proviewsusa People are so into legacy-thinking wherein the party controlled people and told them to fall in line gave out 'marching orders' ...IT IS A NEW CENTURY.
952243857219096576 2018-01-13 18:20:02 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa @lyndastrait @MooPersists Again, I am nonpartisan ...I think that the BLUEinterests need to band together in a coalition, unless party is more important than country.
952242022185885696 2018-01-13 18:12:44 UTC <progenyzero> @funder I retweeted ...let odds are, if there are secrets to unfold ...it will be under Eric (I am sorry to say). Eric isn't 'the girl' and isn't the namesake/firstborn.
952240998066917377 2018-01-13 18:08:40 UTC <progenyzero> @elisesrn1 That's what I mean, if you look on that list ...the only one beyond the top two with a chance in Hell, so to speak ...is Cuomo. All the rest 8/10 times the response is going to be: WHO??? I'm sorry, it is just true.
952239631558430720 2018-01-13 18:03:14 UTC <progenyzero> @Bill_Cimbrelo @RalphScenic Not doable, by time Dem nomination is done, it would be too late to switch from Trump, if Trump is even a contender for 2020 ...I am not convinced on theat either. You have to keep track of Libertarians, too. Independents might surprise you...
952238924113547264 2018-01-13 18:00:25 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa @MooPersists TOTALLY ...this isn't 2nd-term president, which is last one Dem's won. 2018 all the way is your focus. Yet, if you are serious at all about 2020 ...things have to start moving forward fast. Libertarians are more organized than Dems at this point (and they have an opportunity).
952237864779239427 2018-01-13 17:56:13 UTC <progenyzero> @anjanadkumar Couric is not the watecooler gossip type ...I can believe it and I can guarantee that the Lauer types do not go after Couric of Streep types. He had his halo on around her.
952236731314688001 2018-01-13 17:51:43 UTC <progenyzero> @Bill_Cimbrelo They even had the CEO of Starbucks as a possible... I do not know what it means other than they want someone to control which leaves out most of the women in the world, right? 
952236257983238144 2018-01-13 17:49:50 UTC <progenyzero> @Bill_Cimbrelo Looking into the DNC crystal ball ...Biden is the guy for 2020. They are serious. This is a WAKEUP POLL, I don't have a stake in it as a nonpartisan. I agree with you: the poll does not reflect the conversations that I have heard through 2017.
952235564710924288 2018-01-13 17:47:04 UTC <progenyzero> @JustinTrudeau @EmmanuelMacron @proviewsusa @MooPersists @LisaClaire9090 Wait, are we thinking 'eye candy' or leadership? Truth: Women available, Oprah has the best shot. People are talking 'age' I really am NONPARTISAN, besides I feel that the military community should stay out of elections and let civilians decide who they want to lead them.

Next Congress should 'Just Say No' on foreign money to officials.

It makes the party look like they are bullying people who would want to participate. Was that your intention? #TheResistance
947319279447347200 2017-12-30 04:11:31 UTC <progenyzero> @justicedems @tomwatson There is no reason to tie @HillaryClinton campaign or @donnabrazile book, or @SenSanders campaign to whether @JusticeDems should be supported, unless you attempt deliberately to undermine them which is inept, tactically speaking: their appraoch to funding is highly transparent.pic.twitter.com/O8cnRnbv9G
947317849105854464 2017-12-30 04:05:50 UTC <progenyzero> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson 5 Reason for DNC not having money, essentially was poor management, hence allowing payback schedule from Obama team that flowed into the campaign cycle of the next candidate. There is a lot of detail, yet that is the gist. Let's move on TOGETHER.
947317431093071873 2017-12-30 04:04:10 UTC <progenyzero> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson 4 Everyone reported on both sides of it and that Brazile book use of 'rigged' gave an impression that was a bit misleading ALTHOUGH fairly exposing a bit of a conflict.
947317183964700673 2017-12-30 04:03:11 UTC <progenyzero> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson 3 Effectivel, because Clinton was overseeing expenditures ...there was a tilt toward her guidance, not designed to curtail SenSanders campaign, yet rather a conflict.
947316895660806144 2017-12-30 04:02:02 UTC <progenyzero> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson 2 Nutshell: DNC did not have funds to support Clinton. Clinton did fundraising and gave to DNC with the direction (in writing) that she would have some say-so over their expenditures which IMHO was correct, under the circumstances.
947316577145409536 2017-12-30 04:00:46 UTC <progenyzero> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson 1 This was 3/4 months ago ...WHY is this popping up again, with inaccuracy? OK so you are a DNC surrogate trying to throw sand on JusticeDems.. Everyone reported what the Brazile book said. DB herself corrected what she said and everyone else corrected, too.
947310725311188992 2017-12-30 03:37:31 UTC <progenyzero> @SethAbramson @pkelder_kelder I have to sort out these donations ...in some instances it is legal to receive the donations as long as they are reported it properly, I think. Foreign corporations landed in America can make donations. Concerns about Japanese often; others seem not scrutinized as closely.

I don't know what civilians call it, in the military we're all talk on DUE DILIGENCE. He could have been drowing puppies and they stood him up as 'their guy'. UNACCEPTABLE.
947291572802129920 2017-12-30 02:21:25 UTC <progenyzero> @SethAbramson @pkelder_kelder Yes,we have to know if GOP was complicit or at least aware. If yes, they need to be held accountable ...not the constituents who mistakenly put their faith in the party ...the RNC itself. We cannot allow them to get away with pinning everything on Trump.

Started to research statement, 'He thinks he doesn't have to follow the rules...' by looking at his Twitter. I found his response to report that included an apology for admitted wrong-doing.

944288630004178944 2017-12-22 19:28:48 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa 2 - THE MIDDLE WAY (very Buddhist), is Participatory Democracy which seems appropriate in our day, has mass appeal. I support establishing it, based on INCLUSION, not 'Identity Politics' that leaves DACAs and Puerto Rico an impression that only 'their community' would help them.
944287839671541760 2017-12-22 19:25:39 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa 1 - My thoughts are around context. Parties were conceived when many people couldn't read or write and exposure to political situations was very limited. Now, we have technology that can give citizens direct access. Greeks had direct democracy in Antiquity.
944283406875099136 2017-12-22 19:08:02 UTC <progenyzero> @proviewsusa I think that if, and I am NOT in favour of party politics at all, parties/politicians are going to continue as representatives, we have to find new ways to leverage them. Progressives are a bit tame for me, frankly. Yet, a step forward toward REFORM. Thanks.

So, there was no 'domestic dispute' it was a rejection, or an unrequitted love. Terms mean something, or they used to, or they should even legally. He took the risk of losing her by not committing.

928218163501850624 2017-11-08 11:10:30 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 8 - single mother who had to take a job at a dime store when her husband left her with three children. There again: the mother had money enough to help her if she quit the job (charity, right): she was too proud to ask
928217762014441472 2017-11-08 11:08:54 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 7 - I guess we can say, happily, those cases were involving adults, yet not all of them: people who were somehow vulnerable. First time I heard about this was a 40yr old woman who broke down and told mother that her boss was extorting her for sex to not be fired at work. Divorced
928217062513704960 2017-11-08 11:06:07 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 6 - Weinstein, Spacey, and the women who were paid off or quiet for decades... they have seen it before in their personal lives. I guarantee it. Jane Fonda: she was intimidated??? Gwenyth Paltrow. It is ridiculous.
928216632111108096 2017-11-08 11:04:25 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 5 - The children, boys and girls, take that into their hearts with immature minds and begin to accept violence, aggression as an acceptable way to interact with others. These people who we have seen in the news...
928216173954641920 2017-11-08 11:02:35 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 4 - HOWEVER. ...the recurring theme is men in their quest for dominance, even in domestic violence cases. Their are plenty of married women or girlfriends who take abuse or battery from their 'significant others'
928215640497950721 2017-11-08 11:00:28 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 3 - or even psychological problems that could be diagnosed (other than frustration), just hostility ...toward anyone: it doesn't matter who. It seems to be one cause behind the bullying in society, not just online.
928215140037808130 2017-11-08 10:58:29 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 2 - ...and opportunity we want in our core to do better than what is 'normal' elsewhere. Second, we tend to jump to WHY, the truth is that insecurity and alienation,despair cause a lot of hostility: not mental illness, insanity
928214460619161602 2017-11-08 10:55:47 UTC <progenyzero> @Shoshanna6 1 - Yes ...Americans are no different than everyone else: many cultures do not talk about these things or think of them as 'normal' everyday occurrences. However, as Americans we have the expectation of each other to do better ...with all of our richness in environment
