Plus it's something that's glossed over in history and people need to know how awful it was for Japanese-Americans at that time. Germans & Italians were fine which proves how racist it was.
967657495656386560 2018-02-24 07:08:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @GeorgeTakei @cat_justrsistin I miss a lot of Broadway shows due to time and money, so am really happy this one worked out.

It wasn't a perfect show, but the message was very very powerful. It was also wonderful to see that a very large percentage of the audience was Asian.)

967655994334564353 2018-02-24 07:02:21 UTC <total_janarchy> @GeorgeTakei @cat_justrsistin He also needs to be tied to a chair and forced to watch the musical "Allegiance" which George helped produce and starred in. It's heartbreaking.
967655545934147584 2018-02-24 07:00:34 UTC <total_janarchy> @sarahchad_ They need to ask @GeorgeTakei about being marched off to camps. He might have a story or two to tell them.

963298391919939584 2018-02-12 06:26:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @JuliusGoat @SGSFOX Thank you for your kind words. Even with Medicaid picking up about 50% of the payments, my dad's care wiped out most of my parents savings. He worked and save his whole life as did my mom. It's horrible. No one should have to face these dilemmas.

My ex was an abusive s.o.b. and we have mutual friends who have only met him recently and keep trying to convince me he is really sincere and remorseful about are breakup etc. I then ask them if he mentioned his threats to me etc.
961859057765179398 2018-02-08 07:07:24 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid Thankfully much of our military is like "aw, hell, NO". (Not necessarily the asskissers at the Pentago). None of my friends who are veterans are down with this even as a consideration.

961692692328611845 2018-02-08 20:06:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @The_Arn Precisely. Sometime people need to understand that there's beauty on simpler things. It doesn't have to always be sex and violence. I'm no prude, but not everything needs to be Deadpool or Ash vs the Evil Dead. Star Wars should be PG-13 or less.

958892136279298050 2018-01-31 02:37:55 UTC <total_janarchy> I love how RWNJs and LWNJs think that calling me "Wonder Woman" is some kind of insult. Try again, assholes.pic.twitter.com/6sGZxCssKC

958398471823912961 2018-01-30 17:56:16 UTC <total_janarchy> @MadisonKittay I know. I am more than aware of the gravity of our situation as a country right now. I don't have the ability to do more than make calls and even that is difficult right now.
958398103161311233 2018-01-30 17:54:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn @HenrySanchez Don't tell him what to do. It's his social media, and he'll do whatever he wants. don't like it? Don't follow.

958397534929588227 2018-01-30 17:52:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @realDonaldTrump @WillieGarson I'm still mourning the loss of my father last week. The last thing I want is that putz on my tv.
958397179080581122 2018-01-30 17:51:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @MadisonKittay Thank you. He wasn't in great health, but this came out of nowhere regardless. I am tired of being told my grief doesn't matter because of everything else going on right now. Some of us *cannot* drop everything and run to a march.
958396916492054528 2018-01-30 17:50:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @metellaporcia Thank you. I hope he is in peace too. Part of what killed him was this current administration and the state of this country. It doesn't mean I am capable of protesting or doing very much of anything right now, and I am tired of people screaming at me about it.
