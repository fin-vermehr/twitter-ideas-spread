Plus it's something that's glossed over in history and people need to know how awful it was for Japanese-Americans at that time. Germans & Italians were fine which proves how racist it was.

It wasn't a perfect show, but the message was very very powerful. It was also wonderful to see that a very large percentage of the audience was Asian.)

967655545934147584 2018-02-24 07:00:34 UTC <total_janarchy> @sarahchad_ They need to ask @GeorgeTakei about being marched off to camps. He might have a story or two to tell them.

963298391919939584 2018-02-12 06:26:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @JuliusGoat @SGSFOX Thank you for your kind words. Even with Medicaid picking up about 50% of the payments, my dad's care wiped out most of my parents savings. He worked and save his whole life as did my mom. It's horrible. No one should have to face these dilemmas.

961692692328611845 2018-02-08 20:06:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @The_Arn Precisely. Sometime people need to understand that there's beauty on simpler things. It doesn't have to always be sex and violence. I'm no prude, but not everything needs to be Deadpool or Ash vs the Evil Dead. Star Wars should be PG-13 or less.

953738184575287298 2018-01-17 21:17:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @intouchweekly @EdKrassen Not even remotely surprising though. The incestuous vibes have been strong between those two for years (and if it's true, I honestly do feel sorry for Ivanka on that level)
953737762825437189 2018-01-17 21:16:16 UTC <total_janarchy> I always enjoyed watching @Alyssa_Milano on television. Unlike the Orange Oaf OR Sebastian Gorka.
953737492506775552 2018-01-17 21:15:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet Me, repeatedly. Like I told you elsewhere, I was told to lie about my MS because it would be 'intimidating'. I wonder how many men are told to lie about their graduate degrees.

953164790758871040 2018-01-15 07:19:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @eclecticbrotha And why is @TomPerez still allowing these people to be a part of our party again?
952780305689202688 2018-01-14 05:51:41 UTC <total_janarchy> I know a few artists/cartoonists who should know about this! :Dhttps://twitter.com/carlreiner/status/952778572946538497
952763005405720577 2018-01-14 04:42:56 UTC <total_janarchy> @BadASSSery @EdKrassen Good question. He cheated repeatedly on Ivana and left her for Marla Maples. He cheated on Marla repeatedly. So not a huge shock he also cheated on Melania too.
952761510325096453 2018-01-14 04:37:00 UTC <total_janarchy> If all you can do it attack Democrats rather than Republicans, and bitch about how they're not doing what YOU want without being aware of what is being done, then you are not part of my #Resistance
952759557457104896 2018-01-14 04:29:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @docrocktex26 Precisely. Also you don't have to have a degree in psychology or psychiatry to see that someone is mentally ill, even if you lack the ability to diagnose. If someone is coughing up blood, you know they're sick w/out being an MD. *sigh*
952697988811456512 2018-01-14 00:24:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @docrocktex26 That's utter b.s. -- the majority of my family are professionals in the mental health field, and they are very capable of diagnoses without 'proper evaluation'. Malignant narcissism and delusional behaviour can be diagnosed by observation. You don't need a blood test.

952692120405663744 2018-01-14 00:01:16 UTC <total_janarchy> @GrassrootsSpeak This is a good primer on what the Dems *are* doing.   https://twitter.com/i/moments/905543312299446272
952691347961663488 2018-01-14 23:58:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @JuliusGoat I just had to explain to someone why two other GOP senators would never switch sides to speak out against DJT for the same reasons. *sigh*
952689802163482624 2018-01-14 23:52:03 UTC <total_janarchy> @GrassrootsSpeak They have called for plenty of investigations but their collective hands are tied. Without being in the majority or having support across the aisle, they can't magically make this happen. Do you not understand how this works?
952689326600663040 2018-01-14 23:50:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @GrassrootsSpeak Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowksi are full of crap given they happily voted for the #GOPTaxScam & haven't spoken out against Trump at all.  The Dems are doing everything they can with their limited power.  Again, they're the minority party and are limited in what they can do.
952601296107950081 2018-01-14 18:00:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @GrassrootsSpeak Without meaning to be antagonistic, what do you think they can actually do to remove him as the minority party with no GOP support?
952560586927337473 2018-01-14 15:18:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @GrassrootsSpeak Most people I know in the Resistance are Democrats. What else would they be?
952559524543647745 2018-01-14 15:14:23 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet I actually did volunteer social media work for him. I cannot tell you how much I regret that now. Disappointed doesn't begun to cover it.
952500343522385920 2018-01-14 11:19:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @jfreewright Precisely. Also the fact that nothing has leaked that he didn't want out... months later is telling. As well as proving the loyalty of the people working with him and under him. Unlike the shithole in Chief.

952251688563429376 2018-01-13 18:51:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @WhovianFeminism @gallifreyone @snazdoll That probably ought to be enough. Unfortunately you missed their 200 for the price of 100 plus free shipping sale which ended 31 Dec. Although the shipping was probably US only.

952185135679655937 2018-01-13 14:26:41 UTC <total_janarchy> @JuliusGoat I would argue that in this case saying someone who was given the presidency thanks to foreign interference is not only on the my president, but not anyone's. Speaking for only myself I say it because I will resist him and fight for what's right. I refuse to be associated w/him
952184146423623688 2018-01-13 14:22:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @gallifreyone @snazdoll I do indeed! I usually get 100 -200 done at a time, but I always have several designs so they last longer. I highly recommend Ribbons Galore. They're a little more expensive but the quality and great customer service is worth it.

952181845415821323 2018-01-13 14:13:37 UTC <total_janarchy> A lot of people are sick because of this. Plus a nasty flu strain. I got sick because of that and our boiler dying the Sunday after Thanksgiving and my having to clean up a huge flood of water in a 40 degree house.
952181174054551553 2018-01-13 14:10:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @Donna_West Oh, I don't know. Maybe we need to see more evidence before we make that determination. (sarcasm)

950120479452487681 2018-01-07 21:42:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @DavidCornDC I don't think sitting senators should be traitors to the US Constitution, Lindsey.
950119779066630144 2018-01-07 21:39:42 UTC <total_janarchy> @rtalalay But of course. *eyeroll* Don't you (and the rest of us in the mespuchah) run the industry anyway, so automatically ruin it? (/Heavy sarcasm)

949956970802569216 2018-01-07 10:52:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @JuddLegum He went to Fordham for two years prior to transfering to U of P. While Fordham is a good school (my grandfather who WAS a genius went there) it's not 'the best college' by a long shot. He likes to forget about that.
949955352061272064 2018-01-07 10:46:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid @justkeri @KeithLeBlanc63 You would be wrong on all three accounts. Especially the first two. Most voters of color will not support either of them, not to mention they're both far too old.

890000230497824768 2017-07-25 00:06:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @Achbee @JoyAnnReid @philosophrob @In_My_Tree Nah. "We're gonna hold our breath until we get what we want."
889999577104994309 2017-07-25 00:03:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Typical. Men stealing a woman's work and slapping their own name in it.
889954736195194881 2017-07-25 21:05:18 UTC <total_janarchy> @ggreeneva But her health care plan wasn't good enough. Until Bernie stole it and started spouting it as his own.
889671903874625537 2017-07-24 02:21:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Thank you. I watched He-Man pretty regularly, She-ra not so much.
889394502397571073 2017-07-24 07:59:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Maybe he should have worn glasses like Clark Kent. That would've fooled them. She-Ra and Princess Whatsit were the same situation.
889394177565437952 2017-07-24 07:57:50 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet If Scott Baio and Marco Rubio had a baby. Which wouldn't happen because Republicans don't believe in same sex anything.

889285913435660288 2017-07-23 00:47:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera He's my Senator and I'm furious. He's also dumped Mr I'm Not A Democrat on us.

888916756873568256 2017-07-22 00:20:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @prettyh It might come to that. Assuming I can get out of here at all. (Please annex NY, please annex NY...)

887245954767884289 2017-07-18 09:41:34 UTC <total_janarchy> @ThePandoraBoxx The myth that they can't is precisely that -- a myth. Some of the most sexist shit I've ever heard has come from other women.

887140754564554752 2017-07-17 02:43:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera It depends on whether you like time travel related historical Romance novels set in Scotland. I gave up in middle of book 4. After S1 on tv

886913255746174976 2017-07-17 11:39:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @cmclymer He was actually listed as appearing this season so it wasn't a shock to me. He was good though.

886827205019521026 2017-07-16 05:57:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @cmclymer He was surprisingly good. I just want to know how Tyrion's song suddenly made the Westeros Top 10 charts!
886826996243861504 2017-07-16 05:56:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @clapifyoulikeme I'm sure their Palestinian friends would be very happy to support SlutWalk and what they stand for.
886826532357984256 2017-07-16 05:54:56 UTC <total_janarchy> @prettyh That was far more queasy-inducing that anything else on the show for me.
886826398484234240 2017-07-16 05:54:24 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid No one ever said they ended *well* though.
886826094720102402 2017-07-16 05:53:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera @dingalingy55 Viking women had children too. They were still warriors.
886825942424977408 2017-07-16 05:52:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera The Northern women and the Freefolk (and the Dornish) are far smarter than the rest of the World-os combined.
886825745787609088 2017-07-16 05:51:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shaker_aphra I was waiting (and hoping) for someone to make that joke.
886825446381412352 2017-07-16 05:50:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @CHIMPSINSOCKS @Rakpenguin63 @Tim3112 An alien changing shape, size, color, hair color, voice, eye color, accent etc is acceptable, but swapping genders is just too far? Really?
886825180139573249 2017-07-16 05:49:34 UTC <total_janarchy> @CHIMPSINSOCKS Thank you! Thank you so much! (You were on my short list of women Doctors, btw)
886824835636224002 2017-07-16 05:48:11 UTC <total_janarchy> @jfreewright I think he wouldn't last 11 minutes, let alone 11 hours.
886824730728255489 2017-07-16 05:47:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @prettyh Nope. It's him. He and Maisie are friends, and he's a big fan. They've been talking that up for a while.
886824577787154432 2017-07-16 05:47:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Thank you. I thought it looked familiar. So that means it may have dragonglass properties too. I think in the books it had a dragonbone hilt
886824223066513408 2017-07-16 05:45:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid Arya is my favourite character in books and on the show. She's the best. (Who wouldn't want to be a teenage ninja shapeshifting assassin?)
886823694961717249 2017-07-16 05:43:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera That and "Am I the only person in the world who isn't watching this show?" No. No, you're not. So shut up and let us enjoy things.
886823508130627586 2017-07-16 05:42:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera I want them as co-rulers since I think they compliment one another, and yanno, Targaryens, so it's cool. Plus she is Fire, and he is Ice.
886822892528422912 2017-07-16 05:40:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @isteintraum Can we find the lemmings a cliff to run off of, please?
886822449140158464 2017-07-16 05:38:42 UTC <total_janarchy> @Cheryllynn512 Whee! YES!
886738571826266112 2017-07-16 00:05:24 UTC <total_janarchy> @RealMattLucas  Sadly we should have had a female president but... yeah.
886738370948366336 2017-07-16 00:04:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @RealMattLucas I know, right? Why couldn't we get a sexy Android instead?!
886727361437290498 2017-07-16 23:20:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @The_Arn Definitely! I still need to find her doing more than heavy drama. For my own sanity.
886727051679551489 2017-07-16 23:19:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @owillis The point is there are more people in the center than in the fringes. Bell curve. And a fringe left candidate will not win. Look at McGovern
886726730391707648 2017-07-16 23:18:21 UTC <total_janarchy> @Babybadness_ @owillis @WraithKenny Which hasn't been the case in 40 years but keep trying.
886726470881742848 2017-07-16 23:17:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @The_Arn Yep. I'm just hoping he writes her well. I'm still nervous about that!

886726038650277889 2017-07-16 23:15:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @snazdoll A dear friend's 11 year old daughter burst out into tears of happiness. That says it all.
886725796517335040 2017-07-16 23:14:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @snazdoll I hope this means you'll get to write for her!! 
886526578209038336 2017-07-16 10:03:01 UTC <total_janarchy> @E11iotChapman *fans self* Sweet dreams are made of this!
886526497007206401 2017-07-16 10:02:42 UTC <total_janarchy> @bravenak @sukatra Or Hillary directly.
886526273731874818 2017-07-16 10:01:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @WillieGarson Well, you don't expect them to have shitty insurance, do you? That's different!
886526162872172544 2017-07-16 10:01:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @rtalalay Happiest of birthdays!
886526057301540865 2017-07-16 10:00:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @E11iotChapman It's way too late (early) in NY so mea culpa. Then definitely no arguments from me. I'd prefer Rigg to Pertwee anyway (blasphemy, I know)
886525500948086786 2017-07-16 09:58:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @E11iotChapman I would say Lumley would've been far better in the 80s or early 90s than in 1970, but other than that, no argument from me.

886287481829765120 2017-07-15 18:12:56 UTC <total_janarchy> @richarddinnick Ok, works for me! (You know, don't you? )
886247533021888513 2017-07-15 15:34:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @richarddinnick The White Cliffs of Dover and the sands in wherever are female?  Not that i'd mind if 13 was a woman. Is obelisk w/key an actual landmark?
886246639807148040 2017-07-15 15:30:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @richarddinnick You know the answer to this, don't you?
886246188168753154 2017-07-15 15:28:51 UTC <total_janarchy> @isteintraum Well, you know, because...penis.
886245500432855040 2017-07-15 15:26:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera I've been put in Twitter jail several times just for dropping a few f-bombs. Glad to know it's okay to threaten people though. Right on it.
886245211592171521 2017-07-15 15:24:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @snazdoll I'm so glad to know this. I'll stop my attempts at it them. I must've failed at it because of lady parts.
885704567064846337 2017-07-13 03:36:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @ManMadeMoon Ditto. I once 'had' to watch it in a film analysis and interp class. It was fun to dissect it too.
885497443718189056 2017-07-13 13:53:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz What the actual fuck?
885398288932929536 2017-07-13 07:19:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @CoryBooker The two of you need to go out on the road together -- you're a great comedy duo *and* great Senators.
885398172943745024 2017-07-13 07:19:08 UTC <total_janarchy> These two need a show of their own. @CoryBooker & @brianschatz tell you to http://goffyourself.com #NetNeutrality @LastWeekTonight websitehttps://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/885145015898570752

885299835984891906 2017-07-12 00:48:23 UTC <total_janarchy> @TomPerez But your pal Bernie is against "identity politics". When are you dumping him?!
885298915553280000 2017-07-12 00:44:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @joanwalsh Racist, sexist and ageist. Sadly can't tell if they're a Trumper or a Bro.
885298222285115392 2017-07-12 00:41:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @WillieGarson I can't even with these people.
885262697998286848 2017-07-12 22:20:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @bravenak @JKH2 @ashtonpittman @jdhughez Jarred still has his hooks in the Observer. Of course they're going to write shit like this.
885262115573051393 2017-07-12 22:18:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @ezlusztig BoB types are still claiming there is no proof. How many of them are actually bots?
885259428567666688 2017-07-12 22:07:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @Fairy_Gmother Thanks, doll.
885257927816359938 2017-07-12 22:01:51 UTC <total_janarchy> @SueTheFury Anything/anyone in particular you're looking for? I'd definitely be interested!
885257162343292928 2017-07-12 21:58:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @ezlusztig But if she had, Pooty poo had more tricks up his sleeve to continue to hamstring her. With help from his other pal (BS)
885256886186106881 2017-07-12 21:57:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @EdPlunkett Every time we think it can't get worse...
885256734339739648 2017-07-12 21:57:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Answer: Yes.
885256592123461632 2017-07-12 21:56:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @yokoono @seanonolennon That doesn't quite help those of us who have the issue of, um, huge tracts of land. Measurements would be helpful (at least in future!) 
885250736413712385 2017-07-12 21:33:17 UTC <total_janarchy> @yokoono @isteintraum I would too. Her instructions on decisions would be epic. Plus she's wise.
885250108828286977 2017-07-12 21:30:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @isteintraum Supreme Court Justice @yokoono (she would actually be amazing)
885249721496985601 2017-07-12 21:29:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @GeorgiaMoffett Ask @Fairy_Gmother She knows all things! Welcome!
885248876004986881 2017-07-12 21:25:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @chucktodd Maybe you should have thought of that LAST year instead of whining about someone else being "over prepared" and "unpopular".
885248622991953921 2017-07-12 21:24:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff 3. Definitely 3. I'm lactose intolerant but even that wouldn't make me as ill as the current 'administration' has since November.
885248341579354112 2017-07-12 21:23:46 UTC <total_janarchy> You throw shade like a pro, @ChelseaClinton and this is why we love you!
885247941283373056 2017-07-12 21:22:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @yokoono @seanonolennon Is there a size chart anywhere for the shirts? I really want to get one but I want to make sure I get one that fits. Thanks!

885028048151687168 2017-07-11 06:48:24 UTC <total_janarchy> @bravenak "Let's not rush to judgements," he says. But it was okay to judge Obama and Hillary and other Democrats.
884647353214521344 2017-07-10 05:35:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @isteintraum He's such a sleaze bag himself. I've never liked him.

884643716627144704 2017-07-10 05:21:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @WillieGarson I'm sure his base will claim it's all a big misunderstanding. Or blame Obama.
884536062755958785 2017-07-10 22:13:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera I am so amazed and impressed that she can throw shade so brilliantly every single time. I couldn't.
884535796891627520 2017-07-10 22:12:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @WillieGarson I'm betting stupid because I doubt his wife would let him get stoned.
884535683196518400 2017-07-10 22:11:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid Then he too should be investigated (if he had actually done it). How stupid are these morons?

860299620269903872 2017-05-04 01:06:27 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 It's the @chrislhayes show starring Bernie Sanders, written and produced by Bernie Sanders.
860299379713998852 2017-05-04 01:05:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @ydnam As you should be. If there's anything I can do to help downstate, let me know.
860266981630541825 2017-05-04 22:56:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @HouseGOP @RepTomSuozzi thank you!
860266902786117634 2017-05-04 22:56:27 UTC <total_janarchy> @RepTomSuozzi thank you for doing the right thing and voting against this #AHCA abomination.
860266373095837696 2017-05-04 22:54:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @RepTomReed @ydnam I love you.
860264215910789120 2017-05-04 22:45:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 as if both if them weren't instrumental in trying to get something for the uninsured and sick.
860263932614897665 2017-05-04 22:44:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @HouseGOP @SenWarren maybe you ought to focus in this instead of attacking @BarackObama for doing his thing?
860255379846041602 2017-05-04 22:10:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @HillaryClinton @swingleft we warned them, YOU warned them, and they didn't listen.
860255094704672769 2017-05-04 22:09:32 UTC <total_janarchy> New strategy: anytime anyone drops the term "neo-liberal", I'm calling them out as a neo-fauxgressive. Both mean absolutely nothing.

860230488446963714 2017-05-04 20:31:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Wtf is neoliberalism other than a made up buzz word the neo-fauxgressives slap on anything they don't like?
860230096883511296 2017-05-04 20:30:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @EdPlunkett I'd like them to all choke on a bag of their own dicks.

859915027981234177 2017-05-03 23:38:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @SenWarren don't expect me to support you when you run for your seat. It would be a distasteful use of my money.https://twitter.com/Eviljohna/status/859655261761544194
859914767292661761 2017-05-03 23:37:11 UTC <total_janarchy> @SenWarren @BernieSanders @JKH2 @HelenELais The Pope is already smart enough to know what a good guy BO is. Mr BS? Not so much. Warren can sit down too.
859914370196934656 2017-05-03 23:35:36 UTC <total_janarchy> Thank you @RepTomSuozzi for saying you'll vote 'No' on the ACA bill tomorrow! Keep on fighting for us! #NY03
859913836459110401 2017-05-03 23:33:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @SenWarren @BernieSanders @JKH2 @HelenELais Maybe if BO took a trip to stalk the Pope he'd get more acceptance.
859858340935073792 2017-05-03 19:52:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 You can always tell Berners and Trumpets by their unbelievable spelling & grammar skills. No, wait, the other thing.
859856736844468224 2017-05-03 19:46:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @wirebutterfly @kenrar Because they're bunnies. It's what they were created for. Cuteness! 
859856463174541312 2017-05-03 19:45:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist I ignore him. He's still smarting because she chose Bill over him. He's an idiot.
859856074781970437 2017-05-03 19:43:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @SallyAlbright Oh yes. And the Berners are already crying about how mean people are being. They have no idea what's coming.
859855800281509891 2017-05-03 19:42:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist And he's a fellow Jew I'd happily support.
859855170360004611 2017-05-03 19:40:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @SenWarren @BernieSanders @JKH2 Oh no! More distasteful use of their money! *clutches pearls* Better to buy a third house!
859644129432809473 2017-05-02 05:41:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @andreastarreese I'd love to see @chrislhayes stop having Bernie Sanders on, asking *HIM* about the election over & over again. That's Chris's fap material.
859643102629376000 2017-05-02 05:37:41 UTC <total_janarchy> @chrislhayes @FromTheLeftShow @Cgw459Cindi @barbvas And @maddow and @Lawrence non-stop. Rachel was giddy when she had Jane Sanders on. Then there was the never ending Jeff Weaver lovefest.
859640207192330241 2017-05-02 05:26:11 UTC <total_janarchy> That question is rhetorical, right? Because we know the answer to that.
859639573282000897 2017-05-02 05:23:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @ilyseh What the hell is @NancyPelosi thinking? How can this even be a consideration?
859595315325829120 2017-05-02 02:27:48 UTC <total_janarchy> Look who's whinging again. Poor misunderstood put upon bunny. My heart bleeds.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/859573989840220160

859593421715111936 2017-05-02 02:20:16 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist And pretending you know what it's like to be a regular American as you collect a 6 figure salary
859592767718260738 2017-05-02 02:17:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist Because Coulter is/was his fuck buddy. Hillary is too classy for him.
859572352874672128 2017-05-02 00:56:33 UTC <total_janarchy> Just when I thought @chrislhayes got a clue, he proves I'm wrong bc he treats @finneyk like a dick about @HillaryClinton .
859570030828236800 2017-05-02 00:47:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz All of this. They all aided and abetted Trump, and blamed her. I've yet to see any of the MSM take responsibility for their collusion.
859569045640802325 2017-05-02 00:43:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @GeorgeTakei Of course. Even if I'm only straight--ish.

859492279207292928 2017-05-02 19:38:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @DavidCornDC Nope. Nor is debatable that the CNN staff discussing it are either deaf or stupid.b
859490868314636288 2017-05-02 19:32:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @wolfblitzer @JoyAnnReid @teresainnj Plus they somehow missed the words "I take total responsibility".
859489572044111874 2017-05-02 19:27:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid And this is why I love you. You are actually living in the real world, unlike many of your colleagues.
859489225921765377 2017-05-02 19:26:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz Idiots on CNN were the same. Blitzer threw in crap about Wisconsin. More alternate facts.
859244457874644994 2017-05-01 03:13:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar That is so cool. And I thought 2 and 4 track mag tape was tricky!
859244274126336000 2017-05-01 03:12:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Now it's all digital and sampling and pretty easy to find a noise you want.
859244209307619328 2017-05-01 03:12:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Old analog tech is actually really cool. One of the reasons I still love my 60s music is that they had to do w/stone knives and bear skins
859244008673083392 2017-05-01 03:11:50 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar That's a bummer. It really used to be fun and creative. Now I'm boring as shit. I can't even manage to do interesting playlists on my iPod
859243837037957120 2017-05-01 03:11:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar With people I didnt even necessarily know. It was fun.
859243769677438976 2017-05-01 03:10:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I don't think there's anything I listen to now that would be interesting. It's kind of depressing. I used to be involved w/tape exchanges
859243557806362625 2017-05-01 03:10:02 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I don't know her at all but will check into her.
859036186534449154 2017-05-01 13:26:01 UTC <total_janarchy> I care!https://twitter.com/Justitia2018/status/859033611215003648
858940128353550336 2017-05-01 07:04:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @RuPaulsDragCon Squeeeeeeeeeeeee! I am so there.
858938843290095616 2017-04-30 06:59:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I used to get George Formby tracks from Napster back in the day. 1940s comic ukulele songs. Before the Uke was *the* hipster instrument.
858937497656733697 2017-04-30 06:53:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I should get more recs from you. I miss the days of people trading cassettes and mixes. That was always a good way to find new music too.
858937328517222400 2017-04-30 06:53:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar She's also pretty different than my usual. More country than ROCK although I think there's a strong Stevie Nicks influence and I love her.
858937183524270080 2017-04-30 06:52:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar About the only really new person I've discovered is Karen Elson who isn't THAT new, but she's fantastic. I need to get her first album now.
858937054914387968 2017-04-30 06:52:06 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Agreed.
858930538417201152 2017-04-30 06:26:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar She's got a ton of talent but the culture stuff makes my brain bleed along with the plastic surgery etc. She's younger'n me.
858930402823733248 2017-04-30 06:25:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I have a lot of friends who somehow know all these bands. I should ask for more recs but I just don't know anyone anymore.
858929127516143616 2017-04-30 06:20:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I've only heard assorted songs, probably wouldn't know them if I heard them again. I'm not even being old -- no one plays new music anymore
858928892148690945 2017-04-30 06:19:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Yeah, I am kind of over them now, and she annoys me these days. I liked them early on though.
858926513458208768 2017-04-30 06:10:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Yeah, that makes sense. Like Green Day too, I guess. Unfortunately NY bands like Taking Back Sunday or Wheatus never really grabbed me.
858926060708167681 2017-04-30 06:08:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I actually love(d) No Doubt. They were a great band although I never saw them live.
858925812673900544 2017-04-30 06:07:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar And this is why I love you.
858921968334245889 2017-04-30 05:52:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Okay, I might be laughing at that. In a 'isn't that adorable' way.
858921797722533888 2017-04-30 05:51:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Hey, whatever gets you there. I've never been a purist. I was lucky to start with Sex Pistols because that's all there was when I was 13!
858921582940626944 2017-04-30 05:50:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Mainly because local radio went to hell and there was no real options to hear newer bands etc.
858921449456881664 2017-04-30 05:50:06 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I'm not a punk purist so if they're catchy, I'll listen to them. I just sort of stopped listening to newer acts around the turn of century
858920820562898944 2017-04-30 05:47:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I honestly didn't know. Now I have to check out Alkaline Trio.
858920708788891648 2017-04-30 05:47:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I never cared for either of them. The whole later pop punk thing was too much for me. I sort of drew line at Green Day (who I still like).
858919783378685952 2017-04-30 05:43:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist @Sunnysgrl62 I just read that as "keeping her in the golden SHOWER". I am going to hell. #sorrynotsorry

858918804243591169 2017-04-30 05:39:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Frank Zummo is a drummer. He used to be part of @thenewno2. I am old and stupid and mistook Blink-182 for Sum 41. (he's with the latter now)
858918128406978560 2017-04-30 05:36:54 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera What kind of drugs are they taking at the NYT?
858783654796972032 2017-04-30 20:42:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @snazdoll @clapifyoulikeme Same. I she'd no tears over Nazis getting punched. It's what they're there for. Other than kicking.
858783382645469184 2017-04-30 20:41:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar So is Frank Zumo.
858783210548887552 2017-04-30 20:40:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @clapifyoulikeme I am for the punch because @snazdoll is awesome. The Pearl clutchers need a fainting couch.
858782967153520640 2017-04-30 20:39:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @erikaheidewald It's like the assholes who try to tell me that Pepe was meant ironically and it's just a joke. It's been coopted. It's no longer funny.

858483716343156737 2017-04-29 00:50:42 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid The never ending campaign. It's pathetic.
858483495093624834 2017-04-29 00:49:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @sukatra Nah, it's all that economic dissatisfaction by white working class people. Just ask Bernie!
858480052362764288 2017-04-29 00:36:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @HillaryClinton @sukatra They're painfully predictable.
858477523755249664 2017-04-29 00:26:06 UTC <total_janarchy> @sukatra I'm sure they'll find a way of blaming @HillaryClinton, the DNC, and rewriting reality. As they always do.
858476957402636288 2017-04-29 00:23:51 UTC <total_janarchy> @sukatra @eclecticbrotha I'm sure he has a lot of "black friends" so it proves he's not a racist. Or an asshole. Oh, wait...
858476724203307008 2017-04-29 00:22:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @sadydoyle @ENG122501THOB Like other liberal Catholics: scores of Kennedys, John Kerry, Joe Biden, & Cuomos, Kaine said his personal beliefs didn't count over choice.
858476277866663938 2017-04-29 00:21:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @sadydoyle @scooniepenn He's not used to actually being, yanno, vetted. Or criticised. Poor baby.
858475647269842944 2017-04-29 00:18:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 His wife, of course, got paid $200k for bilking and bankrupting a college and making sure her daughter got paid too.
858475404801265664 2017-04-29 00:17:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 @RoughAcres The trip to Rome was in fact paid by his campaign. As was the $800k a month to Tad Devine.
858474891489812482 2017-04-29 00:15:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 He also didn't do jack until he was 40. OR vote. But as a white working class man, he's totally qualified to judge everyone, right?
858474361447165954 2017-04-29 00:13:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou One wishes they were referring to Ivanka but...

858446515890683909 2017-04-29 22:22:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz Getting $200k as golden parachute after bankrupting a college *and* having your husband lean on a bank for loans more distasteful IMHO

857036632817627141 2017-04-25 01:00:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @thenation @janeosanders @sasha_a_fox Well, yanno, she and her husband are the arbiters of what is/isn't progressive. So their Bros & Broettes would know.
857036200619671554 2017-04-25 00:58:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @thenation @janeosanders You would know about hypocrisy, wouldn't you, Jane? Where are your taxes? Still looking for those? Women, PoC & the LGBT comm see you.
857035496832339970 2017-04-25 00:56:00 UTC <total_janarchy> @janeosanders @SallyAlbright @DemocracyValues @BernieDidThis Thin skinned just like her old man. Can dish it out, but can't take it. Oh, and not a Democrat.
857035072242933762 2017-04-25 00:54:18 UTC <total_janarchy> @ezlusztig @yashar Someone get him a box of tissues and a bottle of lotion.
857033874748133376 2017-04-25 00:49:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @janeosanders @SallyAlbright @DemocracyValues i wonder how fast she can block them all. 
857033546762006528 2017-04-25 00:48:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn @AKlay19 James is on record as saying nothing after 1979 will ever be on the soundtracks. My mistake re: taken year.
856986608960249858 2017-04-25 21:41:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @tribelaw This is why you're one of my legal heroes.
856986438600187904 2017-04-25 21:41:03 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist @erikaheidewald I fail to see how anyone thinks Chelsea is unattractive, but obviously that's not the point.
856986259591495682 2017-04-25 21:40:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @Pearlie_mack @snazdoll What a gorgeous photo! I knew you were a fab writer, but not how adorable you were. Trifecta of crushes here now! :D
856985885874769920 2017-04-25 21:38:51 UTC <total_janarchy> @tomwatson @wastedtime01 The Nation provides actual facts vs fake news, political correctness & hypocrisy. (She blocked me on my other account for exact same thing)
856985584845377537 2017-04-25 21:37:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou @tomwatson Why yes, the Nation does offer up political correctness and hypocrisy.
856761824917716993 2017-04-24 06:48:31 UTC <total_janarchy> @ChelseaClinton @clapifyoulikeme What's next? He'll ask her what she's wearing? God, these supposed journalists are creepy AF.
856760928158744576 2017-04-24 06:44:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @ByronTau I own hundreds of them. Have you ever cracked one, let alone read one? She's not your monkey. Leave her alone.
856759127649001473 2017-04-24 06:37:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem I'm embarrassed to admit I liked CU's show in MSNBC a long long time ago. I got better!
856758545752240128 2017-04-24 06:35:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem *smirks* I keep being told about how influential they are and why I need to listen to them or else. Ugh.
856751867417829376 2017-04-24 06:08:57 UTC <total_janarchy> Ooooh this is very interesting.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/856750535633973248
856751557504880640 2017-04-24 06:07:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem But I thought they were so important and popular and powerful...
856713639906226176 2017-04-24 03:37:03 UTC <total_janarchy> Brilliant words as ever from Melissa McEwan.https://twitter.com/Shakestweetz/status/856713233150947328
856712257010626560 2017-04-24 03:31:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz @ChelseaClinton I'm sorry these asshats are so obsessed with you. You deserve so much better.
856709801518268418 2017-04-24 03:21:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @BFriedmanDC @RandyHauser And all those Kennedys. All 500 of them.
856709304858140674 2017-04-24 03:19:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn @AKlay19 Given that Peter is taken in 1979 right after Meredith died, it makes no sense there would be.
856552285962477568 2017-04-24 16:55:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz He knows as much about econ as he does about foreign policy. In other words, bupkis.
856551862375469057 2017-04-24 16:54:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @BarackObama @JoyAnnReid What a concept!
856551315442479104 2017-04-24 16:52:02 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid Remember when we had an intelligent, well spoken, competent man as President?
856549713805549571 2017-04-24 16:45:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @mmpadellan @LeChatNoire4 @TheDrewCrew @Cheryllynn512 I was laughing so hard I was weeping last night. And then weeping outright. I love John Oliver.
856371214889209859 2017-04-23 04:56:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @Cheryllynn512 You know me too well. :D
855686962417733636 2017-04-22 07:37:24 UTC <total_janarchy> @Cheryllynn512 I love this performance. And my boyfriend Dhani's reaction to it is just adorable. 
855461901270228992 2017-04-21 16:43:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet Sounds very familiar.  2000 people in sample supposedly.
855296114928492545 2017-04-20 05:44:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet It's just bizarre because no one can actually find out who they are, let alone anything about the poll IF it even is true.
855294024869003265 2017-04-20 05:36:00 UTC <total_janarchy> @BellaDonna810 @adirado29 I actually knew about the essays. That was sarcasm on my part but it didn't translate. Thanks for the link anyway! 
855293707066548224 2017-04-20 05:34:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet There is no such thing. It doesn't exist. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/21/1636308/-WTF-is-the-Harvard-Harris-Poll-anyway

855290877450764289 2017-04-20 05:23:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @adirado29 @BellaDonna810 Didn't he write some essays about that decades ago?
855290699134115840 2017-04-20 05:22:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet But how can that be when there are utterly fictional polls that say the opposite?
855290506896580612 2017-04-20 05:22:02 UTC <total_janarchy> TFW you responded to someone's tweet with utter sarcasm and someone takes you seriously. (I'm highly amused)
855289265332207616 2017-04-20 05:17:06 UTC <total_janarchy> @adirado29 Unlike the oh-so-clever "Feel the Bern"?
855288985446268928 2017-04-20 05:15:59 UTC <total_janarchy> @SallyAlbright @AlGiordano Seriously?! (I may hurt myself laughing)
855288827090313218 2017-04-20 05:15:21 UTC <total_janarchy> @BerniedOut Which is why she may be the best person on 24 hour news now.
855287957661523969 2017-04-20 05:11:54 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar :(
855237258198253569 2017-04-20 01:50:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou @Rizabellepow This.
855237001490116608 2017-04-20 01:49:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou I'm hoping this is the final straw for many people.
855235718788022274 2017-04-20 01:44:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @nprpolitics @scottdetrow @sunr0ck And he doesn't have ovaries or a womb, so they're not important to him.
855235573400948737 2017-04-20 01:43:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @nprpolitics @scottdetrow But any issue that's important to him is non-negotiable. So over this freaking fraud.
855234879017152512 2017-04-20 01:40:59 UTC <total_janarchy> @TheDemocrats @Shakestweetz It's a distraction to him. At least he's consistent in his idiocy.
855234689266798593 2017-04-20 01:40:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou @BerniedOut @JoyAnnReid has his number. I am hoping she speaks up more on tv. She's certainly not coy about it on Twitter.
855215113300738050 2017-04-20 00:22:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 I raised that the other day and the new excuse is "Well, he's not running for public office so he doesn't have to." But he had & he will...
855213803881082881 2017-04-20 00:17:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Starz does have a stand alone streaming service that's similar to HBO Go if you don't get what you need from your cable co.
855213272580141057 2017-04-20 00:15:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @IfHillaryHad I bet your AG knows that Hawaii is a state too. And smokes the good shit.
855170623097765888 2017-04-20 21:25:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Bless him. This is what our party actually needs.

855168434291830785 2017-04-20 21:16:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist Viagra. Prostate exams. Man things.

855106013124595713 2017-04-20 17:08:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou I'm hoping he actually gets vetted and soon.
855105519824101376 2017-04-20 17:06:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @SuMoh7 @bitchyologist @blue_activist It's a big deal when he disses Ossoff yet endorses a right wing DINO who is pro-life and pro-transvaginal ultrasound!
855105092227407873 2017-04-20 17:05:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist He is like kiss of death to candidates.
855104956671688709 2017-04-20 17:04:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @Lawrence It was #TheResistance and mainly women. We haven't even begun to start yet.
855104457432076289 2017-04-20 17:02:44 UTC <total_janarchy> @Lawrence @normandybounder Righty? I don't think so. I just don't like hypocrisy from my supposed allies.
854982705125216257 2017-04-20 08:58:56 UTC <total_janarchy> @snazdoll Because she is and we do.

854979854948859904 2017-04-20 08:47:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist She also might have a bit more understanding about those distracting women's issues.
854969466962227200 2017-04-20 08:06:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @JulianLennon Congratulations, Julian! That's wonderful!
854968497037860865 2017-04-20 08:02:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @erikaheidewald @mitchellscomet I was home alone w my mom. Earlier, I was the happiest I had ever been, and will never be again. It all came crashing down. Not over it yet.
854933301001412610 2017-04-19 05:42:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @erikaheidewald You're not alone. It was horrible.
854931943221284864 2017-04-19 05:37:13 UTC <total_janarchy> @EmceeFrodis I don't even know what I'm wearing this weekend. I'm so not focused on it for many reasons. I'm gonna miss you all so much.
854931557450174464 2017-04-19 05:35:41 UTC <total_janarchy> @TomPerez @JoyAnnReid @tharealkato @ginalou I think she's too busy bilking colleges, giving herself big paychecks from Bernie's war chest and attacking @tomperez
854931079148576768 2017-04-19 05:33:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid @MauiHaole1984 Or 100 year old broken record bullshit blood either. Bernie's been pushing the same tired and useless agenda since the 70s.
854930852358356994 2017-04-19 05:32:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid @HaremConspiracy @ltmcdies Yeah, ladies and people of color are low-information voters. Better listen to the Working Class Straight White Menz.
854929651835252736 2017-04-19 05:28:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid @ginalou @tharealkato No, but we do want him to release his tax returns. The ones Jane was lying about finding a year ago.
854927293059395584 2017-04-19 05:18:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Some of us don't want him!

854865679136239621 2017-04-19 01:13:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @Lawrence @TubbytobyLanier He showed one year's worth, 2 page summary just like Trump. Try again. http://bit.ly/1WcJ5bg And he is in office and trying for 2020.

854763961018966016 2017-04-19 18:29:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @AlGiordano Why are they indulging the fancies of an alter kacker?
854763637050834958 2017-04-19 18:28:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @AlGiordano Let her keep going then.
854763283852689419 2017-04-19 18:27:02 UTC <total_janarchy> @Amy_Siskind Then @TomPerez ought to be touring with fellow Democrats and looking ahead to new leadership rather than going backwards.

854711675592855553 2017-04-19 15:01:57 UTC <total_janarchy> I apologise since Twitter was showing me things in reverse order. I'm the same. Support for individual candidates and that's it.
854640397435404292 2017-04-19 10:18:43 UTC <total_janarchy> You can accept it. Many of us will walk away.
854636859036766208 2017-04-19 10:04:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @ljoywilliams @iamdarylleon @yesica @imwithher61 @Jehmu I'm so sorry you didn't get the gig!
854636337475055616 2017-04-19 10:02:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @Lawrence Are you going to push Sanders to do the same? Still waiting for his taxes too.
854635987275743233 2017-04-19 10:01:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera @ViragoX Does he think that if he writes it often enough, it'll come true like some warped version of "Weird Science" or "Big"?
854623603689742336 2017-04-19 09:11:59 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Is this his version of porny fan fiction?
854450516180578304 2017-04-18 21:44:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn Mine's going to explode anyway! 
854450144019927040 2017-04-18 21:42:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @erikaheidewald I would love to believe I'm extraordinary, but...
854448829344739329 2017-04-18 21:37:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I still will think good thoughts for you!
854369026205773825 2017-04-18 16:20:23 UTC <total_janarchy> @owillis Clinton Derangement Syndrome never goes out of style unfortunately.
854368087252115457 2017-04-18 16:16:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar You can do it. By the power of Pin-bot!
854367699660673028 2017-04-18 16:15:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @TrickOrTreackle And they'd have found a way to blame HRC anyway.

854367020380565504 2017-04-18 16:12:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @JulianLennon Done. 
854366526358659072 2017-04-18 16:10:27 UTC <total_janarchy> @clapifyoulikeme @regwag2003 I'd rather light Cilizza on fire and throw him from high building.
854366291657936897 2017-04-18 16:09:31 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Just don't lose the ring. Because nasal surgery isn't fun. Thinking good job thoughts for ya.
854224340942024704 2017-04-17 06:45:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @screenrant @JamesGunn Holy fuck! May 6 can't come fast enough. (I'm seeing it Saturday).

854207721314422784 2017-04-17 05:39:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @TomPerez @owillis @RealSteveCox @JaymayAllDay Especially when that 'victim vote' will never actually support the rest of us anyway.
854205155130171392 2017-04-17 05:29:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @BernieSanders Sanders is not a Democrat & will never speak for me or have my vote. I'm sorry I supported @TomPerez for DNC chair. No more $ to DNC from me
854202228109869058 2017-04-17 05:17:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @adirado29 I must've missed the part where Melania is a Rhodes Scholar and holds a law degree.
854201669210394624 2017-04-17 05:15:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou @finneyk Something the media seems to refuse to even look at. Something in that milk ain't clean.

854199803911311360 2017-04-17 05:07:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @owillis Totally over @TomPerez now. Instead of pandering to a non-Democrat, he ought to be supporting women, LGBT ppl and PoC who are the party base
854188018797867008 2017-04-17 04:21:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn Facebook fail so I'm just hearing the news now. So excited!
854187403917053952 2017-04-17 04:18:41 UTC <total_janarchy> @JamesGunn @prattprattpratt  just announced you're writing and directing Guardians Vol 3. So happy to hear this! Squee!
853858120027820032 2017-04-16 06:30:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou @finneyk Paul Manafort's partner was Tad Devine. Both worked on Ukranian campaign for Viktor Yanukovich, Vlad's pal. Devine was BS's campaign mgr.
853856111564337152 2017-04-16 06:22:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou Funny how his "Revolution" only gave his big Bro candidate all of $900 but it's the DNC's fault, right?
852773062260830208 2017-04-13 06:38:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @ArcLightChicago @JamesGunn Pretty!
852751479689560064 2017-04-13 05:12:50 UTC <total_janarchy> @GretschUSA @thebeatles @GeorgeHarrison I think it was the trousers.

852746032970481665 2017-04-13 04:51:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @spiderlegs1982 It breaks my heart that he couldn't keep her because he couldn't take her to the UK due to stupid Breed specific laws.
852745887302406144 2017-04-13 04:50:37 UTC <total_janarchy> Breaks my heart that @SirPatStew and his wife couldn't keep her, but it made me love him even more.https://twitter.com/MTraziWilliams/status/848882543764004864
852745369905537024 2017-04-13 04:48:34 UTC <total_janarchy> You want to support this. You really do. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1415233260/resist-persist-fight-buyblue/ #theresistance
851987526910922753 2017-04-11 02:37:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @rtalalay indeed. But then again, you and I are of the same age.
851967271023063040 2017-04-11 01:16:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar CHOKERS! I think I still have several of mine somewhere in my room.
851707424822235136 2017-04-11 08:04:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @DavidCornDC Well, that's because she's not a WAR criminal. He's being nuanced...
851707197620973572 2017-04-11 08:03:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @richarddinnick I stopped several years ago because of the way I was treated, and that was nothing compared to this! Will never fly them again.
851706745839865856 2017-04-11 08:01:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet I wasn't being snarky at you. I was being snarky about them! Sorry!
851706626268594178 2017-04-11 08:00:58 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar And no one to question your orthodoxy!
851706562775326720 2017-04-11 08:00:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I miss the original Urban Decay cosmetics and Revlon's Vamp lipstick too.
851704518517641216 2017-04-11 07:52:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I'm okay with that. The only things I miss about the 90s are my age, and the President.
851704392495575040 2017-04-11 07:52:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I don't think I could subscribe to your suicide cult. Suicide? Sure. Cult, not so much.
851704293224841216 2017-04-11 07:51:42 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet Hmmmm that concept never crossed my mind before. They're so....different!
851701982893154304 2017-04-11 07:42:31 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar So I can blame Hanson for all this shit?
851701668404228096 2017-04-11 07:41:16 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar "We are all star stuff" - Delenn of Minbar (hey look at me quoting stupid shit!)
851701499147284481 2017-04-11 07:40:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Or you just haven't done enough research/experienced the true candidate yet. :(
851701075509993472 2017-04-11 07:38:54 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar So do you want to be 'transported, beamed up, probed, whatever' like @thenewno2 s  Dhani Harrison?
851700881863192576 2017-04-11 07:38:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 Does United even fly to Rome?
851700539079499776 2017-04-11 07:36:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 I was really hoping this dickhead was actually just a Russian bot.
851700233381793792 2017-04-11 07:35:34 UTC <total_janarchy> Yeah, no wonder she's every BernieBros wet dream.https://twitter.com/bitchyologist/status/851669570477797376
850069224085127168 2017-04-06 19:34:31 UTC <total_janarchy> Thanks to the Sun not being able actually follow through on an NDA, there are confirmed spoilers.https://twitter.com/bbcdoctorwho/status/850012717905846272
849808563493056513 2017-04-05 02:18:44 UTC <total_janarchy> Yeah, no. People who follow me with accts created today and with no tweets whatsoever and no pictures are getting blocked.
849808085719842817 2017-04-05 02:16:50 UTC <total_janarchy> Me too. You can even serve me papers on Longuyland in person.https://twitter.com/Lawrence/status/849453031376728064
849178012864188417 2017-04-04 08:33:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @OptimumHelp apparently it was a local outage. Finally came back after an hour. But thanks.

849141197633449985 2017-04-03 06:06:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @OptimumHelp my cable modem just freaked out. Lost the connection and now it won't reboot all the way. Is there an outage?
848810298198949888 2017-04-03 08:11:59 UTC <total_janarchy> @aseitzwald @KThomasDC No thanks. I'm trying to cut down.
848809474844438529 2017-04-03 08:08:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX He still worked with Mansfort on Yanukovich campaign. Twice.
848365745683795968 2017-04-01 02:45:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Loki always finds uses for horses, wink wink, nudge nudge.
848365500400885761 2017-04-01 02:44:31 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Of course not. They'd rather hate-watch and make it not-fun for the rest of us.
848214974002589696 2017-04-01 16:46:23 UTC <total_janarchy> @DavidCornDC He fibbed about having a Pulitzer too.
848214728740622337 2017-04-01 16:45:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist That includes @billmaher
848113313875668992 2017-04-01 10:02:25 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar LMFAO he probably runs an equipment rental company where nothing actually works.
848083500104384512 2017-04-01 08:03:57 UTC <total_janarchy> @sukatra I was screaming at my tv set. This is the end of my watching that show.
848079464542220288 2017-04-01 07:47:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @kath_ballantyne There's never been a homosexual (monosexual?) full-time companion in the show's history. Does it have to get that specific? *sigh*
848078994041974784 2017-04-01 07:46:03 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Exactly. I just wish they'd all shut up already. Stop watching and let us enjoy it.
848078807596752896 2017-04-01 07:45:18 UTC <total_janarchy> @kath_ballantyne There have been a number of one-off characters, as well as Jack, River, Vastra & Jenny. They are not full-time, second billed, full series.
848078479757373440 2017-04-01 07:44:00 UTC <total_janarchy> @kath_ballantyne He wasn't a full time character. That's not an official companion. He's also pan/omni not gay. This is diminishing Bill & her representation
848058778113245184 2017-03-31 06:25:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton @thepoliticalcat @VABVOX @PodcastObsessed Tad Devine was Paul Manafort's partner in helping in Ukraine elections. You do the math.
848057906104852480 2017-03-31 06:22:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @seattlerockgal @TrumpsTaxes Not to mention discounting it as 'bullshit'.
848056453109760000 2017-03-31 06:16:29 UTC <total_janarchy> @owillis He's gotten worse imho, but your mileage may vary.
848054614146646016 2017-03-31 06:09:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @tommyxtopher This was the last straw. No more @billmaher and real time for me. @neeratanden deserves so much better.
848051095092047877 2017-03-31 05:55:11 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem I'm just worried it's an April Fool's joke. Let's see what he says on Sunday.
848045228015661056 2017-03-31 05:31:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid I am so praying this is not an April Fool's joke. I think that would kill me.
848044889157890048 2017-03-31 05:30:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I'm currently rereading American Gods. I'm embarrassed that my first time reading it, I totally missed Low-Key Lyesmith. I am teh dumb.
848044624384053248 2017-03-31 05:29:29 UTC <total_janarchy> Or assume that a recurring white male character from 12 yrs ago is representation enough so a gay black woman isn't needed or important.https://twitter.com/kenrar/status/847875329293037568
848044344011567104 2017-03-31 05:28:22 UTC <total_janarchy> @JKH2 She was so racist that 94% of African American voted for her. You know, those 'low information voters' he kept harping about.
848044074426937344 2017-03-31 05:27:17 UTC <total_janarchy> @kath_ballantyne @T_Lawson And he wasn't a companion, he was recurring character. 12 yrs ago. Plus a white man. I guess that no one needs another queer character then?
848042665925062657 2017-03-31 05:21:42 UTC <total_janarchy> I am praying this is not an April Fool's joke.https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei/status/848023619414437888
848042427286003713 2017-03-31 05:20:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @GeorgeTakei I am really really praying this is the real deal and not an April Fool's joke, Uncle George.
848036463606452224 2017-03-31 04:57:03 UTC <total_janarchy> @billmaher @bitchyologist @Rizabellepow Hearing him say that calling out racism and sexism was 'little piffling bullshit' was the final straw. Thank goodness for @neeratanden
848035606655586310 2017-03-31 04:53:39 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Or why a black woman might be important for representation vs a white man.
848035206032490497 2017-03-31 04:52:03 UTC <total_janarchy> @billmaher @bitchyologist @Rizabellepow No, he needs to go fuck himself after his show tonight. He's perpetuating the "she lost the election and fucked up" memo like his hero BS
848034948850307072 2017-03-31 04:51:02 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist And what about a woman who has been the subject of sexism and racism standing right next to him and not saying a word?
848034060412780545 2017-03-31 04:47:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz Never. And if women candidates start riding their coat tails, I'm over them too.
847448463746805762 2017-03-30 14:00:33 UTC <total_janarchy> Is there going to be a follow up on SCROTUS' fashion choices next,?http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58dbaf2ee4b0cb23e65d0848

847002597269684224 2017-03-29 08:28:50 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid I have a helpful suggestion as to where he can put his loofa.

847002142191898624 2017-03-29 08:27:01 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet This was comments by male friend of female friend of mine who also has a teenage daughter. Dickhead kept citing "rules" & "business casual"
847001468406259712 2017-03-29 08:24:21 UTC <total_janarchy> @Eviljohna Remember it's just "a distraction" to their glorious leader, not to mention an establishment thing they don't need.
847000899813888001 2017-03-29 08:22:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet Yeah, I thought of that too. I wound up fighting w/ friend of a friend (male, of course) who kept arguing about 'rules' & ignoring sexism
847000690526433280 2017-03-29 08:21:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @EricIdle Happiest of birthdays! I hope you and yours have a lovely day.

846210544570941441 2017-03-26 04:01:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist We should all stick to making cookies and serving tea.
846209483525296128 2017-03-26 03:57:17 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid I met Mr Koppel once on a grad school trip to DC. He was an absolute mensch and a joy to talk to.

846208586829172736 2017-03-26 03:53:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @bitchyologist More like if not for the self-indulgance and hubris of Bernie Sanders.
845932284926738433 2017-03-26 09:35:48 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar Yours and mine!
845931769329303552 2017-03-26 09:33:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @Eviljohna I've been asking this for weeks. There's definitely a connection between those two campaigns whether his faithful like it or not.

845930293727035392 2017-03-26 09:27:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @rtalalay But that would deprive us of your awesome directing skills and that wouldn't be much fun.

830679732039647232 2017-02-11 07:27:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @Nowsolarwa he did it all the way through his campaign and people ignored it. It was obvious to some of us but no one listened. It's scary.
830679001505083392 2017-02-11 07:24:41 UTC <total_janarchy> it's called projection. Because Trump paid people to show up at his early appearances on the campaign trail. For a start.

828104793306578945 2017-02-04 04:55:42 UTC <total_janarchy> Actually serious but dumb question: was that "Stand by Me" or "I won't back down" being played in background of new Starbucks commercial?
828104291097403393 2017-02-04 04:53:43 UTC <total_janarchy> @BraddJaffy How very Christian of him, right? Isn't he an ordained minister?
828104050818301954 2017-02-04 04:52:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX @EyeofKitra I haven't seen it so can't comment. Just haven't liked her as an actress in anything I have seen.
828103838708154369 2017-02-04 04:51:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX Exactly. Plus I am not sure if she's ever said it outright in public before this. Just didn't deny etc. Either way, good for her.
828102497629773825 2017-02-04 04:46:35 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX Proud of her for stating it.
828102399709548545 2017-02-04 04:46:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @aravosis Saw it on FB earlier tonight. As a born/bred NYer, it made me cry. Horror, then love for fellow NYers.

828098094411739136 2017-02-04 04:29:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX And he has the fucking audacity to call himself a Christian? Isn't he an ordained minister too?
828070979154956289 2017-02-04 02:41:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @Budweiser @AngelaGunn I'm much more into vodka or rum. I don't like very strong tasting liquor, sadly. I drink a lot of hard cider though.

828038931505623041 2017-02-04 00:34:00 UTC <total_janarchy> @Budweiser @AngelaGunn I don't drink beer, but will be buying some Bud anyway. I can always use it for cooking. Or washing my hair.

828037756815294469 2017-02-04 00:29:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @realDonaldTrump @KeithOlbermann I'm with you, Keith. Unfortunately I am not a member of Congress.
828037217931128832 2017-02-04 00:27:11 UTC <total_janarchy> If I drank beer, I'd buy Bud. Maybe I will anyway, and make beer battered everything.https://twitter.com/lpolgreen/status/828033551786442752
828036897708589056 2017-02-04 00:25:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @kath_ballantyne I was being silly, esp when he was listing to All Things Must Pass (1 of my top 10 albums) as he said it. :D
828035534366896128 2017-02-04 00:20:30 UTC <total_janarchy> @tedlieu He should have had one and a proper physical exam before being allowed to run. He's very disturbed.
828031421075841025 2017-02-04 00:04:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @realDonaldTrump Because it's not in conflict, and you're not a legal scholar. You're not even aware of the Constitution.
828030598367281153 2017-02-04 00:00:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @Newsweek @kurteichenwald @Hellfire_ESS Because someone at Slate says so? LOL

828021972919545857 2017-02-04 23:26:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @TomPerez @JewelDole He was at SFO protesting the Muslim ban, has spoken out loudly and proudly about fighting for things that matter.

827063321262174208 2017-02-01 07:57:16 UTC <total_janarchy> @ezlusztig Isn't this also a violation of Constitution? Hate crimes based on one religion is considered terrorism, the other isn't?
827063160796479488 2017-02-01 07:56:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @ezlusztig As they should be.
827053549993472001 2017-02-01 07:18:26 UTC <total_janarchy> @IfHillaryHad I'm sure you have a good IT staff to help you out. Besides, you have more important things to do as Prez than tweeting!

827048493466411008 2017-02-01 06:58:21 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX WTF?
827047448770179072 2017-02-01 06:54:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @NickCohen4 @AuntyYas @jk_rowling Someone needs to tell him that there are no dimes in the UK. Not even in old money.

827041392149020672 2017-02-01 06:30:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera @maryamericaj3 I do remember that very well. But you know, he's good at repeating stuff that he's learned by rote.
827039480251084801 2017-02-01 06:22:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera I bet he also tells them how well endowed he is too. *eyeroll*

827038538076188672 2017-02-01 06:18:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @VABVOX Exactly. It always pissed me off when Bill Maher brought up orangutans. They deserve so much better.

827032044471468032 2017-02-01 05:52:59 UTC <total_janarchy> Don't you think he looks a little tired? Maybe he needs a long, long rest. https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/827027253775069190

827030270801014784 2017-02-01 05:45:56 UTC <total_janarchy> @KaraCalavera Indeed. This is another plunge into insanity.
827029742855585792 2017-02-01 05:43:50 UTC <total_janarchy> That would mean some of them actually had an oz of integrity. I am not sure they do.https://twitter.com/20committee/status/826997482613796864

826679307149930496 2017-01-31 06:31:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @kenrar I might want to do that too. I need to see if my bathing suit even fits now. It was too small, and now I suspect too big.
826679141445562368 2017-01-31 06:30:40 UTC <total_janarchy> @catawu I'm so sorry for the confusion. I try very hard not to snark at strangers, I swear!

826331711348809728 2017-01-30 07:30:07 UTC <total_janarchy> @KeithOlbermann That's even worse than DJT whining that Dems blocking his pics just to be political.

826315900731146242 2017-01-30 06:27:17 UTC <total_janarchy> @BernieSanders So do something about it.
826296371019935744 2017-01-30 05:09:41 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid @jonfavs Is it possible this was filed before the mess with Yates? They seem pretty much on fire tonight. But who knows?

824364174214098944 2017-01-25 21:11:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @Fairy_Gmother it feels like years. Honestly I don't know if I will make it to Gally. This is killing me.
824347406741471233 2017-01-25 20:05:12 UTC <total_janarchy> @SenSchumer I'm a native New Yorker too. My ancestors came here to escape authoritarian regimes and Nazis, not welcome them.

824336873392848896 2017-01-25 19:23:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @GovHowardDean I would go with Lock Him Up personally.
824336289948454912 2017-01-25 19:21:01 UTC <total_janarchy> My Senator. The other one (@SenSchumer ) isn't doing his job as minority leader. https://twitter.com/SheWhoVotes/status/824318771208671232

824269476849971201 2017-01-25 14:55:32 UTC <total_janarchy> @ZerlinaMaxwell like a compilation of bad movie reviews cut and pasted together.
824268544019955713 2017-01-25 14:51:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @ZerlinaMaxwell precisely. How do we fight it?
824267563274305536 2017-01-25 14:47:55 UTC <total_janarchy> @Amy_Siskind like badly edited movie reviews
824266980513419266 2017-01-25 14:45:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @ananavarro yes but Don't Quixote was a knight with honor and chivalry, protector of weak and in need. Trump isn't Alonso Quijano
824266045137518592 2017-01-25 14:41:53 UTC <total_janarchy> @Amy_Siskind this is why he's now hung up over "illegal" votes.

824193754898825217 2017-01-25 09:54:38 UTC <total_janarchy> @JoyAnnReid so much for @SenSchumer claims of fighting against this mess.

824155792387538944 2017-01-24 07:23:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @mitchellscomet @ASlavitt It will not pass MN senate and/or will be vetoed by governor.
824155651840606209 2017-01-24 07:23:14 UTC <total_janarchy> @AllisonBJanney Martin Sheen would make a better Prez tbh. He really would.

824131357412651009 2017-01-24 05:46:41 UTC <total_janarchy> I unwittingly aided in this by ordering new copies of this and Animal Farm tonight because I can't find where my old ones went.https://twitter.com/MrsTad/status/824130604732219400

824127426330509312 2017-01-24 05:31:04 UTC <total_janarchy> @funder Do we think Ryan is going to turn on him? Or just take it lying down?

824122494768521217 2017-01-24 05:11:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem I'm absolutely horrified by both of them. I don't care if it's 'pick your battles'. They should be blocking/voting No on all.
824121988646076416 2017-01-24 05:09:28 UTC <total_janarchy> @Amy_Siskind Yes.
824121810698588160 2017-01-24 05:08:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @BernieSanders @tribelaw @petuniapple And are still repeating same. They're still living in 2016.
824121333869137921 2017-01-24 05:06:52 UTC <total_janarchy> @ahumorlessfem I'm utterly baffled. Warren & Brown voted for Ben Carson. How is that even something that isn't an Onion headline?
824121198497898497 2017-01-24 05:06:19 UTC <total_janarchy> @CoryBooker @bethbethbeth01 I am trying but it feels like it's going nowhere. @SenWarren and @SenSherrodBrown voted for Ben Carson. WTF

824110077963550720 2017-01-24 04:22:08 UTC <total_janarchy> @BernieSanders @tribelaw @JustPlainSue No, that's what I'm saying. Bernie said alt facts, Trump picked them up and ran with them.
824109936829415424 2017-01-24 04:21:34 UTC <total_janarchy> @tribelaw @WirelessPuppet Started by stealing data in Dec, and no one put their thumb on the scale. You're quoting russian hacks again.
824109562714267649 2017-01-24 04:20:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @temashana You can call it bullshit. It's the truth. Everything Bernie accused HRC of, Trump grabbed and ran with. He helped to create mess

824078541587353604 2017-01-24 02:16:49 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz Because he wants to take in the grandeur and history of the place? Or just cover it all in gilt?
824078357256142848 2017-01-24 02:16:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @tribelaw pity @BernieSanders gave Trump the playbook on rigged elections. His minions are still claiming same re: primaries

822005565006217217 2017-01-19 08:59:33 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @boxercrew @kimfrederi From ppl I know who are aware, they're doing this. If I could go, I would too. More of us than any of them.
822005390133133312 2017-01-19 08:58:51 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @kimfrederi @boxercrew Slap in the face to say the least.
822005197845266432 2017-01-19 08:58:05 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @boxercrew @kimfrederi I don't blame them. Most of the women I know going are/were HRC supporters. They deserve their say.
822005006698160128 2017-01-19 08:57:20 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @kimfrederi @boxercrew Ditto. Esp when using important quote and not even citing the speaker.
822004823608463360 2017-01-19 08:56:36 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @boxercrew @kimfrederi I hate that there is discord when we should be united in this against the REAL enemy. This is why we lose.
822004612588826628 2017-01-19 08:55:46 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @kimfrederi @boxercrew HRC deserves her due -- she ought to be our president. Pity those on the left want to continue delusions
822004209994371080 2017-01-19 08:54:10 UTC <total_janarchy> @kimfrederi @boxercrew I did! And I have even though I can't make the march due to health issues.
822003855122714624 2017-01-19 08:52:45 UTC <total_janarchy> @lsarsour @boxercrew @kimfrederi I know. Apparently purity > honoring someone important to many of us.
822003239163924480 2017-01-19 08:50:18 UTC <total_janarchy> @boxercrew @kimfrederi Sarsour was a Bernie or Buster and BS delegate at the Dem Convention. Not shocked at all that she is now erasing HRC

821104056433340416 2017-01-16 21:17:17 UTC <total_janarchy> @SteveKornacki wtg w/false equivalence. Trump does usual projection re: rigging, Dems respond. Actual rigging by Russians and collusion 1/2

807743738399297536 2016-12-10 00:28:09 UTC <total_janarchy> @peterdaou like @Dennis_Kucinich who seems to need a neurotical scan.

807741843903512576 2016-12-10 00:20:37 UTC <total_janarchy> @EdPlunkett well Dennis Kucinich says it's a Democratic plot so we should believe him, right?

783477802410573824 2016-10-04 01:23:59 UTC <total_janarchy> Notice inherent sexism of what Pence is saying "Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine." She suddenly lost all her titles, jackass? #VPDebate

783476745487978496 2016-10-04 01:19:47 UTC <total_janarchy> @EdPlunkett More like the whining points. More of the "they said mean things!" strategy.
783476613119868932 2016-10-04 01:19:15 UTC <total_janarchy> @Shakestweetz He apparently heard them on MSNBC telling him to keep attacking Clinton. Cos that's really going to win over the women's vote.
