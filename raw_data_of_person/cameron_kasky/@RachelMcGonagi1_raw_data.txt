Dumbass statement of the....well, I was gonna say "of the day," but that lunatic Nunberg took the medal for Dumbassery for this whole month today.

970894000105381890 2018-03-05 05:29:02 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> ATTENTION ALL WORKERS: you're pretty much screwed. Don't let the extra money (if there is any) in your paycheck fool you. Once your 2018 taxes are due (you know, AFTER the midterms) in April 2019, you WILL more than likely owe money to the IRS.

970866784432779265 2018-03-05 03:40:53 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @TheRickyDavila Or that they decided that importing elephant trophies would not be banned completely anymore, but on a "case by case" basis. I bet Junior and The Other One are happy.

Others you might enjoy, too, if you haven't already are Shetland (police show set in the Shetland Islands) and Wallander (same, but set in Sweden & starring Ken Branagh.)
970844366146342923 2018-03-05 02:11:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Yep, and everyone is distracted by Nunberg. Coincidence?  #SaveTheElephantshttps://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/970838329238392832
970843512852963334 2018-03-05 02:08:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AuntieTeaches Well, see how it goes.  You absolutely HAVE to watch the first ep, just to get the flavor, and bc it has some of the zaniest characters in the whole series. And each "season" is only 5-8 eps, 'cause it's British. But yeah, it's a lot.

970839926446215168 2018-03-05 01:54:10 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So Trump lied. Again. He's removed the ban on importing elephant "trophies" entirely, and will make decisions on a case-by-case basis. What the hell? Bet that means Junior and The Other One get to bring home a head to stuff. Criminals.http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/376839-trump-admin-to-consider-elephant-trophy-imports-on-case-by-case#.Wp30GPBbdfc.twitter

970836222468853763 2018-03-05 01:39:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AuntieTeaches Yeah, it was just a week ago. And I've been Angry on the Twitly this week a couple times, when I should have walked away. Got into arguments that were stupid, and I *knew* they were stupid. But, I Could. Not. Help. Myself.

970472528111112192 2018-03-04 01:34:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Absolutely shameful. Just as sick to my stomach as when the reports surfaced about Abu Ghraib.

968648289548668928 2018-02-27 00:45:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @peteysaw Steelworkers, autoworkers, a lot of the trades have guilds and/or unions. Nurses, big time. My husband's home health aide is in one, which is good. But a lot of the private sector businesses don't have them, you're right. Pensions are a thing of the past, too, mostly.

But we had the house in suburbia, we kids went to state colleges without too much in the way of loans. None of my jobs've been union, alas, and at one we were actually threatened with mass firings if we tried.

965892089639714816 2018-02-20 10:13:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @honkarudas Hopefully a lot of us will sing together this November!
965890291688353792 2018-02-20 10:06:05 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I WILL make my voice heard. I WILL speak. I WILL yell. I WILL march. I WILL sing. I WILL not be defeated.  This is my pledge.  What is yours? /end
965889814498177024 2018-02-20 10:04:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I WILL vote in every election, no matter how small. I WILL also vote with my pocketbook by buying locally produced products, or from locally owned stores when possible, and avoiding any vendors or products associated with the NRA or Kochs or Trumps, among others. /11
965888946524712960 2018-02-20 10:00:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I WILL fight with Native People in defense of their land and water rights. I WILL push for equal rights for all LGTBQIA people. I WILL stand in defense of those who can't defend themselves: children, disabled. I WILL fight for programs that feed the hungry & clothe the naked. /10
965887760002301952 2018-02-20 09:56:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I WILL push for gun control. I WILL push for Healthcare for every resident of this country, documented or not. I WILL push for voting rights for EVERY citizen, no matter their race, creed or prison record. I WILL fight for Unions. /9
965887025269256192 2018-02-20 09:53:06 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I'm done. I'm not moving. My Dad was a liberal, peaceful, tree-hugging, anti-war, civil rights activist from the early 60s onward. He instilled in me certain values that I WILL not let them bully me into relinquishing. /8
965886285662470144 2018-02-20 09:50:10 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I, for one, am sick to death of compromising my principles. I'm sick of Dems being told (and then complying) to move toward the center, when Repubs aren't doing the same. They're getting MORE rabid. MORE greedy. MORE bigoted. MORE xenophobic. /7
965885453579636737 2018-02-20 09:46:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Before you get out your pitchforks--I voted twice for Bill Clinton, for Gore, for Kerry, twice for Obama, and once for Hillary Clinton. I'm saying, though, that all of these presidents and nominees were *moderates.* On war, on safety net programs, on equality. /6
965884414977720320 2018-02-20 09:42:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Democrats, especially liberals, used to be actual "lefties." We stood for a unified message of equality. For peace. For ending hunger. For helping our fellow human beings in whatever ways we could. The last *real* Dem we had as President was Jimmy Carter. /5
965883525311340544 2018-02-20 09:39:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Wouldn't happen. The fight just to get a cobbled-together, complete-boon-to-the-insurance-companies ACA passed proves it, never mind the dozens of attempts since by Repubs to destroy it. Even fellow libs mock the #MedicareForAll movement. /4
965882565012803584 2018-02-20 09:35:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Tricky Dick was a liar and a crook, no two ways about it. But he created the damned EPA! Can you even imagine a Republican doing that today? Can you imagine a Dem reaching higher office w/the idea for, never mind ever successfully creating Social Security today? /3
965881849544232960 2018-02-20 09:32:32 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> We've been pushed so far rightwards that our "lefties" are other countries' conservatives. Democrats have had to prove they're moderates, at most, in order to pass muster with lobbyists, but Republicans keep going further and further rightwards. /2
965881179227369472 2018-02-20 09:29:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Why is it we're always being told to give in to the right wing, to the conservatives? We're told to just listen, to just give in this once on budgets, on immigration, on human friggin rights, on marriage equality, on the environment, and always, always on gun regulations. /1https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/965803967488897024

He could have hit any number of kids! It's basically just luck that he didn't. Besides, the regular cops were already there by that time, so the security guards were superfluous.

People convicted of violent crimes never get to have a gun again. People w/history of abusing or stalking others don't get guns either. Neither do homicidal/suicidal people. Done.

It didn't help at all. I'm not in favor of turning our schools, or any other gathering place that people have been gunned down in the dozens, into prisons bc some people can't imagine life w/out an AR-15.

SCOTUS has recently (like the past 25 yrs recent) made rulings that differ wildly from all such rulings before on 2A. It's history/meaning is not as easy as you think.

Even if ANY guns are banned, it would be of the kind that can shoot 40 rounds/min. Not the kind you "protect yourself with." But the LEAST thing we want is universal background checks--at gun shows, at stores, online.

I'm almost 50 and have seen too much violence, but these kids in Florida and their cohort have lived with an incredible fear I cannot imagine. I'm proud of their efforts to change the conversation.

You're saying only the military can use automatic weapons. So, civis can't have M16s.

SCOTUS has upheld that States can ban assault weapons, and in fact 7 of them have. The problem is state borders are pretty porous, so banning AR15s in California does no good if the shooter buys them in Nevada then drives to L.A.

After that, if you're found with one, you're toast, mate.

965039447837310977 2018-02-17 01:45:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DHaines1 @MannyThaGreat @DMeroth That's why it's so insidious. They've bought up stations almost *everywhere*. And now they want rules relaxed so they can own more than one station in a particular area. The newscasters themselves have NO choice about what Sinclair makes them say in these required commentaries.
965038617583239168 2018-02-17 01:41:50 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DHaines1 @MannyThaGreat @DMeroth The affiliates can be owned by Sinclair, though. That's the thing. Like, in Oregon, Sinclair owns two NBCs, an ABC, a CBS, and a Univision station, among others in various cities. The one they own in Providence, RI is NBC-WJAR, channel 10.
965037470768291841 2018-02-17 01:37:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DHaines1 @MannyThaGreat @DMeroth The problem isn't the conservative ownership, it's the right wing commentary presented as "news" that the regular local newscasters are *required* to read by the owners. That doesn't happen with other conglomerates.

965035242913280001 2018-02-17 01:28:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DHaines1 @MannyThaGreat @DMeroth There's a list, I think at FCC, where you can check to see which corporations own which stations. Sinclair owns one in almost every big market, so they likely own one in Boston. I'll see if I can find that list...

964044965411090432 2018-02-14 07:53:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @KLemkau For 10 years, it wasn't. 1994-2004. Bush let the ban on assault weapons (signed by Clinton, w/Dem Congress) lapse. There's been a bit of an uptick in their use in mass shootings ever since.
964037610652889089 2018-02-14 07:24:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @morganw_44 I'm so sorry. 
964028907031707648 2018-02-14 06:49:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ChrisCuomo @wryansmith @cmiketrus Yes. And fund mental health programs. And enforce laws already on the books. Do all that AND ban assault weapons.... Plus, I don't think that something which happens on average once a day in this country can be called "rare." Maybe your definition is an alternate one.

963941188087595008 2018-02-14 01:01:03 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ChrisCuomo @wryansmith @cmiketrus Not in mass shootings. The gun of choice for mass shootings seems to be the AR-15. We had an assault weapons ban once, and it served us pretty well. Shame we had to go and let it expire in '04.

And how it only lasted for 10 years, and now things are way worse? I'd like that ban back.
963928832955699200 2018-02-14 00:11:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So anyone telling you, "that's just the way it is in America," or, "we've always had guns, get used to it," is a lying, ignorant fraud who'd rather have an assault rifle to blow up deer than give up having school shootings twice a week and dead children on the news.   /end

He had a lot of medical problems, tho... I loved him. He slept on my pillow, and followed me around like a puppy. But a few months afterwards, we rescued Logan.

The CDC has to guess a year ahead of time which strains are likely to be part of the next flu season. Sometimes, they guess wrong. But even IF this strain is in a vaccine, it only prevents contracting flu 30% of the time.

962992686675279872 2018-02-12 10:12:02 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @BarbieToes1 @BravenakBlog It's an awful flu. I sympathize. Had me laid out for a week & 1/2. Make sure that you rest plenty for at least a few days when you think it's done, or it'll turn right round and wallop you again. I survived on saltines & Gatorade mixed w/ginger ale, once I could keep it down.

962411151760830464 2018-02-10 19:41:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @nycboston575 No. There was only about 3 months that the Dems had 60 in the Senate, due to Franken being seated late (June, 2009), Kennedy's death (August) and the special election that put Scott Brown (R) in as his replacement (Dec.)
962409131800895488 2018-02-10 19:33:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @JoshRovner Yeah, Dems had 60 in the Senate for, what was it, about 90 days? Kennedy died very soon after Frankenstein was sworn in, so it was from when Kennedy's temporary replacement was seated until Scott Brown was sworn in.
962408364914307072 2018-02-10 19:30:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 And, well, Dems haven't held the third branch of government (the Supreme Court) in quite some time. You and he are conflating the two houses of Congress with two separate branches.

962157962914496512 2018-02-09 02:55:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @justinamash @rgm39 The deficit. Trump's increasing the *deficit*, which was actually going down under Obama.

962152798728044544 2018-02-09 02:34:37 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @justinamash That's easy: yes! See also: ballooning deficits under Reagan, Bush, Bush, and now Trump. And their deficit-hawkishness hypocrisy under Clinton and Obama especially. It's disgraceful.

I've seen enough clips from them to get the usual references (hence being able to answer the question about the prom), but I've just never been a horror fan. Suspense, yes. Fantasy, science fiction, I'm all in. Horror, meh. Unless it's funny.
959971051999412224 2018-02-03 02:05:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @revmagdalen @emilynussbaum @JohnFLombardiJr I've actually never seen any Stephen King movie, though I've read a few of his books. Not much of his horror, tho, tbh. More Dark Tower, and his short stories. Oh, and I liked The Stand.

959952667282780162 2018-02-03 00:52:05 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> ICE continues its policy of picking the low hanging fruit to bolster its arrest numbers.

959582206069899267 2018-02-02 00:20:00 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SpeakerRyan @DevinNunes @OfficialJonZal More like, having found out all this horrible info on Trump's relationship w/Russia, Steele thought that Trump becoming President would be A Bad Thing.
959574535296004096 2018-02-02 23:49:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Amy_Siskind @ltgins @SDGuy1 Different bills. The bill imposing sanctions (and keeping DJT from easing existing ones) was passed w/veto-proof majority in July '17.  The bill requiring the study of the effects of specific sanctions (referenced in article) was passed in August.

The entirety of many coastal states are included, incl. NY, and 9 of 10 of our largest cities. 200 Million people live w/in 100 miles of border or coastline in the US.

Court rulings have turned that "reasonable distance" into a 100 mile zone around US border, incl. coastlines.
959357554340999168 2018-02-02 09:27:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @RonWyden @BudWest So, the "burn it all down and scatter the ashes to the wind approach" is what you're going with, for the US Intelligence Community and our ability to work with that of our allies. Good to know. Hope that works out for us.  I'm done here. Mute.
959355812710834176 2018-02-02 09:20:24 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AshaRangappa_ @ESedlacek The FISA warrant on Page is from well before he was on a Presidential campaign. He was under surveillance from 2013, due to information from INFORMANTS that he was in deep with Russians who were turning him into an agent for them.
959355045211852800 2018-02-02 09:17:21 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @MedianPolitics @AshaRangappa_ @hawkgirlinmn And where did they get the information in those classified documents? Lots of it is from the kind of sources Asha is talking about. People, whose names could be released to the public in unredacted memo wars. People whose lives could then be in danger.
959353452823379968 2018-02-02 09:11:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest Also, read this thread:https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/959267355787497472?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Em5%7Ctwgr%5Eemail%7Ctwcon%5E7046%7Ctwterm%5E1
959351427599515648 2018-02-02 09:02:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest You republicans used to care about that, I think.

959350637304586240 2018-02-02 08:59:50 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest How about we trust that the leadership in the FBI, the DoJ, members of Senate and House Intel Committees, and even some Republican Senators are correct that releasing this information, all of it, unredacted, in a partisan Hail Mary for DJT, is dangerous to our national security.
959345996273561600 2018-02-02 08:41:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest I'm not sure how it can be any plainer, though. The Dossier wasn't the source for the FISA warrant application. It couldn't have been. The timing doesn't fit. Therefore, what they're claiming, that the memo will show how the warrant was obtained using the Dossier, must be false.
959339063223271425 2018-02-02 08:13:50 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest And the reason why we KNOW the FBI didn't use the Dossier to get the FISA warrant, is that Page was already being surveilled in 2013, well before the Dossier's existence.
959338657181188096 2018-02-02 08:12:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest Okayyy, but that would take a helluva lot of time to scrub out all the classified info. Remember, this is a FISA warrant that is likely at least 50 pp, based on over 1000 pp of supporting docs. And all for what? So the FBI can prove they didn't use the Dossier to get the warrant.
959332990424764416 2018-02-01 07:49:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest Time to do what? Release info that's politically partisan and could damage our relationship with our allies as well as endanger nation security? I'm all for accountability, but this is NOT the way to do it.

959319670040875010 2018-02-01 06:56:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RonWyden @BudWest And what are other countries, whose methods and sources have also just been exposed supposed to do? Just change their processes too, I suppose? And then never ever ever trust the US again with any intel. It's going to be hard unburning all those bridges.

959315584432332800 2018-02-01 06:40:33 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> All is not lost. But we can't just leave it up to chance that everything will turn out right. This November, the elections are SO important, in so many ways, not least bc of the curbs we can put on DJTs enthusiasm for war if Dems have the majority in Congress.

Congress must make clear its opposition to any President launching a war of choice against North Korea.
959314172281368576 2018-02-01 06:34:56 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> A very sobering, but very important read. DJTs saber rattling and bluster about bloodying North Korea's nose could, if he goes through with it, plunge us right into the nuclear war he claims he's trying to avoid. There are things were can do, however, to stop him!https://twitter.com/FrankJannuzi/status/958558528284880897

And Russia continues to be to this day.

Later rulings made that "near the border" into a 100 mile zone around the US, incl. coastlines. 200Million people live in the zone.
959283884553682945 2018-02-01 04:34:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @rosequartzpapi @azdangonzalez There's a 100 mile zone around the entire border of the US, incl. coastlines, that the Border Patrol can legally pull this stunt in. Syracuse is about 50 miles to the border w/Canada.

959281840363257857 2018-02-01 04:26:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @rosequartzpapi @MarieGlatt Border Patrol has "extra constitutional" authority bc of a 1952 law, to board any train, bus or ship w/in 100 miles of border, incl. coastlines, and check immigration status. You have the right to not answer their questions, but it may cause you to be detained.

959171319546880000 2018-02-01 21:07:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> But I do think the FBI needs just as much scrutiny as any other law enforcement agency over how it treats people in their custody, their problems with profiling, and their broad surveillance powers, especially of Americans whose politics and ethnicities they don't like. /end

I'm just saying, they have their faults like any other government organization, and we cannot lose sight of that in our zeal to "stick it to the Republicans."

958077396099375104 2018-01-29 20:40:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @CheriJacobus @tedlieu @alwaysaliberal Because the info in the memo is cherry picked from a bunch of classified documents, and the reason the DoJ doesn't want it released isn't some kind of conspiracy, it's bc it hasn't been vetted to see if any of that classified info is in it. And Nunes wldnt even let them see it.

957177811264880640 2018-01-27 09:05:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @EricColumbus @devincomiskey I've been saying the same thing. And even if (by some miracle) both houses of Congress flip blue, there won't be enough Dems in the Senate to convict on impeachment. They'd need at least 9 Repubs to vote to convict, too, which is unlikely.

Even IF Dems keep all seats up for re-election in 2018, AND win all the Repub seats that're up, they'll still only have 57. They'll need at least 9 Repubs to vote to convict, too.

957072417569951744 2018-01-26 02:07:00 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @CHawksRun Nixon did. So did Adams and Jefferson, or refused to honor it, I guess. So the cases went to SCOTUS.

956765284915793921 2018-01-25 05:46:34 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @HillaryClinton @POTUS @Or8r Yeah. The liberal bias of the news is probably one of the biggest lies there is. And yet, they keep perpetuating it. Even the #WomensMarch2018 didn't get nearly the coverage that the nothing-burger shutdown did.
956764733608140800 2018-01-25 05:44:22 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @JKolkin @butterflytxgirl I think best we can hope for is, as you said, his resignation. Otherwise, we're just going to have to neuter him, keep him from passing any harmful bills, def. win the Senate back to stop the horrible court-packing...and hope we have a good candidate in 2020.
956764186440187905 2018-01-25 05:42:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @JKolkin @butterflytxgirl We won't have the numbers even if we win all available Senate seats in November. There are only 8 Repubs up for re-election, and even IF Dems hold all current seats & win all those Rs, we'd only have 57. You need 66 or 67 to convict on articles of Impeachment.
956763117676998656 2018-01-25 05:37:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @blue_activist Yeah. Sorry.
956763030355812352 2018-01-25 05:37:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @blue_activist Yeah, that's my guess... that there won't be the numbers to impeach, ever. We're going to have to hope he resigns, or at the very least, lessen the damage he can do til 2020 by turning Congress blue. Having a Dem Senate would slow the court-packing, for instance.
956756000572231680 2018-01-25 05:09:40 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @blue_activist Nope. There are 34 Senate seats up for re-election, 26 of them Dems. So, 8 Rs. IF Dems hold all their seats (Big IF), AND win all Rs, they'll only have 57. You need 66 (or 67?) to convict on Impeachment. They'll need at least 9 Rs to side w/them. Good luck.
956754697548738560 2018-01-25 05:04:30 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @HillaryClinton @POTUS @Or8r Oh, sure, but I want a #Resistance response as well as a Dem response. They had a Tea Party and a GOP response, so....  I'm not old enough to know Jack and Joe, but I grew up in Massachusetts, voted for Ted. I actually worked in Hyannis for a couple summers, near their compound.
956753652026261504 2018-01-25 05:00:20 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @JKolkin @jnadms I think that's what it's going to take.
956753087875575808 2018-01-25 04:58:06 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @blue_activist Yep. Exactly.
956752305327517697 2018-01-25 04:54:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I hate to be a bummer, honestly. I don't want to harsh anyone's excitement over how Trump's going to get in trouble by opening his big mouth.   I know I can be a pessimist sometimes, but I'm also a realist, and my gut says, Trump ain't gonna testify, no way, nohow.
956751599413547008 2018-01-25 04:52:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> This GOP-controlled, practically complicit Congress is NEVER going to put articles of Impeachment forward on their Golden Gooseboy. This is the same bunch of Repubs that's been blocking and impeding the investigation all along. Why would that change?
956750888558718981 2018-01-25 04:49:22 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Even if a majority opinion says, "You have to answer Mueller's questions!" (Which, recall, SCOTUS has never done; it's always been about supplying materials.) Even if they do that, and he says, "No! Make me!"  This Congress is not going to make him.
956750214181736448 2018-01-25 04:46:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Now we return to the present. Trump says, "Nope, you can't make me!" Mueller lays the slam down. Trump ignores it. It goes to the current SCOTUS. With Roberts. And Alito. And Thomas. And Gorsuch. And (maybe) Kennedy.
956749282157117440 2018-01-25 04:42:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Notice that nowhere in there did Nixon ever actually testify. (He did, later, in 1975, when he wasn't President anymore.) Note that it was a Dem-controlled Congress that brought up the Articles of Impeachment. And an Inquiry Committee that had spent 8 MONTHS gathering evidence.
956748283984007168 2018-01-25 04:39:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @blue_activist It was sent in April 1974, I think, and they made the decision in July. So, not long.
956748092581138434 2018-01-25 04:38:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Just days later, the House Judiciary Committee approved 3 articles of Impeachment against Nixon, for: obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. Just a week or so after that, Nixon resigned.
956746959301197824 2018-01-25 04:33:45 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> In the meantime, the case *United States vs Nixon* (1974), went to the Supreme Court. In an UNANIMOUS decision, Justice Berger stated that Nixon was hampering due process of law, and he had to turn over the full tapes since he had not claimed they contained any state secrets.
956746318994534400 2018-01-25 04:31:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 9) He also had an adversarial Congress with a Dem majority. Keep that in mind.  An Impeachment Inquiry Committee was formed within the House Judiciary Committee, and started to work in the background on the feasibility and legal hurdles to actually impeaching a President.
956743200512688130 2018-01-25 04:18:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 8) He turned over....some of them, obviously edited and altered. He'd also been subpoenaed to testify. He refused, claiming Executive Privilege. A big difference to what we're facing now is that Nixon was already legally considered an unindicted co-conspirator.
956740035486744576 2018-01-25 04:06:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 7) Executive Privilege meets The Constitutional crisis of the Watergate years. When it became clear through others' testimony that Nixon had tapes relevant to the investigation about the Watergate break in, Nixon was subpoenaed for the tapes.
956739330650775552 2018-01-25 04:03:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 6) Executive Privilege became a thing bc Jefferson argued he was too busy to have to court to be questioned or appear before committees. Thus, longstanding precedent became that Presidents did not have to respond to subpoenas. Ever.
956738389792907264 2018-01-25 03:59:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 5) In Adams and Jefferson's cases, the result was basically that the President could not be subpoenaed for questioning, though they could be asked to turn over relevant materials. *The United States vs. Burr* (1807) established the idea of "Executive Privilege."
956737244592717824 2018-01-25 03:55:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 4) Constitutional Crisis is what then.  We've had other Presidents face subpoenas (mostly for materials), notably John Adams, Jefferson, Nixon and Clinton. In each, the President at first refused, and, except for w/Clinton, each went to the Supreme Court to be decided.
956735057896484865 2018-01-25 03:46:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 3) And then Trump says, "You can't do that! I'm, like, really smart. And I think you're smelly and the DoJ is out to get me and so does my bestie, Nunes. And my other bestie, Paulie. And my other other bestie, Mitch. I'm not appearing."  Well.... what then?  Seriously. What then?
956734118745726987 2018-01-25 03:42:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 2) I mean, what happens if Trump (or Dowd, but we all know who wears the pantaloons in that relationship) decides, "Nope, not going talk with Mueller."   And Mueller says, "Okay, y'know what, beeyotch? I'm gon' subpoena your ass. Wham!"
956733355667603456 2018-01-25 03:39:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 1) Lots of speculation about whether John Down, Trump's attny, will LET Trump speak to Robert Mueller, and folks saying it's not up to Dowd or Trump, it's up to Mueller. See also: subpoena power.   But is it, really?
956731787526381570 2018-01-25 03:33:28 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @joyce_tyler This one thinks he is. What happens if he refuses to appear? Who's gonna make him? The GOP-controlled Congress, who've been obstructing the investigation all along?
956731278425964544 2018-01-25 03:31:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @JKolkin And if Trump refuses to honor the subpoena, claiming Mueller is on a partisan witch hunt and the DoJ is out to get him? Bam, Constitutional crisis. But then you can expect GOP Congress to side with Donnie, and not do anything about it.
956730391137693696 2018-01-25 03:27:55 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @Zenber1 But this is #KingDotard, remember. The rules don't apply to him bc he's President; he's said as much. I expect him to refuse to honor a subpoena, while he continues to receive cover from the only enforcement entity there would be on that issue: a GOP-controlled Congress.
956729300643864576 2018-01-25 03:23:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @woodruffbets @TholstrupJens @donna_spackman Or he still refuses outright to honor the subpoena, and we have ourselves a Constitutional crisis. It's not out of the realm of possibility, unfortunately. There's no telling what happens at that point. It would basically be up to, ahem, a GOP controlled Congress to decide.
956728011058946049 2018-01-25 03:18:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @HillaryClinton @POTUS @Or8r Exactly. I always watched Obama's SotUs. I wonder if the networks will give time for a rebuttal from #TheResistance since they gave one to the Tea Party back then. J/k. I know they won't.
956710954036731904 2018-01-25 02:10:40 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I gotta say, the chutzpah of this guy to talk about the courage of the girls in this particular situation, while he ignored Roy Moore's accusers, and continues to ignore Trump's accusers...it's breathtaking.https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/956634061040168963

955730447157227520 2018-01-23 09:14:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> This is the kind of immigrant story few hear: how difficult it is for black and brown people to come here even when they *have merit* as defined by this WH.

954871347565404160 2018-01-20 00:20:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @grigg_dana @JenGranholm But it's a marathon, not a sprint.
954866683784577024 2018-01-20 00:02:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Ain't it the truth. It's great to mobilize today, but one day is NOT ENOUGH. Resistance is a marathon, not a sprint. We have to turn our enthusiasm for protest into enthusiasm for voting!  #BlueWave2018https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/954862102384205826
954864518818967552 2018-01-20 23:53:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @musicaamazigh There were quite a few folks in wheelchairs there, about 1/2 dozen that I saw. I am glad that the organizers were thoughtful, too.
954863946262921217 2018-01-20 23:51:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 7) Here's another couple. We had a good time. Hope we don't have to do this again next year. /endpic.twitter.com/HImCXjE7Do
954863409693999104 2018-01-20 23:49:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 6) The March was big, people-wise, is what I'm saying. I didn't get any pics of us in the streets, but got a few from a bit before the rally started.pic.twitter.com/ROI3CTUItO
954862823745572864 2018-01-20 23:46:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 5) The March itself started at a bit before 3pm, PST. It was a pretty short route, which was good, because I was pushing a wheelchair and can't walk far. And the streets weren't closed off. At one point, I could see the marchers looped around almost the whole route.
954862285188575233 2018-01-20 23:44:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 4) Lots of people had signs-- there was even a table set up where somebody had brought sign-making supplies and let folks make them for free. Some good ones I saw were:  "Keep your laws off my body!" "Ugh--Where do I even start?"
954861350198550528 2018-01-20 23:41:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> My husband was with me, in his wheelchair, but after about 30 minutes into the rally, I wasn't very steady on my feet any more (chronic pain issues) but the organizers helpfully had some chairs put out for people with standing issues, and I got one right in front of him.
954860699011899392 2018-01-20 23:38:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 2) we were led in a song, Tracy Chapman's "Talkin' Bout A Revolution," and it was glorious.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2wneBVssPc&sns=tw
954860058617159680 2018-01-20 23:35:53 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 1) Just got home from the Women's March in Corvallis, Oregon with the motto "Still I Rise!" There was a rally that started at 1pm (or thereabouts) with speakers, some poetry, a few exhortations to keep on keeping on, and do so inclusively, and then...

This was from the rally, about an hour before the march started. My husband's in a wheelchair, so we couldn't go on the grass, and by the time of the actual March, the area was FULL! Kick off for rally was at 1pm PST. March at 3.pic.twitter.com/YpqG0nc1Br

954618146849107968 2018-01-19 07:34:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @KamalaHarris @megcheer99 No worries. I had to look up the info myself since *I* was worried about my Husband's SSDI. All of us have been under a lot of stress lately (can't think why) and anything else added to the pile just makes it all worse. Hopefully this will just be for a couple days, per usual.

954612578742804480 2018-01-19 07:12:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DMeroth Yeah. It's why they keep saying he's doing all kinds of things to MAGA or whatever. They don't hear the follow-ups about how his EOs are blocked by courts or not enforced or are just memos, etc.
954611620579229697 2018-01-19 07:08:40 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenateMajLdr @KamalaHarris @WoodlawnMike They did. There was a bipartisan bill that had enough votes to pass in the Senate, but @Senatemajldr refused to bring it up for a vote, especially once DJT said he wouldn't sign it, despite promising to do so (on camera) two days earlier.
954610539748982784 2018-01-19 07:04:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @KamalaHarris @megcheer99 No it doesn't. They do get paid. They've *always* gotten paid retroactively after a shutdown, just like everybody else employed by the Federal government. Oh, except the actual members of Congress, who continue to receive their salaries during each shutdown.
954608132910563328 2018-01-19 06:54:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @GeorgiaDunnBCN I don't know about cons for comic writers in particular, but cons for SF&F writers, usually there's some sort of sign up on the con's website for people who are interested in being on panels, and topics they're into. Usually only BIG cons invite people, and then it's only 4 GoH.
954606813311307776 2018-01-19 06:49:34 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Oh, ffs, Kentucky. Seriously? It's like you're not even trying anymore.https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2018/01/19/prospect-police-officer-racist-messages-kill-blacks/1048979001/
954550661286305793 2018-01-19 03:06:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DMeroth Indeed. I don't think they'll have cooperation from the states that have already legalized anyway; too many tax dollars to be made off the industry. It's a political and economic loser.
954543383636148224 2018-01-19 02:37:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @CMikeSF Thanks! The pain is... always there, but I have a routine now that works for me.
954543059395534848 2018-01-19 02:36:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DMeroth Yep. And the whole ramping up of the war on marijuana is just crazy! I haven't used it myself (damn pee tests) but there are many people who get relief from chronic pain from it, and yet the Feds are re-criminalizing it, when it could help get people off opioids.
954541270726135808 2018-01-19 02:29:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @DMeroth Yep, it's a pain (no pun intended.) I wouldn't wish this struggle on anyone. It just makes me fume when people are like, "Just say no!" as if that's the answer to the problem, or treat it as an exercise in willpower.
954539221997338624 2018-01-19 02:20:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 15) I still have chronic pain. I'll always have chronic pain. I'm still on Percocet. I'm on two other medications for pain, as well as a muscle relaxant.   But I'm one of the lucky ones. I *didn't* get addicted. I *didn't* accidentally overdose.   Not everyone is as lucky. /end
954538330678374401 2018-01-19 02:17:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 14) It took over five years for me to get off methadone. Anywhere along there, I could have had an accidental overdose. I could have decided that I needed the pain relief more than I wanted to get off the methadone. I could have begged for more. Become addicted.
954536845898993664 2018-01-19 02:11:33 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 13) Otherwise, the shakes, the headaches, the sweats, oh god, it could be awful. No. Slow and steady. In the meantime, I got steroid injections, nerve cauterizations, etc., to help with the pain, plus a couple new non-opioidal medications to take methadone's place.
954535885105545217 2018-01-19 02:07:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 12) But remember, the methadone isn't cutting it anymore. Not even the super high dose. With the new Pain Care Doc, I start to slowly, carefully come off of it. Methadone is *extremely* addictive. I would take two weeks just to reduce my dose by 1/2 a pill.
954535256245264384 2018-01-19 02:05:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 11)... I wasn't using marijuana. Even though Oregon was at the time a medical marijuana state (and now it's legal for recreational use), it was against the rules to mix it with opioids. Which, I can understand, see above regarding cloudy thoughts.
954534472942198785 2018-01-19 02:02:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 10) So I did. All along, with my Internist, I'd had to take mandatory drug tests (pee in a cup) while on opioids, to make sure I was "in compliance." That's fancy talk for, I was taking my meds as prescribed, not too much, or too little (and selling the extra) and most important,
954533840462036992 2018-01-19 01:59:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 9) The biggest problem for my tolerance was that I was already over the new guidelines in my state for what Doctors were allowed to prescribe for chronic pain. I had to go to a Pain Specialist instead, if I still wanted to take methadone at all, never mind at my current level.
954533147982495744 2018-01-19 01:56:51 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 8) I never overdosed. Over time, however, I found the methadone wasn't working as well as it had. It's a problem with opioids called "tolerance" where you have to keep increasing the dose to get the desired effect. It's not addiction, that's different. But it's still awful.
954532322342199297 2018-01-19 01:53:34 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 7) As I said, I was careful.   But opioids can cloud your thoughts, even if you're not on a super high dose.   Did I already take the noon dose?   How long ago was the last Percocet?   One beer won't hurt.....
954531633922678784 2018-01-19 01:50:50 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 6) But I was very careful.   Odd, that I had at my disposal the means to so easily, accidentally end my life, when years ago, as I've confessed previously, I attempted suicide numerous times and did not succeed. Now I had no wish to, and yet had the means.
954530916545699841 2018-01-19 01:47:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 5) It wasn't a low dose of methadone either, but over 3,000 morphine equivalents. And I also had Percocet for breakthrough pain, up to 4xdaily. The possibility of overdose was very high. So was the possibility of addiction.
954529198026121216 2018-01-19 01:41:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 4) The Internist and I spent several weeks trying to find medications that would alleviate my pain. We tried all sorts of things, including fentanyl patches, morphine, and 1/2 dozen non-opioids, but the one that finally worked was methadone.
954528383588737024 2018-01-19 01:37:55 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 3) I myself am on opioid medications for chronic pain. I have a variety of diagnoses that I won't bore you with, but round about 12 years ago, I'd finally had enough of my General Practitioner telling me there was nothing they could do. They recommended an Internist.
954527637363294210 2018-01-19 01:34:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 2) Well, kids, it's not. Petty was touring with a cracked hip. He was on pain killers. Probably strong ones. I don't know the details of how much or what cocktail stopped his breathing or his heart, but let me tell you a little of what I do know about: opioids and chronic pain.
954527057941180417 2018-01-19 01:32:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 1) Okay, so opioids. The news about Tom Petty's cause of death has brought the issue forward for a lot of people. That it was an "accidental overdose," that he was "addicted," as if those were monstrous things or out of the ordinary for someone with chronic pain.
954525719966568448 2018-01-19 01:27:20 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddiamond @Chris24405745 We can have both problems at the same time. 38,000 gun violence deaths in 2016 is nothing to sneeze at.

954222744303894528 2018-01-18 05:23:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @StormResist @exoticgamora @Robert97207405 Even if Dems take both Houses, Impeachment is very unlikely. Conviction in the Senate requires 2/3 majority, which Dems won't have after Nov. bc not enough Repubs are up for re-election. We'd need at least 9-10 Repubs to vote to convict a Repub President.
954221740623720448 2018-01-18 05:19:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @exoticgamora Not just a majority in the Senate, a 2/3 majority, which the Dems will not have after this November, even if we win even R seat, bc too few Rs are up for re-election. Even if Dems win every Senate seat they can in Nov., we'd still need 9-10 Rs to vote to convict.

953081362155585536 2018-01-15 01:47:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Dad would end up leaving the priesthood (in 1966) after he was told off by the Bishop one too many times about his activism. He never gave up working to help those who were oppressed or less fortunate, the homeless or vote-suppressed. I know he'd still be doing so today.
953079880777850880 2018-01-15 01:42:05 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The speech was profound, Dad said, and he was touched by it, but its true impact would not be felt for years, with the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, and the shift in politics between Dems and Republicans.
953078498268086272 2018-01-15 01:36:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> My Dad was by no means near enough to the front of that crowd of 200-300,000 people to see the speakers, but he could hear, mostly. Roy Wilkins and John Lewis and at the very end, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
953076324179984386 2018-01-15 01:27:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> those that might have fainted couldn't fall. There wasn't enough water. There weren't enough bathrooms.  But the energy! The energy, he said, was amazing. Like everyone knew the day was special. They walked and they walked, and there was singing sometimes, and excited talking.
953075693595770881 2018-01-15 01:25:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> And so he goes.   I've heard the story several times, but I've forgotten some of the details. I don't recall who he went with, but I know he didn't go alone. The day was very hot, he said. People pressed in from all sides. So tightly together that
953074864817975296 2018-01-15 01:22:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So here's my Dad, Catholic priest in a conservative parish, going to social justice meetings, giving sanctuary to draftees, working with the homeless, going to rallies and protests and...then there's news about a March on Washington D.C., for Jobs and Freedom.
953073932587868160 2018-01-15 01:18:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> He was getting involved in the Civil Rights movement, too, while also going to Boston and helping some friends of his who were just starting up a homeless shelter in Roxbury-- it was through this group at Haley House that he met my Mom.
953072738708566016 2018-01-15 01:13:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> New Hampshire has never been a bastion of liberalness, but Dad was very lefty, and he got himself into a few scrapes with the Archdiocese after going to various rallies to protest Vietnam, and even worse, being interviewed by a paper at one. He was a rebel, my Da. /2
953071887814295552 2018-01-15 01:10:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> My Dad was born in 1933. When he was 13, as a good first-born Irish Catholic son, he went to seminary, and he spent the next 20 years studying to be, and then actively being, a Catholic priest. Once he had been ordained, he'd been sent to a parish in NH.

Most of them are for just a handful. Surely units can maintain operations for 3-5 days without a special funding bill.

I do. First of all, they blamed him, obviously. But folks were pissed mostly bc they couldn't get into museums and nat'l parks. Nobody mentioned the military.

You still pay your Medicare premium, but then you can spend a bit extra on an "advantage" program to get drug benefits, or lower copays or whathaveyou. I'm on one myself.  Also 50% of births in US are paid with Medicaid. 65% of nursinghome folks.

He's just in it for the money. But the people he surrounded himself with (Bannon, Miller, Gorka, etc.) want to "burn it all down." And they're doing a bang up job.

But by 2027, that's not going to be the case. The only group still feeling all benefits and no drawbacks will be the wealthy. Make sure to scroll to the "tax hikes on the poor" chart.https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/heres-how-the-final-gop-tax-bill-would-hit-your-wallet.html

He's got multiple lawsuits against him for emoluments clause infractions, among other things, and he makes the Secret Service pay him (a lot) to stay at his clubs to protect him.

We saw this very recently with Tom Price, buying shares in a company then introducing legislation that would help it, and at least 6 of DJT's Cabinet Secr. are being questioned about exorbitant travel expenses.

Remember Ronald Reagan? He tripled the debt, and 75% of the 324,000 federal employees added during his reign were non-military.

Our position is that the GOP is enriching itself by levying taxes on the poor and middle classes and reducing taxes for themselves and other wealthy people and corporations. The GOP always squawks about reducing the size..

Yes, with more land and subjects, they have more people to tax, but mostly, it's raising taxes. Second, it's "Democratic" position, not "Democrat." If you want to keep it civil, don't be insulting.

949569919800066048 2018-01-06 09:14:45 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> This, and her tweeted show segment that follows, are disheartening, yes, but we are strong, we are stronger together, and we will #resist. We will weather this storm.  We have no choice.https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/949467162397339648
949568276702552065 2018-01-06 09:08:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Seems like a bit of projection, to me. Also, they quote @CNN. I thought CNN was fake news. So... are they fake in this criticism of the book, too? Is this the UpsideDown?https://twitter.com/GOP/status/949395088735723520
949567564069269505 2018-01-06 09:05:24 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> A rather unflattering portrait of the president as an old, orange man.https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/949306499259555840
949562630049419265 2018-01-06 08:45:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Jerkwad still taking credit for Obama's accomplishments. It'll be interesting to see how many Superfund sites get delisted *this* year, now that Pruitt can't piggyback off of Obama's work anymore.http://abcn.ws/2qxOeDG
949555421202735104 2018-01-06 08:17:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The Trump-Fox Feedback Loop: Fox spews the day's propaganda, DJT regurgitates it, then all media obsesses about it all day. It's time to stop giving the Orange Menace so much attention for what he craps out. If we're that interested, we can see it on Fox.http://politi.co/2Av9v0f

949480569783558144 2018-01-05 03:19:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenatorCollins Now if you could just protect poor people, or folks on Medicare and Medicaid with that same ferocity, we'd have something.

949457540852588544 2018-01-05 01:48:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @thehill @EashiaT It's the President pro tempore of the Senate, which right now is: Orrin Hatch. So, um....yeah, there's that.
949456718412394501 2018-01-05 01:44:56 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @paulkrugman @TheBluFalcon That's the thing, they keep throwing all these diversions up into the air and everybody runs around trying to catch them like they're $100 bills. Hopefully Mueller & Co. are still undistracted, but this Congress has proved they'll do nothing with his findings anyway.
949454916828913664 2018-01-05 01:37:46 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> But.. but it's a thing now! A thing I must have!https://twitter.com/netflix/status/949449196536393728

949452795941347328 2018-01-05 01:29:21 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @paulkrugman @TheBluFalcon They're saying he made false or conflicting statements to investigators (FBI and/or Senate.) Of note: Sen. Blumenthal, also on the Committee, basically says they're full of sh1t.
949448384783400960 2018-01-05 01:11:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Then he should have to use his actual @POTUS account for special status.

949446369600716802 2018-01-05 01:03:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> A good thread. Essence is: we need to take to the streets. We can't wait for Mueller to save us, or for Congress to do the right thing. They won't. He can't. It's OUR country, it's OUR responsibility, it's time we took it back.https://twitter.com/kazweida/status/949387780190232576

949439231893544962 2018-01-05 00:35:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Interesting that they have said diddley-squat about the fact that Sessions has lied to them over and over, yet is still AG.

All had a huge impact on the current state of today's GOP, and not for the better.
949168657828954112 2018-01-04 06:40:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> A bad night for #KingDotard over all, methinks.

We have a fight on our hands for the Dem Senators in some red states just to hold the line. We could maybe pick up a couple of those R senate seats, but I fear we're gonna lose some, too. We have too many in play at once.
949149021183950848 2018-01-04 05:22:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Of course he did, the spineless dirtbag. Nunes is supposed to have *recused* himself from this investigation, yet he's nose deep in it, investigating the freaking investigators, and now Ryan's holding the traitor's beer.http://cnn.it/2ArgcAv

949129222882148353 2018-01-04 04:03:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> She has her old flip phone charged and she can call for help if she needs it.

She will freeze in her home without heat. She can't even boil water for a cup of tea since her stove is electrical, too.   /3
949118567621865472 2018-01-04 03:21:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Even her phone is attached to the electricity, bc she has it bundled with her cable and internet.

949117720582266881 2018-01-04 03:17:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I live in Oregon.

I'm just going to pretend you're uninformed rather than willfully ignorant. But you might look into the definition of kleptocracy, for one thing.

By Impeachment or 25th Amendment. Armed insurrection to stop it would be, in these circumstances, illegal. If you want to play Constitutional Crisis, bring it.
948399759663890434 2018-01-02 03:44:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @sfgirlbybay I'd contribute.

Once, I was able to scrounge the back-dues from family and friends, and the other, we applied for this program. But we were way underwater on our mortgage at that time, and my husband had just lost his job.

Okay, I just looked it up. It was Oregon Homeownership Assistance Initiative, which   /1
947987015865319424 2018-01-01 00:24:51 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass @VegasGaryGreene It was part of the stimulus package, I think. I'd have to go back and research, but ultimately it was taxpayers that kept me in my home. Instead of the costs of yet another foreclosure impacting on the economy.
947983515336900610 2018-01-01 00:10:57 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass Happy New Year to you, too! May it be (please!) better than the last.
947981678340816896 2018-01-01 00:03:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass Yeah. A few amusing memes have come out of that pic, and I understand that they belong to a very exclusive club of "people who were once US President," so they're bound to socialize, but still.
947980933495373824 2018-01-01 00:00:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass I'm sorry to hear that. The "Great Recesssion" screwed so many good people over. Given that reality can never be as good as our dreams, I was....satisfied for the most part with Obama, especially considering the alternatives. But there were a few things I won't forgive him for.
947976788017213441 2018-01-01 23:44:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass Of course, I also believe the Bush admin should've been prosecuted for war crimes for using torture, to at the very least put a dampener on any future president wanting to do so again, but that ship seems to have sailed.
947976185023053824 2018-01-01 23:41:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass Now that I will agree with. Wholeheartedly. There definitely should have been consequences for the arses that ruined the housing market and thus the economy, beyond a few fines.

They were rubberstamping foreclosures like it was a Christmas orgy, remember? Mnuchin himself foreclosed on, what was it, 36,000 homes all by his lonesome.
947968033498079232 2018-01-01 23:09:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @NateSilver538 @tkassen @marktilfordbass My family was actually explicitly helped out of foreclosure by the Obama administration, by a program made available for people who had lost jobs. We got our mortgage paid for a year, as well as the 2 months we were in arrears, and 20% of the loan was forgiven each year.
947760186160136192 2018-01-01 09:23:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> And all that money is going directly in #KingDotard's pockets, not to mention whatever the Secret Service had to pay to stay at his club for the past week while watching him golf.

947261539471409152 2017-12-30 00:22:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So, not, as DJT claimed, with the Steele Dossier?

There was bias at the FBI, for sure, it's just not where #KingDotard said it was.https://nyti.ms/2q0nOds

If Russia can be considered an enemy (as the USSR certainly was during the Cold War) then giving them aid & comfort (ie lifting sanctions in exchange for assistance on election) would be considered treason.

947011897689124865 2017-12-29 07:50:05 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Another really good book on what happened to the Lakota in particular is "Black Elk Speaks," by John G. Neihardt. Black Elk was a Healer and visionary among the Oglala Lakota, and it's quite a powerful story of his life.
947008772798496768 2017-12-29 07:37:40 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Dec. 29, 1890: The Wounded Knee Massacre. Approximately 300 Lakota were murdered, a majority of them women and children. There're many books about the late 1800s & Natives, but one of the best, I think is "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee" by Dee Brown.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EdRT56WK7Q&sns=tw

It is the document by which the colonies broke free from England, it holds the "promise" of a future government, but the Constitution is the "fulfillment" of that promise. It is actual law.

You can hardly blame the post office for its ruination when Congress has made it impossible for it to be solvent. They're not even allowed to set the prices for stamps. How can they keep to a budget with so little control over income or outlays?
946927942252109824 2017-12-29 02:16:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @SophiaHelwani You're not arguing in good faith. You may be a comic, but I don't find this issue funny. Destroying the USPS would hurt a lot of people, even if you're not one of them. Good night.

946917026177605632 2017-12-29 01:33:06 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @SophiaHelwani Seriously? There're a lot of places you can't get pizza delivered either. Don't be so naive. The free market will do bugger all, but make it much harder for small businesses to be competitive with shipping. You care about small businesses, don't you?
946916392418271232 2017-12-29 01:30:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @SophiaHelwani And I doubt my state wants to use UPS to mail out ballots, when it's much cheaper to use the government run program. No, the only problem with the postal service is that GOP Congress has been deliberately trying to kill it for years with pre-pay pension requirements and the like.
946915579939635201 2017-12-29 01:27:21 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @SophiaHelwani Not in rural areas. There are already places in the US that FedEx & UPS won't deliver to as it's too expensive for them. They piggyback on USPS. And what about our overseas soldiers? Can you imagine how much those companies would charge for letters to Afghanistan?
946914938051641344 2017-12-29 01:24:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @exoticgamora @gingerlady73 Absolutely. I'm wanting a blue wave of tsunami proportions. Although... even if we gain back both houses, we definitely won't have a 2/3 majority in the Senate (not enough Rs up for re-election) so, we won't be able to convict DT without Rs help.

944824349822816257 2017-12-23 06:57:33 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @mikefarb1 @gnimie I tend to look at the content people are posting, whether they've added their own comments to quoted RTs, and if they comment on other people's stuff or just do retweets. But I'm still fairly new to all this (just joined Twitter in August) so, big grains of salt.
944822481965035520 2017-12-23 06:50:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @mikefarb1 @pggntfn I get a 404 error for the site. Has something happened to it?
944822026446893057 2017-12-23 06:48:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @mikefarb1 @GregSoriano5 Exactly. Even when my husband tells me he's read something, I always ask him to cite his source, if it's something I haven't read myself or sounds too "out there." I've saved both him and me from embarrassment that way.
944817974350712832 2017-12-23 06:32:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Is anyone even surprised by this? I mean, *honestly surprised*?https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind/status/944364276080406528

My favorite cousin turned out to be a complete asshole and Trumpanzee on FB, and I had to put him in a time out, so I didn't have to see his crap. I hadn't seen him in years, but I was still really surprised.
944815052560855040 2017-12-23 06:20:37 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @joncoopertweets Unfortunately, even IF we take back both houses of Congress, we won't have the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to actually convict DT if the House of Reps impeaches. There's NO WAY Repubs will vote to convict. Especially if Pence is impeached, too.

944806073671696386 2017-12-23 05:44:56 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SaharaBix Stockholm syndrome is part of it, I think. Tribalism. And being told the same lie over and over and never listening to anyone outside your bubble... or not wanting to, because then you might have to start thinking that the things you've been told and believed are lies.

His Dotardness can sue (and probably wld) if they say specific things are certain and known, when they're still "alleged." I'm pretty sure that's why.
944146356246953985 2017-12-22 10:03:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Nice gesture, but it's like trying to hold water in a sieve: the Dems have no power in the House right now; all they have is the means for symbolic gestures.

943642754281701377 2017-12-20 00:42:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The only way to reverse this travesty will be once there's a Democrat in the WH, since even if Dems retake the House & Senate in 2018 (likely pipe dream), it won't be a veto-proof majority, and no Repub President will ever sign any changes to the TaxScam into law.

While I can understand why we went to war with Afghanistan, I believe Iraq was a very costly mistake, both in lives and $, not least bc it divided our forces, leaving the job 1/2 done in Afgh.

Read the fucking article.

CEOs have already said what they're going to do with their massive windfalls, and it's *not* capital investment. It's stock buybacks and executive bonuses and dividends. More money for the shareholders & increased stock prices. Not jobs. Not wages.

No more cures.

938659133720379393 2017-12-06 06:39:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @eep222 The other thing about that original accusation is that is was a fabrication. Or at least some of it was. She said he'd written the part that year, just to kiss her, but there's video of that skit from 3 years earlier. It's fishy. I wish he'd stay and go thru the investigation.
938657559551946752 2017-12-06 06:32:56 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The @GOP is playing the Dems for fools. Sure, we take the high road, which is great and all. But in so doing, we miss seeing that the GOP has tunneled under the road in their rush to get to the castle, and now the road's about to collapse, taking us all down with it. /end
938656637602078720 2017-12-06 06:29:16 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> And it's not like Republicans are going to do anything to address the "serial gropers" and sexual assaulters in their party. Trump will stay President. Moore will (probably) be elected to the Senate. Remember how long it took to get Ensign to resign? /4
938654974694715393 2017-12-06 06:22:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> On the gripping hand, Franken has done good things in the Senate. He's helped people. Can Dems afford to lose him? Not to mention, it opens up yet another Dem Senate seat for 2018, and Dems suck badly in midterm elections. /3
938653778726731776 2017-12-06 06:17:54 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> On the other hand, about half of the women accusing him are staying anonymous, and at least 2 of the remaining have ties to RWNJs like Roger Stone and Hannity.  /2
938653190936961024 2017-12-06 06:15:34 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> I'm honestly of two minds about this.

938260914725298176 2017-12-05 04:16:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Interesting. Now, if he'd made more than a purely symbolic $100 gesture, it'd tip from "interesting" into "kinda cool."

937533167363276800 2017-12-03 04:05:00 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @RBReich @GuesthouseGreg One idea is to hit them where it hurts: right in the pocketbook. If this boycott works, we stretch it out longer and longer til they break!https://mobile.twitter.com/WomanResistorNC/status/937108477209726976

937478146680430592 2017-12-03 00:26:22 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Paul Ryan has touted a list of economists who support the GOP tax cut, but the list holds up under scrutiny about as well as the tax plan itselfhttps://interc.pt/2BzVd0l

Got his college education on good ol' survivor benefits, aka Social Security.  Funny, Ayn Rand got Social Security, too... could it be Ryan, too, is a massive hypocrite in addition to a massive douche?

937203259210579970 2017-12-02 06:14:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @Politipickle They *are* taxed on income. The tax bill wants to tax them on waived tuition, that is, money they never got because it was in lieu of the work they did as research grunts. So, you get $20K/yr stipend & $40K/yr tuition waiver, but will now be taxed on $60K? That's not cool.
937202019521085440 2017-12-02 06:09:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Interesting. Why did no one see this coming?    Wonder if @SenatorCollins even gives a rat's ass that ol' @SenateMajLdr Mitch told her a bald faced lie.https://twitter.com/nytpolitics/status/937133045882277888
937200871502331905 2017-12-02 06:04:34 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @nytpolitics @kenziwantsmore Maybe. It depends what happens in the reconciliation talks btwn the House & Senate, since they each passed a different bill. If Mitch can get Ryan to run w/the Senate bill, instead of them hammering out a 3rd mixed bill, the Senate won't have to vote again, but the House wld.

937197257039822848 2017-12-02 05:50:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @nytpolitics @TucsonBlonde @chris_mahan Yep. Paul Ryan has fantasizing about getting rid of SS, Medicare and Medicaid since he was a wee Randian, and he cannot wait to get an entitlements "overhaul" bill before our Orange Rubberstamp Menace.
937196468527448064 2017-12-02 05:47:05 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @nytpolitics @trytostopJane @PeterWombat Well, yeah, but the word's been twisted into something nasty the Right uses to mean, illogically, something you haven't necessarily earned the right to, like welfare. Better to use something like "earned benefits."
937195319867011073 2017-12-02 05:42:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @nytpolitics @sequinpants @stephenanuno Right, and then, after many years of having FICA taken out of your paycheck, guess what? You're old, and you now qualify for the benefits you paid into for all those years. You know, unless the GOP eliminated it in the meantime, like they want to. Then you're shit out of luck.

And they can donate money, too, now. Real loss of separation of church & state.
936889346895917057 2017-12-02 09:26:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Lawrence Latter, I'm guessing. McConnell won't want any chance of not getting the votes a second time. There's more wiggle room in the House.

936880427184267264 2017-12-02 08:51:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @MayorOfTopanga Well, Rubio just admitted that when the deficit explodes, they're going after Social Security, Medicare and "welfare reform" (ie Medicaid, SNAP, etc.) next. Very soon, in fact. I hazard a guess that's been part of the real motivation all along. Oh, and sweet big donor money.

936796906214252544 2017-12-01 03:19:21 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @biggamebull Peace on you, as well!
936796375244726273 2017-12-01 03:17:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 15. Unfortunately, the question isn't, "is it going to get that bad?" No, the question is, "how long til we get there?" /end
936796027473891329 2017-12-01 03:15:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 14. Can it happen? I don't know. People in Red States would have to get on board, too, and as long as they think everything's fine, they're not about to change. It's going to have to get pretty bad, first, before any kind of real uprising happens, whether economic or otherwise.
936795276089556992 2017-12-01 03:12:53 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 13. How long before they pressured Congress to "Do Something!" To listen, to us. To work, for us. To "do something," for us.
936794500206272513 2017-12-01 03:09:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 12. If everyone (and it would have to be pretty much everyone) in the middle/lower classes refused to buy anything but the absolute minimum for survival (basic food), how long would it take for the CEOs to cry Uncle? How long before *they* started making changes?
936793290287886336 2017-12-01 03:04:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 11.  We have to hit them where it hurts. Where their *donors* hurt. Their rich, corporate donors. If the *donors* felt the pinch, they just might get the GOP to listen.  And the way to make the corporations hurt is through a nationwide boycott.   Of.   Everything.
936792256685621248 2017-12-01 03:00:53 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 10. It's going to take something different. Something they'll pay attention to. Something they'll actually *care* about, to get them to listen to us, the American people.  And what does the GOP care about?  Money.
936791812810817536 2017-12-01 02:59:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 9. But they don't listen. And voting is great. I've done it since I was 18. But the GOP is rigging the system, with every trick they can: gerrymandering, voter ID laws, phony commissions on fraud, even stacking the courts so that if we challenge them, we're dismissed.
936791032745705474 2017-12-01 02:56:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 8  Of course, this is depressing. It should be. It would be so easy to curl up in a ball and cry until the bad men go away. But They're Not Going Away.  We're going to have to MAKE THEM.
936790539801829376 2017-12-01 02:54:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 7 As for Medicaid, 65% of nursing home residents are supported primarily thru Medicaid. Nearly 50% of all births in the US are covered by Medicaid. What happens to them if Medicaid goes away? What happens to the disabled who need ofttimes expensive care?
936789126875037697 2017-12-01 02:48:27 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 6 Likewise Medicare. Try and imagine, if you will, making a decision between buying your life-saving medication or food each month. Between being an active participant in society vs being bedridden for want of a simple surgery you can't afford.
936788366107873280 2017-12-01 02:45:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 5  If they succeed in this second (and arguably primary, for some GOPers) goal, there will be widespread devastation. The only thing keeping 80% of Seniors out of abject poverty is Social Security. (Even with SS, 25-30% are still at or under poverty line.)
936787677885558784 2017-12-01 02:42:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 4  When the deficit blooms like an onion (and it will bloom) the GOP will wring their hands and say, "Oh, look! This is bad for the future! We need to cut *entitlements*! They are a drag on the budget." And then they'll try to destroy Medicaid. And Medicare. And Social Security.
936786762025725952 2017-12-01 02:39:03 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 3 When Grad students' waivers are taxed like income, they'll stop going to Grad school, and much of the research that is performed by them--into life-saving medical treatments and cures-- will cease.
936786067868434432 2017-12-01 02:36:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 2 When Medicare cuts happen (and they will happen) people will die for want of care or medicine. When SNAP loses funding (and it will lose funding) children will go to school hungry (if their school manages to stay open) and many Seniors will slowly starve to death.
936785152293740545 2017-12-01 02:32:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @biggamebull Yeah. I was on the phone with my 80 yr old Mom a few hours ago, and we were both crying and shouting at the same time.
936784833287561217 2017-12-01 02:31:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> 1 The tax bill is going to pass. It's pretty clear the GOP isn't listening to its constituents. It's not listening to economists, or the CBO or even their colleagues. The majority of Americans are going to be financially hurt by this bill. A large portion will be hurt physically.
936783796262789120 2017-12-01 02:27:16 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @biggamebull Even then. People have been calling for days. Some GOP senators' voicemail boxes are full, have been full, for days. They're not listening to us. At all.
936781875103727616 2017-12-01 02:19:38 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @jason272fist You are changing the goal posts.
936781291156004865 2017-12-01 02:17:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @billyeichner @SenatorTester @chalbohn You vote to change the entire US economy in law school after being given illegible notes on a 479pg bill and no time to read it? Wow.
936777948878819328 2017-12-01 02:04:02 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @jason272fist I'd like to introduce you to Norway. And Finland. And like a half dozen other places that are quite a bit farther towards socialism than we could ever dream, and they seem to be doing quite well, tyvm. And then I will laugh at your navet about jobs coming "back" via this bill.
936776711911366656 2017-12-01 01:59:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @red_bieb There's actually a bible verse some of them use to justify it: "The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me." Matthew 26:11
936775919145951234 2017-12-01 01:55:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @BrandNew535 @justicedems @neurovessels @RPDtweets @luciusringwald Here's hoping. In the meantime, the GOP will continue to genuflect to their corporate overlords.
936775082743021568 2017-12-01 01:52:38 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @jason272fist If by "socialism" you mean "communism" you should know they aren't the same thing. At all. And my point is, the government shouldn't be a kleptocracy.   If they *really* wanted to stimulate the economy, they'd pour that $Trillion into a New Green Deal, creating jobs and industry.
936773852520112128 2017-12-01 01:47:45 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @altLofC My husband is of the opinion (and I have to concur, at least sometimes) that no one who *wants* to be president should ever be *allowed* to become president. A similar argument can be made for other high powered offices.
936772452289351681 2017-12-01 01:42:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @VelcroYuppie Oh, he remembers (I'm sure he's been reminded.) He just doesn't care. Remember, IOKIYAR!
936724187950997505 2017-12-01 22:30:24 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @mikefarb1 Unfortunately, he's the only one.
936723869510930432 2017-12-01 22:29:08 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @HillaryClinton @EricIndyv6 It's crazy! I've voted every chance I've had since I was 18. I don't understand people who abrogate their responsibility like that. Part of living in a civilized society is doing your part to maintain that civilization.
936721071952113664 2017-12-01 22:18:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @stitchesbekrazy It did. Does. Yeah. (Weird, I'm trying to like your reply, but the heart keeps blinking back off of red.)
936720216477745152 2017-12-01 22:14:37 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The lone @GOP holdout, ladies and gentlemen. And not bc this travesty of a tax bill will devastate healthcare for millions of people or raise taxes on many millions more, especially the poor, while the rich get richer. No. Just bc the nat'l debt wld increase. Thanks for nothing.https://twitter.com/SenBobCorker/status/936714880253616128
936714802230996993 2017-12-01 21:53:06 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @EricIndyv6 Oh, I know. I vote for every race, even school board positions and I don't even have kids. My state has two Dem Senators. My US Rep is a Dem. Even my mayor is. But I'm still gonna be screwed over bc of the 1/2 of America that doesn't vote, and the 1/4 that goes GOP.
936713851176763393 2017-12-01 21:49:20 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @stitchesbekrazy Oh, yeah. Until, it's the middle of the night and you're awakened to the sound of the closet door loudly creaking open. And then the inevitable crash of stuff falling as he tries for one of the upper shelves and misses.
936712409493807104 2017-12-01 21:43:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> What the Everloving Fuck? One of my Senators (Wyden) complained that he didn't know what was in the tax bill. McConnell said he could READ IT AFTER IT PASSED.   I want to beat Mitch to death with a copy of the Constitution. Maybe it'll osmosis its way in.http://www.politicususa.com/2017/12/01/mitch-mcconnell-admitted-allowed-read-tax-cut-bill-passes.html
936708665079246848 2017-12-01 21:28:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump @cryptostack @rcwardlaw @noah_nonsense That's a radical interpretation of the thread. But sure, alternative facts are your thing.
936708185775210497 2017-12-01 21:26:49 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @StephanieTemo Ikr? Collins is all, "I'm delighted I got them to give back SALT!" And hundreds of people are replying, "But healthcare!" and, "Um, so what? We have that now!" Like so much else, it's sometimes hard to know whether she's being deliberately obtuse or willfully ignorant.
936706648172740608 2017-12-01 21:20:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @No2Rezone Yeah, but they're a breaky bunch. I have the shards of many an heirloom to prove it.
936706398301253632 2017-12-01 21:19:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenatorCollins Delighted is an odd word to use about a bill that will result in so much pain and suffering for millions of Americans, many of them from Maine. SALT isn't going to help them when they lose their health insurance, SS, education grants or jobs when the inevitable recession hits.
936701072432705536 2017-12-01 20:58:33 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Mitch McConnell says he has the votes for the tax bill now. Flake is a YES.  Collins has indicated YES, too.  But NO ONE has read the bill that will be voted on. They're still making changes Right Now.  I'm so... I just can't... I don't have the energy to even anymore.
936522574032379906 2017-12-01 09:09:16 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @JuliaHB1 @MrBrendanCox @ajfkosovo White men are responsible for 99% of mass shootings in this country. Amazing that no one is asking for all of them to be locked up or deported.
936521759423053824 2017-12-01 09:06:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @MrBrendanCox @KingKing3107 @DavidLHarper @sparklecreek @putt1ck @alwheate @John_Papa @newenay Ah, but didn't you know? Repealing the Johnson Amendment is part of the GOP Tax Grift! The churches will have all the politics they want with no tax penalties. What's this silly separation of Church and State thing anyway...
936519385778237440 2017-12-01 08:56:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @grizatlcp The article suggests investing in education is key. And funding social programs (ie safety nets for the impoverished or unemployed.) But that's not going to happen without changing who's currently in charge of the govt.
936518585643515904 2017-12-01 08:53:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> This article is from April, but it's perhaps even more important to read today, given the GOP Tax Grift Plan. Heavy debt, stagnant wages, job insecurity, eroding middle class, suppression of workers, crumbling infrastructure, etc. Yup. We've regressed.http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-developing-nation-regressing-economy-poverty-donald-trump-mit-economist-peter-temin-a7694726.html
936512822040707073 2017-12-01 08:30:30 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> That'd be cool and all, if 1) it was actually *rare*; and 2) it was less likely to get people (like Americans in foreign embassies) killed to leave them up than if you deleted them.https://twitter.com/cnni/status/936298944958787585
936509784949264384 2017-12-01 08:18:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Exactly what we knew would happen. I hate to say I told you so, Trumpsters, but....https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/936422111849189376
936500480552734720 2017-11-30 07:41:28 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @Dalton_Raccoon It seems to have worked for them so far. As long as they vow to never ever ever let women have the right to choose, a lot of "conservatives" will vote for them and close their eyes to anything else.
936499772935962624 2017-11-30 07:38:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 NOBODY can do it all on their own. Well, except maybe million/billionaires and their kids that don't have to pay an inheritance tax. Eventually, even middle class people grow old and need Medicare and Social Security. Even with these programs, tho, poverty among elderly is high.
936497436402507777 2017-11-30 07:29:22 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 You make the hard decision to place them in a facility that caters to people with dementia. It runs $6,000/month, not incl. meds or tests. It burns through the money your parent saved through their entire life, and the money from selling their house in < 5 years. Now what?
936496590813933568 2017-11-30 07:26:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 Medications? Don't get me started. My husband, with MS, has *one* that costs $7,000/month. At the end of life, we all like to think we can take of elderly parents on our own, but what if yours has dementia? What if they get violent, or leave the house at night & get lost?
936495933017145344 2017-11-30 07:23:24 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 Do you even know how much doctor's visits cost? Now, triple that for a specialist for your child's particular disability. How many visits? Does the kid need an MRI? $3,000. How about surgery? Anywhere from $15K for a quickie, up to $500K for a week of recovery in the hospital.
936494769798242304 2017-11-30 07:18:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 What? You seem to be suffering under the delusion that even middle class folks can somehow insure that they can EVER support an elderly parent or child with special needs without help. I'm here to tell you, t'ain't so.
936493646676836353 2017-11-30 07:14:19 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 And anyway, legally the parent isn't the one getting the assistance; it's the disabled or sick kid. And most of the time, the parents, even if there is only one, do work, if they have help via other programs: Head Start, for instance.
936492682796417025 2017-11-30 07:10:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Mikel_Jollett @TheRyanSorge @EliezerGewirtz1 Depends. Is hiring a full time nurse/skilled careworker via Medicaid cheaper than having a Mom or Dad take care of their kid and getting some food stamps?
936491733092786176 2017-11-30 07:06:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @sideshow_jim Yes, thank you, we know. Trying desperately to get him impeached and the whole GOP sent to jail, here.
936491221085667328 2017-11-30 07:04:40 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets @klj98290 Yep. And we need to overturn or legislate away Citizens United. Get dark money out of elections. For that matter, get all private funding out of elections. Every candidate gets an equal sum from one slush fund (based on level, location of race) and can spend no more than that.
936490351644229632 2017-11-30 07:01:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets That and cats.
936488766151188480 2017-11-30 06:54:55 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @abbydphillip @mkraju @Meeshared It would give him an excuse to: bomb more countries and take their oil, institute draconian anti-terrorism measures domestically, whip up his base further against all brown people, try to take on post-9/11 GWB-like aura of being "in control," like a martyr. It's all about him.
936487042413871104 2017-11-30 06:48:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @abbydphillip @TeaPainUSA @mkraju @nlm53 @VWalkama I think the hate crimes Lynn meant the President incited were *against* Muslims bc of the nature of the videos, especially since, like you say, that particular one had nothing to do with Muslims but was labeled as if it did.
936485617780768768 2017-11-30 06:42:24 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets Plus, they know they won't get any of that sweet, sweet Big Donor money for their next election cycle if they don't pay off their rich donors now with tax giveaways.
936485197985415168 2017-11-30 06:40:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @neurovessels @RPDtweets I think it's a "the ends justify the means" thing for them. They've wanted to dismantle the govt for so long (and Ryan is practically salivating at the opportunity to go after SS, Medicare, etc. next) they don't focus on the "little" people who will be hurt along the way.
936484021336338432 2017-11-30 06:36:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @stitchesbekrazy Heh, I've got five o' the buggers, and one is as stupid as a box of nails. But he's entertaining. Otoh, my eldest (Pounce, 17) can open doors, so we had to baby lock various kitchen cabinets, like the one that holds his kibble. He's scary smart. With thumbs, he'd be dangerous.
936481722924908545 2017-11-30 06:26:56 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @bobbycannavale @neurovessels @Themrsshaw88 60% of households in the US have incomes under $75K as of 2016.

Trickle down has been tried and has failed, numerous times (see Kansas, most recently) so they don't have ignorance as an excuse. They know the CEOs are planning stock buybacks and dividend increases, not capital investments. So....  Evil.

He may have been a Jew who was executed by the Romans, and thus mentioned in passing by Tacitus, but there is *no consensus* among historians about the stories told in the gospels. Far from it.

After this repeal, premiums will skyrocket. Many won't be able to afford insurance. There'll be Medicare cutbacks. And Medicaid cutbacks, hurting mostly the elderly.
936356781747343360 2017-11-30 22:10:28 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @EricHolder @CC95135978 @mswilliams1 @rett73 Well then, why don't you sign up for health insurance under ACA? Many plans have no premium for low income people. Unless you think you'll never be in a car accident or get cancer or a 1,000 other things that could cost you s  of 1,000 of dollars in the hospital. Deadline 12/15

They've already said so. The deficit is going to explode, the money's got to come from somewhere.
936323059790655488 2017-11-30 19:56:28 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @EricHolder @CC95135978 @rett73 Medicaid only covers people up to certain income levels, too. Even on Medicare (since he's on Social Security Disability) there are copays and premiums. Which are going to rise with the repeal of the mandate, never mind the automatic cut of $25Billion from Medicare bc of Paygo.

What if you had a illness that meant you had to take medication for the rest of your life, and that med was $7K/month? My husband has MS. No insurance means no meds. No MRI 2/yr. No $400 Doc.

936296810380869632 2017-11-30 18:12:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So much for the Maverick. The last time "tax reform" happened, in 1986, the bill took *years* to finalize, and bipartisanship, and compromises on both sides. But McCain is "satisfied" with the "process" this bill has gone through.

935783016340664320 2017-11-29 08:10:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Family history is sometimes the only history we have, and I guess what I'm saying is that it shouldn't be discounted. So Senator Warren isn't *lying* about her heritage. But it's pretty fucked up for the President to use a ceremony with Navajo to call a Senator "Pocahontas." /end
935781805294215169 2017-11-29 08:05:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Nana's mother died when she was 6 or 7, and she never knew that side of her family, just her father's side, which was French-Canadian. All she had were a few stories from earliest childhood, that she shared with my Gran and my Mom, who shared them with me.  /9
935780814045847554 2017-11-29 08:01:46 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Anyway. Maybe this is particularly galling to me is because I'm part Mi'kmaq, but if anybody asked me for documents to prove it, I'd have to shrug. My great-grandmother was born in Nova Scotia, in 1890. She moved to Maine at age 2 after a fire. There's no birth certificate. /8
935779429451575296 2017-11-28 07:56:16 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Brown told her to take a DNA test to *prove* her heritage. His followers made war whoops and tomahawk chops at a rally. He claimed he didn't condone their actions, but said that the real offense was Warren checking the Native American box when she was white. Sound familiar?  /7
935778107792822273 2017-11-28 07:51:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Now, if you'll remember back to 2012, Scott Brown was quite disgusting about the whole business. He flat out said Sen. Warren could not possibly have Native ancestry due to her looks: "Professor Warren claimed that she was a Native American...And as you can see, she is not." /6
935776650989629446 2017-11-28 07:45:14 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Warren says she did so because she wanted to meet others like herself, others with Native American heritage, because it had been a big part of her own family history. /5
935774824298958849 2017-11-28 07:37:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Further, Sen. Warren never used her claim of being Native American for any financial gain. She didn't get scholarships with it, nor jobs, nor school acceptance. Nada. She listed herself as a minority in a publication of college law professors. That's all.  /4
935772968868859904 2017-11-28 07:30:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Yes, that's a little, tiny bit. It's probably not enough to show in one's skin tone, hair or bone structure. But to be a member of the Cherokee Nation, you need only be a descendant of someone listed on the Dawes Rolls. Doesn't matter what fraction of their bloodline you have. /3
935770090288701440 2017-11-28 07:19:09 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> She has maintained since the controversy started (in 2012, when Scott Brown brought it up) that, according to her family history, stories and even genealogy she's been able to have done, she is 1/32 Cherokee.  /2
935769470617911296 2017-11-28 07:16:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Another thing that pisses me off about the comment DJT made about Sen. Warren, in addition to the fact that it sidelined what should have been a moment to honor the Code Talkers, is that many people say it's been proven that Warren lied about her heritage.   No. It hasn't. /1
935763704565641217 2017-11-28 06:53:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> And he's still saying President Obama wasn't born in Hawaii? Jesus Crackerjack. That idiot needs a lie down, and a binky.https://nyti.ms/2ijcHZX

That how I learned about the ANWR drilling approval, too.

I'm not being facetious; I rely on hope pretty heavily these days. I give locally & also to charities that speak to me-- I gave pretty extensively for hurricane relief to TX, FL, and PR. And I like Donors Choose, for teachers who need funding.

But I don't know which of the GOP lovelies put the repeal into their tax "reform" bill, if that's what you're asking. It stinks no matter who did.

Almost no one gets cash benefits for longer than 6 months, and food stamps are harder to qualify for, and are for much less $ than they used to be. Welfare has been pared to the bone.

Like the Social Security and Medicare that people paid into all their working lives? That's not "welfare," that's what's *owed.* As for what else you probably consider welfare: TANF and SNAP benefits, those are for much less and far less often

933956534295347200 2017-11-23 07:12:44 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @realDonaldTrump YOU broke it, now it's YOURS, #Dotard. You even declared Obamacare dead at one of your EO signings. Don't you remember? I thought you had one of the greatest memories of all time...
933919850530971648 2017-11-23 04:46:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> But he had his own motives for doing things, his own grievances that needed redressing. His flaws, his talents, his (possibly immense) emotional baggage from losing all of his people to some illness.  So... Tisquantum was complicated. He was human. Like all of us.  /end
933918630068174849 2017-11-23 04:42:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> He was mourned by the English, Bradford in particular, who wrote about him extensively in his letters. And for many years, he was hailed as the epitome of the "Noble Savage," (a term thankfully out of favor) and celebrated as the man who saved the Pilgrims.
933918366271545344 2017-11-23 04:41:04 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> It was on one of these trips, in 1622, that he became suddenly ill and died.
933917559144857600 2017-11-23 04:37:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So Tisquantum stayed with the Pilgrims, continuing to teach them about the land around them, going on trade expeditions (though not to Massasoit's people, obviously) and assisting in other ways.
933917356031590400 2017-11-23 04:37:03 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The Pilgrims demurred.   Bradford had found him too valuable as an interpreter, and Squanto had been an enormous help in quelling several actual hostile actions before they turned into battles.
933916944473788416 2017-11-23 04:35:25 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> But then Massasoit cottoned on to what Tisquantum was up to and, feeling quite betrayed, sent word to the Pilgrims that they should turn him over for execution, or they should kill Squanto themselves. He even sent along a knife for them to do the job.
933916124760047616 2017-11-23 04:32:10 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Tisquantum had been hard done by. The English had taken him from his people and enslaved him. Massasoit had used him for his own ends. It's not terribly surprising he'd want some of his own back.
933915304299655168 2017-11-23 04:28:54 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Or by telling the Wampanoag that the Pilgrims stored the plague in barrels, and that they'd release it if they weren't given gifts, which.... well, you get the idea.
933914982139404288 2017-11-23 04:27:37 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> He also played the English off the Wampanoag like a pro.   He enriched himself variously, by telling the settlers, for instance, that Massasoit planned to attack, and could only be appeased through gifts... which he would then keep for himself.
933914514545709056 2017-11-23 04:25:46 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> He helped them learn the fur trade, taught them survival skills, acted as interpreter between the colony and it many Native neighbors. In fact, he lived with the English for the rest of his life, and became a good friend of Governor Bradford's.
933914033316552706 2017-11-23 04:23:51 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> He helped with a treaty between the Wampanoag and the Pilgrims that lasted til after Massasoit's death. He taught the Pilgrims how to plant "Indian" corn in mounds, with fish as fertilizer. How to let beans climb the corn stalks and the squash cover the ground to reduce weeds.
933912615788539906 2017-11-23 04:18:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Perhaps these English settlers, with their women and children to protect, would be interested in a mutually beneficial agreement to aid each other if threatened by a third party. To sweeten the deal for Squanto, Massasoit promised him his freedom if he was successful. And he was.
933911547910356992 2017-11-23 04:13:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Massasoit needed help to stave off hostilities from a rival tribe to the south, the Narragansett, who had not suffered the same losses from illness that the Wampanoag had. So Massasoit sent Squanto and one of his own men, Samoset, to check out the settlement.
933911046825246720 2017-11-23 04:11:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Half of the settlers died that first winter. In the spring, Massasoit hoped to broker some kind of deal with these English -- who, with women and children among them, were different than all the traders. Better or worse, he could not know.
933910512022069248 2017-11-23 04:09:51 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Their sachem, Epanow, had been kidnapped and held for ransom previously. In the ensuing battle, Dermer was mortally wounded, and Tisquantum was taken captive by the Capawack.  They then turned him over to Massasoit, sachem of the Wampanoag.   That fall, the Pilgrims arrived.
933910072626778113 2017-11-23 04:08:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Eventually, even Tisquantum was looked on with some suspicion by other tribes in the area because he was helping the hated English. Things came to a head when Dermer's ship was attacked by the Capawack people on what's now Martha's Vineyard.
933909773501718528 2017-11-23 04:06:55 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> So Squanto stayed with Dermer, trying to act as go-between with various rather-hostile-to-the-English tribes, since English "kidnappings" of Native People was still going on. And the English didn't have the finesse of the French traders, even if they weren't kidnapping people.
933908227758071808 2017-11-23 04:00:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Can you imagine? Captured from your home and family, taken to a strange land, and when you finally manage to return, everyone you ever knew is dead.
933907827294330880 2017-11-23 03:59:11 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Squanto convinced Dermer to bring him to New England, for Dermer would find riches there, he swore, and Tisquantum would help him. Alas for Tisquantum, the Patuxet had been entirely wiped out by illness, likely brought by the English, while he had been gone.
933907317514321920 2017-11-23 03:57:10 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> There, he sold them as slaves. How Squanto got from Spain to England isn't known, but once he was in London, some 5 years later, he lived with a merchant and shipbuilder, who eventually sent him, indentured, to Newfoundland and into the path of John Dermer, a ship's captain.
933906869852049408 2017-11-23 03:55:23 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> One such Englishman, named Thomas Hunt, lured 20 Patuxet men (Tisquantum among them) aboard his ship with the promise of trade, and then "secured" them and sailed away. He picked up 7 more men, from the Nauset tribe on Cape Cod, before heading for Malaga, Spain.
933906590486249472 2017-11-23 03:54:16 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> The Pilgrims were not the first English to appear on the shores of Massachusetts. Not by a long shot. Traders had been coming through for years, after furs, fish, sassafras, and gold. And, unfortunately for Squanto, Natives, to sell or show off back home.
933905793929195520 2017-11-23 03:51:07 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Tisquantum was Patuxet, the tribe which made its home right where the Pilgrims would eventually settle. The Patuxet are a smaller tribe under the larger Wampanoag (also sometimes called Pokanoket) Nation.
933905325760978951 2017-11-23 03:49:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Most Americans know Tisquantum only as the man who greeted the Pilgrims in the spring of 1621 and taught them how to plant corn, and who somehow miraculously knew English. But he was a very complicated man, who's idea to help the English may not have been his own.
933904830313017344 2017-11-23 03:47:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> the Tragic Case of Tisquantum, more colloquially known as Squanto. All the information I learned came from primary sources where available, from the Plantation archives and from research done by Nanepashemet, who was my teacher.
933904577534894081 2017-11-23 03:46:17 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> During the summer between high school and college I worked at Plimoth Plantation, at the Wampanoag Indian Program. Now this was 30 years ago, and the program there has changed, to be sure, but one element I was instructed on to the point I could give 30 minute lectures on was...

931422522595098624 2017-11-16 07:23:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Huh.

I take a thyroid drug, too, and it's one of the cheapest ones in the world, but my insurance has it on second tier. Wtf? Hubs MS meds are free, thankfully, bc just one of them is $8K a month. My copays run a couple hundred a month, if I'm frugal w/dosing.

931410293363654656 2017-11-16 06:34:53 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @MEPFuller @Kizzysmom @cmlouwho1 The Senate version of the bill, because of the paygo law, requires that the $1.5Trillion deficit over ten years come out of certain accounts, yearly, immediately, via sequester. Medicare is capped at a 4% cut, so it'll "only" be cut by $25B per year. That's prob what they meant.
931404989834051584 2017-11-16 06:13:48 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> This article was written several weeks ago, before Roy Moore or Louis CK, and obviously before Al Franken, but it certainly puts paid to the idea that all those women just "disappeared" after the 2016 election and didn't really care about getting justice.http://wapo.st/2yKfdy2?tid=ss_tw-amp

931392853804138496 2017-11-16 05:25:35 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Another reminder, from the best of the House of Reps, @repjohnlewis that if you don't have health insurance, NOW is the time to get it.

931389379028729856 2017-11-16 05:11:46 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @GOP @The_UnSilent_ And also, a number of the tax changes won't be felt by people until they file their 2018 taxes.... in early 2019. After the election. Now sure, the Medicare cuts happen immediately, and people will be losing their insurance, but it might not hurt before the election. 2/2
931388438997221376 2017-11-16 05:08:02 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @GOP @The_UnSilent_ Because passing this tax bill is the only way they could get their wealthy donors (like the Kochs) to pony up for the 2018 elections. They're even on the record saying so. Once it passes, they'll have lots of dark money to out spend any Dem challengers. /1

Mulvaney is Trump's budget guy, and is very anti-CFPB. And now he's in charge of it.
931377353275596801 2017-11-16 04:23:59 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @JDiamond1 @ColleenSPayne Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You know, the thing Warren helped set up after the banks fragged the economy in 2008 and the Repubs have been trying to destroy ever since. This may be its death knell.

My mom wants to get a cat for company -- my dad died about 2 years ago now -- but she'll probably go for a rescue since she doesn't have allergies to worry about.
931370812719882240 2017-11-16 03:58:00 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @marsha_sherouse Sorry about Chopin! Allergy shots worked for me for a while, but I moved, and my new insurance wouldn't cover them, so I never went back. All my boyz are rescues; Logan's the newest-- we were supposed to just foster him, but I fell in love, and we adopted him instead. Oh well. 
931365698416214016 2017-11-16 03:37:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @marsha_sherouse Oh, yeah, bettas! One of my friends has one of those. They really are gorgeous. Fairly easy to take care of, too, aren't they?  Is the Balinese the cat breed you were thinking of that's hypoallergenic? I've heard that's the best one.

Here's an article on them and Trump, from earlier today:http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/360598-meet-the-powerful-group-behind-trumps-judicial-nominations
931350262865838080 2017-11-16 02:36:20 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @krassenstein @MargaretMac4 Yep. Exactly. He's outsourced *all* his judicial nominees to them. And they're getting them done as fast as they can. McConnell blocked so many of Obama's nominees from ever coming to a vote that there are currently lots of openings for ultra-conservatives on the bench.

He even bragged about there would *never ever* be a problem with *this* pipeline, that it was a whole lot of hot air, wouldn't listen to even the army corps of engineers. Gah.

931342052779966464 2017-11-16 02:03:43 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @krassenstein @MargaretMac4 Trump has outsourced his judicial nominations to The Federalist Society. Look them up. It will frighten you.
931341421847523328 2017-11-16 02:01:13 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @krassenstein @katiemcgrath The full Senate will have a vote to approve him, I believe. Unless he withdraws his name (or is forced to.) So call your Senators. Especially if they're Republicans, since the Dems are lockstep against this guy.
931340616893546496 2017-11-16 01:58:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @krassenstein @ZootsAlures Many of the votes (and specifically this one) have been on strict party lines. Only Republicans thought it was a good idea to pass this idiot out of Committee. The Dems all voted NO.  Unfortunately, the Rs have the majority in this (and every) Committee in the Legislature now.
931339025029349376 2017-11-16 01:51:41 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @joncoopertweets @krassenstein @RobinMehler1 The judicial committee is the one that's been passing all these nominees through, as fast as they can. The Dems rant as much as they can, but there's no way to block these nominees getting out of Committee. I don't know if they can filibuster once it comes to a full senate vote.
931337703282454528 2017-11-16 01:46:26 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @krassenstein @SimpleTruths5 Oh, they're vetted all right, by the Federalist Society, which looks for young, ultra-conservative lawyers amongst their membership to put into positions of power. And since DT has outsourced his nominating process to them, they're having a field day.

And settlement patterns, yes! The northeast is *still* heavily Catholic -- Irish, Portuguese & Italian mainly. Episcopals in the south, huh.

It was just understood there wouldn't be enough students there to make it worthwhile.

I'm from Plymouth, MA (originally) and so most of what I know about religion in America comes from the Pilgrims, Puritans, and then later, the Irish Catholics (Dad's Family.) I'd love to know more.
928825350863208448 2017-11-09 03:23:15 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AaronBlake @HumanitarianGal @HowardA_Esq @Nofearnofavors4 @AuntieTeaches I hardly talk religion anymore either. Though my parents were both Catholic (Dad a priest, Mom a nun... yeah, I know) in later years they attended an Evangelical Lutheran Church. My hubs is agnostic like me, though he did a stint in JWs (with an ex.) But religion is fascinating.

I went to Catholic HS, and we had one year on world religions, but it was mostly on the big ones-- Hindu, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism. My Dad was well versed on early church stuff (cld read Aramaic, frex.) but I never asked him enough about it.

928822145999822849 2017-11-09 03:10:30 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AaronBlake @HumanitarianGal @HowardA_Esq @Nofearnofavors4 @AuntieTeaches Yeah, it's all very convoluted and much of the specific wording isn't in the Bible proper. And then you have Catholic doctrine versus Protestant. Caths are often deemed to hold Mary up as nearly godlike, which Prots view as idolatrous. This is one reason why.
928820499827662849 2017-11-09 03:03:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Liberal_Cynic True 'nuff. Sucks anyway you slice it. But parents will buy these things like hotcakes and woe betide the one who doesn't and their kid gets killed. The blame will shift from the shooter to the parent, see if it won't.
928819918388191232 2017-11-09 03:01:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ava @Hendja Yeah. I was surprised to see that, actually. Was good to see Atlanta in there, tho. And a couple places in Maryland.

My Dad was a Catholic priest (b4 he met my mom) so I heard him correct folks on this all the time.
928818658054307840 2017-11-09 02:56:39 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @Liberal_Cynic Yeah, I'm interested to see that, too. So, when there's a lockdown drill (or ghu forbid, the real thing) the kids are all s'psd to go grab their backpacks before hiding under their desks? Sounds legit.
928818122772979712 2017-11-09 02:54:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ava @Hendja According to the thing I read, they tried to get it, too, but didn't "get the carve out" which means didn't have the funding, I think?

928809930043170816 2017-11-09 02:21:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @AaronBlake @joycefromli Ex-Catholic here. Mary actually *was* the Immaculate Conception, meaning she herself was conceived without sin by her mother (became doctrine in the 1800s.) Yes, she was also a virgin when giving birth. Joseph had nada to do w/it.

917240755214680064 2017-10-08 04:10:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenBobCorker @CHawksRun I imagine. Well, in a lot of ways Ta-nahisi Coates is right. Trump is the rights backlash to our 1st black President. Horrifying.
917240079155830784 2017-10-08 04:07:31 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenBobCorker @CHawksRun What the title? Is it yours?

917233916263591941 2017-10-08 03:43:01 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenBobCorker @CHawksRun Pretty much. Newt shut down the govt over taxes, and refused to negotiate w/Dems. Absolutely refused. Started the REALLY bad partisan crap.
917232344833998851 2017-10-08 03:36:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @SenBobCorker @CHawksRun Yep. It didnt used to be so bad. They used to actually *gasp* work together to (mostly) move things forward. I know! I blame Newt Gingrich.

914363967723597824 2017-09-30 05:38:52 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> Un-effing-believable. Really, it isn't, though. DT is *obsessed* w/how much & what kind of press he gets. Malignant narcissist.https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk/status/913942669596008449

914339173401739264 2017-09-30 04:00:21 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh Especially since DT is still denying anything happened, and the "Voting Commission" is focusing on the wrong effing problem.
914338706433089538 2017-09-30 03:58:29 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh And hopefully no Russians will hack the voting machines, voters' data or do targeted ads again. I don't know if we'll be prepared.
914337818914078720 2017-09-30 03:54:58 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh Here's hoping. The problem is the Republican congress. If they think they can be reelected without impeaching DJT, they won't do it.
914336970616143873 2017-09-30 03:51:36 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh Absolutely. Having Pruitt head the EPA and the Exxon CEO at State doesn't help. Humans' days are numbered on this planet if we don't fix it.

914332847514705920 2017-09-30 03:35:12 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh I like it! I just skimmed it now, will read more in depth later.

914330788480479232 2017-09-30 03:27:02 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh So he can soak us for every penny he can while sowing dissent as a distraction. He's a malignant narcissist.
914330453145829378 2017-09-30 03:25:42 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh They've done so already, wrt disappearing documents that don't support their conclusions. There's gotta be an independent investigation.
914329973330026496 2017-09-30 03:23:47 UTC <RachelMcGonagi1> @ddale8 @SydNeCoh Agreed. I'd like to wait for Mueller to do it nice and legal, but people *are dying*
