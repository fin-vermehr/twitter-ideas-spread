971802725527760896 2018-03-08 17:39:59 UTC <ConnorEddles> The writing fellowship is alive and well, thankfully. If you're considering putting yourself out there, I'd absolutely recommend it! Thanks to some wonderful writer's who've already been published, I know I can belong somewhere. Thank you.
971799851343269888 2018-03-08 17:28:34 UTC <ConnorEddles> @MrColemanGrey I certainly shall! You don't happen to have a jackhammer going spare, by any chance?
971515315816411141 2018-03-07 22:37:55 UTC <ConnorEddles> @WarrKlaw Man, I'm writing New Weird stuff, going full Berserk doesn't fit my agenda. Now go scribble more stuff for my work, art-slave!
971506958153998336 2018-03-07 22:04:43 UTC <ConnorEddles> @HNTurtledove Carrot is the only character who COULD survive dwarf hell sober, and probably walk out with nothing more than some small scorchmarks and a shortage of citations in the way of problems.
971503989224345602 2018-03-07 21:52:55 UTC <ConnorEddles> @HNTurtledove A dwarven one, judging by the beard. And everyone knows that staying sober in dwarf hell is a terrible idea.
971502891595857925 2018-03-07 21:48:33 UTC <ConnorEddles> All it takes is one good piece of feedback, and writing turns from chipping stone to pouring water. And boy, do I need that water...
971147973018181632 2018-03-06 22:18:14 UTC <ConnorEddles> @BucksNewUni @garethlpowell Thank you so much for your time, it was a wonderful insight into the industry!
971090785025363968 2018-03-06 18:30:59 UTC <ConnorEddles> Huge thank you to @garethlpowell for the brilliant workshop, you definitely inspired us today!
970781719971364865 2018-03-05 22:02:52 UTC <ConnorEddles> @Mostlykarl No problem!
970037125101096961 2018-03-03 20:44:07 UTC <ConnorEddles> Finally got myself into a writing frame of mind, am now yelling in a deep voice about chronal sorcery. SOMEBODY STOP ME.
969919458809663488 2018-03-03 12:56:33 UTC <ConnorEddles> @Judd_of_Kryos @SeanNittner @glummdead Skellige was amazing, I would kill for an Earthsea game like Stardew valley where you just sailed around and lived, that would be amazing
969897800203952128 2018-03-03 11:30:30 UTC <ConnorEddles> @Judd_of_Kryos @SeanNittner @glummdead Listen, I don't care who I have to shamelessly bribe with biscuits, I need an Earthsea adaption in my life.
969893369613824000 2018-03-03 11:12:53 UTC <ConnorEddles> @Judd_of_Kryos @SeanNittner Wait, did someone submit an Earthsea adaption?  I'm not saying that I should have it, but I WANT IT SOOOOOOOOO BAD. SO BAD. Just saying.
969365062862475264 2018-03-01 00:13:35 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell My admiration grows stronger every day, bravo
969364122633728001 2018-03-01 00:09:51 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell So what you're saying is, you're a wizard and your familiar has familiars of her own?
969363713684922368 2018-03-01 00:08:13 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Can I just take a moment to appreciate the fluffy fellow on the left who looks absolutely done with being photographed? 10/10
969361716726370304 2018-03-01 00:00:17 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I'm not saying I'd like to see the cats. But I'd REALLY like to see the cats. Here's a picture of mine in exchange!pic.twitter.com/5MgiveobnA
968210449006235653 2018-02-26 19:45:34 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell We're definitely glad to have you! And don't worry, we won't bite. For the first three hours, anyway...
968119534946308096 2018-02-26 13:44:18 UTC <ConnorEddles> Right, I've snagged two writing jobs and arranged a guest lecturer for my degree next week. Any more for any more? #kickingassandtakingnames
965718085016735749 2018-02-19 22:41:48 UTC <ConnorEddles> @BrianTMcClellan Probably a tad too late, but I've played more RPGs than you can shake a 10 foot pole at; hope I can help!
965329853833732098 2018-02-18 20:59:06 UTC <ConnorEddles> I HAVE QUITE POSSIBLY DONE A THING #OnPatreonhttps://patreon.com/user?u=9844286&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=creatorshare2
963879825458024453 2018-02-14 20:57:13 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell So I'm looking at a cynical hero, post-adventure, who thinks he's seen it all. What kind of arc would give him the most depth?
963112557937680386 2018-02-12 18:08:22 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I certainly will, thank you!
963109274384830465 2018-02-12 17:55:19 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I'm in a creative writing degree at Bucks New University, it'd be amazing to have you as a guest lecturer!
962827261530525696 2018-02-11 23:14:42 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Thank you, I appreciate it!
962826473890557954 2018-02-11 23:11:34 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell That's great to hear! Story-wise, it's about the protag trying to solve the murders of his former fellowship while tensions between humans and the other species heat up.
962825066429014016 2018-02-11 23:05:58 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oyMhm-vxvdNhqMMW-I8batHO0vwGvvOFm4Y52Pd5d4c/edit?usp=drivesdk    Awesome, thank you so much! I hope it all makes sense!
962824014531104768 2018-02-11 23:01:48 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell It is! It's going to be a novel, the first in a series. Hopefully.
962823562032832512 2018-02-11 23:00:00 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I'm doing my planning for a dissertation piece next year, and I'm really worried it doesn't work. I've got the PowerPoint just about sorted, I just need someone to look at it and see if it works.
962823307065266176 2018-02-11 22:58:59 UTC <ConnorEddles> If you have a sister, tell her how much she means to you. Some of us will never be able to.
962435835885965312 2018-02-10 21:19:19 UTC <ConnorEddles> @SamSykesSwears I WILL DO BOTH AND NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST NOR GOD SHALL STOP ME
962333584215433216 2018-02-10 14:33:00 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Curses, I've been sussed out...
959892376927002624 2018-02-03 20:52:31 UTC <ConnorEddles> Those people holding the signs? They were parents. Grandparents. They might have spread their vitriol to their children. Some of them are probably still alive. We haven't seen the end of this hatred yet, not by a longshot.https://twitter.com/JemiSHaaaZzz/status/959111352286629888

954800425005408257 2018-01-20 19:38:55 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Camenbert, because my fake french accent always annoys the crap outta @The_Georgiacorn
953744978370580481 2018-01-17 21:44:57 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Glad to know I'm not alone. I want to achieve this so much, I have no choice but to keep going
953735102319812613 2018-01-17 21:05:42 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell How do you build confidence as a creator of any medium? I veer between feeling great about my work and dreading ever opening my WIP again. Is it possible to feel consistently positive?
953734392039473154 2018-01-17 21:02:53 UTC <ConnorEddles> @Epidiah An absolute lack of dignity means I don't remember. Hurrah.
939962520391045122 2017-12-10 20:58:23 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell And to you, good sir!
939962044350193665 2017-12-10 20:56:29 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I'm more than prepared for that, hopefully script editing can help get me going. And I love doing it, so it's worth the struggle.
939960816987787264 2017-12-10 20:51:37 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Thank you so much for the advice, I'll look into them both!  You've definitely helped with my fears for the future, thank you again.
939958566131322881 2017-12-10 20:42:40 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Perfect, I'll look at upcoming conventions. Any in particular that I should definitely attend?
939951206977425409 2017-12-10 20:13:25 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell Thank you, it's good to hear that my dreams are achievable. Would you suggest going to writer's conventions at any point while in still studying?
939949339761364993 2017-12-10 20:06:00 UTC <ConnorEddles> @garethlpowell I'm studying writing at uni, and I'm terrified I won't have any job opportunities when I graduate. I really want to inspire people with my writing, do I have a good chance of getting into the industry?

936243365628272641 2017-11-30 14:39:47 UTC <ConnorEddles> As authors, we aren't just wordsmiths or entertainers. We sell dreams within the marketplace of the human psyche, tap into the infinite kaleidoscope of sapient ambition. We make people believe, and that's the best kind of job I could ever ask for.
935864311808970752 2017-11-29 13:33:34 UTC <ConnorEddles> Things I am really, really fed up with:  Bingo adverts Credit and loan adverts Adverts of any sort, actually People being shitty to each other A serious lack of strong cheese in my life right now

911189441758289920 2017-09-22 11:24:26 UTC <ConnorEddles> So if I was, say, writing about skeletons, what would you expect to see? Any tropes I can deconstruct?

904422845564035072 2017-09-03 19:16:24 UTC <ConnorEddles> @writer_anthony looks like Google flubbed one of your review scores; the site itself says 9/10!pic.twitter.com/XSdDPkLYgV
901010950530236416 2017-08-25 09:18:45 UTC <ConnorEddles> PSA: love what you write. If it's the best you can do, then it's the best you can do. Worrying about anything beyond that just wastes energy
886539245455802368 2017-07-16 10:53:21 UTC <ConnorEddles> @The_Georgiacorn I'm still skeptical... Maybe I need some pizza to change my mind...
886524968120578048 2017-07-16 09:56:37 UTC <ConnorEddles> @The_Georgiacorn Is it still self sufficiency when you can't move afterwards?
