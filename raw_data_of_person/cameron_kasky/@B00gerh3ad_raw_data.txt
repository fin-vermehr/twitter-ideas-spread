941398344353509376 2017-12-14 20:03:50 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Which can only be a good thing. I do not need any of this, and really, neither do most of us. It's a pleasant distraction, not a real thing. In closing, I have better things to do. Have your stupid internet.
941398342139031552 2017-12-14 20:03:49 UTC <B00gerh3ad> There is really no down side. The best thing that happened to me in 2013 was getting banned from that fucktard parade known as "Facebook". So it stands to reason that the less I can afford to do online, the more I will have to do IRL.

938841506990907392 2017-12-07 18:43:52 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @detectivelily Much better, as the means of production won't be held by an army. Anarchism isn't the absence of law, it's the presence of mind required to do what needs to be done in the moment and not be beholden to economics or rulers.

895730116482945025 2017-08-10 19:34:36 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Blueyedstar4 To help, we must leave the power structure behind and sacrifice our comfort for the greater good. Otherwise it's all just a power struggle.
895729496241840128 2017-08-10 19:32:08 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Blueyedstar4 No, that would be sacrifice, the opposite of power.
895729249646034944 2017-08-10 19:31:09 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Blueyedstar4 Power is the only pure, uncut evil there is. It is the very definition of evil. It's the heart of all evil in the universe.  In existence.
895728923354451968 2017-08-10 19:29:51 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Blueyedstar4 Yeah, it is. It is the true source of greed and all suffering. Our single minded obsession with it shows our ignorance and true intent.
895728254740344832 2017-08-10 19:27:12 UTC <B00gerh3ad> I like presidents whose campaign manager's home isn't raided by the FBI.
895727834605342721 2017-08-10 19:25:32 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Prosecutors don't obtain search warrants for the homes of cooperative subjects. They get them when they think they're lying.

895722701716832256 2017-08-10 19:05:08 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @erikaheidewald The Korean war is the longest us war, as it still hasn't ended.
895441992917725185 2017-08-09 00:29:42 UTC <B00gerh3ad> I mean, coin was literally invented to put a price on human lives, to make slave trading more efficient. Economics were invented by slavers.

895437645857251328 2017-08-09 00:12:25 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @KINGAALYCE It isn't. Just look at the history of Libya and the Canaanites. They were never "wiped out" as the bible claims. They're modern day Lybians.

895435821855121408 2017-08-09 00:05:10 UTC <B00gerh3ad> World peace isn't possible while we organize society around economics. Economies are also a tool of the state to manipulate populations. https://twitter.com/kingaalyce/status/895434894591107073
895435598344765440 2017-08-09 00:04:17 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @KINGAALYCE Religion is the manipulation of a demographic based on their shared fear of dying and of the unknown.  It has NOTHING to do with morals.

862136819739049984 2017-05-09 02:46:50 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @YerbaDog Wrong again, hardly surprising. Politics & diplomacy are simply warfare by other means, like sanctions. There are also cold and civil wars.
862129000537235456 2017-05-09 02:15:45 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @YerbaDog Even Vietnam lasted longer than Afganistan. You. Are. Wrong.
862128475200569345 2017-05-09 02:13:40 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @YerbaDog the fighting ended then, but a treaty wont happen until NK ends their nuke progeam, which it never did. As the world knows.
862125072928067584 2017-05-09 02:00:09 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Its an armistice, a goddamn cease fire. We are still at war, just in a different arena. https://twitter.com/YerbaDog/status/862054543785213952
862124281324462080 2017-05-09 01:57:00 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog The fighting.

862051555683385344 2017-05-09 21:08:01 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog This is demonstrably untrue.
862033255960268801 2017-05-09 19:55:18 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog The US rejected the treaty because NK wouldn't stop making nukes. So we are still at war with North Korea, but the armistice holds.
862033019057586177 2017-05-09 19:54:22 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog If the war is over, why did North Korea try and end the war in 2016?  Sorry, but you're wrong. It hurts, I know...
862031763480104960 2017-05-09 19:49:22 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog Yes they are. In 2016, North Korea approached the United States about conducting formal peace talks to formally end the war. It is still on.
862031061986844672 2017-05-09 19:46:35 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog But we are. Our most potent weapon is economics, that's why we sanction.
862030959457193984 2017-05-09 19:46:11 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog Nope. The "fighting" lasted that long. We still sanction NK, side with SK, and we are still "enemies". The war didn't end, just the fight.
862030697703251968 2017-05-09 19:45:08 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog No peace treaty has been signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war.
862030318840274945 2017-05-09 19:43:38 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Salon @YerbaDog The Korean war never ended. The armistice never ended it, it's a truce. The war is still on. That's why the SK/DPRK DMZ. Duh.

809143028069769216 2016-12-14 21:08:25 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @HecateDemetersd @bluelyon Roosevelt was nominated for a third presidential term. Nominated. The tradition that later became law was broken.

808826796095377408 2016-12-13 00:11:50 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @HecateDemetersd @bluelyon foreign electoral interference = national emergency, gives Obama clemency to take 3rd term & hold real election.

808825805161664512 2016-12-13 00:07:53 UTC <B00gerh3ad> I think foreign electoral interference = national emergency, granting Obama the clemency needed to take a 3rd term and hold a real election.

776148437452460032 2016-09-14 19:59:42 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @sandyhook @NewGirl4444 as far as irrelevance, if anyone cared about saving lives, cars would be tightly regulated. They only care about $.
776147886790746112 2016-09-14 19:57:30 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @sandyhook @NewGirl4444 I think they ought to be banned, both cars and guns. No need for namecalling, I respected you, please reciprocate.

763530509532008449 2016-08-10 00:20:33 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @attackerman @RobinCook Don't get me wrong, I loathe the boomers for their fuckups. But a generation of kids addicted to escapism is worse.

763529739847868416 2016-08-10 00:17:30 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @attackerman Gen X hates 'em too. The only thing we've ever had in common with the boomers is a mutual hatred of the sissy/idiot generation.

745720142986940416 2016-06-22 20:48:31 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @eileen_gunn Because people do not want to hear that economics drive humans insane. They want a boogeyman to blame their fear on.

743707983113138176 2016-06-17 07:32:55 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @GreatDismal @kradlum Or you could buy a desktop CNC mill and make a hundred.

743693766456860672 2016-06-16 06:36:25 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @nicolesherburne Especially with desktop CNC "printers" coming along soon.
743693051583832064 2016-06-16 06:33:35 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @nicolesherburne With a CNC machine, which costs around 20k, all you need is the "mastercam" software. Amazing a government cant swing it.

743685548829663232 2016-06-16 06:03:46 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @nicolesherburne A milling machine, a CNC routing machine, a hacksaw and a drill. Any of these can produce reliable, accurate firearms.
743680738277523460 2016-06-16 05:44:39 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @nicolesherburne anyone can build a gun with or without a printer. You simply cannot put the genie back into the bottle.
743581531344502785 2016-06-16 23:10:26 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam Yes it is. A semiauto is NOT an assault weapon.
743581389539287040 2016-06-16 23:09:52 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Yes, I read the article. The author is full of shit.
743581109124923392 2016-06-16 23:08:46 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam AND the m16 fires a different caliber round. I think the author just made this shit article up.
743580937670123520 2016-06-16 23:08:05 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam Thirdly, the M-16 and the AR-15 are very, very different. M16 has a full-auto option, the ar does not.
743580726960918528 2016-06-16 23:07:15 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam He invented a weapon that fell fully into the "legal for civilians" category.
743580602423619584 2016-06-16 23:06:45 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam Secondly, inventing a semi-auto weapon in the USA and saying it isn't for civilians is disingenuous.
743580390770638848 2016-06-16 23:05:54 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @ERN_Malleyscrub @CharlesPulliam Yes, and there are a number of fallacies. Firstly, as I pointed out, an AR wasn't used in Orlando.

743578946147491842 2016-06-16 23:00:10 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @CharlesPulliam @ERN_Malleyscrub An AR-15 WAS NOT USED in Orlando, it was a Sig Sauer MCX, neither of which are assault weapons.

743549531501957120 2016-06-16 21:03:17 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @LillyLyle Bernie should have made his push 40 years ago. If the GOP rigs this election like they did in 2000, we'll have another civil war.
743548653030146048 2016-06-16 20:59:48 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @LillyLyle It's disingenuous we're expected to differentiate candidates when they only represent 1% of a population. All from the same pool.
743547674566107137 2016-06-16 20:55:54 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @LillyLyle Inheritances are undemocratic, and destroy any premise of equality whatsoever. Walmart was an inheritance. Eff them.

743546945046614016 2016-06-16 20:53:00 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @LillyLyle Walmart employs the poor, subsidizes their poverty by cutting hours making them eligible for state assistance. Keeping them poor.

742783600702021637 2016-06-14 18:19:45 UTC <B00gerh3ad> We don't need gun control, we need ammo control.
742773496908910592 2016-06-14 17:39:36 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Marshdrifter Yet cars always kill more. Programs exist for guns, and are more stringent each year. More lives would be saved banning cars.
742773044272238592 2016-06-14 17:37:48 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb We have a fine public transport system, just a lazy population.
742772539345117184 2016-06-14 17:35:48 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb People would adapt, and be alive while doing so.
742772268992888833 2016-06-14 17:34:43 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb The fact is cars kill more, and make people obese to boot. Add the added health risks to the annual kill count, & the facts speak.
742771759963721728 2016-06-14 17:32:42 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb Beside the point, cars kill more EVERY DAY.
742771598625636352 2016-06-14 17:32:03 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb yet they will ALWAYS kill more, and are more deserving of being banned.
742771300200898561 2016-06-14 17:30:52 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb Yes. A 30-.06 w/a 5round mag is a deer/elk rifle, and is semi auto.
742770719877009409 2016-06-14 17:28:34 UTC <B00gerh3ad> @Fimb Not the point, cars still kill WAY more. I hunt, so yeah, they'll kill more than people.
742770571209891841 2016-06-14 17:27:58 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Really, if this "shocks" you, I'd like to see the cave you've been living in for the last few decades. The amenities must be amazing.
742770026931847169 2016-06-14 17:25:49 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Why is it when there's a gun fatality, people scream about gun bans, but when auto related fatalities DWARF those numbers people are mute?
742768434774085632 2016-06-14 17:19:29 UTC <B00gerh3ad> Cars always kill more than guns. We should ban them all.
