970063754346967041 2018-03-03 22:29:56 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @HuffPostPol @timjacobwise I think the Administrator who accepted her lame "not me" claim needs to go too. What kind of faith should other parents have in that person's judgement? None.
969988123080851456 2018-03-03 17:29:24 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @rezaaslan And the proponents of this child abuse  will rail about "creeping Sharia law".

969985730251337728 2018-03-03 17:19:54 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> But do let's worry about Sharia law coming to America right? Parents should be charged w/ child abuse for allowing this. And it's not children...it's GIRLS.https://twitter.com/rezaaslan/status/969980187335999488

968291362696085504 2018-02-26 01:07:05 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @DylanRatigan @TheBeatWithAri @Enjoneer01 That's a luxury a lot of us don't have, especially women and people of color for whom it took blood, Constitutional amendments, the VRA  to even have the right to vote. For many of us, throwing it away like that is an insult and a disgrace.

Women and minorities had to fight like hell for the franchise, but he just gets to ask for people's vote?https://twitter.com/DylanRatigan/status/966365287212834816
968260855853797376 2018-02-26 23:05:52 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @WalshFreedom But go ahead and pretend that there's not a logical reason why she will lose and why this isn't a vanity race to shore up her conservative victimhood points 2/2.
968260434221416449 2018-02-26 23:04:11 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @WalshFreedom Just for the record when she loses. She's running in a district that went 70+pts for Clinton in 2016. It's majority minority. 70% Latino. Based on her POLICIES, who thought this was a district  she could win?  1/

968243038697938944 2018-02-26 21:55:04 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @DylanRatigan @DmitrysPlane Hubris is right. It took two Amendments to the Constitution plus the Voting Rights Act to secure the vote for people who look like me. These guys were born on home base. Swing and a miss.
968241136903966720 2018-02-26 21:47:30 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @CaseyCagle Funny, isn't it always the conservatives who advocate for the free market and corporations being able to do what they wish? Except when the invisible hand of the free market gives you its middle finger I guess.

964903576735596544 2018-02-17 16:45:14 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @ClintSmithIII Because everything we do "must" somehow serve more than one purpose. You will never see someone expect this of the dominant society's entertainment.

964612268661948416 2018-02-16 21:27:41 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.

964606480207953920 2018-02-16 21:04:41 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @ZerlinaMaxwell Oh you know the answer to that. It would be worse than they treated Hillary for Bill's infidelity. Michelle would have been held to a standard immeasurable by science.
964570992449241089 2018-02-16 18:43:40 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The Russians exploited what they knew a certain segment of Americans would fall for.

964570359226712064 2018-02-16 18:41:09 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @AnandWrites A President who repeatedly denies there was any interference period. A President who sticks his fingers in his ears like a child.

964541393896026112 2018-02-16 16:46:03 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> For all of the additional education @IngrahamAngle received, clearly the fact that NBA players have First Amendment rights was missed. Funny how she didn't go after Coach Popovich or Coach Kerr. Hmmm wonder why?

962739337723916288 2018-02-11 17:25:19 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Exactly. It's like following a map and wondering how you got somewhere.https://twitter.com/DavidCornDC/status/962701914403233792
962738890007134208 2018-02-11 17:23:32 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @marcushjohnson @DuckyBlue1 I'll just be clinical about it. It's not in his natural or even political instincts. Why are so many so heavily invested in making him what he isn't. He is what he is, and what he will never be, is President.

962729409890275328 2018-02-11 16:45:52 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> They have agency. They have choice. If they've made their choice, then let them stand by it. I'm not here for infantilizing them anymore than I will do to Melania. They are grown women.
962729205871009794 2018-02-11 16:45:03 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> But let's be clear. If #GOP women won't get out after everything that has transpired with this rape culture presidency, they agree with and support it and are where they want to be. #AMJoy

962712614684868609 2018-02-11 15:39:08 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @JRubinBlogger is right. This Amy woman, and women like her who continue to excuse #Trump are the problem.
962452897865723904 2018-02-10 22:27:07 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @anthonykernAZ @kailawhite Thanks for the response. Nonetheless, he did still state that passage of HB222 and allowing inmates the hygiene products they need could result in frivolous actions which seems a distinction w/out much of a difference.
962447325825138688 2018-02-10 22:04:58 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @AthenaSalman @ktekakwitha Have been discussing HB222 with some folks. Question came up whether people can donate supplies or fundraise to put money on account for inmates @ Perryville? Is this an option?
962412472735952896 2018-02-10 19:46:28 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @CatKimbriel @LAGilman Predictable conservative male response: well just dont break any laws if youre going to have to menstruate while incarcerated

962397382167023616 2018-02-10 18:46:31 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @deray more than 1 job to still make less than a white person made at 1 job. Like white people didn't try to keep non-white people out of unions that secured better wages. Like black and brown women didn't raise their kids and then go home to raise their own. Miss me w/ all that.
962397135021813761 2018-02-10 18:45:32 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @deray Oh me too. They worked hard like black and brown people aren't out here doing the same. Like we didn't work hard for free. Like we didn't work hard in spite of de facto and de jure discrimination that made people have to work hard at 1/
962369907756158977 2018-02-10 16:57:20 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Does the FOXNews guy who wrote the bigoted column that they had to take down understand how the #Olympics work? As in you have to qualify by beating other people to make the team? #AMJoy

962349624206872576 2018-02-10 15:36:44 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> the link to the main page of archived AZLEG videos, which I'm not combing through to look for the one he claims exonerates him. Do you stand by your reporting that he said this?
962349357176508419 2018-02-10 15:35:40 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @arizonarepublic @kailawhite Perhaps you can help clarify. In tweeting your story and critizing @anthonykernAZ for comments about inmates clogging toilets w/ additional menstrual pads, he contends he did not say this but only provided 1/2https://twitter.com/PortiaMcGonagal/status/962343298068172800
962347637872578566 2018-02-10 15:28:51 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @anthonykernAZ There are over 20 videos on the archive page which I'm not going to hunt through. You should address the @arizonarepublic in re: your allegation that what they reported is not what you said. Unless like your male peers your too traumatized after hearing about periods.
962345694072733697 2018-02-10 15:21:07 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> That video of #Trump saying "we caught 'em" is among the most moronic and juvenile things he's said and there's a lot of that kind of source material.
962345313481535488 2018-02-10 15:19:36 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @anthonykernAZ If you want me to watch something, send a link.
962345065778589697 2018-02-10 15:18:37 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> And the #LDS church is complicit in #RobPorters behavior because big shock, they told the former wife to basically suck it up. But you know they revere women so much. #AMJoy

962342034496352256 2018-02-10 15:06:35 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> By #Trump 's logic, the prisons should be emptied because there are a lot of people in there who have not admitted their guilt. #AMJoy

962142247016849408 2018-02-09 01:52:42 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> So basically what #Trump is too dim to realize is he just said "Shit, the Dem memo has stuff in here that makes me look bad and guilty and I can't let people see it"  So I'll just confirm it by denying it.
962141496085331968 2018-02-09 01:49:43 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @realDonaldTrump @DailyTrix He is Stillwell from "A League of Their Own" only that kid grew into a decent adult.

962137526495408135 2018-02-09 01:33:56 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Translation: "Eeeew we had to here about icky stuff that comes from her you know where" .
962137296223879173 2018-02-09 01:33:01 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> A few more of the idiot menfolk Travis Grantham, Mark Finchem and Jay Lawrence in AZ had this to say:  "Im almost sorry I heard the bill," said Lawrence, the committee chairman. "I didnt expect to hear pads and tampons and the problems of periods."
962135389463957504 2018-02-09 01:25:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Because sure @anthonykernAZ if I had viscous blood, sometimes with clots, running down my leg and had the equivalent of a tissue vs a paper towel ( or a roll of them) to clean it up, I'd sure want to clog toilets with that gold.
962135074706571264 2018-02-09 01:24:12 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Here's one of the genius menfolk in the AZ Leg @anthonykernAZ : Rep. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, said giving prisoners more feminine-hygiene products would likely result in "a lot of frivolous actions" such as women flushing them to try to clog a toilet.
962134724234821632 2018-02-09 01:22:48 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Hey idiot menfolk who have allowed this. Pee on the floor ( you do anyway). Now wipe it up with 1 tissue. Repeat. Wipe it up with a paper towel. Better yes?
962134469300776960 2018-02-09 01:21:47 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The women in AZ ( only 1 place that houses women so they're all in the same location, look prison single delivery!) get TWELVE. Oh my bad ...12 "ultrathin pads" . That's the difference say between a tissue and a paper towel.
962134017565892608 2018-02-09 01:20:00 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The menfolk are supposed to be good at math right? So if an average period (you know how averages work menfolk right? some less, some more, you take the avg?) is 5 days and normal health guidelines followed = 20 pads. Regular ones.
962133126976688128 2018-02-09 01:16:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> If you have never had a period, then miss anyone who has with dumbass-splaining anything to do with menstruation. Just do not even start.

962075941970132992 2018-02-09 21:29:13 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Clearly the idiot prison officials ( no doubt men) do not understand how periods work. 12 pads? There were times when those didn't last 2 days.https://twitter.com/tessamuggeridge/status/961589243285000194

957635671065153536 2018-01-28 15:25:10 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> But @KatonDawson you are the ones who want to legislate everyone else's morality. You are hypocrites and enablers. And it is political you feckless twit. #AMJoy

957280123539021824 2018-01-27 15:52:21 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Seriously #MSNBC. All day coverage for a SOTU? Why? Remember when this was an unremarkable event that political nerds tuned into 5 min before it started?
957278151637282816 2018-01-27 15:44:31 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> All these cons worried about #Trump being perjury trapped...because they know he's a congenital liar. #AMJoy
957275541966536704 2018-01-27 15:34:09 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> "...all beauty products marketed for black people are placed in a locked glass case, while cosmetics targeting other ethnicities are freely available at the Walmart near her ..."https://www.rawstory.com/2018/01/california-woman-sues-walmart-segregated-black-products/

957270081481801729 2018-01-27 15:12:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> So what this GOP guy is saying on #AMJoy is the @RNC will get rid of #SteveWynn because his business is tanking, not because he's a sexual predator.
957269444790648832 2018-01-27 15:09:55 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Worth repeating: "Racism is a national security vulnerability."https://twitter.com/Sifill_LDF/status/957268117889126400

957267858655870977 2018-01-27 15:03:37 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Has anyone heard from @GOPChairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel yet in re: #SteveWynn ? Should we send a St. Bernard out to look for her? #AMJoy
957074122718167040 2018-01-26 02:13:47 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @nytopinion Just when I thought you couldn't publish anything more ridiculous

957072462134456320 2018-01-26 02:07:11 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Remarkable! Has anyone heard from @GOPChairwoman at ALL on this? Or is she waiting for Trump to tell her what to do like he did when she dropped Romney from her name?https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/957019515967197184

950777808137076736 2018-01-09 17:14:28 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> She inspired me as she took the misogyny, the endless bullshit inquiries, the relentless vilification that ppl like you, especially the Fox crowd, the Tumpers, the Berners, the male journos who have since been fired or
950777283408674816 2018-01-09 17:12:23 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> My respect for her (and inspiration by her) grew exponentially as she did what she'd always done and took the hits, focused on the greater good and stepped up to take the SoS role and execute it well.

950776506434822144 2018-01-09 17:09:18 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> She continued to inspire me as First Lady, defining her role in a way that was right for her, the way I was defining my career in a way that was right for me. She inspired me to excel and not apologize for being smart.
950776278096920581 2018-01-09 17:08:23 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> She inspired me to know that my choice was valid and that I could in fact do it while being a wife and a mother. That I didn't have to choose.
950776041022226432 2018-01-09 17:07:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> I started my career around the time I first learned of HRC. In her I saw someone who'd achieved what I was setting out to do. Be a woman in a competitive environment with a successful career.

950025750601654274 2018-01-07 15:26:04 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Unpopular opinion ( probably). #PhantomThread is the exact kind of movie that will be fawned over and I have no interest in seeing.
950023078922235904 2018-01-07 15:15:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> With #McConnell at the helm, there is nothing #Trump can do that will make him act.https://twitter.com/amjoyshow/status/950021515302629376
950021889329577984 2018-01-07 15:10:43 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The @GOP has made a Faustian bargain to ride or die w/ #Trump. They know he's nuts and don't care. Shame on McConnell and Ryan (if they were capable).
950021066155376640 2018-01-07 15:07:27 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> OK @JoyAnnReid wearing her Superhero red this AM. #AMJoy
950020859271397377 2018-01-07 15:06:38 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @YNB Same. Wish I still didn't know this particular one, but have known "him" my whole life too Sis.
950020458853818369 2018-01-07 15:05:02 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @JoyAnnReid @joyreid @cupcaking3 Ack! Thank you. I knew that and can't believe I missed that.

949690019744071680 2018-01-06 17:11:59 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> We are stuck in a fricking #Trump time warp. Bill Clinton hasn't been president for 18 years. Time Russert, may he RIP, is dead.
949689853112852480 2018-01-06 17:11:20 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Know who else ran for President one time and won ( twice),  went to better schools, and will always be smarter than you #Trump? Barack Obama, who lives rent free in your head. #callinghimselfagenius

949674296305115136 2018-01-06 16:09:30 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> I guess the reason #JenKerns supports #DOTUS is the same reason she keeps coming back for more beatings on #AMJoy. Pathological.
949673313520910337 2018-01-06 16:05:36 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @johnpavlovitz It's the Christian "Get Out Of Jail Free" card, holds no one accountable and why I'm an atheist.

949661389001379841 2018-01-06 15:18:13 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The American people have a right to know if the occupant of the Oval Office is mentally fit. We've been here before. Never again. #AMJoy

930429281561223168 2017-11-14 13:36:41 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Jim Jordan is an idiot. Equal treatment under the law doesn't mean you investigate one side automatically  just because you're investigating the other side based on actual evidence.
930428592701431808 2017-11-14 13:33:57 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> So GOP talking points as evidenced on #CNN this morning. "We know Bob Mueller is investigating (actual evidence) on TrumpRussia. So we have to investigate Clinton because we have to investigate both sides" WTF.

929819160976039936 2017-11-12 21:12:17 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @Mikel_Jollett Let's not forget Wahlberg, showing his privilege a couple years ago lobbying for a pardon from the State of MA for crimes he committed.

929759470606880769 2017-11-12 17:15:06 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> You might be a mockable hypocrite who should be dragged endlessly if you demanded #HillaryClinton denounce Harvey Weinstein STAT and are "if'ng" yourself to death about #RoyMooreChildMolester . "If" you.

929754794377428992 2017-11-12 16:56:31 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @Shareblue @RVAwonk Can she see her reflection in the mirror? I don't think the undead can.
929754522368409600 2017-11-12 16:55:26 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> I've watched three interviews w/ #DonnaBrazile and all I have heard in any of them is "I" , "me", "my". #AMJoy
929751958641971200 2017-11-12 16:45:15 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @Mikel_Jollett There is  no Republican decency. There may once have been but it's been long gone and there are no signs of it coming back.
929751622175014912 2017-11-12 16:43:55 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> So let's take a page out of #Scandal 's Olivia Pope and Associates ( before she went all power crazy in the WH). "What do you want Donna". Does she want to run Bernie's (gag) campaign in 2020? Biden's? What do you want? #AMJoy

929750045016039425 2017-11-12 16:37:39 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Donna still ain't invited to the cookout. #AMJoy
929747050509373441 2017-11-12 16:25:45 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> The responses to the women who are on the record about #RoyMooreChildMolester are exactly why they didn't come forward sooner. We are conditioned to suck it up or be maligned. #AMJoy

929742537295773696 2017-11-12 16:07:49 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> @Rschooley No it makes more sense to destroy something they already spent money on vs just giving it away so someone can get use from it. Their boycotts are so perplexing.

914146455199166465 2017-09-30 15:14:33 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> This attitude is rooted in the belief that we are not equal citizens. We are "lucky" to be Americans vs white entitlement.

905903996811976704 2017-09-07 21:21:58 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> They just didn't used to be Catholic themselves while doing it, or claim to be. The prior and Protestant Bannons didn't want the Irish,
905903744558129153 2017-09-07 21:20:58 UTC <PortiaMcGonagal> Bannon disregards centuries of anti-Catholicism in the US. I'm sure he knows but it's not useful to him. Nativists have always hated Papistshttps://twitter.com/RWPUSA/status/905899612053102592
