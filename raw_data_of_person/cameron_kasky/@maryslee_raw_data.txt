971057364483784705 2018-03-06 16:18:11 UTC <maryslee> @ianbremmer I just spent 17 days traveling through 5 Colombian cities and felt very safe the entire trip.
968247143700955136 2018-02-26 22:11:22 UTC <maryslee> @Chewy disappointed. I am cancelling all my auto-ship future orders as your only option is FedEx. Let us know when you fix your business practices. Dont take too long though!
966916470641848320 2018-02-22 06:03:45 UTC <maryslee> @WellsFargoNews This is not nearly enough. Nice try though. Now go back to the drawing board.
966784914518507521 2018-02-22 21:21:00 UTC <maryslee> @NRA @TopRopeTravis @Hertz see step by step instructions from @FNBOmaha on what to do.
966783601642635264 2018-02-22 21:15:47 UTC <maryslee> @Hertz @brittontaylor @hertz. Say it isnt so. I always use hertz, but not anymore.
966001180647149568 2018-02-20 17:26:43 UTC <maryslee> @MittRomney This is exactly why you didnt win the presidency. You cant be trusted.
960511446256939008 2018-02-05 13:52:28 UTC <maryslee> @realDonaldTrump Hes closing in on you!
958116405139812352 2018-01-29 23:15:26 UTC <maryslee> @TSA I wouldnt call it easy. I made an appt and Im waiting in an over-filled office with no idea when Ill be seen. People are setting up tents, pulling out the grills, looks like itll be a long wait.
956259621139759104 2018-01-24 20:17:14 UTC <maryslee> @nytopinion @viet_t_nguyen @NYTimesPR Good move, but you still need to do more to earn back my subscription.
943899131633852416 2017-12-21 17:41:04 UTC <maryslee> @funder Only for his impeachment
939907989145772032 2017-12-10 17:21:41 UTC <maryslee> @AmericanAir @MollyJongFast Im spending my day off in PHX thanks to #americanair  :(
939907211471478784 2017-12-10 17:18:36 UTC <maryslee> @AmericanAir Ive called and Ill be writing a letter. I can list at least 5 things you couldve done to ensure I made my connection. Poor management. Your employees have an  I dont care attitude.
939898368020561920 2017-12-10 16:43:28 UTC <maryslee> @AmericanAir beyond annoyed at you today. Im taking my weekly flights to #UnitedAirlines

936598061249208321 2017-12-01 14:09:13 UTC <maryslee> @DavidNir and that is why I canceled my subscription. Not the story itself, but NYT's failure to understand its implications
935268468219244544 2017-11-27 22:05:53 UTC <maryslee> @nytimes must be a lot of people canceling. Been on hold for 15 mins. Tip: making it difficult to cancel ensures subscribers wont come back.
