I don't know exactly when I developed this intolerance--not for sex on tv/movies in general--but when it really doesn't add anything to the story.

971402948164096000 2018-03-07 15:11:25 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend You are correct!  I'm not you!  No, I can not predict how your relationship will be.  I did not intend to suggest that.  I started this by pointing out how fortunate you are--not even saying it was blind luck, you tried to get there.  I get it--wasn't disputing that!
971401812057247745 2018-03-07 15:06:54 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Sounds like bullshit to me, too.
971401675893366785 2018-03-07 15:06:21 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Congratulations!  That's damned awesome. 
971401533848997889 2018-03-07 15:05:48 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend I wasn't offering one.  I thought we were discussing a topic we both enjoy exploring.
971401074467856385 2018-03-07 15:03:58 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend No, I don't doubt it.  I don't think you're being dishonest.  I believe you are speaking from your own experience and being truthful.
971400219396067328 2018-03-07 15:00:34 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Again, you are fortunate.  And we agree it shouldn't be "hard".  Are you saying that you don't put any thought into giving to your partner?  No effort?  (trying to find a better word than "hard" because I think we agree.  Effort?  Thought?  Work?)
971399814612176896 2018-03-07 14:58:58 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend you get along with!  Of course that's a good move.  But couples don't stay together because they are "compatible".  What happens when we change?  People do change.  That shouldn't mean you should stop loving.  Right?
971399510722269185 2018-03-07 14:57:45 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend It takes a while to get past the point where you're not putting your best face on, so to speak.  Though we try to be genuine, it is true that there is biology and psychology at work, and things change over time.   I'm not saying (of course) that it's a bad idea to find someone->
971398939000885250 2018-03-07 14:55:29 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend The reason divorce rates are so high is that couples often stop treating each other with respect.  They get selfish and start thinking only of themselves.  When two people are always thinking of "me" and not "we", they're not likely to be successful.
971398245799907328 2018-03-07 14:52:44 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Me too!  I am not an advocate for destructive relationships.
971398000240185345 2018-03-07 14:51:45 UTC <brominski> @JillRiley @BrianOake @TheCurrent Just the Two of Us!
971397656240107520 2018-03-07 14:50:23 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend and it's not common to find a couple that *never* tangles with strife.  Humans act out sometimes.  Sometimes we behave in ways we are not proud of, and being loved means being forgiven, too--accepted for our imperfection.
971397143498981376 2018-03-07 14:48:21 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend isn't easy.  (it's been said nothing good comes easy)  "Love shouldn't be hard" is a great statement, and a good guiding principle.  I agree it isn't acceptable to be in a hurtful relationship--but in my fifty years, I've known a lot of people in relationships --->
971396596993753088 2018-03-07 14:46:11 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Perhaps hard isn't the right word.  I struggle with this because it's a topic I feel strongly about, and I don't want to come off like I think you are being naive about it.  I'm a very optimistic person, and it's not meant to be a negative thing when I say that commitment--->

It resulted in a few really awkward responses, and also I just couldn't stick to the rule.  lol.
971369942141603842 2018-03-07 13:00:16 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend That's fantastic!  Very fortunate!   You would agree that's probably not typical, though, right?  I mean--you wouldn't suggest to someone that unless they *never* said a hurtful word to their partner, they're not in the right relationship, I'm sure.

971130426491367424 2018-03-06 21:08:31 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend "watching" (being exposed to) The Bachelor(ette) always gets me worked up on this topic.  That "game", the end-state, and the "rules" or methods it takes to get there, it's all in direct opposition to itself.  It is all-over contradictory!

Loop bumperstickers were a common thing to spot on cars--even those with WI plates, when I was growing up. The fact it's acquired by a Christian outfit is beyond ironic.

968579238109569027 2018-02-27 20:11:00 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire I'd veto that one, too, if I was Lucy.  Don't ever let anyone tell you people with ethylene-vinyl acetate brains aren't independent thinkers!!

968503722044162048 2018-02-27 15:10:55 UTC <brominski> There should be a non-profit advocacy organization in United States like the NRA, with the influence, political willpower, and financial resources of the NRA, to vigorously protect the constitutional rights of law-abiding female body owners.

967083830162149377 2018-02-23 17:08:47 UTC <brominski> @nsj1970 I'm guessing I'd need to know a bit more french to get that joke... 
967082785872760834 2018-02-23 17:04:38 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Victim story/mentality is psychologically useful when you need excuses for not making decisions.  People tend to paint themselves into mental corners, convincing themselves they have no choices, because then they don't have to be accountable if they make the "wrong" decision.
967065529918935040 2018-02-23 15:56:04 UTC <brominski> @davrola More agreement from me.  I think maybe a good first-step in the direction of term limits would be congressional committee limits.  I think key roles in the committees tend to draw a lot of attention from special interests.
967061337091305478 2018-02-23 15:39:24 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 Great advice!  In my experience, deficits/inabilities/flaws/quirks add MUCH more fun to the role-playing than "positive" abilities, etc.

967048236946149378 2018-02-23 14:47:21 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 Back atcha, Keats.  Happy Friday, my man!
967045375826776064 2018-02-23 14:35:59 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters I...  okay, then!
967044480955224064 2018-02-23 14:32:25 UTC <brominski> @davrola Cool article--thanks for sharing.  lol @ " I know you need to get on with ruling." 
967043916213182471 2018-02-23 14:30:11 UTC <brominski> @davrola I can't disagree with that.  I get the feeling that there are plenty of folks who are Dems, and Reps, who feel a lot that their party no longer represents the principles they were founded on.  Maybe campaign $$$ reforms could improve that problem?
966790370951684096 2018-02-22 21:42:41 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Depends on whether you have a willing partner.
966778436835594241 2018-02-22 20:55:15 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 I'm frustrated too by exactly the same thing.  I get into this rut periodically, and usually relief comes when I remind myself that although I can't personally fix all that, the things *I* do still matter, and I can always find more ways to do little things that help.
966776754793787394 2018-02-22 20:48:34 UTC <brominski> @jrlind I can't imagine a better answer to that question.  WELL done!

966775115680833536 2018-02-22 20:42:04 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 You got a bee in your bonnet, Keatsy.  You tend to steer away from politics, but obviously you've been riled up!
966773651218542592 2018-02-22 20:36:14 UTC <brominski> @CorinaontheWynd and it's not a train!  Cheers, Lovely!  Glad to hear things are looking up!
966769047357575169 2018-02-22 20:17:57 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump @JTMann05 @LadyMSunshine @CarlosBaca2 @jplowd @biozenitharts I get your sentiment and I guess that's part of it--I don't disagree.  It's also about disregard for facts.
966758527929847808 2018-02-22 19:36:09 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump @Steve_Motty @AdvocateMMA1 @ftmsuperfly @pookiedoo2016 @SallyLawry Thanks!  I heard it mentioned on the radio recently and said to myself "that person has a good point!"  Passing it along!
966758239382667264 2018-02-22 19:35:00 UTC <brominski> @SheRev Thanks!  I do, too.  When someone corrects me, I thank them.  I consider it a favor!  Thing is, some people aren't intending to share a fact.  Rather, they are attempting to sell you their opinion by disguising it as a fact.
966757624485175296 2018-02-22 19:32:33 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump @Steve_Motty @AdvocateMMA1 @ftmsuperfly @pookiedoo2016 @SallyLawry Agree.  First, don't use the word "control".  Say gun "reform".  People HATE being controlled, but they LOVE "reform".  Words matter.  
966756877030871043 2018-02-22 19:29:35 UTC <brominski> @Brrrrraaaaiiins @bourgeoisalien The MEN who ran the trials made sure everyone they "tested" was found to be a witch so they couldn't describe the perverted nature of the "inspections" they performed...
966754837575630848 2018-02-22 19:21:29 UTC <brominski> When you state something as fact, and it is incorrect, it's not trolling if I correct you.  I'm talking matters of fact here, not opinion.  I presume people actually prefer to know the truth.  If I correct you and you block me, then I know you PREFER to not know the truth.
966754475905044480 2018-02-22 19:20:03 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump @JTMann05 @LadyMSunshine @CarlosBaca2 @jplowd Isn't it funny what when you're CORRECT, you never get the satisfaction of a comment back from the person who was INCORRECT saying "Hey, you're right.  I stand corrected.  Thanks for your help!" (some of the time you just get blocked)
966753023220469760 2018-02-22 19:14:16 UTC <brominski> @VisitSpudonka LMAO "practice rubs"....
966752837068836864 2018-02-22 19:13:32 UTC <brominski> @TheGnurb Tell me where the good ones are!
966711550089285633 2018-02-22 16:29:28 UTC <brominski> @iamAtheistGirl @keatsy2112 The Alex P Keaton reference was kinda funny... 
966711336825696256 2018-02-22 16:28:37 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 SMH too.  It seems like that's what politicians were for... to break gridlock a BIT.  I like the balance caused by having opposing sides.  It's like check-and-balance, but the elected ones are supposed to work TOGETHER to compromise.  It isn't about getting everything you want!
966710844167020549 2018-02-22 16:26:40 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 I'm right on board with you, Keats.  Lots of matters mixed in here, but when it comes to guns, whether Dem or GOP, you're in it to be elected, and re-elected, and (a) NRA is a major provider of campaign funds, and (b) there are a LOT of single-issue (gun) voters in US
966707617463758849 2018-02-22 16:13:51 UTC <brominski> @LaurenWern Never too young to try your first mass-killing.  'MURICA! 
966705524149575680 2018-02-22 16:05:32 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 Which is simply a recipe for stalemate.  And with non-progress comes disdain... more blame, the problem feeds itself and gets worse.
966705281878183936 2018-02-22 16:04:34 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 haha!  Funny, I didn't even notice the error.  I saw "P Keaton" and subconsciously corrected it.  Wild!
966704871306129408 2018-02-22 16:02:56 UTC <brominski> @davrola Gotcha.  Of the two "sides" there are, it's the liberals who have been, I guess, expected to be for the working class folks, whereas Republicans are usually thought to be the party of big-business.  That's interesting, even surprising!
966704215405092871 2018-02-22 16:00:20 UTC <brominski> @davrola I'd say that's a hallmark (a stereotype that isn't negative? haha!) of conservatives is being independently-minded.   Self-starting, e.g.
966680141043728384 2018-02-22 14:24:40 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 I have no problem with your rant.  It's just out of the ordinary (isn't it?) to come across a free-thinking person who doesn't just parrot a party line.  I'm not very impressed with the D party, either, to be honest--and I worship NO political saints.  (Alex P reference, nice!)
966667853159108608 2018-02-22 13:35:50 UTC <brominski> @davrola and very family-focused.  My guess is that most people don't fit into the "typical" mold of Dem/Rep, but identify MORE with one or the other--or one represents their values more closely (if not exactly).  I'm curious what caused you to switch sides.
966667220507070464 2018-02-22 13:33:19 UTC <brominski> @davrola No problemo! I agree with you 100%. Disagreement can even be productive if conversations remain respectful--focused on the subject, not personal.  For the record, I've never thought that about conservatives.  Many of the ones I've known are actually quite generous--

966449364720812032 2018-02-21 23:07:38 UTC <brominski> @girlsreallyrule Like we haven't asked enough of teachers for the marginal compensation they get--because they're passionate about the (real) work they do--educating kids, changing lives?  If they wanted to be cops, they'd have become cops.  It's bullshit.

966448388106522624 2018-02-21 23:03:46 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff I'm not shocked in the least.
966448000955551744 2018-02-21 23:02:13 UTC <brominski> @MSNBC @18major @BeccaSutherlan3 But the FACT is that the sum is 4.    It's enough to drive a reasonable person insane from frustration!!!!!
966447816280297473 2018-02-21 23:01:29 UTC <brominski> @MSNBC @BeccaSutherlan3 Thank you.  I am all about respect for multiple viewpoints, but as has been said so much recently--You're entitled to your own opinions, you are NOT entitled to your own FACTS.  Facts are facts.  @realDonaldTrump thinks things are true just because he says them...
966428223163813894 2018-02-21 21:43:38 UTC <brominski> @TehSarge yup, Steve Martin is lead of ensemble cast.
966425432403927040 2018-02-21 21:32:33 UTC <brominski> @TehSarge Parenthood (1989)  Quite an enjoyable film.  (a young Joaquin Phoenix billed as Leaf Phoenix as Garry)
966424762061938688 2018-02-21 21:29:53 UTC <brominski> @AmyMek @MP_TOXIC I really don't think we understand the long-term effects.  I don't disbelieve in behavior disorders, but my gut tells me this is VASTLY over-diagnosed, mainly for the sake of selling more drugs.  (and yes, an easy cop-out for parents when actual parenting is too hard)
966417941716766721 2018-02-21 21:02:47 UTC <brominski> @TheGardenHoOR I understand that's like actually true.  Pretty terrifying stuff.  (made cute in that pic to soften the sheer horror)

966395683791089669 2018-02-21 19:34:20 UTC <brominski> @clark_gasm I see what you did there.
966395488735059969 2018-02-21 19:33:33 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 That is not uncommon.  Our inner voices are incredibly good at delivering the worst possible assessment of ourselves.  They know all of our worst fears, embarrassing secrets, etc. and how to use them against us.  Stay aware of that.  It comes with the brain.
966395022609436674 2018-02-21 19:31:42 UTC <brominski> @Paddysgirl5 @EdKrassen No. No. No. I don't!

966392477820342273 2018-02-21 19:21:36 UTC <brominski> @AmyMek @MP_TOXIC I would never suggest that guns, the object are THE problem.  I don't think many people feel that way honestly, but making it an all-or-nothing is a great way to just shut down the conversation.  I appreciate the thoughtful feedback on the question! 
966392203135324160 2018-02-21 19:20:30 UTC <brominski> @AmyMek @MP_TOXIC I agree those things are problems that are more prevalent these days, and contribute to kids acting out badly.  (I also have serious concerns that we don't have a good idea what happens to kids who get put on head meds before they're ten)

It's a great conversation to have! Why do you think there is more mass shootings now?  I ask because I'm interested-the question is not bait.

966381375979913216 2018-02-21 18:37:29 UTC <brominski> @mitchellbasel Indeed, we have.  It's like anything that is such a fundamental change to the way people communicate, we have to experience it to learn how to use it--and how to use it in a helpful way vs. a harmful way, and that learning process isn't easy, or without a cost.
966380935573921792 2018-02-21 18:35:44 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Is it just me, or is the list of topics qualifying as touchy growing very rapidly?
966380585932546048 2018-02-21 18:34:20 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling HELL no.
966380362472534017 2018-02-21 18:33:27 UTC <brominski> @POTUS @roswell2001 @tangytangier Oh.  True.  I guess we don't have much of a point after all.  I'm happy to admit when I'm wrong! 
966380171451424768 2018-02-21 18:32:42 UTC <brominski> @mitchellbasel Damn, that is seriously heady stuff! What a take!  I said in a conversation just this morning that I'm sure the erosion of civilized discourse in our society is likely a by-product of social media, where people aren't really "people"... and that's how we're treating each other.

966377732518154241 2018-02-21 18:23:00 UTC <brominski> @ThePeachyFiend Some people definitely hate facts.  Really, really hate facts--like with a passion the heat of a thousand suns.  Facts totally blow their paranoid rants out of the water, which--you know--displeases those particular folks.

This generation isn't as wrecked as they get portrayed.  They're growing up in far more complicated times than we are, and having to mature earlier in a lot of ways.

966371520573530112 2018-02-21 17:58:19 UTC <brominski> @davrola I've come over from the right side.  How about this one... if you could eliminate one stereotype liberals tend to hold about conservatives, what would it be?
966370827385098249 2018-02-21 17:55:34 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 I've been doing a LOT of reflecting recently, and feeling a bit the same.  For a number of different reasons.  Nonetheless, these particular young folks are capitalizing on an opportunity to make something good happen from a HORRIBLE situation!

966361204028559361 2018-02-21 17:17:19 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 Am I getting this right?  The tweeter is calling the marchers hypocrites because they waited TOO long to start demonstrating?
966360892840595456 2018-02-21 17:16:05 UTC <brominski> @POTUS @roswell2001 I KNOW, RIGHT?!?!  Just like you never saw Civil Rights marches when Adams was President.  Coincidence?!?  I think NOT!

966330874986975233 2018-02-21 15:16:48 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 @OrangeJello23 Sounds like a lot of hyperbole to me.  I was referring to this ridiculous rant: "Un-American. Somebody said, 'treasonous.' I mean, Yeah, I guess why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean they certainly didn't seem to love our country that much."
966329206815756289 2018-02-21 15:10:11 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Wasn't that same prelude used for "no reason you shouldn't be married"?!?
966325595335528449 2018-02-21 14:55:50 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 (but I'm still very entertained by READING good trolling haha!)
966325517480849413 2018-02-21 14:55:31 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 I think I might be close to giving up trolling.  It's like a drug.  Makes me feel better for seconds at a time, but then just more sad when I realize it's not doing anything but contributing to the breakdown in civilized discourse in our society.
966324891833327617 2018-02-21 14:53:02 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 @OrangeJello23 There IS a particular someone who IS in the government, quite high up in the government, in fact, who I notice has been using the actual term "treason" quite often recently, without proper regard for evidence...  Twitter isn't accusing anyone of treason.  Just cleaning bots.
966324198175072256 2018-02-21 14:50:16 UTC <brominski> @OrangeJello23 Now we know! Grats on your new family member!

966323132951924736 2018-02-21 14:46:02 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters ... and before that (my folks) "we didn't know it was bad for you".  I'm still pretty dubious on that one, though I have been a collector of Old-time radio programs and can attest to commercials that said "We asked one hundred doctors--what cigarette do YOU smoke, Doctor?" lol
966322015987814401 2018-02-21 14:41:36 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters hehehe... I drive my wife nuts turning up the volume way too loud on my dad noises, hehe.  Now, if grunting becomes an Olympic event... MEDAL TIME!!

966319443755372544 2018-02-21 14:31:23 UTC <brominski> @mimidancer Pay them no mind.  Most of the people who will parrot that nonsense are only doing it to pick fights.  People aren't stupid.  They know this really happened.  The rest are only talking in an echo-chamber.  Best to treat that ridiculous claim like the utter silliness it is.

965965448012582912 2018-02-20 15:04:44 UTC <brominski> I think what he means when he said, like seven thousand times "There was NO collusion", he's splitting hairs.  It's coercion. You know what happens when US banks won't lend you money anymore and you end up running with Russian mafia...  #TrumpColluded

965605684220973057 2018-02-19 15:15:09 UTC <brominski> @AG_Conservative @TFC3Tweets We agree it probably couldn't happen federally, so that's not much of a threat, right?  That's a case of states sorting it out for themselves, as we usually like to see.

965601542643634176 2018-02-19 14:58:42 UTC <brominski> @AG_Conservative Because they're not #1, my point isn't "realistic"?
965601432710901764 2018-02-19 14:58:16 UTC <brominski> @AG_Conservative How much would the NRA need to spend in terms of campaign contributions and lobbying before my point "matches reality".  I have a source that says NRA is in the top 3% in total campaign contributions (#488 of 18,819) and top 7% of lobby $ (154 of 3,787 in 2016)
965599252117417984 2018-02-19 14:49:36 UTC <brominski> @AG_Conservative @TFC3Tweets What are you anticipating in terms of bad decisions?  What's an example of a BAD (realistic)  policy decision in this context?

It is NOT a complex situation to identify.  The NRA has bought every representative on Capital Hill.  Doesn't take a PhD to figure out why gun control issues don't advance.

964577308957904896 2018-02-16 19:08:46 UTC <brominski> @BikiniViking I played the game once, and thought it was damned cute.  I could tell what Joja was up to immediately.  Never bought a single item there.  Got ALL my dry goods from PIerre.  It made the climax a bi anti-climactic, but I was playing from the heart, so... hehe.

964535842231472128 2018-02-16 16:23:59 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Sounds relatively painless to me.  People die from Co poisoning all the time without even waking up.  I figure helping the nap along with some fine liquor only makes the send-off a bit more enjoyable.

964211724189511681 2018-02-15 18:56:03 UTC <brominski> @merenlan @keatsy2112 Yes I did!  Speaking of--did you see the 2017 film "Django"?  (about Django Reinhardt) I heard about it on the radio a couple of weeks back, and of course I remembered learning about him from you.  Wild story!
964210394242859008 2018-02-15 18:50:46 UTC <brominski> @spudmonkey66 @keatsy2112 I confused Bravado with The Pass. (doh! Not even same album--this is all from memory in my defense! hehe)  I know a lot of people loved it, but it didn't do much for me.  I always wanted it to take off or open up, but it just keeps ambling... anyhoo, music can be personal!

964207926108966912 2018-02-15 18:40:58 UTC <brominski> @BullMooseVinyl Oh, my.  Goodness, that's terribly unfortunate.

964207021426860032 2018-02-15 18:37:22 UTC <brominski> @spudmonkey66 @keatsy2112 I felt Hold Your Fire pretty well.  Presto didn't land well with me at all for the most part.  I know the guys in the band like "Bravado" a lot, but I think it just sort of lays there, notwithstanding the powerful message in the lyrics.  The mix was pretty icky too.

What does this mean?  According to our leadership, they get lucky.  I suggest moving to one of these places and making a living playing lottery.

963928348362788870 2018-02-14 00:10:01 UTC <brominski> @WrongxGen I didn't.  This is the first I noticed it, but now I have a trail of breadcrumbs!  (I just listened to T4E on Monday... and this song has been in my head since)

963925651655884800 2018-02-14 23:59:18 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Of course it has, but I didn't know that at the time.  I can't be cynical retroactively, I was sharing a feeling.

963923213624446976 2018-02-14 23:49:37 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff I'm sure it's mainly a product of my own age, how things seem so much more grave these days.  When that record came out we had the cold war, the most terrifying thing was the specter of nuclear war, the outside threat with a face.   End of the innocence, man...
963921384618545153 2018-02-14 23:42:21 UTC <brominski> I understand why you begin to think in this moment about how to SOLVE the problem.

(that was a rhetorical question, by the way--a word you don't understand) You're a DISGRACE to the office of President.  Get out.

There's that in common with our Earth variants, and also the fact that "God" (no Martian translation available) cares deeply about the outcome of their games.  We may have more in common with the Martians than are different...

959462444040179712 2018-02-02 16:24:07 UTC <brominski> @SparksofBrass I totally understand.  If our countries were people, this would be that period when "I wasn't acting like myself" and we eventually seek the forgiveness of the friends we treated like shit in the meantime.

959150891906535425 2018-02-01 19:46:07 UTC <brominski> @PowerpuffLot Indeed!  The good ones hardly fade, thankfully.  Truth is, though, I'd rather have dad back than the theme park! (I know it was his favorite too)

959145114177232896 2018-02-01 19:23:09 UTC <brominski> @PowerpuffLot I'm a super-happy person, but if I think of the actual physical location that gave me probably more joy than any other in my lifetime, it would be a certain little theme park my dad used to take me when I was a kid.  It literally doesn't exist anymore.

It's not that I ever felt like I COULDN'T speak out against a president, it's just that this is the first time I've been so put off by one.

I've never been as passionate (I guess that's what I'll call it) about politics as I am now because we have never seen these kinds of things.  Nobody can make a sensible case that Trump is no different than many other presidents.
958412204369481728 2018-01-30 18:50:50 UTC <brominski> @thehill @mariley2 @AlexAhunt9 I almost agree with you across the board, Alex.  And THANK YOU for your service. It is truly appreciated.  But saying people shouldn't speak their minds is kind of anti-first-amendment.  If nobody spoke out against King George III, we'd still be answering to England.

I listened to a lot of heavy stuff during that time, and though Rush got a pass to use any instrumentation they wanted--at the time, I felt about it a lot like I think Alex did (less synth please).

958342592256794624 2018-01-30 14:14:13 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire Over-achiever!!!! 
958341858270367744 2018-01-30 14:11:18 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies @Mymeaneviltwin Yes, please! Absolutely.
958341597657120769 2018-01-30 14:10:16 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies Thanks for being the sounding board.  Back to plan A... find a PATSY to take the fall for me!
958341441167663104 2018-01-30 14:09:39 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Nope.  As concerned as I am about how things are going in the world, my soul isn't very intimidating.
958340751167049728 2018-01-30 14:06:54 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies Thanks Reni.  My best bet is to try to get the boss to feel sorry for me.  Maybe if I cry... lol
958340032510808070 2018-01-30 14:04:03 UTC <brominski> #MyWelcomeMatWouldRead "Before you ring that doorbell to share with me the good news about the Kingdom of Heaven, picture your family ten years from now being interviewed on the evening news about how difficult it is to move on day after day not knowing if you're alive or dead."
958338703490977795 2018-01-30 13:58:46 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies The details would bore you, but I've created extra work for people by making a mistake.  That'll make me Mr. Popularity around here, hehe.  I'll have to park my car in some other parking lot today just in case...
958338421713526784 2018-01-30 13:57:39 UTC <brominski> @kurteichenwald @advisorrob @mara1169 He often contradicts his own words/actions entirely.  He was calling the election rigged before it was over because he didn't think he was going to win.  This is like complaining of your very sore elbow BEFORE you start golfing, so when you score poorly, you can say "I told you"
958337951687168001 2018-01-30 13:55:47 UTC <brominski> @kurteichenwald @liz_muncy @advisorrob You know you nailed satire if at least one person thinks you were serious. 
958336962758434816 2018-01-30 13:51:51 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies It would also distract attention from my fuck-up at work, so yeah, bring it on!
958336213252964353 2018-01-30 13:48:52 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff *begins warming up tiny kazoo to accompany*
958336022965899264 2018-01-30 13:48:07 UTC <brominski> @2112_YYZ Also, the remix was artful--not just a clean-up job (which I thought was warranted), it added some more interest to certain tracks.  IMO.
958335873401147393 2018-01-30 13:47:31 UTC <brominski> @2112_YYZ I like the remix.  I had a problem with the mix on the original the first time I listened to it, and didn't listen to the album as much as I would have because of it.  I was with a friend/Rush fan and we looked at each other and said "What?!? Ouch!"
958333378545283073 2018-01-30 13:37:37 UTC <brominski> @HatfieldAnne @colbywinters That's character assassination, Sir.  You have absolutely no proof of that!!

958328373167771650 2018-01-30 13:17:43 UTC <brominski> @TheCurrent @JillRiley Very close, right?  I'd say my guess actually fits the hints better than the actual selection!  Never thought of Collins as a love-or-hate, but Gabriel?  There was some serious snobitude around him--like you CAN'T be a musichead if you're not into Gabriel.  Not so sure bout that
958328023111098371 2018-01-30 13:16:20 UTC <brominski> @TheCurrent @JillRiley I like to play a guessing game with myself when you guys do the teaser a song or so before the VT pick, see if I can guess at least the artist.  Today, based on "love or hate", and "remembered for the video" (and having no idea whose bday it is) I guessed "Sledgehammer" by PG. 
958327353641439232 2018-01-30 13:13:40 UTC <brominski> @RushFamTourneys @VinylAnthonyI Masterpiece.
958091607575793668 2018-01-29 21:36:54 UTC <brominski> @Hexen525 Not surprising.
958091439308705792 2018-01-29 21:36:14 UTC <brominski> @RushFamTourneys Wow... ALWAYS learning.  I said to myself, "hey, look there, the Hentor guitar!"  Though I bought the tour book at the p/g concert, where Alex wrote a whole account about the maker of the Hentor guitars that was all a gag, I believed it--until today.  Again I say wow.
958090062402654208 2018-01-29 21:30:45 UTC <brominski> @JanGilson @Gamzplayah @RLKS1212 @mimidancer @YouTube @super_daaave @keatsy2112 Yeah.  You dip any further on that side, and you get into those acts, that though some of them are in the ROCK AND ROLL hall of fame, I can't categorize at all as rock, e.g. Tower of Power, Earth Wind & Fire.
958088659881865216 2018-01-29 21:25:11 UTC <brominski> @cakickboxher So..... just out of curiosity, you know, for academic purposes... how much did that cost ya?
958087435124137984 2018-01-29 21:20:19 UTC <brominski> @thehill I can't handle all the class.  Big-league class.  -smh-
958085107985928192 2018-01-29 21:11:04 UTC <brominski> @DuncanScott3 @RushFamTourneys I always comment before reading comments... I'll need to stop that.
958085002306162688 2018-01-29 21:10:39 UTC <brominski> @DuncanScott3 @RushFamTourneys Was this a trick poll?  There was vocals in Cygnus X-1...
958083504071495680 2018-01-29 21:04:42 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn That's good!  It would be more dramatic if she dies just then... but also too similar to the Darth Vader ending...
958081691343622144 2018-01-29 20:57:30 UTC <brominski> @GreenEyedTwin I was looking for the right words to describe how tired I am of this day already, and that nails it.  Does that mean tomorrow is already Wednesday?!?  Say yes!!!
958080051404304385 2018-01-29 20:50:59 UTC <brominski> I think the most offensive thing about the Cleveland Indians logo is the name Chief Wahoo.  Why not just change his name to Justin the indigenous American proud of his heritage and crazy about Indians baseball?
958079004610826241 2018-01-29 20:46:49 UTC <brominski> @MomOnFire @Jamiem2112 This time of year... I'm always "slapping" metal things before I grab onto them.  I have no idea why... habit I developed as a kid, I think.  Do I think the shock will go faster?  Or is it about punishing the object that helped complete the circuit?
958078313045676032 2018-01-29 20:44:04 UTC <brominski> @thehill Stop taking Uniom if you experience any of the following side-effects...

958070451858804736 2018-01-29 20:12:50 UTC <brominski> @Leopluradon75 Good times, eh?  We had no fear of running around, pointing them at each other, firing them.  Can you even imagine that today?
958069265940262913 2018-01-29 20:08:07 UTC <brominski> @Leopluradon75 The pistol was a snub-nose, and black metal.  WAY more realistic and thoroughly bad-ass than the silver half-plastic cowboy one with the curly carvings and imitation pearl handle...
958068112557043712 2018-01-29 20:03:32 UTC <brominski> @mimidancer Ah, yes, I see.  I sometimes forget to translate emoji...

958064271430176768 2018-01-29 19:48:16 UTC <brominski> @FilthyMuggle89 lol... I quite like that suggestion!  Or you could stalk him on social media, playing the masochist who is now incredibly turned on by the rejection.  Pour it on thick.  Tell lots of stories about how you thought of him while you were folding kid's clothes and so forth.
958063649511428096 2018-01-29 19:45:48 UTC <brominski> @SheRev I haven't been in Green Bay for several years.  I used to work there, drove past the stadium twice a day!  I'll make sure to hit the NG NEXT time I'm over there.
958063289208070144 2018-01-29 19:44:22 UTC <brominski> @mimidancer They don't think you're crazy, just gross.  You'll have to do MUCH worse than that to get an unfollow out of me, though.

958059677157351424 2018-01-29 19:30:01 UTC <brominski> @SheRev Myself and the other graduates of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College aren't fond of that either.

956946360087048192 2018-01-26 17:46:06 UTC <brominski> @RushFamTourneys @cyclesinthedark @vivien2112 Agreed.  Whatever the opposite of "let down" is, that's how I feel treated by Rush.  I know they appreciate all of us.
956946127072489473 2018-01-26 17:45:10 UTC <brominski> @GreenEyedTwin I knew I should of spelt it "their".

Maybe they just don't want to be "those guys" you casually referenced--who make a HUGE deal out of retirement then come back five years later on a "reunion tour" for $300/ticket.

I think our favorite musicians give their fan base credit for being pretty savvy--being able to handle a little nuance.  I didn't need anything but the film they played at the end of the R40 concert.
956902166177992705 2018-01-26 14:50:29 UTC <brominski> @WrongxGen That is the correct solution.  The only other option is NO Rush at the laundromat, and I'm sure we agree that's really not an option.

It is NOT 107.1 The River, the Valley's Choice for Classic Rock.

956567276194549763 2018-01-25 16:39:45 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 @NateC2112 Amen that.  I presume you saw "Time Stand Still"?  Neil really didn't want to do the R40 tour.  He thought they'd really arrived with the CA album and tour--but they didn't make a decision then, and to be fair he felt like he should make the declaration before 'just one more'.
956565456306999296 2018-01-25 16:32:31 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 @NateC2112 Absolutely.  For every time I've seen an artist/band I respect get to the point where even *I* think they're just milking it and not really on their game anymore, I should be satisfied with this.  It's a classic  'dont cry cuz it's over, smile because it happened' situation.

953727125420412934 2018-01-17 20:34:00 UTC <brominski> @VexingVision Do you groom your follower list to keep it at 666 or is this just a lucky moment?
953726918855221248 2018-01-17 20:33:11 UTC <brominski> @VexingVision The northern kind.  The kind that people who attend rodeos often refer to as a "yankee".  
953724013850906625 2018-01-17 20:21:38 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 I looked at your blog.  There it was!
953723238261186560 2018-01-17 20:18:33 UTC <brominski> This was in my feed, but I don't (think I) need an oscilloscope.  Probably.  In case you do, here!https://twitter.com/RohdeSchwarzNA/status/930196271666642944
953722875940352000 2018-01-17 20:17:07 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 Thanks!
953722234186686464 2018-01-17 20:14:34 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 hehehe... I didn't figure zero comments constituted a hubbub.  Was it a discussion about whether David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar was the better Van Halen front-man?  That one gets pretty heated as well.
953721873992441858 2018-01-17 20:13:08 UTC <brominski> @Fawkes_sake @sunsetndustries Oh, I don't doubt it!  I remember when mechanical bulls in bars was a hot thing... hehe
953721583880822784 2018-01-17 20:11:59 UTC <brominski> @cbsa82 People are passionate about 4e.  A polarizing topic.
953721233169965056 2018-01-17 20:10:35 UTC <brominski> @cheryl_marlin @DiamondLynne1 He's not the best educated kid.  He thinks "disproportionate" is a fancy way of saying zero.
953720610135465984 2018-01-17 20:08:07 UTC <brominski> @Thymbraeus There's the look of a fellow who is definitely not impressed.  I guess it only takes one...
953720451628519429 2018-01-17 20:07:29 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian @DeanMSimmons I haven't been to Wyoming in ages!  I'll file that recommendation. 
953720116310626304 2018-01-17 20:06:09 UTC <brominski> @Fawkes_sake @sunsetndustries I see... so it's not as much like stock car racing as I thought...
953719361910509568 2018-01-17 20:03:09 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries @Fawkes_sake Probably the least terrifying kind of clowns.  They are always running for their lives.  I've SEEN rodeo on television, so I know this.
953719184743124994 2018-01-17 20:02:27 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries @Fawkes_sake Huh!  There isn't any dancing at rodeos, though.  It's mostly organized animal cruelty with judging.  I understand a lot of social events in Scotland involve fist-fights.  Is that true?
953717602496458753 2018-01-17 19:56:10 UTC <brominski> @Fawkes_sake @sunsetndustries You want them to get trampled real good, 'cuz that's exciting! Just not die.  I get it.  I can't imagine rodeo clown is the kind of career you can retire on...
953717031207079936 2018-01-17 19:53:54 UTC <brominski> Yippee Ki-Yay!https://twitter.com/sunsetndustries/status/953716575634206721
953716575558950912 2018-01-17 19:52:05 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries @Fawkes_sake I could answer if I knew what a ceilidh, but I think you're getting the gist here, so I'll just go on a limb and agree.    *adds "this isn't my first ceilidh" to list of things to not say*
953716230892019713 2018-01-17 19:50:43 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries Yes, agreed.  Also a rodeo.
953715669694058498 2018-01-17 19:48:29 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian Agreed.  This is a job for Go-Pro.  Do they have filters for those?  I think getting my face beat in would look good in sepia tone.
953714985733120006 2018-01-17 19:45:46 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian lol!  And you know what?  I'd say that about a hundred fucking times, too, FOR SURE.  By the end of the thing, someone will have punched me in the face or had the strong urge to do so.
953714756665462786 2018-01-17 19:44:51 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian Right?
953714695013322752 2018-01-17 19:44:37 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries I suspect some kind of rift in the space/time continuum.  Perhaps a temporal causality loop or wormhole.
953714511873216512 2018-01-17 19:43:53 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian But now I get it even more... I just realized I probably shouldn't have always referred to my first wife as my first wife when we were married.
953714288358805510 2018-01-17 19:43:00 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian I see where you're going with that... but I think I can just attend the one, then I can start using the phrase again, because that first one will have been forever accounted for.

953713421958221826 2018-01-17 19:39:33 UTC <brominski> I'm either going to stop using the phrase "This isn't my first rodeo", or attend at least one rodeo.
953712434728132608 2018-01-17 19:35:38 UTC <brominski> @Suzy_LizzyM They made the Tide pods so they could charge more for the same amount of Tide, plus it would be attractive to your kiddies, so they could then charge you again MORE to put the pods in a lockbox.  MARKETING!!

953355250941026304 2018-01-16 19:56:18 UTC <brominski> @Trump_Newz *Yawn*  I remember when things like this were the signal of a guaranteed major-league scandal.  He'll just say they're lying, all the morons in red hats will either believe him or quietly say "f-yeah!  I'd sure be bangin' all the porn stars if I was a billionaire!"
953347496742412291 2018-01-16 19:25:30 UTC <brominski> @CoolChris_007 @JadeBlondez You'd hope, yes.  "Love" is a squishy thing that defies definition.  What makes up "love" at the beginning of a relationship are attraction, infatuation, curiosity, etc.--later on, it becomes more about actions than blushing and feeling a tingle in your tummy, it's commitment.
953345346670821379 2018-01-16 19:16:57 UTC <brominski> @CoolChris_007 @JadeBlondez Well, given the tendency to present the "best" version of ourselves (sometimes to the point of acting OUT of character) early in a relationship, the answer is a maybe.  Now, who did you DECIDE to CONTINUE loving?  THERE we go!!!! 
953343249351172098 2018-01-16 19:08:37 UTC <brominski> @boomdingwinning Depends on how low you're running on toothpaste...
953339558799736832 2018-01-16 18:53:57 UTC <brominski> If you have to sacrifice your principles to defend a person who is supposed to defend your principles, but doesn't, ask yourself which is more important; your principles, or the IDEA of your principles...   Yeah.  Just ruminate on that.
953328163257552896 2018-01-16 18:08:40 UTC <brominski> If you're frequently compelled to vigorously defend the fact that you're not a racist, you're probably a racist.

Twist: the game started with them having already apprehended the fugitive and heading back to town...
953280323047120896 2018-01-16 14:58:34 UTC <brominski> @CoolChris_007 I think it was one of those great nuggets of advice my grandpappy shared with me.  Don't eat yellow snow, and never trust four dudes dressed in matching head-to-toe black pleather.

I do it because it's a way to get places.  I'd even do it to avoid the 9 hour drive I could make to Indy, hehe.  Last year, I flew to Australia. Now THAT is a long-ass flight!  Ouch.

(it's a bit the inverse of "if you're not growing, you're dying, and feels to me less negative! hehe)

951819397169065984 2018-01-12 14:13:22 UTC <brominski> @VexingVision I think so too.  That term really only existed to represent the concept of the likely object of a certain person's desire.  Linguistics is interesting!

951556480771284992 2018-01-11 20:48:38 UTC <brominski> @Wyndgrove You see, dad.  The reason they cast an actress who is unremarkable in every way is that about a zillion teenage girls picture themselves in Bella's situation, and they need to be made to think "if SHE could have it, then *I* could have it!"

Collapsing "Hit Points" also into the stat pools, great.  It creates more push-and-pull
951547184780120065 2018-01-11 20:11:42 UTC <brominski> @WendyR38224819 @colbywinters Not sure I'm buying this "I'm fine" story...
951533966930141187 2018-01-11 19:19:11 UTC <brominski> @WendyR38224819 If I'm posing the question to the whole world, I can't presume the persons preference.  It occurred to me that even sex/gender isn't the right designation.  I really don't need to know, I'm just kinda curious if there is a go-to term for a 'likely object of ones desire' hehe
951533566835482625 2018-01-11 19:17:35 UTC <brominski> @WendyR38224819 (it reminded me of the time my dad got all crushy on this girl at a gas station in Quebec who could only speak French lol)  ANYWAY... the phrase [opposite sex], for this purpose, isn't exactly correct, ya see?  So I wondered... there you have it.
951533241483382785 2018-01-11 19:16:18 UTC <brominski> @WendyR38224819 Add to this she's cute as a button, and I walk out of there thinking of a question I'd pose... "is there anything cuter than an attractive member of the [opposite sex] who barely speaks your language trying to tell you a story?

She said (I think) this is her first winter here, and driving is hard.  She told me about a four-cars [accident].  It was a lot of effort for her to try to tell the story

951525109147361280 2018-01-11 18:43:59 UTC <brominski> What would be the present-appropriate term to replace "opposite sex", in the oft-used general context of one who would presumably be desirable to another in a romantic and/or sexual sense? Does the question make sense?  Is there something wrong with even the concept? (serious ?)
951523900042743808 2018-01-11 18:39:10 UTC <brominski> @KuwaTakaSurfing Where HAVE you BEEN?!?!?   Oh, wait... I have to read it.  nvm (welcome back!)

951495599613980672 2018-01-11 16:46:43 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x So, you'd say in a nutshell, the cost is worth it just to satisfy the curiosity? (and also generically, "it's fun!"??)  People spend money on ALL sorts of things in the interest of fun--so no judging here!

951489647737278464 2018-01-11 16:23:04 UTC <brominski> @burnthecomedian I'm in love with the stat pool mechanic in the Cypher system (Numenera, The Strange, @MonteCookGames ) it adds more "factors" into *any* dice-rolling situation.  It adds to the gravity of every dice roll because the player has more to consider.  
951486834583973888 2018-01-11 16:11:53 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x A person close to me wants to know... what does a person hope to gain by doing the DNA ancestry thing (person absolutely does not get it.  I'm pretty ambivalent on the subject).  If you'd care to answer, I'll pass it along!

He sees himself in a separate realm of existence than the rest of us.   A higher one.   Though it is an offensive word, can we keep "retard" in the lexicon, and use it only for Trump?

951174825061515265 2018-01-10 19:32:04 UTC <brominski> @theclobra I wonder why fundamentalist Christians are concerned with gay marriage, but not reinstating slavery... hmmm...
951174484635025408 2018-01-10 19:30:43 UTC <brominski> @TehSarge It's an infection in the intestine caused/inflamed by small food particles getting stuck in these little pockets that do form in the intestine.  It's pretty gross.  And painful.  Someone I know well had a bout last year, spend 3 days in the hospital.

951173318505369601 2018-01-10 19:26:05 UTC <brominski> @theclobra Yep.  Oh, and remember, if you sell your daughter into slavery, she's not to go free as the male slaves do.  Same chapter right there.  Oh, and also, you can't touch your wife when she has her period, if you do, you must wash all your clothes... can I go on?

951171114348285952 2018-01-10 19:17:20 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff True dat.  While the choices may be overall not *too* unhealthy, the all-you-can-eat concept is a recipe for over-eating and that ain't healthy!

951081336667852800 2018-01-10 13:20:35 UTC <brominski> @Pajjr2016 If only he were competent enough, he might be.  Clearly, anyone who would hire him for any important job (that's you--every Trump voter) should be wary of the fact he has the intellectual agility of a paperweight.

950793499498221570 2018-01-09 18:16:49 UTC <brominski> @ashdialin lol... nice gif.  If they did that with only a hat, I'd be REALLY impressed!

950425636044181504 2018-01-08 17:55:04 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff i.e. but are you actually liberal, like at ALL?!?    Try to get elected to the US Congress as an open atheist.  Not even a Democrat can get away with that...
950424091521114112 2018-01-08 17:48:56 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff The point I made earlier is that the many of the Republicans of 1950's, for example, socially AND fiscally, were left of today's Democrats.  Truman warned of this in his farewell address.  Some of the more prophetic stuff ever.  Yep--politicians are pawns of business.
950422877333065728 2018-01-08 17:44:06 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff I don't disagree with you one bit that politics is now just a career choice (next step up the chain from lobbyist).  Getting elected is the only real point of being in politics anymore, it seems.  I would not say one of our parties is more "geniune" than the other in that regard.

950415646608756736 2018-01-08 17:15:22 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 What we're learning is that a lot of the machinations of government depend on the elected officials knowing "how things work" because not all of it is written down--and starts with a respect for certain traditions.  We know assface respects nothing, so there's that...

I was about to say Abba--who I was pretty darned obsessed with around the age of ten... but that would be a damned lie, because I still love those songs.  Maybe Village People!

949361530256191488 2018-01-05 19:26:41 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @DeanMSimmons That's a whole lot of handy right there.  I've always suspected the parents, honestly.  Still do.  The amount of "torture" they put that kid through when she was alive, for their own satisfaction, was already bordering on Munchhausen By Proxy, IMO.
949360433583898624 2018-01-05 19:22:20 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @DeanMSimmons Absolutely.  The fact they know something isn't right (like someone is too close on the property, etc. and you're not aware) is golden.  Dogs will wake from a sleep for seemingly no reason (cuz they KNOW).  It's awesome.

949344181570465792 2018-01-05 18:17:45 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @DeanMSimmons 'course the Miss America contestants tend to be college-aged, and have had experience in who knows how many years' worth of these to get to that level.  I dunno... seems to me it's running contrary to some of the archaic attitudes we're hoping to adjust these days.
949343912241565696 2018-01-05 18:16:41 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @DeanMSimmons I think I've got a bigger problem with the child ones because I presume the contestants aren't in them by choice, it is the act of a parent trying to live vicariously through their child.  Ick.

949336409550327808 2018-01-05 17:46:52 UTC <brominski> @NateC2112 I'm surprised they made it this long, and given the recently heightened awareness around gender-related issues we're all familiar with, seems like this would be a good year to just STOP.  My opinion.
949331028623192064 2018-01-05 17:25:29 UTC <brominski> What's your opinion of "beauty pageants" (Miss America, etc.)   (feel free to make comments--the news recently of a new Director of the Miss America pageant had me thinking about it...)

948982826413756416 2018-01-04 18:21:51 UTC <brominski> @BlueAJ41 @B75434425 What evidence?   There's evidence of voter fraud?  Lots of evidence?  Where?  I'm interested to see this!
948981424417378309 2018-01-04 18:16:17 UTC <brominski> @WalkVirusGaming @ChaoticAnarachy @DeanMSimmons @litzabronwyn Oh, gosh.  Great question, and there was this MEGA-thread dedicated to exactly that question!  I wonder if anyone has it bookmarked... I'll find it! (it's just a really awesome, kind, fun bunch of people, most or all of whom are big gamers, who congregate here on Twitter!

948948171740405761 2018-01-04 16:04:09 UTC <brominski> @Krud I've always presumed that rule-of-thumb, too.  I think it's generally accurate.  Cloudy skies also improve FM radio reception.  [can't verify]

948919837660729344 2018-01-04 14:11:34 UTC <brominski> @BrianOake @JillRiley @TheCurrent @keatsy2112 They played "Uncontrollable Urge" during this morning's show, haha!!  Yeah, I like Kiss, too.  Once again, I'm sure, due to the impact they made on me at a certain stage of life.  Can also appreciate their savvy, commercially.
948919117683281920 2018-01-04 14:08:42 UTC <brominski> @BrianOake @JillRiley @TheCurrent @keatsy2112 That's the theme of this topic being discussed on their show this morning--it's bands/artists that are generally viewed as "important" or very widely-loved that you appreciate, you can give them props for talent, impact, etc., but who simply didn't turn YOUR personal crank.

It was a personal connection for me that had, I'm sure, a lot to do with what was going on in my life, but the first two are like sacred to me--they are in a class by themselves, two records I could not part with no matter what.
948915276279664643 2018-01-04 13:53:26 UTC <brominski> @BrianOake @JillRiley @TheCurrent @keatsy2112 You're not alone on Grateful Dead, Keasty--it seems they are sort of a love-em-or-hate-em kind of deal.  I didn't mention that I AM a Dave Matthews Band fan, and totally can't get how so many people DESPISE them, hehe...
948912102470836224 2018-01-04 13:40:49 UTC <brominski> A band that may not be considered "important", but that a lot of people found really fun to listen to, on the other hand, that I honestly can't STAND... The Cars.  When I hear a Cars tune, I just wait patiently for it to be over.
948912101313085441 2018-01-04 13:40:49 UTC <brominski> @TheCurrent @JillRiley @BrianOake re: the morning conversation, I've got two, representing two generations, that have been pretty widely recognized as "important" that simply just didn't get me--David Bowie, and Radiohead.   Don't hate 'em, they just didn't shake my world.

Funny... though Lennon is so mythical now, of the first releases of the Beatles members post-Beatles (follow that?) this album is my favorite.  Plastic Ono band was my LEAST favorite.

944266813763915776 2017-12-22 18:02:06 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Thanks! You know, the way small children can try the patience of adults, and for the most part we cut them slack because we know they can't help it.  
944260924432699393 2017-12-22 17:38:42 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I like to play them that they aren't "snooty" as much as truly troubled having to deal with beings that don't have their breadth of knowledge/experience, like it is a burden for them--as opposed to characters who are just snots.  If that makes sense.

944213412527124480 2017-12-22 14:29:54 UTC <brominski> @SparksofBrass Cheers to you of the English Midlands!  You can be proud of Slade--they have been and continue to be fine stewards of straight-ahead rock & roll!!  
944212225270648832 2017-12-22 14:25:11 UTC <brominski> @wyrddrgn It is a great record, for sure!  I didn't realize growing up (exposed to the Born in the USA period) what a fantastic songwriter Bruce is.
944211785699164160 2017-12-22 14:23:26 UTC <brominski> @VisitSpudonka A very solid band!
944211527497809920 2017-12-22 14:22:25 UTC <brominski> @wyrddrgn Of which tune?  I made the connection because I know of TWO Slade tunes Quiet Riot covered ("Cum on Feel the Noize" and "Mama We're All Crazee Now"), Manfred Mann covered both "I Came for You" and "Blinded by the Light" by Springsteen.
944210779770892288 2017-12-22 14:19:27 UTC <brominski> Freakin' SLADE!  They didn't catch on here, but they were legit glam-rock icons elsewhere.  Slade was to Quiet Riot as Bruce Springsteen was to Manfred Mann, yes?  https://twitter.com/EUFCsteve/status/944007301446406144

It wasn't planned--I got the ticket day of the show, ended up on the floor right against the ring-walkway stage piece.  It was awesome!  "This band is 3/4 original, one quarter inevitable!" ~DLR

That's why the song might make for good covering... modernize the arrangement a bit.  Replace those windy/whistly synth plinks and plunks with something that pushes a bit more, add some heavier guitar.  I love the melody!

943877142441537538 2017-12-21 16:13:41 UTC <brominski> @MusicMan1730 @highlandsmystic I developed the Rush habit around 1982, and kinda worked my way backward getting the records.  By the time I got to Fly By Night, I was already aware how nerdy they were (in the good way, of course), but any doubt was removed when I saw a song titled "Rivendell"...

943568475989139456 2017-12-20 19:47:09 UTC <brominski> @benshapiro @LShaffer50 @blindzeebra Is it a relatively new company?  It seems to me that a company (I'm talking public) get get away with a lot in an uncontrolled growth phase, but when things level out, shareholders will still expect growth.  It's sure dog-eat-dog.

943565713838616578 2017-12-20 19:36:11 UTC <brominski> @benshapiro @blindzeebra @LShaffer50 I'd say companies are more likely to add positions (not that they will just because)--there is nothing in there that's an incentive to raise the wages for existing positions, though.  That would just be passing along the gift, and why would they do that?  They are corps!

943548551698812928 2017-12-20 18:27:59 UTC <brominski> @benshapiro @LShaffer50 @blindzeebra Oh, corps and all of us who work for one and have a profit-based incentive will probably benefit from this.  Only by virtue of our connection to the corp, of course...
943520800661008385 2017-12-20 16:37:43 UTC <brominski> @owillis @Shareblue Because, clearly, he's just another asshole who believes that America is "great"(er) when people can use and abuse others however they please.  The GOP doesn't have one whole soul among them, even if you add them all together.

943469567736778753 2017-12-20 13:14:08 UTC <brominski> @NateC2112 I realize The Final Cut was not a very popular Pink Floyd album (more so it was a Roger Waters thing) , but I got into it HEAVILY.  I played the shit out of it.  Know all the words.  It's a well-crafted concept piece, imo, and sounds great!

943179277280870406 2017-12-19 18:00:37 UTC <brominski> @atanak74 I so get you.  Seeing a typo or (gasp) homophone error in a posted tweet drives me NUTS!  (also... the actual totally-scientific answer to why the goose V formation is longer on one side is that there's more geese on that side.  SCIENCE!!)

943134736507129856 2017-12-19 15:03:38 UTC <brominski> @atanak74 Have you noticed that when the geese fly in that arrow-like formation, there's always one side of the formation that's longer than the other?  Do you know why that is?

938136841764646912 2017-12-05 20:03:47 UTC <brominski> @humancomedian I think it's just that until the Charmin bears came along, it wasn't possible for bears to communicate with humans, and that bears have always had remarkably sensitive anuses.   So, you know...

I'm not as experienced as the rest of you, I'd gather.  The single-player campaign in GTA V is about as good as I've played in my limited experience.  But you know--the point is there I hope! ;)

(1) Single-player games with a poorly-thought-out-and-bolted on MP (GTA V), and (2) Multi-player games which may or may not have a stupid single-player campaign.  (e.g. Battlefield)

936269788178976768 2017-11-30 16:24:47 UTC <brominski> @michee67 @keatsy2112 I know exactly what you mean.  I was pretty moved during the funeral I mentioned when the pastor said "I know I'm supposed to say this is part of God's plan, and somehow it's 'good', but it's not.  This SUCKS."
936266917328883713 2017-11-30 16:13:22 UTC <brominski> @kingdomdeath @ShoshiesMinis Well, at least she's in appropriate armor!    (Excellent work!)
936266482568265729 2017-11-30 16:11:39 UTC <brominski> I'm getting a lot of "her recollection is different than mine" in my news these days... anyone else?  Means (a) guys are shitty at recollecting, (b) women accuse men of sexual misconduct for no apparent reason, or (c) abusers are telling flimsy lies to prop up their apologies...
936265610761326593 2017-11-30 16:08:11 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind White House:  Doesn't matter, ISIS is BAD.
936265475352399872 2017-11-30 16:07:38 UTC <brominski> @thehill Tillerson probably can't WAIT to get the hell out of that shit show.
936265200046571520 2017-11-30 16:06:33 UTC <brominski> @michee67 @keatsy2112 I feel ya.  The saddest one I attended was the very unexpected one for the 16 year-old daughter of a co-worker.  Most of the speakers were classmates, etc.  Totally heart-breaking.  Good beams out to you and your lady, Keats.  
936264659304439808 2017-11-30 16:04:24 UTC <brominski> @michee67 Nice!  (mine is from June 16 pic.twitter.com/aSVMHQ1saa
936232399188480000 2017-11-30 13:56:12 UTC <brominski> @thehill We should reflect on votes for president before we cast our ballots...
936230985938751488 2017-11-30 13:50:36 UTC <brominski> @ChaoticAnarachy Oh, yay!  I missed this on my Twitter hiatus last week.  Lovely!
936230224282480640 2017-11-30 13:47:34 UTC <brominski> @ATwistedSis Happy birthday to a young man who has had a wild ride for so few years.  He and I have something in common...   Gratz!
936227584966385666 2017-11-30 13:37:05 UTC <brominski> @ChaoticAnarachy Yeah, totally!  Got a tree yet?
936227434810224640 2017-11-30 13:36:29 UTC <brominski> @CNNPolitics and of course Trump will hit back, harder, because he's such a tough leader.  That's what all those red hat people love about him--He's a belligerent fuck with no respect for anyone.
936227117485953024 2017-11-30 13:35:13 UTC <brominski> @thehill Oooooooooooooh.  Ouch.  Condemned!  I'll bet that hurt...    That does NOTHING to STOP him from burning this country to the ground.
936226585878855680 2017-11-30 13:33:06 UTC <brominski> @ChaoticAnarachy Very nice!  I think your new pad has a keen vibe.
936218176295235586 2017-11-30 12:59:41 UTC <brominski> I find it ironic that conservationists are usually not conservatives, and conservatives tend not to be conservationists...

How about Geddy playing bass with Yes at the R&R HoF ceremony this year, eh?  I remember Billy Sheehan saying in an interview Cliff was his favorite.  Obviously very different styles, but AC/DC's rhythm section?  YES, please!

Yeah, I felt like I'm cheating using a pick on bass, so I don't, but any time I'd alt-pick something on guitar, rather than double-fingering (trouble with timing that out), I do the Geddy, where my fingertip is essentially a pick.

(I'd love a Music Man Stingray for xmas, btw, if you're short of gift recipients--wait you have two girls.  Withdrawn!)

935951311329202177 2017-11-29 19:19:16 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 He took his craft very seriously.  I think any singer could do well to take some pointers from his work--particularly on how he handled phrasing.

935892219000745984 2017-11-29 15:24:27 UTC <brominski> Why?  Because @realDonaldTrump is not only the worst president this country has ever seen, and probably will ever see, but also a stupid, gross, ridiculous, unprincipled puddle of sloth vomit.https://twitter.com/AynRandPaulRyan/status/935860266662739968

You only demonstrate how childish, demented and IGNORANT (you can take that as UN-intelligent.  Yes, I'm saying you have a LOW IQ.  I don't believe your LIE that it's high) you are.  Worst president EVER past or future.

931224050290057216 2017-11-16 18:14:49 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 The spooky truth, I figure, is that any man who has no such behavior in his past isn't the type to consider running for public office... what a pickle.
931222473512808449 2017-11-16 18:08:33 UTC <brominski> @alfranken @arogDC @kushkandy95 You get to pick how many chances you issue! 
931221985237102592 2017-11-16 18:06:37 UTC <brominski> @alfranken @arogDC @kushkandy95 Oh?  Didn't know that.  This must be the better one.  There's not much good to say, but saying nothing certainly isn't a good choice.
931220672130486273 2017-11-16 18:01:24 UTC <brominski> @JokelahomaMic @RiaWojo You know?  I believe that is true!
931220505260118017 2017-11-16 18:00:44 UTC <brominski> @HunkyGayJesus Sounds like you got yourself a spot o' the Flu there, Jeez.  Take good care of yourself!  Fluids and rest!!
931219901053853696 2017-11-16 17:58:20 UTC <brominski> @alfranken @kushkandy95 @arogDC Kept the statement on-point, too.  The apology is important.  The fact that women are speaking out is important, and the fact men are--as he said, possibly for the first time--looking hard at their own actions past and present is important.
931218827911757824 2017-11-16 17:54:04 UTC <brominski> @rickmoran_rwnh @DeityFree @PJMedia_com Because the plan already generates so much new revenue?  That plan is a time bomb.  We have bills to pay around here.

It's at the macro level religion turns from being a mostly-positive influence to a very divisive thing.

931214234637295616 2017-11-16 17:35:49 UTC <brominski> @AynRandPaulRyan Imagine how grueling it was for him, saying nothing for those first eleven minutes...
931201696214257664 2017-11-16 16:45:59 UTC <brominski> @mitchellbasel I guess I should quit being sad about it.  Democracy failed.  It didn't work.  This is what we got.  We didn't see the risk and here we are.  I hope, at least, the totalitarian regime implements single-payer healthcare coverage...

925845262223933441 2017-11-01 22:01:26 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 I think it cheapens me, makes ME less genuine to not go all-in.  If I haven't granted trust, I'll never know if the person deserved it.

925843134122283009 2017-11-01 21:52:59 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 It may just be semantics, but in practice that's not how it really works.  You don't get a chance to demonstrate trustworthiness from zero
925842297157234689 2017-11-01 21:49:39 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 THEN, if it is abused, I can see retracting said trust.  But nothing good comes from a place of withholding respect and trust, in my opinion
925842152344702977 2017-11-01 21:49:05 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 I think respect has to be GIVEN.  Like trust.  You can't earn someone's trust from a place of distrust.  It must first be granted.
925841971108773888 2017-11-01 21:48:21 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 Beautiful.  I have the same rule.  I have always had a bit of trouble with the "respect is earned" stance.  I GET it, what people mean, but

925467972310831104 2017-10-31 21:02:13 UTC <brominski> @Salvia_Purple Grape seemed funniest.  I was originally going to say Purplesaurus Rex, but that was a whole different era from Stretch Armstrong, so...

925445395056156672 2017-10-31 19:32:30 UTC <brominski> @nigel_dictator @Fun_Beard and honestly, I think it was too the point where the genre almost HAD to take itself a little LESS seriously to be more believable (irony!)
925445219973238784 2017-10-31 19:31:49 UTC <brominski> @nigel_dictator @Fun_Beard You're right.  Perhaps the overt camp of it, at the time, made it harder to take seriously, but it had some scare to it.
925444718250602498 2017-10-31 19:29:49 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 Indeed, Keats.  Just like that.

915909650259828736 2017-10-05 12:00:52 UTC <brominski> @ellenew79 @_sprf @kristenRN202 @SadlyCatless @TheScottfather @justsumgirly @KattFunny @TheSeaRose Yay!  Fun tag!  
915687026283941889 2017-10-04 21:16:14 UTC <brominski> @EddieMcSugarnut @chincha33 I also went into a store and bought something... come to think of it, all I did was go to the mall.
915686602885746688 2017-10-04 21:14:33 UTC <brominski> @EddieMcSugarnut @chincha33 I mall-walked a couple of weeks ago, but I did it (a) in the middle of the morning, not early a.m., (b) by myself, (c) not in jogging suit.
915685182627352576 2017-10-04 21:08:54 UTC <brominski> @fluffykoalaa I think they look really great.  But hey--it's your assessment that matters most! I won't argue with the boss.
915684755772932096 2017-10-04 21:07:13 UTC <brominski> @ericgarland Hmmmm.  No correlation to anything, there.... (wow)
915683784250576896 2017-10-04 21:03:21 UTC <brominski> @JoeGKushner lol... need a receipt to show purchase of a hunting license?  Details, details, the framework is there, right?!?
915679180221816832 2017-10-04 20:45:03 UTC <brominski> @905wesa @studioloraine @justplainbob @baconjess What an awesome name!! hahaha!!!!
915678309714923520 2017-10-04 20:41:36 UTC <brominski> @misstamerica30 @Danko_Richards Tying in homage to Tom.  VERY NICE!
915676389411565570 2017-10-04 20:33:58 UTC <brominski> @propapergirl @SkullsNCookies It always makes me wonder if their standards are that high for themselves, or if they just take the easy, victim-story route toward people.
915676178551377921 2017-10-04 20:33:08 UTC <brominski> @propapergirl @SkullsNCookies seem to want to set out hard rules and high bars about how well YOU behave toward them.  What THEY deserve and can not tolerate.   ...
915675971524624384 2017-10-04 20:32:18 UTC <brominski> @propapergirl @SkullsNCookies There's probably a few other good ones.  You made a great point, though, if I can generalize, and that is that *some* people (cont)
915675347374485504 2017-10-04 20:29:49 UTC <brominski> Listen to the Jesus.  The Jesus got it.https://twitter.com/HunkyGayJesus/status/915675092587343872
915673883956695041 2017-10-04 20:24:00 UTC <brominski> @propapergirl @SkullsNCookies 3 greatest lies ever told: What a beautiful baby! Check is in the mail. I won't cum in there.
915672327014281219 2017-10-04 20:17:49 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters As much as I'd like to argue, you make a decent point.  
915671834166689792 2017-10-04 20:15:52 UTC <brominski> @Cptsugarbear "Respawning in 4...3...2...1..."
915669578990198789 2017-10-04 20:06:54 UTC <brominski> @propapergirl @SkullsNCookies Another great point.  I'll often "argue" with people who say "trust is earned".  It can only be granted, and sure, lost, but first granted.
915669387767623681 2017-10-04 20:06:09 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies @propapergirl I couldn't agree more!
915669148327432192 2017-10-04 20:05:11 UTC <brominski> @gaitoulabackder I can't roll my eyes far enough...
915668355587207169 2017-10-04 20:02:02 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 @Kevin_Saito BEWARE FRUITCAKE!
915667985792192512 2017-10-04 20:00:34 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies @propapergirl In my opinion, there is no greater act of love than forgiveness.  Loving is easy if you are never hurt, never feel wronged.  
915665035376123904 2017-10-04 19:48:51 UTC <brominski> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @KatieELN I have NO problem with that, Katie.  You picked very appropriate words.  
915664117666639875 2017-10-04 19:45:12 UTC <brominski> @thehill These are for what, then?  Shooting cans?  I can do that with a nerf gun...
915663305443770369 2017-10-04 19:41:58 UTC <brominski> You really shouldn't talk about @colbywinters  like that.  He's really not *that* bad...
915658037876133888 2017-10-04 19:21:02 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies I have a sixth lumbar vertebrae.  
915657540746309632 2017-10-04 19:19:04 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies @KeshaTedder I think you just described exactly how that works!

915655501345693696 2017-10-04 19:10:58 UTC <brominski> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @KatieELN Sure, that, and because she's a confu---nah, too easy.
915653088714874880 2017-10-04 19:01:23 UTC <brominski> @strategiclimits Yes.  Essentially, that's sure what it sounds like.
915652972545282048 2017-10-04 19:00:55 UTC <brominski> @cletus1969 @Amy_Siskind @keatsy2112 You know the old saying, if you can't dazzle them with your intellect, baffle them with your bullshit!

915651081694273537 2017-10-04 18:53:24 UTC <brominski> @GreenEyedTwin @LISAMW979 Me too!    I do mean MY bed, at my home... not YOUR bed.  I mean, unless, you know... nevermind.  I'll be over here.  
915650186285846533 2017-10-04 18:49:51 UTC <brominski> Exactly! NRA drones cleverly train the ignorant to equate common-sense controls that REDUCE risk to "The government will take ALL your guns"

915649119137538048 2017-10-04 18:45:36 UTC <brominski> @cletus1969 @Amy_Siskind I have no confidence in his ability to not choose the WORST possible thing to say or do in any circumstance.
915641406705868800 2017-10-04 18:14:57 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters They're fucking delicious.  And not TOO terrible, nutritionally, but this is after I already ate all the rabbit food to be "good"...

915640216555319296 2017-10-04 18:10:14 UTC <brominski> Cars are deady, but we can still own them.  There's traffic laws, speed limits, traffic signals, airbags. Controls to REDUCE the risks.
915639766846201859 2017-10-04 18:08:26 UTC <brominski> @BlueAJ41 @DineshDSouza There you go.  Train the ignorant to think "Take all my guns away" when they hear "gun control".
915638123933130754 2017-10-04 18:01:55 UTC <brominski> Of course NO gun control law can prevent EVERY possible tragedy.  That's not the point, and it's a bullshit argument against controls!!!
915634849901359104 2017-10-04 17:48:54 UTC <brominski> Just bought a bag of that snack I tell myself I'll eat a few of and save the rest. Now I'm going to eat one after another 'till they're gone

915625071158398982 2017-10-04 17:10:03 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Awwwww.  Just cover the other eye with your hand when you intend to wink.  Also, scrunching up your face a bit, as winkers tend to do.

915621917922643968 2017-10-04 16:57:31 UTC <brominski> You keep turning pages until the end, then ask yourself what the hell that was even about.  #SummarizeBookInATweetpic.twitter.com/OWYdmI6sQO

915616149857079298 2017-10-04 16:34:36 UTC <brominski> Allegory that attempts to prove that boys will be lazy and foolish even if it kills them.  #SummarizeBookInATweet

907343508884914178 2017-09-11 20:42:04 UTC <brominski> @dallascowboys @colbywinters @DeanMSimmons I so remember that!  What a riot!
907343401401679872 2017-09-11 20:41:39 UTC <brominski> @keatsy2112 @colbywinters Don't be ridiculous.  Of course not.  When is sex EVER completely off the table?  pfffft...
907342669575331841 2017-09-11 20:38:44 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 It's like friends with benefits, only the benefit isn't sex, it's getting to release my albeit mainly impotent rage in a safe setting!
907342220398821376 2017-09-11 20:36:57 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 "living in their pools they soon forget about the sea..."
907342034951970817 2017-09-11 20:36:13 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters I'm not much of a Tweet-deleter, or I might just have removed that.  lol.
907341839581278208 2017-09-11 20:35:26 UTC <brominski> @dallascowboys @colbywinters @DeanMSimmons "The Catch"  Beautiful!
907341629362774021 2017-09-11 20:34:36 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 Totally legit.
907341342606491650 2017-09-11 20:33:28 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters What bugs me are insincere apologies.  I get your point, too.
907341047935717376 2017-09-11 20:32:18 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters We've run into each other somewhere, somehow... but probably not your uncle, huh?  He sure does look familiar (too) though.  Hmmm.
907340765344432133 2017-09-11 20:31:10 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 My first hotmail address was natural_science@hotmail lol
907340694901141506 2017-09-11 20:30:53 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 MINE TOO!  I have answered that way for a couple decades now.  It took a while to narrow it down.  Right on!!
907340341430419457 2017-09-11 20:29:29 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 The original Bucs mascot did look a bit dandy, didn't he?  lol!!!
907340175298179072 2017-09-11 20:28:50 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 I'm actually a total sweetheart.  Only an asshole when Jake is around.  It's a sort of service.
907339939091709952 2017-09-11 20:27:53 UTC <brominski> @dallascowboys @colbywinters It's not like I called Jerry Jones a pompous douchebag or anything...
907339754861146112 2017-09-11 20:27:09 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters I can cope.  Or flee Twitter.  Then you'll miss me, and won't YOU be sorry for that little gag!!  
907339523545341952 2017-09-11 20:26:14 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters UNACCEPTABLE!!  (also, Ruth's Chris, YUM!!!!!!!!! Sizzlin' on the plate!)
907339417538490368 2017-09-11 20:25:49 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters This is gonna sound strange, but your uncle looks familiar... you look a bit familiar, too.  You don't think... ???
907339235287605253 2017-09-11 20:25:05 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 If only Hemispheres and Permanent Waves were a double-album it would be my favorite.  I have a hard time deciding...
907339071323766790 2017-09-11 20:24:26 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 Right on! 
907338988457005056 2017-09-11 20:24:07 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 They are more pro than con, but they *do* also get used as toilets by indigent folks... truth in tourism.
907338744683999233 2017-09-11 20:23:08 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters It's an eighteenth century gang-banger.  A bit older than a ragamuffin.  More nefarious than the average fopdoodle.
907337937003704322 2017-09-11 20:19:56 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 That's the hardy gentleman!  It should be brutally frigid at Superbowl time...
907337727720423424 2017-09-11 20:19:06 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 Keats, I listened to Hemispheres on the way to work this morning... bug was planted last week by you.  What an album!
907337371938693120 2017-09-11 20:17:41 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Niiiiiiice... Steak at Manny's.  *drool*...
907337181995393024 2017-09-11 20:16:56 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Fuck the Cowboys.   All the Cowboys, always.  And their big blue star.  *spits* "America's Team" my ASS!
907336992974884864 2017-09-11 20:16:11 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @keatsy2112 It's a cool mascot, for one thing.  Who doesn't like ancient Scandinavian sailor rapists?
907336765584834560 2017-09-11 20:15:17 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters lol... did I ever say I wasn't an asshole?  No, I didn't!  You rapscallion... always trying to confuse the issue!!
907335175096463360 2017-09-11 20:08:57 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters I am a Packers fan, and STILL I root for the Vikings.  I have a solid rationale for this, btw.  Just saying, it CAN be done.
907334991675355137 2017-09-11 20:08:14 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters and there's THAT!  You gonna AirB&B your pad for thousands of bucks??!?
907334847663931392 2017-09-11 20:07:39 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters I have no doubt there's anything you couldn't wreck, you fiend.
907334345651834880 2017-09-11 20:05:40 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters It's a great city.  My first visit was in like... '79 or so.  Been living in the metro for over 20 years now.  Jake--don't wreck it.
907333932986888193 2017-09-11 20:04:01 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Thanks for playing, Jake.  With you in the Twitterverse, I feel occasionally, momentarily, relevant.
907332614821957632 2017-09-11 19:58:47 UTC <brominski> May I join you?  Oblivion sounds very inviting.
907332481065549824 2017-09-11 19:58:15 UTC <brominski> @Classic_picx That's a '77 Ford Maverick

907331880118353921 2017-09-11 19:55:52 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters That's Corporal Radar O'Reilly to you, and NO. I mean yes.  I mean correct.  (You may be correct, but you'll never be right, dammit!)
907330971485306884 2017-09-11 19:52:15 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters Are you kidding me right now?  Detroit's tallest building is 727'.   We have THREE bigger than that, and none named after M*A*S*H characters
907328923561873408 2017-09-11 19:44:07 UTC <brominski> 
907328672616603648 2017-09-11 19:43:07 UTC <brominski> @deedles420 @boomdingwinning Yes.  A golden one.  Probably.  Do the shuls come in gold?  I'm awful about fashion...
907327506616741888 2017-09-11 19:38:29 UTC <brominski> @deedles420 @boomdingwinning That makes you VERY special... I mean that in the most scientific way.
907327119025430528 2017-09-11 19:36:57 UTC <brominski> @deedles420 @boomdingwinning You get 402-k matching (it's like a 401-k, but one better). I've been on Twitter over ten years and still don't even have a reptile!

907315189573406720 2017-09-11 18:49:32 UTC <brominski> @warpwalkers @litzabronwyn It's funny... I *hate* the itching, but really don't mind the swelling.
907314500768059393 2017-09-11 18:46:48 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @warpwalkers Then rub it on your itchy butthole.
907314423865454593 2017-09-11 18:46:30 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn @warpwalkers No, no.  You grind the kelp down with the mortar and pestle you made from the volcanic rock, mix all three until it's smooth.
907312826078941184 2017-09-11 18:40:09 UTC <brominski> @heyjacqui_ lol--I take it you never saw "Help! It's the Hair Bear Bunch!"  They're just taking a spin on their invisible motorcycle!

907310331902472192 2017-09-11 18:30:14 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I'm like +12 on Diplomacy.  The Hp2 behavior styles assessment identified me as (primary/secondary) Persuader/Persuader.  lol!

907302454575992832 2017-09-11 17:58:56 UTC <brominski> @David_Leavitt At work.  I overheard a co-worker mention it, they saw an online headline.  Then we all brought up news sites... then a TV was brought in.
907301314866053122 2017-09-11 17:54:24 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind @andIwillpersist Yes, of course.  
907296648023478272 2017-09-11 17:35:52 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind @EileenCumming20 Oh, right.  Yes, that's true.  I forgot about that one!   lol...  (I really DO know a lot about history, it's my math that could use work...
907296357366583296 2017-09-11 17:34:43 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind @andIwillpersist You poor thing.  That's about the most ironic part of the whole thing.  The conservative Christians having NO problem with him... WHAT?!?!?
907292452658270208 2017-09-11 17:19:12 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind @andIwillpersist Oh, the feeling... the looks of disbelief and stammering on the parts of the media folks covering the election... *shiver*
907290730032455680 2017-09-11 17:12:21 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind @andIwillpersist Exactly.  It CAN happen here, and it IS happening.  HERE.  NOW.

907284352786223105 2017-09-11 16:47:00 UTC <brominski> @nsj1970 It's very tempting to co-opt one of my favorite lines from "Airplane!" ("Black.  Like my men.") But truly, I do like it straight-up!

907266094108430336 2017-09-11 15:34:27 UTC <brominski> @Amy_Siskind Well, apparently it's time.  Things were tranquil for 240 years.  How could we have been so arrogant as to assume it couldn't happen?
907265565315747841 2017-09-11 15:32:21 UTC <brominski> The media... it's the media that's doing this.  Damn, I'm glad we found the *real* culprit... https://twitter.com/thehill/status/907259208994885632
907265386164473858 2017-09-11 15:31:38 UTC <brominski> @thehill Is the media also trying to make you look like a burned out douchebag?
907264918847737856 2017-09-11 15:29:47 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire That sounds pretty damned hot... and not in the good way.
907264718980730880 2017-09-11 15:28:59 UTC <brominski> @Michellestyle18 I always say to them "Are you cashing the paycheck?"  (yes, of course)   "Then you're even."

905863242811154432 2017-09-07 18:40:01 UTC <brominski> @suckkubus @Jeffthegiraffe4 Are you getting exercise?  (Forgive my random questions, only wishing to be helpful!)
905862796176437248 2017-09-07 18:38:15 UTC <brominski> @Jeffthegiraffe4 Sounds like time.  I'm encouraged you're fine talking about it rather than suffering in silence!

905849856736026625 2017-09-07 17:46:50 UTC <brominski> hehe... that *is* pretty funny.  I'm guessing the context made it all the more riotous.

905820927690190848 2017-09-07 15:51:53 UTC <brominski> @SheRev Yeah, but looks aren't everything.

905819365018398721 2017-09-07 15:45:40 UTC <brominski> @SheRev I wonder how often I've done that... hehe.  (I do often actually like my tweets, but you know...)

905521066046566400 2017-09-06 20:00:20 UTC <brominski> @NBCNews @dynomite52 is very necessary now.  I just think this will be more harmful to the US than helpful.  Did these kids have a choice to come here?
905520800119353344 2017-09-06 19:59:17 UTC <brominski> @NBCNews @dynomite52 In our history, sometimes, we learn that some things that are illegal shouldn't be.  Alcohol, for instance.  I understand immigration reform
905520250749321216 2017-09-06 19:57:06 UTC <brominski> @Alysson Don't expect anything resembling reason from an anarchist.

905518912850321408 2017-09-06 19:51:47 UTC <brominski> @DaquineGameArmy @altf4gamers It's pretty typical for fantasy characters to have no surnames, in my experience.  I was going with that.

905498223149801472 2017-09-06 18:29:34 UTC <brominski> @Pootie_Tang666 It might be!  I'm not well-educated, so I'll have to stick with "maybe".

905488914227580929 2017-09-06 17:52:34 UTC <brominski> @mitchellbasel He does.  They call it "little man syndrome", but since he's quite tall, we know what must be small.  Trust me, it's a problem.

900020129593008128 2017-08-22 15:41:35 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @DeanMSimmons @Salvia_Purple Very nice! 
900019458428874753 2017-08-22 15:38:55 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @Salvia_Purple I did not!  Otherwise I would have responded to that earlier tweet of yours that I'd seen Ozzy, Rush AND Tesla and Def Leppard.  lol! 
900019205168394240 2017-08-22 15:37:54 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @DeanMSimmons @Salvia_Purple I'd like to visit Toronto.  (a) hometown of the Rush guys.  (b) it seems like a great city.  Pretty cosmopolitan, artsy and all that.
900018995914473474 2017-08-22 15:37:04 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @Salvia_Purple Def Leppard and Tesla played here in April.  History repeats itself!
900018679747936257 2017-08-22 15:35:49 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @Salvia_Purple lol! My band GRUDGINGLY did "talk dirty to me" because it was very in-demand.  Ladies at the bars wanted to hear it, but we seethed.  hehe..

900017164861804545 2017-08-22 15:29:48 UTC <brominski> @ImperialScum I believe it!  It's the only thing I've got that I'd consider a "bucket list" item, so far.

900016819947352066 2017-08-22 15:28:26 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Proof positive!
900016718235545602 2017-08-22 15:28:01 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @Salvia_Purple That's the one I'm thinking of, and it's been MONTHS not weeks.  Wow, this year has been going SO fast, lol.
900016557946003456 2017-08-22 15:27:23 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @Salvia_Purple Nope.  I played my last cover gig in 1992, I believe.  Now I only play with myself.    So to speak.    (now you're talking TRIBUTE bands!)

900012756388261892 2017-08-22 15:12:17 UTC <brominski> @ImperialScum Don't you whine to me!  I've never even *been* to GenCon, so... harumph!
900012576448409600 2017-08-22 15:11:34 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire Horses are so utilitarian it seems odd to suggest that as "pet", but she is a fine rider and loves horses, so I presume that's it.
900011270002417664 2017-08-22 15:06:22 UTC <brominski> @Salvia_Purple @ahappyhalfling It's making me nostalgic thinking about it!  We used 'comin atcha' as a set opener pretty often.  Ah... good times.

900006805006319618 2017-08-22 14:48:38 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @DeanMSimmons @Salvia_Purple We have determined that you and I are *very* close to the same age.  (graduated HS in 1987)  I expect there's plenty of non-coincidences! 
900005208549404672 2017-08-22 14:42:17 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling @DeanMSimmons @Salvia_Purple It is outstanding.  I will never tire of it.  I figure I was a *relatively* early-adopter of U2, as I started listening to them then.

899990986524381184 2017-08-22 13:45:46 UTC <brominski> @JenT0n1c My condolences.  Better to have conned and work than to have not conned at all... ;)
899989875591712772 2017-08-22 13:41:22 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling It was good!  Their fan base remains quite loyal. Ghost opened the show, and I was  impressed with how well they engaged the audience.

895308094686863362 2017-08-09 15:37:38 UTC <brominski> @CoolChris_007 @HeyItsChris412 I know.  And did we ever come even *close* to settling the question of where the beef is?
895307109486800896 2017-08-09 15:33:43 UTC <brominski> @Danzig303 @miserycake I want a piece of this action.  Give me a Star Wars haiku.  Too easy?  I'd take a request myself, too.  Don't want to step on your lead, tho
895305609398161408 2017-08-09 15:27:45 UTC <brominski> @Danzig303 @miserycake It never hurts to ensure clarity if it's something important.

895303724620492800 2017-08-09 15:20:16 UTC <brominski> @Danzig303 @miserycake lol... here I wasn't grading for accuracy.  Didn't expect you to post an invalid haiku!
895303599953149952 2017-08-09 15:19:46 UTC <brominski> @Danzig303 @miserycake I rather liked this one!
895303426078322688 2017-08-09 15:19:05 UTC <brominski> @JusGully Me too.  It only qualifies as a round flatbread.

895298753682427905 2017-08-09 15:00:31 UTC <brominski> @JusGully @miserycake That may be one of only a few things worth regretting, indeed.
895298060443688960 2017-08-09 14:57:46 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Awww. That is very sweet.  Awesome of her to do that.
895297778720661504 2017-08-09 14:56:38 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Ah jeez.
895297664962711553 2017-08-09 14:56:11 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x That's beautiful. It says something for being able to say goodbye, huh?
895297407881285632 2017-08-09 14:55:10 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x She wondered why he would always duck out to avoid being in photographs with her...
895296885556228096 2017-08-09 14:53:05 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x You've totally confused me.  lol... I can't imagine a circumstance where someone would be writing to a baby.  I tried!  hehe!
895296320361164800 2017-08-09 14:50:51 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Then it could also be someone just being shy, or "demure"?  Exclamation point doesn't fit well, and period might seem to stuffy.
895295749960978432 2017-08-09 14:48:35 UTC <brominski> @AP @oda_jennifer @sjellis_0220 Those are pretty good!  I especially like #tangry, hehe.

895295024858099712 2017-08-09 14:45:42 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x Or it could be an adverb, and they're just pausing to find the right word, e.g. "You're pretty.... um... AWSOME!!!"

894616966790557696 2017-08-07 17:51:20 UTC <brominski> @SheRev Me too. What mystifies me is that for all the red hats out there, there are very few people who actually BENEFIT from these doctrines.

894615541922619392 2017-08-07 17:45:41 UTC <brominski> After all, it's hard to produce substantial growth in earnings if you can't engage in a little fraud, am I right?https://twitter.com/CNN/status/894614142870540288

894610098500272129 2017-08-07 17:24:03 UTC <brominski> @SenateDems @SenateGOP @Hexen525 Yeah, that's the essential part of it the R's can't abide, isn't it?  *grumble*

894609215280623624 2017-08-07 17:20:32 UTC <brominski> @SheRev Cheers!!!!!  Wonderful news! 
894606579970043906 2017-08-07 17:10:04 UTC <brominski> @SenateDems @SenateGOP @Hexen525 and who knows what he really meant by "real reform".  It's so politicized it's pretty much that we're not really talking about health care.
894605350573420545 2017-08-07 17:05:11 UTC <brominski> Good.  You kids grow up and play nice.  You're there to SERVE the country.  I think many of you have forgotten that. @SenateGOP @SenateDemshttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/894602067691659264
894604909752061952 2017-08-07 17:03:26 UTC <brominski> @RivversDeep I'll buy that.  But is there any chance I can OVERestimate it?!?

893499491776577537 2017-08-04 15:50:53 UTC <brominski> @troyhunt @brettmorrison @Alysson I see what you did there.  Since actions tend to have SOME "reason", then the only presumable reason would be to harm the victims?
893499091686105089 2017-08-04 15:49:18 UTC <brominski> @troyhunt @brettmorrison @Alysson Oh, I know! The internet is the best thing to ever happen to foreign criminals!
893498898358181895 2017-08-04 15:48:32 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Yep--that factored in for sure.  Let's make it comic books... now the assessment of the comic writer/artists being "good" becomes subjective
893497966949945345 2017-08-04 15:44:50 UTC <brominski> @troyhunt @brettmorrison @Alysson Gotcha.  I have the same suspicion.  Could be what we call a Trojan Horse... not in the malware context, but some idea.
893497345874120704 2017-08-04 15:42:22 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff But isn't the value of say, collectible sports cards, based entirely on demand and nothing else?
893496845468655616 2017-08-04 15:40:22 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Yep!  Makes for fun smart-talk, too!
893496759409754112 2017-08-04 15:40:02 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff In my case, it's also going to require some Irish Whisky.
893496598407368705 2017-08-04 15:39:24 UTC <brominski> @troyhunt @brettmorrison @Alysson Unless I profit from the lie. That's called fraud, and that's a crime.
893495665891852288 2017-08-04 15:35:41 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Inventory costing, too... because the price of nails was less last year, my margin on one unit may be different depending on when I made it.
893495497742266370 2017-08-04 15:35:01 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Yup! lol. It all rolls up.  I'll put the PRICE of the nails into my cost of goods (which includes the nail-maker's labor Cost-of-goods).
893495135123771392 2017-08-04 15:33:35 UTC <brominski> @troyhunt @brettmorrison @Alysson True.  Thus the old adage "always read the fine print". Still, there is some onus on the writer of the contract to not deliberately mislead.
893494325165920257 2017-08-04 15:30:22 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff Hmm! Interesting question!  I'd say both.  The buyer's demand determines the price, and the value of the labor contributes to cost of goods.
893493857249308672 2017-08-04 15:28:30 UTC <brominski> @ChefEff and the thing that makes that cup of coffee so "special" is that it costs $500!

892776705584189441 2017-08-02 15:58:48 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn NPC interactions are by far my favorite part of RPGs.  Tactics/combat probably come last.  Fun, too, but that's not where I get the thrill!
892769553121464320 2017-08-02 15:30:22 UTC <brominski> @madbarrister ABSOLUTELY.
892769407633588224 2017-08-02 15:29:48 UTC <brominski> @EmilyGorcenski @donellacandra I agree, and nicely put. I have just come to the point where I think I've been kidding myself with my "can't happen here"--I'm scared.
892768568781262848 2017-08-02 15:26:28 UTC <brominski> @madbarrister That's fair, you brainless bastard.  (I kid the Ray.  I'm a kidder.)

892766691117199364 2017-08-02 15:19:00 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Personality and motivation.  Make sure the NPC has something THEY want, whether the PCs know it or not.  Again--it informs the narrative.
892766480688975874 2017-08-02 15:18:10 UTC <brominski> @EmilyGorcenski @donellacandra I know how *I* would answer.  The D party needs some REAL liberals.  Unapologetic died-in-the-wool bleeding heart left-wingers.

892479317799841792 2017-08-01 20:17:05 UTC <brominski> @aedwardslevy It also depends on whether current state is good or bad, because if anything is bad, ALWAYS blame the black president.  Always.

892381925997989889 2017-08-01 13:50:05 UTC <brominski> @JenT0n1c Oh, I'm sure! If I had a bucket list, that would be on it.

892125052862427138 2017-07-31 20:49:22 UTC <brominski> @RadicalGoats @samswey @jimwelch1 @P_Dubbin I think you're right about that, and you have a good point. We can think of better words. Nazi should be reserved for actual Nazis.
892123257171738624 2017-07-31 20:42:14 UTC <brominski> @sunsetndustries Have you told them what THEY can do with the xfinity speed test???
892122909799587840 2017-07-31 20:40:51 UTC <brominski> @RadicalGoats @samswey @jimwelch1 I am a law-abiding, patriotic American, and a liberal, and don't deserve to be called a Nazi.  That was my only point.  I wasn't very clear.
892122728182030338 2017-07-31 20:40:07 UTC <brominski> @RadicalGoats @samswey @jimwelch1 You saw some "snowflake" punks who wouldn't know a real problem if it bit them, acting out. The Nazi's murdered MILLIONS.

892118492870258690 2017-07-31 20:23:18 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel I'm not sure. I suppose maybe you do? I'm not much of a criminal so I haven't been there. Just stating there are multiple exemptions.
892116645543596032 2017-07-31 20:15:57 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I'm a bit conflicted as to what to do about this... lol
892116386826399744 2017-07-31 20:14:55 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel Capital gains ARE income, btw.
892115845291311106 2017-07-31 20:12:46 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel e.g. incarceration exemption. If I'm in prison, I don't have to pay the individual mandate penalty.
892115500347600898 2017-07-31 20:11:24 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel If I don't meet the income requirement, I don't have to have health insurance. I gave you the link. There are numerous exemptions.
892113863021408256 2017-07-31 20:04:54 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel Just mincing words, Mr. Fubar. If I want to have a job, I have to "buy" (pay into) SSI.  Likewise, I'll have to "buy" o-care. Same thing.
892111383868952576 2017-07-31 19:55:03 UTC <brominski> @CNN @swohguy1 @DeanMSimmons I couldn't even decode the message...

892110163926274050 2017-07-31 19:50:12 UTC <brominski> @ImEmmaBlack I like it too!  Looking good! 
892108904796180480 2017-07-31 19:45:12 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel Social Security.
892106702832771073 2017-07-31 19:36:27 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel I named a few, and you are splitting hairs. You don't have an original opinion, anonymous person. You parrot conservative talking points.
892106437803085826 2017-07-31 19:35:23 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel Therefore it is exactly the same as SSI.  If I don't earn any income, I don't have to pay for it.  Exactly the same.
892106322866581504 2017-07-31 19:34:56 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel (You don't have to pay "obamacare" If) "You dont have to file a tax return because your income does not meet the tax filing requirement."
892105938412425216 2017-07-31 19:33:24 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel We were talking about whether I have been FORCED to pay Medicare tax for 35 years.  I have.  Apples-apples.
892105649848496129 2017-07-31 19:32:16 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel I think you lost this one, anonymous.  https://www.healthcare.gov/2016-exemptions/
892104525389156353 2017-07-31 19:27:48 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel Fact is I'm been paying Medicare tax for 35 years and have never gotten a penny from Medicare. I did not realistically have a choice.
892103795941027840 2017-07-31 19:24:54 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel I think it's called using the tax law brilliantly.

892101805093638144 2017-07-31 19:16:59 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel #1 actually takes care of OBAMACARE, too, since I don't need to file a 1040 if I have ZERO income, and that's where they assess the penalty!
892101584649408512 2017-07-31 19:16:06 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel So to keep government out of my life, I just have to:  1. Never get a job  2. Never drive a car  This sounds awesome!
892095878185537540 2017-07-31 18:53:26 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel So, I'm also not "forced" to pay SSI, right?  As long as I never get a job...
892095593883078657 2017-07-31 18:52:18 UTC <brominski> @CNN @SadSadGayle @dhcammel No. But if I don't drive I can't get into an accident. I can't choose to avoid sickness that would require medical care.

890925465430609921 2017-07-28 13:22:38 UTC <brominski> @Mentalburnout It's a steadier mellow.  Agreed.  The other had a bit of a "I hit myself in the head with a hammer because it feels good when I stop" vibe.

884469534505275392 2017-07-10 17:49:04 UTC <brominski> @DeathByMage @EnneadGames Oh, those *fickle* gods!!   (nice reference!)
884469310038700032 2017-07-10 17:48:10 UTC <brominski> @ronin_sama @DeathByMage I presume "yes", starting at "why". If the "why" isn't good enough (i.e. something more too it than just being exotic), THEN it's "no".
884468364231442433 2017-07-10 17:44:25 UTC <brominski> @VisitSpudonka lol Ellen from Accounts Payable.  The way you throw random names in yours, Monte, is part of the secret sauce that makes them tasty!

884466079095033861 2017-07-10 17:35:20 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Sort of the Gray Jedi of her sect... not a direct parallel but you know.

884460629435797504 2017-07-10 17:13:41 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @rolistespod @DeathByMage @Zardozindustry lol right?
884460574884716544 2017-07-10 17:13:28 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @rolistespod @Zardozindustry @DeathByMage If it was me (as DM), rather than go for full damage, I'd have figured out some way they became trapped, and make it a long painful escape.
884460184977977344 2017-07-10 17:11:55 UTC <brominski> @DeathByMage Indeed. Arbitrary rules only for the sake of "because I said so" are unnecessary--but need to make sure all players are satisfied!
884458813901897730 2017-07-10 17:06:28 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @Zardozindustry lol... I see how it is.
884458682859356161 2017-07-10 17:05:57 UTC <brominski> @DeathByMage I'm a pretty laissez faire DM, so I tend to let the player group regulate itself democratically.  "Is this OP?" e.g. is a ? for the group.
884457014486814720 2017-07-10 16:59:19 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @Zardozindustry That is SAD!  The one with the fireball sounds like he/she might be a sociopath...
884452214147887104 2017-07-10 16:40:14 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @Zardozindustry Well, I'd say the party at-large is at least partially culpable then.  They could have intervened!  (maybe?)
884451824991952897 2017-07-10 16:38:42 UTC <brominski> @mifuyne Oh, I know better than to buy into this coincidence nonsense.   It's clearly a vast conspiracy!!  Lizard men involved, most likely!
884447506695933952 2017-07-10 16:21:32 UTC <brominski> @liqquidfire @Zardozindustry DM.  Isn't this what DM fiat is for?   (and I hope it's understood I'm beling lighthearted using the term asshole.  ;)

884440970103836672 2017-07-10 15:55:34 UTC <brominski> @xb0shi3x I can't help but presume there's a story in there somewhere...

884439799788187648 2017-07-10 15:50:55 UTC <brominski> @owillis It takes a special kind of talent to try to extract sense from the rantings of a lunatic.  Maybe he's not *quite* up to the task...

882944302539845632 2017-07-06 12:48:20 UTC <brominski> @KatieELN Yep. It's the lazy play. "looks" good for economy, quiets dissent (can't be un-patriotic while the country is at war, tsk, tsk) etc.
882941260725702657 2017-07-06 12:36:15 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Urban is my favorite... but I like lots of dodgy NPC's.  hehe.
882939461008596992 2017-07-06 12:29:06 UTC <brominski> @ahappyhalfling Wonderful!!!   Thanks for sharing!  
882937569746538496 2017-07-06 12:21:35 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn If it were me, I'd set that in the generic setting of Freeport, using the system of your preference. Great for something urban/gritty!

882688306647101441 2017-07-05 19:51:06 UTC <brominski> @thehill Too bad they are unable to provide AID in that regard.  Why do we call them aides?

882667127358058496 2017-07-05 18:26:56 UTC <brominski> @ZiziFothSi Nope.  But I can see how that could happen.
882666826311839745 2017-07-05 18:25:45 UTC <brominski> @thehill @jimtdavis So if I ask you to send me the personal info of your family members and you refuse, it means YOU are guilty of something?
882666451722805248 2017-07-05 18:24:15 UTC <brominski> @thehill Good.

882663881260322816 2017-07-05 18:14:03 UTC <brominski> @ScientistMel This is science I learned reading Lord of the Rings.  They may be capable of saying "no", but it takes a verrrrrrry lonnnnnng time. 
882663090847920133 2017-07-05 18:10:54 UTC <brominski> @leftyguitar1 It was pretty nice. Pair of humbuckers, decent trem. Very light. Not an expensive guitar.  I didn't have the exp. at the time to judge!

882659697744130048 2017-07-05 17:57:25 UTC <brominski> @leftyguitar1 It definitely suited my needs at the time (1985 or-so?).  I had my first Strat then!  (one of the Contemporary Japan-built ones...)

881893613424308224 2017-07-03 15:13:16 UTC <brominski> @ChaoticAnarachy @Cptsugarbear I hear you.  I'm not offended by it--adult content, no problem--The dialogue is just awkward.  It seems like the adult is getting forced.
881891538552467456 2017-07-03 15:05:02 UTC <brominski> @ChaoticAnarachy @Cptsugarbear The content isn't bad, it's the delivery--the shame of it, to me, is it tries too hard to be "Adult", unnecessarily. Doesn't add anything.

880776994207739904 2017-06-30 13:16:14 UTC <brominski> @DanRather @kushkandy95 It's a savvy take, I think.

880776197264871424 2017-06-30 13:13:04 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 Totally agree, kk.
880776008642777088 2017-06-30 13:12:19 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 Not normal for a president--a person we hope would model the behaviors of an exceptional American. Dignified. Ethical.  A person of vision.
880774637050875904 2017-06-30 13:06:52 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 It is normal for a bully.

880769416534908928 2017-06-30 12:46:07 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I wondered why she was so easy to play &  realized it was because *I* know her so well.  Stranger to the others, but comes across as whole.

880766833682460674 2017-06-30 12:35:51 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I figured this out recently--all these things about my character make them seem more real, though other players don't know the details.  
880766385437245444 2017-06-30 12:34:04 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Nah.  The James Bond movie collection says you only live twice, which provides two opportunities to die.  I think that's fair.
880765968963837952 2017-06-30 12:32:25 UTC <brominski> No!  (shame, shame!) My butt-hole.  All of my body parts have nicknames.  My uvula is Leonard.
880765037668859904 2017-06-30 12:28:43 UTC <brominski> That's funny.  My asshole's nickname is Bunny...
880764119930077185 2017-06-30 12:25:04 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn The backstory (motivations, history, attitudes) are there to inform the players role-play IN THE MOMENT. Deep isn't bad, just use it right.
880763672381009921 2017-06-30 12:23:17 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn It isn't for everyone else to be intimate with the character, it's for the PLAYER to be intimate with the character.
880763509310726146 2017-06-30 12:22:39 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I think a very well-developed backstory is good as long as the player doesn't feel compelled to SHARE it with everyone.
880763317417017348 2017-06-30 12:21:53 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn My opinion is "it depends"--on whether the player can throttle how much of that backstory they force into their narrative.

It's a paradigm thing, I guess.  If you never adopted the digital identity thing, I think it does seem like a different thing-fake

Just a different sort of connection.  But dropping the mask, for me, feels liberating.  Part of my personal journey, I guess!

It's different, sure.  Casual--

880478259024187392 2017-06-29 17:29:10 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I'm gonna poke the crowd on discord to see who knows... stop in if you get a chance.  Strahd is popular among the chatters.

879682039754235904 2017-06-27 12:45:16 UTC <brominski> @MalcolmNance @TheNatlInterest On one hand, the caps give a bit of a boy-scout vibe, but the fervent chants of "Death to America" counter that a bit.
879680927860916224 2017-06-27 12:40:51 UTC <brominski> @ScientistMel I'm glad you haven't let that pathetic behavior take you out of the game.  There's plenty who just respect you as a formidable human!

879440779659415553 2017-06-26 20:46:35 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump Whether or not Obama did this or that isn't the point.  The "he did it first" rationale only works for six year-olds.

879393465020428288 2017-06-26 17:38:35 UTC <brominski> @mitchellbasel The disappointing thing about this is that there are millions who still only believe what he says, and that everyone else is lying.

878276454240337920 2017-06-23 15:39:58 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Agree!  I'm anxious to see your rogue in action.  I know what's in that place... I had a bard in there...he created a makeshift firebomb.
878275648778842112 2017-06-23 15:36:46 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Oh, shit.   I forgot about the extra skill point for humans.  You still can have 9 given the favored class bonus. This is why I love Cypher!
878275096112095232 2017-06-23 15:34:35 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I know the DM... he probably wouldn't notice if you screwed it up.  lol.  Don't tell him I said that!!!!!   (It looks correct to me)
878274653751476225 2017-06-23 15:32:49 UTC <brominski> @Irish_Nurse AdageSongs is one of the best ht game themes I have seen.  Loved it!

878263972960534528 2017-06-23 14:50:23 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Oh, wait.  You used the favored class level 1 bonus for an extra skill point instead of a hit point, right?
878263818945613825 2017-06-23 14:49:46 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Everything else looks right to me!   I think a rogue is a good call, if I know the adventure this PC is for... hehe... 
878263590372888576 2017-06-23 14:48:51 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn I think you might have taken one too many skill points?  Rogue is 8 + Int mod (0).  But it could have come from elsewhere?

877553409641119744 2017-06-21 15:46:51 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire It's funny... I can't wrap my brain around the scene where Charlie in her cute dress and hair ribbon walks up to a table and says "fuck off"
877552657833107456 2017-06-21 15:43:52 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 I like knowing where I stand with someone.   A good principle is to not harbor negative assessments.  Air can be cleared without being mean!
877551544350232578 2017-06-21 15:39:26 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 Nope.  Just a different style.  I'm a beater-around-the-bush more than I'd like sometimes.  I appreciate directness in others.

877543705133158400 2017-06-21 15:08:17 UTC <brominski> @AynRandPaulRyan Exactly!  When they're trying to blame us for inciting violence (VA shooting) we are violent leftists... you get the drift.

875805077151338497 2017-06-16 19:59:36 UTC <brominski> @Monte1Wilson @InxsyS Fuck her.

875804083084554243 2017-06-16 19:55:39 UTC <brominski> @megynkelly @samanthastorey @HuffPost @MMinSC Right!  I guess this form of influence is a sort of "light censorship", but not from a single source?  I rather like how it worked for Bill.
875803687070912518 2017-06-16 19:54:05 UTC <brominski> @colbywinters @Chrztl @SkullsNCookies @geoffreyclark37 Thank you Charlie!  Now there's somebody who knows how to swing at a meatball pitch!!!!  
875803461136379904 2017-06-16 19:53:11 UTC <brominski> @SkullsNCookies It's made me think I could benefit from a bit more reflection on my own motivations, tendencies, etc.
875802699324940288 2017-06-16 19:50:09 UTC <brominski> @IMPL0RABLE You people are lousy hunters.  It's in the White House!!  THAT way!  
875802477618221057 2017-06-16 19:49:16 UTC <brominski> @Kris_Sacrebleu Let's put it WAY over the top!  A gay, middle-class, atheist, young, female of color with two vaginas.  I'm voting!
875801721422958592 2017-06-16 19:46:16 UTC <brominski> @DailyWaffle @AmyJRomine SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!!  No?  (I didn't read the article).   Oooh, I get it.  Product "placement" in dialogue?
875801105975971840 2017-06-16 19:43:49 UTC <brominski> @megynkelly @samanthastorey @HuffPost @MMinSC It's sensationalism, for sure.  The article puts advertisers in the role of a "Big Brother" who censors things, which may be a leap.

875795507540635649 2017-06-16 19:21:35 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS We've engineered the economy so that can happen.  Most of the right only fib about being religious.  Supply-side economics is their Jesus.
875794927988428801 2017-06-16 19:19:16 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump @AltUSPressSec @Monte1Wilson True.  The satisfying thud of King Louis XVI's head dropping of the guillotine into the basket was motivating.  That got a bit dark...

875792310981844993 2017-06-16 19:08:53 UTC <brominski> @jennyzigrino Break a leg!  Do they say that in comedy, or only in the "theater"?  I said "theater" with an exaggerated British accent, like THEE-uh-tuh.
875792033104965633 2017-06-16 19:07:46 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS Just like Sara Huckabee Sanders bears no responsibility for her bitchy resting face.  They were just born that way! c'mon...

875789471903608833 2017-06-16 18:57:36 UTC <brominski> @davidadams10 @co_rapunzel4 His mind doesn't register the notion of good and bad.  Only winning and losing.

875785126877310977 2017-06-16 18:40:20 UTC <brominski> @DeityFree It's fundamentally unfair to ask ANY American to risk their life for a strategy that isn't working!

875782386876862464 2017-06-16 18:29:26 UTC <brominski> Oh, I know!  I was right there with ya.  I just can't seem to avoid exploiting the opportunity to make tweets with the word ass in them.
875781777574559744 2017-06-16 18:27:01 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn It creeps me the hell out sometimes.  Google is good with ads, but tends to over-advertise things to me AFTER I bought them already.

875767591079424000 2017-06-16 17:30:39 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn When you finish NPSG, you'll be considered a graduate.  I call that the graduate game because it references the original (shhh) newbie solo.
875767305623531522 2017-06-16 17:29:31 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Well, I've had two launches of a game idea I came up with--it is a continuation of the newbie tower for a party.  :)

875744350076116993 2017-06-16 15:58:18 UTC <brominski> I've been seeing a lot of promoted ads for Hellmann's in my feed... also been eating quite a bit of mayonnaise recently... coincidence?

875743392155795457 2017-06-16 15:54:29 UTC <brominski> @washingtonpost @kushkandy95 If I can be charged with (unintentional) manslaughter for driving carelessly, is it fair then that I could be for intentionally coaxing. ???
875741518195286016 2017-06-16 15:47:03 UTC <brominski> @washingtonpost @kushkandy95 I've been debating myself on that same question.  I was really on the fence.  But again--compared to vehicle, seems she WANTED the result.
875740837979848704 2017-06-16 15:44:20 UTC <brominski> @washingtonpost @kushkandy95 Doesn't seem too far beyond adolescent cruelty I've seen... but anyway, same as killing someone in a car accident, seems fair comparison.

875056868850372609 2017-06-14 18:26:29 UTC <brominski> @eahlovesu13 @madbarrister Right on!  I have plenty of kindness, and I'm not afraid to use it.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

875054940842012673 2017-06-14 18:18:50 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire I'm ok with more gun regulation here.  I don't hunt, and am willing to play the odds I'll never be the victim of a murderous home invasion.
875054446358777856 2017-06-14 18:16:52 UTC <brominski> Despite how sickening some of the comments I'm seeing today are, I'm glad these people are on Twitter... can't shoot anybody with Twitter.
875053648711176192 2017-06-14 18:13:42 UTC <brominski> @FrostFrmFire Thanks, Charlie.  Can you gather up a little class and compassion and ship it over here?  We've become a nation lost in its own hate.
875053426048217094 2017-06-14 18:12:49 UTC <brominski> @sarahkendzior I need to wake up and realize the last year has been a dream.
875053176902352900 2017-06-14 18:11:49 UTC <brominski> @madbarrister @eahlovesu13 Damn, Ray.  That's really well-put.  You're a great mind disguised as a joker!

875039091343183872 2017-06-14 17:15:51 UTC <brominski> If he'd voted for Clinton, it still has NOTHING to do with the political philosophies of Democrats.  Let see who the NRA endorsed...

874990550264446976 2017-06-14 14:02:58 UTC <brominski> @KatieELN Totally get you.  My uncle/godfather was murdered by a stranger with a .38 to the head in 1980.  We was a wonderful man, 51 years old. Me 2.
874990004627484677 2017-06-14 14:00:48 UTC <brominski> @atheistfunkonme Stop it.  This has nothing to do with politics.  The shooter is sick.  People who do this are sick.  So is turning it into a political jab.

874989092894912516 2017-06-14 13:57:10 UTC <brominski> @KatieELN I think we agree, actually.  I'm not a gun nut.  Never owned one, probably never will, and I favor sensible gun control laws.

874988665109434368 2017-06-14 13:55:28 UTC <brominski> @KatieELN I think you're making a good case.  A "nutcase" shouldn't be able to easily procure deadly weapons in the interest of public safety.
874987681138257922 2017-06-14 13:51:34 UTC <brominski> @KatieELN I won't say I think access to guns makes a person more likely to commit a violent crime--but I do believe more accidental deaths result.
874986693102895108 2017-06-14 13:47:38 UTC <brominski> @claireducky Yes, fight or flight response is one of the few instincts humans have, right?

874983175386169344 2017-06-14 13:33:40 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn Ambition to me often feels like selfishness... resourcefulness I'd almost classify along with intelligence and imagination...

874970529756794881 2017-06-14 12:43:25 UTC <brominski> @litzabronwyn oooooooh.  Yeah, good question.  I've always presumed CHA to be more social than physical.  I wonder why a hideous character couldn't have..
874969669966409729 2017-06-14 12:40:00 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 There's a lot of hurt in our land.  Rage.  Fear.  Some people are just sick and couldn't get help.  Hoping for any good to come from tragedy

874274583830040576 2017-06-12 14:37:58 UTC <brominski> If there are tapes, and the WH doesn't release them, doesn't that make Donnie an OBSTRUCTIONIST?!?  (his new favorite word for Dems)https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/874272306406633473

873166696147816448 2017-06-09 13:15:37 UTC <brominski> @realDonaldTrump And you are a deranged man set on destroying this country.  You'll never be vindicated.  You'll never be respected.  You'll never be adored.

872865982355787777 2017-06-08 17:20:41 UTC <brominski> @ananavarro Hell yes.  The very same reason we laugh at jokes that aren't funny--when it's the boss telling them.

872475270233698305 2017-06-07 15:28:08 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS @JonJosephEvans Aw, bummer.  I was hoping to hurt it's feeling.  Bots don't have a feeling.
872474784017371136 2017-06-07 15:26:12 UTC <brominski> @MSNBC Hasn't King Trump I of Earth removed the word "appropriate" from the English language already?

872471054706462721 2017-06-07 15:11:23 UTC <brominski> @CNN No surprise, right?  Nobody is expecting any of these guys to confess to a crime!  We will NOT hear that Trump "directed" anything.
872468720299495424 2017-06-07 15:02:07 UTC <brominski> @tempuslibris That is so awesome.  My feed is full of venom this morning, what a nice change of tone!

872207854010220546 2017-06-06 21:45:31 UTC <brominski> @RPGCrossing @litzabronwyn It is simply playing an RPG, but in writing, and not real-time.  The forum provides utilities to facilitate the approach, e.g. a dice roller

867046639046885376 2017-05-23 15:56:42 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS @parashotz @JN31621 It's about divorce.  In 7-9 Jesus goes on to say it's adultery to divorce and then be with another woman, or to be with a divorced woman.

867032023025713152 2017-05-23 14:58:37 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS @parashotz @JN31621 My main point would be that I'll be a lot of these terrorists, be they Muslim or Christian, are not religious--it's an excuse to be violent.
867031781815595010 2017-05-23 14:57:40 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS @parashotz @JN31621 Having knowledge of the Christian bible I'd agree with the first point--however, Christians have also justified terrorism with God.
867029005077291008 2017-05-23 14:46:38 UTC <brominski> Remember when our politicians had some class?  I'm a bit surprised Trump's note didn't say "Nice wall, can I get your contractor's #?"https://twitter.com/USMC_DD/status/867028143537836032
867027635410530308 2017-05-23 14:41:11 UTC <brominski> @parashotz Jesus is the most understanding and forgiving persona ever.  (notwithstanding his disdain for the rich)  I was being facetious.
867027090801127424 2017-05-23 14:39:01 UTC <brominski> @tempuslibris Poppycock.  Also, that contracts the "Even when I'm not the rogue I'm the rogue" rule.  Calling foul!!
867026862157033473 2017-05-23 14:38:07 UTC <brominski> @TheMoreYouNerd I didn't expect that!  Wicked! Dude's always packing, too.  Bad-ASS indeed.  No better portrayal of Alfred in my opinion.
867025931260571648 2017-05-23 14:34:25 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 @ANGEL_NI Don't we all deserve respect?  Can we not disagree without denigrating?  Also, may I call you both "Dude"?  (I'm old and like emoji)

867023846485917700 2017-05-23 14:26:08 UTC <brominski> @InxsyS @parashotz @JN31621 Yeah...?  The old testament was totally brutal.  Are you just making the point that religion is dangerous to the global community?

867000069383389187 2017-05-23 12:51:39 UTC <brominski> @parashotz I don't disagree that there are people who would like to cause harm to Americans who might gain access to the country via refugee scenario.

862018768909869056 2017-05-09 18:57:44 UTC <brominski> @Slate Ms. Yates... can you state with certainty that M&M's do in fact melt in your mouth, but NOT in your hands?

862016287349911552 2017-05-09 18:47:53 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 True, some notable ff's were fm's--and Christians.  Christians who were wise enough to create a government that separates church and state.
862014523670237187 2017-05-09 18:40:52 UTC <brominski> @kushkandy95 Lots of it.  He's probably the best at adulterating.  People are saying his adultery was better than any other president.
862014205028950016 2017-05-09 18:39:36 UTC <brominski> @peterfhart There was that one time he sexually assaulted a highschool classmate, and didn't even make his buddies smell his fingers afterward.  Classy!

856529836856291328 2017-04-24 15:26:41 UTC <brominski> The history isn't going anywhere--it's still there.  I think it's less about erasing certain history--and more about not glorifying it.
