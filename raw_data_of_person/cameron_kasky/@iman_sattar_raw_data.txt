961379750366375936 2018-02-07 23:22:48 UTC <iman_sattar> Im actually not mad that MIST Dallas is at the end of April. There is no way Id be able to properly prepare 3 speeches for 2 sides of 7 issues in three weeks.
961306761344045057 2018-02-07 18:32:46 UTC <iman_sattar> And Im in a different region so its unlikely that it will be recognized

960211809369231360 2018-02-04 18:01:49 UTC <iman_sattar> Texas sucks because you go thinking okay if everything else is bad at least they have better weather but then u get there and its just as cold and theres no snow. Nobody should have to deal with cold weather without snow.

959313387053187072 2018-02-01 06:31:49 UTC <iman_sattar> He definitely showed his disappointment and disapproval and I think thats what we need. Not only in the makeup and cosmetics industry but everywhere. I think we need more influencers using their platforms to educate and inform without worrying about hate or backlash.
959310698529546241 2018-02-01 06:21:08 UTC <iman_sattar> He says Im using this once to give a review but I will not use it again until they expand their shade range.
959309491362660354 2018-02-01 06:16:20 UTC <iman_sattar> A lot of people dont have much respect for @jamescharles for various reasons, but I think after that video that changed. Hes a light skinned person and Im sure he couldve found an okay match out of the 13 light ones. He chose to speak out against the disregard of color.
959308725176516608 2018-02-01 06:13:17 UTC <iman_sattar> I think this is really important. Ik Im a bit late but @tartecosmeticss foundation line was really sad. 15 shades-2 were dark. After receiving backlash on a few pictures posted, they said they were working on more and wanted to get those out first.

956739496111898624 2018-01-25 04:04:05 UTC <iman_sattar> Moving sucks because u watch your friends have fun and hang out and do stuff and u want so bad to be happy for them but u cant bc u wish u could be there with them. Its just an endless cycle of being sad and then being mad at urself bc u should be happy for them, not sad.
