You were so creepy too.  I always thought I would love that if I were an actor.  Getting to be someone else. "sinister me" ...if you will
970803683142152192 2018-03-05 23:30:09 UTC <lesatheaman> I loved my job with Tower Records.  It is still so nostalgic just to think about that time. I had a bunch of piercings and wore crazy clothing and had the time of my life!!  It was almost like an era died when that store shut.  "RIP Russ Solomon"

946924658208763909 2017-12-29 02:03:26 UTC <lesatheaman> @JuddApatow @Brasilmagic She was thoroughly creeped out by him. She wrote about how uncomfortable his advances were and even spoke to her security about him.  Those things he said to Billy Bush He actually tried on the princess. She was having none of it.
946839581143400448 2017-12-29 20:25:22 UTC <lesatheaman> @CAA_Official @nickbailey317 Yeah gets me too. Especially whenthey are defending an "entertainer" out of the other side of their mouth. Our POTUS was and will forever be a reality star with acting dreams who only gets cameos of himself.

While you get to look at us in the next car, we're in the other one, in the back seat with our hands on the "oh shit" handles,  & headed off the bridge. This type of ignorance is down right scary.

946329333890560000 2017-12-28 10:37:49 UTC <lesatheaman> @JuddApatow @TitusNation It's a disgrace our F.B.I. has had any negativity towards their department.  You are 100% right that the vetting for a position there is extreme. It is a slap in the face of everyone in that department.
946328387252928513 2017-12-28 10:34:04 UTC <lesatheaman> @WhiteHouse It's all a "coup." I will not fall for it. It's exactly what you want.  The "fleecing of America" & we are all the sheep.
946138226502156290 2017-12-27 21:58:26 UTC <lesatheaman> @WhiteHouse Exactly how many people are directly working in the pipeline business? After completion,  the job is over, no? Those numbers seem "implausible." What seems "plausible" is the extreme wealth you and the 1% will see but not one average American will benefit from.

907648455115337728 2017-09-12 16:53:49 UTC <lesatheaman> @HuffPost @kimmythepooh @CBuhainBaello That was never the argument. The argument was be human is to "follow the rules." Being human does not mean that, or that they have empathy.
907426422947323904 2017-09-11 02:11:33 UTC <lesatheaman> @PaulProvenza The Green Room was awesome. I live in a closet so I just caught it now. Kudos!

907376332782280704 2017-09-11 22:52:30 UTC <lesatheaman> @HuffPost @kimmythepooh @CBuhainBaello To be human really takes "empathy" & not the ability to follow "the rules."
