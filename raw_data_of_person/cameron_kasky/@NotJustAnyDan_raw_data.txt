967510973362982914 2018-02-24 21:26:06 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @realDonaldTrump Must be they're pretty preoccupied, what with all the dead teenagers and all. Seems they want to focus on preventing that in the future.
967510641757052928 2018-02-24 21:24:47 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes Add bump stocks to list of modifications banned in this country, strengthen background checks, allow CDC to study gun violence, close loopholes for gun show/straw man sales. Those four tactics have bipartisan support, can get done now, and will be more effective than gun ban.
967510042785275904 2018-02-24 21:22:24 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes Ten year span before the ban: 137 deaths from 17 mass shootings Ten year span during the gun ban: 100 deaths from 16 mass shootings Difference in mass shootings and casualties was marginal, the only thing that changed was the tool hence the ban being repealed.
967504721094291457 2018-02-24 21:01:15 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes @caesar_ramirez Bump stocks should be banned because they undermine the full auto ban we already have in place, but bump stocks are not exclusively for AR-15s which is why banning the AR-15 won't address the issue of maniacs buying guns legally or otherwise.
967497705709764608 2018-02-24 20:33:22 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes @caesar_ramirez Still has to be modified to make it full auto, consumer level model of AR-15 stock is semi automatic. In terms of how dangerous a gun is in mass shooting, the difference between semi and full auto is much greater than difference in calibers, that's why we banned full auto
967496527127175169 2018-02-24 20:28:41 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Republicans have been redrawing the districts in most states of this country for years, dip shit. The only reason you're complaining now is because your party is going to lose power as a result of this change. You don't care about justice, you care about winning.
967493292777791488 2018-02-24 20:15:50 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes I'm not mansplaining anything, I just disagree with the premise of your argument because it is a flawed tactic that has been tried before and failed. If you don't want people to comment on your opinions, maybe don't post them on the internet. 
967491830765031426 2018-02-24 20:10:02 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes Semi auto is not "rapid fire", you're thinking of fully auto which we already have a ban on and the only thing that changed was the tool criminals used to commit their crimes.
967491232992759808 2018-02-24 20:07:39 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes Ban for semi automatic guns won't keep the guns out of the hands of criminals. Strengthen background checks, allow CDC to study gun violence, close straw man/Gun show sales loopholes. Focus on criminals, not the tools they use.
967490079198457861 2018-02-24 20:03:04 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes And then somebody comes in with an AK-47 or any of the 2000 other models of semi automatic rifles (most of which are rifles used for hunting) and does the same thing as the guy responsible for the Parkland shooting. Or they could use a hand gun which is also semi automatic.
967464022147813378 2018-02-24 18:19:32 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo @caesar_ramirez @YunngSavage_ @Plantflowes It's not semantics, it's a category of gun, the distinction is important especially in the context of creating legislation. An AR-15 is semi-automatic the same as most hunting rifles, you suggested putting a ban on fully-automatic guns which is already in place.

966314897675087872 2018-02-21 14:13:19 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @realDonaldTrump Had Obama said anything about Russia trying to interfere with our elections by supporting your campaign you would have cried "fake news" and "the system is rigged" which would have made matters worse. Why didn't you assist the investigation when you heard about this in 2016?
966281600618123264 2018-02-21 12:01:00 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @JenKirkman That does sound strange, if only there was somebody else from the Democratic party that happened to notice this as well, maybe they could write a book about it.....pic.twitter.com/c59KQBiODB
966281088325824512 2018-02-21 11:58:58 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @JenKirkman No shit, because Bernie was the only candidate who ran against Hilary in the Democratic primaries. Why do Hilary supporters feel she was entitled to take that nomination without anybody challenging her? How is that democracy?
966280494089424898 2018-02-21 11:56:37 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @JenKirkman It's like Donald saw something on TV he thought he could use to his advantage and repeated it for his followers on Twitter. Weird.... 
966279302168940544 2018-02-21 11:51:52 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @JenKirkman It's almost like Donald Trump saw an opportunity to divide the Dem voting base by assimilating Bernie's positions as his own even though his policies contradict everything Bernie stood for in his campaign. Do you think the Donald would lie to us to try and get more votes?

965947590725562370 2018-02-20 13:53:46 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @ChrisCuomo I disagree in context of putting legislation in place, if bill says to ban AR-15s that is a very specific gun, but if it says to ban semi-auto guns thats a ban on most modern guns on consumer level including hunting rifles and handguns focus should be strengthen background checks
965944797293891584 2018-02-20 13:42:40 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @realDonaldTrump Fact: Congress virtually unanimously voted to impose sanctions on Russia and you are yet to put those sanctions in place.

959855243155697664 2018-02-03 18:24:57 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> Hopefully the irony of @piersmorgan using free speech to defend homophobia while attacking somebody else's free speech by claiming homophobia is not lost on anybody...
959853597843435520 2018-02-03 18:18:25 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @piersmorgan you're not a homophobia victim, that image was calling you a brown nose for your @realDonaldTrump interview & to claim homophobia diminishes the significance of that very issue. How you don't understand that, having been so close to homophobia, I can't begin to know.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/905745473293705216

956976296034258947 2018-01-26 19:45:03 UTC <NotJustAnyDan> @RealSkipBayless But the @Patriots are better WITH Gronk. He draws defenders and forces them to double cover him so other guys like Cooks and Amendola get single coverage, that alone makes him the second most impactful player on the offense.
