888987320090640385 2017-07-22 05:01:08 UTC <bellabellsr> have you ever tweeted screenshots proving how deeply insecure you are while simultaneously outing yourself as an asshole? me neither !!

888433948551913472 2017-07-21 16:22:14 UTC <bellabellsr> my dad just ran into my room and shouted "SPICEY RESIGNED" so that's how today is going so far
888229896195002368 2017-07-20 02:51:24 UTC <bellabellsr> Good representation exists, we've seen it, so trust us when we say there isn't enough of it on TV and in movies.
888229700039880704 2017-07-20 02:50:37 UTC <bellabellsr> Those outside of the community usually respond with "at least its something." We're a large population, and deserve more than just something
888229197985890304 2017-07-20 02:48:37 UTC <bellabellsr> If we can't even recognize ourselves being represented, then press releases about the "groundbreaking character" are meaningless
888228672779440128 2017-07-20 02:46:32 UTC <bellabellsr> One panelist asked her gay son if he saw any gay characters in Beauty and the Beast, and he replied "I don't know, no one talked about it"
888228202887249922 2017-07-20 02:44:40 UTC <bellabellsr> Production companies get to pat themselves on the back for these characters, mainstream media posts articles like "First Gay Superhero WOW!"
888226848835903489 2017-07-20 02:39:17 UTC <bellabellsr> Underwritten characters and queercoded villains who are "implied" queer and have 10 seconds dedicated to this are not representation
888226448321814528 2017-07-20 02:37:42 UTC <bellabellsr> Queerbaity characters (Disney's LeFou/Power Ranger's Trini) aren't representation, no matter how many times straight people tell us they are
888225859286425601 2017-07-20 02:35:21 UTC <bellabellsr> After being in a panel about LGBTQ+ representation in movies and TV at SDCC, one message stood out: subtlety is not good enough.

803999295686873088 2016-11-30 16:29:04 UTC <bellabellsr> @LoveeAlina its adapted into Mexican culture because of the close ties to Spanish culture, so today it is also considered Mexican
