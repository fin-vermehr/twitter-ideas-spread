971956237901451264 2018-03-08 03:49:59 UTC <mloulind> @philzacheretti What happened inside and out at the Phoenix Theatre in North Versailles is disgraceful. I hope you plan on doing something about it. The manager should be fired immediately.
971877783088623617 2018-03-08 22:38:14 UTC <mloulind> @evansiegfried I'm nauseous because I'm so completely disgusted. I've  tried not to, but I hate them, every single one.

971480682307444736 2018-03-07 20:20:18 UTC <mloulind> @CNN Why did Cuomo just sit there and let Rafael give a campaign speech? I think CNN gives more time to Republicans and their supporters than Fox News.

939576390386618374 2017-12-09 19:24:02 UTC <mloulind> @POTUSThump @realDonaldTrump @BrettRSmith76 "Hailarous." Very sad.
939574740288724994 2017-12-09 19:17:29 UTC <mloulind> @POTUSThump @realDonaldTrump @BrettRSmith76 That literally makes no sense. It was a play on words, but you obviously didn't get it. Why am I not surprised?
939571876254441472 2017-12-09 19:06:06 UTC <mloulind> @POTUSThump @realDonaldTrump @BrettRSmith76 Don't you mean "The First BLUNDERED Days?"

938910990342684672 2017-12-07 23:19:58 UTC <mloulind> @KamalaHarris Shame on you. I was a fan until yesterday. Forcing Franken to resign was wrong, very, very wrong.
938904840851378176 2017-12-07 22:55:32 UTC <mloulind> @SenGillibrand @CNNPolitics Shame on you and everyone else who called for Franken's resignation. Your motives, in particular, are suspect. Gillibrand 2020? I don't think so.
938903078887133185 2017-12-07 22:48:32 UTC <mloulind> @SenFranken @crwaxlax ND here, devastated by this. It's a travesty.
938901149532459008 2017-12-07 22:40:52 UTC <mloulind> @Nysteveo2AOLcom I'm one of them. So disgusted by their actions. I have always been proud of my party. Not today.
938893491400212480 2017-12-07 22:10:26 UTC <mloulind> @HillaryClinton Always with you. Please keep standing up for children and the less fortunate. Thinking of what should have been brings tears to my eyes.
938821633904607234 2017-12-07 17:24:54 UTC <mloulind> @Mikel_Jollett Nice. And what makes you think I haven't? Well, you got your wish. Winning. BTW I'm severely disabled so getting off my "ass" is impossible.
938819135097704448 2017-12-07 17:14:58 UTC <mloulind> @Mikel_Jollett "I also think this is how we win." How's that working so far? We will win by keeping strong, intelligent voices in the Senate. This whole thing stinks to high heaven and you fell for it.
938817926546821120 2017-12-07 17:10:10 UTC <mloulind> @tiandavis @Mikel_Jollett So those of us who disagree with you don't have standards? BTW I've been a Democrat for 48 years.
938816981632987142 2017-12-07 17:06:25 UTC <mloulind> @Mikel_Jollett Very disappointed in your stance. As a 66yo woman who's been physically and mentally sexually harassed since I was 13, I understand false equivalency and this is the definition.
938815814001717248 2017-12-07 17:01:47 UTC <mloulind> @Mikel_Jollett @marmitetoasts @tati_vict Then why is Trump president?
938520961791471617 2017-12-06 21:30:08 UTC <mloulind> @erikforCO @Alyssa_Milano "We" are not asking him to resign. He apologized and asked for an investigation. "We" should wait for the results.
938517100020322305 2017-12-06 21:14:48 UTC <mloulind> @SenFranken Senator Franklin, PLEASE DON'T RESIGN!!!
938510938172542976 2017-12-06 20:50:19 UTC <mloulind> @lisamurkowski After your vote for the tax bill, I am not interested in anything you have to say. Party over Country - the GOP motto.
938508223317008387 2017-12-06 20:39:31 UTC <mloulind> @TomPerez No, you should resign.
938148602018443266 2017-12-05 20:50:31 UTC <mloulind> @joshtpm @RoboSchro @Potterchik @EvaChanda The GOP is all about fetuses in the womb, But once they're born, they change their tune.

937834064169570305 2017-12-04 00:00:39 UTC <mloulind> @ABCPolitics @mabynshingleton And yet, you're still talking about Bill Clinton. But I see from your other comments that you're not very (understatement) bright.
937768156088754177 2017-12-04 19:38:45 UTC <mloulind> @pastorrob2020 Moore's victims know what happened. What kind of "pastor" defends a pedophile? And why do fetuses' rights outweigh those of children?
936728506712674304 2017-12-01 22:47:34 UTC <mloulind> @bessbell Done.

935625034277834754 2017-11-28 21:42:45 UTC <mloulind> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of "weak and out of control".....
