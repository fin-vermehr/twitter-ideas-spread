971168691336503298 2018-03-06 23:40:34 UTC <cwessel16> @RealJamesWoods What is wrong with you. Youre an angry, unpopular guy. I get your depression. Why dont you sit in it yourself. Youre such a downer.
971168369457160192 2018-03-06 23:39:17 UTC <cwessel16> @RealJamesWoods Clearly you are uninformed. I wk in non profit world. ACA saves lives & continues to. Youre likely one of those ignorant people who thinks Obama care & ACA are different. Theyre the same. Admittedly there were problems w/ risk pools. GOP caused that on purpose.

As President,he let FBI & CIA know what he learned & let them do their jobs. This was so he wasnt seen as biased during an election. Hes a class act.

964952597668028416 2018-02-17 20:00:01 UTC <cwessel16> @gatorbites334 Research Benghazi.  Hillary was found to be INNOCENT. Why dont you read about it before you post.
964952356076081153 2018-02-17 19:59:04 UTC <cwessel16> @gatorbites334 Its about respect for all genders & nationality. So if your backing him & you know his positions, your just plain immoral.
964881673283424256 2018-02-17 15:18:12 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz That tax break ends in 4 years but the larger one for the BILLIONAIRES continues forever. Boy, they pulled the wool over your eyes. Thats exactly what they knew would wk with all of the uniformed.
964881142926266368 2018-02-17 15:16:05 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz OY. I give up. Youre clearly not strong enough to makes clear judgement without the men in your life.
964880838474326017 2018-02-17 15:14:53 UTC <cwessel16> @dbongino @RealPamelaAnne Youre killing our babies with guns. Over 50,000 gun deaths last year. You must be so proud. You may want to start praying for your souls now.
964880483380285441 2018-02-17 15:13:28 UTC <cwessel16> @gatorbites334 youre really uninformed. Theres proof of these allegations EVERYWHERE. Pick up a newspaper, read a book, look at data.

964879731249295360 2018-02-17 15:10:29 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz If hes so honest, why did he cheat on his wife twice, why did he lie about Russians & his campaign, why did he say he wouldnt touch Medicare & SS & now the cuts are coming.

964878831071977472 2018-02-17 15:06:54 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz Hes demolished the EPA, got rid of Pharmaceutical regulation which is making life saving meds unaffordable. Hes getting rid of regulations that protect you & me every day. Please pay closer attention. Youll never hear this on FOX. Read & keep reading. Bless you.
964878202756849664 2018-02-17 15:04:24 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz In his first week of office he killed civilians in an attack, it got no press. Thousands of kids couldnt afford their treatment because he let the CHIP childrens healthcare expire, he allowed Monsanto & DuPont to spray chemicals worse than roundup on our food
964877562643132416 2018-02-17 15:01:52 UTC <cwessel16> PS Ny Times documented all his lies and hell be arrested in the next year. You should all be so proud!!!!!!!!!

964858318790561794 2018-02-17 13:45:24 UTC <cwessel16> @LoruYaz I think perfect is unreasonable, because were all human. But, supporting an abuser, wife cheating, money laundering, liar like this President, is putting this country in GREAT danger. Hes costing lives in so many ways. Do the right thing. Stop backing the GOP.
