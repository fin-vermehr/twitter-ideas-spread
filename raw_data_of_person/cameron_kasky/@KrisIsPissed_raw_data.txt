Gonna be 5 years this year that I've known him. Almost 5 years since officially dating, with one 3 month break up years ago while his dad was dying and he went a little off the rails. I knew he'd come back. 
971027784284999680 2018-03-06 14:20:39 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @miltsdad @MagsBitchs @myworldjlt @smartassjek @Schmidt4Donnie Yeah... But I already knew I liked him just from written communication, so.... 
971026950872555522 2018-03-06 14:17:20 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @caelanga @Schmidt4Donnie To be fair to Carmen, it was in an effort to keep your urinary tract moving. You should be thanking her, Donnie.

He was engaged in college...but she died. Probably adds to the cold feet on his part.

I'm a gym machine and I love it.  Which is weird.  This is the first time I've ever liked going.  Hooray for new habits! Happy Saturday y'all!!
969911416412147714 2018-03-03 12:24:36 UTC <KrisIsPissed> We "swam" in the pool at the gym for an hour last night...well, ok, I kinda hung out in the hot tub/whirlpool which I'm not supposed to do (MS pts often have heat intolerance-worsens daily symptoms), then little miss went to her kids Zumba class and I walked 2.67m on treadmill.

967788079435145216 2018-02-25 15:47:13 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer It would be really good for me, too. Force me to get outside and walk. I didn't go to the gym today and believe it or not I kinda miss it hahaha. So different when your mindset is not *to lose weight,* and instead just to have something to do lol.
967787423144005632 2018-02-25 15:44:36 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer That's a pretty good idea. The puppy thing was really because I'm home all day, therefore have enough time to housebreak a pup, but you may be right. He's a softie who might go for a rescue doggy.

967786414875316224 2018-02-25 15:40:36 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer I am ready to murder Dave in his sleep if he doesn't relent on getting a dog. Can't have one at my parents house, Dave's got a house but refuses a puppy. Therefore... Murder. 
967785668825894912 2018-02-25 15:37:38 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer Getting so big!!!!
967530920759656448 2018-02-24 22:45:22 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump Hi gramps, just wanted to offer some advice, as always!! pic.twitter.com/zCTxEcenBo

967433751176376320 2018-02-24 16:19:14 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @riotwomennn Right, it's liberal by default, because the party of the NRA sure doesn't give af.
967432994825932800 2018-02-24 16:16:14 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @Mexicat_13 Hahahahaha I just looked up from sneezing to see this tweet. 
967424141874917377 2018-02-24 15:41:03 UTC <KrisIsPissed> It's Saturday morning, I don't have my kid this weekend, slept late , but... I'm at the gym. Of my own volition.   What is happening to me?!?!

967106493907656704 2018-02-23 18:38:50 UTC <KrisIsPissed> The more I hear this piece of shit ridiculing Senator McCain, and those conservative douchebags booing, the angrier I get. This man, regardless of politics, is likely at the end of a service FILLED life. He's given more to this country than the Trumps, collectively, have TAKEN.
967098510389731328 2018-02-23 18:07:07 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer Omg, girl!! I was gonna comment and say the same thing!! pic.twitter.com/WcnOOy1DLp

967068009423622146 2018-02-23 16:05:55 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump just told the world that we don't want people who are mentally ill to have any kind of weaponry.   John Kelly, @IvankaTrump, Mad Dog Mattis, you know what that means - take the nuclear football from his tiny,  tiny hands. #cpac
967066526586212352 2018-02-23 16:00:01 UTC <KrisIsPissed> A bot just shared one of my tweets and went all pro Trump, and then a pro Trump bot retweeted her retweet.

967062803772256257 2018-02-23 15:45:14 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer The treadmill I snag has a TV actually connected to it so I can pick whatever I want, I'm just so glued to CNN it's hard to get into anything else hahaha. Laaaaaawd. I'm thinking about maybe trying the bike... Not the real outside one but the one at the gym hahahahaha. 
967061453214756864 2018-02-23 15:39:52 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer Yeah, I've been doing 30mins to an hour, trying for every day but Rachey's vacation kind of halted that lol. I just watch CNN when I'm there so it's not as good at clearing my head hahahahaha. Maybe I'll have to make a Foo Fighters playlist 
967060610176421889 2018-02-23 15:36:31 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer I really think I'm gonna have to unplug for a bit. He makes me so angry I can't even see straight.
967060059275649024 2018-02-23 15:34:19 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer God, I hope so.
967059177117020161 2018-02-23 15:30:49 UTC <KrisIsPissed> He just got a room full of Republicans to boo senator John McCain, who is fighting for his life.   Way to go assholes. You own this.

967056456041353217 2018-02-23 15:20:00 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @lovablemarketer Yep.
967045833614069760 2018-02-23 14:37:48 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @Bipolaronfire They live in a lake in the woods. Who knows. We don't visit them often hahahahaha. That's part of why I was so freaked out. Of all family members to trust with a gun in my kid's presence...they're not high on the list, lol.
967045319862210560 2018-02-23 14:35:45 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @artkincell This is insanity. Is this the beginning of the end, for real? Seems closer to it than any other time I can remember.
967045112562843648 2018-02-23 14:34:56 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @Bipolaronfire Rach and I went to visit my aunt and uncle once. I remember my uncle going to his room because he had forgotten to put his gun back in the safe and it was on his bedside table. Freaked me the eff out. Even being NEAR one. 
967044431164698624 2018-02-23 14:32:13 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Hahahahaha @Schmidt4Donnie ur girl is draaaaaagging Pence. https://twitter.com/SRuhle/status/967041806075604992
967044104440991744 2018-02-23 14:30:55 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @Bipolaronfire I've never even shot a gun, actually never even HELD one... I can't even imagine being in that scary situation and pulling out an AR15. 
967043235913846787 2018-02-23 14:27:28 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @Bipolaronfire I mean in my mind I wouldn't even be trying to kill an attacker, I'd be focused on injuring them enough to get myself to safety. I don't want murder on my conscience. If it's necessary, ok. But absolute last resort in my head.
967039900490092544 2018-02-23 14:14:13 UTC <KrisIsPissed> .... Aaaaand we're off. https://twitter.com/AP/status/967039174116339712
967038110293987328 2018-02-23 14:07:06 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @BillKristol He could SAY whatever he wants. It's what he DOES too.
967037310507286533 2018-02-23 14:03:56 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @BillKristol Yes, it is.
967033137833365505 2018-02-23 13:47:21 UTC <KrisIsPissed> The thought of needing, or SHOOTING, a fucking AR15 is completely foreign to me. Seems altogether unnecessary.  Is this just my thinking because I'm gun - ignorant? Or is this a valid point of view?
967033135421689862 2018-02-23 13:47:20 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I didn't grow up in a household with guns. My parents have never owned one or even shot one, to my knowledge.   If I was considering a gun for personal protection, it wouldn't even cross my mind to buy anything other than a small handgun. The kind with 5 bullets in the round.
967029093475774464 2018-02-23 13:31:17 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @NewDay @JohnBerman @ChrisCuomo @JodyDelBrocco I hadn't even noticed! C. Mo gets Fridays off?! Lucky.

966749270845067264 2018-02-22 18:59:22 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Oh cool, let's just run back to 50yrs ago and steal their idea.  #dumdotarddonniehttps://twitter.com/thehill/status/966748188043554817

She's been so genuine, protective, and compassionate. I know she's boycotted twitter but please let her know how impressed we are. 
966657114600083456 2018-02-22 12:53:10 UTC <KrisIsPissed> If Trump makes teachers the "carriers of the school firearms," get ready for the Great Teacher Shortage. No way in hell would I work as a teacher if that was expected of me.

966303171235676162 2018-02-21 13:26:43 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I hope @realDonaldTrump's TREMENDOUS faith (really, nobody has more faith than he does, folks, believe me) can carry the evangelicals thru their time of loss. #BillyGraham
966298290294874112 2018-02-21 13:07:20 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @ChrisCuomo @CNN @JodyDelBrocco She couldn't even grasp what  @DrewGriffinCNN was SAYING to her... 
966296018001321984 2018-02-21 12:58:18 UTC <KrisIsPissed> This woman on @CNN insisting she had  "nothing to do with the Russians" even tho she shared content created by the Russians... Is batshit effing crazy and what I imagine the mindset of most Trumpers to be.  @ChrisCuomo
966294841138270208 2018-02-21 12:53:37 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @LauraLoomer @smartassjek It didn't say if she was suspended or anything, her acct is still up so I doubt it, I try to report here every time I see her hahahahaha
966294199099445248 2018-02-21 12:51:04 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @smartassjek!! I reported @LauraLoomer for something, just got the report back, they found her in violation of Twitter rules.  
966239756186243072 2018-02-21 09:14:44 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @ShereeIsHopeful I'm sure RBG is just chomping at the bit to hear THIS case. 
966134155598880769 2018-02-20 02:15:07 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump 26% of the voting public, buddy. The public sure IS wise.   Know who else is wise?   Robert Mueller.

966004298311233538 2018-02-20 17:39:06 UTC <KrisIsPissed> The first time we met Dave's mom, he told me afterwards she said to him, "David, are you sure you don't have something to tell me? Are you really Rachel's father??" because they kinda look alike, he was like mom... She's FOUR. Would I keep that a secret so long?!

965974406534172672 2018-02-20 15:40:20 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @FoxNews @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Oh for Christ's sake. You paid the women off so the stories wouldn't come out. Anyone who is not completely mentally defective can see that clearly. Your lawyer has already admitted it. Just STOP.
965968160989081601 2018-02-20 15:15:31 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @misslexxmarie anyone who references Parks and Rec in their display name is someone I wanna follow! 
965962999746957312 2018-02-20 14:55:00 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @OjPats4 Agreed... But I wouldn't mind if he favorably admired his own handiwork on this one.

965954691346718721 2018-02-20 14:21:59 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @OjPats4 When your subject is as cool as Barry is, it's hard ultimately to mess it up. 
965954160075198465 2018-02-20 14:19:52 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I already blamed Obama for teaching our kids kindness, acceptance and integrity.  The bastard. https://twitter.com/mibella1967/status/965953046445469696
965953791358128128 2018-02-20 14:18:25 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell I was his whipping girl for ten years.  He can't quite grasp that that's his wife's job now.  
965953348464775168 2018-02-20 14:16:39 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump Shuuuuuuuut. The.  Fuuuuuuuuuuck. Uuuuuuup.

965951123633917952 2018-02-20 14:07:49 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Funny how I was up basically all night worried about Rachey at her sleepover, yet  #FatherOfTheYear didn't even remember she had a sleepover and consequently slept fine... Yet according to him I'm a TERRIBLE mother. The worst in the world. Y'all can decide that one for me. 
965949689840459778 2018-02-20 14:02:07 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump It MUST be interesting to read a whole book about the faith you don't have.
965948468777889797 2018-02-20 13:57:16 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump Obama passed sanctions.  Congress passed sanctions under your tenure too but you refuse to impose them.  So tell us again how you're tougher than he was.  You're a pathetic pos. Prison is too good for you.
965947937049202688 2018-02-20 13:55:09 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell I think i slept for two hours last night which, according to Alora's mom, is about how long those two cuties slept too. 
965947118983708672 2018-02-20 13:51:54 UTC <KrisIsPissed> She made it! She stayed the whole night at her friends house! Alora's mom said she woke up crying for me at 230am and was gonna call me but decided she could be brave.  I'm gonna pick her up before lunch.   Soooooo proud of my big girl!!!
965755558832812032 2018-02-19 01:10:42 UTC <KrisIsPissed> This child is on her #FirstSleepover.   My baby!! I'm loaded up on caffeine in case she needs mommy in the middle of the night...

965633446071726086 2018-02-19 17:05:28 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Funny, @FoxNews didn't mention ANYWHERE in this article that @ChrisCuomo used to work for them, but they sure enjoyed calling him Anti Trump. https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/964878137912905728
965612803645198336 2018-02-19 15:43:27 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I used to say this to Rachel's father all the time - if everyone in your life is an asshole, everyone isn't the problem. YOU'RE the asshole. https://twitter.com/jdice03/status/965610459184295936

965594625800056836 2018-02-19 14:31:13 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Ugh. I hate tweets like this. You can't run on just an anti Trump platform. You have to show how you will fix his fuck ups, too.https://twitter.com/AdamSchiffCA/status/965245261093261312
965583346301620224 2018-02-19 13:46:24 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell If my educated, financially comfortable white parents feel "left out," or "forgotten," the ONLY THING that makes sense is that it's REALLY about fear of someone else getting "benefits" or whatever that they feel THEY deserve. Which makes me want to puke.
965581614855094272 2018-02-19 13:39:31 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell And they're so VICIOUS about it. It's unbelievable to me. My parents did not bring me up to be racist. So wtf happened to them ffs?! I'm the most moral person ever, so that's a deal breaker for me. He doesn't pass my moral sniff test. Clearly they don't, either. 
965579780191145985 2018-02-19 13:32:13 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell Omg I got out just in time. Parents started bitching about how their taxes will still be paying to look for Russian collusion until they're dead. My mom is politically dumb so I had to seriously grit my teeth. 
965579270427947008 2018-02-19 13:30:12 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell Hahahahaha oh man.  I really wanna go to Dave's for the night but he's a half hour away and like I said I'm 95% sure I will be picking her up tonight, so.. 
965578815983489024 2018-02-19 13:28:23 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell I was kinda pissed that my girl Ariel didn't show up tho. 
965578461652946944 2018-02-19 13:26:59 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @IsaacRockwell It was UNBELIEVABLY cute, the kids got to stand in front of the stage like it was a mosh pit. 
965576450530336768 2018-02-19 13:19:00 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @acoad1111 My grandma lives in Kansas! Holton. Not much there. Hahahahaha. I'm sure your daughter is having the time of her life, but good job with the tag teaming!! I'm sure that makes her feel extra safe. 
965575794666999808 2018-02-19 13:16:23 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Rachey met her idols yesterday.  Even turned into a groupie and touched Elsa, Anna and Belle's hands! pic.twitter.com/rYmHUcaN5y

965573921008472065 2018-02-19 13:08:56 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @acoad1111 It's tonight, I'm dropping her off after lunch.  I'm not gonna make it!! Hahaha. Funny how sometimes ALL I WANT is a break but omg that thought of her being physically away from me makes me want to cry. 
965573409517264896 2018-02-19 13:06:54 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @LJonasdotter *absolutely correct tweet. 
965573291682430981 2018-02-19 13:06:26 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @LJonasdotter Yesterday I saw a new ad for the same drug, same couple - except this time the husband was the one needing chemo. Those poor, unlucky fictitious people, amirite?! 
965573003999399936 2018-02-19 13:05:18 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @LJonasdotter HAHAHAHAHA OMG I have something to say about commercials and I'm gonna tag on the end of your animosity correct tweet - there's a commercial for Neulasta, a chemo med you can take at home. I started seeing the ad years ago, wife was sick and adoring husband caring for her.
965572520781983745 2018-02-19 13:03:23 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @issyelliot It's better than Stable Genius at least. 
965572165356670976 2018-02-19 13:01:58 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @acoad1111 She's just 6!! If I didn't know this family well, and have known them even before the kids were BORN, this would not be happening. 
965571440677355521 2018-02-19 12:59:05 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @issyelliot Alyssa my god! You are a brainy goddess!!  Great job!
965570715939475457 2018-02-19 12:56:12 UTC <KrisIsPissed> But still. I feel like I'm sending her away to WAR, ffs. I have a nervous feeling in my belly and keep getting misty eyed.  She's just a baby!! I wouldn't have let her go because I feel like she's too young but i know the family well and the kids were BEGGING.   Siiiiiiiiigh. 
965570713859035138 2018-02-19 12:56:12 UTC <KrisIsPissed> This child is going on her first sleepover tonight.   Well. She's GOING. Do I think she'll make it overnight?  The kid follows me when I leave a ROOM. So I'm quite confident that I will be picking her up before the night is over. 
965496117315231745 2018-02-18 07:59:47 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @KatieELN Hahaha I know the feeling, I just saw a tweet that literally had me making fists and clenching my jaw.  Can't even remember the tweet now but oh man, lol. It's exhausting being this enraged 24/7! 
965495437619793923 2018-02-18 07:57:05 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @KatieELN Hahahahaha we're so conditioned to be gaslit that we do it to ourselves. 
965494835741413376 2018-02-18 07:54:41 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @KatieELN It does feel like the SJWs are attacking each other with the subtweeting going on tho!
965493953972797440 2018-02-18 07:51:11 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @KatieELN I have no insight there except my gut says she's harmless. Mensch, tho... 
965493141561315330 2018-02-18 07:47:57 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @KatieELN I think we'd be hard pressed to find someone who HASN'T been duped at this point, girl.

965252294408331264 2018-02-18 15:50:55 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @MotherFer I am not someone who blindly believes EVERYTHING. Fake news got me that time, yep. But the MAGA hat he was wearing isn't fake and it wasn't a coincidence, imo.

965239290698633216 2018-02-18 14:59:14 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @realDonaldTrump Here we go again! The man who's supposed to protect us from them doesn't even have the intelligence or discernment to spot bots or trolls, and just retweets them because they're niiiiiiiiiice to him.  Sad!

964504529139109888 2018-02-16 14:19:34 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I should add Foo Fighters on SPOTIFY, because if i had Dave Grohl in my clutches I wouldn't be going to no Neuro appt rn.  #CelebritySexList #EntriesOneThruFive 
964503522325737472 2018-02-16 14:15:33 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @PeasBeStill Absolutely!! 
964503334265741312 2018-02-16 14:14:49 UTC <KrisIsPissed> I'm literally an hour and a half early for my Neuro appt because they have a new building and parking SUCKS, but at least I have Twitter, Foo Fighters, and weed  to hang out with. 
964502485703544834 2018-02-16 14:11:26 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @kimleonard I'm afraid to stop because I know myself and going back after a break will do me in hahaha. Luckily it's such a light work out that I don't need a break from it. 
964501726765240320 2018-02-16 14:08:25 UTC <KrisIsPissed> So, I'm skipping the gym this morning.  Because there's a Zumba for kids class at 5:30 that I'm gonna bring Rachel to, and I'll do my workout then.  #5DaysInARow

964501063821938689 2018-02-16 14:05:47 UTC <KrisIsPissed> Hahahahaha y'all think maybe #suckabee only has an interim security clearance because her brother tortures dogs?!?!
964486235480784896 2018-02-16 13:06:52 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @OjPats4 Who did, Justin? Dudes are lame. Hahahahaha.
964484618887016449 2018-02-16 13:00:27 UTC <KrisIsPissed> @OjPats4 Is she really? Gross. Brad or Justin...I'd pick Justin every time.
964479283480711169 2018-02-16 12:39:14 UTC <KrisIsPissed> What grown up humans think it's ok to tell a SIX YEAR OLD that haunted houses and ghosts are real? I calmed her down after she spent the weekend there, convinced her they were teasing, but she had visitation with him last night and the Wicked Stepmother got her going again. Ffs.
