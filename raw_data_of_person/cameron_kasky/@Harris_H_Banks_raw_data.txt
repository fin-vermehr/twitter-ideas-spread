897465887812460544 2017-08-15 14:31:56 UTC <Harris_H_Banks> @PhillyD I think all sick people should be helped. I don't and would never excuse these crimes, but I believe they deserve a chance to be changed
897464210875133952 2017-08-15 14:25:16 UTC <Harris_H_Banks> @PhillyD Though nothing can excuse a crime like this, I believe in imprisonment and rehabilitation before execution. Even in cases such as this.
