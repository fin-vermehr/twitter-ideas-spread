970874632730374144 2018-03-05 04:12:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MasterGiwaffe YES!  we learned a lot today about Mueller.  Loved it.
970869507483824128 2018-03-05 03:51:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Sam Nunberg" is only the beginning.  Unfortunately for him, he unravelled on CNN and MSNBC.  Many more will unravel...just not in public.
970868991722860545 2018-03-05 03:49:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> soon we're going to see Nunes going full Nun(es)berg on multiple channels.  Stay tuned.https://twitter.com/Arctic__char/status/970853077375893504
970864656980983808 2018-03-05 03:32:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I'd bet a lot of money that "Sam Nunberg" wouldn't have melted down if his lawyer answered his call(s) today.  Getting legal advice from TV panelists isn't a good idea but it made him come to his senses...as did sobering up.
970862242697637888 2018-03-05 03:22:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PressSec @SiouxFan1986 the only thing strong about Sarah Sanders is her propensity for lying.

970697539618877441 2018-03-05 16:28:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @bethanyshondark imagine a few Americans got hurt playing Lawn Darts cuz they had metal tips so USA banned all Lawn Darts.  They did.  Imagine a few kids choked on the Kinder Surprises so they banned them.  They did.  Imagine weapons that spray 400-600 bullets a minute...
970694199828889600 2018-03-05 16:15:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NRATV the truth is that NRA lied to America for 8 years telling them that Obama would take their guns away.  They continue to lie.  When will the duped Americans wake the hell up?
970689595170959360 2018-03-05 15:56:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump in your panic, you forgot that NOBODY knew of the investigation until AFTER the election so it wasn't to help Hillary.  It was because your campaign people were meeting with Russians...and LIED about it.

962368138481319941 2018-02-10 16:50:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> critical thought isn't your strong suit.  You still haven't answered how Obama made all these people LIE on FARA forms, LIE under oath, LIE about contact with Russians, and LIE to the FBI.  Obama is in your head.  Bigly.

962366506674737152 2018-02-10 16:43:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Randywjohnson2 I know full well the fantastical tale they spun about Obama.    All they had to do was call the FBI.  And NOT lie on their forms.  And NOT lie about their contact with Russians.  And NOT lie under oath.  They have nothing left except to make YOU believe it's Obama's fault.
962364238047035392 2018-02-10 16:34:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Randywjohnson2 OMFG tell America how Obama made Flynn, Sessions, Kushner, Manafort and others lie on their FARA forms.  Tell us how he made Sessions lie under oath twice. We'll wait.
962360946889867264 2018-02-10 16:21:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Randywjohnson2 Oh, so Obama made Flynn, Sessions, Kushner & Manafort lie on their FARA forms. And he made Sessions lie under oath.  And made Flynn and George P plead guilty to lying to FBI.  And made Jr. attend adoptions meeting and talk to WL.

961374082536169472 2018-02-07 23:00:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CheriJacobus everyone with half a brain knows in the real world that subordinates routinely write speaking notes and prepare their superiors for important meetings.  Fox is telling the deluded base that this is a crime.

In a world of outrageousness of reality TV they have 24/7 lunacy live from the WH.  With each and every tweet to every interview/rally he says the most asinine things ANYONE could say, let alone a president (so-called).
961304980098400256 2018-02-07 18:25:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaddowBlog @trumpATeam @Squeezer1970 it takes a special kind of stupid to believe that a woman that spent her entire adult life helping kids get education, HC and benefits would rape kids then chop them up.  My beloved brother is one of those believers.  SMFH.
961283811416842241 2018-02-07 17:01:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Al_Berry its so fantastical one needs to blaze a large one to wrap their head around it.
961283049857073152 2018-02-07 16:58:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Al_Berry I don't believe that in 2013 Obama knew trump was going to get elected so they concocted a court case that included Carter Page to cavort with Russians so 5 years later they could take trump down for collusion with Putin.

961276763480342528 2018-02-07 16:33:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DonaldJTrumpJr OMG because subordinates don't ever prepare talking points for their superiors when they're going into an important meeting.  FFS do any of these fools know how government or businesses work?
961276270939009024 2018-02-07 16:31:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @Al_Berry or he was just an American citizen caught up in a situation with 3 Russian spies that thought he could be useful to them.  He didn't get charged because he didn't do anything wrong.
961272906033475584 2018-02-07 16:18:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @allahpundit @pwnallthethings @Melba_Toast so who implanted Carter Page into the trump campaign?  ROFL.  You did know he was Male1 in a 2013 court filing for cavorting with 3 GRU spies, right?

961100164747485190 2018-02-06 04:51:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaddowBlog @trumpATeam @Squeezer1970 Psych 101 - when they have no other valid argument they make personal attacks.  I don't expect anything more from them.  Look at their baby-man "leader".  He spends his life whining and seeking validation at every turn.
961034693633236992 2018-02-06 00:31:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @krassenstein do we know for sure who hired Carter Page to work for trump?
961029139598753792 2018-02-06 00:09:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaddowBlog @trumpATeam @Squeezer1970 That was a very interesting article.  trump's constant ranting about "fake news" just because he doesn't like the message is so dangerous.  His kool-aid drinkers repeat whatever he says.
960921051201880064 2018-02-06 17:00:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RepSwalwell @SteveWulfeck @APLEVES2 I stand corrected.  he removed himself from the investigation (SMFH at that) with the full support of Ryan.

960907507022553088 2018-02-06 16:06:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @drawandstrike how did the FBI force trump to hire Carter Page?  Asking for millions of friends?
960904224933527554 2018-02-06 15:53:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoshuaRozenberg sad.  Bigly sad.  Believe me.

And George P?  why did Sessions, Manafort, Flynn, Kushner lie on their FARA forms?  Why did Ryan remove Nunes?  Why did Sessions LIE under oath twice?  Why did Nunes lie on memo?

960701503898927104 2018-02-05 02:27:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid Given that one law firm used to insist upon two lawyers attending all meetings with trump and all the lies we've witnessed almost daily, this is no surprise.  Extraordinary, yes.
960699522845310979 2018-02-05 02:19:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @ChristyPatriot and no Russians or trump associates have any reason to be pissed at him.  Nope. None.  Nada.
960690356730785793 2018-02-05 01:43:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NYinLA2121 he can tell @FLOTUS that Stormy was just "covering trump's shorts".
960689268904439808 2018-02-05 01:39:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @WeinfeldRuth @DrDenaGrayson that is just another lie to the Americans in a document that trump released to further obstruct justice and to further distort the truth about DOJ, FBI and those investigating him.  Thank you, Mr. Nunes, for helping turn the screws tighter.
960688366315384832 2018-02-05 01:35:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mikememoli @AlexNBCNews any takers they all voted in favor because they already KNOW trump is going to veto it?  It's all one big farce to look good to voters when they know the fix is in with trump saying no.

960678611043799040 2018-02-05 00:56:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump I'll never forget rescuing a young dog at the side of a road with a young woman of about 25.  She was afraid to pick the dog up in case it bit her as she had no health insurance.  How the hell anyone lives in fear like this is beyond me.

960044729437061120 2018-02-03 06:57:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PRESlDENTBANNON @danodelion trump is playing Go Fish.  But he will BE sorry alright.

959961404181639168 2018-02-03 01:26:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mflynnJR @omgwtfddido ROFL because people always plead guilty when they arent...especially when they have expensive lawyers.  SMFH

959506728806072320 2018-02-02 19:20:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> exactly.  There's a reason he hired Page and Manafort.  See my pinned tweet.  If I knew in July before the election of Manafort's Russian ties then trump knew.  He hired them BECAUSE OF their Russian contacts.https://twitter.com/highserenity49/status/959506062779998208
959506191356342272 2018-02-02 19:17:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Pappiness @highserenity49 @azredhead Nunes hasn't seen the documents used to get the original FISA warrant.  How can you claim to know anything is or isn't legitimate when the author of this document doesn't even know?  ROFL.
959505289807458304 2018-02-02 19:14:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Pappiness @azredhead yes I read the memo.  It changes nothing.  Carter Page admittedly was Male#1 in a 2013 court filing for cavorting with convicted Russian spies.  Like the FBI didn't have alarms ringing at full blast when trump announced him as one of his advisors.
959500951005483008 2018-02-02 18:57:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @kalaJAB @1964dwclark JFC Trey Gowdy and the Republicans spent hundreds and hundreds of hours investigating Benghazi and they spent millions and millions of dollars.  If ANYTHING was untoward they would have found it.   If Republicans hadn't slashed the budget people might have survived.
959496674279268353 2018-02-02 18:40:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Pappiness @azredhead maybe a couple people pleading guilty for lying to the FBI and another half dozen lying on forms about contacts with Russians and an AG lying under oath about contact with the Russians leads critical thinkers to believe the Dems aren't the ones lying. LOL.

Nice try tho. You sleep with Russian dogs...
959163569836208128 2018-02-01 20:36:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jonathanchait OMFG he was cavorting with convicted spies from Russia in 2013.  Dont associate with dubious foreign nationals and you wont be Male#1 in a court case.  ROFL.

If Republicans and the RNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no brainer. SOUND FAMILIAR?

957015128385380352 2018-01-26 22:19:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ericgarland @timeoutofmind64 the big news is that trump lied AGAIN about Russia not hacking us.  He knows this happened unless he slept through this intel briefing that would have taken place during the transition last year.  They surely would have informed him of this whole event.

956962044346945536 2018-01-26 18:48:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @funder everybody knows that Micheal Wolfe wasn't talking about Haley when he said trump was having an affair.  He also said one of the chapters in the book gave a big hint who it was. If you don't know who it is then there's no HOPE for you HICKS.
956960988313534464 2018-01-26 18:44:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nytopinion @mjwatts1983 the short term and long term threat to the entire world is donald j trump.  PERIOD. There's a reason (sane) people around the world are protesting him everywhere he goes.  No matter how hard FAUX News tries, they can't change the facts.
956942638061514753 2018-01-26 17:31:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ericgarland of course they aren't.  @nytimes and @maggieNYT made sure to change the narrative by releasing a story with news from 7 months ago that April Ryan had already reported when it happened in JUNE.
956932595324878848 2018-01-26 16:51:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Big surprise - now we've just seen a video where a Conservative woman reported Patrick Brown a couple of times to those in charge that could have investigated him and they ignored it. #complicitCONServativeshttps://twitter.com/donaldbuffoon/status/956389919986872320

956561190959726592 2018-01-25 16:15:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JuliaDavisNews trump hasn't imposed the last set of sanctions against Russia.  He won't cut of SWIFT payments....how will he get funds from the puppet master?
956556177797599237 2018-01-25 15:55:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tariqnasheed @excel44 what I do know about ANY shooting is that if so-called president hasn't rage tweeted about the shooting the odds are extremely high the shooter is white.
956548457073790977 2018-01-25 15:24:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @krassenstein I haven't capitalized his name for over a year.  and its so-called president.

956399563744530433 2018-01-24 05:33:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TheTorontoSun @MuteSwanTruth or they knew the gig was up and the accusations couldn't be defended.

956391937522585600 2018-01-24 05:03:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TheTorontoSun @MuteSwanTruth Ya, that would be why people that actually know him like his Campaign Manager and Deputy Manager and Press Secretary all just resigned.
956389919986872320 2018-01-24 04:55:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CharlesHMcVety "Patrick Brown Must Resign. For years we have been hearing about Patrick's coercion of women."  REALLY?  Bad character would be hearing about coercion of women for years and doing NOTHING to have the allegations investigated.    God, I pray you have no daughters.
956382029502849024 2018-01-24 04:23:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LyinTrump @treasonstickers 100% absolute guarantee.   I'd bet my house on it.

If you stay away from GRU spies and foreign nationals that are under surveillance you won't get picked up by IC.  Simple.   And if they do contact you - call the fucking FBI.
956210275191087104 2018-01-24 17:01:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid that's a great idea.  Then the racist's names can be memorialized in the wall for all the world to see.

956203673507344384 2018-01-24 16:34:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DearAuntCrabby Karma baby.  Karma.  The pathological LYING, serial adultery, pussy grabbing, his Howard Stern interviews, misogyny, hatred, racism, bullying, bragging, mocking a disable man, not paying contractors and hundreds of lawsuits should be ample reasons to have NOT voted for the pig.

956016302455476224 2018-01-23 04:10:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Rschooley it wouldn't matter.  Spencer, trump, David Duke and guys like that do have wives or women in their lives.  Hate is just hate.

THOU SHALT NOT LIE.
956008660068548608 2018-01-23 03:40:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MSNBC YEP, friends that regularly travelled to the USA absolutely refuse to spend one red cent of their tourism dollars in the USA as long as donald trump is in the WH.

Stone admits communicating with Assange.  Emails from Wikileaks to trump Jr., Stone knows ahead of time about Podesta hack.  Stone talks with Guccifer.
956003282773712896 2018-01-23 03:18:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @bestsparklegirl tell that to Flynn and George P and Mannafort and Gates.  Also tell that to every single trump associate that has spent 10s of thousands or hundreds of thousands in legal fees.  And tell it to every trump associate that LIED on their FARA forms.  ROFL. #ImpeachTrump
956001911295000576 2018-01-23 03:13:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @LarryCT obstruction would be easiest to prove with trump's interview with Holt, emails, testimony, trying to fire Sessions and McCabe and all of his public tweets on those subjects.   Also, if he hurries those along and trump gets him fired it goes to show conscious of guilt.

Many, many more will go down. The reason there is NO impeachment is that many Republicans all used the same tainted voter data to win their seat.  They all KNOW he will throw them all under the bus.

940784073215156225 2017-12-12 03:22:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Oh no.  Pompeo is not any better than Tillerson.  If anything, he might be worse due to IC ties.https://twitter.com/wonderfullone/status/940783858190110723

Take a look at the advertisers that Brietbart have lost due to organized forces.  They've lost millions and millions.  The same will happen to Toyota.
940605466169696256 2017-12-12 15:33:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Dear Alabama" companies like @Toyota are watching you.  Toyota is watching to see if they are going to build their plant in your state or North Carolina.  They know the world is watching them and they KNOW they can't build the plant in a state with a pedophile Senator.
940603463884464128 2017-12-12 15:25:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JuddLegum I especially loved the pimp witness...the guy that arranged teen aged boys for men in the UK.  The guy that lied in court.   We're going to do extreme vetting.  Nobody vets like me.  Nobody.
940427002313453568 2017-12-11 03:44:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> #NorthCarolina is praying Roy Moore wins his seat because they know @Toyota wouldn't dare put their plant in Alabama if they elect a pedophile.   Toyota knows that a world wide boycott of their cars would happen if they went ahead with the plant in Alabama. #GrabYourWallet

And why Sessions was recused for lying under oath about Russia.  And why Kushner lied multiple times on FARA forms about foreign contacts.  SMFH at the gullibility of MAGAts.

So we know if a 34 year old "good catch" came knocking to date her 16 year old daughter she'd probably say yes.

You knew that when you worked for Cruz and slammed trump all the time.   Your kids are going to want answers when they get older and see you on the wrong side of history.

Special thanks to Robert Mueller, Eric Schneiderman, James Comey, Sally Yates,  Preet Bharara for shepherding this through.   Looking forward to the impeachment party soon!
936888277910425601 2017-12-02 09:22:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump There is one person calling the shots.   His name is MUELLER.  Robert Mueller.  And hes coming for you.  Manafort Monday.  Flynn Friday.  trump Tuesday.    #impeachtrump
936886740912029698 2017-12-02 09:16:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Trump doesnt care what happens now.  He just perpetrated the biggest scam in history.   His kids now inherit WAY more money.  His GOLF COURSES get a tax break.  JET OWNERS get tax breaks.   And his sucker MAGAts are gonna pay for it.  Bwahaha
936885432326819840 2017-12-02 09:11:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @senorrinhatch @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @therockangel1 #MAGAt hasnt yet realized hes been conned.  IF s/he files a tax return the light will go on.  And s/he will meet Karma at time of realizing taxes went up not down.
936884078422376451 2017-12-02 09:05:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tywin_resists @williamlegate his racism, misogyny, bragging, pussy grabbing, pathological LYING, mocking disabled, constant bullying should have been the big red flags.  I wont feel one iota of sympathy for them voting that f*cker in
936880782697574400 2017-12-02 08:52:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SusanSarandon must be thrilled that trump has just saved her heirs millions of dollars in inheritance taxes.  And the middle class and poor Americans will pay more tax.  Well played, Susan.  Well played.

Eric Schneiderman NY state Attorney working with Mueller.  4. State crimes cant be pardoned. 5.  He cant pardon co-conspirator.  Mueller playing 3D chess them Go Fish.  Lol.

936785183612612610 2017-12-01 02:32:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @kylegriffin1 what's delicious is that when there's leaks they're intentional...legally leaked by Mueller to rile the trump treason team.  Imagine all those panicked phone calls each time they hear the latest rumor and what kind of intel Mueller gets from them.
936773859973279747 2017-12-01 01:47:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I take great delight in knowing every single one of those bastards will be waking up in terror sweats thinking about their impending jail time.  It will hardly make up for the worry trump has caused the world.https://twitter.com/dailypaint/status/936761745414197248
936744639322664960 2017-12-01 23:51:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @sherrishavon @Lilylive000Lily yep.  There will be a lot of hangovers the next day.
936736377789497344 2017-12-01 23:18:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @Lilylive000Lily @sherrishavon wait until the impeachment party to see what a real crowd looks like.  it will be bigger than the crowd he lied about at inauguration time.

Thank you for allowing me to trust in the fact that patriots would ensure trump and the treasonists would not get away with this.   Thank you for not allowing the trolls and bots to stop what you do.  THANK YOU!
936732546376679424 2017-12-01 23:03:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @ushadrons and some will be saved for Schneiderman if they happened in NY so trump can't pardon him.
936629961502289921 2017-12-01 16:15:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @BrianRoss @ABC if true, this is the THERE there, the topping on the nothing burger.
936629395015352322 2017-12-01 16:13:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Your daddy is now Mueller's bitch.  Eric @AGSchneiderman also has aces up his sleeve and state charges on standby so that trump can't pardon him.  Enjoy this day.  It's a sad, sad day in US history and you and daddy are on the wrong side of it. #LockHimUphttps://twitter.com/mflynnJR/status/927200333234950144
936627873514905600 2017-12-01 16:07:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> well, we've had Flynn Friday and Manafort Monday.  I can hardly wait for trump Tuesday.   "LOCK HIM UP"
936627282398998529 2017-12-01 16:05:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> it is so delicious that Flynn chanted "LOCK HIM UP" and he's the one that is pleading guilty in court right now.  @HillaryClinton is enjoying today more than anyone.
936626664292806661 2017-12-01 16:02:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Robert Mueller" is very careful to not bring all the charges against these #treasonweasils.  He's making sure there's state charges left over for @AGSchneiderman so that trump can't pardon them.  trump is playing Go Fish.  Mueller is playing 3D Chess.
936625772793438208 2017-12-01 15:59:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> all the MAGAts will pounce on Flynn.  Sarah will declare they barely knew him.  He'll be the guy that was serving coffee until they hired George P for that same position. Hillary will be chanting LOCK HIM UP in her sleep as will the saner part of America.
936620884214784000 2017-12-01 15:39:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> LOCK HIM UP.  LOCK HIM UP. LOCK HIM UP.
936620165386592257 2017-12-01 15:37:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Mike Flynn is in court and expected to plead guilty to lying to the FBI.  MAGAts can no longer claim this is a nothing burger.   This is history happening.   This IS the THERE there!https://twitter.com/donaldbuffoon/status/936527759978872832
936527759978872832 2017-12-01 09:29:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Many people are saying BIG news is coming out tomorrow on the trump/Russia front.  Please be right!

935985415785345024 2017-11-29 21:34:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GeraldoRivera Wow. Who knew that courtship involved a colleague trapping you in an office and then dropping his pants to expose his penis?  Youre quite the romanticist Geraldo.  NOT.

934481261019537408 2017-11-25 17:57:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SellersBailey OMG this made me cry.  What a sweet, sweet father.   That is one of the nicest thing I've seen.
934480009170792449 2017-11-25 17:52:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POLITICOMag ROFL - that's why we heard trump whining that the election was rigged before it even happened.
934467729355972608 2017-11-25 17:04:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Roy admitted on Hannity that he didn't date GIRLS without their mother's permission.  What kind of 30+ year old man dates teenagers?  And he admitted he fell for his wife years before he married her.  She would have been a TEENAGER.   What more do you need to know ALABAMA????????
934467228392501248 2017-11-25 17:02:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Good afternoon, Alabama.  You all heard trump threaten a lawsuit against his accusers that didn't happen.  It's because of DISCOVERY process that he would have to endure.  Watch Roy Moore do the exact same thing.  The LAST thing they want is DISCOVERY under oath.  PERIOD.
934463575711551488 2017-11-25 16:47:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AprilDRyan @rkrow12 Before ACA is repealed go get yourself some glasses.  Anyone can see that pie shell is NOT hand made.  It isn't April that lied.
934462240132014080 2017-11-25 16:42:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ShaunKing It's so humiliating to watch a supposed billionaire holding one of the most powerful positions in the world behave like a petulant child.  Sad.  Bigly sad.

934460236655509504 2017-11-25 16:34:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CheriJacobus She sold her soul to the devil to go work for trump after calling him out constantly when she worked for Cruz.  IMO, she'd sacrifice her daughter if it would help the CNP reach their goals.

934312170115829760 2017-11-24 06:45:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @patribotics @LouiseMensch @jsinvr Brexit was the dry run.  Everything worked perfectly for the Russians, Cambridge Analytica, Wikileaks, Farage and crew so they kicked it all into high gear for the real event which was giving trump the USA election.
934311368575954944 2017-11-24 06:42:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @mercifuln8 yes she did.  And her street cred comes from the fact that despite being very much for Brexit she still reports this.

934293551482941441 2017-11-24 05:31:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Person of the Year" is yet just another distraction by trump.  Sadly the media will spend hours and hours talking about this rather than trump/Russia.
934292597924708352 2017-11-24 05:28:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @soledadobrien color us surprised that trump lied.  Again.

934197036055855104 2017-11-24 23:08:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump now if you told us that Time called to say you were going to be awarded the Pathological Liar of the Year Award the whole world would believe you on that. #ImpeachTrump

Better they all fly around in private jets from US city to US city at the cost of tens of thousands of tax payer dollars.
933775532084289536 2017-11-23 19:13:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @lauferlaw Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family also!  Thank you for helping us sleep just a little bit easier.  You give us hope!
933765338432282624 2017-11-23 18:32:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> FFS i'm done -  @CNN talking about  Bill Clinton's transgressions in the WH.  Focus on this POTUS, not one from decades ago.
933760875596357632 2017-11-23 18:15:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @RWPUSA @sandratoes their inaction is the big tell.  They could have impeached him ages ago, kept Pence as POTUS, and continued on their rape and pillage of America given their majority in house and Senate.  But, they all know trump will take every single one of them down with him.
933760074958303232 2017-11-23 18:12:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @shaunpcassidy @BigSister40 we had an "air band" in our basement endlessly playing "I Think I love You" on our little record player.  Of course, I was David.  We played the song over and over, strumming our tennis racquets as guitars.  My heartfelt condolences to your family, Shaun.
933758471828205568 2017-11-23 18:05:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP @RWPUSA @sandratoes it will go deep.  Ryan, McConnell, Pence, will all go down, IMO.  I believe most of them are complicit in using hacked data from C.A. to win their seats.

930929314387734528 2017-11-15 22:43:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ABC @ShaolinPhan it was a complete and utter farce.  Change the narrative.  Accuse the accuser.  I'll be very surprised if there aren't more victims coming forward in the future.
930927801867280384 2017-11-15 22:37:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ABC @ShaolinPhan Yep, right out of trump playbook.  The best part is now trump has to take a stand one way or the other about Moore.
930927260252626946 2017-11-15 22:35:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ABC what a farce!  Gloria Allred has NO obligation whatsoever to #releaseTheYearbook. If he wants to sue, bring it on.  See you in discovery, Roy.

930923329833152512 2017-11-15 22:19:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @3L3V3NTH a tactic right out of Bannon/trump playbook.  People will now attack this woman and forget there's more victims out there.  They have now changed the narrative.
930921300565954560 2017-11-15 22:11:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Love that Roy Moore isn't stepping aside.  This forces the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump to take a stand one way or the other!
930920926866108416 2017-11-15 22:10:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> they don't have to #ReleaseTheYearBook unless there's a discovery. Bring it on Roy Moore.
930920351764070400 2017-11-15 22:08:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GloriaAllred will tell Roy Moore's lawyer to go fuck themselves if they ask for the year book. See you in discovery Roy!

930909079664345088 2017-11-15 21:23:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @wonderfullone I wonder how Moore got himself cured of his desire for young women/teen girls.  Or are there dozens and dozens more out there waiting to tell their story...

930806351466340354 2017-11-15 14:35:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @realDonaldTrump another lie.  You aren't getting your news from Fox cuz they reported on Halloween candy and Google emojis when Mannafort got arrested.

930603120748408832 2017-11-14 01:07:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> #JeffSessions saying, "I did not meet with the Russians" sounded exactly like, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman".

930462991358730240 2017-11-14 15:50:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> today we get to watch the Republicans in the "House Judiciary Committee" disgrace themselves by asking questions about complete and utter garbage when Jeff Sessions lied under oath and they ignore that.

930247565727035394 2017-11-13 01:34:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jkeenelife that's NOT an exaggeration.  People on here were showing pics of the chyrons (sp?) with those topics.
930247218790989824 2017-11-13 01:33:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> who knew the NothingBurger had Wikileaks on it?
930244842591944704 2017-11-13 01:23:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jkeenelife they won't.  They just don't talk about these things.  #ManafortMonday they were talking about Halloween Candy and Google Emojis.
930244493743341568 2017-11-13 01:22:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Stunning" and "Jaw dropping" is what Rosenthal says about the Wikileaks /Don Jr. revelations

930170806004363265 2017-11-13 20:29:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @igob4u2 @DavidBWriter yes because women want death threats and their life turned upside down because Twitter.

930163378529562624 2017-11-13 20:00:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> any takers out there that this is the first of many that will come forward?  Anyone?https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/930161877711310849

Remember when trump threatened the same thing a year ago.  Did you see that happen?  There's a reason you didn't.

929434066851475456 2017-11-11 19:42:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AynRandPaulRyan @JoyAnnReid he's probably panicking because he didn't expect Moore to give the answers he did.  He thought he was helping him but really the show hurt Moore, IMO.

928825414843211776 2017-11-09 03:23:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> will @tedcruz disavow his support for Moore until these disgusting allegations are cleared up?  Moore just said Cruz endorses him.

928779197970911232 2017-11-09 00:19:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Watchingyeahok @ddale8 what also horrifies me in this story is that two mothers of teen age daughters thought it was perfectly fine that their daughters were dating a 34 year old man.
928777863347683328 2017-11-09 00:14:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AHamiltonSpirit it's delicious to think these traitorous bastards are all laying in bed terrified as to who they can trust, wondering who has flipped and who is wired.  It just makes my day, every day.
928774387674710016 2017-11-09 00:00:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @228Years @joanwalsh @ViviVacca what surprised me almost as much was the mother's reaction to the young girl dating the 34 year old man.  If any guy that age came sniffing around my daughter of 17 I'd blow his c@ck off.

928766127953424384 2017-11-09 23:27:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk @228Years Yep, the supposed body guard, there to protect trump from trouble, including Kompromat, leaves the area.  Like hell he turned down the offer.  He left so there was plausible deniability that he "saw nothing".
928756359163650049 2017-11-09 22:49:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> its absolutely astounding how Republicans are spinning that "Roy Moore" did nothing wrong but just the Weinstein, Weiner, Spacey Libs are the perverts.  SMFH in disgust at the hypocrisy.  #FAKEchristians

928699924878782464 2017-11-09 19:04:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> looks like the birds have come home to roost for "Roy Moore" and Republicans if the allegations coming out in the news are true.  #PizzaGate
928699323054825472 2017-11-09 19:02:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TomPerez @sweepybuns yep, but I'd bet money if there was any way he could cause further dissent amongst the party he would.

928673633265840128 2017-11-09 17:20:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @randypcox the only penance for trump is that he dies broke, alone and with the whole world laughing at him.
928669623184011264 2017-11-09 17:04:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TomPerez @tomwatson @ryrysven @sweepybuns then Tom should make it ridiculously clear to Bernie that if he wants to run in 2020 its NOT as a Dem because Bernie announced last night if he runs its as a Dem.

925229248872292352 2017-10-30 05:13:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @renato_mariotti The only logical conclusion is that Carter Page's "advisors" are either the FBI or Mueller and he was advised to go on TV to stir the pot.
925190629721702401 2017-10-30 02:40:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> a Hannity indictment would be absolutely the icing on the cake in all of this.  https://twitter.com/funder/status/924976557629861890

925181871075377152 2017-10-30 02:05:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Rosie he said he has "advisors".  Perhaps an FBI handler?  Or a guy named Bobby 3 sticks?
925181659481194496 2017-10-30 02:04:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @chrislhayes @renato_mariotti unless he's one of the 4 sealed files #'d in between George's and Mannafort's and is "proactively co-operating" like George was.

925158635923111936 2017-10-30 00:33:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @chrislhayes this would suggest he's flipped.  I'm hoping Mueller orchestrated this to scare a few more trump folks to run to the FBI with damning info.pic.twitter.com/ipWURh2NEF

912127876765380608 2017-09-24 01:33:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LovesTheJust @Atul_Gawande the plan is to continue to support and discuss #dotard belittling NBA and NFL players while Americans die in Puerto Rico.  #ImpeachTrump

887860080720216066 2017-07-19 02:21:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> unlike trump, we remember Sessions recused himself because he LIED UNDER OATH about meetings he had with Russians.https://twitter.com/NYer4HRC/status/887859540460425216
887859531471962112 2017-07-19 02:19:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DrJillStein @Spicerlies @GWillicker8 absolutely.  I've always had questions about her involvement in this, especially being at that dinner.
887859229830160384 2017-07-19 02:18:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Ryan_Harkness12 @harrisp72 glad you're not the judge and jury when no evidence of broken laws was found by either the FBI or GOP.
887858017684684800 2017-07-19 02:13:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Spicerlies @GWillicker8 interesting @DrJillStein is on the list.
887856592497934337 2017-07-19 02:08:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Ryan_Harkness12 @harrisp72 I see you still boohooing about HRC after HUNDREDS of hours of investigation and MILLIONS of dollars spent- Emails, Benghazi, foundation...
887851143824424960 2017-07-19 01:46:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Ryan_Harkness12 @harrisp72 LOL, in many countries at many levels of government it is a STANDARD practice to smash or remove hard drives & sim cards of old devices.
886601242952126465 2017-07-16 14:59:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @Alexey__Kovalev @Horned_OwlJA Right, and they didn't investigate Benghazi for hundreds of hours which cost MILLIONS of dollars only to learn TREY GOWDY LIED!
885893019857072128 2017-07-14 16:05:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch Louise, do you think Smith was the owner of the twitter  account that told trump to mention her missing emails.
885884039114051584 2017-07-14 15:29:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch I keep forgetting you said this before.  Thank you for reminder!
885878617749602304 2017-07-14 15:08:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I think this just went from small "t" treason to TREASON!

885738154426224640 2017-07-13 05:50:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @officialnmp @mmpadellan More people will attend your party than attended the 2017 inauguration
885722973629431808 2017-07-13 04:49:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @davidfrum @StillLes4Hill apparently trump didn't see that book otherwise he might not have sold his soul to Russia.
885715169610833925 2017-07-13 04:18:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @funder the word on the street is that is the real reason McConnell cancelled recess and NOT the HC bill.
885713775550124032 2017-07-13 04:13:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP @Pendejss25 @LaurieCanadian Like Graham he's all huff and puff.  Blusters and stammers but then turns right around and votes in support of trump.
885712802630975490 2017-07-13 04:09:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated @sadiesnanny59 LOL, I'd be surprised if she knew how to do much more than plug a USB in.

885647818857168896 2017-07-13 23:51:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @Rudd524 have you ever been pulled over "just because"?   i haven't.  I don't know anyone that has either.

885552205532545024 2017-07-13 17:31:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> this tweet is excellent evidence for you recently filed lawsuit.  More harassment and more lies about you.  UNBELIEVABLE.  Screenshot it.https://twitter.com/Sherry7202/status/885516058488123392
885551343246614528 2017-07-13 17:27:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated but they all just voted along party lines to not strip Jared's security clearance.
885550764734558209 2017-07-13 17:25:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SpeakerRyan @DWStweets @mikedebonis @SadMusketeer the worst is @LindseyGrahamSC who pretends he's outraged and then he totally contradicts what he says.  @GOP will wear trump for decades.

885515575123771392 2017-07-13 15:05:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LindseyGrahamSC @EricBoehlert @poliscigrl Graham is all huff and puff bluster.  Next chance he gets he'll vote to support whatever trump needs.  He's such a #FAKE
885506457398943744 2017-07-13 14:29:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @rosenwald_eric @TimPapadopoulo2 Sure.  But, none of that excuses the author from not being up front about how the fund got started.
885503305794822144 2017-07-13 14:16:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @rosenwald_eric @TimPapadopoulo2 that's your take. I watched it unfold. His readers appreciated the MANY hours of work he does. They wanted to show gratitude. SiMPLE.
885499439497961472 2017-07-13 14:01:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @englemanmike1 I guess you were busy watching Fox who probably had knitting lessons on while the rest of the world learned they did collude.
885494410397458433 2017-07-13 13:41:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @englemanmike1 Right Mike.  Thats's why trump and cohorts are lawyering up at $1000.00+ per hour cuz the news is FAKE.
885492927165628416 2017-07-13 13:35:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @siaayrom @RVAwonk Bring it on!  the threat of trump having to submit back taxes will ensure quick settlement if the suit goes ahead.

885273992084373504 2017-07-12 23:05:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @chrislhayes @jonvankin exactly.  There's decades of evidence that trump is a con, rips people off, lies pathologically, cheated on wives, paid massive fines, etc.
885273381825691649 2017-07-12 23:03:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @chrislhayes @jeremyscahill given Don Jr. took it as genuine there's no reason we shouldn't.  Three senior campaign people went to a meeting based on it.

885216764493127681 2017-07-12 19:18:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk J.C. that's a frightening thing to witness to start your day.
885214865257766916 2017-07-12 19:10:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> FFS these Republicans making excuses for Don Jr. make me puke. The very fact he lied about it proves his guilt.     "Christopher Wray"
885201145290817537 2017-07-12 18:16:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mensch @20committee @lizardalice I think it would show many things. i.e.: Not as rich as he claims, business with Russia and loans all over the place for starters.
885159735980285952 2017-07-12 15:31:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DonaldJTrumpJr @JesseBWatters @FoxNews what a disgrace Fox is.  1000's of people are in jail cells for following through with illegal acts even if the intended outcome failed.

885146014541168641 2017-07-12 14:37:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @lizardalice and remember someone (with a RU @) sent him a tweet and told him to say that just before he said that.
885144713388371968 2017-07-12 14:31:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump bwahaha.  your son should have called the FBI.  Instead it appears he committed treason with a RU handler.  #LockHimUp #treasontrumps

884990254918324226 2017-07-11 04:18:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> He admitted meeting with a Russian government official (per email) to get dirt on HRC.  His ONLY call should have been to FBI.  PERIOD.
884989212335931393 2017-07-11 04:14:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> You don't need to watch any network as you can read HIS email HE released.  See who he was meeting and the intent of the meeting.
884986955423002624 2017-07-11 04:05:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> and orange kool-aid drinkers will continue to believe there's no trump/Russia connection even tho Don Jr. just ADMITTED it. LOL.
884986096446300166 2017-07-11 04:01:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> ROFL.  You just keep telling yourself that.  That's why "dire legal situation" is being bandied about in regards to Don Jr.https://twitter.com/BrenG053/status/884984118483853313

884983527757848576 2017-07-11 03:51:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Clapper clearly said he saw disturbing evidence that required more investigations.  he also said he was NOT in the loop of information.
884983110315630592 2017-07-11 03:49:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Don Jr. just admitted working with RU to get dirt on HRC.  FBI just stated they were NOT aware of that meeting until now.  STAY WOKE!
884982575487270912 2017-07-11 03:47:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Kushner failed to disclose.  Manafort failed to disclose.  DT Jr. just admitted colluding with Russians. Sessions lied under oath.
884981731081703424 2017-07-11 03:44:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> OMG there's three separate investigations going on at both the FBI, NY State and Fed level.  FinCEN, FBI and Meuller are all involved.https://twitter.com/BrenG053/status/884980786000166916

884959067495579649 2017-07-11 02:14:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Roni4488 yes I say them often; they are frequently used words by many people & on various TV shows.
884957287999193088 2017-07-11 02:07:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Roni4488 then they must be racist, too.
884956539726905344 2017-07-11 02:04:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Roni4488 a minute ago you didn't even know what the word meant.  Now suddenly you think because I use a commonly used Yiddish word I'm racist.  ROFL.
884955566761623552 2017-07-11 02:00:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Roni4488 OMG it's a commonly used term like Schlemiel and Schlimazel.  Do you consider them racist too?
884954450153975808 2017-07-11 01:55:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @BillOReilly FFS the ONLY call he should have made was to the FBI.  PERIOD.   Bank robbers that don't get money still go to jail.  SHAME ON YOU!
884952566630502400 2017-07-11 01:48:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DirkZ1 wasn't this just one of a couple meetings he amended?  One was with Kislyak. This was the one that caught the attention of the NYT reporter.

884949068123824128 2017-07-11 01:34:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @davididing @chrislhayes if you scratch not too far under the surface how many are complicit?  How many of them knowingly used tainted voter data to win their seat?
884948236603056128 2017-07-11 01:31:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @4everNeverTrump McCain and Graham are all huff and puff.  They feign outrage but still support trump at every turn and on every vote.  #COMPLICIT @GOP

884939783914504192 2017-07-11 00:57:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @jkircoff the WOTS as to why @SenateMajLdr is demanding they work through the next couple weeks is that he knows trump is gonna fire Mueller.
884939318539599872 2017-07-11 00:55:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @KristenInVA @lotsohats but would either of them have access to Don Jr's emails?  The NYT had details of the emails.

884884310863429632 2017-07-11 21:17:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @FoxNews please do.  Robert Mueller can hardly wait to hear what he says.
884883384643670016 2017-07-11 21:13:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @seanhannity @Klefas I'm sure she thanks her mother every day for keeping her away from trump.

884864036692570112 2017-07-11 19:56:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LilleyDennese My guess- they're admitting this because there is so much worse coming.  And they're not the brightest bulbs to start with.
884863793871806464 2017-07-11 19:55:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CheriJacobus the intelligence of orange kool-aid drinkers is diminishing by the day.

884851639240146944 2017-07-11 19:07:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics @MicWesterfield right. Tell all the lawyers they haven't a clue what they're talking about. And tell Don Jr he doesn't need a lawyer.  ROFL.

884844874712793088 2017-07-11 18:40:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MarkMazzettiNYT if she's still in the country I wonder how fast Putin would demand she return to Russia if any of the investigations asked her to testify.
884834920123613185 2017-07-11 18:00:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> YEP,  @seanhannity already suggested Jr. was set up.  Soon, he'll say Seth Rich set him up.
884834180961509376 2017-07-11 17:58:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GenFlynn @WSJ @wadeNYC @LouiseMensch @diamonddarling he released them himself.  If he hadn't, I would agree with you as it's hard to fathom why he'd release a smoking gun against himself.

884827422641725440 2017-07-11 17:31:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @kat_is_in @BUSHMASTER50 @jackschofield love the checklist. Far too much #winning with these buffoons in the WH.
884826569658650625 2017-07-11 17:27:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TheRickWilson @JYuter @JoshuaCypess Terrifying that Kushner, Manafort and Jr. agreed to meet an unknown Russian FN without hesitation.  This is only the first of many MOABs.
884824684000235521 2017-07-11 17:20:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TheRickWilson @JYuter @JoshuaCypess yep, my guess is they're copping to this because they know there's much worse coming.
884824172869722112 2017-07-11 17:18:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @EsotericCD when attempting to rob a bank and not getting money from the teller its still a crime to attempt to rob the bank.
884822690560790528 2017-07-11 17:12:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @sarahkendzior if Don Jr. hadn't released the smoking gun on himself I'd say the email was a fake like Maddow warned about.  Except HE released it.  SMH.
884822224431075328 2017-07-11 17:10:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ericgarland So true!  Americans will be horrified at the magnitude compared to the Watergate break-in.  If treason is proved, they will die in jail.
884811497074941952 2017-07-11 16:27:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> releasing a smoking gun on himself is pretty stunning.https://twitter.com/JYSexton/status/884810210170327041
884808144613810176 2017-07-11 16:14:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @frreigns and it shows he colluded with Russians and it showed Manafort and Kushner KNEW what the meeting was about BEFORE they got there.pic.twitter.com/2MdHXRHNhB
884807659890778112 2017-07-11 16:12:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Don Jr's. feet really must not have any more bullet room.  Every time he tweets or talks he shoots himself AGAIN.https://twitter.com/nana2hallie/status/884806998696628224
884807196701216768 2017-07-11 16:10:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> who knew that EMAILS from "Don Jr." would be the smoking gun of trump/Russia collusion?
884806233399492608 2017-07-11 16:06:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ramadeyrao @funder yep, no different than attempting to rob a bank but not getting any money from the teller.
884804844585746432 2017-07-11 16:01:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DonaldJTrumpJr We're now living in an alternate universe.  Don Jr. released a smoking gun on team trump. SMFH with amazement at stupidity.
884789277158121474 2017-07-11 14:59:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics @robbinl_robbins says the guy that thinks it is the whole dem party that should go down.  ROFL.
884788149565521921 2017-07-11 14:55:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics @MicWesterfield Don Jr's ONLY phone call should have been to the FBI, not to gather recruits to meet a foreign national.  This meeting IS THE THERE THERE.
884783614369476608 2017-07-11 14:37:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics @MicWesterfield Sure. Flynn fired, Sessions recused, Nunes removed. Page turfed. Manafort turfed.  Many LIED on forms & denied meetings.  #CRYwolf #TREASON
884781859581722624 2017-07-11 14:30:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics @robbinl_robbins ROFL  Apparently Fox isn't keeping you up to date, it's trump's team and family that are all lawyering up.  NOT the Dems.
884779637389221892 2017-07-11 14:21:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCPolitics Pay attention America!    History is unfolding.  Is this revelation about Don Jr. the catalyst that will bring them all down?
884770606595559426 2017-07-11 13:45:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TeaPainUSA @tree_bee_501 well if the money was printed when Obama was POTUS...
884765172715339776 2017-07-11 13:23:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Letting religion interfere in politics is "How We Are Ruining America" Intolerance, anti-abortionists, dictating what a women can wear, etc.

884544519085084672 2017-07-10 22:47:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ProudResister @CNN allows themselves to be pimped out by trump.  They can stop airing paid liars for trump and stop giving him any more air time.
884542906161180673 2017-07-10 22:40:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @rickwtyler @jmoo61 apparently not. He's on @CNN lying, spinning & shilling for trump each and every day.   A good reason to change the channel or boycott them.

884213099355439104 2017-07-09 00:50:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @Sunnysgrl62 yep and the coup was complete and successful when trump heeded Putin's request that Lavrov and Kislyak meet trump in the Oval Office.

875559854407958528 2017-06-15 03:45:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> serious question - in your years at this job have you ever witnessed a statement like this?https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/875534251667664900

875549515587112960 2017-06-15 03:04:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FreddyRoo2 @davidfrum BRING IT!  We will ignore it.  I promise.

875546774500368384 2017-06-15 02:53:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Yair_Rosenberg so, I guess we can expect another round of terror sweat tweets in the middle of the night then.

875543448618549249 2017-06-15 02:39:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AriMelber @LouiseMensch don't know about handing justice to a trumpet, tho
875543346868961286 2017-06-15 02:39:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AriMelber @LouiseMensch because he may end up being a witness (and Sessions too) as to why trump fired Comey in the Obstruction of Justice charge.
875542828268396544 2017-06-15 02:37:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @fordm @joncoopertweets why is everyone lawyering up if there is no Russian connection and this is all #fakenews?

875503054589538304 2017-06-15 23:59:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jeffreyjonsmith Pence and Ryan are going down with the ship.  Bet on it.
875502707418607616 2017-06-15 23:58:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated @trichardpdx @wilsod32 he'd be a hero world wide if he was instrumental in trump resigning or being impeached.
875483354329632768 2017-06-15 22:41:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Richard Cullen" is good friends with Comey = GOOD but Comey being good friends with Mueller = BAD. R's give me a headache.
875482610918604800 2017-06-15 22:38:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DanEggenWPost interesting.  very interesting.
875482270689140736 2017-06-15 22:36:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> John Dean said the biggest mistake they made was Nixon NOT hiring a criminal lawyer.  Pence did. trump hasn't.    "Richard Cullen"
875481400215863296 2017-06-15 22:33:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> allegedly trump's lawyer advised WH staff they don't need lawyers yet.  Pence knew better and ran out and hired "Richard Cullen".    Oh. Oh.
875480803194454016 2017-06-15 22:31:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> you don't hire a lawyer like "Richard Cullen" unless you know know you could be BIGLY in trouble.
875480159184232448 2017-06-15 22:28:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> the hiring of "Richard Cullen" is further proof that the news is NOT fake and the "witch hunt" is going to end badly for many.
875479890446786564 2017-06-15 22:27:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> the poor staff won't be able to hire lawyers at 1500+ per hour.  It's costs half a week's wages just to greet these guys.   "Richard Cullen"
875479299226189824 2017-06-15 22:25:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> another expensive Washington lawyer joins the fight to end the #witchhunt and #FakeNews.  YCMTU.   "Richard Cullen"
875479014734929921 2017-06-15 22:23:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @Corrynmb I guess that's why Pence just lawyered up.  A whole lot of expensive lawyers hired to fight the #witchhunt.  ROFL.
875478593265991680 2017-06-15 22:22:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> a whole lot of expensive lawyers are being hired to fight those (so-called) non-existent Russian ties.     "Richard Cullen"
875478209625595904 2017-06-15 22:20:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Pence has the good sense to hire an experience criminal lawyer, unlike trump.  Paying your bills obviously has its perks.   "Richard Cullen"

875121987210813440 2017-06-14 22:45:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @funder @markjunor3 'do our lives matter less than GOP"  Twitter needs a "rhetorical question" emoji
875121643344887808 2017-06-14 22:43:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump YOU ARE THE FAKE NEWS.  YOU.  BIGLY YOU.  BELIEVE ME.
875120936533413888 2017-06-14 22:41:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Tooda @kyledcheney I think it was Politico that first announced it before trump did.
875119912812859393 2017-06-14 22:37:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics @JackPounders Oh, I'll bet on it.  Pay attention to the dream team of prosecutors being assembled. & trump lawyered up & FinCEN activities.   RICO, baby.
875119216336052224 2017-06-14 22:34:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid @CalebRoyal82 you call it chaos, I call it karma.  I haven't got one iota of sympathy for the NRA whores that have the power to change this gun sh!t show.

875114862778621952 2017-06-14 22:16:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @52fairway @CommsDirector Sandy Hook didn't happen so there's no need to imagine that...according to lunatic Alex Jones
875113852446232577 2017-06-14 22:12:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amplitude350Lee Karma for the NRA whores.
875113350627184640 2017-06-14 22:10:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Freeyourmindkid the tell is that the Russian bots haven't quite figured out "you're" and "your" yet.
875112752120946688 2017-06-14 22:08:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics @JackPounders oh poor Jack.  There's 3 separate investigations going on. trump is going down either for RICO or treason or collusion.  You can bet on it.
875112344321269760 2017-06-14 22:06:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics @JackPounders MILLIONS of dollars later and HUNDREDS of hours investigating proved Benghazi was a Trey Gowdy LIE.  Will you guys ever stop lying about it?
875111445368717314 2017-06-14 22:03:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @icewolf610 @Amy_Siskind the NRA whores turned into melting snowflakes today because they saw real life HORROR that gun victims suffer all over the USA EVERY day.
875110485661589505 2017-06-14 21:59:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind @MicheleMT55 YEP, the alt-left's misogyny is as extreme as the alt-right's.
875105735541104640 2017-06-14 21:40:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics @JackPounders what does whitewater from 20 years ago have to do with trump/Russia?  or Benghazi or her emails?  ROFL.
875101364904280064 2017-06-14 21:23:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @benshapiro @KenDilanianNBC @miranda3d918 @antonio49741579 how easy is it for you to do your own due diligence, dude?  I'm not your secretary.
875100961764630528 2017-06-14 21:21:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @TwiTati and the f*cking presidential candidate promoting violence at rallies and offering to pay their legal fees.
875100116520026112 2017-06-14 21:18:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics unfortunately, Barton is wrong.  100+ Americans die EVERY DAY from guns whether suicide, accidentally or get murdered.  THAT IS THE REALITY.
875099230477484032 2017-06-14 21:14:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNNPolitics @JackPounders Flynn fired. Nunes removed. Sessions recused and lied under oath. Page turfed. Manafort turfed. Kushner lied on forms.  SO NO.
875097819211644929 2017-06-14 21:09:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @uctdsam @toby_dorena ROFL since trump is the only politician we've witness wanting to silence the media and openly advocated violence at rallies.  Keep on LYING.

875015192827932673 2017-06-14 15:40:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> if only Lunatic Orange held a presser when the 2 heroes were killed in Portland   Scalise
875014657915760640 2017-06-14 15:38:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> has anyone else reported this.  CNN is only reporting what trump said.https://twitter.com/jamiedupree/status/875014302507433986
875014375416881156 2017-06-14 15:37:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> is now a good time to talk about common sense gun control?  Probably not.  More legislation will be passed to arm more people.https://twitter.com/MrDane1982/status/875012582092017667
875013404154515456 2017-06-14 15:33:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DRUDGE_REPORT that's funny because the vast majority of Americans think the Republicans are trying to kill as many marginalized Americans that they can.
875000846605361152 2017-06-14 14:43:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CheriJacobus @Glennah Im waiting for Alex Jones to deny this shooing happened.  Soon he should be accusing them of being actors.
874999929957003264 2017-06-14 14:40:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Freeyourmindkid @Martha52A @my2meows it isn't the Dems threatening to take away your healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid and SS...so there's that.
874998934409576448 2017-06-14 14:36:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Freeyourmindkid @selene_babaar Yep, that's where I'm putting my money.

874877400135467011 2017-06-13 06:33:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @amandarivkin no, I've been well aware of what a crook, liar and conman he was but never expected treason with Putin.  See my pinned tweet.
874876765918900225 2017-06-13 06:30:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nytimes @jrivera64 sadly, the "old" white men haven't cornered that market based on the misogyny, hatred, and anger I see from the young white guys, too.
874875935224463360 2017-06-13 06:27:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> yep, and look how happy and relaxed he is with the Russians.  Now recall the glum, angry look on his face when Angela Merkel was with him.https://twitter.com/pj_reed_407/status/874874527314042882
874875452774592515 2017-06-13 06:25:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JasonMillerinDC @mamarnr71 sad as a woman you don't call this misogynist asshole out for calling her "hysterical" but not the man that did the same thing.
874874973114032128 2017-06-13 06:23:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JasonMillerinDC @kisspcgoodbye FFS her questions required a simple YES or NO, not a deliberate rambling answer wasting her precious 5 minutes.
874874145309372416 2017-06-13 06:20:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @amandarivkin I don't remember being freaked out too often in my life.  911 was one time and seeing Kislyak and Lavrov in the Oval Office was another one.

874869573660659712 2017-06-13 06:02:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @amandarivkin yep, that fat bastard Lavrov mocking Comey's firing from inside the Oval Office was the signal to Putin the coup was completed and a success
874868601106427906 2017-06-13 05:58:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Rosie @KimSchwan @top25rankings I can't think of anyone less competent that the asshole sitting in the WH.  I've been in administration for years and could do better.
874867649364328448 2017-06-13 05:54:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tedlieu @RepSwalwell @jeankrak ooh that's a good question.

874655781865398272 2017-06-13 15:52:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @StephenKing @HelenKennedy @AJ true, so Stephen with 3.2M followers would get a lot of likes and RT's keeping him at the top of the TL, hence why he's blocking them.

863102092629557248 2017-05-12 18:42:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @OfficialSPGB @politiloko kool-aid drinkers certainly follow their speaking notes perfectly, I see.
863101702559285248 2017-05-12 18:40:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @OfficialSPGB @politiloko FACT: CIA Clapper JUST said he would NOT be privy to what the FBI is doing. FACT: the investigation was happening LONG BEFORE Nov. 8th
863101283837792256 2017-05-12 18:39:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @OfficialSPGB @politiloko right.  That's why the investigation started months BEFORE the election happened.  ROFL.
863101027611852801 2017-05-12 18:38:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @OfficialSPGB @politiloko Flynn fired.  Sessions recused.  Nunes removed.  Manafort turfed. Page turfed.  So glad there's NO Russian ties!

863099683932995584 2017-05-12 18:32:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Clapper was JUST on MSNBC saying he wouldn't be privy to that information that's why he doesn't know.  #Impeach45 #TrumpRussiaInvestigation

862871516370788352 2017-05-11 03:26:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @BertDilbert WRONG. Obama should have fired Comey in October.  the ONLY reason trump fired Comey is he is investigating trump.  PERIOD.  #ImpeachTrump

862866843836465152 2017-05-11 03:07:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @counterchekist @LouiseMensch Love to hear your take on Carter saying he's spent "tens of hours" talking to CIA and FBI.  Is he lying or is he wired?

862804788454465537 2017-05-11 23:01:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump claims "Putin asked me to meet with Russian diplomat".  And the diplomat mocked America IN THE WH about Comey firing.

862705777630248960 2017-05-11 16:27:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @juliaioffe worse yet, he didn't bother to find out where in the WH the pictures were taken or what room(s) the Russians were in WITH ELECTRONICS!

862696791099166720 2017-05-11 15:51:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> OMG America is screwed.  NSA Director wasn't even aware of what part of the WH the Russians were in yesterday with ELECTRONICS.   McCabe
862696113052073985 2017-05-11 15:49:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @jlangdale Maybe he definitely knows Comey told him he WAS under investigation.
862693233452699648 2017-05-11 15:37:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> based on McCabe comments on Comey and how much he respects him, I'd bet trump is sorry he picked him to be his replacement.

862417713762664448 2017-05-10 21:23:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nowhitenonsense @_____Daphne Sadly, the Dean threatened them instead of being proud of them...but then who were the idiots that thought it a good idea to invite her?
862417225587736576 2017-05-10 21:21:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CloudContact @jeannewman I wouldn't be surprised if we hear from Comey before Tuesday on this very subject.
862416588774952960 2017-05-10 21:18:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> this is why it defies logic that @MSNBC would start hiring trump talking heads.  The saner part of America is starved for more Maddows.https://twitter.com/therightswrong/status/862416145738944512

862413043006816256 2017-05-10 21:04:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart @HeatherRohde1 Yes.  Yes, we know that anything trump kool-aid drinkers don't like to hear is "fake".
862411431395811328 2017-05-10 20:58:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart @HeatherRohde1 I guess that's why another Grand Jury is being convened cuz there's nothing going on.  LOL.
862410904947671040 2017-05-10 20:55:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @_____Daphne @nowhitenonsense WTF is happening to America that this cowardly Dean would do this?   I'm so proud of those students!
862409813623414784 2017-05-10 20:51:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AprilDRyan if only one of your colleagues that were given the floor by Sean would pass it over to you...
862408516362944513 2017-05-10 20:46:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @maggieNYT have they replaced a single one of the 40+ fired US attorneys?
862408104406728705 2017-05-10 20:44:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr Anyone with a brain knew your claim was a joke and that you wouldn't demand an independent committee. Don't insult us! #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
862403937839661056 2017-05-10 20:28:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SarahHuckabee @Khanoisseur the @GOP is full of good "christians" that are happy to lie or deceive for him. @CNN and @MSNBC are also happy to put them on the air.
862401753920045057 2017-05-10 20:19:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Mounting evidence suggests trump #ComeyFiring was because the Russian investigation is *escalating*.  PER CNN.
862401234128388096 2017-05-10 20:17:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mt4850 @JoeNBC perfect cuz if trump and Pence go down she'd be next in line for POTUS.  BRING IT ON!
862400303039102976 2017-05-10 20:13:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Cruz, Sessions, Ryan, Pence are all the epitome of Pharisees.  Lying, vile, deceitful bastards.https://twitter.com/DarMV/status/862376648934608896
862397028453597184 2017-05-10 20:00:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @italkpolitics OMG that made me laugh out loud!
862395471548923904 2017-05-10 19:54:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart @SaltyLadytron there is a FInCen investigation into trump
862394822123896832 2017-05-10 19:52:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @JUNEBUG501 what does that even say?
862394650362994688 2017-05-10 19:51:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @KenDilanianNBC @KatyTurNBC YEP, hopefully the opposite effect happens and major leaks start happening....perhaps some audio...
862392281516589056 2017-05-10 19:41:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @JUNEBUG501 nowhere did I claim either of those things so don't make stuff up.
862356068478754816 2017-05-10 17:18:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ColinHanks @RyanLizza @DonnaKDDJ ROFL. Clearly you don't know the definition of racism if you deem the left to be racists.
862352975720611840 2017-05-10 17:05:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Russian FM Lavrov" just openly mocked USA by joking about the Director of the FBI being fired. THIS IS NOT OK.  @GOP Shame on you!
862352220674637824 2017-05-10 17:02:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @bulldoghill @ALT_uscis Make no mistake America you all just witnessed Putin's right hand man MOCK USA when Lavrov joked about USA's Director of the FBI being fired
862351384380702720 2017-05-10 16:59:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @AnitaCreamer @JohnOSullivan36 as @shannoncoulter pointed out yesterday, Conway was brought out of hiding to be seen on MSM because a woman "softens the message".
862350442713329665 2017-05-10 16:55:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart Thank you for the clarification as you had clearly said unmasking was a crime.
862349996397477888 2017-05-10 16:53:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart Yates testified under oath she did not leak the name to the press, as did Clapper.
862347890978508800 2017-05-10 16:45:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @KhalidGoldstein YES.  He is flaunting his Russia ties to all of @GOP.  They don't care.  They are all now complicit in this coverup and involvement.
862347518549475329 2017-05-10 16:44:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LA_Detroit @co_rapunzel4 welcome to the United States of Russia
862346438511964162 2017-05-10 16:39:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk they don't care.  Lord, Paris, Kayleigh, Conway are all evidence that LIARS and spinners are welcome.  Especially on @CNN
862346108797726720 2017-05-10 16:38:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RusEmbUSA further proof that we are those frogs in the pot of hot water...and the temperature rose with Comey firing and again today with this pic.
862345642303082496 2017-05-10 16:36:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @KaraCalavera @A_M_Dolan Right, if you buy Grassley's concerns as anything but a smoke screen.
862345004852723712 2017-05-10 16:34:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GovMikeHuckabee operative word being "once" demanded. OMG is there a @GOP anywhere that isn't complicit in this coverup?

862343031260815360 2017-05-10 16:26:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart what's sad is that trumps LIES and Fox BS has convinced "seemingly" intelligent people that unmasking is illegal.
862341783610470400 2017-05-10 16:21:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart unmasking is NOT a crime. NOT even close.  Do your research as you're now spreading trump/Fox lies and propaganda.
862341152560644096 2017-05-10 16:18:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart BTW I never claimed trump was wiretapped.  I said HE is under investigation.
862340903272292352 2017-05-10 16:17:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart What?  You're admitting trump was LYING when he said Obama was tapping his lines?
862340373460377600 2017-05-10 16:15:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart you didn't need to say it.  Your Fox speaking lines give you away.
862338972550287361 2017-05-10 16:10:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart here's a story NOT from the Fox/Brietbart/Infowars echo chamber.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/comey-russia-investigation-fbi.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0
862337256006139904 2017-05-10 16:03:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> to all of you that just witnessed #Lavrov mocking America that is the signal that Putin is now the POTUS not Bannon and not trump.
862336520757190656 2017-05-10 16:00:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP idly stands by as #Lavrov openly mocks America on national TV.  Putin has masterfully reduced USA to a laughingstock of the world.
862336033576202240 2017-05-10 15:58:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart Oh please.  Even Burr is admitting the firing is a "coverup".
862334699275927553 2017-05-10 15:53:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart there is an open FinCen investigation into trump and his financial ties to Russia.
862329054397059072 2017-05-10 15:30:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler @AmeliaReinhart 1.  WRONG.   2.  AND Sessions recommendation  3. WRONG he recused himself from RU related issues.  This is totally a Russia related issue.
862327108374216704 2017-05-10 15:22:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr we now have our answer.  He declares there's an appearance of cover-up but denies an independent committee is needed.  HE IS COMPLICIT!
862326731255894016 2017-05-10 15:21:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk COLOR ME SURPRISED. @SenatorBurr is complicit in the demise of democracy of America.  He is officially part of the coverup now.
862324669826740225 2017-05-10 15:13:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @EricBoehlert @JenelleEason @catmonkey22 @LdyDirectr YEP, and his kool-aid drinkers haven't yet figured out trump doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself and M/Billionaire friends.
862323885512900608 2017-05-10 15:10:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Liz_Wheeler OMG trump voters can't differentiate that trump fired an FBI guy INVESTIGATING HIM based on a RECUSED AG's say so.  #dunningkruger
862322275881631744 2017-05-10 15:03:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorBurr all huff & puff about #ComeyFiring.  They will not demand an independent committee.  Again @GOP puts party 1st
862321418200989696 2017-05-10 15:00:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr as expected, you're all huff and puff and pretend to put country before party but don't want an independent committee. Shame on U #COMPLICIT
862320357901950976 2017-05-10 14:56:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ManMet80 @puppymnkey Putin ordered trump to do that, IMO.
862320191451021313 2017-05-10 14:55:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenateMajLdr is complicit in the #trumprussia coverup with behavior like this.https://twitter.com/Impeach_D_Trump/status/862308542409211904
862315138132488194 2017-05-10 14:35:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jdeau9 I'm concerned about McCabe.  He told Preibus he could say, "senior intelligence officials" discredited the story"http://www.businessinsider.com/is-it-illegal-unethical-white-house-fbi-knock-down-media-reports-russia-investigation-2017-2
862313803798556672 2017-05-10 14:30:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @KellyannePolls @jimsciutto she also claimed a fake massacre and said there's cameras in microwaves.  When will @CNN learn that skank makes them FAKE NEWS?
862313142591774720 2017-05-10 14:27:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Susan_Hennessey @CNN hasn't figured out that many people turn the TV off when Conway, Kayleigh, Paris or Jeffrey Lord come on the air.
862310287805865984 2017-05-10 14:16:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr America loves the smell of trump and stone terror in the morning....
862309078156038144 2017-05-10 14:11:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @KeithGiesler another idiot that can't see that the guy being investigated fires the guy investigating him based on recommendation of a recused guy.
862305255907667968 2017-05-10 13:56:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump @LouiseMensch @DrDenaGrayson @traciemac_Bmore and enquiring minds want to know why is he watching Fake News CNN?
862302076713357313 2017-05-10 13:43:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CatchaRUSSpy @ellewoodsruns @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch CatchaRusFly is a joke.
862300318914101249 2017-05-10 13:36:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Liar says what?
862300041695813633 2017-05-10 13:35:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump NO it won't settle down.  Because EVERYONE knows the ONLY reason you fired him is the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation.  Comey is coming for U now!
862299282958712833 2017-05-10 13:32:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP will continue to help Putin pillage USA.  They are complicit in the systematic dismantling of democracy that Putin is perpetrating.
862189927957540864 2017-05-09 06:17:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> please tell us that Mike Flynn Jr. is going to Grand Jury, too!   @TrueFactsStated or @LouiseMensch have any info on that?https://twitter.com/Bentelligence/status/862167198277795840
862189462595358720 2017-05-09 06:16:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr we'll see if you are a true patriot or just a whole lot of huffing and puffing like John McCain is.  An independent committee is now URGENT.
862186523092934656 2017-05-09 06:04:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk @fige1000 @CivilSocShirts @markbland @Starteller +1
862185153044529152 2017-05-09 05:58:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Jeffrey fucking Lord is on @CNN.  Time to change the channel.  Too bad.  I like @AC360 but will NOT tolerate trump LIARS and spinners.
862184366658568192 2017-05-09 05:55:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump the saner part of America loves the smell of your terror.  You have sealed your fate with this BIGLY strategic blunder.
862182851868975104 2017-05-09 05:49:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @HillaryClinton @Jeanette4Trump the guy that claimed to fire her was the liar.   He did NOT fire her.http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/zeifman.asp
862181538774999040 2017-05-09 05:44:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ColinHanks @RyanLizza trump is everything that is wrong in the world.  Anyone that can't see that needs the shrink.
862180548529094656 2017-05-09 05:40:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DebraMessing @RyanLizza @jemfinanderson We are now officially those frogs in the water.  The water just got much warmer.
862178764687499264 2017-05-09 05:33:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jeeniya90 @thomascro83 they were calling for his firing in the Fall, not in the middle of the investigation.  Secret GJ's have been sitting.
862177037636718592 2017-05-09 05:26:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Comey firing was probably celebrated by Ryan, McConnell, Nunes and anyone that was intercepted with Kislyak or used RNC hacked info.
862176628377501698 2017-05-09 05:25:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Comey firing shows how dangerous trump is.  All judicial norms are gone.  None of the fired judges replaced.  400+ vacant appointments.
862176268346732544 2017-05-09 05:23:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Comey firing will allow many @GOP to breath a sigh of relief.  There will be no uprising. There will be no outrage. They are safe from FBI
862174348748115968 2017-05-09 05:15:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC will be the greatest posers, as usual.https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/862091164102647808
862173895868076032 2017-05-09 05:14:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @Resisting_Rebel @SenWarren the mindless deplorables buy his LIES on this front.
862173470519508993 2017-05-09 05:12:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @THC1 @shannoncoulter thank you Shannon.  That makes perfect sense why we suddenly saw her after months of GLORIOUS absence.

862169970444165120 2017-05-09 04:58:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @PIN1077 NOT in the middle of an investigation into the very guy that fired him on the recommendation of the LIAR that had to recuse himself.  BYE
862169525608894465 2017-05-09 04:56:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @PIN1077 oh please stop with the party bull shit.  Just as many republicans are outraged at the timing of this firing.
862169130543177729 2017-05-09 04:55:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @PIN1077 Google GLOMAR.
862168682033577984 2017-05-09 04:53:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @eugene_kane he'll think it was a gang war in one of the inner cities
862167897967165441 2017-05-09 04:50:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Saturday Night Massacre" has nothing on trump's Tuesday takedown.
862167062239625216 2017-05-09 04:47:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @PIN1077 trump firing him now only makes it look like he's covering up the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation.   Likely, he has hastened his impeachment!
862166006273163264 2017-05-09 04:42:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr Thank you, Sir.  For the good of the nation, please demand an Independent Council to carry on Mr. Comey's investigation.  #SaveDemocracy
862156779718705152 2017-05-09 04:06:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MELANIATRUMP must hurry to stash away some money.  #Manypeoplearesaying  RICO is going to strip every penny that trump owns.
862156302683852800 2017-05-09 04:04:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @KeithOlbermann @ShimonPro @TrueFactsStated @cherylhe Yes, but Keith gave credit to Claude. @CNN claiming to break this story is an insult to the 100's of thousands of readers that know better.
862151484116320256 2017-05-09 03:45:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NewYorkFBI @dcpoll @LouiseMensch @themistocles_w allegedly he's the guy that advised the WH to get out in front of the bad press.  According to Maddow, NOT a good sign.
862150037823832064 2017-05-09 03:39:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated @tribelaw "If Ryan has any integrity"   That ship sailed a long time ago...Nunes fiasco was the epitome of an example of that

862147634529566720 2017-05-09 03:29:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorBurr AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION IS THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL SAVE U.S.A.  Country before party, Mr. Burr!  Before it is too late.
862147296867241984 2017-05-09 03:28:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html  here is the REAL reason for the firing.  MORE Grand Juries to come.    #impeachTrumpnow #TrumpRussiaCollusion
862146852677799937 2017-05-09 03:26:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @DoctorDerb @senoritaDOS http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html @TrueFactsStated reported this a couple weeks ago despite @CNN false claim they have the "exclusive".
862146455661760513 2017-05-09 03:25:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @senoritaDOS @DoctorDerb Grand Jury for Flynn and associates to start imminently.  1 is finished, 1 underway.  RICO to come out of NY State.  Patience grasshopper.
862143116849037313 2017-05-09 03:11:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Karoli @HeerJeet and YES
862142702414028800 2017-05-09 03:10:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @senoritaDOS @DoctorDerb Stay tuned. You'll see it soon enough.
862142131384840193 2017-05-09 03:07:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @PIN1077 He should have been fired by Obama in late October.  Firing him now is clearly because of Grand Jury trials that are in full swing!
862140591408271363 2017-05-09 03:01:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS All this winning must be so much fun for you said no one ever!
862140220723965952 2017-05-09 03:00:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS I see you know that Schumer has called an emergency meeting of all Dem Senators.  They're coming for YOU!!!
862122368788975616 2017-05-09 01:49:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch I love that the specifics coming out.  CNN reporting the GJ with "sources" tells us all we need to know about the current crisis in USA
862105787660763136 2017-05-09 00:43:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee John, do you think there's any chance that another country is going to leak a damning recording now?
862102245319495680 2017-05-09 00:29:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @sarahkendzior @joe_kehoskie UM, he and the major players with him were NOT under investigation for what might be treasonous acts.  NO comparison whatsoever!
862101673648324609 2017-05-09 00:27:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> #FBIDirector firing is the most egregious act trump has taken.  #resist America as we must stop this kleptocracy.  Time is running out!

862035850493706242 2017-05-09 20:05:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @VisualCap @TCS_Mark Yes, so I've got a good idea.  Let's piss Canada off and threaten to tear up #NAFTA  What a buffoon trump is!
862033419244519424 2017-05-09 19:55:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PressSec slags Yates saying she's not effective.  ROFL.  FBI interviews Flynn, then Yates comes over the very next day.are everywhere!
862031976491999233 2017-05-09 19:50:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mviser Say what?  Did paid liar AKA @PressSec tell yet another lie for the Liar in Chief?
862031397971566592 2017-05-09 19:47:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PressSec you keep calling it the "lawful order".  It wasn't lawful.  The judges ruled it unlawful...just like Yates deemed it to be!
862030897100374016 2017-05-09 19:45:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated @HecallsmePortia Maddow is the best hour on TV followed by Lawrence, the 2nd best hour IMO.
862028583878803456 2017-05-09 19:36:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @WhiteStanSmiths hard to tell that by your two totally unrelated (to the conversation) and undecipherable tweets...hence my question about the acid.
862027705759391744 2017-05-09 19:33:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @seanspicer says Sally Yates is a political opponent.  OMG the absolute vileness and viciousness of this WH is astounding.  #Impeach45
861985893778837504 2017-05-09 16:47:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TurnTNBlue @tedlieu Yet they continue to use his past statements to convince dumb Americans there is no collusion with Russia
861985336133537792 2017-05-09 16:44:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> YEP, Bernie is NO Democrat.  Unti and unless Dems wake up to this fact he will ensure the Republicans win again. https://twitter.com/mfore0142/status/861985012262088705
861985002241773568 2017-05-09 16:43:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @WhiteStanSmiths too much acid in your high school days?
861983079308476417 2017-05-09 16:35:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump months ago most of your replies and retweets were your followers, now its all people that despise you and see you for the con you are!
861978127450292226 2017-05-09 16:16:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump had best seek asylum in RU on his upcoming trip.  It will be far better than a jail cell.https://twitter.com/foreignpolicy77/status/861976883348549633
861966279124459520 2017-05-09 15:29:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JulianAssange @LouiseMensch @GLincoln14 and then he gets to decide if he wants to step out the doors and be tried for espionage against the USA...
861964944429916162 2017-05-09 15:23:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GenFlynn @washingtonpost @CherylHeide @LouiseMensch @reluctantzealot @johwri @emgrinolds would E.P. apply to Flynn? Or just trump?
861964249135894528 2017-05-09 15:21:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenWhitehouse @JohnWDean @GenFlynn @washingtonpost @LouiseMensch @DrDenaGrayson @RWNemanich YEP, McGahn should be the very next witness to call.  @AdamSchiffCA
861960982792257536 2017-05-09 15:08:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GenFlynn @BradMossEsq @MarkSZaidEsq @LouiseMensch @susandbarry the evidence was also a tool to show them who else might have been implicated in the intercepted convos with Flynn/Putin.
861956455183728640 2017-05-09 14:50:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @peterelkind @ProPublica @JessicaHuseman @pkentma EXACTLY!  the big pretender that says he wants to do the right thing yet does nothing except steer questions to Huma instead of Russia.
861955287938244609 2017-05-09 14:45:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mgl_8 @TrueFactsStated @WhimperNotABang yes, but one gets you a subpoena and announcement that the FBI investigation is re-opened and one doesn't.
861954513229430784 2017-05-09 14:42:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> the difference is that @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn are cowards and Yates is a patriot.  SHE puts country before party.  @GOP doesn't.https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd/status/861706410048008192
861952826800431104 2017-05-09 14:35:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @coopah @realDonaldTrump behavior is of a Putin puppet and has denigrated or smeared anyone and everyone EXCEPT Putin.  #TrumpRussiaCollusion
861952137047048192 2017-05-09 14:32:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GenFlynn @DevinNunes @LouiseMensch do we know who installed Mike Flynn into trump's org?
861951669805785089 2017-05-09 14:31:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated @CatharineLawton Exactly!  Yates visit and FBI questioning should be sufficient cause to fire him! They wanted to know who else was implicated.  PERIOD.
861949718632341504 2017-05-09 14:23:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @WhiteStanSmiths 1. he wasn't working so had NO access to any TS info  2. if they met with him to query past issues he'd know about, he needed his clearance.
861948521145958401 2017-05-09 14:18:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr    You will wear trump for decades.  History will NOT be kind to you.   #Impeach45https://twitter.com/TheLastWord/status/861792879903223810
861947576332857345 2017-05-09 14:14:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GeorgeTakei the answer is simple.  Flynn was "installed" because of those very ties to the Russians.  Pence was also installed by Manafort.
861945877589401600 2017-05-09 14:08:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RayRLibrandi Yep, and many don't even care if they're spreading outright lies because we know he had a tax write-off for years and years.
861945434633150464 2017-05-09 14:06:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @aliasvaughn @nytimes @Truth_Wins trump is going to be right about the "failing" NY Times.  They're losing subscribers and chased new ones (myself included) away.
861941965809528833 2017-05-09 13:52:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated Yep, @maddow nails it night after night.  @MSNBC is going to lose a LOT of viewers if they bring over any more Fox/trump talking heads.
861941447490023424 2017-05-09 13:50:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @thehill @Hawk195754 we wouldn't expect you to know or care that trump just pissed off the biggest importer of USA goods.  #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #impeach45
861938981331546112 2017-05-09 13:40:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JulianAssange the guy accused of rape is worried about patriarchy after spending months leaking everything he can to help trump win the election.  YCMTSU
861937512800964609 2017-05-09 13:34:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @CNN @MSNBC have to call trump team on the BS that it's Obama's fault trump didn't vet Flynn.  ONLY trump is responsible for that.
861936921525628928 2017-05-09 13:32:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated she's the only one I've heard say this.  Nobody else on TV will go there.  Sad.
861732474119835648 2017-05-08 00:00:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nakashimae @LouiseMensch @mycaristan fuck off Svetlana
861723538226528256 2017-05-08 23:24:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @InSpiteOfTrump @JoyAnnReid Yes.  Yes, he did.  @GOP will wear trump and this debacle for decades.  What an embarrassment.
861722753027657728 2017-05-08 23:21:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JackKingston Yates obliterated Cruz.  Totally and completely obliterated him.  You're deluded if you think otherwise.
861722316350169088 2017-05-08 23:19:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump another big story is that there are SEVERAL FBI investigations going on.  RICO is going to strip ALL your money away.  #RICO #impeach
861721898509508608 2017-05-08 23:18:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump the biggest story today is that the insane so-called potus is tweeting because he is panicked that the FBI has a RICO investigation going on
861721624914960384 2017-05-08 23:17:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump more people watched Sally Yates today than watched YOUR inauguration.  Believe me!
861721318898548736 2017-05-08 23:15:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the hoax. YOU!
861720819763785728 2017-05-08 23:13:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 18 days you knew Flynn was compromised and you did NOTHING. That's huge news that McGann didn't think it was significant Flynn LIED.
861720360042979328 2017-05-08 23:11:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump she schooled the Republicans today.  Plain and simple.  SCHOOLED THEM. Mike Pencekov is the leak many people are saying.
861719611754008576 2017-05-08 23:09:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump AFTER the FBI and AG (TWICE) told your WH council that you had a compromised man (FLYNN) as NSA you didn't fire him for EIGHTEEN DAYS.
861719314570686464 2017-05-08 23:07:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump NOPE she pointed out many things, one was that your WH council didn't care that YOUR NSA was a LIAR.
861717513834438656 2017-05-08 23:00:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump the hoax is that YOU scam MILLIONS with your alleged wife staying in NY.   #EmolumentsClause #impeachTrumpnow #TrumpRussiaCollusion
861717377091747840 2017-05-08 23:00:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump the hoax is that YOU scam MILLIONS by staying at Mar-A-Lagov.  #EmolumentsClause #impeachTrumpnow #TrumpRussiaCollusion
861717063382859776 2017-05-08 22:58:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Orange kool-aid drinking Americans are being scammed out of MILLIONS of tax dollars paying for you to golf every weekend!  #EmolumentsClause
861716697115279360 2017-05-08 22:57:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the hoax!  You're a pathologically lying D bag that never takes responsibility for YOUR mistakes.  Resign.  And delete your account!
861716307108012034 2017-05-08 22:55:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the tax funded charade.  Mar-A-Lagov costs and keeping your estranged wife in NY is wasting MILLIONS.  #impeachTrumpnow #Trumprussia
861713205604700160 2017-05-08 22:43:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the only fake news.  You're a LIAR, a conman, a fake and a scammer. #Trumprussia #impeach #ResistTrump
861712700446867457 2017-05-08 22:41:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump now we learned Obama told you not to hire him in November.  Now we know why you're lying and blaming him for YOUR failures. AGAIN!
861712440022540289 2017-05-08 22:40:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump you spent 8 years denigrating him and accused him of starting ISIS now you want to blame HIM for YOU not vetting Flynn.  NICE FUCKING TRY!
861687814563307520 2017-05-08 21:02:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> losing #SallyYates as Attorney General is a tragic loss to the country.  What a brilliant, well spoken, classy woman!
861686969721434112 2017-05-08 20:59:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP @SenateMajLdr shame on Republicans.  Just shame on them.https://twitter.com/Green_Footballs/status/861681876708098049
861685356898418688 2017-05-08 20:52:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AriMelber @ehlers5150_tom YEP, and people (Marion Jones) that lied about taking steroids have gone to jail.  National security should be more important...
861669798110822400 2017-05-08 19:51:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "DNI Clapper"  OH MY OH MY  Clapper admits that sensitive information between RU and trump team WAS intercepted by various EU countries.
861665462454595584 2017-05-08 19:33:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Sally Yates" - WH council wanted to know why it matters if one WH official lies to another WH official.    OMFG they're SO corrupt!
861659556585156608 2017-05-08 19:10:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk @ImaginePeace5 @beachie_blonde cannot confirm or deny
861658961899954176 2017-05-08 19:08:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid @jmmc1322 BOTH!
861658664653869057 2017-05-08 19:06:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @heatherclark55 @JoyAnnReid but, importantly, they admitted THEY WERE WARNED!
861658167415001088 2017-05-08 19:04:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LyndaPole @jrpsaki this is important as trump team continues to blame Obama for trump incompetencies.
861655670575177728 2017-05-08 18:54:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch koolaid drinkers frequently ignore this fact as does the WH.
861655439578062849 2017-05-08 18:54:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> #SallyYates  Clapper confirms AGAIN that some Republicans hacked.  NO coincidence that Wikilaughs didn't leak anything against R's.
861651647893618688 2017-05-08 18:38:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> love the sign behind the current speaker at the #senatehearing
861646887111106560 2017-05-08 18:20:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> OH MY!  It just gets worse and worse for trump each day.  What lies will they make @PressSec come up with now?https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/861643841182597120
861646252286418944 2017-05-08 18:17:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind @abracadabraNY I have so much to do but can't tear myself away to do it.
861646070010347520 2017-05-08 18:16:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @seanspicer Perpetuating the LIE that trump isn't responsible for Flynn vetting is ludicrous.  Yates ALSO warned trump about Flynn! #impeach

861633137524314112 2017-05-08 17:25:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Installed" is the correct word.  Many of the people surrounding trump have also been "installed".https://twitter.com/TrueFactsStated/status/861579688757612548

861627241939124224 2017-05-08 17:01:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Today we learned Obama WARNED you not to hire Flynn.  Now we understand your terror induced middle of the night tweet.    #Trumprussia
861625820749586432 2017-05-08 16:56:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump and Obama warned YOU to NOT hire him!  Extreme vetting failure on YOUR part.  #Trumprussia #Impeach45
861625606332588032 2017-05-08 16:55:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump and Obama FIRED him!  As usual YOUR "extreme vetting" failed AGAIN.  Quit blaming Obama for every epic fail YOU experience.   #Trumprussia

861606495057625088 2017-05-08 15:39:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> OOPS.  #ImpeachTrump  CNN reporting that Obama warned trump about hiring Misha Flynn but trump hired him anyways.   Trump-Russia
861392484219273216 2017-05-07 01:29:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump I see you're waking up in the middle of the night with terror sweats AGAIN cuz you know the noose is tightening.  #Impeach45 #trumprussia

860278268850692096 2017-05-04 23:41:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @SadisticMark LOL, I guess you should let Comey know he was a fool to hire an additional 20 agents to work on the file.  Better hurry!

858100863331586048 2017-04-28 23:29:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> viewers that have made @maddow the top rated show want to know why @MSNBC is bringing trump liars and spinners to their station. #BOYCOTThttps://twitter.com/KaraCalavera/status/858093575661391872

858082402568093696 2017-04-28 22:16:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Yes.  Yes we do.  Get the EFF out.
858080281730797568 2017-04-28 22:07:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hughhewitt @yashar @MSNBC had better rethink these types of hires or they'll lose viewers.  @CNN lost us because of Lord, Conway and Kayleigh.
858079608771444740 2017-04-28 22:04:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind absolutely everything the black people in the WH did will be eliminated.  Every. Last. Thing.

857806446670393348 2017-04-27 03:59:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane IMO the deception with payments and non-registering was all part of the grand scheme and is all related.  Time will tell.

857797296326459392 2017-04-27 03:23:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane um, for me the best outcome is that that bastard never sees the light of day again.  He's a traitor through and through, in my opinion.
857794513896488960 2017-04-27 03:12:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @connie_rodeconn look on the bright side.  He could get his rotten bottom teeth fixed for free in jail.

857745995127341056 2017-04-27 23:59:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch Peter's last minute million dollar donation to trump campaign makes more sense now.  He bought a piece of the guaranteed action, too.

857617655791931392 2017-04-27 15:29:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @davidstalane dude, if he secretly worked AGAINST USA then throw the fucking book at him. He's a General, not a GD minion.  He can ROT in jail. LOCKhimUP!
857616388902445056 2017-04-27 15:24:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane stupidity is not a crime, otherwise most of America would be in jail.  Treason is punishable by death.

857610611223543809 2017-04-27 15:01:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane making a mistake is forgetting to pick up milk on the way home.  Ongoing deception and lying is well calculated and planned.
857610021017866240 2017-04-27 14:58:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane he's a 3 star General.  He, of all people, should be fighting to save USA not working against it.  Throw the book at him, IMO.
857608795572260866 2017-04-27 14:54:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @davidstalane no, he should spend longer in jail than drug dealers and bank robbers

854163987860082688 2017-04-17 02:45:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @ryan_trollip @kslgoblue84 due to thousands of replies she also has notifications turned off so unless she reads your question in her TL she won't get the notice.
854162479957463040 2017-04-17 02:39:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @funder @TheDemCoalition @NathanLerner he didn't just let it happen, his LIES and "running to tell the potus" was all part of one big cover-up.  He is complicit.
854156849767002112 2017-04-17 02:17:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated IMO, Ryan would have fired Nunes from HIC if he wasn't up to his ears in complicity.

854077901246877697 2017-04-17 21:03:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MizReyRey if they knowingly used hacked data.... And why did Mitch's wife get a plumb gig from trump? Why did Ryan let Nunes LIE and NOT fire him???
854070439978557440 2017-04-17 20:33:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mike_pence @LouiseMensch @cpicciolini he's backed the lying Nunes for a reason and hasn't removed him from the HIC panel.  He also likely used hacked DNC data to win his riding.
853412672368386050 2017-04-15 01:00:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I save Louise to the last.  Her TL is like the fine cigarette after a good dinner.https://twitter.com/schumik7777/status/853320253614563332

852699693364551680 2017-04-13 01:47:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaxineWaters @hlthiskrieger @Kitdupree @ILoveHillaryC sadly, the anti-abortionists don't give a shit about women's lives or if they forego paps and mamos they only want to stop abortions. PERIOD
852699286663974913 2017-04-13 01:45:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaxineWaters @hlthiskrieger @Kitdupree I don't think you're trying to understand.  Clinics are FOR PROFIT businesses OWNED by doctors.  PP is NON-PROFIT to help women!
852697932964835329 2017-04-13 01:40:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> why do libraries get funding for books and not every person that wants to compete with them?https://twitter.com/Kitdupree/status/852697514478374912
852697132741959680 2017-04-13 01:36:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MaxineWaters @hlthiskrieger @Kitdupree obviously a man.  They do pap tests, mammograms, pre-natal care, advise, etc. Many PP are in small towns with NO hospitals nearby.
852696310771666944 2017-04-13 01:33:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @PolHistMaven Certainly NOT defending CNN as I was pissed they cut him off given he was talking about WL but @CNN had a boner for the bomb going off.

852683884516982785 2017-04-13 00:44:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mikedebonis @msla07 We all witnessed what a chicken he was when he cowered to the Mexican President and then lied to Americans afterwards.

852678238526595072 2017-04-13 00:21:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @InSpiteOfTrump @SenSanders indeed, what a shame you spent WEEKS very nastily denigrating HRC when it was mathematically IMPOSSIBLE for you to win the primaries.

852674619370647553 2017-04-13 00:07:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mfrost11 @LouiseMensch @TheDailyBail absolutely not true.  And, yes, we do read all of her tweets.
852673449046573056 2017-04-13 00:02:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @olgaNYC1211 if he's the one that announced a pre-emptive strike on NK that NSC and all are frantically trying to take back he may be gone for that.
852551872741244928 2017-04-13 15:59:40 UTC <TrueFactsStated> Just getting this. A source is telling me that two countries' Intel agencies have handed over audio of Trump kids-criminal acts on tape.

852662425593667585 2017-04-13 23:18:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @LouiseMensch @AsteroidEarth exactly.  And (apart from the co-conspirators) I'm sure nobody saw the Comey letter coming which totally sandbagged her.
852661545272201216 2017-04-13 23:15:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @LouiseMensch agree it makes 44 look bad.  But imagine the outrage if he said anything.  It would look like Birther revenge and political ploy.
852660032315432960 2017-04-13 23:09:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mmpadellan @vidalexperience @No_Sheep_Here Flynn fired. Sessions lying under oath, Nunes lying to world, Page fired, Manafort fired should be your first clues @ruKus211 #Trumprussia

852252389969059840 2017-04-12 20:09:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> NATO   Vets are coming for you @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP for letting this travesty of a POTUS continue.https://twitter.com/votevets/status/852177101532913664
852251490529886208 2017-04-12 20:06:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ABC well @realDonaldTrump can't lift sanctions now given #OperationPothole and all the @IvankaTrump crocodile tears about the kids
852251057707114496 2017-04-12 20:04:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @goldengateblond I call it extreme vetting right?  Extreme vetting.  I want extreme. It's going to be so tough.    Flynn fired, Manafort gone.  Page gone...
852249735180173313 2017-04-12 19:59:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated or have their lawyers advised them to get ALL of their affairs in order?
852249455181012992 2017-04-12 19:57:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jaketapper @StopTrumpRegime then he freezes gov't hiring so vets can't get jobs and daycare on bases across US got closed down cuz they couldn't hire .
852248698918625280 2017-04-12 19:54:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @dcpoll You fill out the forms and send them in when you get a contract.  Either you did or didn't.  Which is it @PaulManafort?
852247675730673664 2017-04-12 19:50:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk @barboncape Americans that see through their facade and know this is all about the oil
852227333184290816 2017-04-12 18:30:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @InSpiteOfTrump @kylegriffin1 ...and he liked the beautiful chocolate cake.
852227127231430656 2017-04-12 18:29:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mitchellreports @kylegriffin1 @BalmyBalmer YEP, she was top 2 or 3 for non-stop HRC email and negative coverage.  On non-Fox stations that is.
852226389071626240 2017-04-12 18:26:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GideonResnick looks like breasts...just saying.
852224817524690944 2017-04-12 18:20:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GreatDismal @NYCMayor @1N4R0551 if he did put the art there without permission then the city would consider it a "donation" and can do with it what they like.
852217059224178688 2017-04-12 17:49:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jmartNYT @ShaneGoldmacher @pattirmuller I know. He's going paranoid. He also claims he was poisoned with polonium and a hit and run attempt on his life was made.  #nightsweats
852215780250796032 2017-04-12 17:44:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> when you know almost 2 months ahead of time that some stolen data (Podesta) is coming, then expect the FBI to come after you.  ROFL.
852215099532091392 2017-04-12 17:41:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jmartNYT @ShaneGoldmacher Priceless.  He bragged about talking to Putin puppet, Assange, of Wikileaks and is now complaining about the IC monitoring that.
852213611246137344 2017-04-12 17:35:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @brianklaas @kalbzayn they were only janitors...
852212488070250496 2017-04-12 17:31:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch only a fool would declare this normal.  closing out the US press after election interference only further proves the RU ties.
852211148095201283 2017-04-12 17:25:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TeaPainUSA yep, people are saying it's a 2 fold leak: 1. Page gets off scott free cuz of leak 2. trump will fire Comey blaming the leak on him.
852210585345421312 2017-04-12 17:23:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TeaPainUSA is that why @20committee called Manafort Pauly Walnut?
852210231652298752 2017-04-12 17:22:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @selectedwisdom @milenaac @close2reality @OmarAslamLugo @redboybroken wouldn't surprise me if one of Rudy's pals in the FBI could arrange this to set Comey up.
852206768688164864 2017-04-12 17:08:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tmmckinney777 @tedlieu expecting @SpeakerRyan to put country before @GOP is like expecting trump to suddenly start telling the truth.  It isn't going to happen.
852205124525195264 2017-04-12 17:01:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> a lot of ass covering going on with trump players.https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/852197811491934208
852204794785792000 2017-04-12 17:00:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @milenaac @OmarAslamLugo true, maybe FBI declared the yapping as declassifying and FBI is using WaPo as their means to turn them against each other?
852201143887417344 2017-04-12 16:46:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @BoycottTrumpFor He better get a team of lawyers if FINCEN is finding Swift trails to the Ukraine involving Yanukovych money.   #FollowTheMoney #Trumprussia
852197281071861761 2017-04-12 16:30:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @kylegriffin1 OMG i thought you were joking with the beautiful piece of chocolate cake quote.
852196580891512836 2017-04-12 16:27:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @milenaac @redboybroken @OmarAslamLugo do you think all the yapping trump did about being "tapped" has in essence declassified the FISAs?
852195277897424897 2017-04-12 16:22:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @WSJ @jonfavs I'll watch out my window for the proverbial pigs to fly by...

852182518770147331 2017-04-12 15:31:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @Dumptrump1939 after reading John's article hedging is probably better.  deep sigh.
852182136769720323 2017-04-12 15:30:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> i'd trade a lifetime of birthday, Christmas and any other presents to see him in an orange jumpsuit.https://twitter.com/ucla_007/status/852179639166423041
852181505178828800 2017-04-12 15:27:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @kushkandy95 @20committee depressing to read that enthusiasm for him going to jail (let alone dying there) is done and that we're all to lower our expectations.
852178034060918784 2017-04-12 15:14:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @Dumptrump1939 I'd double down on that bet!
852176245395783680 2017-04-12 15:07:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RussianEmbassy @LouiseMensch @20committee @CatchaRUSSpy so I guess you feel the same way about the expert that testified at the hearing?  He said the same thing Louise did.
852158295309766657 2017-04-12 13:55:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind and in one case it's a double whammy, the money was to buy 501 computers.  Apparently, it takes a lot of computers to get your bot on.
852151476050853888 2017-04-12 13:28:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @BraddJaffy oh my.  In a real life game of survivor, barring polonium tea drinking, I see Manafort as the one winning the immunity idol.  #trumprussia
852146219430408194 2017-04-12 13:07:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I see "Chris Christie" trending and think they've "locked him up".  sigh.

852021698664644609 2017-04-11 04:52:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PissedEgg funny we were just talking about this.  Here's an interesting perspective. http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/outing-fbi-carter-page-trump-russia-had/2283/
852019712728850437 2017-04-11 04:45:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @PissedEgg YEP, he'd probably have more on trump than Flynn would as to the election ties to Russia & Flynn would have info on removing sanctions
852019166248787969 2017-04-11 04:42:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> YEP, this wasn't even a dog whistle it was so blatant.  I'm sure Richard Spencer and the Neo Nazis were high fiving all around .https://twitter.com/funder/status/851872300668473344

852005130740277248 2017-04-11 03:47:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> oh no, @GOP will be shitting themselves that trump has taken one of their safest seats and made it close.  This is a big step for Dems #KS04
852003552432082944 2017-04-11 03:40:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk this is news.
852001999742619648 2017-04-11 03:34:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Shayevanslive I see @realDonaldTrump is on a YUGE #winning streak this week said no one ever!

851991782749548544 2017-04-11 02:54:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @srmicksims "There is something else planned" okay now you're teasing us like Jester does.  Can you give us a hint?
851989273138139136 2017-04-11 02:44:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jeffsessions @patribotics @LouiseMensch @barret_williams frightening isn't it?  And Nunes saying he didn't know who Roger Stone was is just mind boggling.
851982128007041026 2017-04-11 02:15:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @lehimesa @JoyAnnReid Sigh. Betsy De Vos has a LOT of work to do to educate Americans.  Please can you start with the guy that speaks for the WH?
851952749243748352 2017-04-11 00:18:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Midwood49 do you feel the same way about people in contact with ISIS or just those that have been in contact with KNOWN RUSSIAN SPIES?
851951746733813761 2017-04-11 00:14:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @waldograce PhD = Putin Helps Donnie ?

851951117378490369 2017-04-11 00:12:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DBloom451 "weaponizing" ROFL considering Page was Male 1 in a 2013 court case with RUSSIAN SPIES - one convicted and 2 sent home.  everywhere.

851948939699990528 2017-04-11 00:03:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @washingtonpost @KcNightfire my pool: carter, Manafort, stone are the outsiders.  Flynn is the inside (swamp) guy with RU link.
851945717618937856 2017-04-11 23:51:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @brithume @zlturner @NotReallyABear2 Cops don't like being told what to do.  Not ever.  They're hardly the submissive types that dutifully obey...or need 800 bucks that bad.
851943924973412352 2017-04-11 23:43:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch you were looking at some of these earlier todayhttps://twitter.com/donaldbuffoon/status/831402691079262208
851937714278617088 2017-04-11 23:19:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ryanjreilly AKA gaslighting.
851923952062537728 2017-04-11 22:24:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jdl928 Yep, the fact that @GOP let him run under their banner is the most appalling.  They'll wear him for decades.
851922911216545792 2017-04-11 22:20:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @brithume @zlturner ROFL that you would have dutifully walked off that plane after having been seated and awaiting take off.  Not bloody likely.
851912696245100545 2017-04-11 21:39:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @UrbanAchievr the Nazi dog whistles are just getting louder, especially on days that are very important, like Seder and Holocaust Remembrance Day.

851888590392918016 2017-04-11 20:04:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @lisa_fletch @yashar MSM helps change the narrative to make the victim out to be the bad guy.  His history is IRRELEVANT here!  Except to excuse the police.....

851868941316087808 2017-04-11 18:45:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SethAbramson and then clarified that by saying, "ON HIS OWN PEOPLE".  You just can't make this up.  You just can't.

851836605421584388 2017-04-11 16:37:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ninaandtito it's a lot of money but in grand scheme a very small price to pay him to pull the deal off worth hundreds of billions.

851824971462475776 2017-04-11 15:51:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ninaandtito i'm betting the .5% is the finders fee and that Carter gets that fee in lieu of salary from trump campaign.  NOBODY works for free.  NOBODY.
851822708253798400 2017-04-11 15:42:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mgranville1 @neeratanden typical police ploy when they've assaulted or killed someone.  Dig into the victim's past to find IRRELEVANT and UNRELATED crap.  #Shame

851813123963015169 2017-04-11 15:04:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @bamluvsdmb so trump fired Flynn because of Seth Rich and Sessions, Kushner, Nunes, and everyone are all lying about Russia cuz of him.  Got it.
851812348239196162 2017-04-11 15:01:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @foxnation @Rchelle82277 @bamluvsdmb this has nothing to do with Obama's decisions, policies or ideology and ONLY about country before party.  Subverting democracy is at stake.

851809064786870274 2017-04-11 14:48:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @foxnation @Rchelle82277 @bamluvsdmb Flynn fired. Sessions lied under oath. Manafort gone. Nunes under investigation. Page (Male1) gone, McFarland sent to Singapore = RU TIES!!
851808086742319104 2017-04-11 14:44:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump @bamluvsdmb trump ties to mob characters and Russian oligarchs goes back for years.  Read my pinned tweet from July.  sadly MSM were 24/7 on her emails.

851802745937854466 2017-04-11 14:22:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RyanRuggiero "denied boarding" is an outright lie.  He was a paid and seated CUSTOMER that @united had FORCIBLY REMOVED from the plane.  #BOYCOTTUA

851797149637410816 2017-04-11 14:00:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @josieO this is exactly what they do when an unarmed person is killed by the police.  Drag up unrelated record from years earlier.  WE SEE YOU CP

851655856890314753 2017-04-10 04:39:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA yes, I think Putin lets them run amok as long as they deliver the goods when he comes calling.  World wide chaos works well for him.
851654248911716352 2017-04-10 04:32:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @politico @ericgeller @LouiseMensch hope the small blacked out areas are related to trump and that there's stuff they can use to leverage this guy, if so.
851653884498001920 2017-04-10 04:31:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @politico @ericgeller @LouiseMensch all the docs were pretty specific to malware, ransomware and spamming and signed in Alaska cuz they got hit hardest by ransomware.
851653388538216448 2017-04-10 04:29:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @TheRickWilson the recordings were enough to make one seek out a really high bridge...
851652718150139904 2017-04-10 04:26:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA it looks that way as the docs were all pretty specific.  I hope there's something they can use for leverage.
851646318359461889 2017-04-10 04:01:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA just read through all the docs.  Hope the (very small) blacked out parts are pertinent to #Trumprussia ties or they used his services.
851630136201887744 2017-04-10 02:57:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Kellyjorgense14 no. The saner part of America weeps.  The NRA whores and Infowars will call it a hoax and berate the parents, calling them actors and liars
851628542743912449 2017-04-10 02:50:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @VinnyTimEC @mcspocky @realDonaldTrump & President Bannon's first 100 days have been a colossal train wreck.  Can @IvankaTrump  put the elected guy in charge?
851627817129267200 2017-04-10 02:47:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jmsexton_ @DavidCornDC and they and FOX want Susan Rice locked up too.

851608932313317376 2017-04-10 01:32:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @timkmak right, but they chant "lock her up" about Hillary and declare Ms. Rice guilty in a blink of an eye.  @GOP needs to hand out barf bags...

851580789837799425 2017-04-10 23:40:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @badgirl_loony they want USA to think RU is an ally so trump won't/can't be indicted for treason with a foe or enemy
851575038008369152 2017-04-10 23:18:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NRA @GOP @realDonaldTrump @EmmaVigeland all these NRA whores that dare talk about being pro-life are liars and hypocritical pukes that have sold their souls for the almighty $$$.

851527087261237248 2017-04-10 20:07:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @NBCNews @jeanrrjones @BChaseCrawford @BernardJonathon if they were asked by a United Airlines employee to remove this man then they are acting as an "agent" of UA.
851524890234572800 2017-04-10 19:58:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @united the UA employee that ordered the 3 men onto the plane to forcibly remove the PAID CUSTOMER off the plane is complicit in this assault.
851524186702925824 2017-04-10 19:56:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @united I've got an idea, DON'T fucking oversell your seats to begin with and you won't have to DRAG people off the plane.  #BoycottUnitedAirlines

849732423268966400 2017-04-05 21:16:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> It'll kill me to miss them every night but I cannot endorse @MSNBC for how they're now covering Susan Rice INSTEAD of trump/RU scandal!!https://twitter.com/KaraDemocrat/status/849730080746156032
849731191796187136 2017-04-05 21:11:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @markberman His wife is Melania.  Ivanka is one of his daughters.  And Mike Cohen says,  "Says who"?
849729247379808256 2017-04-05 21:03:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MattMurph24 @imraansiddiqi idiots.  The false flag will be the train bomb in Russia not this one.  Infowar's collective IQ is room temperature, at best.
849728736219897856 2017-04-05 21:01:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MSNBC is now going ON AND ON AND ON AND ON about Susan Rice just like they did with HRC emails.   I'm done! I'll miss @maddow @TheLastWord

849722522316623872 2017-04-05 20:36:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> sadly, he's talking about the President (so-called) of the United States of America.  Let that marinate.https://twitter.com/CatmanTwenty/status/849721502974885888
849721723012341760 2017-04-05 20:33:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> this is the @GOP come true to vilify Susan Rice AGAIN.  Once was not enough, they've come back for more.  PIGS. Just vile pigs. ALL OF THEM! https://twitter.com/jbouie/status/849668549744492544
849720195115499520 2017-04-05 20:27:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrueFactsStated we can start a GoFundMe page to buy him an endless supply of buckets of greasy chicken...
849719639286337536 2017-04-05 20:25:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mitchellreports @TheObamanista @NBCNightlyNews @realDonaldTrump is POTUS (allegedly) and can declassify alleged "unmasked" Susan Rice documents to set the record straight.  WHY WON'T HE??
849716786475827200 2017-04-05 20:14:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 yep, I'm fine with them letting the bastards twist in the wind while they build their cases and #RICO strips the fuckers till they're broke.

849700953909415936 2017-04-05 19:11:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpysTaxes @TheRickWilson that's my guess, too!  They're next, followed by the 3rd leaker and the head WH council that gave them all permission for the Nunes coverup

849697210031898624 2017-04-05 18:56:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 ...or the web is so tangled it could take months.  Last week, we learned Carter Page admitted he is (male #1) in RU spy trial from 2013.
849693794719207424 2017-04-05 18:42:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 and at least 30 times he gave GLOMAR answers in regards to trump cronies...especially Roger Stone.
849693121868816384 2017-04-05 18:40:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 wrong.  He said they are investigation to see if any collusion happened (actually 3 pronged)  And he said Clapper did NOT HAVE his report.pic.twitter.com/VzrBmBgjDC
849689335008047106 2017-04-05 18:24:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LiberalJaxx I know, right?  I don't think any single person on CNN or MSNBC spent more time reporting negative reports on HRC than her.
849688650258542593 2017-04-05 18:22:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 2. the second SIC member that said, "I'll be surprised if people DON'T go to jail".   They had both just been in two days of closed hearings
849688309983064068 2017-04-05 18:20:54 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 1. and yesterday when one member of the SIC said, "I wouldn't be surprised if people go to jail" followed by...
849687888392368128 2017-04-05 18:19:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @julieblue917 i guess you missed the part where Comey said Clapper had not yet seen the report he had compiled.  Pay attention.
849687434656755712 2017-04-05 18:17:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA now he must fire Mike Ellis (Leaker 1) and Ezra Cohen-Watnick (2) and John Eisenberg(3) and McGann for approving NUNES cover-up.
849680882260627456 2017-04-05 17:51:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GenX4HRC @Amy_Siskind @grannyrosie3 This is important that he is no longer on the NSC.  Still needs to be gone but important.
849680188736589824 2017-04-05 17:48:37 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind @piedpenguin I'd bet a lot of money he orchestrated that whole debacle.  McMaster now needs to kick out the 2 or 3 guys that leaked docs to Nunes.
849679829414760453 2017-04-05 17:47:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amy_Siskind YEP, and now he'll kick out Ellis and Cohen-Watnick next.  If trump doesn't let him, he'll retire.
849677782019747840 2017-04-05 17:39:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @camanpour well I call BS.  he doesn't have a mind.

849674382360272896 2017-04-05 17:25:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> I'm gonna bet Bannon orchestrated Mike Ellis and Ezra Cohen-Watnick leak of classified information to Nunes.   Ellis and Ezra will be next.
849673899314827264 2017-04-05 17:23:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Libertyhound1 Bannon was appointed to NSC on Jan. 28th.  Flynn was NSA and fired on Feb 13th.  Bannon DID NOT replace Flynn.  LOL
849671124799471616 2017-04-05 17:12:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @elihbeckman there's still Ellis, Cohen-Watnick and the 3rd leaker to be kicked out of the WH...while we await impeachment

849653188261068800 2017-04-05 16:01:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @CanadiensFan he also claimed that someone poisoned him with polonium.
849648992820445184 2017-04-05 15:44:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "National Security Council" SO much #winning.   Flynn fired.  Walsh removed.  Nunes kills House investigation. Ellis and Ezra leak TS info
849648150230872065 2017-04-05 15:41:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> oh my.  president Bannon has been removed from NSC.  McMaster put his foot down?  @realDonaldTrump   so much #winning #Impeach45

849401973371797508 2017-04-04 23:23:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Flynn, Page (Male 1), Manafort, Eric Prince, Kushner, Sessions.  Am I forgetting anyone that met with Russians?
849400965707051010 2017-04-04 23:19:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> trump donor, Eric Prince, donated 1/4M and held secret meeting with Putin ally.  This scandal is getting bigger and bigger.

849331024639254528 2017-04-04 18:41:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @jcdwms @STSTWO @CindyMunz the uranium cannot leave USA. What bouncing ball is there to follow?  LOL.
849330853914267649 2017-04-04 18:40:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @STSTWO ROFL. There were dozens and dozens all the same.  Clearly facts don't matter to deplorables but spreading LIES does!

849321723036041221 2017-04-04 18:04:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @jcdwms Americans were *intercepted* talking to Russian foreign agents.  In order to understand the context of what's said IC UNMASK the US person
849310244723458049 2017-04-04 17:18:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> he called Putin yesterday to send his condolences on the train deaths.  Didn't hear any condolences in US bus crash last week! https://twitter.com/bentaub91/status/849309703179993088

849309046905688067 2017-04-04 17:13:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Monte_Alto @OmarAslamLugo but you know he stayed on the FBI person of interest list and when he hooked up with trump campaign,went up and FBI started watching.
849308268002410498 2017-04-04 17:10:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @consunite @52fairway trump kool-aid drinkers still don't get what's going on and how serious this is and how deep this went.

849134675486318592 2017-04-03 05:40:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AndyRichter @sofiarune @stealthygeek there's a reason he doesn't hire many Americans in Miami and hires foreign workers (modern day slaves) under strict contract.
849133769214709760 2017-04-03 05:37:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LofCentre I thought someone said at the time that you can buy the pattern.
849133500166844416 2017-04-03 05:36:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @janiszilly @TeaPainUSA ironic, social media got them into the WH and social media heroes are going to put them in the big house.

849120965074104320 2017-04-03 04:46:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @pierre please stop this stupidity.  @GOP didn't even have the decency to interview Garland.  Gorsuch wouldn't even agree to some Dem interviews.

849116729561063424 2017-04-03 04:29:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @justabadazz and then 3 years later you hook up with the guy under investigation for (WAIT FOR IT) coordinating with RUSSIA to interfere in election.

849114223095316481 2017-04-03 04:19:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch Louise, did you hear that Lara T. is going to be working with the WH, with Parscale's company?  Is she a computer geek? N.C. catfish story?

849054352543162369 2017-04-03 00:21:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TerriC122 funny, the guy you all loved in October (Comey) is now the guy you all don't trust.  Kind of like how trump loved Wikileaks now hates leaks.
849051882878259201 2017-04-03 00:11:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TerriC122 ya, I guess that's why the FBI has a THREE pronged investigation into trump/Russia ties. RICO will take him down.  Follow the money.
849051669899825154 2017-04-03 00:11:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump did Pence know that Flynn maybe talked to Russia to lift the sanctions?  Did trump know?
849051400269058048 2017-04-03 00:10:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump were trump hires Manafort or Page paid big money (1/2% of Rosneft) to get the sanctions on Russia lifted?  Did trump know?
849050730518290433 2017-04-03 00:07:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Was the fired NSA head, FLYNN, trump paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did trump know?
849050375030054913 2017-04-03 00:05:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump was the Son-in-Law of trump paid big money to get the sanctions lifted on Russia?  Did trump know?
849050002127110144 2017-04-03 00:04:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> yes, sadly they've not bothered to fact-find as to why/what causes someone to be unmasked by NSA.  Fox feeds the LIES.  @GOP owns trump!https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/849049427214036992
849049359375187969 2017-04-03 00:01:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TerriC122 NO, Terry, the trump/russia story is growing by the day.  Even some of the most ardent trump voters are beginning to connect the dots.

849038691280445440 2017-04-03 23:19:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky FFS.  STOP LYING  CANADA sold a stake in a company whose property is in USA to a RU company.  http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/16/trump-claims--falsely--that-clinton-gave-russia-20-of-us-uranium.html
849038016400117760 2017-04-03 23:16:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky please, please, please stop with the LIE that HRC sold the uranium.  It simply isn't true.  I'm done on that LIE.  BYE NOW.
849037204730945536 2017-04-03 23:13:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ealight461 @mikefarb1 Hence: elect a clown, expect a circus.

849036234680786944 2017-04-03 23:09:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @bamanicky OMG dude.  Get out of the FOX echo chamber.  Start with my pinned WaPo from JULY.  There's dozens of stories out there.
849035559901081601 2017-04-03 23:07:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky trump has had Russia mob ties for decades.  Any surprise chatter might get intercepted?  BTW, Obama was NOT a judge in the FISA court.
849034874086240257 2017-04-03 23:04:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @shivie @Evan_McMullin exactly.  You sleep with dogs, you get fleas.
849034607899033600 2017-04-03 23:03:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky dude, you must be watching FOX.  I haven't heard a peep about it.  Again, that is NOT the LIE Nunes told the world.
849034301928742913 2017-04-03 23:02:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky ROFL. after 17 US depts confirmed RU was involved in election tampering they should have been more careful to not get intercepted.
849033326128111617 2017-04-03 22:58:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky that is NOT the LIE he told the world.  He said HE was going to go show trump what a whistle blower showed HIM.  The WH told him. All a LIE
849031381644591104 2017-04-03 22:50:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky If they were intercepted talking to POI's I expect they would be unmasked.  You hang with dogs, sooner or later you get fleas.  Simple.
849030813211475968 2017-04-03 22:48:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @FoxNews @TwitterMoments @bamanicky let's go back to Nunes ORIGINAL LIE that someone showed him something that HE had to show to trump.  THEY showed HIM.   All a big LIE.
849029213571039232 2017-04-03 22:41:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Patrici15767099 it CAN be her JOB and she could know nothing about it BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.  Its just another LIE perpetrated by trump and Nunes??
849028593405448192 2017-04-03 22:39:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Patrici15767099 1. perhaps she knows nothing about it because it is one of MANY THOUSANDS OF LIES trump/Fox/Brietbart/Infowars has told America
849011486315786240 2017-04-03 21:31:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Bill_Bing get used to the 5th.  You'll be hearing it a lot soon.  FLYNN will start the parade.

849009427575226368 2017-04-03 21:23:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> this is what causes @realDonaldTrump to wake up in a cold sweat. His terror is real cuz he knows RICO is looming. #TREASON #RICOhttps://twitter.com/counterchekist/status/849002421628096512

849007112965439488 2017-04-03 21:14:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenateMajLdr is one of USA's biggest hypocrite.  @GOP will wear trump & @DevinNunes & @SpeakerRyan & Mitch for years.  GOP= Kill democracyhttps://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/848957323834003460
849004963653009410 2017-04-03 21:05:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @latimes I wondered how America landed trump. Now I have my answer when I see people volunteering to have a tracking device in their body.  SMFH.
849003148832260096 2017-04-03 20:58:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RandPaul the only smoking gun is trump's daily mental unravelling.  NSA unmask those intercepted talking to POI.  Nothing to see here.  trump = @GOP
849002436240973825 2017-04-03 20:55:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @IvankaTrump please, please, please get your dad some help. Clearly he doesn't understand he is now the POTUS.  It is beyond embarrassing!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/848856822312292354
849001093220532224 2017-04-03 20:50:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> The tweets you see at 6 a.m. from @realDonaldTrump is cuz he wakes up in sheer terror due to reading stories like this.  #IMPEACH45 #TREASONhttps://twitter.com/olgaNYC1211/status/848999035537149954
848995861157691392 2017-04-03 20:29:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch ya ya.  We've heard it all before.  Then we see fools like you eat crow when her exclusive stories get verified by MSM.
848965677922766848 2017-04-03 18:29:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP will wear trump for decades.  @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP are taking USA down a very dangerous path! #Impeach45https://twitter.com/rubenkmajor/status/848964749974949889
848964967227314177 2017-04-03 18:26:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump would know this if he stayed off Twitter and attended his Intel briefings.https://twitter.com/imfabulous13/status/848924297032806400
848964686510936066 2017-04-03 18:25:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP @mike_pence @joncoopertweets @ScienceDave1265 @Random_Neuro123 I don't either but know that until @SpeakerRyan fires Nunes, he cannot be trusted.
848963297898516484 2017-04-03 18:19:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @mike_pence @joncoopertweets @ScienceDave1265 @Random_Neuro123 exactly.  This isn't about party anymore or ideology or policies.  This is about country before party!

848961307072122886 2017-04-03 18:12:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @meredithmusing @realsatanson I say *alleged* because absolutely everything and anything said by trump is suspect given his almost 80% LIE rate.
848960831622598658 2017-04-03 18:10:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ParkerMolloy sorry, anyone gullible enough to vote again for the guy that strips your extra money away WILL be mocked...just saying.
848959442754326529 2017-04-03 18:04:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Random_Neuro123 @joncoopertweets @ScienceDave1265 We'll just have to wait to see if Flynn can shed any light on Pence and what did Pence know and when did @mike_pence know it.
848958862497533954 2017-04-03 18:02:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @realsatanson @meredithmusing the whole point was that she didn't get an *answer*.  Allegedly she was told the subject of a *question*.

848942632466120704 2017-04-03 16:57:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @leahmcelrath YEP.  It was relentless.
848942349195517952 2017-04-03 16:56:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> this is the ONLY story here.  Everything else is trump and @GOP trying to change the narrative. https://twitter.com/BennyEsanu/status/848928676616048641
848941762257108992 2017-04-03 16:54:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @pedershk Ironic isn't it, because now it IS political because the trump's @GOP are trying to change the narrative...
848939985721991169 2017-04-03 16:47:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Oregonian This article is a complete joke.  A few 2016 terms come to mind: WRONG. says who?  #FAKENEWS.  LIAR.  Disaster.
848938851737321473 2017-04-03 16:42:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @frankthorp @AriMelber @LouiseMensch @gibsongirlmo nothing wrong with someone actually changing their mind on issues that put COUNTRY before party
848938331916320769 2017-04-03 16:40:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump if you kept away from Twitter and actually attended an INTEL meeting they could explain how unmasking of SIGINT works
848937862363873280 2017-04-03 16:38:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump If your group wasn't intercepted with spies, foreign agents or POI there wouldn't be any unmasking which, BTW, is NOT illegal. #SIGNIT

848914619221458944 2017-04-03 15:06:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jaywcobb all this does is keep his fantastical LIE in the news to distract from the trump/Russia story and that his AG Sessions LIED under oath.
848914343458512896 2017-04-03 15:05:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jaywcobb Unmasking happens every single day.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  Don't help to spread DISINFORMATION and lies for FOX and trump

847676469501345792 2017-03-30 05:06:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk Classic!  Thank you for your hard work!   Not too much would satisfy me more than seeing Flynn in jail and chanting #LockHimUp
847675300573884417 2017-03-30 05:01:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SenatorHeitkamp @Sen_JoeManchin @VerbaAqua14 with the current situation going on in the WH this will be perceived as the ultimate insult to every Dem voter in the land!  #traitors
847674761861709824 2017-03-30 04:59:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 3. Those in the know seem to think this is all tied together and the FBI is now rounding up the players. Get your popcorn out!  "Mike Flynn"
847674077170946054 2017-03-30 04:57:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 2. trump pals involved here with appearances of money laundering. RICO charges will apply if guilty.  Yesterday 10 NY mob guys were arrested
847673097612255234 2017-03-30 04:53:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Flynn" is just the beginning of @realDonaldTrump bad day today.  This casino got raided today by FBI.     noose tightening?https://twitter.com/business/status/847622544521740288
847671361514250241 2017-03-30 04:46:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TheRickWilson @wmweibel @soonergrunt @RonLPitts I can't imagine anyone with a shred of integrity staying especially after trump undermined him and now he has to wear this
847670651343085570 2017-03-30 04:43:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @netflix @TheRickWilson @nick_rothert @MelissaJPeltier It's all so entangled it'll need to be about 20 weeks of shows....longer running that his presidency.

847667200106221569 2017-03-30 04:29:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LovesTheJust @TeaPainUSA Good reminder!  Flynn may well have a double bagger with trumpsky and Pencekov!
847666842722222080 2017-03-30 04:28:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LovesTheJust @TeaPainUSA They think they have a smoking gun tape from the woman that was on CNN and said Obama was gathering intel on trump.  She left the WH in 2015
847666155003052034 2017-03-30 04:25:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AngryWHStaffer Why would he turn white? He knew this was coming.  Why do you think his good pal ran the Flynn spy story in National Enquirer?
847665315278344192 2017-03-30 04:22:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MSNBC @RVAwonk @GarnerChristina I'm going to bet Pence is going down with him.  They're all in on this.

847661157473177601 2017-03-30 04:05:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @th3j35t3r @walterpeck OMG I'm so happy I wasn't drinking anything when I read your tweet.  Thank you, thank you for the absolute gut laugh!

847595684605829120 2017-03-30 23:45:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jdawsey1 @JasonB_ny I predict he'll bury trump due to humiliation of being forced to resign a mere 24 days into the presidency.   He's gone silent for a reason.
847595254500925440 2017-03-30 23:43:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Vext6 like the Russian guy in NY on election night with 3 different causes of death - bashed in head, heart attack, unknown causes.
847594169434427393 2017-03-30 23:39:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Flynn" all together now America, "Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!"

847591839221727232 2017-03-30 23:30:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Flynn" hired Ezra that showed Nunes the TS docs.  McMaster tried to fire Ezra but @realDonaldTrump said no.  #Flynnghazi
847590698601795584 2017-03-30 23:25:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jaketapper and criminal lawyers all around Washington are popping champagne bottles tonight.  Let the games begin.
847588174331170816 2017-03-30 23:15:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SpeakerRyan @RepAdamSchiff  8. and another LIE Nunes told to Wolf Blitzer:  I'm quite sure people in the W.Wing had NO IDEA I was there.
847586413331726336 2017-03-30 23:08:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Flynn" wonder how proud Jr. is of daddy today knowing he needs immunity to talk to FBI?  #TREASON
847585266722234373 2017-03-30 23:04:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Flynn" will only get a deal from FBI if he can give them a bigger fish.  Pencekov and trumpsky are the only bigger fish in the WH.

847582323415449600 2017-03-30 22:52:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Is "Mike Flynn" going to send @realDonaldTrump up for ?  The failing NY Times will be thrilled to run the full page cover story.  ROFL.
847581673344475137 2017-03-30 22:49:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @activist360 popcorn ready.  Bubbly on ice.

847579546052304896 2017-03-30 22:41:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ddale8 @YAppelbaum oh oh @realDonaldTrump   Too many Russians are dying of heart attacks in the trunks of their car so Flynn should see a cardiologist!

847577423000371201 2017-03-30 22:32:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Spicer said earlier this week that information coming to Nunes from the WH didn't make a ton of sense.  NOTHING they do makes sense!
847576856173854721 2017-03-30 22:30:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @AtticusWest we all would like that but as long as people steal her thunder, I expect she will defend herself.
847575008041779200 2017-03-30 22:23:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Mike Pence" is a fucking creep
847574757956493312 2017-03-30 22:22:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @VinnyTimEC @Aubs89 My guess: because they're all involved in a massive cover-up and now effective cancellation of the hearing to investigate Russian ties.
847574329915170816 2017-03-30 22:20:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @AtticusWest Telling HER to move along on HER TL?  LOL. This must be bossy men week.
847573414105694208 2017-03-30 22:17:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DevinNunes @AlexNBCNews @LouiseMensch @eighthdayarts and John Dean said he was a new young lawyer at the time and the biggest mistake he and Nixon made was NOT getting a CRIMINAL LAWYER.
847570928477155328 2017-03-30 22:07:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Spicer -as per Philip Mudd to @PressSec did Ellis/Ezra have authorization to give TS INTEL to Nunes? If not, should clearances be stripped?
847565034733453312 2017-03-30 21:43:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 7. Why did Speaker Ryan order Nunes to lie?   What does the FBI have to tell USA that @SpeakerRyan wants to silence?  STAY TUNED AMERICA!
847564382724694016 2017-03-30 21:41:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SpeakerRyan "Rep. Adam Schiff"  6. showing HIM documents that are classified.  SO WHY DID NUNES LIE? To cancel the HIC #trumprussia hearings?  Coverup?
847563839868620802 2017-03-30 21:39:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SpeakerRyan "Rep. Adam Schiff"  5. now we learn that Nunes didn't actually run to the WH to tell trump anything.  He was there because WH was
847563460757946372 2017-03-30 21:37:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Rep. Adam Schiff"  4.  Defying ALL protocol and norms @SpeakerRyan orders Nunes NOT to share this information with the House Committee
847562974000578565 2017-03-30 21:35:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Rep. Adam Schiff"   3. then he lied and said that he was so shocked by what he saw he just had to run over to WH show trump.
847562680307040256 2017-03-30 21:34:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Rep. Adam Schiff"  2. then he held a panic press conference to LIE TO THE WORLD that a WHISTLEBLOWER sent/showed him documents.
847562348076220416 2017-03-30 21:33:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Rep. Adam Schiff"  1. so let's review what Nunes did.  He ran to the WH late at night to look at documents the WH wanted to show HIM.
847561233427341312 2017-03-30 21:28:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> "Rep. Adam Schiff" had better remember the NUNES LIE: he ran to the WH to tell trump about information HE HAD not to view WH info THEY had.
847560316296716292 2017-03-30 21:25:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee by all appearances he is used to shovelling manure!
847559396666232832 2017-03-30 21:21:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr can you send a link to that evidence that she leaked information?
847535459681001472 2017-03-30 19:46:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> more #winning !  Nunes LIED that he went to show you stuff at the WH.  WH showed HIM stuff!  Did NSC Ezra leak information to him?  OH OH.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/847455180912181249
847532600642084864 2017-03-30 19:34:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GloriaBorger nails it.  Nunes wasn't there to tell trump anything.   Was this a big smokescreen just to shut down hearings?
847531046694289408 2017-03-30 19:28:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Spicer @DevinNunes didn't run to WH to tell trump anything. He was there so WH could show him TS documents.  @SpeakerRyan must now fire him
847530234635210752 2017-03-30 19:25:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @SpeakerRyan now that we know Nunes went to Wh to view leaks from Ezra and Ellis and not to tell trump what he saw, will you FIRE HIM?
847526718743076864 2017-03-30 19:11:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @invisiblegrrlla it's all a smokescreen to cancel the hearing with Yates blowing this all wide open.
847525842846531584 2017-03-30 19:08:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @sarahzview @BradMossEsq and it wasn't Nunes running to trump to tell him what he was given by Whistleblowers it was all a smokescreen to cancel the house hearing!
847524923664850944 2017-03-30 19:04:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr oh, okay then. Day 24 Flynn and day 70 Walsh.   We're going to extreme vet.  Nobody will extreme vet like me.  Nobody.  Believe me.
847523913370263552 2017-03-30 19:00:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr priceless coming from someone that follows a man that spews LIES 80% of the time he tells you something.  ROFL.
847521366127411200 2017-03-30 18:50:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> normally this news wouldn't be superseded by learning WH leaked TS information to NUNES a chair of an investigation to cover up for POTUShttps://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/847491552310054912
847520954737598464 2017-03-30 18:48:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> BUSTED @DevinNunes your LIE is now cause for resignation!  You didn't run to WH to show trump anything.  WH staff Ellis and Ezra showed YOU.
847520133388001280 2017-03-30 18:45:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DevinNunes @patribotics @LouiseMensch and now that blows all to hell Nunes' story that he had to run to WH to tell trump what HE found because THEY showed him the stuff.  ROFL.
847519217855242240 2017-03-30 18:41:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @BraddJaffy @OutHouseAtty @DavidClinchNews but Nunes story is that he had to run to WH to tell trump what HE was given by whistleblower.  LOL.
847518529557471233 2017-03-30 18:38:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump funny you'd mention the NYT cuz they just told us Ezra and Ellis told Nunes about the TS information!  NOT HIM TELLING YOU! #TRAITOR TO USA.
847517949191536640 2017-03-30 18:36:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DevinNunes LIAR, you didn't need to tell trump anything about what YOU saw cuz Ellis and Ezra told you what THEY saw.  #RESIGN #Coverup 
847517219164520448 2017-03-30 18:33:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr yep, keep on telling yourself there's no fire beneath the BILLOWING SMOKE.  see @nytimes story just now???????
847516507659583488 2017-03-30 18:30:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AdamSerwer LOL, it sure will.  He'll sound like Carter Page did when he stumbled and bumbled his way through a simple question.  Popcorn is ready!
847515700465811456 2017-03-30 18:27:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> after today's bombshell story in the NYT I expect a flood of republicans to now demand his resignation NOT recusal.https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/846824972991565824
847515042454978565 2017-03-30 18:25:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @DustinGiebel @AMF422 YEP.  people mock her, bots spam her, others take credit for her breaking stories and time after time she's vindicated BIGLY!
847512467957620737 2017-03-30 18:14:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> the noose is tightening day by day.  #TrumpRussia is gonna take them down! @realDonaldTrump and @GOP day 70 shitshow just got real folks. https://twitter.com/mikefarb1/status/847502422809432064
847510323787583489 2017-03-30 18:06:21 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr the charlatan FBI and DOJ are doing a 3 pronged investigation into #trumprussia feeding into my unhinged conspiracy theories.  Okay.  #RICO
847506834004901888 2017-03-30 17:52:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @nhdogmom @Acosta #winning is so exhausting for @GOP!  35% approval for their so-called leader, HC bombs, Flynn fired, Walsh FLEES!  & Russian   DAY 70 ROFL.
847505235513712640 2017-03-30 17:46:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @hurlgr yep, and some of those leaks are intentional trump team ploys to take our eyes off the #Trumprussia billowing smoke.
847504793970950144 2017-03-30 17:44:23 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DavidCornDC @elena_conway not pissed at all.  Just clarifying that point is all.  you have a good day, too!
847504211709370370 2017-03-30 17:42:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RoguePOTUSStaff this might just piss you off that @LouiseMensch on the 27th was the first to name Michael Ellis as Nunes contact at the WH.https://twitter.com/mikefarb1/status/847502422809432064
847502950876332034 2017-03-30 17:37:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> BINGO @LouiseMensch Michael Ellis named!https://twitter.com/mikefarb1/status/847502422809432064

847491491526090753 2017-03-30 16:51:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ananavarro @WMB72buckeye Are Pence and Ryan are neck deep in this?  Enquiring minds want to know why trumpov's pal owner of N.E. called Flynn a RU SPY last week?
847490008340504577 2017-03-30 16:45:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @inkasrain that's all good and well for you Michal, but Pence isn't Jewish and his religion doesn't forbid eating meals alone with another woman.....

847298469488320513 2017-03-29 04:04:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @antmousie UPDATE:  Also said he'd sent the letter off night before.  Then blamed Schiff 4 not signing the letter to send to Comey.  #Lying
847294476745756674 2017-03-29 03:48:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 100's of trump LIES have proved he has ZERO moral compass.  so yes, he'd have no problem taking someone down to pivot from himself
847292511051632641 2017-03-29 03:40:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid he uses the wrong "you're" while professing the bar was lowered for the AA Potus. You can't make this up.

847289580701143040 2017-03-29 03:29:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 The very fact you think that shows you haven't a clue what the FISA court even is.  and the warrant was for 2 SERVERS not people
847288459601379330 2017-03-29 03:24:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 seems pretty innocuous after "years in the making"https://www.lawfareblog.com/obama-administration-releases-long-awaited-new-eo-12333-rules-sharing-raw-signals-intelligence
847285916011905025 2017-03-29 03:14:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 & a very special FISA court to approve it. Twice they turned down FISA requests until enough PROOF existed to grant a FISA warrant
847285158696763394 2017-03-29 03:11:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 that's old news.  Either WaPo or NYT did a big story on BO getting the Russia story on the record before trump team hid the intel.
847284015681814528 2017-03-29 03:07:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 He had thousands of employees and one/some may have gone rogue.  He, personally.  Absolutely NOT.
847283459919757312 2017-03-29 03:04:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 we'll never know will we now as it's all allegedly TS data.  And he said some was NOT unmasked but he could ID them anyways.
847282151422738434 2017-03-29 02:59:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 Nunes has NOTHING.  It was a fake out to stop investigation.  $100.00
847281498151571457 2017-03-29 02:57:05 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 if Nunes has TS information that Obama illegally obtained on trump.  I say he doesn't have any whatsoever.
847280868812914689 2017-03-29 02:54:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 What, now you don't want to stand behind your bravado with a 100.00 bet?  C'mon big guy.  Charity of your choice if you're right!
847280184818417665 2017-03-29 02:51:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 put your money where your mouth is Robert.  I'll bet you a 100.00 charitable donation you're wrong.  Charity of winner's choice.
847279772602318848 2017-03-29 02:50:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 all a ploy to effectively shut down the investigation...which he has succeeded by cancelling the Tues. hearing. Pot, Kettle, Black
847279318904340480 2017-03-29 02:48:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 Sure, and he said there was no proof Obama did anything illegal and it scared him SO BAD he ran to trump.  ROFL.
847279028314677253 2017-03-29 02:47:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 I'll bet you $100.00 charitable donation Nunes never releases this "evidence" to anyone on the panel...cuz there is NONE.
847278317019439105 2017-03-29 02:44:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 like they wouldn't have held a presser to announce that they possess TS documents to prove that trump was tapped by Dems. #gullible
847277064273018881 2017-03-29 02:39:28 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 If they had a scintilla of proof that BO illegally spied on trump, we would have heard that days ago WITHOUT showing the TS proof!
847275697362001920 2017-03-29 02:34:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 why did trump's pal who owns National Enquirer run a story about Flynn being a spy?  That should tell you who's scared shitless!!
847272498659905537 2017-03-29 02:21:19 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 did you notice that the classified information wasn't released last Monday and GLOMARED all to hell.  That's their specialty.
847272239921717251 2017-03-29 02:20:18 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 FFS, an announcement that they have "proof" without showing the "proof" would not be classified.  So where's the BIG announcement?
847271547383369732 2017-03-29 02:17:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 new closed hearings are scheduled because they don't want YOU to hear that Yates contradicts the WH.  Occam's razor, dude.
847270740940410887 2017-03-29 02:14:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @raysr19 ask yourself if the GOP would close the meetings if the had evidence of Obama tapps.  Give your head a shake.  #DKT
847270370587455489 2017-03-29 02:12:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DianMo @KaraCalavera to me this is just further evidence the media is anti-Clinton to the core.

847268516029911040 2017-03-29 02:05:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ShomahKhoobi @donlemon has too many lying, interrupting trump shills on. I don't watch anymore as his show is out of control.
847267805875417091 2017-03-29 02:02:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @vlramirez12 @SoxShark39 Yep, just another Russian attempt to destabilize USA.
847265988848500736 2017-03-29 01:55:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @myerman @RoguePOTUSStaff @LouiseMensch so do you think a spy would say, "Okay, you got me" to throw you off?
847263308000317441 2017-03-29 01:44:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> maybe another "reading ONLY" twitter account to fly under the radar... Maybe wouldn't get noticed to get blocked.

847227040583475200 2017-03-29 23:20:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> reporters.  end quote.  LIAR Nunes is now blaming Adam Schiff saying Adam refused to sign the invitation.  And he told CNN last night

847217859063300096 2017-03-29 22:44:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LilleyDennese what's scaring the WH is that everyone is starting to see it.  FINALLY!
847216719588347905 2017-03-29 22:39:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 10. indicting somebody.     
847216262035816448 2017-03-29 22:37:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 9. for the WH and that the FBI and the DOJ which has to make the decision on prosecution is heading toward potential
847215923559780353 2017-03-29 22:36:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 8. the Russian investigation.  I think when he said that he realized that this is going to get a lot more difficult
847215514430521345 2017-03-29 22:34:53 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 7. He doesn't do that if there's just smoke.  He does that if there's fire. We on the public side have seen the smoke on
847215270137548800 2017-03-29 22:33:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 6. Director rarely does that "we're opening an investigation on this".  Let me give you the bottom line here
847214927739707392 2017-03-29 22:32:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 5. later and again puts his foot into it after that embarrassment and says, "we want to announce publicly" which the FBI
847214575170670593 2017-03-29 22:31:09 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 4. remember he had to come out and embarrass himself and say "now we're closing it again".  Now he comes out a few months
847213990560256000 2017-03-29 22:28:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 3. "we're opening an investigation" then he says in the election cycle before the election "we're closing it" as you
847213305148063749 2017-03-29 22:26:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @donaldbuffoon 2. profound.  I think we've underplayed it.  Look, going back to last summer Comey came out and said
847212806789152769 2017-03-29 22:24:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 1. Philip Mudd Former CIA Counterintelligence Official says about Comey's statement: the Comey statement is far more interesting and I think

847206954128637957 2017-03-29 22:00:52 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk Hence, when Clapper said he didn't see any evidence of collusion he hadn't seen all the evidence, particularly not THAT evidence.
847206622665482242 2017-03-29 21:59:33 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @RVAwonk Comey said at the hearing that the report Clapper had been given did not contain all the information they had.

847134432595128320 2017-03-29 17:12:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee 1. I'm betting Flynn has evidence that will take Pence down.  Like Chair to ex CIA head said yesterday, "We need to find out

847094995349729280 2017-03-29 14:35:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ProudlyLiberal2 @Chawailia YEP, and that's why @GOP and @SpeakerRyan stand idly by while lunatic 45 destroys USA
847094386647154689 2017-03-29 14:33:34 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA @OliverUv money.  Which is exactly why they'd let MILLIONS die to kill HC and save MONEY for insurance lobbies paying THEM.
847093970291253248 2017-03-29 14:31:55 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA @OliverUv sure, like the GOP wouldn't do anything to sell out their voters either
847093551066374144 2017-03-29 14:30:15 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TAPSTRIMEDIA @OliverUv Um, it's the Telcos and internet providers selling it.  Not the GOP.

847089743867265024 2017-03-29 14:15:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @GOP @iamsarabourne It's horrifying and fascinating all at the same time to see what power does to them. @SpeakerRyan and Cruz r the worst

846815551741575168 2017-03-28 20:05:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @worldbefree_99 says the guy/gal that tweets "leftist tears" memes.  ROFL.

846760036009328640 2017-03-28 16:24:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TeaPainUSA it has now become urgent as Americans watch judicial norms being stripped by trump team.
846759378065645568 2017-03-28 16:22:22 UTC <donaldbuffoon> it is now patently obvious @SpeakerRyan installed Nunes to obstruct/cancel the entire investigation into #Trumprussia ties.  Complicit in  https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/846734142884732928
846757325427781634 2017-03-28 16:14:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch can @CNN or another entity conduct a hearing for public record if these hearings are all cancelled?  #JudicialNormsCrumbling

846753023154008065 2017-03-28 15:57:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MsAmerican2017 convenient.
846752864022097920 2017-03-28 15:56:29 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MsAmerican2017 @diliz864 facts just get in the way of their narrative.  Hence the lies and BS they spew at will. i.e.: BG massacre
846752391684747266 2017-03-28 15:54:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MsAmerican2017 for some trump voters its only about skin color.  Do you want to undo deals every president ever or just Obamas?
846735761382662144 2017-03-28 14:48:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DavidCornDC Could @CNN or other such entity conduct a hearing and interview Yates & others to get them on public record if R's bury this?
846734428239888385 2017-03-28 14:43:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> right.  Funny how only the Dems get rich, said nobody except @MsAmerican2017
846733923014995968 2017-03-28 14:41:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @MsAmerican2017 Do you want to undo deals every president ever did or just the ones the black guy did?

846730803526615041 2017-03-28 14:28:49 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @maddow @TrumpsTheMan45 LOL.  I have NO allegiance to any one party and at least once voted for every party...good try though
846730154462199808 2017-03-28 14:26:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @maddow @TrumpsTheMan45 Sure. I think you're in an echo-chamber and your eyes are closed to anything that doesn't fit your narrative.
846728632496107522 2017-03-28 14:20:12 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpsTheMan45 I run on common sense and critical thought.  At what point are hundred of "COINCIDENCES" no longer just smoke for YOU?
846728350974455809 2017-03-28 14:19:04 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @maddow @TrumpsTheMan45 thankfully missed the tax farce.   I guess the old saying stands, "You can lead a horse to water..."
846727328738639872 2017-03-28 14:15:01 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpsTheMan45 and it should be a fucking scandal that a POTUS campaign is cavorting with KNOWN RUSSIAN SPIES FFS.
846725513955590144 2017-03-28 14:07:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpsTheMan45 I stay out of the FOX echo-chamber and SEE it everywhere.  Try @maddow if you want to be horrified every day
846723972943142913 2017-03-28 14:01:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpsTheMan45 2. FISA court denied 1st two requests but not 3rd one.  Why do Manafort, Page, Flynn, Tillerson, Ross ALL have RU ties?
846723045309931524 2017-03-28 13:58:00 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @TrumpsTheMan45 1, the real story is how what is a FISA court, how FISA gets approved, what evidence is required, when are they requested.
846721802243981312 2017-03-28 13:53:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @micfuckabee @MaxineWaters @BlueC5Guy @UpInTheHills and what's your favorite flavor of kool-aid?

846587920278437889 2017-03-27 05:01:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @WeinfeldRuth @BettyBowers when trump said, "I alone can do it" he really meant "Jared alone can do it".
846583307798163456 2017-03-27 04:42:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch @hammarby31 that's my absolute ultimate fantasy that he gets stripped of everything he owns due to RICO charges
846582831153217539 2017-03-27 04:40:50 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @LouiseMensch @ValentinePlanet flynn will be the one to tell us all that...
846582315513884678 2017-03-27 04:38:47 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee @LouiseMensch I think you nailed it given how Nunes panicked and the relationship he would have with Ellis
846580662555492352 2017-03-27 04:32:13 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tmmckinney777 @mos_self @SenateDems had better know America is watching your every move. It wouldn't be wise to vote for Gorsuch at all

846517956334936064 2017-03-27 00:23:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @funder 2. Christie and Giuliani made sure to cover up for trump for years.  He's sloppy due to not having to care all that time.

844978975411585024 2017-03-23 18:27:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @speakout_april and why perpetrated a charade that is only going to end in the call for independent inquiry and possible charges for Nunes?
844978722910322688 2017-03-23 18:26:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @speakout_april unless its all a charade why would he race to WH to give him leaked information NOT from FBI?

844681955115352064 2017-03-22 22:47:26 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @POTUS @DevinNunes @seanhannity Once again Hannity proves he knows nothing about FISA &/or 702's.  STOP disseminating FAKE NEWS!
844680830354055168 2017-03-22 22:42:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoeNBC it should be readily apparent by now that they could give a damn about the country.  The GOP is rotten from top down to its core!
844680248557891584 2017-03-22 22:40:39 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Nunes  Incidental pick up of trump is a LOT different than illegal TAPP. NO VINDICATION WHATSOEVER.  NONE! @realDonaldTrump @Rep_DevinNunes
844679499337908224 2017-03-22 22:37:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> In January, I had him down for March 13th & 15th so I'm very impatient.  Give him a few more weeks...
844678958163517440 2017-03-22 22:35:31 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @dayofroses @Amplitude350Lee LOL, Wouldn't the CIA want him alive to prosecute him and the Russians want him dead? He's a lunatic...like 45
844655067563147264 2017-03-22 21:00:35 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @DevinNunes @LouiseMensch @JoshM_White the letter from Adam Schiff just said there was no unmasking but Nunes was able to identify them
844654442175643648 2017-03-22 20:58:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Karoli @armandodkos you can be sure there'll be hardly a peep about this given its the Republicans doing this and not HRC's team.
844651548428845056 2017-03-22 20:46:36 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @AdamSchiffCA when will an independent committee review be requested? In light of todays leaks by Nunes, this is URGENT now.  Thank you.https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/844649549696286724
844638436422144000 2017-03-22 19:54:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump you can't pretend you didn't know Manafort ties to Russia when we tweeted about it in July.  Another LIE.  Nuneshttps://twitter.com/donaldbuffoon/status/758406032464891904
844636227290578945 2017-03-22 19:45:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> was very telling to hear @JohnWDean say last night the big mistake they made was NOT having a CRIMINAL lawyer for Nixon right away.https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/844609483280142336
844635644575940608 2017-03-22 19:43:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> it appears more and more likely it's already too late.  They are now blatantly flaunting the law.https://twitter.com/micheleahern/status/844619742170169344

844632690036920320 2017-03-22 19:31:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @afneil @LouiseMensch would this not be divulging information he shouldn't be discussing?
844632234493526016 2017-03-22 19:29:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tomwatson @FBI will want to know @DevinNunes may be breaking the law by what appears to be obstructing an ongoing FBI investigation.
844631200454995970 2017-03-22 19:25:45 UTC <donaldbuffoon> If we were tweeting stories about "Manafort" ties to Russia in July then how could trump pretend they didn't know?  "Secret Service" Nuneshttps://twitter.com/donaldbuffoon/status/758406032464891904
844628539135569920 2017-03-22 19:15:10 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @tmmckinney777 @Ziggy_Daddy trump didn't even know Page, Tillerson, Manafort. Are these key players INSERTED into the government by PUTIN?

844578408994521088 2017-03-22 15:55:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Amplitude350Lee @dayofroses My money is on Manafort having either a "heart attack" or fleeing to RU.  Stone will sing.
844577827458445316 2017-03-22 15:53:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @20committee Manafort should see a Cardiologist quickly!

844418035549192195 2017-03-21 05:18:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> trump will be impeached before the Brussels NATO conference.

844362868619296773 2017-03-21 01:39:30 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch you are officially one step closer to trump calling you the "failing Louise Mensch".
844358494568382464 2017-03-21 01:22:07 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Billbrowder @Mickee7 @andrea_pogan he and Manafort have both gone from asset to liability now

844216769153646592 2017-03-21 15:58:57 UTC <donaldbuffoon> FBI said trump is under investigation for ties to RU. Fox watchers are in an echo chamber due to intentionally misleading viewers. #FAUXnewshttps://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/844126949693784064

843992372442681344 2017-03-20 01:07:16 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Why did your advisor ROGER STONE know in August that Podesta was a target?  And in October WL proved him right.   #TREASON
843991870870966272 2017-03-20 01:05:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> LIAR.  Comey clearly stated that the report Clapper's report DID NOT contain ALL the information in it that the FBI had.  Again YOU LIE!!!!https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/843772976151642112

843964079119065088 2017-03-20 23:14:51 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ZekeJMiller I'd be concerned if Comey had given them that information.

843962152763318272 2017-03-20 23:07:11 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump Comey made it real clear the RNC was also hacked.  Funny, Putin/Wikileaks didn't leak anything.  Did you make a deal??????

841311085521063936 2017-03-13 15:32:48 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @washingtonpost @laurieWr I just subscribed for a year because trump and his kool-aid drinkers fear the truth and WaPo.

841289018029490177 2017-03-13 14:05:06 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @JoyAnnReid @JillSorbie that happened the day she accepted trump's offer to run his campaign.
841277589314387968 2017-03-13 13:19:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @ParkerMolloy She and trump just make shit up.  Fantastical LIARS, both of them.

840694434131927040 2017-03-11 22:42:27 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @kmeyer2023 and some were allowed to stay on to finish important work and they ALL were notified individually NOT some by reading the news!
840693954110668800 2017-03-11 22:40:32 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @jaketapper @grantbosse not when he was told after the election that he could stay on!
840691154299445248 2017-03-11 22:29:25 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @Bennythesnitch didn't trump pay 10K to a Veritas company for that video that caused an uproar?   Same Veritas Bannon owns I wonder?
840689107256786944 2017-03-11 22:21:17 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch I thought he did a really good job *correctly* explaining your Nov. report in his introduction of you.

838233287491407872 2017-03-04 03:42:44 UTC <donaldbuffoon> they're just pissed this hunt has already got one resignation ( or more like a firing) and one person lying under oath...so far.  Stay tunedhttps://twitter.com/SuzanneKelleher/status/838028361247113216

838211119873339393 2017-03-04 02:14:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @LouiseMensch gets mentioned in the article.  She broke the story about the FISA warrant MONTHS ago.  Follow her if you aren't already!https://twitter.com/EricBoehm87/status/838200072647151620
838210112720257024 2017-03-04 02:10:38 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 4.  If true, that would mean Flynn and Sessions and ??? else is under wiretap watch. This is serious folks, if true.
838209708041240576 2017-03-04 02:09:02 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 3. And they would have had to convince ELEVEN judges there was ample reason to believe Sessions was colluding with an agent against USA
838209462879997952 2017-03-04 02:08:03 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 2. USA cannot LEGALLY listen to any audio if an American is intercepted UNLESS they have a FISA.  To get the FISA they had to go to court.
838209182335557632 2017-03-04 02:06:56 UTC <donaldbuffoon> 1. IF TRUE: this means a FISA warrant exists for USA listening to Jeff Session's conversations folks.  This would be HUGE HUGE news people.https://twitter.com/yashar/status/838208704742846464

838192756279238656 2017-03-04 01:01:40 UTC <donaldbuffoon> the Obama "machine" that caused Flynn to LIE and resign and caused Sessions to LIE under oath.  A very powerful machine, indeed.https://twitter.com/chase931996/status/838138349445648390

838170977506766848 2017-03-04 23:35:08 UTC <donaldbuffoon> given the drip, drip, drip of Wikileaks Podesta emails put you in the WH, you should be the last one to whine about this. KARMA=bitchhttps://twitter.com/VP/status/838145250954706944
838129088971726848 2017-03-04 20:48:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> patience, son, patience.  Flynn has resigned.  Sessions lied under oath.  Now we know Kushner spoke to russians when trump said NO ONE did.https://twitter.com/sean_spoonts/status/838067674915700737

838124976959954944 2017-03-04 20:32:20 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @datrumpnation1 there's only 1 FISA court.  They would NOT issue FISA to FBI without sufficient evidence.  FBI NOT Obama get warrants.
838081099699900416 2017-03-04 17:37:59 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @datrumpnation1 read up on how FISAs work.  If there was one, trump is in SERIOUS serious trouble, not Obama.
838080795096969216 2017-03-04 17:36:46 UTC <donaldbuffoon> if its true there's been #wiretapping of trump, there had to be a FISA warrant.  If true, trump is in big shit. Treasonous level shit. WOW!
838051831217414146 2017-03-04 15:41:41 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 5. Get your lawyer to explain what it took to get a FISA warrant.  Then consider moving to a county with no extradition.
838050895891849217 2017-03-04 15:37:58 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 4. so IF they have tapped your lines they had to have had good cause and evidence.  So, yes, get a GOOD lawyer.
838050324480864256 2017-03-04 15:35:42 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 3.  The ONLY way to get a FISA warrant is to go to a SPECIAL COURT.  Ample evidence is required to get the FISA warrant.
838049826700849152 2017-03-04 15:33:43 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 2.  They had to have intercepted YOU on another call then applied for a FISA warrant to listen to YOUR calls.
838049242337832961 2017-03-04 15:31:24 UTC <donaldbuffoon> @realDonaldTrump 1.  It is illegal for USA to listen to any calls when an American is one of the people talking on an intercepted call.

832096475983147008 2017-02-15 05:17:14 UTC <donaldbuffoon> Exactly.  He smugly dismissed the Russian interference rumors. Logic would dictate he'd keep an eye out for ANY possible breaches with them.https://twitter.com/maurtosay/status/832094512696717312
