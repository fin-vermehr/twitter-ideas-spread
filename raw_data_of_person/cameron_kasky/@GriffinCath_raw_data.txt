967602712564064256 2018-02-24 03:30:38 UTC <GriffinCath> One person - one vote - a handover of one assault weapon is more than a gesture. It is a deliberate action to make positive change in a society. Each individual who hands in an assault weapon becomes part of a tsunami for change across America.
