965125797588725760 2018-02-17 07:28:15 UTC <fabredhead> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Not to mention, as I've seen others point out, that every on-duty cop ever killed was armed, and being armed didn't save them. But somehow a schoolteacher with frightened kids to protect is going to do better? That is some magical thinking right there.
965110854390898688 2018-02-17 06:28:53 UTC <fabredhead> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Plus, who's to say that 1) any armed guards or teachers will never turn out to be shooters, or 2) that they won't be the very first targets in order to neutralize them, if they''re known to be possible impediments to the success of an outside threat?
965106733734612992 2018-02-17 06:12:30 UTC <fabredhead> @raudelmil That sounds reasonable to me.
965104254745751552 2018-02-17 06:02:39 UTC <fabredhead> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Oh, and it looks like the answer to "do Republicans want to actually pay more to make schools any safer?" is "no, they want to pay LESS while expecting more", according to Comrade Dear Leader's budget plan:https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/15/school-safety-cuts-trump-administration-348968
965102266100408320 2018-02-17 05:54:45 UTC <fabredhead> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews I mean, have you ever actually *asked* any teachers whether they want to be essentially front-line armed infantry? Because I know quite a few teachers, and none of them wants that. In fact, they fear the normalization of expecting teachers to risk their lives for the job.
965097551048343552 2018-02-17 05:36:01 UTC <fabredhead> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Good lord, do you ever hear yourself? Not only are you talking about turning schools into prisons, you're talking about turning teachers into deputies at best, wardens at worst. And let me guess, you're not going to want to pay them any more for this dubious privilege, either.

I never tell him that boys don't cry. I want him to know that he is allowed to feel the full range of human emotions, and wish more men were thus empowered.
964011227730075648 2018-02-14 05:39:21 UTC <fabredhead> @michaelianblack I think one of the first steps has to be to eliminate misogyny. It's the root of so much wrong with humanity. It couldn't hurt to have one's masculinity questioned if doing so didn't imply that one is feminine, and that femininity is bad.

I had to add a lot to my credit card debt while unemployed, and it's been very difficult to pay down, what with the accumulated interest. But at least I had the option of using the card. :-/
943627088099147776 2017-12-20 23:40:04 UTC <fabredhead> @hblodget @paulkrugman @kriswager @Graezex I'm not at all okay with the fact that any gains that may come to my household would be at the expense of those earning less. It disgusts me that the 1% apparently think that benefiting at the expense of the 99% is hunky-dory. Their loyalty is not to USA, but to their own wealth.

I absolutely agree with you that the Trump/GOP tax scam is meant to further enrich the wealthy & further impoverish the poor. It's disgusting & immoral. My point was only that even some who seem rich(er) are closer to the edge than you may think.

A FOAF said elsewhere that he was inclined to view ousting Franken as giving something to women, not to Republicans. I agree in principle. And yet.
938517911597191168 2017-12-06 21:18:01 UTC <fabredhead> @ezlusztig I don't want to kneecap our own party by booting out someone who has, in fact, consistently voted as an ally of women. He is certainly infinitely more of an ally than anyone in the Republican Party.
938517595095027715 2017-12-06 21:16:46 UTC <fabredhead> @ezlusztig In a better world, I think many people would be willing to wait for the results of such an investigation, but right now we are in a period where there is a lot of anger and momentum.
938517519656210432 2017-12-06 21:16:28 UTC <fabredhead> @ezlusztig This is a tough one. With 8 accusers now, things do not look good for Franken. I do think that an investigation, as he himself called for, would be an excellent idea.
938516268025569280 2017-12-06 21:11:29 UTC <fabredhead> Yeah. That. The self-flagellation/immolation of Democrats without any such reflection or action on the part of the Republicans regarding their own accused DOES NOT HELP WOMEN. Let's be clear on that.

930320862674411520 2017-11-13 06:25:52 UTC <fabredhead> 5) Also? When McConnell said earlier today, I believe the women, yes, has got to be the first time in US political history that a Republican politician has openly spoken such words in support of women accusing a Republican male compatriot of sexual misconduct. 
930318533589860352 2017-11-13 06:16:37 UTC <fabredhead> 4) Yet Moore somehow managed to work himself all the way up to Chief Justice of Alabama (twice! and got booted...twice!), seemingly solely on the strength of his ostentatious piety. Talk about affirmative action for mediocre white Christian men!
930317808625385473 2017-11-13 06:13:44 UTC <fabredhead> 3) And that's on TOP of all the actual professional reasons why Moore is utterly unfit for any kind of office or other position of authority. Just read what his law school profs & classmates have to say about him.
930316668022161408 2017-11-13 06:09:12 UTC <fabredhead> 2) And they're also infuriating, because they show that, once AGAIN, some asshole dudebro got away with being a missing stair for decades while his shitty behavior toward women -- excuse me, teenaged girls -- was an open secret. Disgusting.
930315995704635392 2017-11-13 06:06:32 UTC <fabredhead> 1) All the stories now flooding the news regarding Roy Moore -- his known ephebophilia, his academic ineptness in law school -- are quite illuminating.

891851372026613763 2017-07-30 02:41:51 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 14/ Until then, go the hell away, sit in the corner, and think hard about what you've done.  No love, Me
891850629580193792 2017-07-30 02:38:54 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 13/ Maybe one day you'll remember why you're in DC and what you're supposed to be doing: serving & helping Americans, not harming us.
891849718829129728 2017-07-30 02:35:17 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 12/ If only you actually cared as much about helping people in need as much as you care about sticking it to liberals & the black guy!
891848434398973952 2017-07-30 02:30:11 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 11/ But you won't do that, because you're driven by ideology, not actual desire to help. And your ideology is terrible.
891847762807062529 2017-07-30 02:27:31 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 10/ Now, if Congress can get bipartisan momentum toward single payer or something similar, that'll be worth supporting.
891847305791406080 2017-07-30 02:25:42 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 9/ Sure, it's not perfect, but it could be improved if you were actually interested in a good-faith attempt to improve it, which you aren't.
891846878496772097 2017-07-30 02:24:00 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 8/ Allow me to remind you that the ACA was based on a Republican idea implemented by Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts. I was there.
891845972069941250 2017-07-30 02:20:24 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 7/ ...because they DID come up with something better almost 8 years ago. It's called the Affordable Care Act.
891845098069164033 2017-07-30 02:16:55 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 6/ One more thing: Democrats don't have to rise to your petulant challenge to "come up with something better" than you did...
891844781931986945 2017-07-30 02:15:40 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 5/ Rarely are we so united as a people these days, yet you managed to unite over 4/5ths of us against you. Heckuva job! *golf clap*
891843752721088512 2017-07-30 02:11:34 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 3/ Your Senate leader wrote the skinny repeal text over lunch less than 24 hours before he demanded y'all vote on it. Some leader you got.
891842664576036866 2017-07-30 02:07:15 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 2/ It's that for over 7 yrs you have had NO OTHER GOAL than to repeal it & haven't come up w/anything remotely workable, much less better.
891841902789750787 2017-07-30 02:04:13 UTC <fabredhead> @politico 1/ Your repeated failure to repeal the ACA is not due to Senate rules, or Democrats standing firmly against you, or anything like that.
