970464336949866497 2018-03-04 01:01:42 UTC <3BetDan> @ReaganBattalion Come on, your smarter than that. The GOP cant run on their policy ideas so they invent culture wars to motivate their voters.  (Tax cuts arent even polling that well with Rs so they have to resort to us vs them fear). Pathetic.
970434837038247938 2018-03-04 23:04:29 UTC <3BetDan> @RyanAFournier @jimcb1664 It was also gun free all of the days he wasn't in attendance.
970434169015697408 2018-03-04 23:01:50 UTC <3BetDan> @ericgeller @DevinNunes is a snowflake
970423407627059201 2018-03-04 22:19:04 UTC <3BetDan> @RyanAFournier If guns make everyone safer, then why was CPAC a gun free zone?
970340430993764353 2018-03-04 16:49:21 UTC <3BetDan> @andylassner And @DevinNunes hates California so much that he wont leave.

969973946501152768 2018-03-03 16:33:04 UTC <3BetDan> Ever seen a politician with more contempt for his home state and the people he was elected to represent?  And PS you voted for the tax bill that took away a lot of our deductions making it MORE expensive to live here.https://twitter.com/devinnunes/status/969752756800991232
969797611598196736 2018-03-02 04:52:23 UTC <3BetDan> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt Just admit you got conned, like every single non-racist who voted for him will eventually have to admit as well.
969712383621971970 2018-03-02 23:13:43 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom @Liz_Wheeler @soblessed1962 So which is it?  We should be worried about getting nuked by Russia or not be worried because DJT is working for Putin?  Can't be both.
969658482881216512 2018-03-02 19:39:32 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom @Liz_Wheeler Maybe because Russia said they can nuke us at any time and our President is tweeting about Alec Baldwin?
969631969943277568 2018-03-02 17:54:11 UTC <3BetDan> This is just more liberal bias against @realDonaldTrump; he woke up this morning and immediately starting tweeting about @AlecBaldwin.  What more do you want from him?https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/969463010744877056
969571970818830336 2018-03-02 13:55:46 UTC <3BetDan> @WellingtonRandy Nah, hes just watching Fox and Friends, nothing to worry about. And incidentally, head writer for that show might be the powerful job in the world.
969316599135059968 2018-03-01 21:01:00 UTC <3BetDan> I cant think of anything less America First than taking jobs away from American workers who make American beer, while simultaneously making that American beer more expensive for Americans who drink it. #MAGAhttps://twitter.com/millercoors/status/969312916745973761
969232421144076288 2018-03-01 15:26:31 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom Translation: even though I now dont agree with him on my 2 major issues, I will vote for him anyway to own the libs.

966790912851374081 2018-02-22 21:44:50 UTC <3BetDan> @MeetThePress @TheSullyDC In a bizarre twist, I disagree with you.  Young people skew liberal as we all know but have very low participation rates in elections; not getting shot to death before math class could be the issue that gets them to the polls.  4M new active voters motivated around a single issue
966775529532633088 2018-02-22 20:43:42 UTC <3BetDan> @marcorubio @lisskron @SashaBelleSun @MadBerenson @ReaganBattalion @LeslieArnoldH2O He said Pulse was a motivating factor in running again and then has done nothing since then except make it more likely we have more mass shootings. 100% voting record with the NRA in his career but THIS time hes going to grow a pair?  Come on.
966774176240447488 2018-02-22 20:38:20 UTC <3BetDan> @MeetThePress @TheSullyDC True but I think theyre squirming more because they realize that 18 year olds have finally found a single issue to mobilize and vote around, and with 4M new young voters excited to go to the polls to cast 100% against NRA pols, they might actually be in trouble.
966729549818953728 2018-02-22 17:41:00 UTC <3BetDan> @marcorubio @lisskron @SashaBelleSun @MadBerenson @ReaganBattalion @LeslieArnoldH2O Ill bet if a vote is brought to the floor that the NRA doesnt support, Rubio wont support it either.

He has not once voted in favor of any legislation that might reduce gun violence. Not once.
966715760587374592 2018-02-22 16:46:12 UTC <3BetDan> More guns are the solution to greater public safety...except at Trump rallies and NRA speeches where they are absolutely not allowed in order to guarantee public safety.https://twitter.com/jivedurkey/status/966701319795945473
966684373314551813 2018-02-22 14:41:29 UTC <3BetDan> So strange that the lobbying organization tasked with selling more guns thinks that the solution to too many dead people from guns is...wait for it...selling more guns.https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/966537522409910272

966540414265171968 2018-02-21 05:09:26 UTC <3BetDan> @marcorubio @ReaganBattalion @MOTRPolitics1 Really?  Give him credit for listening to the concerns of the people he works for?  Is this how low the bar is now?  I guess everyone really does get a participation trophy these days - even US Senators.
966539616370155520 2018-02-21 05:06:16 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom A few guns in the hands of citizens will definitely stop the full power of the US Military, should it come to that.  Good point.

966442240049430528 2018-02-21 22:39:20 UTC <3BetDan> @JoyAnnReid Agreed. Arming school teachers is a terrible idea and doesnt address other shootings like Vegas, Pulse, Texas Church. Asssukt weapon ban and background checks is the only solution
966335610410622977 2018-02-21 15:35:37 UTC <3BetDan> I dont know what makes me sadder: that there are Americans heartless enough to attack the #Parkland kids with insane conspiracy theories or that there are so many Americans dumb enough to believe them.

965452862351273984 2018-02-18 05:07:54 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @coast4life Then please tell all the GOP politicians you voted for you believe this and maybe no more kids will get slaughtered.

965447350528327681 2018-02-18 04:46:00 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 If guns make everyone safer why didnt Trump allow his supporters to openly carry guns at any of his rallies?

964272244607172613 2018-02-15 22:56:33 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom Then lets just abolish all laws.   What completely moronic logic this NRA talking point is.
964216648067461120 2018-02-15 19:15:37 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom So we should get rid of all metal detectors in airports because evil people will find a way to hijack the plane no matter what anyway?  Sound logic from the NRA crew as usual.

Mass shootings every single month and Congress does literally nothing to try to prevent it from happening again.
963931949369778176 2018-02-14 00:24:20 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom There were armed officers at the school, aka good guys with guns, and 17 kids were still murdered.   Your logic is asinine.
963901172359843845 2018-02-14 22:22:02 UTC <3BetDan> @ReaganBattalion Thoughts and prayers doesnt work. Maybe time for a new strategy of actually doing something to try to stop this from happening again?
963893756146561024 2018-02-14 21:52:34 UTC <3BetDan> Why aren't "thoughts and prayers" working to prevent mass shootings? It seems like such a fool-proof policy that should be getting concrete results by now.  Enlighten me.

961253720783646720 2018-02-07 15:02:00 UTC <3BetDan> @AriFleischer Come on. This is like accusing W Bush of being complicit in terrorism because, as President, he wanted to know everything about Al Qaeda after 9/11.  I used to think you were smart but youre just another partisan hack with no desire to be intellectually consistent.

960523358885462016 2018-02-05 14:39:49 UTC <3BetDan> Since the stock market moves solely because of Trumps great brain, hell be accepting responsibility for my portfolio losing 10% in the last 3 trading sessions any minute now, right?
959565198687289345 2018-02-02 23:12:25 UTC <3BetDan> @NateSilver538 Even dumber if he realized that almost none of the forgotten men and women who voted for him benefit from stocks going up because they dont own any.
959563320910004226 2018-02-02 23:04:58 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom Valid attempt, Joe, but 90%+ of Republicans dont care about logic or intellectual consistency.

958107060737986560 2018-01-29 22:38:18 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 Thought experiment: name 1 thing you think Trump has done wrong.
957421221376802821 2018-01-27 01:13:01 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @hopalong85 Excellent counterpoint, sir, supported by data and logic in response to my factual comment.
957420680508686337 2018-01-27 01:10:52 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @notchjohnson @nafstropslts I know Im in for a highly intelligent and well-reasoned debate when someone starts their first comment with libtard.
957379074262908929 2018-01-27 22:25:33 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @AlVomSteeg If the Republican policies in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, etc are so much more effective than those in CA, why are those ranked in the bottom of everything?  And why dont you live there?
957282946901159936 2018-01-27 16:03:34 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 Name the poorest states. Name the states with the worst education systems. Name the states with the lowest life expectancy. Notice a pattern?  Hint: theyre all red.
956639031445544960 2018-01-25 21:24:53 UTC <3BetDan> @ChrisMurphyCT Yes. Numb and helpless because 1 of our 2 political parties not only wont take any action to prevent the next one, they actively work to ENSURE that there will be a next one.
956533987756802054 2018-01-25 14:27:28 UTC <3BetDan> @AlanMCole @TheSullyDC Agree with this. Felt like a new era of crowdsourced police work - was riveting watching unfold in real time on Twitter - but then it turned out that a majority of the info floating around was wrong. Remember when they thought it was the missing Brown student?

955510895945199616 2018-01-22 18:42:04 UTC <3BetDan> @DNC @RealJamesWoods DACA recipients cant vote. Sorry.
955216201717723136 2018-01-21 23:11:04 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @teamjustice2018 @KLG3187 DACAs did not commit a crime by coming here anymore than a 7 year old American commits a crime when his parents break the law. They were vetted before being admitted into the program and make positive contributions to our communities. We should honor the promises made to them.
955200945352196096 2018-01-21 22:10:26 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 Do better research. Not even FAIR says the number is that high and many conservative analysts put the number at closer to 80B or less.
955200549573484544 2018-01-21 22:08:52 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 Why are you making assumptions about my politics on the issue? All I initially said was that DACA + future illegal immigration are 2 separate issues. My fault for engaging with the expectation of a real convo. In your defense you did wait longer to start hurling insults than most
955197534334476288 2018-01-21 21:56:53 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 What is the cost of illegal immigration?
955195237852327936 2018-01-21 21:47:46 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 Why are you against DACA?
955195132940230656 2018-01-21 21:47:21 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 I think 18B is massive waste of money considering how many other issues could benefit from those tax $, but nobody wants totally open boarders and almost everyone wants DACA. Making it an either/or issue is stupid because they actually have very little to do with each other.
955185233501945856 2018-01-21 21:08:00 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 @KLG3187 So youre all for DACA?
955181678737031168 2018-01-21 20:53:53 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 Why do you intentionally confuse trying to curb future illegal immigration with DACA. Oh wait, I know why.
955113666185056256 2018-01-21 16:23:37 UTC <3BetDan> Still waiting for the moral outrage from the religious right over their President comitting adultery with a porn star while his 3rd wife was home with their 4 month old son.  #BiggestHypocritesOnEarth

954230920990486528 2018-01-18 05:55:54 UTC <3BetDan> @charliekirk11 Since the Russian investigation is a hoax why do Republicans continue to try to stop it every chance they get?
953700739133603840 2018-01-17 18:49:09 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom This is absolutely true, but hes guaranteeing the GOP stays dead.
952775855276572672 2018-01-14 05:34:00 UTC <3BetDan> @MarkSKrikorian @FoxNews Trump has spent $100M of our money on golf vacations...in less than a year.  Please shut up.
952427754628120577 2018-01-13 06:30:46 UTC <3BetDan> Congrats, @GOP, you got your tax cuts.  All your donors got slightly richer.  Way to go.  Can you now please impeach this shithole President so we can move on? #MuellerTime
952301848332976128 2018-01-13 22:10:28 UTC <3BetDan> The dude live tweets Fox and Friends every single day but cant find his phone to quickly reassure every American that were not under attack?  Couldnt be bothered while on the golf course I guess. #WeHaveNoPresident
952300076327579648 2018-01-13 22:03:25 UTC <3BetDan> @WalshFreedom Totally bad timing for a missile scare; almost disrupted his golf outing.

952231397942484993 2018-01-13 17:30:31 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC Yes you were. Update: my golf cart today has a charger.
952025416687955968 2018-01-12 03:52:01 UTC <3BetDan> If you own a poker room in 2018 and dont have cell phone chargers built into every table, you should lose your gaming license.
951891406628384768 2018-01-12 18:59:31 UTC <3BetDan> Guys, Im shocked, SHOCKED, that the racist man who has been racist his whole life and campaigned as a racist, and won the election as a racist, is still a racist now that hes President.  I mean, who could have possibly seen this coming?
951481424959258624 2018-01-11 15:50:24 UTC <3BetDan> The worst part about Trump being President is that now I know what happens on Fox and Friends on a minute by minute basis every day.
951477223692709889 2018-01-11 15:33:42 UTC <3BetDan> @AriFleischer Its been a few months, but worth remembering: the GOP has yet to explain why theyre undermining the rule of law to protect President Trump.
951224241537478656 2018-01-10 22:48:26 UTC <3BetDan> @Marissa_Hewitt @kristenbrockman Thats literally exactly what I was telling Mari...squirrel!!!!!!

951151889625759744 2018-01-10 18:00:56 UTC <3BetDan> @mattmfm @litknitgrit Definitely losing money but he essentially bought it out of foreclosure getting $100M+ worth of land for ~$20M. Hes waaaaay ahead on that investment.

951107031049498625 2018-01-10 15:02:41 UTC <3BetDan> @mattmfm Trump National Los Angeles is on a cliff right above the Pacific in Palos Verdes. Not technically beachfront but definitely oceanfront as you can see the water from every shot on the course.   He didnt excempt CA because its a blue state, but your tweet is misleading.
950777715216416768 2018-01-09 17:14:06 UTC <3BetDan> @realDonaldTrump @BillOReilly So youre saying that because he doesnt have dementia he just simply never learned the words to the National Anthem?    Because it has to be one of the two.
950555117345894405 2018-01-08 02:29:35 UTC <3BetDan> I want @mcuban to run if only to watch him say to @realDonaldTrump in a debate: Ill donate $1M to the charity of your choice if you can recite the National Anthem right now.
950553953304944642 2018-01-08 02:24:57 UTC <3BetDan> He doesnt even know the words to the National Anthem.    Im sure all the deep thinkers at Fox will have TONS to say about this incredible display of disrespect. #crickets
950436368311701504 2018-01-08 18:37:43 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC Thats a solid argument: My life will only get better AFTER I die in a fiery plane crash at the hands of a TV star trying to fly a 737 for the first time, with no training.  Stable geniuses, obviously.
950419319883677696 2018-01-08 17:29:58 UTC <3BetDan> Rooting for the President to fail is like rooting for the pilot of your plane to fail is a stupid argument when you elect a pilot who has literally never flown a plane before.    I respect Oprah as much as anyone, but can we PLEASE find someone who has flown the plane before?
950089195971756032 2018-01-07 19:38:10 UTC <3BetDan> @RNCResearch @GOP @brianstelter @CNN @seanspicer He made an honest mistake, and then made a correction and apology when he realized it. You still havent even admitted to lying daily to the American public.   You are dishonest and apparently also extremely stupid thinking you have any right to call someone out about truth.

927638238235320320 2017-11-06 20:46:05 UTC <3BetDan> @NRA @benshapiro @LoveLivingWild I dont accept that its impossible to reduce the frequency of mass shootings. You clearly do by espousing a ridiculous all/none argument.
927607735658487808 2017-11-06 18:44:52 UTC <3BetDan> @NRA @benshapiro @LoveLivingWild So since we cant stop 100% of mass shootings lets not even try. Sound reasoning.
927605785051389952 2017-11-06 18:37:07 UTC <3BetDan> @NRA @benshapiro @LoveLivingWild So, once again, your take is 26 dead is an acceptable outcome and no future action is needed to keep communities safe from gun violence.
927602498981961728 2017-11-06 18:24:04 UTC <3BetDan> @NRA @benshapiro Just so were clear, youre celebrating 26 dead as successful result of your good guy with a gun strategy. Great work @nra 
927580326439796736 2017-11-06 16:55:58 UTC <3BetDan> @BillOReilly Isnt it ironic that the party that consistently demonizes people who dont try to help themselves says we wont try re: gun control?
927574221277949952 2017-11-06 16:31:42 UTC <3BetDan> @BrittMcHenry @PieGrandePG The good guy with a gun argument falls flat when their BEST CASE example of this strategy working is 26 dead people.
927531592024711170 2017-11-06 13:42:18 UTC <3BetDan> @JasonKander @5heartrating But what if theyre prayers from Congressmen/Senators who take millions from the NRA?  THOSE prayers usually work, right?

927404826689921024 2017-11-05 05:18:35 UTC <3BetDan> @gehrig38 So 26 people shot and killed is a shining example of your arm everyone plan working?

922097791333146624 2017-10-22 13:50:19 UTC <3BetDan> @JeffPassan @TheSullyDC 50% chance of anything happening.
921910802390515712 2017-10-21 01:27:18 UTC <3BetDan> @JeffPassan @TheSullyDC True, but also probably a moot point since I doubt the Nats could have got past LA
921569470438563840 2017-10-20 02:50:58 UTC <3BetDan> @DonaldJTrumpJr Its true, hes an asshole to everyone. Probably including you too.

917867443749470208 2017-10-10 21:40:26 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren How many at FoxNews have come out against OReilly, Ailes, Trump?  Zero.  Go away.
917604417502720000 2017-10-09 04:15:16 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren Bash Trump for his history of sexual assaults or STFU
917593053501599744 2017-10-09 03:30:06 UTC <3BetDan> @RealDeanCain @FoxNews @TheSullyDC And why is on the channel that says Hollywood elites are out of touch and shouldnt talk politics? Hypocrisy is dead.
916841615955697665 2017-10-07 01:44:09 UTC <3BetDan> @ReaganBattalion Terrible take. Millions of women need birth control for medical reasons not risky sexual behavior like GOP fake Christian hypocrites claim

916817872084594688 2017-10-07 00:09:49 UTC <3BetDan> @nycsouthpaw @jmartNYT Because they know their base better than the pundits?  GOP used to be party of no now its party hatred of HRC and Obama, no matter what.

916184437561241600 2017-10-05 06:12:46 UTC <3BetDan> @Marissa_Hewitt Counter argument; nothing he says matters and already nobody in our govt or any other govt takes him seriously.
916136914259812352 2017-10-05 03:03:56 UTC <3BetDan> @charliespiering @TheSullyDC @pietrmi And he got impeached for it. Cant wait to see Trump go down for way worse. Treason > BJ
915570889730646017 2017-10-04 13:34:45 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC Alternative take: the Las Vegas police were already good guys with guns.
915567872012828674 2017-10-04 13:22:45 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC If only everyone at the concert had guns and just started wildly firing back at the Hotel then nobody would have been hurt.

915378478693748737 2017-10-03 00:50:10 UTC <3BetDan> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @DeplorableVetrn I'm impressed how long you held out before making a false equivalency involving Obama or Hillary. Usually it comes in the 1st response. 
915328075537063936 2017-10-03 21:29:53 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @Skyqueen1969 Do you support abortion laws even though don't prevent 100% of abortions?  Do you support drug laws? Laws against bank robberies?
915266612550295552 2017-10-03 17:25:39 UTC <3BetDan> @seanmdav Why? He never said anything about eliminating all guns or individual right to protect oneself - problem is 1 man having 19 high powered guns
915241235085852673 2017-10-03 15:44:49 UTC <3BetDan> @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Let's just get rid of laws all together and disband the government because evidently there are no solutions to anything.
915240426348486657 2017-10-03 15:41:36 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @DeplorableVetrn @desertlizzy I know right?  Using resources to protect people instead of doing nothing!?!  What a crazy notion.
915092772289261568 2017-10-02 05:54:53 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @avis_cheri These type of regular shootings only happen here so we must just have more evil people than all the other countries then?
915079445643276289 2017-10-02 05:01:55 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @Skyqueen1969 So if he didn't alter them he would have only killed 30 people?  Tremendous argument.
915055759976566786 2017-10-02 03:27:48 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics @DeplorableVetrn So don't even try? When a building burns down we know we can't stop all fires but try to learn + prevent the next one. With guns, we shrug
915053643132321793 2017-10-02 03:19:24 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics @DeplorableVetrn Columbine, wrong.  Virginia Tech, wrong. Sandy Hook, wrong.  Pulse night club, wrong. San Bernadino, wrong.
915053314491817984 2017-10-02 03:18:05 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics @DeplorableVetrn Disagree because a ban worked in Australia, but for argument's sake, walk me through how you would have stopped this guy.
915051604990091264 2017-10-02 03:11:18 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @DeplorableVetrn @stormypolitics So what's the point of having any laws or law enforcement about anything then right?

915049947174625280 2017-10-02 03:04:42 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics @DeplorableVetrn True, there would be no mass shootings without crazy people, but there would also be no mass shootings without guns. #fact
915049374954045442 2017-10-02 03:02:26 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics From what I'm sure is your preferred "news" source - FoxNews.pic.twitter.com/xoBjzSJ1yJ
915046538262364160 2017-10-02 02:51:10 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @peacekeeper232 It appears so far that every gun he had was legally purchased.
915046415130255360 2017-10-02 02:50:40 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @stormypolitics If I said assault instead of automatic, would that make my point more valid?
915046244912816128 2017-10-02 02:50:00 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @Jeny_8675309 And both of those are illegal. You're making my point for me. If we don't want dangers in our society, we make it illegal...except guns.
915045879899287552 2017-10-02 02:48:33 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren @DeplorableVetrn Yes, this happened and then Europe took steps to try to prevent the next one. We won't do anything to try to prevent the next one.
915033460611235840 2017-10-02 01:59:12 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren Correct, but why do we have to make it easier for them to get automatic weapons?
914855018670333953 2017-10-02 14:10:08 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC Can't fix crazy. Same result if he had a knife. Oh wait.
914356079034753024 2017-09-30 05:07:31 UTC <3BetDan> This. Trump made obvious who he was early + often during the campaign. Painful to watch many friends + family defend him 100% of the timehttps://twitter.com/traecrowder/status/914165892463730688
914319503328083968 2017-09-30 02:42:11 UTC <3BetDan> @SecPriceMD @CLewandowski_ @FoxNews So when is POTUS paying us back for his weekly golf trips?
914232381917216768 2017-09-30 20:56:00 UTC <3BetDan> @FoxNews What happened to sticking to sports?  PS Curt: how's your video game biz going?

912923221900619777 2017-09-26 06:13:52 UTC <3BetDan> @ReaganBattalion HuffPo is as unreadable as FoxNews is unwatchable; both employ moronic "journalists" spewing partisan BS that only appeals to other morons.

912372059921047552 2017-09-25 17:43:44 UTC <3BetDan> We should have a civil debate about the substance and form of protest, but there should NO debate about the right to peacefully protest. 1A

911949487991513090 2017-09-24 13:44:35 UTC <3BetDan> @IngrahamAngle @TheSullyDC He's white so he's allowed to have 1A rights. Just like the Miss America contestant.
911629204562706433 2017-09-23 16:31:54 UTC <3BetDan> Trump is 100% a racist but at this point we have to know every single human is a possible target of a personal attack, except for Putin.
911580938676486146 2017-09-23 13:20:06 UTC <3BetDan> @brithume @TheSullyDC You know why: POTUS is a abject failure + his base needs people to blame for their shitty lives. Minorites, celebrities, the literate, etc.

906995693457248256 2017-09-10 21:39:59 UTC <3BetDan> @DoxNLex The answer is zero. The only states he's voluntarily visited were red or where he can make money off playing golf on our dime.

906328034344497152 2017-09-08 01:26:56 UTC <3BetDan> @DavidAFrench @TheSullyDC This narrative was invented as a way for the uneducated to show disdain for educated, and then to be exploited by "anti-elite" politicians.
905225584610914304 2017-09-05 00:26:12 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren Only if you explain why the "pro-business" party thinks erasing $400B from the GDP is a good idea first.
905201505413750784 2017-09-05 22:50:31 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @TheSullyDC They have the WH, Senate, & House, yet the only thing they can accomplish is blaming Obama. Their utter incompetence is saving America.

902546731681832963 2017-08-29 15:01:23 UTC <3BetDan> Is it totally outrageous for me to think that if this hurricane had hit a blue state Trump wouldn't care?

852933026413662209 2017-04-14 17:14:14 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren If you think the war on terror is over b/c 36 militants are dead, you might be a dumb conservative who doesn't understand the word victory.
852916373034381312 2017-04-14 16:08:04 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @Jameson_2016 You mean taking credit for deals that were done 2 years ago? Or getting Obamacare repealed?  Or building the wall?  So much winning 
852904446237351936 2017-04-14 15:20:40 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP True or False: our "President" is at his golf course instead of the White House as WWWIII might break out any minute.
851808465899069442 2017-04-11 14:45:38 UTC <3BetDan> @ddale8 @KFILE Do Republicans believe in anything other than "we don't like the black guy who was President"?
851697593016918016 2017-04-11 07:25:04 UTC <3BetDan> I wonder how many congrats/angry constituent calls @farenthold got today for his #PulitzerPrize winning reporting on @POTUS. CC @Fahrenthold
848781322721968128 2017-04-02 06:16:51 UTC <3BetDan> There sure were a lot of country music performances during that 3 hour long Las Vegas Tourism commercial. #ACMs #ACMawards2017
847886817726615553 2017-03-31 19:02:24 UTC <3BetDan> @POTUS @KellyannePolls You did it! We're united! That was just as easy as repealing Obamacare!
845721999649366016 2017-03-25 19:40:12 UTC <3BetDan> @Marissa_Hewitt He's a zero tool player. Although he is a giant tool.
845363133237477376 2017-03-24 19:54:11 UTC <3BetDan> @jonlovett They are the dumbest of the dumb; thankfully for us, who will benefit from their incompetence. #MakeAmericaDumbAgain
844664763904737280 2017-03-22 21:39:07 UTC <3BetDan> @BenSasse Perhaps get your colleagues to care that Russia interfered in our election first?  Their inaction is far more reckless.
843190159252246528 2017-03-18 19:59:34 UTC <3BetDan> @WhiteHouse @maxwell_benji Yawn. State's rights for everything except things R's don't like pot, enviro standards, gay marriage. Hypocrites

840563882145996800 2017-03-11 14:03:41 UTC <3BetDan> @Harvard @GOP Harvard?!? How could you guys nominate an elitist snowflake? I bet he even likes Hollywood movies too. Not a real American.
840267894822903808 2017-03-10 18:27:32 UTC <3BetDan> @realDonaldTrump @JerryArk More accurately, working day and night on his golf game.
840200645332291584 2017-03-10 14:00:18 UTC <3BetDan> @POTUS @PressSec I thought you no talent ass clowns said those numbers were fake?

838040072419069954 2017-03-04 14:54:57 UTC <3BetDan> @zachbraff Luckily the journalists weren't fooled by 1 hr on TelePrompTer. Only inane pundits and gullible Americans got conned (again).

835931688093954048 2017-02-26 19:16:59 UTC <3BetDan> @TomiLahren Give me a break. Your President is scared of a few jokes at his expense. Who's the real snowflake?
834517667759353860 2017-02-22 21:38:11 UTC <3BetDan> @Karpidiem11 @RagnarsPlight Which was more a result of gerrymandering and voter suppression than a reflection of shift in voter tendencies.

834515618913062914 2017-02-22 21:30:02 UTC <3BetDan> @Karpidiem11 @RagnarsPlight absolutely correct. And as soon as they stop listening, we are free to vote them out. Which we will.
834512651522707456 2017-02-22 21:18:15 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @RagnarsPlight @Karpidiem11 wait for the "you lost, get over it" response in 3, 2, 1....
834511928076623872 2017-02-22 21:15:22 UTC <3BetDan> @DaBirdDaPlane I know, right? The nerve of people expressing their desire to not die as a result of @GOP taking away their health insurance.
834498323914465280 2017-02-22 20:21:19 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP Keep dodging those town halls, guys.  Impressive courage and representation of your constituents!
833443456961744897 2017-02-19 22:29:39 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC We knew this already. Shep and Wallace have already turned against him. Let's just hope he doesn't start watching Tomi instead.
833180912888082432 2017-02-18 05:06:24 UTC <3BetDan> @ProudDad you're making incorrect assumptions and didn't answer my question. We can be done now. Good luck.
833174769612656641 2017-02-18 04:41:59 UTC <3BetDan> @ProudDad wouldn't you agree defending the press and getting to the bottom of Russia interference should be #1 priority on both sides?
833174502850727936 2017-02-18 04:40:55 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @SpeakerRyan @ProudDad Lots. But doesn't matter. Can't even debate policy while the GOP sits idly watching POTUS dismantle democracy
833173130151473152 2017-02-18 04:35:28 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @SpeakerRyan @ProudDad The damage to our democracy Ryan & @gop is allowing, so they can ram thru their agenda is disgusting and treasonous.
833159253380587520 2017-02-18 03:40:20 UTC <3BetDan> @SpeakerRyan @ProudDad Is it like his ACA replacement plan?  You know, imaginary?
833106323822645249 2017-02-18 00:10:00 UTC <3BetDan> @SpeakerRyan As long as you lower taxes for the rich, and take away health care from the poor, who cares about our Democracy right?
833096128530747392 2017-02-18 23:29:29 UTC <3BetDan> @realDonaldTrump @MelbournePolice @sadsackjetsfan They said 9000, not 9.
833044834168352768 2017-02-18 20:05:40 UTC <3BetDan> Anyone who says the press, Americans who didn't vote for him, and anyone who disagrees with him are the enemy, is the REAL enemy of America.
833005074729177088 2017-02-18 17:27:40 UTC <3BetDan> @JWGOP Giving tax cuts to the rich and taking health insurance away from poor people is more important. You should know that by now.

831635174853005312 2017-02-14 22:44:11 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC Agree. Obv he wants to be POTUS and GOP would rather have him than Trump. Serious House of Cards shit playing out in real life.
831608847756242944 2017-02-14 20:59:34 UTC <3BetDan> @Evan_McMullin Totally insufficient. But at least we have real patriots @washingtonpost and @nytimes that will do the GOP's job for them.

830621309470072832 2017-02-11 03:35:27 UTC <3BetDan> @slone Ironic coming from the party who said "you're either with us or you're against us" and declared it treasonous to even question GWB.
830599076320210946 2017-02-11 02:07:06 UTC <3BetDan> @Reuters I thought Mexico was paying for it?  Why does he care what it costs if the US tax payer isn't getting stuck with the bill?
830428115474083840 2017-02-11 14:47:45 UTC <3BetDan> @jasoninthehouse @jonfavs He denies the fact that those are his constituents at his own peril bc they will ALL be voting him out.
830084205325357056 2017-02-10 16:01:11 UTC <3BetDan> @dbcfromdc damn it, I was just about to launch my own light fixture line on Monday. Oh well. Good luck, I guess.
829400018645721088 2017-02-08 18:42:28 UTC <3BetDan> @jack @goldengateblond But maybe it's good for business - all his attacks on the NYT drove up subscriptions!

828690414693556224 2017-02-06 19:42:45 UTC <3BetDan> @oreillyfactor @BenSasse Can you remind your @GOP colleagues of this please so maybe they can also stand up TO Trump and FOR America.

826916684959084544 2017-02-01 22:14:35 UTC <3BetDan> @mattyglesias Weird, I was at Home Depot in SoCal this morning and thought the same thing.
826435317678759937 2017-01-31 14:21:48 UTC <3BetDan> @JuddApatow @democracynow @tparsi The scariest scenario is that President Bannon knew this and it's exactly what he wants.
826303965880938496 2017-01-30 05:39:52 UTC <3BetDan> @sacca my friend is an Army Dr. When I asked what she would do if Trump won and went rouge: "I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution."
825895872810455041 2017-01-29 02:38:15 UTC <3BetDan> @catehall @TuckonSports Ditto. The stock market hates uncertainty more than anything so I really wonder how much more it can stand.

825211313261457409 2017-01-27 05:18:03 UTC <3BetDan> Only 1 thing is absolutely clear; Congressional members of the GOP don't love America, Americans or The Constitution; they simply love power
824626808440000513 2017-01-26 14:35:26 UTC <3BetDan> @TheSullyDC @WellingtonRandy What GOP? They finally get power and the 1st thing they do is charge taxpayers $14B for a wall. #limitedgovtobv
823969549921857536 2017-01-24 19:03:43 UTC <3BetDan> @ddale8 I'll take "Logic" for $500, Alec.
823216751521382400 2017-01-22 17:12:22 UTC <3BetDan> @catehall @MeetThePress The Press should call their bluff. Attention is like oxygen to Trump.

818574581996789760 2017-01-09 21:46:03 UTC <3BetDan> @HUSTLERCASINOLA @TuckonSports Sounds like @3BetdotUS must be there. 
817399147049451520 2017-01-06 15:55:17 UTC <3BetDan> @realDonaldTrump @VP @SenSchumer @GOP Because Dems want to work together for Americans while all you do (and @MitchMcConell) is obstruct.
817142887594889216 2017-01-05 22:57:00 UTC <3BetDan> @sacca wife had 2 challenging pregnancies. Tons of tests + care covered by ACA that wouldn't have been. 2 healthy healthy kids now! TY Obama

816743280272666628 2017-01-04 20:29:07 UTC <3BetDan> @SenateGOP @mike_pence That's not what I said. I asked for details of replacement plan (that they don't have after 6 years)
816733769197420544 2017-01-04 19:51:19 UTC <3BetDan> @SenateGOP @mike_pence You've had 6 years to work on the "replace" part.  What can you show us?  Spoiler: absolutely nothing.

788752147579965440 2016-10-19 14:42:20 UTC <3BetDan> More proof that bad press is good press: I just tried a pumpkin spice latte simply bc @kairyssdal always talks about how much he hates it.
787943953257472000 2016-10-17 09:10:52 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker For GOP voters,  their hatred of HRC justifies it all.  For GOP in Congress, their love of power justifies it all.
787511201777324032 2016-10-15 04:31:16 UTC <3BetDan> @chrislhayes same software as @marcorubio ?
787430543356862464 2016-10-15 23:10:45 UTC <3BetDan> @AndrewLuria @MajorCBS And that message is appealing to 40% of Americans. He might be right about America, but not for the reasons he says.
785942120548794368 2016-10-11 20:36:18 UTC <3BetDan> Twitter is so boring whenever @realDonaldTrump skips his hourly meltdown.
785913017217101824 2016-10-11 18:40:39 UTC <3BetDan> @GovPenceIN @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump @fox5sandiego @AndrewLuria Maybe the neighbor graffitied his own sign. #GOPCivilWar

785145961257455616 2016-10-09 15:52:39 UTC <3BetDan> @JonAguiar @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ScottBaio it took him 18 months, but he finally found a way to insult white men also.
784962857217634304 2016-10-08 03:45:03 UTC <3BetDan> @HillaryClinton @elizabethforma @MartyHill_MN she defended her HUSBAND. Which Melania also did today. Doesn't make the wives bad people.
784847876526440448 2016-10-08 20:08:10 UTC <3BetDan> Men: # of times you have heard someone openly brag in a locker room abt sexually assaulting a woman (not getting laid, but actual assault)?
784844880522596352 2016-10-08 19:56:15 UTC <3BetDan> Women who defend @realDonaldTrump: please explain to me again how you're experts on what men talk about in the locker room?
784782573448736768 2016-10-08 15:48:40 UTC <3BetDan> @owillis @chrislhayes According the Breitbart, this storm was also fabricated for political purposes. Except that, like Matthew, it's real.
784760603348828160 2016-10-08 14:21:22 UTC <3BetDan> @jonfavs Disagreed with, but had respect for McCain, Ryan. Immediately lost it when they endorsed Trump initially. Now it's far worse.
784597972281614337 2016-10-07 03:35:08 UTC <3BetDan> @Mitch_Stewart @chrislhayes they won't say anything because they don't care about them.
784595340842430464 2016-10-07 03:24:40 UTC <3BetDan> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @elizabethforma You really think the @gop will suddenly grow a conscience now?
784594470151094272 2016-10-07 03:21:13 UTC <3BetDan> @HerbertForUtah Or, it's more politically advantageous for you to jump ship now.  Every @GOP who supported him should lose their job.
784583183337721856 2016-10-07 02:36:22 UTC <3BetDan> @davidplouffe But it appears that 99% of @GOP has no conscience, so can't really see them turning on Trump now.
784563860426686464 2016-10-07 01:19:35 UTC <3BetDan> @SopanDeb too late now. If the @GOP couldn't predict that Trump would sink their whole ship, then they ALL deserve to lose their seats.
784031401104465927 2016-10-06 14:03:47 UTC <3BetDan> @FoxNews @jonfavs this actually makes him PERFECTLY representative of GOP voters; no intellectual curiosity other than what is fed them on @foxnews
783467433491259393 2016-10-04 00:42:46 UTC <3BetDan> @AndrewLuria @washingtonpost you spelled "incompetence" wrong. It doesn't start with a "p"

780611767063810049 2016-09-26 03:35:22 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker in unrelated news, 27% of cnn viewers polled don't know the definition of "won."
780605278043582464 2016-09-26 03:09:35 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker not a chance in hell.

779452817094258688 2016-09-23 22:50:07 UTC <3BetDan> @chrislhayes @scottlincicome @politico American's lack of knowledge abt "policy" and "issues" and "facts" can't be surprising at this point
778261083240837120 2016-09-20 15:54:36 UTC <3BetDan> @kairyssdal Gotta give the people what they want...
778068348441534466 2016-09-19 03:08:44 UTC <3BetDan> @mcuban yes, that's a big symptom of all unstable governments.
778032292396605440 2016-09-19 00:45:28 UTC <3BetDan> @mcuban This!  The #1 reason 3rd World countries are 3rd World countries is lack of stable gov't.
777592006751027200 2016-09-18 19:35:56 UTC <3BetDan> @jonfavs @GlennThrush But if it works, then they're correct about how dumb Americans are though, right?
777566457341222913 2016-09-18 17:54:24 UTC <3BetDan> Sunday: the one day when DC can ignore the horrible racism of the presidential campaign and focus on rooting for the @Redskins.
777276465867988992 2016-09-17 22:42:05 UTC <3BetDan> @badams78 isn't "MIT Wide Receiver" an oxymoron?
777276051617492992 2016-09-17 22:40:26 UTC <3BetDan> Remember: every 2016 Republican nominee said climate change is a hoax and vaccines cause autism. Even if you hate Hillary #Vote4Science
777160965649526784 2016-09-17 15:03:07 UTC <3BetDan> @TheHopsbride @ddale8 Cons only work if someone is stupid enough to fall for them. In this case, there are 50M people who fit the bill.
776848554396569600 2016-09-16 18:21:43 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker logic says that the reason Clinton isn't winning in a landslide is that Trump's worldview aligns w/ most GOP voter's worldview
776803359982366720 2016-09-16 15:22:07 UTC <3BetDan> This, times a million, for every "decent" Republican who isn't standing up to Trump out of self-preservation.https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/776800739687403521

772245813510623232 2016-09-03 01:32:04 UTC <3BetDan> @funnydanny to be fair, there's probably some Top 10 CFB team beating a High School JV team by 97 in the 3rd quarter on a different channel

758842482855583744 2016-07-28 01:52:01 UTC <3BetDan> @SpeakerRyan You sold out American when endorsed Trump.  You could have been President, but now you're a disgrace.  Quit.

756289845882859520 2016-07-21 00:48:45 UTC <3BetDan> @badams78 I was considering this until Trump won. He's too big a threat to US/World/Civilization to stay home and not vote against him.

755454942375215104 2016-07-19 17:31:08 UTC <3BetDan> @jeremyausmus Truth. And I will continue to put up with them because there are no rules when you're addicted.
755425926335180800 2016-07-19 15:35:50 UTC <3BetDan> Hey @Starbucks, at 8am on a Tuesday at a major intersection in Los Angeles you might want more than 2 total employees working.
755139579619921920 2016-07-18 20:38:00 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker I would agree, except that somewhere in the neighborhood of 60M Americans will vote for Trump in Nov.
754381746527801344 2016-07-16 18:26:38 UTC <3BetDan> @RealKidPoker he did the same to my real estate agent when she worked w/ him. Closed the deal then stiffed on commission. Its his biz model.

742552788362657792 2016-06-13 03:02:35 UTC <3BetDan> @Doc_Sands He and I went the same tiny private HS in DC. Imagine him on a football field where the next biggest guy was 6'1", 180lbs.

738044162130333696 2016-06-01 16:26:55 UTC <3BetDan> @chrislhayes Doesn't this fact actually make him more representative of the vast majority of the US population (non-readers)?
737636113968336896 2016-05-31 13:25:28 UTC <3BetDan> @realDonaldTrump And as we all know, the only reason to make a charitable donation is the good publicity one is supposed to get as a result.

736719644103315456 2016-05-28 00:43:45 UTC <3BetDan> Not going to Vegas for WSOP feels very strange, but adding a little girl to the family this morning is a good excuse to stay home.

735594306606489600 2016-05-25 22:12:04 UTC <3BetDan> @LukeRussert @funnydanny I jogged to 1st on a ball I thought I hit out against Riverdale and he absolutely lit me up. As he should have.
734196557122150404 2016-05-21 01:37:54 UTC <3BetDan> @chrislhayes just bunt it straight back to him and dare him to throw it to 1st. He'd go winless the rest of the season.

727560326594486272 2016-05-03 18:07:53 UTC <3BetDan> @KJulius10 had a dream we were playing golf except we were hitting skateboards instead of golf balls. Hope this info doesn't ruin your day.
