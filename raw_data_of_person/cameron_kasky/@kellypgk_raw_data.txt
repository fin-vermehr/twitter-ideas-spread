965575511140335617 2018-02-19 13:15:16 UTC <kellypgk> @JoyAnnReid @JohnWDean Yet, he is exactly as advertised. The majority of white women who elected him in 2016 got exactly what they wanted. Where has he deviated from campaign rhetoric (except the Wall)? Men are a lost cause and I don't see any compelling reason to think women won't boost him again.

884526828622426112 2017-07-10 21:36:44 UTC <kellypgk> @JoyAnnReid @piano61 On a day of your masterful replies this is one of my favs!!!
884381533502672896 2017-07-10 11:59:23 UTC <kellypgk> @BenRothenberg The real evidence is found in Centre Court scheduling through first six days. Decidedly ad-out  @WTA . #wimbledonshame
884050953699295232 2017-07-09 14:05:46 UTC <kellypgk> Twitter activity this morning confirms anew that democracy has been ... Fornicated #vladimiranddonnysittinginatree

884033534687629313 2017-07-09 12:56:33 UTC <kellypgk> @Wimbledon @jon_wertheim @Martina It took until semis last year, right? #shame
884033240675299329 2017-07-09 12:55:23 UTC <kellypgk> @Wimbledon @jon_wertheim 2years running of scheduling disrespect to 5x champ. Better treatment @rolandgarros. Where is punditry's indignation at @WTA CC scheduling?
883835731789189120 2017-07-08 23:50:33 UTC <kellypgk> @carole_bouchard @Wimbledon has been favoring @ATPWorldTour 2:1 over @WTA every day. Journalists need to show less deference and expose the #sexism
883474819706220545 2017-07-07 23:56:25 UTC <kellypgk> @Wimbledon Where's the equity in CC scheduling?  Were @ChrissieEvert and @Martina kept off the big stage the way today's @WTA stars are?
883156463304286208 2017-07-06 02:51:23 UTC <kellypgk> @jon_wertheim Thoughts on Centre Court scheduling please?  Friday will be fifth day of 2/3 @ATPWorldTour matches and just 1/3 @WTA.Sexism?
881538833493393409 2017-07-02 15:43:30 UTC <kellypgk> Enough! People need to speak. Silence isn't merely tacit approval, it's an active choice to accept what should not be ignored. #1A
