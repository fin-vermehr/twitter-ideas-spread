912341464025305088 2017-09-25 15:42:10 UTC <bsg71> @NFL @RapSheet People find that hard to handle. Shall I assume that includes you sir? It is important to close that blind eye and open the clear one so...
912341021442416641 2017-09-25 15:40:24 UTC <bsg71> @NFL @RapSheet Is that just your opinion or are you passing that off as facts? Seems to me that whenever a group, class etc calls out injustices some...
912340395790651394 2017-09-25 15:37:55 UTC <bsg71> @NFL @RapSheet Now I'm a person that judges by content and character not skin color. Where in history did you learn a fist raised was equivalent to kkk?
912339787851460608 2017-09-25 15:35:30 UTC <bsg71> @NFL @RapSheet There's a  difference.  u should research the meaning of a fist raised in the name of black power before u carry on with black supremacist

912302959047827456 2017-09-25 13:09:09 UTC <bsg71> @realDonaldTrump So can you explain the difference? I'm former military and this is a lot more disrespectful to me than kneeling could ever bepic.twitter.com/lwbALurvz4
912292801534156801 2017-09-25 12:28:48 UTC <bsg71> @realDonaldTrump Sir, again you can't hide behind your lies. The reason for the kneeling is a race issue.  It's a anti "bad cop" protest.  Don't spin it
912290393760370688 2017-09-25 12:19:14 UTC <bsg71> @realDonaldTrump You couldn't vet criminals on your staff,  who are you fooling. Or maybe you did....crooked Trump? #oneterm you played  the wrong card

902888261680582656 2017-08-30 13:38:31 UTC <bsg71> @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter if you get impeached or not. You've alienated enough people, you will not be re elected. #voterpower #oneterm #seeya #bye
