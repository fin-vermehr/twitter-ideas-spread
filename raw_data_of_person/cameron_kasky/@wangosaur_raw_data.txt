968094874871435264 2018-02-26 12:06:19 UTC <wangosaur> @mannequinpussy Maybe it's impossible to help the way you feel. Maybe you haven't forgiven that person, but it's more important to make sure those feelings don't affect the way you treat a person. But also don't put yourself in a position where that person can hurt you again. Keep rockin!
