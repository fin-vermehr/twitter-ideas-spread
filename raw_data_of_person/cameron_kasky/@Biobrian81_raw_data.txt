971588455460302848 2018-03-07 03:28:33 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump ... Due to improvements in technology and automation and will continue into the future. The only problem with America right now is lack of factual information and a abundance of misleading information and flat out lies (the later being 90% of what comes from your mouth.#facts
971587670836002816 2018-03-07 03:25:26 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Jesus christ do your supporters actually believe the nonsense that comes out of your fucking mouth. 1st you don't lose money on trade deficits trade deficits are differences in trade between countries. 2nd job reduction in manufacturing has been steady over last 25 years...
971227232227266561 2018-03-06 03:33:11 UTC <Biobrian81> @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump Haha it even states it excludes news and is only "original programming"  CNN isn't a bunch of opinion shows like Fox news CNN reports actual news and facts.
971226643271331840 2018-03-06 03:30:50 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Funny you acknowledge that but can't accept your the lowest rated president in history and that the majority hate you and your childish antics.
971226439822569472 2018-03-06 03:30:02 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @shadetreesigns @rhiannonz28 @entrepefooder By genius you mean inheriting your fortune,  and scamming  your workers
964814015238057985 2018-02-17 10:49:21 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Buy you said it was #fakenews!!! What an imbecile. #NotFakeNews #corupttrump #Mueller2018 #clubfed
964331801400426498 2018-02-15 02:53:12 UTC <Biobrian81> @cmclymer While I can agree guns are the problem,  the fact that you're a grown man playing  dress up invalidates your opinions. Look between your legs and come back to reality
960912189052788737 2018-02-06 16:24:53 UTC <Biobrian81> @Colts @realDonaldTrump Yep cause of the 35,000 accidents a year that 1 undocumented person really breaks the camels back
960911422958968832 2018-02-06 16:21:50 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump With the exception that chain migration as you call doesn't exist.  Only DIRECT family members parents,  siblings and children and their are limits to that such as age and martial status. And all of this is clearly states on the @USCIS web page seriously why lie so much
960783209603645440 2018-02-05 07:52:22 UTC <Biobrian81> @StephenKing You see how quick @realDonaldTrump and @WhiteHouse were to try to distance themselves  saying it had nothing to do with them.  Sorry but you can't take credit for the good and then blame other for the bad. #Mueller2018
960782573868691457 2018-02-05 07:49:50 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump WAY UP??  You mean YOUR paycheck went way up.  The average middle or lower class America  has only seen an average of $1.50/week that why your lacky @SpeakerRyan had to quickly delete his tweet that basically detritus the GOP argument.  #factsdontlie #butthegopdoes
959825432588697601 2018-02-03 16:26:30 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump He's so excited that less than half the country approves of his job
959824427000119298 2018-02-03 16:22:30 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @JTMann05 I'm it sure you know how to read,  comprehend what you read or understand how the FISA court works
959390570413092865 2018-02-02 11:38:31 UTC <Biobrian81> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump .. The "biggest ever". Seriously over compensating only a daily basis is just sad. Maybe that's why Melanie looks dead inside you always make her tell you "it's the bigger ever"   #loser #tinyhands #liar #Mueller2018
959389736149295111 2018-02-02 11:35:12 UTC <Biobrian81> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Of course Fox news beat every one else,  their viewers are the only one that want to hear the ignorance that spews from your mouth. And can anything other lies come from your mouth,  seriously you must have the smallest "hands" ever given that everything with you has to be..
959388772105306112 2018-02-02 11:31:22 UTC <Biobrian81> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @SHAUNALUVSDDNT @Seraphna @mikecx @joejohnson043 I know right Damn those facts,  do you offer any other proof other than factual data 
959387160863387648 2018-02-02 11:24:58 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump To bad youre not gonna get em. HAHAHA clink-clack what's that the sound of ankle shackles???? Mueller must be ready to take you to your new condo at club Fed #goingdown #Mueller2018 #ImpeachTrump
959386464403447808 2018-02-02 11:22:12 UTC <Biobrian81> @JaredHume @ajaromano Where the stories took place?  The movies had whites,  blacks,  Asians,  Indians everything. 1920 new york was primarily white people. So again it's all realistic representations of the eras and the areas. Stop wanting every gay just to make yourself feel better.
959385971501367297 2018-02-02 11:20:14 UTC <Biobrian81> @JaredHume @ajaromano They could include a million dancing squirrels and no gay people and it would still be OK cause it's FANTASY it's not real. And you also talk about not including people of color.  Seriously have you read the books or seen the movies or been to been to the areas of Britain
959385390313439232 2018-02-02 11:17:56 UTC <Biobrian81> @JaredHume @ajaromano It would still be an accurate representation of the real world. What's worse is that you're complaining that a FICTIONAL world doesn't have more gay people. Seriously it's fantasy just like guys that think they're girls and girls that think they're guys it's all MAKE BELIEVE
959384978797740032 2018-02-02 11:16:18 UTC <Biobrian81> @JaredHume @ajaromano angry much?? Seriously contrary to what you think no one actually cares you're gay. What annoys us is that you want everything to be gay because you're gay.  Less than 5% of the world's population is gay,  therefore if only 5% of all movies/media portray the gay community
957654785104142336 2018-01-28 16:41:07 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Funniest part is that the data that shows racial employments is the 2016 census which reflects the great job Obama did not trump. #stillridingthecoattails #MuellerTime #gonnabeanearlychristmas
957654101159952384 2018-01-28 16:38:24 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump This has been the trend for the last  8 years it has nothing to do with anything youve done. #delusional #creditforobama
956591240417443840 2018-01-25 18:14:58 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Amazing you listed companies that make over 40 billion a year in profit that haven't struggled in decades
955636049966854144 2018-01-22 02:59:23 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Amazing last time there was a shutdown you said it wasnt the Republicans or Democrats fault it was the presidents fault for lack of leadership.  Among how quick that goes out the door when it applies to your clueless ass. #idiot #RepublicanShutDown #NotMyPresident
955074902062542848 2018-01-21 13:49:35 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr you know the Dems are demanding DACA cause we k or you'll drag your feet negotiating to "accidentally" go past the deadline and cause mass deportations. #commonsense #cantfoolus
955074237655523328 2018-01-21 13:46:57 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP the government shutdown isn't going to affect the Mueller investigation and if you actually cared like you claim you'd meet the Dems half way and add a DACA extension until legislation can be agreed upon to get the funding passed
955072990684766208 2018-01-21 13:42:00 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Well he has one thing right it's gonna be a big 2018 with a big ole Mueller fuelled impeachment.
954631891868573696 2018-01-20 08:29:13 UTC <Biobrian81> @SpeakerRyan Funny choice of words since trump himself has said he'd shoot down anything that doesn't include his wall
954179616427536385 2018-01-18 02:32:03 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Funny he thinks any deal that makes someone other than himself money is a bad deal.  And there is literally no way to make Mexico pay for a stupid wall,  he says higher tax tariffs on imports from Mexico,  guess what that means Americans are still paying for it with higher prices
954178925592104961 2018-01-18 02:29:18 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Over 6000 layoffs in the Pittsburgh steel industry equals America is back??
954178623300251649 2018-01-18 02:28:06 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Really???  Cause Mexico isn't even included in most lists of the 20 most dangerous countries. Ukraine,  a Nordic country comprised of mostly white people is even listed as more dangerous than Mexico. It's sad as president you can't and refuse to use actual facts.
953443133995364352 2018-01-16 01:45:31 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @ManoMarks @MrSteveRangel That's what the report is based off of though.  Watch the congressional testimony by DHS on it
953442799440994304 2018-01-16 01:44:12 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @Dawnm90 No,  this report is solely based off of international incidents nothing domestic
953442650425737216 2018-01-16 01:43:36 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @PalmerReport Exactly. Read or watch the confessional hearing on the report.  They get hammered with that fact and have to admit the report is based off of INTERNATIONAL arrests and events not domestic.
953442267179581440 2018-01-16 01:42:05 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @Unpersuaded112 @DevinCates Mueller was appointed in May 2017,  for those of us who know how to count that's only 8 months not 2 years.  And there has been how many indictments and guilty pleas??
953441191453798400 2018-01-16 01:37:48 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Stop cherry picking facts from these reports to cause controversy.  The report also states as was testified at Congress by DHS that those numbers represent INTERNATIONAL charges that occurred outside the US, and that US incidents are still primarily by US CITIZENS
953300201871048704 2018-01-16 16:17:34 UTC <Biobrian81> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @IWillRedPillYou Seriously you need to educate yourself 1) The US couldn't stop the sale of a Canadian company to Russia. 2) ALL US Mined Uranium is sold back to the US.  NONE LEAVES THE COUNTRY 3) 86% of Americas Uranium comes from outside of the country.
953299303535075328 2018-01-16 16:14:00 UTC <Biobrian81> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @TrumpFranceInfo He's not a self made billionaire,  he inherited his fortune and his company.  ALL new ventures he attempted failed miserably
953085332467011584 2018-01-15 02:03:45 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Our military isn't in desperate need of money we spend more than the next 5countries behind us.  Serious stop using the military for trying to compensate for your tiny "hands"
949874718017970176 2018-01-06 05:25:55 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Successful businessman??  EVERY business you started on your own has FAILED  the only one that hasn't you didn't start,  you inherited.
949874313288499200 2018-01-06 05:24:18 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Didn't realize multiple indictments and your former senior advisor and members flipping on you and singing like canaries was what a hoax is. Guess that definition is located in the same dictionary that you use that defines imperial facts as fake news.
949610419496218624 2018-01-06 11:55:41 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Really cause the fastest 1000 point jump was in May of 1999 under Clinton and only took 24 days. #factchecking
948408817473105921 2018-01-02 04:20:57 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Amazing,  that's EXACTLY what the times does,  yet you complain daily about any news that doesn't kiss you ass. #protectthefirst #1stAmendment
948407468123541504 2018-01-02 04:15:35 UTC <Biobrian81> Sad when you constantly take credit for things that you've absolutely no impact on.  Seriously surprised he hasn't taken credit for the surrender of nazi Germany or masterminding the lunar project.  Constant need for self validation in a president is sad. #daddyissues #needahughttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948195478428102657
948404544085442560 2018-01-02 04:03:58 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Really??  You're ego is bigger than Jupiter.  Why on earth would people you degrade Daily and want to kick out fall in love with you??  Serious need to take yourself off the pedestal
946994606725505024 2017-12-29 06:41:23 UTC <Biobrian81> @POTUS @charliekirk11 @FoxBusiness You're fucking kidding me right?  ISIS DOWNFALL-Obama legacy  Manufacturing??  Guess the thousands of current steel worker layoffs and outsourcing that will come from the foreign tax repeal. Or maybe legitimizing white supremacy is his great accomplishment. Republican fools
946992887216013313 2017-12-29 06:34:33 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Then Amazon would just use UPS,  FEDEX, DHS or any other service that would gladly pick up a huge contract like that. No wonder every business you started has failed. #idiot #economics101 #businessfacts
946991961788911616 2017-12-29 06:30:52 UTC <Biobrian81> @charliekirk11 Still waiting for the list of wins................ Still waiting............oh you meant wins for corporate billionaires.
946991646738071553 2017-12-29 06:29:37 UTC <Biobrian81> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump 2 words: cherry picking
946991364738187265 2017-12-29 06:28:30 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump You want to "protect our country"??? When are you planning on taking away guns from crazy white people and making it harder in general?? Amazing you love statistics and records (unless they disprove your lies) but ignore that only 2% of crime and murder are by noncitizens. #facts
943834263308214273 2017-12-21 13:23:18 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Yep you're so worried about the average American, that's why you hired 70 non-immigrant workers to staff Mar-a-Lago during the peak season???  #Ohnopinocchio #facts #wedontbuyit #teammueller
943137807605760000 2017-12-19 15:15:50 UTC <Biobrian81> @starwars @lucas_flanagan As someone whose lived through all but the original episode IV it was a great movie, and to all the @rianjohnson haters when you become blockbuster Hollywood director/producers maybe your opinion will matter and you obviously aren't grasping the direction of this final trilogy.
940953165813469185 2017-12-13 14:34:51 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Amazing how quick Trump jumps ship and throws people under the bus when it does boost his ego
940952789659697153 2017-12-13 14:33:21 UTC <Biobrian81> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Seriously 3 stories is numerous and 90%???? What about the 3000+ false official statements you have made,  does that make you a fake a president??
940426327596732417 2017-12-11 03:41:23 UTC <Biobrian81> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump For clarification it's 8-12 hours watching TV the rest day is spent eating McDonald's,  playing golf and tweeting. So when does he actually have time for doing his job as president??
939881025869508608 2017-12-10 15:34:33 UTC <Biobrian81> @washingtonpost @daveweigel @realDonaldTrump We DEMAND YOU RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION ESPECIALLY THE 1ST AMENDMENT!!!!  To be clear  you're not a private citizen anymore your the "highest ranking" government official you can't talk shit about the media. I suggest you read the constitution for dummies while eating a big mac
939878659485077504 2017-12-10 15:25:09 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @williamOsborn_ The stock market and unemployment rates are continuing their paths created by Obama. ZERO legislation has been passed during thus administration that would provide a direct affect to boost the economy.  The only way to MAGA is to properly inform and educate the trump followers.
939877427811008515 2017-12-10 15:20:15 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump And it has nothing to do with you do it was doing that everyday before you were elected thanks to the Obama policies you're still riding.  Only a Fake President needs his ego inflated daily.
939287403017134080 2017-12-08 00:15:42 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Yea you promised to run the country like your businesses and you have,  youve made America a complete failure,  just like your businesses.
938039664212025344 2017-12-05 13:37:38 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd @blakebeye You can't be serious,  Trump ADMITTED on national TV during an interview he fired Comey over Russia,  he just admitted fired Flynn over lying to FBI. THAT'S OBSTRUCTION ASK NIXON!!
938030124649275398 2017-12-05 12:59:44 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd Funniest part of that statement is none of it is true, he's the commander in chief of the armed forces. The Supreme Court would be the chief law enforcement, cause the separation of powers put him in charge of the executive branch not the judicial.
938029445339680769 2017-12-05 12:57:02 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd @blakebeye And F. Y.I he's not the top law enforcement that would be the Supreme Court.  The president sits atop the executive branch not the judicial, try taking a 5th grade civics class.
938028979931328512 2017-12-05 12:55:11 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd @blakebeye Not if the only reason of firing is to stop a federal investigation.
938028708761190400 2017-12-05 12:54:06 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd @Jewuh So what do you complain about whens it's a black cop that kills a black CRIMINAL??  Only see BLM and black community cry out when it's a white cop.
938028191121158146 2017-12-05 12:52:03 UTC <Biobrian81> @BrianZahnd Translation: The president doesn't believe in the separation of powers set forth in the constitution and thinks he's actually King Trump.
938027763277053952 2017-12-05 12:50:21 UTC <Biobrian81> @starwars @Disney @darklordoftheIT @rianjohnson Just say no to deleted scenes,  give us the first  Star Wars Extended Cut 
938026070158188545 2017-12-05 12:43:37 UTC <Biobrian81> @StephenKing Of course not, the number one rule of GOP membership "Do as I say, not as I do"
937294037802926082 2017-12-03 12:14:47 UTC <Biobrian81> @prestonbradford @MZHemingway When you have to lie about it it's not diplomatic groundwork,  and when you have no official position it's a federal crime. When you try to cover it up as president you're in for impeachment
936488855884009472 2017-11-30 06:55:17 UTC <Biobrian81> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I find it fucking hilarious he talks all this bullshit about Muslims to get the ignorant class of Americans riled up,  but throws it all out the window when he's around one who has more money than he does and thinks he can get something out of it #ignorant #hypocrite
936279831955644416 2017-11-30 17:04:41 UTC <Biobrian81> @foxandfriends @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Seriously??  You can't even follow simple presidential guidelines,  and promote anti semitism,  bigotry,  hatred,  racial conflicts,  and generally just seem to wipe your ass with the Bill of Rights. So that's kinda like the pot calling the kettle black.#clueless#idiot#impeach45

936198614862327808 2017-11-30 11:41:58 UTC <Biobrian81> @theresa_may @JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump Amazing more murders ate made each year by white christians in the US,  but guess it's OK cause they're white. I'm a white Catholic American living in the largest Muslim majority country in the world and feel safer walking done the street here that I have in the US in 10 years.
936097929411960832 2017-11-29 05:01:52 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump WRONG!!  Stop twisting numbers to try make yourself look better. The debt difference between taking office and leaving office was roughly 9 trillion.  The debt added by Obama policies was about 895billion you're policies add 1.3 trillion your 1st year alone so please shut up.
936054153989668864 2017-11-29 02:07:56 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @SoNasty2017 @nicochuey Your* Straight* And your right .99% (that's less than less than 1%) of real Americans voted for and approve of trump.  Seriously get hooked on phonics because all you just did is show how the uneducated are his biggest supporters. I also suggest a government and economics class
936052252158017536 2017-11-29 02:00:22 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump You haven't passed any policies that would affect the economy,  you can't fool the educated stop patting yourself on the back daily. Seriously why the such high need for self gratification and acknowledgement,  get therapist to deal with tour daddy issues so we don't have to
935695170820960257 2017-11-28 02:21:27 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking serious our military is 230% larger than theirs we spend more on military than the next 10 counties combined,  as vet can tell you it's a waste of God Damn money especially when the "Dems"  are the only ones who give the enlisted pay raises
935332384072908800 2017-11-27 02:19:52 UTC <Biobrian81> @TIME @JoeNBC @DanScavino @tabascogarden @karinfrance1 Lied about time Magazine calling him about person of the year and was called out on it by @Time. His inauguration crowd size.  Saying he'll be to busy to play golf,  has now played more golf than any other president in first term.

Most of the world other than putin thinks trumps a joke,  do they love he's president,  yes,  because it gives them a chance to exploit an idiot and surpass the US in every way.

935029764837883904 2017-11-26 06:17:22 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen His idiot cronies don't understand he hasn't passed any laws that would affect the economy and even if had they wouldn't go I affect until 2018 #blindfollowers

935028344080367616 2017-11-26 06:11:43 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump what a conceded idiot.  Things trump has done more than any 10mth president: -played more rounds of golf -3500+ blatant lies and falsehoods  -spent a years secret service budget in 6mths  -takes credit for Obamas economic work daily  -ignores constitution daily

933720599179882496 2017-11-23 15:35:13 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump @martita31 @Calikrystal86 Trump hasn't donated anything to the VA his first check went to the US Park service and his most recent went to the department of education.  Seriously checks your facts before spewing idiotic nonsense,  and as a vet can tell you everything happening is still from Obama
933719606656503808 2017-11-23 15:31:16 UTC <Biobrian81> @realDonaldTrump You're right so much is going great in America,  thanks Obama. Unfortunately Mr trump you're not one of those things that's going great, and since you've enacted 0, NONE,  NADA legislation that has affected our economy please stop taking credit for Obamas work it's embarrassing
