971155337016360961 2018-03-06 22:47:30 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer They both share the corporatist perspective.  Soft and hard authoritarian interests that benefit the ruling elite$.
970058081064202240 2018-03-03 22:07:23 UTC <Sunergos2001> @JimCarrey I loved the first couple of renditions. Less is more.
968295548238249984 2018-02-26 01:23:43 UTC <Sunergos2001> "War no more. No more war!"
968292945056051200 2018-02-26 01:13:22 UTC <Sunergos2001> Guns kill. The purpose of guns is to kill: animals, people or those feared. The secondary purpose, target practice, is to improve ones ability to aim at a target and improve the chance and gratification of the score. Guns kill.
967592568639770625 2018-02-24 02:50:20 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer or BIG Marco
967591969982529537 2018-02-24 02:47:57 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer Sorry, real life is not an Audie Murphy movie. If you want to die or the adrenaline is pumping, then charge the shooter with an automatic weapon! GUNS KILL.

966884639867486210 2018-02-22 03:57:16 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer Guns kill.
966478753005158400 2018-02-21 01:04:25 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer SOME would say that their job is to represent their donors and to keep getting re-elected. Is it time for ONE man ONE vote yet?
964977558801428480 2018-02-17 21:39:13 UTC <Sunergos2001> @CBSThisMorning Another deflect and distract to redirect the blame away from the real source of the problem.
964663187915227136 2018-02-16 00:50:01 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer Theyre not in the same affinity group. We all cherry pick and retain that which most reflects our own understanding and perspectives. Explains how Ben Carson can be an MD and yet so dull.
964349543524388864 2018-02-15 04:03:42 UTC <Sunergos2001> @Thom_Hartmann Cyclically when the ultra-right ascends to power, it portends the death of the old order and the birth of a new one. White men have had their season under the sun. Turn turn turn. Time for someone else. Go with the flow!
964347687079325697 2018-02-15 03:56:19 UTC <Sunergos2001> @Thom_Hartmann United we stand, divided we FALL! Welcome to sunset in America! DT's role is to deconstruct the administrative order. I see it as the recapitulation of the Fall of the former USSR.
964163586061774848 2018-02-15 15:44:46 UTC <Sunergos2001> @JimDever Sad!
963899078181502979 2018-02-14 22:13:43 UTC <Sunergos2001> @JohnWDean Define "success." He has been very successful in avoiding the worst consequences from impulsive behavior. Still time to pay Karma.
963119161701408768 2018-02-12 18:34:36 UTC <Sunergos2001> @ezraklein Great! the cons crash and burn and now the antithesis must build and reconstruct! Will they even be able to refill the hole the cons have dug? Doesn't look good!
963118181253505024 2018-02-12 18:30:42 UTC <Sunergos2001> @JesseLaGreca @krassenstein There are a certain percentage of female patriarchal authoritarian enablers who socialize their young male children to be just like the macho men who beat them up! These women sincerely believe their men and young male children are superior to them. It is that simple.
962016306953273345 2018-02-09 17:32:15 UTC <Sunergos2001> @Thom_Hartmann @ringoffireradio What about the alpha male authoritarian meme model don't you understand? If one is the OTHER then one is less human and definitely not part of THEIR team bc their authority SAYS so!
961594350495911936 2018-02-08 13:35:33 UTC <Sunergos2001> SOME things are unconditional, universal, constant. Does the the South Pole of a magnet choose to be attracted to the North Pole of another?
961230112740884480 2018-02-07 13:28:12 UTC <Sunergos2001> Dualism (either/or thinking) has never quite worked for everyone especially for those who could not manage to be the OR imposed upon them.
961224695394721792 2018-02-07 13:06:40 UTC <Sunergos2001> Can an apple be an orange or orange be an apple? Yet without choice neither can achieve its potential. Forcing one to be another has never worked.
960692277122277376 2018-02-05 01:51:02 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer @attn Bravo, Nick!

958499202161455104 2018-01-30 00:36:32 UTC <Sunergos2001> @JohnWDean DJT's role is that of the polarizer, the destroyer, and the divider, He is replicating the FaLL of the Empire. Expect greater chaos soon. Many in the world will not weep for the loss of power!

941513173839908866 2017-12-14 03:40:07 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer If cons crash the economy for the third time with their trickle down, free market fantasy, don't expect a rescue from tax payers this time. The bubble is gonna burst. God, help us all!
940712813567152128 2017-12-12 22:39:47 UTC <Sunergos2001> @NickHanauer Ponzi Scheme Rule: When everyone is GETTING in, the pyramid is peeking. Get out before the crash. Better yet stay out.
