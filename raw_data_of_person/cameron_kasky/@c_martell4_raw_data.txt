953326368485408774 2018-01-16 18:01:32 UTC <c_martell4> @Lin_Manuel Happy birthday! Not to ruin your day but I just had a terrible experience trying to buy handicap accessible seats for Hamilton, really upset me. Called several times, no help. Might not be able to go as a result. Anyway we can fix this system for the future?
