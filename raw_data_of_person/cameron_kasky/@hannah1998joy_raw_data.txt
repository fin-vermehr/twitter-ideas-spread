766823439097143296 2016-08-19 02:25:29 UTC <hannah1998joy> Constantly torn between choosing your own path and letting fate decide
766807844691648513 2016-08-19 01:23:31 UTC <hannah1998joy> I always wonder about soulmates and true love.. Is it real? Do we find more than one real love in our lives or do we only get one chance?
766413003038220288 2016-08-18 23:14:33 UTC <hannah1998joy> 8 days until my road trip through North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington to move in to PLU

765191847069126656 2016-08-15 14:22:07 UTC <hannah1998joy> I'll always cherish our memories
765191503266222080 2016-08-15 14:20:45 UTC <hannah1998joy> We've both changed and made decisions that got us here. We're going down different paths, and its time to accept that even if it hurts
765191104421502976 2016-08-15 14:19:10 UTC <hannah1998joy> I'll miss you so much but we need to focus on ourselves individually for awhile
