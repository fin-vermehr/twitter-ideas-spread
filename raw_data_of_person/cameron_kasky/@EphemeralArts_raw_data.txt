972214253280051200 2018-03-09 20:55:15 UTC <EphemeralArts> Product photography thought for the day: You can't have too many light sources. I repeat - YOU CANNOT HAVE TOO MANY LIGHT SOURCES. You don't need to use them all at once, but GOD could I be saving myself time by not having to adjust brightness & contrast for 90% of EVERYTHING.

971573191041736704 2018-03-07 02:27:54 UTC <EphemeralArts> More observations about product photography: -Digital cameras EAT BATTERIES. Get rechargables, MINIMUM 2 sets. -I'm getting faster at doing rotational views and altering light sources.  -Taking pictures of spread out blankets to get patterns SUCKS BALLS. I do not like ladders.

Srs tho - I think I'm going to get another consult and let doc know I'd had extra anxiety meds that day - that slows down your breathing - didn't think @ it when I met with her. Also quit using Lyrica & starting to feel better rested already. So there's that.

970123144404000768 2018-03-03 02:25:56 UTC <EphemeralArts> It used to take bunches of equipment - dark room, baths, negatives, contact sheets, jeweler's loupe, etc. - to do much of what can be done with a basic digital camera and a simple(ish) piece of software.

970097449715953664 2018-03-03 00:43:50 UTC <EphemeralArts> As someone who doesn't like making small talk with weird and/or superstitious people, retail in a store that carries 'lucky' items is very often not my forte. It's at least a step up from being a bartender. I would be a very stabby person if I were a bartender.

I personally applaud people with access to a large audience who stand up and speak their mind. If you look up Bill Hicks and George Carlin you'll see comedians who can be funny and still be a strong force for change.
967206095360991232 2018-02-23 01:14:37 UTC <EphemeralArts> That's going to leave a mark. It's so fascinating to watch a politician literally set fire to their own career.https://twitter.com/sarahchad_/status/966924331086266369

967201577474797569 2018-02-23 00:56:40 UTC <EphemeralArts> @yakkopinky @tarastrong @givdesigns @EZEtheman3000 This sounds an awful lot like the way each of these incidents has been dealt - or rather not dealt with - in the past you don't want to dwell on. The past is EXACTLY what we should focus on bc denying the problem by refusing to acknowledge it is why it keeps coming back.
967200102799482881 2018-02-23 00:50:48 UTC <EphemeralArts> Anytime some fuckhead like trump bellows about "background checks" someone should be reminded about making it possible to actually "background check" the provenance of every *gun*, not just it's owner.https://twitter.com/pacelattin/status/967128007595864065

Like so many of the things he tried to accomplish, he was deadlocked out by complete refusal by the GOP. God help us I hope this time these bastards lose.

966562806416908288 2018-02-21 06:38:25 UTC <EphemeralArts> I know I'd trust my brand of 'crazy' in someone else over the 'sanity' that continues to enable a system that now makes mass shootings a biweekly occurrence in our country. Who do YOU trust? /end
966562111546564609 2018-02-21 06:35:39 UTC <EphemeralArts> I'm just one 'crazy person.' I know that there is nothing that would ever convince me to go out and get a weapon and gun down innocent people. I'm not that kind of 'crazy.' 12/
966561589762535424 2018-02-21 06:33:35 UTC <EphemeralArts> 'Crazy people' aren't the NRA lobbyists lining the pockets of politicians. 'Crazy people' aren't the ones standing in the way of the kind of gun control THE ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD has decided is reasonable. 11/
966561067357782016 2018-02-21 06:31:30 UTC <EphemeralArts> It's not the fault of 'crazy people' people that legal, lethal weapons are easily and readily available. That falls on the heads of those who continue, time after time after time, to refuse to put limits on what is *truly* insane behavior. 10/
966560125992366080 2018-02-21 06:27:46 UTC <EphemeralArts> NO ONE has the right to tar everyone with the same brush. Running a fine-tooth comb over the mental and criminal history of every mass shooter has STILL allowed them to get through the cracks and STILL allowed them to LEGALLY PURCHASE LETHAL WEAPONS. 9/
966559534058582016 2018-02-21 06:25:25 UTC <EphemeralArts> Automatic weapons used to fight WARS are made available to CIVILIANS who have ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS HAVING THEM. Even the 'crazy people' who aren't shooting up schools and concerts and every other damn place you can think of know that. 8/
966558993731563521 2018-02-21 06:23:16 UTC <EphemeralArts> But right now, the 'crazy people' who are getting their hands on weapons are resorting, over and over and over AND OVER to the kind of guns that can kill a lot of people, really fast, with little to no effort. 7/
966558417241255941 2018-02-21 06:20:59 UTC <EphemeralArts> But that is not OUR country. That is NOT the United States. We are NOT in the throes of our own Civil War, even though we are coming perilously closer as each day passes. 6/
966558023035441152 2018-02-21 06:19:25 UTC <EphemeralArts> There are countries that are truly at war within their own boundaries right now. There are people for whom weapons are a very literal need, at this point in time, to defend themselves and their families. I'm a flower-picking hippie and even I recognize that. 5/
966557550245134336 2018-02-21 06:17:32 UTC <EphemeralArts> Are we a country currently involved in an armed war on our own soil? That's what the 2nd Amendment was designed for - to give people the necessary power to defend themselves from hostile takeover from an invading force. 4/
966557154223075328 2018-02-21 06:15:57 UTC <EphemeralArts> How does further stigmatizing an already marginalized community justify handing out guns capable of firing round after round after round within SECONDS? 3/

966555848796286977 2018-02-21 06:10:46 UTC <EphemeralArts> After watching the Town Hall tonight I am- not beyond words - I am LIVID that the NRA spokesperson had the AUDACITY to throw around, REPEATEDLY, the terms 'crazy person' & 'crazy people' as a shield behind which to hide behind the issue of gun control. *I* am a 'crazy person'. 1/

966297797778485248 2018-02-21 13:05:22 UTC <EphemeralArts> To be fair, some of the people horribly confused about the #TwitterLockOut probably honestly didn't realize a slew of their followers were bots.

966290529200652288 2018-02-21 12:36:29 UTC <EphemeralArts> Thus far all the howling and gnashing of teeth I'm seeing re: #TwitterLockOut is coming from the waaaaay-alt-right and 99% christ-free christians.

961858947492675584 2018-02-08 07:06:58 UTC <EphemeralArts> Got a low INR the last two visits at the Coumadin Clinic and I'm being fussed over so much that I feel like they think I'm about to explode into a meteoric shower of blood clots, leaving behind a wet meat suit and a disgruntled skeleton.

959257474736930816 2018-02-01 02:49:38 UTC <EphemeralArts> @drmistercody Yeah, I saw that episode of Phillip K. Dick's Electric Dreams ("Kill All Others"). It - did not end well...

959251532163108864 2018-02-01 02:26:01 UTC <EphemeralArts> @RealSamUzi - Saw all but one of the PK Dick Electric Dreams (couldn't find Safe & Sound ANYWHERE, and all the reviews say it's one of the best so waaaah). Great show and OH MY GOD THE OPENING CREDITS. I want to take an heroic dose of mushrooms and just trip out on the credits...

958959694587965441 2018-01-31 07:06:22 UTC <EphemeralArts> I still don't fully understand how 3D printer's work, but damn - this looks amazing.https://twitter.com/QueerEngineer/status/958539601232056321
958959202747101187 2018-01-31 07:04:25 UTC <EphemeralArts> @SocialRepose Never played, but I love the soundtrack.
958958683269955585 2018-01-31 07:02:21 UTC <EphemeralArts> @T_R_DeMuerte I like him, but yeah - we have a lot more choices, and it's time to stop the wading around in the bleached, testosterone-infested end of the political pool.
958958163738312705 2018-01-31 07:00:17 UTC <EphemeralArts> @mediapathic 5:29am Hard Texas No on that one.
958957680978141184 2018-01-31 06:58:22 UTC <EphemeralArts> @T_R_DeMuerte I can't even wrap my brain around this. "Hey, let's not only violate a teenagers woman's court-ordered civil rights, let's also try to force her to give birth to what might be a monster baby because Jesus."  What. The Actual. Blistering. Fuck.
958954704247054336 2018-01-31 06:46:32 UTC <EphemeralArts> @badjokeworseman Not to be confused with hyperbole.
958953803864141824 2018-01-31 06:42:57 UTC <EphemeralArts> @Mark_Z_NJ I've...never heard of those. I don't get out much.
958885304726798337 2018-01-31 02:10:46 UTC <EphemeralArts> @RealSamUzi Is there a map of what cities it's supposed to go through?
958883828814106624 2018-01-31 02:04:54 UTC <EphemeralArts> @Mark_Z_NJ I haven't watched in a few years. It's that topical on every episode? If so it sounds like it's cuing from The Simpsons.
958881689865867264 2018-01-31 01:56:24 UTC <EphemeralArts> @Mark_Z_NJ ...Big Bang Theory...?
958876278186065920 2018-01-31 01:34:54 UTC <EphemeralArts> @Mark_Z_NJ We have shit for media in this country. We're pretty much an embarrassment in every respect in this country.
958875562423943168 2018-01-31 01:32:03 UTC <EphemeralArts> @badjokeworseman At least you didn't ask for kleenex.
958784629653172224 2018-01-31 19:30:43 UTC <EphemeralArts> I like him, but I have to agree with this. The bucket of lard in the White House is there because people wanted change but weren't educated enough, or were too fucking selfish to care about anyone but themselves. Now we know better, and it's time to mobilize. MAKE CHANGE HAPPENhttps://twitter.com/Literature_Lady/status/958684623877394432
