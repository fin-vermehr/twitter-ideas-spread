936368085883170816 2017-11-30 22:55:23 UTC <louley> How often are we manipulated into prioritizing the abuser over the abused? How often are we being suckered into a side of a debate that we shouldnt even be having? ... before the names of the women theyve harmed are even known?https://theestablishment.co/due-process-is-needed-for-sexual-harassment-accusations-but-for-whom-968e7c81e6d6

933507964782067712 2017-11-22 01:30:17 UTC <louley> @FiveThirtyEight  ITT: defensive reactions to being food shamed for the fatties that we ALL are. Or is it insecurity over your shortened life spans?
933293812272611328 2017-11-22 11:19:19 UTC <louley> @AsheSchow @tweedylouwho Another!  Dude in my carpool. He literally took it out of his pants as I was driving down the 405.
933291706228678656 2017-11-22 11:10:57 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Also, maybe you should focus more energy raising your grumpy teen so they are less likely to make false accusations. (And, again remember- NO ONE SAID DO THIS OR ELSE. Your kids are still allowed to hug the g'prnts. NO ONE IS TAKING THAT AWAY FROM YOU.
933289233648721922 2017-11-22 11:01:07 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf And if Puritan means rejecting forced kisses on people I don't  feel comfortable with or have been abused by, then this liberal bitch is definitely a Puritan.
933288645691260930 2017-11-22 10:58:47 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Lol, are you fucking kidding me? HOW will it affect you when us "Puritans" "get our way"?
933286651186503681 2017-11-22 10:50:51 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Genuinely curious: how do you think this would affect you, if it does become a cultural norm? Because, from what I see, it will literally have zero impact on your life (and privilege).
933285681819926528 2017-11-22 10:47:00 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf And to quote you directly, please don't apply experience on me. You not having a problem with hugging and kissing relatives, has nothing to do with the fact that others do not. So, again I ask you ... what is your point?

933282567779790848 2017-11-22 10:34:38 UTC <louley> @AsheSchow @tweedylouwho I've got more ... a dude I was in youth leadership in church with, my male cousin ... You just don't know of anyone who has come forward yet. But I promise you: someone you know has had this, or something similar happened to them.

933281088255934465 2017-11-22 10:28:45 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf And the REAL shitter is that women in America are having this conversation in order to protect YOU from the abuse that we have suffered.  And all you can do is plug your ears, sling insults, and actively advocate for the removal of woman's rights?! Damn girl. That's some shit.
933278891220787201 2017-11-22 10:20:01 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf OR, is it the slow realization that you may be complicit in the perpetuation of rape culture. It's never too late to learn from observation.
933278108957884416 2017-11-22 10:16:55 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf No one questioned your formal education. I am questioning your anger. Trying to find out why you are so upset that notion that some children are accidentally encouraged by family to be physical w/ someone who might be an abuser. No one is saying that you might do the same.
933277155848421377 2017-11-22 10:13:08 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Huh? Re-English that, and maybe I'll be able to find the point. Are you angry that you have no frame of reference, at the thought that your experience is not universal and does not apply to society at large? Or just angry that I suggested you may have something to learn,still.
933178754796421122 2017-11-21 03:42:07 UTC <louley> Maybe I'll start it. #indoctrinatedsisters  Not gonna lie. I kinda wanted it to just be hashtag shitty bitches, but she's still a sister in the fight (and clearly has issues with women, also). I'm taking shit from her FOR her. She's just too brainwashed to see it.
933177298957737984 2017-11-21 03:36:20 UTC <louley> Is there a hashtag yet to call out shitty women who are complicit in the cultural abuse of women? #realquestion #supportyoursisters
933176857935060992 2017-11-21 03:34:35 UTC <louley>  The 'ole "well, it never happened to me, so shut up" defense. Ladies- quit dragging your sisters down. ESPECIALLY those who who have learned to stand up for themselves after a lifetime of this nonsense. Way to perpetuate a viscous cycle.pic.twitter.com/4V4ttrep2f
933175840719880192 2017-11-21 03:30:32 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Lol, are you serious? How is that putting it on you any more than relating your life experience? Take this as an opportunity  to educate yourself by listening to someone's experience.  FORCING physical contact is at best irresponsible, and at worst psychologically damaging.
933168586125746177 2017-11-21 03:01:43 UTC <louley> 4- *something* is a new magical word. "Had I know I would've done *something*. I could've done *something* to let my disinterest be known." Something like, what? Minding my own business? Ignoring harassment and getting the job done anyway? That's what we already do. Every day.
933167914412228608 2017-11-21 02:59:02 UTC <louley> 3- It's insulting because it low-key implies that if they hear of any incident in the future, that it's OUR fault. They warned us, so if someone does abuse their power and harasses us, we should have done *somehing** to prevent it. Our lack of diligence allowed this to happen.
933167309534806016 2017-11-21 02:56:38 UTC <louley> 2- Which is SO insulting on so many levels. First of all, fuck you for implying men in tech are incapable of behaving appropriately around women. Every industry has alpha-male harassers, and tech is not exempt from that. And SECONDLY- this is insulting because it ...

933105245181296640 2017-11-21 22:50:01 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf So, really you DO NOT get to speak out on this issue on behalf of abused children. You have no context or frame of reference. Educate yourself, and then come back and re-join the conversation.
933104717336535040 2017-11-21 22:47:55 UTC <louley> @nypost @CHSommers @myblackfriend @EmilyDavisonSuf Listen to yourself, you're completely missing the point. You are SO fortunate to not have reason to need this protection. Being forced to give my uncle who sexually abused me for decades a hug because we're related was a COMPLETE failure on my parents part to protect their child.

932845624344559616 2017-11-20 05:38:22 UTC <louley> 2/2 She can't comment on it until tell her anger is in check. But anger isn't the right word. It's not anger. This isn't feminist fury that these men are facing. It's primal rage. They're lucky we are only using our words. Because, they sure didn't.https://youtu.be/o-rspvv0ylY
