969551218031783939 2018-03-02 12:33:18 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @danofire They used to sell No Name beer. Which was a bottle with yellow label that said "Beer" on it. And at $1 a bottle it was just as good as the more expensive generic kind :)

In Canada, thatd be like the members of car share organizations determining Federal auto policy - 480k (1.4%) of 35m people.   Bizarre.

Makes sense, esp for centers such as ours w/ high bandwidth use (e.g. satellite data). Hard on those who use social media to communicate science though.

950217629767122944 2018-01-07 04:08:31 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> #1. Very different from my normal reads. Enjoyed it mostly, but I think I'd get more in a second read. People seem to either love it or hate it. @goodreads review: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-godspic.twitter.com/tBZa2EY3Eu
950205369757851649 2018-01-07 03:19:48 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Watching the X-Files. Thoroughly confused. When does Spock show up?
950176678675755008 2018-01-07 01:25:48 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> This was, by far, the best movie I saw last year (closely followed by the Churchill biopic, the Darkest Hour, starring the excellent Gary Oldman). Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson also outstanding. @3Billboardshttps://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/950175103047946243

931510713356390401 2017-11-17 13:13:55 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @RosieBarton @CBCPolitics @Lawrencemc I think PS not subject to Fed employment law that govern all other (non-Gov) businesses. Under law, a business has X days to pay employees for work done. But PS exemption means rules don't apply, so no legal req'ment to pay w/in specified timeline.  Sure s/one else will clarify.

923367844426817536 2017-10-25 01:57:04 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @deplorable412 ... but maybe that's a too simplistic ex. Many facets of CC science, some more certain than others. Tough to know thinking w/o more details.
923367522107142149 2017-10-25 01:55:47 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @deplorable412 ... E.g. after considering all evidence re cigarettes & cancer, you believe both sides of argument (that cigs do AND do not cause cancer)...
923367028139761664 2017-10-25 01:53:49 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @deplorable412 Sure... My interpretation was that after carefully considering the facts, you could believe both sides. But that would seem contradictory...
923365623719124992 2017-10-25 01:48:14 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @deplorable412 Anyways, my *original* point had more to do with agreeing to "the science of both sides of the argument". Not sure how that is possible...

923363396048715776 2017-10-25 01:39:23 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @PeterGleick @MelissaJPeltier @deplorable412 Now *that's* an interesting question. I think the assumption that addressing CC automatically means destroying the economy doesn't hold...

923277586423304192 2017-10-25 19:58:24 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @MelissaJPeltier @deplorable412 All explained here.

902618380800229378 2017-08-29 19:46:06 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Today's epic fail: Spent 10 minutes looking for my eye glasses before I realized I was actually wearing them.... Sigh.
902606288378634240 2017-08-29 18:58:03 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Excited to see my contribution to work on surface temp from years ago at @NRCan finally published in @cjfas. See: http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0061#.WaW4nFGQyUkpic.twitter.com/8UNFkCthpQ

898909976072245249 2017-08-19 14:10:13 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Gap @geolinguistics Would prefer to buy elsewhere but TBF @gap quality holds up much better over time. Costs more to replace cheaper brands more frequently.
898909363028537344 2017-08-19 14:07:47 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> And don't get me started on why tights for my daughter are 5x the price here in Canada compared to the US. That's insane!
898907704655269889 2017-08-19 14:01:12 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Lesson in supply & demand: 2 weeks before school & @Gap charging 2x for white school shirts compared to identical shirts in other colours.

898306963850833922 2017-08-17 22:14:04 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Also, know literature & gaps in knowledge / research. Don't propose s'thing that's repetitive (unless your approach or take is innovative).
898305528895463424 2017-08-17 22:08:22 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Often asked to review proposals for funding bodies. Poor quality of some submissions never ceases to amaze. Basic stuff, grammar & spelling.

897423634586902529 2017-08-15 11:44:02 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> So, I hear we'll see 40% of #eclipse in Ottawa. Anyone know the time window for that & whether I need special lenses for SLR? @hpeterwhite

850328305744175104 2017-04-07 12:44:01 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @PublicServiceCa @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 Correct. To our detriment. Bilingualism important. But we need to provide more OPPORTUNITY.
850319179689406464 2017-04-07 12:07:45 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 We need to reframe how we think: promotion criteria of bilingualism > talent doesnt always brings best outcomes.
850318708799152128 2017-04-07 12:05:52 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 ... Had I known. How do you attract best people who know from outset there's a ceiling? You can't. An ongoing battle.
850318173228453889 2017-04-07 12:03:45 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 TBH, I was lucky; but thought of hitting glass ceiling well below my potential would've deterred me from joining PS...
850316527362600960 2017-04-07 11:57:12 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 final note: Look at % b'down of mgmnt cadre that are Francos, Anglos, others (Chinese, etc). Think you'd be shocked.
850314664911175681 2017-04-07 11:49:48 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 So if we are gonna talk the talk re diversity we gotta walk the walk. Many public servants would agree w/ me on this.
850314250128166912 2017-04-07 11:48:09 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 To replace retiring EX from below, need opp'y for promotion. Not doing so = not making best use of existing talent. IMO
850313004394663940 2017-04-07 11:43:12 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 I know many excellent public servants trapped w/ no chance of promotion. It breeds frustration & end up losing talent.
850312354910928896 2017-04-07 11:40:38 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 I was lucky & trained to CCC. But not norm. Many non-Franco's top out at at ex-minus-1. Language training not priority.
850311583582572544 2017-04-07 11:37:34 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @catmarg74 Then you need to do better helping no-francophones learn French. Biggest block to diversity in management cadre IMO.

823503123293544448 2017-01-23 12:10:19 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> As per yesterday's tweet -- this is applicable to climate change, vaccinations, GMOs, etc... Eloquently put.https://twitter.com/PeterGleick/status/823437520893448192
823378215163035648 2017-01-22 03:53:58 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Agridome Agreed. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.
823371327142854656 2017-01-22 03:26:36 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 Then I think it needs to be more clear that science of climate change is not political, but how we address it might be (is?)
823359166186213377 2017-01-22 02:38:17 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 E.g at AAFC, we've done a lot of work contributing to m'ment of C & GHG emissions, but I'd never be asked how to price them.
823357286701744128 2017-01-22 02:30:49 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 I don't think that it is a science issue to be honest; it's more about how science is developed into policy by others...
823355294415732736 2017-01-22 02:22:54 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 But I do think that there should be a mechanism so that those sequestering C should benefit. I assume that's not case in AB?
823354098741297152 2017-01-22 02:18:08 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 ... i.e. C taxes redistributed in way so everyone wins. I'm no economist, so don't know the details of that.
823353584695840768 2017-01-22 02:16:06 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 ... have seen good discussion on C taxes & how can benefit economy if not a "zero sum game"...

823246710197682180 2017-01-22 19:11:25 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 PS. I suspect how you feel when you read about mis-representation of GMOs is how I feel re mis-rep of climate change :)
823246454932307968 2017-01-22 19:10:24 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 Out of interest, how do you think your operations would be affected by 1-2 degree T rise. Guess it depends on precip change?
823242624727392258 2017-01-22 18:55:11 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 Out of interest, have you seen changes in climate over past 30 years when farming in Alberta?
823241884416036865 2017-01-22 18:52:14 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 It's way more complex than that.
823241774072233986 2017-01-22 18:51:48 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @colincameron49 Yes and no. It HAS always been changing. But look at the science & effects humans have had over and above "natural" effects.

823235856358146053 2017-01-22 18:28:17 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> ... How can we develop well-informed evidence-based policy when "evidence" is suspect? Answer: We can't. Please, media outlets, do your job.
823235420335079424 2017-01-22 18:26:33 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> ... as a scientist, I feel it is my responsibility to point out when fact is being mis-represented by media outlets....

764263195817148417 2016-08-12 00:51:59 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> A remake of the Magnificent Seven? A remake of the best movie ever made?   Sacrilege.   Hollywood really has run out of imagination.

763372009309016064 2016-08-10 13:50:44 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @peiscooter Unreasonable. And short-sighted. Esp when you don't have financial means and/or available time in evening to do so.
763371502959984640 2016-08-10 13:48:43 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @peiscooter A Chief last wk told me next gen PS will be responsible for own language training: "Go to nightschool or something".
763371035236376576 2016-08-10 13:46:52 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> @Clerk_GC @peiscooter Yup. Sadly, those who've had training over their ENTIRE PS careers now telling next gen of PS its no longer available.
763341678564356097 2016-08-10 11:50:13 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> I see autocorrect changes "Bonne" to "bonnie".   My very own French-Scots translator.  Ken, likes?
763341364062859264 2016-08-10 11:48:58 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> If you truly want to invest in future of Canada's PS then this needs to be a priority. Cannot state this strongly enough.   Bonne journe.
763339920890925056 2016-08-10 11:43:13 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Canadians from other countries most affected bc they usually only know E or F but not both. Whole segment of populn kept from PS management.

763338031134744576 2016-08-10 11:35:43 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> I'd have left PS long ago if @AAFC_Canada hadnt recognized value in language training as part of my job. Ask around. Issue frustrates many.
763337448944340992 2016-08-10 11:33:24 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> You want PS management to reflect diversity of Canadian population? Glass ceiling for many due to poor opportunities to become bilingual.

699827780289175552 2016-02-16 05:28:39 UTC <AndrewMDavidson> Typically in Ottawa you get one 20-cm snowfall a winter. Youve already had one, but you can get 4 or 5 in a year, or not any.  #Confused
