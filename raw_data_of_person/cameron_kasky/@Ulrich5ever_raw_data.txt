951865233731149825 2018-01-12 17:15:31 UTC <Ulrich5ever> My point is that this racism and these harmful stereotypes dont only extend to Haiti and African Countries but most countries where the people are brown. Furthermore, its not just our president who shares these beliefs.
951865231143264256 2018-01-12 17:15:30 UTC <Ulrich5ever> Costa Rica is a developed nation with nationalized healthcare and a nationwide commitment to peaceful international relations and protecting their environment. Sure they are not without their problems but tbh Id rather live there.
951865228668690432 2018-01-12 17:15:29 UTC <Ulrich5ever> Someone even asked What do they even DO there? Like everyone was so poor they sat around in huts all day thinking about how shitty their country was.
951865226563121152 2018-01-12 17:15:29 UTC <Ulrich5ever> When I went to Costa Rica for study abroad I had people from BOTH PARTIES assume I was going there for a missions trip to save the people there.
951865219801903104 2018-01-12 17:15:27 UTC <Ulrich5ever> All right I gotta get something off my chest about Trumps whole shithole countries comment. It was terrible and Im not excusing it at all, but the problem is deeper than just him.  A thread:
