970845310418374657 2018-03-05 02:15:34 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @4everNeverTrump @Socratic_Hippie It would be more difficult for a foreign entity to sway many millions of voters scattered across the country than concentrated groups of tens of thousands of voters in just a few states.
970845240671301632 2018-03-05 02:15:17 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @4everNeverTrump @Socratic_Hippie The national security rationale for the Electoral College is outdated and therefore it should be retired. If the popular vote determined the president  & not the Electoral College no voter would be more electorally powerful than another.
970791496654966785 2018-03-05 22:41:43 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @4everNeverTrump @Socratic_Hippie The winner-take-all system of the electoral college and rural/urban polarization make our presidential elections marginally more vulnerable to effective targeted strategies by campaign - or Russian propagandists - that could tip the outcome.
970790878192259072 2018-03-05 22:39:16 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @4everNeverTrump @Socratic_Hippie The "unique" nature of the US's Electoral College system, experts say, makes it easier for Russian election-meddling efforts to be successful.  I dont expect you to understand.

968951185108537345 2018-02-28 20:48:59 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> (1)Arming teachers is estimated to be a BILLION dollars paid for by taxpayers. PLUS 80 hours of training to use them. I need dry erase markers, PAPER, special scissors and pencil grips for kids with fine motor issues etc. I get $200 for THE YEAR.  I spend 4x that.
968600556146253824 2018-02-27 21:35:42 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> Had a very interesting talk with my high school students today about armed teachers. All of them are against it- some very astute insight from my students of color too. These kids have valid, important opinions. Adults need to listen.

But they could go & buy a gun in the same store  & kill people with no store responsibility
966833940739907584 2018-02-22 00:35:49 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> Hi, as a #SpecialEducation teacher I would like you to #ArmMeWith more school counselors and social workers. More teaching and less testing.  More tools to help my students. Never, ever guns.

My feelings have nothing to do with the reality of a gender pay gap, that is backed up by numerous studies spanning decades. The facts I presented arent cherry picked either.

960602974392287233 2018-02-05 19:56:10 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @thistallawkgirl @TPoppaPuff But even that slow progress has stalled in recent years. If change continues at the slower rate seen since 2001, women will not reach pay equity with men until 2119.
960602864061206529 2018-02-05 19:55:44 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @thistallawkgirl @TPoppaPuff The pay gap will not likely go away on its own. At the rate of change between 1960 and 2016, women are expected to reach pay equity with men in 2059.
960602385528819714 2018-02-05 19:53:50 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @thistallawkgirl @TPoppaPuff Did you know that in 2016, women working full time in the US typically were paid just 80% of what men were paid? The gap has narrowed since the 70s due to womens progress in education and workforce participation and to mens wages rising at a slower rate.

948296997223780353 2018-01-02 20:56:37 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 Are you kidding? Scientists often build their theories and discoveries on the backs of other failed theories and discoveries. Just as respectable civilizations are often built on the bones of dead ones, respectable science is often built on the bones of scientific failures.
948295548204978178 2018-01-02 20:50:51 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 OMFG- Im as far from a 45 supporter as one can get, and I do know climate change is real.

948274349806702593 2018-01-02 19:26:37 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 He lost his license over a witch hunt lex by a reporter. But its neither here or there, as I questioned vaccines long before I even heard his name. So..bye bye little sheep.  My very healthy kids and I dont need your concern

948252031185313792 2018-01-02 17:57:56 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 I believe in science but I understand  that science is far from being infallible and is constantly in need of being updated, upgraded, challenged, revised, and changed, for the simple fact that science is subject to the narrow confines of mankinds tiny flawed human perception.
948251361153609728 2018-01-02 17:55:16 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 Please explain how my VERY healthy children are in danger? And maybe after you watch your child regress after vaccines youll actually question the efficacy.
948250881253834757 2018-01-02 17:53:22 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 He never admitted to any fraud.
948250795325231106 2018-01-02 17:53:01 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @andrewwakefield @BeccaSutherlan3 No. We merely reported the parents description of what happened to their children, and the clinical findings, he says. We made no claims about the vaccine causing autism. In fact, we said this does not prove an association.

817059630228635649 2017-01-05 17:26:10 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG How diverse do you consider your social group?
817059593037709312 2017-01-05 17:26:01 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG sure it is. Not what I said. Critical reading. Critical thinking.
817059170264449024 2017-01-05 17:24:21 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG no- you should stop. Ask any PoC if they believe "I don't see color" is fair.http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/opinion-dear-tomi-lahren-please-stop-saying-you-dont-see-n690801
817058409845551104 2017-01-05 17:21:19 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG how many of your fellow parishioners do you see or socialize with outside of church?
817058239514873857 2017-01-05 17:20:39 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @yo_poet When I brought Ry back on Tuesday they said "Mo must be back!" I love the inclusivity. My kiddo found their tribe 
817057812337610753 2017-01-05 17:18:57 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG because race MATTERS. How many PoC have you gone out of your way to get to know? Not work related- on a personal basis?
817057488948301824 2017-01-05 17:17:40 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> Ummm.... I don't think that's how it's supposed to work https://twitter.com/nhdogmom/status/817054869278380032

817056615379701760 2017-01-05 17:14:11 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG is stopping the conversation and eliminating PoC from it. Don't lie to yourself- you'll be much happier #Peace

817055754624598017 2017-01-05 17:10:46 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG but have learned to stay away from #FakeNews the best I can. Your denial of your privilege is how systemic racism keeps going
817055429696094208 2017-01-05 17:09:29 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG magazines, articles, etc. I critically read and think when called for. I also support my own bias on occasion
817054971694813184 2017-01-05 17:07:40 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG I don't rely on groupthink to tell me how I should feel. I talk to a wide variety of folks. I read a wide variety of books
817054736868405249 2017-01-05 17:06:44 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG what names? Clueless is a state of being- I too am clueless about many things. Difference: I try to learn.
817054352095477760 2017-01-05 17:05:12 UTC <RedVinesRedWine> @SherryDyerHG if they don't know already- they are in the same clueless boat as you. It's ok. We can't all be present in reality
