800846261821665280 2016-11-21 23:40:02 UTC <khmerradio> Trump is forming a diverse cabinet consisting of a alt-right racist, a conspiracy theorist racist, and an old-timey Southern racist.
800234414672384001 2016-11-19 07:08:46 UTC <khmerradio> The goal is to keep his moronic base angry and constantly attacking various targets. Meanwhile he robs the nation's coffers blind.

794223296891981824 2016-11-03 17:02:44 UTC <khmerradio> Trump has a diverse coalition of evangelicals, the white working class, cartoon frog nazis, anti-Semites, and men's rights activists.
793612198543261697 2016-11-01 00:34:27 UTC <khmerradio> If you don't like the two-party system, vote for Hillary to prevent a one-party system. Then work to build a viable third party.

785248406373629960 2016-10-09 22:39:43 UTC <khmerradio> Republicans would still support Trump if they thought he could win. They have no principles only an instinct for self-preservation.
785158619167875072 2016-10-09 16:42:57 UTC <khmerradio> This election has shown just how many people would happily vote for a fascist who wants destroy the foundations of our democracy.
