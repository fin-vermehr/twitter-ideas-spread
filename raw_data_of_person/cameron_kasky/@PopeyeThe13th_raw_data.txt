972166147041669120 2018-03-09 17:44:06 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo Hehe, last night I pre-ordered a blue one as well. My last 4 phones were black, so I needed something different. Lilac purple is really pretty too, just wasn't a fan of the pinkish shade in an open light.. Got this case 
971979600698855424 2018-03-08 05:22:49 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo What color did ya get? Can't make up my mind..

971505011615088640 2018-03-07 21:56:59 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @PaulOBrien Nah, i don't want anything with the notch and that replicates Apple in any shape and form. That's why @HuaweiMobile will never get my money. It's an embarrassment to our community.

Love that they filled the vacuum left void by LG, by combining wide and telephoto lens modes. Camera blew my mind, just for that it's worth the upgrade. F1.5 & 2.4 is dope on paper. Low light performance seems unparallel!

934659791267303424 2017-11-25 05:47:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @harrytuckerr @ow i am currently testing and cross comparing low light performance on v30, pixel 2 xl and note 8. For me v30 takes better in pics in low light than pixel 2 in most scenarios, even tho it takes lil longer to snap it. 1.6 aperture is hard to beat.
934656533857648640 2017-11-25 05:34:17 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @ow pics coming outta that phone are just jaw dropping! 2017 flagships are just killing me. sooo hard to pick a "daily driver"..

932656708236623872 2017-11-20 17:07:41 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @getpeid This is second year in a row that i want to buy OnePlus, yet i never do cuz of mediocre camera. Every year camera reviews end up being ok. I usually get one of the top 3 android camera performers. $600 option with OIS, and top notch camera hardware and I am in.

919267221976649729 2017-10-14 18:22:39 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH They are both impeccable, just matter of the design & size preference. What kinda surprised me was that the xl was same size like note 8

917526854709297152 2017-10-09 23:07:03 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Just found out that @TMobile carries #LGV30 only in silver color.. and that's my least favorite color from the original 4 released pic.twitter.com/eExmOrQ2Lp

917473715876634624 2017-10-09 19:35:54 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Tried to get Pixel buds too but they were all out of stock. Do both people need to have a pair of PBs in order for translation to work?
917473308043386880 2017-10-09 19:34:17 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Got yo phone :)

916521321453907968 2017-10-06 04:31:25 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @chrismlacy 2/2 again. The only way to get AL to work again is to clear data from storage in app settings. Restarting the phone wouldn't fix it..
916520641041276929 2017-10-06 04:28:43 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @chrismlacy 1/2 System warning that action launcher closed, do I wanna restart to app or quit.. default launcher kicks in. If clicked restart it happens
916513878594412545 2017-10-06 04:01:51 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @chrismlacy Every time when I add Google search bar widget the whole launcher collapses. Using note 8, US T-Mobile variant..

913192152544329728 2017-09-27 00:02:30 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Hey, unrelated, do you know if officially @TMobile #note8 is dual SIM?
913190938083606528 2017-09-27 23:57:40 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Very. I asked before buying coz I was gonna go on a long trip and wanted a dual sim capability. I didn't check myself, you know how it goes
913189999402561536 2017-09-27 23:53:56 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Weird detail is that tmo says that their s8 is dual SIM yet it comes with single tray, and allegedly, software doesn't support dual trays..
913188579567792128 2017-09-27 23:48:18 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Yeah, I bet. I tried to find dual SIM tray for s8 at Samsung stores in Belgrade, Serbia & Budapest, Hungary. I got bunch of confused noes 
913186841133645824 2017-09-27 23:41:23 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Oh shiiiit, is it easy for you to get a replacement tray? For me it isn't. Doubt that they carry it on prime now

910952313442811904 2017-09-21 19:42:10 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> 1. Lots of peeps who would traditionally stick with flagship devices are looking for alternatives due to 1000 coin pricing.

857267017941794816 2017-04-26 16:15:58 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> https://twitter.com/mhbergen/status/857255901819830272
857266902711754752 2017-04-26 16:15:31 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Good to know! https://twitter.com/DPRK_News/status/857256309628043265
856912075620102144 2017-04-25 16:45:34 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik .. are trying to go home while watching videos, cause you don't need to tap the screen first before home button shows up etc. It's great
856911732819730432 2017-04-25 16:44:12 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik ..it is, simply cause it gives me an option of having a hardware home button without it taking up the actual space. It comes in handy if you
856911294896586752 2017-04-25 16:42:28 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik I see exactly what you mean and confusing part about it, cause technically we got 2 home buttons now, yet i still like it a lot exactly how
856743668874530816 2017-04-24 05:36:22 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik Yeah, that's not great. Mine has been all over the place. It seems like in certain scenarios it's really great and then just terrible
856616175278542848 2017-04-24 21:09:46 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> I've been using a fingerprint scanner on GS8 for about 5 days now and it's perfectly fine. It takes few days to get used to, but that's it
856611411882942464 2017-04-24 20:50:50 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> On the other hand, battery life is stupendous with this setup
856602526250000386 2017-04-24 20:15:31 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Customizing GS8 to maximize battery life & realizing it's turning into iPhone7 -720p  -CPU speed limit 70%  -auto brightness - 10% 
856560696762302464 2017-04-24 17:29:18 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 Tried it, it's terrible.
856327133429243904 2017-04-23 02:01:13 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik After long back and forth between g6 & s8/s8+, I got s8 in black. Some next level shit!
856273878548492288 2017-04-23 22:29:36 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @eltomas87 @dasteele1975 Haha, meant to say bottom
856273732435722240 2017-04-23 22:29:01 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @eltomas87 @dasteele1975 Everybody learned from HTC's mistakes. Button line was, don't fuck with the phone's camera. Camera is a Holy Grail of smartphones
856273076161363968 2017-04-23 22:26:24 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @eltomas87 @dasteele1975 That hardware was just outta then known world!
856270487575343104 2017-04-23 22:16:07 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 Yeah, Samsung is not the same anymore when it comes to their flagships
856270278355075072 2017-04-23 22:15:17 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 Too bad for HTC. They had it there for a sec..
856270172604162048 2017-04-23 22:14:52 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 That m7! I had it. My jaw dropped when i unboxed it
856269954848505856 2017-04-23 22:14:00 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 Yea, they always come w extra swag on the side  they are learning, that's for sure. To be fair they respond the most to consumer feedback
856266078883729409 2017-04-23 21:58:36 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 ..& Samsung tends to explore the universe of gimmicks the most..still s8 is soooo next level because of its form factor & lack of weaknesses
856264609807835140 2017-04-23 21:52:46 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dasteele1975 I get you, I buy Samsung's flagships every year cause it's hard not to. I personally enjoy the experimental, rapid process that Android is..
856262181704220673 2017-04-23 21:43:07 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> GS8 is so good that it can have a noticably inferior camera to the Pixel, and it's still gonna be considered better
856261767969636352 2017-04-23 21:41:28 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> GS8 is so good that Samsung could've added an "unremappable" Bixby button on every side of the phone & humans would still buy it. In hordes
856259417385336834 2017-04-23 21:32:08 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Galaxy S8 is so good that it could've came with wired, external fingerprint scanner and it would still be the best smartphone, hands down
856255783469756417 2017-04-23 21:17:41 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik What phone are you personally using these days? Considering that you had a fair amount of time with s8 & g6..
856036649611927552 2017-04-22 06:46:56 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @evleaks Serbia 
855654863476109313 2017-04-21 05:29:51 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @PaulOBrien One of the reasons why i went with s8, at least i could reach it
855595505895710721 2017-04-21 01:33:59 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @davekover @CallipH Nice! I mean even then. Seattle proper's roi for landlords is just not there. Outskirts - YES! Seattle - totally not
855555822599806977 2017-04-21 22:56:18 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @davekover @CallipH If you are paying mortgage on it, you don't want it to be in Seattle 
855547738594746368 2017-04-21 22:24:10 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Nice! Like it a lot
855542839844798464 2017-04-21 22:04:42 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH We are upgrading big brother from dolby 5.1 to 7.1 
855542358024241152 2017-04-21 22:02:48 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Hahaha..ahem..yeah, you might as well 
855463680233820160 2017-04-21 16:50:09 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dadstronaut Looks promising. Are you hiring?
855192557801791488 2017-04-20 22:52:49 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore I am but the position is not ideal, that's for sure. Set to facial unlock, when fails I use pattern
855146614897262592 2017-04-20 19:50:15 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @PaulOBrien Not fair, easier to like
855146254904434688 2017-04-20 19:48:49 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Mine was doing that for awhile and it made no sense to spend half a day trying to get $30 out of it
854549901505515520 2017-04-18 04:19:07 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @johnturek really hoping that Apple will deliver with iPhone 8. The hype is getting real
854548438406512640 2017-04-18 04:13:19 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @johnturek I am so glad that tmo is overnighting it. Anything else would be a torture!
854547806618501120 2017-04-18 04:10:48 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @johnturek yay! 
854541874492620800 2017-04-18 03:47:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @johnturek go check again, mine got processed 7 min ago

854520090624106496 2017-04-18 02:20:40 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @johnturek not yet. refreshing all day.. 
854501168281604096 2017-04-18 01:05:29 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Going through my home using @MarieKondo method. "Life changing magic of tidying up" title accurately reflects the aftermath of the process
854499814557360128 2017-04-18 01:00:06 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @SliderX55 are you with getting unlocked phone?
854490738691670017 2017-04-18 00:24:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo that's awesome! congrats
854460408471605248 2017-04-18 22:23:31 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @sokane1 if you don't wanna get s8 your should stay away from it. Replacing my Pixel XL with it, and already know that I'll miss it 
854408277857230848 2017-04-18 18:56:22 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 I haven't tasted s8 but iris scanner on my note 7 worked over 90% of the time with my glasses. Did note 7 work with your glasses?
854407643397476353 2017-04-18 18:53:50 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @nytimes @RDR0b11  this is the most biased, bitter & weird review of #GalaxyS8. Credibility of this news paper have really plummeted
854400958729670657 2017-04-18 18:27:17 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH I haven't used Android Wear for a year now, and just yesterday I donated my moto 360 OG to Goodwill 
854398605821591552 2017-04-18 18:17:56 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @AndroidPolice @RDR0b11 great review! thx

854060475796959232 2017-04-17 19:54:19 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Scorchio_G you are so nice to him 
854059988368502785 2017-04-17 19:52:23 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @DaveLeeBBC it doesn't, i was suggesting that just for you! You're just special like that 
854052352180932608 2017-04-17 19:22:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th>  #androidhttps://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/853827452765847552
854052089311383552 2017-04-17 19:21:00 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @DaveLeeBBC I just can't handle you. This is by far the dumbest comment about Android in a decade. Why do you talk about tech?
854051345967464448 2017-04-17 19:18:03 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @DaveLeeBBC  "gets messy really quickly" before you comment maybe you should look into few tutorials how to rearrange the icons & widgets
853997648277159936 2017-04-17 15:44:40 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> I like that @TMobile ships phone preorders few days before the official release day! #GalaxyS8
853986310695944192 2017-04-17 14:59:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH Yeya

853369626528423936 2017-04-15 22:09:08 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @iAm_erica got it, scared me got a sec  Thought that s8 was buried in bloat!
853369069336109056 2017-04-15 22:06:55 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @iAm_erica are you taking about s8 from tmo?
853093079946993665 2017-04-14 03:50:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 it'll all depends on individual model. With financing there is same logic across the board. With lease not so much..
853092667319738368 2017-04-14 03:48:36 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 with leasing sometimes numbers don't make sense. Sometimes under the same terms $27k mazda is $500 a month, and $40k lexus is $400
853090470058106882 2017-04-14 03:39:52 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 or that or m2 is really popular
852991205109452800 2017-04-14 21:05:25 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @TheEricAnderson makes sense, did you get the 15"?
852983168541917186 2017-04-14 20:33:29 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @TheEricAnderson that's why i skipped the touchbar. That & thelife. Also, touchbar version wasn't in stock so that made my life easier 
852777400576262145 2017-04-13 06:55:50 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @TMobile @iAm_erica ha, I got that message today as well

849334818651357185 2017-04-04 18:56:15 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo right on, preordered s8 in Orchid Gray last night. G6 vs S8 dilemma solved :) which case did you pick for your S8+?

849253216713752577 2017-04-04 13:31:59 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Preordered Galaxy S8 in Orchid Gray! It seems that it's easier to pick a phone then a case nowadays.. #ticktock #android #excitedmuch
848989204189073409 2017-04-03 20:02:54 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore @rockyelbrodi thank you! exactly
848986111535751168 2017-04-03 19:50:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore Really curious about your Axon 7 fascination.Are you an audiophile who's into Daydream and you never use your camera?Don't get it
848983247023296513 2017-04-03 19:39:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore What's in the pile? Moto Z, Axon 7 and an iPhone 4? 
848975141035941888 2017-04-03 19:07:01 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Hey @POTUS if you want to talk to a disappearing middle class, just go to @IKEAUSA and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
848937867124457472 2017-04-03 16:38:54 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @PopeyeThe13th it doesn't seem like there is an option in a settings to do that as of now
848937666091466752 2017-04-03 16:38:06 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @WinDroidGuy true, yet we are fucked straight out of the box! 
848852320439762944 2017-04-03 10:58:58 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> It seems like everybody is gonna hate the dedicated #Bixby button.. I also hear that there is no way to turn it off :(
848851295108603904 2017-04-03 10:54:54 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik how much sot are you getting off s8 or s8+ or both? :)
848598041330237440 2017-04-02 18:08:33 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo impressive
848011438618624000 2017-03-31 03:17:36 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @JustEos nothing to do?
847639161280512000 2017-03-30 02:38:19 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @vanschneider shhhhhhh! If Apple hears you, they'll never make an Android version
847195848089886720 2017-03-29 21:16:44 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo no worries! sorry for putting on the pressure. It's that close, huh?
847194876303122432 2017-03-29 21:12:53 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo i know it's not an easy answer! I even felt bad asking you that. I wanted to see if you just had to pick one now, which 1 would U?
847193407168446464 2017-03-29 21:07:03 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik love the case!
847192892661669888 2017-03-29 21:05:00 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo g6 or s8?
844335449225150464 2017-03-21 23:50:32 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Adaptive icons on #androidO are dope! Like it a lottt  https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html
842097863723167744 2017-03-15 19:39:10 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @RDR0b11 it would just look ancient compared to other flagships

841439239921262592 2017-03-13 00:02:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore no simple answer, but it doesn't touch other flagships when it comes to camera
841438485277941761 2017-03-13 23:59:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore overall the camera is disappointing  when it comes to real life usage.
841438058616512512 2017-03-13 23:57:20 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore blur, low light photo quality etc
841437381664288768 2017-03-13 23:54:39 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Gamercore and then you decide to use the camera, and you just wanna break the damn thing

799010417393561600 2016-11-16 22:05:03 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> 4.5 h of SOT and still at 49%! Blown away by the battery life on #PixelXL #androidpic.twitter.com/zIlGCqqTEb
798997977004023808 2016-11-16 21:15:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Got the #PixelXL in the mail yesterday. The hype is real. I thought that I'll be hard to impress coz I've been using #Note7 but no..#android
798997153385320448 2016-11-16 21:12:20 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH you had no case, right? I am already slightly paranoid to take my phone out naked.. Surprised how good it is with fingerprints!
798996818629533696 2016-11-16 21:11:00 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dadstronaut exactly! Like everything before elections was just pretend
798992487670890501 2016-11-16 20:53:48 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH just got mine yesterday, still naked, didn't decide about the case yet.. Forgot what color you got? I got xl in silver..
798992174079758336 2016-11-16 20:52:33 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH fuck man! that hurts. sorry
798946493101027328 2016-11-16 17:51:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @TheEricAnderson i was thinking the same thing. Then ended up with the MacBook Pro anyway
798604932051910656 2016-11-15 19:13:47 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @levelsio fyi, i would buy that book. Do it!

796790738176512000 2016-11-10 19:04:50 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH I wish I was there, looks summery
796292809804259328 2016-11-09 10:06:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> My hope rests in the fact that @realDonaldTrump sees lies as a tool, so all the craziest promises he made might be just that.. Bedtime it is
796291144996950018 2016-11-09 09:59:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> One of the most shocking (or not) stat of the night is that 82% of evangelicals voted for Trump
796289694833086464 2016-11-09 09:53:52 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @realDonaldTrump @elizabethforma @cenkuygur sounds good to me!

796182867780911104 2016-11-08 02:49:22 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Ha, this looks like a parallel reality. Trump 147, Clinton 109. Slightly terrified

793502873971634177 2016-11-01 17:20:02 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @levelsio Just curious, would you consider #PixelXL as your daily driver?
793343626029916160 2016-10-31 06:47:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @andrewmartonik Action launcher. Always come back to it for years

790616554283020289 2016-10-24 18:10:50 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Blue variant of #Pixel looks the best tho. By far! #android
790616153987047424 2016-10-24 18:09:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Ordered #PixelXL in silver. Was thinking to get a black one till I compared them side by side. Surprisingly I liked silver little better
790615610858221568 2016-10-24 18:07:05 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Google Still contemplating about keeping the #Note7. I wish that @google makes #PixelXL Pro with pen functionality #android
789232841309597696 2016-10-20 22:32:27 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Played with the pixel and pixel xl today. Ufffffff...Ouch...Too good! Just wish that those nits can come closer to note 7's or at least S7's
789153222568968192 2016-10-20 17:16:04 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH two days ago i decided that i want height adjustable desk. Found some options on Amazon but this is much better! Thanks

778587271494668288 2016-09-21 13:30:45 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH completely agree. would rather wait little longer and get a complete built ready to be used out of the box
778586752252391424 2016-09-21 13:28:41 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH i hope it gets better, but hey i used to say that about hangouts and voice and they never came out of "beta"
778488538648182784 2016-09-20 06:58:25 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @levelsio yeYa for working smarter, not harder bruv!
778488104252473345 2016-09-20 06:56:42 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo now which color you like better? I had black, then switched to the blue. Never looked back :)
777527731923906560 2016-09-18 15:20:31 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @CallipH i do. It's nice, not as good as Skype tho

772407083421478912 2016-09-04 12:12:53 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo spent a week comparing black & blue, went with the black and exchanged it for blue few days later. This blue finish is phenomenal
772135880790188032 2016-09-03 18:15:14 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo i didn't return mine :) coral blue was really hard to find
772083962487255041 2016-09-03 14:48:55 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo did you return your #Note7 ?
769761948669915140 2016-08-27 05:02:04 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo black looks great. took me forever to decide between black and blue. went with blue, couldn't resist
769668219510501377 2016-08-27 22:49:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo what color did you get?
769668151910858752 2016-08-27 22:49:21 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @palmsolo i don't have words to describe it. Yes, it's a hair slower then htc 10 & OnePlus 3 but it's by far the best smartphone I ever had
769325327621337088 2016-08-26 00:07:06 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> Irises can unlock my #Note7 with my glasses on. Absolute win! Really like the feature even tho initially I considered it a gimmick
769310222548480000 2016-08-26 23:07:04 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Ally strongly considering given @simple s lack of commitment to invest in #Android  platform. Too bad tho, cause they are amazing otherwise
769288837218521088 2016-08-26 21:42:06 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> My mind got fucking blown! I unlocked my #Note7 with my irises for the first time. Indescribable feeling, super futuristic yet creepy
767926259384848384 2016-08-22 03:27:42 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Whitehawkx that's one of the reasons why i always supported them over Xbox

767396500380930048 2016-08-21 16:22:37 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Whitehawkx that's what i thought! I am really happy that Samsung's phones can be themed tho. I like vanilla look
767171465913315328 2016-08-20 01:28:25 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Whitehawkx was looking into getting note 7. Noticed that edge has slightly sturdier built tho. Did you look into some custom roms for it?
767117924939079680 2016-08-20 21:55:40 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @Whitehawkx Agree! Since early childhood i played both SF and Mortal Kombat. It's ridiculous how both games have evolved differently
766844824209076225 2016-08-19 03:50:28 UTC <PopeyeThe13th> @dbrandskins @palmsolo what's the color of your note?
