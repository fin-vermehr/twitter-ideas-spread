Does legal mean it's right? Not always. Were registered democrats all of a sudden not registered for primary voting? Yes. Were the county recorders Republican? In most cases, yes.

947296983886151680 2017-12-30 02:42:55 UTC <protosix66> @ZealotRadikov That's understandable and a reason why I don't feed the trolls at all. My issue comes from people I know who get visibly/verbally upset when I'm talking about new recipes I'm trying and offering them food. I could care less what others eat, I do it because it's healthy/harmless
947281062303997952 2017-12-30 01:39:39 UTC <protosix66> It's so interesting to see so many people hate vegans for no reason. People get really upset if you replace animal milk with plant based milks for recipes, or if you eat soybean based foods. Does what I consume really offend so many people?

946943567775260672 2017-12-29 03:18:34 UTC <protosix66> @RadioFreeTom @Pogue009 It was a legitimate question and not as watered down as your description. A curious person living in today's world wants to know how a person devoted to a deity can still approve of science. The answer is simple, clearly, but there are many devotees that deny science.
946942660937359361 2017-12-29 03:14:58 UTC <protosix66> @RadioFreeTom That's really interesting and, might I say, refreshing. I find the idea of deities very inspiring and nostalgic. Personally, I could never adhere to just one or multiple of the millions. I do think religions/ways of life should be expressed freely, but that our laws stay secular.
946939480342118405 2017-12-29 03:02:20 UTC <protosix66> What I also find interesting about the unhinged account @therealroseanne is that she never mentioned that #Trump's unhinged remarks against the #NFL and the athletes, he never once condemns or even mentioned the massive human/child trafficking at the #SuperBowl - #NFLBoycott

However, the ultimate goal of Satanism is be yourself and humanly possible, no restraints, as long as you're not hurting another human or lifeform.
942272070221570049 2017-12-16 05:55:42 UTC <protosix66> @SpectorSimon Satanism is against harming animals unless being attacked or for food for yourself. Ethical treatment, if you will. Some take this to mean that you have to eat meat, some take it to mean you have to be vegan. Both are wrong. Trolls can take either view and piss people off.
942270917320720385 2017-12-16 05:51:07 UTC <protosix66> This has always been a trigger for trolls. Veganism is always attacked or attacking when it comes to Satanism. Read the Satanic Bible, consider what veganism is and make your own choice. #veganhttps://twitter.com/ChurchofSatan/status/942258324862525440
