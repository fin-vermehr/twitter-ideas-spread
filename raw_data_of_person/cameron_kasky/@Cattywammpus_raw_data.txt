966772355530764288 2018-02-22 20:31:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Smartypants60 To call someone a "monster" or a "bad guy" is a tactic used to obfuscate. No way those shooters were normal people at any one time, they are all some sort of super villain.  Because according to the NRA, American life is just like a movie and they all play the hero.

There are a lot of people who have legit issues with the institution of marriage. Marriage is not a silver bullet.  There has been a lot of marriage in the past, society was still fucked up.
961656388882636801 2018-02-08 17:42:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom @huntsvut @noknoknokpeny You're assuming that folks who believe in "sexual liberation" oppose marriage. Or that personal freedom is destroying nuclear families.  Neither is true.

958172492010606593 2018-01-29 02:58:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @msmithobx @RadioFreeTom Tom, you're not a Republican anymore.  Or,  Trump supporters are not Republicans.  There has been a radical split.
958171837120200707 2018-01-29 02:55:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JimmyA_Shook1s @amandacarpenter They could have Foghorn Leghorn lead investigations and the GOP would fall into line behind whatever bullshit he comes up with.  They  Don't  Care  About  Facts
958169302418386944 2018-01-29 02:45:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> Must read thread. What the fuck is going on with this Nunes Memo?!https://twitter.com/kurteichenwald/status/958038848386273280

958061895595929601 2018-01-29 19:38:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WalshFreedom You guys are ALL ABOUT big government. It's just that your big government tends to oppress minorities (which is what you want).  Millennials, as a whole, aren't buying your big (fascist) government.  White Supremacy has a limited appeal.
958059778940399616 2018-01-29 19:30:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @peterdaou Do the math. Deficit spending from these most recent tax cuts will catch up.  The economy will not hit the delirious GOP growth projections. Things will begin to go badly for everyone.
958046287630188544 2018-01-29 18:36:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Phillygirl1441 @EdKrassen It's a Purge.  Will democracy survive?
958038409024479232 2018-01-29 18:05:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JoyAnnReid The GOP is becoming ever more fascist, radicalized... and violent.  They are hell bent on creating an apartheid state.

956749408657272833 2018-01-25 04:43:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson I don't think this means what you think it means.
956703769730850816 2018-01-25 01:42:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @QuinnipiacPoll @Amy_Siskind The Trump presidency is turning over the rock and shining a light on the true numbers of actual white supremacists in America.  Currently it looks like about 1/3 of the US favors an Apartheid state.
956685653307109376 2018-01-25 00:30:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mmfa And #pizzagate  And #SethRich   Those are just their recent failures. There's plenty more shit conspiracies out there.

956315005435052032 2018-01-24 23:57:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis Sadly, none of this will matter.  1/3 of America would not care if Trump shot someone on 5th Avenue.  End  Of  Story
956314004560822272 2018-01-24 23:53:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WalshFreedom He was also against gay marriage and legalizing weed.  Things evolve, dude.
956260310431641600 2018-01-24 20:19:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis It was only by losing control of the entire federal government that our master plan could be realized.  It's so obvious!

956259571244318720 2018-01-24 20:17:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SocialPowerOne1 Maybe Trump could try... telling the truth?  That will beat perjury 100% of the time.

956255649687519232 2018-01-24 20:01:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WalshFreedom Joe, belief in unfounded and crazy conspiracy theories is foundational to the Republican tribe.  You sound like a heretic.

954385879308558337 2018-01-19 16:11:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson Yes, and it was addressing a different question.
954384965109661696 2018-01-19 16:08:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WalshFreedom Agreed.

954196747814760449 2018-01-18 03:40:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson You'll notice that I did not ask anything about who writes or passes legislation. I asked a pretty straightforward question.  Try again.
954093418862358528 2018-01-18 20:49:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson Pop quiz: Who controls all 3 branches of government right now?  I'll wait.

954038056918556673 2018-01-18 17:09:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SocialPowerOne1 I think this confirms that right wing types actually have no working definition for the term "racist". No idea what they're talking about, as usual.
953834899760271361 2018-01-17 03:42:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bryanbehar According to them 'true patriot' means "hates liberals, feminists, and POC".  If you use that definition, Russia is a natural ally.
953828659504193536 2018-01-17 03:17:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SocialPowerOne1 Getting called a racist is worse than the actual racism?  Poor, poor little Tucker.
953827745208741890 2018-01-17 03:13:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @samstein Well... the GOP controls all 3 branches of government.  What's difficult about that math?

953440409920815104 2018-01-16 01:34:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WalshFreedom You are so eager to label as many people as possible "not American".  That is not how America works.
953371993344114688 2018-01-16 21:02:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EdKrassen Stop with the logic, white supremacists are immune to it.  Also, they believe that "might makes right", so...
953359712463896576 2018-01-16 20:14:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GOPChairwoman @RNC @POTUS @davidaxelrod I would think again before ever using the words "tough" and "Mitt Romney" in the same sentence.

POC and specifically #BlackWomen showed up in record numbers to push Doug Jones over the top in the heart of the Confederacy.

940982815000117248 2017-12-13 16:32:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic Alabama is a state fill of White Supremacists, always has been. Last night's win was a defeat of White Supremacy on their home court.  That is what it was.  Any larger discussion of "the Dems" does not fit with what just actually happened.
940980383813742592 2017-12-13 16:23:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> This the only relevant discussion.  Alabama (and the Confederacy itself) is a White Supremacist nation within the United States.

940963770439888896 2017-12-13 15:16:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> The fact that Roy Moore got beat primarily by black women doing work is a beautiful thing.  AND shows the roadmap to electoral success in 2018 and beyond. Take note Progressives, this is how we win.

899816572545449984 2017-08-21 02:12:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> Trump turned himself into George Bush the Lesser tonight, with more racism and even less brains.

897559716586340352 2017-08-15 20:44:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> So the modern GOP needs to be renamed "The Confederacy" and it appears we all need to brace ourselves for the incoming Civil War.

897474749034405889 2017-08-15 15:07:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> It's pretty incredible how America is still looking to Obama for real leadership.

839250655030063104 2017-03-07 23:05:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> No, never. It's their "get out of jail free" card with their constituents.https://twitter.com/CarlaCube/status/839234259307098112
839232822757871616 2017-03-07 21:54:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> This pretty much nails it. Either you are in support of our Union, or you are fighting to destroy it.  Time to make your choice known.https://twitter.com/Pappiness/status/839163072929484800
839212722063495168 2017-03-07 20:34:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> 15) And that is where the real separation in America is today.  I sincerely hope the Union can survive.
839212472988925953 2017-03-07 20:33:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> 14) So when you hear about Trump creating "chaos", remember that for a lot of Americans, that is the best possible scenario.
839212160609726464 2017-03-07 20:32:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> 13) The lives destroyed during the downfall? Just part of the "sacrifice" needed to get rid of the enemy; America's civil servants.
839211616105197568 2017-03-07 20:30:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> 12) One of the defining features of the Alt (both left and right) is the utter lack of HUMANITY and empathy of any kind.
839211214278316032 2017-03-07 20:28:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> 11) But what happens during that collapse? How many people die in a world destabilized and thrown into it chaos?
839210999341162496 2017-03-07 20:27:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> 10) Somehow, the theory goes, after everything burns down we can rebuild some kind of glorious utopia since all our institutions are gone.
839210700262125568 2017-03-07 20:26:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> 9) By declaring them the enemy, they are declaring America the enemy, and working towards its destruction.
839210420078424064 2017-03-07 20:25:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> 8) In their fervent desire to destroy American institutions, they forget several things. These institutions keep us safe and secure.
839209940648546304 2017-03-07 20:23:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> 7) This is why they laugh at the Russian connections and see Wikileaks as the one true font of knowledge. The #deepstate is always lying.
839209614994374656 2017-03-07 20:22:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> 6) While the rest of us look at Trump and his destabilization as a horrible danger, the Alt sees it as a goal.
839209311427387392 2017-03-07 20:21:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> 5) The Alt sees it's biggest enemy as the #deepstate and the US IC (CIA/FBI/NSA). They want to BURN IT ALL DOWN.
839208915346714624 2017-03-07 20:19:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> 4) The Alt brings together folks like Steve Bannon and Susan Sarandon, who both agree that Trump will hasten the end.
839208467323740160 2017-03-07 20:17:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> 3) That the real divide in America today is between the Alt (both right and left) and the rest of us.
839208168072761344 2017-03-07 20:16:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> 2) Today's #Vault7 Wikileaks dump and the embrace of these docs as "proof" that Trump's bullshit allegations are true shows us...
839207617973006336 2017-03-07 20:14:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> 1) America is near a political tipping point between 2 factions that will determine whether our Republic survives, but it's not "Rep/Dem"
839173605502017536 2017-03-07 17:59:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> It's OUR money.  We are tired of it paying for bullshit wars overseas, and would rather have modern First World healthcare.   Crazy, right?https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/839172831741116416

809183462666047488 2016-12-14 23:49:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @PolitiFact @BcinemaTV @veggie64_leslie ALL those polls were wrong. 11/8 demonstrated that.  WAKE UP.

809138619122216960 2016-12-14 20:50:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bourbonroad You act as tho we will have normal elections again in this country after Trump takes office.  So naive.
809138313772736512 2016-12-14 20:49:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @wikileaks @TinaDesireeBerg @bourbonroad So tell me what they say. Specifically.

809137127736819712 2016-12-14 20:44:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bourbonroad So leave the Dems already if you're so excited about it.  Bye, Felicia.

809135213829705730 2016-12-14 20:37:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TinaDesireeBerg You claim we should ignore American IC. But you think wiki leaks and Assange are legit.  K.
809134710374834176 2016-12-14 20:35:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TinaDesireeBerg @NotAvgAmerican She is okay with subverting super delegates, but asking EC to follow Constitution is wrong. <smh>

809128358600552448 2016-12-14 20:10:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NotAvgAmerican @TinaDesireeBerg Then you are tacitly supporting Trump. There's not another way to look at the situation.

809063049407569920 2016-12-14 15:50:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @veggie64_leslie As it is now it takes about 100k votes for an EC point in Wyoming while in CA it takes almost 400k.  Not legit.
809062581029609472 2016-12-14 15:48:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @veggie64_leslie Yes. Those 8M New Yorkers have their votes count much less in the EC than Rhode Islanders.

804723069981835265 2016-12-02 16:25:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> So when Carrier gets to keep $7M instead of paying that in taxes that they legally owe... the government just runs a deficit?  Awesome.https://twitter.com/millerjacob43/status/804721889168003072

798392139495383040 2016-11-14 05:08:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NomTwittuerre That's a fair point. Not all Bernie supporters sat out, nor is that my claim.   But a lot did. Or trashed HRC.

797504210048667648 2016-11-12 18:19:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> I hope you are correct.https://twitter.com/strazz/status/797387875193126916
797503637547143168 2016-11-12 18:17:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> If we are going to do election post-mortems, we need to revisit how poorly Bernie did among POC during the primaries. Honesty time.
797503283245944832 2016-11-12 18:16:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is such a widely forgotten fact of the primary. POC were just not that into Bernie. https://twitter.com/Russian_Starr/status/797474445384384513
797502924528095232 2016-11-12 18:14:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Green_Footballs I don't understand how you can live without blocking them all.
797502549985067008 2016-11-12 18:13:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> Absolutely.  And if you did not oppose that racist message with every fiber of your being then you were in varying degrees complicit.https://twitter.com/Rschooley/status/797474175166185472
797502132630888448 2016-11-12 18:11:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> .@davidfrum is making sense these days. He seems to get the existential threat that Trump represents and the constitutionality of dissent.https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/797501284509216768
797501693428539392 2016-11-12 18:09:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> I have discovered that a lot of them are actually Trump voters or at least quietly happy that he won.  Shameful.https://twitter.com/docrocktex26/status/796701836812185600
797501215915397120 2016-11-12 18:08:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> A reminder for those who thought this election was about "populism" or "elites" or some such bullshit.  Wake up.https://twitter.com/lizzieohreally/status/797499304516734976
797500244816601088 2016-11-12 18:04:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> Strom Thurmond would be dancing with joy right now.  How long before we here "separate but equal" from our new White House?https://twitter.com/Craig_P_G/status/797087637957844992

797324436344946689 2016-11-11 06:25:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @StillJohnCA White people felt so good for a time.  "Sweet! Now I never have to be worried about being called a racist again!"
797324085273296896 2016-11-11 06:24:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> "IF"?  Have you not been paying attention to the election or the reactions of POC and women?  Do better, Senator.https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/796785451713593344

797312305687998464 2016-11-11 05:37:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey @INDXT You just defined Trump perfectly.  Thanks for that.

797308049392209920 2016-11-11 05:20:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @chimeraelf Liberals should oppose fascists like Trump on principle.  "Persuasion" should not be necessary. You disagree?

797303325410480128 2016-11-11 05:01:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GaryLegum I'm feeling the same thing.
797303032383827968 2016-11-11 05:00:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> They really incredible.  So many of them hating on HRC and then shrugging when asked about our incoming dystopian hellscape. #privilegehttps://twitter.com/smoothkobra/status/797274761709633536

797295868118384644 2016-11-11 04:32:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @AdversAerialOne @RandomHero30 I remember that.  What do you think Trump's deportation force will look like, if not that?
797291381022593026 2016-11-11 04:14:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @apuhegde @RandomHero30 They were white guys.  There's a difference.

797281232828542976 2016-11-11 03:33:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @apuhegde @RandomHero30 Trump is a gigantic crony capitalist! He won't even release taxes!
797280945778737152 2016-11-11 03:32:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 @apuhegde I voted for Sanders in the primary.
797277740051238912 2016-11-11 03:20:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @apuhegde @RandomHero30 It took Bill Clinton to pay that debt.   That's a fact.
797276903841247232 2016-11-11 03:16:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Srgood1Steve @apuhegde I believe it is a voter's responsibility to oppose fascists with actual votes.    Instead they stayed home.
797276576928841728 2016-11-11 03:15:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Deficits.  Supply side economics was a huge failure. Kansas with Brownback proved that just recently.
797275344042541056 2016-11-11 03:10:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> The first half of Bernie's statement says "Trump was right".  WTF?https://twitter.com/BeingKimmieToo/status/796821899007447044

797274524995579904 2016-11-11 03:07:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 You seem like a decent guy. Just remember when you are talking about "those people" you are talking about real folks.
797274226096939008 2016-11-11 03:06:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Srgood1Steve @apuhegde I voted Bernie.  But I sure as fuck opposed Trump.   Enjoy your second guessing.

797272679246020608 2016-11-11 02:59:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 All that hate we felt as Obama supporters went super nova over the last 2 years.   Now you run our country. <smh>
797272167268261888 2016-11-11 02:57:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Look, I think we would get along IRL. Be friendly neighbors.   The fear my family feels is REAL. I wish Trump could understand
797271059095396352 2016-11-11 02:53:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 And trust me, we have felt your anger ever since Obama got elected.   We know every fucking day how real it is.
797270233442492416 2016-11-11 02:50:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 It's different when POC are in your family. I had to explain to my son that America does not hate him. He asked me that.

797269037570867201 2016-11-11 02:45:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 And to clarify:  Hearing about mass deportation forces and anti-immigrant hate from Trump for 2 years, we are legit scared.

797265866769375232 2016-11-11 02:32:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 My people came here in the Depression and picked fruit as migrant labor before they farmed. Then g-pa died in Patton's army.
797265563374366720 2016-11-11 02:31:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 When rednecks say "heritage" they generally mean Confederacy. You know this just like I do.   Have some chill.
797264666237931520 2016-11-11 02:28:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @d_greenvalley I grew up a rural redneck. I have been around Trump people all my life.   I really doubt you have.
797264154562174980 2016-11-11 02:26:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Son, I am a proud German and lifetime Liberal.   That is a flat out un-truth.
797263893529669632 2016-11-11 02:24:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 If you're talking about the traitorous Confederacy, you lost me.   Slave owning seccessionist were wrong.

797262882584961024 2016-11-11 02:20:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 I'm a proud German.   I never get called a racist for being proud of my family.
797262504216784896 2016-11-11 02:19:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @d_greenvalley "Worth the risk"?  You obviously face none of that risk.   Enjoy your privilege.

797260674149720064 2016-11-11 02:12:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @d_greenvalley There was ONE candidate who could defeat Trump in the general, that's how the EC works.
797259789378035713 2016-11-11 02:08:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Don't lecture me on what I am seeing every day.
797259591264276482 2016-11-11 02:07:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 There is HATE towards POC like never before. Towards people I love because of this election.
797259398112428036 2016-11-11 02:07:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Have you seen the amount of racism around during and after this election?   Of course not, you don't feel it.

797254366650478592 2016-11-11 01:47:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 And all the resurgent KKK shit she and my bi-racial son are seeing on FB and news all the time now... "unity", right?
797254366482743297 2016-11-11 01:47:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 So my GF's mother, fuck her, right?   And my GF with the permanent visa who is terrified right now? I should tell them what?
797254366440738816 2016-11-11 01:47:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @d_greenvalley You think Trump and his fascist friends don't want to bomb foreigners?

797248442179330049 2016-11-11 01:23:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 So you would tear apart families?   I am asking seriously.
797248258141655041 2016-11-11 01:22:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @d_greenvalley No.   I am talking about real people right now living in real terror of coming Trump policies.
797247857233301504 2016-11-11 01:21:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 But the illegals with extended families are out, right?   This is way more complex than you realize.
797246268074360832 2016-11-11 01:14:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @d_greenvalley Meanwhile, fuck all the women and POC for the next 4 years, amirite?  Awesome plan!

797245427561005056 2016-11-11 01:11:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> Good call. Seriously, a good call. #takeAmericabackhttps://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/797209883905060869
797244540394426369 2016-11-11 01:08:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> That is money.https://twitter.com/KAmorphous/status/797239615077879808
797244089871704064 2016-11-11 01:06:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Picaro12 I voted for Bernie too.   And I am pissed at the Liberals who didn't fucking vote in the general.
797243837986914304 2016-11-11 01:05:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 So treat those families apart, right?   Great plan. Go America!
797243627785199616 2016-11-11 01:04:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb That's not what Bernie says.   Again, disagreeing with your own candidate when it matters most.
797243412973916160 2016-11-11 01:03:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Picaro12 Then enjoy Trump.   You've earned it.
797243236423041024 2016-11-11 01:02:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> What does this even mean?
797243130437210112 2016-11-11 01:02:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb It mattered. Shitting on our general candidate gave us Trump.   This isn't a mystery.
797242904406147072 2016-11-11 01:01:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SnarkCage Liberals pout rage and  stay home = Trump win   There's you're root cause.
797242661132341249 2016-11-11 01:00:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb That's not what Bernie said.   Admit it, you ignored Bernie to pout.  Now we have Trump as result.
797242415157428225 2016-11-11 00:59:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus Calling me a liar is the best you got?
797242259691274240 2016-11-11 00:59:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 Ann's the illegals who are living with legal family?   Fuck them, right?
797242011182997504 2016-11-11 00:58:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @AlphaLackey @LANORML Oh you mean like my GF and our bi-racial son?  Fuck you.
797241744563650560 2016-11-11 00:56:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb I voted for him then.   You should have listened to him in the general.
797241620366135296 2016-11-11 00:56:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> You are the gatekeeper for what is and is not sexist?   LOL!
797241366384259073 2016-11-11 00:55:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb so what?   They should oppose Trump on moral and ethical principle!
797241090919141376 2016-11-11 00:54:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Zooni11 You mean when I voted for Bernie?   Or against Trump?
797240938347143168 2016-11-11 00:53:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @JonathanZaun @68degreesPlz @SnarkCage And Trump will make it better?
797240839235715072 2016-11-11 00:53:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RandomHero30 I listened. So did all the people in this country who are legitimately terrified right now.
797240609681457152 2016-11-11 00:52:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb That's not what Bernie says.
797240533202542592 2016-11-11 00:52:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus I voted for Bernie.   And I expected Liberals to step the fuck up when it came time to stop fascism.
797240331825577985 2016-11-11 00:51:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus @JMart_007 @joshfoxfilm But they can vote in defense of the country.   And chose not to.   Noted.
797239968926027776 2016-11-11 00:49:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> Stop being so stupid.   I can critique white men if I want.
797239729754284032 2016-11-11 00:48:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @JonathanZaun @SnarkCage Makes fascism more tolerable, right?
797239498954326016 2016-11-11 00:48:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb That's not what Bernie says.
797239401000538113 2016-11-11 00:47:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Just phone banked.   I did as much as I was able. Pouting Liberals fucked us all.
797239096221450240 2016-11-11 00:46:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @RandomHero30 Your tribe won.   Burn the rest, amirite?
797238674022748160 2016-11-11 00:44:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Zooni11 This ain't no monarchy. I'm not bending a knee, and I don't recognize fascism as legitimate.
797238395273515008 2016-11-11 00:43:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Bernie supported HRC because he knew the stakes.   You pouted and did not follow Bernie.  WTF?
797238079442468864 2016-11-11 00:42:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus You sitting at home on 11/8 got us Trump.   Your Monday morning QB is fantasy.
797237518341021696 2016-11-11 00:40:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi I can't talk about white guys?   Aren't you being sexist now?
797237253504311297 2016-11-11 00:39:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Way to expand the tent.   You sure know how to get more votes.   Circular firing squad!
797236924834418689 2016-11-11 00:37:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Zooni11 Why?
797236781003325441 2016-11-11 00:37:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Tell me again what you did to beat Trump during the general?
797236647192510465 2016-11-11 00:36:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @RandomHero30 You deserve what you get with Trump.
797236522940411904 2016-11-11 00:36:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus But if WikiLeaks hacked them you're cool with that?   And I would not find anything bad in there?
797234641191088128 2016-11-11 00:28:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> It is 1960 all over again.https://twitter.com/dakey2life/status/797233737855619073
797234228849061888 2016-11-11 00:27:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus @Herbie510 So can I read them?   If not, why?
797233994857267200 2016-11-11 00:26:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb You are a true believer. A Bernie Fundamentalist.
797233706515562496 2016-11-11 00:25:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey @mandm904 That's nice that you're cool with it all.
797233450365263873 2016-11-11 00:24:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus @Herbie510 Why no Bernie emails?   I feel like I have a right to them now.   And Trump's as well.
797233185872457728 2016-11-11 00:22:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> 100% with you on that.https://twitter.com/ezlusztig/status/797228319963889664
797232907278426112 2016-11-11 00:21:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> Wallace is a very good comparison. https://twitter.com/BlackjediNow/status/797232634619305984
797232593578037248 2016-11-11 00:20:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Herbie510 @whatstherukkus Can I read some Bernie emails for comparison?   I'm curious what his campaign said and did.
797232318440034304 2016-11-11 00:19:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Meanwhile Trump sets the country on fire?   Great plan!
797231806818856960 2016-11-11 00:17:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> You Liberals made your choice. Own up to it.https://twitter.com/Brasilmagic/status/797231166399119360
797231424868732929 2016-11-11 00:15:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Srgood1Steve Because all the POC in my life are legitimately terrified.   Glad your co-workers are "all good" tho.
797231178751168512 2016-11-11 00:14:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @FisherBurton Was Sanders on the ballot against Trump?   You, meanwhile, paved the road to the WH for Trump.
797230442466263040 2016-11-11 00:12:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Srgood1Steve You haven't talked to many POC lately, have you?
797230309074837504 2016-11-11 00:11:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @FisherBurton He is going to trial for racketeering and the Rape of a 13 year old girl, you dumb shit.   But "emails", am I right?
797229884653211648 2016-11-11 00:09:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi Uh yeah, being against bad is by definition supporting good.   There were only 2 choices here.
797229593388158976 2016-11-11 00:08:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus I am not listening to anyone who enabled or actively supported Trump.
797229220954968064 2016-11-11 00:07:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus Hey, you made you choice.   You wanted Trump, you own these next 4 years.
797229025391308800 2016-11-11 00:06:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @NoBigGovDuh I know. Your point?
797228739360763904 2016-11-11 00:05:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Srgood1Steve Noted.   Well, at least us white guys will be okay, right?
797228520049020928 2016-11-11 00:04:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @JonathanZaun @Banned_Ali And apparently you are pretty okay with a Trump America.   Noted.
797228361638477825 2016-11-11 00:03:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus You choose the fascist.   Own your choice.
797228158063775745 2016-11-11 00:02:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus Cool.   Enjoy Trump.
797227989586952192 2016-11-11 00:02:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus Yeah, I missed all of that.
797227836339666945 2016-11-11 00:01:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb You don't seem all that upset that Trump won. It was more about HRC hatred with you. Yes?
797224032328257536 2016-11-11 23:46:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @whatstherukkus I have never once said she was an awesome candidate.  Liberals stayed home and allowed white nationalist takeover.
797222503693238274 2016-11-11 23:40:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @LadyReverb @EuroYankeeBlog I need to tell you more about the rural racists who came out to vote for Trump?
797222191334965248 2016-11-11 23:39:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EuroYankeeBlog You really believe that Trumpism is preferable to HRC in the White House?
797221743999885312 2016-11-11 23:37:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey @mandm904 That's a nice easy out, isn't it?
797214479368921093 2016-11-11 23:08:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Danmaynard81 Of course. We are in uncharted territory here, no idea what is coming next.
797213197191122945 2016-11-11 23:03:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> That is referred to as "being a Liberal".https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/797208372072292352
797212411199557633 2016-11-11 23:00:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Danmaynard81 I disagree.  Without constant protest, Trump will think he has universal support.
797211917798412289 2016-11-11 22:58:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey @mandm904 They CHOSE to stay home, protest votes, or rip her to shreds about emails.  Meanwhile, USA burns.
797211571554422784 2016-11-11 22:57:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @QueenKika @AlphaLackey Yes, I am hatefully bigoted against white males.  YOU are the one who gave the "poor me" defense.
797211264837558272 2016-11-11 22:55:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Arlnee @AlphaLackey @mtaibbi Squid clouds of butthurt seems to be "logical" reaction of the oppressed liberal white male. And not voting.
797208050822021120 2016-11-11 22:43:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @pepeisacat Okay Pepe.
797207915706781696 2016-11-11 22:42:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb And then you sat by and watched white nationalists take over the government.  So brave.
797207552949764096 2016-11-11 22:41:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Not about HRC.  About protecting America from white nationalists. This is bigger than your butthurt.
797207289354592256 2016-11-11 22:40:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @janxdevil No. It is to get them to recognize that while their privilege insulates them, POC are terrified.  And they enabled that.
797206916740976640 2016-11-11 22:38:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is the running theme I have heard today from the downtrodden white male liberal when asking why HRC lost.  <smh>  Must be rough.https://twitter.com/AlphaLackey/status/797157856130859009
797205366081613824 2016-11-11 22:32:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @janxdevil Oh? Explain.
797205240168648704 2016-11-11 22:31:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb No, they made a CHOICE.  And they have to own the choice that they made to stay home.
797205098166263809 2016-11-11 22:31:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> I am getting Trump love today from Bernie Bros.  God help us, because Liberals don't seem like they will.https://twitter.com/EuroYankeeBlog/status/797203570638602240
797204855056019456 2016-11-11 22:30:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @LadyReverb @EuroYankeeBlog Explain this.
797204784763633664 2016-11-11 22:30:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog As an American citizen I am pretty sure I know more about Trump (and his movement) than you do.
797204584833789952 2016-11-11 22:29:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Danmaynard81 The Civil Rights protesters beg to differ.
797202570393464833 2016-11-11 22:21:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog I googled Mussolini and got a pic of Trump... who you helped into office.
797202277253529600 2016-11-11 22:20:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @LadyReverb @EuroYankeeBlog You got yourself Trump.  Enjoy it, you've earned it.
797202117765148672 2016-11-11 22:19:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Zooni11 Don't even.  You got yourself Trump now. Own your choice.
797201929252147200 2016-11-11 22:18:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb I voted for Bernie.  I would have voted for a dead horse in the general if it kept Trump out.
797201390934183937 2016-11-11 22:16:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @janxdevil Liberals apparently did not understand the stakes of this election.  They are about to learn the hard way.
797201022284275712 2016-11-11 22:15:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog That's not the point.  Point is that Liberals ENABLED Trump to take over the government. It was a CHOICE they made.
797200452676775936 2016-11-11 22:12:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Danmaynard81 Liberals turning out to vote for HRC would have worked because math.  They CHOSE to let Donald win.
797200177702412288 2016-11-11 22:11:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Does not change the fact that Liberals enabled a fascist takeover through inaction. Own that choice.
797199786524823552 2016-11-11 22:10:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog I don't give a shit if they were against Kanye.  By being "against" his one opponent, a fascist took over the USA.
797198169775837184 2016-11-11 22:03:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bloodtribeelect @AlGiordano TOTALLY.  Protests have never worked for liberals in the past!
797197741872988161 2016-11-11 22:02:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> This has been my day on twitter in a nutshell.https://twitter.com/maryellenmurr/status/796830084757852160
797197353019011072 2016-11-11 22:00:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb He could not beat her.  He could not close the deal. If he's what you say, should have been a blow out.
797196903800717313 2016-11-11 21:58:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @big_bear_mn Obama voter turnout versus HRC. Look it up.  Trump got about same votes as Romney.
797196711198265344 2016-11-11 21:58:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @LadyReverb I DON'T CARE if it split the party.  The party ALLOWED a fascist to take the government over because of poutrage.
797196377264488448 2016-11-11 21:56:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> Spent the day squabbling with Bernie bros, obvious they were more interested in shitting on HRC than opposing existential threat of Trump.
797195250880036864 2016-11-11 21:52:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> Holy fuck YES to this.https://twitter.com/Danmaynard81/status/797181451879981057
797195024504979459 2016-11-11 21:51:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> No, they have not.   They still blame the DNC and HRC.https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/796577424540626945
797194620585144320 2016-11-11 21:49:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb Polls, she says. LOL!
797194469946716160 2016-11-11 21:49:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @LadyReverb No shit.   And staying home put Breitbart News in the west wing.   Own your choice.
797194200299114496 2016-11-11 21:48:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @big_bear_mn Liberals choose to stay home and pout while a white nationalist revolution took place in America.   So yeah, their fault.
797193775382609924 2016-11-11 21:46:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @PrecariousPhoto Let's talk next year.   I done think you understand what just happened.
797193557400375297 2016-11-11 21:45:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Zooni11 "Bathe"  And how, exactly, am I a fascist?
797193121020854273 2016-11-11 21:43:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog @LadyReverb If you believe Bernie could have won you have no idea what just took place.
797192892162809856 2016-11-11 21:42:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @bwreed So the KKK and David Duke and other white nationalist fans of Trump are "ordinary" Americans?   Gotcha.
797192404839239680 2016-11-11 21:40:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog You're holding this up as a point of pride? Trump used anti-semite dog whistles all through his campaign.
797192112814993408 2016-11-11 21:39:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 @mtaibbi You would rather pout than fight real fascism?   Noted.
797191766373867520 2016-11-11 21:38:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog I voted for Bernie.  Pretty quick on the draw with the slander.
797191579131723776 2016-11-11 21:37:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog You have that all wrong.
797191469278732288 2016-11-11 21:37:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @MattMurph24 @anypigslft I am not forgetting them.
797191359857704960 2016-11-11 21:36:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @LadyReverb What's your point?   Your hurt feelings > fascist in WH?

797179757959868416 2016-11-11 20:50:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Because they don't speak Spanish? Fairly obvious.
797179510185541632 2016-11-11 20:49:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan He doesn't give two shakes of a dead rat's ass about actually governing.
797179372167798784 2016-11-11 20:49:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President No, you have ushered in fascism.  Congrats and enjoy.
797178865428766720 2016-11-11 20:47:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey LOL!  Keep going.  /popcorn

797178293636075520 2016-11-11 20:44:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @aimeenancygrace So?

797177447087116288 2016-11-11 20:41:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey Because I know Red Pill guys.  "Alpha" is a tell.

797176215060627456 2016-11-11 20:36:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi The squid clouds of butthurt pumped out by white liberal males not feeling "enthusiastic" about opposing fascism is a major reason.
797174932614488064 2016-11-11 20:31:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KeepsinItRealz @mtaibbi @jeffhext I don't really care who you nominate as long as the FASCIST loses.

797173885795901440 2016-11-11 20:27:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi The SYSTEM is now FASCIST.  You see that as a positive outcome. May your #privilege insulate you well.
797172986302210048 2016-11-11 20:23:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> They blame Hillary. They won't learn what it means to come together to oppose fascism.https://twitter.com/RawStory/status/797167189459668992
797172789056679936 2016-11-11 20:22:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> I just ran into this full force from self-proclaimed liberal white men.  Shocker! They are not feeling threatened by DT. #privilegehttps://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/797060304689631232

797170350802944000 2016-11-11 20:13:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @68degreesPlz @JonathanZaun A lot of these dudes shit all over HRC during election.   You think that had no consequences?
797169796265578496 2016-11-11 20:11:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @bljacka Hey, I voted for Bernie.  I am pissed at all the liberals who sat home and WATCHED fascism take over America.
797169289782435840 2016-11-11 20:09:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog The fuck I can't.   They sat and WATCHED a white nationalist revolution take place.
797168969849241600 2016-11-11 20:07:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey Oh, I get it.  You're Red Pill, aren't you?
797168564574658561 2016-11-11 20:06:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @handleofavandal Wat.
797168415190433792 2016-11-11 20:05:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @48thAve @EuroYankeeBlog Wait...  There are not enough arguments against fascism already? Are you serious right now?
797168065976799232 2016-11-11 20:04:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @bljacka But complaining that you felt insufficiently motivated to OPPOSE FASCISM resonates with you?
797167713017659392 2016-11-11 20:02:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey You are saying you feel discriminated against for being white and male?   You should vote for Trump.
797166338833682432 2016-11-11 19:57:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @JeannieSee No shit.  But the alternative was Donald fucking Trump.
797166158000439296 2016-11-11 19:56:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @EuroYankeeBlog Again, you need a reason to vote to oppose fascism other than the fact that it is FASCISM?  <smh>
797165674531459072 2016-11-11 19:54:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey You have the sads because liberals don't make you feel loved for being a white male.  Must be rough.
797165432318791681 2016-11-11 19:53:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @48thAve So you blame the candidate.  I blame the voters for shrugging while fascism walked into the Oval Office.
797165093460901888 2016-11-11 19:52:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey IGNORE THE FEELINGS OF WHITE MEN AT YOUR PERIL.  Got it.
797164682209464320 2016-11-11 19:50:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @IMarianneE @RuckCohlchez When fascism comes knocking... you quibbled over emails.  Remember that.
797164529217990656 2016-11-11 19:50:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @RuckCohlchez @IMarianneE That is what we are doing.

797163787446947840 2016-11-11 19:47:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey Oppressed white male?   The struggle is real, apparently.
797163472744116224 2016-11-11 19:45:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi I am sorry that doing your civic duty to oppose fascism was not a visceral thrill for you, but you should have done it regardless.
797163085739921408 2016-11-11 19:44:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @mmeschke01 Then pout and enjoy Trump.  You've earned it through your inaction.
797162797285052416 2016-11-11 19:43:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @JonathanZaun Hilarious.  We'll pause the fight against fascism until you feel sufficiently motivated.
797162373442203649 2016-11-11 19:41:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey Enjoy your privilege while POC, women, and immigrants take the heat from Trump administration.

797161495045906432 2016-11-11 19:38:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @RuckCohlchez The argument is that Trump won because Liberals pouted.  That is as real as it gets. We own this now.

797160996397686784 2016-11-11 19:36:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Danmaynard81 Oh, how sad!  Meanwhile, all the POC and immigrants who are fearing for their lives... "bummer dudes!"
797160705438851072 2016-11-11 19:34:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Teddyshouse2II Sanders supported HRC. Where were you?
797160517936648192 2016-11-11 19:34:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi We liberals need to OWN the fact that we chose to sit home and pout while a fascist regime took over our country.  That happened.
797160161517285377 2016-11-11 19:32:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi I don't really give two shits if you were excited about HRC.  Vote to oppose real fascism! This is not a fucking game anymore!
797159748332232704 2016-11-11 19:31:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey I should not have to pat you on your head and make you feel happy to get you to come out and FIGHT FASCISM.  WTF?
797159501564522496 2016-11-11 19:30:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @AlphaLackey BULL FUCKING SHIT. I am a white male. It's time for you to grow up and realize what is at stake here. /1

797159014106730496 2016-11-11 19:28:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @RuckCohlchez Dems need to focus on doing their duty to oppose fascism, not feeling "enthusiastic". Grow up.
797158686762287104 2016-11-11 19:26:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @Lowenaffchen Maybe by not shrieking about bullshit stories like private email servers as if they were important.
797158512597954560 2016-11-11 19:26:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi @bwreed The voters who stayed home ushered in Trump to the WH.
797158271777804288 2016-11-11 19:25:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi YOU are part of the liberal intelligentsia! You could have explained this but instead you chose to shit on our own candidate.
797157974506541057 2016-11-11 19:24:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi DOES NOT MATTER.   The fight was on! Either support her 100% to oppose fascism or sit and pout while America falls.
797157454052102144 2016-11-11 19:22:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> I have this pic up on my header for a reason.  This is where America is headed with Trump at the helm.https://twitter.com/ezlusztig/status/797156762306498562
797156969282834433 2016-11-11 19:20:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> The need for white liberals to feel "enthusiastic" before they can be bothered to oppose a fascist Authoritarian is why we have Trump.https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/797155735159369728
797156597520683008 2016-11-11 19:18:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi This fucking need for white liberal men to get patted on the head so they feel "enthusiastic" about voting is the reason we lost.

797150954009153536 2016-11-11 18:56:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> Recognize that when Trump talks "unity", he really means "KNEEL".  RT if you will never bend the knee to this fascist! #theResistance
797150390806380545 2016-11-11 18:53:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> The fact that over half the country did not vote speaks volumes as to HOW DIFFICULT the conservatives have made voting, period.https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/797149906305740800
797149562813095936 2016-11-11 18:50:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMackowiak Yes, but you cannot discount the white nationalism that turned out rural whites for Trump.

797147528424632320 2016-11-11 18:42:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> The fact that the GOP could take over all three branches of government while LOSING the pop vote shows the voting crisis we are facing.
797146694714474496 2016-11-11 18:39:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @rmiskimens @benjamuniverse Bullshit. She did her part to oppose fascism.   Enjoy the next 4 years with Trump that you helped create.

797138581273747456 2016-11-11 18:07:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TurnBackAround No, I'm a straight white male. America was made for me.  All my friends and family who are not straight white males tho...
797138113000681473 2016-11-11 18:05:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EdOverbeek So true. If there's one thing I know, white folks HATE being shown when they are acting racist.  "ZOMG, totally not racist!"
797136687528718336 2016-11-11 17:59:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> Well said, California!!https://twitter.com/IvanBrandon/status/797087516486750208
797136464739827712 2016-11-11 17:58:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> No, we are not united.  And platitudes will not protect those Americans about to get attacked by this administration.https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/797133131824373761
797135610452447234 2016-11-11 17:55:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> By being more concerned with trying to keep the conversation "polite", MSM helped usher in real fascism to the White House.
797134957034369024 2016-11-11 17:52:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @benjamuniverse No.  She lost because white nationalists came out in droves and people like you pouted instead of voted.
797134732949471232 2016-11-11 17:51:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TurnBackAround Hey... fuck you.
797134039509413888 2016-11-11 17:48:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> White folks! WE are the reason DT got elected.  Can't change who I am, but I will look neighbors in the eye and call them on their bullshit.https://twitter.com/ChristineIAm/status/797132687714713600
797132825489117187 2016-11-11 17:44:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> And this is why we are fucked as a nation.
797132168858214400 2016-11-11 17:41:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> We told them the stakes, they wanted to see HRC burn more than they were worried about Trump.   Privilege is a helluva drug.https://twitter.com/NooneOfan/status/797129815149150208
797131808349392896 2016-11-11 17:40:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @benjamuniverse No. It was you not supporting her and getting out to vote that did. That's a quantitative reality.
797131457386844164 2016-11-11 17:38:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> Got my pin on today. Helping people feel safe is one of the first steps. #notmypresident #theResistancepic.twitter.com/MtQNtIcTNq
797129217548763136 2016-11-11 17:29:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse Because people like you focused on wrecking our candidate more than opposing the fascist opponent.
797129000040574976 2016-11-11 17:28:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> I agree with this take. Trump never wanted to win.   Steve Bannon will be running the show.https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/797127543891656704

797127589676449792 2016-11-11 17:23:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse Clinton was opposing Trump. If you refused to support her you ushered in fascism.
797127349930053632 2016-11-11 17:22:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse This election was about white nationalism, not HRC.
797126655776997376 2016-11-11 17:19:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse Your Monday Morning Quarterbacking is incorrect and counterproductive. Again, what did you DO to oppose him?
797126397231697920 2016-11-11 17:18:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse What did you do about it? Flaccid protest vote? Or just pout?
797126009782865920 2016-11-11 17:17:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic @RBReich My ass.  GOP caused economic stress. Obama brought unemployment to 4.9%, gas prices low, national debt down by trillions.

797120687198519296 2016-11-11 16:55:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse I voted for Bernie in the primary and HRC in the general.  Any vote that did not go for HRC helped Trump.

797119284950335489 2016-11-11 16:50:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MSNBC @CNN @TallyAnnaE @bmoschetti And Comey's letter was the true tipping point.

797115694126989312 2016-11-11 16:36:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> So the new question for the Left is... WHAT WILL YOU DO TO OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP NOW?  /6  #theResistance
797115419765055488 2016-11-11 16:35:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> This election came down to record LOW Democratic turn out. Too many of us did not do our civic duty and America is paying the price now.  /5
797115220028076032 2016-11-11 16:34:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> There are times when doing your civic duty is not fun and exciting, but you do it because you love America and hate fascism.  /4
797114937529090049 2016-11-11 16:33:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> I supported Bernie in the primaries too, but I am aware that elections have consequences. We told you about the dangers of Trump.  /3
797114626471129088 2016-11-11 16:31:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> "Shitting on HRC" and "staying home pouting instead of voting" are true for a lot of you.  Time to own up to your decisions.  /2
797114283943305216 2016-11-11 16:30:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> There is a question every self-professed "Liberal" and "Progressive" needs to be asked right now:  WHAT DID YOU DO TO STOP TRUMP?  /1
797113923631595521 2016-11-11 16:29:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @insanityreport @benjamuniverse I am pretty certain HRC opposed Trump.  What did YOU do to oppose him?
797113179373334528 2016-11-11 16:26:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> The FBI was the tipping point.  Remember that.https://twitter.com/speechboy71/status/797112501246816258
797112670113566720 2016-11-11 16:24:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> The greatest lie the devil ever told was that the Civil War ended.  The enduring "cold" Civil War is starting to get hot again.

797110424218968064 2016-11-11 16:15:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> This was white nationalists coming out of the woodwork for Trump. You are saying HRC should have pandered to these voters?https://twitter.com/politico/status/797109168222208000

796885034900721664 2016-11-10 01:19:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> If the fact that the white power movement is JUBILANT about a Trump victory does explain this election to you, nothing will.https://twitter.com/LiberalEffects/status/796879392710463488

796874118566006784 2016-11-10 00:36:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 You are correct. But tolerating someone at work does not mean someone won't do and say some racist shit.
796872666959351809 2016-11-10 00:30:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 Equality from your eyes perhaps. Other people have unique experiences in life unlike us white men. Can you see that?
796872300427493377 2016-11-10 00:28:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 Dems got appeal in those areas because of UNION support. Too much POC and gay rights? Those white tribes rally up hard.
796872035641135105 2016-11-10 00:27:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 You need to be honest here. The bigger divide is RACE. I grew up rural, live urban. I am related to Trump voters.
796871619201232896 2016-11-10 00:26:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 Yes, HRC was very polarizing. And not very inspiring.
796871511877423104 2016-11-10 00:25:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 Liberals are not "anti-police". Liberals are pro justice for all. We are not anarchists.
796871122025230336 2016-11-10 00:24:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz Fascists pretended to be Roman to put a shiny veneer on the intellectual void of their ideas. /3
796870669208207360 2016-11-10 00:22:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz Those bunched rushes are from the Romans, a society that needs historical context to understand correctly. /2
796870483706712064 2016-11-10 00:21:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz The FACTS are that actual fascists stole their ideas from the Romans, wanted to recreate Roman state. /1
796870188163440640 2016-11-10 00:20:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 But it is actual equality starting to happen. /2
796870047633313792 2016-11-10 00:19:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @steveg1425 What you are seeing is the loss of the status quo that enshrined white supremacy. To white folks that feels like "unequal". /1
796869350334468096 2016-11-10 00:17:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> What will Trump actually do in office?  Steal everything not nailed down.  Imelda Marcos will look like a philanthropist in comparison.

796859393287471104 2016-11-10 23:37:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KaraCalavera @steveg1425 You are aware that white folks fought the Confederacy as well as Jim Crow? Both those were white supremacy.
796859076164534272 2016-11-10 23:36:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KaraCalavera @steveg1425 I am talking (obviously) about the people who voted for Trump.
796858674023055360 2016-11-10 23:34:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz Should I show you some quotes of Obama saying gays should not be allowed to marry? Would you understand then?
796858331943972864 2016-11-10 23:33:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz You need to reread that description of what the monument symbolizes, you get it wrong.

796849721608269824 2016-11-10 22:59:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> I thought Trump was an idiot for constantly campaigning against a lame duck president, turns out hating Obama unified his voters.https://twitter.com/KaraCalavera/status/796849169638064129

796848195112341505 2016-11-10 22:53:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass It was not the economy.  It was a white nationalist rage-gasm against Obama and leftism (women as well) in general.
796846660391288832 2016-11-10 22:47:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @MasterSiKGrizz That takes compromise and finding allies in different places. Both are masterful at this art. /5

796481360164589568 2016-11-09 22:35:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RyanTAnd We know what "traditional values" means. Racism and sexism are very "traditional".

796476515940605952 2016-11-09 22:16:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @GiveMeSprinkles @bronsonjbarton What? Trump FEASTED on identity politics!
796473460734050304 2016-11-09 22:04:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @GiveMeSprinkles @bronsonjbarton I wish Bernie had won, but this election was about backlash against Obama.
796461606204866560 2016-11-09 21:16:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @GiveMeSprinkles @bronsonjbarton It's safe to say Trump polling has been wrong from the beginning.
796458718246227968 2016-11-09 21:05:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom And his need for revenge.
796456445495504896 2016-11-09 20:56:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @GiveMeSprinkles @bronsonjbarton No poll anywhere had HRC losing last night.   Sanders would have suffered same fate.

796450752017272832 2016-11-09 20:33:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> A white nationalist revolution just took place in America.  Are you awake now #progressive folks? https://twitter.com/timothycsimons/status/796190647430488064

796449548105224192 2016-11-09 20:29:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> For those #progressive folks who still don't grasp the significance of this election...  Today it is 1960 in America all over again.
796449359172747264 2016-11-09 20:28:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> It means nothing. They control the levers of power.  It's 1960 all over again.https://twitter.com/owillis/status/796439199738200065
796449097137803264 2016-11-09 20:27:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 That reckoning is here right now.  The white racism of America is indisputably on display in front of the world.

796446474489843712 2016-11-09 20:16:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JerryLingle @docrocktex26 Of course I was angry then as well.

796427106305462272 2016-11-09 18:59:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GiveMeSprinkles @TheXclass White nationalists elected Trump.   White nationalists would never vote for a socialist Jew.
796423084383178753 2016-11-09 18:43:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 Naturally. This was the most divisive election since Lincoln was elected.  The only difference is that Trump is fascist.
796422351847964672 2016-11-09 18:41:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 I am with you on this, but I have no idea how we are going to protect this right. It's so ugly right now.
796422011903885312 2016-11-09 18:39:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> Important to remember that Trump did not win in spite of being an Obama Birther, he won BECAUSE he is an Obama Birther.  #notmypresident

796412226156433408 2016-11-09 18:00:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is correct.  Trumpism, like all fascism, is a gangster mentality at heart and in day to day operation.https://twitter.com/jonathanchait/status/796411567931850752

796410141587292160 2016-11-09 17:52:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SymoneDSanders And white women. College educated and not college educated.
796409725667590144 2016-11-09 17:50:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 And the Southern Strategy is just a continuation of the Antebellum mindset.  Nothing has changed since Fort Sumter.

796408496971354112 2016-11-09 17:45:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is exactly what is coming. Full repeal of VRA, for starters.https://twitter.com/jkarsh/status/796408201436499968

796403523554406400 2016-11-09 17:26:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SubBeck Last night was a white nationalist revolution. Whites versus people of color for the control of America.
796403239826558976 2016-11-09 17:25:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GrnEyedMandy I am in to win. I got your back if you have mine.
796401153185431552 2016-11-09 17:16:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic If you think Sanders could have defeated Trumpism you are dead wrong.
796401017235480576 2016-11-09 17:16:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is for all the people out there trying to argue this race was about anything BESIDES white nationalism.https://twitter.com/profblmkelley/status/796209866914361347
796400492653912065 2016-11-09 17:14:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic Not going to disagree, but you cannot ignore the shocking white nationalism on display.

796396085665091584 2016-11-09 16:56:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> They don't care. This election was a "white thing" for them.https://twitter.com/hipsterocracy/status/796395740499054592

796373370090598400 2016-11-09 15:26:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass If you actually believe a socialist Jew could have beaten Trumpism, you are dangerously unaware of what just took place.

796228742620135424 2016-11-08 05:51:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom @MrNobodyTweets No. This is uncharted territory.   The Constitution is under direct assault from this election.
796228311273721856 2016-11-08 05:49:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> I believed too. I really did.   Everything I hate about this country won tonight.https://twitter.com/baratunde/status/796222467207528449
796224668264865792 2016-11-08 05:35:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WyzeChef @BlueUrchinFish To the people who said "post racist America because Obama" it was.
796224331479031808 2016-11-08 05:34:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @pquaife @retrosher Starting tomorrow, we're in a brand new America.   Huge cultural regression coming.
796223681538101248 2016-11-08 05:31:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jonfavs You don't "come together" when white nationalism triumphs.   You fight or you leave.
796223203974623233 2016-11-08 05:29:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WyzeChef @BlueUrchinFish No. He turned over a rock and put the light on a racist and misogynistic US. And then those fuckers voted.

796216392856977408 2016-11-08 05:02:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GavHull Actually, it is. We just never imagined how deep the rot goes.
796216194327920640 2016-11-08 05:01:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis @DonnaDiva Dude, I am not sure we can come back from this.

796211722927230976 2016-11-08 04:44:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> Giuliani just called this "a win like Andrew Jackson's".  He has never been more right.
796211194914713600 2016-11-08 04:41:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom @wbriggsburton I dunno man, this is not just another POTUS.

796210880958447617 2016-11-08 04:40:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President #progressive agenda is about to get rolled back in ways you cannot even imagine.
796210168740515840 2016-11-08 04:37:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President You cannot call yourself #progressive and be happy about tonight's results.
796209502143987712 2016-11-08 04:35:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Nihilism, eh?   Okay.

796208910071803904 2016-11-08 04:32:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RyanNewYork @BlueUrchinFish No.   It is racism and sexism. More than we ever imagined.
796208607138189312 2016-11-08 04:31:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @michaelbd Sexism and racism are hand in glove.
796208110247387136 2016-11-08 04:29:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ParkerMolloy Oh yes he is. Just not the kind of revolution they think.   They want to burn it all down.
796207856479387648 2016-11-08 04:28:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President You're anti Obama now too? Since when did you become a Trump supporter?
796206857345847296 2016-11-08 04:24:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Green_Footballs We haven't actually changed since the Civil War.
796198886226309120 2016-11-08 03:53:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass No. It's American tribalism.   White nationalism wins tonight.
796198532759756800 2016-11-08 03:51:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom Yes. I turned a corner tonight. There's no going back.
796198284377223170 2016-11-08 03:50:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 It is way worse than we thought. And I thought it was racist and sexist as fuck.
796187553367851008 2016-11-08 03:07:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joseiswriting @norrthpier @SRowntreeNews Yes, it really feels like that.
796187199347691520 2016-11-08 03:06:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ImCatfishAF @ConnorHutyler Absolutely. Or the fact that anyone watches network TV at all anymore.

795678428951216128 2016-11-07 17:24:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President A lot of white people are racist. I know this quantitatively and qualitatively from direct experience.
795675117355270145 2016-11-07 17:11:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> Fits and starts... but America is changing.  The feral Trump supporters of today are being left behind by today's youth.https://twitter.com/hannahbfine/status/795332494967111680
795674832415227904 2016-11-07 17:10:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President That's the crux.  Send a AA man in front of a white judge and white jury, he will be guilty. Been like that for generations.
795674488427819008 2016-11-07 17:09:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @QChawkeyeinFL @co_rapunzel4 My neighbors taught me redneck culture. My family are very bleeding heart liberals.
795674156830375936 2016-11-07 17:07:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> Best summation of the #progressive Left and their silly #green candidate I have ever seen.https://twitter.com/fawfulfan/status/795668393009512448

795673052491091968 2016-11-07 17:03:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President So "they deserve it" is your answer to charges of systemic racism?
795670448734281728 2016-11-07 16:53:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President You've already lost this argument. http://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/raceinc.html
795669980440211458 2016-11-07 16:51:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 TX becoming as reliably blue as CA is this guy's political wet dream.
795668824792018944 2016-11-07 16:46:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @QChawkeyeinFL @co_rapunzel4 Ha! That's awesome. Kudos to your mom. It's a country thang... ;)
795668537155022848 2016-11-07 16:45:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Sorry, none of that disproves systemic racism. That's a different topic.
795666192056713216 2016-11-07 16:36:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President You really believe that the the fact that ANY whites are in prison AT ALL disproves systemic racism in the justice system?
795665282572296192 2016-11-07 16:32:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @brucepknight @docrocktex26 It would have worked in Kansas as well, where its failings have been on FULL display.

795664467509940225 2016-11-07 16:29:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President This is not a dichotomy we are talking about here. It's not 'either/or".
795664317093818368 2016-11-07 16:28:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Only because they fought and died for it. That does not mean that justice is colorblind or gender neutral. Long ways to go.
795663790226321408 2016-11-07 16:26:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President K.
795663112221270016 2016-11-07 16:24:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Court rulings have always favored the people who built and controlled the courts and the laws.
795662869463302144 2016-11-07 16:23:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President LOL! It always has been. White males built and controlled the courts of the US. Women and AA's could not vote.
795662613505916928 2016-11-07 16:22:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President It's impossible to deny that there is a faction within FBI right now that is obsessed with them. The "revolt" in the FBI.
795661563390672896 2016-11-07 16:17:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President I have done my own research and don't agree with that statement.
795659774817775616 2016-11-07 16:10:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President The hatred for the Clintons is totally irrational, hence all the wild ass conspiracy theories.
795659468885213184 2016-11-07 16:09:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President I don't believe that regular justice is impartial or fair. So until it is...
795656345680678913 2016-11-07 15:57:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Hillary has been followed around by the FBI for decades. They hate her but she has done nothing wrong. This is nothing new.
795656044860932096 2016-11-07 15:55:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President With what? The Left is about people. What is there in the party without social justice for all? Environmental? PETA?

795320592803057664 2016-11-06 17:43:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President If you really wanted the answer to that question, I am sure they have been asked that. It's out there most likely.
795320028644052992 2016-11-06 17:40:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> Until the US decides to mainstream and standardize our elections we will never fulfill our democratic potential.
795319712422850560 2016-11-06 17:39:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> In the largest FEDERAL election of all, why the fuck does each state have its own half-assed way of doing things?
794656655883370497 2016-11-04 21:44:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> So Breitbart is the actual epicenter of the GOP as well as the FBI.  America is well and truly fucked.https://twitter.com/VFHIVE/status/794232700962017281

774723430763474944 2016-09-10 21:37:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> According to Trump, getting CALLED a racist/sexist/nazi is much worse than the actual racism/sexism/nazism itself. #basketofdeplorabes

767827685120675840 2016-08-22 20:56:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> Hey Media, here is an ACTUAL "both sides do it" thing to report on.https://twitter.com/ChrisJZullo/status/767823675554930692
767827341158543360 2016-08-22 20:54:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @politicalmath Goldwater. Southern Strategy. Welfare Queens. Willie Horton. "State's Rights". Birthers.  GOP has always been this way.
767825501054394368 2016-08-22 20:47:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MaxBoot @politicalmath GOP has embraced racists and has pushed back hard against Civil Rights for decades now.  Wake up.
767820505923530752 2016-08-22 20:27:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> Dear @realDonaldTrump   PLEASE PROCEED.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/767814619406667776
767820157544570880 2016-08-22 20:26:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mmfa WHY THE FUCK does anyone anywhere give two shakes of a dead rat's ass what Roger Stone has to say about anything?
767805893123579904 2016-08-22 19:29:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis It's a Bill @BillKristol thing, so of course it's all fucked up.
767805598905671680 2016-08-22 19:28:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> Something that should have been done immediately after the Civil War.  It's been a festering boil ever since.https://twitter.com/SgBz/status/767798970475175936
767800576423829504 2016-08-22 19:08:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> Because obviously.  Rich, flaccid, sexist assholes flock together like birds of a feather.https://twitter.com/ZaibatsuNews/status/767799378169868288
767621209148133376 2016-08-22 07:15:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> This needs to be said much more often.https://twitter.com/cdashiell/status/767618280118902784
767620931355156480 2016-08-22 07:14:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @docrocktex26 @NUPEsupreme And so realistic chance of GOVERNING once elected.   Don't forget that.
767496198756323328 2016-08-21 22:58:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is how white nationalism is done.https://twitter.com/thinkprogress/status/767492996904448001
767489034830516226 2016-08-21 22:30:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> If the shit heels in this pic are the "master race", we are well and truly fucked.https://twitter.com/XLNB/status/767488035051057153

767423857380646912 2016-08-21 18:11:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu I am not sure this is possible without a complete remake. GOP has been devoid of new ideas for decades, nothing to build on.
767231267758673920 2016-08-20 05:26:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Evan_McMullin @BillKristol This is jerking off.
767124275853533184 2016-08-20 22:20:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> That is the biggest story the media is missing from the Lochte fiasco.https://twitter.com/owillis/status/767111878304788481
767123847883612160 2016-08-20 22:19:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mattyglesias I like antibiotics too. They keep me healthy.

767060595468214272 2016-08-20 18:07:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> Ryan Lochte is a giant douchebag and defending him is bringing out this guy's inner douchebag.https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/767048787357380608

766291989524574209 2016-08-18 15:13:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm @richardgrant Stupid is definitely a thing.  A very powerful force of nature.
766154817118941184 2016-08-17 06:08:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Brasilmagic You gotta BELIEVE to be a Green.

766129514342551553 2016-08-17 04:28:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @FrankLuntz Do you think there will ever be a national election where the GOP does NOT talk about Reagan every 5 minutes?
766101370000723969 2016-08-17 02:36:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis All the lawyers of the world are taking notice.  #sayswho unstoppable logic.
766099812244566016 2016-08-17 02:30:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> This... is the alternative to HRC?  The Greens cannot be taken seriously if this is the best they can do. https://twitter.com/JKH2/status/766089808028532736
766099451098169344 2016-08-17 02:28:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JKH2 Damn... that is just blunt stupidity.
766091122028322816 2016-08-17 01:55:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JoyAnnReid No, actually that's pretty awesome.
766057981066620928 2016-08-17 23:43:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RiskyLiberal @ezraklein He is hiring the best people if he wants to wage a Don Quixote attack on the "media".  Please proceed, Don...

766046779699638272 2016-08-17 22:59:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> So @realDonaldTrump campaign is now being run solely by MEDIA people.  He doesn't care about votes, this is only about image now.

766005252554317825 2016-08-17 20:14:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NFLfantasy Richard Sherman did.
766000364772466688 2016-08-17 19:54:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Are you appointing yourself head Commisar and Decider of who the "real LIberals" are?
765965976407900160 2016-08-17 17:38:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheDailyEdge @bpolitics He's good, I'll give him that. But can he convince Trump to stop shitting himself in public?
765959074928132096 2016-08-17 17:10:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RoyalHoeliness A not insignificant amount of fatherhood is trolling.  See: jokes, dad
765913890953670657 2016-08-17 14:11:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @politicususa @PoliticusSarah This needed to be debunked?   A new low for journalism.
765734831296696320 2016-08-16 02:19:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rogue_Beaver @RadioFreeTom @DENVERSMKC I can agree with that.
765724828338827264 2016-08-16 01:40:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis It's nice when they do that, gives you a chance to pull the rip cord first.
765723104576319489 2016-08-16 01:33:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @moralesdc @SocialPowerOne1 He looks ridiculous AF and would be hilarious if he weren't so stupid and dangerous.
765712076048244736 2016-08-16 00:49:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rogue_Beaver @RadioFreeTom @DENVERSMKC "Trumpism" is white nationalism and the alt-right. That is not going away any time soon.

765689545056620544 2016-08-16 23:19:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom Perhaps. But europe's struggles with alt-right groups aren't going away on their own. No reason to believe US will differ.

765677396263448576 2016-08-16 22:31:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade It will come out on its own.  Still waiting for your evidence about how the mean ole DNC was so MEAN!
765673622925037568 2016-08-16 22:16:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade You write it off so completely and so assuredly.  Why?
765673433325670400 2016-08-16 22:15:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson @dangainor Best example of beltway pundits ever.
765670289459982336 2016-08-16 22:03:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @theonlyadult This won't end in November. It has been in America since antebellum times. We must fight it endlessly, however.

765667327555739648 2016-08-16 21:51:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Uh, you are the one who actually wrote out ZOMG RUSSIA!, Queen of the caps lock.  So please, chill.
765649250344587264 2016-08-16 20:39:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade How is that different than you shrieking ZOMG RUSSIA! at every turn?  Hint:  It's not different at all.
765649065581305856 2016-08-16 20:38:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade I know. That's why I keep asking you for the smoking gun when it comes to the DNC hacks.  Still waiting.
765645572694958080 2016-08-16 20:25:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade And yours aren't emotional?   K.
765645410069131265 2016-08-16 20:24:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade I could say the same about your ZOMG BERNIE! conspiracy theories.   Still waiting for that smoking gun.
765645142665498624 2016-08-16 20:23:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade There are plenty of security professionals who believe Russia was behind it. Your own article said as much.
765637119658176512 2016-08-16 19:51:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Saying I need to chill is insinuating that I am hysterical and to be disregarded. Don't be obtuse.
765636755827458048 2016-08-16 19:50:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade You have shown nothing but disinterest during our conversation.
765636540642889729 2016-08-16 19:49:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JeffersonObama @PaulStewartII @washingtonpost You mean WHITE NATIONALIST PARTY, worry about your House majority.   FTFY.

765635908309659648 2016-08-16 19:46:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass @RioSlade But not illegal?   All this outrage over bias.   Hacking IS illegal, but who cares because BERNIE!

765634692523577344 2016-08-16 19:41:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Can you have a conversation without the personal attacks? Is that possible for you?
765634396510498816 2016-08-16 19:40:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade You care more about "delegitimization" than actual ILLEGAL hacks.   Amazing.
765630784887660545 2016-08-16 19:26:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Those are things you don't believe.   As in, your opinion. Other professionals believe otherwise.
765630503491731456 2016-08-16 19:25:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass @RioSlade ...and what do your emails show?   Still waiting to see a smoking gun.

765630090914861057 2016-08-16 19:23:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade So you're complaining about LEGAL campaign stuff?

765629376243179521 2016-08-16 19:20:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass @RioSlade I could say the same about your paranoia regarding the demonic DNC.

765624912279064577 2016-08-16 19:02:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Other people who know more than you believe that is the case.  http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/7-things-you-didn-t-know-about-guccifer-2-0-n631166

765624256713531392 2016-08-16 19:00:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @RioSlade Please show me how the DNC broke the elections. I want to see the smoking gun.

765598033903968257 2016-08-16 17:16:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass You are saying that by investigating a known crime against our nation we will leap immediately into WW3. WTF?
765597692844052480 2016-08-16 17:14:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass So in your world I have to shit on the USA in order to be pure enough to criticize Russia?  Is that right?
765595345044647936 2016-08-16 17:05:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass Again, you're going to need to show me where I claimed USA was pure.  I'll wait.
765595210424340480 2016-08-16 17:04:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass Or are you claiming that it is fine American elections are influenced by foreign powers if it helps Bernie?
765595032015417344 2016-08-16 17:04:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass So you DO NOT want a congressional inquiry into the Russian hacks? Is that what you're saying?
765594771339423744 2016-08-16 17:03:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass When did I ever say they should not investigate the DNC?  I'll wait.
765594597774925828 2016-08-16 17:02:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @Kris_Sacrebleu @RioSlade Your own article talks about how several other sources claim it is the Russians. So...?
765594433131646977 2016-08-16 17:01:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @Kris_Sacrebleu @RioSlade "Cybersecurity firms have identified Russian intelligence services as the culprits..."
765593727863664642 2016-08-16 16:59:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass You asked what I thought we should do. I answered honestly.
765593541753970688 2016-08-16 16:58:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass @RioSlade When has the RNC been hacked?  Why is Assange ONLY talking about HRC? That's not a red flag for you?
765593000487505920 2016-08-16 16:56:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass What is happening now is equivalent to Watergate, but perpetrated by a foreign power, and you don't seem to care.
765592883663507458 2016-08-16 16:55:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass Second, we need to seriously investigate ties folks like Trump and Manafort have to these Russian hackers.
765592683687489536 2016-08-16 16:54:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass First we need to acknowledge they are attacking only DEMOCRATS and liberals.
765591554668978176 2016-08-16 16:50:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass And it's obvious you didn't read the article, so...
765591455712718849 2016-08-16 16:50:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass Nothing I guess. According to you these mounting cyber attacks by a foreign power are no biggie.
765591203026841600 2016-08-16 16:49:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass You are the only one talking about bombing people here.
765590861300150272 2016-08-16 16:47:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass @Kris_Sacrebleu Read this article to get an idea of what Russia is doing online these days.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=1
765588488448122880 2016-08-16 16:38:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass Since when is defending the legitimacy of American elections equivalent to a bombing campaign? Hyperbole much?
765586738630668289 2016-08-16 16:31:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass You are saying we should NOT hold Russia accountable for hacking American elections?  K.
765586588197793792 2016-08-16 16:30:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @TheXclass @Kris_Sacrebleu Look, when a foreign power attacks an American election, I have a problem with that. Period.
765586215319932928 2016-08-16 16:29:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass So it was the Dems fault when Watergate happened, right?  Gotcha.
765583095856705536 2016-08-16 16:16:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RioSlade @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheXclass The difference is that these hackers are ONLY hacking democratic politicians. Red flag at all?
765367424950505473 2016-08-15 01:59:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MaxBoot Yeah, I can agree with all of that.
765320235498864640 2016-08-15 22:52:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom Not enough of those "conservatives" around anymore. You are outnumbered by white nationalists in your own party.

765308206922936320 2016-08-15 22:04:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> This is just the beginning. Angry, reactive white nationalism is not going away just because Trump will lose.https://twitter.com/AlterNet/status/765307358641688576

765280215132090368 2016-08-15 20:13:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WSJ @ButchBaydala The VAST majority of Bernie people are voting for HRC.    This is a fact.
765280045178851328 2016-08-15 20:12:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WSJ @ButchBaydala White nationalism is the common thread that draws all Trump supporters together, the only thing that unites them.
765260295434493953 2016-08-15 18:54:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WSJ @ButchBaydala You really think so? How exactly is Trump supposed to win? Be specific.
765251828380372994 2016-08-15 18:20:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mtaibbi You spend time explaining how Fox News shattered objectivity... then say both sides are responsible.  Makes no sense.

765247269197066240 2016-08-15 18:02:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom Racist cranks are always going to show their true colors.
765245209676394496 2016-08-15 17:54:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WSJ @ButchBaydala A huge majority of the population is voting for HRC.  Are you elitist enough to call the majority of America sheep?

765237028245995525 2016-08-15 17:21:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @BillKristol Isn't this goal of politics?

763776990763593729 2016-08-11 16:39:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics Any corroboration for that opinion?
763776881321619458 2016-08-11 16:39:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics Has nothing to do with bad zoning control in Stockton? Hmmm...
763772179343298560 2016-08-11 16:20:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @microsamonomics @eebfg So relaxing zoning would fix this sprawl? Is that what you're claiming?
763771015981703168 2016-08-11 16:16:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics The zoning board interference is wrecking havoc with the magic of the "invisible hand"?
763770764159913985 2016-08-11 16:15:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics Or are you just claiming the zoning board are bogey men wearing black hats?
763770577140064261 2016-08-11 16:14:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics They made their decision based on evidence. Find their evidence.
763769952171982848 2016-08-11 16:12:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @eebfg @microsamonomics I am pretty certain the zoning board would explain why to you.
763769406811844608 2016-08-11 16:09:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @microsamonomics @eebfg With less restrictive zoning sprawl becomes an issue. Bay area becomes Vegas.
763768617418625024 2016-08-11 16:06:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @microsamonomics ZONING is why home prices are 13 times higher than national average? No other variables?
763766443808743424 2016-08-11 15:58:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein This is where my Libertarian friends tell me the "Invisible Hand" will come in and magically fix these kinds of markets.

763106347038613504 2016-08-09 20:15:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You have offered none of those things so far. Just a lot of opinions with no "weight" behind them.
763098867789287424 2016-08-09 19:45:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Theory is where breakthroughs happen. You are grading it as if it is engineering.  It's not. Different goals.

763078391742332928 2016-08-09 18:24:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You are trying to talk with authority regarding things you don't know enough about. Yeah, not persuasive.
763078185768529920 2016-08-09 18:23:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer So that's why you claim that people who actually study theoretical physics... don't know shit about physics?  K.

763058337847975936 2016-08-09 17:04:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer If you are claiming your opinion in legal matters should be worth as much as legal scholars... you are wrong.

763039348182835200 2016-08-09 15:48:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> This needs to be said more. People are being selfish and vindictive with their vote as opposed to constructive.https://twitter.com/fawfulfan/status/762997497086246912
763038913359339520 2016-08-09 15:47:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Well, since you're not a legal scholar of any rank, your opinion is worth just as much as mine.
763035395315511296 2016-08-09 15:33:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @FrankLuntz @realDonaldTrump cannot handle Hillary in a debate.  This is a well known fact.
763035215375720450 2016-08-09 15:32:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> THIS.  Progressives need to stop with the circular firing squads.https://twitter.com/docrocktex26/status/705527925869715456
763034974442233856 2016-08-09 15:31:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 Income tax deduction and repeal of the estate tax should really resonate with middle class voters.
763034076978618368 2016-08-09 15:27:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> In my fantasy world I am reading polling data if Obama were to be running against @realDonaldTrump   It's pretty awesome.
763033724657160192 2016-08-09 15:26:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 For once I don't think he's lying.
763033563662954496 2016-08-09 15:25:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TPM @allegrakirkland Area Man has no idea what hate crime legislation is actually designed to do.
763014226449354752 2016-08-09 14:09:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Again, that's your opinion. Plenty of actual legal scholars disagree with you.
763013975894134784 2016-08-09 14:08:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Those are 2 separate fallacies you committed. Try and keep up.
762884358239682565 2016-08-08 05:32:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer And that's like, totally, your opinion.
762883955041284096 2016-08-08 05:31:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer NO ONE IS SAYING "I INTERPRET BECAUSE FEELS".  These straw men, dude. It's ridiculous.
762881574543069184 2016-08-08 05:21:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Any corroboration of this opinion?
762881327704055809 2016-08-08 05:20:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Are you saying that judicial activism is a problem today?   Examples?
762880936887279617 2016-08-08 05:19:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer It is still "interpretation" whether it is today or 150 years ago.   You realize interpretation is unavoidable?
762879922708684800 2016-08-08 05:15:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer We do both.   And you just explained why you appreciate judicial "interpretation".  Scalia's Originalism.
762879454272073729 2016-08-08 05:13:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No, it's not. Historic gridlock during last 15 years. That's a fact.
762879003711512577 2016-08-08 05:11:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Stop with straw men. Seriously. You're debating in bad faith.
762878752602755072 2016-08-08 05:10:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Current political gridlock makes writing new legislation nearly impossible. Where you have been?
762878394144989186 2016-08-08 05:09:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Married in WA, move to NY, kids in FLA, divorced in OR.  How does one adjudicate that if it's on states?
762877856959442944 2016-08-08 05:07:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer The Constitution was designed to evolve as well. Law should not stand still since time does not.
762877508823810048 2016-08-08 05:05:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer It's not history, it's law. It was meant to evolve.
762876104793128960 2016-08-08 05:00:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No, it's pure bullshit.   Scalia cannot read the minds of men dead for 200+ years.   Voodoo bullshit.
762875800114692096 2016-08-08 04:58:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You cannot interpret a law to "mean anything you want".  Reducto Absurdum.
762875380671799298 2016-08-08 04:57:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No one is asking for ruling by judges, certainly not me.
762874997572370433 2016-08-08 04:55:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> This motherfucker...https://twitter.com/RawStory/status/762868562595721216
762874141510815744 2016-08-08 04:52:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Scalia was famous for this. His "Originalist" bullshit.
762873303929237505 2016-08-08 04:49:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer We would not have gay marriage today without the courts.   We would have illegal voting laws today without courts.
762872594072608768 2016-08-08 04:46:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> Or the background of all those serial harassers at FOX.https://twitter.com/KevinMKruse/status/762845974670696452
762871780612542464 2016-08-08 04:43:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NationalMemo @randyprine Dat horse race tho...
762871273751883778 2016-08-08 04:40:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No one is arguing the courts are perfect. They are needed to protect against against tyranny of majority.
762863654580527104 2016-08-08 04:10:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump He is more accomplished than you will ever be, and smarter as well.
762843074212995072 2016-08-08 02:48:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @dandrezner @nathanTbernard He's an easy B-cup.
762836474656018432 2016-08-08 02:22:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> So, @realDonaldTrump "Reaganomics" part deux is the best you vaunted economics team of Steves could come up with?   L-O-L  Amateur hour.
762829905503453184 2016-08-08 01:56:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You do know that Ike had to order them there to force the fucking GOVERNOR to get out of the way, right?
762828394413166592 2016-08-08 01:50:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer It took the National Guard to enforce school integration.   You weaken the Feds and laws do not get enforced.
762819565172633601 2016-08-08 01:15:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Without Feds Alabama and Mississippi would probably have Jim Crow today.
762819068063731712 2016-08-08 01:13:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer The entirety of the Civil rights struggle has validated need for strong federal government.
762818859711606784 2016-08-08 01:12:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer It also answered question regarding the need for a strong federal government vs states rights.
762794550872018945 2016-08-08 23:36:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jbarro Is it irresponsible to speculate?  It is irresponsible NOT to speculate!
762794352682741760 2016-08-08 23:35:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @brucepknight @ezraklein You can't make everyone love you, but @realDonaldTrump is living proof you can make nearly everyone despise you.
762781531857297408 2016-08-08 22:44:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @BillKristol You cannot even get his name on the ballot in majority of states.  Pissing into the wind.
762777829314433024 2016-08-08 22:29:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kennymack1971 So the bar for Trump is that he's not ACTUALLY screaming obscenities and shitting himself on stage?
762767287912845312 2016-08-08 21:47:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer VRA is perfect example. As soon as it was relaxed, discriminatory legislation passed by GOP.
762766617147166720 2016-08-08 21:45:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Pretty sure the Civil War settled this question for you.
762765185052385281 2016-08-08 21:39:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I thought they established this horrible democracy that you cannot stand?
762764999282405376 2016-08-08 21:38:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer If you believe "being left alone" (whatever that means) is how it will work you are in a fantasy.
762764790460669954 2016-08-08 21:37:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're assuming an awful lot about me.  And you know what they say about assumptions...
762764233159213057 2016-08-08 21:35:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Not just oligarchies, ALL revolutions in general operate this way.  Libertarians would be no different.
762761941404164100 2016-08-08 21:26:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill Really big head?
762761717453512705 2016-08-08 21:25:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @DanaHoule @MattMurph24 And "Trumpism" is not new, it's always been there.   We used to call it straight up Fascism.
762758060590772224 2016-08-08 21:11:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Oligarchy yes, Authoritarian, no.
762737323352006656 2016-08-08 19:48:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're proving my point.   Not always tyranny of the majority.
762736580444299265 2016-08-08 19:45:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @richrygg @DamoclesII That probably is very persuasive in your echo chamber.
762736335350181889 2016-08-08 19:44:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No.   Supreme Court rulings change our nation regularly. Gay marriage, Brown v. Board, etc.
762735866947047424 2016-08-08 19:42:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're using fascism as a pejorative, ignoring it's actual definition.
762735690727641089 2016-08-08 19:42:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer That is one measure, but not the only one, or the one everyone thinks is most important.
762735452579168257 2016-08-08 19:41:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer A lot of our legislation is shaped by judges, so no.
762735112463060992 2016-08-08 19:39:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Lawsonbulk @oneunionmom Unfortunately, yes.
762734508810444800 2016-08-08 19:37:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thinkprogress Weird.   All of it.
762734377939800064 2016-08-08 19:37:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're insulted by what, exactly?
762734237879373824 2016-08-08 19:36:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Sigh... right back to where we started.   If you think HRC is fascist you do not understand the term.
762728586608455684 2016-08-08 19:14:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I'm opposing the Fascist.  Let me guess, you're voting Indie, or Johnson.
762727043834351616 2016-08-08 19:07:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer A lot of people fear the tyranny of the majority more. Strong central government is their only protection
762724350298435584 2016-08-08 18:57:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HillaryClinton @538 @fawfulfan I don't know whether to trust polls at all anymore.  We are in completely new territory here.
762724154848055296 2016-08-08 18:56:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @BillKristol Why this guy?  We have no idea what he is proposing.  Are you that desperate?
762723476583030784 2016-08-08 18:53:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Look, "personal freedom" is not top of everyone's priority list.  You are solipsistic here.
762723257627750400 2016-08-08 18:52:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer To you maybe. The rest of world sees there are worlds of difference.
762723013846405120 2016-08-08 18:51:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Such a dudebro, bro.  #frattyasfuck #dudebro #dude #bro
762722665496842240 2016-08-08 18:50:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer For Libertarians, it absolutely is.
762717974029438976 2016-08-08 18:31:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're obviously a one issue voter, and that's great.  But the rest of the world has differing priorities
762717748812132352 2016-08-08 18:30:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Or Have/Have Not.  Rich/Poor.  Godly/Heathen.  Producer/Moocher.  Patriot/Traitor.  Revolution/Status Quo
762717330849669120 2016-08-08 18:29:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer If that's your only variable, it is not very useful.  No more useful than Liberty/Tyranny.
762714547673104384 2016-08-08 18:18:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan Great, now all we'll hear about is the next "Reagan Revolution".  Wait, that's all we hear about from cons anyways.
762714117740204032 2016-08-08 18:16:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I understand it just fine.  Your model is overly simplistic and confirmation bias. No prob, have fun.
762713728454238208 2016-08-08 18:14:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I don't agree with your surface level modeling.  But I don't call you names when I disagree.
762713395200073728 2016-08-08 18:13:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Personal attacks are all you have when you strawmen stereotypes to try and make a point.  "Communes", LOL
762712428719149058 2016-08-08 18:09:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NaphiSoc @PaulBegala Spray tanner producers as well. They are taxed to death by oppressive Obama regime. Sad!
762712088024231936 2016-08-08 18:08:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I guess I'll take your word for it on communes being a bastion of Liberty.  Like Jonestown, right?
762708652180451328 2016-08-08 17:54:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I have no idea what "Communes" are like. What am I supposed to used as a point of reference? You?
762708461754855424 2016-08-08 17:54:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer What is the difference between a Stormfront rally and the Third Reich?  Just come out and make your point
762706852672966656 2016-08-08 17:47:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Maybe you can tell me about Communes then. Spent a lot of time at them, I presume?
762706648716615680 2016-08-08 17:46:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer I have never been to a Commune. As far as I know they are all independently created. If not, tell me.
762705778214002688 2016-08-08 17:43:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer A "commune" is not very clear. You'll need to get more specific.
762704961465528320 2016-08-08 17:40:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer You're all over the place. What happened to "no difference between nazis and bolsheviks"?
762704148772958208 2016-08-08 17:36:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @azmoderate Trump's war on satire is the most under-reported story of the election.
762703802797400064 2016-08-08 17:35:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer But apparently Tyranny and Liberty are the only variables allowed?  Pretty black and white.
762696993999204352 2016-08-08 17:08:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Pretty black and white reality you inhabit.  For everyone else there are many shades of gray.
762695845129048065 2016-08-08 17:03:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ArthurA_P I was not aware that you could ever get fired for being a police officer. Glad I was wrong.
762695591272992768 2016-08-08 17:02:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer False dichotomy.  And why only 2 choices? Political reality is MUCH more complicated than that.
762694749484560388 2016-08-08 16:59:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Where have I ever made a value judgment? Both extremes are awful. Does not mean they are the same tho.
762693813814964224 2016-08-08 16:55:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MaxBoot @devintstewart Mercantilism! Awesome new idea!
762692986324914182 2016-08-08 16:52:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer It was a lot more than scapegoating. You are oversimplifying. There are real differences.
762690077851983872 2016-08-08 16:40:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @digby56 @KevinMKruse That will play to the RW echo chamber folks.
762689796049297408 2016-08-08 16:39:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bobcesca_go @owillis Yes, eventually Texas will come around.
762689558106349568 2016-08-08 16:38:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jbarro He cannot be serious about this shit.
762689389054918657 2016-08-08 16:38:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer No, it's a lot more than that.    Why do you think National Socialists hated the Bolsheviks so much?
762688236330192898 2016-08-08 16:33:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Them you need to tell Young Gunz.
762686271261028352 2016-08-08 16:25:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm That makes sense in the RW echo chamber.
762686060811853824 2016-08-08 16:25:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer Tell that to the one making the argument that LW is worse than RW.
762685669583884288 2016-08-08 16:23:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rschooley I'm not sure that "yearns" is the operative word here...
762676409613418496 2016-08-08 15:46:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer The nazis ARE fascist, by definition.  They fought to the death against Bolsheviks!
762663162080399361 2016-08-08 14:54:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer So you're trying to say that the Nazis were (are) left wing now?  Uh... okay.
762658172905500673 2016-08-08 14:34:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Sure...
762494428946706432 2016-08-07 03:43:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> So well said.https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/762025588932476928
762480862650699777 2016-08-07 02:49:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> RETRIBUTION is all this hollow man lives for.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/357836961605627907
762424804473380868 2016-08-07 23:06:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis Don't forget racism, xenophobia, Anna sexism.  Those are mandatory.
762396805061423104 2016-08-07 21:15:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ezraklein @voxdotcom Now if someone could just define "Libertarian".
762378925120954368 2016-08-07 20:04:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @politico Maybe because they are at odds with one another?
762378039489466368 2016-08-07 20:01:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jkfecke @belledame222 @fawfulfan YES. Absolutely this. There are too many contrarians out there pushing the "Dixiecrat" line.
762377542523248640 2016-08-07 19:59:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @seanhannity @EricBoehlert They actually believe that the majority of Americans support them.  It's hilarious.
762377206366482432 2016-08-07 19:57:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 The Constitution is just a general rule of thumb kind of thing...
762369740065026048 2016-08-07 19:28:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass Yeah, we already do this, Jill.
762113901211242496 2016-08-06 02:31:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rschooley The jokes write themselves after that pic.  What the fucking fuck.
762113222472183809 2016-08-06 02:28:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @klamarful @Kris_Sacrebleu @HiIIaryClunton @TheRoadbeer Well... he kind of IS the Republican this year. No getting around it.
762090153103855616 2016-08-06 00:57:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> Always the same kind of sleaze with these guys, always.https://twitter.com/stevesilberman/status/762065907799633921
762088639090139136 2016-08-06 00:51:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @klamarful @Kris_Sacrebleu @HiIIaryClunton Your right wingers are never very good at snark or satire.
762085932812029953 2016-08-06 00:40:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TPM Damn that guy is a sack of shit.
762080261492191232 2016-08-06 00:17:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm @POLITICOMag So they are Trump supporters, from the Left.   Brilliant.
762078512685600768 2016-08-06 00:10:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @andrewsweiss @DrJillStein Fuck, this is embarrassing.
762077461689405440 2016-08-06 00:06:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @newtgingrich No, it doesn't raise that question.  At all.
762068744428331008 2016-08-06 23:32:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm I won't disagree with that.
762065439274835970 2016-08-06 23:18:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @StillJohnCA This actually works with them.   Replace "squirrel!" w/ "BENGHAZI!" and you've got it.
762063046982328320 2016-08-06 23:09:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm Sure, but it's pretty obvious that Trump supporters FAR outweigh them in terms of racism.
762059034581053440 2016-08-06 22:53:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm "I'm totally not racist."  - Trump and every Trump supporter
762058704636129280 2016-08-06 22:52:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 @JonLipe Ohhhh, that is a tough one!
762058450083782656 2016-08-06 22:51:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 @MarkHarrisNYC "I have done NOTHING, therefore I am PURITY INCARNATE!"  - Jill Stein
762057858103939073 2016-08-06 22:48:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GravityisRising @KevDGrussing Pretty much says it all right there.
762057324416557056 2016-08-06 22:46:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @klamarful @Kris_Sacrebleu @HiIIaryClunton "Them"?    LOL

762050109366341632 2016-08-06 22:17:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Wisdom_Matters @mininurse Count me in with you as well.

762030556284456960 2016-08-06 21:00:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @thehill @Justice_099 READ THE ARTICLE, dummy.   There's a boulder sized caveat you ignore.
762030325945950208 2016-08-06 20:59:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @AlGiordano @JanetMenke Also, @realmarkcuban would kick his ass.
762029893617979392 2016-08-06 20:57:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @thehill @Justice_099 You are arguing that Krugman supports Trump.  You know that's not the case.   #pedantic
762028293075841024 2016-08-06 20:51:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @thehill @Justice_099 You still have not actually read the article, have you?   Or did you not understand it?
762025587804209152 2016-08-06 20:40:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD That was the entire point of the tweet I was originally responding to.
762025183871770624 2016-08-06 20:38:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @politico @fawfulfan Assange is a conspiracy theory nutter being used as a tool of authoritarians.   And he's a rapist.
762023811407503360 2016-08-06 20:33:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD No modeling.  Look at the horrific deficit spending after Reagan tax cuts.
762023450009489408 2016-08-06 20:32:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @nytimes @thehill @Justice_099 Did you read the article?   Only agrees in COMPARISON to Cruz and Rubio.  Not endorsement.
762014079221239808 2016-08-06 19:54:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @peterdaou @madamecrab @BlueNationRev IT'S NOT A SLOW NEWS DAY.   This is the best you can do?
762013618904850432 2016-08-06 19:52:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GinsburgJobs @PaulStewartII @politicususa Let's hope he continues Trumping it up.
762013409638440960 2016-08-06 19:52:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JYSexton @MattMurph24 24/7 purity purges.  That's all they really care about.
762013157615243265 2016-08-06 19:51:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JJohnsonLaw @JYSexton Shit. Show.
762007766735069185 2016-08-06 19:29:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jjmacnab @RadioFreeTom Saying "Pro-Putin" and "Trump fanatic" is quickly becoming redundant.
762006609119682560 2016-08-06 19:25:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill @Justice_099 @nytimes What's your point with this?
762003322404352000 2016-08-06 19:12:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill So you're an economist? Or you just "know stuff"?
761999208857468928 2016-08-06 18:55:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill Common Sense < Math when it comes to economics.   You must be a supply sider.
761992952637816832 2016-08-06 18:30:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @daveweigel Why would you do this to us?
761992842298339328 2016-08-06 18:30:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom You mean you're not a hipster?  WHO KNEW???
761992450936147970 2016-08-06 18:28:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill You don't do "common sense" or "rule of thumb" economic forecasting in the real world.
761992251731955716 2016-08-06 18:28:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill For starters -http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/what-reagan-didnt-do-2/
761985381571047425 2016-08-06 18:00:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill Except for most economists including at least one Nobel Prize Winner.
761984481762775040 2016-08-06 17:57:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @andreagrimes You need @realDonaldTrump there to regulate those kids.
761984114647969792 2016-08-06 17:55:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 THIS.  Exactly this.
761983743464615936 2016-08-06 17:54:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @DrJillStein So... a plan to achieve any of these fantasies?  <crickets>
761983492108410880 2016-08-06 17:53:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @the_macarthur @AgeJustNumbers @fawfulfan Please repeat this more.
761983244967346176 2016-08-06 17:52:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TeamUSA @POTUS @WhiteHouse They are the real Camelot.
761983003169914880 2016-08-06 17:51:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic Look how far it's been pushed left this year.  It's working.
761982852485357569 2016-08-06 17:50:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic I'll go one better. We should have burned and dismantled ALL of it after Civil War. Continue Sherman's March.
761982608460832768 2016-08-06 17:49:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill Which has been definitively proven to have been a catastrophic failure.
761982439241633792 2016-08-06 17:49:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Your pretend reality is interesting to observe. Thanks for the fantasy.
761982164472700928 2016-08-06 17:47:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @Kris_Sacrebleu @klamarful @Norway_E Yes, all of them.
761982072869105664 2016-08-06 17:47:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD That's all you have left?  Name calling?  Bye Felicia.
761981857541922816 2016-08-06 17:46:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Without central government you have Afghanistan. Warlords and tribalism. Always works like this.
761981650951475200 2016-08-06 17:45:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Political vacuum. Neither left or right, duh.   Nature abhors vacuums. Quickly replaced by warlordism.
761981177838252032 2016-08-06 17:44:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD I bully those on the short bus. Very apropos indeed.
761979247749500928 2016-08-06 17:36:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD I don't think you know what Fascism is, beyond a pejorative to throw around.
761979115318550530 2016-08-06 17:35:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Still not Fascist.  Never will be fascist.
761978922665779200 2016-08-06 17:35:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Again, not Fascist.  Keep going if you like.  Won't make right wing left wing suddenly.
761978776045494273 2016-08-06 17:34:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Still not Fascist.  You're reaching.  Big time.
761978625205768192 2016-08-06 17:33:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Fascism has been and will always be right wing.  Sorry, that's reality.
761978472746975232 2016-08-06 17:33:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer There can be leftist authoritarianism, but that is not Fascism, and will never be.
761978285081276417 2016-08-06 17:32:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @klamarful @Kris_Sacrebleu @rjlobo422 Almost 30 years ago.  Things change. In this case, a lot.
761977998450888704 2016-08-06 17:31:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD What?  This is a stretch that does not fit with reality.
761977833258266624 2016-08-06 17:30:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD No, it has never been limited to just that. Xenophobia, homophobia, race superiority as well.
761974885136551936 2016-08-06 17:19:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer And they are NOT Prog Lib, no matter how much you pretend they are.
761974614494883841 2016-08-06 17:17:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD A progressive lib is BY DEFINITION supporting equality. Racism is a disqualifier.
761974418117578752 2016-08-06 17:17:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Using Progressive Lib and Fascist Auth as pejoratives does not make them synonymous.
761974012817747968 2016-08-06 17:15:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Fascism is right wing.  Sorry, you need to learn your terms.
761973802146201600 2016-08-06 17:14:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Yes. Are you suggesting I would ever support those dictators?
761973633484886016 2016-08-06 17:14:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @smarmyEOD Then it is pretty obvious they are NOT Progressive Dems.
761973059318185984 2016-08-06 17:11:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Which counts for nothing when you run as a Fascist Authoritarian.
761972212362424320 2016-08-06 17:08:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Again, historically.  That's not necessarily true today.   Things have changed A LOT.
761971944602206208 2016-08-06 17:07:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @klamarful @TheRoadbeer All the white nationalists are gathered in GOP right now.
761971784585314304 2016-08-06 17:06:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Dems are not voting for Trump.   That is a bizarre reality you live in.
761971626325921792 2016-08-06 17:06:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @Kris_Sacrebleu @klamarful What?  This is semantics at the highest level.
761971453268942848 2016-08-06 17:05:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheRoadbeer @Kris_Sacrebleu @klamarful And his base is all right winger white nationalists who are GOP.
761971173609484288 2016-08-06 17:04:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer You are comparing Now to an incompatible History.  They are sooooo different.
761970966129881088 2016-08-06 17:03:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer They are part of the white nationalist movement that elected Trump.
761967073639575554 2016-08-06 16:48:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Was.  Again with your history.   In today's world, Lincoln is liberal Dem.
761966677495996417 2016-08-06 16:46:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jbarro Easy there.  Not everyone does the urbana hipster thing.
761965929106317314 2016-08-06 16:43:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer No, they are now Repubs.  Or do you think they support Hillary?
761965731411992577 2016-08-06 16:42:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mattyglesias Needs to be built right next to a Cabela's or a Bass Master's pro shop.
761965175930966016 2016-08-06 16:40:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer You think the Birchers are gone?  Seriously?
761960057336582144 2016-08-06 16:20:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer A lot of them are.  It's become the party of white nationalism.
761959776926314496 2016-08-06 16:19:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Yes, "history". Stop ignoring the present.
761959598307680256 2016-08-06 16:18:19 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer You keep saying "racism", but I believe your definition is different.
761959398625247232 2016-08-06 16:17:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Not any Dems.
761959271089082368 2016-08-06 16:17:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer Oh no, you really believe the modern Dems are racist.  True Believer.  LOL
761945358989598720 2016-08-06 15:21:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu @TheRoadbeer You aware that the only opposition TODAY for the CRA is Rebub, right?
761944842456866817 2016-08-06 15:19:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GStuedler He's against the browns and the immigrants, that's enough.
761762227162492928 2016-08-05 03:14:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 @newtgingrich You just got knocked the fuck out!
761761935322783744 2016-08-05 03:12:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bobcesca_go Damn, he is always wrong about EVERYTHING.  One of those hacks trying to convince us the Tea Party was 1/2 Democrats.

761655478782799872 2016-08-05 20:09:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Heritage @DailySignal You guys are ALWAYS wrong.  Best to conclude th opposite of whatever you say is the truth.
761619071519461376 2016-08-05 17:45:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @kevinrns @gaycivilrights Because of course.
761618333791719424 2016-08-05 17:42:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis WHY is this crank getting interviewed by anyone?
761618146998431744 2016-08-05 17:41:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> I am sad that this did not happen, for personal and selfish (entertainment) reasons. Literal meltdownhttps://twitter.com/buck4itt/status/753033728595755013
761616388574228481 2016-08-05 17:34:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @jonathanjewel @HillaryClinton Clutch.  HRC throws shade like a @POTUS

761584812889026564 2016-08-05 15:29:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TPM @joshtpm Holy hell.  This is amazeballs.
761399363641888768 2016-08-04 03:12:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic You and the racist wingnut cranks believe this.  Everyone else who has not been diving down conspiracist rabbit holes does not.
761389204244836352 2016-08-04 02:31:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattOrtega @deanbarker @o_ema Totes not about race.   Also too, "I am not a racist" and "I have lots of black friends".
761374002610708480 2016-08-04 01:31:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GovMikeHuckabee Ever had elephant to eat, dummy?  Neither have the Trump spawn, but they shot the shit out of one.
761348220295352321 2016-08-04 23:48:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @marstu67 @wgjames @FiveThirtyEight This has been a really good news day.
761347828920688640 2016-08-04 23:47:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mmfa Because they ate racist as fuck.   Is that a trick question or something?
761332827656818689 2016-08-04 22:47:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ESQPolitics @VP This made my day complete.
761321117634002944 2016-08-04 22:01:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 The Trump campaign is like Circus Circus on an ether binge.
761320204550959105 2016-08-04 21:57:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson This is YOUR party, bud.  This is your reality now.  Get used to it.
761318499293667328 2016-08-04 21:50:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @FrankLuntz @billmon1 Fitting analogy, but I think even Hunter would struggle with this year's election.  Impossible to gonzo The Donald.
761316509645885441 2016-08-04 21:42:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @crooksandliars @buffaloon Well, he fucked up the analogy, but good for him for bailing on Trump's ship o' Nazis...
761315723922714624 2016-08-04 21:39:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RoyalHoeliness "Save us, women and minorities, you are our only hope!"  - Modern Leia
761315335144210432 2016-08-04 21:38:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis @abradacabla He's obviously looking DOWN on Trump and smirking.   @POTUS owns @realDonaldTrump
761314557197365248 2016-08-04 21:35:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @sanosbo1 @ReggyN They are going to need a several additional mics to get through this event.
761314231740346368 2016-08-04 21:33:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic They're still racist white nationalists.  All they care about is keeping minorities and women DOWN.
761312701867970562 2016-08-04 21:27:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshgreenman Facts are known to have a liberal bias.
761312379862863872 2016-08-04 21:26:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @CNNPolitics @CNN @AGMcThugabobs They explain in the methodology that some numbers were too small to quantify. How does that = FRAUD?
761310519265406976 2016-08-04 21:19:06 UTC <Cattywammpus> @americablog @buffaloon That would be so awesome to observe in real time.  Like a slow motion train wreck.
761310045145489408 2016-08-04 21:17:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Mysstyblue This is it in a nutshell.  Trump and his supporters cannot deal with strong, independent women.
761309578684346368 2016-08-04 21:15:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @rafalhill @Mysstyblue Holy fuck, if this is even close to accurate...
761309298471219201 2016-08-04 21:14:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @CNNPolitics @CNN @AGMcThugabobs You still have not demonstrated the polls are wrong.   Not even a little bit.   You're just yelling.
761305610918912000 2016-08-04 20:59:36 UTC <Cattywammpus> @POTUS @nileawhile @repjohnlewis Awesome pic in so many ways.
761305460880252930 2016-08-04 20:59:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump HRC was Secretary of State in 1979?  That IS news!
761305075012685824 2016-08-04 20:57:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @CNNPolitics @CNN @AGMcThugabobs Oh honey. You think youth vote? LOL!  Those polls have been awfully accurate these last few cycles.
761304742454702080 2016-08-04 20:56:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom Nice debate with Hugh Hewitt, you described exactly the fears that so many of us are having.
761303857460760576 2016-08-04 20:52:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 We may have reached peak wingnut.
761299519157833728 2016-08-04 20:35:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @skunkwerks16 The snake is eating it's own head now.

761296349497176064 2016-08-04 20:22:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShawnGentry0 @ToConservatives @Angelign @AGMcThugabobs Are you praying over sacred Bernie Relics as you shout this chant?
761295988942254080 2016-08-04 20:21:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @ToConservatives @Angelign @ShawnGentry0 It kind of does or you are just like a 9/11 Truther.
761295748474347520 2016-08-04 20:20:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @Angelign @ShawnGentry0 @ToConservatives So you are claiming that HRC is losing?  Any facts for that assertion?
761293806289367040 2016-08-04 20:12:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @ToConservatives @Angelign @ShawnGentry0 And if this is as damning as you claim... why has Bernie ignored it???
761293703247908864 2016-08-04 20:12:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @ToConservatives @Angelign @ShawnGentry0 I see.  And this will do what, exactly, in a court of law?
761291629739188228 2016-08-04 20:04:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @ToConservatives @Angelign @ShawnGentry0 This... is "proof"?
761289564002529280 2016-08-04 19:55:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ShannonBullins1 @ShawnGentry0 @ToConservatives @Angelign Modern polling is a conspiracy I suppose...?
761289167137497089 2016-08-04 19:54:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Brasilmagic Because that poor person is white and is more concerned about brown people not getting help than anything else.
761288438804910080 2016-08-04 19:51:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm @TheOriginalJL In the short term, yes.  Long term...?
761288198748196864 2016-08-04 19:50:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Angelign @ShannonBullins1 @ShawnGentry0 @ToConservatives Reality would like a word with you...
761288102417604608 2016-08-04 19:50:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @pattonoswalt Nice cage fight starting up here.  Keep talking, Sean...
761287499167563776 2016-08-04 19:47:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SuperckookLarry @AbuJafar51 @Angelign @ShannonBullins1 @NaphiSoc @ToConservatives You've got those windmills now!
761287274780762112 2016-08-04 19:46:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm "Feral Trump Crowd" needs to be a thing. #FeralTrumpCrowd
761287091665842177 2016-08-04 19:46:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @vrunt Damn.  That's so much fail it's impossible to qualify.
761286738786471936 2016-08-04 19:44:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @JM_Ashby @JDiamond1 Political protest done right.
761286495223160832 2016-08-04 19:43:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @skunkwerks16 Yes, this pleases me.
761276964271300608 2016-08-04 19:05:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GravityisRising It's a matter of Faith with them.  Logic and facts do not play well over there.
761264029285310464 2016-08-04 18:14:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TPM Prove it.
761263136976404480 2016-08-04 18:10:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> Because people love to hate on an "uppity" female Dem politician.
761247976870162432 2016-08-04 17:10:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JM_Ashby I know, and you are right.  I just hope they drive Trump's face into the dirt.
761246645837180929 2016-08-04 17:05:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill When your enemies are at each other's throats, the prudent thing to do is quietly step away and root for injuries.
761245945749053440 2016-08-04 17:02:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis Can always count on Alex to bring weapons grade derp.
761244544541208580 2016-08-04 16:56:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JM_Ashby She does need to win them all, tho.  The white nationalism that Trump espouses needs to be totally repudiated.
761242090902659072 2016-08-04 16:47:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JohnJHarwood They musty be tired and in need of a vacation.    Such work ethic.
761241695480520704 2016-08-04 16:45:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Blame the "Establishment" when the revolution failed.   First the Tea Party, now Trump.
761222524134752257 2016-08-04 15:29:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @NFL I didn't realize he was J.J. Watt.
761198964813160449 2016-08-04 13:55:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 They have taken control of a major US political party.
761028351813222400 2016-08-03 02:37:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom @ChloeAngyal It is, unfortunately.  These people have always been here.   Just takes Trump to bring them out.
761027927332925440 2016-08-03 02:36:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @eclecticbrotha @Variety So Clint turns into a mean old racist crank in his golden years.   Sad.
760988014638006273 2016-08-03 23:57:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @Clevelandpro65 Damn.  When Shrub says you can't hack it... you really can't hack it.
760987742842990592 2016-08-03 23:56:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Lindaquackenbus Ah, the mature response.
760973384700178432 2016-08-03 22:59:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @PaulStewartII @igorvolsky White nationalists and the alt-right.  Essentially, nazis.
760971278425567232 2016-08-03 22:51:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @P0Tus True.  His pressers are devolving into bukkake fests.
760944038178533376 2016-08-03 21:02:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KatrinaPierson @deanbarker All these mudbloods everywhere.   What's a white nationalist to do?
760917854438854656 2016-08-03 19:18:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jonathanchait @joshtpm @Cathy_M_Schultz No, but I can imagine The Donald demanding atonement for perceived slights before releasing $$$.
760912552016482304 2016-08-03 18:57:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @RyanLizza @MattMackowiak @Lindaquackenbus Share those drugs.
760912152769146880 2016-08-03 18:56:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @pattonoswalt Who will be playing the part of Lord Humongous?
760908198467428353 2016-08-03 18:40:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WillMcAvoyACN Pouting, that's how America rolls.
760905835929141248 2016-08-03 18:31:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @BenjySarlin Going Rouge.
760895453592363009 2016-08-03 17:49:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @brianbeutler Name recognition has always been one of the main driving forces in his life.
760895164571193345 2016-08-03 17:48:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @BenjySarlin So apparently he's just doing his own thing now.  Wonder if Trump even remembers he is on the ticket.
760894767492321280 2016-08-03 17:47:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JohnJHarwood Translation:  "TOTALLY NOT MY FAULT."
760893980569538560 2016-08-03 17:43:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @WertmanAngela @MattMurph24 That's the only way forward for them in this changing demographic.
760890689194303488 2016-08-03 17:30:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GynoStar Nailed it.
760888964513353728 2016-08-03 17:24:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 Only now he's feeling like a fool.   Is this his "Road to Damascus" moment or is that even possible?
760888128118796288 2016-08-03 17:20:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @LukewSavage The difference between those two phases is negligible.
760882595710193664 2016-08-03 16:58:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @imfabulous13 @Bipartisanism /popcorn  Enjoy it, GOP, this is what you wanted.
760882162174353408 2016-08-03 16:56:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Brasilmagic Oh to be a fly on the wall during that sit down...
760878603726823424 2016-08-03 16:42:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SenSanders @bayonnebernie Hey, your caps lock is on.
760877505335009280 2016-08-03 16:38:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson @JohnJHarwood Translation:  "I stand here while he shits on my head and there is nothing I can do."
760869595037085696 2016-08-03 16:07:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KAmorphous I picked a bad week to stop sniffing glue.
760860906980978689 2016-08-03 15:32:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rschooley That's all there is to it.  Very simple to understand.  Everyone's drunk uncle at Thanksgiving is no different.
760859698996269056 2016-08-03 15:27:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson Your party is 110% rage.  How can you not recognize that?
760859194505342976 2016-08-03 15:25:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Rschooley The other option, of course, is to see if the dial does in fact go past 11.
760840260750221312 2016-08-03 14:10:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump If you're saying there's great unity... there's no unity.
760668610582851585 2016-08-02 02:48:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bannerite @BCAppelbaum Meg Whitman?  Holy shit.  Well, good for her.  Can't quite believe it, but good for her.
760652308526936064 2016-08-02 01:43:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @CrockerDP I'm just here to speak my piece.   Not all vets are angry right wingers.
760650903590273025 2016-08-02 01:38:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @CrockerDP I appreciate the work you do.  We all appreciate it.
760648115950981120 2016-08-02 01:26:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @CrockerDP This is what happens, ladies and gents, when you are all impotent rage and no logic.
760642059757727744 2016-08-02 01:02:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @carrietony35 @fawfulfan That does not fall in line with the white nationalist point of faith that minorities are voting 10 times each.
760637525622792192 2016-08-02 00:44:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JoyAnnReid @JohnJHarwood Dem plan of action:  "Let Trump be Trump"
760631412529651712 2016-08-02 00:20:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @pourmecoffee @kittyFitz50 Maybe rampant white nationalism has something to do with it?  Naw, couldn't be.
760630462725316608 2016-08-02 00:16:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @leonpui_ That is not a credible source.
760625355703017472 2016-08-02 23:56:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter If you shit on gold star families, you deserve the pushback you get.  Do you agree?
760624976743452672 2016-08-02 23:55:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @BourbonGhost Ad Populum much?
760624871621525504 2016-08-02 23:54:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @CharlemagSteak Everyone is deserving of the pushback they have received here.
760624380405690369 2016-08-02 23:52:38 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @Luxomancy He's a one trick pony.
760624258980519936 2016-08-02 23:52:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter If you can't take the criticism for taking shots at gold star families... be quiet.
760624061894438912 2016-08-02 23:51:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter And such is the way if you take shots at them.  Nut up and take the pushback.
760623381276336128 2016-08-02 23:48:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter He's a vet shitting on gold star families and other vets.  Who wins?
760622077007175680 2016-08-02 23:43:29 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter You cannot even see your own hypocrisy, can you?  Cognitive dissonance or just shitty troll?
760621484222009344 2016-08-02 23:41:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee The twit you asked me to read?  Linking to Breitbart?  Was there something I missed?
760621166021124097 2016-08-02 23:39:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @ZhidoBandera Your ignorance is impressive.
760621045397065728 2016-08-02 23:39:23 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter @AlfredTheGreat Slander =/= Criticism
760620756619321344 2016-08-02 23:38:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @KristianHarstad @20committee Oh, shit flinging attack monkeys from Breitbart.    Quelle surprise.
760620168342974464 2016-08-02 23:35:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee @KurtSchlichter Are you shitting on a gold star family?  John said himself that is disgusting behavior.  Sort yourself out.
760619707900628992 2016-08-02 23:34:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jswatz @politicalwire @rickhasen @Green_Footballs These white nationalist shitbirds control the primaries now.  This is life.
760619293818036225 2016-08-02 23:32:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 Vince McMahon was the obvious choice.
760618962958692352 2016-08-02 23:31:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm They are not strong enough to go straight at Trump.  They want to continue to hide in the shadows and wait for it all to go away.
760618638080479232 2016-08-02 23:29:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @20committee You call them "shady" for what reason, exactly?  And you JUST took a dump on a gold star family.  So, you are disgusting.
760607912905453568 2016-08-02 22:47:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JoyAnnReid If there was justice in this world this would occur.

760593200037834752 2016-08-02 21:48:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JohnFugelsang USA leading the way again.  Why couldn't we get some hot porn star like the Italians seem to do from time to time?
760592986094710784 2016-08-02 21:47:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @SXMProgress @MattMurph24 @MSignorile It's pure nihilism now.  Politics by The Joker.  Where the fuck is Batman?

760584348479303680 2016-08-02 21:13:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm And we are still on the decline.   How much lower can we go?

760574203527507968 2016-08-02 20:33:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kennymack1971 @realDonaldTrump It was a total smack down on the world stage.
760558207416700928 2016-08-02 19:29:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump Only to white nationalists.
760558093306466304 2016-08-02 19:29:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @50th_President Stop.  It almost sounds as tho you are opposing him...?
760557885369651200 2016-08-02 19:28:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan The Progressive Purity Pony was not delivered.  Therefore, Obama = FAIL
760548708744179712 2016-08-02 18:51:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bobcesca_go @JoeMon49 @TheTriviaJockey @cunninghammeli1 Because they want REVOLUTION.    Working for incremental change is boring.
760546488036368384 2016-08-02 18:43:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm So... worst possible scenario for a presidential candidate.  Agreed.  And fuck it is frightening.
760537723899826176 2016-08-02 18:08:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EricTrump @imfabulous13 @BRios82 Is that a pic of @realDonaldTrump feeling up his daughter next to a statue of 2 parrots fucking?  WTF?
760537326250364928 2016-08-02 18:06:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @alivitali @JoyAnnReid For once the term "shit show" comes up short when used to try and describe the mania of @realDonaldTrump
760535394848956416 2016-08-02 17:59:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @daveweigel RIght now.  Repubs can read the writing on the wall.  Al Gore was not publicly shitting himself daily as a candidate.
760534817247145984 2016-08-02 17:56:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan If he actually wanted one he could have volunteered.  Or not gotten 5 deferments.
760534336412135424 2016-08-02 17:54:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @politico @asmith83 @fawfulfan The fact that he gladly pockets unearned combat medals as "his"... no one else sees that as a major red flag?
760514946794872832 2016-08-02 16:37:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @AlanKestrel750 @BuhByeGOP @SopanDeb I am having real trouble understanding how someone could even think that, much less say it out loud.

760507373576265728 2016-08-02 16:07:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JJohnsonLaw @laurenarankin Nothing. It's a totally principled, policy driven stand.  Or something.
760506896457474048 2016-08-02 16:05:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Kris_Sacrebleu Nice.  Totes stealing this line.
760497155442212864 2016-08-02 15:27:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @EWErickson I hope you are including yourself in that "YOUR" up there.  The GOP is full of racist cranks that you have enabled for years.

760242340841725952 2016-08-01 22:34:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @jgl61 @fawfulfan He wants 100% of the attention 100% of the time.   Reality TV was no longer enough.

760229483534094336 2016-08-01 21:43:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mattyglesias It is the SEXIST free market view of the matter.  FTFY.
760229206152261632 2016-08-01 21:42:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @OccupyWallStNYC In your mind perhaps, but it works out differently at the voting booth.

760185185551777792 2016-08-01 18:47:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 @CharlieHipHop Strong use of the False Dichotomy fallacy.  Your foreign policy is ridiculous and elementary.

760183863536529410 2016-08-01 18:42:11 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RiskyLiberal But none of them have the balls to stand up and repudiate their insane nominee.
760182476710944768 2016-08-01 18:36:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 What about the materials stolen during the Watergate break in?    The break in was the scandal.  How times have changed.

760181880729632768 2016-08-01 18:34:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 @CharlieHipHop Are you proposing smiling and waving while Putin invades Ukraine and hacks US at will?  Sounds legit.
760181607479152641 2016-08-01 18:33:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 That Russian hackers are trying to sabotage the Dems?  Still waiting for RNC or Trump to get hacked.    Anyone?
760181425790328832 2016-08-01 18:32:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender Ah yes, the Red Scare.  Those were great days in America.  Now you're holding up McCarthyism as the ideal.
760181138585333760 2016-08-01 18:31:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 @CharlieHipHop No you weren't.  Majority of Dems opposed the war.  Stop with the strawmen.

760178435905888257 2016-08-01 18:20:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender America is an open society, that's how all our ancestors got here.  To install a religious test makes it not America.
760172967217160192 2016-08-01 17:58:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 He is reinforcing that he's not willing to make the political sacrifice to follow his actual beliefs.
760171550288949248 2016-08-01 17:53:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender No, a logic fail is accusing me of supporting sharia.  You hysterical autocrats are all the same with your strawmen.
760169274308632577 2016-08-01 17:44:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jonlovett But he's not Tarkin.  More like Needa.
760168862914445312 2016-08-01 17:42:34 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender That's why I compared you to Japanese Internment apologists. You would have been front and center to lock them up.
760165455872921600 2016-08-01 17:29:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender Religious tests for entrance.  Sounds VERY American.
760156910595088386 2016-08-01 16:55:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> @pnehlen @2AmendDefender Religious tests?  That seems American to you? Bet you would have liked Japanese Internment during WW2 as well.
760154392850903040 2016-08-01 16:45:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @bobcesca_go People also watch the Kardashians and WWE by the millions.  We are waiting for @realDonaldTrump to spaz out on TV.
760153474998767617 2016-08-01 16:41:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @2AmendDefender @pnehlen What you and Donald are proposing is illegal according to the Constitution and totally un-American.

759867706401185793 2016-07-31 21:45:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehill He needs to grow a sack.    History remembers.
759844571329114112 2016-07-31 20:13:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump Proving once again that you don't understand the constitution.

759443911404232705 2016-07-30 17:41:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic No, it's showing good judgment since @realDonaldTrump is asking Russia to hack US servers.

759250160295829504 2016-07-29 04:51:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm Everything about him is wrapped up in his juvenile need to be seen as "mas macho".

759150486284963840 2016-07-29 22:15:54 UTC <Cattywammpus> @filthyliberals @mrdaveyd Yes, exactly.  "Trumpism" has even left the mainstream GOP behind. Pure white nationalism at this point.

759083166174814208 2016-07-29 17:48:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 @docrocktex26 We are seeing White Nationalists flock to Trump.  Everyone else to Hillary.  Dem v. GOP not relevant any more.

759079414474780672 2016-07-29 17:33:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @gardencatlady @DrJillStein It's because we progressive liberals do not support you.  Pretty easy to understand.

759063883076079616 2016-07-29 16:31:47 UTC <Cattywammpus> @gardencatlady I agree with you.  But voting Green will fix none of those issues you raise.  It just helps Trump.

759058596579586048 2016-07-29 16:10:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @PrayerBoxAndy @gardencatlady You mention Trump and Hillary as if they are the same candidate.    You need to pay better attention.

758554615952453632 2016-07-27 06:48:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm Been thinking about it all day.

758508764676759553 2016-07-27 03:45:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> You KNOW that @HillaryClinton will be getting on board when @FLOTUS becomes POTUS in 8 years.
758508076353753088 2016-07-27 03:43:12 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mcuban @MattMurph24 @HillaryClinton Or ask him which state her VP is from.

758432462649253888 2016-07-27 22:42:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass Lying about voting?  What are you talking about?
758422719083925504 2016-07-27 22:04:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Who led us into invading Iraq and put TWO new very conservative justices on the SCOTUS.  Elections matter.
758422480360919044 2016-07-27 22:03:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass Oh I see.  You cannot grasp the binary nature of this election.

758421569030856704 2016-07-27 21:59:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President And... the Dems are not retaking the house.  Maybe the senate, but not the house.    I can dream...
758421384565448704 2016-07-27 21:58:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass I'm not talking about speaking.  I'm talking about voting.
758421260573429760 2016-07-27 21:58:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President That would be after he fucks up SCOTUS, destroys NATO, imprisons #BLM members, god knows what else.  Not worth it.
758419446117470209 2016-07-27 21:51:01 UTC <Cattywammpus> @DebsWorldNY Oh fuck yes.  I've been saying this for months now.  The differences will be stark.

758418284022603776 2016-07-27 21:46:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Then you get 4-8 years of Trump as POTUS.  Hahaha...?
758417662909173760 2016-07-27 21:43:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Not for long you won't.
758416988737708032 2016-07-27 21:41:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President Uh... that's not why I will be crying if Trump becomes POTUS.

758414946887532546 2016-07-27 21:33:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass Congratulations on your continued tantrums.
758412457089994752 2016-07-27 21:23:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass Yes, a very mature one.
758411595139592192 2016-07-27 21:19:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> Second this.  It's one very small step from Stormfront. https://twitter.com/AlanKestrel750/status/758392491448172544
758411243531100160 2016-07-27 21:18:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass I also know that a @realDonaldTrump POTUS would feel MUCH WORSE than a Bernie primary loss.
758411093337186308 2016-07-27 21:17:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass I was a Bernie supporter too.  I know what disappointment feels like.
758408355543076864 2016-07-27 21:06:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HillaryClinton @SenSanders @TheXclass Meanwhile you will actively oppose your former candidate.    Sounds legit.

758406442571280385 2016-07-27 20:59:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> The same way you know @DrJillStein will stick with hers.  Or @SenSanders would stick with his.
758404660570882048 2016-07-27 20:52:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TheXclass What does @SenSanders have to say?  Besides SUPPORT @HillaryClinton
758394483104882688 2016-07-27 20:11:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic Lincoln and FDR were fighting for survival of the union if you recall.  History matters.
758391381266042880 2016-07-27 19:59:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic Meanwhile your candidate is still at work and you are ignoring his leadership to continue to throw tantrums.  Grow up.
758391072552734720 2016-07-27 19:58:16 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HAGOODMANAUTHOR @MJanovic @Shoogs18 Oh, good points!  Well argued!

758385175604572161 2016-07-27 19:34:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ToConservatives @saracohennyc So now you are directly attacking your own candidate?  You #BernieOrBust folks cannot be taken seriously.
758384471397666816 2016-07-27 19:32:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MJanovic @HAGOODMANAUTHOR I'm waiting for Bernie Sanders to say he was cheated.
758382017805365248 2016-07-27 19:22:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> Same.  Now all of a sudden Repubs are cool with crawling into bed with Putin.  Reality just went upside down.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/758352955397603328
758381440157356032 2016-07-27 19:20:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm I am wondering the exact same thing.  So far... <crickets>
758373058738479104 2016-07-27 18:46:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> How can the GOP and honest Republicans not speak out about @realDonaldTrump treason today?
758372644777373696 2016-07-27 18:45:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GGordonLiddy must be totally pumped after today's @realDonaldTrump presser.
758370664013148160 2016-07-27 18:37:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> @cassandra17lina @abowersock Meanwhile Trump becomes POTUS so you can continue your poutrage.  Grow up.
758370218548703237 2016-07-27 18:35:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> Agree.  Shit is getting out of hand.  He is getting security briefings for fuck's sake.https://twitter.com/KAmorphous/status/758369840839192576
758369016192708608 2016-07-27 18:30:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> So that's a NO.  She never bombed anyone.  You are just throwing shit at the wall at this point, hoping something sticks.
758368797036195840 2016-07-27 18:29:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JasonMillerinDC Actually, he did EXACTLY that.  Your cognitive dissonance is deafening.
758368234059870208 2016-07-27 18:27:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> Can anyone at the DOJ answer this?  Can anyone in the media ask the DOJ this question?https://twitter.com/Djgrolyos/status/758339428347543552

758365953432297472 2016-07-27 18:18:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Libertea2012 Is that the best you can do, bring up outdated shit?  Meanwhile Trump ascends to POTUS.  Grow up.

758361668686491648 2016-07-27 18:01:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @gardencatlady Wow, you really know nothing about politics.
758361160789876736 2016-07-27 17:59:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> Damn, @DrJillStein is a ridiculous candidate.  Does not understand monetary policy, thinks vaccines are harmful.  http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/07/27/jill_stein_is_not_the_savior_the_left_is_looking_for.html
758359332241092608 2016-07-27 17:52:09 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MattMurph24 @NickTimiraos Finally, he is telling the truth.
758359107363418112 2016-07-27 17:51:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Thx4SharingJerk @ddale8 But Obama is "ignorant".

758358679301201921 2016-07-27 17:49:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> @gardencatlady HRC will not nominate another Scalia.  Stop being obtuse.
758357727210983424 2016-07-27 17:45:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @GravityisRising @SimonMaloy The problem is the White Nationalist party, aka GOP.
758357544225996801 2016-07-27 17:45:02 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RadioFreeTom They think it was a joke.  Adorable.

757270067432173568 2016-07-24 17:43:48 UTC <Cattywammpus> @Brasilmagic Also very creepy.
757269527272894464 2016-07-24 17:41:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> Russia is moving to US if #Trumpisimo wins.
757268665020461056 2016-07-24 17:38:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @debdlund Totally agreed.  Them dragging it out is akin to #Trumpisimo continuing to rag on Cruz's dad.
757263518072647685 2016-07-24 17:17:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @debdlund In a perfect world, yes.  I just want to beat #Trumpisimo and humiliate him in the polls.
757263335180034048 2016-07-24 17:17:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @50th_President That makes me sad.  Corporate Dem > Fascist Autocrat

757262101081534464 2016-07-24 17:12:08 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JohnFugelsang "Saying what he thinks" translates as "spouting racist and sexist shit 24/7".  #sobrave

757261467372576769 2016-07-24 17:09:37 UTC <Cattywammpus> @debdlund I get the frustration, but every vote does count.  Also, we need support after the election in order to govern effectively.

756877442556370945 2016-07-23 15:43:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan A bigger question: do they honestly think the FBI covered up for Clinton's real crimes??? That's a major fucking accusation.
756877105917407233 2016-07-23 15:42:18 UTC <Cattywammpus> @fawfulfan The whole thing is a fucking fantasy, so yes.
756876579666481152 2016-07-23 15:40:13 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 Those angry crackers in Cleveland still want a fight, that's a for sure. A literal fight, not metaphorically.
756876150308089856 2016-07-23 15:38:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> Any #GOP who is shocked at the rise of #Trumpisimo has not paid attention. Listen to talk radio lately? THAT is your party now.
756875631661453314 2016-07-23 15:36:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @ThePlumLineGS @realDonaldTrump Why he did not choose Vince McMahon as his running mate I will never understand.
756875378761707521 2016-07-23 15:35:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump Holy fuck, you are a child.

756578875488940032 2016-07-22 19:57:15 UTC <Cattywammpus> The idea that Trump just came out of nowhere is hilarious. Racism, sexism, homophobia are GOP lynchpins.https://twitter.com/Eaglefly124/status/756576347565203456
756552858754027521 2016-07-22 18:13:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @MeghanMcCain We Libtards kinda knew it was going to turn out this way for y'all. <smh>

756546478873583616 2016-07-22 17:48:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> I would argue that this transformation has been happening for quite some time now.  #Trumpisimo completes it.https://twitter.com/JonInSeattle1/status/756544714879430656
756545475214389252 2016-07-22 17:44:31 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JohnJHarwood @RealBPhil They really want to believe that Cruz is done, but as usual, reality is quite different.
756542998423433216 2016-07-22 17:34:41 UTC <Cattywammpus> Obama IS a racial provocateur to GOP since POTUS is not a white supremacist.https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly/status/756537010840539136
756542003161079808 2016-07-22 17:30:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> So once again, White America has lost its fucking mind. It's up to all the people #Trumpisimo hates to step up and save the country.
756532505486905345 2016-07-22 16:52:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> Tired of the Dem dead enders.  There are real differences between these candidates.  Pick a winner, folks.https://twitter.com/EricWolfson/status/756528487272292352

756333125865574400 2016-07-21 03:40:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @mattyglesias @voxdotcom Policies are for little people.

756329804987719681 2016-07-21 03:27:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 Indeed.   "Watch the money fly out of my asshole, you fucking plebes!"  "USA!" "USA!" "USA!"
756327796343844864 2016-07-21 03:19:33 UTC <Cattywammpus> "Trillions and trillions of dollars... believe me."  This some weapons grade bullshit.
756326674640150528 2016-07-21 03:15:05 UTC <Cattywammpus> Trade war with China just started...

756323758193782785 2016-07-21 03:03:30 UTC <Cattywammpus> #Trumpisimo thanks you for your support.
756323304424681472 2016-07-21 03:01:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> "WE DON'T WANT YOU IN OUR COUNTRY!" We get it #Trumpisimo
756323041383034880 2016-07-21 03:00:39 UTC <Cattywammpus> Hillary is not #Trumpisimo
756322074700812292 2016-07-21 02:56:49 UTC <Cattywammpus> How about protecting our LGBTQ communities from a hateful, violent ideology in this fucking country???

756320121581211648 2016-07-21 02:49:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @JD_Rhoades This needs to be repeated more.
756319846489481216 2016-07-21 02:47:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> @chrislhayes Is the FBI going to comment on this at all?  I mean WTF?
756319523393839104 2016-07-21 02:46:40 UTC <Cattywammpus> So #Trumpisimo is implicating the FBI Director in a conspiracy.  Straight up.

756252528409403394 2016-07-21 22:20:27 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @djamesalicious @Michael_Youhana But the evil that creates the alt-right and fascism in general is not new.
756252279720726529 2016-07-21 22:19:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @HuffPostPol @Getsmart4 He'll make Bush the Lesser look like a workaholic.
756251658988822528 2016-07-21 22:17:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @Michael_Youhana @djamesalicious They may go underground again, but the alt-right never truly goes away.
756251227189448704 2016-07-21 22:15:17 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehuntinghouse @billmon1 I am pretty certain they have no fucking idea what to do in that situation. Clueless, helpless, dickless.
756249503502565376 2016-07-21 22:08:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @thehuntinghouse @billmon1 They are cowards first and foremost. Want to pick up the pieces after a Trump loss instead of fight back.
756249009199669248 2016-07-21 22:06:28 UTC <Cattywammpus> @debdlund @DavidCornDC @ushadrons It's ramping up more and more each election cycle as the demographic in this country shifts.
756247601968582656 2016-07-21 22:00:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @thehuntinghouse Is there another choice?
756247490597236737 2016-07-21 22:00:26 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @Michael_Youhana They will always be around. Finding another Trump to rally around will be difficult tho.
756244575321075712 2016-07-21 21:48:51 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jimpjorps @billmon1 Not gullible, he just doesn't fucking care.  He's in the spotlight, that's what matters.  #AllEyesOnMe
756244200199294978 2016-07-21 21:47:22 UTC <Cattywammpus> @davidphinney @billmon1 He puts that WWE sheen on every gathering. Meanwhile unrepentant fascism moves forward in leaps and bounds.
756243058992099328 2016-07-21 21:42:50 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 And Trump has no fucks to give.  The world is looking at him.  That's all he cares about.
756242747552505856 2016-07-21 21:41:35 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @stanleyrogouski Exactly. They truly believe their "message" (truth!) is being held back by liberal media.
756242407868334080 2016-07-21 21:40:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @Michael_Youhana Trump supporters  always been there. They were slave holders, they lynched people, they loved Wallace & McCarthy
756237813708914690 2016-07-21 21:21:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 American politics is always about race, but the alt-right is now leading the GOP. This is new and dangerous territory.
756237297784393729 2016-07-21 21:19:56 UTC <Cattywammpus> @RoyalHoeliness Being "anti-PC" is code for wanting to say all the racist and sexist shit in your head out loud w/no push back.
756236285568745473 2016-07-21 21:15:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> @debdlund RNC is allowing it, @realDonaldTrump is PROMOTING it. Subtle but important difference.
756234885614931970 2016-07-21 21:10:21 UTC <Cattywammpus> Rape... what can you do?  <shrugs> Oh wait! Blame women! #brilliant #ImWithHerhttps://twitter.com/nhdogmom/status/756219574123687936

756233641123016704 2016-07-21 21:05:24 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 "Lynch mobs forming to the left... please stay in line, everyone will get a turn..."
756232023056928768 2016-07-21 20:58:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> @DavidCornDC @debdlund How long until these Lynch mobs actually get violent?

756230010868948992 2016-07-21 20:50:59 UTC <Cattywammpus> I have heard of Roger Ailes for years, but have never really seem pictures of him before today.  He looks exactly how I thought he would.
756208053213474816 2016-07-21 19:23:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm Of course they would.  Triple H, the Undertaker, and Stone Cold Steve Austin would all be there.
756207395244617734 2016-07-21 19:21:07 UTC <Cattywammpus> @andreagrimes @ChuckRabin So he fucked up more than we originally thought?
756207155296899072 2016-07-21 19:20:10 UTC <Cattywammpus> what?
756205592834826241 2016-07-21 19:13:57 UTC <Cattywammpus> I'd go further.  Trump and the alt-right want wars.  Authoritarians NEED an enemy, or they create one.https://twitter.com/Lib_Librarian/status/756201165717594112
756205159890288640 2016-07-21 19:12:14 UTC <Cattywammpus> @billmon1 @chrislhayes It's more red meat for the alt-right, WWE crowd in attendance.
756204538005114880 2016-07-21 19:09:46 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm Who?
756199237365313536 2016-07-21 18:48:42 UTC <Cattywammpus> THIS.  A 1000 times this.  It's not a convention, it's a hate-fest.https://twitter.com/Salon/status/756194305144946688
756198988580204545 2016-07-21 18:47:43 UTC <Cattywammpus> @owillis @mkraju No one is listening to Yertle the Turtle.  Trump is on overdrive and has pegged the gas pedal.  Anything goes tonight.
756190019467907073 2016-07-21 18:12:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joanwalsh Because the hate for HRC is stringer than the love for NATO.
756189602218508288 2016-07-21 18:10:25 UTC <Cattywammpus> @paulkrugman @ezraklein He gets 45% of the vote simply by hating on HRC.  Who you HATE is the defining characteristic of USA politics.
756159888661676032 2016-07-21 16:12:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> So the GOP is now officially split.  Question remains, do repubs start lining up behind Cruz NOW or will they wait until 2020?
756158813246328832 2016-07-21 16:08:04 UTC <Cattywammpus> @chp3120 @HuffPostPol 2 factions within the GOP now.
756158515593383937 2016-07-21 16:06:53 UTC <Cattywammpus> @skunkwerks16 WWE style drama.
756156543440072704 2016-07-21 15:59:03 UTC <Cattywammpus> @solovyei @Kris_Sacrebleu @mmfa This is weakening NATO to appease Putin.  @realDonaldTrump is a Putin fan boi.
756152750212210688 2016-07-21 15:43:58 UTC <Cattywammpus> Why @realDonaldTrump did not hire @VinceMcMahon to be his campaign manager I will never understand.
756152085121413120 2016-07-21 15:41:20 UTC <Cattywammpus> @realDonaldTrump @mcuban This is spot on.  Trumpisimo could give 2 shakes of a dead rat's ass about doing any kind of work whatsoever.
756150179091275777 2016-07-21 15:33:45 UTC <Cattywammpus> @jonlovett The doughy pant load gets it right every once in a while.
756149165936173056 2016-07-21 15:29:44 UTC <Cattywammpus> @TurnOnTheJets Since when did Chachi get upgraded to b-list?
756002769329192960 2016-07-20 05:48:00 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm @DannyMayes HIGH probability of some memorable lines from Trumpisimo tomorrow.  #popcorn
755999968217800704 2016-07-20 05:36:52 UTC <Cattywammpus> @joshtpm I guess the only thing left to happen is if someone actually lost control of their bowels and then fell off the stage.
755986640800145408 2016-07-20 04:43:55 UTC <Cattywammpus> Ted Cruz needs to keep going.  #goTedgohttps://twitter.com/rudepundit/status/755986284863037440

755981010139873280 2016-07-20 04:21:32 UTC <Cattywammpus> She does this after every radio show.  She just forgot she was on TV.  #RNCinCLEhttps://twitter.com/Slate/status/755979727375069184
