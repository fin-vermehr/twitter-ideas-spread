971761623705751552 2018-03-08 14:56:40 UTC <ewhalley> In the last two years, 1/5 obituaries were about women. Great way to celebrate! Happy women's day, @wmcdonaldnyt . Just wish those old ladies could have done MORE amirite
971759802081832961 2018-03-08 14:49:25 UTC <ewhalley> spend less time defending, more time questioning your social construction of success. "So why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? The larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time." -@wmcdonaldnyt
971759144129716224 2018-03-08 14:46:49 UTC <ewhalley> Wow. @wmcdonaldnyt's take: obituaries are of white men, then & now, because women/POC haven't done much. What a limited (white, male) understanding of how one's position constructs their subjective definition of success. @nytimes From the Death Deskhttps://nyti.ms/2G502RV
