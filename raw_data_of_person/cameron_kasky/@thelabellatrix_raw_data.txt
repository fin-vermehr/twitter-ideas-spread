926434788797571072 2017-11-03 13:04:00 UTC <thelabellatrix> @JoyAnnReid Thank you Joy for always bringing the facts and logic! The relitigating of 2016 by Ds and the infighting has to stop! So not helping. Unite!
923210346877288450 2017-10-25 15:31:13 UTC <thelabellatrix> @TheRickWilson I think Rick has earned more characters from Twitter *unlocks 280 characters*

878000078018953216 2017-06-22 21:21:45 UTC <thelabellatrix> @LisPower1 Agreed. But suggestion: stop covering his dumb antics and stick to the bigger stories, i.e. secret healthcare bills and russia
