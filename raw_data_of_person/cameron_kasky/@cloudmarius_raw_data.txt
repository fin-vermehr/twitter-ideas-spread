972383793926623232 2018-03-10 08:08:57 UTC <cloudmarius> Like every time I see someone I know enter a relationship, or even see a couple, I'm just like how???
972382951899004929 2018-03-10 08:05:36 UTC <cloudmarius> It's because I literally can't figure it out. The entire idea of dating just baffles me

951573081662910464 2018-01-11 21:54:36 UTC <cloudmarius> Somebody's always touching shit in this house smh
951572260225249280 2018-01-11 21:51:20 UTC <cloudmarius> Imma try to take my mind off the fact that i can't fucking see by playing video games. It's only fair.
951570595589828610 2018-01-11 21:44:43 UTC <cloudmarius> I just wanna know one thing...where the fuck are my glasses?
950599756392394753 2018-01-08 05:26:57 UTC <cloudmarius> I will forever argue that this is the best electronic album of all time.https://twitter.com/theneedledrop/status/950391526353448961
950599252069273600 2018-01-08 05:24:57 UTC <cloudmarius> The point is, watching sports is hell's time intensive. But best believe I will be watching the NBA Playoffs. This has been a suiramed thread.
950599244221730818 2018-01-08 05:24:55 UTC <cloudmarius> Shit, I could watch WWE for the length of a football game and be caught up on all the main roster storylines.
950599240329383936 2018-01-08 05:24:54 UTC <cloudmarius> It's just that I'm not willing to invest my time into watching 4-5 hours of a football game when I could be writing poems, making/listening to music, or gaming in the same time frame.
950599236969693184 2018-01-08 05:24:54 UTC <cloudmarius> It's not even that I've lost interest, bc I follow along with my teams and shit, and I still am ecstatic when they win and disappointed when they lose.
950599233446535168 2018-01-08 05:24:53 UTC <cloudmarius> I'm not watching the #nationalchampionship and I'm taking this as a sign of my waning sports fandom.
