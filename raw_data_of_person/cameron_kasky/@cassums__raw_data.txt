958974460471623680 2018-02-01 08:05:02 UTC <cassums_> @DarkPrevails I mean I understand you can reclaim a flag and change what it means to you or others but you can't erase the history behind it. Maybe not a Nazi flag, that's most likely going to stay a hateful symbol....
958973911063867392 2018-02-01 08:02:51 UTC <cassums_> @DarkPrevails @SecondClancy Agreed, although a lot of those that I've personally encountered who do like the flag are usually racist. Few that aren't racist are pretty chill and acknowledge the history but don't use it as a racist symbol and just a "southern pride" thing.
958973137936248832 2018-01-31 07:59:47 UTC <cassums_> @DarkPrevails I accidentally hit no. I'm sorry but I think its racist. Theres a LOT of racist flags with shitty history behind them.

928422839526375424 2017-11-08 00:43:48 UTC <cassums_> @JaclynGlenn @xxxmiccyxxx Let her vent. This is her support system right now, all of those who care are here for here to lean on and I'd much rather her do this than go and hurt herself or something. Let the girl get it all out. She's hurting.

913279552775794690 2017-09-27 05:49:47 UTC <cassums_> @joss @WilsonFrontier @seattle_23 I'd say so. Seeing LGBT representation matters & sex should be a normal topic. It's intimate, but that doesn't ban it from being discussed.

826300032454324224 2017-01-30 05:24:14 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas not included? He skipped ones that have because he has businesses there.also freedom of the press
826299830221709312 2017-01-30 05:23:26 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas first off, if it were really a nation security thing why are countries that have sent terrorists
826292954998329345 2017-01-30 04:56:06 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas their religion.
826292918117765121 2017-01-30 04:55:58 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas it's unconstitutional and unamerican to deny LEGAL immigrants from entering the USA based on-
826292689096151041 2017-01-30 04:55:03 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas POTUS has been in 10 days and had 13 executive orders places and has fucked up beyond belief
826275136454004736 2017-01-30 03:45:18 UTC <cassums_> @jamespickard40 @espinozitah @TheFoundingSon nice troll account as well. suits your rotten and bloated personality.
826273057887039488 2017-01-30 03:37:03 UTC <cassums_> YUP. Lesbian here and I do NOT support Trump the tyrant and nor will I ever.
826272652176216066 2017-01-30 03:35:26 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas also, it's a dictator move to remove her after she "disobeys" or "disagrees", that's her job.
826272397141479424 2017-01-30 03:34:25 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas the president, but they're supposed to serve us. if we don't have them advocating then who does?
826262740775821312 2017-01-30 02:56:03 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy @NilVeritas exactly, Trump cares more about obeying him & being loyal than the rights of his country. Scary.
826262371354046464 2017-01-30 02:54:35 UTC <cassums_> @hipsterocracy thats terrifying. This country is becoming a fascist country FAST. We need to continue to say no
826261581566664704 2017-01-30 02:51:26 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs especially when you're in debt like the USA is.
826261518043930624 2017-01-30 02:51:11 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs no, but it's the same concept. If it's too expensive you shouldn't do it.
826254379745304576 2017-01-30 02:22:49 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs it would cost 200K
826254303115431941 2017-01-30 02:22:31 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs how so? my school years ago couldn't even build a wall around it because
826253783524978689 2017-01-30 02:20:27 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs the more massive then the more border patrol needed and the more jobs created.
826253668995395584 2017-01-30 02:20:00 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs if it's too massive to monitor don't you think it's too massive for a wall?
826253509263646720 2017-01-30 02:19:22 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs no of course not a lot of stubborn people but a few trying is better than none.
826253273996759040 2017-01-30 02:18:26 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs job and stopping that stuff. It's cheaper and more logical than a wall imo
826253180002447360 2017-01-30 02:18:03 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs it would also not flow as much if we had border patrol down there doing their
826252968554934272 2017-01-30 02:17:13 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs to appeal to the country, if we all want the same thing it'll be easier.
826252892734517248 2017-01-30 02:16:55 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs which again, is why we as citizens need to come together. The president wants
826252681173884929 2017-01-30 02:16:04 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs them pay for it.
826252646684073984 2017-01-30 02:15:56 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs Mexico isn't crying about a wall, they're upset he's trying to illegal make-
826252517231128576 2017-01-30 02:15:25 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs if we work together and stand united we could accomplish a lot
826252444275339264 2017-01-30 02:15:08 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs them continue to elect republicans or democrats who still support it.
826252310422523904 2017-01-30 02:14:36 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs I think the wall is just a middle man that can be skipped to make real progress
826252145208856576 2017-01-30 02:13:57 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs tunnels and be able to stop "illegals" from coming through to the USA.
826252055090061312 2017-01-30 02:13:35 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs spend the money on creating jobs at the border and have them look for these
826251965139087360 2017-01-30 02:13:14 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs which is exactly why we should have more border control, not a wall.
826239179491119105 2017-01-30 01:22:25 UTC <cassums_> @realDonaldTrump @DragKingBuck @ticket_joe @Kimryn actually, you're very gorgeous. Don't listen to the petty attacks. <3

826237327273897984 2017-01-30 01:15:04 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @abusivemother @jamespickard40 a ridiculous wall.
826237268713091072 2017-01-30 01:14:50 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @abusivemother @jamespickard40 I just think maybe hiring more border patrol would help more and cost less than-
826236949711065089 2017-01-30 01:13:34 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @abusivemother @jamespickard40 it would take a couple decades before we ever recovered from that wall
826236790730170368 2017-01-30 01:12:56 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @abusivemother @jamespickard40 actually, realistically, it will only save a few million maybe brink a billion

826236370033143808 2017-01-30 01:11:16 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs a wall won't stop that.
826236329537138688 2017-01-30 01:11:06 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs dig out tunnels to smuggle people, drugs, weapons, etc into our country.
826236219168169984 2017-01-30 01:10:40 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @CensoredByLibs they get a few hundred men with digging equipment and boards to add support and

826159044788264960 2017-01-30 20:04:00 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @iratemoney are you going to say anything useful and answer my questions or just waste time?
826158836700491776 2017-01-30 20:03:10 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @iratemoney nice observation but what about my legit questions and concerns?
826158204816027649 2017-01-30 20:00:39 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 @iratemoney I had no idea that locking a door and spending billions on a wall were equal wowpic.twitter.com/dNz6d5jyEz

826157291598606338 2017-01-30 19:57:02 UTC <cassums_> @nicbackus @EzoszResyek I'd say I was pretty chill when replying, no need to get defensive.

826147863927287808 2017-01-30 19:19:34 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 I mean I guess I just think a wall will put it so far in debt we'll never be able to help vets
826147648834990083 2017-01-30 19:18:43 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 ... But how will you get around a river? Go over it? Leave holes for "illegals" to crawl under?
826144451802210304 2017-01-30 19:06:00 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 how will you get through the rivers? They will wear down a wall and you can't really stop them
826144220603838466 2017-01-30 19:05:05 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 ... You've already said that...
826144167424258048 2017-01-30 19:04:53 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 oh yes, I'm questioning the other guy.
826143926562156545 2017-01-30 19:03:55 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 seal the ends of known tunnels and keep eyes on them with live security cameras.
826143732621733888 2017-01-30 19:03:09 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 more border patrol, maybe some drones to keep a birds eye view. you know create some jobs
826142233460043776 2017-01-30 18:57:12 UTC <cassums_> @Satanqueen_666 we can agree on that, both were trash I just don't think he was the better choice. imagine day 10 of Clinton presidency.
826141846631968768 2017-01-30 18:55:39 UTC <cassums_> @Satanqueen_666 or spying on nude/almost nude contestants on your shows because you're the big boss man and have to be respected :)
826141487255547904 2017-01-30 18:54:14 UTC <cassums_> @Satanqueen_666 male privilege oh god you know, male privilege would be something like sexually harassing someone then becoming president :)
826141177535623168 2017-01-30 18:53:00 UTC <cassums_> @Satanqueen_666 hm what job are you working that you can't spare to buy a $5 drink to help you work more productively?
826140862555885569 2017-01-30 18:51:45 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 that doesn't answer the wildlife question, the vets, the rivers, or the tunnels underground
826140395016908800 2017-01-30 18:49:53 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 ... like?
826140272350285824 2017-01-30 18:49:24 UTC <cassums_> @Satanqueen_666 it's called... working for money. wow who would've known that working could get you Starbucks WOW!?!.!??.!!pic.twitter.com/XNw6ZhCZDH

826138608121712640 2017-01-30 18:42:47 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 I have so many logical questions and no answers from anyone so far just "okay snowflake"
826138434427187200 2017-01-30 18:42:06 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 or the wildlife that lives along the border? what happens to them?
826138167518507008 2017-01-30 18:41:02 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 and what happens when you guys reach the several rivers that run through the border?
826138012018888704 2017-01-30 18:40:25 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 also, what about the tunnels? there's thousands on thousands. maybe fill those up first?
826137310227951617 2017-01-30 18:37:38 UTC <cassums_> @TheFoundingSon @jamespickard40 the wall will take years to build, do you know how many vets will die in that time?

824375367687237632 2017-01-25 21:56:18 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz i don't think you've ever actually researched this, those places are crowded and dangerous and broke.
824374514117009409 2017-01-25 21:52:54 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz again, you're not making sense.
824374161644544000 2017-01-25 21:51:30 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz I replied.
824374056644284416 2017-01-25 21:51:05 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz people are homeless for various reasons most consist of everything being so expensive and jobs not paying enough
824373860837363712 2017-01-25 21:50:19 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz no I took it as you grasping at straws. You have no argument, everything you're saying is redundant and irrelevant
824373658852356096 2017-01-25 21:49:31 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz no they pouted and stopped Obama from making any progress, although he still did his best.
824373295202000896 2017-01-25 21:48:04 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz the FBI? You mean the idiots who let a terrorist who had been investigated two times buy a gun and shoot a club up?
824372941378891776 2017-01-25 21:46:39 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz they did what? Pout? Bitch on Facebook and Twitter? You're really starting to sound desperate and triggered.
824372689452163073 2017-01-25 21:45:39 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz OOOH I insulted your intelligence so now you go for stupid attacks instead of backed facts or disagreements.pic.twitter.com/fJz3ANtpBW
824372207082106880 2017-01-25 21:43:44 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz this country has always been divided it's just boiling over and some actually want to do something about it
824372029658796032 2017-01-25 21:43:02 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz ah yes and discrediting or invalidating people's beliefs and passions isn't divisive right? putting them down isnt?
824371744412618752 2017-01-25 21:41:54 UTC <cassums_> @lauriecrosswell @TruePatriotHere also why the terrorist picture?
824371686015324160 2017-01-25 21:41:40 UTC <cassums_> @lauriecrosswell @TruePatriotHere illegal alien violence. it's pretty obvious who you're referring to and where's my source?
824371439956418560 2017-01-25 21:40:42 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz websites and media :) you can be properly educated
824371357278302208 2017-01-25 21:40:22 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz good things is Google is switching from most popular being first to most credible to filter out biased conservative
824370894134923264 2017-01-25 21:38:31 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz you only see what the media feeds you and it's quite pathetic. do some research.
824370790237761536 2017-01-25 21:38:07 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz destructive. What he's doing is wrong and people are passionate, something you've probably never felt
824370626219569152 2017-01-25 21:37:28 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz you insulted the homeless and made yourself look stupid. Only a small part of those who oppose Trump's actions are-
824370344320339968 2017-01-25 21:36:20 UTC <cassums_> @TheAmazingBriz BUT if I'm an annoyance then good because you're easy to trigger.pic.twitter.com/Y8cliYvr1o

824364845726175232 2017-01-25 21:14:29 UTC <cassums_> @lauriecrosswell @TruePatriotHere sources of this racist statement? What about the white crimes that are committed daily? Shootings? Huh?
824019790255702016 2017-01-24 22:23:22 UTC <cassums_> Goodbye to these Trump's too. Already feel happier.pic.twitter.com/275a4B8P2P

823733878363856897 2017-01-23 03:27:15 UTC <cassums_> @yungbiryanii and aside from that I grew up in an abusive household it's easy as hell to spot other ones. his is one of them.
823733389559668736 2017-01-23 03:25:18 UTC <cassums_> @yungbiryanii you guys have all seen how abusive he is just in public to people. imagine at home. there's plenty to pick at her for too.
823733083333459968 2017-01-23 03:24:05 UTC <cassums_> @yungbiryanii she's quite visible miserable. having freedom at home or luxury doesn't deflect from the abuse, it's redundant to mention
823732946221690881 2017-01-23 03:23:33 UTC <cassums_> @yungbiryanii you ignored my point and it's quite frustrating. have you seen videos and photos from as far back as when they first dated?
823732594277634049 2017-01-23 03:22:09 UTC <cassums_> @lotuseatur y'all don't realize that if she is abused in any way she's not allowed to think for herself or have opinions other than Donald's
823731852796006400 2017-01-23 03:19:12 UTC <cassums_> @yungbiryanii yes because every abused women who isn't allowed to think for herself and conditioned not to, has done what she's doing.
823721529410097157 2017-01-23 02:38:11 UTC <cassums_> @whattheFELK and you're completely right about the sexual assault/harassment thing which is why I didn't touch that topic
823720154122964993 2017-01-23 02:32:43 UTC <cassums_> @whattheFELK deserve hate or being picked on/joked about.
823719998875013123 2017-01-23 02:32:06 UTC <cassums_> @whattheFELK picking on Baron. No she should not lose her job but we need to make clear that children, from any president of person, don't -
823719837557919744 2017-01-23 02:31:27 UTC <cassums_> @whattheFELK the children SHOULD be off limits but we all know that the Obama's stunning daughters weren't, I don't think that justifies-
823718871697801217 2017-01-23 02:27:37 UTC <cassums_> @whattheFELK alright, hear me out please. I don't like Trump or most of his family BUT from what I've seen of Baron, he's a good kid. -
822970575010136068 2017-01-21 00:54:09 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe @Zanzibarry punishment, electro shock therapy, mental/verbal abuse, and meds.
822970332642308097 2017-01-21 00:53:12 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe @Zanzibarry yeah I wish. More like forced sex with opposite sex, porno flicks, physical
822926616930095104 2017-01-21 21:59:29 UTC <cassums_> @RightWingPepe @Liberal_Rags @charliekirk11 was still homophobic in my opinion.
822926565122052096 2017-01-21 21:59:17 UTC <cassums_> @RightWingPepe @Liberal_Rags @charliekirk11 all my previous statements are based off a misreading, aside from the dildo waving freak that
822924655841284096 2017-01-21 21:51:41 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe maybe you should think before trying to delete tweets and play innocent.
822924380627795968 2017-01-21 21:50:36 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe yes you did. Now you're an even bigger liar.pic.twitter.com/mtNHNZTQYM
822923183246315520 2017-01-21 21:45:50 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe no no I claimed you're not gay because you said gay thoughts are okay just don't act on it
822922990132154368 2017-01-21 21:45:04 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe that comment was homophobic. nothing wrong with gays waving dildos in San Fran.
822922869747257348 2017-01-21 21:44:35 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe that didn't make sense at all yet again. Who said anything about San Fran or dildos?
822922718689402880 2017-01-21 21:43:59 UTC <cassums_> @MarkDice @marybuchanan_ak exactly what I was thinking. people like this make people like us stand up.
822917090428358656 2017-01-21 21:21:38 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe LOL you lied about being homosexual to push a false agenda, that's pathetic.
822916797087170560 2017-01-21 21:20:28 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe if you wanted privacy you shouldnt have replied publicly as much my business as it is yours
822916392022253569 2017-01-21 21:18:51 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe that made no sense AT ALL. You said you were gay? No it's a bad thing?
822909310963286016 2017-01-21 20:50:43 UTC <cassums_> @Corporatocrazy not just that but I thought you guys hated people being "PC" and getting offended, Madonna wasn't PC and y'all got offended.

822906536913575936 2017-01-21 20:39:41 UTC <cassums_> @GOP @charliekirk11 @Liberal_Rags @RightWingPepe coming from another homosexual: believing in gay conversation therapy IS homophobic.
821906212715307008 2017-01-18 02:24:46 UTC <cassums_> I'm invisible, nobody would notice if I'm gone. I have been gone and they never noticed.
821905973459632129 2017-01-18 02:23:49 UTC <cassums_> I could openly say I'm going to kill myself and nobody would care. It would be silence, just like I always get.

700775138372009988 2016-02-19 20:13:07 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion Tiger admitted to it, and again those weren't rape or abuse.

700739059723816961 2016-02-19 17:49:45 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion walking backwards
700738987552473089 2016-02-19 17:49:28 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion they've worked so hard to get where they are today & not taking allegations seriously seems to be like
700738746593865728 2016-02-19 17:48:30 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion I can see that, but I feel that just letting this guy off the hook sets rape/abuse victims a bad example

700737987122847748 2016-02-19 17:45:29 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion and let's not forget Demi spoke out a long time ago about him saying harmful things. Also MJ spoke out
700737682759032832 2016-02-19 17:44:17 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion out of a contract. Also it's easier for some company's but I guess not Sony.
700737564307644419 2016-02-19 17:43:49 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion I could see how its suspicious but I just don't think I girl with this much to lose would lie just to get

700732890213064704 2016-02-19 17:25:14 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion if she wanted out of a contract she would have done it right and probably won.
700732623664975872 2016-02-19 17:24:11 UTC <cassums_> @LegendaryOrNah @MusicsRebellion advised to lie about being raped and abused? There's other ways to leave a contract. I think she'd do those
