964150920975212545 2018-02-15 14:54:27 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @Reuters What exactly are you hoping to accomplish by printing this man's face as large as possible? Give the shooter absolutely no attention, let the justice system do what needs to be done and watch him fade into darkness.

959827302514388993 2018-02-03 16:33:56 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @realDonaldTrump I'm really gonna need you to explain the logic behind putting your own name in quotations and nothing else.
959568780396564480 2018-02-02 23:26:39 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @realDonaldTrump Okay but have you ever seriously considered self-immolation though?
957041361219473408 2018-01-26 00:03:36 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> Is there a way to have my twitter feed ACTUALLY display chronologically or has that technology not made it to 2018 yet
873963566059192320 2017-06-11 18:02:06 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @realDonaldTrump Is this a new thing where you put your most ridiculous claims in quotes so that Angry Spice can walk it back more easily?

862351229669842946 2017-05-10 16:58:49 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> It's almost like he doesn't actually have any beliefs of his own and only ever acts out of self preservation. Oh wait no shit, we knew that.https://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/862066910120247298
862348642816057349 2017-05-10 16:48:32 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> On second thought maybe it was a bad idea to give a corrupt billionaire with the brain of a toddler the most powerful seat in the world.
862346326310367233 2017-05-10 16:39:20 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @CNN @realDonaldTrump You really are getting desparate aren't you. You even made sure to use hyphens correctly. Good job!

856307104172449792 2017-04-23 00:41:37 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure your previous wives can attest to the value of your "commitment," to a cause.

831912371354529795 2017-02-15 17:05:40 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @realDonaldTrump Remember a few months ago when you literally begged Russian hackers to interfere in our politics? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
831911976246837248 2017-02-15 17:04:05 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> Don't underestimate the energy boost that comes with telling a sitting president to go fuck himself on the internet. Give it shot some time.
824643541716598784 2017-01-26 15:41:56 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @POTUS I'll try, lets see... Climate change, Michael Bay fims, Nationalism, Rick Perry heading the dept of Energy. Fuck! I almost did it.
824643097716027392 2017-01-26 15:40:10 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> @POTUS Quick! Name five things that are slowly killing this planet that arent your administration.

730098066821275648 2016-05-10 18:11:58 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> Getting email updates from schools that rejected you is like getting vacation pictures from your ex who broke your heart. The fuckin' nerve.
730097852987232256 2016-05-10 18:11:07 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> Good to know that even though I'm not a good enough physicist to attend ASU, they don't have any problems filling my inbox with bullshit ads
717091286797299712 2016-04-04 20:47:40 UTC <Will_A_Spencer> By far my favorite part of having resting bitch face is that people are reluctant to sit next to me on the bus. Leg room all day long.
