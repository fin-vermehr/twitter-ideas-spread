A #FinalSayForALL is a way that democratically we can together judge Brexit on what we know it will be and not on mistakes or untruths by any one side

I think we can safely gather I am no expert but as far as I know, we are responsible already for our borders. Trading is an important subject. For me, trade in the EU is an amazing privilege.

I didnt know though that what I based my vote on would later be said to be mistakes by Mr Farage on Good Morning Britain after the ref result. Id like for us all to have a say based on the facts & not mistakes.
961951899124723713 2018-02-09 13:16:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ForBritainParty @BestForBritain @chunderpiddle HI. To help clarify, this was for the millions my vote affected without my intention & these words are my own. I take responsibility for them alone & I value everyones views equally. How anyone voted or feels, its cool with me. As I respect & appreciate your voice, this was mine

961948365058650112 2018-02-09 13:02:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BestForBritain @ForBritainMcr I won, in fact. I won only later to be told by Mr Farage that many of the reasons I voted leave for via the Vote Leave campaign were mistakes. I want to protect the millions my actions hurt. Thats right thing to do. #Peopleb4Politics

961664558128664577 2018-02-08 18:14:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> For me, the biggest #BrexitImpact has been upon the millions of citizens (families & individuals) who are EU citizens in the UK, those who have felt theyve had no choice but to leave & the British citizens outside the UK.

961578040101953536 2018-02-08 12:30:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Brexit It would complete sense for China to see how Brexit plays out, as it is for every country. However, Im aware China very much is & is still wanting a great relationship with the UK, as does the UK with China. The UK being part of the EU generates the biggest success for everyone.

Its OTT.pic.twitter.com/lOhOifWdi2
961193360345260032 2018-02-07 11:02:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I feel quite concerned about hearing of a possible punishment plan aimed at the U.K.  The main picture used in this Sky article though is very anti EU. Too much so. Im very confused & upset. @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier Please help clarify this?https://apple.news/ATnVd_6rdSCKZpn83owVGZA

960895277287854081 2018-02-06 15:17:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DavidTCDavies @sabine_eh Thanks for sharing  If possible, Id like to view Mr Daviess video so people dont say Pro Europeans are giving a biased view. Such a quick release of that particular clip was reassuring and am eager to see more when possible.

960884172784095232 2018-02-06 14:33:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DavidTCDavies @Ferretgrove I truly think seeing the video would truly help things. Bullying is not acceptable to me. My views would not taint me in stipulating #no2h8 in any way.

960882940501688320 2018-02-06 14:28:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DavidTCDavies @floyduk Id appreciate that - I will not condone bullying of anyone and would like to know the facts. Seeing the footage Mr Davies has would certainly provide and create clarity on what happened. I would advise him to contact the police as well.
960881843460628480 2018-02-06 14:24:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DavidTCDavies @GerardBattenMEP @stadtgraz_brook Did he say this the footage he filmed???
960881585787686912 2018-02-06 14:23:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DavidTCDavies Very sad & sorry to see what you wrote - would appreciate if you feel comfortable sharing your video with everyone so we can see what happened. Abuse is wrong, no matter what. Many of us, regardless of view, respect one another equally. Did you contact the police?
960879884364066821 2018-02-06 14:16:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LiveNowHere @johnisitme I will read and Im not here to argue, either. I feel we are all on the same side. You are just trying to verify the facts & thats not a bad thing to do at all. Its important. I would stress again reading @InLimboBrexit & contacting @The3Million & @BritishInEurope for validity.
960877985007063042 2018-02-06 14:08:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LiveNowHere @johnisitme I appreciate the logic to take anything with a big pinch of salt () & as Id not discredit your views based on your ideas, I respectfully ask the same vice versa. Its logical that the stories are true & why people who feel badly EU citizens are being abused would be pro-EU.

I know its hard - its awful that people are not put 1st.

Hearing that we are now meant to be absolutely coming out of the customs union is not a thing any of us voted on.  I know Mr Davis was certainly in favour of staying in the CU. Its saddening.
960838155183128578 2018-02-06 11:30:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @craig_mbu @EleanorRylance Hi  I voted leave originally but after being told a few days later via Mr Farage on Good Morning Britain that the reason I based my vote were in fact mistakes by Vote Leave & then seeing millions in limbo made me change my mind. People come before politics, I want to remain.

It wasnt a good move to make. PM Cameron did a very clever thing in approaching China the way he did with the state visit. I think us being in the EU or at least SM & CU would secure so much for China & Europe.
959546323526737920 2018-02-02 21:57:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @kacidama @acameraguy1 Yes. 
959546218018951169 2018-02-02 21:57:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @gennax_juliet @acameraguy1 Personally, that is what I worry about as well.
959545932407861249 2018-02-02 21:55:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @acameraguy1 @gennax_juliet I believe in all of us  Always have & always will.  I think people have strong emotions over such a massive thing like Brexit & thats understandable. This is going to sound really cheesy (& I mean  ,  ) but we can always embrace the person & just reject that hatred.
959520812448526337 2018-02-02 20:16:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MichelBarnier Good evening, I just sent a tweet to the @guyverhofstadt regarding a anomaly I only just recollected during the ref. Many online applications to vote in the ref sadly didnt ensure those people could vote in it. Please see the below thread.https://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/959520132585443329
959520132585443329 2018-02-02 20:13:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt A very important recollection came back to me of something that happened during the referendum in the UK. Many applied to register to vote online  but the Gov website said they would only be eligible to vote after the ref. Not right, is it?https://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/872924334121259008
959519351169798145 2018-02-02 20:10:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BritishInEurope @The3Million @jwahjwah @brooking1980 @Roger_Powell79 @sarisataka Its a very pretty chart. I think 1 of the reasons people didnt vote is because they couldnt vote though they tried to. Those who registered to vote online for the ref were told on the gov websites they could only vote in the next election: after the refhttps://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/872924334121259008
959517394665385989 2018-02-02 20:02:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @acameraguy1 @gennax_juliet  You get flowers certainly for that reply (having different views is cool with me) & Im on the opinion we are all countrymen and women together, near & far. Its healthy & good to talk  Just have to say that we are all Europeans & EU citizens, too
959516418755760128 2018-02-02 19:58:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Someone has just reminded me of something v.important that happened during the ref & it relates to the figures produced stating people (in particular young people) didnt vote. Many actually registered online to vote but were turned away  #FinalSay time?https://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/872924334121259008

959514593633632256 2018-02-02 19:51:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BritishInEurope @The3Million @jwahjwah @brooking1980 @sarisataka @Roger_Powell79 I would like to chip in that during the referendum I distinctly remember people (particularly young voters (but of course not all 17,000,000)) saying they were unable to vote because they didnt know when they registered online they could only vote in elections after the ref.
959513155448791041 2018-02-02 19:45:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @acameraguy1 @gennax_juliet And I find your point totally understandable, too 
959511457040879616 2018-02-02 19:38:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @acameraguy1 @gennax_juliet I can understand that feeling - I guess given recent events with the Government & the acquisition of a lot of power, I am a little wary as to potential further developments from this time onwards.

Yes, I was. Do I think its right? No, I dont. As a slight aside, my thanks to you and everyone for sharing views, facts and feelings. Im glad we can all discuss this together.

As we all have differing opinions from different stances, it just reinforces that thought more so. I welcome everyones thoughts here.

In your opinion, as were all EU citizens, is it ok only some get to vote & not all? Surely the many that invest decades of their lives here deserve an equal say? Is some okay?

Diff reps said diff things in the name of Vote Leave. As 2+ reps said the same thing I believed would happen, it only supports my original thought.pic.twitter.com/vr7PbJoHOb

959422552585261057 2018-02-02 13:45:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @paulmurff I just hope the gov seriously considers how its actions look internationally ASAP. Brexit mishandling is eroding trust with 27 amazing countries full of family & friends & needs to be earned ASAP in & outside Europe. Cancelling prior state visits to China to go to the US was bad
959420461464674304 2018-02-02 13:37:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Anna_Soubry How do I join you?  I genuine question from me.
959419533500059648 2018-02-02 13:33:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @acgrayling @paulmurff Lots - the ones Im most aware of are investment in companies, setting up businesses, trade groups & taking some over current businesses. The pub that PM Cameron & President Xi went was later bought by a company in Shanghai. Many speeches from China speak of the golden era.

I do know he has some questions regarding the Single Market but saw some successes with it (I appreciate he may not have fully). An interesting parallel to Mr Hannon.
959220291862974466 2018-02-01 00:21:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime @GregorTodd5 Not to mention Mr Johnson, Mr Farage and Mr Paterson all saying how they supported us staying in the Single Market during the run up to the referendum.

959219300740591617 2018-02-01 00:17:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime @GregorTodd5 Hi Gregor. For me, hearing Dan Hammond adamant about staying in Single Market when he was on TV & (though I was concerned at 1st by his hard stance on the Customs Union) when he later said he wanted to keep bits of the CU & then negotiate it & the ECJ, it gave me that view.
959211553429118981 2018-02-01 23:47:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime @GregorTodd5 I voted leave on the promises of Vote Leave that we would stay in the Single Market and customs union only to be later advised after the vote that mistakes were made.  My Vote was not for millions to be left in limbo or to see 27 countries we have great bonds with torn apart.
959210895829356544 2018-02-01 23:44:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime @Nicholas1957 Agreed
959210828728856576 2018-02-01 23:44:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime @Z_Beeb Vote Leave promises that wed stay in the Single Market & customs union & provide 350 million from EU cash for our NHS then after the vote we are told mistakes were made. That was a massive misrepresentation & lie to us all. Millions of people are now suffering. I #Bregret It.
959209941545504768 2018-02-01 23:40:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joswinson @bbcquestiontime I agree with Ms Swinson.  & want to thank her for her eloquent comments on  #questiontime tonight. For me, I am a person who voted Leave on the promises made by Vote Leave that wed stay in the SM & CM only to hear after the vote this was a mistake. This Brexit is #NotInMyName

958704195263221760 2018-01-31 14:11:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews @RandomThawt The U.K. would do best if it stayed in the The EU or in the SM. Outside of it, there will be success but not extent it could have being part of the #EU28 IMO, if the U.K. leaves then the #EU27 will have a good opportunity there. France & China have a blossoming relationship.
958703554780377090 2018-01-31 14:08:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ConversationUK @jacquep Being inside the EU would be a fantastic advantage for the UK - France amongst many in the EU27 would certainly be a favourable alternative for trade within the EU by China. The UK will still have a good deal with China, just not to the exceptional extent if the UK was to #remain
958701567410167808 2018-01-31 14:00:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews Excellent  China is an amazing yet tenacious partner. We will need to work our socks off

958699092951162880 2018-01-31 13:50:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @VeIvetRose I could see this coalition working out very well. The @TheGreenParty @LibDems @scotgp @theSNP and indeed many I have sadly missed out could work amazingly together.
958698086737563649 2018-01-31 13:46:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> For me, the relationship between China and the U.K. personally is a VERY important one. I welcome this & for the U.K. to be a great partner with China. It would also be great for China & is if we #remain in the EU. Just saying http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42865133

Im asking my employers for suggestions, too.

I voted Leave but changed my mind as not only promises by Vote Leave were later said to be mistakes but millions of people are in limbo  I do feel everyone should have the chance for a final say based on the facts & not mistakes.
958679121894109184 2018-01-31 12:31:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I was alarmed to see someone tweeting things like this. It is disgusting & disrespectful. They speak for themselves alone. #NotInOurName #WeAreEurope #No2H8https://twitter.com/solacatholica/status/958523270785044480

For me, when I voted Leave I did want that halfway house & to still be part of the ECJ too. That is just what I felt when I voted and respect whatever vision you have, too.
958351700120784896 2018-01-30 14:50:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Prospectally2 Im glad she has at last gone to China. She sadly had to cancel her last official trip there as she had to go to America instead at the last minute. I really want the China-UK relationship to be protected.
958351334574522368 2018-01-30 14:48:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Hugodixon @ottocrat I object, too. We are all equal and must be treated as such. This is our home equally.

958289390031265792 2018-01-30 10:42:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Rowland72James Gibraltar has been really marginalised (like to be honest nearly all of the nations of the U.K. have been).  Whatever they choose to do, I respect and truly hope they are heard.

Hong Kong never acted like this before its return to China from the U.K. & on the day of the handover ceremony, it was only then flags were exchanged & all was conducted with respect for all. We should do this, too.

Please help the families & individuals affected by this who are in limbo like @The3Million & @BritishInEurope . Though guarantees were made, theyre treated as 2nd class citizens & its wrong

Glad you shared your view. I truly regret not realising the millions of people my vote affected (I never voted to leave the SM, CU or to leave the ECJ (for me, ECJ should be negotiated)

I advised @AndrewRosindell that image would invoke in some this feeling. We need more of the amazing @metpoliceuk & community police officers, not cuts. They look at the realities, facts & act. They dont label.
958091773745811457 2018-01-29 21:37:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @carlgardner I could do that - I would very much like to ask for advise on how to do this. I worry I will worry it up but am happy to do what I can x

956847131872186368 2018-01-26 11:11:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SKZCartoons What do you think about the apology President Trump gave? Im glad that at the very least its a positive step.

956817149728735234 2018-01-26 09:12:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SKZCartoons The image used along with the chosen bio conveyed a lot to me personally, sadly.  It would be to be nice to be proved wrong. Im very happy to apologise & delete it if so. Plus, the tweet below regarding the marginalising views of the sexual harassment allegations was sad 2 see
956813210102980608 2018-01-26 08:57:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SKZCartoons Hope you dont mind but I thought I would let you know that after he blocked you he sent a tweet asking for proof of racist policies.

I must say I think that though we have some differing views (like  Brexit), I think he is a great MP. He has always spoken to my family respectfully, cares about our town & replies to any concerns I have, too.

956232891557703680 2018-01-24 18:31:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @WalshHeyjude The comments on his thread made interesting reading, thats for sure. Though glad he deleted that prior tweet, I didnt see any apology had been made for its presence.
956232052575227904 2018-01-24 18:27:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @nikkirobson1 Bless you, I looked rough  I wore something different to work earlier today (I wore my EU Peace badge from #EUSuperGirl @albawhitewolf on my bow tie) - the pics were awful but Ill do it again soon x

956090597806309376 2018-01-24 09:05:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove @PAisthorpe I honestly cannot see why anyone would not think that tweet was not only going to target Mayor Khan but London itself  Saying that, I truly hope this was an oversight but would like that image removed ASAP.
956090209325780992 2018-01-24 09:04:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndrewRosindell Please consider removing this image, Sir? It has been used by some before to not only target Mayor Khan but sadly as means to create discord in London. #ILoveLondon You are an intelligent man who doesnt need to use propaganda #LondonPridehttps://twitter.com/andrewrosindell/status/955707916031549442
956088595516919808 2018-01-24 08:57:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndrewRosindell @Ferretgrove Im afraid that the image featured in Rosindells Tweet has been used by some before as a means of targeted harassment & to promote discord in #London. Please Mr Rosindell, consider removing the image. You are an intelligent person who does not need to use propaganda like this.

955920046211125249 2018-01-23 21:47:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @owillis Its one of the golden rules of how to become a demon - any bad or negative things that happen, take credit for it. Doesnt matter what it is or the consequences because it creates a reputation. A not-to-be-messed-with one. Aint that a stinker?

To everyone who has came to the SouthEast and all parts of the U.K. making their lives here, their families & more besides, thank you  You fulfil more than needs, you fulfil communities & joy. There are good and bad things (as in all things), I see a lot of good.
955433828553777152 2018-01-22 13:35:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SheronWilkie I love your wit  *sigh* Why are we all at odds with each other when we are all family and friends? Lets have full free medical care for both houses instead, lol.
955431926814461953 2018-01-22 13:28:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AJEnglish @charlesaje @YangheeLeeSKKU @JoeEEnglish I personally agree.

I respect you for trying so much. I tried to and even though my vote won, I ironically felt Id lost more & more as time has gone on & on. My action hurt you & everyone - Im so sorry. I wont let you or your family down again #Remain

955407307155935232 2018-01-22 11:50:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jenny_Nice Olaya, we did not deserve you and we all need here to make things a darn lot better but I hope we can try to repair the damage idiots have caused you all. Spain is a Beautiful place but I want the UK to be better for you, for everyone.
955406861221679104 2018-01-22 11:48:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jenny_Nice Olaya has no reason whatsoever to feel guilt over protecting herself and her family - it is I how feels guilty & shameful for her feeling this is her only option.  #peopleb4politics I wish them every happiness & to know those English idiots speak #NotInMyName #ThisIsOurHome

Too many.  I (again) want to thank you for your positivity. Imo, we all want to show how global we can be & how gentlemenly we really are. For me, I want to #remain but respect you view.
955404689226584064 2018-01-22 11:40:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Scientists4EU @jessenorman @dontbrexitfixit @AlanRay_Jones @pvandck @Lorelei_174 @RemainingKind @p13tobler I enjoy the positivity in your tweets. I think if Brexit was handled more with that kind, considerate & respective view of all involved that Brexit wouldve been better. The way some (absolutely not all) speak so ill of the EU & its members hurts that reputation you helped make.
955403025996271616 2018-01-22 11:33:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @talkRADIO Hi Are you referring to the lovely article by Briebart who states that? Its not like they have a biased view @Google I think you have always kept the digital network open to all, regardless of political views. Otherwise, how could @WhatNowDoc quote this fact? Respect to all.

955379728982138880 2018-01-22 10:00:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @VilleAvallon @barlaventoexp I truly wish I had your gift with words - I worry when I write Im either too informal or too cold. I want to convey my affection and how moved I am by this loving tribute but worry my French may show a disrespect if I use the wrong terms. Its like writing a love letter, lol!
955378899634081792 2018-01-22 09:57:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @CBItweets @Anna_Soubry That was at the very least was what I voted Leave for (I would like us to negotiate as much as possible within the ECJ, too) but putting my ego out of this, thank you 
955376194417020928 2018-01-22 09:46:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I want to share this touching message from @barlaventoexp to the amazing @VilleAvallon M. le Maire de la ville d'Avallon & people of #Avallon for the amazing tribute they have paid to Jo Cox?

In fact, Im going to quote your tweet and then retweet it again  Im still working on my reply in French and it is not very good. Please give me a bit more time to do it - I want to but want it to be better than okay. 
955372802034552832 2018-01-22 09:33:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett My apologies for the delay - I wont bombard you with questions. I think you deserve a week with nice things ahead instead. Thank you for just sharing what you did.

955369780432855045 2018-01-22 09:21:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Conservatives @drjanaway @daisyblue_1 I have NEVER smoked anything & had to witness a beloved grandparent have the most serious health concerns from her smoking (hence my very anti-smoking attitude). I do not agree with the Conservative parties values & regardless (my ego is irrelevant) theres no need to insult any1
955368949406937089 2018-01-22 09:18:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Conservatives @drjanaway @daisyblue_1 @manguitartech As a said to Daisy in the Tweet I wrote below, there are Pro EU groups in the Conservative party and nearly all Parties. I myself am prefer other parties but keeping my view out of it, Im glad everyone has options in those parties & share their views, toohttps://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/955368232302579712
955368232302579712 2018-01-22 09:15:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Conservatives @drjanaway @daisyblue_1 @BestForBritain provides details on groups from all parties that are Pro EU & this includes the Conservative party - groups include Citizens for Britain ( https://citizens4britain.org/ ) & @NoBrexitTories . Regardless of views on political parties, there are Pro EU groups out there.
955196594252648448 2018-01-21 21:53:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DanWarren84 Fantastic thing to hear x
955196478712147968 2018-01-21 21:52:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett Programming is an amazing & extremely intricate thing to do - respect to you in what you do. You being so learned on the EFTA/EEA makes this already interesting exchange even more so. Please give me a little more time to read what you wrote (Im a parent, too) & happily reply. 
955194612766969856 2018-01-21 21:45:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jessenorman @RemainingKind @davidchernaik You really move me - thank you and I will do my best x
955147650063577090 2018-01-21 18:38:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Scientists4EU @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett Who could not like your words, in particular there?  I totally respect that and yourself for how you have stayed your reasons for your points. I guess the initial reply felt like you were ridiculing me a little (only a little) but Im happy to have been mistaken 
955147186970529792 2018-01-21 18:36:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Scientists4EU @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett 6. I completely see your point and as you say, it is complicated. There is potential but my point was that this is the worlds biggest internal market - smartly,, you mentioned the EEA. I felt this was just the Single Market but tbh, EEA is much more logical choice to be this 
955146589181444098 2018-01-21 18:34:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Scientists4EU @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett 4. As we are discussing specifically the U.K. though, please see the info below. As nice as it would be to be like Norway, Im not sure if we can. 5. We do give funding but based on how we are underfunding healthcare & social services right now, I doubt the Gov will fund it.pic.twitter.com/U9LGVBF4oT
955145195020083200 2018-01-21 18:28:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett Sorry I ran out of room in my prior tweet but seriously, thanks for replying 
955144745365463040 2018-01-21 18:27:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett 1. Isreal certainly does - will we be able to keepnwith Erasmus+ though after Brexit it is now stated by the U.K. gov we will keep in it only up to the time we leave (please see the pic below) & 2. I hope your employers do that - none of mine ever have & Ive worked in banking.pic.twitter.com/flHtoDud8x
955143810312540161 2018-01-21 18:23:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Anna_Soubry @JeanneBartram @Geoelte_Spinne @ldnewbie1974 He has the courage of his convictions - I respect that. Some things he has views on and has done I do disagree with but I respect him for they way he has kept true to the values of those he represents.
955143371915440130 2018-01-21 18:21:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I reported the person. Its so sad, isnt it? Ugh!
955142518424915969 2018-01-21 18:18:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis Absolutely and I reported the mentioned person. #No2H8 
955142309112360960 2018-01-21 18:17:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove Oh, it cant seem to locate him to report him 
955142163087745024 2018-01-21 18:16:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RemainerNow @mikegalsworthy I have and he is lovely
955142008326246400 2018-01-21 18:16:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney I appreciate your feeling - at least it ended on a nice note.  Wished more did.
955141015748403200 2018-01-21 18:12:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney @WhatNowDoc Alas, I think I should.  Im glad though that at least things can be fun. Its nice.
955138568971747328 2018-01-21 18:02:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @helenlewis It was a wonderful interview 
955137412610609152 2018-01-21 17:57:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney Anyone who calls you something negative must be blind to what they read or see. I pity them for not realising it. Ive been called a Brusels B**** but tbh I giggled at the spelling more than feel offended at the name.
955136862565388289 2018-01-21 17:55:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney @WhatNowDoc I think Im making this a comedy of errors for you both when are both so intelligent, lol. Sorry x
955135774198042629 2018-01-21 17:51:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MrBrendanCox @VilleAvallon @UKinFrance @FranceintheUK @barlaventoexp I think you should consider being a Diplomat or Ambassador x  Im still trying to compose what I want to write but am finding my French is so basic - lol! I adore these songs!!! 
955135146113593344 2018-01-21 17:48:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @WhatNowDoc @SarahMcCartney I know & thanks for clarifying. But dont let him (I presume) - he has said his views and it certainly doesnt detract from your very valid and sound points 
955134795452944390 2018-01-21 17:47:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @WhatNowDoc @SarahMcCartney Your points are very valid - dont let anyone convince you otherwise  I would assume the gentleman (forgive me if I am wrong) means no harm, either. Glad to meet you, Sarah 
955134195793256449 2018-01-21 17:45:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney @WhatNowDoc My apologies for disappointing you, then. Have a great week ahead, too.
955105798992154626 2018-01-21 15:52:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MrBrendanCox @VilleAvallon @UKinFrance @FranceintheUK What a fantastic and great idea - your words in French were so beautiful & my French is so bad ... I loved your tweet to #Avallon so much @barlaventoexp ... I will do my best

955105148765982725 2018-01-21 15:49:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @barlaventoexp Your words to the amazing Mayor of Avallon were so beautiful ... thank you for letting me see them

Its always good point out the facts (thats great, tbh). I dont like being teased but hey, its Twitter & the weekend. Have a good one, everyone 
955089514090856449 2018-01-21 14:47:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett ... 4. We will have a bespoke relationship with Europol, not IN  Europol so I think my points ok. 5. Please see @Scientists4EU who have lots of data on the funding scientists stand to loose & 6. EEA is said to be an extension of the Single Market yet we may be leaving that, why?
955087367823556608 2018-01-21 14:39:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andymoz78 @_SimonBarnett Sorry for the delay - its been a hectic weekend.1. Erasmus+ will only continue until we leave 2. Do you get bank holidays paid for and that time off work because I never have (& Ive worked in banking most of my life). 3. Peace seems accurate  ... more continued then Ill 
955085901239062529 2018-01-21 14:33:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis @Rachel5742 I really liked everything you wrote.  I know the UK isan amazingly strong place & that though we would cope after Brexit, I am so upset at the way its been carried out. #NotInMyName I feel those in charge have insulted millions of people & 27 amazing countries in the last 2yrs
955084260918034432 2018-01-21 14:26:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @WhatNowDoc @SarahMcCartney I think so too, personally. I felt I sounded snarky and want to apologise to them (hope you see this message as I am genuinely sorry) 
955083910106566656 2018-01-21 14:25:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jessenorman @Gingernut_49 @RemainingKind Agreed. I love that sentiment of All You Need Is Love. I want so very much for everyone regardless of whatever their view is to not feel threatened or disrespected because of it  I believe in us all #United
955008673935392769 2018-01-21 09:26:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RubiesB4Swine Clever  IMO, I feel @McVities is using #Brexit as an excuse to do this. It may well be a factor but to state this is the sole reason for doing it right in the public eye is just going to upset people in the UK who wish to leave.  I personally dont want that, views aside.
955005433307107329 2018-01-21 09:13:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @WorldSoulVibes Beautiful #Utah America really has some beautiful places in it

954990330167873536 2018-01-21 08:13:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jessenorman @Gingernut_49 @RemainingKind Thank you for giving people in my situation a voice and for being so understanding 
954848547060449280 2018-01-20 22:50:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jessenorman @RemainingKind Indeed - I really like him, tbh. Slight hag though is that now he is Chair of the Brexit committee  Lol! A nice guy who does a good job though

954846545349955585 2018-01-20 22:42:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jessenorman @RemainingKind Its been made so easy to say this once shameful thing because everyone in the FBPE/Pro EU & remainer family has given me so much compassion, understanding & even when asking me why the heck I did it, found only honesty & fair-treatment. Thank you for making it so 
954845797782257664 2018-01-20 22:39:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Conservatives @drjanaway There are some amazing Conservatives in the party - its such a shame so many have committed & done some incredibly bad things  Its easy to taint all with the same brush but I urgeneveryone to please judge each individual on their own actions. Its a strange time at the mo.

954844115472089089 2018-01-20 22:32:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney Shall we put in a good word for this person? Im happy too but its a shame they dont have as much faith in their friends as we do: were all friends. @WhatNowDoc Mr Johnson proposed a possible solution already but we could help with a back up plan if you like.

954790707742629889 2018-01-20 19:00:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SarahMcCartney I never even thought of this ... such a good point.
954790594605404161 2018-01-20 18:59:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @gallesearoma Congratulations to him Spanish is a fabulous language but one I find really hard. Im confident in him though 
954790098817646592 2018-01-20 18:57:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Anna_Soubry And I thank you for it, Ms Soubry. You voted for what your constituents voiced. I encourage all MPs, regardless of what the vote is on, to vote in that way. 
954763461992632326 2018-01-20 17:12:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @__cMc__ In case Bryan sees this, I hope he knows that I mean no offence to him at all. I do like some of the points he has raised to me (I hope they get heard higher up and taken on board) & truly wish him a great weekend & I wont block him - the door is always open to him & you  
954748632917594114 2018-01-20 16:13:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @__cMc__ Here is some evidence that shiws otherwise. Bryan, Id like to show that tweet on what you felt #FBPE could mean. If #FBPE isnt meant to mean Pro European, then why insult those who share a view of a Full Brexit? https://twitter.com/bryaneastwood2/status/943553539623841793
954746725499011072 2018-01-20 16:05:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @__cMc__ @BryanEastwood2 Forgive the bad grammar but I was surprised seeing the different interpretations you have given to #FBPE - its a shame, really. Anyway, its only how you may have felt at the time or for some/any other reason. I mustnt presume your thoughts.
954746093266460672 2018-01-20 16:03:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @__cMc__ @BryanEastwood2 Hang on ... do you think this tweet applies to all use #FBPE ? Im sure you mean to insult only Pro EU/Europeans but from what you said now its a contradiction. It insults both Pro Brexit & Pro EU people https://twitter.com/bryaneastwood2/status/943553539623841793
954743978775244800 2018-01-20 15:54:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @__cMc__ @BryanEastwood2 When was that? And we are all one people - you are my countryman and I refuse to disconnect from you because you have a different view to me. Id rather see your take on things without any prior judgements.
954743495352373249 2018-01-20 15:52:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @__cMc__ It is official  Each time you use it, people will think you are Pro EU/European or that you are  trying to hijack it like For Britain tried (not the 1st time this has been claimed). If you want to use it, at least you know now how it will be viewed. The decision is yours 
954714821290848256 2018-01-20 13:58:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @__cMc__ Thanks for letting me know but honestly, it was originally created to be Follow Back Pro EU/European and #FBPE still is used as such in an official capacity.pic.twitter.com/ZG9Uuuag5o

954674134423875584 2018-01-20 11:17:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I genuinely would like to reply - if I just not use the hashtag then people will see that better. You really help me a lot @ejectamenta_com  I removed my past tweet because of my awful grammar in it.

954668348352196608 2018-01-20 10:54:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove We should do this after every #Twitterstorm - family comes first after all and after all the effort everyone took to write in the #ILoveEUCos hashtag, I want to read, enjoy, thank and celebrate them  They made the F in #FBPE stand for Family  #ILoveEUAll
954667140027699201 2018-01-20 10:49:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove This is an amazing feature - the great #FBPE #FamilyBonding session or #TheGreatReply xxx 
954666388559364096 2018-01-20 10:46:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove I love that!!! I think replying to some of the amazing stories I read under #ILuvEUCos is a gr8 idea.

954663272745242624 2018-01-20 10:33:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Bryan, my apologies but I might be away for a bit. Please have a good weekend and all the best.
954660936404688896 2018-01-20 10:24:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 For me, I want the very best for everyone, everywhere. It means we really do become a Global Britain. What I like is when (like you have done) people of all views with genuine concerns convey them with facts & respect. It creates a healthy way for everyone to achieve the best.
954657594546769920 2018-01-20 10:11:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 It makes me wonder if that is best way to work with people. Making them feel forced is probably not the most advisable route, in my mind anyway. One of the reasons I think people still wish to leave is perhaps because they feel restricted & dictated too. Is this much different?
954655847149395969 2018-01-20 10:04:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Brian, sorry I reacted in that way beacuse I think I was acting unfair to you  It wasnt even my intention to do that. This was made by The Sun and it is to them I should address my concerns  I just worry about what is being conveyed to the world using Brexit  #NotInMyName
954630153166032896 2018-01-20 08:22:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 The image of Prime Minister May (not The Queen?) with crown could also denote something else ... I appreciate it represents victory but is this a hint of something else? The Henry VIII Act? What things are happening in the name of Brexit we didnt vote for?  #NotInMyNamepic.twitter.com/3nmcQXQq0M
954629159577366531 2018-01-20 08:18:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I want the best relationship possible with them all, too  What will Brussels and Germany think though after past exchanges though? Will they want to work with us? Or will they think our past work efforts are literally shot down with arrows now?
954628441642536960 2018-01-20 08:15:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 That picture showed Europeans beheaded on the ground  If its meant to be a symbol for Brexit, theres lots to be said to. Let joy be unconfined #NotInMyName I never voted for a Brexit like that. I wanted a gentlemanly, compassionate, respective & innovative business-like 1
954623477226582016 2018-01-19 07:55:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @heeney77 Youve nothing to apologise for x keep being awesome x
954622443125182464 2018-01-19 07:51:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I want to continue to live with, Work with, learn with & create with every1. I respectfully have affection to the EU & its members for it. We do give a lot & I think concerns you have should be listened to & acted on. Itd help everyone in the EU too. We are 1 OF 28, not 1/28.

Im fine and tbh, everythings cool  Its alright for us to have differences of opinion and Im very glad for the amazing #FBPE family Im a part of x Thank you x
954620278671380480 2018-01-19 07:43:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @heeney77 Im very lucky - I would say I think Bryan is being kind to me. Im sorry bad things happened and Im causing probs for everyone.
954619902454894592 2018-01-19 07:41:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Do you think though that by saying how much people love & value the EU that those countries who are members will not only realise they are not being rejected but that in fact they are valued & loved? For me, Brexit is being carried out in a very strange & violent way. pic.twitter.com/s2sjxFqvVP

I appreciate you may want to block me but I wont do that to you - Id rather look forward to a time when we could discuss this more. I wont judge on anything other than the points you raise. Stevie, thanks for caring for me, Sir.
954615168297852928 2018-01-19 07:22:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @heeney77 Thats very sad to hear  Thanks again for protecting me x
954614528318189569 2018-01-19 07:20:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I think (tbh) you had previously made good points & backed them up with evidence. That proves you are an intelligent person (I dislike people saying those who voted leave or wish to leave arent- thats not true). Please dont give into frustration - youre better than that.
954613778406166528 2018-01-19 07:17:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 @heeney77 I though he was very kind to me and tbh, he didnt judge me. I think though he and I have very different views on some things that he made some interesting points & backed them up. Stevie, thanks for caring about me.  Bryan, I wish you the best. I wish you all the best 
954608337714405377 2018-01-19 06:55:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Bryan. I hope in the future we can talk more. My respect to you and have an amazing weekend 
954608067966095361 2018-01-19 06:54:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Just so you know, thanks for talking with me. I appreciated it. Have a great weekend.
954607902890831872 2018-01-19 06:53:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> #FBPE means Follow Back Pro EU (or Europeans  ) https://twitter.com/bryaneastwood2/status/954359373907849217
954607248629780480 2018-01-19 06:51:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 It doesnt though to those who originally created it & who still use it (Pro Europeans) Bryan. I think you could create a new hashtag for what you feel represents you & your views best. I personally would like you to not use #FBPE. This is only my thought & I mean no disrespect.
954604477373349889 2018-01-19 06:40:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 We put in a lot of money, I agree. I also see value of many sorts. I stated some very clearly. Unintentionally, saying the EU is a parasite insults those 27 countries who are part of the It, just for being in the EU - iWhy hurt good people and countries you want to work with?
954602683167657984 2018-01-19 06:33:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Lack of funding to train nurses, sending nurses away from Australia because of English tests which are their native language and funds inadequate enough to support our aging (& much loved) older generation. No, it isnt.
954602105851056128 2018-01-19 06:30:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Is this how you view the Commonwealth countries, the EU & indeed all we do collaborative work & trade with? What do you think of us being a a Global Britain after Brexit?
954598689254801408 2018-01-19 06:17:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Bryan, as you do not like the EU (thats fair enough if you dont - we all have our views) them may I suggest you remove the #FBPE hashtag? I think you dont need to use it - your points can be taken better if you remove it & you wouldnt be offending me or others. Thanks

954596842435764225 2018-01-19 06:09:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 It is. It just this current government that is to blame, either. They are though the ones now in charge and action is needed. #simples
954596522104184834 2018-01-19 06:08:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I know about the money meant to be after but what about the amount? How many different figures have we had now? And why arent we finding it outselves right now? The Government needs to act ASAP. Havingvthe British Ted Cross help out patients as times of crisis is wrong.
954596112740085762 2018-01-19 06:07:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 He raised the proposal in a very public way - why do that if it is a joke? Saying that, I do hope you are tight as it sadly has seemed a vain thing to say, sadly.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/01/18/boris-johnson-calls-bridge-across-channel-saying-itsridiculous/
954595243755737088 2018-01-19 06:03:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I respectfully yet complete disagree on member states being parasites.
954594852309749760 2018-01-19 06:02:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 That is not true, sorry - it helps funds our childrens programming (CBeebies), businesses, roads, cycle paths, science research, travel & much more.
954461930881736704 2018-01-19 21:13:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I am very happy we agree on this and look forward to seeing what we could possibly agree on. We have very different views on a lot of things but I look forward to positive things 
954461591260549120 2018-01-19 21:12:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Personally, I found the idea building a bridge across the Channel by Mr Johnson a bit stupid and a vanity project. Just my thought though.
954461178830512129 2018-01-19 21:10:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Id rather we stopped welcoming the privatisation of our NHS & had the money promised if we left the EU. Sadly but at least then honestly, Mr Farage admitted this was one of the mistakes made by Vote Leave. So many excuses about this funding - will it be the same for others?
954460099933810688 2018-01-19 21:06:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Can we claim the credit for the US researchers efforts? Seems strange to me we do that yet ignore everyone else who made amazing brakethroughs like the EU-U.K. work on hydrogen as a fuel source. It is amazing yet so few know about it. Why? We should be just as proud of it.
954458718162341888 2018-01-19 21:01:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @FinancialTimes @BryanEastwood2 This wasnt a vanity project and nor was cancer research.  Orkney project shows potential of hydrogen as a fuel source https://www.ft.com/content/f5e8c5aa-d8ee-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f via @financialtimes
954452776293191680 2018-01-19 20:37:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I appreciate that - you showed the screen shot of the bbc interview (I read the article online, too). Am I right in thinking this was a team in the US who did the research? Awesome achievement. What about the research into Breast cancer that has also happened? Is fantastic!
954451678354341888 2018-01-19 20:33:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 How could not like good news  I do truly wish every success in this research and the funding to go with it.
954439682565312512 2018-01-19 19:45:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 I dont feel doom & gloom - I adore the U.K. & truly the great point you made about the breakthrough in anger treatment today - who would want to be negative about such an awesome thing?  I love Britain - I just also love Europe & EU for what its given me. Thats alright.
954438988147904513 2018-01-19 19:42:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 You mean the one the Government is deliberately undermining and trying to privatise? Building bridges, according to Mr Johnson. I admire your trust, I trusted their actions too.  Then Mr Farage says mistakes were made by the Leave campaign shortly after the referendum

Interesting you raise point that is a bit anti-Brexit.
954437674957406209 2018-01-19 19:37:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Just also want to say how epic that news is!  I am not underestimating the amazing scienctists we are lucky to have here - I adore them. I do know a number of them are worried about funding and finances. @Scientists4EU gave great info which highlights this concern.
954435347689164801 2018-01-19 19:28:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Apologies for the rubbish text before  It already has, sadly. Costs are going up & not just in the monetary sense. For instance, certain goods (not all)  like medicines (cancer treatments) are now too expensive for our hospitals to use.
954434525467115521 2018-01-19 19:24:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @OFOCBrexit @Femi_Sorry @JamesHarrisNow @heeney77 @British_Future We all had our reasons for what we voted for & Im sorry if sounded callous or rude  You chose what you felt & thats what we were asked to do. If you are happy with how you voted then seriously, good for you . We share Europe at least & possibly more besides.

Energy conversion and storage has amazing & limitless potential - go Scotland! The splitting of the hydrogen atom for instance is incredible - an EU to Orkney Council initiative  #ILuvEUCos because you find amazing countries like #Scotland on this.
954418906432704513 2018-01-19 18:22:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Telegraph @saywhatuwantok I really feel for her on this specific thing. She has tried to carry out Brexit & for me, I feel she has had lots of probs from those under her. If this was a remain win, shed respect the decision but would rightly represent those that voted leave, too - more than remain is now.

954416499724292097 2018-01-19 18:13:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Oh! Forgive me for not asking before but what is your view on Euratom? As a side note, I love the collaborative work we in the #UK are doing with #France on energy storage & Chemistry. Us leaving could affect one of the most innovative & profitable areas science is exploring.
954414547774951425 2018-01-19 18:05:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @EmmanuelMacron @EUlvis Its a Blue Christmas again  Thanks for being our Lucky charm  
954413596972408832 2018-01-19 18:01:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 We could actually invest this money from sources that money is currently being allocated to other sources. For instance, the proposed bridge by Mr Johnson or the no deal moneypot. Just some suggestions and only my thought.
954413168331194369 2018-01-19 18:00:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 Our healthcare systems, fishing towns & farming industry. You made points that Im glad you raised but for me, why isnt the U.K. doing it right now? I dont see how the EU is responsible for the NHS crisis - in fact states it as a positive for the EU. They want this everywhere.
954411637057957890 2018-01-19 17:54:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @albawhitewolf I  my badges!!!
954411072248786949 2018-01-19 17:51:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 For me, why dont we invest in the U.K. ASAP? The fact we havent had meant our pound is lowering and this is making our national debt higher.  I will NEVER jump ship. This is my home & I love it - I #LoveUK and not people telling ithers what to do. Its that which changed me
954410483427282944 2018-01-19 17:49:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BryanEastwood2 If only it were #simples - we underfund our dairy farms & county farms are in decline  Our NHS is in decline & being prepared to be privatised (a thing I didnt vote for). I also suggest you check up the latest on fishing rights as this keeps changing. Best of respects to you.

954316416227987456 2018-01-19 11:35:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RCorbettMEP After hearing about Mr Johnson wanting to build a bridge across the channel, this genuinely interesting article with its heading made me giggle a bit. Our Commonwealth friends speak good sense. We should never have side-lined them in the past, lets not do that now

954136022866153473 2018-01-18 23:38:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 Ireland is getting a lot of support and security right now (every country should). I do personally feel (just me) that the U.K. should have taken better care of the peace treaty between NI and ROI - involving the DUP was a risky thing to do. I certainly dont blame the DUP though
954135253265809410 2018-01-18 23:35:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 You are very kind. You & everyone are very important - sorry for sounding cheesy but its true. I originally voted Leave - felt very scared & confused by the whole thing, tbh. Seeing how people have been treated after the result is what made me change.  I want the best for all.
954133801902460928 2018-01-18 23:29:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 The EU27 are 27 countries that are our friends - how can we have as a global U.K. good relationships otherwise. We wouldve had presidency at this time. My MP has advised me that as he is Chairman of the Brexit committee he is unable to discuss my concerns with me - is that fair?
954123737200320514 2018-01-18 22:50:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 As I say but not as eloquently as you, a cheeky thing. I know Im very OTT & idealistic butvtake your points seriously - your views make me still feel though what couldnt be achieved by voicing your concerns & seeing what we could do? Everyone would be helped in the EU.

954122349389008896 2018-01-18 22:44:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LabourJW86 @LiverpoolDL I think peace is not just achieved on 1 side. I am so proud of the U.K. & EU. These are just my thoughts and thanks for expressing yours (genuinely).
954121771829071879 2018-01-18 22:42:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 I feel (just my thoughts) that the U.K. underestimates the amazing work & ranking it has in the world & what it achieved/s in the EU. As you say, 27 other countries need to discuss these matters with us but if I find you point convincing, why wouldnt they?
954120998328119297 2018-01-18 22:39:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 Im sure the money would be well-spent if we left the EU but the Eu does invest in the UK. I want to respond to all your points (my child keeps waking up) and apologies for the gaps in my responses. I want to respond to them. You took the time to reply & deserve decent answers.
954120121676632064 2018-01-18 22:35:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tinkerpuss @JUREY71 Me in very a cheeky way could argue that my statement is not false according to what you said but tbh, I feel very inspired by what you wrote & take your points seriously. Id like to see if we could even make free healthcare a reality for every country.

954099968230510594 2018-01-18 21:15:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JUREY71 @tinkerpuss When I was in Portugal with my parents as a young teen, my mum needed to go to hospital in an emergency. She did pay a fee (a co-payment charge) at a reduced cost as she was a tourist. Had education there been free then yea, it wouldve been free too. My apologies for my mistake.
954098652301156352 2018-01-18 21:10:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JUREY71 @tinkerpuss I like this point you make. Its a good 1. Why cant we carry on campaigning to stop Live Exports? Can we do more? If we remain, we can do that from within. I believe in our country enough to get results. If we leave, animals will still suffer. Imo, its wishful thinking from me.
954097912073654272 2018-01-18 21:07:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JUREY71 @tinkerpuss So sorry my tweet offended you and I would like to give you the reasons why I said what I did. Regarding the environment, despite many Leave voters wanting stronger rights for the environment, there is a worry over funding. For Hampshire & Isle of Wight, 70% of funds are at risk.pic.twitter.com/R9xQ7K8tIX

953948976549593090 2018-01-18 11:15:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus A very interesting quote to ponder over. Indeed. 
953947772390080513 2018-01-18 11:10:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> If people who wish to leave want stamps to commemorate it then thats ok with me - same with the idea of some stating would like a blue passport. For me, Id like a stamp with the Queens blue hat on as well & my blue British passport to have stars on (a EU British passport).pic.twitter.com/h9sX86SNu3

I can say though that many in China value the Golden Era & relationship very much. China also values France most highly.

953578156400828417 2018-01-17 10:42:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @bbc5live Absolutely  What affects you should affect all of us equally. A very lovely lady on here ( @catsinbelfry - the lady in ladybird  ) shares your bravery & I am so upset Ive not done enough to stop the segregation of us all as people. It must stop  #ThisisOurHome #Equally
953575460172189697 2018-01-17 10:31:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mikegalsworthy @angryray66 For me, the fact you question and raise such an important dilemma means so much to me 
953575182370820096 2018-01-17 10:30:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @cliodiaspora It is massive news - what affects some of us should affect all of us #equally. #ThisIsOurHome #equally #together
953566755141636096 2018-01-17 09:56:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @thegreenplace I was wondering if I could ask you about your experiences with Estonian e-citizenship. IMO, I think Estonia was very clever and creative to have done this. Wish I could have a way to do it but am not clever enough.
953566234892791810 2018-01-17 09:54:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ScotParl @scotgov @stephenkerrMP @thegreenplace Why on earth did they do that? 
953565476319309825 2018-01-17 09:51:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @angryray66 @mikegalsworthy A responsible way to ensure the answer is valid 
953565335118123008 2018-01-17 09:51:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @angryray66 @mikegalsworthy A nice answer 
953564998571356160 2018-01-17 09:49:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mikegalsworthy @angryray66 This is such an intelligent question. Wish I had heard you before. Getting the facts is always a very sound thing to do - I have no idea what your views are on Brexit but regardless, a good question indeed.
953563252524503040 2018-01-17 09:42:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DExEUgov @RBiddlecombe All in all, some good things were found out anyway. My thanks to Mr Gulleford & Mr Agnew, MEP. I will do what I can 
953562895501099008 2018-01-17 09:41:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RBiddlecombe I was adised to raise any concerns you may have about Brexit with the DExEU either direct or via your local constituency MP & It is also worth signing up for the regular updates & briefing papers that are issued by the @DExEUgov which you can do via https://www.gov.uk/world/brexit 
953559909077082113 2018-01-17 09:29:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RBiddlecombe I do appreciate your feeling  I recently contacted my MEPs to ask for advice on getting an EU passport & received only 1 reply - from the office of Stuart Agnew, MEP & of UKIP. The advice stated was a bit negative but constructive - they advised I contact @DExEUgov for help.

953556833465257984 2018-01-17 09:17:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RBiddlecombe My MP is Chair of the Brexit Committee (). Sir Amess is an nice gentleman.  Im unsure if he can express my voice on #Brexit due to his position but I think I will email him anyway. Its worth it at any rate. We will find a way

953536225150894080 2018-01-16 07:55:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Very interesting information on a new Clause 6 in the #EUwithdrawalbill  As my MP is sadly the Chair for the Brexit committee I am unable to ask him to #support #Clause6 - perhaps people could email/contact their MPs to say #YesTo6 ?https://twitter.com/chrislesliemp/status/953193354002620417

953425550818803712 2018-01-16 00:35:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Rachel5742 It is just mind blowing so much has gone seemingly unchallenged in the House of Commons - I do though want to thank those brave MPs that are trying to do what they can to bring a much needed voice of reason. They should have had more support though.

953421360390397952 2018-01-16 00:19:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @professorgreen @Channel4 #WorkingClassWhiteMen is fantastic. You & everyone on these programs has shared so much (a lot of stuff that is so hard to share) with everyone. Its only episode 2 & I feel so privileged & proud to watch them & you. Cheers, mate. Thanks all of you! 
953404125504528385 2018-01-16 23:10:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @albawhitewolf I am completely with you on that one   Its absurd how much they do it, too x

953345594617221121 2018-01-16 19:17:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @W_A_T_O_N Hello  Thanks for the advice regarding writing to my MEPs how to acquire an EU passport. I was sadly rejected (Ive heard back only from 1 MEP from UKIP) but feel very glad to have written. I cant write to my MP as he is Chair on the Brexit committee. Any ideas?
953343926181814272 2018-01-16 19:11:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @elsewhere55 I just keep thinking that if #remain had won how @theresa_may would be as a Prime Minister? I appreciate Mr Cameron would still be PM but Id personally be interested to see how things could have been.

The way in which things have been conducted is both confusing & worrying. We are not at war - we are a family. I understand business-like attitudes but not hard ones. #WeAreEurope #WeAreEuropeans #WeAreFamily #FBPE

Fight I dont & I wont because from ultra-violence and infra rage comes now a brand new spectrum for a brave new age. Yet somehow its the same. Simply, its a starlit wish - a wish we could #remain.
953314556683718666 2018-01-16 17:14:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Hello.  Oh.  No?  Oh!   But we are made of stars, hydrogen, carbon, iron, blood & so on. My though then how those stars must have shone!
953314373262565376 2018-01-16 17:13:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> The stars that died in the lost youths eyes some 100 years ago yet somehow still remains amidst todays lies & fears. can yet be regained. Lets mourn together, join together - lets #remain together.
953313789931335685 2018-01-16 17:11:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> We live in an age of stars and not just those of fame. They shine bright for everyone so please let me #remain

952885488146419714 2018-01-15 12:49:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheGreenParty  It seems so unfair that they were given and had so many big girvernment contracts yet are not being supported in being able to carry them out. Just my thoughts, though.

I respectfully disagree & look forward to the future. Thanks for sharing what you felt. 
952871627817193472 2018-01-15 11:54:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Tony_Robinson @ReasonCoffeeShp @redwater1 @SpaniardAC How Alex, may I ask why you chose to vote for #remain ? Genuinely interested.

For me, People being insulted, prejudiced against & made to be #inlimbo was #NeverInMyName & I stand by all our people - born, raised or staying #ThisIsOurHome

This is only my though & of course appreciate some might feel differently.

TBH, Im glad you raised this. Its important to face things like this & work together for change.  
952498211561918465 2018-01-14 11:10:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Roger_Powell79 @Mr_D_Happy @jake_001x This article from 8/2017 discusses the impact Brexit could have on Africa. Its important for the U.K. to create a good, honest deal with Africa. Why are UK supermarkets allowed to make cheaper variants of the Fair Trade products & stop trade with them?http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/08/03/how-brexit-could-harm-african-economies-that-trade-with-the-uk-and-disrupt-regional-integration/

952485544210165760 2018-01-14 10:20:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LBC With respect to Mr Farage, I am very concerned at him saying that people will have a 2nd referendum forced upon them. Mr Farage said shortly after the ref. result that mistakes were made  I felt lied to & tricked of my vote  This only my view, though. My respect to all.
952475759150551040 2018-01-14 09:41:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RettopNoj Indeed- if the Government is not  securing its promises then why is that we all have to stick by them (especially those literally left #inlimbo with their rights on the line) but the Government does not. Is it because it was Mr Cameron who made this promise as PM & not Mrs May?

952307717942710272 2018-01-13 22:33:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @realSi_jeff Why is buying a British product wanting to be Full Brexit?

952306005676908544 2018-01-13 22:26:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Roger_Powell79 @Mr_D_Happy I would like to know how you both got that leaflet when an additioner person other than me (a Presiding Officer in the elections) didnt get one either. Was this through the post?
952305653267255296 2018-01-13 22:25:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 Roger, I would like though to think that the link you used in the video is a good piece of evidence for many who voted leave & retain that view as to not have a 2nd referendum. My query would be that if I wasnt aware, many others may well not be as well & thats not our fault.
952304917871554560 2018-01-13 22:22:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 Again, I never received the leaflet of the document you kindly showed me. The video you showed me of then PM Cameron was not 1 I saw before the referendum. As Mr Cameron is no longer in charge & we now have a new PM with a still unclear view of Brexit, I still question it.
952299123830677507 2018-01-13 21:59:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 I never got this leaflet.
952299016234074112 2018-01-13 21:59:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 I never received or was told this. Honestly. Sadly (because it is sad - I actually I feel a little angry & very bad hearing about this), I doubt Im the only one. Not upset with you by any means & thanks for sharing this document  Why was this not widespread? 
952292678422749184 2018-01-13 21:34:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 Personally, I was not told that. That really shouldve been made v.clear. I felt I was asked 4 my opinion & that was that. Again, I must take ownership for what my vote but I dont ever remember being asked that directly or received any correspondence. Not at all.
952291796805185536 2018-01-13 21:30:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 Absolutely bizarre thing to have happened.  Again, very sad and sorry it happened- it shouldnt.
952291458085736449 2018-01-13 21:29:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mr_D_Happy @Roger_Powell79 Im very sad and sorry to have seen that but think its very important and brave that you showed that. That shouldnt happen whatsoever 
952290848330436608 2018-01-13 21:26:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Roger_Powell79 @Mr_D_Happy I feel that at the very least, I can voice as respectfully & clearly (I dont want cause problems if Im doing things in the wrong way) my thoughts & why I feel them whilst taking ownership of my choices. I dont anyone getting hurt because of me. Ironically, I feel I did that.

952286794699157504 2018-01-13 21:10:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKeithOHara Dont be sorry, dear friend. Brian- I just want to thank you for always being there and being an inspiring and brilliant person  I have a lot of affection for America and its people. Im sorry I have done anything to have upset you or any of the amazing American people 
952278055858397185 2018-01-13 20:35:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Roger_Powell79 My goodness! I honestly cannot fathom why you should have received any such treatment for any reason. There is no excuse - what you have experienced is completely wrong to me. Feel very sorry you have or  anyone may have experienced this. Its totally wrong. 
952190220279123969 2018-01-13 14:46:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Roger_Powell79 I am someone who voted Leave but has changed their stance. I can only answer in that capacity (& even at that, only for myself). For me, I did feel lied to & my actions have hurt millions now left in limbo by my decision & how they have & are being treated.
952183165057228800 2018-01-13 14:18:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Danosaur1 @Femi_Sorry @Roger_Powell79 For me, listening to Mr Farage who admitted of the mistakes made on promises made during the referendum made me like that. Just my view though.
952182999105376256 2018-01-13 14:18:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Danosaur1 @Femi_Sorry @Roger_Powell79 That sounds quite promising to me.
952159187097800704 2018-01-13 12:43:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Both those who conducted the protest & Mayor Khan did so peacefully. Imo, dont think an arrest is warranted whatsoever. Im sure President Trump would be happy by the gentlemens actions at the very least. Very impressed at how Mayor Khan  handled it all.https://news.sky.com/story/trump-supporters-demand-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-arrest-11205566

If you are then good for you. If not, how would you like Brexit to be carried out (ie no deal, negotiate deals to prioritise trade or security, etc). Honestly interested.

I must say that your words make me realise that  I should (& will) look more into that 1st referendum in the 1970s. It will help me understand people and the ethos of the time better. I still want to #remain democratically & in respect to all.

Even when PM May received a negative tweet from him, she still has backed him up. People are twisting things into untruths again.
951740980658655232 2018-01-12 09:01:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis With recent events, Mr Farage has a possibility to take on an extremely powerful role. His choice of words like people being forced to have a 2nd ref is encouraging people who voted Leave to think they are being oppressed & in turn are feeling quite upset. As is President ...

951599093058547713 2018-01-11 23:37:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @realDonaldTrump @erna_solberg @Channel4News It was nice hearing the  #NorwayPM & #POTUS in this - opportunities are there and it was so well discussed. #Norway really is an amazing place with amazingly clever people, as we know the #US is and has, too Beautiful points by the Norway PM, indeed.  
951592666201980930 2018-01-11 23:12:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Wonderful! Whoever the donor is, thank you https://twitter.com/i/moments/951559927658635264
951587824939266049 2018-01-11 22:53:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Nigel_Farage @just_polling The whole situation is one in which I feel wary about. When words like forced are used, I think it will make people who want to leave feel even more upset & angry. I want to #remain democratically & with everyone of all views to feel theyve been truly listened to.
951586545823375360 2018-01-11 22:48:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @InLimboBrexit @albawhitewolf An amazing book with equally amazing people with their stories

951582296234131456 2018-01-11 22:31:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @alancue7 We all had our reasons for voting how we did - there so much going on. Though my reasons were different for voting Leave, I totally respect your honesty. 
951578859606106112 2018-01-11 22:17:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MichelBarnier @guyverhofstadt There are lot of fake #FBPE accounts, profiles & people using the #FBPE hashtag & am very concerned at the hateful contents that are being shared using it. May I ask what youd advise people to do? I suggest we all check accounts b4 following others
951573870477275137 2018-01-11 21:57:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MLewisLawyer @BootstrapCook @Greg_Callus Congrats, Jack
951573226089517059 2018-01-11 21:55:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Helene_SWCP Thats awful to hear!  I just do not understand it.
951572834001793024 2018-01-11 21:53:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ReplabJohn Thank you.  Its happening so much at the moment - it worries me
951560198807793666 2018-01-11 21:03:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @AnnemarieKane1 @Danosaur1 I am a person who can make a mountain out of a molehill. Just feel unnerved by all this for everyone sake - on all views.
951558835172503554 2018-01-11 20:58:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @J_amesp And sadly more ... I am worried something is happening and its bad pic.twitter.com/oCc9RqMIvI
951558544695971840 2018-01-11 20:56:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> More #FBPE fake accounts & its really worrying what is being said by them  This is not right. Not at all.pic.twitter.com/t4f5i0v7rF
951557814295687168 2018-01-11 20:53:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LBC Something funny is going on with this - especially when @Nigel_Farage is saying that people are going to be forced to - this is creating a lot of anger & division again. I am sure I am being cynical and my apologies to Mr Farage for me thinking this way. Something is up though.
951556116923736065 2018-01-11 20:47:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @Danosaur1 @AnnemarieKane1 This whole situation feels like people are being played with to an extent. This could just be me being very cynical and hope so.
951544062380830721 2018-01-11 19:59:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BasildonHosp @SocialistVoice Wishing for your father and all of you the very best results possible and an extremely healthy year 
951541580586012672 2018-01-11 19:49:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Brexit I think this is being used as an opportunity to spread propaganda and an attempt to manipulate a disadvantage into an advantage. He is a clever man but I do feel very wary of this.
951541112883351553 2018-01-11 19:47:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LBC Is @Nigel_Farage using this as an opportunity to spread propaganda & (cleverly, I admit) manipulate people? @Femi_Sorry @Andrew_Adonis Please forgive my cynical nature, Mr Farage. Wishing you all the best.
951540208759164928 2018-01-11 19:43:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @J_amesp I agree. This will also make a lot of people who wish to leave feel very upset and unrepresented, meaning they will want to turn to parties which could take advantage. For Britain supporters & members have certainly been trying to infiltrate the #FBPE hashtagpic.twitter.com/kwvURDHwB6
951538998006173697 2018-01-11 19:39:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PJ_NUFC Truly hoping this lovely young lady is returned this vital equipment - I have 2 little ones with severe special educational needs. If I can retweet or do anything more, please just ask. That pic of her is lovely 
951524801595822087 2018-01-11 18:42:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Wow - thanks for sharing this @JulieOwenMoylan & @SarahKSilverman  Amazing 
951519297171574784 2018-01-11 18:20:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @Danosaur1 Thats a good point. It might seem unfair to some. The concept  of having a no deal option feels scary to me though 
951518448676372484 2018-01-11 18:17:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Danosaur1 @Femi_Sorry A good first start might be for everyone of all views to discuss this and from it have an agreed idea of what everyone finds acceptable and unacceptable.
951518150021001216 2018-01-11 18:16:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @Danosaur1 Thats my worry, too 
951518049483534342 2018-01-11 18:15:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @Andrew_Adonis @jennywoolf Thanks for sharing what you think 
951517959075368961 2018-01-11 18:15:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @weelynn77 For me, every1 should be listened to & asked collectively what people want. In regards to laws, Brexit & proposed plans for all in the U.K., I wanted all nations to be able to have an active, equal part of them being planned & made. I felt that didnt happen much at all, tbh 
951503771552624640 2018-01-11 17:19:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @weelynn77 @avrilmck56 Scotland has truly made some amazing laws and policies - ones to be proud of.
951503533395927040 2018-01-11 17:18:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @weelynn77 I do for my inability to help everyone feel valued and worry Scotland and our other nations have not been treated or listened to as much as they should be. This is only what I feel and my respect to everyone.
951502830929620993 2018-01-11 17:15:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP @Steviegrieve @brawday @weelynn77 I wanted for every nation to be empowered, listened to (really listened to) & valued - I worry not enough has been done for that to happen. I dont know how to best help everyone & feel cheeky to voice things.
951495907438223361 2018-01-11 16:47:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP @Steviegrieve @brawday @weelynn77 TBH, as I am from England I feel a lot of shame over the past and at things that have happened more recently for Scotland  My opinion is not really important - its what Scotland wants that matters 
951493478676094976 2018-01-11 16:38:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @PaoliMichele Forgive me for not saying this sooner but hello   Nice to meet you. 
951493184114298881 2018-01-11 16:37:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @PaoliMichele Its for people to decide what they choose to believe & thats a thing we all have to stand by. Its ensuring this time everyone has all the proven evidence-enforced facts & can choose based on knowing what this chosen form Brexit could be (still could be hard or no deal).
951492243591974913 2018-01-11 16:33:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP @Steviegrieve @brawday More should be done to show just much people think Scotland & indeed all the nations are  I respect your view - Scotland et al have been point in a difficult position. Sorry for sounding selfish in wanting things to be. Imo, we should have equal empowerment of all the nations
951485173979320321 2018-01-11 16:05:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis After hearing @Femi_Sorry & many others are discussing how to fairly do this so everyone on all sides can feel represented as a sorts in this, how we have a poss 2nd ref will be crucial. Would appreciate yours & everyones view to discuss this. My respect to you & everyone 
951482651365568512 2018-01-11 15:55:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @rantingkat @Femi_Sorry @NeilFlood24 I do agree with your findings - I dont know how to put those as options for people on a paper to vote on but I also dont want anyones voice to be ignored. Whatever we believe, we are all one people equally.
951466524413517824 2018-01-11 14:51:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Rachael_Swindon Im afraid you did x It is awful but hear its been stopped x

951465501296820225 2018-01-11 14:47:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JimMFelton Though Im not a fan of labelling people who wish to leave as a Brexiter, I did get this exact response from someone/somebot who said why hadnt Mr Khan tackled knife crime -  when I said Im happy to talk about knife crime & how to tackle it they then left the chat 
951463938084036609 2018-01-11 14:40:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @andreww1967 @JimMFelton @frozenwarning Very glad to hear that - the fact it was even though of worries me 
951461022199701504 2018-01-11 14:29:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry @Lorelei_174 Have reported him, too. His bio is just filled with hatred. Femi, you are doing a great job. This gent doesnt realise just how much you were keeping his and everyones views in balance with a proses 2nd ref.

951457885674004480 2018-01-11 14:16:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry If that is what some of my fellow country people truly want then on the condition the guarantees given to @The3Million & equally shared to @BritishInEurope & those equally affected then I would accept. All views are important and so are promises.
951456757183909888 2018-01-11 14:12:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews Awful to hear what they did to that girl 
951454889061879808 2018-01-11 14:04:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry An interesting suggestion to have no deal as an option at all - I do worry for @The3Million & @BritishInEurope how this would affect them as they would have even more insecurity. I know guarantees were given but how can this be enforced if there is a no deal. 
951454207160324097 2018-01-11 14:02:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP @Steviegrieve As much as as I appreciate why you and many may well feel like that, I want to be selfish & say stay x Scotland is certainly a big ray of hope to me as to how things could be - whatever happens and whatever Scotland chooses, thank you all. Always know many smile upon you 
951451561942712320 2018-01-11 13:51:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Femi_Sorry A very interesting point. This lady also raised a similar point - if we are all to have the chance the analyse Brexit as it is & based on the facts, how would everyone like it to be noted? What other options are there? What should a poss 2nd ref look like?https://twitter.com/smitajamdar/status/951448723086893056
951450125553029123 2018-01-11 13:46:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @smitajamdar Its a very interesting point
951444744697270273 2018-01-11 13:24:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Wanderer_RH Many people are expressing their upset at Mr Farage expressing his possible consideration of a 2nd referendum and are communicating a lot to For Britain.

951435508902780928 2018-01-11 12:47:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mikegalsworthy Agreed and well said!  I would like to say that there are also lots of groups on Twitter than are Pro European and under all the parties. The #FBPE community has been an amazing and compassionate one to me but I worry many are marginalised because of the party they are of.
951434695425888256 2018-01-11 12:44:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Matthew_Wright @Nigel_Farage @5WrightStuff I think a 2nd referendum would be a good idea, just my thoughts though. It means everyone can have a #FinalSay & unite us all. Im keen for a #FinalSayForAll
951432350205923328 2018-01-11 12:35:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @J_amesp Perfect suggestion
951432126066544641 2018-01-11 12:34:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AngryxGoat There are some amazing pro EU Labour groups out there like @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU , as well some great pro EU members, supporters, groups & MPs. There are also some great pro EU groups for the Conservatives land indeed all parties out there, too. For me, its great to see

Id like to, if thats okay.

Different groups of people seem to be doing them & have some variations. One I saw today was a For Britain supporter & seems like a genuine a real account, not a bot one.
951400505112170496 2018-01-11 10:28:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SadiqKhan @MayorofLondon @faisalislam @wisepoyet Good morning, Ian. Knife crime is a massive issue that need highlighting. What things do you think we can do to tackle it (genuinely interested)? I wont ignore you even though you think I will. Your emoji (though cute) is inaccurate. I chose to do no evil, not to ignore it.

Gen advice 4 all is to check peeps profiles b4 following & if unsure, mute & block them.
951397069809430528 2018-01-11 10:15:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JoRichardsKent @BrexitBin @damocrat @Kean1S @HereBeProof @AngryxGoat Being aware of the fake accounts is very important and It certainly doesnt deter me from te #FBPE hashtag.  Being forewarned is being forearmed with knowledge. Thanks for the interesting article and have a great day.
951396636131057664 2018-01-11 10:13:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AngryxGoat Hello Laura, can I ask (as I am silly) what does the #PCPEU hashtag mean? Genuinely interested and thank you

951219809072672769 2018-01-10 22:30:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc @Stu1986 Thanks for sharing your view
951218616342630400 2018-01-10 22:26:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @LabourOutOfScot I would like to hear more 
951199609782710272 2018-01-10 21:10:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc As long as I dont bore you too much with my random opinions and tweets, I dont mind at all.  I am very OTT & an utter geek though I think you probably can see that though, lol. Differences for me can mean greater understanding (though with an additional headache at times)
951198090358345728 2018-01-10 21:04:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NicolaSturgeon @LabourOutOfScot For me, I find Scotland, Northern Island, Wales, Gibraltar & many Ive not mentioned have been marginalised when we all should have had the best discussions on what we all want possible as the U.K. As much as I want unity, it is important all nations are valued & treated equally.
951156592145256454 2018-01-10 18:19:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Nigel_Farage @SHill150 @Femi_Sorry That does make sense
951142497530662913 2018-01-10 17:23:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mark_haddon This is so wrong 
951142357025640448 2018-01-10 17:23:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BritishInEurope @The3Million  #ThisIsOurHome equally. They made guarantees & that is exactly what you should be receiving - guarantees on your security and futures 
951141351093137408 2018-01-10 17:19:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @USAinUK It is very nice indeed
951138156375625730 2018-01-10 17:06:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @EalingSoNHS Its crazy.
951137308442595328 2018-01-10 17:03:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc Perhaps, there is more than just this that we have in common I would like to think that. I do not mind at all discussing topics together. I think many worry they will be labelled or get hurt if they do. Mutual respect like you have shown me & hopefully you feel vice-versa helps
951102212687659008 2018-01-10 14:43:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove Done and then some - if you need anything else, just ask 
951100214408089600 2018-01-10 14:35:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove Bless you - thank you  Anything we (who you are helping so much) can do to help you?
951099958702366722 2018-01-10 14:34:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc For me, you are only trying chat with me & we are discussing an important topic (I respectfully disagree about multiculturalism being wrong but that is just me). If I am doing something wrong, Im glad to learn of it & change it. I want to overcome obstacles, not make them.
951097659313573890 2018-01-10 14:25:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc Correction - I see there have been a few successful prosecutions now. Its a start.
951097234153725952 2018-01-10 14:23:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Ferretgrove Thank you!!! If you could do that for me, Id be so grateful!!
951096424564973568 2018-01-10 14:20:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @WhatNowDoc @NimkoAli That a great start - I so want to help everyone in this country and beyond.
951096156586758144 2018-01-10 14:19:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc 1/2 ... 1985 & yet there hasnt been 1 successful prosecution. If criminals are able to get away with things & see no consequences then crimes will reoccur #wrong The Gov needs to help protect people & help victims without creating scapegoats. We are all one nation - lets talk.
951095249803374592 2018-01-10 14:15:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc Im a part of a multicultural country, community & family. I find it unfair that communities are blamed collectively for individuals crimes & think cross-cultural discussions help at a root level for all. Those enforcing the law need to do more. FGM has been illegal since ... 1/2
951090502673293312 2018-01-10 13:57:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @BBCNews @graham_aspinall I certainly agree with you on that, Graham.
951089593775992832 2018-01-10 13:53:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc I dont see how raising the issue of FGM means anyone is a -ism. To me, you are just trying to protect females. You spoke with respect & though I guess Im considered to be a leftie, I dont see your words here being racist at all. We all (whatever side) together can help #EndFGM
951086074155225088 2018-01-10 13:39:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LSRPlaid @IanBlackfordMP @vincecable @CarolineLucas The alliance between you 4 is extremely exciting & I thank you all for giving someone like me a breath of fresh air 
951083749965524992 2018-01-10 13:30:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BritishInEurope @The3Million Can I ask if there has been any negotiations or talks arranged for those in Gibraltar? I feel they are being marginalised a lot as I dont hear much about them being discussed by officials 
951082875457343488 2018-01-10 13:26:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @BBCNews I dont like the way Prime Minister May challenges at times but Im glad she apologised promptly when hearing why the Shadow Education Secretary was absent.

Thanks.https://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/951064251241762817
951064251241762817 2018-01-10 12:12:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @spaceangel1964 I dont see how we can have a no deal option and not a no Brexit option as well. How can the Government ensure we guarantee citizen rights without a deal with the EU? Having no idea creates more #limbo  @BritishInEurope @The3Million @BremainInSpain @Open_Britain @BestForBritain

951059115861782530 2018-01-10 11:52:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mrjamesob @NimkoAli @WhatNowDoc I think we all on all sides have praise for the bravery of this lady to have come forward and told us her story. Being left, right, up or down, its important to look at the facts together in a balanced way & put those victimised 1st  Your compassion to the lady was nice, btw
951058423965200384 2018-01-10 11:49:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JOE_co_uk @NimkoAli What an amazing person you are - brave and moving 
951057319558868992 2018-01-10 11:45:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @english0161 Whats with all the numbers after your name, Mr English? It makes your account look like a fake profile or bot account. Just so you are aware. Though you took effort to explain your reasoning, can you truly say what those who follow Islam felt or feel 1st hand? Seems presumptuous
951054967837687809 2018-01-10 11:35:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TellMamaUK  Awful to hear #No2H8
951053275368914944 2018-01-10 11:29:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt @gergnoemi You have an amazing culture & a strong cultural identity - from the Great synagogue to the House of Terror, its very strong indeed. No one can take that away & in fact I think people want to learn more about it. How you feel is how you feel, but please keep having an open mind
951050057796775937 2018-01-10 11:16:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt @AgendaForReform Morning, Graham. For me, Immigration is the responsibility of the country those are applying to & it shouldnt be projected onto others. There are many countries where those who follow & dont follow Islam thrive together in peace & respect (I.e. Xian, Shaanxi Province, PRC).

951028522633613312 2018-01-10 09:50:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I dont blame society or the way it wants its wishes to be - Thats life. Whats important for me is that (with my life) when I believe there is something bad happening to our society, I then respectfully & clearly express why I feel so. I want to protect it, not neglect it.
951026879896674304 2018-01-10 09:44:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @NHS The NHS is amazing because of the hard work, dedication and heart that every person in it has put into its patients & duties - thanking you and everyone. I want to thank you and everyone for what you do

950358975257763840 2018-01-08 13:30:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @eurosluggard A gentleman who voted Leave and still wishes to do so told me this was one of the main reasons he still wants to leave. Can I ask where it is best for people to obtain facts on this? Thank you 
950355530060574721 2018-01-08 13:16:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis Mr Farage is acting very defensively & sounds concerned. You only expressed views like mine.

950324177529180160 2018-01-08 11:11:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @Yahooyarry1 I respect people for whatever way they chose to vote and feel that if many want to vote again based on facts, thats fine with me.
950323608550871040 2018-01-08 11:09:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @BrexitBot52 Dave, as you are a person who describes themselves as right wing in their bio, can I ask what do you mean by right wing & ad the U.K. is a multicultural country () with some of the best cities in the world & Brexit is meant to mean a Global Britain, do you feel ok with it?
950320799436738560 2018-01-08 10:58:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @BrexitBot52 I love the U.K. & love Europe. Ive no problem hearing your thoughts, respectful sharing of ideas is good. Everyones view is equally important to me. Wanting to vote now based on us actually knowing the facts ensures everyone knows what they are voting for & not on mistakes.

950309856308842498 2018-01-08 10:15:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @InLimboBrexit @Snorrarcisco This is stunning!
950309633226395648 2018-01-08 10:14:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis As Mr Farage was brave enough to admit mistakes were made in promises made to Leave voters after the referendum, Im surprised he didnt acknowledge your fair & sensible point. Giving people options empowers better decisions and unity, saying people are lying creates division

950305618094632961 2018-01-08 09:58:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis @TeresaC123 Sorry for the misunderstanding 
950302758577389568 2018-01-08 09:46:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @markpolitics4uk Its a good question. As we are still in the EU, why not tell our MEPs of your concerns &/or what options you would like? Its a good way to know a possible answer. Your views are important & even if Brexit occurs, you would be helping others who may well feel the same as you.
950301131598712832 2018-01-08 09:40:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean @SKZCartoons @SoftDvil I feel sad that I understood, lol However did things like that ever get printed? Oh well, to each their own.
950300326996905986 2018-01-08 09:37:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt @HelenRushby1 If there is a no deal option then it is only balanced for nearly half of those that voted that there is a no Brexit option, too.
950299935412498432 2018-01-08 09:35:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis @TeresaC123 Just want to thank you for your tweet & bravery in expressing what you feel. I am a #RemainerNow as well & you represented what I wanted to say so much better than I could. Thanking you Teresa & indeed Lord Adonis

950281861170974720 2018-01-08 08:23:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JoRichardsKent @GMB @PoetTaxiDriver Exactly hence why I thought in voting Leave wed stay in them but this did not happen #NotInMyName
950281678135746561 2018-01-08 08:23:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @quantumhealer1 I think if MPs of all parties were involved right away then it would have made things better - I agree. Sadly, it did not happen. 
950281267613978625 2018-01-08 08:21:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @John133493 @KellyBeard21 Good morning and thanks first of all for sharing what you think. I feel it was not clear when Mr Farage said a couple of days later on TV that mistakes were made in regards to some of the points made by the Leave Campaign.
950280778147094532 2018-01-08 08:19:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @rmelling007 I respectfully disagree but wish you a great week.
950280385644171264 2018-01-08 08:17:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @Yahooyarry1 We are your people, regardless of what views we all have. I just am listening to you because your happiness is as important to me as mine & I want to understand everyones view as best I can. This is I appreciate my personal stance alone but think hearing all views creates unity.
950279492894908416 2018-01-08 08:14:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @phenshall I respectfully disagree - voting based on the full facts & knowledge of what Brexit is seems sound to me. Respecting yours and everyones views & have a great day.
950279110538027008 2018-01-08 08:12:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @karenwales66 I admire your confidence & as someone who is glad that @Andrew_Adonis represented someone like me, I also share that confidence in him. Have an amazing day, Karen.
950278840521252864 2018-01-08 08:11:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @rmelling007 I respectfully disagree- he represents how I and many feel.
950278699789770752 2018-01-08 08:11:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @tatsorted1 Forgive me, but he did not. He actually made had an opposite affect upon me. Have a good day.
950278069201326080 2018-01-08 08:08:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis @GMB @jonnygould For me, we already are in the modern world. Have a good day. Sir, respectfully disagreeing with your view but emphasise my respect to you.
950277813868879872 2018-01-08 08:07:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @BrexitBot52 I respectfully disagree, Dave. Your view is yours to have  Many #inlimbo as a result of the vote but respect it & love the country enough to stay. I want to protect all here - born, raised or stayed as #ThisIsOurHome #equally & the chance of a no deal gives many worries.
950276747316088832 2018-01-08 08:03:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @LoulouCG I on the other hand originally voted Leave believing from Vote Leave wed stay in the SM, CU & would debate our presence in the ECJ at the most but as time passed many points made during the referendum were stayed to be mistakes  & many people are #inlimbo - I want to #remain
950275841799413760 2018-01-07 07:59:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GMB @Lifelandlady Sensible way to view having a vote based on the facts.
950275486806085632 2018-01-07 07:58:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @EU_Commission @BritishInEurope @The3Million For me, if there is a no deal option then there needs to be a no Brexit option, too. #Remain

949919982317645829 2018-01-07 08:25:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may 2/2 As we all now have a better idea of what Brexit is, I think that it is important for the public to vote on it again. Thanks for listening and have a good Sunday. I want to #remain and truly wish you well.
949918198346010624 2018-01-07 08:18:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may I feel that you are being made to be a scapegoat when many before you have made decisions which have led to some of the sad situations we have at present. You can stop these things happening though. Please fund our services more & protect those who need support. 1/2

949770600943443969 2018-01-06 22:32:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @fgr62 I must say I agree - I was trying not to sound too negative & that was the only positive thing I could think of at the time (I stretched the boundaries for that positive too much, perhaps).

949769507739963392 2018-01-06 22:27:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt @EU_Commission There are sadly many fake profiles & accounts that are trying to sabotage the #FBPE community (awareness of them means we can deter them). Could we help people know how to spot fake accounts? Plus, can we possibly investigate who are doing this?

949764825948807175 2018-01-06 22:09:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> And another fake #fbpe troll person who thinks that EU and Ewe are interchangeable - witty but I think the one who is trying to join a group they dont believe in are def not wolves in sheep clothing but are sheepish to just say how they feel & hide it. Id respect honesty more.pic.twitter.com/sxUY8CDXvc
949754653415235584 2018-01-06 21:28:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Another fake #FBPE account who even has as his background a tweet calling him a troll. I found his pic rather more pleasant than the image of a troll - hope he doesnt have low self-esteem.pic.twitter.com/sqwInHjNjL
949753099836690432 2018-01-06 21:22:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @albawhitewolf There are a lot of fake accounts & people who are trying to attack the #FBPE family.

949425885651853312 2018-01-05 23:42:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @unknown00047 Who do you think played better?   Virgil won Liverpool that game (nice debut) but I liked how Everton played regardless of the result. Im still not too sure about the penalty. Anyway, wishing you again a good night & hope I can hear about your views on footie & other things.

TBH, I am interested in asking you how you feel the football game is going and who you support. That pic you gave me a sense of who you are & its sad the comment ruined it a bit. Anyway, thanks for everything
949399140685008896 2018-01-05 21:56:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 I have and will do my best to trust in everyone but unlike the person I was in the past, I will build that trust up & not do so blindly. I mean that. The EU, the U.K. & many have bad points & I think with insights like yours we could within the EU rectify them. This is just IMO.

In comparison, yours are very much based on not liking the EU & Im glad you are saying why you 1/2
949389894979289096 2018-01-05 21:19:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @unknown00047 Again, yes. I studied English as my major so please be rest assured on that (though I admit my typos & spelling mistake can be truly awful). You seem quite upset, angry and defensive to what I am saying. Why? Im certainly not upset with you.
949389033217589248 2018-01-05 21:15:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 You said I was sprouting crap. I am not accusing you but do not like being told things that are not true & you did try to belittle me earlier as well. More importantly, Im interested to know more about what your reasons are for not liking the EU.
949388087838330881 2018-01-05 21:12:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 Thanks for the reply. Your view is yours to have. What things in particular make you feel this way?
949387652545044480 2018-01-05 21:10:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Why is crap informing someone who entitled themselves without a name, has lots of numbers it, acts defensively, & that by saying they live in The Great Britain & not use the more common phraseology Great Britain or The U.K. that the account looks fake? It looks like it.https://twitter.com/unknown00047/status/949382124188127232

949385694304235520 2018-01-05 21:02:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 To know who you are speaking to is important and I think you have a good enough vocabulary to not need the usage of vulgar words. Why do you want to insult me? Is there really a need of a difference of opinion? Seems unusual to me.
949385250001641475 2018-01-05 21:00:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 Thank for the picture (I do like football). Im very curious though as to why youve to have taken offence to friendly advice.

949377063710085120 2018-01-05 20:28:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @RemainerNow @unknown00047 I was paying attention to Vote Leave (who did promise this), my MP & discussed this a lot with family & friends.

949279413237108738 2018-01-05 14:00:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Baddiel Hello David, I just want to say what an incredibly witty and good man you are. I dont know why some ... people are acting so hatefully towards you - its wrong and I stand with you. #No2H8
949277472494882817 2018-01-05 13:52:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @labour @ejectamenta_com @AndyBodle Nice info 
949277417171976192 2018-01-05 13:52:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @labour @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com Nicely sourced. Thank you.
949277279082991616 2018-01-05 13:51:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @labour @ejectamenta_com @AndyBodle Thank you both for getting such great info  I can see how clarity on these things would be awesome. Could the law be written in a way so countries wouldnt need to manoeuvre around it & ease understanding for people? Confusion is a thing that can be remedied, as you 2 prove
949268985031380992 2018-01-05 13:18:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MuseumsAssoc @NicolaRHughes @CamUnivMuseums I absolutely think museums change lives - its the Terracotta Army museum that meant I met my hubby  Having a place where we can all learn and appreciate things together crates a #Utopia for us all
949268436898734080 2018-01-05 13:16:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JEF_de @WhyEuropeORG @laute_europaeer Agreed x

949267846017748992 2018-01-05 13:14:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JWils60 No worries x Love those petitions in there 
949267738471608321 2018-01-05 13:14:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus For me, I dont. It can be quite challenging facing cultural differences but seeing things from different perspectives teaches us so much, builds bonds, creates closeness & IMO there is so much to gain (possibly a headache at times but we can nurse each other) & nothing to loose
949266430335340544 2018-01-05 13:08:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @OnaliEnrico @1daywithoutus I had the opposite experience when I lived in China. It is massive, so many people everywhere - impressive yet totally overwhelming. I do love China & I adore my U.K. too!  
949265634113794049 2018-01-05 13:05:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @OnaliEnrico @1daywithoutus My husband has had that experience, too.
949265517956796418 2018-01-05 13:05:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus My husband is from China and even now when we chat to friends in the U.K. from China, I am still called a foreigner (no offence is meant in any way & none is taken). It does make me eye roll a lot, giggle and I point it out we all laugh over it.
949264734926311424 2018-01-05 13:02:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus For me, we all have varied and awesome backgrounds - thats a healthy thing. Its a happy thing. Its an awesome thing .

949263014267703296 2018-01-05 12:55:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis @TheStephenRalph That would certainly be undemocratic whilst destabilising & undermining our country & its ways if true.

949238610074750976 2018-01-05 11:18:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ejectamenta_com @AndyBodle I think you both are making Twitter become that sound place for debate and talk based on facts already  Thanks  Its one of the reasons I want us all to #remain - I really believe in us and feel that we are not 1 in 28 in the EU but OF the 28 countries in the EU #EU28
949237850259820545 2018-01-05 11:15:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @labour @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com Are we the only country to share those concerns or worries though? I keep thinking that if we have better communication with every1 in the EU on a massive, visible scale then at the very worst we just learn from each other, build bonds & loose nothing. We all have much in common
949236621488029696 2018-01-05 11:10:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com For me, I want to #remain because of the way people have been treated since #Brexit began. When people are getting hurt (emotionally, physically & verbally) & made to feel segregated against then thats wrong. People for me come 1st & we are all equal. No them and us - just #us
949235651303628801 2018-01-05 11:06:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com My concern in doing that is that we are not addressing what many who wish to leave are worried about. Why dont we use the passion we all have to discuss them as Europeans in the way I think many of us want - a calm, factual & open way? I have confidence in all of us.
949234934966833152 2018-01-05 11:03:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Still_I_Rise_GT No worries 
949234838749569026 2018-01-05 11:03:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @dodgemeisterT My pleasure
949234297986256896 2018-01-05 11:01:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com I think that is something we all want  Different views can be healthy and I think we all want the best for each other (I definitely sound like Pollyanna here, lol). My view is mine as yours as ours. I want to act appropriately on concerns so we can all be happy.
949233653514727425 2018-01-05 10:58:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com Personally (this is only my opinion), I feel many of amazing scientists & health professionals are being marginalised, at times insulted & massively underfunded. There are many people as you say who respect scientists & health professionals but how wish those in power did.

949227769589850112 2018-01-05 10:35:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jeremy_Hunt @doctor_oxford @Pdc1956Peter Interesting idea. Its sad it has to come to that but certainly you suggest a very sensible option.
949226450510647296 2018-01-05 10:29:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @J_amesp I wouldnt say that but absolutely respect your view. I do feel though that I have quite profound concerns as to how it is dealing with certain key issues. Enough to ensure my concerns are grave indeed.
949226034951532546 2018-01-05 10:28:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jeremy_Hunt @doctor_oxford Well said, Dr Clarke 
949225091224801280 2018-01-05 10:24:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AndyBodle @ejectamenta_com Forgive me, but as you say maybe brexit is a conclusion of them, but who knows. If we keep to the facts & as you say stop trying (to) label everything bad as either faults of the EU or Brexit then 2gether we can get gr8 results. Imo, its to #remain & challenge worries within

949212168817397760 2018-01-05 09:33:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Andrew_Adonis  For me, I want to ensure everyone has the opportunity to discuss together their concerns & desired outcomes based on the facts - I conclude to #remain & tackle issues is best. I want no more actions based on mistakes or assumptions as to what the will of the people is.
949207572984291329 2018-01-05 09:14:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCr4today @Open_Britain @theRCN For me, I have witnessed 1st hand how much you value our international and national nurses and health professionals. How can any of this be true?

I want to take ownership of my mistakes and rather than just say sorry, act appropriately. Too many people of all ages have been hurt by this & thats #NotInMyName (1 person is 1 too many)

948916209025798144 2018-01-04 13:57:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford If you are happy then its good there is a positive. I would just like everyone equally to be as happy (I know its idealistic & childish but its well-intentioned). Your point was made with facts and not untruths.
948915788299358208 2018-01-04 13:55:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford You were exceedingly kind, tbh.  No need to apologise and Im glad I apologised for making the error anyway. You arent ignoring anything & I appreciate it must be very frustrating. I want to thank you for tweeting to me. I really would like the EU to hear your point though 
948914931151376384 2018-01-04 13:52:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SadiqKhan @redpilldanny @pyr0tic @VonHitchofen Why are you so interested in Mayor Khan if you dont live in the City? London is an amazing and great place to live. I heartily recommend it. Regardless though, if you truly have any suggestions then Im sure hed hear you out.https://twitter.com/vonhitchofen/status/948717695184326656
948911564408664066 2018-01-04 13:38:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @redpilldanny @TheRebelQuotes @numb15 Agreed, Ian
948910518705770501 2018-01-04 13:34:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford I also sadly see many people have been marginalised & treated in a very negative and nasty way based on where they are from, who they are or what they believe. When we look at how I was mocked for a typographical error, I could take it but it was meant to belittle me for my view.
948909456112406530 2018-01-04 13:30:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford I dont personally feel afraid of leaving but am disappointed at how the reasons I voted leave for became mistakes or were proved false accusations. Your past point is one I accepted & on that Id like to do something about whilst we can. I dont feel afraid of being in the EU.
948908763414659072 2018-01-04 13:27:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tomhigham28 @ClareAdams @lesleyanne14 Bless you x I agree x
948901587291959297 2018-01-04 12:59:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford In regards to global trade for the U.K., we did good whilst being in the EU, too. The golden era with China still looks good & many plans are being made by China for the U.K. but still as the U.K. being in the EU. For me, its the way Brexit is happening that really upsets me.
948897161802145798 2018-01-04 12:41:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @lesleyanne14 @tomhigham28 @RobertaRamsay2 I have  Thank you x
948897099143434240 2018-01-04 12:41:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tomhigham28 @ClareAdams @lesleyanne14 I want to apologise too, Clare. My apologies to you for causing this situation and I want to more than compensate and say sorry - I want to stand to protect you and your family  Lesley, I am sorry for you having to apologise alone like that.
948896426423177217 2018-01-04 12:38:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford For me, your experiences and input have value and I think it would be good for them to be heard by those who can act on them & not just a person like me. If an ordinary person like me can see your point, surely more able ones than I can, too.
948895328568266753 2018-01-04 12:34:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @drbenwhite I cannot imagine the distress and pain they are all going through - @Jeremy_Hunt Please, help fund and save our our people & NHS. Please.
948893898054696961 2018-01-04 12:28:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford Thanks for sharing this. I wonder if this point could be raised with the EU council as by raising awareness to it and being in the EU we could get a positive result for all.
948893331647590400 2018-01-04 12:26:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus I am outraged & have and will keep standing by everyone in this situation as #ThisIsOurHome #Equally #no2h8

948889304570482688 2018-01-04 12:10:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jackguinness It is an interesting letter to have read & I thank @Andrew_Adonis for sharing it (for me, a brave thing to have done). Personally, I think @theresa_may is doing what she thinks is will of the people - the problem is Brexit was not defined & means different things to everyone
948885314436763648 2018-01-04 11:54:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Janndeman Whenever & if you wish (my typo may well mean you dont want to respond, ha ha), may I ask what your view is on Brexit and what you would ideally like it to achieve?
948884801863520256 2018-01-04 11:52:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @481Dunford I was wondering if I could ask you about some of your experiences and how its shaped your views on Brexit. You have a lot of experience living abroad & am interested in hearing your take on things. Please dont feel obliged to respond if you dont want to.

948841058443710465 2018-01-04 08:58:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ledredman This is interesting. Imo, many will find this so on both sides for many reasons. Why wasnt this done before & why is this being done now? I want peeps to vote for what they truly want, whatever that may be. I want to #remain & want it to be democratically so. My respect to all.

Id like to look more at the amazing works European scientists do #together

I felt tricked, tbh.

943891085780234240 2017-12-21 17:09:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YangheeLeeSKKU @UNHumanRights @UN It is very worrying and concerning
943890852971245570 2017-12-21 17:08:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @Stoorie2 I think that quote in your bio about going further if we work together is brilliant. So many people from Poland, Europe & all over the world who are in the U.K. have experienced horrible abuse from horrible people. For me #thisisourhome #equally & I stand with everyone #no2h8
943884441944035329 2017-12-21 16:42:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may @PolishEmbassyUK I look forward to the U.K. working closer with Poland
943863189472673792 2017-12-21 15:18:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @theresa_may There is something about you that is so impressive. I wish the comments made about homelessness & children the other day had not been made (maybe could you rectify them?) but find your meeting in Poland today positive. Merry Christmas

943112712564994048 2017-12-19 13:36:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MGOUFC For me, dont get why many find the HMS Queen Elizabeth a bad thing. So much money has been cut from MOD which should not have happened and I think its a very cleverly built ship that will benefit everyone. Money is a big factor, I know and appreciate that.

We are all 1 people. IMO, the vote mans we can all express our views fairly, respectfully & democratically

943045591180988416 2017-12-19 09:09:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> There are lots of extreme tweets of all descriptions on here, as are their equivalents on other main steam mediums and social mediums. For me, extremism is wrong and very hurtful. #no2h8 I am glad monitoring is happening.
943044329983102976 2017-12-19 09:04:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @wef It certainly is making people in the UK seriously think of this important matter. If this is handled well, researched fully into and implemented then this could be a way all countries could turn one mans trash into one mans treasure.

Is it because our country benefited from it as well (terribly)? I would argue that the U.K. is therefore equally as protectionist.

942570640955117574 2017-12-17 01:42:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @realbencovfefe I am afraid I must retire but thank you for an interesting and informative exchange #MerryChristmas I know I have different views & am glad of the way you spoke of me. Thank you 
942570109390016513 2017-12-17 01:40:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Wow - the UK did well from it sadly when I looked under the statistics. 
942567594992783361 2017-12-17 01:30:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce The EU and U.K. have and are still doing some amazing things together.
942564867927609344 2017-12-17 01:19:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce I agree that people should get good and fair money for the good work they do 
942564509578878978 2017-12-17 01:17:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Are we referring to free trade deals which remove import tariffs as well? If so, we are continuing them as well after Brexit.  Ethiopia is included in this. The article is by the BBC.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40395742
942562291148578822 2017-12-17 01:08:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Thank you.

We continue to want to see the rule of law upheld, the Spanish constitution respected & Spanish unity preserved. I felt Mr Tusk showed worry for Catatonia when he spoke of his hope(s) for argumenthttps://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/923914819631271936
942560646029348865 2017-12-17 01:02:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Actually, I felt the UK & many places in the EU gave a similar responses. A spokesperson for Mrs May said: The U.K. does not & will not recognise the Unilateral Declaration of Independence made by the Catalan regional parliament. It is based on a vote that was declared ... 1/2
942559419501604865 2017-12-17 00:57:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce As I said though, I am greedy & a dreamer.
942556713852469250 2017-12-17 00:46:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Im afraid I dont know enough about the trade barriers that you say the EU is putting on African companies but would like to gather some info so I can talk to you better about it.
942556074162446336 2017-12-17 00:44:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @HansOlafHenkel @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce We are right now part of the EU & are negotiating something that most feel threatening to it. Both sides are being business-like but I feel (just my feelings) a kinship & want the best for every1. Catalonia feels to me similar to Scotland & I dont understand why people got hurt
942554573037887488 2017-12-17 00:38:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Its protected Irelands rights quite nicely. I also see that local businesses in my area may close because they are loosing key workers of all levels  We are all equal in my eyes, people who came here & made livelihoods here, some longer than I have been alive. I value them.
942553256714293249 2017-12-17 00:33:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce It is a shame that there are such complications  I just dont want anyone to be in limbo when we all want the best possible. Though the words by them all (EU and U.K.) are to certain and varying extents okay in patches, I am concerned. For me, people come before politics.
942552347292598272 2017-12-17 00:29:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce As I say, Mr Junkers words were hard  @HansOlafHenkel has been very kind amongst other people & nations within the EU (thanks ).I would also sadly say that Prime Minister May during the general election saying Let me fight for Britain (fight?) was a little aggressive.
942549636589457408 2017-12-17 00:18:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce If we have to adhere to certain parts of the ECJ (I have not seen any stipulations by the UK gov or EU council as to which ones@theyll be yet) wouldnt it be harder as the ECJ can intervene? For example, if it is felt that the U.K. for some reason is constraining citizens rights?
942547997761724416 2017-12-17 00:12:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TannerPryce In article 50, Sir Barrow set 7 key principles for  as it entered talks. 1 was to engage constructively & respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation & another to put citizens first. Do you think this has & was done? @The3Million & @BritishInEurope ?
942546129002082304 2017-12-17 00:04:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @1daywithoutus @raywolst Id enjoy that 
942546014526984193 2017-12-17 00:04:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce I dont think the EU is perfect, as with all things. Personally, I feel I didnt know enough the EU during the ref (I dont have your expertise but am actively learning). People are very important to me & for individuals & families to be scared of their future (for me) is wrong.
942544060383973376 2017-12-17 23:56:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce I really appreciate your argument. You are very well-rounded Could this be done now whilst still being in the EU or if leaving, staying in the SM & CU? Just asking and I am sorry I am boring you.
942543559965708288 2017-12-17 23:54:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce It is a complex issue. One in which I think the remedy would not only help the U.K. but the EU, too. I am speaking quite simply but to me, when we know one solution for one place is not a solution for another, could we ensure whilst being in the EU this much needed balance?
942540107525050370 2017-12-17 23:40:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce I was a little concerned as I mentioned elsewhere to you about the changes in overtime and workers rights. Though it would increase much needed productivity, I dont want it to be in detriment to peoples health. Sorry if this is rambling. I am interested in your thoughts.
942539380136251393 2017-12-17 23:37:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce By the way, loved you saying forever. Im a dreamer and liked it very much 
942539233411117059 2017-12-17 23:37:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Didnt you say though until 2028? What happens after that? Will there be changes? More limbo? Our Gov & parties have some clever people in them. As time passes, hopefully they will actually discuss what Brexit is wanted & formally write it down. It worries me this wasnt done.
942537482582753280 2017-12-17 23:30:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce For me, I just dont get why the U.K. hasnt (as you have quite nicely written) fully shown that local power or for me, that local & international compassion that the U.K. is great at doing. Why are we leaving so much & many #inlimbo ? The EU isnt. We can do more than this.
942536240720687104 2017-12-17 23:25:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TannerPryce Being greedy, I wish it was longer  Thanks for the reference. Its from the EU, isnt it? The one they wrote? Where is it written by the U.K.? Have they written as was stated their plan to ensure @The3Million @BritishInEurope & all those I havent covered are secure?
942535337900900352 2017-12-17 23:21:50 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce The deportation regulations are ones that I think need serious looking at (for EU and non-EU members).
942533891893747714 2017-12-17 23:16:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Local democracy can be strong, indeed. So can broadening it. Balance for me is key. The changes in worker rights regarding overtime seems interesting. The ECJ would protect these rights but the countrys productivity would increased (though at the cost of peoples health).
942533281010143232 2017-12-17 23:13:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce Agreed.
942533142098989058 2017-12-17 23:13:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce ... to the ECJ. I know that many people would argue why leave if we are having to do this and would it stipulate the rights of those of British nationality in Europe? Not to discuss this with the individuals it affects seems strange whilst the EU has.https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/941955805171060737
942532493705666560 2017-12-17 23:10:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce The guarantee I can certainly see has been said assuredly until 2019. Its after this date Im concerned a bit. Mr Hammond said in a word, yes when asked if China & traders are to expect a transition deal where the U.K. is still participating in the SM, CU & poss subject... 1/2
942527476860948480 2017-12-17 22:50:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @BritishInEurope @TannerPryce I am also finding that power may not be (this is only my opinion & I may well be wrong) the thing the U.K. is lacking. I keep wondering why didnt previous govs invest more in the country, its borders, regulations & infrastructure when we could have? I love the U.K. - we all do.
942526383032594432 2017-12-17 22:46:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TannerPryce I respect your wants. Sadly, I am finding that locally, some people are not being treated equally. My example, the EU is wanting to protect citizen rights for both @BritishInEurope & @The3Million & has met with them but Mr D Davis hasnt even met them, despite Mrs Mays guarantee

942506937815617536 2017-12-17 21:28:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @IainDale @sandieshoes Respectfully, I would say the EU is very concerned about its citizens inside the U.K. & those of British nationality in mainland Europe. Though Mrs May has verbally guaranteed EU citizen rights in the U.K. () , its taken a long time & has not been formally written or acted on.

942366909240049670 2017-12-17 12:12:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @_HenryBolton Hello, Sir. I noticed your tweet & of course the response the petition has had with many people in the U.K. I was wondering why those who signed arent (a) happy Brexit is now in phase 2 or (b) wanting negotiations for the best deal possible? Honestly interested.https://twitter.com/_henrybolton/status/942157657909137408

942363127370395648 2017-12-17 11:57:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean @helenrcaton @sandieshoes I must say, I feel more & more as time passes that the best deal for UK would be to remain. This is only my opinion but I am a dreamer, after all  Being positive. Brexit has been a thing that has made me learn more about my country, the EU & more importantly the people in both
942361981432074242 2017-12-17 11:52:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean @helenrcaton @sandieshoes By the way, thanks for your comment.
942361871482605568 2017-12-17 11:52:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean @helenrcaton @sandieshoes We (in the U.K.) are & will remain European. If you are referring to the EU & the money the UK & EU are negotiating, I just want the best deal for both. One of the key issues for me about Brexit is the way its been carried out the way it (millions on both sides left in limbo).
942332002077954048 2017-12-17 09:53:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Very saddened to hear that more MPs & their families has been receiving death threats, hateful & disgusting messages ... there is no excuse for this outrageous & extreme behaviour - #no2h8 No to hate in all its forms to anyone.

I just feel #thisisourhome #equally & its made me appreciate the Britain & European I was born as 
941655881405616128 2017-12-15 13:07:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AbrahamEricWitt Would you say that this man is accurately portraying your views? Just trying to clarify to get a better understanding. I can feel his frustration and upset - he felt condescended to and betrayed by politicians. If so, it seems many from both sides feel similar.
941654590185005056 2017-12-15 13:02:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean @helenrcaton I appreciate that  We are a nice family 
941652400431038465 2017-12-15 12:53:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean We are European though - family as well as friends. Right now, we are negotiating leaving and though both the UK and EU have their faults, they both have created amazing things together too.
941651806580625410 2017-12-15 12:51:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TheNewEuropean Me too  But please know there  are many amazing politicians here though. I personally felt tricked of my vote & blame myself for not understanding or valuing you or Europe as much as I though I did. I am sorry  I thought we would stay in the Single Market, Customs Union & ECJ

I feel we have & are deliberately being separated  from each other as a society when we need each other so much. Like you, I want to #remain together, with respect & democratically.
941236964120023040 2017-12-14 09:22:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @greycells @SkyNews I completely agree @Anna_Soubry You voted what you felt was what your constituents wanted. Regardless of what you voted for, to me, thats what democracy is all about. It builds my trust in politics. The @Conservatives should be very proud of you & all who voted  #thankyou #trustpic.twitter.com/3NJcyccnhz
941235791463944192 2017-12-14 09:17:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mikegalsworthy I am very proud of them. I am proud of all the MPs (regardless of how they voted) who voted knowing it was what their constituents wanted. I feel sad at the pressure being exerted on all at the @HouseofCommons The result shows to me the reinforcement of democracy & builds trust.
941232945217654784 2017-12-14 09:06:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jamesmatesitv We are all EU citizens - to insult each other is just to insult ourselves. Besides, whatever we all think, its strange to be hostile towards people who have chosen & created livelihoods & families here. I just to thank every1 4 being here & want all to be happy  #

That was why I thought wed stay in them. In regards to the ECJ, I heard varying opinions  and plans in regards to negotiating or leaving it. I hoped we would at least negotiate.
941230084878426112 2017-12-14 08:55:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @john196201 You were so kind to me. Wishing you a lovely day and many thanks 
941229976711565312 2017-12-14 08:54:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @john196201 Thank you. I did email my MP, Sir Amess. Sadly for me, he is chair on the Brexit committee (he is a very good politician - we just have differences in our views on things like it. His view also greatly influenced my vote for Leave - my vote though was my fault) 
941081987061813251 2017-12-13 23:06:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guyverhofstadt Your words convey how much you care.

It makes me feel easier to trust you all in the work you do 
941077699925331968 2017-12-13 22:49:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SODEMAction @faisalislam @asymetricjockey @corrydes @RemainingKind Thank you for doing what you do and for the invite 
941076306615259136 2017-12-13 22:44:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @faisalislam @RemainingKind @asymetricjockey @corrydes Exactly! Thank you for finding that - this did play a big role in helping me sway to voting Leave. I just couldnt understand why we would even contemplate leaving the SM (or the CU & ECJ for that matter) when he said this  I trusted too easily & too much. So sorry everyone.

941043084179263490 2017-12-13 20:32:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> My thanks to all of the MPs who voted regarding #Amendent7 today. The pressure mustve been awful & that in itself is sad. The result certainly pleases me & I now put my trust in your hands @Conservatives @TheGreenParty @UKLabour @LibDems @theSNP @scottishlabour & Independent MPs
941041010968231941 2017-12-13 20:23:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @albawhitewolf ... 2/2 How would everyone feel if we created an award (a virtual one even - a pic of a star) called the The 28th Golden Star Award or Golden Star Award which we can tweet or post to the people who we feel have made an amazing contribution or who we feel is just Golden?

I dont want to bore you with me dribbling on - I just dont see things that way at all. I do appreciate you are taking a lot of effort to tell me what you think and that I truly mean appreciate. Btw, Merry Xmas.

941033225878634496 2017-12-13 19:52:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @InLimboBrexit @The3Million @David84363568 For me, there is no real them - its us. Homelessness is a big issue thats important to talk about. The gov certainly (not just the current one) seems to have put the blame of not investing in the country onto others.
941031149375311872 2017-12-13 19:44:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @InLimboBrexit @The3Million @David84363568 Please see below & dont feel pressured to answer anything though. Heaven knows, we all get enough of that. For me, #ThisIsOurHome #equally & many families are #inlimbo & have experienced many harsh things. Its wrong.

I know its easy to say and things take time. We have all been experiencing many things - those things can bring us all together equally and make us stronger.
941029170313940992 2017-12-13 19:36:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @InLimboBrexit @The3Million @David84363568 Thats sad to hear. For me, Brit born, raised or staying - every1 here is a part of our society & our communities. To say homelessness (many are not just from England) is due to just 1 part of our society when we know gov funding has been massively reduced is unfair to us all.

940680058003476487 2017-12-12 20:29:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AidenHatfield It looks like it will be amazing 
940679223420874754 2017-12-12 20:26:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SW11simon @SadaeChris @RebetikoWalrus Hello!  
940679060321193984 2017-12-12 20:25:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SadaeChris @SW11simon Thank you again, Simon 
940669461320884224 2017-12-12 19:47:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris Thanks for clarifying that
940656044958736385 2017-12-12 18:54:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris Would you mind if I followed you and everyone we have spoken to on this? Everyone, thank you x To those who defended me and talked to me, many thanks xxx
940655370153988096 2017-12-12 18:51:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris A valid point. Its an emotive topic as well for all of us & many are doing that regardless of how we view Brexit. That tweet that you retweeted I felt was sensationalist to an extent. I want to thank you for making me be a bit more aware of what I choose to retweet- Ill do that
940654627967651841 2017-12-12 18:48:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris For me, I wanted to give it a chance for this reason and I think many did for that reason too. The handling of it by the Government is questionable to say the least.
940653387716157440 2017-12-12 18:43:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris May I ask why did you retweet a tweet saying that Prime Minister May was traitorous? Your view is yours to have but I find the idea of our leader being a traitor ... different. https://twitter.com/repealeulaw/status/940149621074071554
940652140648894464 2017-12-12 18:38:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris I didnt just retweet from them though - you know that 
940651777753518080 2017-12-12 18:37:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris You did. I would like to be fluid though in how I see information from different angles. Your views have truly been interesting to me and thanks for sharing them.
940651245605474308 2017-12-12 18:35:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris For me, there are a lot of labels here. Sometimes theyre can clarify things and at other times they can divide. For me, your are my countryman or lady (I presumed gentleman but forgive me if I am wrong). Why categorise ourselves from each other?
940650397005438982 2017-12-12 18:31:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris I understand. IMO, its for people to decide what they like or do not like. Why does anyone feel hatred? I want the best deal for anyone & for me (who voted Leave), I feel that politics was put before peoples lives who now are in limbo & promises that were made are now broken
940647126874370048 2017-12-12 18:18:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris You have said yourself that you are  unsure if I was a leftist. I dont mind if you think or have different views to me (you know from my time line I like hearing all views) - I find it healthy, tbh. I have supported promoting centralist politics & cross-party conversation.
940644310827126784 2017-12-12 18:07:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris Why cant I like both?

940644103200608257 2017-12-12 18:06:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RebetikoWalrus @SW11simon @SadaeChris Interesting phraseology ... why is wanting to #remain being any kind of an -ist?

940018267036487680 2017-12-10 00:39:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ifuaskmee @wallen48 Is verbally disrespecting our Prime Minister & country a differing view? It is essentially (to quote Mrs May) wrong. People feel things strongly (as you do) because people value the bond between these nations & to feel that the President doesnt value it is interesting.

I sympathise but feel the exact opposite way. For me, its #peopleb4politics

Can you clarify for me what you mean by admitting others are capable of anything? Your view is interesting & unique - why do you think no one needs those things. I do. Everyone does. #GlobalBritain ?

Its hard to say as there is no plan. I think your arguments are ok (hope the gov hears them) but the gov keeps lying @DavidDavisMP @BorisJohnson (Sorry but your words were false). We all deserve the truth & to decide based on it.

She is saying great things (did so before & yet nothing is done) but not acting on them.Only certain people will benefit & not all. When children are scared that they cant spend Xmas together because they dont know where they will be ... its wrong.

No. To my knowledge, No plan has been made for these next few years - people everywhere need to know what to help themselves best. People, families & nations of all places need security. We all do. #nomorelimbo

We all have different interpretations of Brexit and what it means. Then again, during the campaigns many said differing things & even they were on the same side.

Vote Leave did say that we would remain in the Single Market and Customs Union. The ECJ was to be negotiated. As far as I knew, the Gov has not fully discussed what Brexit would be or look like. I appreciate this is my view and that alone.

939097866454425600 2017-12-08 11:42:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Some people in Europe were/are curious as to why many in the UK who voted Leave were worried that Europe would create a European Army. @DouglasCarswell is expressing this concern.

938720671403782144 2017-12-07 10:43:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ottocrat @KimSJ I know what you mean. Saying that, some Brexiteers have made points that I found interesting but I havent been able to speak with them enough to discuss it properly or seen enough to back up points. I know many are worried about the thought of an EU army & concerns over control.

938696441551302657 2017-12-07 09:07:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @RJPKlein Agreed - I hope we can avoid landfill and burning waste.
938696256783880193 2017-12-07 09:06:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @socialistmartin Thats an interesting fact
938696190069301248 2017-12-07 09:06:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @DavidBall14 Sadly true. I would like to see what possible solutions we can come up with together. You have good experience, may I ask what your suggestions would be?
938695959093174272 2017-12-07 09:05:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @aquatickev2013 Interesting
938695855405719552 2017-12-07 09:05:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews We seriously and quickly need to form plans to deal with this ASAP. I can understand very much why China is doing this (more time is needed for us in the UK to prepare though). Would like to hear to hear more suggestions on this and how we can even use this as an opportunity.
938678117857624064 2017-12-06 07:54:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @ChazzaRichMFC All the beat to you too. I hope I am able to hear of the things you would like for the capital.
938542131098148864 2017-12-06 22:54:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @ChazzaRichMFC This is just my opinion but I found a great way to express my thoughts and look at info on really important issues London faces. Londoners are amazing people and deserve a lot of respect.
938541723814424576 2017-12-06 22:52:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @ChazzaRichMFC Thanks for answering. I hope talks with other countries like India & Pakistan can mean better opportunities for London & them (i.e. both have amazing health professionals) but I can appreciate why youd like him to stay. Have you used Talk London  at all?https://www.london.gov.uk/talk-london/
938539333216284672 2017-12-06 22:43:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @riana_roses @LynJ2017 Really pretty
938538612819447808 2017-12-06 22:40:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @ChazzaRichMFC May I ask what your experiences were? Genuinely, I am curious. Why not build better relations with the world? I have been impressed at the support & positivity it has shown (especially in recent days) for the U.K. & welcome it.

938473059954159616 2017-12-06 18:19:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> How service users/experts by experience are treated in their involvement in activities & how they are seen can truly make difference.

This would really help people. Giving people the facts mean confident peeps & better decisions. My respect to however all voted.

I do though blame myself for taking my citizenship for granted and not doing more to learn about the EU - I knew too little and wanted to too late. I dont want to give it up though. Not at all. I want to be what I was born - both.

When a person (never mentioned anything or anyone else) is retweeting a fake video & 2 that promote hatred, to say its wrong & want it to stop is fine. Sorry I offended you & May God forgive you too ...

935832360704200705 2017-11-29 11:26:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @FT @cpokane @vinnyflood I think that is why we have all awaited this process. The govs actions in the last 24 hrs make me ask why is it ok for MPs to want a 2nd vote regarding the Brexit research data but not for us to have a 2nd ref? I do appreciate why you tweeted what you did. My respects to you

935157343586799616 2017-11-27 14:44:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ThatTimWalker I agree, Mr Walker. After reporting the tweet I then banned The Spectator from my Twitter feed. I know its no loss to them in a geek like me doing that (understandingly so) but I do know they do not speak for many, many of us

935150153945796608 2017-11-27 14:15:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> This really upsets me & many others. This tweet does not represent what I & many feel. My respect to #Ireland , the #UK & the #EU (we are still #EU28 & always will be Europeans with #moreincommon that would could segregate us). Weve achieved good things, overcome much & still dohttps://twitter.com/gerardbattenmep/status/934919135561166848

935136247055515648 2017-11-27 13:20:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @J_amesp You are an nice gentleman and for me amongst other things a premier journalist, investigator & sharer of accurate and good information. You cant be put in a box and that means as a result you are able to tick all the right boxes without an agenda or bias. Just my observation.
935132631854919680 2017-11-27 13:06:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @_Lauren_Celeste @UrbanAngel2020 Its refreshing  Wishing the best for you too, though. This is something we can all enjoy  I just need to remind myself to give the happy couple space, lol

The past does not have to be our present & future. @JustinWelby has given his blessing & they certainly have mine.

931609050688688128 2017-11-17 19:44:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCRadio4 I was in tears waiting to collect my 2 children from school today listening to this x

931601643220733954 2017-11-17 19:15:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCBreaking Very sad to hear this has happened - hope all involved will be fine xxx

931262891579334657 2017-11-16 20:49:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guardian @rob_arci @Istumbledupon @Helen_Rothwell Please know I am just speaking for myself & for me, I respect us all x I think we all do and though I with we do remain, I respect we all have different views. I find that healthy & I love our country. I hope people dont mind me saying this but I love the EU, too. Love to all 
931262023098421253 2017-11-16 20:45:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guardian @rob_arci @Istumbledupon @Helen_Rothwell Thanks for your words I think thats the main reason why so many have waited to see how this is happening because we respect each other. I feel lied to, see millions of our people are living in limbo & key things we didnt vote on are being made undemocratically & in disrespect
931259461670404096 2017-11-16 20:35:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @LeaveEUOfficial @carolecadwalla I am just so sorry it happened at all

931258494782705664 2017-11-16 20:31:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guardian @rob_arci @Helen_Rothwell @Istumbledupon Makes sense to me as well. I appreciate people saying that they dont want vote after vote on this. As much told to us has been proved untrue, I find it clear we need to ensure that this is what everyone wants. I worry though regardless if we do or dont, people will be angry

928527584417239040 2017-11-08 07:40:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million For me, I think The European Parliament is right. Millions have been   #inlimbo for well over 500 days now & even after a promise has been made, we are yet to see it acted on  #momorelimbo #ThisIsOurHome #Equally

928248307566202880 2017-11-08 13:10:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Channel4News @ejectamenta_com Mr Younge though (4 me) did reflect the bigger picture for the audience. I was pleased he responded to the Africans have benefited from white supremacy & building the White House comments. Mr Younge emphasised also how being proud of being white is different to being a bigot.

928241590266720256 2017-11-08 12:43:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Channel4News @ejectamenta_com Thanks for replying. I think when Mr Spencer was saying things that come out quite hurtful & personal to Mr Younge that although it would have been nice for the interview to have ended in a more platonic way for both of them, it sadly made it very difficult.

I am very honoured that we have such amazing countrymen and his family have raised an amazing gentlemen.  Wishing you the very best always.
928231014928920576 2017-11-08 12:01:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Channel4News For me, he conducted an interview & gave accurate and clear information when some may have reacted differently. As you used the term literally, I say he is literally & truly an English gentleman. May I ask why are you saying signal harder? Thats not a term I have heard used.

918082955125448704 2017-10-11 11:56:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Sounds like an interesting topic to discuss. I hear many people talk of #resistance but not had it defined. I remember during the ..: 1/2

882499044911837184 2017-07-05 07:19:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews @karlako23 Offers have indeed been made which is great () but how can one say they are "milking it"? They have been through too much

836516397501071361 2017-02-28 10:00:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @helenyg Well said and I'm so sorry xxx
836516332153802752 2017-02-28 10:00:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TellMamaUK It's terrible 
836489849565810688 2017-02-28 08:14:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Anna_Soubry @StopSilence_UK @magritte000 Is it? Lol! That did make me giggle. Diff opinions make me feel encouraged, not sad 
836489116179173376 2017-02-28 08:12:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> That's a logical way to term things. I'm just not satisfied that it is responsible but as I say, that's just my conclusion.
836488589940768768 2017-02-28 08:09:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @TellMamaUK This is unacceptable.Utterly. #no2h8 
836320949356093440 2017-02-27 21:03:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> It wasn't how I felt but this is your view. I feel diff but I'm glad to gain insight from your point of view. Thank you
836319284980744192 2017-02-27 20:57:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Anna_Soubry @StopSilence_UK @magritte000 Indeed, I did 
836318677104529408 2017-02-27 20:54:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon What do you think about the cuts being made to schools?

836317698699243533 2017-02-27 20:50:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Sure  I know it's just my reading of it but for diff communities to have shared united views & be respected is the key pic.twitter.com/v37j7fFGSX
836315522937520128 2017-02-27 20:42:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @The3Million @1daywithoutus @antoni_UK 
836314266437218304 2017-02-27 20:37:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon FGM sadly occurs in non-Muslim societies (i.e. Africa) & is practiced by Christians, Muslims & Animists alike.
836303193294442496 2017-02-27 19:53:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon Islam, Christianity & Judaism do have commonality in quite a few aspects & why does Islam equate to FGM?
836302529566756864 2017-02-27 19:50:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon This is just my opinion but to me, your description perfectly encapsulates what multiculturalism can bring
836297283146776577 2017-02-27 19:29:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @lootcrate Don't be sorry! You made a lot of peeps happy (namely my friend end who adores Game of Thrones)  I am confident in you!!! pic.twitter.com/3Ju9R1ExER
836252980458377216 2017-02-27 16:33:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon Sorry if I am being boring or sounding weird as I really mean you no disrespect. I'm interested in your words
836252558477910017 2017-02-27 16:32:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon And even then,  my ancestors who were from the Celtic tribes weren't natives here
836252383088869376 2017-02-27 16:31:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon Forgive me but when my ancestors were invaded by the saxons, vikings & Romans it wasn't assimilation
836251814269976576 2017-02-27 16:29:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon An important question but 1 I don't think multiculturalism answers - our nation's history is such.
836247312959680514 2017-02-27 16:11:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon Forgive me if I took anything out of context as it's not my intention. Our history is deeply multicultural
836246996981792768 2017-02-27 16:09:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon Your past tweet reg "Saudi-backed radical Sunni Islam" was interesting. Why are we still selling them weapons?pic.twitter.com/isEJCMqCuH
836244537420951553 2017-02-27 16:00:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> We could  However, looking at each person affected & plan for them an affective legal & sustaining solution could work too
836243282808164353 2017-02-27 15:55:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @lootcrate @seansoldier00 I'm glad you liked it though & I am keen to see next month's box  Just not sure what to do with some of my items

836242419733655553 2017-02-27 15:51:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @lootcrate @seansoldier00 I'm glad you liked your box but (def just me) I'm not a Games of Thrones fan & felt the exclusive figure was ok
836212050082807810 2017-02-27 13:51:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> When I say or tweet something, please don't feel my thoughts are set in stone. I value hearing all views and seeing all angles x

836209181174689794 2017-02-27 13:39:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> We can help this lady and her family right now. #StandTogether
836208693947564032 2017-02-27 13:37:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @guardian To me, this is her country and she has been a huge part of for decades. Paperwork can be done

816332119148548098 2017-01-03 17:15:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DailyMirror @stevebeasant From telling GP's not to issue sick notes to telling judges how to carry out justice ... so dangerous!

816295662165917696 2017-01-03 14:50:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JRLHarris The term nationality itself could equate to being of the country you are born in and not the United Kingdom - so grey all this
816295460692434944 2017-01-03 14:49:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JRLHarris It's not his fault though - it really is hard to get a clear answer. I don't know if I'm right or not & I def don't judge.
816295171784638465 2017-01-03 14:48:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JRLHarris I wish we could call ourselves what we believe ourselves 2 B & b respected for it. We can B more than 1 thing x just my view x

814181656680603648 2016-12-28 18:50:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Thanks for the link
814172398329229312 2016-12-28 18:13:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Peeps are judged & penalised sadly regardless 4 what they wear- a cross, a hijab or even girls wearing trousers
814171441885224962 2016-12-28 18:09:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED May I ask where you saw that and can I have the link, please? If you don't, no worries
814171257172267008 2016-12-28 18:08:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED ...but for what reason? What logic?
814171168706088960 2016-12-28 18:08:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED No, not at all. In fact, many instances of women (not so much men) being asked not to wear certain things ...
814170831739879425 2016-12-28 18:07:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED If someone is telling me what to wear/not wear, they are to an extent dictating. Many reasons 4 it but they are
814170254071005184 2016-12-28 18:04:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED You mentioned the cross ban with BA & the NHS which Muslims don't wear but Christians & Catholics do.
814169284461154304 2016-12-28 18:00:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Diff opinions can be good - it's not a negative. Just feel proportionate accountability is needed by that shop
814168758034034688 2016-12-28 17:58:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Always the individual who is a scape goat & not the companies. It's not right. Can they dictate our faiths?
814167615870500865 2016-12-28 17:54:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED I don't think you are. Just your views. I think that it's being made to be all about her faith & IMO, it's not.
814167182129197056 2016-12-28 17:52:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Shop could as I said b4 have given her a diff job to do & she could have said she can't sell alcohol - sorted 
814166704314085376 2016-12-28 17:50:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Not at all and you know that. Your views are clearly anti-Muslim. Mine are that of us all are equal.
814166256064622592 2016-12-28 17:48:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Have peeps been attacking you over your tweets? Hope not as you are only expressing yourself. We aren't silly.
814165349562286080 2016-12-28 17:45:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MikeSwadling @steviweavi Steve, thanks 4 helping get more info & thanks to Mike 4 giving more info. Steve is very smart just like you, Mike
814164636194979842 2016-12-28 17:42:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Agreed, she should've declined a job role which meant she would poss sell alcohol. Staff & employer accountable
814164233604759552 2016-12-28 17:40:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED The customer should not have been made to feel rejected - the lady and employer have equal responsibility
814162645943197700 2016-12-28 17:34:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED It's reasonable behaviour for a employer to think about poss issues customers and staff may face & they failed
814162440673955840 2016-12-28 17:33:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED I'm not silly though as you are not. We have diff views. Her issue was selling alcohol, wasn't it?
814162235216068608 2016-12-28 17:32:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED How did her religion put her in that job role? Surely shops are responsible for that.
814161314436313089 2016-12-28 17:29:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ukschizophrenic We can petition Stop sales of arms to Saudi Arabia until there are no human rights concernshttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167781
814158867387056128 2016-12-28 17:19:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Why is her religion the main focus? Because people want 2 focus on it & not the employer 4 wrong job allocation
814158258923601920 2016-12-28 17:17:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Let's not dance around her religion being focused on & not the customer or shop who put her in the wrong job
814157738389504001 2016-12-28 17:15:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED She could do many other roles in the shop. They gave her 1 that was not suitable & she should have told them
814157053367296000 2016-12-28 17:12:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Again, the business made this weird situation.
814156535047790593 2016-12-28 17:10:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED They needed 2 think about their employees & customer. This is bad situation the shop made 4 customer & staff
814155275510935552 2016-12-28 17:05:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED May I ask why you think that?
814107554469019648 2016-12-28 13:55:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Debenhams Please when poss respond to this & to the gentleman who was treated so badly & help him? No h8 from me, just the best for the man https://twitter.com/resistinghate/status/814106208542085120

814104975731281920 2016-12-28 13:45:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED The employer is getting way with this & it's they who caused the situation - poor customer! Poor employee!
814104432539553792 2016-12-28 13:43:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED How about an employer putting a lady in a position where she can't serve her customer because of her religion?
814102209600307200 2016-12-28 13:34:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED The shop is responsible for this - he certainly has a right to complain and they shouldn't put her in that role

814097910803660801 2016-12-28 13:17:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED ... team leader shouldn't have put the customer or her in that position. He must feel very weird, as must she.

814089454948413440 2016-12-28 12:43:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PrisonPlanet @Madrid_is_RED Why didn't the lady ask some1 else to serve the gentlemen? Not his fault.  I would have got a colleague 2 serve

812447302812110848 2016-12-23 23:58:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Extremism can be found in so many different places - that's why we need each other & to work together without  extreme thoughts of our own
812446362868613120 2016-12-23 23:54:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Holbornlolz @ShoahdSpartan @UAI2000 Not just the only community in the UK with those views  Thanks for the link, by the way.

812442615719358464 2016-12-23 23:39:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @UAI2000 @ShoahdSpartan Forgive me but why is me wanting tighter immigration going to "invite death and rape"? Truly dont any1 having that
812435926886608896 2016-12-23 23:13:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Holbornlolz @ShoahdSpartan @UAI2000 No one should be killed or raped hence why it's shocking we let those kids get abused here

812433918901293056 2016-12-23 23:05:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Holbornlolz @UAI2000 @ShoahdSpartan Lots of children, women & men were abused. It's wrong. I worry it's still going on and sadly here too.
812433360085729280 2016-12-23 23:03:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Holbornlolz @ShoahdSpartan @UAI2000 They do - all abuse is wrong. Awful people are taking advantage of so many.

811729956858458112 2016-12-21 00:27:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Madrid_is_RED The attacks by ISIS are awful. The attacks on religious groups, Polish, German, French, European & Asain peeps scares me too
811729228194521088 2016-12-21 00:25:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Madrid_is_RED I'm worried we are getting extremists on all sides & quite right, we shouldn't ignore it but deal with it. I propose together

796488134628413441 2016-11-09 23:02:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RedHotSquirrel @leastimnotu Why don't you think we value tradition or show how we value our commitments? I think our country is gr8 at that

757950156046237696 2016-07-26 14:46:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MailOnline @tryitfirst000 @hmncrss @lisj21_x The 1 I went to on an open day has a open door policy so my view might be biased
757949780802867205 2016-07-26 14:44:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MailOnline @tryitfirst000 @hmncrss @lisj21_x I think we have diff opinions & don't want to cause friction. The world's changing
757948899185262592 2016-07-26 14:41:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MailOnline @tryitfirst000 @hmncrss @lisj21_x Do you feel Islam is to blame rather than ISIS?
757947576624812032 2016-07-26 14:35:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MailOnline @tryitfirst000 @hmncrss @lisj21_x Tbh, I would like to look at other options & 4 all decide how we deal with this.
757946946816532482 2016-07-26 14:33:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 I did
757946072480309248 2016-07-26 14:30:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 ... I know I'm childish and arrogant but I want to do all I can to reduce death and risk as much as I can for all.
757945719458267136 2016-07-26 14:28:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 They are, have and will do. But I'm not going to let people die if I can help it. I want to grab the bullet out of the air...

757942860155088896 2016-07-26 14:17:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MailOnline @tryitfirst000 @hmncrss @lisj21_x I cannot & you say an important question. Are there any other ways we can find out together?
757941680322510848 2016-07-26 14:12:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JGForsyth @tryitfirst000 @MarkUrban01 
757938383381471232 2016-07-26 13:59:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Yeah. . I am just worried about a European Army and a lot of xenophobes using this as an excuse. A lot of people aren't.

757926691356409856 2016-07-26 13:12:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PDChina @tryitfirst000 Again, sorry if sound weird mate :)
757926603716497408 2016-07-26 13:12:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PDChina @tryitfirst000 Trying to find out now - I know earlier they said it happened around 11ish so it's strange everything is so vague
757926318432456704 2016-07-26 13:11:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @MuslimCouncil I'm getting so frightened by the reactions people are having to not just the recent attacks but to each other
757925805259362307 2016-07-26 13:09:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @_I_DP_I_ I feel the world is going crazy  Why is it being like this? Too much hate and anger at everyone
757924068523900928 2016-07-26 13:02:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @weesue I'm not arguing with you - your are only saying what you think
757921198844047364 2016-07-26 12:51:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @weesue It's just awful what's happening full stop.
757921041431859200 2016-07-26 12:50:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @weesue If that is how you feel it's ... what you feel.
757920867980550144 2016-07-26 12:49:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @nytimesworld People are free to feel what they feel.
757920125248999424 2016-07-26 12:46:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @nytimesworld It absolutely has. Certainly people are expressing these views.
757919077528657920 2016-07-26 12:42:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @Pdc1956Peter @tryitfirst000 I don't think that way but your opinion is yours. I hope 4 better things but won't ignore the facts
757918467207077888 2016-07-26 12:40:18 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @tryitfirst000 @Pdc1956Peter I will stop tweeting guys & mean no disrespect. Just h8 seeing every1 fighting when shit is going on
757917945330827264 2016-07-26 12:38:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @tryitfirst000 @Pdc1956Peter IMP, peeps are  getting more divided because nothing is seeming 2b happening yet ... But it will. 
757917496699658240 2016-07-26 12:36:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @tryitfirst000 @Pdc1956Peter Sadly, I can see that right now as well.
757916505447264256 2016-07-26 12:32:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @tryitfirst000 @Pdc1956Peter So I am clear to all, I believe ISIS does not speak for all Muslim people.
757915380492988416 2016-07-26 12:28:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @Pdc1956Peter @tryitfirst000 What better excuse would there be for a European coordinated army now?
757915158178070528 2016-07-26 12:27:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @Pdc1956Peter @tryitfirst000 It's too late now for political views and boxes - There may well be a United European Army now
757914176635465728 2016-07-26 12:23:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @K69atie @tryitfirst000 @Pdc1956Peter IMO - everywhere, we all are a very divided people at the mo & it creates poss dangers & risks!
757912318139400193 2016-07-26 12:15:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @akhbar @jenanmoussa I think we all knew ... Thank you for telling us. We need each other more than ever
757911822649425920 2016-07-26 12:13:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Pdc1956Peter @tryitfirst000 @K69atie Things will intensify - they have to now. We just mustn't fight each other or we are all screwed
757911412505190401 2016-07-26 12:12:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MrsEmmaJK What is good though is how good info is coming through and I can hear diff opinions
757911131902078976 2016-07-26 12:11:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @kad_c @ParalympicsGB Well done 
757911068089909248 2016-07-26 12:10:54 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I'm finding it sadly very evident how much more racial and religious hatred is coming on here despite hearing there is monitoring. 
757909938937139200 2016-07-26 12:06:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MrsEmmaJK Rather than squabble, we need good leadership & a good strategy. No excuse for hatred - we have to be strong here.
757909072507199488 2016-07-26 12:02:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Too much fighting on here! It's being directed at the wrong people too! All countries need to boost their security forces internally.
757904026507902976 2016-07-26 11:42:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AFP @akhbar @jenanmoussa There we go. Thanks again for your tweets
757903732248018944 2016-07-26 11:41:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @joerichlaw @JustinWelby @Daily_Ref I just want us together. If people feel differently, that's fine. I can change words I use :)
757902160986267648 2016-07-26 11:35:30 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Shots fired in Berlin!
757901808480161792 2016-07-26 11:34:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 I can only speak for myself. As with all things, I'm sure some will & some will say to the attackers #YouAintNoMuslimBruv
757900594828935168 2016-07-26 11:29:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 I would love the uk to build its industries up by itself as a focus ...We are too reliant on others money & borrowing is bad
757899673617199104 2016-07-26 11:25:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @haveigotnews lol
757899450710953984 2016-07-26 11:24:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 immigrants though aren't all Muslims and there are many Muslims who are not extremists - just my opinion
757899205990113280 2016-07-26 11:23:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Well, even those who just are influenced by ISIS can be considered by ISIS as lone wolves but you asked what I thought.
757898710495944704 2016-07-26 11:21:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Sorry I took so long to reply
757898656242630656 2016-07-26 11:21:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 it's certainly an attack extremely inspired and has all the traits of ISIS - all we need is their claim & that won't be long
757897576289013760 2016-07-26 11:17:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @hunterjonesiii @tryitfirst000 We may well find things could change a bit now overseas regarding the church
757897384911306752 2016-07-26 11:16:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Do you feel though British workers relate to terror attacks by ISIS?
757897000625004544 2016-07-26 11:15:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 I don't want to dispute anything - I just want the facts 1st. It is what it is & I want to plan without negativity or bias
757896562412490752 2016-07-26 11:13:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @hunterjonesiii @tryitfirst000 ... 2/2 ... Good idea and fair 2 all. He says what he feels & its OK. Free speech. Is that bad?
757895869777731584 2016-07-26 11:10:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @hunterjonesiii @tryitfirst000 Forgive me, are we talking about refuges? IMO, better border control & immigration is a ... 1/2

757894757502816256 2016-07-26 11:06:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @hunterjonesiii See  Even a hippy like me can get it, lol  BTW, I'm not lol
757894583229485056 2016-07-26 11:05:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @kwaicat Based on that, we need to find the best approach together. Time will give more info & facts to act on
757894165208367104 2016-07-26 11:03:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @hunterjonesiii Lets deal with the real prob!

757893604861943812 2016-07-26 11:01:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @hunterjonesiii Thought I was being pretty confrontational on that point with you though? ;)
757893469524361217 2016-07-26 11:00:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 
757893248711024640 2016-07-26 11:00:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @hunterjonesiii All these attacks are an anomaly & disgusting. I will not put them into pretty boxes 4 points
757892842928893952 2016-07-26 10:58:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 @hunterjonesiii Why? Terror is terror, surely
757892557909131265 2016-07-26 10:57:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Some of the comments made to the Archbishop of Canterbury have been disgusting! Shame on people
757891598046863360 2016-07-26 10:53:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 They could be me though, lol - sorry I got my pants in a twist! Lol
757891362352136192 2016-07-26 10:52:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 Or does someone just wanting to kill all disabled people not a terrorist?
757891232236535808 2016-07-26 10:52:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 Including Japan?
757891172400558080 2016-07-26 10:51:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 Why is waiting for facts & then acting being a hippy? You say u pray too and then criticise me for doing it?
757890435473965056 2016-07-26 10:48:55 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 My ilk? Lol - I think you don't know me too well

757889762359382016 2016-07-26 10:46:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinWelby @tryitfirst000 That is ur opinion and it's people doing these things ... Not a religion.

757862175897772032 2016-07-26 08:56:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mike_Fabricant @tryitfirst000 Crimes against other countries (ie like Baghdad & Germany) & crimes against people based on several motives
757861363989512192 2016-07-26 08:53:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Clarifying definitely helps clear any poss confusion. We just need more of it from everyone. Clarity breeds truth & helps all
757860757119827968 2016-07-26 08:50:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Mike_Fabricant @tryitfirst000 It's only uncertain as it hasn't been done but I'm confident Just don't like these cuts in the NHS & h8 crime
757858719736528897 2016-07-26 08:42:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @tryitfirst000 The article said "the people of Germany" though I know you didn't. It  may be seen as being linked to the article
757858271457710081 2016-07-26 08:41:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @AJEnglish @UN_Women I hope we can all work together like this  #inspiration

757856220996771840 2016-07-26 08:32:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Bless you! :)
757856086896414720 2016-07-26 08:32:26 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @McDonalds @ChannelNewsAsia has been a very good employer in my hometown!
757855787024658432 2016-07-26 08:31:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @VirginTrains Good morning! I bought some tickets earlier in the month treasure hunting but it won't let me verify online I bought them 
757855138564349952 2016-07-26 08:28:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @tryitfirst000 And sorry I didn't say it sooner but good morning 
757854935052464128 2016-07-26 08:27:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @tryitfirst000 Germany doesn't need criticism surely right now. It needs confidence and support
757854652608032768 2016-07-26 08:26:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @tryitfirst000 Do you mean we are due an attack in the UK? If so, I agree. But none of us should give into terror.
757848740983996416 2016-07-26 08:03:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jg004a0891 That's the irony, I guess 
757848006804713472 2016-07-26 08:00:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I'm concerned how the terror acts are creating so much #h8 when we need everyone's clarity to see why its happening  & then #act as 1
757846591168327680 2016-07-26 07:54:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I remember one of the big reasons for voting for #Brexit was to secure and reinvest in the NHS - not to have massive nationwide #NHScuts 
757845984575500288 2016-07-26 07:52:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jg004a0891 It's appalling - no other word for it. How can we help our GP's to be able to do their jobs better without added work/pressure?
757845372232355840 2016-07-26 07:49:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @tryitfirst000 Germany will
757842927301177344 2016-07-26 07:40:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jg004a0891 The amount of paperwork that health professionals have had to do reaches stupid levels! It triples their workload
757840319685599236 2016-07-26 07:29:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jg004a0891 Sorry he has had such a rough time! It sounds like the fact that care can differ so much in diff places and/or by diff staff
757838850068623360 2016-07-26 07:23:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DrRanj Good morning! May I ask for your advice? How can people like me best support the NHS and health professionals?
757838570526650368 2016-07-26 07:22:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jg004a0891 Thank you - what do you think we could do to make things more secure and I hope your water comes to you asap x
757838357166559232 2016-07-26 07:21:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> On a #community level, are we able to work even more together on encouraging #nursing #healthprofessionals &  #skilledworkers ?
757837497858596864 2016-07-26 07:18:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> I don't support a particular party, I want ALL of us 2 have & 2 work together on the outcome of a secure NHS 4 allhttps://twitter.com/mrsemmajk/status/757836992675581952
757836992675581952 2016-07-26 07:16:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Very sad news about the #NHScuts #nationwide - time to see what we can do though about supporting them as a nationhttps://twitter.com/nhaparty/status/757836179228078081

757834478068887552 2016-07-26 07:06:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RikWinkel @mvanderKist @OleRyborg In your opinion, what potential things could the UK do to invest in itself and these start ups?
757834206776995846 2016-07-26 07:05:29 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @RikWinkel @mvanderKist @OleRyborg Sad but makes sense from the EU side of things. It's just a bit unfair to do it b4 we can help ourselves

757618453649952770 2016-07-25 16:48:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 @europafreunde Each culture views women differently. There are ones which think it's okay to hurt/hate/despise females.

757605561890377728 2016-07-25 15:56:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 @europafreunde You could be right. It's just so wrong to want to stab anyone, isn't it?

757588852676685824 2016-07-25 14:50:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 But it was inspired by ISIS but not by them. They didn't even know his name b4 seeing him on the newshttps://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/757587674932899841
757587971965120512 2016-07-25 14:47:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Isis have just claimed responsibility -https://twitter.com/jenanmoussa/status/757585288101265408
757587449019236353 2016-07-25 14:44:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Thinking of the facts & that quote I mentioned - the "you ain't no Muslim, Bro" or Bruv 1. I would have to agree again 
757586694619197440 2016-07-25 14:41:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 I will never forget that quote from that man said after the knife attack at the tube station, that's why I love our people
757586392604143617 2016-07-25 14:40:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 We both remember London  Howwe all just kept on. We didn't judge b4 we knew what was happening. "U ain't no Muslim, Bro".
757585783616335872 2016-07-25 14:38:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 The recent attacks have been a bizarre mix . Many Muslims have been victims too! Too many of all faiths & life in danger 
757582672696905729 2016-07-25 14:25:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 there are patterns but it's ISIS specifically &there affiliated groups. So many g8 Muslims and people out there get hurt

757581581913579521 2016-07-25 14:21:38 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 People felt a big discord between them because of these 2 diff messages in their religious text. Thus not just Islam
757581354309672960 2016-07-25 14:20:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 When I think of the bible (I'm no scholar) we have Moses saying an "eye for an eye" & Jesus saying "to turn the other cheek"

757579471293734912 2016-07-25 14:13:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 By the way, let me know if you get bored of me tweeting. I won't be offended and just don't want to bore.
757579182754889728 2016-07-25 14:12:06 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 Like Catholic and Christian? Catholic and Protestant?
757578408020832256 2016-07-25 14:09:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @r0eland @tryitfirst000 ... 2/2 We just need to take care not to label a whole group of people, especially if that group has diff beliefs
757577645131436032 2016-07-25 14:06:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @r0eland @tryitfirst000 It certainly seems from his phone he was a Salafist/extreme follower of Sunni Islam. Islam is very diverse so ...1/2
757575320182616065 2016-07-25 13:56:46 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @r0eland @tryitfirst000 Why did you say Muslims?
757565626420527106 2016-07-25 13:18:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon @MinstryOfTruth Well, no arguing there
757552564745474048 2016-07-25 12:26:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon What would be the advice to give people in the UK in the case of a terrorist attack and how to prepare for one?
757549656410914816 2016-07-25 12:14:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @r0eland @tryitfirst000 True. It's just sad, isn't it?
757520601926004737 2016-07-25 10:19:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @r0eland @tryitfirst000 Not sure - I was just sad it happened at all. As far as I know, no one has claimed the attack as theirs. Maybe tho
757495749596835840 2016-07-25 08:40:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @DisneyJuniorUK He will be VERY happy
757486342276349952 2016-07-25 08:03:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @tryitfirst000 @r0eland Sadly, it seems that this was a suicide bomb attack 
757485861592305664 2016-07-25 08:01:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ChannelNewsAsia I'm sure there will be great success #rio2016

757337657961775104 2016-07-24 22:12:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> What a terrible accident from the sounds of it has happened in  #Ansbach - poor people & Sister #Germany is hurting again. Want to cry. Sad.
757334510107254784 2016-07-24 21:59:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom You reminded me of some very important things (I mean it) I will stop now, I promise. Thank you
757333734291042306 2016-07-24 21:56:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom I see why you picked those facts. I would say though so much goes  unreported in all countries
757331643078180865 2016-07-24 21:48:28 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom Why Is it okay to hurt wives/women because a husband says he can? No man or woman deserves that
757330922937126913 2016-07-24 21:45:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom So we are being fair, not just 1 religion/area, I'd say a lot do. But it's not ok to hurt wives
757327946671587328 2016-07-24 21:33:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom I probably phrased that badly but I think you know what I mean 
757326725047017473 2016-07-24 21:28:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts @Holbornlolz @juan_broom Hmm ... Do any say what the percentage was of men & women  who gave evidence of those stats?

757170159496916992 2016-07-24 11:06:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @euronews In the future, more people 2b employed & continuing the mutual support between France & UK could secure & speed things up better
757169188985249792 2016-07-24 11:02:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @euronews With all the recent attacks, I can understand but respect both sides
757169040389439488 2016-07-24 11:02:21 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @euronews IMO only, they're just making sure everyone is safely coming & going but but 4 those stranded, this must be so hard. It's hot too.

757140780146388993 2016-07-24 09:10:03 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @JustinTrudeau @DrRosena @bkohatl That must be sad as people working just for money will never feel satisfied in their working lives

756947227378057216 2016-07-23 20:20:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @zblay @HuffPostCrime @_I_DP_I_ I'm a bit of a nerd for watching martial arts and really suck at it. He is so good!

756921238119907329 2016-07-23 18:37:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Is this true??? O.0 China Worried Pokemon Go Could Expose TOP SECRET Military Bases???  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU9KzHOgGqc&feature=share

756846867812671488 2016-07-23 13:42:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YourAnonNews @j0nKhan Not sure about "humanity" but IMO, isn't it best 2 humbly admit our negatives & rather than accept them, change them
756844583074619392 2016-07-23 13:33:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @hinduwarrior15 @pandabodi @YourAnonNews No one can argue with that point, anon. Quite right.

756811527521468416 2016-07-23 11:21:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YourAnonNews @_I_DP_I_ Who wouldn't agree with that? 
756810788451614720 2016-07-23 11:18:47 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts True & I'm pleased!  But sadly it still is happening. Recently in my home county, there was a shooting & machete/knife crimes 
756809581905448960 2016-07-23 11:13:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts Veryvtrue and also how easy is it to be able to get guns in any country? It is in mine
756808800494051328 2016-07-23 11:10:53 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YourAnonNews Which you all felt was so
756805064677785600 2016-07-23 10:56:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews @YanniKouts I'm prob just as bad the way I rush into acting before watching & digesting the facts - as you know

756803036710862848 2016-07-23 10:47:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Thinking of fave VN #Higurashi When They Cry - I believe in the #magic in us called #hope #creation #love #unity #happinessforall #letsdoit

756801341880692736 2016-07-23 10:41:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts I agree 100%
756801057297235968 2016-07-23 10:40:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts People react in different ways ... 
756800663192006656 2016-07-23 10:38:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts Thanks for telling me. Wished I could do something productive for everyone
756800277718728704 2016-07-23 10:37:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts It's just so damn awful, isn't it?
756800010612797440 2016-07-23 10:35:57 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts True. All will come out in time and I need to chill before acting
756799485955731457 2016-07-23 10:33:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts i do think (though it may be clutching at straws) that the anniversary it may be worth very generally noting
756798834076942337 2016-07-23 10:31:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts Stupid me! Sorry! You are quite right
756797904036229120 2016-07-23 10:27:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @YanniKouts The date picked may well suggest a horrible copy of what happened in Norway last year

756779134135795712 2016-07-23 09:13:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist Exactly. And also to see how the EU and world would feel. I think the Commonwealth needs better commitments from the uk
756778633591742464 2016-07-23 09:11:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist true
756778548694753280 2016-07-23 09:10:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist It comes at a price though and it won't be easy!!!
756778371766489088 2016-07-23 09:09:58 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist In China, I have seen how high-tech zones and Special economic zones create a good option & distribute wealth better
756777903313018880 2016-07-23 09:08:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PolizeiMuenchen The fact is we will know more after 11:30 as to the ... 'man's motive. His acts are terrible. I just want us all to #unite
756776785958895616 2016-07-23 09:03:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PolizeiMuenchen thank you
756774250858569728 2016-07-23 08:53:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jenanmoussa In China when you learn English, David is given as a universal foreign western name & Ali as a universal eastern name
756773738159407104 2016-07-23 08:51:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist @ewaldeng in fact, more equal rights!
756773629635989505 2016-07-23 08:51:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist Though all is possible, i don't think so.
756773377621237760 2016-07-23 08:50:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist The UK is becoming a new country again - I don't see why other countries in the UK shouldn't have more rights & trade
756772543864930304 2016-07-23 08:46:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist China has and it's done them very well
756772417989640192 2016-07-23 08:46:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon #brexit @ewaldeng @mvanderKist Could London be a special economic zone & poss all the capital cities in the UK & Commonwealth
756772049968893952 2016-07-23 08:44:51 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ewaldeng @mvanderKist Surely it will become like a special economic zone & possibly all the capital cities in the UK & Commonwealth will
756771731029778432 2016-07-23 08:43:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @GermanyDiplo Just wanted to convey my sympathy for yesterday's sad events in #munich and how well people and the forces did during them x

756747313519923200 2016-07-23 07:06:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @365Disc_London To have and London and other major cities become a special economic zone makes good sense - 1 or more per country

753505396577435648 2016-07-14 08:24:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @angelaeagle Sorry you had the most awful experiences from very ignorant ... people. 
753491386746474496 2016-07-14 07:28:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Seriously, I can imagine the UN's women receiving a doll - I just hope they make one for the men too. Sexist otherwise!

753365392010121220 2016-07-13 23:08:00 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist @StathisPsillos How I wish someone as simple as I could do something to support you and all those promoting education.
753363727676825600 2016-07-13 23:01:24 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist @StathisPsillos Agreed. I keep thinking what links could be made within and outside the EU to help & support funding.

751539676771651584 2016-07-08 22:13:16 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> IMO, a good company, friend, government or person is one who when you come to them with a problem & you end up being the other's advocate. 
751538109255409665 2016-07-08 22:07:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Working in collections for #HSBC Southend was a most empowering & positive job! Listening to our customers, created realistic payment plans.
751536891367923713 2016-07-08 22:02:12 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Can a complaint actually be a gift in disguise? You can get to know what a customer really wants without barriers & act on them

751004472944496640 2016-07-07 10:46:33 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SadiqKhan @ThatAdamGarcia  to all those who were lost and those remembering them today

751002842673057792 2016-07-07 10:40:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Honestly, I'm glad we spoke and truly wish you a good day 
751002714390265856 2016-07-07 10:39:34 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Have a good day and please don't make me feel small. There is no need.
751002315071561728 2016-07-07 10:37:59 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo It's wrong to kill or hurt another
751002109340966912 2016-07-07 10:37:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo No. I think it was wrong for 1 person to kill another because they think differently over religion
751001918890278912 2016-07-07 10:36:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo So many people have & are being hurt and killed for what they believe in and it's a tragedy! Is it that hard to get me?
751001078150361088 2016-07-07 10:33:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Blind faith? What is blind faith?
751000963910074368 2016-07-07 10:32:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Forgive me, when you say the word of God, wasn't that in a tweet separate to what we are talking about - Faith & Science?
751000482643079168 2016-07-07 10:30:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo I'm boring you & making this long worded (sorry) - I'm just me, no expert. Faith to me is a joyous, loving thing. No hate
750999727806742528 2016-07-07 10:27:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo I'm not criticising you at all - you see something different and I must say I feel I should learn.
750999389737512960 2016-07-07 10:26:22 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Ok. Sorry if I did. Many religious scholars  explore &learn from the natural and physical world - take genetics and Mendel
750998931723649024 2016-07-07 10:24:32 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo You don't have to - should doesn't  mean you have to do anything. Your opinion is yours, mine is mine & that's ok #freewill
750998204016160768 2016-07-07 10:21:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @VirginUnite @GlblCtzn @nickhurdmp Brilliant point!
750997744374939648 2016-07-07 10:19:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Are you sure? It's a very practical example - an evidence based one, if you will
750996642686504960 2016-07-07 10:15:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo If science is the intellectual & practical activity to study the physical and natural world, why not explore the spirit too?
750995029812998144 2016-07-07 10:09:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo To be specific, every Remembrance Day in November, all religious leaders gather together &unite. How can I not admire that?
750994535354949636 2016-07-07 10:07:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo Many faiths also show respect & tolerance
750994062099017728 2016-07-07 10:05:11 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo We should also mention gender & class. Faith in my opinion is not of 1 but brings all together, not apart.
750991966641455104 2016-07-07 09:56:52 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @booboomajooboo I'm very proud of the LBGT community - there also many Muslims who also happen to be gay

750987926654316544 2016-07-07 09:40:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCNews @BBCBreaking @Maggot_4_Life I think faith should be admired but I do say that is my opinion

749710358571585540 2016-07-03 21:04:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ChrisThody He did lie though about WMD's. It led to a war that killed many people. If things were different, less innocents may have died

748803283318255618 2016-07-01 08:59:49 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MiddleEastEye I think that those involved should be made accountable. Such a tragedy. Many resigned over it & public people protested.

748243430535471104 2016-06-29 19:55:10 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @David_Cameron Do you think a UK bill of rights would be made to create a balance for more thorough immigration & freedom of movement?

748076444706803716 2016-06-29 08:51:37 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @UNHumanRights @UN I want to actively help protect the great communities we have. What is the best way ordinary people like me can do more?

748058458604331008 2016-06-29 07:40:09 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @MayorofLondon As does this Essex girl & your friends here in the UK
748055713956642816 2016-06-29 07:29:15 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> We need to make it our duty to report and #stopthehate crime. If you see or hear anything, don't let it go & report it.
748055069715763200 2016-06-29 07:26:41 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Political education is certainly something we should focus on in the UK.
748054823291994113 2016-06-29 07:25:42 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @XHNews Congratulations - did your fellow students celebrate with you? Well done

747818526812049408 2016-06-28 15:46:45 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @marcusbrig @mvanderKist Leavers, Remainers, experts ... All people should do it together. Imagine the worry if Leavers just did it.
747815990822576128 2016-06-28 15:36:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> If we could change any 3 things, what would you pick?
747815466580774912 2016-06-28 15:34:35 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @jeremycorbyn @BBCBreaking I feel quite sorry for Mr Corbyn.

747805513719681024 2016-06-28 14:55:02 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ChannelNewsAsia Sweetie
747805236056690688 2016-06-28 14:53:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist I'm impressed today though at how the EU is looking to make things better as restructure - MEP Farage was disgraceful :(
747802239071363072 2016-06-28 14:42:01 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist Thank you  Why should everyone have to suffer when no one was meant to have gotten hurt? I just don't understand x
747801296187629568 2016-06-28 14:38:17 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist And thanks for your tweet
747801241963597824 2016-06-28 14:38:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @mvanderKist Sadly yes, I do. I can understand the EU's viewpoint & appreciate why the UK doesn't want to rush ... What do we do?
747799382263734272 2016-06-28 14:30:40 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @euronews I agree. Too much damage is being inflicted &  it's only the UK that can do this ... Surely we can plan after we say we are out?
747795719017357313 2016-06-28 14:16:07 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @bbclaurak It's true though ... We (in the UK) need to at least be clear with our neighbours or we will cause everyone even more insecurity
747758395667718144 2016-06-28 11:47:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Jack_Septic_Eye @markiplier @muyskerm @LordMinion777 @Picturing_Ryan Lers make it happen

747727255531585537 2016-06-28 09:44:04 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Nigel_Farage @BBCBreaking Evil thing to have said ... Please be careful! You are turning into a hate figure with comments like this
747726970230837248 2016-06-28 09:42:56 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @XHNews @zhangboww Not at all, ha ha! Thank you though :)
747725762548084736 2016-06-28 09:38:08 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews @BBCBreaking Farage does NOT express the thoughts of the U.K.! He is so disrespectful, rude and vulgar - damaging our friendships
747724908029952000 2016-06-28 09:34:44 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @euronews Sad but true - Farage does NOT express the voice of the British people!!! #shame
747724528906821632 2016-06-28 09:33:14 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Nigel_Farage @BBCBreaking Why be so disrespectful???!!! No need at all for that!
747724370865496064 2016-06-28 09:32:36 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Farage said such disgusting things!!! 
747692844501057536 2016-06-28 07:27:20 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @bbclaurak Its everyone's responsibility! We all need to take ownership. All people need to agree on the outcomes we want and plan

747690375666614272 2016-06-28 07:17:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @ppixton It's going to be extremely tough ... But the world has actually been quite kind & supportive to us in the UK ... Nothing to loose 
747689761666666497 2016-06-28 07:15:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @SkyNews Good morning! For Mr Hunt, Do you think political education in schools and investing in the future generation a priority?

747514433916768256 2016-06-27 19:38:23 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> Okay, I need to stop worrying #referendum Time to think of outcomes we all want, plan, make those changes & to always protect & care is ALL!
747483963346788352 2016-06-27 17:37:19 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCBreaking @BBCNews I don't blame the EU & everyone wanting to get things started ... We need security, togetherness & a long-term plan
747454044025790464 2016-06-27 15:38:25 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @bbclaurak Absolutely right to condemn those awful attacks m
747410600641302528 2016-06-27 12:45:48 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @PolishEmbassyUK Want to say how amazing the Polish Community is and how disgusting these recent attacks have been.

747189559486726148 2016-06-26 22:07:27 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> How can we stop #racism , #sexism and #xenophobia together in the UK? #communitystrong
747184465164836865 2016-06-26 21:47:13 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @BBCBreaking @BBCNews But why did Boris say EU law was opaque??? 
747183785909837824 2016-06-26 21:44:31 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson @mmagierowski @Exen It is absolutely outrageous and disgusting for behaviour like that!
747183064229486593 2016-06-26 21:41:39 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @piersmorgan @mmagierowski It's awful!

747181825643126784 2016-06-26 21:36:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> @FinchleyReform @MayorofLondon Wishing you and all that attended a lovely night
747162789010096129 2016-06-26 20:21:05 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> My vote seems to have based on a lot of lies ... Should this referendum count if people feel they've been tricked? #fear #referendum
747155903443517440 2016-06-26 19:53:43 UTC <MrsEmmaJK> There has been some ugly things said to some of the most amazing people in my country recently #shame I'm proud of our diversity & want more
