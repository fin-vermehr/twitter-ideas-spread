962775714335408128 2018-02-11 19:49:52 UTC <JustineChamp> This idiot. Guess what jack ass? People are hiding in their homes for fear of being deported back to legitimately dangerous countries they havent seen since they were babies. Your fears are a joke.

962584377543688193 2018-02-10 07:09:34 UTC <JustineChamp> Rapist defending a wife beater. And they occupy the White House. This is 2018 and Im so glad my grandma died before 45 won.

962582680331108354 2018-02-10 07:02:49 UTC <JustineChamp> @bdd4 Not sure Im allowed to say online which would probably answer that question for you. GO FOR IT! We need women in the intelligence community. Badly.
962572820097060865 2018-02-10 06:23:38 UTC <JustineChamp> @bdd4 It costs somewhere around $25,000. My husband got a job offer just because he has a clearance. They found a job for him at the company later. Costs less to train him to do the task than to pay for clearance.

962454870610489346 2018-02-10 22:34:57 UTC <JustineChamp> My hopes for @TheDemocrats to fix what @POTUS is doing to this country were dashed this weekend upon learning about how corrupt the local @DemClubs is.

929572589088813057 2017-11-11 04:52:30 UTC <JustineChamp> 2nd boy just wants to wrestle and nana isn't cut out for that anymore. Dads always wrestle the best. #teachcivilians #thankgodforbrothers
929572193356283904 2017-11-11 04:50:56 UTC <JustineChamp> Our 3rd kid was 3 months when he left. He's learned how to roll, grab things, & recognize his name since then. He doesn't know dad's smell.

929571204540776448 2017-11-11 04:47:00 UTC <JustineChamp> I wish he didn't have to do this just so our kids can have quality health insurance at a reasonable price. He had to leave his dream job too
929570987342946304 2017-11-11 04:46:08 UTC <JustineChamp> I miss him most at night when we finally got to have our conversations. When the kids are asleep and it's just us. #teachcivilians
929570390938075136 2017-11-11 04:43:46 UTC <JustineChamp> I cried because I'm alone w/ our 3 kids & I'm overwhelmingly tired. And I'm lucky enough to live w/ 2 adults who help me #itsnotthesameasdad

929558397233401856 2017-11-11 03:56:06 UTC <JustineChamp> So he joined the #Army and I married him despite my reservations because k couldn't live without him. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2011-12
929558110212993025 2017-11-11 03:54:58 UTC <JustineChamp> I KNEW how hard it would be so I tried to avoid #militarylife when the 2008 crash hit & the #loveofmylife graduated in dec 2008. #screwed
