971730994280747008 2018-03-08 12:54:57 UTC <sueapoling> @SuzyBlueLady @matthaig1 Same thing about #BlackLivesMatter doesnt mean other lives dont matter.  Just pointing out a specific set of problems that black men and women face.
971580295957925888 2018-03-07 02:56:08 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo as long as Trump is in the White House, nothing will change.  Dems are not having their voices heard because of the chant of Fake News from Trump camp, and Republicans just say nothing as long as Trump will forward their agenda.
971565584239427586 2018-03-07 01:57:40 UTC <sueapoling> .@delaneytarr this is how you know that what you are doing is right, and it is working.  Stay safe and keep working for good, and for what is right.  #neveragain
971563531769348096 2018-03-07 01:49:31 UTC <sueapoling> @ShaunKing @NormEisen @naja_pallida Well they passed a pesky little bill called the Affordable Care Act, and the Lilly Ledbetter fair pay act, those two alone give me faith in their courage.  Im sure that the trend would have continued butthey lost majority in midterms in 2010 and we all know what happened then.
971561003833004032 2018-03-07 01:39:28 UTC <sueapoling> Compared to you @seanspicer he is the very definition of class.  And as for @seanhannity there is no one as classless as you.
971560063042244609 2018-03-07 01:35:44 UTC <sueapoling> @ShaunKing @NormEisen @naja_pallida Dems dont have the power to pursue ( right now). But come November, Trump and his cronys better look out.
971559018199166977 2018-03-07 01:31:35 UTC <sueapoling> @canadeeana @NormEisen Wish this were true, but who is going to hold them to account?  Not the Republicans, and not the Democrats either if they cant get the House and Senate back in November.  If that transpires we will have a whole new ballgame.
971454017766387712 2018-03-07 18:34:21 UTC <sueapoling> @ShaunKing Thunder snow!  Happens all the time!
971445367702216704 2018-03-07 17:59:58 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Terry, your costumes make the show more real for me.  I look forward so much to see what you have in store for us. Its not always what i have imagined but it is always just right.
971390005389250560 2018-03-07 14:19:59 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro Ought to call the Beto ORourke people and give it to them as a slogan.  Nah, when they go low, we go high!!!
971367462821384192 2018-03-07 12:50:24 UTC <sueapoling> .@ChrisCuomo problem is that independent thinkers do not and will not speak up to say ENOUGH with this BS, and even if they did who on either side would listen?  The divide is to great, and peoples minds are made up.  It is depressing to talk to people from other side
971178157532418048 2018-03-06 00:18:11 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer But is it a breakthrough?  Since the N Koreans have lied before, and are likely to lie again, this breakthrough may just be a big fat nothing.
971176022388412416 2018-03-06 00:09:41 UTC <sueapoling> Not true, @AriFleischer . Trump never disavowed David Duke and allowed him to openly support him.  Thought neo-nazis at Charlottesville might be very good people.  People still support Trump regardless.  False equivalency.  You need to quit normalizing Trump.
971006154204737537 2018-03-06 12:54:42 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo Agree that Nunberg comments might be smoke/drink talking, but must have some knowledge otherwise Mueller wouldnt have subpoenaed him.
971001704652115968 2018-03-06 12:37:01 UTC <sueapoling> @krassenstein Implication is that there are so many that it would take forever
971001360249511936 2018-03-06 12:35:39 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump Your friend is this kind of guy.  You need to wake up and see that now @piersmorgan.
971000373275185152 2018-03-06 12:31:43 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom @MyREButterfly Truth hurt?
971000230610112512 2018-03-06 12:31:09 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom Joe, once again, i have to agree with you.  I feel as if i am in the twilight zone.
970999452881379329 2018-03-06 12:28:04 UTC <sueapoling> @MeghanMcCain Some crazy stuff, huh?  Now do we believe him or not?
970495926019198976 2018-03-04 03:07:14 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit Resigned for the good of the party.  He was becoming a distraction.  What about all Trumps accusers?  Why are some so quick to believe women against other men, but not the women against Trump?  I still believe in due process.
970488899205255169 2018-03-04 02:39:19 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit Sure, but they all dried up the minute resigned.  Wonder why?  Was the goal just that, to get him to resign?  Maybe not, but it just felt wrong somehow.  I know most women are truthful, but one liar makes me skeptical.  And there is the pesky business of due process.
970487260679417856 2018-03-04 02:32:48 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit Some are not.  Look what happened to Al Franken.  Guilty or not, as soon as he stepped down nothing was ever heard about any of the cases, ever again. Wow. Is that all they wanted, for him to step down?  Why?  And that is just one case.  Weinstein is the only one being prosecuted
970485867679805440 2018-03-04 02:27:16 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit I agree its rare, but i have known women that would do it.  I know their particular character.  I always want to believe, so trust but verify.   I want it to be so, that women would never lie about things like this, but the sad truth is that some, very few, would.
970479709791367173 2018-03-04 02:02:48 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit NO, but i can scenario when a female MIGHT lie.  Why cant you?
970479077240070145 2018-03-04 02:00:17 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit dont know the details but E! supposedly investigated and he was exonerated. If she had more then law enforcement should have been involved. If not, then MAYBE it was retaliation for him not responding to her. Not saying that is the way it happened, but we will never really know
970472795657330688 2018-03-04 01:35:19 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit Maybe. I know@people would be ruined if they were accused of child abuse. there would be a proper investigation and the people would still be ruined use because of an accusation even if exonerated. In most these cases,a womans word is all that it takes, no investigations at all
970470668130246657 2018-03-04 01:26:52 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit I also know what it is to have to keep silent because of fear.  Fear i would lose my job, fear that my own husband would not believe me, fear of worse retribution from the man.
970470141246033920 2018-03-04 01:24:46 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie @starlitefruit Agree, but can you admit the possibility even remotely that some woman might make something up for reasons of her own?
970468253897281537 2018-03-04 01:17:16 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie See, this is my other problem.  People like you want to call names and try to shame people to support your own agenda.  I support women and men until proven guilty.
970467701591302144 2018-03-04 01:15:05 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Not touching her in the photo and she was faking being asleep.  She was in on the joke and then tried to use it.  Why not use it when he ran for election?  That is the problem for me.  She wasnt raped or afraid for her life nor ever had to be alone with him, yet she was. Why?
970466894535905281 2018-03-04 01:11:52 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Not accusing anyone in particular of lying except the original accuser of Al Franken. However willing to give any woman the benefit of the doubt just as i would do for the man involved.  Evidence convicts people not one persons account male or female.
970465953560629249 2018-03-04 01:08:08 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Because you said that all women should be believed without exceptions.
970465821742026752 2018-03-04 01:07:36 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Do you think Al Franken was railroaded?  I do clearly think he was and will never believe otherwise.  Yet to you he will always be guilty?  Because a far right conservative woman wanted him out of the Senate
970465425812262912 2018-03-04 01:06:02 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie It is clear to me that you will never give anyone that is male the benefit of the doubt and clearly do not believe in due process.  I think any man who would harass or abuse a woman is reprehensible but i do know that some womenmight lie for their own reasons.
970464539354587136 2018-03-04 01:02:31 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Ever hear the phrase, trust but verify?
970464349189009408 2018-03-04 01:01:45 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie Can you even remotely agree that some women might make things up?  I have had sexual harassment happen to me too. I know what that means.  But i can also be realistic about a situation.  You do no one any favors when you blindly believe.  All Franken comes to mind.
970463291523915776 2018-03-04 00:57:33 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner @matsie I absolutely do support women in #metoo but i know that not all women are honest just like all men arent honest.  This type of accusation will ruin a persons life, and i would want due process.
970419648213733383 2018-03-04 22:04:08 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner Problem is, what is to say that some women are doing/saying things as revenge or something?  I support women in #metoo movement but also dont want to wrongly accuse a man just for the sake of the movement.
970376090572214272 2018-03-04 19:11:03 UTC <sueapoling> @chevrolet @ChrisJZullo Difference between a 22000 Korean car and a 35000 American made car.  To rich for my blood.  Would love to help but that extra 13000 goes a long way.
970316386399645696 2018-03-04 15:13:48 UTC <sueapoling> @mattmarohl Romney isnt a maverick, he is just another politician who will bow down to Trump. That stance is NOT helpful to Republicans.
970310891207102464 2018-03-04 14:51:58 UTC <sueapoling> @DenisMcDonough @chucktodd @Dande01 Believe this was in reaction of Trumps claim of changes to votes already cast, like hacking into election computers. Not meant as comment on Russian propaganda campaign on social media against Clinton that preyed on lowest educated who could not discern the difference.
970310099318263808 2018-03-04 14:48:49 UTC <sueapoling> @DenisMcDonough @chucktodd @mikepollak22 Love this analogy.
970097522718007297 2018-03-03 00:44:07 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom I am of the left and i dont want to get rid of guns. I own guns and know plenty about them.  But, i dont mind making it a bit harder to buy one if it will stop even 1 misguided, criminal, or mentally ill person from getting one to use on another person.  Thats all i ask.
969937027033632768 2018-03-03 14:06:22 UTC <sueapoling> @danpfeiffer @ShutUpAndrosky Not the only good thing, but one of the very best things. @AllisonBJanney
969933847398842369 2018-03-03 13:53:44 UTC <sueapoling> @erconger @RWPUSA Tell her, Oh Hell No!  Then delete as fast as you can.
969930426679791617 2018-03-03 13:40:08 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahKSilverman First world problems?
969929057801515009 2018-03-03 13:34:42 UTC <sueapoling> @CondoleezzaRice @FoxNews @ruthcherri @jpsal123 @lorilynn19 If Mr Trump had properly vetted these people, maybe he would have found the information about them. So, he wants us to believe that we should extreme vet immigrants, but not people helping run this country? I think if he didnt already know about their crimes then he was stupid
969645167253827584 2018-03-02 18:46:37 UTC <sueapoling> @Twitter @HagarHajjar @joshrogin @UnitersCentrist I just meant that Facebook is anonymous practically.
969644135501230083 2018-03-02 18:42:31 UTC <sueapoling> @Twitter @HagarHajjar @joshrogin @UnitersCentrist Thats true, but when you initially respond to people on FB you have no idea if they are who they say they are.
969612728137666561 2018-03-02 16:37:43 UTC <sueapoling> @CondoleezzaRice @FoxNews @ruthcherri @jpsal123 I dont hate Trump at all,and certainly not because Hillary lost. The reason i dont like Trump is because he is bad for the Country. He seems like he is corrupt due to all the guilty http://pleas.Do you think Trump was duped by all those who pleaded guilty?
969611772289314816 2018-03-02 16:33:55 UTC <sueapoling> @CondoleezzaRice @AriFleischer @FoxNews No, we are not ready to move on.  This needs to be seen through to its ultimate conclusion.  One way or another, we need to see it through.
969553655102918656 2018-03-02 12:42:59 UTC <sueapoling> @Twitter @HagarHajjar @joshrogin @UnitersCentrist Facebook users are NOT verified.  You can hide behind fake profiles, call yourself by any name and say anything that crosses you mind without real retribution.
969277704771121153 2018-03-01 18:26:27 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo No risk to Trump, who will call him in it?  They havent called him on any of his other BS.
969274039968698380 2018-03-01 18:11:54 UTC <sueapoling> @DLoesch @AriFleischer Name calling from either side is uncalled for.  I have been called everything from libtard to  baby killer from conservatives.
969187760702742529 2018-03-01 12:29:03 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Ive been thinking this daily.
969185559406170112 2018-03-01 12:20:18 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared @chippy_the_hero Principle went inside one and it was tested for being bulletproof.  In fairness these were designed for tornado shelters which is a much more common occurrence here in OK than school shootings.
969184737070862336 2018-03-01 12:17:02 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared while i agree that it appears we are giving in to the chaos, at least the did something.  Its more than i can say for Congress.
969182798501343232 2018-03-01 12:09:20 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Its all bluster.  Hell back down when Wayne LaPierre explains it to him.  No NRA money or support.
969181320399204359 2018-03-01 12:03:27 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo aint that just the truth?
968927741641883648 2018-02-28 19:15:50 UTC <sueapoling> @AP One thing i can say, i dont agree with Jeff Sessions, but he wants to try to do what he thinks is the right thing.
968926880287031296 2018-02-28 19:12:24 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @AP @MikeAJGriffin @Iochev9763 @WhoKares34 @Magurkk @_Seedsy_ No, but we do take away the persons license to drive.  How about license for gun owners.
968832762449940482 2018-02-28 12:58:25 UTC <sueapoling> @JenAshleyWright Logic is not a word these people understand.
968832182751023104 2018-02-28 12:56:07 UTC <sueapoling> @Lee_in_Iowa The problem is that in their sick little minds they believe what they are doing is right.  The problem is, their minds will never be changed.  This is why these people are so dangerous.
968667355340525568 2018-02-27 02:01:09 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared I want to read more of the essay on the misconceptions about Islam!  This was from high school?
968662497992609792 2018-02-27 01:41:51 UTC <sueapoling> @NathanLerner @oufenix Im in Oklahoma too and Ive been saying this for a while!
968661531020808192 2018-02-27 01:38:00 UTC <sueapoling> @NathanLerner Ive been saying this for a while now. In red states,if a dem gets elected they still have to rep their red constituency, not just the dems in the state. Need to be moderate enough to appeal to those republicans that might crossover and vote dem when their candidates are to right
968660293566988288 2018-02-27 01:33:05 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Of course as Trumps son in law, what are the chances that he will have access to this info through Trump himself in the residence.  This is the problem with nepotism in The White House and with a POTUS that thinks all this is fun and likens it to a reality show.
968467500110417921 2018-02-27 12:46:59 UTC <sueapoling> @Richard_Schiff Sequel only if it is to the real West Wing!
968282406166941696 2018-02-26 00:31:30 UTC <sueapoling> @NRA @Delta @CaseyCagle The solution you propose to punish @delta if not illegal, ought to be.
968099256950280192 2018-02-26 12:23:43 UTC <sueapoling> @igzrap Her feet?  Just guessing here.  WTF is the problem?
968098698726080512 2018-02-26 12:21:30 UTC <sueapoling> @PoliticalEduVA This was a big nothing burger, but this is what ultimately cost her the election.  This is the medias handiwork.  Not enough vetting of Trump, who they thought was a joke, and too much vetting of Clinton, who was not a joke.
968093732523343872 2018-02-26 12:01:46 UTC <sueapoling> @PreetBharara This is main pet peeve. In offering an opposing opinion,the 1st thing i get is a name calling person. At that point all efforts for civilized discourse are tarnished and i give up the effort entirely. Anyone who would call you a name is a person who will never change their mind
967864279482404865 2018-02-25 20:50:00 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Kind of like the Republicans march to the right?  We need more centrist from both parties to bring us some perspective.
967778893909372928 2018-02-25 15:10:43 UTC <sueapoling> @itsmebeccam I agree that sexism is becoming rampant, but Randy Bryce has a better chance of beating Paul Ryan and that is the ultimate goal. Cathy Myers got in too late and not enough financial support. Dems must stand together and not split along gender lines. Vote for candidate not gender.
967777422941843461 2018-02-25 15:04:52 UTC <sueapoling> .@ananavarro this is a world turned upside down.  The only answer i can see if to make sure as many people as possible got in 2018 and 2020.
967766155711664130 2018-02-25 14:20:06 UTC <sueapoling> @erconger @krassenstein Yes, they want to pick and choose what rights we can have.  Thats why we must vote these people out of office in 2018& 2020.
967765071240814592 2018-02-25 14:15:47 UTC <sueapoling> @NRA @WalshFreedom Joe, the #NRA must re-examine their policies.  No one wants to take away law abiding citizens guns, but even you must admit there is a problem and help be part of a solution.
967112183426572289 2018-02-23 19:01:27 UTC <sueapoling> @kylegriffin1 Do they not vet these people before they put them up for nomination?
967012353052172289 2018-02-23 12:24:45 UTC <sueapoling> @JoshMalina @apuhr Sorkin likes to use same plot devices in his different show.  Compare Studio 60 to The Newsroom.  Similar story lines.
967011985438240769 2018-02-23 12:23:18 UTC <sueapoling> @JoshMalina @apuhr Sorkin even repeated some dialogue from The American President on The West Wing.  I caught it on my first viewing of The West Wing when i didnt even know Sorkin wrote The American President.
966776451780489222 2018-02-22 20:47:22 UTC <sueapoling> @DLoesch @AriFleischer @berthyman Ok, supposed to be our leader!  280 characters were not enough.  Sorry!
966730447475630080 2018-02-22 17:44:34 UTC <sueapoling> @DLoesch @AriFleischer Also from Trump, racial slurs like Pocahontas, referring to the size of Marco Rubios penis, when is he going to stop the name calling?  He is our leader and he is saying that its ok to call people names.
966729860134686721 2018-02-22 17:42:14 UTC <sueapoling> @DLoesch @AriFleischer This is main problem.People feel ok to attack each other personally.Words like Libtard, and slurs like Killary,orObummer,come from Repubs all the time. If we cant have a dialogue without personal attacks then we will never get anything done. Trump is the worst name caller yet.
966652944044249088 2018-02-22 12:36:36 UTC <sueapoling> @toddstarnes Give them a ride to the venue, make sure they were prepared with their remarks, then feel proud when they stood up for their opinion and rights to express them.
966462559145676800 2018-02-21 00:00:04 UTC <sueapoling> @AP_Politics What Im more astounded about is that he has 45 monogrammed on his cuff?  Egotistical much?
966168483640889345 2018-02-20 04:31:31 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH NRA should advocate for laws that make children and all people safer in regards to gun violence.  Why do they oppose safety measures?  Why would any law abiding citizen oppose laws that make us safer?
966141961349533697 2018-02-20 02:46:08 UTC <sueapoling> @gman_in_gville @IL0VEthe80s #kojack Telly Savalas was so sexy!
966139916567621634 2018-02-20 02:38:00 UTC <sueapoling> @chrislhayes @LouiseMensch Evidence can only come from friends and relatives who love the criminals.
966134000648708096 2018-02-20 02:14:30 UTC <sueapoling> @kitkat_kira No one i know watches @Outlander_STARZ either, that is why i join a lot of these groups to have friends to talk with.
966132494167937024 2018-02-20 02:08:31 UTC <sueapoling> Well @marcorubio these people spreading these lies are your Republican colleagues.  Talk to them and ask them to stop this hateful, spiteful rhetoric.  Some people are believing these lies and it must stop now.
966113383786348544 2018-02-20 00:52:34 UTC <sueapoling> @gman_in_gville Will they fly you to Dallas soon?  They should make accommodations for you!

965258158846496773 2018-02-18 16:14:13 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Well i can agree with that, but your boy Trump is more concerned with his reputation and making sure no one thinks he colluded that stopping this crap from happening again.
965245808680620032 2018-02-18 15:25:08 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Do you rly  think that Russia was not able to steer Trump to run in 2016 even though this started earlier?If so you have no idea what they are truly capable of.Also,is it your opinion that Trump if not in cahoots with Russia ought to DO something to stop this from happening again
965244676734423040 2018-02-18 15:20:38 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Obama wanted to release the info about Russian meddling in the election, but Mitch McConnell deterred him.  Ole Mitch didnt want the information to affect the election hahaha.  Well that backfired spectacularly.
965244100877438977 2018-02-18 15:18:21 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Sure the tried to help Bernie and Jill Stein too.  But they got Trump Elected.
965241904366571521 2018-02-18 15:09:37 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Wasnt it Trump that asked Russia to spy on Clinton?  Wasnt it Trump Jr who met with Russians to get dirt ( help) from the Russians?  Wasnt it Russia who blitzed our social media and tricked US citizens to help Trump get elected?  You have to ask yourself Why!
965241110523203584 2018-02-18 15:06:28 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @MoormanDwayne Difference of opinion.  I think that your premise is BS.
965224967683084290 2018-02-18 14:02:19 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods @Huw_Merlin @justpaulstuff FWIW, Netanyahu has been indicted by his own government.  So does that put Obama on the right side of that fight?
965224530548576256 2018-02-18 14:00:35 UTC <sueapoling> @RealJamesWoods Mr Woods, Mr Trump is not being pushed around by the Russians like SHS says.  No, he is being led around by the Russians.  Obama was obstructed at every turn by idiots like you.  You, sir,are no patriot.  You are a enabler of a tool like Trump.  Shame on you.
964966370579570690 2018-02-17 20:54:45 UTC <sueapoling> @SarahLerner It is so sad that our young people have to feel this way about the people and the system that is supposed to protect them.  Shame on them and us for not protecting them.
964905107816157184 2018-02-17 16:51:19 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Problem is that only point of view from the other side is name calling and whataboutism.  That is not helpful or constructive to learning about the other side.
964904319765139456 2018-02-17 16:48:11 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH I dont care who Trump had relations with, especially before election.  Problem is not the sex, but the cover up/pay-offs,are to these women.  Can you see potential for blackmail.  Clinton was impeached for this.  Is Trump not held to the same standard?
964859946344026112 2018-02-17 13:51:52 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Obviously not enough winning this week.  Remember, his supporters still believe that he can do NO wrong.
964856047893704704 2018-02-17 13:36:22 UTC <sueapoling> @TomDangora We havent had a president since Obama left office.  This will never convince Trump supporters of his complicity though.  Remember he said he could shoot someone on 5th Ave and not lose supporters?  It is so true, then and now.
964849651890442240 2018-02-17 13:10:57 UTC <sueapoling> @Lee_in_Iowa @K200mph Love these kids!  There is hope in my heart for the next generation of adults.  They see clearly what needs to be done and they are not afraid to get it done!
964635211295346688 2018-02-16 22:58:51 UTC <sueapoling> @jaketapper Once again agreeing with @WalshFreedom .  What is the world coming to?
964634780968120320 2018-02-16 22:57:08 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan even you have to admit that the indictment of 13 Russians is serious news.
964480086748663811 2018-02-16 12:42:26 UTC <sueapoling> @CNN @BernieSanders @tedcruz Yeah, but where ya at now, Ted?
964479357849915397 2018-02-16 12:39:32 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @LeeGeller14 @Hubblesview @eleighjo No, in Florida to purchase an AR-15 you do not have to adhere to the 3 day waiting period.  Also no background check.
964478854051090432 2018-02-16 12:37:32 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @eleighjo If you want to protest a tyrannical government to overthrow, look no further than the current one.  I say if you want to overthrow the government with your weapons now is the time.  (Sarcasm).
964477845807484928 2018-02-16 12:33:32 UTC <sueapoling> Yes he is sorry @piersmorgan. The whole damn bunch of them are sorry if they cant see the need for sensible gun laws that will protect our citizens
964474571792502784 2018-02-16 12:20:31 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom Or how about no drunk driving laws, because, you know, someone somewhere will break that law.  So lets just have no laws.  Joe, i have sided with you recently on some comments, and we are politically opposites so dont ruin it now with these boneheaded statements.
964108590310141959 2018-02-15 12:06:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TomiLahren @mmurphy0907 @reddaug17 No legislation can ever stop someone from robbing a bank, but we still have laws against i!
964108338190585857 2018-02-15 12:05:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TomiLahren Maybe we can@have some laws making it harder for lunatics to get guns?  What do you say Tomi?
963996684299718656 2018-02-14 04:41:34 UTC <sueapoling> @ShepSmithNews @NicolleDWallace The only sane voice at Fox News
963993530204028928 2018-02-14 04:29:02 UTC <sueapoling> @ABCWorldNews As well they should.  They are responsible for not enacting stricter access to this type of weapon.
963991811982331904 2018-02-14 04:22:12 UTC <sueapoling> @timkaine Good work by both parties.  Not perfect by any means but good compromise.
963848106700951552 2018-02-14 18:51:10 UTC <sueapoling> @FictionalFacts2 They are afraid of losing their WH credentials.
963844491328278528 2018-02-14 18:36:48 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer @RHONDA_USA Kind of like Al Franken?
963844075567894528 2018-02-14 18:35:09 UTC <sueapoling> @lukerosiak @AriFleischer @SleepingGiant16 No!  They passed the info along to Trump/White House.  They refused or neglected to act.  Trump/White House hurt themselves.
963842887061508096 2018-02-14 18:30:26 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Make it something a little bit more current.
963590412786110464 2018-02-13 01:47:11 UTC <sueapoling> @SpeakerRyan @canadeeana @IronStache He is just drooling to take away your hard earned Social Security benefits.
963480600912031745 2018-02-13 18:30:50 UTC <sueapoling> @DailyMail .@piersmorgan it is convenient for you to post this now.  Where were these allegations when Trump hired her?  If you had told the story then it would have carried more weight.
963390940957368320 2018-02-13 12:34:33 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG They need to get off your back about this issue.  Not our place to question your choice of drink.
963109599829250048 2018-02-12 17:56:36 UTC <sueapoling> @FreeBeacon @AriFleischer @bencamenker I didnt put as much weight in the bush tape, bragging about pussy grabbing,i didnt dismiss the Larry Nasser accusations because the were actually criminal,Trump does think sm Nazi sympathizers are very good people,so your premise is flawed. In 2013,who knows what hpned why now?
963096925225607169 2018-02-12 17:06:15 UTC <sueapoling> @FreeBeacon @AriFleischer In 2013?  Get real.

Like this is normal and just another President. His supporters are cultish and cant see what he is doing to them.
962812040028057601 2018-02-11 22:14:13 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright Would be an interesting read, but agree.  We all know that Nunes memo is BS.
962490554205507585 2018-02-10 00:56:44 UTC <sueapoling> @BillOReilly People who pay off their accusers to avoid prosecution should not be speaking out on this issue.
962488461205917696 2018-02-10 00:48:25 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright @JohnJHarwood I want Trump to be prosecuted for committed crimes, but there is a faction, including Trump, who still wants to prosecute HRC.  My red friends all think she and Obama are the criminals.  Nothing will convince them. Trump has claimed fake news too often and it is affecting people.
962449014808612864 2018-02-10 22:11:41 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright @JohnJHarwood The hypocrisy of this administration is stunning. That supporters of Trump can not see this, amazes me.  What is happening to our country, and what can we do to stop it. Turning the Congress Blue is not going to be the ultimate answer.  So much misinformation has made us mistrust
962145663546019842 2018-02-09 02:06:16 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Tell Trump that.  He defended him.  No word for the 2 women he abused.  Domestic violence is everywhere but we should all condem it.

More than i can say about the GOP led congress and their tax cut for the rich bill that will add billions if not trillions to the National debt.

961706912428515328 2018-02-08 21:02:50 UTC <sueapoling> @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @EdMahalick @DGypsy62 I am not arguing with someone who will not budge on their opinion.  Also, i work for a living and dont have time for you.

Also he is a Republican and was not involved in any of this crap until after the fact.  STOP listening to only Fox or reading Brietbart News. Im not going to argue with you any more. It is evident you have made up your mind
961673179415699458 2018-02-08 18:48:47 UTC <sueapoling> @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @EdMahalick @DGypsy62 Mueller wasnt even involved AT ALL.

If you want to believe conspiracy theories, go right ahead.  I will say that there is more evidence of Russian collusion with Trump than evidence of any of the things you mentioned. Alex Jones must be your news source.

961578396672253952 2018-02-08 12:32:09 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @HuevosDeChivo Not shifting his opinion.  If you release fisa application info, release it all.  Dont cherry pick the info for things that fit your own narrative.  Get it ALL out there and then see whats what. Nunes only released what fit his version, not the whole thing.  See the difference?
961352276219658240 2018-02-07 21:33:38 UTC <sueapoling> @SamChampion Filling in for @Ginger_Zee while shes on maternity leave?
961293005096448000 2018-02-07 17:38:07 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo @griffith1798 Politics do not change the information in the dossier.  If you found out your spouse was cheating on you but the information came from her ex-boyfriend would the information be less valid?
961292125420781568 2018-02-07 17:34:37 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo People dont want to understand because it doesnt fit their narrative of Trumps propaganda.
961218921662681093 2018-02-07 12:43:44 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo While i cant stand @TGowdySC  politics, i respect his view that the ultimate goal should not be about winning. It should be about living to the highest moral standard.  That is not happening in politics right now. We need to demand our leaders do what is right, not what will win
961029917805809665 2018-02-06 00:12:42 UTC <sueapoling> @Scaramucci While i disagree with your premise, i will always support your right to present it to us through the media.
961029108061933568 2018-02-06 00:09:29 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Kind of like North Korea?  We need to have a parade to show how strong we are?
960261764842737665 2018-02-04 21:20:20 UTC <sueapoling> @Richard_Schiff Never watched The West Wing while on the air, but through Netflix have binge watched the entire series twice.  I always thought that Toby was Bartletts conscience.  He was the most dedicated public servant.
960159785780957184 2018-02-04 14:35:06 UTC <sueapoling> @BarackObama @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI @RepAdamSchiff @SHARKSURVIVOR1 A lot of very powerful people conspired against Trump in your opinion but Trump was smarter than all of them and since he is so pure (meaning white) that he beat them all with just his brain and no help at all from Russia, who we KNOW interfered in our elections.
960153595080560642 2018-02-04 14:10:30 UTC <sueapoling> @BarackObama @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI @RepAdamSchiff @SHARKSURVIVOR1 Also, since they didnt steal the election and Trump is President should tell you something.  It is so strange that with all these powerful people conspiring against Trump that he was able to win the election.
960152972415131648 2018-02-04 14:08:02 UTC <sueapoling> @BarackObama @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI @RepAdamSchiff @SHARKSURVIVOR1 Because that is not what happened.  Trump has you all in his conspiracy theory fantasy.  You need to wake up and see that Trump is trying to subvert the system to his advantage and will use the smallest thing to prove his point.
959927858264231936 2018-02-03 23:13:30 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump Speaking of oneself in the 3rd person, is that crazy?
959879233156808704 2018-02-03 20:00:17 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 @JoeBlow31581725 Have you seen the omissions from the warrant? For that matter have you seen the warrant to know what other supporting documents were used to get it? As you have said, show me evidence that NO other docs were used to obtain the warrant except Steel Dossier.  Put up or shut up.
959875107253575686 2018-02-03 19:43:53 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 @JoeBlow31581725 You realize the memo is not evidence though,right? It was written by Nunes staff and Nunes didnt even look at the underlying documents,namely the FISA warrant.Trey Gowdy, another repub hero, who did read the underlying doc,says this does not discredit Mueller.Maybe there is more
959872266057191424 2018-02-03 19:32:36 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBlow31581725 @GloriaBB2 Also, Wray is a Trump appointee. Why would he make stuff up to make Trump look bad? Everyone is against POOR Trump.If you cant see that the very idea of Trump being investigated is extremely bad for the country then I guess he COULD shoot someone on 5th Ave & not loose support
959860159475576832 2018-02-03 18:44:30 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @usa_comes_back @GloriaBB2 Karma is a bitch. Of course that comment by SHS only applied to HRC and not to Trump.  (At least in her small mind.)
959859150565052418 2018-02-03 18:40:29 UTC <sueapoling> @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBlow31581725 Do you have evidence that the ONLY evidence the FISA court considered in the warrant was the Steele Dossier? Dont you think that the warrant included other, corroborating evidence? Do you really think the FBI told the court, this is all we have but please give us warrant anyway
959843385468178434 2018-02-03 17:37:50 UTC <sueapoling> @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBlow31581725 Well, omission of some of the facts and cherry picking what facts to present makes this seem worse than it is.  This is the definition of alternative facts.  Facts chosen to make your own point but leaving out the ones that refute your point.
959783054884704258 2018-02-03 13:38:06 UTC <sueapoling> @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff @johnpricci I really agree that thinking they are all Russian compromised is a bit far, but why ruin their credibility on someone like Trump?  While never a Republican, there used to be those i could respect.  But now? No way in hell could i trust another Republican.
959782341957779456 2018-02-03 13:35:16 UTC <sueapoling> @foxandfriends @PressSec @VP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff @The821_821 @ChristineTweet1 Not worried about the FBI in the least, but what you Trump people should be worried about is the destruction of our Institutions over a seriously corrupt administration.  Wake up and see what is going on is extremely dangerous.
959781455831420928 2018-02-03 13:31:45 UTC <sueapoling> @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff @igor_plahuta Of course i have read it.  It is a thinly veiled attempt to discredit the FBI and Mueller.  Those of us who live in the real world and not Trump LaLa land can discern the truth.
959659915718594560 2018-02-02 05:28:48 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 @Playdrome12 Obama nor Clinton are in office and last i checked Republicans held all 3 branches of gov.   Trump only cares about Trump & Comp.  Im so sorry that you will be disappointed when Trump goes down.  You seem so sincere.
959657866696298496 2018-02-02 05:20:39 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 @crikitrn I said with, but on works for me.  I wouldnt be totally surprised.  Methinks Mr Pence doth protest about gays too much.  I believe he is closeted but really goes for butch types like Trump and Putin.
959656263352307712 2018-02-02 05:14:17 UTC <sueapoling> @NOW1SOLAR @WalshFreedom Joe, Im beginning to think you are a true patriot.  Country over party, you go Joe!
959654132335431680 2018-02-02 05:05:49 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer @SenatorLankford As a constituent, I urge you to tell it to Trump.  He is playing footsy with Russia, and is blinded by Putins strength that he wants for himself.   He will continue leading us down this path until we wont recognize ourselves anymore if you wont help stop this madness.
959611433582546944 2018-02-02 02:16:09 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 Well that is surely true.  Guess we will need a wait and see approach.
959608485532061696 2018-02-02 02:04:26 UTC <sueapoling> @RepAdamSchiff @GloriaBB2 Yes but why protect Trump?  Pence could do the same if Trump went down.  This is why the whole thing doesnt make sense to me.  There has to be some other reason. And if Pence goes down with Trump, Ryan would be POTUS and then bingo, Republicans problem solved.
959605431445442561 2018-02-02 01:52:18 UTC <sueapoling> @GloriaBB2 @RepAdamSchiff Nunes and his memo do more to show the cravenness of the Republicans and what they will do to protect Trump.  The real question is why.  Why would they protect the corrupt administration?  My only answer is they are tainted by the Russians too.
959126743566180352 2018-02-01 18:10:10 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @TGowdySC @GovMikeHuckabee You have got to be kidding me!
959076002524811265 2018-02-01 14:48:32 UTC <sueapoling> @MorningsMaria @TheHRH How about those of us in lower tax brackets?  I got an extra $8.00.  Yes you read that right $8.00.  In a biweekly pay check that adds up to and extra $208.00 per year.  That might buy my groceries for a couple of weeks.  Better than nothing but just barely.
957637417267277825 2018-01-28 15:32:06 UTC <sueapoling> @saletan So its ok to pay off blackmailers as long as it is just between you and your spouse on the eve of the election?  I call BS.
957039579135139841 2018-01-26 23:56:31 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Because Obama is not POTUS.  He is not the story.  You Republicans need to move on.  Clinton didnt get elected, Obama is out of office.  Forget about them.  Focus on what is happening now.
956959604801527809 2018-01-26 18:38:43 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @richardmarx How about if he doesnt know anything about a subject he learn before he tweets.  The need to inform himself never crosses his mind.  Just act first and get the facts later.
956703810361151493 2018-01-25 01:42:17 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Im dirt poor and even i say a grand isnt much money in the scheme of things.  I would last me 1 day, if that.
956590016293228544 2018-01-25 18:10:07 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom whats going on Joe.  You are beginning to sound sensible.

955088606363901953 2018-01-21 14:44:03 UTC <sueapoling> @FoxNewsSunday ask why Republicans didnt fund CHIP when it expired.  Did they keep this issue for bargaining at this point to make the Democrats look bad?
954693805927694337 2018-01-20 12:35:15 UTC <sueapoling> @WestWingReport Republicans who hold both houses of Congress and the Oval Office.  They need to get their finger out of their ear and hear Americans say get to work and get this done.  But dont ever forget they obstructed Obamas presidency and they are doing it again now.
954693077402312710 2018-01-20 12:32:21 UTC <sueapoling> @MohamedMOSalih Shitshow?
954690715233259520 2018-01-20 12:22:58 UTC <sueapoling> I can get behind you on this @TheHRH.  Dont always agree, but youre right.  Make Congress subject to rules and laws just like us and thing will change quicker.
954334572807950336 2018-01-19 12:47:47 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro Doesnt he mean passes?..
954165240295579648 2018-01-18 01:34:55 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @tlfordsc Not allowing Haitians, Africans, Muslims into our country under any circumstances, not sending sufficient hurricane help to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, wanting to build a wall to keep Mexican rapist and drug dealers out need any more???

953793185960091649 2018-01-17 00:56:30 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @sweetie911 I did not use that word, however i did initial it.  Sorry if the F offends you.  However, i was very civil.  You told me to shut my pie hole.
953698520304963586 2018-01-17 18:40:20 UTC <sueapoling> @sweetie911 I am not angry in the least.  But you told me to shut my pie hole.  I did not say a word about you, just asked what you were talking about.  I only said in original post that i disagreed with @TheHRH.  Maybe a civil dialogue would have been better.
953690133081010177 2018-01-17 18:07:01 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @sweetie911 WTF are you even talking about??? I just said i disagree.  You need to get anger management help.
953606794462494720 2018-01-17 12:35:51 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Heather, i have agreed with you from time to time.  The idea is to expose yourself to many viewpoints so as to form your own opinion and not just be in an echo chamber.  On this we cannot agree.  The President is a racist and his claim to the contrary is dispelled by his actions.
953440830093750274 2018-01-16 01:36:22 UTC <sueapoling> @erconger @Kaepernick7 I have believed this my whole life.  The person who wont stand up for injustice is more danger than those who express their bigotry openly.  At least with the openly bigoted person you know who you are dealing with.
953060179435810816 2018-01-15 00:23:48 UTC <sueapoling> @CarolineFeraday I think you are being disingenuous, @piersmorgan .  You know what @carolineferaday meant.  Trump has no integrity, no class, and no brains in any measurability.
952166438067953664 2018-01-13 13:12:23 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 I believe this to be true, and yet so disgraceful.  Trump has debased our country and exposed the dirty, filthy, underbelly of our country and held it up to say this is what is right.  We must do everything we can to counter this,  and him.

951070645881851909 2018-01-10 12:38:06 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Wrong.  Can you not see the truth in Mr. Simpsons testimony?  They never expected to find what they found, just looking for the normal stuff any oppo research would find.  Like irregular business dealings and such.  Why do people like you want to not see the truth.
950713041137659905 2018-01-09 12:57:07 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared Also she acts as an advisor to the POTUS.  If she cant stand the heat, she needs to get out of the political arena.
949429681266286594 2018-01-05 23:57:30 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Not that he didnt want to win, but that he thought there was no way he would win.  He wanted it badly.

947169492760711168 2017-12-30 18:16:19 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan How in the living hell did you think he was gonna get all that done with the obstructionist Republican Congress?  They can barely pass any bills when all 3 branches are on the same Republican team?
947141332681875456 2017-12-30 16:24:25 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan While not a saint by ny stretch of the imagination, compared to Trump he is all the saints wrapped into one.  At least he was sane and cogent compared to your imbecile buddy.
947102348308111366 2017-12-30 13:49:30 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer by allowing him to talk candidly off the cuff to a reporter Trump has been shown to be incoherent, scattered, and unable to hold together a single thought.  It would be sad if he were just the host of The Apprentice, but as the President he is dangerously unhinged.
946723031761727488 2017-12-29 12:42:14 UTC <sueapoling> @Amy_Siskind Trump is dangerous.  Someone should have stopped it, but it shows how demented he is.  His thought process is scattered to the wind, he cant even put together a coherent thought.  So sad for him, but truly dangerous for the rest of us.
946721949446819840 2017-12-29 12:37:56 UTC <sueapoling> @nytmike @draiochta14 @JoyAnnReid He is demented.  Someone should send a doctor right away.  This would be funny if it werent so dangerous.
946720997314621440 2017-12-29 12:34:09 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Not only is it sad, but frightening beyond belief.  The man seems scattered to the wind and cant hold a coherent thought.
946716054788759554 2017-12-29 12:14:31 UTC <sueapoling> Your analysis would be spot on if Trump were still host of The Apprentice, but he is the President of these United States and his words and deeds are reprehensible.  How can even you defend him @piersmorgan

942182489132535808 2017-12-16 23:59:44 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Strange thing about denying the will of the people.  Sometimes people think they know what they want, and then find out what the want is really bad for them so they change their mind?  Hum, could that be what Mr. Blair is saying?

941469508543373312 2017-12-14 00:46:37 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer There are a lot of things going on in the GOP that if they happened under President Obamas watch they would have had him up on charges and in jail.  You GOPers need to self examine.
941282206168813569 2017-12-14 12:22:20 UTC <sueapoling> @CapehartJ @marlenescerrato Didnt mean it literally. I just meant it was because of people like her who backed and encouraged others to back someone like Jill Stein/Bernie Sanders who had zero chance of winning.  That, in part, got Trump elected.
941281264702840832 2017-12-14 12:18:36 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo The tweet congratulating Jones was by someone who snatched away his phone or found it lying on the desk.  The tweet about Strang was all Trump.
941280424730484736 2017-12-14 12:15:16 UTC <sueapoling> @CapehartJ Yes, because of this misguided woman we have Donald Trump for POTUS.

940944446677508096 2017-12-13 14:00:12 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Suspect first tweet that congratulated Jones was someone else who had grabbed away his phone.  This is vintage Trump so know it was written by him.

He put this country over his personal life and removed the distraction from the room. That is more than I can say about the cowards in the GOP who dont have a pair between them.
938865618396303360 2017-12-07 20:19:41 UTC <sueapoling> @PrisonPlanet @rosalynbecker77 This is the biggest bullshit excuse i have ever heard.  They dont let him do it.  They are so stunned when he does it that they cant even think for s minute and have to process, what just happened?  Can you see the fucking difference?
938840203095150592 2017-12-07 18:38:41 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Im thinking no, but we will see.  The allegations against Trump have been going on for a long time and no one in authority has said a word. Bunch of chicken s**ts the lot of them.
938838742546206720 2017-12-07 18:32:53 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Franken should not have resigned, but now that he has, Democrats need to be calling at the top of their lungs for Trump to resign and Moore to drop out.  Im beginning to think Dems (and Im one) are eating their own.
938836410534125568 2017-12-07 18:23:37 UTC <sueapoling> @joncoopertweets Im calling and have been calling for Trump to resign.  My voice carries no weight.  Senators and Congressmen must begin holding Republicans to the same standard.
938747536885592065 2017-12-07 12:30:28 UTC <sueapoling> @SharonReedCBS46 @Lawrence This is the best thing i have seen in a while.  Good for her.
938596865498632192 2017-12-06 02:31:45 UTC <sueapoling> @alfranken, do not go along with the Republican effort to make you a scapegoat. They will seat Moore anyway and we will have one less voice in the Senate to combat the nonsense. #IStandWithAlFranken
938594101477470209 2017-12-06 02:20:46 UTC <sueapoling> @SenGillibrand you are a hypocrite for calling on @SenFranken to resign, but wont raise your voice against Trump who has been accused of much worse than trying to cop a feel.  While i support these women, the crimes are not equivalent.  You are playing into the hands to Repubs
938592207346511872 2017-12-06 02:13:15 UTC <sueapoling> @SenFranken Whatever you do, do not resign. You do not deserve this and there are those that know and believe in you.
938389781255516166 2017-12-06 12:48:52 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 Convinced that this is not about morals rather about votes on the senate floor at ANY cost.  They will take a pedophile over a Democrat any day to get their vote count up. The Rebublicans that would vote for this man have no morals.
938388638823600128 2017-12-06 12:44:20 UTC <sueapoling> @usembassyta @OSACState @Lee_in_Iowa @USCGJerusalem It is truly a shame when US has to warn its citizens about travel to the holy land.
938388045883199489 2017-12-06 12:41:59 UTC <sueapoling> @WestWingReport False Equivalence.  Trump wouldnt care if he cost the tax payers billions.  He thinks he is a king and is ruling by fiat
938386773310431232 2017-12-06 12:36:55 UTC <sueapoling> @counterchekist @JeffFlake Still dont agree with your politics, but respect you for speaking out for what is right.  #countryoverparty
938206475121582080 2017-12-05 00:40:29 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 Will you still believe that when his crimes come to light and its proven, or will you still deny and think it was all made up?  I hope to God that i am wrong about him, but if Im not then will you be willing to entertain that thought?
938205933653684225 2017-12-05 00:38:20 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 Do you really feel that Trump is totally innocent and almost everyone is lying about him?  You seem like the type of mom who thinks their child can do no wrong when the child is the devil incarnate and everyone knows it,
938205403921506304 2017-12-05 00:36:13 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 You obviously only read Breitbart and watch Fox.  I watch and read lots of sources, even Fox, but dont have to be a genius to see where this is leading.  You should spread your viewing and reading around to get a better grip on reality.
938204180954697728 2017-12-05 00:31:22 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 obstruction of justice is directly related 2 the Russian investigation. Trump knew what was going on, had people lie about it or knew the were lying to cover up the crime and that, my friend, is obstruction.  Collusion is what they did that required obstruction
938184411845099520 2017-12-05 23:12:49 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 Do you really think Trump allowed ANYONE to operate on his behalf without his knowledge?  Naive.
938184035704229888 2017-12-05 23:11:19 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 Im not a lawyer, i have no authority to indict anyone but i think the evidence will show that they all lied to cover up the harsh truth that you refuse to face.  Trumps a crook who stole the election with help from Russia
938022447017873413 2017-12-05 12:29:13 UTC <sueapoling> @MittRomney @JeffFlake while i dont ageee with your politics, i applaud your voice in supporting country over party in this matter.  Have we sunk so low that a child molester is elevated to Senator to save a vote for the party?
938018430044770307 2017-12-05 12:13:15 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 One very big fish in his administration just pled guilty to lying and if you think Trump didnt know, you have your head in the sand.
938018072002285568 2017-12-05 12:11:50 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh @honeybee7885 The indictment of Trumps minions, and Flynns guilty plea tell the tale.  Of course i have no evidence.  I am a citizen of this country and i am expressing my right to voice my opinion.  What proof do you have that he didnt ask people to lie?
937852039081709569 2017-12-04 01:12:05 UTC <sueapoling> @bendreyfuss Might be stupid but its true!  LOL
937843234176421889 2017-12-04 00:37:05 UTC <sueapoling> @MeghanMcCain @ananavarro The every day neighbors who are fanatics have soured some on how to have civil discourse.  I live in deeply red state and have been called all kinds of names because i have liberal views.  People have forgotten how to talk to each other.
937840670475280384 2017-12-04 00:26:54 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared And the home of the chicken shit mofos
937838045398798336 2017-12-04 00:16:28 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh What do you think is coming for Trump?  He had Flynn and Kushner and others lie for him then he paid them off by giving them high powered jobs.  Same as Nixon, and hes going down, just like Nixon.
937836903080103936 2017-12-04 00:11:56 UTC <sueapoling> @MittRomney Thank you, sir, for putting your country over partisanship.  We need more people like you to speak out against this man and other issues.
937657190617317376 2017-12-04 12:17:49 UTC <sueapoling> @eltonofficial So very sorry for the loss of your mother.
937519973475520513 2017-12-03 03:12:34 UTC <sueapoling> @UofOklahoma #BoomerSooner
937051037671854080 2017-12-02 20:09:11 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Yeah, they fired them from the team in August.
936996099646214144 2017-12-02 16:30:53 UTC <sueapoling> @HuffPost @ashleyfeinberg @MeghanMcCain The tweet by huff post journalist was deplorable, but your dad did vote for a massive tax break for the rich and will effectively take away medical benefits from approx 13 mil people.  The hlth care he gets is provided by the people who will be hurt.
936942544117751809 2017-12-02 12:58:04 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex They are rushed to get this passed before Trump is arrested.
936941644561166336 2017-12-02 12:54:30 UTC <sueapoling> @MSNBC Turtle man is such a liar.
936940863279820800 2017-12-02 12:51:23 UTC <sueapoling> @TheMattBRoberts @Writer_DG The Print Shop sign.  How wonderful.
936822080250642432 2017-12-01 04:59:23 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @VbetNG Has a massive corporation ever made a mistake that they then had to correct?  Im thinking yes?
936817912114847745 2017-12-01 04:42:50 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Have you ever made a mistake and then had to correct?
936810327827628032 2017-12-01 04:12:41 UTC <sueapoling> @draiochta14 They are desperate to get something passed before Trump is arrested!
936755676860305408 2017-12-01 00:35:32 UTC <sueapoling> Supporting you from Oklahoma @SenFranken.
936728680855896064 2017-12-01 22:48:15 UTC <sueapoling> @AdamsFlaFan @PreetBharara The news we have been waiting for!
936304735052812291 2017-11-30 18:43:39 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Your boy is going off the deep end.
935856400428879872 2017-11-29 13:02:07 UTC <sueapoling> @WalkerMrsetw @OutlanderCostum Amazed that RM and you have brought this series to life in this way.  Wonderful job.  Do i agree with every choice that is made in the telling of it?  No, but love it and your work so much.
935855192196644866 2017-11-29 12:57:19 UTC <sueapoling> @WalkerMrsetw @OutlanderCostum Or in Claires case an actual jungle.  Never doubting your love for each other is the sexiest thing i can think of.  That i know someone will always be there for me no matter what happens.
935851163467026434 2017-11-29 12:41:19 UTC <sueapoling> @WalkerMrsetw @OutlanderCostum Mean to say that in a love story such as this it unrealistic to expect wine and roses every day.  Some days Claire just has to survive.  The love Clair and Jamie have for each other can survive anything even if its not wine and roses every day.
935850682397134849 2017-11-29 12:39:24 UTC <sueapoling> @DonCheadle Its always a mistake to try to interact with inanimate objects.
935849772401025024 2017-11-29 12:35:47 UTC <sueapoling> @WalkerMrsetw @OutlanderCostum The story of a couples love for each other and the story of their life and marriage.  That every day is wine and roses is unrealistic at best, and comical at the least is what this show describes.
935301410517897216 2017-11-27 00:16:47 UTC <sueapoling> @SenWarren Missing the entire point here @AriFleischer, this whataboutism is what is undermining our country.  Its like 2 kids tattling on each other, she hit me, but he hit me first
935127793200959489 2017-11-27 12:46:54 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum They obviously are a part, a big one, of the story.  Your costumes have become one of the big reasons i watch this show.  They have been spot on.
934842409208504321 2017-11-26 17:52:53 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Became a young widow with only few options.  Glad to know that as a woman now, my choices would be unlimited as a young widow.
934545953037737984 2017-11-25 22:14:52 UTC <sueapoling> @JohnWDean Sanders not conceding defeat until almost the convention is part of the reason we are where we are now.  I wouldnt vote for him for dog catcher.
934545293755977728 2017-11-25 22:12:15 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex What a dumb ass!  Some people are so devoid of any human decency.
934544318790062080 2017-11-25 22:08:23 UTC <sueapoling> @OU_PACS @OU_Athletics Lawton, OK Boomer!
934418781996306432 2017-11-25 13:49:32 UTC <sueapoling> @CillizzaCNN Hey!  Me too.  I turned them down though because i couldnt afford airfare to NY and they  didnt offer to pay.  #TimePersonOfTheYear
934417791175811072 2017-11-25 13:45:36 UTC <sueapoling> @foxandfriends @POTUS @KellyannePolls Except what Trump said is not subject to Hatch Act.  You, girl, are.  Orange is the new black???
934413739281076224 2017-11-25 13:29:30 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Im impressed that he still continues to blatantly lie and expects us to lap it up.  #TimeMagazine called BS on it.  If i were him, i would be embarrassed, but he has no cough so he will call them the failing Time Magazine next.
934126667462823939 2017-11-24 18:28:47 UTC <sueapoling> I cast my Heisman ballot for #BakerMayfield! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/1ite9/4zh61
933769282709843968 2017-11-23 18:48:40 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @MunroeBergdorf Why cant we get behind encouraging children to be who they really are inside.

933404364705845252 2017-11-22 18:38:37 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Are you and the Republicans saying the same about any Democrat that has been accused?  No?  Well maybe you should rethink your position.
933182060486905857 2017-11-21 03:55:15 UTC <sueapoling> @DanaDelany I had the poster on my wall when i was a kid.  It felt like he was looking into my soul and i loved him!
932776562604302337 2017-11-20 01:03:57 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Love the tweet, but one question.  What is a wazzock?   lol
932679205879414784 2017-11-20 18:37:05 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer You know Trumps intentions?  He thrives on praise and compliments.
932676860172959744 2017-11-20 18:27:46 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer I dont think President Obamas would have even commented so... the MSM would have never known
932585842455011328 2017-11-20 12:26:06 UTC <sueapoling> @Eagles @ChelseaClinton Glad to know you are sports fan, but will have to agree to disagree here, my cowboys are the best.  Just going through a dry spell right now!
932448313907011584 2017-11-19 03:19:36 UTC <sueapoling> @CNN Fire this snake oil salesman.  He is a fake, and a fraud.  He doesnt deserve the platform if all he is doing is stirring up crap that isnt true.
932436059773964295 2017-11-19 02:30:55 UTC <sueapoling> @AnnCoulter Reported.
932408416542314496 2017-11-19 00:41:04 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Realize this is sarcasm, but some wont get it and think you are an advocate.
932406245285298176 2017-11-19 00:32:26 UTC <sueapoling> @jaketapper This man was staunchly anti-gay, yet got caught having sex with a male who was a minor.  Im from Oklahoma, and people here think this is just another controversy, not anything unusual.  This is so SAD.
931898927904968705 2017-11-18 14:56:32 UTC <sueapoling> @AutismJournal Know change is difficult.  We recently moved and life is not back to normal just yet.  What ever normal is.  Lucky that holidays wont be a stressor.
931877514535997441 2017-11-18 13:31:27 UTC <sueapoling> @JoyAnnReid Saying that someone is with a black girl is racist?  While i think Jones is a pig, i guess saying someone is black is a racial comment is now a thing? Learn something new every day.  Now if he had said the n word i could understand.
931876207104331776 2017-11-18 13:26:15 UTC <sueapoling> @RevDrBarber this is the hypocrisy of our time, and @GOP will never understand that.  All  they see is their own narrow interest and not for the greater good for humanity.
931868968180178946 2017-11-18 12:57:29 UTC <sueapoling> @Franklin_Graham Shame on you Mr Graham.  Roy Moore is a pedophile.  No normal 30 year old man cruises the mall looking for teens without some type of moral deficiency.  Hat you would support that is truly disturbing to me.

931497311997480960 2017-11-17 12:20:40 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG A hot cup of coffee!  It might just work too.
931009801315913728 2017-11-15 04:03:28 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump Not right to steal, but Potus should rep everyone, even young men and women who might have made an awful mistake but did not deserve 10 yrs in prison.  No thanks should be given or asked for for Potus doing his job.
930968683907833856 2017-11-15 01:20:05 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer The left do not hate.  They want gun violence to stop.  The GOP are in bed with the NRA so dont care if it continues.
930640069370830848 2017-11-14 03:34:17 UTC <sueapoling> @RhondaRrusse @tonyschwartz Normalization of Trump and Trump like behaviors are scarring our humanity.  I think this whole country has gone crazy, and it feels like most have Stockholm syndrome.  How can they not see whats happening.
930405949629755392 2017-11-14 12:03:59 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom @JoeWalsh how can you be so dense?  This man preyed on young girls when he was a grown man in authority.  Dont you have daughters?  How would you feel if this were a Democrat?  You would be screaming at the top of your lungs, lock him up!  Sit down.
930404321174478848 2017-11-14 11:57:30 UTC <sueapoling> Why are you surprised @piersmorgan ?  This has been SOP for the Russians since before 2016 election in US.  That they are taunting the British should be no surprise.
929878773067075585 2017-11-12 01:09:10 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright And drink the Kool-aid.  But the Kool-Aid was poison and killed everyone who drank it.  Lesson here, dont let someone pysch you into something you know is wrong.

928694726601166849 2017-11-09 18:44:11 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Could say the same about your buddy Trump.  We are tired of being the laughing stock.

927736189083414528 2017-11-06 03:15:18 UTC <sueapoling> Actually @WalshFreedom those rights came directly from the government.  What planet are you on to not know this?
927729572644352000 2017-11-06 02:49:01 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG @OutlanderCostum Maybe not an alcoholic, but a few glasses of wine wouldnt hurt
927610874877173761 2017-11-06 18:57:21 UTC <sueapoling> @AdamsFlaFan This is just not right.
927499407305728001 2017-11-06 11:34:25 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan This is why Trump cant be trusted.  No sense of reality when it comes to gun violence.  In fact, he has no sense of reality about anything.
927159729201311744 2017-11-05 13:04:39 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright This is ludicrous if true.  What in the actual hell is going on?
927156020652130307 2017-11-05 12:49:55 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan It is perfectly ok to comment, just dont proposition anyone and try to cop a feel.
927155176275955714 2017-11-05 12:46:34 UTC <sueapoling> I cast my Heisman ballot for #BakerMayfield! Click the player you think deserves the @NissanUSA #HeismanHouse vote!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/16a9qt/4yvsq
926506311747063808 2017-11-03 17:48:13 UTC <sueapoling> @donnabrazile Donna you put yourself and the Dems in this position, now need to own it.
926412273547177984 2017-11-03 11:34:32 UTC <sueapoling> @ABFalecbaldwin In that order?  Hopefully this is multiple choice.
925554140905959429 2017-10-31 02:44:37 UTC <sueapoling> @kurt_loder Look, the FBI is coming.  Wonder what they want?
925419205637427200 2017-10-31 17:48:26 UTC <sueapoling> @FoxNews @smerconish And what does that tell you?
925047835782991872 2017-10-30 17:12:45 UTC <sueapoling> @BillyX101 Not context of original post,but agree that people didnt care about who he was & is.  I voted HRC.
924961262571843584 2017-10-30 11:28:44 UTC <sueapoling> @SallyAlbright Your premise is exactly how 45 got elected. Yes, elections hv consequences. Sometimes the right vote is the lesser of 2 evils. Sad but true
924613107103731712 2017-10-29 12:25:17 UTC <sueapoling> @ManMadeMoon @GucciTurtIe Love it and so accurate!
924611089282846721 2017-10-29 12:17:16 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG Acting great. Changing characters to be unrecognizable from book characters. Unsure where all this is going. Change for change sake not good
924253551471333376 2017-10-28 12:36:33 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo how can otherwise intelligent people not see through that BS
924221841459335168 2017-10-28 10:30:32 UTC <sueapoling> @TheMattBRoberts thanks for sharing the scenery from season 4.
924089623244148736 2017-10-27 01:45:09 UTC <sueapoling> .@piersmorgan predictions on who was indicted?  Trumps time will come.  But for now this will be a start.
923607159161737216 2017-10-26 17:48:01 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Best and closest to my own reactions to 306.  I love it but had to warm to it.
923285198086770688 2017-10-25 20:28:39 UTC <sueapoling> @The_UnSilent_ Why is everything about him a superlative?  The best, the most, the biggest,  etc.  He has a inferiority complex.
922426657843171328 2017-10-23 11:37:07 UTC <sueapoling> @CoryBooker Kill them with kindness and understanding Mr Booker.  You are whats right with our country.  Keep up the good work.

921893295462199296 2017-10-21 00:17:44 UTC <sueapoling> @Outlander_STARZ Have been waitin awhile for tonight.  Bring it on!
921888116620906498 2017-10-21 23:57:09 UTC <sueapoling> @erconger @SethAbramson Crooked @realDonaldTrump prob doesnt even know the implications of this,some1 nds 2 whisper in his ear.Makes him look guilty.  Oh wait...
921339279044988929 2017-10-20 11:36:16 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH While I dont think Trump meant harm, his tone deaf responses keep his foot in his mouth more often than not.  Sad.
921063870323621888 2017-10-19 17:21:53 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan While the soldier knew what they signed up for, it is insensitive to say it to the soldiers parents or wife after his death.
920814953090703361 2017-10-18 00:52:47 UTC <sueapoling> @EmpireFOX @leedanielsent Lets go crazy!
920770033881616384 2017-10-18 21:54:17 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Love your designs.  They are spot on.  Claire couldnt have a better designer for her clothes
920697946026446848 2017-10-18 17:07:50 UTC <sueapoling> @AlanDersh Then you should support NFL to kneel and not POTUS words about forcing players to stand.
920469142637031425 2017-10-17 01:58:39 UTC <sueapoling> @POTUS @PressSec I suppose better late than never, you would think he didnt know about the deaths until after media brought it up.  Oh wait...
920099003861053440 2017-10-16 01:27:51 UTC <sueapoling> @Larrylamb11E @angry_gram This is what got Trump elected. Stop being so politically correct. Just call him out for what he is, a liar. Plain and simple
919762238730248197 2017-10-15 03:09:40 UTC <sueapoling> @shannonleetweed Absence makes the heart grow fonder?  It is addicting.  Are you a book reader or only tv series?

918983334516072448 2017-10-13 23:34:35 UTC <sueapoling> @LoriGreiner Love it!
918981043880845313 2017-10-13 23:25:29 UTC <sueapoling> .@piersmorgan what are you gonna say when DJT starts illegal war with N. Korea?  He is going to taunt KJU to send fire so he wont b blamed
918979284831674369 2017-10-13 23:18:29 UTC <sueapoling> .@piersmorgan you are pathetic your own self and have no value beyond those you interview.
918978748703055872 2017-10-13 23:16:22 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH How do you know what insurance you will need? That is the def of ins. Against things that COULD happen to you.  Stripped dn plans no good.
917941939261108225 2017-10-10 02:36:27 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Trump supporters have supported him even though he has similar claims against him. He just never admitted his crimes.  Except p@&$y grabbing
917903771547717637 2017-10-10 00:04:47 UTC <sueapoling> @KellyannePolls Your boss is just as bad as HW but he was elected POTUS.  He needs fired too.
917903267618750464 2017-10-10 00:02:47 UTC <sueapoling> @terrycrews @SamChampion This type of behavior can only be disinfected by sunlight.  We must expose it just like we need to expose racism.

917349451970334720 2017-10-09 11:22:07 UTC <sueapoling> @NoNo2GOP @porpentina2017 Some more of the GOP war against women and their rights.
917348044265451520 2017-10-09 11:16:31 UTC <sueapoling> @SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump @smerconish Maybe not his intention but that is what he is doing.  Repubs better start speaking up abut trumps inadequacy or our nation is in peril
917229069846155265 2017-10-08 03:23:46 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @kellitowhiting None sir, and I respect your opinion. But if you didnt fight for our Constitutional freedoms, then why did you serve?
917137131667185666 2017-10-08 21:18:26 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan @kellitowhiting Sorry, but you are totally wrong, our flag stands for FREEDOM for all.  Something our vets fought and died for.  No disrespect to kneel.
917136516618641408 2017-10-08 21:15:59 UTC <sueapoling> I have to say @piersmorgan Im so glad you get it. This protest is about racial inequality. Sooner people see that maybe can effect change
917135280188125189 2017-10-08 21:11:05 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG @OutlanderCostum Jamie would drive a big rugged pick up truck!
917013036136910848 2017-10-08 13:05:19 UTC <sueapoling> .@TheHRH it is exactly same. Denial of Trumps actions part of problem. Do you think the women Trump assaulted let him do it?
916766910330605568 2017-10-07 20:47:18 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH the scale is actually bigger.  Weinstein hasnt been accused of rape like Trump has.
916741852799361026 2017-10-07 19:07:44 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Republicans need to look in the mirror on this one.  Lots of them with abhorrent and deviant behavior.  Never hear any of them denounced.
916739208835985409 2017-10-07 18:57:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH There were allegations that were seemingly brushed under the rug.  No outrage from the right about it either.
916710319040483329 2017-10-07 17:02:26 UTC <sueapoling> @LongIslander57 @ToriNicksWho And Trayvon Martin is dead.  Why should I care about this jokers problems?
916707056555569152 2017-10-07 16:49:28 UTC <sueapoling> @thedailybeast @TheHRH Yes, Weinsteins admission is problem.  We admit that.  Your party needs to admit Trump is cut from same cloth as Weinstein.
916670115881586688 2017-10-07 14:22:41 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Are/were you shocked that Trump bragged about grabbing women by their genitals?  I think this is a case of pot calling kettle.
916496025203957761 2017-10-06 02:50:54 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared I hate to be crass, but I think something else was being deposited in his pants

915170770778775552 2017-10-03 11:04:49 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis The biggest gator in a murky swamp is Trump.  He is slowly eating us all alive.
915170008879247362 2017-10-03 11:01:47 UTC <sueapoling> @imraansiddiqi I condem this type of rhetoric from a clergy member,who shld know better. The right will lap this crap up though,further dividing our nation
915027813341831175 2017-10-02 01:36:45 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Trump doesnt know about God, some speech writer wrote that for sound bites.  Trump cares about Trump.
915026830217875457 2017-10-02 01:32:51 UTC <sueapoling> @rabiasquared Beautiful young man.  Its stunning to think that days like this will haunt us until Yaseen is grown and beyond.
915024220140294144 2017-10-02 01:22:29 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan I agree w/you about gun laws,but you know repub cong wouldnt have pass anything he supported & if they had Trump would undo it
914816796900851718 2017-10-02 11:38:15 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum No, not in the episode.  Cool tights on Bree though.
914816242212642816 2017-10-02 11:36:03 UTC <sueapoling> @WalshFreedom @JoeWalsh false equivalence here.  Get a grip man.
914813882971119616 2017-10-02 11:26:40 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Genevas riding outfit was beautiful.  She looked a bit like Claire.  Gorgeous!
914812995628421120 2017-10-02 11:23:09 UTC <sueapoling> One time I will agree with you @piersmorgan  this was an act of domestic terrorism and should be called such.
914547176688242689 2017-10-01 17:46:53 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Or maybe too busy taking care of her people?
914296392989970432 2017-09-30 01:10:21 UTC <sueapoling> @fema @POTUS @PressSec Why is Trump insulting Americans who are in extreme need and possibly dying?  Ill bet he didnt even know they are Americans.  Sad
914263151507582976 2017-09-30 22:58:16 UTC <sueapoling> @EmpireAddicts @BarackObama More presidential than the current idiot in chief.  All he can muster is golf and insults.
914216947105124353 2017-09-30 19:54:40 UTC <sueapoling> @annawmathews Im in Ok and I for sure know who is to blame, but youre right. Most here wont know and will blame Obama for this.
914115663962214400 2017-09-30 13:12:12 UTC <sueapoling> @tperkins what does social conservative mean to you? Does it mean ethically challenged? Thats what Price is at best.  At worst a crook. Sad
914113275729768448 2017-09-30 13:02:42 UTC <sueapoling> @Lin_Manuel Trumps actions are sinful.  His words show his ignorance and bias.  How can he see suffering and not respond with humanity?
914110157633855488 2017-09-30 12:50:19 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Not bad judgement, he just got caught and now has to appear contrite.  Same with all who get caught.  Saying Im sorry wont cut it.
913728448232853504 2017-09-29 11:33:32 UTC <sueapoling> @IWF Everyone has own view, but fact is that a vote for Trump is against interest of ALL women, Dems and Republicans.  We have to face facts.
913582770810531840 2017-09-28 01:54:40 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum Sexy is in the eye of the beholder.  This is girl next door sexy.
913535755061882880 2017-09-28 22:47:51 UTC <sueapoling> @BillKristol Trump and his ilk would have to look the word ethics up in the dictionary.
913189543905554432 2017-09-27 23:52:08 UTC <sueapoling> @grahammctavish @M_another_M Leery?  Cant spell her name... lol
913004483965325312 2017-09-27 11:36:46 UTC <sueapoling> @washingtonpost While she has the right to not watch NFL, really who cares?  Her husband defended rights granted in Constitution and kneeling is one.
913001088126717952 2017-09-27 11:23:16 UTC <sueapoling> @funder Im so afraid for what this country is becoming.  Why cant some people see how wrong this is?
912278763928522752 2017-09-25 11:33:01 UTC <sueapoling> @OutlanderCostum It was beautiful!  Great work Terry.
911737082741231616 2017-09-23 23:40:34 UTC <sueapoling> @kurteichenwald You do realize this is #fakenews,right?
911697346123190276 2017-09-23 21:02:40 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer @2smokytop Citizens of the US & as such have the right per 1st amend to peacefully protest.  Who do you think you are for taking away their rights?
911693646650626048 2017-09-23 20:47:58 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Why do you think citizens/athletes should stay out of politics? They have just as many rights as you or I.  You are one politicizing this.
911597994990030848 2017-09-23 14:27:53 UTC <sueapoling> @canadeeana @franklinleonard Almost none I would think.  What I think is that there is another SOB who needs to get off the field, DJT.
911403594242510848 2017-09-22 01:35:24 UTC <sueapoling> @ABFalecbaldwin Im so sorry to say that this man is from my state. We knew it long before he became EPA chief.
911347382956314625 2017-09-22 21:52:02 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt If all healthy people bought 1 ins and all sick people bought another,who do you think pays less? No brainer.Why ind mandate is important.
911346792121462790 2017-09-22 21:49:41 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt It is a set of regulations on the health ins industry to prevent them from over charging people for an essential need of everyone
911346256752103424 2017-09-22 21:47:34 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt This is why people should have choice. But cost in ins industry is based on use of # of people in pool.  Same with health ins.
911345831021879296 2017-09-22 21:45:52 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Do you purchase car insurance? Same principle.
911345602881032193 2017-09-22 21:44:58 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt I pay property taxes on school bond issues but have no children in school.  Human life & health is paramount.  How can we not share cost.
911345221354577921 2017-09-22 21:43:27 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Well I see the problem, but a human life is a bit more important than a wrecked car. People are taxed for things they dont use all the time
911336573303746561 2017-09-22 21:09:05 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt This ind. mandate spreads the risk to the entire pool and helps lower cost.  People opting out with low med needs are the cause of problem.
911336265064304646 2017-09-22 21:07:52 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Even before Ocare, insurance rates are based on use of people in pool.  This is only controversial because of tax dollars.
911335915439710208 2017-09-22 21:06:28 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Yes, but cost sharing is a concept used in lots of industries already.  My auto ins was higher when lived in metro area. Now lower in rural
911332137646862336 2017-09-22 20:51:28 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt My health is important because I support them and if I become ill no resources to fall back on.  ACA was designed for people like me.
911331822864404480 2017-09-22 20:50:12 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt No. I have been to Dr. 1 time this year, generally healthy. Husband and daughter qualify for Medicaid. I have to purchase my own.
911307531565363202 2017-09-22 19:13:41 UTC <sueapoling> @funder Daughter&husband diabled. Me:age56 sole support of both. No employer coverage. ACA gives me low prem and cost sharing low deductible.
911304901715734528 2017-09-22 19:03:14 UTC <sueapoling> @LongIslander57 Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for being a sane voice is this crazy time.
911298733068967936 2017-09-22 18:38:43 UTC <sueapoling> @jimmykimmel @SenJohnMcCain @TheHRH Wrong!  He knows that this bill bears more scrutiny and from all appearances it is bad for his constituents. repeal ocare doesnt make it gd
911260002903642115 2017-09-22 16:04:49 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Small town, no better jobs to get emp ins.  Im older,56, so this new plan will hurt me and others like me.
911259606550290432 2017-09-22 16:03:15 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Jason_Gatt Yes, lower income means cost sharing and premium assist.  69 per month, 250 deductible. 650 total yrly out of pocket.  It works for me
911252173790613505 2017-09-22 15:33:43 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH I have ACA ins because my emp does not offer.  Disabled husband and adult child at home. Im sole supporter and need my ins thats affordable
910340755566288896 2017-09-19 03:12:04 UTC <sueapoling> @ABCWorldNews Deplorable? Yes. Racist? Yes. Idiot? Yes.

909231261176152064 2017-09-16 01:43:20 UTC <sueapoling> @chrissyteigen He forgot who she was?  Only explanation I can think of.
909038903931297794 2017-09-16 12:58:58 UTC <sueapoling> @donnabrazile Maybe because of the color of her skin?  Proving her point entirely.
908751560875810816 2017-09-15 17:57:10 UTC <sueapoling> @CNNPolitics Thought we weren't in the business of regime change.  The only one I support is the Trump regime change.
908657550937268224 2017-09-15 11:43:36 UTC <sueapoling> @TheEricRuben I work for a real estate management firm and I'm calling Tump a whit supremacist!
908023777442885632 2017-09-13 17:45:13 UTC <sueapoling> Attitudes about women in authority in US are diff than U.K. Attitudes.  @piersmorgan is wrong about this
908022917434355714 2017-09-13 17:41:48 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Lost the electoral college but she is still my President.
908020119430975490 2017-09-13 17:30:41 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan And yet it is selling millions!  Men who want her to shut up can kiss off.
907754534881169408 2017-09-12 23:55:21 UTC <sueapoling> @HISTORY @RobLowe Love Vikings.  Are you GOT fan?
907753248685248518 2017-09-12 23:50:14 UTC <sueapoling> @jaketapper What's sad is SHS pandering to the Trump "regime."  How anyone can stand on that podium & cover for him and his administration makes me sick
907629357753098241 2017-09-12 15:37:56 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG @mopage19 This is fake.  The same photo circulated of Facebook after Harvey in Houston.
907366012919664640 2017-09-11 22:11:30 UTC <sueapoling> And pray she stays on it 4 more years!https://twitter.com/disavowtrump16/status/907019700034514944
906873712061935616 2017-09-10 13:35:16 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG Loved it!  But still can't wait until the print shop.
906495777127763968 2017-09-09 12:33:29 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo @ananavarro He does look hot though!
906207072991277056 2017-09-08 17:26:17 UTC <sueapoling> @AutismJournal Sometimes autism feels like a hurricane for sure.  Please stay safe!
906113769058816000 2017-09-08 11:15:31 UTC <sueapoling> @AnandWrites @PreetBharara @duancrys This is an older photo.  Clinton and Obama have a current video in their twitter.
906113187883470848 2017-09-08 11:13:13 UTC <sueapoling> @PreetBharara So proud of all these men.  As a dem, I would be happy to have any of them back in office.  ANY of them!
905578100112715776 2017-09-06 23:46:58 UTC <sueapoling> @RebekahWorsham The real snowflakes are people like the OP who resort to name calling when asked legit questions. Why do they have to resort to name calling
905576719498792960 2017-09-06 23:41:29 UTC <sueapoling> @RebekahWorsham I support finding homes for all homeless vets, but reversing DACA will not accomplish that.  DACA is important to maintain.
905485475393220608 2017-09-06 17:38:55 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan As an Obama supporter I knew this.  Problem is people accuse him of allowing too many immigrants in the country and that is not true
905222641497366528 2017-09-05 00:14:30 UTC <sueapoling> @BuffyLWillow @ananavarro Sessions is a racist to the core along with his buddy Trump
905219476353941505 2017-09-05 00:01:55 UTC <sueapoling> @Wolfiesmom Yet they allow Trump to run rampant with anything he wants to do #RussiaGate
905122562648236033 2017-09-05 17:36:49 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Since you republicans love to say this, what about all the exec. orders Trump has signed.  Unconstitutional?  So only bad when Obama did it?
904699143838420992 2017-09-04 13:34:19 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @ACLU This is a human rights violation of the worst sort.  If we don't stand up for basic rights, who are we becoming?
904698806939373568 2017-09-04 13:32:58 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @ACLU This is horrific.  These people need to be charged and prosecuted to fullest extent.  This is not who we are.
904697640171995136 2017-09-04 13:28:20 UTC <sueapoling> @OralXpert @impeach_d_trump Ok, the typo.  But certainly we could all wish Trumps excuses were "mute"
904434939747332100 2017-09-03 20:04:27 UTC <sueapoling> @AutismJournal I strongly dislike when people say they have a cure for autism.  No cure, and if you say your child was cured then they didn't have autism.
904039737396269057 2017-09-02 17:54:04 UTC <sueapoling> @brianklaas How to fix before 2018 if those in power won't admit there was a problem.
904038976088141825 2017-09-02 17:51:02 UTC <sueapoling> .@RobLowe binge watching The West Wing and loved Sam Seaborn.  Please come back to Tv drama.  You are so good at it.
903751967939465220 2017-09-01 22:50:34 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro This is Trump supporters at their worst.  Why do people make this so personal?  Ana we support you and your brother!
903677254215110656 2017-09-01 17:53:41 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Except Trump just wants NO immigration period.  America First and all that.  He won't compromise
903399334447865856 2017-08-31 23:29:20 UTC <sueapoling> @SamChampion Can't wait to hear the news!
902708372679610368 2017-08-29 01:43:42 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex I live in Oklahoma and would just as soon not be a coastal state.  Climate change not hoax.  We must all do our part to combat it.
902586766770753536 2017-08-29 17:40:29 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Eisenhower?  Seems like I remember photos of him in one. Not that I'm old enough to have seen it myself.
902318918882263040 2017-08-28 23:56:09 UTC <sueapoling> I voted for #Jon4MVP! Or should I say Aegon... Who's the #GoTMVP? Follow @AmazonChannels to see!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fa93f/4pnyt

901936083528757248 2017-08-27 22:34:54 UTC <sueapoling> Fake photo, although I wish it were true
901886525792804864 2017-08-27 19:17:58 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump are you aware that a massive hurricane is attacking south Texas and lives are in danger from flooding?  WAKE UP&SHUT UP!
901778267396599808 2017-08-27 12:07:47 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @elongreen I've always felt this way.  Cruz and his ilk ought to be ashamed to even ask for help but then again they have no shame.
901423284146892800 2017-08-26 12:37:13 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro Agree they are calm voice amid chaos, but would be great to hear them speak out more against Trump.  Silence implies agreement.
901411849391964160 2017-08-26 11:51:46 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan Both offend me and not afraid to say so.  Trump offends me.  The man is not stable
901243925398245376 2017-08-25 00:44:30 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar Just as any other soldier could be a liability and crack under pressure.  Your thesis on this issue holds no water IMHO.
901242150289108994 2017-08-25 00:37:27 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar I believe trans people serve bravely.There are a lot of mentally ill in gen population.  These would not be allowed to serve either.
901240838373691392 2017-08-25 00:32:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar If that is true, then some would say being gay is a mental illness, but I would defend your right to be and love whomever you choose.
901234493301850114 2017-08-25 00:07:01 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar Compared Transgender to serial murderer when it comes to understanding.  I'm not trans, but implying  most are unstable is wrong.
901233550984392705 2017-08-25 00:03:17 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar Transgender not a crime.Trump is committing political suicide and will NEVER be re-elected.Then you racist/bigots will have nowhere to hide
901231711362666497 2017-08-25 23:55:58 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere @SenDuckworth @Poulsar Because of the hate and non acceptance  of them.If you were hated & ridiculed every day you might feel the same. Need support & acceptance.
901184552605016065 2017-08-25 20:48:35 UTC <sueapoling> @Writer_DG Airport?
901049799813853184 2017-08-25 11:53:07 UTC <sueapoling> @AutismJournal This is their MO.  Maybe try Old Republic home warranty.  They seem to be better IMHO.
901049276943527936 2017-08-25 11:51:02 UTC <sueapoling> @Alyssa_Milano Wonder who the snowflakes are now?  @ScottBaio seems to be pretty frosty.
901048107424784388 2017-08-25 11:46:24 UTC <sueapoling> @AutismJournal Work in real estate and I agree. AHS is the worst.  I think of them like McGiver putting things together with tin foil and chewing gum.
900872213523574785 2017-08-24 00:07:27 UTC <sueapoling> @TeeTweetsHere Thank you for your service @SenDuckworth.Discrimination of this type is the most cowardly act the president can make.Showing his true colors
900835342906994689 2017-08-24 21:40:57 UTC <sueapoling> @thehill This is wrong on so many levels.  Trump is pushing this Country back 50 years or more.  Sad!
900823809628016641 2017-08-24 20:55:07 UTC <sueapoling> @smerconish @GhastlyFew Agree.  Some people want to be violent with you because of your skin color.  What do you say about them???
900560158044155904 2017-08-23 03:27:27 UTC <sueapoling> @POTUS @seanhannity @FoxNews No creep. My president was unfairly lied about by Trump and he did not dignify that lie with a response.Trump lies just to hear himself talk
900458177766064129 2017-08-23 20:42:13 UTC <sueapoling> @BradWollack Lol!
900457714027024384 2017-08-23 20:40:23 UTC <sueapoling> @smerconish It's not the speech part, it's the violence that goes along.  Inciting violence is what is wrong with hate speech.
900456934553378816 2017-08-23 20:37:17 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Love them!  So glad you got your companion.
900319882822115328 2017-08-23 11:32:41 UTC <sueapoling> @MeghanMcCain Best wishes for your father.  He is a hero that all can respect.  This type of person who would wish harm to your father is repulsive.
900180228294795264 2017-08-22 02:17:45 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie Maybe that indicates more identify Dem over Repub. Data was collected randomly and party was ascertained after fact. But interesting.

900148187004108801 2017-08-22 00:10:26 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex Oh Alex, I'm so sorry you have to deal w/people like this. Know there are those who will always support you. Not a choice to be who you are
900147530167615490 2017-08-22 00:07:49 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie New survey/poll says 1 in 10 Americans  That's 22 mil people, think Nazi/KKK views are ok with them.  That is what is wrong with America.
900144719124148224 2017-08-22 23:56:39 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie Well I will concede that I could not be an activist, but I am Anti-Facist for sure.  I just don't understand how everyone isn't
900118950759071745 2017-08-22 22:14:15 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie And by the way, Antifa stands for Anti Facist.  Why aren't you anti fascist.  Why isn't everyone?
900118514492723205 2017-08-22 22:12:31 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie I have eyes and ears and a brain and the media does not influence me in the way that you would think. I'm a leftist but I think for myself.
900117916221403139 2017-08-22 22:10:09 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie I don't hate him.  I disagree with him and his policies.  Big difference.  But I heard what I heard and not through a filter of media.
900054476043812864 2017-08-22 17:58:03 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @kimfolksie Well it sure did not sound that way to me and others.
899778360489857024 2017-08-21 23:40:52 UTC <sueapoling> .@TheHRH he DID say that there were some gd people on both sides.If you say otherwise putting head in sand.There are no good KKK or nazis
899777494177415171 2017-08-21 23:37:26 UTC <sueapoling> His watch never ended. I voted for #Benjen4MVP! Who's the #GoTMVP this week? Follow @AmazonChannels to see!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fa93f/4ok9u
899776797449101314 2017-08-21 23:34:40 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH KKK is a group that is know for violence against POC and others.  Communist have their problems and should be denounced, but not violent.
899708275830259712 2017-08-21 19:02:23 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Could have purchased NASA approved glasses at Lowes for about 1.50
899328998995619840 2017-08-20 17:55:16 UTC <sueapoling> @SamChampion Looking good guys!
899101745275645952 2017-08-19 02:52:15 UTC <sueapoling> And twitter loves you @sturdyAlex !
897973243000303619 2017-08-16 00:07:59 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro Power corrupts absolutely.
897961499859312645 2017-08-16 23:21:19 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo @CaCooYankee1 Of Trump spewing BS? Well, for example he said that the neo-nazis in Charlottesville were not entirely to blame for the violence.
897785092071989250 2017-08-16 11:40:20 UTC <sueapoling> .@ChrisCuomo why can't people see through the BS Trump spews?  How can he still have followers!  Our country ought to be better than this.
897784288049061888 2017-08-16 11:37:08 UTC <sueapoling> First time I agree with you @piersmorgan.  Now try to get your buddy Trump to agree.
897783084732608513 2017-08-16 11:32:22 UTC <sueapoling> .@AriFleischer yet you would defend Trump who supports these people.  I don't care what he says now.  His first reaction says it all.
897423644644839427 2017-08-15 11:44:04 UTC <sueapoling> .@ChrisCuomo Trump doesn't deserve respect.  The office of POTUS does deserve respect, but TRUMP is the one that needs to respect it.
897422266295865344 2017-08-15 11:38:36 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Then think how people felt hearing Trump not denounce the group that instigated the violence.  THAT was really offensive.  Perspective!
897421647245869057 2017-08-15 11:36:08 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Might not make it so for you, but it is so for Trump/Bannon and a lot of his "followers"
897255589771968512 2017-08-14 00:36:17 UTC <sueapoling> @thehill The right politicizes tragedy and is hypocritical when they try to make the left look bad
897230962156867586 2017-08-14 22:58:25 UTC <sueapoling> He really 'swung' into action. I voted #Gendry4MVP! Who's the #GoTMVP? Follow @AmazonChannels to see the fan fave.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54fa93f/4nmw2

896810754351001604 2017-08-13 19:08:40 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan They are his supporters and even his advisors at the WH.  What ever makes you think he will denounce or condemn them?
896751528387764227 2017-08-13 15:13:19 UTC <sueapoling> @SenTedCruz Can't believe I'm retweeting Ted Cruz, but his response is on point and stronger than Trump
896720880037838849 2017-08-13 13:11:32 UTC <sueapoling> @keithellison Americans must denounce the type of groups responsible for the violence and racism in #Charlottesviille. We in America do not stand for this
896500325540126722 2017-08-12 22:35:08 UTC <sueapoling> @POTUS .@marcorubio maybe U should listen to what he said, and did not say.  Places blame on both sides.
896410943802019840 2017-08-12 16:39:58 UTC <sueapoling> @SamChampion These people use God as a front for their views, but true believers would never allow this type of hate to enter their heart.  God is love.
895973235531149312 2017-08-11 11:40:40 UTC <sueapoling> POTUS has no idea what damage he is doing to our country, but then again maybe he does.  I'm Supporting our diplomats worldwide.https://twitter.com/ambassadorrice/status/895789260929773568

893071852674985984 2017-08-03 11:31:36 UTC <sueapoling> This speech made me cry. The hope that this man gave us is fading.  We are losing our hope in the face of our current administration.https://twitter.com/funder/status/892906032049123328
892710766092091392 2017-08-02 11:36:47 UTC <sueapoling> @chelseahandler The weight of the free world.  Except he is not mentally fit to carry that load.  Lack of moral character is making him weak.

867519105812877312 2017-05-24 23:14:07 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @philipshirley48 I understood it just fine.  But I certainly did not agree with it.
867211971766222849 2017-05-23 02:53:40 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH 45 doesn't even know Israel in Middle East.  He can't broker this deal.  Doesn't understand the players.
867211458614095872 2017-05-23 02:51:38 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @TheHRH @johnrobertsFox @lflwriter @AlApplegreen Sad truth is, that there is room on both sides for change. R's need to start facing real facts about 45 but D's need to start hearing R's
867210564849872896 2017-05-23 02:48:05 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH I have more respect for "little Marco" than I do lying Trump.  I'm a dem and I would have voted for any republican (except Cruz)before Trump
866459682038325253 2017-05-21 01:04:20 UTC <sueapoling> How many children have you adopted?  Do you support federal aid to support these children with food and housing& education?https://twitter.com/colonel_ice84/status/866449261629759488
866456069442285570 2017-05-21 00:49:59 UTC <sueapoling> @ABFalecbaldwin Thanks for the laughs that are truly needed at this time in our country.  You were brilliant.
866447273454075904 2017-05-21 00:15:02 UTC <sueapoling> Could be there is evidence.  We won't know until investigation complete.https://twitter.com/mattahay/status/866444783270678528
866072094823653381 2017-05-20 23:24:12 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Maybe he didn't take notes about conversations with some of these others because not under investigation? Bet there are memos about Clinton?
866025704399523840 2017-05-20 20:19:52 UTC <sueapoling> .@piersmorgan economy, jobs not on him,still holdover from Obama.  Gorsuch was a stolen SCOTUS pick from Obama.  What has he done really?https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/865993793362964480

865274718064128000 2017-05-18 18:35:43 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH This not even shared within our own govt.  Russia not exactly ally.  And, not our intel to share. Given to us from others.
865274208112267265 2017-05-18 18:33:41 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Collection of evidence in any potential crime  is what FBI & other "police" do.  Follow where ever evidence leads. No presumption.
865190483835969537 2017-05-18 13:01:00 UTC <sueapoling> @jaketapper @TheHRH Russian ties to Iran make this sharing dangerous.  Why do you defend?
865190286959546368 2017-05-18 13:00:13 UTC <sueapoling> @jaketapper @TheHRH No, just incredulous that WH would ask secrecy then blurt it out to Russians.
865176807368216577 2017-05-18 12:06:39 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer They take their lead from the boss.  There is no team only the boss and underlings.
865175667184476162 2017-05-18 12:02:07 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Why the heck should he resign due to POTUS impropriety?  Building a case against POTUS is his job.

864833227919429633 2017-05-17 13:21:24 UTC <sueapoling> @realDonaldTrump @CNN @dallaszayne1 Hopefully no.  Current situation with 45 makes that improbable.
864832122682576899 2017-05-17 13:17:00 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Building a bigger case perhaps?

864080862224297985 2017-05-15 11:31:46 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @crtune @MicheleMHawkins Are you not in any way concerned that Trump or team might have colluded with Russia?  Even the possibility gives me chills.

863764268453437442 2017-05-14 14:33:44 UTC <sueapoling> @AriFleischer Not true, lots care who oversees Trump/Russia investigation.Comey disliked by both parties, seems best choice to head impartial investigaton
863729454060904449 2017-05-14 12:15:23 UTC <sueapoling> @CNNPolitics Equivalent to saying "I'm not a crook"
863727008437678080 2017-05-14 12:05:40 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Not frothing as has been suggested, but have any if U Trump supporters considered that Trump/Russia might actually be true.  What if it is??
863549420364804097 2017-05-13 00:20:00 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @crtune Realize investigation will continue, but 45 hoped firing Comey would put stop to investigation.  That backfired on him bigly.
863221010048458752 2017-05-12 02:35:01 UTC <sueapoling> @PreetBharara And not at all normal.
863220613313384449 2017-05-12 02:33:26 UTC <sueapoling> And you know this how?  I suppose you heard 45 say it so it must be true. I'm not the only one comparing this to Nixon.
862851882850676736 2017-05-11 02:08:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Realize that, but it was his intention to help end investigation by firing Comey. SHS confirmed that in press briefing today.
862819528299991040 2017-05-11 23:59:40 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH If you're insinuating that Trump was mad about how he treated HRC you are on drugs.  Trump is trying to save his own skin
862819001168166913 2017-05-11 23:57:34 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH Clinton did not fire Sessions to squash an investigation.But,that is what Trump has done.History is repeating itself but Nixon's not Clinton

862133266194862081 2017-05-09 02:32:42 UTC <sueapoling> @JonathanLanday @existentialfish Make their current argument why firing Comey null.  This firing is all to end Russian investigation.

862131612707848192 2017-05-09 02:26:08 UTC <sueapoling> @FckTrmp1 @PreetBharara Why can Trump not see that this was his worst possible move and one that might ultimately be the beginning of the end for him?
862129812672000000 2017-05-09 02:18:59 UTC <sueapoling> @carlyresists @TrueFactsStated And potentially dangerous for HRC if 45 nominates someone who wants to prosecute her.  The alternative may well be worse.
862126224973475840 2017-05-09 02:04:44 UTC <sueapoling> @ABFalecbaldwin While he screwed Clinton, he was on to Trump/Russia collision and that's why he was fired.

852345223623692289 2017-04-12 02:18:31 UTC <sueapoling> @bendreyfuss Love the analogy.  Very apt.
851765650678841344 2017-04-11 11:55:30 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo Airline should have not condoned this.  Paying customer over employee?  I see lawsuit written all over this and talk about bad publicity?
851573359733334017 2017-04-10 23:11:25 UTC <sueapoling> @ananavarro Meaningless strike. Trump warned Putin in advance who then warned Assad.  The was orchestrated for a reason.
850902327137587201 2017-04-08 02:44:58 UTC <sueapoling> This man is ridiculous!  Who wears this shit to a war zone?https://twitter.com/louisemensch/status/850710927649501184
849807931088437248 2017-04-05 02:16:14 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan You should judge him on being a lying hypocrite.
849806369607876608 2017-04-05 02:10:01 UTC <sueapoling> So sorry to hear this.  Hope Britt is ok.  Know how heartbreaking this is for all concerned.https://twitter.com/autismjournal/status/849765257199398912
849590699116965888 2017-04-05 11:53:01 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisJZullo This man is the biggest hypocrite of all!
849423536578060289 2017-04-04 00:48:47 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan not our "fearless leader" Trump can't save himself much less these poor poor children.
847770114695069696 2017-03-31 11:18:40 UTC <sueapoling> This has to stop.  What can we do? I'm crying because this makes me so sad.https://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/847647440828219394
847139331101933574 2017-03-29 17:32:10 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan yes there are. But we are not tolerant of Bullsh**ters.
846908732592340996 2017-03-28 02:15:51 UTC <sueapoling> @MaxineWaters we stand in solidarity with you against those who would malign you.
846826188106600448 2017-03-28 20:47:51 UTC <sueapoling> @Reuters what are the potential legal ramifications of this action?  At very least ouster from committee.  At worst ethics violation.
846685211266076673 2017-03-28 11:27:39 UTC <sueapoling> I call photoshop BS.  Ha Ha!https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/846643212081094657
846120876252782594 2017-03-26 22:05:11 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisJZullo hypocrites of the very worst sort.
845786813088370689 2017-03-25 23:57:44 UTC <sueapoling> @smerconish @DianeKinyon good point, but better point is that when one goes to ER w/out ins. We all pay for that.  Everyone should have ins.
845768018919612418 2017-03-25 22:43:03 UTC <sueapoling> @seanspicer oh how the tides have turned.  Oh wait, the Prez is still golfing and you are still working.  Must be nice to be POTUS.
843220694666219522 2017-03-18 22:00:54 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan if they were both former presidents of the United States it would be alright with me..
843105246809395200 2017-03-18 14:22:09 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH only because people like you spread this untruth.  SS funds were used to finance other gov programs.  Gov needs to pay us back.
842811321875861506 2017-03-17 18:54:12 UTC <sueapoling> @ManMadeMoon love the analogy of the "lost sock"
842432308728725506 2017-03-16 17:48:08 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan he's just like your boy Trump.  Trump is just as much a nut job.
842340493988118528 2017-03-16 11:43:18 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan a suit?  So???

841815037773783041 2017-03-14 00:55:19 UTC <sueapoling> @SnoopDogg @piersmorgan @sheerfinish1 it was satire.  Get over it.
841608222297468928 2017-03-14 11:13:31 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo they all just see his pretty boy face and smile. Think he is good guy then vote for his smirking face,against own interest
841445639816900611 2017-03-13 00:27:28 UTC <sueapoling> @charlesornstein I told my story, but a positive one for my good experience with the ACA.  Hope enough positive stories come out here.
841051459559010305 2017-03-12 22:21:08 UTC <sueapoling> @BetteMidler they would say because they aren't crooked like Hillary but really because Putin loves Trump.
840952934758273024 2017-03-12 15:49:38 UTC <sueapoling> @Fahrenthold read and feel bad for them, but they do deserve what they get.  I'll suffer for their uninformed choice.
840774552091262976 2017-03-11 04:00:48 UTC <sueapoling> @IorettaIynch yes!
840755645032853504 2017-03-11 02:45:40 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex under the couch? Need to find it quick.  Very instructional reading. Real page turner.
840745296883777536 2017-03-11 02:04:33 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH "Ryan"plan will cause me to lose ins.Current plan works.Most people I know have ACA plans that work.Fix current probs not add more.
840416299905871873 2017-03-10 04:17:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH if cost of care is reduced, cost of insurance should decline, more people can have coverage.  But, insurers lose money. Never happen
840034315580911617 2017-03-09 02:59:22 UTC <sueapoling> @TeamConnieBritt he can do it.  He'll be stronger for it.

839458754903031809 2017-03-08 12:52:18 UTC <sueapoling> @FDRLST @AriFleischer not same context.  Saying we have common goal no matter how ancestors got here is not the same.
838902149421617152 2017-03-06 00:00:33 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo no one with any sanity will ever believe this man.  #sad
838556406190071809 2017-03-05 01:06:41 UTC <sueapoling> Trump deserves everything that might happen to him and then some.  Maybe he needs psychiatric help?https://twitter.com/chriscuomo/status/838524058186711040

837008494427586570 2017-03-01 18:35:50 UTC <sueapoling> You know if you disagree, there is no need for vulgarity.  You are part of the problem, try not hating. I know it will be hard for you. https://twitter.com/libhater2/status/836040646188236801

832416011722878976 2017-02-16 02:26:57 UTC <sueapoling> @SenatorCollins thanks for trying to protect our environment.  Won't help to not confirm, but nice try.
832366805754720256 2017-02-16 23:11:25 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan stop kissing up you apprentice.  You are losing credibility if you ever had any.
832068166121578496 2017-02-15 03:24:44 UTC <sueapoling> @JimKilbane these guys are from my state & they have nothing to fear here. This red state always believes Repubs & vote against own interest
832063104401944576 2017-02-15 03:04:37 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH hypocritical of Repubs not to be investigating this with same vigor they investigated Hillary. Will never happen though.
831715969923969025 2017-02-14 04:05:14 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH intercepted in routine listening in on Russian operatives.  Didn't deliberately tap Flynn.  Not same as tapping reg citizen.

831225944622952448 2017-02-13 19:38:03 UTC <sueapoling> @piersmorgan no one knew at that point that Russia was colluding with Trump to help elect him.  If elec today would he be re-elected? NO!
831223964747886592 2017-02-13 19:30:11 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex ha ha ha!  Very witty!
830984264133001218 2017-02-12 03:37:42 UTC <sueapoling> @ChelseaClinton great question and one for congressional oversight committee.

829859770375032832 2017-02-09 01:09:21 UTC <sueapoling> @bendreyfuss my cousin Vinny could have beaten Trumps order it was so wrong.

829305556993245184 2017-02-08 12:27:07 UTC <sueapoling> @POTUS @SenateMajLdr well you obstructed Obama and bragged about it, so good luck with your agenda now.
829304357132914688 2017-02-08 12:22:21 UTC <sueapoling> @sturdyAlex sometimes it feels this was to me too.  Things in US seem hopeless sometimes but must maintain resistance against hate.

828118519590035456 2017-02-04 05:50:15 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @jasonm95008 must not be very good chess player then. Hiring Wall Street to protect us little guys from Wall Street.  Smooth move.
828115688275443713 2017-02-04 05:39:00 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @jasonm95008 do you think what he is doing is draining the swamp? You haven't been paying attention. Adding bigger  gators is all.
828114849779572737 2017-02-04 05:35:40 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH nah, he's not that smart.  It's just that you think he has a grand plan, but there isn't one.  It's all showmanship. Sad.
828111832913154048 2017-02-04 05:23:41 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH never a deep thought, just "do" no matter or thought of the consequences.
828111541534867456 2017-02-04 05:22:31 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH this is my biggest fear about Trump.   Unpredictable , off the cuff, first thing that pops in his head, fly by the seat of pants guy
828110901538652160 2017-02-04 05:19:59 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @mychoice4christ well maybe wrong choice of words, but being more presidential should be the goal.  Not be like a petulant child.
828105970526060544 2017-02-04 05:00:23 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH as I am sure you know, 2 wrongs do not make right.  He needs to rise above criticism and begin to act the part.
828077522885681152 2017-02-04 03:07:21 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @laurasiple I'm not sure what you mean by that.
828035228325310466 2017-02-04 00:19:17 UTC <sueapoling> @ChrisCuomo understand your need to try to explain things but they will never get it.  Not until Trump comes for them.
828034685754339328 2017-02-04 00:17:07 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @MTCnsrvtive I'm not delegitimizing him at all.  He is doing that to himself.
828034247139131394 2017-02-04 00:15:23 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @maybeMAGA got that, but still your point is mine too.  Deliberate misunderstanding on your and her parts.
828033265466560512 2017-02-04 00:11:29 UTC <sueapoling> @nytimes @TheHRH @c_cgottlieb @laurasiple Trump borders on insanity and that is the truth I see.
828032972712472577 2017-02-04 00:10:19 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @laurasiple Prez Obama was sued multiple times, never called a judge "so called judge"
828032720047575040 2017-02-04 00:09:19 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @Belindahenry18 didn't call him "so called judge" Gorsuch.  Called to question his rulings.  Not the same.
828024996836601856 2017-02-04 23:38:37 UTC <sueapoling> @nytimes @TheHRH @c_cgottlieb you either.

828024740367433729 2017-02-04 23:37:36 UTC <sueapoling> @nytimes @TheHRH @c_cgottlieb ok to strongly disagree with courts orders or to denounce them publicly. But wrong to personally delegitimize
828024269095452674 2017-02-04 23:35:44 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH do you think he should have done it?
828024111393755137 2017-02-04 23:35:06 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH @c_cgottlieb didn't call them the "so called Supreme Court"
828023598833090562 2017-02-04 23:33:04 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH yes but they were not the President of the United States who should have more dignity and confidence in his orders.
828023256380821505 2017-02-04 23:31:42 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH no it has to be a minority religion for he country of origin.  Read again.
828021517694955520 2017-02-04 23:24:48 UTC <sueapoling> .@TheHRH sec 5 exempts minority religions in any of the Muslim majority countries. It denies Muslims but gives priority to Christians.https://twitter.com/thehrh/status/827995357825101827
828015472163581953 2017-02-04 23:00:47 UTC <sueapoling> @TheHRH not right to delegitimize a judge because you disagree.  If that were fair, we could say Trump not legit because we disagree.

816148258485633024 2017-01-02 05:04:42 UTC <sueapoling> I'm sure you never made a mistake as an 18 year old that would haunt you your entire life.  Never overreacted before.
816146877729140737 2017-01-02 04:59:13 UTC <sueapoling> not true.  Am fan, but in support of what is right.  No person has right to assault another man or woman. Ever.
816146459015938048 2017-01-02 04:57:33 UTC <sueapoling> a man has punched me, that's why I have right to speak here. You ever hit a man?
816145966126473216 2017-01-02 04:55:36 UTC <sueapoling> U missing point.  Women don't get a pass simply for being female.
816145793413480448 2017-01-02 04:54:55 UTC <sueapoling> I am a woman and agree, but NO woman should ever hit a man either.  How about sexist much?

816145304500178944 2017-01-02 04:52:58 UTC <sueapoling> I thought what was she doing slapping and pushing him.  Sorry for her but she set herself up.
816144970927239169 2017-01-02 04:51:38 UTC <sueapoling> if my daughter acts in way she did, i would understand. No woman should act in such a way to have this happen to her.

816144205668089856 2017-01-02 04:48:36 UTC <sueapoling> being female does not give freedom to assault without consequences
816143843389214721 2017-01-02 04:47:10 UTC <sueapoling> No, she assaulted 1st.  She couldn't hit as hard as him but doesn't give her the right to hit with no consequences.https://twitter.com/kodair0211/status/816143456548618240
816143477599834113 2017-01-02 04:45:42 UTC <sueapoling> to hit a person is assault.  Because she is female she gets a pass on assault? Could be argued that he was defending himself
816143205158846465 2017-01-02 04:44:37 UTC <sueapoling> if not at OU where?  Young kid makes stupid mistake that he did not instigate, girl gets no blame even tho she hit him first.
816134608278482944 2017-01-02 04:10:28 UTC <sueapoling> as a woman, I have to disagree.  He made wrong choice but was provoked.  Why do women think they can assault and get away.
