971650599640076288 2018-03-07 07:35:30 UTC <kelheath> @krassenstein There are too many reasons not to arm teachers. Everyone I know brings up a new, very valid point. Mine is: An armed teacher, if effective, will be REACTING to a shooting IN PROGRESS. Not preventing one. Is that our objective?
971647622791475200 2018-03-07 07:23:40 UTC <kelheath> @EdKrassen I don't work anymore but I never complained about my income taxes when I did. Property taxes were on the higher side but garbage collection in Rahway, NJ--they take it all and that's hard to find elsewhere.

950066624551424000 2018-01-07 18:08:29 UTC <kelheath> @realDonaldTrump @ClareMontSexton And stressed. The toll it's taking on the well-being of US citizens is pretty gross.
950066050716061696 2018-01-07 18:06:12 UTC <kelheath> @SenFranken @SarahLerner @cmcorm @IAmBoldLove I agree with you but is "TOUCHING IT OUT" a Freudian Typo? :)

949727668202823682 2018-01-06 19:41:35 UTC <kelheath> @johniadarola @BattMoyle Every now and again, yeah. But do you still have the shit that cracks you up for a brief moment and then you lose your breath and say, "Oh, shit..."?? Those were scarier times. Did happen to me about a month ago, though. Brought a lot of stuff back...

949429420414132231 2018-01-05 23:56:28 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer @Streganonna77 Funny. I lived in Linden in 1986-87. My brother lives in Avenel (WBG) now and I had cousins in Lakewood (then Jackson) growing up. Small world. :) I had friends from Floral Park. He: heavy accent "From Queens". She: no accent "From Long Island"

949384760035631104 2018-01-05 20:59:00 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer @Streganonna77 Oh. BTW--grew up in Rahway, NJ...so not far from ya!
949384631295594498 2018-01-05 20:58:29 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer @Streganonna77 Ha! Maybe! I can't tell the difference between the accents! I am in Honesdale PA right now and insulted a Queens native by asking her if she was from Bayonne or SI. I still contend she did not sound Queens.
949384136149659649 2018-01-05 20:56:31 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer @Streganonna77 I never met any until I was older...one. ;-) We're actually Irish, though, as I understand it. County Cork. Oh, well. You still have my dad's name. He would have been 82 on the 12th. Raise a glass, if you partake! :)

949359638859931655 2018-01-05 19:19:10 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer @Vanatestas I contend that they would fall into the very deep hole that has been excavated in order to properly position said bar.

946168585348702208 2017-12-27 23:59:04 UTC <kelheath> Someone should just tell 45 he DID repeal the ACA, slap his name on what it is now and I'm cool with that. I think @BarackObama would be, too. #TYTLIVE
946163684388343809 2017-12-27 23:39:35 UTC <kelheath> #tytlive I agree! Left-wing propaganda, even if it's "spin" is so much MORE offensive to me than RW Propaganda. I would like to know where I can find sources that do not serve my confirmation bias that aren't laughable.
945888551048278017 2017-12-26 05:26:18 UTC <kelheath> @Rschooley I also like how he just kinda shouts out #Jobs !! after he says he's going to be "working very hard." What a fucking joke.
945837550110945281 2017-12-26 02:03:39 UTC <kelheath> @TheYoungTurks @realjonconnor Merry Christmas, too! And Happy Boxing Day! (Am I allowed to say that?) #WaronBoxingDay

945530716133175296 2017-12-25 05:44:24 UTC <kelheath> @NoFascistsPls Jessica deserves to voice her grievances in whatever manner she chooses and I think it makes much more sense to seek to understand her rather than condemn her while defending Sen @CoryBooker (who I like). Blindly defending our leaders is dangerous. Sorry.

944962637225512960 2017-12-24 16:07:03 UTC <kelheath> @krassenstein Maybe it is pleasantly surprising to #Cult45. He doesn't surprise me anymore. My fellow Americans surprise me with their lack of outrage. Happy Holidays, anyway.
944962029684772864 2017-12-24 16:04:39 UTC <kelheath> @davekoller @cenkuygur @justicedems @tianyuli42 @Manfeelings90 You do realize that you're being incredibly condescending, right? Or should I say, "How condescending can you possibly be? How can you expect to change anyone's mind when YOU act like this?" Persuasion begins with constructive discourse. Clearly, we won't be having that.
944793197783519232 2017-12-23 04:53:46 UTC <kelheath> @rob_sheridan @shannonrwatts @HBServetus @1stgenPatriot @Magialuna @SalonOgraphy U did it right! I wanted to homeschool but then a family of homeschooled kids moved to the neighborhood. The mother was a moron, taught "alternative" facts and insisted my son was wrong when he told her Ben Franklin was never pres. I changed my mind. Might not have had I known U!
944790702604652544 2017-12-23 04:43:51 UTC <kelheath> @justicedems @TopherReisner I was really upset that JD demanded @SenFranken's resignation along with the establishment leadership. This really blew it for me. If @cenkuygur continues Rebel Headquarters and his promotion, will do what I can to support (it ain't much) but don't really want to deal w/JD at all
944789434138025984 2017-12-23 04:38:49 UTC <kelheath> @KyleKulinski @justicedems @cenkuygur @TenCraftsmen Do you know if we will still have Rebel Headquarters?
944788551367102464 2017-12-23 04:35:18 UTC <kelheath> @drvox @abouthalfthree It hasn't come up. I might have mentioned the change when he was diagnosed. I plan on it, though. I figured it would be parenting advice when the time comes. This isn't something that has torn us apart or some kind of deep family secret. I regret it and I feel guilty.
944699025688879104 2017-12-23 22:39:34 UTC <kelheath> Hey, Jim McDermott! @Mark_DMcKinney is my secret favorite! OXOhttps://twitter.com/NBCSuperstore/status/944671498379210752
944698333838311424 2017-12-23 22:36:49 UTC <kelheath> @CyrusMMcQueen I can't be shocked at that. I am shocked that people excuse this shit. I expect it from him but I expect better from American citizens. I don't even understand how my worldview differs so drastically from so many. That's what shocks me.
944661945919131648 2017-12-23 20:12:13 UTC <kelheath> @davekoller @cenkuygur @justicedems @tianyuli42 @Manfeelings90 Then I am a toxic progressive, I guess. Money out of politics...I guess that's pretty extreme...
944660956487004160 2017-12-23 20:08:17 UTC <kelheath> @drvox @CertainImp Awww....but he's so much stronger for it and could probably kick your ass. Season's Greetings. :D I actually think you're funny...are you trying to be?

944455190438084608 2017-12-22 06:30:39 UTC <kelheath> @RealRonHoward I don't understand how being anti-45 somehow makes me Pro-43. I didn't vote for 43 and was pretty pissed off that he did what he did. He was still good at presidenting!
944447915317170178 2017-12-22 06:01:44 UTC <kelheath> People. Pay attention. Don't let him get away with this shit.https://twitter.com/BenMank77/status/944432464105107456

944441360228274176 2017-12-22 05:35:41 UTC <kelheath> @drvox I said I wouldn't. I was told it was needed. I did. Until he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 8. It is the thing I regret the most (I don't know other parental regrets) in parenting my now 27-year-old son-who seems fine. It's not necessary & I wish I had it to do over again.
944402734622666753 2017-12-22 03:02:12 UTC <kelheath> @justicedems @tianyuli42 The like is for your Twitter Handle. I don't agree with JD ousting @cenkuygur and @davekoller--TYT is a strong platform and Cenk's voice is to their benefit. But cool handle! ;-)

940814301513814016 2017-12-12 05:23:03 UTC <kelheath> Daniel Shaver's killer was NOT shouting orders at him. That was Sgt. Charles Langley, the man in charge. Now retired. Changes my opinion a little.

It's one thing to pray for a win, it's another to tell people that a win (for Moore and everyone else tbh) is "God's will." Also any "Praying for Roy Moore." Unless it's 4 his soul-#blasphemy

939001525061402624 2017-12-07 05:19:44 UTC <kelheath> @cmclymer Right. Because when you see a name trending it's usually that the person has died or sexually assaulted someone these days...

938803614549766146 2017-12-07 16:13:18 UTC <kelheath> @johniadarola Thank you. LOTS of SHIT IS happening. If we don't know about it, it's not because we're distracted...it'd be because someone rendered it unimportant without our input.
938674749831606272 2017-12-06 07:41:14 UTC <kelheath> @krassenstein AND The Obamas NEED a reality show...one in which they use the catchphrase, "You're hired!" It should feature @JoeBiden and follow a Dramedy genre. It should appeal to everyone. High ratings for this show might end 45.

938486604641001472 2017-12-06 19:13:37 UTC <kelheath> Thanking Jesus for #RoyMooreChildMolestor is blasphemous. And this is coming from an agnostic. Standing behind religion is supporting him is pretty cult-like, too. God is not on your side, here, folks. I promise.

938269863142969345 2017-12-05 04:52:22 UTC <kelheath> He was warned against it. NettyHandYou probably told him how Obama hated the idea OR Obama tried it and was unsuccessful.

928409441392873473 2017-11-08 23:50:34 UTC <kelheath> @Mathemagicianme No way I think he's reading. He is being read to and then repeating it.   S-L-O-W-L-Y.

899801954184048645 2017-08-21 01:14:38 UTC <kelheath> I was 7 for Young Frankenstein and I think 9 for The Holy Grail. Always loved them both. Was already a Python fan by then. :-)

889986185178886144 2017-07-25 23:10:16 UTC <kelheath> @ThatSpanishLady I don't think we must draw a line between insane and sane-he is lacks suff. mental facility. He has mental problems-maybe some medication.

872654578956857344 2017-06-07 03:20:39 UTC <kelheath> @JoyAnnReid @JordanChariton FYI I just watched a @PhillyD vid in which he reports being called Trump loving conservative. Do I detect a pattern? TYT "Right Wing"...?

872292779841527808 2017-06-06 03:22:59 UTC <kelheath> @neeratanden @effdot @AlGiordano @bubblegenius The point is that it seems that ALL his supporters are painted as such. I supported him and I am a 50YO F & not an outlier. Assholes exist.

871537477806428160 2017-06-04 01:21:41 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson @ifartedblood authentic reporting. Differences R good. Anyway, Jayar is saying he's part of a diverse network that won't always see eye to eye.
871536634914906112 2017-06-04 01:18:20 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson @ifartedblood There is a lot of backlash. He is saying he doesn't have to agree with MT or support him. POV=points of view. A lot of them makes for more
871536214641397760 2017-06-04 01:16:40 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson @ifartedblood Mike Tracy had an experience with Maxine Waters that is being blown out of proportion. Jayar sees it, I think, from my point of view. (next)
871496126871896065 2017-06-04 22:37:22 UTC <kelheath> @justin_1522 Yup. I come here though, and see the vitriol the Dems have 4 me (50 y/o female "Bernie Bro") and my heart sinks. Same shit I get from GOPers
871491967661862918 2017-06-04 22:20:51 UTC <kelheath> @justin_1522 I understand. I love BO, but he is "corporate," which is what they want to fight. I have learned a lot from them.
871488543482417153 2017-06-04 22:07:14 UTC <kelheath> @kylegriffin1 Where has it gone? I can't see any tweets from him today. Me or are they being deleted?
871484282560270338 2017-06-04 21:50:19 UTC <kelheath> The thought is pretty hilarious. This is the reason why I kind of really hate Dems, too.https://twitter.com/justin_1522/status/871450460745609216
871483642605969409 2017-06-04 21:47:46 UTC <kelheath> @deanofcomedy @JoyAnnReid He wasn't. He works for a progressive organization. THEY are getting loads of backlash for this, thankfully. He is no fan of Sanders.
871480897501003776 2017-06-04 21:36:51 UTC <kelheath> @JoyAnnReid @mtracey @JeremyFassler89 @JonBanquer Yeah, this is the attitude that bugs me. This and Russia. I can accept Russia may be hyped, but don't insist we're all stupid 4 our concern.
871474999919607808 2017-06-04 21:13:25 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson @TheBenPeck I love analogies.
871474072252805120 2017-06-04 21:09:44 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson Haven't taken a shine to "one" reporter but thought the varied POV was very important. No such thing as bad press? Hang in there.
871473829901676546 2017-06-04 21:08:46 UTC <kelheath> @JayarJackson @ifartedblood Makes sense.
871473090592722945 2017-06-04 21:05:50 UTC <kelheath> @MaxineWaters @JoyAnnReid @Suavebones Are you familiar with them?  Just curious.
871438685904011264 2017-06-04 18:49:07 UTC <kelheath> @suddeneternity I'm not arguing with you. Seems to me that focus isn't on the statements, just her physical contact. Her comments bothered me more.
871436168717639680 2017-06-04 18:39:07 UTC <kelheath> @suddeneternity Is he reporting on her words, though?

843870930116001792 2017-03-20 17:04:42 UTC <kelheath> @POTUS @rarmenta_ @geraldino_angel @debbzi Seemingly, American citizens are in support of espionage and think the rest of us should be, too.

843668214315991040 2017-03-19 03:39:11 UTC <kelheath> @KeithOlbermann $$ For the manufacturers of drug tests. This is bullshit. People CAN get drunk more easily than they can get high on drugs.

830656306302316544 2017-02-11 05:54:30 UTC <kelheath> @3hairymutts @Phibear94 There are diseases and conditions that are not detected until after 20 wks. Hard choice-not yours.
830655851669106689 2017-02-11 05:52:42 UTC <kelheath> @3hairymutts @InGod_Almighty Yes. I do. Ever heard of Tay Sachs? Turner's syndrome? Acephaly? Google?

830653883412254720 2017-02-11 05:44:53 UTC <kelheath> Well, there is a condition known as Turner's Syndrome. Google it. B4 you tell me about spontaneous abortion, it can survive past 20wks. https://twitter.com/Wright1Dan/status/828746561475723265
830653010728587265 2017-02-11 05:41:25 UTC <kelheath> @themanfronUNCLE Do you have a clue as to why termination of pregnancy post 20wks would be necessary?
