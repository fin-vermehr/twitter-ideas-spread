971171861080965120 2018-03-06 23:53:09 UTC <ElvieDoll> @WNCN .@DuaneHallNC I am not a far-left fringe element, and be very clear that your response to these allegations, regardless of their merit, just cost you my vote in Mays primary. Failing to take them seriously, saying theyre a far-left smear - unacceptable.
971166766964641797 2018-03-06 23:32:55 UTC <ElvieDoll> This was literally my thought when I heard. Support for neo-Nazis can be swallowed, but tariffs are a bridge too far??https://twitter.com/ananavarro/status/971153410052575233

I just wonder whether its always been everywhere, or whether its due to a decline in the teaching of critical thinking, as that doesnt help standardized test scores...

966716693555896320 2018-02-22 16:49:55 UTC <ElvieDoll> @ananavarro I wish I was still in school just so I could participate in these walk-outs. I am thrilled to support my daughter as she does so.

965223723639898112 2018-02-18 13:57:23 UTC <ElvieDoll> @WRALAimee Somehow I have a hard time regarding 60 degrees (or 80 on Fri!!!) as an improvement in February, no matter how much more pleasant it may feel.

962189897921687552 2018-02-09 05:02:02 UTC <ElvieDoll> @Books_Lil_Loves I probably would have had hysterics and quit on the spot. 
962188697490939905 2018-02-09 04:57:16 UTC <ElvieDoll> @Books_Lil_Loves As a former server who handled takeout orders, I would respectfully disagree with whoever said they should be tipped 15%. Effort and time invested are in no way comparable to the service a seated table gets. But a little acknowledgement with $1-$3 is not amiss.
962185959180783616 2018-02-09 04:46:23 UTC <ElvieDoll> @Books_Lil_Loves Yes, a nominal tip of a dollar or two. They didnt spend an hour looking after me, but handling my take-out order did require accurate and hopefully prompt service, and took time they could have been devoting to seated (tipping) tables. Rule of thumb; tip everybody.

831010543221735424 2017-02-12 05:22:07 UTC <ElvieDoll> @resisterhood Given the electoral math, that fact is a problem. Dems can't win on POC vote alone.
