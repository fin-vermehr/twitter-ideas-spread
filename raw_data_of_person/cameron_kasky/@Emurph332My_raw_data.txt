971400897136906240 2018-03-07 15:03:16 UTC <Emurph332My> @samstein No, please tell me your joking!!! Of course your prob not. When will this nightmare of a potus go back to New York like the rest of his clan!
971400068187262978 2018-03-07 14:59:58 UTC <Emurph332My> @NicolleDWallace Lol, if so im really Bad!!
971399460688482310 2018-03-07 14:57:33 UTC <Emurph332My> When did @realDonaldTrump correct all his mis spells on this tweet. LOVE Mr. Baldwin as Trump, he deserves a Emmy for the part!!!
971398629662646273 2018-03-07 14:54:15 UTC <Emurph332My> Always love Friday nights! Thanks @billmaher and your writers for never disappointing me. Loved the kids from Parkland last week tried to watch #FauxNews after Sam N had meltdown, had to change w/in 2 min LI said he worked for like 5 sec for Trump. They r the only fakenews on tv
965768199701696512 2018-02-19 02:00:56 UTC <Emurph332My> @lupussistas Sweet girl.  I'm a Caucasian gal that's been living w lupus for 30 yrs. I've always had waist length hair and the last few yrs have developed a huge bald patch in upper right top back of scalp. Now i for sure won't cut my hair so I can do a comb over.
959868311117991937 2018-02-03 19:16:53 UTC <Emurph332My> @Comey @joeybaker09 As of yet nothing in dossier can be disproven. Watch something other than Fox News to get your facts straight. Even Sean Hannity has admitted his program is opinion news not facts! Also they've had a fisa warrant on page since 2013...
959867123014217728 2018-02-03 19:12:10 UTC <Emurph332My> @TGowdySC @RichWeikart @SGGreenEyes @scorkren @ArwenoftheGlade Your just plain wrong.  Do your homework instead of getting your "facts" from fox "opinion " news.  Hannity interview w Ted Coppell he even admitted that his program is opinion news not facts!
959866456832962560 2018-02-03 19:09:31 UTC <Emurph332My> @TGowdySC @RichWeikart Do your homework,  Page has been under rightful surveillance since 2013. Trump has just made an obstruction charge even easier now.
959865815377031170 2018-02-03 19:06:58 UTC <Emurph332My> Never thought I'd agree w Trey Gowdy but thank God there are many republicans of the same mind. Trump has used this fake cherry picked memo not only  to try to deflect Mueller but as a campaign tool it borders on treason on devins part & making a obstruct charge closer for Trumphttps://twitter.com/TGowdySC/status/959495152770469888
955949194606469120 2018-01-23 23:43:43 UTC <Emurph332My> @KateBennett_DC @betsy_klein When is she going to leave this assbag

955947322051002368 2018-01-23 23:36:16 UTC <Emurph332My> @realDonaldTrump Hopefully we still have a environment we can live in by the TIME your done w all your de regulations.  R u really this ignorant.  SMH

943697335305023488 2017-12-20 04:19:12 UTC <Emurph332My> @Marcshort45 @HallieJackson Of course he is. As soon as Sanders said they didn't have a plan re signing,  I knew for sure he try to make a HUGH display at his "winter Whitehouse " to do a over the top signing of a very unpopular bill!
940792369464643584 2017-12-12 03:55:54 UTC <Emurph332My> Keep it up please @Acosta try to get some truth out of @PressSec I wouldn't hold your breath though. I do love that u keep trying w the entire administration!https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/940631884241031169

940317224019120128 2017-12-11 20:27:51 UTC <Emurph332My> Of course it does. Can't wait for the entire gang of Trump to be incarcerated!https://twitter.com/CNN/status/940314769629892609

938123567379689472 2017-12-05 19:11:02 UTC <Emurph332My> Trumps hair reminds of "Irving's" portrayed by Christian Bale on American Hustle! Have to wonder if he goes thru same process to fix it just so! I just want someone to tussle it and ask him if "you bothered now??" Moohaha
938064948512555009 2017-12-05 15:18:06 UTC <Emurph332My> Just when I think crazy can't get crazier some jackass says something like This on the record.  #NoMoorehttps://twitter.com/funder/status/938062629112897536

936653068854104064 2017-12-01 17:47:48 UTC <Emurph332My> @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump U r insane.. r u going to go to Bethesda and release your physical info as every modern day President has!?!
936652647389638656 2017-12-01 17:46:07 UTC <Emurph332My> @JoeNBC @DanScavino Duh u can tell they were being sarcastic.  Giving winks that they had pre taped. Fox news is & has always been the only fake news
936650888520830976 2017-12-01 17:39:08 UTC <Emurph332My> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump U do realize your precious daughter is Jewish!?!

931996769021546496 2017-11-18 21:25:20 UTC <Emurph332My> @samstein I love @SenFranken. He at least has taken ownership of his behavior and was the 1st to ask for a ethics review. While the pic and account of skit rehearsal are terrible, I'm sorry they don't come close to Roy Moore and no where near @realDonaldTrump past &prob current behavior!
931994345464565760 2017-11-18 21:15:42 UTC <Emurph332My> @TheRickyDavila Just her speak about this and had to sit on my hands so I wouldn't throw my remote! She can always write in a Republican that isn't a horrible person in every way I can think of.
931993729996677120 2017-11-18 21:13:15 UTC <Emurph332My> @realDonaldTrump Get your head out of your butt and stop trying to please your spoiled grown kids...
931993280463687680 2017-11-18 21:11:28 UTC <Emurph332My> This is so terrible. Knew it was going to happen and continue too. They need to stop progress on the entire project!https://twitter.com/vicenews/status/931981782953676800

931701717263110145 2017-11-17 01:52:54 UTC <Emurph332My> @KatyTurNBC I really noticed the sniffing this time too. I hear it every time he speaks but after he threw hissy fit when asked after a debate about it, figured they found way to position mic. Someone's in trouble,  heard the sniffs and had to open his own water bottle! Lol
930096108201828352 2017-11-13 15:32:47 UTC <Emurph332My> @NicolleDWallace So happy for you, love the way you rocked hosting @Morning_Joe!
