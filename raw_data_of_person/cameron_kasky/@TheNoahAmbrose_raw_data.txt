965724863464919040 2018-02-19 23:08:44 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ Not strong enough. Like I said, if you're a responsible gun owner, you shouldn't be worried about extra background checks
965720786798628864 2018-02-19 22:52:32 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ Numerous countries such as Australia, Japan, and the US in the 90s instituted check and bans on assault weapons and mass shootings dropped
965720303845433344 2018-02-19 22:50:37 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ It's literally easier to buy a gun in Florida than vote
965720231669792768 2018-02-19 22:50:20 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ I don't think you understand how easy it is tho. In Florida you can buy an AR15 without a photo id but you need an id to vote in Florida
965718342882545665 2018-02-19 22:42:49 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ If you're a responsible gun owner, what do you have to fear about common sense gun control? If you're so stable, you have nothing to fear
965718072987455488 2018-02-19 22:41:45 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ Yes and current gun laws make it easier for those people to access weapons to make mass murder possible
965716413741707270 2018-02-19 22:35:09 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ Also take the situation in Las Vegas, I'd love to see a knife shoot 500 people from a window in minutes
965716305767813122 2018-02-19 22:34:44 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ Not all mentally unstable people commit mass murder tho. Trump signed a bill into law allowing mentally ill people to purchase firearms
965678234556870662 2018-02-19 20:03:27 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @jujumagix @jaxrich_ And what did the person use to kill the people?

949378339915157504 2018-01-05 20:33:29 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 I don't hate that he's an older white man, I hate that we can't put up more diverse candidates. If Joe gets the nom I'll still support him
949377694046867457 2018-01-05 20:30:55 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Like people of color, women, and LGBT people. I'd love to see Kamala Harris, Julian Castro, Cory Booker
949377507681325056 2018-01-05 20:30:11 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 People hate to play identity politics but in the end, putting a face on issues is important to identify with voters
949377381457891328 2018-01-05 20:29:40 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Because of the current socio-political climate it's important to have candidates that reflect the base of the party
949367711074848768 2018-01-05 19:51:15 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 That's understandable but Hillary did get 3 million more votes than Bernie. Bernie even told his supporters at the DNC to vote for Hillary
949359395556687872 2018-01-05 19:18:12 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Bernie is great. Joe is great. But it's time Dems put up candidates that reflect their main voter base (poc, women, LGBT)
949357470983643136 2018-01-05 19:10:33 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Why didn't Bernie voters in those states turn out for Hillary? Like I said 10% of Bernie voters nationwide is a very large voter base
949352362094809088 2018-01-05 18:50:15 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 10% of Bernie voters in the primary went onto vote Trump
949352262308155393 2018-01-05 18:49:52 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Bernie didn't have the moderates haha. He was wayyyy more radically left than Hillary
949316431975469056 2018-01-05 16:27:29 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 If Bernie could've done what Hillary couldn't, then why did Hillary get 3 million more votes than Bernie in the primaries?
949304777925713920 2018-01-05 15:41:10 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 If Biden ran in 2016 instead of Hillary, the outcome would've been the same. If Hillary ran in 2020, then we might have a different outcome
949304280116289536 2018-01-05 15:39:12 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 No non-incumbent democrat has run successfully to succeed another 2 term democrat since 1836
949304077212626949 2018-01-05 15:38:23 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @carlm311 Fair point but Hillary lost because of many outside factors, not just qualifications. Also it was historically unlikely for Hillary to win

938563436090445824 2017-12-06 00:18:55 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @AronJohnsonNC Hypersexualization allows for internal racism bc of the societal standard of beauty and only allows for gay men to see others thru that lens
938557179136798721 2017-12-06 23:54:03 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> To understand it we must recognize it's at the societal fault of white cishet capitalist men perpetuating the patriarchy on our community
938556878321324037 2017-12-06 23:52:51 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Sexual assault in the gay community is NOT talked about enough
938555657166483463 2017-12-06 23:48:00 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> It also allows for much more sexual violence and assault because of "expectation"
938555443672166400 2017-12-06 23:47:09 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> It's a problem that was pushed by our cishet, white, capitalist, patriarchal society to discriminate against us and divide us
938555194106941441 2017-12-06 23:46:10 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> I hate hate hate the hypersexualization of single gay men! I can't even be friends with guys without feeling like I'm insinuating something!

933488048238624770 2017-11-22 00:11:08 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @ShoveItInMySass @AnitaOHara4 So I'm guessing that's a no, you haven't experienced dysphoria. So stop pretending you know what that feels like
933487558889222144 2017-11-22 00:09:12 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @ShoveItInMySass @AnitaOHara4 So what makes her still a man? She had reassignment surgery, so what makes her a 'he'?

933481000713244673 2017-11-22 23:43:08 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @ShoveItInMySass @AnitaOHara4 What are they? Since you seem to think sex determines gender?
933479383024758785 2017-11-22 23:36:42 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @ShoveItInMySass @AnitaOHara4 What about the 1 in 2000 people that are born intersex? What about their genetics? What does that make them?

897444009429409792 2017-08-15 13:05:00 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @BluJayy23 @_frankielc Yo let me help
897087075782209536 2017-08-14 13:26:40 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Our chancellor just said "love trumps hate" during his speech and the entire room broke out in applause
897072695506071552 2017-08-14 12:29:32 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Me every other day: we need to not sink to others levels Me now: punching nazis is patriotic
896766624891629568 2017-08-13 16:13:19 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> But my biggest fear is surrendering to and accepting an intolerant and fascist society
896766279171944448 2017-08-13 16:11:56 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> I'm scared for others. Getting hurt is only my 3rd biggest fear during a protest. My second biggest fear is anyone else getting hurt...
896766035105370112 2017-08-13 16:10:58 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Is a very real fear for us, we've come close to getting hit in the past. But a lot of you don't realize that I'm not scared for me...
896765660231073792 2017-08-13 16:09:29 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> A lot of people have been messaging asking if Brandon and I are ok because of the protestor killed in #cville bc getting hit in a protest..

893214948385579008 2017-08-03 21:00:13 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @matt_may How is it stupid to accept members of your community?
893211202112958464 2017-08-03 20:45:20 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> .@csydelko going to Boston Market for the first time! What do you recommend?
892530240450420736 2017-08-01 23:39:26 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> So Brandon and I were at a rally in DC and some guy we were standing next to said "were you two on Promposal?" And we were so shook

892123110681530371 2017-07-31 20:41:39 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> .@Scaramucci you can't call yourself an LGBT activist if you support higher deductibles for transgender people and limiting access to prep

891354976282390529 2017-07-29 17:49:21 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Funny how the same people that would always share "support our troops" on Facebook are now supporting efforts to ban some soldiers

882704705150963712 2017-07-05 20:56:16 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> @GIPHY @LikeIGive_Adam @WakingUpFrank That's like saying if you take out Michigan, Hillary wins the electoral college by a lot. They're states. They vote it's what they do
882638780326432768 2017-07-05 16:34:18 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> All the HB2 supporters in the #NCGA should be paying attention to thishttps://twitter.com/lgbtqnation/status/882588825175904257
882136443971305473 2017-07-04 07:18:12 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> I'm proud of those attempting to be Americans, fleeing from violence that are being banned from the U.S. and told they aren't welcome
882136236122624004 2017-07-04 07:17:22 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> I'm proud of the LGBT and minority Americans that fought for progress and continue to do so
882135747746304001 2017-07-04 07:15:26 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> Doesn't make me less of one. No matter how hard this administration tries, I'm proud of the diversity that America represents
882135211605196801 2017-07-04 07:13:18 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> But in all honesty we have come a long way as a nation, we have far to go but I'm proud to call myself an American and my identity...
882134118489837569 2017-07-04 07:08:57 UTC <TheNoahAmbrose> 241 years ago our ancestors declared that all men* are created equal, happy 4th!  *white Christian men who owned land
