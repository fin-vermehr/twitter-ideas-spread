Doggy diapers just caused infections, no matter how often changed, our young male took to marking the seniors smells. Not my favorite time, but what do you do? Scrub and scrub
971560163030298624 2018-03-07 01:36:08 UTC <lyfeinthemiddle> @heartless_pe @MissJonesyBones Well, Id have to dig through my emailstay tuned. I saw a presentation from a group that went to New Zealand last summer through a company that organized educational tours abroad. More locally, you can just call a principal and set it up. Its pretty common
971556282384764928 2018-03-07 01:20:43 UTC <lyfeinthemiddle> @heartless_pe There are programs out there that organize thisyou should do it! I know some that went to New Zealand last year; I get to travel around the state. Its all awesome to see!

968977101842993153 2018-02-28 22:31:58 UTC <lyfeinthemiddle> The more I learn about the background of the Parkland shooter, the sadder and more frustrated I get. So many red flags ignored or protocol failed, which, in my teaching experience, is the norm more than the exception. What will it take for us to be taken seriously when we report?
