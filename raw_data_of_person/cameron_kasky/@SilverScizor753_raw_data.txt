972197262557368320 2018-03-09 19:47:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @chuggaaconroy I'm simultaneously astounded and unsurprised, which i guess is par for the course at this point lmao
972177230309875712 2018-03-09 18:28:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sonnystrait Buu would eat anyone who disagreed with him, Cell would settle disagreements via martial arts tournament and Frieza would just kill anyone.  So Cell, not only is the death count lowest he'd make a big show out of whatever he did, which could be entertaining
972173939836358664 2018-03-09 18:15:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar JOOOJOOOO NOOOOOO
972169022186942465 2018-03-09 17:55:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Jojo no
972168024898920457 2018-03-09 17:51:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar 
972159407923564545 2018-03-09 17:17:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> So it's come to my attention that the Google image for Masahiro Sakurai is very much incredibly wrong  ...but does this mean she believes it??? Lmaooooo
972157865069867010 2018-03-09 17:11:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Lmao thought you were being sarcastic but makes slightly more sense now
972157405386690561 2018-03-09 17:09:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JeffreyCain8 I can give a pass for the casual fan not knowing Nintendo is Japanese but being upset because of that??? I don't even know, that racism is just confusing to me and pretty deep seated if that knowledge ruins video games you enjoyed lmao
972113507557797888 2018-03-09 14:14:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Classmate behind me, looking up who created Kirby: Masahiro Sakurai? Why does he have an Asian name?? This can't be him?? This just ruined my childhood!!  ????????????????
971982727229554690 2018-03-08 05:35:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @aldenalden4 VERY OKAY I LOVE HER TOO
971944106174959616 2018-03-08 03:01:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets @siilvertongue I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU
971922977133617152 2018-03-08 01:37:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> A year or so ago it was said Sakurai has been working on a project for Switch, zero info besides that. Lmao i guess this was it hahahahttps://twitter.com/AllSourceGaming/status/971901365826940928
971921040883449856 2018-03-08 01:30:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I'm glad you're doing well, you deserve it! 
971918756468477953 2018-03-08 01:21:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of the best things about new Smash Bros coming are we gonna get more kickass character trailers!!
971897549840900096 2018-03-08 23:56:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Crash on Switch got leaked in January, wish I made a tweet saying "Crash is gonna be in the direct" so i could look like I made an awesome prediction lmao
971897079743369216 2018-03-08 23:54:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah I figured the logo was a giveaway but can't be too sure haha, sounds good tho!
971896381706330114 2018-03-08 23:52:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Unless of course it's an updated port, but I feel like Nintendo would be a bit more transparent about that, though I haven't seen the trailer yet so I dunno
971895074429788161 2018-03-08 23:46:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Shoutout to Masahiro Sakurai, the guy who hates being expected to continually make sequels for his games, for continuously making Smash Bros. sequels because he pours his soul into the games and knows they won't be as good as he'd want them to be without him at the helm.
971870785454460928 2018-03-08 22:10:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue @eggnuggets I LOVE YOU TOO!!! 
971865451407073281 2018-03-08 21:49:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> For #IWD2018 I want to shoutout my two best friends @eggnuggets & @siilvertongue They mean the world to me; they're beautiful, hilarious, smart, supportive & overall amazing ppl who inspire me to work towards becoming a better person, I'm always thankful to have them in my life!
971598021569007616 2018-03-07 04:06:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Still even more bummed I can't play Fire Emblem Heroes because one of the newest heroes is Female!Morgan AND LOOK AT HOW CUTE SHE IS pic.twitter.com/2NNsxMILh2
971597165683462144 2018-03-07 04:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> And that's not even counting the ongoing dub of Dragon Ball Super, and a few from this season not to mention my current backlog. I love anime and I can't wait watch!!!
971597163309518848 2018-03-07 04:03:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's my favorite anime, the anime adaptation of my favorite game, my 4th or so favorite anime, and a series who's last season aired in 2015...y'all I'm super hyped
971597159161352192 2018-03-07 04:03:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> This Spring season of anime sees My Hero Academia, Persona 5: The Animation, Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma, and High School DxD Hero essentially aired back to back Saturday - Tuesday every week for 12/25 weeks  h o l y s h i t
971581766124408835 2018-03-07 03:01:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Persona 5 if you like JRPGs, Crash Bandicoot: N-Sane Trilogy if u like platformers, and Dragon Ball FighterZ if u like 2D fighters  I actually haven't played the latter two but I'm positive they're excellent
971207420688125958 2018-03-06 02:14:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets I guess that's my name now
971206874589794304 2018-03-06 02:12:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 @eggnuggets Goodbye my friends I'll remember you fondly

970912386747109381 2018-03-05 06:42:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie According to timelines Gen I & III happen simultaneously, II & IV are also simultaneous. Meaning Team Rocket was active while Magma/Aqua & Galactic were doing theirs. It's a good thing Rocket wasn't after legends so it kept things to one planetary risk at a time, but still lmao
970702565561327618 2018-03-05 16:48:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets @siilvertongue

969962626066407424 2018-03-03 15:48:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Didn't know the 3DS did that but Wii to Wii U had a big show of Pikmin transferring stuff!
969790961705504768 2018-03-02 04:25:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I swear they like gonna be like in anime and shows where they completely disappear for seasons but come back as surprise allies or something
968712315544711168 2018-02-27 04:59:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets She looks great! I love the colors!!
968635994823122944 2018-02-27 23:56:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ErikaHarlacher In the anime and games they just pop out but I think in the Pokmon Origins specials, a Pokmon breaking out of a Pok Ball actually completely shatters the ball, just destroys the thing.
968602030758645762 2018-02-27 21:41:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets @siilvertongue This is freaking amazing we're doing this when we're meet up right????

965820118755397634 2018-02-19 05:27:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 There are plenty of people who love and care for you and want to be there for you. I'm sorry you're feeling this way about yourself, but you're honestly a great person, it's okay to be emotional, please don't beat yourself up over having feelings like that.
965817578617700352 2018-02-19 05:17:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 That's not true, you deserve to have people around you just as much as anyone. And you do things to help others, you've definitely said something to me that helped a lot when I was down on myself on more than one occasion, and I honestly wish I can be able to help you the same

964348027967365120 2018-02-15 03:57:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KaiserNeko DBZA is the reason I'm into Dragon Ball in the first place, it's how i got into the franchise and now it's one of my favorites, I really enjoy it and that's thanks to you all.  So again, thank you.
964347549669904384 2018-02-15 03:55:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KaiserNeko Thank you & everyone at TFS for all the work you've put into the series, all the laughs you've given over the years. I'd love love love for you guys to take on the Buu saga, as I'm sure you guys do too, but if Cell Games are our finale, that's ok too, I'm glad we made it this far
964345180559200256 2018-02-15 03:46:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> The wonderfully generous @GirafarigTree got me the Pokmon Adventures artbook book and it's AMAZING!

962171881737674752 2018-02-09 03:50:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tweets with multiple photos have been displaying them out of order for me, anyone else have this issue? Started today, on only mobile Android, wondering if a Twitter issue or somehow on my end

961672834866208770 2018-02-08 18:47:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finally a good use for Gold Points. The article also says if you don't have enough points you can pay the rest out of pocket so that's neat too!https://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/961670749848129536
961650031018283010 2018-02-08 17:16:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie You get two slow claps. Just two.
961038090142932992 2018-02-06 00:45:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Now I feel like a chump for only putting one of my crushes instead of all of them
960739300244688896 2018-02-05 04:57:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I loved doing this tho fictional characters are awesome and very important to me thanks for reading me ramble about some of my faves
960739091645128704 2018-02-05 04:57:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> 15. Last one is an OTP thing but I don't really ship characters and I don't wanna spend 30 min thinking over a forced answer sorry lmao
960738483441684480 2018-02-05 04:54:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> 14. If I could have a character's wardrobe it'd be the Protagonist of Persona 5 like this guy's style is amazing I'd wear all of thesepic.twitter.com/IicfMbEWOV
960736511749697536 2018-02-05 04:46:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> 13. If I could meet any fictional character I'd want to meet All Might from My Hero Academia. He's very inspiring and lots of times gives me the strength to push forward.pic.twitter.com/5QiMuwJKKq
960735554190172160 2018-02-05 04:43:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bonus: The "I'm going to kill you" look. Underappreciated but very powerful   Android 18 from Dragon Ball Super Makoto Niijima from Persona 5pic.twitter.com/it2KXJmOKr
960733775612301312 2018-02-05 04:35:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> 12. There are a lot of looks I love, way too many to name, but I love nonstandard hair colors or styles.  Widowmaker from Overwatch  Moriko Morioka from Recovery of an MMO Junkie  N from Pokmon Black/White Godot from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials & Tribulationspic.twitter.com/ZTrWFncC2x
960728961532784640 2018-02-05 04:16:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> 11. There are lots of personalities I like in characters but to name one example cuz more than that is hard, those who work hard with an intense drive to be number 1 and are very confident (Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z, Soma Yukihira from Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma)pic.twitter.com/kGVUDQjZM4
960721917006307330 2018-02-05 03:48:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> 10. Character I look like is Mikey North from Life is Strange: Before the Storm. Short hair, glasses, landing strip forehead. This may as well be a face reveal.pic.twitter.com/m68KuYRUVf
960720004999196672 2018-02-05 03:41:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's comforting to me in a weird way cuz part of me feels I'd do something like that but another part feels "that's too drastic for one person" or whatever so I like seeing such an intense dedication for another person I guess
960719459307655168 2018-02-05 03:39:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> For example Phoenix Wright (Ace Attorney) was gonna be an art major but became a lawyer just because he heard Miles Edgeworth, a childhood friend he knew for one year and helped him once, became a prosecutor and Wright wanted to see him againpic.twitter.com/xLs7rtfhz9
960719429955878923 2018-02-05 03:38:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> 9. Huge comfort characters weird answer but characters who will do big things like change the course of their whole life for someone because they care or worry or are thankful for them that much
960713335481217025 2018-02-05 03:14:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> 8. If I could be a fictional character I'd probably want to be the Protagonist from Persona 5 (again, I know) But honestly the life he leads, juggling school, part time Jobs, an awesome social life, and going to an alternate reality to reform society, that's the life I wanna livepic.twitter.com/WdVtl92xgi
960712006578966528 2018-02-05 03:09:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> 7. Character I'd love to be best friends with is Ryuji Sakamoto from Persona 5  Kinda surprised how much I liked him but he's just a really good dude. Very loyal, always got your back no matter what, gets mad when someone wrongs u; those are the friends you hold ontopic.twitter.com/HNlKCUyoVR
960709780066226176 2018-02-05 03:00:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> 6. Character I'd date would probably be Dr. Tae Takemi from Persona 5. Punk rock goth doctor who's smart, funny, and likes to tease, super my type sign me uppic.twitter.com/kJQdbll8pp
960707222396395520 2018-02-05 02:50:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> 5. Current fictional crush is the beautiful and powerful Majin Android 21 from Dragon Ball FighterZ, turn me into a dessert please pic.twitter.com/VBlVtVLuRD
960706414653198336 2018-02-05 02:47:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> 4. First fictional crush was Starfire from Teen Titans. She pretty she kind but make her mad and she'll destroy you. She's the strongest of the Titans and she's  awesonepic.twitter.com/iJwOcNXLtS
960705483945529344 2018-02-05 02:43:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3. Finding one character I grew up with was tough but most consistent show in my childhood was Tom & Jerry, I could watch these guys fight forever. I actually want to own every episode of original Tom & Jerry one day. Such a classic.pic.twitter.com/WvfoX5nhPv
960703145184768000 2018-02-05 02:34:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> -is really tough to deal with. I can also relate to feeling like you're supposed to be better than someone and being furious that you're not. Not a good thing to feel, but I get it.pic.twitter.com/ddpzioLY0C
960703128239779840 2018-02-05 02:34:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> 2. Character I relate to a surprising amount is Katsuki Bakugo from My Hero Academia  Yeah he's a real ass but I relate to a lot of his insecurities & struggles. Being told ur the best or talented ur whole life only to get thrown in an environment where you're not the best-pic.twitter.com/fFQIYwSh0F

959524611468775427 2018-02-02 20:31:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS I don't know if it's one person who runs this acc or multiple but you all clearly having fun over there, I love it, keep it up
959483491690917889 2018-02-02 17:47:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 None of that is true at all! You are funny and a pretty cool gal. I'd say it's clear u work hard which is good but i wouldn't say u try to hard. I'm sorry you are feeling insecure, but you're fine!
959269483939495936 2018-02-01 03:37:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon YOU STILL GOT IT THO THATS OK GET THEM GOOD, NATURAL

959076152169127936 2018-02-01 14:49:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can see the fun in making "fake leaks", but not in intentionally fooling people. I wish people who made fake leaks admitted they were fake from the get go. It would make things more entertaining for everyone involved.

958020246576750592 2018-01-29 16:53:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MissTadion Lmao this is what the Super Mario Cereal amiibo should have been: a functional bowl
958018871314862080 2018-01-29 16:47:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my dreams last night featured a board game where u play as amiibo except there were Pikmin 3 amiibo but not of the captains or the Pikmin or the enemies, but the fruit. Like a strawberry or an orange. Imagine buying an amiibo and it's just an apple or something lmaooo
958007978216640512 2018-01-29 16:04:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't usually rant about stuff like this but it's really been annoying me the past few days
958007974487785473 2018-01-29 16:04:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> She was a human adult who became an android less than 10 years prior to the events of the story. She's been an android for less than 10 years but she's still, physically and most importantly mentally, an adult woman  I don't even have the game and I gathered that much
958007970121609216 2018-01-29 16:04:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Honestly getting tired of the "Android 21 (from Dragon Ball FighterZ) is not even 10" posts bc that one screenshot is taken completely out of context. 21 is in no way a child

956888048704290817 2018-01-26 13:54:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not everyone is crazy like me and will buy consoles solely to play Persona games, so hopefully the franchise gets on Switch so more people can play them! :Dhttps://twitter.com/NinWire/status/956871427285712896

955997974684987392 2018-01-23 02:57:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> And ya I know i could just pick it up anytime but I'm too busy and will probably get frustrated by not making progress as fast I'd like hahaha Sorry if this was weird I'm super bored and I'm just thinking aloud rn hahaha
955997970109030401 2018-01-23 02:57:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> But after years of seeing so many artists on social media I've been wondering lately what my art world look like if I'd kept at it for 8 or so years. I also briefly wonder what I'd draw but I feel the answer to that one is obvious lmao
955997966132826112 2018-01-23 02:57:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of quite a few skills I wanted to be good at when I was younger was art, just drawing stuff. I never held onto it obviously and knowing me doubt I'll ever try again.

953481061350232065 2018-01-16 04:16:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar That's hilarious in concept but come on, not even good memes? that's too bad
953142845862445056 2018-01-15 05:52:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope Faye Valentine is doing ok. I hope Tharja is being a good mom. I hope Link gets to take a long nap. I hope Red visits his mom, she really misses him. I hope Miles Edgeworth has some nice tea. I hope Bowser continues to do his best to be a good dad.  I hope everyone's okay.
953140724152918016 2018-01-15 05:43:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> you ever think of how fictional characters are doing? Like, in between parts of the story you don't get to see or even beyond the story's conclusion? like I hope everyone's doing ok, I hope they're happy, or as happy as they can be.
953088549192192000 2018-01-15 02:16:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Other ppl when I'm age 18/19: wow are you 16? You look 16!  Other ppl today, at age 20.5, appearance hasn't changed a bit: wow are you 14  What am I doing wrong

952667184614051840 2018-01-14 22:22:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar close, but I actually disagree
952666653774499841 2018-01-14 22:20:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar i agree with the opposite of that, actually, don't try to trick me
952666396495884288 2018-01-14 22:19:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar no but that wouldn't be bad
952665924477358080 2018-01-14 22:17:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Tenders are tender they'll take care of you they're kind and good and tasty.  Tastier, I'd even dare say
952665413481005064 2018-01-14 22:15:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Tenders give you more chicken per piece why have like 5 nuggs when you could have like 3 tendies and consume more chicken
952632217867636737 2018-01-14 20:03:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> That being said, romantic relationships are still important, obvi, I just can't note on them much since I've no experience lmao. But friends are great too and shouldn't be forgotten in storytelling.
952632216533831685 2018-01-14 20:03:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Friendships like that shouldn't be ignored or cast aside in media/storytelling for adults too. One reason I love the Persona franchise is that the biggest theme is the Power of Friendship is one of the greatest things ever and even if you think that's cheesy it's the truth.
952632215078428673 2018-01-14 20:03:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> If anything, friendships become even more important than when you are a kid, because life just gets harder and it's better to get through with other people. Having friends in my life has helped me immensely, and those relationships are very important to me.
952632213442650114 2018-01-14 20:03:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Romantic love and relationships are great, but platonic love and friendships are honestly beyond amazing as well. Just because you become a teenager/young adult doesn't replace romance for friendships, it just adds romance into your life.https://twitter.com/AshiaMonet/status/952055347014926337

950847633182154752 2018-01-09 21:51:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like how the point of Nintendo Directs are to bring information directly to consumers yet consumers are upsetting themselves with buying too much into info from indirect sources lmao

950643163215122432 2018-01-09 08:19:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Brain: You still have like 3 volumes of Pokmon Adventures manga to read, you could learn to read music or Japanese like you've wanted for yrs, hell try something new remember that time like 8 yrs ago you kinda wanted to draw as a hobby?  Me:...maybe I'll do nothing for 3 hours
950637758149775360 2018-01-08 07:57:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Brain: Alright, it's past 12am, we have quite a few options here, we could go to bed & get sleep. we could watch anime.

949884068765855744 2018-01-06 06:03:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Ok but the interesting thing is that leaks/rumors from multiple apparently reliable sources very highly lean towards a Jan 11 Direct being true, since mid-December actually.  But yeah posing as the real account is messed up and are pretty dumb
949837651447832576 2018-01-06 02:58:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 I can't stop laughing at this, I now have to use this nickname if I get the chance thanks ahahahahaha
949673035149299714 2018-01-06 16:04:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Same tbh. I know I'm like a year behind on eps. but tbh that doesn't even amount to much. Scheduling is too inconsistent that it's become to much of of a hassle to keep up with it, unfortunately.

947350726791127040 2017-12-30 06:16:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> -met and made some amazing friends that are very important to me -albeit very much too late, recognized a lot of my flaws and mistakes. didn't really succeed in fixing any, but I recognized at least -despite being my worst year ever, I survived, which counts for something I guesshttps://twitter.com/adamjk/status/944802381727899649
947349097576632320 2017-12-30 06:10:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 5 is my favorite video game and I loved playing it and what I also love is other people playing and enjoying it! I feel annoying often gushing about it and try not to be obnoxious about wanting people to play it but people are playing it and enjoying it and that's great!

943596577582698497 2017-12-20 21:38:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen Best way to describe DDLC is a cute little dating sim about dating girls in your high school's literature club. Sounds pretty standard but there's a lot more to it than that ;)

939286290822041600 2017-12-08 00:11:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 IT'S YOUR BIRTHMAS MERRY BIRTHMAS HAVE A GREAT BIRTHMAS
939148438687703040 2017-12-08 15:03:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was initially a little eh that Persona 5 didn't win as many awards but honestly it's a feat for the series to even make it there, very happy about that!https://twitter.com/MysticDistance/status/938951713146523649
938997001105969152 2017-12-07 05:01:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have never gotten fully immersed into anything like I have that game, and I'm excited for summer break when I'll take the time to dedicate my life to that masterpiece all over again!
938996745068933120 2017-12-07 05:00:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been able to play few 2017 games. Only major ones really are Persona 5, Odyssey and maybe I'll get the chance to get well into BotW and Splatoon 2 by Christmas.  Despite that though, I have no doubt Persona 5 would be my personal Game of the Year. A phenomenal experience.
938953047023157249 2017-12-07 02:07:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> "I won't miss anything by not watching the Game Awards. Award  shows are dumb anyway and multiple people will live tweet"  *apparently a remix of P5's "Life Will Change" was played*  well damn lmao
938934892284522496 2017-12-07 00:54:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar From what I understand, someone drew, with professional level art, a fancomic of Zootopia about pro-life, with one of the characters getting an abortion or something
938911596751015936 2017-12-07 23:22:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've spent a collective 6 hours today attempting to study and I've done half a problem so what the hell is focus and how do I do that again
938898630383230976 2017-12-07 22:30:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity It's definitely fake, definitely an attempted attack. I'd report and move on.
938889820100800512 2017-12-07 21:55:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets uhhh I'm dusting the snow, duh, gotta keep it clean
938889356407951362 2017-12-07 21:54:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> The beauty of my new profile pic, me in a sexy holiday themed maid outfit, was made by @eggnuggets and it's amazing, shoutouts to her  Honestly I wish I could look this hot, this is so good like wowpic.twitter.com/IzvqIFESQg
938880503142371328 2017-12-07 21:18:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another reason I'm just like/gonna be Morioka Moriko: I, too, convert prices/see all purchases in terms of spending money on games.https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/938876038423048192
938828346900787200 2017-12-07 17:51:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope everyone's final school days of the semester/finals + studying are going well! Good luck!!!  As for how I've been doing, I'm pretty sure I've looked like this all week. Just gradually dying on the inside.pic.twitter.com/mXAD5Htfeg

938799632204926976 2017-12-07 15:57:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets MERRY BIRTHMAS YOU GOLDEN EGG YOU BETTER HAVE AN AWESOME DAY TODAY, GOT IT?? 
938778295730130945 2017-12-07 14:32:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AlqTheTentacle Creators actually gain on this while bumping the price up for patrons
938778077223702529 2017-12-07 14:31:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AlqTheTentacle If I understand correctly, before, Patreon takes a cut from each pledge, meaning a $1 pledge doesn't give creator full dollar.  Now, that processing fee is asked of patrons. So that $1.30 or whatever pledge gives creator $1 and Patreon takes the rest.
938670752399753217 2017-12-06 07:25:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets you've been up longer than I have punk you go to bed
938670703313813504 2017-12-06 07:25:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also I could definitely use this lmao, weird thing I do is look to anime characters as pillars of support/inspiration. MHA's All Might and Food Wars!'s Yukihira Soma are the strongest pillars for me rn hahapic.twitter.com/QF2V52SboE
938668686730199040 2017-12-06 07:17:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Right as MHA ended for this year's season, Food Wars picked up for the Third Plate. Third Plate will run for 24 eps, which means it'll end right before Spring 2018. Spring is when MHA S3 starts and tbh I'm psyched, those are my fave two ongoing series rn

938472799454269440 2017-12-06 18:18:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MMOJunkieAnime Tough choice, but I've always been a fan of long hair!
938458267411509249 2017-12-06 17:21:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> When studying/doing hw, I sometimes like to listen to music that fits my mood about the work  So since finals are coming it's only fitting I listen to music that fits the end of the world:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLChuSnPCSw
938261985334054912 2017-12-05 04:21:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ErikaHarlacher Never in my life did I imagine that Sephiroth, Mickey Mouse, Homer Simpson, and Peter Griffin could all theoretically exist in the same video game.  Not sure how to feel about this.
938246160581570560 2017-12-05 03:18:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree YAAAY CONGRATS I'M PROUD OF YOU
938189122434453504 2017-12-05 23:31:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I had trouble figuring out its type at first. I didn't lose but he rocked me hahaha. I've never had an easy fight against Guzma and Golisopod was the main reason for that haha
938187171684671489 2017-12-05 23:23:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Gained respect for that 'mon immediately from Guzma's first fight. imo one of the coolest Alolan 'mons!
938186393955848192 2017-12-05 23:20:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree First off, best girl is Naoto, just making sure that's all clear here. Second off, I got it from Insert Coin: https://www.insertcoinclothing.com/search.html?q=persona Unfortunately, it looks it, along with a lot of the P4 merch, is unavailable. Apparently it was only a limited thing
938157096595525638 2017-12-05 21:24:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Seeing people passionate about what they love is imo one of the best things ever. Please, don't shut up, you're not being annoying. Keep going and keep loving what you love!!https://twitter.com/M4NAT/status/937504865026273283
938132763911303174 2017-12-05 19:47:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity One normal run + 2 -locke runs = 3 playthroughs and I still don't konw my way around that place, I taxi to most places lmao
938124684524244992 2017-12-05 19:15:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wearing Chie Satonaka's jacket from Persona 4 is pretty great because so many people recognize it and it's cool. This is why I make every shirt or whatever I wear be a reference to my fave stuff, makes it easier to find other fans and you don't even have to talk to them first! :D
938112111200391169 2017-12-05 18:25:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue lmao I knew you'd relate to that part

937905328183799808 2017-12-04 04:43:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I'd say Alakazam if you were older/knew if u had a grand mustache or not, but a Pokmon like Xatu would fit more I feel
937904350839672832 2017-12-04 04:39:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 Tho this is obvi a joke answer, real parts of my answer are -I feel like you'd be Fire type -Smart, friendly, loyal -Growlithe is a dog and Dragonite reminds me of a dog for some reason
937903321507037184 2017-12-04 04:35:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 Growlithe because, much like a dog, people somehow still like u no matter what u do. Also I almost said Arcanine but it's species name is "Legendary Pokmon" and u ain't legendary sorry bro.pic.twitter.com/poBr6LUYun
937899978172846080 2017-12-04 04:22:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I do enjoy Darkrai and their aesthetic very much, tho I hope I don't cause people nightmares unintentionally  if so sorry lmao

935626982573903877 2017-11-28 21:50:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Past me was content i guess but now I feel like that me wasn't *truly* happy and despite being much more stressed/unhappy with a lot in my life now, I don't think I wanna go back to old me.
935626722963320833 2017-11-28 21:49:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Not sure if that was what you were looking for but that's a few examples in how I've changed and I look at my whole life differently now.
935624000310476805 2017-11-28 21:38:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Kinda? I rarely worried a lot about a lot, never bothered thinking on the future, wasn't bothered by the fact I basically had no friends nor did i try to make many.  Now I worry a lot including multiple hypothetical futures, and feel super lonely if I don't talk to someone daily
935387251508416512 2017-11-27 05:57:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Got Super Mario Odyssey recently and man is it a hard game to put down hahaha. I've been wanting an open world platformer like this and I am loving it so far!!

935165882124460033 2017-11-27 15:18:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's really cool to see people whose lives are always busy in a good way. They can like go to school and/or have a job, pursue and be skilled in 3+ hobbies, do all sorts of different things and somehow still have time for sleep, friends, etc.; I wonder how they do it.
935149987964575744 2017-11-27 14:15:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you need some good music to get you started back from holiday, the boss theme from the Project Octopath Traveler demo (which is pretty cool, check it out if you like RPGs) is a good jam, my music of choice this morning!https://youtu.be/zoV0JxO9JEA

934962222920544257 2017-11-26 01:48:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MilesExpress999 If you take things a step further, English gets even dumber, as it also applies to bimonthly. The word bimonthly (specifically twice a month) is both just as frequent as biweekly (every two weeks) and less frequent than biweekly (twice a week), assuming the month is 4 weeks long.

933218676903415808 2017-11-21 06:20:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wanna write a thing on analysis/opinions on the Near/Mello arc of Death Note but I've run into a problem I never have when writing: I have *too much* to talk about hahaha
933180692942372864 2017-11-21 03:49:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed The female form is amazing, but why is it so strange I make note of guys for once, huh?  Also: this poll is asking everyone else, not me ;D

933166730951700480 2017-11-21 02:54:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS ME THANK YOU KIRBY 
933082676655022081 2017-11-21 21:20:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd True, that's more disastrous than Lillie's kidnapping. But, if you want to think about it in a roundabout way: The kidnapping of Lillie and Nebby would eventually lead to the "disaster" of unleashing Ultra Beasts unto the world. Think that way, then it's on par with the rest
933079109479133184 2017-11-21 21:06:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I should add, this definitely applies to side series games too! For example, in Pokmon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky, Absol appears in Crystal Crossing, right before you fight Grovyle and the big reveals/twists to follow!https://twitter.com/FloralSerenity/status/933078076942102528
933077278132703232 2017-11-21 20:58:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I didn't catch on until a while ago/Sun & Moon but yeah it's super cool they do that. Now that we have caught on tho, I'll always be super suspicious on any future Absol appearances hahaha
933076483958026240 2017-11-21 20:55:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Route 8's was puzzling me, but I forgot that's where you first see them, so thanks for that!
933075550297616384 2017-11-21 20:52:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Won't list every example, but I'll end with Sun/Moon's Tapu Village: where Lillie gets kidnapped by Team Skull and the story starts to ramp up.  It's clearly shown careful consideration is given to choosing where you can find Absol, and that's a little detail I really appreciate!
933074567526014976 2017-11-21 20:48:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> In Hoenn, Route 120. In between Fortree and Lilycove right before you discover the Aqua/Magma base and the story approaches its climax  IN Sinnoh, Route 213 (DP), close to where the Galactic Bomb goes off. In Pt, Mt. Coronet, where the climax of Cyrus' plan takes place
933073990742134784 2017-11-21 20:45:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> This reminds me the reason I like Absol quite a bit is that almost every single place they appear in over the series actually foreshadows the game's impending disastershttps://twitter.com/oujamon/status/932558434754494466
933000912725069824 2017-11-21 15:55:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Merry Birthmas, Lady Lucah! You're one of my favorite content creators, content you make always brings a smile to my face! :D I hope you have a wonderful day today!
932865468351860738 2017-11-20 06:57:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Something cool to think about is that teenage mutant ninja turtles could very well exist in our real, un-2D world, but mankind has never seen them before because they're *really* good ninjas
932767719275094016 2017-11-20 00:28:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA My favorite character in #PersonaQ is the Persona 3 Main Character! It was interesting and fun to get to hear him talk and interact with everyone, fully voiced! #sweepstakes
932639422046228480 2017-11-20 15:59:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting results, seems most people are down to date aliens, but androids are a deal breaker for a lot of people. What this information means, probably nothing, but it's information I'm glad to know
932331386912018432 2017-11-19 19:34:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity This is the most attention and detail they've given to the deliciousness of Slowpoke's tail.  It seems very strange.

931750421294665728 2017-11-17 05:06:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz tbh still pretty disappointed this is basically selling two "third versions" rather than a sequel type/much more alternate story, kinda hoped/assumed we wouldn't go back to third versions again.

931723718669324289 2017-11-17 03:20:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Overall, Champion's Road is a blast of a level,  a well designed level that truly tests the player's platforming skills and mastery over the game's 5 slightly different characters!
931723360836509696 2017-11-17 03:18:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> The level is a joke as Luigi, Peach's low speed was an issue, but Blue Toad was the hardest due to having weak jump, sometimes his high speed can be detrimental if not careful. But I learned the level well enought that Toad's runs weren't too bad
931723140916490240 2017-11-17 03:18:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I had the hardest time with Mario as I had to relearn the whole level without relying on Rosalina's Spin Jump but once I learned the level, getting to the end more and more consistently wasn't too bad.
931722436982296576 2017-11-17 03:15:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Randomly went back and truly 100%'d Super Mario 3D World, by getting every stamp. This means beating every single level with all 5 characters, including Champion's Road. I already beat it with Rosalina so this week I did with the other 4pic.twitter.com/Ei3V2jFCfk
931705902591369217 2017-11-17 02:09:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue I'm curious on what the world thinks
931646150960205825 2017-11-17 22:12:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity BUT THE GUITAR WAS THE BEST PART D: Aw, man. I will say tho the fact that they've changed the theme at all is pretty cool, they didn't do that for any of the other third versions (besides very very slightly enhancing the trainer and gym leader theme in B2W2)
931643522817642496 2017-11-17 22:01:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I'll try to avoid spoilers for #PokemonUltraSunMoon if I can help it, I will only ask this one very important thing: does Gladion's battle theme get a remix and if so is it good? Curious on how good the remixed battle themes are, but especially Gladion's
931642398307962880 2017-11-17 21:57:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Felt the same ever since they were first revealed in trailers. My fave part, when the guitar kicks in, feels watered down in this new version, unforntunately. Hope all the other remixes are good tho
931609128186900480 2017-11-17 19:44:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @InsertCoinTees @AtlusUSA Persona 5 is my favorite Persona game due to it's wonderful cast, stylish art direction, fantastic soundtrack and relatable themes #sweepstakes
931574151474708480 2017-11-17 17:26:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 I don't like TTG, but I can let that go, not all reboots/sequel/spinoff shows are good and that's ok. But when they make fun of fans of the OG TT, just feels they're actively insulting their own fanbase for just enjoying their past work, and I don't get why? To be edgy?
931560566736506880 2017-11-17 16:32:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Some thoughts on Pokmon Ultra Sun/Moon.  Also want to note that part of this is based on the assumption that almost nothing of the early game was shown/focused on in USUM marketing, little to nothing was changed in the game's first half.pic.twitter.com/KgnzeQBeOC
931551049235795968 2017-11-17 15:54:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 @Stupid_Pokenerd Damn Fair tho
931550776350183425 2017-11-17 15:53:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @SSamic22 JUST VALIDATE ME OK
931547787270983681 2017-11-17 15:41:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Total coincidence, but not a joke set up at all. Just genuine curiousity
931543197460975616 2017-11-17 15:23:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Given the opportunity and assuming both of these are 100% safe for all parties involved, you'd totally be down with dating:
931410772697190400 2017-11-16 06:36:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I feel like fake washing hands is a significantly unnecessary effort, in fact more effort than actually washing your hands. It's not that hard, it doesn't take long, I don't understand why so many people don't do it. In public bathrooms I avoid touching door handles bc of this
931230814699966465 2017-11-16 18:41:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets I'm still running over but maybe if I sprint I can cut that two week time period in half
931228978249125890 2017-11-16 18:34:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets If there's anything I can do, even if you just need someone to chat with, know that you can hit me up whenever 
930955788432134146 2017-11-15 00:28:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets I think if I run most of the way I can shave off at least a few days off that two week time period so yeah I'll right over

930804180960337920 2017-11-15 14:26:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eggnuggets Ok this I didn't consider and I really should have; 100% makes sense why you and other women would do that, & that's fine tbh. I guess it bothered me this morning cuz all 4 people who did it were adult men, who don't really have to worry about that kinda thing, y'know?
930778234400239621 2017-11-15 12:43:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> A pet peeve of mine are seat hogs on buses, as in ppl who sit on the aisle side seat, leaving the window side empty but also preventing people from easily getting a seat like really what makes u so high & mighty u just own 2 seats other ppl could sit in; get that entitlement out

930542120938758144 2017-11-14 21:05:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not just shady, it's freaking nighttime. EA screwed up royally but barely tried to fix it, actively made it worse instead. They're not gonna get through this without consequence

929027718141890560 2017-11-10 16:47:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Genuinely curious why so many people are vehemently against having 280 characters on Twitter. The way I see it: you can say twice as much in a single tweet. I personally see absolutely zero downsides that could possible come close to outweighing that fact, so why the hate?

However, it is not an all-powerful art; it is impossible to create something out of nothing. If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given. This is the law of equivalent
928059401470128128 2017-11-07 00:39:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm glad we have 280 characters, but I'm so ready for everyone to make tweets that aren't yelling about how they now have 280 now lmao Don't get me wrong, I'm a 280 enthusiast but yeah I get it we have it now, so let's get to the jokes and memes instead of just yelling haha
928031285569904640 2017-11-07 22:47:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tashalej Is Ned short for Nedward? Led Zeppelin short for Ledward Zeppelin?  I'm only partially sorry
928014814936555523 2017-11-07 21:42:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity everyone and see how dumb it was I needed an extra tweet to write one more word Twitter wyd gimme my 280 characters I have a lot to say
928014691720466433 2017-11-07 21:41:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity ok but why are there still some people who don't have it I don't know the ins and outs of Twitter, but it shouldn't be that hard to give to
928001100145397760 2017-11-07 20:47:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Psst. Hi there. Watch Cowboy Bebop. It's great. Have a good day :Dhttps://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/927979482408824832
927999057683013632 2017-11-07 20:39:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin I wouldn't mind at all! I don't have the money to throw at you, but if watching a harmless ad helps you out then that's great!
927782629021290497 2017-11-06 06:19:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ericalindbeck I am. Are you?
927777149708308480 2017-11-06 05:58:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> g d i  yeah. I do want to. Not today, but soon. I can't believe you'd do this to me
927775622771957760 2017-11-06 05:52:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how long it would take me to rank every version of Super Mario Bros.'s main theme and its underground theme 
927773875299110915 2017-11-06 05:45:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Already made a playlist so tomorrow I can compare all 8 versions of the Kanto Gym Leader theme. Is it bad to plan your procrastination?
927770755949121536 2017-11-06 05:32:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue I have too much free time and enjoy listing things for some reason, thanks for your support haha
927769202534092800 2017-11-06 05:26:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, if you conveniently wanted all 9 versions in one place to listen to them all for yourself, there you gohttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfCRpXRXPTEpFLJC0eMHLpLA5U_7SSvuY
927768593575632901 2017-11-06 05:24:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also turns out it's hard to write about 9 different versions of the same theme when u have no musical expertise, just a guy who likes music
927768347013537794 2017-11-06 05:23:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just because I felt like it, I "reviewed" and ranked all 9 versions of the original Pokmon Champion/Final Rival Battle themepic.twitter.com/3tsnekBFIJ
927763360610963456 2017-11-06 05:03:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Technically remixes his theme but also remixes Red/Lance's theme, so it's not really standalone a remix of Blue's
927763180415221760 2017-11-06 05:02:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm listening to every version of RBY Champion/Final Rival Battle theme to rank them and should I count Sun/Moon's Battle Tree Boss theme?
927629270440136704 2017-11-06 20:10:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Only issue tho: none if it is working lmao
927629178123505664 2017-11-06 20:10:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity On a very basic level, I respect Sega for always trying new things and experimenting, not just doing everything fans want
927622227486564352 2017-11-06 19:42:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Also it's dated Nov 7th, which is tomorrow lmao
927622008367669250 2017-11-06 19:41:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity It's a fake. That's word for word the review and score for Super Mario Odyssey, just changed the words to apply to Sonic
927562905826021377 2017-11-06 15:46:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon THANK YOU CHEESEY I WILL FIGHT ON PLLLLLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ULLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

927513712495341568 2017-11-06 12:31:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 I really like the concept but the 1st ep was boring to me and I kinda don't wanna put more time into an anime I might not like so if-
927376716443652097 2017-11-05 03:26:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's frustrating tho Vegeta will never be stronger than Goku but Vegeta works harder than literally anyone in that show, it's inspiring tbh
927376336565530624 2017-11-05 03:25:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Being a kid is thinking Goku is the coolest DBZ character bc he's the strongest Being an adult is thinking Vegeta is bc he works the hardest

927050812739739649 2017-11-04 05:51:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like, I'm not really doing anything and have little reason to stay up & I could be sleeping but screw sleep I'm staying up you can't beat me
927050367099162624 2017-11-04 05:50:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does anyone else stay up for the sake of doing so, even tho you're not tired but also you don't really have anything to do?
927003645089951744 2017-11-04 02:44:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Original Dragon Ball was freaking wild, it was amazing. In many ways I like it more than DBZ hahaha

926492308832509954 2017-11-03 16:52:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon you need to stop getting your dick stuck in things dude
926480934651809794 2017-11-03 16:07:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby But yeah in his own twisted way, Cyrus was what he thought was good for the world. Cyrus is much more extreme about it I guess
926480804624191493 2017-11-03 16:06:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby -power to actually destroy it. Cyrus fully intended to wipe out everything (and then of course remake it)-
926480471420297216 2017-11-03 16:05:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby That's true, but Maxie & Archie weren't trying to completely destroy the world, just reshape it. They didn't realize the legends had the-
926457591399636993 2017-11-03 14:34:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I doubt Giovanni wants someone like those two on his team, he'd prefer people who are stubborn 'til the end, unwavering in their goals
926457398281363456 2017-11-03 14:33:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> kinda sorta almost destroyed the world. They felt bad about their actions in the end.
926457212041560064 2017-11-03 14:33:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> In ORAS, they were depicted moreso as well intentioned extremists, actually wanted to do good but went about it a crazy way that
926456995183517696 2017-11-03 14:32:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> One reason I think RSE Archie and Maxie were chosen over ORAS ones is because their RSE versions are shown to be more evil than in ORAS
926267194652221440 2017-11-02 01:58:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> This *might* be all the details I've deduced from just this promo art hahaha
926266922274115584 2017-11-02 01:56:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah I didn't even consider levels, but mostly cuz a main game going into the mid-60s has happened before with XY
926266326578065410 2017-11-02 01:54:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Guzma changes his glasses in the Sun/Moon postgame, those normal glasses can be seen in the promo artworkpic.twitter.com/AzxOzNvmq8
926265753782939649 2017-11-02 01:52:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> If we go under the assumption that Guzma's story goes mostly similar, we can deduce that this Rainbow Rocket stuff takes place in postgame
926264198350409728 2017-11-02 01:46:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Apparently in the Sun/Moon after game, after disbanding Team Skull, he gets his lame "normie" glasses:pic.twitter.com/c7DaiRPCXb
926259144994295813 2017-11-02 01:26:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> These details make his character design that much cooler, but interesting that it's never mentioned or even hinted at in the game!
926259032146501633 2017-11-02 01:25:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> According to this concept art Ghetsis apparently got attacked by a Pokmon, injuring his right arm & eye, that's why he wears that eye thingpic.twitter.com/s3wVjP3F52
926258219093250048 2017-11-02 01:22:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> But in the Generations episode, it seems to be fine and functioning
926258118228619264 2017-11-02 01:21:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> The only time we've seen Ghetsis' right arm is in the opening to BW and his episode of Pokmon Generations. Looks disfigured in BWpic.twitter.com/gdWi2afysV
926256847719411712 2017-11-02 01:16:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Small details I really appreciate: Ghetsis' right arm is still concealed. We've only seen it once, I'm like 99% sure it's dead.pic.twitter.com/eUECjL99uo
926252528060297218 2017-11-02 00:59:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LuminaryEmily @FloralSerenity I'm sure it'll all work out, there are lots of ways to make it work and have it make sense
926251888772648960 2017-11-02 00:57:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LuminaryEmily @FloralSerenity But yeah the website doesn't make mention to any remakes, third versions, or B2W2 when describing the villains, an interesting note
926251761895124993 2017-11-02 00:56:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LuminaryEmily @FloralSerenity That's why HE'S DEAD ANY CHARACTER WAS GONE :O :O :O
926251331114979328 2017-11-02 00:55:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LuminaryEmily It's implied on the website this might be DP Cyrus, not Platinum Cyrus but either way yeah that's a very good point
926250947319357440 2017-11-02 00:53:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lysandre probably actually died in XY yet Cyrus is somehow deader than he is what happened to this man
926249387629666304 2017-11-02 00:47:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> The G stands for Gone, the state of his soul
926249076118650880 2017-11-02 00:46:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cyrus is so dead He's done w/everything He prolly literally got dragged into this He just wants a spiritless world This is the deadest manpic.twitter.com/3ziEjp1w4O
926170935769657346 2017-11-02 19:35:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity RSE cuz they grabbed Archie and Maxie from that timeline. Also we don't know the full story of how they're here, gotta play the games haha
926078815620739072 2017-11-02 13:29:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I don't just mean the name itself, I mean the fact that past villains are members, tho the rainbow aesthetic feels fanfic-y too lmao
926078316976787457 2017-11-02 13:27:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Team Rainbow Rocket is hilarious cuz it sounds like something straight from a fan fiction but it's real and it's awesome
926074530564624384 2017-11-02 13:12:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hold up somethign very interesting to note: Maxie and Archie in that trailer resembeled their RSE designs, not their ORAS designs
926072765379174400 2017-11-02 13:05:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why? CUZ ALL OF THEM WILL (hopefully) GET KICKASS REMIXES OF THEIR BOSS THEMES
926072692293423111 2017-11-02 13:05:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> The most important thing to me about the USUM trailer that just dropped is the fact that we can fight the villains again
925958127027212290 2017-11-01 05:29:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Opening up can & will be scary. But if you know peeps you can trust, it's really good You don't gotta feel bad, we all have right 2 complain

925812063032807424 2017-11-01 19:49:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Catchphrase: It's alright now. Why? Because I came back now ya hear?  This was funnier in my head somehow  Also I'm sorry

925789442299834369 2017-11-01 18:19:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm actually a nice guy, a lot of my thoughts/instant judgments can be pretty mean tho, but I avoid talking to people so they'll never know
925787554166820864 2017-11-01 18:12:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Rando: *briefly glances at me* Me in my head: I don't know u why are u looking at me stop don't talk to me I don't care about u or ur existe
925709941377249280 2017-11-01 13:03:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope this becomes a trend in games with long going franchises. Not only enjoyable for fans, but it shows how much the devs care too!
925708651549151232 2017-11-01 12:58:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Throwing in many details & callbacks go a long way in making a game memorable, that much more of a treat, feels rewarding to long time fans
925707337393954816 2017-11-01 12:53:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Even musical callbacks I appreciate, the music during the above clip is 25m from the original Donkey Konghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5drmQRAaes

925705566382587904 2017-11-01 12:46:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Super Mario Odyssey & Dragon Ball FighterZ are both games that go back in their respective franchises & make TONS of references & I love it

925416611384872960 2017-10-31 17:38:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does this even make sense? Probably not but whatever hope y'all are having good days without the bad stuffs, or at least get through the bad
925416452357787648 2017-10-31 17:37:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess what I mean is, depending on how you look at it, on the particular day the bad outweighs the good, but you still feeling good?
925416083149991936 2017-10-31 17:36:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> You ever have parts of a day that are bad or would otherwise make you upset/mad whatever, but you're still in a good mood somehow?

923270025804382211 2017-10-25 19:28:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @Iakustim lmao that isn't their end goal but if you so mad don't buy it. I'll be getting it and thoroughly enjoying it though.
923262220481499136 2017-10-25 18:57:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @Iakustim Lmao good anything comes from meticulous planning and flexibility, it's smarter and better in every way to plan DLC before base is finished
923215966321946626 2017-10-25 15:53:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JeffreyCain8 Biweekly Biweekly Bimonthly Bimonthly Biyearly (twice a week, every two weeks, twice a month, every two months, every two years) works tho
923215558467817472 2017-10-25 15:51:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JeffreyCain8 It'd only be Biweekly Biweekly Bimonthly Biyearly, cuz it can't both be every other month but also only twice a year
923202826016378880 2017-10-25 15:01:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> It'll discuss different things u can do in ur life on a biweekly biweekly bimonthly basis, podcast updated biweekly biweekly bimonthly
923202328165044224 2017-10-25 14:59:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm gonna be starting a new podcast called Biweekly Biweekly Bimonthly Biography: A Biweekly Biweekly Bimonthly Podcast (BBBB: ABBBP)
923197230529597440 2017-10-25 14:39:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue Reply or quote this tweet with what special event or thing you like to do biweekly biweekly bimonthly
923196843613474819 2017-10-25 14:37:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue I also want to note that biweekly biweekly bimonthly is both equal to bimonthly AND more frequent than bimonthly, English is a dumb language
923196430403194885 2017-10-25 14:35:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's been determined that English is a very dumb language (featuring @MrMime_Time and @siilvertongue)pic.twitter.com/6a9CApyij6

923161630183174144 2017-10-25 12:17:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue How are you so cute wtf
923161222463328257 2017-10-25 12:16:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @MoeKazuu I'm not getting CE cuz I can get by without its extras, but I am getting DLC. Even if I was getting CE I'd get DLC.
923160394130186240 2017-10-25 12:12:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @MoeKazuu CE is for figure, art, and other stuff that comes with. Season pass is a separate purchase. If CE had DLC, it'd be even more expensive
923042388972589056 2017-10-24 04:23:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tho I'm no expert on what ACPC brings obvi, cuz I haven't seen the game, or played the game, or play the main games haha
923042034281312256 2017-10-24 04:22:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lemme be clear tho, I'm not trying to trash on ACPC. It's not really doing anything wrong. But, imo, it's not really going beyond I guess
923039443442913281 2017-10-24 04:12:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Of course, I'm speaking way too soon, game isn't even out for a month, but so far, doesn't seem to grab new audiences like FEH did
923038990978158592 2017-10-24 04:10:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> skill inheritance, and other additions and differences that still feel FE, but are unique and cool in their own right.
923038952059174912 2017-10-24 04:10:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is comparing to FE: Heroes, which is bite sized FE with the added twist of the gatcha formula, including special challenges,
923038011591405569 2017-10-24 04:06:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> AC isn't my kind of game, & that's ok. But first impressions: it's ACNL on a phone. Which is ok, but doesn't do anything for someone like me
923037274526437376 2017-10-24 04:03:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Which is fine, to a point. For AC lovers and fans, it's great. Unfortunately, I don't feel like it's as strong of a hook for those who arent
923036947173568512 2017-10-24 04:02:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Without seeing a second of gameplay, I can tell that Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is literally Animal Crossing on a smaller platform
922884483543650304 2017-10-24 17:56:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy That old man is actually a statue, identical to a living old man. I believe he's needed to get a item power up or something
922876891727585280 2017-10-24 17:26:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 oh ok not just me, I have a friend in the mute zone after all!
922804288421814273 2017-10-24 12:37:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I went to sleep after chatting with friends at 2:30, up at 6:30, not even tired. Thought I'd pay for that but turns out sleep is dumb lmao
922663109998923776 2017-10-23 03:16:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @SketchyPyro @these2balls Not every company does that. If you wanna think that way I can't stop you, but try to lighten up a little buddy hahaha
922662335873011718 2017-10-23 03:13:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @SketchyPyro @these2balls Yeah, but it's pretty unlikely to the case, try having some faith. And if you don't like, don't get the DLC, you're not forced to lmao
922623282976907264 2017-10-23 00:38:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @Rinku_Hosoi imo people are being ridiculous and entitled lmao, I'm happy with it and I'm sure many many many more people are too.
922622321642426368 2017-10-23 00:34:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @Rinku_Hosoi That wouldn't have changed development at all. If anything, announcing DLC sooner will get more sales, cuz up the game's lasting interest
922621280595177475 2017-10-23 00:30:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio @Rinku_Hosoi That's not how game development works. Games and characters take time and money to make, especially ones carefully crafted like in this game
922608139484237825 2017-10-23 23:38:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio That's probably because they finish the game first, then start working on DLC, shortly before launch, cuz they still have to release on time
922607289487458305 2017-10-23 23:34:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Frankscotei To enjoy a video game. Wouldn't call it an "agenda", and not even really a goal since it won't be hard for me to enjoy this video game
922605470808006656 2017-10-23 23:27:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio Also, no one said they'll work on DLC before base is done. That's ridiculous, of course it's coming after launch. That's how good DLC works
922605314255523842 2017-10-23 23:27:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS @Silestrio They never said they started working on DLC characters. Yamcha and Tien aren't even done yet, and they're on base game
922605087352082432 2017-10-23 23:26:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS I think people are getting way too up in arms over this. I'm thrilled we'll get even more characters after the game's launch!
922529847125139456 2017-10-23 18:27:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese I can't just not worry about it my dude Also it's ok to take social media break if u feel it'd be good but know that we love and care abt u
922496297667629056 2017-10-23 16:13:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GoodSmile_US @TokyoOtakuMode @Pokemon @anatomyofacake Red is so happy to have that pumpkin, I love it!!
922463301468151808 2017-10-23 14:02:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @siilvertongue Eggnog is really good tho and tbh it's criminal it's only a seasonal drink
922456866411700227 2017-10-23 13:37:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BandaiNamcoUS A lot of people getting worried about price, but just stop & think about it $35 for 8 characters = less than $5 per character. Good deal imo
922118933884407810 2017-10-22 15:14:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @serinide Looking great!!!
921779062187667457 2017-10-21 16:43:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin I love that defiant whisker that's just standing up above the rest.

918258313573404672 2017-10-11 23:33:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @_Firnen have you not seen women with boobs that also have abs and are ripped they exist and they're great
918257527829270528 2017-10-11 23:30:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @_Firnen This is a wrong tweet
918257302364401664 2017-10-11 23:29:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @_Firnen Always
918254814437535744 2017-10-11 23:19:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon But the list is for a significant other to feel for... who...I am...  damn maybe it should be on here, considering, well...
918253384582488065 2017-10-11 23:14:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for Food Wars!, I'm no cook (my best dish is a frozen pizza) but I seriously admire its protagonist and his approach towards challenges
918253034219728896 2017-10-11 23:12:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> In the case of Dragon Ball, I just enjoy its characters a lot and it really was the pioneer in making my favorite tropes in shonen
918252751498424321 2017-10-11 23:11:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not quite similar to my faves list, though I like Death Note and JJBA a lot, can't really relate to its characters as much

918192720065286146 2017-10-11 19:12:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> This week I've been productive and I don't feel like an idiot, not something I can say for the last few weeks, so I'm feeling pretty good rn
918178603371847680 2017-10-11 18:16:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just had a weird moment where I processed something faster than I could think about it. Like answering ur own question before knowing the q
918116286554693632 2017-10-11 14:09:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy @Azurillkirby My username in a worse timeline
918115815043551232 2017-10-11 14:07:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy @Azurillkirby Sweet, I'm at least not the absolute lowest tier, I'll take it
918112997855449088 2017-10-11 13:56:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I feel these are just a few games that are/were a big part of my life and/or helped me realize a lot about myself
918111619615518720 2017-10-11 13:50:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Almost straight from my top 5 games list, but I excluded Persona 3, as I relate to P4 & P5 much more, 4 & 5 are different enough to include

917837401208315904 2017-10-10 19:41:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I will hesitate, a lot, cuz I'm bad. BUT, I think I've been getting better about reaching out, so thank you for being there for me, friend!!
917836743994433547 2017-10-10 19:38:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> It can be scary, but don't be afraid to at least talk to someone else about what you're going through, it can do you so much good
917836606765260800 2017-10-10 19:37:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm super grateful for the support they have given me, & tho I'm not the best I hope I can give that same kind of support to others as well!
917836202388217862 2017-10-10 19:36:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can add tho, I haven't been dealing with my own mental health for very long, but I'm so glad I've had friends to help me through my issues
917834963889917958 2017-10-10 19:31:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't really have a big story for #WorldMentalHealthDay so I hope my many RTs get the idea across that it's ok to not be ok, you're still ok
917798766329192450 2017-10-10 17:07:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 I'm glad you're still here too, and I'm glad your feeling much better!! 
917793144657399808 2017-10-10 16:45:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @funkyobligation There's something that really gets me about Rohan walking Heaven's Door hahahaha. Also every single pose is on point, big mood.

917571821410639873 2017-10-09 02:05:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 let's do it
917568099825668096 2017-10-09 01:50:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 I dunno man, shitposting and failing classes is the way to go, right?  ...right?
917491708912390145 2017-10-09 20:47:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon THIS IS AMAZING CUZ TODOROKI LOOKS SO MAD ABOUT IT
917490650244878338 2017-10-09 20:43:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @anatomyofacake I hope you feel better soon, beat up that sickness real good and take care!!
917490474868527105 2017-10-09 20:42:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Get better soon, Egglet and make sure you PUNCH THAT SICKNESS IN ITS STUPID FACE AND MAKE SURE IT NEVER COMS BACK!!!!FA;SLFKJD;A
917362313384128512 2017-10-09 12:13:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> The difference in animation is insane! Dragon Ball has come a long way.https://twitter.com/ArchedThunder/status/917141861793329152
917189196921663488 2017-10-08 00:45:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Related, Persona 3 FES on Hard difficulty is pretty rough. I'm at the beginning of the game and have gotten 7 Game Overs in the past 1.5 hrs
917188691038298113 2017-10-08 00:43:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 3 just gave me extraordinarily good luck but swiftly took it away from me in one move. I'd rather have just straight poor luck haha
917096012518477824 2017-10-08 18:35:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree This is a good point. So I guess: DEFEAT ONLY THOSE WHO STAND IN YOUR WAY then take a nice nap or relax afterwards.
917049446956883968 2017-10-08 15:30:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you have anything to do on this Sunday, MAKE SURE YOU DESTROY THEM, BECOME NUMBER ONE AND KICK EVERY ASS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geWGTmlVssQ
917033943676915712 2017-10-08 14:28:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @OverwatchCaval Link to cosplayer?
916765959028961280 2017-10-07 20:43:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I think she asks for them, but I have no idea if Female Protag actually has pictures to even sell, that'd be hilarious if she did tho haha
916765723376209921 2017-10-07 20:42:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> In RPGs, I love talking to every NPC I can. So I love that this game in a sense, rewards you for doing so with a look into other NPC's lives
916765386665873408 2017-10-07 20:41:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> She also gets updates in dialogue pretty frequently, unattached to the overall plot
916764705401835520 2017-10-07 20:38:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another, who doesn't get as much development iirc, is this girl who is in love with Mitsuru (a party member); is jealous you hang out w/herpic.twitter.com/kpXguoFLn0
916761589247815681 2017-10-07 20:26:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> They have zero impact on the plot, they don't even get names, but it's a small little thing that really helps bring life to the game
916761346477379584 2017-10-07 20:25:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just about once a week or so these two will have something new to say, a new development in their relationship.
916760739616055296 2017-10-07 20:22:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite little details in Persona 3 are giving unimportant characters small side plots, like this girl stalking another student.pic.twitter.com/OSrYHGxnoE
916524761601191937 2017-10-06 04:45:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> [losing to a tough boss] What game tries to teach: learn new strats, train to get stronger, come back & win Me: changes nothing until I win
916511909909815297 2017-10-06 03:54:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also despite how enticing the new Bowser's Minions looks, not a big fan of some changes made that take away from the original's uniqueness
916511789688467456 2017-10-06 03:53:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've no reason to get the remake as I already have the game on Wii U VC and am content with that.
916511117253410817 2017-10-06 03:50:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also Cackletta's battle theme is pretty sweet too. Now I'm done. Superstar Saga is a good video game with great music. Yeah! :D
916510928203599872 2017-10-06 03:50:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ok, last one kinda but this theme got a great remix, love the use of organ here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScygydVHDs&t=0s
916509752183705601 2017-10-06 03:45:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can't tell if I like the boss theme remix or not. Part of me is thinking YEAH but another says original is betterhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAKhaROUHrw
916508926555885568 2017-10-06 03:42:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> ???
916508477027168256 2017-10-06 03:40:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> AFter checking out a whole 1 theme, my answer is a YES THIS REMIX OF POPPLE'S THEME IS A JAM!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNaI5IQpZuE
916508315873660929 2017-10-06 03:39:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm probably skipping the Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga remake, so at this point my only concern is if the soundtrack is great
916500943339913217 2017-10-06 03:10:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @_Firnen Can confirm
916500691677515777 2017-10-06 03:09:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen @FloralSerenity I feel like I'm supposed to be (jokingly) offended by this, but I can't really say that isn't inaccurate
916367772619337728 2017-10-06 18:21:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp Protagonist facing or staring off against antagonist or rival. Bonus points if it's a group shot of Protag group vs. Antagonist/rival group
916330006422441984 2017-10-06 15:51:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @maggiebuts Merry Birthmas, Maggie! I hope you have a wonderful day, stay awesome!!
916145590567882752 2017-10-05 03:38:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LuckyBonez A really good look!!!!!!
915990675174379520 2017-10-05 17:22:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YaysterArt Anna is extraordinarily greedy and money driven. I'm a cheapskate and think carefully about my purchases. More similar than I expected haha
915934533391929345 2017-10-05 13:39:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tho I can see potential enjoyment in seeing how/where the story/game differs from the first game I guess
915934304982769664 2017-10-05 13:38:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> USUM is seems to greatly be expanding the universe of Pokmon with a brand new plot, vastly different. Just feels a sequel would be better
915934036362764288 2017-10-05 13:37:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like comparing C to GS and Pt to DP, the 3rd versions were the same, with some enhancements or minor plot alterations
915933776634613760 2017-10-05 13:36:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Only thing is that this game looks very different from Sun/Moon, which is good, but I feel it would've been much better as direct sequels
915933312321024002 2017-10-05 13:34:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> lmao ok that new trailer was pretty cool haha Ultra Recon Squad looks cool (especially Soliera) and Ultra Space will actually have meaning
915917723573645312 2017-10-05 12:32:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll probably get more into it when we see more, but my hype is currently on other games like BotW, SMO, and other Switch games
915917171934580736 2017-10-05 12:30:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Which is kinda too bad, as I've gotten every main series game day 1 since Platinum, looks like I'll break a 7 year tradition of mine haha
915916642089127936 2017-10-05 12:28:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Despite enjoying the newest trailer...my hype for USUM is kinda eh unfortunately. I'll get it, but no rush to play (3DS is dead, so can't)
915790028533587969 2017-10-04 04:05:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen do you know how to respond to compliments like no one taught me this. I feel happy too but what u supposed to say or do it's so weird
915728297568489472 2017-10-04 00:00:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reason I bring this up is that judging by the newest USUM trailer, it'd be suuuuper sweet if USUM got an animated trailer
915728168929124352 2017-10-04 23:59:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> ORAS's animated trailer, much like the game itself, paled in comparison lmao
915728042168848385 2017-10-04 23:59:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> B2W2's trailer was amazing, got me really hyped for the game, one of the best marketing things Pokmon has done:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-X03D3tSVU
915727668682752000 2017-10-04 23:57:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> There have been 3, almost 4, main series releases since B2W2 and only B2W2 & ORAS have animated trailers.
915639568107540480 2017-10-04 18:07:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Martymatsu Everyone else go home, this is the best one

915613949437136897 2017-10-04 16:25:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Happy Merry Birthmas, Carmen! I hope you have a wonderfully fantastic day! :D
915612135761285121 2017-10-04 16:18:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu i cAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D EXPOSE ME LIKE THISDF;AJLK
915583893671211008 2017-10-04 14:26:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me when I have a lot of hw: screams about having so much to do Me when I don't have any hw: screams louder that I have nothing to do
915578892194283521 2017-10-04 14:06:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JeffreyCain8 I'm sure they either go for a similar effect one would get from coffee or they just really like soda
915561967288557568 2017-10-04 12:59:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> blessed that I live in the same universe where girls exist. 
915420733039312896 2017-10-03 03:38:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> this game freaking has infinites geez hahahahaha
915419136645267458 2017-10-03 03:31:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> damn that's wild hahaha

915418593432670208 2017-10-03 03:29:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> "before 20" .. ... ...  ...  ...
915389018799525888 2017-10-03 01:32:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I want to love this game so much. Some things make you ask "why" others you're laughing but still asking "why" It's been quite the ride.
915388211735748608 2017-10-03 01:28:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> hahahaahahahahahahahahahhAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHSDHFHSAHHAHEFDHL;AHFAHAhttps://twitter.com/AnAntTM/status/915227187762028545

915264887818989568 2017-10-03 17:18:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's on Crunchyroll in Japanese or English. If you want a great adventure of an anime with wonderful characters, give it a go! #FMADay
915263938882932737 2017-10-03 17:15:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a phenomenal anime, my favorite anime/show of all time. It's amazing #FMADay
915190739591712768 2017-10-03 12:24:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I'm actually quite proud of this tweet so I'm glad you enjoy it!

915064407625011200 2017-10-02 04:02:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen This could mean a lot of things. Wait...this could mean WE are the waifus and husbandos to our waifus and husbandos!!!! :O :O :O
915063897299841024 2017-10-02 04:00:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> So jealous of alternate dimension me, he lives in a blessed world
915063612263337984 2017-10-02 03:59:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> In an alternate universe, all of our favorite anime waifus and husbandos are real people & saddest thing is that we're not in that universe.
914988049184018433 2017-10-02 22:58:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tashalej I'm pretty sure this is actually the path he'd want us to take
914512407682306048 2017-10-01 15:28:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Somehow still surprised how much so many people love the month of October. People are just absolutely fascinated by it, it's interesting

914216869468483584 2017-09-30 19:54:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree @Seven_Cubed You'd think, but I actually saw the tweet very shortly before Carmen tweeted. I very much appreciate the near immediate ping tho.

913964394555600896 2017-09-29 03:11:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar EXPERIENCE
913964238405799936 2017-09-29 03:10:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar The paper is closer and it's easier to grab
913960886611599360 2017-09-29 02:57:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar ONLY VILLAINS, JOE
913937915771842560 2017-09-29 01:25:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> when you're so inept at cooking, you have to Google how to make scrambled eggs
913757654421557248 2017-09-29 13:29:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah but not that much, he is much more in the second season tho
913756784376057858 2017-09-29 13:26:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I haven't seen the English dub of My Hero Academia, but I'm pretty sure no says "Okey dokey, Todoroki" to Todoroki & honestly that's too bad
913740390607593473 2017-09-29 12:21:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I wish I could apologize to my programmer. But if I could meet him in the first place I feel that cause a lot of issues.
913643010453209088 2017-09-28 05:54:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not just important NPCs, *all*. Even the randos. Imagine being specifically tasked with writing lines few people will see or even care about
913641788384075776 2017-09-28 05:49:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Shoutout to the original writers & the localizers for all Pokmon games who writes victory quotes for every NPC if you lose to them.
913602852362215429 2017-09-28 03:14:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's just always sooooooo gooooood
913602213229993984 2017-09-28 03:11:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Best part of this scene is when Tom smacks with the newspaper, it's a lil slap noise but when Spike does it the sound is a freaking gunshothttps://twitter.com/BoomerangToons/status/913505958273388546
913551300050116608 2017-09-28 23:49:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree gaaah;afwe;jasdflkjaelkfj;sld ;than;K;S ;;YOU CARMEN But yes, I'll take people's hearts and with the power of One For All none shall stop me
913549115480346624 2017-09-28 23:40:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu @GirafarigTree 1. puh lease my IVs are like decent, like a 17 at best 2. I SHOULD GET A MASK THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA
913547655246004224 2017-09-28 23:35:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu And even if I did tweet it, I'd slap an emoji on my face, sorry no face reveal for you. You're not missing anything good tho
913546982676770816 2017-09-28 23:32:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu I actually took one but I decided it didn't show the hat off well enough, which was the purpose of the tweet, so I decided not to use it
913546526395293696 2017-09-28 23:30:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> If curious, I got this from Amazon, but you can also find it on the Crunchyroll store!
913546355728977920 2017-09-28 23:29:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's alright now. Why? BECAUSE MY ALL MIGHT HAT IS HERE!!!!!!!!! Now All Might can stand in blinding light to give me shade, thanks buddy.pic.twitter.com/dsB0w7xcDa
913537504313196544 2017-09-28 22:54:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I try not to waste time
913537201916362753 2017-09-28 22:53:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Congrats Nich!
913442524416679937 2017-09-28 16:37:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> AAAAAHHHHHHH I'M SO GLAD MY HERO ACADEMIA GOT AN IMMEDIATE SEASON 3 ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!!
913376914420715520 2017-09-28 12:16:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I was actually surprised when I heard/thought she wasn't, she's not the most important character in the franchise but definitely a mainstay
913375086173966336 2017-09-28 12:09:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity MY GIRL 
913032985045340160 2017-09-27 13:30:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> My Hero Academia ends for the season this week, but Shokugeki no Soma returns next week, super excited for both!! I love anime!  :D :D :D
912906705968730112 2017-09-26 05:08:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie The way I see it, if someone pulls something like that, most people prolly already knew they thought that way & would've done that w/o edit
912906452867706880 2017-09-26 05:07:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I see tons of people use this "counterexample" and like, come onnnn, how many people are srsly gonna make a meme then change to some bs
912905688145416193 2017-09-26 05:04:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie so this changes nothing. Also, this tweet wouldn't be necessary w/280 characters so that's obvious this adds convenience
912905471626969088 2017-09-26 05:03:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I don't get why so many are freaking about this, yes shitty people can say more w/more characters but they could also make a second tweet-
912861743759728641 2017-09-26 02:09:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Doubling the character limit is great cuz while many funny tweets used limit, this opens the way to more comedic tweets without worrying abo
912853069670621185 2017-09-26 01:35:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar HOW? The change is that you can type double in a single tweet, that's it. I get some are afraid of change, but seriously freaking like this?
912852503800238080 2017-09-26 01:32:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I don't get the freak outs either, imo this can only be good
912802391266877441 2017-09-26 22:13:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nice, Twitter finally bumped the character limit, something they should've done years ago lmao
912764341837017089 2017-09-26 19:42:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Rooting for you all the way, buddy!
912731967027900416 2017-09-26 17:33:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Isn't out in Japan until the 28th (so tomorrow our time). Either way, we'll prolly know by the end of the week
912731097519271936 2017-09-26 17:30:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Do you know where this footage is coming from cuz I'm not sure on that either. They'll probably be playable, not sure if DLC tho
912502437633806336 2017-09-25 02:21:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp Only bite it early if the bottom is already broken and ice cream is leaking out. Otherwise, save it for last like someone who isn't alien
912492054923661312 2017-09-25 01:40:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> someone save this woman what has Capcom done to her
912463527641743362 2017-09-25 23:47:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Of course, Bakugo's traits are much more apparent & I'm not a jerk like he is, but it's not something I've considered before
912462479673917442 2017-09-25 23:43:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's really interesting to relate to Bakugo for the same reasons others dislike him. Would those ppl dislike me for the same reasons?
912461508034088961 2017-09-25 23:39:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> His pride issues, inferiority superiority complex (big ego to cover insecurities), & dismissiveness to others, all things I deal with/do
912452836981641217 2017-09-25 23:04:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Relating to and really liking Bakugo from MHA is interesting because he's understandably unlikable in many ways and many people dislike himpic.twitter.com/3qyz1kKJAx
912446717152387072 2017-09-25 22:40:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar yep that's what I thought lmao
912446565633204226 2017-09-25 22:39:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar wait who's getting benched whoever it is, tbh you're probably right lmao
912436001284526083 2017-09-25 21:57:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen IS SHE OK TBH I'M REALLY CONCERNED
912430775173304320 2017-09-25 21:37:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> This so called "sleepwear" is ridiculous but sidenote WHY ARE CHUN-LI'S HANDS SO HUGE SHE CAN COVER HER ENTIRE FACE CAPCOM WHYhttps://twitter.com/euthanasian/status/912400943190204416
912383391382872066 2017-09-25 18:28:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon damn
912383219777114114 2017-09-25 18:28:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @CheeseyPokemon I'm glad you understand thanks dude
912382933645893633 2017-09-25 18:26:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon This happened before that tho and for context the tweet was a meme not straight porn
912382488672182274 2017-09-25 18:25:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @CheeseyPokemon LOOK MAN IT WASN'T OBVIOUS TO ME AS IT WAS TO...I guess...everyone else.
912378378963111937 2017-09-25 18:08:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Listen  It's not that bad/often...right? I at least never like porn porn (which does get on my tl via other ppl, before anyone asks)
912349333999247361 2017-09-25 16:13:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ Happy birthday Razzle Dazzle, I hope you have a wonderful day!! Stay awesome! :D
912295205008809985 2017-09-25 12:38:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> OUR TIME HAS COMEhttps://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/912239485995356160
912116156751912960 2017-09-24 00:46:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Definitely thinking cream puff. Which works excellently since he's a puff ball!
912115197648801792 2017-09-24 00:43:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kirby would definitely have a sweet flavor, right? Not like bubblegum or cotton candy even tho he's pink, but some sort of sweet flavorhttps://twitter.com/SarahRealm7/status/907113251325874176
912094121724084224 2017-09-24 23:19:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm happy that you're happy and healthy :D
911974130320396289 2017-09-24 15:22:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> This'll be tough for me cuz RPGs (P5) and platformers (SMO) are my two favorite genres haha. Feels P5 no contenst but SMO looks REALLY GOOD
911973819040124928 2017-09-24 15:21:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Persona 5 is Game of the Year, easy, what can come close? Super Mario Odyssey: *exists*  Hmm this might be tough
911970341634920448 2017-09-24 15:07:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah completely separate from game design choices, that's just poor choice in time, even if the game looked great, most would choose Mario
911967027870552064 2017-09-24 14:54:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity It's disappointing cuz Warriors is a great fit for the FE series and after enjoying Hyrule Warriors I was looking forward to this one
911961527288295424 2017-09-24 14:32:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Yeah I get that and FE Heroes did the same at first but FEH has more characters. With FEW it's just getting ridiculous.
911960529006194688 2017-09-24 14:28:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> FEH has characters from Tharcia 776, a game few Western players haven even heard of. With FEW I feel we're lucky getting Lyn, a fan favorite
911960084250595330 2017-09-24 14:26:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> in the same way Heroes has so well.
911959605206556673 2017-09-24 14:24:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> I yell about FEW a lot but I really enjoyed FE Awakening & Heroes (only ones I've  played haha) and I really want FEW to honor the franchise
911955756127260672 2017-09-24 14:09:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> So yeah in a roundabout way thanks for making me not want one of my favorite characters
911955506889199617 2017-09-24 14:08:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Even tho Tharja is the 1 I want to play as most, I don't want her as much cuz I'd rather pay DLC for heroes from OTHER GAMES THIS ISNT HARD
911954200405450752 2017-09-24 14:03:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Hopefully DLC will have heroes from other ga- "DID SOMEONE SAY HEROES FROM THE SAME OF COURSE YOU WHY WOULD YOU ASK FOR ANYTHING ELSE??"https://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/911869575188307968
911953533150384128 2017-09-24 14:00:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby You didn't say "a pretty gr8 year" and I'm kinda disappointed
911789916199227392 2017-09-23 03:10:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Consider Bisky considered.

911760034526265344 2017-09-23 01:11:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> My Hero Academia is definitely up there in my top 5 favorite anime of all time now, I've been thinking about its characters daily, so good!
911742996235866112 2017-09-23 00:04:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen "changed his mind" ... ... ... WOW I'M SO GLAD HE CHANGED HIS MIND, WE'RE ALL SAVED NOW RIGHT??/;AWFEJ482WOJFL;AD
911719054427246594 2017-09-23 22:28:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity get that Leo away from every girl omg what is that
911718529380085761 2017-09-23 22:26:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Mont-eye-n
911607298279247872 2017-09-23 15:04:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity All 3 have their new ones from Heroes (for Lucina, Laura Bailey for first one, Alexis Tipton for other three), but I guess I'm used to those
911604807097516037 2017-09-23 14:54:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity A lot of ppl are saying voice acting sounds bad but it sounds just fine to me? Same VAs from Awakening, Fates, & Heroes, right? Good VAs
911462430114553857 2017-09-22 05:29:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AT1ST No he's most definitely right handed. Writes with right, pulls out phone with right, rips off mask with right, etc.
911270487933808641 2017-09-22 16:46:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PressL2P I get this reference and appreciate it very much!
911227567570604035 2017-09-22 13:55:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> By "gameplay gameplay", I mean not like random or new areas like in a prior trailer, but like telling us what's in the game
911227292394954752 2017-09-22 13:54:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Mantine Surfing looks neat in USUM but tbh I'm just glad we're seeing more new gameplay mechanics/gameplay gameplay
911226315864502273 2017-09-22 13:50:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Knows next to nothing about a game = game has nothing I don't get how you could get to this conclusion
911211780680114176 2017-09-22 12:53:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> These replica clothes are great looking, I'd love to have some  If only I had like $200 to drop on one tho hahahahttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/911153444760834048
911099827563356162 2017-09-21 05:28:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> more cheapskate/skewed priorities culture is debating skipping 4 days of lunch to save $30 so you can get this salehttps://twitter.com/videogamedeals/status/911094736999538688
911075345943744512 2017-09-21 03:51:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbf tho, it's the game that's shown off the most, since the beta was playable the past weekend, but it looks soo fun and I like DB a lot
911072195232911360 2017-09-21 03:38:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Out of the games coming out in 2018, #DragonBallFighterZ might be the one I'm most excited for, surprising to me cuz great stuff is coming
911070487475818496 2017-09-21 03:31:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry YO THIS IS FREAKING ADORABLE
911032044704161792 2017-09-21 00:59:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity But it'd be much better if it was like "here's a bit from 5 FE games, DLC from all 5" rather than "here's just 2, pay extra for the other 3"
911031650137624577 2017-09-21 00:57:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity FEW DLC will have peeps from non-Fates/Awakening, making ppl feel like they have to pay for their faves, which isn't inherently bad on paper
911031171601063937 2017-09-21 00:55:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I really don't like the idea of 1/3rd of the roster as DLC (I skipped out on HW's DLC) but this gives hope we'll get more rounded out roster
911030600089337856 2017-09-21 00:53:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity So if true to their word, we can expect to see at least 30 characters. FEW currently has 22 characters, not including any possible leaks
911029995593756672 2017-09-21 00:50:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Note Fist of the North Star is oldest at Dec 2012 release, while All-Stars came out March this year, just in case release time matters to u
911029799283494914 2017-09-21 00:50:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not fully sure, but after rapid Googling, this is what I found of just a couple Warriors crossoverspic.twitter.com/9zuMzZXOqq
911026762619990019 2017-09-21 00:38:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hopefully the series representation will balance out over rest of the series & early marketing just wasn't great w/Fates & Awakening focus
911026436739387392 2017-09-21 00:36:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Apparently FEW will have a larger roster than any crossover Warriors game thus far, which is kinda good news? [Source: Fire Emblem Wiki]

910319081613664256 2017-09-19 01:45:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> And yes, I counted, there are 48 missions where you collect 100 coins across 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, and Galaxy 2.
910318777715355649 2017-09-19 01:44:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Similar to Mario Party The Top 100, there should be a 3D Mario platformer collection except it's just 100 coin stars Super Mario 4,800 Coins
910316488694882305 2017-09-19 01:35:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @_Firnen How much are clown costumes
910315723628716038 2017-09-19 01:32:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin imo, just go where you'll have fun. If you wanna go to Disney World then go to Disney World!

910302467027587072 2017-09-19 00:39:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon you just eat it out
910243192217448453 2017-09-19 20:44:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I forgot this, gomen. I'll try eating them tho
910242276353470464 2017-09-19 20:40:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Not but like my friend wanna blend the pineapple smell with the rest of the stuff but without blending the pineapple
910234084986802177 2017-09-19 20:08:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Can u safely blend walnuts, peanuts, & coconut shells, asking for a friend also how can u leave the scent of, say a pineapple, w/o using it.
910231717423849474 2017-09-19 19:58:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Best part is that they essentially gave us a half week warning like "oh btw were all gonna die" how dumb do they think people are
910227780994035713 2017-09-19 19:43:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, they already made a 3rd Sonic Adventure game What do you mean "no", it came out in 2006 and they called it "Sonic the Hedgehog"!
910193439928717312 2017-09-19 17:26:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Like how HGSS is still a great remake. Mainly, I want GF to make DP remakes cuz they can do cool new things, not just cuz people want them
910193291383230465 2017-09-19 17:26:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not bad at all. I feel GF will do it anyway cuz it's formula at this point, but I hope they can innovate/add new things to make them fresh
910193109597917184 2017-09-19 17:25:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think for anyone who creates content,  creator should aim to create a product they're proud of, not just to please people
910192638783033351 2017-09-19 17:23:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Devs should work to advance and evolve their creations, not just churn out a game to appease the fanbase
910192604033224704 2017-09-19 17:23:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I agree with this statement 100%, and not just because I don't think Sonic Adventure games are good.https://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/910191256965394438
909858194507345923 2017-09-18 19:14:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why It's technically still summer What is happening
909853884239069184 2017-09-18 18:57:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just saw people setting up Christmas lights on some trees on the road. ... ... ... ...  My dudes  It's September
909810687693787136 2017-09-18 16:05:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> That I have no idea on, might need to do some research on that one
909810296130297856 2017-09-18 16:04:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> No glitches are ever fixed in VC releases, yes
909646100977651713 2017-09-17 05:11:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> appreciate a lot more now. If you saw each full panel without text, you could still figure out how they're feeling pretty easily, it's great
909646000175894528 2017-09-17 05:11:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Without voice or animation in manga, every face you make has to very clearly portray the character's emotions and thoughts, something I
909645064581861378 2017-09-17 05:07:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's something about the way faces are drawn in Pokmon Adventures that I will always appreciate. Intensity of every scene is amplified.pic.twitter.com/T9YD8lfbp1
909608516133978112 2017-09-17 02:42:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I'm not completely opposed to it, will just need getting used to I think. Makes me appreciate Smash Bros.' simplicity tho.
909608211057074176 2017-09-17 02:41:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I worry that I won't get into it, cuz I couldn't fully get into the quarter-circle style action that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax has
909600457361969153 2017-09-17 02:10:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> After seeing some of the beta in action, definitely want DBFZ now, even tho not the biggest on fighting games also IT LOOKS SO FREAKING GOODhttps://twitter.com/mansa1228/status/909147023592394753

909489170409762816 2017-09-17 18:48:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> One thing I really hope Super Mario Odyssey brings back is the Mad Piano. Mad Piano was great, shame it hasn't made a big reappearancepic.twitter.com/gsu0LDP4Sc

909411060532342784 2017-09-17 13:37:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> My favorite part of the "You've heard of Elf on the Shelf" meme is that I've never heard of Elf on the Shelf.

908136356106436609 2017-09-13 01:12:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 You do not need to play any past games to enjoy Persona 5, you'll miss a few minor callbacks, but nothing integral to the plot
908118420163571712 2017-09-13 00:01:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I dunno, just feel it's a bit disappointing to go back to selling a slightly altered game again, really hope that's not the full case here
908115677659136000 2017-09-13 23:50:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar My issue is that I thought we were past that and done with. I still don't think we've seen enough to conclude it's like that, kinda seems so
908114545482371072 2017-09-13 23:45:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity ah k, wasn't sure, sorry if came off as aggressive (not the word, but you know what I mean I think  lmao tho the physics are laughable
908114249293160448 2017-09-13 23:44:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Are the (bad) boob physics really that big a deal?

908103369843191809 2017-09-13 23:01:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I get people are upset about no AC Switch announcement, but really I thought it was obvious we wouldn't see it. Hold out for December maybe
908102945534816256 2017-09-13 22:59:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh, Mario Party Top 100 whatever it was called is gonna be cool too, definitely did not expect that hahaha

908087832476090369 2017-09-13 21:59:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's nice to see so many people you know (use "know" loosely) share a common interest and excitement!

908032355587239948 2017-09-13 18:19:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick I know that's technically not true, but I just mainly wanna know what's different, why should I buy USUM.
908032121838718977 2017-09-13 18:18:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick I'm glad they're not spoiling, but at the same time I wanna know at least something. Feels like we know the same now as when it was revealed
907999908606738432 2017-09-13 16:10:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also inspires/reminds me that I want to make remixes, still do, I should stop saying "I want" & just do it already lmao, have a ton of ideas
907999502921068546 2017-09-13 16:08:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> This remixer, DJtheS, is fantastic and makes tons of awesome music, listen to his work daily, so check him out if you need some jams!
907999056626155521 2017-09-13 16:06:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> This has been my J A M, recommend you give it a listen. A meme-y/strange combo, but one that works spectacularlyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcpF1ddE6zM
907970723062394881 2017-09-13 14:14:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Direct Day, excite day! Nintendo Direct is a good motivator for me to work hard today so I can relax and have fun with that this evening!
907798071043674112 2017-09-12 02:48:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, I really like the trend of Japanese music videos all taking place in random warehouses hahaha
907796759233093633 2017-09-12 02:43:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> This vid is for "THE DAY" by Porno Graffitti (top tier band name), first OP for My Hero Academia and it's sooooo coooool
907796568769736704 2017-09-12 02:42:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> New fave thing: watching the official music videos of my fave anime OPs/EDs, cuz Japanese music videos are SO COOLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wR7Iqhn4wc&feature=youtu.be
907651346635075586 2017-09-12 17:05:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Drawing sounds better on Wii than on PS4, but maybe I'll prefer it somehow? It was a hit before the Wii release, so I'm sure it works well
907651162328969216 2017-09-12 17:04:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thinking of getting Okami HD for PS4. It's a cool game I've wanted to play, but couldn't get into the Wii release
907639299088293888 2017-09-12 16:17:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also at school I don't like talking to people cuz I'm an antisocial ass oops haha
907639193714790400 2017-09-12 16:17:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I think we've all silently agreed to never talk to each other again? lmao I don't hate them but they weren't super close friends?
907639005533089792 2017-09-12 16:16:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> The plot hardens I remember another one of their names but I'm very sure all three of them have looked directly at me and said nothing
907600483749171202 2017-09-12 13:43:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm proud of you

907411400829566978 2017-09-11 01:11:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon nice
907393107733467136 2017-09-11 23:59:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> All fandoms are bad.  EXCEPT the Kirby fandom. It's a quiet one, but a good fandom. It's nice.
907249199640662016 2017-09-11 14:27:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Direct time, excite time!~
907099301729402880 2017-09-10 04:31:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm just impressed a GBA could produce this. imo working great with what they had
907099158837854208 2017-09-10 04:31:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know I just said ORAS's is better, but let's appreciate the original. The bass The french horns The claps So gooodhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaUQM4TC9wg&t=1s
907098788883521536 2017-09-10 04:29:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's a tall order my friend. Not impossible, but not easy goal to meet haha
907098082835353600 2017-09-10 04:26:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> hey look I finally found something good to say about ORAS lmao. But really if you need some jams, any battle theme from ORAS & you're set 
907097564134211590 2017-09-10 04:24:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hoenn games have a great soundtrack, but RSE did non-battle themes better, however ORAS did battle themes excellently!!
907096042864353282 2017-09-10 04:18:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Took me too long to realize what it meant for a Ghost type to run away from you  ohno

906921301134204928 2017-09-10 16:44:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Dang that looks so cool I didn't think US would get something like this!
906698111262883840 2017-09-09 01:57:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Palkia wants more hug, written all over their face. Tho to be fair, Dialga's not really putting in the effort
906697605673091072 2017-09-09 01:55:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I like to imagine Palkia is whispering sweetly into Dialga's ear while awkwardly debating on going for the hug
906676930187026432 2017-09-09 00:33:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I actually didn't realize they were flipped and now that's even more disgusting a summon dang
906676472814989312 2017-09-09 00:31:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen My face actually scrunched up seeing this.
906589202577596416 2017-09-09 18:44:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar SWEET they have 9 eyes naice, I like it!
906325144938958848 2017-09-08 01:15:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> who the hell "waits for the pizza to cool off" you gotta go in it's pizza
906311591368560640 2017-09-08 00:21:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon That's happened to me too and the convo ended with me still having no idea who they were. huh I never figured that out lmao
906308904371486721 2017-09-08 00:10:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> The plot thickens not one but 3 people from high school are in one of my classes, I remember one of their names but not which one they are
906217022194843649 2017-09-08 18:05:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar m    y D       U               D             E
906186360314322945 2017-09-08 16:03:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Feel this pretty hard, you're not alone on this don't worry about that.
906184636346322944 2017-09-08 15:57:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I'm not a professional writer hahaha
906184529576157184 2017-09-08 15:56:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> lmao Issei is the freaking protag and I forgot about him for a sec. But yeah tournament specifically for ecchi is hard to come up with
906183575527186432 2017-09-08 15:52:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ecchi is usually paired up with another genre, so I guess it depends on that other genre, but a good enough writer can make it work hahaha
906183440420261888 2017-09-08 15:52:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Keijo!!!!!!!! had a tournament arc, tho Keijo is a sports anime so that helps, so it can happen. High School DxD too, but that's shonen
906157529859854336 2017-09-08 14:09:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu Detectives compete with protag to catch the murderer OR the murderer toys with detectives in a tournament style. Easy.
906157005689237505 2017-09-08 14:07:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Slice of life? Horror? Ecchi? Comedy? Sci-Fi  Give 'em all tournament arcs. Cuz they're the best. Somehow it'd work in all of them
906156423373082624 2017-09-08 14:05:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Think of any anime, mostly if they aren't shounen. They can be made much more awesome if they had a tournament arc. Doesn't matter the genre

905949562107461633 2017-09-07 00:23:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my fave things about MHA's cast are the lil details each character gets. Almost every one has a little quirk (heh) like this.https://twitter.com/diorsasuke/status/905705839746584576
905932765715206144 2017-09-07 23:16:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Halloween costumes used to be cool until I discovered cosplaying and now Halloween costumes are really underwhelming in comparison hahaha
905832774749310982 2017-09-07 16:38:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JeffreyCain8 I actually found a Target cart at my store once, nearest one was like a 10 min drive/hour long walk lmao
905797807952539648 2017-09-07 14:20:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> As someone who pulled carts for a summer this infuriates me pls don't be anything that isn't Lawful Good or Neutral Good or I'll end you. https://twitter.com/Beschizza/status/905435905242144769

905655304343306240 2017-09-06 04:53:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @eagle8burger @kimiwathotdesu @TheMindFunker Best part is that in Shokugeki no Soma, Kurokiba Ryo shares the same VA as Bakugo and Kurokiba is basically Bakugo if he was a chef
905588071558778880 2017-09-06 00:26:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I think I'll save that for another time haha
905588042152497152 2017-09-06 00:26:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Got more answers than I thought, might do this more often haha. Curious on how people, especially women, feel about sexualization in general
905587540824084484 2017-09-06 00:24:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Flawed reasons are funny in a bad way, but overall thought it was a good discussion!
905587342987206657 2017-09-06 00:23:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Enjoyed this discussion, got both understandable answers (personality, overstated sexuality) and flawed reasons (she's why new FE is bad)
905578505055989761 2017-09-06 23:48:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity But I can definitely see how some people aren't a fan at all, she can very easily come off as offputting/creepy/just wanna get away from her
905578363863142401 2017-09-06 23:48:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity lmao this woman sounds pretty mentally unhinged saying stuff like that and meaning it. That to me makes her interesting, but might just b me
905577851906379776 2017-09-06 23:45:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity I see your point there, it's better I guess just to let it be rather than bring all attention to it, but I guess that's the joke?
905577218528739329 2017-09-06 23:43:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity more detailed than she actually is?
905577198261870592 2017-09-06 23:43:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity And it's hard for me to judge this cuz I haven't played Fates, but maybe I'm giving Fates' writing more credit and thinking Camilla is
905576989431660544 2017-09-06 23:42:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity For example, people may like Ursula cuz she's sexy, but she's also an assassin. Camilla doesn't have as much to go on as a bland character
905576938567237632 2017-09-06 23:42:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah the whole "sexy big sister thing" is pretty offputting, but I feel like saying ppl only like her cuz sexy is an overgeneralization
905576155704643584 2017-09-06 23:39:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen And I guess that's my main issue haha
905576115422429185 2017-09-06 23:39:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen Haven't played Fates, but from what I've gathered all overall poorly written, but I never see hate for anyone besides Camilla
905575706633097218 2017-09-06 23:37:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity the franchise. Awakening/Fates upped the fanservice via summer DLC types, but normal "fanservice" characters? doesn't seem changed
905575686563405825 2017-09-06 23:37:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity From what I've gathered from Heroes, overall amount of "sexualized" characters like Camillia, Sonia, Ursula etc., seems normal throughout
905574927511773184 2017-09-06 23:34:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity obvi may just be me tho, but even then still don't think it justifies *hating* her
905574908280930304 2017-09-06 23:34:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I can see how her caring makes her very flawed, fine, my main issue I guess is hating her because she's sexual, cuz imo that isn't a bad
905574335733215233 2017-09-06 23:32:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd See I thought about this, but none of those have to do with her character, just salty over diff things. Feel that's flawed reasoning haha
905573566539862016 2017-09-06 23:28:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen "everything wrong" lmao old vs. new FE is a separate topic I can't weigh in much on but I know that statement is far from true haha
905572085371719682 2017-09-06 23:23:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Made a post asking/postulating why people hate Camilla, read if interested, especially if you don't like Camilla, curious on your thoughts
905571631434739713 2017-09-06 23:21:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fire Emblem's Camilla: Why the Hate?  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1sq5s3s
905440443902689282 2017-09-06 14:39:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Will write a more organized/detailed question Twitlonger about this later but still overall curious on why people feel the way they do
905440173617545219 2017-09-06 14:38:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> sexualized? Tons of characters in lots of stuff are sexualized, so why specifically hate her so much?
905440124925870080 2017-09-06 14:38:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> From what I gather, Fire Emblem's Camilla isn't a well written character, but harmless otherwise, do ppl really hate her so much cuz she'spic.twitter.com/ZxE2rg2UK8
905247774177976320 2017-09-05 01:54:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> So yeah don't uninstall FE Heroes or else you apparently won't be able to redownload it and play again
905247542463664129 2017-09-05 01:53:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> But in thinking about it, the issue is downloading the updates, which isn't working, so that actually won't really do anything
905247402059321349 2017-09-05 01:52:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Will probably try until next update which is soon? to keep trying to download FE Heroes, otherwise I'll just delete my data & start over :/

904854302237351936 2017-09-04 23:50:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Should've just said disabled capturing, not overall functionality. That's definitely what they meant but just didn't write it tht way
904849369823932420 2017-09-04 23:31:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie While I will say that's a funny way to get out of doing something, doesn't seem super spectacular, but again haven't seen it so not 100%sure
904848408950837249 2017-09-04 23:27:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Is the joke that he turned himself into a Pickle or is there more to it? Don't watch the show so not fully sure but that's all I've gathered

904554155171348480 2017-09-03 03:58:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KaiserNeko I don't think so, but I've seen the idea that Aizawa can't disable a mutation type Quirk, not sure on that myself though.

904002706901225472 2017-09-02 15:26:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Neat idea for a LoZ OoT OVA: Showing Ganondorf's 7 year takeover of Hyrule & how the kingdom and Link's friends dealt w/drastic changes
903981711234666497 2017-09-02 14:03:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Clair is scary tbh you can throw her in fights against Pokmon and she'd come out the victor.
903979072883015680 2017-09-02 13:53:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's a fave Pokmon type thing going around but I already did that but better so if you care here it is.pic.twitter.com/qxa1Kfng2r
903976225793863680 2017-09-02 13:41:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lucina, Chrom, and Tharja lost, h o w
903762332215644160 2017-09-01 23:31:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hope you have fun!
903664144796274691 2017-09-01 17:01:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I've done pretty much anything I can think of to get the download to complete and nothing has worked. May prolly still try again later tho
903662538562433025 2017-09-01 16:55:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Can someone tell me when the next FE Heroes update is? I might just have to wait until then to try downloading the game.
903650801863860224 2017-09-01 16:08:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's frustrating cuz I wanna get back into this game again but I haven't found much of a solution other than "just keep trying"
903647958784200704 2017-09-01 15:57:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, on and off Wi-Fi, clear and not clearing cache and nothing has worked
903647721436971008 2017-09-01 15:56:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Trying to redownload FE Heroes and I keep getting this error at 89% or it just never gets past 91%, anyone know a fix?pic.twitter.com/LvyDR7iGLM
903481745927897089 2017-08-31 04:56:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> (by no one I mean in-universe)
903481703066329089 2017-08-31 04:56:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Teen Titans always went out in public off duty in costume. like going to a dance or getting pizza and almost no one points that out why
903433168786771968 2017-08-31 01:43:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity are you telling me the force of nature that is Hector is freaking 17
903426930132885504 2017-08-31 01:18:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Trying to redownload FE Heroes but having issues, in the mean time please support #TeamTharja in my stead please and thank you
903423561972535298 2017-08-31 01:05:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity More accurate comparison would be Nintendo and Monolith Soft, creators of the Xeno series
903423411900297216 2017-08-31 01:05:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Similar relationship, but technically different, as Game Freak is second party to Nintendo I think?
903422487786131456 2017-08-31 01:01:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Atlus is actually a subsidiary of Sega. Essentially means they own Atlus, tho Atlus still devs their own games.
903364630361382913 2017-08-31 21:11:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Don't impulse buy it. Slow down, think carefully, and come to the unimpulsive, rational decision, that you must buy it.  O-Or don't maybe
903364173282910210 2017-08-31 21:09:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Who's says there'll only be two this time?
903308305841487872 2017-08-31 17:27:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Ryuk was great, but he doesn't get to do much and most of the time you see him he's in shadows so you barely get to see him
903051084482142210 2017-08-30 00:25:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I beat Jak 1 yesterday and tried to play Jak 2 which, as a kid, I didn't like and I learned/remembered Jak 2 is r e a l l y b o r i n g
903049951592288256 2017-08-30 00:21:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> by "unplayable" I mean my 3DS is basically dead and I don't have a TV I can play my Switch on (I know I can play it undocked, I'd prefer TV)
903049731919814661 2017-08-30 00:20:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> In an obnoxious mood where the only games I want to play are either games I can't afford, on consoles that are currently unplayable, or both
902936184321691648 2017-08-30 16:48:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> YOU CAN FIGHT THROUGH IT I BELIEVE IN YOU PUNCH ALL YOUR CHALLENGES ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS EAT EGGS YOU GOT THIS!!!
902928140175122435 2017-08-30 16:16:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar REALLY SAD LMAO
902927924030033923 2017-08-30 16:16:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar draw them really buff
902737949258915840 2017-08-29 03:41:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Speedrunning, conceptually, is pretty rad. But doing them myself is not for me. Please understand, o mighty speedrun illuminati
902737645436108802 2017-08-29 03:40:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not sure you've made a better tweet than "peel" tbh #relatablecontent
902737170913517568 2017-08-29 03:38:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> dang. you're not wrong tho.  I actually briefly considered doing a casual speedrun of it, but I don't like speedrunning oops haha
902736940818206720 2017-08-29 03:37:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> what you think you doin' come at me
902736829543313409 2017-08-29 03:36:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> lmao I dunno about 100% but the speedrun for any% is like half an hour haha. It'd take me like 3-4 hours for any% probably
902736590451216384 2017-08-29 03:35:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll finally take the time to try and play through all of Jak 2 tho. I never liked it cuz it's nothing like its prequel but eh, why not
902736346841845760 2017-08-29 03:34:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> lmao I know this game really well cuz I've beaten it 100% already. Took no more than about 7 hours total haha.
902714718611263488 2017-08-29 02:08:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I stopped playing Heroes in May and I'm planning to get back in But seeing this brought back memories  I'm not sure anymore
902711865775718400 2017-08-29 01:57:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> this isn't over
902696345877831682 2017-08-29 00:55:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I like chocolate, but there are better chocolates than M&Ms Also Skittles are *really* good
902696064645570562 2017-08-29 00:54:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> fine more Skittles for me
902695902539898881 2017-08-29 00:54:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> an even tie, wow pancakes should've won what are you guys doing
902570311706714112 2017-08-29 16:35:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @shenanigansen Doomestfist
902361244035842054 2017-08-28 02:44:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hope to relax this week before resuming a probably stressful school semester! And I say "resuming" cuz flooding has me out all week
902360766707376128 2017-08-28 02:42:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gonna chill out this week by playing Jak & Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, one of my all time favorite games! Will be my 12th or 13th run!
902292296741392385 2017-08-28 22:10:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The music will probably be good? I want to like it more, but not really feeling "Fire Emblem Awakening and Fates + Marth" as much either.
902259298281119745 2017-08-28 19:59:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity the heck is cinnamon sugar butter that sounds great I want some on my PANCAKES
902249898950701057 2017-08-28 19:21:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Mario + Rabbids is like out now and Metroid: Samus Returns is out in two weeks I can never keep up with all the games;alksdjfa;lskdfja;lkdj
902180867199598593 2017-08-28 14:47:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen Good luck!
902041566503731200 2017-08-27 05:34:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find it interesting and pretty great where in a world where you could fly on dragons (or even Golurk), they can still make cars cool
902040729530368000 2017-08-27 05:30:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I dislike driving but it'd be so much cooler if I could drive Wallace's air car from the Pokmon Adventures manga.pic.twitter.com/zhp5yYXgTg
902025845128212480 2017-08-27 04:31:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen @FloralSerenity I guess I expected completely new costumes, rather than from prior games. Not a bad thing tho  Side note: Ike in a bikini would be hilarious
902024574094671872 2017-08-27 04:26:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen @FloralSerenity Oh I knew they'd take a while, but I guess after knowing "they're getting special costumes" for this long, I just assumed they'd be cooler
902023214771122176 2017-08-27 04:21:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I don't think they're bad, but being like 6 months after the big poll I was expecting something more haha
902023095015399424 2017-08-27 04:20:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen Other thing is: the holiday outfits are new. Those are fun to look at while, when I see Lucina's it's like "cool but I've seen this already"
902020444265566209 2017-08-27 04:10:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen So yeah at least the veterans will appreciate them quite a bit
902020372463312896 2017-08-27 04:09:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I know Lucina's outfit is a reference to her outfit as a Great Lord class in Awakening, Roy's outfit is apparently his father's.
902019439180308480 2017-08-27 04:06:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I can't say I *don't* like the Choose Your Heroes outfits, but somehow I expected something cooler I guess?
901989764450181120 2017-08-27 02:08:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Both sub and dub are on Hulu I'm pretty sure, so whatever your preference, just go ahead and watch, it's excellent!
901989587735764992 2017-08-27 02:07:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do wanna say tho, now's a good a time as any for anybody to watch the original Death Note anime, one of the best anime of all time imo
901989399298232326 2017-08-27 02:06:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> -cuz of the poor writing, but he wasn't bad.
901989358290558976 2017-08-27 02:06:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> However, I did like Willem Dafoe as Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield as L. Felt like Ryuk was barely in it and Stanfield couldn't shine as much-
901988426236481537 2017-08-27 02:02:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Any other issues, you've probably seen other people tweet about many times over by now haha.
901988239510298624 2017-08-27 02:02:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> -Out of nowhere relationship I can't care about -Light vs. L has zero tension -Actually overall very little tension
901987817047326728 2017-08-27 02:00:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished #DeathNoteMovie  It was not good. But it was funny at least hahaha
901965782258782208 2017-08-27 00:32:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Willem Dafoe as Ryuk is pretty great tho.  IF ONLY WE COULD ACTUALLY SEE HIM
901965693452771329 2017-08-27 00:32:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Watching #DeathNoteMovie and it's actually laughably frustrating to watch and I'm not even 30 min in.
901954778460278785 2017-08-27 23:49:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> My my, how the turns have tabled.  :)
901954489472737281 2017-08-27 23:48:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm only sharing the good art of the world, to the world :)
901916035749728258 2017-08-27 21:15:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have a lot of things I need to settle:
901907579558916096 2017-08-27 20:41:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> YES!! I finished the Second Plate yesterday and I've been hungry for the Third, my timing has been great! :Dhttps://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/901907021892636672
901895824858370050 2017-08-27 19:54:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Where's the balance patch to ban you from the game?
901841496156114944 2017-08-27 16:19:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do not worry friends, I am safe. Hope any other peeps in Texas are too!
901667329863503872 2017-08-26 04:46:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Haven't seen it yet but, contradictory DN rules? Did they make new rules instead of using the old ones? Sounds like a very strange decision.
901658873530077185 2017-08-26 04:13:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I mean I GUESS you can
901575203322548225 2017-08-26 22:40:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LCacicio I mean, the way something looks is a big reason people choose many things they eat, reason food coloring and such exists
901574228302077955 2017-08-26 22:37:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LCacicio Well yeah the flavors are different but they're near identical in every other aspect so they can be compared pretty easily
901573003183628289 2017-08-26 22:32:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LCacicio What really, they're some of the most comparable candy out there haha
901570397849649153 2017-08-26 22:21:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mostflogged how
901569552810749952 2017-08-26 22:18:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar YOU CAN'T RIG THIS YOU WRONG FIEND
901568469883375616 2017-08-26 22:14:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I need to settle something
901554568865206272 2017-08-26 21:18:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT thought it'd be funny to see if there was a cosplay of Toru Hagakure from MHA AND I'M SO GLAD I LOOKED CUZ IT'S SO GREAT THERE IS

901493687955451904 2017-08-26 17:16:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @demoisellecos None today, it'll return next week tho. REasoning is a 24 Hour TV event or something, not fully sure
901471480508276739 2017-08-26 15:48:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu @CheeseyPokemon @anatomyofacake The name of the invisible girl in that gif is Toru (or Tooru) Hagakure, so he's not actually typoing this time. I'm proud.
901459472677208064 2017-08-26 15:01:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wrote what I feel is a decent lil thread last night, read if you feel, also watch "Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma" it's really good.
901316134514937857 2017-08-25 05:31:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> To close I guess, never thought an anime about cooking battles would help inspire me to work hard (just hope this feeling lasts)
901315911705128960 2017-08-25 05:30:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> This rambling, per usual, has no direction, and I know this is obvious stuff. But don't hold back because it's comfortable or easier.
901315346807873536 2017-08-25 05:28:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't quite have rivals or someone to surpass like Soma does in Food Wars!, but I do wish to better myself, however shaky my determination
901314328644792320 2017-08-25 05:24:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been watching anime and playing games for years and it's just now I realize the best I can take away is "don't freaking give in *ever*"
901313684470767616 2017-08-25 05:21:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Something I do a lot is decide I'm not good enough for something before even trying. I can recognize my inadequacies, but I can't face them.pic.twitter.com/O9qENhToVe
901313597904744448 2017-08-25 05:21:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lines like this are why I love Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma & anime in general. Kinda weird, but stuff like this actually affect me nowpic.twitter.com/P8Rn7XtIYq
901278496777015296 2017-08-25 03:01:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> welp can't find it (& there're presumably 2 chargers in my room). only strategy left is to look for something else cuz that's how that works
901274173540052993 2017-08-25 02:44:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Despite what the empty shelves imply, it's true: WOW! GOOD ANIME  But yes that's pretty great haha
901273905020772353 2017-08-25 02:43:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> When you have to Google what a PS Vita charger looks like because that's how little you use it lmao
901273196242120705 2017-08-25 02:40:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anime is really really good
901263810270564355 2017-08-25 02:03:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TomFawkes @NoLimit42 Video game creators decided it's ok for ppl to make money off their work. Stealing art doesn't give the artist that same freedom of decision
901246400570281984 2017-08-25 00:54:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> [Hurricane prep] Others: Gotta get food, store water in bathtub, make sure we prep for leaks too.  Me: charge phone, laptop, Vita...
901205241743290368 2017-08-25 22:10:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> gdi if the overall consensus is that Death Note 2017 is bad I hope the ppl crying "wHiTeWaShInG" don't say "told ya it'd be shit cuz whitew"
901202977960083456 2017-08-25 22:01:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was gonna judge for myself anyway but I find it funny that opinions are so mixed hahaha
901202847286480896 2017-08-25 22:01:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Twitter, how is Death Note 2017 "it's good!" "It's meh." "it's bad"  lmao well that didn't help hahaha
901190359182659585 2017-08-25 21:11:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> No exaggerating. Literally the entire universe, judged by someone who's eaten food from all over the universe. Instant ramen, lmao
901190139417956353 2017-08-25 21:10:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite things in Dragon Ball Super is that instant ramen is treated like the best food in the entire universe.
901111964310675456 2017-08-25 16:00:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @radiostarkiller Best part about this is using the freaking bruised and beaten Akira, poor guy is broken.
901096756716462080 2017-08-25 14:59:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 NOOOOOOOO I don't think I'll get an SD card in that time D:  But lmao knowing my luck I wouldn't have gotten Corrin anyway
901084216083058688 2017-08-25 14:09:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Ice Climbers are trying to conquer the tallest mountain; Wolf and Snake play poker and Wolf is trying to win back his Arwing, little luck.
901061799671410688 2017-08-25 12:40:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thinking about redownloading FE: Heroes; anyone know when the summer event ends, bummed about missing Robin but I at least want Corrin.
900937996093997056 2017-08-24 04:28:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MoonPie I respect your honesty
900906164526993408 2017-08-24 02:22:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Some chill jams to help me get through a stress filled week, here are some chill jams for you too:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW1ps75BRSM
900905643770564609 2017-08-24 02:20:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @NintendoAmerica @RenaeCollects Oh yeah. That's a thing, isn't it?
900897085578293248 2017-08-24 01:46:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree But we're never gonna get an official explanation I HAVE TO KNOW THE TRUTH, CARMEN!!
900893359836987392 2017-08-24 01:31:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> And who's to say at this point the dude is even the same guy from pic to pic. He could be a faker too. SO MANY QUESTIONS, WHAT'S THE TRUTH??
900893036800028672 2017-08-24 01:30:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> And who's to say there's only two? In all the stock photos they could all be different alternate timemension clonedroids of this one woman
900892689016782849 2017-08-24 01:28:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> If that's true, then the lore expands quite a bit here. Clone? Alternate dimension/timeline? Android? Does dude know? Does gf know?
900891039145349121 2017-08-24 01:22:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> So the meme with the stock photos of the guy and two women.  The women are actually just the same woman, right? That was quietly agreed on?
900840372758294528 2017-08-24 22:00:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is on Wii U for $30 and they're three great games and you should play them cuz Samus is coolhttps://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/900824252223541249
900839958109462533 2017-08-24 21:59:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> You gotta do better than that, I'm two steps ahead of you now.
900734715371692033 2017-08-24 15:01:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> When you recognize someone from high school but you forgot their name so you try to avoid all contact with them so you don't reveal u forgot
900724756135194624 2017-08-24 14:21:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar LISTEN TO THE SYMBOL OF PEACE HE KNOWS WHAT'S RIGHT  ONLY VILLAINS JOE VILLAINSpic.twitter.com/7oqnGICeet
900724018503983104 2017-08-24 14:18:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar BECAUSE ... uh because it's IT'S JUST WORNG
900723584867467264 2017-08-24 14:16:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar DOWN IS JUST PLAIN WRONG YOU FIEND
900346612018368512 2017-08-23 13:18:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahahaha there's reaching and there's tearing your arm off to reach. I respect their dedication, but seriously? Hahahahahttps://twitter.com/koi_0322/status/899646055137947649
900193014563442688 2017-08-22 03:08:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't know how hard/expensive it is to alter OPs multiple times, but it's the easy fix to this minor problem I think only I have hahaha
900191961893744642 2017-08-22 03:04:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's cool the first two times cuz it's like "ooh new characters, I wonder when we meet them" but it becomes "where are they when are they"
900191751864037376 2017-08-22 03:03:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Minor anime pet peeve: putting characters in the OP that don't appear until over halfway through the season (talking 12 ep seasons)
900156960628232192 2017-08-22 00:45:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby listen I like some of them. But I admit yes I am a F O O L
900156109088018433 2017-08-22 00:41:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Oh yeah it's not bad, just found it funny I criticized the checklist meme for that reasoning, since that's how most memes work haha
900138000973254656 2017-08-22 23:29:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess this means all memes are dumb, damn
900137898602897409 2017-08-22 23:29:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Twitter checklist meme is so dumb cuz it just takes other jokes and regurgitates them in an uncreative way and oh wait that's all memes
900082872513679360 2017-08-22 19:50:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry The only reason I even know about The Wiggles and that song is bc everyone in *high school* would sing it and I still don't understand
899842764053118976 2017-08-21 03:56:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ Keep doing your best, I believe in you and support you! You got this!! <3
899835838787452928 2017-08-21 03:29:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> This MHA episode was weeks ago but I can't stop thinking about this quote. As someone who's been feeling lost for year, this hits home hard.pic.twitter.com/9Z36eEfgsV
899444240291438592 2017-08-20 01:33:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> understand what I mean. Overall, & I know I gush about this a lot, but Persona is an incredible series, one that means a hell of a lot to me
899444093620801537 2017-08-20 01:32:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just finished the 4th movie & it leaves me with a feeling of...catharsis? Not quite the word I want, but those who know P3's ending may
899443012996132865 2017-08-20 01:28:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I feel for them when they're upset. I get mad when they do. I want all of them to be happy. Very few media have I connected to like this.
899442608161923072 2017-08-20 01:26:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't emote much when I watch or play games, but when it comes to Persona, I can connect with every single character.
899442470165127168 2017-08-20 01:26:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Persona 3 movie tetralogy is amazing, the the fourth one "Winter of Rebirth" is especially spectacular.
899059879389929472 2017-08-19 00:05:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp Don't own many figures, but once I get the space and money, this Aigis figure is the first one I'm getting!pic.twitter.com/90DOeQos6O
898783779367596035 2017-08-18 05:48:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Also, & this is moreso hot takes rather than subjective thoughts, if ppl are still buying Sonic games after 06 & Boom, what can Forces do?
898783276336394246 2017-08-18 05:46:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Main point is that if Mania ups expectations, they're getting hopeful over the wrong people, assuming Sonic Team leds most future games
898783029845344257 2017-08-18 05:45:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Also, and most "casual" consumers won't know this, Sonic Mania wasn't devved by Sonic Team. Sonic Team worked on Forces.
898782146705276930 2017-08-18 05:42:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity If Forces is a hit, then that's great, two in a row, go Sega! If it bombs, then eh, there was one good game amidst the bad.
898782103084691456 2017-08-18 05:42:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity tbh the way I see it, Sonic Mania's success is comparable to Generations' success and its effect on the franchise expectations
898733142743236608 2017-08-18 02:27:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll leave it up to you at this point. Either way good luck my friend haha
898732570187186176 2017-08-18 02:25:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity dang that's too bad. Maybe someday tho.  In that case Emerald or Platinum would be good
898730959146713088 2017-08-18 02:18:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Oh yeah, but only if you specifically play B2, pretty sure
898730598604226560 2017-08-18 02:17:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Consider that part of the challenge ;D
898730032289398784 2017-08-18 02:15:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity How about B2W2 Challenge Mode
898729293995544576 2017-08-18 02:12:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Wobbuffet run

898668554161094656 2017-08-18 22:10:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chrom, both of his wives, and his fourth wheeling sister who does nothing but tell embarrassing stories about Chrom to both of his wives
898581765903745025 2017-08-18 16:26:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> to not be up to par is kinda disappointing, especially since the original theme was so great.
898581746580688896 2017-08-18 16:25:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> And yes I care that much about the battle music remixes. It's very important to me and for the trainer battle theme, the one you hear most
898581100863393792 2017-08-18 16:23:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Zero care for the Z-Move, but this video has a remix of the trainer battle theme...and I am not digging it. Hope it grows on me.https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/898580140736733184
898579842165334016 2017-08-18 16:18:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> One reason I like Persona 4's cast is that, for plot reasons, the main cast wears glasses and every single one can and will kick ass.pic.twitter.com/10vQT2emI8

898544649094045696 2017-08-18 13:58:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for things we saw, rather than heard, female trainer looks cute so I'll be happy to play as her again
898543265535873024 2017-08-18 13:53:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Best part of the USUM trailer is the remix of the wild battle theme. Hoping other battle themes get update like GLADION'S BATTLE THEME YESSS
898383240150515712 2017-08-17 03:17:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Yes, but only when they're loaded
898382162940112897 2017-08-17 03:12:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Carmen I'm just sharing my culinary expertise with everyone. Don't you like sandwiches? :D
898375735668346880 2017-08-17 02:47:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Stuffed crust pizza Cherries w/seed Raw eggs if you eat the shell Soup if you also eat the bowl Fries in between other fries  Sandwiches
898370234712805376 2017-08-17 02:25:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chocolate chip cookies: sandwich? I'm leaning yes, but feel free to discuss
898367521312657408 2017-08-17 02:14:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bagels with cream cheese are sandwiches

898019939134689283 2017-08-16 03:13:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Those are deved by three different companies, what an incredible coincidence
898014500019949570 2017-08-16 02:51:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, might do these in a Twitlonger cuz my answers can get long and don't like making 500000 tweets but it is kinda late so less will see
898014307635437568 2017-08-16 02:51:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't usually do these type dealies but I'm bored so I'll do 3 per like, depending on how I'm feeling, if anyone cares~pic.twitter.com/Uc3xZvmqcG
897974745160921090 2017-08-16 00:13:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not even as a joke, I 100% completely forget Xbox exists sometimes lmao
897953246613913600 2017-08-16 22:48:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I literally reached to play a game I've been meaning to for a week then my arm literally dropped cuz I lost the motivation to play it hahaha
897952869340430337 2017-08-16 22:47:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ever try to tell yourself "I should do thing." and never get around to it for days but one day u right about to but then don't feel like it?
897883240157073410 2017-08-16 18:10:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh yeah there is, takes place in cooking high school so intense only 1% of students graduate. Don't worry, there's actual plot & characters
897882640539406337 2017-08-16 18:07:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Crunchyroll @JoeyJostar Boruto: Boruto's Dad Next Generations.
897882452210978816 2017-08-16 18:07:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's about cooking food so amazing, the eater has a foodgasm. And by "foodgasm", I mean that pretty literally. No joke.
897868329246916609 2017-08-16 17:11:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, 9 episodes into "Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma" & I enjoy it. Biggest complaint, however, is that the OP and ED are really boring haha
897863764007170053 2017-08-16 16:52:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cooks in the anime Food Wars!: Caught a live duck and turned it into an amazing dish in under an hour  Me: I added butter to frozen pasta
897703218167394310 2017-08-15 06:15:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do you say "byoot-a-fool" too? But yeah I like the detail in her speech and how they write out what she says exactly how she says it
897699031245361153 2017-08-15 05:58:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's a small detail that goes a long way, and it's one I really appreciate about the Pokmon Adventures manga.
897698899149848576 2017-08-15 05:57:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ruby and Sapphire's overall rivalry. Sapphire's confidence, proud of one upping Ruby; Ruby's annoyance & frustration, all clearly portrayed
897698654173241348 2017-08-15 05:56:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> All three of these panels are just on two side by side pages and every single face does a great job of showing exactly both character is and
897697496574590976 2017-08-15 05:52:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Want to take the time to appreciate that Sapphire Birch is great and I love the facial expressions in the Adventures manga.pic.twitter.com/iHqfBk1OOV
897676676066398210 2017-08-15 04:29:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> B U T if the Pokmon Adventures manga got the same treatment, maybe even color the panels too, I'd be so down for that. The downest
897676616771543040 2017-08-15 04:29:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> So Splatoon's manga got "animated" which is nothing more than digitally going panel by panel and animating some of them, kinda lame
897323989114261504 2017-08-14 05:08:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SoCassandra Wikipedia is much more credible than people give it credit for imo
897285154900758528 2017-08-14 02:33:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar then it's pretty shitty mindset. And yeah one on the right would be a super boring character
897285029340073986 2017-08-14 02:33:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I feel like if you take the hypothetical situation "take someone you find unattractive and surgically restructure their face"
897110562873778176 2017-08-14 15:00:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar the hunt never ends get ready for 900 more Korok seeds in the REAL WORLD!!
896862808532410369 2017-08-13 22:35:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Her
896810341082030080 2017-08-13 19:07:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Awesome Sophie, thanks for the free art! :D
896765931602542592 2017-08-13 16:10:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do you ever look at a fictional character & just really want them to be happy? I want all my faves to be happy but some can't & it upsets me
896744108747894784 2017-08-13 14:43:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Yeah I just hope people don't think  "lol this was just as dumb and lame as I thought" or whatever, I'd hope for it to be better
896743598796025856 2017-08-13 14:41:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar to be on a feed of "main stream" content, I think that's pretty awesome.
896743575312105472 2017-08-13 14:41:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Sounds pretty lame for us peeps who watch YouTube gaming content regularly, but for video game content to be on a big channel like Disney,
896743156502462465 2017-08-13 14:40:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> like even something like Kobayashi's Dragon Maid or even CLANNAD like yo imagine if those had tournament arcs that'd be sick
896742977518927872 2017-08-13 14:39:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Put a tournament arc in almost anything and I will get super hype for it even if it might not make much sense
896580578681786368 2017-08-12 03:54:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I mean, I know the answer is basically "yes", but still, wow. Interesting to think about I guess.
896579975570235392 2017-08-12 03:51:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Is that what people who don't know anything about the anime community look at anime fans and culture and view it as "girly"/bizarre?
896579801800073216 2017-08-12 03:50:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like...HUH?!?! It's clear he knew and has seen nothing other than the name but it makes me think: is that how others see anime?
896578841405038593 2017-08-12 03:47:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Had a friend who doesn't watch or know much of anything about anime say "most anime look girly" and pulled the example *One Punch Man*
896549650735534080 2017-08-12 01:51:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @OfficialRinnieR You look AMAZING!!
896412007800467458 2017-08-12 16:44:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon We've been over this Cheesey no shoots
896394110361382913 2017-08-12 15:33:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> have you seen some of the art on that tag cuz that would definitely say otherwise  Or so I've been told. Obviously.
896391175061549059 2017-08-12 15:21:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I appreciate all of Widowmaker.
896390149080317952 2017-08-12 15:17:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have seen it and it's great but she got nothing on Widow I'm sorry just stating the facts
896389963046146050 2017-08-12 15:16:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I'm very fluent
896389627858354179 2017-08-12 15:15:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Listen
896383524911099905 2017-08-12 14:51:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon YOUR ART DOES COUNT AND I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO IT!!
896377998810771457 2017-08-12 14:29:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Why? Uh, no reason. No specific reason. Absolutely none. None at all. Zero.  0.
896377231659810816 2017-08-12 14:26:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hello #cutiesaturday artists who may be reading this, I hope you're having a good day also if you drew Widowmaker's new skin that'd be sweetpic.twitter.com/spcXCc8Ui9
896214583484063744 2017-08-11 03:39:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah I definitely forgot and it definitely surprised me hahahahaha
896081647874920448 2017-08-11 18:51:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
896070768517201922 2017-08-11 18:08:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then that first part comes back and says BUT LOOK AT HOW GORGEOUS THIS GAME IS  LOOK AT IT!!pic.twitter.com/caIG5g2ZoH
896070628603707392 2017-08-11 18:07:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Part of me wants to get Dragon Ball FighterZ, but another part reminds me it's hard to get into fighting games that aren't Smash Bros.
896060235936186368 2017-08-11 17:26:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Not playable?! But....but..... D: Hopefully she comes as DLC, preferably free like Cia and her gang in Hyrule Warriors. How could they D:
896009856183918592 2017-08-11 14:06:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ayyyy look at that, neither team summoned legends; protag and Lillie did. It's interesting comparing speculation to what actually happened
895829834944970752 2017-08-10 02:10:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @demoisellecos I'm assuming it's Furret's total length, not from head to toes but even then they still kinda look smaller than that in anime haha
895829025788223488 2017-08-10 02:07:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Crunchyroll Thank you for delivering the greatness of Daily Hifumi
895803344631070720 2017-08-10 00:25:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I changed three of my Windows program event signs to Miles Edgeworth yelling "OBJECTION!" so inb4 I forget I did that and it scares me later
895762767730356224 2017-08-10 21:44:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Eh, I don't feel like the penalty is harsh so I think it's fine. I get where you're coming from tho, no gamer should feel pressured to play
895750986832248834 2017-08-10 20:57:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Sure you have to work a bit harder if you skip a few weeks, but it doesn't strictly require you to play every single day
895750842032304128 2017-08-10 20:56:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I'm not a fan of games that want you to play daily or miss out somehow, but I don't think that makes AC horrible.
895697213158019073 2017-08-10 17:23:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @raikoart AAAHHHH this is AMAZING!!
895688896499068928 2017-08-10 16:50:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> If for some reason, you need a crowd of excited Shy Guys to cheer you on today, here you go:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKS6azvmCmo
895665616182489088 2017-08-10 15:18:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Feels kinda greedy, but I hope more of the later revealed characters are free rather than paid DLC, cuz overall feeling eh about what we got
895665154813288449 2017-08-10 15:16:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I dunno, main weird thing is that many FE classes aren't super represented rn, yet the roster matches Hyrule Warriors' free roster already
895664997946339332 2017-08-10 15:15:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> But two of those are Awakening characters and we already have a ton of those. I'd enjoy Catria or Ursula too I guess.
895664691535654912 2017-08-10 15:14:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> If I could choose 3 ideal characters I'd want Anna (specifically her FE: Heroes incarnation), Tharja, and Female!Morgan cuz those are my fav
895662349058748416 2017-08-10 15:05:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> some better* character variety. Most characters so far are kinda the typical choices, not as fun as Hyrule Warriors' character choices
895662148503953409 2017-08-10 15:04:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Could use some character variety (tho we def haven't seen all the characters, I just hope we haven't seen all the free ones yet)
895661940072214528 2017-08-10 15:03:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> FEW is looking to pretty interesting gameplay wise, requires much more strategy than other Warriors games, can't just cut your way throughhttps://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/895656765118849025
895487499233099776 2017-08-09 03:30:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo give them both humanlike fists
895353239838785536 2017-08-09 18:37:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @GirafarigTree This is amazing
895321423899537408 2017-08-09 16:30:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> No hard feelings if I don't accept, I'm just weird like that I guess.
895321365053558784 2017-08-09 16:30:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reason for this is that I'm extremely wary of opening up about myself and my problems, but I'm try to loosen up.
895321264629325824 2017-08-09 16:29:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I made an alt account @ScizorThoughts, a place for me to vent at myself. Do want to note tho that I may not accept all follows
895317614339149824 2017-08-09 16:15:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I believe in you, Cheese.
895291748787924992 2017-08-09 14:32:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG This game is an incredible experience, I hope you enjoy it!
895064717911314432 2017-08-08 23:30:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Kind of a harsh, overgeneralized assumption for a character's fanbase, don't you think?
895014079038971904 2017-08-08 20:09:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar YOOOOO CONGRATS
895010374952603652 2017-08-08 19:54:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd like to see more "Dry" enemies, especially to see their skeletal structure and to see if they even have bones or not.
895009910609653760 2017-08-08 19:52:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bone Piranha Plants exist which means Piranha Plants, which may I emphasize are *plants*, canonically have bones.pic.twitter.com/gS6Ymggt7s
894971557323341824 2017-08-08 17:20:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING AN ALEJFASAKJDLKASJFI
894955118587777025 2017-08-08 16:15:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar But overall it'llbe less than last year is I'm super fine with
894955074463703040 2017-08-08 16:14:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar The only thing I really wanna know is "what is this game" but of course they're gonna market a bit more than that
894951719939043328 2017-08-08 16:01:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar That'd be so weird but if that happened, I hope they ramp up the intensity in his battle music for some serious mood whiplash
894951326605508608 2017-08-08 15:59:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yes. Yes he can. Just for you, buddy.
894950518589714432 2017-08-08 15:56:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> At this point the one thing I want most out of Pokmon USUM is to battle Gladion more than three times so we keep hearing his AMAZING THEME
894947536414310400 2017-08-08 15:44:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hyped that the NWC are returning! It was super exciting to watch back in 2015 and was kinda bummed it didn't return last year!https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/894906229952311296
894941590644547585 2017-08-08 15:21:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar dude SAME
894700100726824960 2017-08-07 23:21:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you were curious, my favorite of the Prime trilogy is actually the first Prime. I love the atmosphere, feeling of loneliness, & the music
894696864859119618 2017-08-07 23:08:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a great game, I love it. But personally, I enjoy Prime 1 and Prime 3: Corruption more.
894695702906847232 2017-08-07 23:04:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> #ConfessYourUnpopularOpinions  Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, while I think is a great game, is my least favorite of the Metroid Prime trilogy
894382735262969861 2017-08-06 02:20:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen Bowstring? lmao Rebecca doesn't need that crap. With a flick of the wrist she can just throw an arrow with the speed of using a bow.
894260535784488960 2017-08-06 18:15:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects Hey Renae stop playing Splatoon.
894247130528960513 2017-08-06 17:21:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's no reason to apologize for that, getting thru that is hard for anyone. Don't know what else to say other than hang in there, friend
894057423224397824 2017-08-05 04:47:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar 
893989820879560704 2017-08-05 00:19:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love Pokmon games and Game Freak, but ugh their rabid vocal fans can be so obnoxious
893989664931098624 2017-08-05 00:18:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Game Freak: *breathes* Fans: WTF THIS IS WHAT YOU GIVE US, WHY DON'T YOU TELL AND GIVE US LITERALLY EVERYTHIGN YOU GUYS SUCK LAZY DUMB BAD
893980382634422272 2017-08-05 23:41:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finally entering USUM's market phase, just about anyway.  Game Freak. Please. Don't show us every single thing about the games thank you
893874256257454081 2017-08-05 16:40:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo "This is a thread so check out my replies to this" People proceed to *not* check out replies. So dumb they don't even read what they RT haha
893524668338122752 2017-08-04 17:30:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Even better, it'd be funnier if Leo was damaged too. Even tho he's "winning", he's still gonna lose hahaha
893524534787178496 2017-08-04 17:30:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I love how Robin is losing but doesn't even have her damaged sprite but Gaius is losing and has his.
893511967008333824 2017-08-04 16:40:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 All I know is that she's part chihuahua, think we got her from the pound so we're not really sure what else besides chihuahua.
893497870443327489 2017-08-04 15:44:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @GirafarigTree Yeah true, Virion is pretty funny, I just don't think he'd be popular enough to be playable in FEW. Not fully sure tho
893495186483011584 2017-08-04 15:33:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity lmao do people even like Virion (my money's on Takumi for the archer tho)
893487975253725184 2017-08-04 15:05:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't worry about her left ear, she had an ear infection last month and while that ear won't stand up again, she's definitely fine now!
893487293733928960 2017-08-04 15:02:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have an adorable dog her name is Sally. She is very cute. Look at her, please.pic.twitter.com/blLyUgSxoX
893294071061544965 2017-08-03 02:14:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Dave_1307 People who make "react" videos where they record themselves watching other peoples videos or sometimes anime/TV and overly react to them
893278023943823361 2017-08-03 01:10:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 GIRL KILL IT
893239995775029249 2017-08-03 22:39:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @freinoir My rule: nobody is dead unless we see a body
893181360931823616 2017-08-03 18:46:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree You haven't failed us, Carmen! Always wishing you the best!
893121618016428033 2017-08-03 14:49:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree You're absolutely right and thank you Carmen. You always support me and I really appreciate it  <3
893121329209233408 2017-08-03 14:48:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> When the Persona spinoffs got announced yesterday I got inspired to work on school things I haven't touched all summer, so that works for me
893119517236150273 2017-08-03 14:41:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sounds and sometimes feels dumb, but I think the motivator I need to push myself to betterment is video games, thing I'm most passionate abt
892961713619914752 2017-08-02 04:13:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @anatomyofacake Merry Birthmas, hope you have an amazing bday! :D
892895151055675396 2017-08-02 23:49:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity plot of the P5 Dancing game is MC stealing Chaos Emeralds & dancing in victory as he takes over the world & this is why I love video games
892800466572251142 2017-08-02 17:33:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @famicom_wars So if you didn't know about 2015's concert or today's concert then you wouldn't know we'd get news.
892800439590289408 2017-08-02 17:33:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @famicom_wars There was big Persona concert in Japan today, last concert to this scale was in 2015; revealed the thieves aspect of P5
892774963547164672 2017-08-02 15:51:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I freaking love this outfit. I do plan to cosplay P5 protag in the very distant future but I gotta do this outfit too it's so STYLEpic.twitter.com/jX8qSbbvEO
892745085510660098 2017-08-02 13:53:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> No release date on PQ2, but Spring 2018 for dancing games in Japan? America might get them this time next year, that isn't too long at all!!
892743867149189120 2017-08-02 13:48:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Learning that 3 new Persona spinoffs are in the works and one of them is P3?! Best thing to wake up to!
892739181717409792 2017-08-02 13:29:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!! THEY'RE BOTH HAPPENING?!?! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHJJHHJJhttps://twitter.com/SteveChopz/status/892709617058418688
892584610093203457 2017-08-01 03:15:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> dang these two are pretty good!
892582676225548288 2017-08-01 03:07:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Make a song about fighting gods maybe? which wouldn't really work cuz theoretically Saitama is the strongest it's a tough OP to outdo
892579518694797312 2017-08-01 02:55:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> So Mob Psycho 100 might be getting a new season soon & I just realized. The first OP "99" is one of the best OPs ever. Can that be topped?!
892475916785504256 2017-08-01 20:03:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @famicom_wars I guess looking it that way, Cordelia over Sumia is a little strange, but I guess after the same treatment in FE Heroes I'm not surprised
892472749683343360 2017-08-01 19:50:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @famicom_wars Is it that odd? I thought Cordelia was much more popular than Sumia
892438695407742980 2017-08-01 17:35:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's a good way to judge it tbh, it's gotta be somethign great if you keep coming back to it haha
892437952411967489 2017-08-01 17:32:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> dang so many really good games n i c e
892437290227838976 2017-08-01 17:30:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah Blue's a technical case, but yes Hugh and Silver's themes are some of the best from their respective games
892435562216513537 2017-08-01 17:23:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting that Blue, Silver, Hugh, and Gladion imo the best rivals, (in order of introduction), have the best rival battle themes haha
892435175610740736 2017-08-01 17:21:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's me with Hugh's battle theme rn, I forgot how awesome this theme is, it is a JAM
892434913017962497 2017-08-01 17:20:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> You ever go back to a theme you really like but haven't heard in a long time and you remember how much you like it?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKqRMfquvgY
892425468347023360 2017-08-01 16:43:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> (also really hard fight for 5th place cuz choosing favorites past 3rd is really hard)
892425365376946176 2017-08-01 16:42:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 5 Persona 4 Golden Persona 3 FES Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door Pokmon HGSS  I really like RPGs that start with "P" I guess.https://twitter.com/epicgeezr/status/891781690540118018
892245076700786689 2017-07-31 04:46:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SergioPimwong If you watched the vid, you'd see she has no "details".
892241380948541440 2017-07-31 04:31:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> sorry for having the dumbest problems, just annoyed at myself again
892241292364828672 2017-07-31 04:31:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> me: okay, time to look for a job!!! brain: don't forget you looked at like every place that might hire you and *both* rejected  ohyeah nice
892233883521089536 2017-07-31 04:01:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie me this entire freaking summer

891823092879818753 2017-07-30 00:49:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo The poses only get more extravagant and amazing later on
891747371692040196 2017-07-30 19:48:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 5 means a lot to me and I want tons of people to see how amazing it is and the anime will make it easier (and it'll look awesome)
891746022464139265 2017-07-30 19:43:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Super excited for the Persona 5 anime cuz people who can't/won't play the game can see how awesome P5 is and that excites me so much!
891695839760003072 2017-07-30 16:23:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo imo, best to start at the beginning with Phantom Blood
891647990447951872 2017-07-30 13:13:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought this would get announced at the concert on Wed, it was for a different event. Maybe the concert will have a game announcement!!!!!
891645992457646081 2017-07-30 13:05:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> WOOHOO I HOPE ITS REALLY GOODhttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/891583996131512320
891525632034820098 2017-07-29 05:07:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> So, uh, now that I've finished JJBA Part 4... Part 5 anime when? hahaha
891524700932907008 2017-07-29 05:03:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Especially the main villain, wasn't sure if they could top DIO but imo they exceeded expectations very well, very entertaining villain.
891523612905275392 2017-07-29 04:59:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished JJBA: Diamond is Unbreakable & it was greato. Overall it was a ton of fun, enjoyed almost every character quite a bit.
891473984335872000 2017-07-29 01:42:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pose isn't my favorite, but Makoto is my girl, so I might need this.k afljskjlai439ioejfksldjhttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/891470795121283072
891463308057903106 2017-07-29 00:59:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Of course being there live is a better experience, but America barely gets these Persona concerts, let alone Europe, so this helps everyone!
891462842045616128 2017-07-29 00:57:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> THIS IS SO COOOOLLL (not that I have the money) but I could theoretically watch a concert that's in Japan without having to leave my homehttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/891454651459096578
891400545906372608 2017-07-29 20:50:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG As much as I want you to play Persona 5, I say finish any other large games you're in the middle in beforehand.
890922780392382464 2017-07-28 13:11:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> humanity before.
890922724272373762 2017-07-28 13:11:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you like your memes that much wait till its on Netflix or something Not that I think it'll get sequel money but hey, I've underestimated-
890922393237172224 2017-07-28 13:10:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah don't go see this movie. It's horrible and we deserve better content than this, so don't give it money. We don't need fund abominationshttps://twitter.com/Dr_Negative/status/890668594794647552
890920145673232384 2017-07-28 13:01:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
890785557755740160 2017-07-27 04:06:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon Fire Emblem is very anime nowadays
890784857973850113 2017-07-27 04:03:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @FloralSerenity why do you hate good things. (kidding, I'm actually fine she's not in cuz I don't want repeats, surprised to see Xander again tbh)
890701243248783360 2017-07-27 22:31:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is a great anime and you peeps should watch it cuz it's nice to enjoy good thingshttps://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/890700843682484224
890698258326192128 2017-07-27 22:19:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 b e s t
890610488832294912 2017-07-27 16:31:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Her "R" is freaking backwards I can't stop laughing at how bad this is
890307875431735297 2017-07-26 20:28:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Next week there's gonna b a big Persona concert & there *might* be an announcement & I've never been so excited for a concert I can't attend
890304154354188288 2017-07-26 20:13:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> don't worry, you get enough letters and most of the words in that my brain figures out the rest. I don't even realize some typos haha
890302974332940293 2017-07-26 20:09:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought meant to try again with a full party but never got around to it, wish I did cuz the fight alone would've been a blast haha
890302830959112193 2017-07-26 20:08:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I read a guide that it's better to fight him solo and that guide was dumb I survived longer than I thought I would but I never fought again
890296120550752259 2017-07-26 19:41:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh yeah I can bet that felt amazing haha
890291262359785473 2017-07-26 19:22:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can only imagine what the DLC where you play as Ganon in his monster form is like hahaha
890291177496481792 2017-07-26 19:22:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Playing as Ganondorf in Hyrule Warriors is high up there on the list of most satisfying video game experiences.
890220068872892417 2017-07-26 14:39:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I will never be free from Morgana's grasp. I must be tired indeed.
890219303542411264 2017-07-26 14:36:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was almost never late so I don't even know that panic that well, dreams are weird
890218970850234370 2017-07-26 14:35:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just had a "gonna be late to high school" dream when I've been out for over two years. Does this still happen to anyone else?
889465172816998400 2017-07-24 12:39:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm terrible at expressing gratitude but it actually does mean a lot to me, so thanks.
889464939555024897 2017-07-24 12:39:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've lost the reasons to. Don't really know where I'm going with this so that's it I guess. Thanks for reading and thanks for supporting me.
889464829869797377 2017-07-24 12:38:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I think most importantly,  I want to be someone who's proud of myself. Someone who doesn't self deprecate themselves all the time bc
889463239058350080 2017-07-24 12:32:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not specifically looking for someone to be proud of me, but I want to become a person who someone can be proud of I guess?
889462020361342976 2017-07-24 12:27:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not looking for admiration or attention or whatever. I just want to be able to feel like I can stand on equal ground with them.
889461559545737217 2017-07-24 12:25:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I admire my close friends quite a lot. All of them have worked hard to gain the respective skills and knowledge they have, pretty amazing.
889460611817648128 2017-07-24 12:21:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm going to try to work harder to improve myself & break my bad habits. I'm going to find a goal to work towards & use that for motivation.
889318068106690560 2017-07-23 02:55:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon thank you Cheesey, that means a lot. I'll definitely try.
889315915657089024 2017-07-23 02:46:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I appreciate you Carmen, thank you <3
889315314663653376 2017-07-23 02:44:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> An unhealthy cycle I've now identified, but won't do anything to fix. Yep, that's me.
889315250222366724 2017-07-23 02:44:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then, after wallowing in self pity for a few hours, I distract myself from it by playing video games, watching anime or whatever.
889315015584624641 2017-07-23 02:43:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Next, I complain at universe that I don't have any of the things I desire in life, even tho I'm not working for them, like an entitled ass
889314834898182147 2017-07-23 02:42:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> After identifying my problems, I sometimes propose solutions to solving them. But, ofc, I'm too lazy & shitty of a human being to act on any
889314732016103426 2017-07-23 02:42:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Slowly realizing that not just video games, but everything I do is me trying to distract myself from or otherwise avoid my problems
889274060387102720 2017-07-23 00:00:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tenleid @gayguns First two are official art, I can tell by the art style. Second two are screenshots from Dancing All Night
889154183911403520 2017-07-23 16:04:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT I'm not into watching sports but now I'm down to watch a sport

888907351830532097 2017-07-22 23:43:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar B       R             O
888814600438808578 2017-07-22 17:34:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 have fun but pls take care
888500497610678272 2017-07-21 20:46:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Bagbot29 any relationships, obvi it's easier to enjoy if you identify with that kind of relationship, but not impossible if you don't
888500468594483200 2017-07-21 20:46:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Bagbot29 Yeah that first tweet was sarcastically calling out people who just couldn't enjoy male x male relationship. Anyone can enjoy content with
888499227806101504 2017-07-21 20:41:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> tl;dr: it's ok to not like a dating sim bc of your sexuality, but it's not ok to constantly whine about ur preferences not matching the game
888498763513430021 2017-07-21 20:39:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> get off to that. That's especially shitty and that attitude needs to stop.
888498698933686276 2017-07-21 20:39:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> the idea of men dating men. What's even worse is saying two women in a relationship is ok cuz that's hot, but two men isn't cuz you don't
888498147567292416 2017-07-21 20:37:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> What isn't ok is making a big deal out of the fact that you're straight or poking at the fact that "lol this is gay" or acting disgusted at
888496812604219393 2017-07-21 20:32:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> dating sim. In the case of Dream Daddy, it's aimed at people who want to or would enjoy dating men. So if you're not into that, that's okay
888496503928573954 2017-07-21 20:30:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> To revise/clear up what I mean: I mainly think it's shitty that people make a big deal of being straight and not being able to enjoying a
888496012980920320 2017-07-21 20:28:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @CheeseyPokemon My apologies for not being 100% clear, but yes this is mainly what I mean: people making a big deal are shitty.
888432186675908609 2017-07-21 16:15:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> you don't identify with is apparently impossible, right?
888432104794722305 2017-07-21 16:14:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> New rule: all non-straight people should wonder how they enjoy content with straight relationships, cuz being able to enjoy something you-
888408336693174273 2017-07-21 14:40:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahahaha it was way more than just a third, buddy
888178435813769217 2017-07-20 23:26:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> lmao you better not be paying for these
888177732735164417 2017-07-20 23:24:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I only tweet and RT high quality tweets
888162863277383680 2017-07-20 22:25:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp Bayonetta 2's "Tomorrow Is Mine" has been my jam as of late:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au9s4KRaIDc
888044156307877889 2017-07-20 14:33:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> it'd probably have really weird UI. Basically I think I'd be ok with a "DS Classic"  Also we can put DP on there so no need for remakes >:D
888043317279248384 2017-07-20 14:30:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> And despite its versatility, the Switch is a one screen console. I'm sure it's possible for some DS games to play on just one screen but
888042936340021248 2017-07-20 14:28:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> The only real issue would be DS games, a problem I don't see a solution for currently. Wii U can emulate DS, but 3DS can't, but Wii U's done
888042676154765312 2017-07-20 14:27:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> I really hope Nintendo doesn't make a "Classic" version of all their consoles. Just put them on the Switch please.
887403473951653889 2017-07-18 20:07:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @famicom_wars MHA airs on Saturday mornings
887158250638016512 2017-07-17 03:53:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen I love that All Might always has that giant grin on his face, it's a contagious grin that's for sure haha
887115373014896640 2017-07-17 01:02:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> They're usually used when someone gets mad, which I usually don't, but I especially love All Might's cuz he (almost) never turns them off
887114791705346049 2017-07-17 01:00:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another anime thing I wish I could do in real life: turn on what I like to call the "dark eyes" (All Might from MHA) (Jotaro Kujo from JJBA)pic.twitter.com/YZi2NFoPUX
886745511113486338 2017-07-16 00:32:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Wait Korra comics are out nani
886256293094096901 2017-07-15 16:09:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Recently started playing Old School Runescape/RS2, such a nostalgia trip. Played a couple hours every day in middle school at one point
886069695958437888 2017-07-14 03:47:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> After having the greatness of ice cream cake, cheesecake is just...lacking, incomplete.  Maybe cake and ice cream were destined to be one.
885520434178949120 2017-07-13 15:24:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> hello Hyrule Warriors is a fun game and this is the best theme in the game, have a good day!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohj1VzJRJXI

884659453202763776 2017-07-10 06:23:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity bully me all you want I won't stop appreciating the good and important art of the world
884625558373629952 2017-07-10 04:09:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Yeah I get that. But also know it's fine to have free time, even for a little bit!
884618329851408386 2017-07-10 03:40:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I'd say "get a job" but 1 I know how hard that is and 2 not sure if you have time, want to, etc.
884498713955250176 2017-07-10 19:45:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity But I won't get my hopes up haha. Kinda too bad tho
884498563123818497 2017-07-10 19:44:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Every movie is just an advertisement for the next event 'mon, seems the anniversary movie is no exception, I'm afraid. Eh, it might be good
884496901843951618 2017-07-10 19:37:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Nothing like celebrating what's loved about the original w/ classic characters: Ash, Pikachu, & these new people you don't care about. YEAH!
884432318160621569 2017-07-10 15:21:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> He worked hard to make people happy with video games. And I'm sure he's happy and proud with where Nintendo and their fans are now.
884432204356608000 2017-07-10 15:20:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Whenever I see Iwata's name, it's weird, but I get bittersweet I guess? Sad that he's gone, but he wouldn't want us to be sad.https://twitter.com/japanese3ds/status/884427000454270976
884174652737822722 2017-07-09 22:17:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Sounds like keeping quiet may have been a good call. Try not to let that bother you tho
884173488432574469 2017-07-09 22:12:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity "triggered" and "weeb" have zero correlation. Someone must have strong legs to make a leap in logic like that.
884136750351777792 2017-07-09 19:46:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> -instance I can recall where it didn't happen (Team Four Star's Dragon Ball Z Abridged) and wish that more media did that instead.
884136727723614208 2017-07-09 19:46:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Minor pet peeve: when a body/mind swap also swaps voices. I'm sure it's to make things easy to keep track of, but I appreciated the one-

883536414926831616 2017-07-07 04:01:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I think that for 1, those balloons should be pop-able, Twitter lacks a crucial feature. And for 2, don't feel bad, I tried to pop them too.
883535385913151488 2017-07-07 03:57:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: I don't wanna make a tweet bringing attention to my bday Also me: thank you friends for bringing attention to my birthday  Nice job, me.

883140736899846144 2017-07-06 01:48:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Seriously, was this game marketed at all and I somehow missed all of it? Weird.  Either way looks neat I guess.
883140374029623296 2017-07-06 01:47:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo: we launched Kirby's Blowout Blast on eShop today Me: what how have I literally never heard or seen anything of this game until now
883126850444296192 2017-07-06 00:53:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT hey guys wanna go kill a god?
883111331049734144 2017-07-06 23:52:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Twitter apparently likes to show a lot of the tweets that I like so I hope you like cute girls and also you're welcome
883100653119262721 2017-07-06 23:09:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> THIS IS SUCH A J A M  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UrRkA0lwVY
883093962277478401 2017-07-06 22:43:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> hello hating a character just because you like another character more is the second dumbest thing I've read all don't be stupid k seeya
882703772430069761 2017-07-05 20:52:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I think you're gonna need a real waterfall for some real training
882455922941054976 2017-07-04 04:27:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I still think about stupid things I've said years ago. Not as much regret as hours after, but definitely wish I said something better.
882435662414307329 2017-07-04 03:07:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reason you should watch My Hero Academia: this gifpic.twitter.com/Yiamzduly8
882431931262144512 2017-07-04 02:52:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's also hilarious to see people complain about how hard the game is. Crash was always tough and we loved and dealt with it hahaha
882431082423103488 2017-07-04 02:48:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I loved Crash 3 and 4 as a kid, so it makes me happy to see the bandicoot so popular now, hope this officially kicks of Crash's reboot! :D
882077359905673216 2017-07-03 03:23:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> A big reason I love Last Week Tonight is that they take that thinking to the best levels. Please watch this.https://youtu.be/5cBV8KFFasY
882077339882008576 2017-07-03 03:23:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite things to do is going the extra mile for a sometimes simple and/or ridiculous joke.
882059050686590976 2017-07-03 02:10:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 the best one
882013001989140480 2017-07-03 23:07:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Oh yeah, you should definitely stop at that point
882010443203715073 2017-07-03 22:57:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar how
881996595339898880 2017-07-03 22:02:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Random thought: saying that "apples & oranges" can't be compared has to be one of the dumbest things bc they are some of the most comparable
881996179210477568 2017-07-03 22:00:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I've done one speedrun and I yelled at myself the entire time for making dumb mistakes so yeah I feel that hahaha
881548021477117952 2017-07-02 16:20:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished the anime "New Game!" a few days ago and I really liked it. Another "cute girls do cute things" anime, but with video games! :Dpic.twitter.com/GVU9sbGzLI
881346039277551618 2017-07-01 02:57:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I will note used copies are $20 (fair price, but trade-in value is still ridiculous in comparison), but my copy is unopened; it'd sell new
881345296248299520 2017-07-01 02:54:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looking into selling Uncharted 4 that came with my PS4 bundle, looked at GameStop as a joke AND WHAT A JOKE IT WAS AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHApic.twitter.com/VvBQL4S3hl
881229054321545220 2017-07-01 19:12:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know my whole joke is "boobs" but really I love hair, hair is great. Black hair, blue hair, purple hair, red hair, hair is good.
881227850283659264 2017-07-01 19:07:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> You bet I understand, red hair is great.
881000744702357506 2017-06-30 04:05:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> So the way I see it now, in addition to just guarding *every* attack, I'll have to either use lots of items or be really lucky hahaha...ha
881000332171632641 2017-06-30 04:03:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I tried to guage how I'll do by fighting The Master, I beat the first two fights, but the final form is tough when he can one shot me hahaha
881000110854897665 2017-06-30 04:02:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I started a BP+FP only run of Paper Mario 64 & I am worried about the Bowser fight, he can heal up to thrice & I'll have like 15 HP at best
880910837971636225 2017-06-30 22:08:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree @Azurillkirby excuse
880902012233293827 2017-06-30 21:33:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I have indeed, there's a couple of her prints I need to get eventually. It's always good to see some great art, so thanks for showing! :D
880651141847150592 2017-06-29 04:56:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 WHAT THA HELL IS TOIHISI WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
880535421754658816 2017-06-29 21:16:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar ABOUT TIME
880455820709740544 2017-06-29 16:00:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> #MyFirstSub was to @RenaeCollects, joining her community lead to meeting lots of great friends and lots of fun times!
880214899879759873 2017-06-28 00:02:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar never too late
880104805758373888 2017-06-28 16:45:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby My assumption is that social media isn't the kind of reading and writing teachers want and/or dismiss it entirely.
879815773648285697 2017-06-27 21:36:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @Azurillkirby Cheesey, you just got "well technically"''d while arguing the technical semantics of crying "well technically"  Nice.
879803895786205184 2017-06-27 20:49:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Partnered streamers get ads on their streams, which earns them some revenue, while affiliates don't, that's at least one major difference
879716637116690432 2017-06-27 15:02:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG I think you'd look pretty great as mass destruction in human form, our boy Guzma
879544212072607751 2017-06-26 03:37:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ It's understandable, so you're fine. It's okay to step out if you don't feel comfortable, don't worry!
879529570738855936 2017-06-26 02:39:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> She is beautiful please summon her and then protect her but also protect your wallet
879438694599581696 2017-06-26 20:38:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> There are too many things wrong with this.https://twitter.com/xmeetsdarksouls/status/879422197445541888
879349791737643009 2017-06-26 14:45:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I aim to entertain so I'm glad I'm doing a decent job
879349261049245696 2017-06-26 14:42:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> LET ME LIVE MY LIFE
879345124907655170 2017-06-26 14:26:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Merry Birthmas, Cheesey! I hope you have a day just as awesome as you are (that means have a really really awesome day, k?)
879209957580734464 2017-06-25 05:29:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I appreciate the recharge, but not much beyond that. After 7 or so hours I'd rather do pretty much anything else
879208461279649792 2017-06-25 05:23:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> If bad or uneventful, I'll feel I wasted the day and I could've made it better So yeah sleep sucks, good night or something.
879208426894741504 2017-06-25 05:23:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Today I realized I will always despise sleep no matter what. If I have a good day, I won't want it to end
879198969833943040 2017-06-25 04:45:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I already liked WW, but I really gained more appreciation for it after replaying it just now, solid third favorite Zelda game now!
879198344610013184 2017-06-25 04:43:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> And something I didn't realize until now, Wind Waker's Zelda is definitely my favorite in the franchise, great incarnation of her character.
879197732170280960 2017-06-25 04:40:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wind Waker definitely has my favorite final boss of the Zelda franchise. The music, the battlefield, Ganondorf's last speech, good stuff
879145221078093824 2017-06-25 01:12:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's simple, but I love a gauntlet like that, I hope more Zelda games in the future/BotW do something like that again
879145076068417536 2017-06-25 01:11:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think my favorite "dungeon" in Wind Waker is the Savage Labyrinth. No puzzles or anything, just 50 floors of fighting enemies.
878857592499523584 2017-06-24 06:09:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity What no why rip don't do that unrip them
878857087283068928 2017-06-24 06:07:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I thought the answer to both of those was pretty apparent haha
878856334153830400 2017-06-24 06:04:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Look I just thought it was funny ok what are you implying
878849178243346432 2017-06-24 05:35:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I JUST THOUGHT "wow someone really just tweeted boobs with zero context or caption, that's funny" and why am I trying you won't believe me
878848685962145792 2017-06-24 05:33:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I THOUGHT IT WAS A FUNNY TWEEET ASFKJDSFLKAJDSFALKDJF
878842955410415616 2017-06-24 05:11:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I fear that beardless you is actually a completely separate and different person/personality than you so yeah you can't shave it
878755454402351104 2017-06-24 23:23:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> [watching Pokmon S/M] geez Rotomdex is so annoying, he's like that one friend who has to share trivia about everything & oh wait that's me
878741055688122369 2017-06-24 22:26:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Likes & RTs and such. "Twitter points" take less characters.  ...or so I assumed, cuz it actually doesn't. whatever
878663909565243394 2017-06-24 17:19:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Hope your day picks up, friend! Always wishing you the best!
878612070052265984 2017-06-24 13:53:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Takahata101 Now I hope the next ep starts with Cell still punching Gohan
878069897426763776 2017-06-22 01:59:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I JUST LIKE GOOD ART OKAY WHY DOES EVERYONE MAKE A BIG DEAL
878069422316847104 2017-06-22 01:57:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> wha
878065665135063040 2017-06-22 01:42:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar besafe
877993801222021120 2017-06-22 20:56:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry You look great!
877876860247457792 2017-06-22 13:12:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Woof
877635631467307009 2017-06-21 21:13:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity ORAS made me have doubts, but Sun/Moon showed me otherwise, so I get you. Glad I could help!
877634121790627840 2017-06-21 21:07:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity They have their hiccups, but Game Freak definitely knows what they're doing. Have faith in their abilities.
877633832882753536 2017-06-21 21:06:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity We know nothing about the game or its release In terms of burnout, I was afraid of that with S/M, but it was good enough to change my mind.
877633570486931456 2017-06-21 21:05:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Either way, I personally think it's nothing to worry about but, more accurately, it's way too early to worry.
877633420867674112 2017-06-21 21:04:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity And even during the yearly releases, the made some of the franchise's best games.
877632647270420480 2017-06-21 21:01:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Which is understandable. But, interestingly and imo, the worst main series games came when they stopped yearly releases (XY and ORAS)
877631461364441089 2017-06-21 20:57:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I don't think "2018" is rushing, considering how vague that is, it could be delayed, & development started early this year if not late last
877339996977541121 2017-06-20 01:38:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Yes. Tomorrow, however, skips straight to the evening
877252554136182784 2017-06-20 19:51:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Aw yeah! Wind Waker 100% let's go!! :D "slow & boring stealth mission" ok fine "luck based minigame you have to win 3 times"  ;efalasdfwe43e
877200662630629377 2017-06-20 16:25:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar "WHAT DOES IT NEED TO DO" "WHAT IS THIS"  You okay buddy
876989471501283328 2017-06-19 02:25:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @shenanigansen When you own them on wedding day, please please do so by making a comic about it.
876962323822522368 2017-06-19 00:38:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Infinitely funny to me that the people crying for remakes (which are a rehash of prior game) over new content are rehashing their complaints
876948395189055489 2017-06-19 23:42:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity like yeah it sucks they aren't friends I guess but not to be rude it doesn't really matter all that much. But that may be my apathy talking.
876948230747160576 2017-06-19 23:42:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Since it's so uncertain to know if fake, I wouldn't worry about it. Also let's be real, did anyone really keep up with D&J before now?
876947103683162112 2017-06-19 23:37:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I've heard Drake Bell in real life is an ass, so even if this is real this doesn't really surprise me.

876863527910334467 2017-06-19 18:05:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pm461 Glad I could help! :)
876854225220886529 2017-06-19 17:28:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pm461 So anyone in that red zone is in range of being attacked by Ephraim; pretty useful if you're worried about one or two specific enemy units
876853743899340800 2017-06-19 17:26:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pm461 Oh that, if you tap hold on an enemy, you can see their specific danger zone; the movement and attack range of that one, rather than all
876853124190830597 2017-06-19 17:24:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pm461 What specifically are you asking about?
876845097366761472 2017-06-19 16:52:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PersonaTrivia @fairy4prilP True, but they didn't touch their Personas from Feb 1 to Mar 31, two full months, same time as the P4 to P4A gap, yet theirs didn't revert
876824886127325185 2017-06-19 15:31:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PersonaTrivia So that idea might have some truth. Of  course, this kinda doesn't explain how SEES' Personas are still evolved, but those are canon
876824250862247936 2017-06-19 15:29:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PersonaTrivia months is pretty short for a "long period", whether or not max links is canon, Yu's Persona is just Izanagi, rather than Izanagi-no-Okami
876824054061309953 2017-06-19 15:28:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PersonaTrivia My assumption, and iirc they address this, evolved Personas revert back to normal after a long period without use. That being said, 2 or 3
876624020652871680 2017-06-18 02:13:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @2ToneDisco Please credit the original artist: @finalsmashcomic and maybe even link the original comic:https://twitter.com/finalsmashcomic/status/876196325087424513
876623080646422528 2017-06-18 02:10:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry OH NO haha quite the opposite actually probably should've been more specific on that one
876618200703696897 2017-06-18 01:50:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I guess if you like hair or not haha kinda just threw it in since I didn't know what else to put

876510313973153792 2017-06-18 18:41:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ Every once in a while it still bugs me mine username is a generic "AdjectiveCharacterNameNumbers" name haha glad you think it's rad tho
876509575532486658 2017-06-18 18:39:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ I tried, but I kinda sorta just a little almost got a bingo?pic.twitter.com/E2AsnOfYE9
876504669656424454 2017-06-18 18:19:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> So yeah this is actually in Japanese yen, not Chinese yuan (so it's about $90), apparently the two use the same symbol
876494053386448897 2017-06-18 17:37:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ZerrockCrisis Tho I just checked and 10000 yen comes to about $90 which is much much more reasonable (tho still to expensive for me currently haha)
876493940320591872 2017-06-18 17:36:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ZerrockCrisis tbh I'm not even sure, but I Google searched the conversion straight from the site and it came to yuan
876474205709242369 2017-06-18 16:18:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> You ever look at something you really want but way too expensive for you to get but you still really want it so you keep looking at it & crypic.twitter.com/9XLFZbGcoM
875726708321779713 2017-06-16 14:48:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Year ago me was right on the money haha
875584883673882626 2017-06-15 05:24:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> And, cuz Wynaut, here's (pretty much) every game I want to get sometime. Yeah, that's 47 games. Buy one game, add 5 more to the list hahaha!pic.twitter.com/bBdOfz8u0N
875581838491766785 2017-06-15 05:12:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> If curious on what I'm looking forward to, Super Mario Odyssey, Fire Emblem Warriors, and the rest of these. Hyped for SMO, MP4, & M+R most!pic.twitter.com/WEuRS6ADFl
875579953630150656 2017-06-15 05:05:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> This E3 has me hyped for 9 different games, & 6 will be out by the year's end! Needless to say, I loved #NintendoE3 this year, per usual!
875508736030380036 2017-06-15 00:22:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity If Spotlight was like an hour, then this discussion probably wouldn't exist.
875508562168086528 2017-06-15 00:21:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity It'd def help the game to get more focus in Spotlight, but with focus on new reveals and Odyssey's focus, 25 minutes only gives so much.
875508328088121345 2017-06-15 00:20:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity That's true, but remember the game will get marketing anyway. Advertising and such, so it's not like they'll never see the game.
875507548463431682 2017-06-15 00:17:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity including new "casual" ones thanks to FE Heroes.
875507529928892416 2017-06-15 00:17:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity you're most likely getting FEW cuz you're an FE fan or a W fan, and not sure about Warriors, but there are plenty of FE fans lately,
875507421933961216 2017-06-15 00:16:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Going back to the main point: FEW's sales, I don't think the effect will really be significant. I feel like with a Warriors game,
875506875567149057 2017-06-15 00:14:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity seeing more gameplay, they'll check it out. Of course that'd be more likely with "hardcore gamers" vs. "casual" E3 viewers/press.
875506845930147840 2017-06-15 00:14:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah, there's an understandable disconnect between Spotlight and Treehouse audience, but I feel if someone is genuinely interested in
875504324767617025 2017-06-15 00:04:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity And I get not everyone will do that, but Treehouse is part of the process to get people sold on their games.
875504308535558144 2017-06-15 00:04:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity If someone wanted to see more of FEW if the presentation didn't sell them, they can go to Treehouse Live.
875504268966547456 2017-06-15 00:04:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Speaking strictly on E3 presence then, that's what Treehouse Live is for: to show off gameplay, hear from developers, etc.
875503114727690240 2017-06-15 23:59:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity even tho I don't think that's an issue, but that could be just me.
875503067982180352 2017-06-15 23:59:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity deal to Nintendo as it is to other companies, Nin can show their stuff whenever they want, there's still time to show more by Directs
875502940362084352 2017-06-15 23:59:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I still don't think that's much of an issue, especially with a Warriors game, since most are very similar. Also remember, E3 isn't as big a
875501689662517248 2017-06-15 23:54:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity They didn't show it cuz, besides SMO they were mainly focusing on showing off new reveals, showing FEW gameplay better at Treehouse Live
875388740390309888 2017-06-15 16:25:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG I'm assuming you've been told this numerous times already, but I support any and all ideas for getting Persona 4 Golden, wonderful game!
875367070652923905 2017-06-15 14:59:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY ODYSSEY-YSSEY
875200923211096068 2017-06-14 03:58:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @teamfourstar @KaiserNeko @Clonetrooperkev https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/875127240115322881
875121531432689664 2017-06-14 22:43:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity and a plethora of other reasons. And I'm not even saying "like everything", I'm indifferent to Sushi Strikers, but I don't hate it.
875121507747364869 2017-06-14 22:43:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Cuz people want L I T E R A L L Y E V E R Y T H I N G to be tailored to their very very specific likes and desires, let hype get to them,
875120224068153345 2017-06-14 22:38:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity People on the Internet have always been entitled, but it's been peak levels since the Pokmon Direct, it's so annoying
875098600010809349 2017-06-14 21:12:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Also, Treehouse Live showed like 30 min of gameplay. Wasn't in showcase yeah, but Treehouse Live is where they show most gameplay
875096824377487360 2017-06-14 21:05:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Some others have multiple weapons too. tbh, it's way too early to worry, we haven't seen that much of the game yet
875096694697971715 2017-06-14 21:04:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Warriors games like to have large rosters. Hyrule Warriors had 31 (including DLC) and Link alone has 7 different weapons.
875095670604128258 2017-06-14 21:00:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I know lots of pll are concerned about this but remember: this is only the 1st gameplay we've seen, & they've already said not all swords
874743685090594816 2017-06-13 21:42:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo has/will be uploading VODs of Treehouse Live coverage! Even if you missed a segment, worry not! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2JiZAV5BmDXpTqlVuWg6GUQ78AGMRaj8
874733450519076865 2017-06-13 21:01:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore rip the wallet
874729739180797954 2017-06-13 20:46:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> (Motokura is Kenta Motokura, the game's director)
874729616996524032 2017-06-13 20:46:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT, there will be more than 120 Power Moons in Super Mario Odyssey. Oh yes, gimme all of the collectibles. This will be a huge adventure!pic.twitter.com/SEyskqMW2h
874715998359887876 2017-06-13 19:52:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've really been wanting a game to play as minions of the Koopa Troop tho, I love lots of Bowser's minions!
874715454438354946 2017-06-13 19:49:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not just same game with updated graphics and UI, but actually adding features and *story* to the game. That's how you do a remake!
874715200582057984 2017-06-13 19:48:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know u might be thinking I'm hypocritical, getting hyped for a remake, but with Bowser's Minions, this adds new story & gameplay mechanics
874714755516248065 2017-06-13 19:47:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> ALSO YES WE GET MORE OF FAWFUL I HAVE F U R Y
874713867749916674 2017-06-13 19:43:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> SO excited for this! Besides the fact that Paper Jam was disappointing, we not only get a good M&L again, but there's new story too!
874713613675765760 2017-06-13 19:42:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions!! A remake of the original but with added untold story where we play as Bowser's minions
874706814331473920 2017-06-13 19:15:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> If anyone knows of/finds a schedule for Treehouse Live, can they send it to me? Usually have one on their site but I can't see one now
874706501956403201 2017-06-13 19:14:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @S3APARTY I only want remakes solely cuz I'm unable/too expensive to play the old game, but nowadays? I'd rather Virtual Console release or somethin
874705284903706624 2017-06-13 19:09:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @S3APARTY So many people want remakes, remasters, reboots, and ports and I don't get it. Old stuff is great, but new content is so much better imo
874699522596884481 2017-06-13 18:46:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity It'd be fine going back, you can still make the UI nice and easy to use on one screen
874699424227831814 2017-06-13 18:46:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I'm not worried cuz this is Game Freak we're talking about. Instead of worrying, I'll let them figure it out. 1st 3 gens were single screen
874697992351215617 2017-06-13 18:40:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I'm not worried on that, but in comparison to everything else I was excited for, least hype for me (that is to say, others hyped me more)
874681775611674628 2017-06-13 17:36:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> So...if this isn't by Retro Studios, then 1. Who is working on this? 2. What is Retro Studios up to?!
874681580115111936 2017-06-13 17:35:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Retro Studios, the devs of the first 3 Primes, are already confirmed to be working on a (prior to today) unannounced project https://twitter.com/gameinformer/status/874680425230282754
874680299602550786 2017-06-13 17:30:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yep, #NintendoE3 is definitely my favorite time of the year. The whole year. Yes. Just so much excitement in just a few days! :D :D :D
874677634139136001 2017-06-13 17:19:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> With all the hype, I somehow missed you can combine Copy Abilities in the new Kirby Switch game!!! reminds me of Crystal Shards! HYPEHYPEHYP
874674863348359168 2017-06-13 17:08:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> SAMUS ARAN IS BACK #NintendoE3
874670311962234880 2017-06-13 16:50:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Super Mario Odyssey has original bosses. NEW BOSSES. New characters! :D
874666061857259521 2017-06-13 16:33:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Yeah I didn't expect to see it either. But there are still days of Treehouse Live so we *might* see it, but still doubt it
874665534163492864 2017-06-13 16:31:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just heard from Treehouse, Pauline, the original damsel in distress from Donkey Kong, is the *mayor* of New Donk City whoa
874664231895003136 2017-06-13 16:26:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man I love Nintendo. Man I love Nintendo. MAN I LOVE NINTENDO! This presentation was SO MUCH HYPE
874663891523035136 2017-06-13 16:24:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> ODYSSEEY LOOK S AMAZING AWESOME AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
874661431991521280 2017-06-13 16:15:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just need Anna confirmed as playable in #FireEmblemWarriors and I will be so happy
874660482480844802 2017-06-13 16:11:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> METROID PRIME 4 YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
874660317057486852 2017-06-13 16:10:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Alright you're getting Pokemon Switch now please stop complaining thanks
874659431128207360 2017-06-13 16:07:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> HELL YEAH KIRBY PARTNERS ARE BACK
874653697648865281 2017-06-13 15:44:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Aaaaaaah I'm getting excited How awesome is Odyssey gonna be? How many games will I get to add to me "Games I Need to Play" list Love E3! :D
874638029146771457 2017-06-13 14:42:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Even with my reminders, people are gonna complain anyway and we'll just have to deal with it. Meanwhile I'll be here having a blast
874636957426610176 2017-06-13 14:37:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> -You might not want a single game in Nintendo's presentation. Impressive, but don't get upset cuz they don't have anything YOU want
874636818398015489 2017-06-13 14:37:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> -We might not see much of USUM. And that's ok. For now. We'll obviously get more information later, but we still have 5 months before launch
874636644045004800 2017-06-13 14:36:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reminders -It's okay to be disappointed if the game you want coughAnimalCrossingcough doesn't get announced, but don't throw a hissy fit
874636582120280065 2017-06-13 14:36:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Sony alone had less than 10 min of talking & 60 minutes of nothing but games I'm picky and even I saw there's tons of games
874447423065772033 2017-06-12 02:04:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Most exciting thing was FFXV Fishing tho. Partially unironically.
874446965240717312 2017-06-12 02:02:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not a single thing interested me from #PlayStationE3  Was hoping for at least one more PS4 game to add to my list, but oh well. #E32017
874440016818298880 2017-06-12 01:35:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> FINAL FANTASY FiXhVing THE GAME WE DESERVE #E32017
874439855773765634 2017-06-12 01:34:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> HELL YEAH FISHING
874434799640989697 2017-06-12 01:14:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh boy. ANOTHER zombie apocalypse game. People don't really get tired of those, huh? #E32017
874370483516518400 2017-06-12 20:59:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Y'all are worrying about the 3DS getting the axe but you never could've predicted the Wii getting support in 2017
874364721994092546 2017-06-12 20:36:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh man, Grant Kirkhope?! That name is a sign we're gonna get a great soundtrack!https://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/874364472659410955
874361265623375877 2017-06-12 20:22:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> (Neglected to mention this but I mean the Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle game)
874359574261792769 2017-06-12 20:15:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> But overall, turn based, action, and strategy? Yeah, I definitely dig this.
874359243113189380 2017-06-12 20:14:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like how people are actually surprised this game is good. I get the worries, but this is why you don't just write it off immediately
874273646545702912 2017-06-12 14:34:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yo @Seven_Cubed it's your birthday so Merry Birthmas! You better have an awesome day, got it? :D
874097100832813056 2017-06-11 02:52:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Might peek at Sony's conference tomorrow, but I'll def be excitedly anticipating Nintendo's main event and Treehouse Live, we almost there!
874096900902879233 2017-06-11 02:51:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hopes (Not Expectations) for E3 2017  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1spupbs
874096729909538816 2017-06-11 02:51:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Seems like many either want or don't care for GS VC for very varied reasons, liked the results, thanks for indulging my curiosity haha
874028931497816064 2017-06-11 22:21:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how the next Life is Strange will top hipster teen dialogue like "Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah!" #E32017
873993879887982592 2017-06-11 20:02:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Thanks for sharing this to me, good ol' Jack Frost! :D
873918907467300864 2017-06-11 15:04:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait I figured it out! KH3 was never a game at all! KH3 is just steadily released trailers gradually revealing the entire story!
873908986470379521 2017-06-11 14:25:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kingdom Hearts 3 got a trailer today and I actually forgot that game isn't just a meme or joke but a video game actually in development haha
873603304722497537 2017-06-10 18:10:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo Ah, RIP indeed then D:
873603025998422016 2017-06-10 18:09:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo There's a press event starting in about an hour from what I've gathered
873417194255921153 2017-06-09 05:51:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Curious tho, does anyone else read with voices in their head or something to that effect?
873417056376557568 2017-06-09 05:50:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> This chapter has been weird to read so far cuz I haven't decided what voices to give Ruby and Sapphire in my head, an odd problem to have
873416893528510464 2017-06-09 05:49:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Related, but weird thing when I read anything, I read in voices. I tied a voice to what someone is saying in text. Helps immersion and focus
873416020668674048 2017-06-09 05:46:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> -well after the games come out, allowing for the mangaka to reference fan jokes/memes like these! Reason #3234535 I love this series!
873415736529747968 2017-06-09 05:45:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Starting reading Ruby & Sapphire chapter of Pokmon Adventures and poking at jokes like the hat hair is 1 reason I'm glad these are written-pic.twitter.com/TDUw0VTArr
873390578175758337 2017-06-09 04:05:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Especially now that FE is pretty much at peak popularity/success & it's still increasing. Crossover would make an excellent Conquest sequel
873389715919187969 2017-06-09 04:01:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Tons of people were really hyped for it upon reveal, it seemed to make more sense than the original plan, but we got TMS instead
873389457633837056 2017-06-09 04:00:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem are pretty similar in overall themes of bonds and companionship with others, so it looks great on paper
873389237839826944 2017-06-09 03:59:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Agreed. I hope that idea hasn't been completely tossed aside, cuz I still would really love it
873389142163501056 2017-06-09 03:59:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> But still being left with solid JRPG combat fun, then you basically got TMS
873389007778045952 2017-06-09 03:59:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> So if you're okay with dropping from both series' good plot, music (for most part), and characters,(latter being best part of Persona)
873387503079878656 2017-06-09 03:53:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> However, there is good I can say about it. The battle system is a ton of fun, lots and lots of skills to learn and mess around with
873387165522198528 2017-06-09 03:51:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also feels less of a Shin Megami Tensei x Fire Emblem crossover and more like an SMT game with FE characters, rather than a blend of the two
873386742656663557 2017-06-09 03:50:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Despite music focus, only has a few really good battle themes, plot is boring, characters are flat cardboard stereotypes played straight
873384428696993794 2017-06-09 03:40:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not done w/ Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE (fighting the final boss as this is being typed), but my overall opinion has been made: good not great
873333172070699008 2017-06-09 00:17:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain These people will tear their arms off if it helps them reach farther. They will "find" any "hint" possible, geez
873280488613523457 2017-06-09 20:47:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Super long term but I wanna cosplay as Joker eventually and I'm so glad Atlus makes it easy by making the outfit for us hahahttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/873279058506911744
873265884562935809 2017-06-09 19:49:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wish I could fit this cuz of character limit, but those who are excited, is it cuz of nostalgia or not, wanna see how much that's a factor
873265685639593987 2017-06-09 19:48:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Curious because HGSS are just vastly superior imo, so I have zero desire to play them
873265243941634048 2017-06-09 19:47:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Randomly curious, who's honestly excited for Pokmon Gold and Silver on VC? Want to specifically note if you still have HGSS or not.
872926939270582272 2017-06-08 21:22:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Getting excited for E3 means getting excited for getting excited. Not many expectations but so much potential I am hyped! :D
872848864184860672 2017-06-08 16:12:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick @djaysmaster50 @rhynold_collin Of course they will dev for the Switch, but peeps are crying for it waaaaay too soon
872846523779960832 2017-06-08 16:03:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick @djaysmaster50 Gonna be honest, I forgot about that haha But no these crazies want main series anything on Switch, no matter what it is, getting ridiculous
872842061149597697 2017-06-08 15:45:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick It's kinda baffling to me, feels like ppl just want a Pokmon Switch, they don't care what it is. Stars, USUM, don't matter, just on Switch
872591687926853632 2017-06-07 23:10:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 One of my fave things about FMA is that all major female characters are strong and awesome and well written SO THAT PERSON IS WRONG AND LAME
872498517935362049 2017-06-07 17:00:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity -confidence in their consistency. However, I'd be fine if they slowed down a bit like the break bw ORAS and Sun/Moon, I'd be fine with that.
872498496217255938 2017-06-07 17:00:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Considering Platinum through B2W2 were one year after another without a break and imo the best in the series (besides Sun/Moon), I have-
872481376427282433 2017-06-07 15:52:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Lots of Super Mario Odyssey footage
872211805850001411 2017-06-06 22:01:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> OH WAIT bu the best theme from B2W2 is the PWT Finals battle theme. Underrated, but tbh in my top 5 fave Pokmon battle themes
872211643933097984 2017-06-06 22:00:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love those too. I like Hugh's theme too tho it's been a while since I've heard it. Also like Ghetsis' theme. Too many good themes
872211367004168197 2017-06-06 21:59:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Dang mine would pretty much be the same  ...actually it is the same.
872206063877013505 2017-06-06 21:38:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> HGSS is just amazing music wise. Not just the themes used, but the soundfont itself  It's just...soooooo goooood
872205715544330240 2017-06-06 21:37:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Johto gym and champion theme, HGSS has it best, hands down
872201573123989505 2017-06-06 21:20:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG Persona 5, hands down.  ...sure, it's the only PS4 game I've played currently, but I doubt that'll change even if I play more!
872179326770401281 2017-06-06 19:52:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> That way I'll go back to being the type of person I like to talk to, instead of one who gets angry just cuz they vehemently disagree
872179102542950402 2017-06-06 19:51:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon of all things, huh. Either way, I'm getting too annoyed about this, think I'll get of social media and cool off for a bit.
872178975451340802 2017-06-06 19:50:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like to think I'm good at respecting people's opinions and staying level headed when discussing them. But definitely not today.
872166930827935746 2017-06-06 19:02:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon never gets old
872154478975356929 2017-06-06 18:13:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Original studio and creators working on this, live action series instead of movie, feeling pretty good about this now!https://twitter.com/Polygon/status/872109588933480449
872147955050065920 2017-06-06 17:47:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> More and better from them
872147896275267585 2017-06-06 17:47:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> It pisses me off way more than it should But yes, super thirsty. I *kinda* get why, but I just want more from Pokmon than that I guess
872147651730571264 2017-06-06 17:46:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> "but we already got that" "but it's not main series cuz we need a new main series on Switch right after Sun/Moon" [insert other complaints]
872147330404888576 2017-06-06 17:45:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @camldude67 I started with Pearl and loved it, and I'm the most vehemently against a DP remake. But many peeps who started then will want remakes still
872146752958328833 2017-06-06 17:42:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> yes because of course they are
872146704262463488 2017-06-06 17:42:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Granted, doing that for DP is iffy 3DS can't emulate DS, Wii U is dead, not sure how that'd work on Switch, but I'm sure they can find a way
872146473768677376 2017-06-06 17:41:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I played Platinum last year and it was still great, don't need a remake Also: there's a way to give that w/o remake: Virtual Console
872145416791478273 2017-06-06 17:37:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I always want new stories and content over rehashings I feel it's a problem in general, too many just want the same thing over and over
872144513657180160 2017-06-06 17:33:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't think I've ever seen people pine for a video game more than Gen IV remakes.  And it's not even memetic like with Hoenn Just annoying
872113618397143043 2017-06-06 15:31:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> A mini-rant, not just on Pokmon, but in general. On the last point tho, I'm sure some will think I'm not completely wrong.pic.twitter.com/tVtiz0RM9p
872111345268920320 2017-06-06 15:22:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar People are just stupid obsessed with wanting a Switch Pokmon game they don't care what it is just Switch Switch Switch
872105728093413376 2017-06-06 14:59:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TylerSederwall You're correct, it has never been done before, usually it's announced in May or sometime prior
872102091673743361 2017-06-06 14:45:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Dystify Already fixed:https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/872100968380411906
872101193245478913 2017-06-06 14:41:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PressL2P Just a mistake:https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/872100968380411906
872100047973961729 2017-06-06 14:37:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> They literally don't care what it is, as long as it's on Switch. Just calm down, we don't *need* a Switch game immediately or even next year
872099989144694784 2017-06-06 14:36:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lots of people are crying for a Pokmon Switch game, without caring about timing or 3DS compatibility or anything, it's kinda funny. Kinda
872095190017859585 2017-06-06 14:17:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hoping this is gonna be some alternate dimension/timeline/universe stuff. Now I'm getting excited!
872094911306354688 2017-06-06 14:16:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> OOOHHHHHH ULTRA LIKE ULTRA WORMHOLE
872094615456935937 2017-06-06 14:15:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gonna wait on what "alternate story" means. But I'm hoping more on the side of sequel/very different, rather than Emerald equivalent
872094060172935168 2017-06-06 14:13:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thoughts: Don't care for Pokkn "Ultra" is a dumb name but interested in "alternate" story Don't care for GS
872090431298744320 2017-06-06 13:58:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Feeling like such a spoilsport, speculation is a fun thing people enjoy, but it's actually bothering me, wow Stop being lame me, get over it
872088352912277504 2017-06-06 13:50:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar People will tear their arms off if it'll help them reach farther. By which I mean, they'll look for *anything* and use it as hard evidence
872087095594151936 2017-06-06 13:45:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda forgot what it's like for a bunch of people to be really excited for the one same event. It's neat.
871739160230371328 2017-06-05 14:43:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Sinnoh remakes" or "Sequel for [side series]"? I'm up for something new personally. If sequel to anything then Conquest
871736997630455809 2017-06-05 14:34:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon Direct, huh? Well time to avoid social media so all the theorizing doesn't annoy hahaha
871530778718478336 2017-06-04 00:55:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 Side note, in case you weren't aware, Bones also does My Hero Academia and, from what I've seen, they do amazing there too
871516844930113536 2017-06-04 23:59:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @calliemel29 I haven't even seen any of it yet, but from what I can tell?  Yes. Definitely yes.
871515860287934464 2017-06-04 23:55:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @calliemel29 Tone shift so heavy it pretty much shifted genres
871493929853624320 2017-06-04 22:28:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Geez, I've seen broken pipes that leak less than this game hahahahttps://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/871493676874084352
871406198569918464 2017-06-04 16:40:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Cheating by picking two, both Metroid and Fire Emblem would be amazing.
871222981212557313 2017-06-03 04:31:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I love how the media likes to use millennials as a scapegoat/reason for literally every problem instead of the problem's actual source.
870849523928621060 2017-06-02 03:48:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> TMS just feels soooooo bland and boring. I know I have to step down from my pedestal of expectations, but it's tough haha
870849493058469888 2017-06-02 03:47:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Got back into Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE and man is it hard to get back into after Persona 5. Compared to the life the P5 cast and world had
870481228025151489 2017-06-01 03:24:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar IS IT REALLY THO
870481123725393920 2017-06-01 03:24:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar what the hell is happening
870473014269288448 2017-06-01 02:51:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> inb4 ppl complain about Nintendo's online price of $20 a year, even tho a predicted ~$23 was seen earlier this year, so it's a *better* deal
869916496222343168 2017-05-31 14:00:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think 20 minutes might be the fastest time for me learning about a meme and getting tired/not liking said meme
869914709906116608 2017-05-31 13:53:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ok but...can we get full games instead? I'm sure the main devs are working alongside these but I'd rather a Switch Rumble to another mobilehttps://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/869799209045774336
869709335407939586 2017-05-30 00:17:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> (I know that's hard to do with Atlus' current policy, hopefully they'll get lax in time)  Just experience this glorious game
869708654601134080 2017-05-30 00:14:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> My thoughts are all over the place so I'll have to organize them later but overall: if you don't play #Persona5 at least try to watch it
869708286441865217 2017-05-30 00:13:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> The issues especially feel real because they are real. It's easy to relate to because they're some a lot of us are going through.
869708257719238656 2017-05-30 00:13:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Playing #Persona5 has honestly been the greatest video game experience I've ever had. Its world, people, & issues feel so real
869704440315387904 2017-05-30 23:57:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's been an incredible, wonderful, amazing journey. But I have won the game. I love this game, its characters, and just everythingpic.twitter.com/wWkJpwNbqR
869390316465467392 2017-05-29 03:09:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> (by gush I mean a spoiler free love letter/twitlonger thing)
869390061908918272 2017-05-29 03:08:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Related, I'm almost finished and this game is my new favorite video game of all time and I'm gonna gush about it so look forward if you care
869386689827016704 2017-05-29 02:55:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> But it's fine tho. Hard difficulty gives that sweet spot of a good challenge that I want. Brutal, but enjoyable, really have to strategize
869386017664643072 2017-05-29 02:52:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I already don't as much money as I'd love to have with 1x, can't imagine only getting 40% of it
869385634951114752 2017-05-29 02:51:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Damage dealt and received are the same (0.8x and 1.6x, respectively), so it really just makes the game the not fun kind of required grindy
869385362518495232 2017-05-29 02:49:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeeeeeeah, I'm not playing Merciless. Only difference between it and Hard are 0.4x exp and money and critical and technical damage x3
868959473355948033 2017-05-28 22:37:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon GAH ULTRA WORMHOLES MAKE THINGS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED!! I love it, but we don't know enough about them to have solid evidence on a lot now
868957754622447616 2017-05-28 22:30:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @FloralSerenity Bonding was fused in ORAS, and Sun/Moon is about 10+ yrs. after, not sure what the 30 years business is all about, weird.
868957604445392897 2017-05-28 22:30:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @FloralSerenity As for Mr. Bonding, the one created in ORAS and the one in XY are about 8 yrs apart, but they could be the same man
868957144774828036 2017-05-28 22:28:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @FloralSerenity Sun/Moon is set 2 years after B2W2XY, Grimsley is said to be 2 yrs older than then in his S/M concept art.
868891723501535232 2017-05-28 18:08:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity There's a special cutscene in Haina Desert, not the altars:http://www.siliconera.com/2017/01/26/using-pokmon-bank-transfer-solrock-lunatone-will-unlock-special-scene-pokmon-sun-moon/
868891270642585601 2017-05-28 18:06:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Also, imo, I'm glad they didn't do a thing for them, would be pretty forced imo
868891184302878720 2017-05-28 18:06:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity iirc, something happens when you take them to the Altars of Sunne/Moone
868511377375285248 2017-05-27 16:57:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon She looks great and I like the backstory you wrote too!
867740090109501442 2017-05-25 13:52:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I wish Dragon Ball's Senzu Beans existed. One bean fills you up for 10 days, would save a lot of time from making and eating food
867403181256577025 2017-05-24 15:33:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> This has definitely already been written off by many people, but I'm gonna see how this turns out to be like in a few weeks
867402847540916225 2017-05-24 15:32:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> I also love how aware Nintendo is of this very very strange crossover, so one of their crucial steps is convincing us "but wait it's good"pic.twitter.com/DOaAe1PMyD
867402370652798981 2017-05-24 15:30:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sticks out that the word "ass" is written in official Nintendo, normally super kid friendly content, twice.pic.twitter.com/chSRcowf72
867401876257603584 2017-05-24 15:28:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reading the info on this, starting to get down on this idea. Very bizarre and strange, but don't hate it.https://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/867397946291109888
867182481526730753 2017-05-23 00:56:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Even Futaba says "Whoa Joker, looking cool!"  IT NEVER ENDS JOKER IS NEVER FREE BUT HE WAS, IS, AND ALWAYS WILL BE L O O K I N NG C OOLOLL
867181672936112128 2017-05-23 00:53:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar 
867077165166321669 2017-05-23 17:58:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> How you know a story is really good: how many times you find yourself saying/thinking "Holy shit."
866674313147162624 2017-05-22 15:17:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I think this was a good wake up call for a lot of ppl. Then again, it's easy for people to stop caring when it's not threatening their lives
866408231316410368 2017-05-21 21:39:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> [playing Persona 5] Just one more day I'll just do this then I'm done I'll just take care of this first just one more day just 1 more thing
866145438155632641 2017-05-20 04:15:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> When? Today. ...that's kinda what birthdays indicate.  Pretty sure. either way Merry Birthmas you did good making this far good luck
866125913267851264 2017-05-20 02:58:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> I watched Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! (Konosuba) and I enjoyed it! A fun deconstructive parody of RPG/video game style anime
866117377376833536 2017-05-20 02:24:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's not just a game to me, it's an experience, and it's definitely a wonderful one!  (sorry for random Persona obsession ramblings haha)
866117128151281665 2017-05-20 02:23:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hard to explain in few characters and you might not fully understand if you don't play But I truly feel apart of what's going on.
866116718611091458 2017-05-20 02:21:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's something different about P5, even tho I relate more to P4's protag than P5's, I think and make decisions as if I'm the P5 protag
866116332089159680 2017-05-20 02:19:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> When I normally watch or play something, feel like an outsider watching a story take place, can't fully connect but can still enjoy
866115168291434496 2017-05-20 02:15:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just love this game sooooooo much. It's amazing, I just can't get enough of it!! :D
866114627939250177 2017-05-20 02:13:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never been so invested in anything more than Persona 5. I spend a lot of my time not playing thinking about the story and characters
865715468887347200 2017-05-19 23:47:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA About 57 in so far; I have a lot to go still, and I already have plans for New Game+
865392943380561920 2017-05-18 02:25:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT just made me realize there's probably gonna be a P5 musical and oh boy ahahahahaha

865229074016415745 2017-05-18 15:34:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @justinloverchio @TheJWittz @RenaeCollects @JimmyWhetzel @S3APARTY what did I miss
864886860723695617 2017-05-17 16:54:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Maybe I should change my strategy/not fight this encounter  *does nothing different from previous attempts, continues dying* hmm
864886564454883328 2017-05-17 16:53:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> The more I play Hard difficulty Persona 5, the more I fear Merciless  I have died many times  Atlus is brutal. Very very brutal
864854900970225664 2017-05-17 14:47:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I feel like it's pretty good; to me it feels like people are actively looking for flaws and exaggerating how flawed it is.
864546170210832384 2017-05-16 18:20:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> the former are really great/some of the best imo but seems like at the sacrifice of a good ED, even tho the 2 aren't usually the same group
864545447335145472 2017-05-16 18:17:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's weird tho, Mob Psycho, One Punch Man, JJBA, and others have awesome OPs bit forgettable EDs. Kobayashi and Gab have both good but
864535393965940736 2017-05-16 17:37:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda related, Kobayashi's Dragon Maid's OP "Aozora no Rhapsody" and ED "Ishukan Communication" are also great, dragon VAs as singers too!
864533782346518528 2017-05-16 17:31:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also has goodo OP and ED "Gabriel DropKick" and "Hallelujah Essaim", really like songs where the anime's cast are the singers.
864532904185090050 2017-05-16 17:28:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gabriel DropOut was another nice cute girls slice of life anime, really enjoyed it. Never thought I'd enjoy SoL genre so much but I do haha
864298553417633794 2017-05-15 01:56:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon INCREDIBLE VALOR RESPECTABLE MUSCLES
864134406067433472 2017-05-15 15:04:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Oh yeah but, still generalizing here, people care so much about appearances/that kinda stuff they'll spend more for it
864133953099366400 2017-05-15 15:02:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Massive over generalization, but they may just think "house is/makes me better than apartment people", for whatever reason of superiority.
863987433247047683 2017-05-14 05:20:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Enjoyable anime so far, btw, have been in a "funny cute girls" anime kinda mood and Gabriel DropOut hits that pretty well haha
863987100823244800 2017-05-14 05:19:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> [productive days] You: worked at job, watered my crops & bought an orphanage  Me: I played P5 for 8 hours & watched 5 eps of Gabriel DropOut
863779442421895170 2017-05-14 15:34:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid was a great anime, I really enjoyed, very cute and lots of fun!
863739716348334080 2017-05-14 12:56:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's still a very solid game but I just want to put my time to better things. Oh well.
863739357873799168 2017-05-14 12:54:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've rapidly lost interest in FE Heroes bc anytime spent playing that is time that could be spent playing Persona 5 or any other thing
862863814936727558 2017-05-11 02:55:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I might need to watch this showhttps://twitter.com/FizzySodaWave/status/862408496322666496
862826815353753600 2017-05-11 00:28:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Have you ever seen a character in a media and quietly, but audibly gasped?
862667446930558976 2017-05-11 13:55:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished JJBA Stardust Crusaders last night, besides a few minor complaints with the final four eps, I really enjoyed it!
862491942281773057 2017-05-10 02:17:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SoCassandra YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME I HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO DO
862423679816302592 2017-05-10 21:46:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm talking one shot by regular enemies hard, but tbf, I'm like 5-7 levels lower. Can only imagine what Merciless difficulty is like
862423073512976387 2017-05-10 21:44:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> 11 hrs into Persona 5 has shown that choosing Hard difficulty makes the game quite hard, died quite a few times, not even done w 1st dungeon

862170981217038336 2017-05-09 05:02:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> This battery issue started with playing Moon back in December (and I haven't even played it much since then) but it's gotten much worse now
862170691155755008 2017-05-09 05:01:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3DSmall, launch year, got it in August 2011
862168947822665729 2017-05-09 04:54:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> My fully charged 3DS playing Awakening didn't even last an hour before it got low battery, looks like I'll be needing that 2DSXL sooner

861602105269858304 2017-05-08 15:22:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> So whatever challenges come your way, just know that I believe you can overcome them but make sure you know that you can overcome them!
861601460471123969 2017-05-08 15:19:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> These tweets the past few days have mostly been to keep me in check so I don't fall to my anxiety & now I feel I'm in a good place now!

861068757858484224 2017-05-06 04:02:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby yes, you figured it out, you win everything

861064243365498880 2017-05-06 03:44:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Full disclosure: I settled for Gaius cuz that day had none of my waifus, I missed the day with Faye tho D:

860959228890099714 2017-05-06 20:47:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MaxMittelman @Brittanica24 Technically, Squirtle's species name is "Tiny Turtle" So that's "Turtle" vs. "Tiny Turtle"  Also Squirtle can evolve, better choice.
860952022350221312 2017-05-06 20:18:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin NG+ makes it easier, since you can carry over your social stats, but in P3 and P4 as well, unlikely to max all 1st run without guide
860951688781455360 2017-05-06 20:17:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Unless you meticulously plan the entire year, you're not really expected to max all social links first run through.
860915791570620416 2017-05-06 17:54:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can never listen to this ever again unless it's this specific version, please ear f9r yourselfhttps://youtu.be/vxhGmccKKEk
860596456197156868 2017-05-05 20:45:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> This also reminded me Klonoa has a movie in the works and I'm probably the one person who cares about this series but it still excites me :D
860596342732840960 2017-05-05 20:45:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> At this point we prolly won't get a re-release of the sequel, which is one of my fave childhood games, but need to pick this one up sometimehttps://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/860595789785165825
860592753062928389 2017-05-05 20:31:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> People shouldn't have to compete or define "validity". Everyone is valid. No matter what. That's it.
860591737936457729 2017-05-05 20:27:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> With all the shit the LGBT community faces already, I used to think the same they all supported each other as well, thought they were better

860117987780636673 2017-05-04 13:04:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, buying most the same game again with some added features at full price? We talking about MK8 or Pokmon Emerald and Platinum?
860117525757034496 2017-05-04 13:02:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pretty good deal for those who didn't get it on Wii U initially, and that's not even including the extra characters
860117311105241089 2017-05-04 13:02:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> You know, MK8 + $11 DLC would be $71. Include battle mode, say $10 for simplicity, $81 game sold at $60, if u wanna look at it that way
859965980054892544 2017-05-03 03:00:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Following up to the greatness of Conquest while crossing over with FE'S awesomeness would be taking out two pegasus knights with one arrow!
859965670036996096 2017-05-03 02:59:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> characters and setting, and would be much easier for the FE side to still be prominent.
859965634221920257 2017-05-03 02:59:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tokyo Mirage Sessions felt like 15% FE than a full blend of the two but Conquest sequel keeps the tactical gameplay, already has established
859964436555157504 2017-05-03 02:54:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've talked about this before but I just realized, a great way to make a sequel to Pokmon Conquest would be a crossover with Fire Emblem :Ohttps://twitter.com/didyouknowgamin/status/859945554847162370
859897087630168066 2017-05-03 22:26:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Sun/Moon anime looks good but should I watch, I do have tons of others to Smarter me: Gladion's battle theme will get remixed MUSTWATCH

859513846821728256 2017-05-02 21:04:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Yeah every major FE character in TMS is already in Heroes, but seeing super anime Japanese idols in main line FE sounds hilarious ahahahaha
859512771825860610 2017-05-02 20:59:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda doubt we'll see TMS, but even the FE Cipher trading card series has TMS cards, so who knows
859512468254707713 2017-05-02 20:58:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Granted, one is a satellite radio game you prolly can't play & other is a crossover that's more Shin Megami Tensei than FE but still haha

859179953866379264 2017-05-01 22:57:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Good luck, ganbatte, do your best, and I hope you do well! :D
859102435163459586 2017-05-01 17:49:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> But, it allows me to connect more to the situation. Before, I could still enjoy it, but I felt separated from it I guess?
859102001858269185 2017-05-01 17:47:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tense moments in an anime make me tense up, emotional moments are a lot more relatable, it's kinda weird.
859101948833878016 2017-05-01 17:47:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> After/while experiencing anxiety for the first time, enjoying other media kinda becomes a whole new experience.
858900336689414145 2017-04-30 04:26:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> But, they're pretty unremarkable, the phrase just rhymes. So if someone tells you you're the bee's knees, means you're pretty ordinary
858900138252783616 2017-04-30 04:25:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> You've prolly heard the phrase "the bee's knees" In case you were wondering: yes, bees do in fact have knees
858799597602385920 2017-04-30 21:45:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I think about the fact that the Pope has a copy of Undertale but I don't
858727389291008000 2017-04-30 16:58:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @BrinkOfMemories I would definitely like to see that, yes!

858370962563248128 2017-04-29 17:22:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar He can't even grab things he just touches them and they stick to the nubs I guess yeah they're pretty weird
858370600263397377 2017-04-29 17:21:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar wha Joe he doesn't even have arms just lil nubs
858126250778521601 2017-04-28 01:10:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I also hope you yell ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA like Star Platinum does, it actually helps
858126011795460101 2017-04-28 01:09:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's just about finals time, so I hope you guys mercilessly beat down your finals like Jotaro's Stand, Star Platinum, beat up this dude. :Dpic.twitter.com/EOnJ59wjka

857825009166942208 2017-04-27 05:13:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> But everyone should do it cuz apparently if we get enough we get free stuff and that's always good

857699411333455872 2017-04-27 20:54:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I could definitely use more, preferably video game music cuz that's really my jam

857698524116377600 2017-04-27 20:50:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> What music do you guys listen to to calm down? I've been having anxiety lately and I listen to too many boss themes, think I need a change

857384641375895552 2017-04-26 00:03:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3 art pieces of Riza Hawkeye, one of Sumia, and one of Amethyst.  Alternatively, 7 art pieces of Riza Hawkeye Yes. Not 5, 7.
857354930570629120 2017-04-26 22:05:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Thank you! 
857353264832147456 2017-04-26 21:58:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> but I really have no choice but to keep going and figure everything out so, hopefully, that's what I'll do.
857353236877017088 2017-04-26 21:58:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sorry about all these vague tweets lately I've just really been in a mood lately and it's been getting worse have been scared and confused
857337682514628608 2017-04-26 20:56:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just 12 more days then I'm finally free, at least for a short while just gotta make it through 12 more days then hopefully I'll be ok again
857084554716348417 2017-04-25 04:10:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't remember when or where I read it but it sounds right If there's 2 things humanity really likes to b as good as possible it's those 2
857083730665590786 2017-04-25 04:07:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I guess they always will be evolving then. kinda weird to think about
857083607294332928 2017-04-25 04:07:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I feel like I read some weird random fun fact that the first things to take utilize latest technological advances are porn and military
857083365647953921 2017-04-25 04:06:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Little over a year ago I aimlessly thought I knew what I was doing w my life Having that security & certainty was nice. I'd like that again.
857042009101676544 2017-04-25 01:21:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> This theme "Kakero the Bluff" is pretty much "Stardust Crusaders" with some added beats and it's just amazing, fave theme on the OST so far
857041627189268480 2017-04-25 01:20:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just when I thought the music "Stardust Crusaders" couldn't be topped, the D'Arby fight pulls out this awesomenesshttps://youtu.be/Rn40diTI0sk
856962020222095360 2017-04-25 20:04:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Very few that I can remember ever do, I was surprised it was even possible in a sense. A lot of mine are pretty weird too tho
856960434968158208 2017-04-25 19:57:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> One that note tho, does anyone else's dreams have continuity? Few of mine do and it's interesting to see how the story will continue
856960083770699781 2017-04-25 19:56:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess that explains who. I'm thinking the why is to mess up Mario,  so I guess that all checks out haha
856958330841038848 2017-04-25 19:49:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd like your help to cheer up Halloween How many of you would hang out with them, I can tell them when I go back into that dream continuity
856957982659284992 2017-04-25 19:47:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I had a dream that Halloween (represented by a person) was sad no one liked them but Christmas reassured them everyone liked them
856955390432595968 2017-04-25 19:37:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Speaking of Bowser, this reminded me that Bowser's castle also renovates in every game too, wonder who King Koopa's designers are?https://twitter.com/Stupid_Pokenerd/status/856945879516942343
856923734267109377 2017-04-25 17:31:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I feel those are the only 1s where there's some consistency, but even then, in 64 it was just some empty land vs. a town/city in PM & Galaxy
856921097798922241 2017-04-25 17:21:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed That's a lotta dimensions, but a good explanation.
856732163957563392 2017-04-24 04:50:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also the ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA is waaaaay better in sub and that's really the most important part
856731929600720896 2017-04-24 04:49:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Watching the sub cuz that's the easier one to watch Also I've heard some of the dub voices and eh only good one imo is Patrick Seitz's DIO
856730458687758336 2017-04-24 04:43:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Stardust Crusaders is really good, my fave part so far (and I'm not even done), Jotaro *might* even beat Joseph as best JoJo Maybe.
856730012598317060 2017-04-24 04:42:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pretty much everyone there is freaking out, even I got really into it, one of the best battles in the series imo
856729525991997440 2017-04-24 04:40:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Jotaro being a smart badass always gives me a giant grin on my face Jotaro vs. D'Arby was an amazing treat. Best Part 3 ep by far (so far).
856707267273641984 2017-04-24 03:11:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> I only really saw one or two clips here and there but today I saw a collection of them and EVERY SCRIPT WRITE AND VA NEEDS A RAISE
856706563406528516 2017-04-24 03:08:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then how come you NEVER TOLD ME HOW HILARIOUS IT IS Also watch it again
856695393056428032 2017-04-24 02:24:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> I need to watch Ghost Stories and you do too
856682697640554497 2017-04-24 01:34:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> For now, I'm going with some really talented Toads that take the concept of Extreme Home Makeover & take it to the Mushroom Kingdom extreme
856681986215301121 2017-04-24 01:31:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder what the canonical explanation is for why Peach's castle and the entire Mushroom Kingdom is redesigned in every game.

855961112164147200 2017-04-22 01:46:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore Then did you *really* beat it 
855960468434845696 2017-04-22 01:44:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore but did you get all the Korok seeds
855926342352764931 2017-04-22 23:28:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Golbat's body is almost all mouth it's kinda hilarious
855924402122366976 2017-04-22 23:20:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @NaishoTsubomi Far from it, lots of people are hyped. I'm probably one of few who don't want Sinnoh remakes haha
855893798836203528 2017-04-22 21:19:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then again, GF subverted many expectations with Sun/Moon, so I have hope whatever is next, even if Sinnoh related, will be good.
855893553863675904 2017-04-22 21:18:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> They don't have to be remakes. If we have to return to Sinnoh, could just have a new story As long as it's not the boring, predictable route
855892975821434880 2017-04-22 21:16:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I guess that'd be a little weird with the mascot legendaries, but hey they could just shake things up, that'd be neat
855891627017211904 2017-04-22 21:10:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then I GUESS that'd be acceptable
855891581794209792 2017-04-22 21:10:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's kinda just a waste otherwise, but I know GF wants the sell two games, so if they just make two versions but with Platinum's content
855891449862377474 2017-04-22 21:09:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I still hate the idea of Gen IV remakes, if they do get made, I'd much prefer them to be a remake or Platinum instead
855853695317286912 2017-04-22 18:39:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> The "song" this Dugtrio is singing is the Pok Ride theme, that's pretty great hahahttps://twitter.com/pancakeparadox/status/855061727582539779
855583256917544961 2017-04-21 00:45:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> This anime was a blast, I really enjoyed it, so it's really too bad it didn't do well at all and the whole series got the axe because of ithttps://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/status/855580906911707136
855578360323465216 2017-04-21 00:25:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't know how many JJBA fans follow me, but curious: best OP of first 4? I mostly mean the song itself but you can count the animation too.
855576787216158721 2017-04-21 00:19:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Can't wait to hear "JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku ~end of THE WORLD~" in full, have a feeling it'll take 2nd or even 1st over OP 2 "Bloody Stream"
855576554025385984 2017-04-21 00:18:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> I had a similar first impression with OP 3 "Stand Proud", but now it's my second fave JJBA OP.
855575763369766916 2017-04-21 00:15:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me hearing JJBA OP 4 "~end of THE WORLD~" for the 1st time: eh, ok.  Me the 8th time: KUHAKU NO RASUTO PAGE NI SONO KOBUSHI WO TATAKIKOME!!
855551841630920704 2017-04-21 22:40:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not quite sure how to put it, but kinda like "we didn't need to respect them before, but hey now we should" or something like that
855551533735452674 2017-04-21 22:39:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> My other issue with the headline that it kinda comes off as reluctance I guess? Or like "okay, I GUESS we should respect ppl"
855507745323307008 2017-04-21 19:45:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar @CheeseyPokemon NANI THERE'S TWO OF THEM

855479833756921857 2017-04-21 17:54:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> In case anyone doesn't know about this game 1. It exists. 2. Its boss theme is sick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjtl6MY7UEohttps://twitter.com/JoeMerrick/status/855462881160302592

855106754774020098 2017-04-20 17:11:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also MP3 has some sick boss fight themes, won't link cuz spoiler titles, but first and third in a trio of major bosses have awesome themes
855106276992446464 2017-04-20 17:09:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been listening to a lot of the Metroid Prime trilogy OST lately & it's really good, give this track your earshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPOIX7g2kQE&t=15s
854875164961640450 2017-04-19 01:51:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Yes, the crust to that perfect softness, success!" -Me, once again thinking about the frozen pizza I warmed as if I actually made it
854869770960875520 2017-04-19 01:30:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin My cat did something similar: started giving her wet food for a bit but she eventually stopped, content with her dry, so it's not abnormal.

854798641181151232 2017-04-19 20:47:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The overall gist is the allow subs give more support, while also making it easier for partners to grow
854798260770308098 2017-04-19 20:46:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity That's about the gist of it I think
854798186921197568 2017-04-19 20:45:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Partners also get 50 tiers for unlocking emotes, vs. the previous 14
854798115060187137 2017-04-19 20:45:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity There will be higher tiers where you can pay 10-30 a month vs. the standard 5, allowing for more optional benefits
854742577307897856 2017-04-19 17:04:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sonic_hedgehog I've been waiting for this

854118215777169408 2017-04-17 23:43:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @discordapp Taking Your Heart
854083086484742144 2017-04-17 21:24:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is a great trilogy of games, only $20, recommend if you like mystery visual novels. (pretty sure this game is digital only in the US)https://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/854077431581462529
853781688861818882 2017-04-16 01:26:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Afternoon Break" is also really similar to "Joy" so I guess the conclusion here is that the entire OST is arranged around "Memories of You"
853781194558844934 2017-04-16 01:24:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well I guess, by proxy, "Joy" is partially yet another arrangement of "Memories of You" since "Memories of the School" is as well.
853780413260627969 2017-04-16 01:21:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Somehow I only just realized "Memories of the School" from P3 is also a somber arrangement of "Joy", the social link theme w h a t
853738822387027973 2017-04-16 22:36:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy I'm holding you to this
853641140578340868 2017-04-16 16:08:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's the phrase "easier said than done" but what's something easier done than said? 
853476362291687424 2017-04-15 05:13:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Those are pretty weird haha but also at least sound interesting to think about.
853471551756394496 2017-04-15 04:54:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon holy shit I never considered that wow thank you so much
853470561128919040 2017-04-15 04:50:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon dang that's much more productive thinking mine are like "what if your girlfriend died" I'd be devastated, but I remind myself I have no gf
853468231591497729 2017-04-15 04:40:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I imagine/think about hypothetically really depressing scenarios, I don't know why.  Don't do that. Think about happy good things.
853435260767539200 2017-04-15 02:29:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo That corgi is made steel, got willpower harder than steel, and will mess you up
853341399487533056 2017-04-15 20:16:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was definitely still delicious  also wow how did these wizards know what pizza brand I'm eatinghttps://twitter.com/DiGiornoPizza/status/853339938208837632
853337092776235009 2017-04-15 19:59:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Crust isn't that nice softness, a tad crispy, not my best work." -Me, thinking about the frozen pizza I warmed as if I actually made it
853116654804488192 2017-04-14 05:23:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you like laughs, feels, and slice of life, watch CLANNAD
853116575326588928 2017-04-14 05:23:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I like to get some good laughs & watch clips of CLANNAD Sometimes I like to mess myself up emotionally and watch clips of CLANNAD
853072280917856257 2017-04-14 02:27:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 4 protag's future is left pretty ambiguous at series end but he'd prolly get a job in economics cuz y'know He's a master of bonds
853061334124154880 2017-04-14 01:44:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then again, I've never verbally said "OVA" to someone, only in my head, so I guess it doesn't matter, interesting I shorten it for myself
853060947958784001 2017-04-14 01:42:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I actually say "oh vah" cuz I'm weird but it's faster than saying "oh vee ayy" So I guess I'm the weird one out here haha
852917263451795457 2017-04-14 16:11:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> *prof who's always 10-13 min late comes in 5 min late* Me: wow he's early *prof sits at desk, on his phone for 5 min before starting*  k

852687538959601665 2017-04-13 00:58:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> The I did a roll I forgot to screenshot with only a 3* green, I get hopeful with this set only for it to not deliverpic.twitter.com/2hoHL7B7Ra
852687094757642240 2017-04-13 00:57:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> First I couldn't even see any greens, appreciate the Eirika, but I just got the blues and bailed, nothing else of notepic.twitter.com/uq16tz20Sc
852686346565058561 2017-04-13 00:54:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was so excited to hopefully get Spring!Camilla or at least Spring!Lucina that I bought 43 orbs and got to summoning The results?

852517956907085826 2017-04-13 13:44:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu I got excited when I saw it wasn't a 3* but nah Just Arthur
852513760724090886 2017-04-13 13:28:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I also can't really complain about this summon so at least that was good
852513616658141184 2017-04-13 13:27:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've reached the tipping point. Tonight I bring back the pentagram I WILL SUMMON THEE, CAMILLA!!pic.twitter.com/cNWicSjf6X

852343555590959105 2017-04-12 02:11:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Doesn't look like this collection has Pac-Mania tho, that's my fave classic game. Love the visuals, music, and difficulty ramps up fast
852342148418633731 2017-04-12 02:06:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have two Namco Museum collections for PS2 but PS consoles don't have backwards compatibility anymore so now I'll never be able to play 'em
852341506644074496 2017-04-12 02:03:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sailorbee I think we all do.
852341412263866369 2017-04-12 02:03:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Whoa Namco Museum?! I get why no one really talked about this but this is my jam, I definitely gotta get this, love classic Namco games!https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/852287217611415552

852319290124627968 2017-04-12 00:35:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @harharharmony Vanilla ice cream is only good when it goes along something like warm pie But at that point just eat the pie with better ice cream.

850873265736364032 2017-04-08 00:49:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Remember old antenna TVs and you had to reposition them to get signal? Imagine that but worse since the headphone wires bounce when you walk
850872093004754944 2017-04-08 00:44:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> My left headphone wire is dying/only works if positioned in a certain way & it's pretty much the worst thing intelligent life can experience
850847968395702277 2017-04-08 23:08:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Number 1 has to be the death so memetic, a figure was made of it.pic.twitter.com/hmMl2V8hNk
850815916447322113 2017-04-08 21:01:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I dunno, Charizard will always have nostalgia behind them. And you can't blame 'em, Charizard is pretty awesome (as is Lucario)
850762743711977473 2017-04-08 17:30:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Uhh it looks like a mix of both hahaha or a really really dark blue, but I'm pretty sure it's black
850752898082508800 2017-04-08 16:51:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3 male Morgan cards, 2 female and they look GREATpic.twitter.com/u3kIFhbcEg
850747871972519936 2017-04-08 16:31:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> This series features characters from the whole series tho, even Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE (the crossover with Shin Megami Tensei)
850747256831692802 2017-04-08 16:28:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> For any who don't know, that's female Robin, female Morgan, Anna, and Tharja. All from Awakening Can you tell what one FE I've played haha
850746355526119424 2017-04-08 16:25:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fun Fact: In Japan, there is a trading card game "Fire Emblem 0 (Cipher)" and the cards look A M A Z I N G They look soooooo coooooolpic.twitter.com/DaPdLs2cja
850737698142859264 2017-04-08 15:50:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Saw this last night, scheduled it for now so more peeps would see it BUT THE JUKER DELETED IT WHAT
850735738043875328 2017-04-08 15:43:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is actually spot on accurate. whoa. https://twitter.com/jonnysun/status/850579364853018625
850475458923831297 2017-04-07 22:28:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain Blocking them isn't rude if they're bothering you, especially if they're making you feel uncomfortable, that's what the feature is for.
850423460304216066 2017-04-07 19:02:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't believe in that idea but it's an interesting thing to think about I guess. I dunno I'm weird.
850423375386345472 2017-04-07 19:01:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you're wondering where that came from, I've been taking two philosophy classes and they make you think a lot haha
850423242821177345 2017-04-07 19:01:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> wha but ...okay.
850422235261218822 2017-04-07 18:57:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then, my friend, become a you that you'd be okay with other people being.
850421268474204160 2017-04-07 18:53:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> The moral of this (that I'm coming up with just now) is that we're all one soul to be nice to everyone cuz everyone is you
850420716583387136 2017-04-07 18:51:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> But the catch is there's only one soul so you meet your past and future lives in every life so life is just one soul interacting with itself
850420577571663872 2017-04-07 18:50:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I imagine that when you die your soul gets reincarnated but it can be reborn in a different time in a different person, forever
850408159080587265 2017-04-07 18:01:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz This is really hard. REALLY hard. But I think just ever so barely, Anna.
850354655443996672 2017-04-07 14:28:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PersonaFans This makes me extremely happy.
850333569570541569 2017-04-07 13:04:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT I don't even play or watch Yu-Gi-Oh! and I really want to do that someday ahahahahaha
850329854436397056 2017-04-07 12:50:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MagicRealismBot You'd think she played a song that irritated the piglet, but piglet was evil all along, dev is tone deaf, & piglet bashed her with the piano
850200723203604484 2017-04-06 04:17:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Don't know much about her personality, as I haven't played her game, sorry!
850200626013155333 2017-04-06 04:16:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Lyn is one of three main characters of Blazing Blade (Hector is another one), she's fast and a pretty good unit in Heroes
850196478580580354 2017-04-06 04:00:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon listen Camilla has great HAIR and that's a big reason I like her don't judge
850196296426074112 2017-04-06 03:59:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Weird, it worked just fine on my end.pic.twitter.com/KQlE8R40oJ
850195283648458754 2017-04-06 03:55:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING HERE SHAMED JUST FOR EXISTING ;ALKSJFALSDKF
850194560043110400 2017-04-06 03:52:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon PLEASE SHE HAS A NAME AND IT'S CAMILLA Which is who I assume you mean, because Kagero also exists.
850193867894910976 2017-04-06 03:49:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon He's kinda one of the best units

850120130566795264 2017-04-06 22:56:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy The fact that you spent two hours on this is pretty funny on its own, so in a way your work was not in vain.
850119953365774337 2017-04-06 22:56:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie A concept I like a lot are heroes with some kind of handicap/restriction. Examples: Pit is an angel who can't fly, Toph Beifong is blind etc
850030758668402692 2017-04-06 17:01:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> DjtheSdotcom on YouTube is my favorite remixer ever, he makes awesome stuff and just listen to this okayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NK3sToEOu8
849983404993118209 2017-04-06 13:53:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> No, she can't be summoned, and Grand Hero battles are timed events, only lasting a few days, not sure if ever available again
849965625749364736 2017-04-06 12:42:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sorry, she was a Grand Hero a while back so you missed your chance
849806014102872065 2017-04-05 02:08:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finally got our cash money waifu to max level! Still a lot of SP needed for maximum profit, but like her weapon color, we still in the greenpic.twitter.com/iJRKpTzvhS

849730915177611265 2017-04-05 21:10:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I'd arguing emailing people is *harder* than Googling, so that's unique kind of impressive. Also how do you meet all of these people
849728756600188929 2017-04-05 21:01:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic I main 6 characters, but have the most fun with Kirby; guess I'm on Pop Star. Super colorful, lots of food, peaceful, I think I'm content :D
849719001743839235 2017-04-05 20:22:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokkn gif cuz that's the most HD Gengar but hard to find a good closeup gif
849718887159672832 2017-04-05 20:22:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> What's the texture of Gengar's body? Is that tuft on its head hair? Is Gengar slimy/gooey? Smooth, sleek fur? What are you, Gengarpic.twitter.com/z6dSNBZmmU
849716113671950338 2017-04-05 20:11:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been having a crummy/super stressful day but I still hope everyone else is having a great day pls take care of yourself & do your best!
849607833532411905 2017-04-05 13:01:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity yes good yes good YES GREAT
849606778568495105 2017-04-05 12:56:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT this bit of the interview put a giant smile on my face. We all know & love Miyamoto, but of course we gotta remember his colleagues too!pic.twitter.com/fr0lXTn7jq
849465978958344192 2017-04-04 03:37:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't even know what's up with this Pepsi ad but this is the truest thing I've read about it. #WhereIsPepsiman
849459170860564480 2017-04-04 03:10:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just find it amusing how Joseph finds a crazy double outsmart maneuver to best his foes while Jotaro is just "I'll hit it a lot"
849459005152014337 2017-04-04 03:09:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> JJBA JoJos Jonathan: straightforwardly strong, skilled Joseph: Crazy prepared, quick thinker, outsmarts Jotaro: Punches really fast, a lot.
849408818907951105 2017-04-04 23:50:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I know there's a lot in there but I was still surprised hahaha
849407757807755264 2017-04-04 23:46:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also Link amiibo for size comparison cuz whoa the box is huge
849407642317541376 2017-04-04 23:45:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm so excited to stare at a box for a whole month. I'm one step closer to playing this. IM SO EXCITED  WOOOOOOOOKKKKKOOOOODUSBSISODHpic.twitter.com/tlKUAYy1wJ
849360595568791552 2017-04-04 20:38:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby The policy minimizes the chance of that happening again
849360515352670210 2017-04-04 20:38:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Less people that stream/play through it, less likely I'm to see spoilers. I saw a spoiler thumbnail on YouTube of someone streaming the game
849359958642708480 2017-04-04 20:36:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I admit it isn't ideal or perfect but, to be selfish, it works better for me.
849359915873423360 2017-04-04 20:35:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Social media obvi can't be policed by ATLUS, but some people can share video playthroughs and stuff about them.
849358831196921856 2017-04-04 20:31:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Azurillkirby But for what I want out of experiencing the game, as I'm sure others do too, minimizing chance of spoils is really important
849358490107817984 2017-04-04 20:30:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Azurillkirby So I'd say it's good for those who just want to join the game, but obvi not ideal for those who want to share it. Don't think it's perfect
849358262717870086 2017-04-04 20:29:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Azurillkirby For streaming, yeah just don't watch, but I'm just wary of people sharing on social media. Hard to just keep going after scrolling by spoils
849353177484939264 2017-04-04 20:09:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar I believe in you, you got this!
849350976624570368 2017-04-04 20:00:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Seven_Cubed Don't worry, it confused me at first too, wasn't too clear
849350771527307269 2017-04-04 19:59:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Oh not irl, they should've clarified, 7/7 is a date in the game, I'm assuming something major happens then, don't want sharing past that
849350023938789377 2017-04-04 19:56:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie They're really adamant about people not spoiling the game, may not ring well for everyone, but I'm personally grateful for those precautions

848881373960183808 2017-04-03 12:54:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's frustrating waking up remembering you had a great dream but not remembering what it was. But I do remember thinking

848694825444675585 2017-04-02 00:33:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Too much, yet not enough
848691600184180740 2017-04-02 00:20:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> No. but one of my favorite pastimes is applying logic to things devoid of much logic :P

848662255923318784 2017-04-02 22:23:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie tbh I don't get it either, this is one of the best changes for the site (albeit, one that should've existed in the first place)

847504354588348416 2017-03-30 17:42:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy I also find issue with jackhammering a ship to fix leaks but k. Overall this new replacement sounds like a quality experience.

847449616471740416 2017-03-30 14:05:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chrom's Awakening crit quotes but Spring Exalt says them:  "Any-spring can change!" "Your end has sprung!" "Now I'm egg-ry!"
847449030003052545 2017-03-30 14:02:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how Spring Exalt Chrom is just obsessed with spring, finds a way to reference it in almost everything he says hahaha
847246953024864257 2017-03-29 00:39:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> So happy to see this, greatly reduces the chance of spoils and I know ATLUS hates peeps spoiling their games, glad for this safety nethttps://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/847232479643578370
847088963324203008 2017-03-29 14:12:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never been more excited for anything, no hyperbole. I won't even be able to play it for a month after, but still SO FREAKING HYPED
847088123255439361 2017-03-29 14:08:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Holy crap, it's been a journey. So surreal. I've been following this game since 2014. And it's almost here. Just 6 days until Winter 2014https://twitter.com/garfep/status/846778144631668736
846940922403344385 2017-03-28 04:23:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> weird, Twitter is eating my replies to my prior tweet. Basically swimsuit even could have plot and that's hilarious
846940817642209281 2017-03-28 04:23:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> test
846939411728273408 2017-03-28 04:17:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Paralogue 3 in #FEHeroes continued the plot. Spring event has a paralogue There'll prolly be a summer event It'll prolly involve swimsuits
846932714838220800 2017-03-28 03:51:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT is why I love video games

846751897038016515 2017-03-28 15:52:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does anyone else ever worry about hypothetical stressful situations that don't apply to you or otherwise probably never happen? ...just me?
846709121722277888 2017-03-28 13:02:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @dorrismccomics I like to imagine the next panel is the proposer and the proposed both saying "oh no" so everyone is saying it. oh no
846581966220787713 2017-03-27 04:37:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Have heard many good things in general tho, with S2 coming it'll be a good time to get around to watching it this summer/whenever anyway
846581268695453696 2017-03-27 04:34:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> When Crunchyroll just directly emails you anime suggestions  (this is going on my will eventually watch queue)pic.twitter.com/4LjD8NfW4s
846528882480238594 2017-03-27 01:06:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not to say that blasts and transformations are bad, they're a lot of what makes DB today, but I really enjoyed when the fights were simpler
846528415859658752 2017-03-27 01:04:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Only one energy blast, zero transformations, just tons of fast flying punches and kicks (not much talking and padding either), just awesome
846527034268495872 2017-03-27 00:59:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Said fight being Yamcha vs. Tien Shinhan in OG Dragon Ball at the World Martial Arts Tournament.
846526834586071040 2017-03-27 00:58:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just realized that memetic loser Yamcha gets tons of cool points for being 1 of the 2 fighters in (imo) one of the best Dragon Ball fights
846487042687221767 2017-03-27 22:20:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL in the Power Rangers world, there is "an entire platoon of Santas" best lore (pic from Power Rangers wiki)pic.twitter.com/iXNihK4GiJ
846346190241353729 2017-03-27 13:00:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Cuz I know I'll be too afraid to ask & then stress about if I upset you I only make them in good fun, know that u a great dude
846345529990746112 2017-03-27 12:57:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese As someone who enjoys frequently messing with you, pls pls pls call me out on any that go to far or actually bother you.

846132029766975489 2017-03-26 22:49:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's not that bad but it's enough to make it hard to work comfortably, I don't really have a good place to work comfortable w/good posture
846131669182533632 2017-03-26 22:48:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Alright, time to get a lot of work done this weekend! My back: Consider this: nah. Me, pained: k
846112459912089601 2017-03-26 21:31:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz I think it'd be better if you played it on your own, so you can relax and really enjoy it all, just my take tho.
845866453949730820 2017-03-25 05:14:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@JoeJohnsonIce You're gonna carry that weight.
845814794842243072 2017-03-25 01:48:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Wait. Other states don't have a respective pledge of allegiance? I've somehow never considered this.
845624294600294402 2017-03-25 13:11:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yes good
845279318569832448 2017-03-24 14:21:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's actually hilarious, people complaining that people who can't get the PE get something PE owners don't, even tho PE has EVERYTHING
845279086603878405 2017-03-24 14:20:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 5 Premium Edition: Game, artbook, soundtrack, schoolbag, plush, steelbook Standard: Game, controller decal "PE doesn't have decal?!"
845257138675093505 2017-03-24 12:53:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> In fact, I might do just that just to support the game!
845256881794924544 2017-03-24 12:51:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Makes sense. I fully enjoy FE Heroes w/o paying, that doesn't make them any profit. ppl saw Mario's $10 as too much but I'd pay that for FEhttps://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/845245911118831616
845109816691449856 2017-03-23 03:07:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> The little I've seen is really interesting, PlatinumGames behind it is good to hear too, might be pretty far off until I play tho haha
845109645316411394 2017-03-23 03:06:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been RTing a lot of NieR: Automata art lately even tho I don't know much about it, but I really like 2B's design, really cool!
845088734961958913 2017-03-23 01:43:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar Bandana doge. I've never seen a dog that looked so tired of your shit. This dog looks sooo done hahaha
845081704557613056 2017-03-23 01:15:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeyJostar THIS CAN'T BE FROM GUNDAM
845080165583654913 2017-03-23 01:09:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pastelpirate69 Merry Cakeday! I hope your birthmas has been a great one! :D
845027433959096320 2017-03-23 21:40:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> So hyped for the showdown of the ages at the #CellGames * *Presented by Hetaphttps://twitter.com/teamfourstar/status/845017390106771458
845001978757496837 2017-03-23 19:59:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> yeeeep. Got into a discussion today about it, I countered, they never responded again and later said I'm ignorant hahaha
844999780715679744 2017-03-23 19:50:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> THANK YOU THATS THE FREAKING POINT AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING THAT
844998868584615937 2017-03-23 19:46:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> But nope, it's all about the labels. People just always gotta label things and other people, always gotta have something to hate/be angry at
844997982512668672 2017-03-23 19:43:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's no winning here, it's ridiculous.  I hope 1 day we can appreciate ppl for their skills, abilities, & experience rather than race.
844997480395788290 2017-03-23 19:41:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just saw a post that complained about people complaining that new L is black but immediately agreed saying it's token/forced diversity
844936434167492608 2017-03-23 15:38:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon No, but that's not relevant here.
844935720850612224 2017-03-23 15:35:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Stop trying to make an issue out of something that it isn't They're adaptations they're supposed to b exact
844935445343617025 2017-03-23 15:34:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Ghost in the Shell isn't about race. It's about robots. Death Note isn't about race. It's about killing ppl
844914545122533376 2017-03-23 14:11:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> [also minor spoiler warning]
844914488386207750 2017-03-23 14:11:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> OOOHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOO OOOHHHHH MYYYY GOOOOOOD HOOOOOLLY SHIIIIIIEEEETT SAND ON DA BEEEACH
844914309419450369 2017-03-23 14:10:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of the best things about JJBA is Joseph Joestar yelling in Englishhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-3GOo_nWoc
844895627540643840 2017-03-23 12:56:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I...but...you... Ok. I accept this. Yes.
844771865688125443 2017-03-22 04:44:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Probably?
844769751540772864 2017-03-22 04:36:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> FE Heroes wiki or this FE Heroes Discord:https://discord.gg/3CjB4
844769112622481408 2017-03-22 04:33:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> yes
844768679774453761 2017-03-22 04:32:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> But other than random giveaways, Arena, & the currently unknown frequency of Voting Gauntlet? Sending heroes home 4 chump change
844768362915753985 2017-03-22 04:30:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> In April, a "Hero Merit" feature will be added, where you essentially get feathers just for having heroes participate in battle
844763042810290176 2017-03-22 04:09:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon (also KI: Uprising is a good game, 30% off is pretty nice)
844762908126982147 2017-03-22 04:09:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon I literally got Kid Icarus NES for free from CN hahaha that's so dumb. But yeah discounts on newer are fine
844762492010094593 2017-03-22 04:07:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Actually this is easier do this
844762421193408514 2017-03-22 04:07:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity There's a section on the site for rewards and FE Heroes specific rewards, if you redeem any the owl will have em
844761304451575808 2017-03-22 04:02:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Nah I wish haha. If it did I'd have zero My Nintendo coins. Feather grind is always real
844761121131151360 2017-03-22 04:02:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Oh and a one time gift of 10 orbs, fyi if you haven't gotten that yet
844760987462860802 2017-03-22 04:01:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Light's Blessing (up to 3 iirc), shards and crystals for level up, stamina potions, and dueling crests too
844759328691249152 2017-03-22 03:54:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon I was excited for a new rewards system but they really haven't delivered so far :\
844759251063111681 2017-03-22 03:54:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon Oh and Club Nintendo had cool physical merch too. Got a shirt, DS and 3DS game card cases from it.
844758569077673984 2017-03-22 03:51:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @CheeseyPokemon Club Nintendo had full games and discounts iirc, My Nintendo is only discounts
844758479160164352 2017-03-22 03:51:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The Kid Icarus anime specials I spy there are actually the coolest rewards I've seen on My Nintendo. I actually want those.
844757535336869888 2017-03-22 03:47:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I wouldn't have a problem with it if there actually were cool things to use them on, but they aren't.
844757166116540416 2017-03-22 03:46:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I've been using mine on FE Heroes, only thing worthwhile really. Either that or let 'em expire :\
844693937021489152 2017-03-22 23:35:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @shenanigansen If you can fit it in one tweet, I say bunch of images, if longer I personally say link to imgur or something external
844693501107474432 2017-03-22 23:33:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I don't count on too many/any randos to remember me but I do think about it sometimes.
844650923578327041 2017-03-22 20:44:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nibellion According to this score, anyway
844650779420119040 2017-03-22 20:43:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nibellion I personally believe in the 4 point scale (7-10), or 70-100 in this case Don't know much about Chronicles, I guess it's "good/ok"
844648895779160064 2017-03-22 20:36:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @JoeyJostar @Azurillkirby @sami_spoon It's clear people really like the series, so I don't find current hype too relevant.
844648535278669824 2017-03-22 20:34:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @JoeyJostar @Azurillkirby @sami_spoon I feel you could say the same for when 2015's LA drama came out in Japan
844646882374770689 2017-03-22 20:28:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @JoeyJostar @sami_spoon @Azurillkirby 2016 also had a new Japanese movie "Light Up the New World" Popularity is still strong
844637115203903493 2017-03-22 19:49:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> My worry with the movie is how much are they adapting, Death Note works better as an episodic series imo, but we'll see I guess
844636718007508993 2017-03-22 19:47:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Light randomly finding the Death Note is supposed to show that anybody can become Kira/corrupted by the Note. Being Japanese had no impact
844636379866894339 2017-03-22 19:46:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3. There are already 4 Japanese live action Death Note films 4. The fact that it takes place in Japan isn't the main focus
844635995983269888 2017-03-22 19:44:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find it funny people are complaining about Death Note "whitewashing" when: 1. Only half the main cast are Japanese 2. It's not in Japan
844624709610356736 2017-03-22 18:59:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't know why the second pic of this tweet didn't go through (I scheduled this) but here's the secondo partpic.twitter.com/ZeNz0eqiWw

844185891199467520 2017-03-21 13:56:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> 14 DAYS TWO WEEKS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
844169390685851648 2017-03-21 12:50:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Dreams are weird.
844169305541541888 2017-03-21 12:50:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> care a single bit people around them were being murdered and Tao was so annoyed at their indifference he decided not to kill the twins.
844169207084400641 2017-03-21 12:49:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Had a dream Mercenary Tao from Dragon Ball was working for DIO but just killing random kids and there were 8 year old twin girls who did not
843974105691029504 2017-03-20 23:54:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> the Pokmon world like how Pok Balls work, gyms are subsidized, and soooo much more. There's just so much to go on about, I love it!
843973965206949889 2017-03-20 23:54:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> give it a read. Great characters and plot, changes some character's roles to keep you on your toes, shows interesting little things about
843973199918456832 2017-03-20 23:51:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> well known/talked about much, despite being (imo) one of if not the best. It's so good and I honestly think if you love Pokmon, you should
843972294565396480 2017-03-20 23:47:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, I know I talk about this a lot, but it's really because I enjoy it an incredible amount, feel like it's a Pokmon medium not super
843969865551691776 2017-03-20 23:37:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished GSC arc & somehow it's even better than I remembered. Such and incredible finale, love it much.  (pls mind the DS, needed a weight)pic.twitter.com/5lbVmJj15Q
843625209387253762 2017-03-19 00:48:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sailorbee how do you exist
843506428312797187 2017-03-19 16:56:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I didn't even realize this *still* isn't out on Android yet hahahahttps://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/843506263434567684
843314623533191168 2017-03-18 04:14:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Also today I learned the specifics on what exactly a wyvern is, so thanks haha
843314124931158016 2017-03-18 04:12:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Cherche on her wyvern vs. Tiki, a manakete, transformed into her battle form.pic.twitter.com/xmKYXUYmsY
843313584935440384 2017-03-18 04:10:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Wyverns in FE have two hind legs and wings, transformed manaketes have two "arms", two legs, and a pair of wings
843310168423256065 2017-03-18 03:56:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of her 4* voice lines: Are there any really adorable monsters here? Like the Risen? This woman is something else hahaha
843288344029249536 2017-03-18 02:29:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Help me get #SwampForCheesey trending on Twitter, MySpace, Snapstagram, & Miiverse & get @CheeseyPokemon the biggest swamp in Far Far Away.
843287936997167104 2017-03-18 02:28:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> I believe that good friend @CheeseyPokemon deserves his own swamp, but he is being oppressed by the establishment. However, you can help.
843265723304759296 2017-03-18 00:59:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Merry Cakeday! I hope you enjoy a wonderfully tasty cake and you now get to enjoy being a cool adult!!~ ...whatever that means.
843189798303096834 2017-03-18 19:58:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Yes yes, very goods, very greats. And Nanako is too precious and good Just lots of good going on here!
843187765596602372 2017-03-18 19:50:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree How the heck did I not think of this. Yes. (Also that dance is adorable, excellent gif selection)
843186435930947584 2017-03-18 19:44:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Yeah that makes a lot of sense, Clair also mentions they both grew up and trained together, so they got close.
843182150698590210 2017-03-18 19:27:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Found out later they are indeed cousins in this canon, Clair just calls Lance "big brother" cuz she looks up to him that way I guess.
842966847347703808 2017-03-17 05:12:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Great character development, and, of course, tons of badassery. I love this series so much and this is only one of the best arcs! :D
842966069987983360 2017-03-17 05:09:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Forgot just how awesome the final GSC volume is. Huge battle, pretty much every major and minor character involved, great art (1/2)pic.twitter.com/DdV41VUnk0
842963800219418625 2017-03-17 05:00:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_AlexHirsch I refuse to not agree with not doing this. ...I think. Yeah.
842932546317029376 2017-03-17 02:55:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Turns out it's really hard trying to figure out what to do with your life when you only have two interests and are good at one useful thing
842835016958824448 2017-03-17 20:28:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @jenjenjenrose I hope you have a wonderful birthday! :D
842723087858745345 2017-03-17 13:03:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hope this game gets a sequel soon, it's a ton of fun!https://twitter.com/JoeMerrick/status/842707089717911552
842239142419435521 2017-03-15 05:00:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reminder that in the Pokmon Adventures manga, Team Rocket is actually a silly acronym. (Apparently elite soldiers are "tusks")pic.twitter.com/bEe2tOvcrM
842237193229881344 2017-03-15 04:52:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...kinda like that.
842237041320595456 2017-03-15 04:52:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess I just feel like I don't have as much to say, if I do no one really cares, & I like sharing tweets cooler than mine, which is a lot.
842236627753791488 2017-03-15 04:50:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Almost 2500 of my last 3200 tweets are retweets ...wow. I know I retweet a lot but damn hahaha
842194777131102210 2017-03-15 02:04:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @Azurillkirby Another automated system, that explains it all.
842194120743522304 2017-03-15 02:01:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity YouTube is really good at taking ok/tolerable or even good things and worsening them. I really have no idea.
842193425818652672 2017-03-15 01:58:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity That's the thing tho, Restrictive Mode isn't new, it's been around for a few years, something is def up with it now tho

841872615434256384 2017-03-14 04:44:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> o   h welp. have fun with that one hahaha
841872293341106176 2017-03-14 04:42:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Depends what you mean by "all support convos" All in one run or *every single support convo* Latter would make quite a speedrun
841793499871772673 2017-03-14 23:29:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> yee; good with her Hammer and her Atk is literally the best in the game (so far) Now you see the greatness of the wyvern ladies
841792577233920000 2017-03-14 23:26:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> She mainly struggles against armored units later on, even blue ones so watch out for that. But yeah she good
841791868136448001 2017-03-14 23:23:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Camilla is pretty solid, but it's mostly the fact that she 5 star 5 stars rip through a lot
841790773481902080 2017-03-14 23:18:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Actually I think you'll be alright, since levels mostly scale, but once you get to 30s-40 it gets rougher, you face better teams
841790013151055873 2017-03-14 23:15:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Depends on your team, strategy, and what difficulty you choose. Short answer: yes
841789532479590401 2017-03-14 23:13:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Arena, Voting Gauntlet, Arena, some quests, and Arena.
841702048349462528 2017-03-14 17:26:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Actually yeah, you're right. Does "Soon" work better for you? :P (i'm just excited okay)
841672633880072196 2017-03-14 15:29:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3 WEEKS 21 DAYS SOON AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
841448389069946881 2017-03-13 00:38:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby From what I've heard, reception of Japanese ones are mixed but I can't really say from much experience.
841448355528081408 2017-03-13 00:38:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I'm actually not too sure, I mainly think of American ones too and didn't really think to make the distinction.
841445973641592832 2017-03-13 00:28:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Has great music and beautiful animation. Overall, actually a really good adaptation, especially the 4th movie, I really enjoyed them
841445535089344512 2017-03-13 00:27:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> While it can only stick to the main plot it does so well, changes some things without ruining its impact, gives protag great development.
841444831478050817 2017-03-13 00:24:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I generally agree with the idea that most video game based movies are not the best adaptations but the Persona 3 tetralogy is actually great
841436181967568896 2017-03-13 23:49:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Probably when the next update rolls in tomorrow
841287225950232576 2017-03-13 13:57:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love #FEHeroes because they KEEP GIVING FREE STUFF!! Haven't spent a dime on this game but I still really enjoy it!
841126130698584064 2017-03-12 03:17:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> How many times can you say you lost by (almost) over 10 *billion*?https://twitter.com/FEHeroes_News/status/841125593194274816
841013502458355717 2017-03-12 19:50:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Good point, she's pretty great.
841008490273525761 2017-03-12 19:30:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I don't hate her, I like her. I just like every other child more.
840997515415695362 2017-03-12 18:46:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not to say that's bad, I like that of her too, but that applies to the entire female cast, so not a very distinguished trait
840997080583790593 2017-03-12 18:45:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I actually felt like Kjelle was a lot like Sully, may just be me tho
840996511362215937 2017-03-12 18:42:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I think part of her appeal is that she's a strong determined woman, not uncommon in FE, but she's notable for that I feel.
840995746094682112 2017-03-12 18:39:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Well, not "overshadowed" considering she's the most popular Awakening character, but her personality can't really compete
840995510622289921 2017-03-12 18:38:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Her thing is that she's comically serious, but she gets overshadowed by every other child cuz they're all more interesting.
840988130614353921 2017-03-12 18:09:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @jonnysun hapny birthday jomny sun yur tweets are gud you are good keep being good thanks for being good.

840262296224051201 2017-03-10 18:05:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Not fully sure but I think I read inheriting a skill will cost 1.5x that skill's SP cost or something along those lines
840202829071568896 2017-03-10 14:08:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbf, your other option would've been to promote Effie, who's also on this focus Nice case of Morton's Fork there.

836411504098430976 2017-02-27 03:03:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> l i s t e n I JUST WANTED A CHAT WITH HER OKAY
836410375868461056 2017-02-27 02:59:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Never knew the specifics of the chance increase, thought it was per set rather than per hero until a bit ago
836409462051196928 2017-02-27 02:55:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Yeah she is. I pretty much determined I'd get more out of my feathers spending them on 3 to 4, I'm fine with mostly 4 stars
836409182039461890 2017-02-27 02:54:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity We figured out odds reset per summon focus change, so that's unfortunately not the case rn
836408971225333760 2017-02-27 02:53:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well, your odds max at 120 w/o a 5 star, so just do 24 summoning sets. 480 orbs. Best bundle is 140 for $74.99. $299.96. :D
836407405013516290 2017-02-27 02:47:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Ah, it's been resetting. riiiiiiiiip the dream then, good luck getting another 5 star, *ever*
836406946655776770 2017-02-27 02:45:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Then your odds should be at about 7.25% now
836406850920804352 2017-02-27 02:45:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity lol I don't have 20,000 feathers. Don't even have 500 rn. rip that dream then D:
836406647723593728 2017-02-27 02:44:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity @Stupid_Pokenerd Oh, does it actually update on the appearance rate sheet?
836406535953731585 2017-02-27 02:43:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> You right, it's per hero not per set, my b. So it should be up 4% for you
836405878320431104 2017-02-27 02:41:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Oh. Camilla's been level 40 since yesterday. ...is she holding out on me? D:
836405618751725568 2017-02-27 02:40:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think it goes up 0.5 every 5. If you've only opened 8 since your last one, it'd take two more to go up again
836404742146371584 2017-02-27 02:36:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity Then your current odds should be at 3.75%, few more and you'll hit dat yung 4.25% good luck
836403945417412608 2017-02-27 02:33:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Or do not all characters have a convo? The character in question is Camilla but I'd think a focus character with an intro movie would have 1
836403767641849859 2017-02-27 02:32:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do they have to not be the leader? Cuz my current level 40 is the leader. For reference, I mean leftmost on first team, top of home screen
836403627627589638 2017-02-27 02:32:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I read that in FE Heroes, you can have a special convo with a hero that's reached level 40, how do I do that?
836402810887548928 2017-02-27 02:29:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd @FloralSerenity Yeah it goes up by 0.5% every 5 summons that doesn't have one, but currently at 3.25%
836400901300572161 2017-02-27 02:21:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Odds seem to be changing, current focus is 3.25% each, 6.5% total. Either way, *still* below average, rip.
836399853173354497 2017-02-27 02:17:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Thought they were 3% each, totaling to 6%?

834985125620383744 2017-02-23 04:35:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot Butterfly BUT Without antennae (or they're super short) and its eyes are on its butt. Poor butterfly.
834979433425612800 2017-02-23 04:13:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Like, it's a person I don't even personally know; doesn't affect me in anyway but still think ppl should call them by the nickname
834978729889841154 2017-02-23 04:10:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie It's a minor thing, but yeah this bugs me a tiny bit
834969850539872256 2017-02-23 03:35:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot Two lone cereal bits lay in eternal rest at the bottom of the Divine Bowl
834960680226865152 2017-02-23 02:58:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> CN's marketing is so bad, I thought this show was so dumb yet this is another clip of how cool/creative it is, I need to watch it sometimehttps://twitter.com/parapadarappa33/status/831881237379821569
834948622710112256 2017-02-23 02:10:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Oh I meant did you play the song when the cats met haha
834947974115491840 2017-02-23 02:08:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Also important question, did you play Snake Eater?
834947572649308161 2017-02-23 02:06:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity "10 cats" H O W
834936731841531905 2017-02-23 01:23:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Groudon is a lil off imo but yeah much better this time :P
834924465096179712 2017-02-23 00:34:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot A legendary bathtub floats over the water's surface.
834919845972045824 2017-02-23 00:16:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot Spider descending onto the ground
834824285227274243 2017-02-23 17:56:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot A crab with the arrow from Avatar: The Last Airbender pointing upward instead of downward
834784997844332545 2017-02-23 15:20:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot A smiling deer
834611388790222848 2017-02-22 03:50:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> So yeah actually I think we're good here
834610836224217089 2017-02-22 03:48:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well to clarify, said world was a book in 3D Mario's world, so I guess whoever wrote it (if written) could know about FE and write about it
834610524478390272 2017-02-22 03:47:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> And even if they weren't just trophies, M&L: Paper Jam showed Paper Mario is in a different world than 3D Mario, assuming 3D Mario = Smash
834610310652841984 2017-02-22 03:46:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Or did the creators of FE in PM visit FE's world since Mario meet Roy in Smash But were they the real Mario and Roy, or just trophies??
834609962202628096 2017-02-22 03:44:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does this mean the FE world exists in PM's, or else how would they know to make a game off it Or does Intelligent Systems exist in PM world?
834609883693584384 2017-02-22 03:44:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also the same kid references Fire Emblem: Blazing Blade (which is apparently just called "Fire Emblem" in English release)
834608104356593665 2017-02-22 03:37:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also Paper TTYD is a video game in TTYD. And a kid beats the game *before* you. How did someone make a game of your uncomplete adventure?!
834607454545666050 2017-02-22 03:34:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot Squinting man with a mustache
834604845936041984 2017-02-22 03:24:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon video games exist in the Pokmon video games. So are we really playing as a character in the world or as someone playing a game?! :O
834594364378726401 2017-02-22 02:42:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Still don't understand why Elekid is so plump; Elekid isn't bigger than Espeon haha
834591426402979841 2017-02-22 02:31:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Please record this!
834590595880468481 2017-02-22 02:27:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I kinda do that too when there's a post about something really positive that happened, I keep telling myself not to but curiosity
834577656641363969 2017-02-22 01:36:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot A rocket ship emerging from hatch/door things shaped like the letter "F"
834427015646343168 2017-02-22 15:37:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot Either a bird or more concept art of Galaga/Space Invader enemies, cuz a lot of these look like that hahaha
834276507044413440 2017-02-21 05:39:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity You can half that time with beans obvi, but EV training is so easy this gen, you just put 'em in and wait
834276355562938368 2017-02-21 05:39:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity If at max, training a 'mon in one stat for 31 hours and 30 min (63 sessions) will get them the 252 EVs
834276006018088962 2017-02-21 05:37:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity If you've upgraded Pok Pelago Evelup Island to max, you can EV train any 'mon pretty easily
834275293258985472 2017-02-21 05:35:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @tinydotblot The Prince from Katamari Damacypic.twitter.com/r5mKL5MYjy
834268896777605120 2017-02-21 05:09:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry @FloralSerenity Quite a bit is different, it's weird. Cosmo and Mr. Turner were smart(er), only saw the parents neck down
834268383193489411 2017-02-21 05:07:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry @FloralSerenity Pilot season of sorts, iirc FOP played as little shorts on Nick or something before they became a full show
834235125508485120 2017-02-21 02:55:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I gotta get through the tropes page for the first one before the sister sites, I definitely have a lot to go haha
834234185493729280 2017-02-21 02:51:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not Always Right might be my new favorite site.  ...maybe.

834140656943689728 2017-02-21 20:40:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity These are harmless to their brand. While AM2R is as well, it's of higher quality, higher popularity, more of a threat to IP
834063424380350470 2017-02-21 15:33:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy What a twist! I can't wait for what happens next!! :O ...well I guess I can wait, especially since you did :P
834042743529807872 2017-02-21 14:11:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sure, let's make everyone feel old today. 12 years ago today in 2005 was when Avatar: The Last Airbender made its debut! :D
834041599495634944 2017-02-21 14:06:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore No worries, hope everything with the move goes well!
833846856992092160 2017-02-20 01:12:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I already never wanted to get into customer service, but some people are just horrible, wow Serious props to anyone in the cs, hang in there
833846370951892993 2017-02-20 01:10:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> The more I read the hilarious stories of unruly/idiotic customers on Not Always Right, the more I never want to get into customer service.
833794063774150661 2017-02-20 21:42:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait those are eyeglass lens cleaner not eye drops. Still showed me the truth tho so still good ;D
833792832435544064 2017-02-20 21:37:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Little to no response to Ho-oh and Link, will keep in mind for the future. These are my findings, good luck with your future summons! :D
833792695114067970 2017-02-20 21:37:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Eye drops successfully opened my eyes to the truth: my bond with Tiki helped put a good word in, must further bond with my heroes
833792519569801217 2017-02-20 21:36:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> FE Awakening started the turn around of my luck, need to appeal directly to the product.
833792286400057344 2017-02-20 21:35:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Learned about the pentagram tho, will def use again in the future, do recommend. Dragon Ball was analogous to the best pull, noted
833791084115480576 2017-02-20 21:31:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I pleaded to the Divine Dragon Naga, and she decided Seliph would answer the call, thank you Naga & thanks Tiki, Naga's Voice, for the help
833790378503446534 2017-02-20 21:28:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I choose them clockwise, was okay with the repeats to merge, but got a little worried BUT NEVER SAY MY METHODS DON'T WORK F O O L P R O O Fpic.twitter.com/g0V3dnZtWr
833788081731936257 2017-02-20 21:19:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also the Dragon Ball doesn't actually glow, just the flash did that
833787990723944449 2017-02-20 21:18:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> as a pledge to the Divine Dragon herself, Naga I'm ready.
833787961342844929 2017-02-20 21:18:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ho-oh cuz they're majestic Link, a fellow master of the blade A copy of FE: Awakening Eye drops so I can see the 5 stars 1 star Dragon Ball

833371870120513537 2017-02-19 17:45:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ I'd personally send him home, will net you 1,000 feathers and while the stat boost from merging is nice, I don't find it overly
833360360132530176 2017-02-19 16:59:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby All you're missing is blatantly taking other people's jokes but other than that yeah that's probably what it feels like

833141170431807488 2017-02-18 02:28:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Today I discovered one of my new favorite sites: (The Customer is) Not Always Right. Hilarious stories about the stupidity encountered in
833109906320453633 2017-02-18 00:24:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> listen man, when your summers are fire, you take the 60s and celebrate
833109213236830208 2017-02-18 00:21:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> "melting" 65 degrees l m a o
833096970562576385 2017-02-18 23:32:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@Stupid_Pokenerd I didn't even consider that, that's very likely to be the case!
833092120869224448 2017-02-18 23:13:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> But yeah, didn't expect a random question I had 6 months ago to actually get officially answered in any capacity, love trivia like that! :D
833091841507614722 2017-02-18 23:12:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Many other gym leaders have separate jobs, for example Erika in the manga is a university lecturer, all the Unova leaders have other jobs
833091249523585024 2017-02-18 23:10:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Said Association is the "Pokmon League Association", in charge of testing and appointing leaders, hosting League events, etc.
833090750099423233 2017-02-18 23:08:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Adventures manga actually reveals that "remuneration for the leaders arrives in the form of 'gym operating costs' from the Association"https://twitter.com/SilverScizor753/status/768629938442252288
833088614611447809 2017-02-18 22:59:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> how do you exist
833068587292225538 2017-02-18 21:40:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity My Little Ducky: Companionship is... *looks up synonyms for "magic"* Witchcraft yeah.
833061089613115392 2017-02-18 21:10:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> With my recent luck, the best part about Heroes summons is the fast paced "Together We Ride" remix

832991409204510722 2017-02-18 16:33:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I don't think that's how tripping or not moving works. So clumsy you defy logic.
832831930089476096 2017-02-17 05:59:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> you would
832831687872634880 2017-02-17 05:58:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> so i got thru most the game ramming into everything
832831582562091008 2017-02-17 05:58:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I also had Tackle until Hidden Land and I think thanks to STAB it really worked out until I replaced with Body Slam iirc
832830747673231361 2017-02-17 05:54:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> My player was Munchlax, I think the luck was set in motion when my first Metronome move was Regigigas' Crush Grip
832830440109142016 2017-02-17 05:53:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> They just decided "lol who needs balancing" Salamance, Metagross, Porygon-Z, Bronzong It takes just two of them sometimes
832829871525134336 2017-02-17 05:51:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I once had a play through where I never lost, EVER, until the end game 26 losses. 1 in Hidden Land THE REST SPIRE AND DIALGA
832829250885529600 2017-02-17 05:49:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> It needs to be accurate to the game First a montage of getting Roar of Timed Then you bullshitting your way with half your items
832828747950747648 2017-02-17 05:47:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> HOW DOES RAPID SPIN EVEN WORK, MUST BE HELL ON THE BODY,PROBABLY RIPS THE USER'S SPINE ACTUALLY DONT THINK ABOUT IT
832828029302890496 2017-02-17 05:44:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah, mostly missed potential, wish there was more ALSO IT LIES, DUSKNOIR CANT LEARN RAPID SPIN
832808837849632768 2017-02-17 04:27:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> That level is actually terrible, Sonic's worst level I think
832788278176649216 2017-02-17 03:06:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I'm fairly certain that's what it is going to be (unless they found vocally talented lions), so "live action" is quite the misnomer
832746098829561857 2017-02-17 00:18:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA My favorite 3 Personas of the Phantom Thieves are Johanna, Arsen, and Carmen!
832594833151778816 2017-02-17 14:17:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh didn't think new Pokmon would bring such a resurgence for GO, thought people got bored of the bare game play

832257342808977409 2017-02-16 15:56:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> What am I to you? Am I a
832252313108639744 2017-02-16 15:36:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Soundtrack is pretty great Bad voice acting and lip syncing is hilariously bad Introduced Shadow, an enjoyable character
832252291835117570 2017-02-16 15:36:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tho I don't want to just do nothing but trash, so I'll say what I did like about the game: Most of the Sonic and Shadow stages were fun
832250769558663170 2017-02-16 15:30:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> ProJared's vid on SA2 really helped me see why people love it so much, even tho it's badhttps://youtu.be/JgG--74XExY
832111330853318656 2017-02-15 06:16:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> And she was the hilariously voiced Lt. Surge, all the best voices from the original were from the same few actors apparently hahaha
832110877138620416 2017-02-15 06:14:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> And the VA who did the infamous Electabuzz "ELBLBLBLBLBLBLBLBLBLBBLBLBLBLBLBLBL" is the late Maddie Blaustein, AKA Meowth from EP31 to S8
832108289508925440 2017-02-15 06:04:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just learned the voice actor for Victreebel and that infamous scream, is Eric Stuart, AKA Brock and James, amazing
832090243327213568 2017-02-15 04:52:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Probably looking for Froggy
832086895454801921 2017-02-15 04:39:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> You tipped the scale
832083473032679424 2017-02-15 04:25:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Obsessions like yours must be supported, always. Also Riza is just great so that helps haha
832080085884796928 2017-02-15 04:12:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon THE DAY CARE COUPLE
832043943533625346 2017-02-15 01:48:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Not if you're fast enough
832043764130668544 2017-02-15 01:47:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity SMD 100%
832041348257738753 2017-02-15 01:38:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Started off really great but then it loses almost everything great that it had.  Also wow this analogy was more accurate than I realized
832041274337288192 2017-02-15 01:37:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also another reason is the reheating pizza via a microwave significantly weakens its power. Think Paper Mario TTYD vs. Sticker Star:
832038929180291073 2017-02-15 01:28:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why I dislike microwaving food: Me after 1st bite: Nice it's warm Me after 2nd: Nice it's ice *reheats, takes 3rd* Me, on fire: Nice
831989216775118848 2017-02-15 22:11:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> The boulder punch was the best scene. So much stupid and awesome in one scene
831988828428726273 2017-02-15 22:09:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wesker's voice is too ridiculous to take seriously, it's the best
831987838157729792 2017-02-15 22:05:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of the few things I like is the bad voice acting and horrendous lip syncing. "You're not even good enough toI'LLMAKEYOUEATTH
831987621668777984 2017-02-15 22:04:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I genuinely don't intend to trash people's opinion but I just wanna know why my thoughts are polar opposite so many others
831987382471839745 2017-02-15 22:03:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> "But Chao Garden is the real good part" Yeah it was aight until I had to go back and play the main levels again and again and again.
831987017324060674 2017-02-15 22:02:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> To elaborate, I only enjoyed Sonic/Shadow levels, Tails/Eggman were boring, Knuckles/Rogue levels were the absolute worst; horrible
831986458005217280 2017-02-15 22:00:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> (besides Colors and Generations) but when I played it, I thought it was bad too. I don't get the hype, besides possible nostalgia goggles
831985684131016704 2017-02-15 21:56:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not just saying this cuz I think SA2 sucks, but I'm genuinely curious why people liked it so much. It's hailed as the last good Sonicpic.twitter.com/n6BQQjAUfy
831864678317973504 2017-02-15 13:56:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> lol Pokmon GO in 2017
831703929536802816 2017-02-14 03:17:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> The whole time I had the largest/dumbest grin on my face; it's soooo good
831703495753494528 2017-02-14 03:15:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VoiceOfVegeta Worse than Yamcha, I didn't think it was possible Poor Goten. Poor Yamcha.

831693932455145473 2017-02-14 02:37:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wasn't prepared for this tweet
831693716318515200 2017-02-14 02:36:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Almost 5-0'd by a flu? smh I thought you were better than this
831689755100315648 2017-02-14 02:21:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PlayOverwatch Sure, why not? #BeMineOW
831688231485833218 2017-02-14 02:15:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> For a bit I thought it was an abridged too but the joke of the tweet was that it was real and I'm like "o h wow hahaha"
831687835317059584 2017-02-14 02:13:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> First time seeing anything of, seems to have a hilarious dub and "such a pretty cat"
831685176057065473 2017-02-14 02:02:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon But as for "correctness" I've seen both so much in my experience that I figured both were, interesting how dough precedes do
831684594676224000 2017-02-14 02:00:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Looks like its usage spread from Dunkin, but word was used 30ish yrs before them in 1900; "doughnut" being 100 yrs older
831683585086210052 2017-02-14 01:56:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree YOU MAKE DO...um, ->  THESE?! That's awesome! Also that is pretty weird haha

831660762259156993 2017-02-14 00:25:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sorry about the mini-rant but I've seen people complaining about that stuff when the solution is really simple if u stop and think about it
831660327653822464 2017-02-14 00:24:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's really not hard. And if people really want to complain about DLC,  Now stay with me on this one DON'T FREAKINGBUYIT
831659114258382848 2017-02-14 00:19:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because I got bored of MK8 quickly. If you want more, get the DLC, if you don't then don't get it. It's so simple SO STOP COMPLAINING
831658913640640512 2017-02-14 00:18:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRTs; I played lots of Smash and wanted to continue, so I got the DLC Despite recognizing it was a great deal, I didn't get MK8's DLC
831658145781051392 2017-02-14 00:15:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL Slaking can learn After You by move tutor in Gen VI and now I want a double battle boss to After You to a Skill Swapper
831654341660520449 2017-02-14 00:00:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> I told myself today I wouldn't make a dumb poem joke but this one came to me and it's dumb but I don't care cuz it's different
831653871307075584 2017-02-14 23:58:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Roses are red But some are white Yellow orange purple Pink & green too Violets are violet Not blue that's dumb It's literally in the name

831557904478134272 2017-02-14 17:37:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT today is not the only day you can retweet that, but I shall RT it today anyway
831557621916299265 2017-02-14 17:36:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FizzySodaWave Lies, I will always retweet this, date irrelevant

831266787073327105 2017-02-13 22:20:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Carmen and Decker said it excellently, all I can add is that I love hanging out and chatting with you; we all got your back!
831153227336925184 2017-02-13 14:49:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @maggiebuts I recently learned the longer you go without one, better your chances, you're guaranteed to get one at 120 rolls so um good luck
831145123438272512 2017-02-13 14:16:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last roll before focus characters change, while I only got Camilla, it wasn't even in focus, but she's my best hero so can't complain there
831144738699038720 2017-02-13 14:15:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, one of my fave things, game doesn't ask for review u til after you get your first 5 star hahahapic.twitter.com/3KWDdP64vw
831144490081669122 2017-02-13 14:14:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I technically can't complain anymore, I already have a green mage I'm happy with, Nino (4 stars); hyped for Corrin thopic.twitter.com/NGRNL8yjkm
831139707513880577 2017-02-13 13:55:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Palkia looks like they're creepily whispering in Dialga's ear
830994748810919938 2017-02-12 04:19:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> That & I like dumb gimmicks, doing something like this will *obviously* warp the galactic RNG of the Outrealms, blessing my luck or somethin
830994426289872896 2017-02-12 04:18:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I changed my Twitter handle to have 4 stars because I'm apparently only good enough for anything at or below, hoping to promote tomorrow 
830979546761535488 2017-02-12 03:18:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do you gain additional feathers if you play more arena even if your score already nets you the most feathers?

830917424249704449 2017-02-12 23:12:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity But that back and forth in just three days, weather is weird haha
830917351612755970 2017-02-12 23:11:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Looks like it's gonna bounce around 60s-80 throughout this week for me, it's been consistent here haha
830916494523510784 2017-02-12 23:08:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I worked pulling carts over the summer, high 80s on a cool day, ~100 on the worst I can survive anything now
830916154482884608 2017-02-12 23:07:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Mid 80s rn, looks like it'll drop to low 70s tomorrow
830913588277739520 2017-02-12 22:56:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Everyone else: SNOW EVERYWHERE AHHHHHHH Me, in short sleeves and shorts: Geez, it's hot today.
830853652378169353 2017-02-12 18:58:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh boy I remember the 2nd 100 days remaining day like it was a few weeks ago. Time is flying W E A L M O S T T H E R Ehttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/830853072448581632

830828202654330880 2017-02-12 17:17:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lunatic+ is dumb but hilarious but also stupid
830821323991560193 2017-02-12 16:50:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> To clarify: even if you initiate combat, they'll strike first. ALWAYS It's hilariously stupid how brutal that is hahaha
830821147390443520 2017-02-12 16:49:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just learned that FE: New Mystery of the Emblem (JP only) has a "Lunatic Reverse Mode". Same as Lunatic, but enemies always strike first
830652807350976516 2017-02-11 05:40:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh wow, that's really interesting, shows they just copy pasta'd her sprite data/coding to EoTDS, this pretty neat haha
830652322535636992 2017-02-11 05:38:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> sleeping in the after game (said animation is just the walking animation)
830652284967276544 2017-02-11 05:38:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Curious, does Gardevoir disappear where there should be a sleeping sprite/animation or do they use the animation for evolved mon
830554725355499522 2017-02-11 23:10:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Ditto Dad gets me every time, seems like they really get around haha The other two are great as well, love this! :D
830463050541047808 2017-02-11 17:06:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Yo this is really good, I like it quite a bit! :D
830288100022706177 2017-02-10 05:31:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if in game protags don't try to catch a KO'd 'mon cuz they don't wanna take it w/unconscious or it cuz it sinks into the ground
830272253099180032 2017-02-10 04:28:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> "have time" time heh. H E H.

830266396915408896 2017-02-10 04:05:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah for those who don't know, the full results for FE's Choose Your Legends was released few days back:https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/result
830263183021588480 2017-02-10 03:52:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The full results were released on the site few days ago https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/result
830262199415357441 2017-02-10 03:48:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...which you also may not of heard of, cuz that didn't release outside of Japan either hahaha
830262084923486209 2017-02-10 03:48:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> And you may not have even heard of Tharcia 776. That's because US never got it haha! It's apparently a midquel to Genealogy of the Holy War
830261714079842309 2017-02-10 03:46:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Shoutouts to Glade from Fire Emblem: Tharcia 776, for getting a measly 17 votes for #FEChoose  Don't worry Glade. At least 2 people like youpic.twitter.com/pL8qRynwDD

829880753416728580 2017-02-09 02:32:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fun Fact: Anna is in every Fire Emblem game *except* Fire Emblem Gaiden. Which is what Shadows of Valentia will be remaking. rip
829856830818021377 2017-02-09 00:57:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> The superior protein breakfast food is:
829842223604887553 2017-02-09 23:59:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon What if that someone is another burrito?
829790639072083969 2017-02-09 20:34:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KariWahlgren If you run out of letters, there are literally an infinite amount of numbers... :D
829550714485604352 2017-02-08 04:41:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I kinda feel bad for him, he pretty much wasted 10 years of his entire life. But at the same time, the legend chose us. Sorry buddy :P
829549820197089280 2017-02-08 04:37:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I think about how Eusine searched for Suicune for an entire decade and found nothing until we the player show up, then catch them.
829540122580353026 2017-02-08 03:59:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I'm normally not to fond of remakes, considering America didn't even get most of the FE games, I think it's pretty fair :P
829539607234609154 2017-02-08 03:57:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I say "the first Echoes" game, cuz the fact that "Echoes" isn't part of the subtitle makes me think we'll get more remakes in the future
829539440393596928 2017-02-08 03:56:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> and older titles via VC, and I'm pretty hyped to play more FE! :D
829539416523800577 2017-02-08 03:56:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> to get into more of the franchise for a while. Somehow, I gotta get Fates, the first Echoes game, Warriors, the Switch game next year,
829539370088673280 2017-02-08 03:56:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> #FEHeroes has made me really excited and interested into getting into more of the franchise. I've played Awakening and loved but I've wanted
829527503643500544 2017-02-08 03:09:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh wow that cheered you up, I was just trolling. I MEAN YES CHROM'S IN FEW GET HYPE YEAH

829463101892337666 2017-02-08 22:53:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Oh yeah, this looks pretty separate from the cartoon, but it looks amazing, really hyped for it :D
829447889969676288 2017-02-08 21:52:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles But, of course, fandoms ruin everything so ehhh
829447860630470656 2017-02-08 21:52:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles But that's it, I really don't care to be convinced of his theories, I just think they're fun.
829447805701914624 2017-02-08 21:52:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I actually like his videos a lot, but I mainly watch them to see the work and research put into them and learn from 'em.

829359690219925511 2017-02-08 16:02:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Minor spoiler warning btw
829359508623351808 2017-02-08 16:01:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I never realized just how many innuendoes are in FE Awakening, but there are tons; writes must've had lots of fun XD http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radar/FireEmblemAwakening
829194929872183298 2017-02-07 05:07:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting, Lance is Clair's brother in this canon, elsewhere they're cousins. And this isn't just a goof, she says brother again later.pic.twitter.com/sidiUaxC4F

828841225214103552 2017-02-06 05:42:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I ate this under the impression that it was a cinnamon roll so I really hope it wasn't actually a frog
828837984703283200 2017-02-06 05:29:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Also wild guessing you've seen Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, but if you haven't, there ya go, my all time fave

828835172707684352 2017-02-06 05:17:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The joke is that the PPG reboot isn't good but Samurai Jack returning is awesome.
828834851423928320 2017-02-06 05:16:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity That is Utonium XD
828831151481581568 2017-02-06 05:02:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> lol 20,000 feathers for 4 -> 5 stars in #FEHeroes and the RT event will only cover half of that. And that's just for ONE character hahaha...
828816509141184512 2017-02-06 04:03:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> What beautiful, fresh hell are you unleashing unto the Outrealms?! That's stupid amount of damage on 9 spaces. w h a
828800704877907968 2017-02-06 03:01:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT Everyone RT that, upgrading potential costs a stupid amount of feathers, and we need all we can get
828798811392921601 2017-02-06 02:53:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed DAMN You don't hold back, do you?
828798162148196352 2017-02-06 02:50:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed You can't protect if if I've already eaten it! You lose this round, Cubed. ;D

828794826506244096 2017-02-06 02:37:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is a cinnamon roll pure enough for this world, but not too pure. It can be protected, if you wish to, but I'mma eat it.pic.twitter.com/yCu8dz9xd6

828742240759586816 2017-02-06 23:08:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just love how it's bear tea time. Disbear and dat other bear just having a nice drink.
828741041683648512 2017-02-06 23:03:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic I bribe Kirby with the prospect of food and we have a feast instead of me getting soundly beaten! :D
828735745561079809 2017-02-06 22:42:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity JUST WAIT TILL I GET A 5 STAR LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, WE'LL BE ON EVEN FOOTING AND I'LL END YOUR DREAMS

828734624381726720 2017-02-06 22:38:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't care if Marthy is the Hero-King or if he has the weapon advantage, Cherche will end him faster than she ditched Virion.
828733948633182210 2017-02-06 22:35:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> You're dying just like any in Cherche's way. 5 more Attack than second place, Camilla in third Don't mess with ladies on wyvernspic.twitter.com/jkGpaLEZ2t
828732910878466048 2017-02-06 22:31:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> LISTEN Cherche has the most raw power of all my allies If two really good heroes both happen to be wyvern riders ...then yes.
828724087451181058 2017-02-06 21:56:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Next summon get me seven 5 star heroes make it happen Yin.

828605871244447744 2017-02-06 14:06:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Xenoblade Chronicles X's battle theme "Black Tar" has awesome instrumentals but hilariously poor rapping and lyricshttps://youtu.be/ePypW6n1egQ
828605382201397248 2017-02-06 14:04:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah that's too bad, but Sword Hand% is still pretty great!
828461158982103040 2017-02-05 04:31:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> You gotta rename Mystletainn "Demonspanker" tho, if you can rename it that is. Other than that, y e s
828459400985710592 2017-02-05 04:24:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> DOWN SWORD HAND!!
828458512070148096 2017-02-05 04:21:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> With all the FE hype, here's your casual reminder that Inigo is one of the funniest characters from Awakening.pic.twitter.com/79HJOC6JQh
828438376122609667 2017-02-05 03:01:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wish I could keep using Anna in #FEHeroes but as a two star, she's quickly getting outclassed D:
828433059972337666 2017-02-05 02:40:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> "IT'S THE SWI"
828425033131372544 2017-02-05 02:08:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> incorrect
828418168913793030 2017-02-05 01:40:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> what
828415168807915521 2017-02-05 01:29:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity You "send home" heroes, you get Hero Feathers in return
828410531505635330 2017-02-05 01:10:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love Mario Strikers Charged, my favorite football game!  ...am I doing this right? #sportsball
828406433729413120 2017-02-05 00:54:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Trying to be relevant with the Super Bowl, hmm Oh, hope to see my favorite player Chris Redfield out there! Yeah!
828405621733072897 2017-02-05 00:51:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz 21 Attack at level 1, I have four stars are level 13-15 who barely have 20s in Attack, dang :O
828278453753503745 2017-02-05 16:25:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Did my 3rd #FEHeroes roll, 2 Saizo, and extra Sophia (fused to current), 4 star Ogma and Olivia. I just want a 5 star like everyone else D:
828041480866496513 2017-02-04 00:44:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry @_razzchan_ Are muscles supposed to be that shiny?
828037246544666628 2017-02-04 00:27:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Toki wo Kizamu Uta/A Song To Pass The Time, CLANNAD After Story's OP, is a great song and you should listen to it and watch CLANNAD and cry
828026907635621893 2017-02-04 23:46:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ My guess would be yes, I've yet to have a 4 star get all stat boosts, doubt 3 star can even get all in one level up.
827999591912058880 2017-02-04 21:57:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I guess I never stopped to think about that one either. They're hollow, yet can turn anything, size irrelevant, into energy...
827995133077504000 2017-02-04 21:39:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> This was one I never even really thought about much, don't even know 'em 5 minutes and you exchange numbers hahahapic.twitter.com/9AeDifCkQi
827993087330885634 2017-02-04 21:31:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how self aware the manga is, GSC stepped it up in poking fun at different things or moments in the gamespic.twitter.com/bwj6MvNpq7
827991677554016256 2017-02-04 21:26:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon "Maid Mayhem" is probably one of the best titles I've ever seen for a person.
827987888419827712 2017-02-04 21:11:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @chuggaaconroy I only just learned a few days ago the Super Bowl is in my city. Who cares about sportsball anyway? :P
827986646742228992 2017-02-04 21:06:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think the GSC Adventures manga explained critical captures years before they became a mechanic! :Opic.twitter.com/iSNF9Q9G3N

827974962606698496 2017-02-04 20:19:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been retweeting this account a lot recently, because these mini-stories are pretty greathttps://twitter.com/MagicRealismBot/status/827971368817790977
827965432690794496 2017-02-04 19:41:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> All of the art is great but I really like the damaged ones quite a bit!http://imgur.com/a/xGB9F
827964786109509632 2017-02-04 19:39:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think the fact that *every* character has tattered/damaged art is one of my favorite things about #FEHeroes
827946940650364929 2017-02-04 18:28:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> 
827747978207227908 2017-02-03 05:17:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> And by "interesting lore" I mean like stuff on Samus' background, how she joined the Galactic Federation, how Ridley destroyed her home
827747450362400768 2017-02-03 05:15:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Metroid has been left in the space dust like it has for the most part, it'd be awesome to see it get a resurgence like FE did!
827747425137938432 2017-02-03 05:15:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Read quite a bit about Samus Aran and the Metroid series, there's a lot of really interesting lore in the franchise, it's really a shame
827714831117643779 2017-02-03 03:06:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well, considering I'm gonna spend $200+ on Pokmon Adventures manga, and ~$420 on Switch and games, either this is wrong or very well timed!pic.twitter.com/x3TuSioSHP
827698985800458242 2017-02-03 02:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo 20 orbs! 5, 4, 4, 4, 3 for each.

827689830507225090 2017-02-03 01:26:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chinese food is definitively, objectively, and subjectively, the second best kind of food.

827536605590216705 2017-02-03 15:17:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> #FEHeroes is pretty fun, love the artstyle, music is great, and Anna is your first party member so yeah GOTY

827375164123910144 2017-02-02 04:36:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity For real tho, that sounds pretty great, sounds like you can get a lot out of it! :D

827374163597856768 2017-02-02 04:32:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like Pokmon Duel's battery thing, you could get so many single player matches, I haven't even get close to halfway out
827373814912839680 2017-02-02 04:31:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> How is the limited play time with FE Heroes? As in, can you play a lot before running out of whatever and you have to wait?
827365458231881728 2017-02-02 03:57:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gotta say, I really admire how you can self analyze yourself and see your own faults. Keep on keepin' on, you got my support! :D
827353775555956736 2017-02-02 03:11:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll save you by distracting you, I'm sure FE Heroes has tons of characters for you to fall in love with and oh wait.

827324288638341123 2017-02-02 01:14:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Riza Hawkeye and Trisha Elric, the interaction we truly deserve. Or one of Kimblee's men. Or Truth. Every character.

826932011155804162 2017-02-01 23:15:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Never trust balloons.
826870183948144640 2017-02-01 19:09:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I really agree with Masahiro Sakurai's thoughts on the decision for a paid service. If anyone still has issues paying, consider this.pic.twitter.com/nEukEXt92Z
826866300198776834 2017-02-01 18:54:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity The yearly model is made to be easier on Nintendo to support online. A tiny 2/mon from ppl versus a sizable 20 all at once
826855741126561792 2017-02-01 18:12:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> But, of course, inb4 people complain about it being too expensive, cuz 5 a year for Pokmon Bank is too much for some people hahaha
826854186331537409 2017-02-01 18:06:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is a lot better than I expected. I was thinking like 5 a month, 60 a year, but it's less than half that?! I'll take it!https://twitter.com/serkantoto/status/826841955111890944
826792002419380224 2017-02-01 13:59:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon I'm super sure I read somewhere there will be in game chat too, weird how they don't mention it as much
826791488726130689 2017-02-01 13:57:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's also voice chat in game iirc (oddly how that's seldom mentioned), but Discord may still work better
826647749860929536 2017-01-31 04:25:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Every time I read "It's no use?" or "It's useless"? MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAMUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
826621086003507200 2017-01-31 02:39:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Mario is still the most popular video game franchise so yeah I'd say so

826287786336583682 2017-01-30 04:35:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> How you know you've watched a lot of subbed anime? Every time you read "Impossible!" or "it can't be!!" you hear "M-masaka!!" in your head.
826258092082003968 2017-01-30 02:37:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> 
826256971716255744 2017-01-30 02:33:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> What kind? :O
826212362382372864 2017-01-30 23:35:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> So Nakamura's impact on my life is a big one I'm very thankful for, may he rest in peace.
826212322528096256 2017-01-30 23:35:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Namco and especially Pac-Man were a big part of my childhood, I enjoyed a lot of their classics. It's how I started to become a gamer.
826212291238588416 2017-01-30 23:35:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> For any who don't know, Masaya Nakamura, the founder of Namco, passed away recently. Namco kickstarted my love of gaming.
826191680810401797 2017-01-30 22:13:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp This is my favorite video of yours, would totally watch a Tic Tac Toe anime
826190987944919040 2017-01-30 22:10:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles But yeah that really seems like the only "great" thing about it, if it's just "gay: the anime" then it's not really helping
826190483382743041 2017-01-30 22:08:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I say YoI is good to the extent that a gay couple got popular, but if they didn't even do it right then that kinda only hurts it
826122308427317250 2017-01-30 17:38:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> SO
826113327994642432 2017-01-30 17:02:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles They've mentioned multiple times they're in debt, I don't understand why they keep doing this
826113125275533312 2017-01-30 17:01:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not a big "really wish that was real" moment, I've played MK8 before and I'm hyped for other stuff more, but it's just funny to get denied
826112574391476224 2017-01-30 16:59:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Had a dream I was about to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch, race about to start, 3, 2, 1... ALARM!! ALARM!! GET UP!! Every time haha
825858626225074178 2017-01-29 00:10:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Then the main issue prolly goes back to just being associated with Trump. Either way, I hope they help keep things control
825857085413924864 2017-01-29 00:04:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Also the contrast of Lyft showing refugee support while Uber didn't, from what I've seen today, anyway.
825856975791616001 2017-01-29 00:03:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SadLilCheese Since Trump = bad, anyone who associates with him is to be hated. I'm guessing that's the logic here, anyway
825852085539368960 2017-01-29 23:44:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie That's cuz they're the ones disciplining you.
825851781590704128 2017-01-29 23:43:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Kecleon are shop owners in the Mystery Dungeon games, tho I guess Meowth/Persian could work too with a coin/money motif!
825847404490588160 2017-01-29 23:25:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Would love to see Anna! :D
825773010724462593 2017-01-29 18:30:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oooh, now that Bank is out, has anyone transferred a Gengar up to Sun/Moon, see if it still has Levitate or it changes to Cursed Body?
825707314590146562 2017-01-29 14:08:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I must either have a super accurate internal clock, or subconsciously always aware of the time because my dreams very often line up w/alarm
825487846194761728 2017-01-28 23:36:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Acquaintance at best, if you really want to put a label on it.
825446352809234432 2017-01-28 20:52:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Actually, in hindsight That sounds really dangerous. oh. Hope they take care of themselves.
825445834552700928 2017-01-28 20:49:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> What does a snorkeling team do? Try to out breathe other teams? Do colleges have national snorkeling competitions?!
825431184964538369 2017-01-28 19:51:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: I'll have pizza for lunch, haven't had any in a while *sees bro eating leftovers from *pizza* restaurant from last night* Me: oh yeah
825417779079704576 2017-01-28 18:58:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KeithMontalbo Team Skull, Ultra Beast, and Gladion's are my faves of the bunch!

825125515224895489 2017-01-27 23:37:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity I think it's a system parents can use to limit how much cashes you spend on gems, just a guess tho
825125182373298176 2017-01-27 23:35:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT, need 1 GB, huh? Time to make like Teru Mikami and DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE

825006806284005376 2017-01-27 15:45:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed YES! This is the exact response I was looking for!

824429927130882050 2017-01-25 01:33:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity Hey, our boy is killin' it in TWO Smash games. So yeah, not super exclusive :P
824422532145094656 2017-01-25 01:03:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Legit surprised tho that Henry is ahead of Lon'qu
824422375764721664 2017-01-25 01:03:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well it looks like the rest of my votes are going towards Anna and Henry, sorry Morgan!
824398657252364288 2017-01-25 23:28:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic enough to make up for it because it requires you to play through the main game, which isn't good at all.
824398615493931012 2017-01-25 23:28:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic I forgot a big one, (and this may be my only chance to say this), Sonic Adventure 2 is terrible and Chao Garden isn't good
824392722710675456 2017-01-25 23:05:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic Not to say DPPt are bad, they're great, we just don't need a rehashing of mostly the same game; we could just get DP for VC
824392009037344768 2017-01-25 23:02:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic I don't think there should be Pokmon DP remakes or anymore third versions like Platinum and Pokmon RBY have aged poorly.
824373236926398464 2017-01-25 21:47:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AlqTheTentacle There are too many things wrong with this, I don't even know where to begin
824360672280670210 2017-01-25 20:57:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT Sept. 30th may be a placeholder date, since that's the last day of Q3, so don't complain about late wait yet even tho some will anyway
824279937813270533 2017-01-25 15:37:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, as expected, Lyn, Ike, and Lucina are top 3, not sure if I should go all Anna from here on or half and half with female Morgan
824279764223623168 2017-01-25 15:36:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Who is always there for you, providing you with highest quality weapons? Your girl Anna, of course. https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/series/111/heroes/111049?locale=en-US #FEChoose
824077453190692865 2017-01-24 02:12:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie In thinking about it tho, it would get confusing tracking what 'mons you do and don't have now that all are on the table now
824077236840132609 2017-01-24 02:11:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie There's little point, really, since you can get the charm and certificate w/o it. Also Sun/Moon itself didn't update, just Bank
824065329555013632 2017-01-24 01:24:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah yes, you guys have fun with "WHY THE HELL WON'T THE ESHOP WORK I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED BANK NOW!!!!!!" 2017

823992564835610625 2017-01-24 20:35:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Subtle messaging that the uprising has already quietly begun, trust no one, not even yourself
823964601863852032 2017-01-24 18:44:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry @FloralSerenity Thought the standing date was still March, tho they just haven't said anything on it in a while
823909402608549888 2017-01-24 15:04:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> And even then I'm in no rush to get the charm or anything is it's just whatever to me
823909225722220544 2017-01-24 15:04:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh I only really care to make getting my complete collection of 'mons easier, cuz there isn't even a Nat' 'dex

823901799912525824 2017-01-24 14:34:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm excited for the Bank update cuz then people will stop complaining about it & will find a new thing to cry about & oh wait it never ends

823645818175492098 2017-01-23 21:37:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Noticed that the WWE Scooby Doo special was on TV, apparently it's about a legend of a Flaming Ghost Bear who wants to fight wrestlers
823622634726375425 2017-01-23 20:05:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> I picked Henry in the Fire Emblem Heroes Choose Your Legends event! https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/series/111/heroes/111031?locale=en-US #FEChoose
823550097543700485 2017-01-23 15:16:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @doomdesiring Oh wow that actually really clears that up then, thanks a bunch!
823382123767808000 2017-01-22 04:09:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity That too but tbh that game didn't really look a bit interesting haha
823382038837338112 2017-01-22 04:09:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well I guess we'll wait until E3 or whatever Direct they squeeze between now, the Switch release, and E3
823381735115255811 2017-01-22 04:07:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I know the release date was "2017", and it's still early 2017, but I still haven't forgotten about it.
823381228904677376 2017-01-22 04:05:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope Nintendo mentions/gives more info on that Pikmin 3DS game they revealed back in September. Almost 5 months and nothing more
823309876696858624 2017-01-22 23:22:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's fine that some of them like Krillin or Gohan move on with life, but at least keep them relevant for a while or somethin
823309186859667457 2017-01-22 23:19:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Even Piccolo, who used to be a god kinda, was just chillin' at Gohan's babysitting...okay that's pretty funny, but not okay.
823309025613848577 2017-01-22 23:19:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> My other issue with DB, it's the Goku and Vegeta show featuring one saga characters.
823306317863460864 2017-01-22 23:08:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was the worst in Resurrection F, she basically told Krillin "you know I'm stronger than you right" but nah Krillin goes
823305762751582208 2017-01-22 23:06:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my major problems with DB, female char. barely hold importance, even 18, who's implied to be stronger than Krillin
823272984580333569 2017-01-22 20:55:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree WOW, no hate here, that's pretty hilarious XD
823271749877895169 2017-01-22 20:50:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I might need to watch this show
823271681867255808 2017-01-22 20:50:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> the girl ballet dances off screen. Squirrel then looks at the camera, bored, and yells, "that was pointless, onto the next scene!"
823271597918273540 2017-01-22 20:50:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just saw another scene, squirrel brushes off a flight attendant, main trio drops out of nowhere, guys chase after flight attendant
823269791163187200 2017-01-22 20:43:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> They then molded the dude into a chocolate bunny and donated it to an orphanage. What an odd show haha
823269581108244481 2017-01-22 20:42:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just saw a scene of Animaniacs, without prior context, of a football team beating up a dude, main trio and group of nuns watching
823221951753814017 2017-01-22 17:33:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> She'd have to be early 20s if 11/12 in Emerald, but if like 15-17 in E, she'd be mid-late 20s and ARGH GAME FREAK WITH YOUR AGE AMBIGUITY
823221274143035393 2017-01-22 17:30:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> But then she gets ship tease with Ash in the anime, puts her on the younger side, but Sun/Moon is much more mature, early to mid 20s prollypic.twitter.com/RT8NukPXnW
823220961424056321 2017-01-22 17:29:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Slightly on topic: how old is Anabel?! This gosh darn ambiguously aged designs make her anywhere between 11-19 for Emerald artworkpic.twitter.com/0ouHQlqlXV
823217773895712770 2017-01-22 17:16:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> And since you can fight her in Emerald, she can't have fallen before you meet her
823217647831674880 2017-01-22 17:15:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> And the reason Faller!Anabel has to fall after Gen I/III is to assume that, canonically, Brendan/May defeat her at the Battle Frontier
823217347846688768 2017-01-22 17:14:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think I figured it out, the only issue I have is with Gen II/IV and V's gap being 3+ years. Still adds up, but I wanna know the supportpic.twitter.com/U1MmOZJvf0
823059357122396161 2017-01-21 06:46:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> But that may be enough speculation and piecing things together for one night, I'm off, have a good one! :D
823059146673156096 2017-01-21 06:46:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> the exact battle theme ripped from Emerald when you face her in the Battle Tree.
823059114142089216 2017-01-21 06:45:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> btw, "Faller!Anabel" seems to be from the Emerald dimension specifically, she has faint memories of her role at the Battle Tower and uses
823058409285177344 2017-01-21 06:43:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> tl;dr, I love the universe building/expansion the Pokmon franchise has given, best part about Gen VI and Sun/Moon's aftergame imo!
823058219022987265 2017-01-21 06:42:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> about the other Anabel, since she's not a famous Frontier Brain cuz there is no Hoenn Battle Frontier...phew, there's a lot to unwrap haha
823058076387446784 2017-01-21 06:41:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> And apparently Faller!Anabel has been with the International Police for at least 10 years, and it seems neither she nor the police know
823057686812094464 2017-01-21 06:40:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> 2 Anabels  And by Mega Evo dimension, I mean the dimension that has Mega Evolution. AKA XYORAS & Sun/Moon
823057593677578240 2017-01-21 06:39:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> was referenced in the Battle Maison in ORAS. This means the Frontier Brains still exist in the Mega Evo dimension, and now there are...
823057264563064836 2017-01-21 06:38:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> So Hoenn doesn't have a Battle Frontier in the Mega Evo dimension, Battle Resort in ORAS is where the Frontier was in E, and Pike Queen Lucy
823055709029990400 2017-01-21 06:32:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> And with Ultra Wormholes and Anabel's presence in Sun/Moon has us dealing with time travel AND alternate dimensions, more than ORAS covered
823055282624430080 2017-01-21 06:30:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> 3 games that released 4 years apart, but with events all happening at once (theoretically), really cool to me, brings the world to life imo!
823054855455576064 2017-01-21 06:29:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like, while Nate/Rosa were taking on Ghetsis in B2W2, Calem/Serena could be fighting Lysandre in XY, and Gladion is taking Nully from Aether
823054609820303360 2017-01-21 06:28:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Either way, it always interests me to think of the Pokmon world on a larger scale, things are happening to characters outside current game
823054063516389376 2017-01-21 06:25:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Exact age for those games will be something I frustrate over later, but the 2 year gap between B2W2XY and Sun/Moon is still consistent
823053814441725952 2017-01-21 06:24:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how Bulbapedia just figured, you know what, somewhere between 19-29 for B2W2XY and 21-31 cuz what is physical aging
823053477584732160 2017-01-21 06:23:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> And because of Sugimori's style, age is ambiguous, even young trial captains are somewhere between 11-19, who knows how old Red & Blue are
823052328840400896 2017-01-21 06:19:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thought Red and Blue could help, but the gap between Gen II/IV and V is at least 3 years, that vagueness throws it all off
823051713619918849 2017-01-21 06:16:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Yeah, based off Colress, Dexio, and Sina's dialogue, it's the latest game in the timeline, but I wanna know exactly how much
823051293799358465 2017-01-21 06:14:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> but Bulbapedia doesn't have their full transcript for Sun/Moon.
823051269883445248 2017-01-21 06:14:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> This could probably best be done with a quote, I feel like, of all characters, Dexio and Sina hold the answer,
823050867213561856 2017-01-21 06:13:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> According to Bulbapedia, Sun/Moon takes place about 2 years after B2W2XY's events, can anyone help corroborate this? I'm pretty curious.
823032795496927232 2017-01-21 05:01:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Note, a special edition with invisible ink via a blacklight will be available in summer, if that interests you https://www.amazon.com/Gravity-Falls-Journal-3-Special/dp/1368002501/ref=s9_simh_gw_g14_i1_r?_encoding=UTF8&fpl=fresh&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=&pf_rd_r=34CZTDG3YZAJCY3PECHM&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=f58829ef-ff4e-4868-b5c8-fe8c3bd9f769&pf_rd_i=desktop
823032041293942784 2017-01-21 04:58:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cool trivia on characters and weirdness of GF, explores events not covered in the show, and gives the Author a lot of development!
823031621762879492 2017-01-21 04:56:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you want more from the Gravity Falls show, then you should definitely pick up the series' central book, Journal #3
823007511842291713 2017-01-21 03:20:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL you can legally trademark a person's name. So now you learned too.
822960864512774144 2017-01-21 00:15:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> You know, speaking hypothetically. Not like that happened just now or anything. Nah.
822960786805026819 2017-01-21 00:15:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> That way you can properly respond, regardless of accuracy, and end the conversation less awkwardly than otherwise.
822960516226224129 2017-01-21 00:14:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> The thing that saves you when you don't understand what someone says is when they end the question with "no?" or some sort of response
822918164531019776 2017-01-21 21:25:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> They prolly would've paired up partner Pokmon with FE cast, that'd be interesting to see, wondering what FE characters' fave Pokmon are!
822916468224442369 2017-01-21 21:19:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Would've been really interesting to see the medieval combat and magic systems would blend with the unique creatures in Pokmon
822916129517699072 2017-01-21 21:17:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Apparently the game that became TMS was originally going to be Fire Emblem X Pokmon!http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/08/20/tokyo-mirage-sessions-was-originally-going-to-be-a-pok-233-mon-crossover.aspx
822914925353988098 2017-01-21 21:13:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd love to see another game in its unique style!
822914849718042624 2017-01-21 21:12:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> With all the recent Fire Emblem hype, I'd love to see a Pokmon Conquest sequel! imo one of the franchise's best side series games!
822858533335089152 2017-01-21 17:28:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I picked Morgan (female) in the Fire Emblem Heroes Choose Your Legends event! https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/series/111/heroes/111043?locale=en-US #FEChoose
822829866341007360 2017-01-21 15:35:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ReubTube96 Nah, can't really just spending that much just for a few extra pages, still really cool tho!
822820900278009856 2017-01-21 14:59:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@cool_as_heck The best rendition of the "GF: Come over" meme.
822678686906335232 2017-01-20 05:34:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> A good reason to get Gravity Falls Journal #3 is for funny stuff not revealed in show. Like the Author getting a regretable tattoo.pic.twitter.com/TUwwfCaPQl
822466719331414017 2017-01-20 15:32:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another day of #FEChoose voting. You know which FE character in the most games? Marth? Nope. Ike? Nah. So who then? A N N A #VoteForAnna
822298408950132741 2017-01-19 04:23:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> 13 days until FE Heroes 42 days until Switch and BotW 74 days until Persona 5 119 days until FE Echoes 2017 lookin' pretty hype so far
822199262188601344 2017-01-19 21:49:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I dunno, ask me, seeing a whole ton of permissions for a picture and filter app sends off a ton of warning signs but that may be just me
822198856775532546 2017-01-19 21:47:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> So yeah you know that thing where you're asked to read and approve things and you just speed through 'em yeah don't do that
822112294855471104 2017-01-19 16:03:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have two preventative measures for this, plugging in headphones before login and muting my laptop but one day I'll forget both
822111702498115586 2017-01-19 16:01:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I changed my laptop's startup tune to the got an item jingle from Metroid Prime and it's really loud and one day it's gonna go off in class
822104432456462340 2017-01-19 15:32:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Might be it, seems like a strange reaction tho, to just upchuck everything
822103101482172416 2017-01-19 15:27:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles You okay? D:
821891391403986944 2017-01-18 01:25:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz I've seen same day, Feb 2nd.
821886824704569344 2017-01-18 01:07:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lucina's future may not be written, but mine certainly is! And that's JUST FE. Still got like (no exaggeration) 50 other games I want
821886745901940737 2017-01-18 01:07:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp Is that the stone mask from JJBA?
821886362479632384 2017-01-18 01:05:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just hit me that I still need to play Fates & now there's Heroes, Echoes, Warriors, AND FE Switch over just 1 year? Lots of FE in my future
821885829098442752 2017-01-18 01:03:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Who? renaePetch
821875142783537156 2017-01-18 00:21:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> in real life I've had.
821875123582013440 2017-01-18 00:21:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> setting. I tied it with philosophy somehow but everyone just judged me and I think it's one of the most likely dreams to actually happen
821874681896648705 2017-01-18 00:19:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was hard talking about it cuz I kept laughing about the fact I was unironically praising a show about butt and boob sports in an academic
821874184536158209 2017-01-18 00:17:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last night I had a dream that I lectured to my philosophy class about how Keijo!!!!!!!! is a hilarious show and people should watch it
821864607690137602 2017-01-18 23:39:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @cool_as_heck Best part is the voice clip from the Fitness Gram pushup test XD
821861562642272257 2017-01-18 23:27:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> #FEHeroes will probably lack a soft reset feature, I hope everyone is prepared for FE with consequences hahaha
821852593618030592 2017-01-18 22:51:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ But for real tho the top 10 will be featured in an FE themed calendar, maybe we can push for 5th-10th place?
821852147226644480 2017-01-18 22:49:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ If we push hard enough for Anna or Inigo or Anna, I think we can make an impact probably maybe voteforAnna jk
821851643838861318 2017-01-18 22:47:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ Anna cuz she's best and our boy, Roy! But I also say stick to Inigo, I think he's pre cool and may be more popular than u think!
821850655002427392 2017-01-18 22:44:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tho they said pre-register for #FEHeroes starts tomorrow for Android, it looks like it's live now, as I just pre-reg'd, just a heads up!
821848876067987460 2017-01-18 22:36:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> 13 days of #FEChoose voting, that's 13 votes for Anna per person, right? Yes.
821847443084050432 2017-01-18 22:31:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I picked Anna in the Fire Emblem Heroes Choose Your Legends event! https://events.fire-emblem-heroes.com/vote/series/111/heroes/111049?locale=en-US #FEChoose
821845749520535552 2017-01-18 22:24:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> #FEHeroes looks really detailed for a mobile game, first mobile game I've ever been excited to play!
821732083592810496 2017-01-18 14:52:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy I have a problem with one of these.  I don't have a hair dryer.
821727894368034816 2017-01-18 14:36:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Unrelated, I got soaked three times waiting for a bus that wouldn't show. So yeah how's your morning?
821727493551955969 2017-01-18 14:34:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> You'll tsunami wave the poor person standing there and you won't even care
821727298479128577 2017-01-18 14:33:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> If it's rained enough for water to puddle around the curb and there's a person standing there DON'T DRIVE FAST INTO THAT LANE
821589655363715072 2017-01-17 05:26:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> but now I'm oddly fired up about this semester. Whatever my place is out there in the world, I'm gonna find it and kick ass at it! >:D
821589485695668225 2017-01-17 05:26:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last year was my worst year academically, but I'm putting that behind me. I don't quite know what I'm doing with my life yet,
821583498217656321 2017-01-17 05:02:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reading Gravity Falls Journal #3 and who writes sentences like that?! ...huh, that sounds familiar.pic.twitter.com/I0XHUVP0nJ
821377597418377216 2017-01-17 15:24:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen @FloralSerenity Correction, always from Lucina, and can get it if Lucina's sister has Aether.
821377418120327168 2017-01-17 15:23:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_Firnen @FloralSerenity Morgan will always inherit Aether from Lucina or Lucina's sister.
821360455700639744 2017-01-17 14:16:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Trying to start school with a better attitude, looking forward to 2 classes; maybe I'll do better if I don't hate it?
821357785921257472 2017-01-17 14:05:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I guess so? Thought it was fine but in close comparison to the Vita, it's barely/not even half as good
821200781814730756 2017-01-16 03:41:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then again, I also don't use my Vita nearly as often, so I'm wondering/thinking it's the age of the 3DS or Vita's is just better
821200632220618752 2017-01-16 03:41:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> This may be because I've been playing my Vita a lot recently and that seems to have a battery life of around 6+ hrs on a full charge
821200326267113472 2017-01-16 03:39:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FloralSerenity 3DSmall specifically
821200243236732928 2017-01-16 03:39:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought it was just a problem with Moon needing more power, but just playing FE Awakening only lasts me like 2-2.5ish hours on full charge
821200052244938753 2017-01-16 03:38:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Has anyone who's had a 3DSmall for since launch year notice battery life lasting shorter than it used to?
821132267833724928 2017-01-16 23:09:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I keep forgetting I schedule these tweets haha
821131673446268928 2017-01-16 23:07:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy National Nothing Day!! The day where we celebrate absolutely nothing at all. The time where we reflect on nothing at all.
821125077018279939 2017-01-16 22:40:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> But here it makes sense where the rest it doesn't 0/10 consistency.pic.twitter.com/sMOk9ZPcW4
821123854819061760 2017-01-16 22:35:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Where does Jotaro's hair begin? And where does his hat end? Or is it all one?! :Opic.twitter.com/fUHRczT4Hu
820856958731292672 2017-01-15 04:55:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Which is interesting because I haven't even played Sunshine (have seen many playthroughs tho), just shows how strong the sandbox style is!
820856698483130368 2017-01-15 04:54:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Galaxy 1 & 2 and 3D World (never played 3D Land) were great games, but really glad to be back on the sandbox path again, hyped for SMOhttps://twitter.com/Stealth___/status/820269715260145664
820845913363148804 2017-01-15 04:11:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Then yeah that's prolly better to stop 'em now also that's pretty intense
820845018403442689 2017-01-15 04:07:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Then again, if they don't take it well, it could end up causing an unnecessary mess or something so I dunno really
820844806096224256 2017-01-15 04:07:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I'd say honesty, however "brutal", is nicer in the long run, probably be more crushed if they got hopes up only for shut down
820840784106835970 2017-01-15 03:51:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: It's almost 10, I should eat dinner *doesn't find anything I want to make* Me: Eh, I'm not that hungry, I'll eat tomorrow Don't be me.
820726226172215297 2017-01-15 20:15:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> ~13 seconds on Switch vs. ~29 on Wii U. Over twice as long really shows the difference in power at play herehttps://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/820725497038589952
820717440493559808 2017-01-15 19:41:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry So yes, rip Bubbler indeed
820717387838357505 2017-01-15 19:40:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Exact quote: "there's not a single special in this game that has been seen in a Splatoon game before" (about 1:56:10 on archive)
820716166910013441 2017-01-15 19:35:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry During the Treehouse presentation iirc they said all specials will be new, that seems to lean towards only new, not 100% sure
820693286511869953 2017-01-15 18:05:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Holding gun in right, would kick with left leg, would have left arm out in front for balance
820671455113465856 2017-01-15 16:38:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> And that's both the JoyCon and the Pro Controller having all of those features. Still pricey, yes, but justified imo
820671261441400832 2017-01-15 16:37:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Switch controllers are seemingly overpriced, but it makes sense. They have HD rumble, amiibo functionality, and gyro motion controls
820376471743172608 2017-01-14 21:06:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> THIS IS SOOOO COOOL AND AMAZING AND AWESOME AND OTHER GOOD WORDS THANK YOU https://twitter.com/TadBitDiGital/status/820374748412727296
820276410229157893 2017-01-14 14:28:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon It's either one or the other, never both
820073302739795969 2017-01-13 01:01:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Now to jam out to the full version of the amazing OP! :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoY66lqmcYA
820072516496621568 2017-01-13 00:58:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Really liked Joseph and I'm really excited to see what adventures the Joestar lineage will have to endure next!
820072295872024576 2017-01-13 00:57:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just finished JJBA Battle Tendency and I really enjoyed it. Was kinda on the fence of the series during Phantom Blood, but BT was awesome
820029569948352512 2017-01-13 22:07:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I dunno, something about taking the time to explain would seem lame, but it allows the view to fully understand the awesomeness & I love it
820029399378624514 2017-01-13 22:06:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite things in anime is when a character explains their own or someone else's attack/technique.
820025715970154497 2017-01-13 21:52:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Found some numbers, as of March 31, 2011, 5.82 mil on Wii, 1.32 mil on GC. As of Sept 30, 2015 8.85 mil total
820025398012641280 2017-01-13 21:51:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> in the franchise, yes, even outselling OoT
820025339090993154 2017-01-13 21:50:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not sure, can't find that, but the fact that it was on two consoles helped the game a lot, TP is still best selling game
820024828640034817 2017-01-13 21:48:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Actually GameCube TP came out a week to a month (depending on your region) later than Wii, except for Japan, same day
820019306532585472 2017-01-13 21:26:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I realized, we've adventured with Mario in space, twice, awesome! But we're back down to earth again and I'm still hyped? Impressive imo!https://twitter.com/Papapishu/status/819775760869113857
819968061759492096 2017-01-13 18:03:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love Nintendo Treehouse events like this. Talks with devs and so much gameplay, it  gets me so excited for future games! :D
819955332776660992 2017-01-13 17:12:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> And one of those games is BotW, with hours and hours and hours and hours of content? Nah, why bother keeping busy with that?
819949242374615041 2017-01-13 16:48:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw the most action F-Zero is getting on Switch is Big Blue and Mute City on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
819948344189550592 2017-01-13 16:44:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Ah yeah you're right, but if you need more games on the Switch, that's an option there too :P
819944361882488832 2017-01-13 16:29:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I guess I'm just patient :P
819944325165576193 2017-01-13 16:28:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> New Bomberman and Sonic Mania, if we extend past 1st party, can be thrown in there too, and more on the way beyond summer.
819943040555085824 2017-01-13 16:23:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> But even just only including first party: BotW, ARMS, Spla2n, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will all be out by the end of summer. Pretty good imo
819942251099025408 2017-01-13 16:20:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find it funny people are complaining about the lack of launch titles and I'm pretty sure little to no consoles had a strong launch library
819938829201211393 2017-01-13 16:07:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo's site has a list of most if not all the games on the Nintendo Switch http://www.nintendo.com/games/game-guide/?pv=true#filter/switch|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|featured|des|-|-
819937030679523330 2017-01-13 15:59:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah that's fair, tho I remember reading that should be out by March but who knows
819935081359872001 2017-01-13 15:52:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well it's more a Warriors game with Fire Emblem characters and worlds, but yes
819920129744109568 2017-01-13 14:52:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo Treehouse is showing off ARMS, now that I get to see it, I'm liking it a bit more, I like how there are interchangeable arms.
819904543769108480 2017-01-13 13:50:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah, Japan has always had the game, it's even on Wii U VC hahahahttps://twitter.com/spavettios/status/819794509710041088
819792796684984320 2017-01-12 06:26:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo Switch Presentation Thoughts  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1sphbv7
819786586246115329 2017-01-12 06:02:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Okay, this is the funniest parental controls video ever http://www.nintendo.com/switch/family-fun/
819775553091706881 2017-01-12 05:18:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo dropped this on YT watch nao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-2MrYlm-io
819773950452375552 2017-01-12 05:11:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> But I am definitely hyped, will post an overall thoughts Twitlonger later
819773839517184001 2017-01-12 05:11:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wasn't planning on getting Switch at launch for reasons independent of price/other things, and was already sold on it cuz Nintendo
819763246651547648 2017-01-12 04:29:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not called Spla2n, no buy
819250456329338880 2017-01-11 18:31:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait they're Strawberry and I don't even like that flavor so never mind, back to granola bars for me
819250164057645057 2017-01-11 18:30:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> I feel like an idiot now cuz all this time I could've been having more but nah it's been either a granola bar or nothing
819249907722813443 2017-01-11 18:29:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Aside from a granola bar, I skip breakfast cuz I'm too lazy to prepare something but I *just* realized we have Pop-Tarts
819225655623749632 2017-01-11 16:53:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I updated this to include Gen VII 'mons, now that I've seen them all and have had time to think about them.pic.twitter.com/v0c082iefi
818607410940153857 2017-01-09 23:56:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Bagbot29 No it's been 30 F the past few days
818605871567687680 2017-01-09 23:50:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects Two week old pics, but when it gets really cold, my pupper Sally dons this adorable jacketpic.twitter.com/r0FoQdNXGG
818293446209400832 2017-01-08 03:08:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> In case you were wondering for whatever reason, yes, I am indeed listening to Gladion's battle theme, posing like an edgelord.
818144992736710657 2017-01-08 17:19:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does Bowser's hair sometimes look like weird red frosting?pic.twitter.com/EmoXHdYGhM
817903740585906176 2017-01-07 01:20:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm satisfied with my care
817901587561611264 2017-01-07 01:11:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> balalalalalalalalalalah
817876218766913538 2017-01-07 23:31:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> QUIT TALKING ABOUT THIS YOU'RE MAKING ME WANT AN FE WARRIORS SO BAD NOW
817871345967054849 2017-01-07 23:11:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Somehow even more heavy handed with the bonds moral of the franchise than Ultimax was, but had more likeable characters and better plot haha
817870495618105345 2017-01-07 23:08:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished Persona 4: Dancing All Night's story and tbh it was better than I expected. Premise is still hilarious but the music is top notch
817826732061421573 2017-01-07 20:14:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> And by that, I mean the second fighting game, Ultimax
817826680257515523 2017-01-07 20:14:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw the Persona game about dancing to solve problems has better plot twists than the Persona fighting game where you fight people.
817502002724925442 2017-01-06 22:44:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Next time you KO a Kangaskhan in Sun/Moon, look at the baby, they turn to look at the mom and looks so sad and now feel bad I'm sorry
817199818099589122 2017-01-05 02:43:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> o h b o yhttps://twitter.com/NinSwitchNews/status/817196414585290753
817185858579296256 2017-01-05 01:47:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Is there a faster way to gain levels than E4 rematches? Cuz I wanna mess with Hyper Training but 30 levels is a long trek
817090620200275968 2017-01-05 19:29:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah, their HAs were all changed to Inner Focus, tho you couldn't get them with the absorb abilities legitimately anyway
817090265349554176 2017-01-05 19:27:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess I'll have to pay attention to my Gengar and see if their ability is altered when I transfer him, I'm really curious about this now.
817089968975790080 2017-01-05 19:26:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> From quick reading, it seems the only case where a non-Hidden Ability was changed is Gengar's case. All others were adding a 2nd ability
817088078531674112 2017-01-05 19:19:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pelipper and Torkoal are a different case, they gained additional abilities, Gengar's was swapped out entirely
817086418610745344 2017-01-05 19:12:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Actually has there been a case where a Pokmon's regular ability changed between gens? If so we can possibly know the answer to this already
817086119997304832 2017-01-05 19:11:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> For anyone who doesn't know, Gengar in Gen VII now has Cursed Body instead of Levitate. Does anyone think transferred Gengar will change ?
816431127808319488 2017-01-03 23:48:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Award shows, even anime ones, are dumb Also me: Oh, CR's Anime Awards voting is up lemme get on that
816394358291361792 2017-01-03 21:22:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've had this Vita for 2 years and this is the third game I have for it. Second is the Jak and Daxter Trilogy port, but it is not good haha
816391387654553600 2017-01-03 21:10:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chrimma present finally came in from Europe! It's dance time! :Dpic.twitter.com/O0VqEUIOyD
816046455886675972 2017-01-02 22:20:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm pretty sure it became 5pm about 12 minutes prior to you writing this tweet. So, that's when. You're welcome.
816032451541745667 2017-01-02 21:24:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Actually had to use a Max Revive so my whole party was good, so yeah props to the game for making me care
816031947222818816 2017-01-02 21:22:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon That part was rough for me I was so focused on saving her I forgot to restock on healing items; ran out of revives
815738229391560704 2017-01-01 01:55:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> My favorite part about Finder is that "7.8/10 too much water" became an ascended meme and is one of the comments in the game, but that's it
815734902821965824 2017-01-01 01:42:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I never played Snap and Finder never really interested me, and thought it was pretty boring in game, but lots of people were hyped for it
815734712710950912 2017-01-01 01:41:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Curious, did anyone actually enjoy the Pok Finder in Sun/Moon? If you do or don't please add if you played a lot of Snap or not
815700669244076032 2017-01-01 23:26:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kirby 64 Boss, Persona 4's Mist...and I can't think of anymore after like 10 minutes. Favorites are hard, all time favorites are harder.
815697304258756608 2017-01-01 23:12:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> And it may be recency bias, but it's prolly really high up there on fave music of all time. But I have a hard time picking that, 2 many good
815695868640817152 2017-01-01 23:07:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> And if for some reason you were curious on what versions specifically: HGSS Johto Gym Leader and FRLG, B2W2, or Origins Kanto Champion.
815695485109489665 2017-01-01 23:05:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> The bass is amazing, the part where it pauses is so good, the background guitar is awesome and Gladion's just so cool it's all so damn good
815694516233584641 2017-01-01 23:01:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gladion's battle theme is probably my new favorite Pokmon battle theme ever, beating out PWT Final, Johto Gym Leader, and Kanto Champion
815590760875773952 2017-01-01 16:09:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm gonna start looking into music stuff *today* and tomorrow and the day after and keep going, I'm going to make this happen.
815590604084310016 2017-01-01 16:08:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> I really don't want this to be a thing I start working on for like 3 days then get lazy again, I'm determined to not let that happen again.
815590176097497092 2017-01-01 16:07:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> -Do better in school -Find a major I'd actually like pursuing
815590154257698821 2017-01-01 16:07:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> -Learn how to read music and make video game remixes (have been wanting to do this since April, need to stop being so darn lazy and do it)
815590004374306816 2017-01-01 16:06:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't normally make New Year resolutions but this time I have so goals for once:
815431476447707136 2016-12-31 05:36:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Will 2017 be a good year? That's not up to a magical force in the universe. That's up to us. So let's all make it a great one! :D
815301542123290624 2016-12-31 21:00:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Plot and some aftergame spoilers here, will drop a final thoughts Twitlonger later today on my thoughts on the story.
815301301055746048 2016-12-31 20:59:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thoughts on Sun/Moon (Spoiler Filled) Part 1: Characters  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1spg6ve
815291741259567104 2016-12-31 20:21:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon So I like Gladion a lot, but I think Silver is a better rival. But yes Gladion is great and you'll see how much so :D
815291600322564096 2016-12-31 20:20:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon On the other hand, Silver gets more development and you're more wanting to kick his ass more than any other rival
815291173065674752 2016-12-31 20:18:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon themes, design, and initial mystery surrounding his goals and morals.
815291148398891010 2016-12-31 20:18:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon In thinking about it I actually think Silver is a better rival, but I like Gladion more because of his personality,
815290993712971778 2016-12-31 20:18:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Silver is a great rival cuz you hate him through the whole game, but he gets a lot of development.
815286985778724864 2016-12-31 20:02:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thoughts on Sun/Moon (Spoiler Free)  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1spg6qo
815280787641733120 2016-12-31 19:37:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Y'know in hindsight, this may be better as a Twitlonger, may do that instead.
815280490378829824 2016-12-31 19:36:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I still haven't explored all aftergame content (beat UB quest, haven't touched aftergame E4 or Battle Tree), aftergame is solid
815279819701239809 2016-12-31 19:33:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fave Non-Battle Music: Gladion's Encounter theme, Guzma's encounter theme, Vast Poni Island, Mount Lanakila
815279788432703489 2016-12-31 19:33:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fave Battle Music: Gladion, Guzma, Island Kahuna, Totem Pokmon.
815279075615014913 2016-12-31 19:30:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> and Silvally. Fave Characters: Gladion, Guzma, Lillie, Nanu
815278333760012288 2016-12-31 19:27:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fave Pokmon (Alolan formes and UBs included): Vikavolt, Incineroar (rest in no specific order), Goliosopod, UB Glutton, Silvally, Drampa,
815277685408677888 2016-12-31 19:25:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished the UB quest, figured it's time to post overall thoughts on Sun/Moon, even tho I'm not done with *everything*
815261149432254468 2016-12-31 18:19:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahahahaha, I forgot I scheduled this to go up today XD
815259995872690176 2016-12-31 18:15:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> How correctly are you living your life?
815211440604856323 2016-12-31 15:02:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Had something incredibly amazing happen to me in a dream but after realizing if wasn't real, the resulting feeling was crushing. Damn.
815066973679841280 2016-12-30 05:28:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> In my defense, I never stopped to think about it. I guess because it wasn't so obvious to me but.
815066719102369793 2016-12-30 05:27:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Guys I just realized. Nebby. Nebula. ...feeling like a Slowpoke right about now.
815010760002797569 2016-12-30 01:44:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have varying luck with legendaries, mainly since I only use regular balls or equivalents (with the exception of Quick Balls)
815010639731101696 2016-12-30 01:44:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Was slightly dreading this encounter, but things went way too smoothly
815009423844372484 2016-12-30 01:39:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...I caught it on turn three, 1/3 health left, with a regular Pok Ball, first ball thrown, 3 catch rate like other legendaries. Wow!
815009090162323456 2016-12-30 01:38:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> [Light Sun/Moon spoilers] Tapu Fini can be annoying to catch, Misty Surge prevents status for 1st 5 turns, Aqua Ring heals, and Hydro Pump
814897138924736512 2016-12-30 18:13:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AlqTheTentacle That's a mouse? Like, for clicking things? Looks like a rejected Transformer.
814721879059681280 2016-12-29 06:36:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Dang, that's a lot of hours. Keep it up tho, your hard work will be worth it!
814658323450654720 2016-12-29 02:24:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was a really unexpected returning character, and her field of study makes a lot of sense to have a role, even minor, in Sun/Moon's events
814657773015285761 2016-12-29 02:22:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> On the topic of Professor Burnet tho, I still think it's cool she's even in Sun/Moon, despite being in the minor Dream Radar.
814657102589427716 2016-12-29 02:19:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tan skin, lightening bolt shaped hair, orange on their clothing. COINCIDENCE? Yes, but they're clearly siblings. Clearly.pic.twitter.com/KNBaARkAev
814643643109744643 2016-12-29 01:25:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MustacheLemon Mostly cuz I wanted someone named after my favorite character, but also leaves kinda look like his hair. Kinda. :P
814634263589097472 2016-12-29 00:48:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Alphonse was Drampa, but never got a place on my team cuz of how late you get them.
814634101282050048 2016-12-29 00:47:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon That's the story I came up with for Metagross :P
814634023989420032 2016-12-29 00:47:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Never. Since I named my team after FMA characters, I figured I'd give them a background.
814623783394902016 2016-12-29 00:06:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> btw "Fullmetal" isn't the Fullmetal Alchemist AKA Edward. "Fullmetal" is Ed's automail arm that gain sentience and psychic abilities.
814623545703747585 2016-12-29 00:06:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I kinda imagine this as an AU. Riza took up flame alchemy, Alex went to Fort Briggs, and Havoc learned to fly or something
814623152194068480 2016-12-29 00:04:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> My Moon team. Naming theme was Fullmetal Alchemist characters.pic.twitter.com/Dlsr4S9uPP
814621646271184896 2016-12-29 23:58:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gonna post my Moon team in a bit, one of my members were not revealed pre-release, so slight spoiler warning
814615568972185600 2016-12-29 23:34:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I also don't mean these are the only ones that stand out. I also like Drampa, Vikavolt, and Golisopod quite a bit, to name a few.
814614732850262017 2016-12-29 23:31:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I don't really dislike them. I guess it's somewhere around "good but not great" overall, for now at least.
814614472962834432 2016-12-29 23:29:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> But it's barely been two weeks for me and I've yet to truly experience them all. I'll need time after the fact to decide how I feel.
814614286123278340 2016-12-29 23:29:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> The ones that do are mainly the plot important 'mons. Null, Silvally,  legendaries, tapus, and UBs
814613759977209857 2016-12-29 23:27:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> And that includes regional variants. As for the rest overall, I don't dislike them, but they don't stand out incredibly imo I guess?
814612594707210240 2016-12-29 23:22:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> When I saw the leaked Incineroar pic, I really disliked it, rare for me.  Now? Incineroar is prolly one of my fave Gen VII 'mons
814496109099937792 2016-12-29 15:39:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh, they prolly thought I was younger, but 16 is like the youngest age to get a job so they just assumed the minimum
814495958046228482 2016-12-29 15:39:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm 19, little to no facial hair, everyone at my summer job thought I was 16.
814491778372014084 2016-12-29 15:22:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hilarious, Z-Splash will boost your Attack by 3 stages, they've finally give this move *some* sort of purpose, amazing.
814353842615840769 2016-12-28 06:14:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Illima: Only thieves steal Pokmon. ...yes Illima. Only people who steal will steal Pokmon.
814292653366013952 2016-12-28 02:11:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Go, Solo Run. TO VICTORY AND GLORY!!
814235794307239936 2016-12-28 22:25:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I enjoy the challenge, but these uphill battles are on a really steep hill right now haha
814235370858614784 2016-12-28 22:23:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I was underleveled when I beat the game, I didn't think things would spike this much!
814235228965339137 2016-12-28 22:23:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sun/Moon's aftergame difficulty spike is brutal. Every new fight, at the minimum, is a good 9 or 10 levels above me
814137103214854145 2016-12-28 15:53:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Speaking of manga, now that I know the plot of Sun/Moon, it's manga chapter is going to be SO GOOOOD, so excited for that now! :D
814134499953049600 2016-12-28 15:42:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Oh, the FE manga is on hold, that's too bad. WAIT THERE'S AN FE MANGA?!https://twitter.com/GoNintendoTweet/status/814134287050084352
813838296199692289 2016-12-27 20:05:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> 2016 was rough for a lot of people, myself included, but you gotta keep your head up & keep going. Don't wait for things to get better. Act.
813837482634674176 2016-12-27 20:02:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope people keep in mind that the universe isn't magically going to get better just cuz we're not calling the next set of 365 days "2016"
813777211731873793 2016-12-27 16:03:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Will do, and I'll try not to post spoily stuff often for the folks who got it for Chrimma like you. :)
813776080700080128 2016-12-27 15:58:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't think I'll discuss plot stuff until I finish the aftergame and I'll still try to be mostly spoiler free but just a heads up
813775794136879105 2016-12-27 15:57:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just a heads up, I've made it to the Pokmon League in Moon, so starting today I may discuss things about the game leading up to that point
813592652692201472 2016-12-26 03:49:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I bet he does, he seems like the kinda guy who'd be a blast to fight haha
813591590778314752 2016-12-26 03:45:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Redo them immediately after doing it first time, or going back later cuz I do go back later, boss fights are my fave.
813507651426467841 2016-12-26 22:11:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Passed by a mall today and there were a ton of people there, probably to do that, disappointing so many do that immediately.
813296326003847168 2016-12-26 08:12:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> There are many things in the world. Sleeping in jeans is definitely one of the worst ones.
813131386819407872 2016-12-25 21:16:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon villains are kinda typical, but Guzma stands out quite well
813131235799273472 2016-12-25 21:16:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I say "someone" cuz no one came to mind immediately, which means I didn't really have a particular favorite.
813131022548275200 2016-12-25 21:15:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not done with Pokmon Moon yet, but I can def say Gladion and Guzma have usurped Silver and someone as fav rival and villain leader
813106289635106818 2016-12-25 19:37:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Said time was 2:15 central, or 12:15 Pacific.
813106044922712067 2016-12-25 19:36:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Scheduled this tweet to go up at the exact minute this event happens in the games. Of course, no one was awake to see it, so here's a bump
813047906081050624 2016-12-25 15:45:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gander your sideholes at this amazingness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw3fN3OPk3A
813047052338925568 2016-12-25 15:41:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cowboy Bebop is pretty great, makes my top 5 for sure!
813045338378477569 2016-12-25 15:34:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Robin, using Final Smash: Chrom! Chrom: Waahn my mark!
813040791618813952 2016-12-25 15:16:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> What did you guys get for Chrimma? :D
813040596604616704 2016-12-25 15:15:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> AND Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ that @GirafarigTree got me a couple days ago, I've really been enjoying that, thanks again! :D
813040250381565952 2016-12-25 15:14:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also not pictured: PS4 I'm not gonna touch for 100 days (also being shipped, not from Europe, also I bought it myself, Marry Crumbs to me)
813038993562599424 2016-12-25 15:09:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> My Chrimma haul. Not pictured: bunch of Mario series figures we'll put up later, Persona 4 Dancing All Night (being shipped from Europe)pic.twitter.com/aID5to8Wo4
813037374439620609 2016-12-25 15:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Masuda. Buddy. I love ya. But y'know, you don't *have to* Like, we could just not. It'd be fine. It'd be great. Y'know? ...Masuda?pic.twitter.com/7rjBPJ7hOa
813036415315480576 2016-12-25 14:59:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy Holidays!! :D
813028205670125568 2016-12-25 14:26:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Merry Christmas my friend! :D

812899307384872960 2016-12-24 05:54:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I got a tweet scheduled tonight down to the minute of when it happens, I got it all planned out. ...kinda like he did.
812863355778113537 2016-12-24 03:31:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Well I did say "about" :P
812862588870623232 2016-12-24 03:28:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I'm quite a bit more precise than you may expect. ...sometimes.
812857626103058432 2016-12-24 03:08:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> In about 5 hours, to be precise.https://twitter.com/junior598rblx/status/812804842435514368
812683085833793537 2016-12-24 15:35:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> So instead of excitingly playing an hour of a new game, I'm instead just gonna play Moon, Pac-Man or just go 2 bed, lame Chrimma I know haha
812682703485210625 2016-12-24 15:33:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chrimma is going to be interesting for me this year cuz my present was ordered from Europe and the ETA is Dec 29-Jan 31 or something
812680995547869184 2016-12-24 15:27:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Whether you celebrate Chrimma Eve, Hanukkah, or just the holidays in general, I hope today is a great day for you all! :D
812469519637762048 2016-12-23 01:26:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Despite tweeting the "Tomorrow's Christmas Eve" video earlier today, it JUST occured to be that yes, *tomorrow* is Christmas Eve. Good 1 me.
812469166305382400 2016-12-23 01:25:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @prozdkp "I hate that this is trending, lemme go on the video to tell them that, which will give it a view and keep it trending."
812442030177656836 2016-12-23 23:37:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ is a blast to play, I've been craving some Pac-Man playing and that game really ramps it up! So much fun!
812396626941804544 2016-12-23 20:37:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA I would hang out with the Persona 3 protagonist and just chill and listen to music, show each other favorite songs and such.
812349043967983616 2016-12-23 17:27:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick If the Pokmon franchise stays strong for centuries more, releasing the event on XY's 3000th anniversary would be the funniest.
812334957280399360 2016-12-23 16:32:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Traditionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGyWuRcHaJI
812312023438659584 2016-12-23 15:00:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for what I heard before, it was "Skaaa" or something, which isn't really anything I know but incomprehensible words have been done before
812311776163459076 2016-12-23 14:59:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finally just realized the voice in Team Skull's themes is saying "Skull" ...don't look at me like that, it's not that clear!
812175513678651392 2016-12-22 05:58:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> AAAAAAAHHHHHHH THANK YOU @GirafarigTree FOR THE GIFT WHY ARE LIKE THE NICEST PERSON EVER!!!!!!
812147550329438208 2016-12-22 04:07:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon You have the most eloquent way of expressing gratitude, I wish I could be as refined as you.
812042320673697792 2016-12-22 21:09:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: Gonna buy a PS4 and the Switch, need to start saving money and not buy stuff Gaming: EVERYTHING IS ON SALE!! ;~;
812012252329078784 2016-12-22 19:09:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL you can buy godhood. Actually. Shouldn't that be illegal?
811955520131256320 2016-12-22 15:24:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I need to pick up the Bayonetta games sometime!
811955304762134529 2016-12-22 15:23:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been playing that with a friend recently, Terraria is always a good time!
811954701818359808 2016-12-22 15:21:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Beat Metroid Prime Corruption last night and have been enjoying Pokmon Moon and Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE! What have you guys been playing?
811937364121702400 2016-12-22 14:12:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have read many dumb tweets, but this has to be one of the funniest and dumbest I've seen in a while https://twitter.com/9_volt88/status/811552165927993344
811811007681142784 2016-12-21 05:50:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> ALL OF THE SHENANIGANS!!
811807048493047809 2016-12-21 05:34:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I still have the Triple Deluxe's True Arena No Copy Abilities run to do. And finish Paper Jam. Wow, I've never had a backlog like this!
811806847049105408 2016-12-21 05:33:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Though I should probably focus on the two games I already have to finish first and the game I'm getting for Chrimma before taking on another
811806382089441280 2016-12-21 05:31:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Now that I've completed another 3D Metroid, I should get around to playing through all of Super Metroid sometime
811804568501833728 2016-12-21 05:24:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finally got around to finishing Metroid Prime Corruption, good end to a great trilogy, really recommend it! Just $30 for all 3 on Wii U!
811791664176070656 2016-12-21 04:33:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Oh if that counts then yeah, I see people say "is fire" quite often
811791301981118464 2016-12-21 04:31:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie No, but we can popularize it. For example. Charizard is flames amirite.
811731681866608648 2016-12-21 00:34:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Best of luck with your future travels and endeavors, we'll always be here to support you!

811664988981067776 2016-12-21 20:09:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Wait you're Santa how can you not be prepared?! You better get it together friend, the children of the world need you.
811600545978970112 2016-12-21 15:53:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> HOW HAVE I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BEFORE?!pic.twitter.com/ZXsTGnMFh9
811407815860506625 2016-12-20 03:07:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Congrats on surviving and welcome back! :D
811305501350887424 2016-12-20 20:21:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I actually see much more non-hetero shipping than hetero shipping. Like, a lot more.
811300298576855040 2016-12-20 20:00:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA Sojiro Sakura, Sadayo Kawakami, and Tae Takemi!
811011583124131840 2016-12-19 00:53:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Oh yeah it was pretty good but it could've been gooder. But I still enjoyed it. :D
811010871409438720 2016-12-19 00:50:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
811010823065923584 2016-12-19 00:50:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> The worst part was that the syrup bottle was RIGHT NEXT TO ME
811010753130098688 2016-12-19 00:50:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> The 2nd worst part is that I got another half of a pancake and I almost had that one w/o syrup until I was asked to pass the syrup
811009319043006464 2016-12-19 00:44:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was the size of a dinner plate and had butter and blueberries and it was really good but I forgot the most important part.
811009044592951297 2016-12-19 00:43:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Guys I messed up real bad How could I be so reckless How could I make such a fatal error  I had an entire pancake and forgot there was syrup
810994784638795777 2016-12-19 23:46:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> OH NO I'VE BEEN EXPOSED!
810994291074093056 2016-12-19 23:44:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Dang, I almost wrote 1. Also, no pls and tanks, that's way too cold
810993869626163201 2016-12-19 23:43:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> 30s and low 40s, tho the 30s really only in the morning, but that's still odd for Texas. Good luck in your 2 F or whatever tho
810993032875114496 2016-12-19 23:39:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's cold in Texas for some reason so now my pupper Sally has a jacket.pic.twitter.com/6qdxDVIhBG
810990072212455424 2016-12-19 23:27:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I LOVE THIS!
810665812998705152 2016-12-18 01:59:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chrimma is next week when did how did why did
810573405871362049 2016-12-18 19:52:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> and play against many different opponents
810573341501386753 2016-12-18 19:51:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Part of the reason I never bother with competitive anything, I just wanna play the characters that are the most fun
810344847060115456 2016-12-17 04:44:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Really, a New 3DS can't even keep up? I thought it was just a non-New problem, but that's odd, you'd it'd be optimized for N3DS
810344014633377792 2016-12-17 04:40:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man, Sun/Moon really can't handle battles with more than two Pokmon on a normal 3DS, frames dropped all over
810327326823219200 2016-12-17 03:34:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's both the dumbest, yet most Mario Party way to settle first place in anything.
810327215510528000 2016-12-17 03:33:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fun Fact: In MP1-8DS, if after the bonus stars, 1st place is an even tie in both stars and coins, it's settled by... A DICE ROLL
810291788657332224 2016-12-17 01:13:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope everyone is having a good day!^^
810289779409559555 2016-12-17 01:05:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain As for how, I think you'll have to email Twitch or something, don't know the specifics beyond that though.
810289638560694272 2016-12-17 01:04:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain It's possible, but it really doesn't happen often. I think I heard partners have an easier time but you're not, so little luck
810284272322052096 2016-12-17 00:43:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> But wait trust me it's really hilarious it's coming up, it's right here well no not this joke but the next one wait hold on
810233210374328320 2016-12-17 21:20:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think you are the only person I can ask "what's your 313th Pokmon" or 313th anything and you could answer me.
810162076396253185 2016-12-17 16:37:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just had my first fight with Gladion and damn the bassist had a field day with his battle theme, so good haha
809935093762588672 2016-12-16 01:35:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT only discovered @theydidthemath recently and its already one of my favorite accounts
809869951725146112 2016-12-16 21:16:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm gonna geek out like crazy, I apologize in adv Wait.
809868862271488000 2016-12-16 21:12:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Never apologize for geeking out. Geek.
809868334942584834 2016-12-16 21:10:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I can see that point, as I've also gotten more for less, just mainly annoyed at people who think it should be free
809766371169071105 2016-12-16 14:25:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just didn't think there'd be this much. I guess some people always have something to complain about.
809765765436112896 2016-12-16 14:22:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> they use the same model.
809765706044686337 2016-12-16 14:22:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> And the game wasn't free to make. I don't even care about the game, I'm not getting it. But you may as well kiss AC and FE games bye if
809765170029457409 2016-12-16 14:20:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> The game has no ads, so all revenue comes from the players. You gotta remember that money is exchanged for goods and services.
809764755061796864 2016-12-16 14:18:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess because it's a mobile game, ppl automatically look down on it, it should be free or cheap in their eyes
809764363921948672 2016-12-16 14:17:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Geez, so many people are in an uproar about Super Mario Run's $10 price, I thought ppl would prefer a model w/o microtransactions.
809627479241527297 2016-12-15 05:13:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie plsno
809627048952168448 2016-12-15 05:11:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I imagine a Mega Poktch to be 3 sided, one part Mega Ring, one part Z-Ring, and one part awkward watch cuz there's little space
809591538758062080 2016-12-15 02:50:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> The last gulp of the last cup of eggnog is the saddest gulp of drink.
809480599022997504 2016-12-15 19:29:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> The screens where it drops the attack name are some of my favorite screenshots from this series. So good.
809472718617853952 2016-12-15 18:58:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hmm this makes me wonder if the AC and FE mobile games will have a similar setup
809471574646652928 2016-12-15 18:53:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm glad that they're not going the microtransaction route with just one purchase, but still doesn't capture my interest
809438141987901445 2016-12-15 16:41:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anime and video games and anime and video games. ...right?
809208926478761984 2016-12-14 01:30:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> This kid is asking the kind of questions that have no real use in knowing the answer to but still curious enough to ponder it, like me haha!pic.twitter.com/GbGsiRHFn4
809202831479701504 2016-12-14 01:06:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Crunchyroll Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you like adventure series like Avatar The Last Airbender. Death Note is a great starter too
809185267697512449 2016-12-14 23:56:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator I'll look into that, thanks! :D
809184851492532224 2016-12-14 23:54:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator I can't really comment much on Stadium, haven't seen too much of it but PBR has good music and some of the series' toughest fights
809183942637219840 2016-12-14 23:51:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> My 3DS might be starting to show its age, played like 3 hours of Moon before battery got low, either that or Moon is higher maintenance
809183481351835648 2016-12-14 23:49:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> This game was a lot better than people gave it credit for and the narrator from the anime is the announcer it does it get better than that?https://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/809178863024668672
809169847246536705 2016-12-14 22:54:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow. This.https://twitter.com/KaiserNeko/status/809169215412436997
809111740436934658 2016-12-14 19:04:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not even exaggerating, it happens almost every single time it's dumb
809111588586291200 2016-12-14 19:03:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Either that or the bus gods love to troll me cuz I take the bus 10 times a week, I feel like it's averaged around 8 or 9 times missed per
809111183936684032 2016-12-14 19:01:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I feel like watching the bus drive past as I'm mere seconds away from the bus stop so I miss the bus is an accurate summation of my life

809053199621586946 2016-12-14 15:11:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last final today which means I GET TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES AGAIN AND I CAN FINALLY BE EXCITED TO DO SOMETHING AGAIANDFADFAS
808899275254091776 2016-12-13 04:59:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> It always sounded like "mon new meanie men!" to me or something (best way I could spell that phonetically) and I always thought it was weird
808898882591748096 2016-12-13 04:58:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL Tom says "Don't you believe it!" in this clip, for so many years I could never understand what he was saying!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9U_C_q6WcU
808864415625965568 2016-12-13 02:41:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Studying is like boring level grinding. But REALLY boring.
808789888980185089 2016-12-13 21:45:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting that she got a theme at all, encounter themes are usually reserved for rivals and villainous team leaders.
808788399830269952 2016-12-13 21:39:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> In case you forgot or didn't know, Clair has her own theme, but it only plays once and it's really goodhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qigL-1vhGdw

808163270221774850 2016-12-11 04:15:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I... Um... Same? Actually no. Not same But you do you buddy.
808163164084994048 2016-12-11 04:14:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey, Sokka can date whoever he wants, let a man like the moon, okay?
808161446160900096 2016-12-11 04:07:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Japanese word "tsuki" means "moon" So yes. Both of Sokka's girlfriends were the moon.
808143648152055809 2016-12-11 02:57:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> LISTEN TO THIS IT'S SO GOOD IT'S BASICALLY THE BEST SONG EVER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLgc5cf6CB8

807840973858471936 2016-12-10 06:54:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Destroys everything in his path, leaving nothing left behind. Butterfree will crush all & become the strongest

807823807910150144 2016-12-10 05:46:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like to imagine this as not a trainer's journey, but Butterfree's. Since a wee Caterpie, they have dream of becoming Champion.
807821171085508608 2016-12-10 05:35:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh. While I question why you'd grind that much, I shall cease testing. Good luck, as they say.
807820797284937732 2016-12-10 05:34:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> How're you supposed to beat Brock. GG, was good knowing that Butterfree, I'm sure they were very kind hearted
807819774998802433 2016-12-10 05:30:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> You're watching a speedrun aren't you? Learn, your teacher is right there renaePetch
807819241823027200 2016-12-10 05:28:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> How about Majora's Mask. Race him. You can do it. Probably not but prove me wrong.
807818670445621249 2016-12-10 05:25:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sephazon Sounds like a great idea to me, I'd enjoy it!
807803541192634368 2016-12-10 04:25:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> That channel has quite a few John Oliver compilations, he's pretty great.
807801361580564481 2016-12-10 04:17:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know you like John Oliver, how about him making fun of stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BcbmuoazrI
807800315860942848 2016-12-10 04:12:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've really only seen them advertised as Barbie taking on what would be considered stereotypical feminine jobs, glad they're doing otherwise
807799914029780992 2016-12-10 04:11:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Went to a TRU yesterday (that place is dangerous, don't take your wallet there) and saw a Game Developer Barbie doll, genuinely impressed

807766738414800896 2016-12-10 01:59:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @chuggaaconroy If it makes you feel better. I just realized that too. So there. I r also smart.

807414951094718469 2016-12-09 02:41:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu The correct way to run fast.
807410745738665988 2016-12-09 02:24:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> But in general over the years I've pretty much always mimicked specific motions game characters do. So it's not just me :O
807410533448249344 2016-12-09 02:24:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just don't try triple jumping indoors. Might not work out well.
807409315451719684 2016-12-09 02:19:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not quite N64, but after I played Kid Icarus: Uprising I found myself skipping like Pit does in the game
807407352278294528 2016-12-09 02:11:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how they'd fare if they all battled each other. Huh. All this thinking from the Winstrate family of all NPCs haha
807406973964652544 2016-12-09 02:09:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Canonically, we *never* lose (except Red, but he's the only one we fight), so why aren't all our characters more famous?
807406358454829056 2016-12-09 02:07:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's even referenced by multiple rivals, who are repeatedly frustrated that no matter what they do, they can never beat us.
807406198672736257 2016-12-09 02:06:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how many dreams we, as the ultra ace Pokmon trainer we are, we've crushed utterly into the ground, as we effortlessly defeat all
807406009140580352 2016-12-09 02:06:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> After you beat him, you break his confidence severely and he loses the will to take on the Pokmon League, even after going all that way.
807405977498746883 2016-12-09 02:06:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Much later in Victory Road, you meet this final member: Vito, who's never lost a battle ever.
807405917293711361 2016-12-09 02:05:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> In Hoenn there's a family of trainers, the Winstrate family, they all have names that start with "V" and mention another stronger member.
807381320921923584 2016-12-09 00:28:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> yes good excellent
807322815397580800 2016-12-09 20:35:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Best part of the newest Generations episode was definitely that remix of Lysandre's battle theme, right?
807299309314121729 2016-12-09 19:02:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Play Melee but as Pichu on whatever stage has a big tree
807224511833772032 2016-12-09 14:04:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought I lived in Texas why is it 37 F/2.7 C?!?!
807082453437476864 2016-12-08 04:40:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I'll send some Cleffa to help you out. Maybe they can talk it out.
807033516403859456 2016-12-08 01:25:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd That's actually a really good idea. I better keep that one in mind
807033424338882560 2016-12-08 01:25:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> But it's also really daunting, cuz I'll raise my expectations too high and I'll get frustrated if I don't reach this level as fast as I want
807033101159460864 2016-12-08 01:24:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Remixes like this inspire me, I hope I can remix something and output a result as amazing as this someday.

807005270937374720 2016-12-08 23:33:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @yugiohtas "WONDERFUL!"
806970535313817602 2016-12-08 21:15:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you're not watching Keijo, you're missing on the best attack names like "GATE OF BOOTYLON!!!"https://twitter.com/MetroidPrimeRib/status/806940923082862592
806959720619737093 2016-12-08 20:32:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> SAVED IT! Just like you for the rest of your legendary encounters. Saving your game. Nice job!
806959223666077696 2016-12-08 20:30:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh Decker. Oh no Decker.
806958898360020992 2016-12-08 20:29:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh, rip all your dreams then. I will say tho using only regular Pok Balls requires lots of resets, so I wasn't perfect :P
806958525339619329 2016-12-08 20:27:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is why you buy 200. 10 at a time of course so you get 20 Premier Balls too.
806958171361263617 2016-12-08 20:26:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ever since W2, I always try to get legends in regular Pok Balls or equivalents. And I have. So, uh, git gud skrub. ;D
806915032734978048 2016-12-08 17:35:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Yeah, but I was waiting for the close up on N's eye. Cuz...N's eye I guess I dunno.

806875876554145792 2016-12-08 14:59:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I hope you're all having sweet dreams Cuz for some reason I'm not. Oh well.

806875373539590144 2016-12-08 14:57:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've oddly been having some dark dreams lately. Just now I dreamt that just for talking, a little girl got sentenced to be sacrificed
806726133085401090 2016-12-07 05:04:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> And can P-Switches be mass produced? You could just go to a brick factory, press the switch, make money money, repeat to the next factory.
806725857876115457 2016-12-07 05:03:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> And in SMB3 they can make doors appear, is that separate technology or the same?

806709543304654849 2016-12-07 03:58:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Who knows how many people I'm a clone of
806709043909816321 2016-12-07 03:56:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> How does that... I don't think that's how... Well I've never cloned anyone so what do I know.
806708819594215424 2016-12-07 03:55:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I didn't want this to be the time, but I think you're ready.  You might be a clone of me. Maybe.
806708511669448704 2016-12-07 03:54:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I finished watching OPM today, so for me it's from the OP "The Hero" Just them yelling "HEEEEROOOOO!!!!" while the guitar rocks on in the bg
806708150464368640 2016-12-07 03:53:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do you ever have a song stuck in your head, but not the whole thing but just one specific part or line?
806659852135186435 2016-12-07 00:41:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Draw on your essay. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, throw that word count requirement out of the park.
806633010275696641 2016-12-07 22:54:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm sure the four boobed, headless horsewoman is special in her own ways. But heads are cool, as are faces.

806297245519904770 2016-12-06 00:40:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic If you can find Kirby Super Star Ultra for DS, that's a great choice! Triple Deluxe is pretty solid as well!

805634421768486913 2016-12-04 04:46:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Still baffled you somehow got younger in the past 10 years.
805633705943453700 2016-12-04 04:43:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think humanity has reached a cool enough level to have eggnog ice cream. So where do I get some?
805512069055442945 2016-12-04 20:40:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how they noted "Sun/Moon", but the hashtag was for GO instead XDhttps://twitter.com/cartoonnetwork/status/805502094631374848
805241259111620608 2016-12-03 02:44:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> A small part of me wants to use a Mandibuzz just cuz people are growing to hate her and also yeah I'm kinda an ass hahaha

805179566587265024 2016-12-03 22:39:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Super Paper Mario is a good game and here's one of its best themes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xKu43Kru0&t=467s
805164515822333952 2016-12-03 21:39:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @coughdrops Left, but the tie is so long it extends down to where the one on the right ends.
805159291741208576 2016-12-03 21:18:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm ready and I'm hyped! :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fbO2-egZ3U

804907363501219840 2016-12-02 04:37:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Started watching Keijo and it's hilarious because it's absolutely ridiculous but it takes itself incredibly seriously.
804900370816335872 2016-12-02 04:09:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Is it just me or does Crunchyroll's player have significantly more issues for non-members vs. premium members.
804862845095645184 2016-12-02 01:40:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> SMOL ANIME
804860683921870848 2016-12-02 01:31:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> There's only one answer to this.
804797084700438529 2016-12-02 21:19:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @cool_as_heck Never stop.
804747053926649856 2016-12-02 18:00:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> He still defaults to his left arm tho, could be left handedness or that his right isn't as reliable.
804744624749375488 2016-12-02 17:50:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> I theorized that Ghetsis might not even have both his arms but, at least for Generations, that's not the case.
804744518566285312 2016-12-02 17:50:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Besides the intro to BW, Ghetsis' right arm is always concealed, but he clearly showed both arms in the latest Generations episode.
804560528454647808 2016-12-01 05:39:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator It gets cringier tho.
804550138039566336 2016-12-01 04:57:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin They should evolve at level 16 into Kadabra, and learn Confusion upon doing so
804549880622489600 2016-12-01 04:56:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Abra never learns anything that's not Teleport, besides TMs
804543458153263104 2016-12-01 04:31:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> And yes, all three of those can run Doom. It's pretty great.
804543117907165185 2016-12-01 04:30:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> If, for some reason, you've ever wondered if an Apple Watch, an ATM, iPod and more can run OG Doom Look no further:http://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/

804535233035071488 2016-12-01 03:58:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Same but it's really cringey and hilarious because of it, imo
804530598777864192 2016-12-01 03:40:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think it's safe to either just default for the Switch version or wait to see actual Switch gameplay for now.
804530392925687809 2016-12-01 03:39:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon tbh I *kinda* expect BotW to be pushed (heard a rumor too but rumors y'know), but yeah, good to be safe.
804527780855746561 2016-12-01 03:29:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bill noticeably said BotW would release in "2017", but not "March 2017". May be speaking too soon/reading too much, but possible delay?

804439292080754688 2016-12-01 21:37:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sorry I've been complaining about school so much lately, but I've been trying not to keep in all my frustrations & school is the source
804419275977084928 2016-12-01 20:17:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I never studied before but I'm like "hmm lemme try it" Leaving for my final now and the past 5 hours didn't really do much good.
804418738745384962 2016-12-01 20:15:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Have you ever (tried to) study for a test and you somehow feel like you're *less* prepared than you started? Welp.
804397365943762944 2016-12-01 18:50:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Then I've done my job successfully, thank you!

804388585361305600 2016-12-01 18:15:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Tailsy Semi-on topic but cool merch idea: Delibird plush with collectibles in the bag tail, don't know what until opened.
804388225263534080 2016-12-01 18:14:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> How do you study?
804387705459212288 2016-12-01 18:12:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator I usually keep things bottled up, which I've learned is not a good idea, so it's overall better to speak, just have to be careful
804385964537839616 2016-12-01 18:05:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Yes, but that's too much power for one Goomba to wield so it probably explodes.
804385701055840256 2016-12-01 18:04:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Can this be canon?
804384584913842176 2016-12-01 18:00:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder what the in-universe explanation of gaining extra lives from killing enemies in succession via stomping or Koopa shell is.
804384220009398273 2016-12-01 17:58:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator No one is normal and everyone thinks many things they don't/probably shouldn't say out loud, so you good don't worry.

804194811062480896 2016-11-30 05:25:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I actually kinda felt a little bad about this one. Just a little.
804194422917316609 2016-11-30 05:24:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> The tears of Cubone harden into the ultimate defense. Well, not ultimate or their moms wouldn't die but still pretty good.
804193935107178496 2016-11-30 05:22:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sun/Moon's are customizable too, but they're much more detailed with their default artwork this time around.
804193796724559872 2016-11-30 05:21:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've also noticed they've really stepped up the protag designs BW onwards, tho default Calem/Serena are bland imo tho you can customize them
804193557640871936 2016-11-30 05:20:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> K all I have to say about these two are that female have giant shirt holes and cool shoes and male has the largest pockets. That's all I gotpic.twitter.com/sGjvMTnCH5
804192321785004033 2016-11-30 05:16:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> If life was an attack, Cubone's would be a supereffective critical hit, that's nothing really.

804189151599984640 2016-11-30 05:03:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait Hilbert and Hilda left in between BW and B2W2 to look for N, but N comes back. So...where are they? Did they not get the memo?

804185340445650944 2016-11-30 04:48:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@DeckerStag I always realized Rosa had those weird tights but it didn't don on me Nate's pants were a wetsuit then I'm like "wait BOTH!!"
804184285829795840 2016-11-30 04:44:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> I am the only one who didn't realize until now Nate and Rosa are casually wearing wetsuits?pic.twitter.com/i17NF6f4tU
804182940632682497 2016-11-30 04:38:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Protect that Cubone and be wary of Mandibuzz.
804179387364970496 2016-11-30 04:24:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin 2, maybe 3 hours
804117318775226370 2016-11-30 00:18:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I'm kidding, btw.
804117088747012102 2016-11-30 00:17:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Buy me the game? ;D
804115670057316353 2016-11-30 00:11:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon The time has come. For what I dunno, prolly play Huniepop or something, if I even had it.
804092252888956928 2016-11-30 22:38:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Best.https://twitter.com/cool_as_heck/status/804087776199086080
804066576462970881 2016-11-30 20:56:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> While Megami Tensei has never been a worldwide phenomenon like Pokmon or Zelda or Sonic, it's still quite popular in its own right.
804066282530340865 2016-11-30 20:55:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Really puts things in perspective. Pokmon is so big they can outsell a franchise with a 9 yr headstart in just 2 weeks.
804066151701630983 2016-11-30 20:54:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRTs Sun/Moon sold 7.2 mil in 2 weeks. That's two games. The Megami Tensei *franchise* has sold the same amount in 29 *years* Wow.
804037359314538496 2016-11-30 19:00:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> But hey just 4 more tests, 2 more class days, and 2 weeks and I'm free for 30 days, only to go back for another 5 months. Yay.
804036874360782854 2016-11-30 18:58:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Definitely failed that Calc III test but look at the bright side I did well on the others so it's not as bad to my grade... Oh wait. If only
803996327445139456 2016-11-30 16:17:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Doggos gotta get swol too they got families to protect.
803995652116140032 2016-11-30 16:14:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I've done like nothing to prepare cuz I thought I had more time, focusing on my other test tomorrow. I FREAKING LOVE SCHOOL :DDDDDDDDDDD
803995460495175680 2016-11-30 16:13:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was led to believe my Calc III test was on Friday, but I actually just learned it's today.
803825591531294720 2016-11-29 04:58:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cuz people and stuff have places to be at goddamn midnight. What's it to ya?
803824223940673536 2016-11-29 04:53:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is why I hate group projects :/ Either way, best of luck, hope doing everything yourself gets you an A
803823556731817985 2016-11-29 04:50:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> In this day and age it's almost impossible to make it to college without Google savviness, so I doubt 1 can
803820332427673600 2016-11-29 04:37:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like, I legit *cannot* comprehend how someone can conclude "oh I'll just feign extreme incompetence" and think it'll pass
803820131726069761 2016-11-29 04:37:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm lazy and I hate it but I'm not this lazy come onnn. Do ppl really get this far and think they can do this?
803819298624073732 2016-11-29 04:33:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> How do you meet so many people who think being vague like this works? Do they think people are just stupid???
803740363236265984 2016-11-29 23:20:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Damn. I really admire you for taking that so well, even tho 20 years is a long way off, that's still scary. But you just "nah"
803697185338654724 2016-11-29 20:28:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda annoying how I have 3 exams spaced out over 14 days, it's not like I study and I just want to get the semester over with.
803673901905678337 2016-11-29 18:56:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> The answer is yes cuz I finished it with over an hour and a half to spare. How good am I? Too good.
803666959015538688 2016-11-29 18:28:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> But... Then it... ...okay.
803663037978660864 2016-11-29 18:12:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @CheeseyPokemon I like how you just know this offhand. "Minute Maid Fruit Punch, not a bad choice in my experience"
803652424233877504 2016-11-29 17:30:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @iamabucket13 True, but that's also an optional fight, not required.
803644972608135168 2016-11-29 17:01:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin The games are *mostly* independent anyway, it's not even a big deal, you'll only miss a reference or two, not plot important
803644254673371136 2016-11-29 16:58:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> How do people expect to get people to sign up for something without knowing what they're doing are ppl that dense???
803636630926098433 2016-11-29 16:27:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me two weeks ago: Oh man, I have two weeks to do this hw Me today: Oh man I have 4 hours to do this hw Guys am I doing this right?
803624502181720068 2016-11-29 15:39:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy birthday to @Azurillkirby and @callieviolet29 hope you both have an awesome day!! :D
803468772828999680 2016-11-28 05:20:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> This applies to drinks too. This may still only be me tho. Just maybe. Anyone?
803468023038406656 2016-11-28 05:17:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I already ate some but you get the idea Key lime. Yum stuff.pic.twitter.com/Sc3yiK0iry
803467623107268608 2016-11-28 05:16:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is too funny, cuz I didn't even say "reconcile" XD
803466796472922112 2016-11-28 05:13:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> and it's like "man this is great but boy is it a lot" Or is that just me? Maybe that's just me.
803466726444793856 2016-11-28 05:12:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> else but if you reduce your piece to accommodate, yours will be too small so you just take the rest and now you have a giant piece of good
803466627111120896 2016-11-28 05:12:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> You ever go to cut yourself a piece a cake or pie and you measure you the size you want but the amount remaining is too small for someone
803465111377678336 2016-11-28 05:06:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have never loved the Pokdex in any other game more than in Sun/Moon, I actually look forward to reading them all now!
803434531923591168 2016-11-28 03:04:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Um. I may have a problem.pic.twitter.com/4tfG1mPcji
803389736513667072 2016-11-28 00:06:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @GirafarigTree Does it say in the credits who wrote these I need to know.
803389570993811457 2016-11-28 00:06:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @GirafarigTree I was curious, so I checked on Bulbapedia for Mandibuzz's dex andpic.twitter.com/T0KCiUrAQ9
803383625546944513 2016-11-28 23:42:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Challenges like these are always in the back of your mind then, huh? Haha
803383533133856768 2016-11-28 23:42:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> For some reason it's amusing to me that this is the first thing you think of when you see a early game Caterpie.
803378946666614786 2016-11-28 23:24:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I bet you'll ace those finals so utterly the finals will be the ones crying when you're done with them. YOU! GOT! THIS!!
803376392029216768 2016-11-28 23:13:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @chuggaaconroy Wha? Is there an explanation for this or??
803353908135559169 2016-11-28 21:44:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @discordapp I agree
803350933295992833 2016-11-28 21:32:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Maybe they just wanted a change of pace.
803001601153761280 2016-11-27 22:24:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> When does a meme go too far? I dunno, here's this anyway: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eagjpMz2hHU
802706056128372736 2016-11-26 02:50:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Warm dutch apple pie + cold ice cream = excellent dinssert :D And yes. Dinssert. This is my dinner and dessert.
802660478778372097 2016-11-26 23:49:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's a dumb tease. You can even make them expensive, but at least make them available.
802587692101959681 2016-11-26 18:59:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Takahata101 It was pretty awesome, I really loved it! I've already seen it twice! :D
802584904559108096 2016-11-26 18:48:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Since always, apparently.pic.twitter.com/D707m0oeIA
802565580553420804 2016-11-26 17:32:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Takahata101 HOW COULD THIS BE?!
802552756338827264 2016-11-26 16:41:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Okay if you listen to one theme from this OST let it be one of if not the best one: Avalanche Alley, it's soooo goodhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUeoKzsRlEQ&index=11&list=PL19C6E41BF1B3106A
802549540100468736 2016-11-26 16:28:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> That prolly makes no sense but I'm sure you know what I mean. I just really love that game okay. Just getting really nostalgic I guess haha
802549509771247616 2016-11-26 16:28:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu Same. Best.
802549093037907969 2016-11-26 16:26:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does anyone else have that game or thing that you just love so much that experience that thing you just realize "man, I *really* love this"
802548837667717120 2016-11-26 16:25:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've found myself listening to Pac-Man World 2's OST again, and it's so damn goodhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfNI59iG_6E&index=1&list=PL19C6E41BF1B3106A
802333658048700417 2016-11-25 02:10:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Challenge idea: Munchlax protag, only use Metronome against bosses That shouldn't be too hard...if you're lucky that is ;D
802326980028928000 2016-11-25 01:43:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> To the point where I'll put off eating or watching cuz I'm looking to watch something or waiting to eat something. Cuz I'm a weirdo I guess.
802326184315023360 2016-11-25 01:40:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I have a weird thing I like to call the "popcorn effect", where whenever I eat something, I have to watch something entertaining alongside.
802324728660639744 2016-11-25 01:34:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> See now that one makes sense too, Cubone learn to warm themselves since no mom is around to do so.
802324512565907456 2016-11-25 01:34:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cubone utilizes the lack of their mother's warmth into their own power, I can dig it.
802303007912300545 2016-11-25 00:08:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Riza Hawkeye Saves the World and is just overall the Greatest Human Being Part 78" Underestimating on the 78.
802247343554764800 2016-11-25 20:27:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> You would get excited for her blinking.
801945887975108608 2016-11-24 00:29:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just realized Varrick having a battleship named "Zhu Li" was unintentional foreshadowing.
801808201666719744 2016-11-24 15:22:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Merry Gratitude-mas.
801533443070947328 2016-11-23 21:10:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AtlusUSA Xander Mobus as Protagonist, Cassandra Lee Morris as Morgana, and Cherami Leigh as Makoto Niijima
801476454601134080 2016-11-23 17:24:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> They make anime with, ahem, "plot", out of anything these days.
801475622920982532 2016-11-23 17:20:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought this was about ice skating.
801466405686284288 2016-11-23 16:44:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> You know this would've been a great preorder bonus -_-
801453252185391104 2016-11-23 15:52:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Okay, that's fair :P Just me tho, I'd rather deal with super low catch rates than breed, I enjoy the challenge haha
801451661462011908 2016-11-23 15:45:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just know the Beldum have the longest legitimate required hatch time, that's 5120 steps per egg *with* Flame Body. Have fun!
801310409361920000 2016-11-22 06:24:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess I can just order another no problem since I'm only charged when it ships, but still really bizarre.
801309346290405376 2016-11-22 06:20:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd was gone before that was announced, so maybe I'm delusional and never ordered it??
801309317148315648 2016-11-22 06:20:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I've tripled checked and it isn't there. I thought it might have to do with the release date being pushed but I noticed it
801308721607573506 2016-11-22 06:17:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd guess they could just show up when Amazon actually has them prepped for shipping in March but I'm more thinking the order is gone???
801307121753137154 2016-11-22 06:11:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because I could've sworn that back in June I pre-ordered P5 the first chance I could but I recently realized it wasn't there.
801306263246270465 2016-11-22 06:07:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Has anyone ever pre-ordered something months in advance on Amazon? It should show up on queued up orders, right?

801268428002783236 2016-11-22 03:37:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator I thought I knew for a bit there, like "oh it's because" but then I realized. No. No I don't understand.
801268275862585344 2016-11-22 03:36:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator "According to all known laws of aviation..." tbh I have no idea, I just roll with it.

800791388333817857 2016-11-21 20:01:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> If we ever get another 3D console Pokmon RPG, I really want the anime's narrator to be the announcer again, prolly fave part about PBR tbh
800543394070003712 2016-11-20 03:36:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Then have characters comment on how unsuspenseful/easy it was, think there's drama and turn it into a surprising comedic moment.
800543043292119045 2016-11-20 03:35:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> What I really wished they'd do tho is that the countdown stops with plenty of time to spare, like 30 seconds or 2 minutes
800542777369042944 2016-11-20 03:34:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm bothered the clich that when there's a countdown, it *always* is stopped at the last possible second, it really lacks any suspense now.
800539768492847104 2016-11-20 03:22:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> 'dex says swirl put 'mons to sleep. They say in your sleep is the best way to go but somehow it's really dark.
800529319537700864 2016-11-20 02:40:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Or, like you said, you just might be overthinking things :P
800529232275402752 2016-11-20 02:40:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ghetsis says it in a similar way, but clearly wants you to battle with your 'mons, so there's a clear difference.pic.twitter.com/xlQRlTEe3J
800527741514870785 2016-11-20 02:34:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> In which case, no plot hole, I'm sure technology can differentiate a empty ball and one with a 'mon in it
800527605757779968 2016-11-20 02:33:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> If they're wild Pokmon in the area, then the intention is prolly to prevent capture, so it's like B2W2's Ghetsis scenario.
800527285438836736 2016-11-20 02:32:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> through the trouble of disabling it.
800527251058098176 2016-11-20 02:32:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbf tho, the dev team prolly doesn't expect you to go off in side features during whatever happens there, no use going
800523140510031873 2016-11-20 02:16:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cuz that's just to prevent capture
800523005801598976 2016-11-20 02:15:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's like when Ghetsis disables your Pok Balls against Black/White Kyurem and you can still battle, tho that's different.
800513498673389568 2016-11-20 01:37:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait, how does Poliwhirl eat? Actually I'll just imagine them absorbing corpses into their body via the stomach swirl. Yes.
800511122419961856 2016-11-20 01:28:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait. There are *others*? oh.
800470652104757249 2016-11-20 22:47:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow, that's the last thing I'd thought would get a buff.
800441676963647488 2016-11-20 20:52:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ha! Like being committed would stop people!
800438931791679488 2016-11-20 20:41:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Our boy
800384601621467136 2016-11-20 17:05:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> And yeah yeah I know, that's a law that's obviously obeyed in all video games, but this particular thing "bothers" me I guess :P
800384325820837890 2016-11-20 17:04:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> In Splatoon you shoot ink until your tank is empty, then you refill it by swimming in your own ink. But...the Law of Conservation of Mass.
800355799797088257 2016-11-20 15:11:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> But enough about my problems, listen to the amazing Eggman centric remix by my favorite remixer instead:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ1SnWlpWv4
800354536468709377 2016-11-20 15:06:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> You need skills and interests to do that. But of course I have no skills and my few interests can't reliably be a job.
800353850200834048 2016-11-20 15:03:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> All my life my goal was to get a job that I actually enjoy everyday. Yesterday reality told me that's not gonna happen.
800181759442821120 2016-11-19 03:39:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah, I'll have to find out what that's about then.
800178447213625344 2016-11-19 03:26:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope they didn't bump up the shiny odds a bunch cuz it looks like a ton of people are getting some without even trying
800168649306886144 2016-11-19 02:47:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you're willing to risk your 3DS and game to catch, they shall accept you. Or you break your 3DS. Maybe.
800167943174758400 2016-11-19 02:44:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah Beldum's family is oddly the toughest non-legendary to catch, so yeah good lucks
800166735450148864 2016-11-19 02:39:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> she's Johto's Champion who fights Link in the newest Dark Souls. And you can't tell me that AU doesn't exist, you don't know.
800166712587014144 2016-11-19 02:39:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Or everything we thought was impossible or unlikely is very real in another AU. There's an AU where Bayonetta debuted in Animal Crossing and
800165904239722497 2016-11-19 02:36:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sometimes I think of multiverse theory to its extreme. Anything you consider doing, alternate choices or actions, an AU of it exists.
800141878121340929 2016-11-19 01:01:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Same
800122187332145154 2016-11-19 23:42:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Oh boy, is it time for more Drunk Tweets with Cheesey? :O
799771424592449536 2016-11-18 00:29:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ArcticNightz To prevent spoils, I'll just say a major Grass type in the second game, you can beat them but you don't need to.
799770286316982272 2016-11-18 00:24:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TomFawkes Not a main series game, the closest I can recall is one of the Mystery Dungeon games, there's a fight you're not required to win.
799744886505279488 2016-11-18 22:43:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I think that's the best hat ever? Yeah I think so.
799724923446915073 2016-11-18 21:24:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I see no issue here, nice and sunny out :D
799711678057316357 2016-11-18 20:31:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> But whatever I'll stop complaining, I hope you all have lots of fun with the game!
799711477967921152 2016-11-18 20:30:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought it wouldn't be too bad but it's starting to hit me hard now and it just adds to the pile of things I frustrated and upset about
799708515824791552 2016-11-18 20:19:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> One month isn't that long, right?pic.twitter.com/nQs4JxdPEB
799669580599873536 2016-11-18 17:44:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Buy Sun and just find a mouse, leave some cheese out I hear they like the smell
799658366289068033 2016-11-18 16:59:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Hang in there friend!
799658120960241664 2016-11-18 16:58:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wasn't too bummed about P5's delay until I realized 2 months ago we were 5 months from release and now we're 5 months away from release.
799657835248439297 2016-11-18 16:57:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Real talk tho that'd be pretty awesome. Just have like only 5 shiny boxes, like the golden tickets of Pokmon.
799657218597601280 2016-11-18 16:55:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed No, that's normal.  Geez you really think you'd get special box art of Shiny Lunala smh
799637692678045696 2016-11-18 15:37:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator Except France, they might apparently have it??
799631074242547712 2016-11-18 15:11:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm totally prepared for Sun/Moon to take that spot from HGSS for me, and that really excites me!
799630261747126273 2016-11-18 15:08:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was worried about that too, really happy to hear this! :D
799486525499121664 2016-11-17 05:36:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> If for some reason you need a nickname idea for your Popplio, may I recommend "Magnitude"
799482405740572672 2016-11-17 05:20:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects Thanks for the warning!
799327036485566464 2016-11-17 19:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles But Joe, the sweet sweet pre-embargo cash money views.
799281548646174721 2016-11-17 16:02:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy See you soon and take care!
799092847672786945 2016-11-16 03:32:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Same tho haha
799037578678833152 2016-11-16 23:52:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh I was wrong, honorifics will be in the game, sweet! :D
799004290731954179 2016-11-16 21:40:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree P E R S O N A
799002024448692224 2016-11-16 21:31:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> That definitely explains the delay, this game is gigantic, wow!https://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/799001749851951108
798988032737210368 2016-11-16 20:36:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Aw, Persona 5 isn't going to have honorifics. It may seem out of place, but it was a little thing I really liked about the other games.
798986683681099776 2016-11-16 20:30:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess this just shows how huge this game is, that they need 2 more months to localize and make sure everything is perfect!
798981171426144257 2016-11-16 20:08:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> ohhttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/798980754898350080
798905812907360256 2016-11-16 15:09:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Whoa this is cool!! :Ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyxHSGPIxy8&t=0s
798889716456169472 2016-11-16 14:05:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yes Yes Yes!https://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/798874238614585345
798888749262368769 2016-11-16 14:01:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yes.
798726249594163200 2016-11-15 03:15:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow, GF actually dropped a vid with CoroCoro's news. ...GF. I was kidding.
798645223144321025 2016-11-15 21:53:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Dang u buff
798644687200342016 2016-11-15 21:51:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never seen Shadow so happy what twisted dark timeline is this
798644413710921730 2016-11-15 21:50:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Probably like a week or two after launch
798618632016130048 2016-11-15 20:08:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wish people said their own name in conversation more often, if only so that I don't go through the awkwardness of telling them I forgot.
798522407673856000 2016-11-15 13:45:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I never really care much about review scores but an almost perfect is nothing to sneeze at.https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/798519772845588481
798252374406139905 2016-11-14 19:52:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @cheese33tree If it means anything my grades are either the same or worse, hopefully I can pull them up tho.
798252157732589568 2016-11-14 19:51:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @cheese33tree Long story short I've been barred from playing games all semester in the hopes that it'll improve my grades
798251267889823744 2016-11-14 19:48:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator That's more than enough, thanks! :)
798245159250997249 2016-11-14 19:24:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll just have to find something to distract myself I guess. Like anime. Or practice dresser building speedruns again. That sounds fun. Yup.
798243980546895872 2016-11-14 19:19:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> I appreciate you doing that, I wish I could ask everyone to do that but that's selfish so I'll have to deal :P
798243518019997696 2016-11-14 19:17:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope you guys enjoy it, but I just hate that I can't join you all until after most will have beaten it already
798242327533744128 2016-11-14 19:12:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> The closer Sun/Moon launch gets, the more I remember that I won't be allowed to play it for a month and I'll be left behind everyone else.
798184832253751298 2016-11-14 15:24:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon That's how I've felt about every news drop since October "cool, but I would've much preferred to learn that in game >.>"

798181440039088128 2016-11-14 15:10:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> In BOTH games. Lycanroc is a version exclusive evolution, but you can get either or if you search day or night
798181330903240705 2016-11-14 15:10:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> IMPORTANT NOTE for the people who have somehow not chosen their version yet: The official site says both Lycanroc forms can be found in wild
798167811369603072 2016-11-14 14:16:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> They really needed to get one more in, didn't they?
798035273305223168 2016-11-13 05:30:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Experiencing 'mons I've never used before is really what I enjoyed, I don't force myself to go all newest 'mons, just new to me.
798034976470142976 2016-11-13 05:28:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I haven't decided, but I think that's fine. Only half my Y team were Kalos 'mons, but I still used 'mons I never used before.

797848447693058049 2016-11-13 17:07:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> sexing one another without regard for protection, leading to many babies and the potential overpopulation of the planet. Rest of solar

797848366650654721 2016-11-13 17:07:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Harem series idea: characters are personifications of celestial bodies (think Hetalia: Axis Powers but space); planets are main cast.

797548305244979200 2016-11-12 21:15:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> It all comes back to how the game getting out early has been a giant mess.
797546444119035904 2016-11-12 21:07:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Unfortunately some people don't care, just want the early views/want to be the first ones or whatever
797545373397032960 2016-11-12 21:03:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> The champ's name might be apart of the theme's name on the soundtrack, but they really shouldn't upload early in 1st place
797279134787497984 2016-11-11 03:25:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I guess "stopped being a villain" = "redemption and comeuppance" :P
797278083590082560 2016-11-11 03:21:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Or expanding on what you said, he doesn't seem him as a threat to the world anymore, so he doesn't bother
797277988865929216 2016-11-11 03:20:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd True, but he also evaded the law, never went to jail (that we know of) for his crimes, you'd think he'd want to fix that
797272165771079680 2016-11-11 02:57:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> SO HOW HAS RED NOT REALIZED "oh hey, it's Team Rocket's boss, I should do something about that"??
797272049848897536 2016-11-11 02:57:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I JUST REALIZED Both Red and Giovanni enter the PWT, albeit not at the same time, but I'm sure at least Red watches the matches

797204023359246336 2016-11-11 22:27:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> omg I forgot that Sun/Moon's logo and  were leaked the day before revealed, these games were destined to leak more than a broken pipe
797202883259273216 2016-11-11 22:22:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Out of 58 gym leaders, 22 E4 members, and 8 champions (88), 24, 10, and 3 respectively are female, at ~42% female. In case you were curious.
797177330036867073 2016-11-11 20:41:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @camldude67 Solution: two different timelines of Baby Wah. One with and one without
797177144828903424 2016-11-11 20:40:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @camldude67 Possible, but Wah without his stache would look really weird and off, which would be funny. Tho the stache is jarring too
797176810794602496 2016-11-11 20:38:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahaha this is amazing, better than the one in my dream.
797157621539213312 2016-11-11 19:22:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> What we really need tho is Baby Waluigi. Just baby face him a bit, remove the 'stache, but keep the nose and chin, that'd be hilarious XD
797157121993408512 2016-11-11 19:20:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> This also made me realize there are 8 Mario series babies: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Wario, DK, Bowser, and Rosalina. That's quite a few.
797155129229279232 2016-11-11 19:12:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Never mind the fact that it wasn't a cool shirt, why specifically Baby DK, a character I haven't seen or thought about in over a year
797154890527162368 2016-11-11 19:11:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> In one of my dreams last night I was wearing a shirt that said "Baby Country" with Baby Donkey Kong on it, but none of the other babies
797122104890191874 2016-11-11 17:01:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT definitely just rt'd that just for the chance to get a fanny pack
797084988248354816 2016-11-11 14:34:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu I've heard from multiple people the datamined didn't find everything, this gives credence to that
797082326677258241 2016-11-11 14:23:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> They really had to squeeze in one more little thing did they? >.>
797082067817402369 2016-11-11 14:22:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh look, CoroCoro once again revealing cool information I would've much preferred to learn in game. Woohoo.
796942269874114560 2016-11-10 05:06:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just watched a Dragon Ball Z villain transform a rock into a porta potty. ...wow. I...just... Anime.
796931900598317056 2016-11-10 04:25:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> In most cases I think that causes more trouble than the villains themselves do haha.
796931291082059777 2016-11-10 04:23:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think the message DBZ tries to hammer in is that overwhelming pride and arrogance clouds judgement cuz that happens way too often.
796899514737131526 2016-11-10 02:17:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Overused stock phrases? *sigh* You just don't get it, do you? https://vimeo.com/24669583

796798033065373696 2016-11-10 19:33:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> K but was it good tho, if it was then maybe worth

796462329441505282 2016-11-09 21:19:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think nighttime has stopped existing in DBZ. In the Buu saga, 3 days pass with detailed updates of 24 hour time periods and it's all sun.
796377600608403457 2016-11-09 15:43:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT I'm glad Wednesday always has a Persona 5 English VA interview, always gives something to look forward to and there are four left! :D
796368498343706629 2016-11-09 15:07:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SnarkyRotomDex Yeah I'm kinda assuming on that last part.

796215179801399296 2016-11-08 04:57:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I agree with this so much, I've been making mediocre attempts to make jokes or cheer people up, being down
796204340662992896 2016-11-08 04:14:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> Good stuff is on the way, yeah? :)
796204264087556096 2016-11-08 04:14:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just a reminder, Sun/Moon is out in 10 days, holiday season is in a month and a half, and Persona 5 is out in 3 month and a week.
796194808717045760 2016-11-08 03:36:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I also love how I'm semi-sorta but not really live tweeting me watching DBZ, a show older than I am hahaha
796194685794525187 2016-11-08 03:36:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow Mr. Satan did something cool I don't hate him anymore. Wasn't super major but hey
796192003071557632 2016-11-08 03:25:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> When he himself calls himself out on it but continues to do it anyway I just had to call him out again not that it did anything

794040386624700417 2016-11-02 04:55:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> I saw pretty much no talk about baseball all season, didn't even know World Series was today, and now today there's tons of talk about it
794040236233756677 2016-11-02 04:55:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> 2016 is just the year for people to surprise me for how excited people get for things.
793951723622580224 2016-11-02 23:03:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT CRY OUT FOR NEW CONTENT NOT JUST REHASING OLD STUFF
793901249405947904 2016-11-02 19:43:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy It's only bad if you haven't listened to any of the Pokmon Chrimma Bash yet
793825780371369984 2016-11-02 14:43:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Which also means Spla2n may come sooner than I thought it would. Unless that team is working on some other secret project or something
793825498749030403 2016-11-02 14:42:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> This ACNL update sounds pretty big, which makes me think an AC Switch game won't be coming for a while
793823103793049605 2016-11-02 14:32:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looks like "WHY THE HELL IS THE ESHOP STILL DOWN I'M SCREAMING" 2016 was moved to today with the ACNL update haha
793646389221728256 2016-11-01 02:50:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> *earlier today at the student center* Cleaning Lady: Enjoy your lunch! Me: Thanks you too! Me on the inside: DAMNIT!!
793562034801475584 2016-11-01 21:15:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tuti_desu oh. But consider thispic.twitter.com/AySrZVIFy7
793561119923113985 2016-11-01 21:11:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Otherwise it's possible we may see an Eggman more terrifying than thispic.twitter.com/pZDBMoWbHx
793560911340384256 2016-11-01 21:10:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just realized since the Sonic movie will be CGI and live action hybrid, I really hope Eggman is CGI
793557885934383104 2016-11-01 20:58:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> No worries dude, take the time you need, and I hope school is going well! :D
793515764821090304 2016-11-01 18:11:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Well that's nice of him.
793514588390109184 2016-11-01 18:06:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also he can swallow almost everything whole, why would he eat anything in parts
793514502717181952 2016-11-01 18:06:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> In Triple Deluxe's opening sequence, apples with bite marks are shown, but Kirby has no teeth. How did those get there?
793512915529674753 2016-11-01 17:59:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Quick Wikipedia search supports that, Japanese gamers don't like FPS's much and the first two MP didn't do well there
793503447857311744 2016-11-01 17:22:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I want that Velvet Room poster but hhnnnnnnng moneeeey D:https://twitter.com/TeamSanshee/status/793502868573523969
793493969044770816 2016-11-01 16:44:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon People just really want another solid Metroid title and this wasn't anywhere near what they wanted
793493875054682113 2016-11-01 16:44:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon really makes it hurts it overall. This is the first Metroid game since Other M, also not well received.
793493476746735616 2016-11-01 16:42:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Oh yeah, I bet it would, it seems to be a decent game from what I've heard, but the fact it's been so long since the last MP
793492546383032320 2016-11-01 16:39:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie *applauds*
793492257076764672 2016-11-01 16:37:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Federation Force apparently sold less that 4,000 copies in Japan. Wow. That is horrendous.
793469668266643456 2016-11-01 15:08:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Color Splash was accidentally available to fully download when pre-loads went live. If that happens to Sun/Moon It's all over.
793461734899986433 2016-11-01 14:36:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why Croagunk is a great addition to Pokkn:pic.twitter.com/g7MkSqY2aM

793271142400167936 2016-10-31 01:59:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd, obviously, be Pepsiman, the hero this world wishes for, but probably doesn't deserve.
793270910039896064 2016-10-31 01:58:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you all dressed up for Halloween, who/what are you dressed as. And if you aren't, who/what would you if you could?
793236426393423872 2016-10-31 23:41:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> And by "peek-a-bangs", I mean bangs long enough to cover an eye, cuz why not Pictured is Makoto Yuki from the Persona 3 movie tetralogy.
793236138743910400 2016-10-31 23:40:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Today on #AnimeThingsIWishICouldDo is have peek-a-bangs. More mundane this time (and not really anime exclusive) but hey longer hair is coolpic.twitter.com/KYRdFzBZZj
793217965118201857 2016-10-31 22:27:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if microorganisms have existential crises.
793199154927325184 2016-10-31 21:13:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RubyEclipse Is this even a question? Of course!
793101163717537792 2016-10-31 14:43:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Boo and stuff
792959453461028864 2016-10-30 05:20:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah that's true, more on par with their Gen III time, but that makes sense considering how great they were, imo
792957582033813504 2016-10-30 05:13:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I consider Platinum, HGSS, BW, and B2W2 the best games in the series, the fact that they made them within a year each is pretty impressive
792957221231394816 2016-10-30 05:11:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> It'll always impress me that Game Freak released a game a year from Platinum in 2009 to XY in 2013 and all but one of them were great.
792807883255582720 2016-10-30 19:18:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know #NationalCatDay was yesterday, but here is Pickles. She is cutes.pic.twitter.com/SRYSMN0C4u
792778101524602880 2016-10-30 17:20:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think this page from the Adventures manga is one of my favorites, even without knowing the context you can almost feel how broken she is.pic.twitter.com/OxowbsfTuD
792549543938134016 2016-10-29 02:11:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess that shows how much two evolutions can change three different Pokmon :P
792549432961015808 2016-10-29 02:11:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like Primarina the most of the three, but that's even more interesting cuz Popplio was my least fave of the base trio.
792549092098383873 2016-10-29 02:10:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interestingly, Incineroar's design is growing on me. A lot. I used to dislike it, which is rare for me, but now I like it over Decidueye
792547238220181506 2016-10-29 02:02:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> But Decidueye doesn't really seem to fit any performer motif, if anything with their proficiency for stealth, they'd avoid crowds.
792546553391030273 2016-10-29 01:59:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Primarina is a ballerina and the mermaid motif reminds me of dolphin performance shows and Incineroar is a heel wrestler, loves a crowd.
792545110089015296 2016-10-29 01:54:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> At first I thought they were going for a performer theme of sorts, but Decidueye doesn't seem to fit that interestinglyhttps://twitter.com/TheStarrcasm/status/792540008817262592
792484193292783616 2016-10-29 21:52:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Ask me, he's noticed the lenience and has been exploiting it, as have some others
792407393330012160 2016-10-29 16:46:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda wanna reread the series, but I'd need to buy everything past RBY. Never mind it's $200+ to get to B2W2, I have no space for them XD
792407195690283008 2016-10-29 16:46:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been talking with peeps about the Adventures manga lately and I've been getting really hyped for the future of the series
792405894315118592 2016-10-29 16:41:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects IT'S LIKE THEY KNOW!!
792400938602377216 2016-10-29 16:21:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @theyetee Can I write in our boy, Roy?
792380631141363712 2016-10-29 15:00:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> The reason I've been into it lately is probably...no definitely cuz of this sweet remix of Porky related themes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCMXPOL4a5Y
792379726874615808 2016-10-29 14:57:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Been having a real kick for Mother 3 music lately. His Highness' Theme, Natural Killer Cyborg, Master Porky's Theme, Porky's Pokies, so good
792209305785118720 2016-10-28 03:39:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Excited to rock this awesome Gengar tee from @theyetee :Dpic.twitter.com/RvbZMUfqFL
792061457189920768 2016-10-28 17:52:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Inb4 it's like Unova where every mon takes tons of levels to evolve
792020138304208897 2016-10-28 15:08:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> This interview also goes into Nintendo's stance/thoughts on VR, so there ya go if that interests you.
792019474043904000 2016-10-28 15:05:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Quote from the interview, just as I thought, 3DS isn't dying, it's still strong enough to stand on its own.
792019312743620611 2016-10-28 15:04:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> "And certainly rather than being cannibalized by the Switch, we think the 3DS can continue in its own form."https://twitter.com/NinSwitchNews/status/792018100992434176

791850800599343104 2016-10-27 03:55:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Port or update of sorts, similar to what we saw of Mario Kart and Sploon, still too early to tell tho.
791850546931961856 2016-10-27 03:54:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another one? Wow, that's interesting. I'd wager a guess and say Pokkn is getting a Switch port.https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/791850293977833472
791842906717888512 2016-10-27 03:23:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Klonoa is a smaller Namco IP not too well known, but the second game is one of my fave games of all times, so excited for this! :O

791817459607101440 2016-10-27 01:42:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Conclusion: Twitter dun goofed.
791816622063312896 2016-10-27 01:39:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I see them on my end, but isn't Twitter planning to make @'s ignore character limits? Maybe this is just being weird or somthing
791793894031659009 2016-10-27 00:09:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I say almost cuz Aether Federation and Team Skull aren't particularly tan, Lusamine is notably lighter skinned, think she's not native.
791791596299620353 2016-10-27 00:00:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if Alola could possibly be Cynthia's home region. Probably not since she's paler than almost everyone else, but hey it's possible
791788641836146688 2016-10-27 23:48:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Brionne & Primarina are too feminine" "They shouldn't be male" "They should change the gender ratio to be 1-7 M-F" S T O P T H IS
791784148742475776 2016-10-27 23:30:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> WHY ARE YOU "WAT"-ING WHEN YOU COULD BE CATCHING GO GO GO
791779059654991872 2016-10-27 23:10:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lots of people are upset that Vine is shutting down, it's kinda funny, didn't realize people liked it so much haha
791778210635579392 2016-10-27 23:06:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yo this is really cool, good jobs.
791748173710565376 2016-10-27 21:07:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah I think the ORAS arc is almost done and yeah some sort of transition to Alola or something def could happen!!
791747401966948352 2016-10-27 21:04:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> They said famous trainer will hang at the Battle Tree, let's make it a party and bring back everyone E V E R Y O N E
791747161973063680 2016-10-27 21:03:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I still need to read B2W2, XY, and ORAS (and the manga itself has to be written) so it'll be a while but it it drops o h b o y
791746718589071360 2016-10-27 21:01:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> GREEN AND YELLOW ON VACATION LETS G O O O
791745921805496320 2016-10-27 20:58:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like, the plot of the games is gonna be pretty cool it seems, manga will kick that up multiple notches, Red and Blue will return :OOOO
791745538903248896 2016-10-27 20:57:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I JUST REALIZED THE SUN MOON CHAPTER OF THE POKMON ADVENTURES MANGA IS GONNA BE SICK
791694153713197057 2016-10-27 17:32:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SnarkyRotomDex Listen I want a fight so hard it's stupid. In the end people will love it ;D
791693727920029696 2016-10-27 17:31:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Before Sun/Moon is even out like you calm down for 1. Two: no
791693643140562944 2016-10-27 17:30:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm like one of few who don't want Sinnoh remakes and it kinda infuriates me that everyone's like SINNOH REAMESKLFAJD
791693007623823360 2016-10-27 17:28:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SnarkyRotomDex Have one of the most ridiculously tough fights ever by breaking the rules, while you're still bound to them? BRING IT ON!!
791691878697619456 2016-10-27 17:23:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also in Lance's HGSS rematch team, all can Mega Evolve (except Dragonite), I kinda wanna fight this, 5 Mega Evos and Dragonite haha
791691527915384832 2016-10-27 17:22:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> "CYNTHIA IN BATTLE TREE == SINNOH REMAKES RIGHT IT'S BASICALLY CONFIRMED WOOOO" Ugh. I haven't even seen this yet but it's gonna happen ugh
791689376145158144 2016-10-27 17:13:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @KaiserNeko Blue looks like he's about to put on his shades like "Deal with it, Red!"
791678549358809088 2016-10-27 16:30:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yes, but this spinoff makes more sense, premise wise. Also this one won't be an anime spinoff renaePetch
791676517679890432 2016-10-27 16:22:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TsukoG No one was.
791639860712910848 2016-10-27 13:57:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> News was cool but once again this is all cool stuff I would've preferred to learn in game
791402509935837184 2016-10-26 22:13:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I didn't unlike and relike or anything, so that is weird
791263766729986048 2016-10-26 13:02:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator Close enough!
791107022750035969 2016-10-25 02:39:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if the gods have the expression: "like a deer god in the heavenly headlights"
791106813412253697 2016-10-25 02:38:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how many people have said "Deer God" instead of "Dear God" I wonder what a Deer God would be like.
791086363198140416 2016-10-25 01:17:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MatPatGT You're.
791028235664363521 2016-10-25 21:26:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @donnabellez If you really want a brutal time, Master Quest 3 Heart run. By end game everything that doesn't kill in 1 hit will do so in 2
791027430265806848 2016-10-25 21:23:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @donnabellez It's really fun if you like challenge, some puzzles are changed completely so knowledge of main won't always help you haha
790972632896122880 2016-10-25 17:45:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> With an extra hour and a half, I'll totally get a ton of homework done. *barely gets any done* Guys I'm good at this.

790755722812207104 2016-10-24 03:23:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Future Cheesey you good? ...oh I guess you wouldn't know now. Either way you went from no to maybe so that's an improvement!

790736328031776768 2016-10-24 02:06:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Seems like your brain is playing Twister ;D Might wanna get that checked out.

790734788122456064 2016-10-24 02:00:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> K so hear me out: board game/non-video game speedruns. Sorry! Battleship Monopoly Risk (heh) Life Dominoes D&D Tic-Tac-Toe Jenga Twister Yes
790724312218992640 2016-10-24 01:19:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects "Too Many Emotes: The Movie": The Tetralogy.
790711839394926592 2016-10-24 00:29:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's fun thinking of uncommon/rare opinions, even if it's completely pointless. XD
790711817228029952 2016-10-24 00:29:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> OoT is the one that appears in Future Kokiri Forest, Doe T. is someone's fave TTYD NPC, or ORAS is their fave Pokmon game.
790711777835098112 2016-10-24 00:29:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's interesting thinking that unpopular character/things/ideas are someone's favorite thing. Like someone's favorite Business Deku Scrub in
790709294404554752 2016-10-24 00:19:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> As long as you like it then you're good :P
790705175748980736 2016-10-24 00:02:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Eh, I like the simplicity, thought overall it's a cool concept. As for U, uh did they play "Hey You, Pikachu!" or Dash?
790704358161723392 2016-10-24 23:59:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why guilty? Rumble Blast is pretty good (don't know about U) Those last EX Battle Royale and Team Battles are brutal tho
790407314603855872 2016-10-23 04:19:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I appreciate that, thanks :)
790407210996080640 2016-10-23 04:18:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Dammit Cubed, I knew that felt familiar renaePetch
790405488261287936 2016-10-23 04:12:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> School has really been draining me motivationally, makes me feel like I can't do anything and I hate it
790401162507726848 2016-10-23 03:54:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry tbh I never even considered a girl giving a guy flowers. I'd be really caught off guard but I'd really like it.
790367325157339136 2016-10-23 01:40:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects Go kick life's butt <3 :D
789966201505980417 2016-10-22 23:06:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> o                                                     h
789965624239722496 2016-10-22 23:04:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> The good eye, the weird eye, the really weird eye, or the bad eye. Or the really good eye?
789965212942082048 2016-10-22 23:02:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Did they at least "Daishobu" right back?
789932477150146561 2016-10-22 20:52:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> EVERYBODY LOOK AT HOW AMAZING THIS IS!! THE EDGE THE GREAT THEA;SDLFKJhttps://twitter.com/TadBitDiGital/status/789931857903321090
789930870228422656 2016-10-22 20:46:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd imagine digitally inserting gameplay footage looks better than recording it off the console via just the camera
789929732913500160 2016-10-22 20:41:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't really know why, maybe they did it to make the footage look higher quality, either way it isn't a huge deal imo
789929130250805248 2016-10-22 20:39:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not really, it's only barely there and easy to miss.
789833421837176832 2016-10-22 14:18:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Great voice acting can really bring a game and its characters to life, I love many games more than I would have because #performancematters
789322731850309632 2016-10-20 04:29:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon That one is pretty great hahaha, he's got that high speed XD
789321145103200256 2016-10-20 04:23:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Face Faulting is one of my favorite things in anime, such a bizarre way to react to something, like a face palm taken up to eleven.
789319700933074945 2016-10-20 04:17:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> I found an even greater face faulting CLANNAD gif, this would be even more fun to do hahapic.twitter.com/lrdsq5JQ8n
789319344341651457 2016-10-20 04:16:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FairPlayStudios I hope you have a very merry birthmas!! Hope you have a wonderfully awesome day! :D
789305030239059969 2016-10-20 03:19:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz @TomFawkes I'm no expert on sales and business. But...I don't think that's how marketing works...right? Nintendo pls be smart
789287481111740417 2016-10-20 02:09:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @finalsmashcomic I considered Female Robin's infamous one, but this one outclasses them all.pic.twitter.com/0hGV5bMaq5
789276738299670528 2016-10-20 01:26:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Source is "CLANNAD", for the curious.
789276387852955648 2016-10-20 01:25:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator That'd make it perfect, fall face first and bounce back up just as quickly as that didn't just happen XD
789275285329895425 2016-10-20 01:21:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I can't just throw myself on the ground, it's gotta be an instant, natural reaction. It'd prolly be painful short term but funny overall
789274948128808960 2016-10-20 01:19:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> This time on anime things I wish I could do: Face Faulting, as in falling face first in reaction to something ridiculouspic.twitter.com/mm1liNOKbo
789180489311453184 2016-10-20 19:04:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator True but who bought a Vita (besides me) renaePetch
789129802041012224 2016-10-20 15:43:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Mario Kart footage showed two items. When you have one but want to use the other, what do you do? S W I T C H
789128683999023106 2016-10-20 15:38:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda hope Switch comes out late March rather than earlier, I'll still need time to finish Persona 5 haha XD
789114788714418176 2016-10-20 14:43:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Oh yeah thats new, it's been a while since the last 3D Mario so I'm hyped for that! :D
789114526813659136 2016-10-20 14:42:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GannonRawding Prolly November, we always get one for holiday and early next year launches
789114270105477120 2016-10-20 14:41:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AlqTheTentacle Also potential DLC for Splatoon and MK8, MK8 footage showed King Boo and double items, Sploon showed new hair and pants
789113452656668675 2016-10-20 14:38:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nah you bought them all for nothing renaePetch
789110093660852224 2016-10-20 14:24:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd think the team would focus on the next Animal Crossing game first (yes same dev team) before Spla2n but we'll see
789109582970761217 2016-10-20 14:22:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects 3DS will probably stay strong a while longer, it's consistently been good sales wise, I'm not sure beyond that tho
789106183265095680 2016-10-20 14:09:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think it's more added content than a sequel, too early for that, not even a year and a half old yet
789105768913965056 2016-10-20 14:07:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yoshi Circuit could just come back but yeah it did look like MK8.
789105276741820416 2016-10-20 14:05:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Soon as in potential launch title
789105215274233857 2016-10-20 14:05:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like the Nintendo Switch, but I wanna note that King Boo was seen in Mario Kart footage, he ain't in MK8. We may be seeing MK Switch soon
788936275248242689 2016-10-19 02:54:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> The NX reveal drops at 9 CDT, when I've usually already left for the bus to commute. Looks like I'm leaving a little later than usual, worth
788931248857161730 2016-10-19 02:34:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I've noticed when he gets excited for something like back for GO's launch he tends to act like this
788929364582887427 2016-10-19 02:26:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles NX news tomorrow, so he's excited I guess?
788900390515331072 2016-10-19 00:31:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT LIKE TOMORROW?! WHAT DAY
788845255558729729 2016-10-19 20:52:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy Why would you post pics of the datamine without warning?! I trusted you! D: *mutes* renaePetch
788823978013929472 2016-10-19 19:27:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Being a dog must be pretty sweet, you get loved unconditionally by almost everyone around you just for existing
788802657729126400 2016-10-19 18:03:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> OH
788756715114106881 2016-10-19 15:00:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bummed I can't watch the trailer for hours but sooo hyped that Xander Mobus AKA Smash 4's announcer, will voice the Protagonist!!https://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/788756064158093312
788749258765676545 2016-10-19 14:30:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just hate this whole situation in general, ruins a lot of the hype for the game.
788746390222413824 2016-10-19 14:19:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sun/Moon isn't out for a month while P5 has been out for a month, you'd think amount of spoilers for each would be reversed
788568147099914240 2016-10-18 02:31:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah that's BS, we shouldn't be the ones having to do the work around, it's really dumb that things are like this
788515074075787265 2016-10-18 23:00:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> So hyped for this :Dhttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/788511220970074112
788430847581958148 2016-10-18 17:25:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Reminder that she used to have a factory that makes plant nukes. To kill humans. She prolly just tolerates humans now :P
788430109996818432 2016-10-18 17:22:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Considering you're a human, I think you'd run into some trouble there as, even after the game's end, not a big fan of us
788415658232979456 2016-10-18 16:25:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles This is one of reasons I hate leak culture, some people have no regard for any amount of discretion, just want to gain from it
788390743224098817 2016-10-18 14:46:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like with fun battles or cool features, you can do those over and over. You can only discover something once.
788390276469370880 2016-10-18 14:44:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> one of the best*
788390207355695104 2016-10-18 14:44:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah I hate how one of the biggest and imo best aspects of a new Pokmon game is being ruined like this
788372280057270276 2016-10-18 13:32:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tailsy A sick leak?! D: I hope they feel better soon! <3
788360073953193984 2016-10-18 12:44:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Won't be playing the demo, but I hope you guys enjoy "WHY THE HELL IS THE ESHOP STILL DOWN I'M SCREAMING" 2016
788358074339778561 2016-10-18 12:36:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Yo thanks for the warning I appreciate it
788357296002768896 2016-10-18 12:33:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I want u to know that I appreciate Riza more as a character and is higher up on my faves list than she would have cuz of you
788231152104448000 2016-10-17 04:12:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> respect for those who don't wish to see it. Please and thank you.
788231131988492288 2016-10-17 04:12:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can't tell you what not to tweet, but pls don't share the datamine w/o at least warning your followers or doing so privately out of
788229987123941378 2016-10-17 04:07:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah that too :/ I wish they did, but I guess they have other things to focus on
788229498663612416 2016-10-17 04:05:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I guess they've gotten really good at this stuff. Or it just wasn't that hard.
788228540483284992 2016-10-17 04:01:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> These peeps waste no time
788225582794276866 2016-10-17 03:49:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Welphttps://twitter.com/JoeMerrick/status/788225285225340928
788223096217964544 2016-10-17 03:40:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I kinda hope it doesn't. Cuz that'd just be hilarious.
788217127719186432 2016-10-17 03:16:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> K this theme is great and no one told me about it how could you do this to me D:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5Radb2yxiY
788208805137965058 2016-10-17 02:43:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Y'all enjoy your sunny moons but I'm just here listening to sweet Bayonetta musics, I need to play them sometimehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J_fAhyvJfc
788206487516479488 2016-10-17 02:34:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll take mostly scrubbed, yeshttps://twitter.com/JoeMerrick/status/788206284197724160
788200266315116544 2016-10-17 02:09:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A;LSDFKJA;LSDKFJA;LDKSFJAS;LDKFJASKDLFJhttps://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/788199158050123776
788192353299214336 2016-10-17 01:37:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Spoiler warning for the content of the demo tho
788192053955993600 2016-10-17 01:36:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0w4f-0U8_Y GUYS TERRY FROM E3 IS BACK
788153811273551873 2016-10-17 23:04:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby It's shown to be really effective, people really really *really* want their hands on this game.
788153626199859201 2016-10-17 23:04:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> It seems there'll at least be a battle against Team Skull, but I really only expect a small part of an island and some fights
788153255477977088 2016-10-17 23:02:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Candy corn tho? smh renaePetch
788151885484089344 2016-10-17 22:57:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never seen people so excited for a demo it's kinda funny haha
788081523891187712 2016-10-17 18:17:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> I DON'T KNOW DHFCEHAVRGAJDV
788080026134601728 2016-10-17 18:11:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> WHAT KIND OF DESIGN IS THAT?! ...wow I have a surprising amount to say about this, I guess I am salty
788079872656543744 2016-10-17 18:10:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I THOUGHT SMART PEOPLE WENT TO COLLEGE THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.  Actually it happens only 1 of 4 open from the outside.
788079158932844544 2016-10-17 18:08:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> And it's even better when a large group of people try 2 leave thru one door and another group try to enter through the same door
788078641800355840 2016-10-17 18:06:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> No but it's even dumber cuz two of my classrooms have not two but FOUR DOORS but nah let's only use one
788061884385599489 2016-10-17 16:59:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's true a door that doesn't open is a wall with a handle
788061488661401600 2016-10-17 16:57:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I would but the classroom has no windows and making windows is hard
788061286445617154 2016-10-17 16:57:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Well that's fine plus the sign is respectful and said please
788060974645338112 2016-10-17 16:55:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> JUST PUSH YOUR BODY AGAINST A DOOR WITH NOT EVEN THAT MUCH FORCE AND IT'LL OPEN HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT TO CALCULUS 3 BUT NOT THINK OF THIS
788060697552838656 2016-10-17 16:54:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like it'd make everyone else's lives and yours easier if you opened it opening doors isn't hard.
788060442425905153 2016-10-17 16:53:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Something that bothers me that shouldn't is when there are two doors next to each other but everyone only uses just one
787879272727797761 2016-10-16 04:53:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TylerSederwall Sounds like you need one of thesepic.twitter.com/HvwZEC7nja
787876177465647105 2016-10-16 04:41:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow that's actually really good.
787873227670327298 2016-10-16 04:29:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cherche is a female Wyvern Rider
787870163366404096 2016-10-16 04:17:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Everything can kill you you're going Griffon :P
787869528873066496 2016-10-16 04:15:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow sucks to be a griffon hahaha
787869016123510784 2016-10-16 04:13:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh Pat's right, you have TWO weaknesses
787868940462534660 2016-10-16 04:12:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Griffon Rider, that way you have a weakness that can be exploited for massive damage
787860927290888192 2016-10-16 03:40:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I did a Platinum Wedlocke earlier this year and it was really challenging but prolly the most fun I've had in a -locke challenge
787859323049222145 2016-10-16 03:34:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also if you prefer reading to a video here's a page on it http://www.azurilland.com/articles/new-way-to-play/5044-new-way-to-play-wedlocke
787859004047314949 2016-10-16 03:33:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> tl;dr three teams of two 'mons each, can only switch between pairs
787858920500977664 2016-10-16 03:32:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nuzlocke but harder. Invented by Marriland:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ2YwKAYHyY

787128292964913154 2016-10-14 03:09:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I just wanted to share how much I love the show but nope Aniplex rant ugh okay.
787117654129520641 2016-10-14 02:27:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> characters...except Litten, who I'll still name after my kitten, Pickles, so that's gonna be humorously out of place haha
787117627525115904 2016-10-14 02:27:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because of the alchemy theme present in Sun/Moon and the fact that I just finished watching FMA: B, I've decided to name my team after FMA
787071826044215296 2016-10-14 23:25:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Did you know where any of them were tho? <3
787044424119312384 2016-10-14 21:36:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Saw this and thought about @CheeseyPokemon 's exceptional geography skills ;Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1PRyGKggI
786947477639270400 2016-10-14 15:11:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hoping for the latter but unfortunately prepared for the former
786945993761656832 2016-10-14 15:05:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT In terms of numbers, not percentage, we've seen more mons before launch than ever before. Hmm.
786933672435785729 2016-10-14 14:16:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick Any news on another info drop or are we finally free? :O
786925593027751936 2016-10-14 13:44:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Serebii hasn't tweeted anything about a next info drop COULD IT BE??!!
786920382171189248 2016-10-14 13:23:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> THE EDGE CUTS LIKE A BLADE WHERE ARE THE BANDAGES
786799346733883393 2016-10-13 05:22:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Great characters, great world, excellent story, one hell of an adventure. I can't recommend enough that you give it a watch.
786798964167147520 2016-10-13 05:21:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an amazing, spectacular anime. The greatest anime I've ever seen, hands down my favorite.
786770258568683520 2016-10-13 03:27:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you ever feel uncoordinated or need a good laugh, look up infomercial fail gifs, you have to try to do worse them them.
786692970217086976 2016-10-13 22:19:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another fantastic GameCube game. We may never see a sequel to this gem, but I at least want to see it return via NX VChttps://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/786682626484600833
786669023664611328 2016-10-13 20:44:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie The how long is a guess but the Pokmon building it is explained somewhere in game yes
786650119454109696 2016-10-13 19:29:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Contradictory to their mission statement, they forced Pokmon to build it. As for how long, prolly at least year or something
786647927024291840 2016-10-13 19:20:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Best credits theme in the series imo

786559967591477248 2016-10-13 13:31:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I feel like making a chimera Pokmon conflicts with our morals, so it'll prolly be just a gift, if at all.

786551227832078337 2016-10-13 12:56:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> that I really much would've preferred learning in game, the cool feeling of the first time experience will be gone.
786551178653904896 2016-10-13 12:56:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Even when I thought we had enough, some news like Type: Null and Aether was cool to learn but now we're just learning stuff

786368307473494016 2016-10-12 00:49:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not calling anyone out and it's usually just for little things where that's no biggie, but it's an interesting mindset many people have.
786368142603804672 2016-10-12 00:49:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> I always find it interesting when people say "I lied" or "just kidding" when they're wrong about something, like they can't admit to it.
786234940505464832 2016-10-12 15:59:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought you burninated this

785910751663751168 2016-10-11 18:31:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my all time favorite games, hope to somehow see this on NX via VC sometime!https://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/785903108807397376

785288390346313728 2016-10-09 01:18:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh boy more debate talk time to do more homework
785281355701555201 2016-10-09 00:50:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Or maybe they volunteered to join the army themselves? It's the weird, mostly pointless things about in-universe stuff I love to think about
785281036938653696 2016-10-09 00:49:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tho that also makes me think about the Koopalings, did Bowser adopt a group of 7 siblings or he/their parents enlist them in the Koopa Troop
785279962366353410 2016-10-09 00:45:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> to think about
785279940975407104 2016-10-09 00:45:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> smart so he's not quite a baby. If let's say he's like 5, then had him when he was 19, which I guess is interesting know, but definitely fun
785279825267204096 2016-10-09 00:44:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> If that's true, then how old is Bowser Jr.?! He's old enough to talk (tho that means nothing, Baby Bow could talk fluently) and is pretty
785276368950992901 2016-10-09 00:30:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Miyamoto recently revealed that Mario is 24 years old. Bowser was a baby when Mario was too, so that makes Bowser around 24 too, right?
785198128664158210 2016-10-09 19:19:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Choose a move in battle in SoulSilver, slay angels while animations go on.
784899563270254592 2016-10-08 23:33:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Website says eShop, and there was no note of exclusivity.
784742522341908484 2016-10-08 13:09:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Since October 3rd And yes, I'm sure you see what they did there
784248956792426497 2016-10-06 04:28:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> ATLA or FMA is, I haven't enjoyed a series like this since I first watched ATLA back 3 or so years back.
784248932037644292 2016-10-06 04:28:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> The reason I singled out Bebop, though it had character development and a piecing together plot, it's not as much the adventure style like
784247673142386688 2016-10-06 04:23:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> a longer running series like FMA, loving it so much, not even halfway through!
784247616028540928 2016-10-06 04:22:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> The last two anime longer than 12 eps I've seen this year were Cowboy Bebop and High School DxD, so it feels pretty great to be really into

784213870608998400 2016-10-06 02:08:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not sure how to explain it but I've been motivationally drained lately, especially at home. I just can't bring myself to get much done
784172065435766784 2016-10-06 23:22:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Wow, I've never seen these before, weird they didn't do anything with them, not even in the anime
784170428180803584 2016-10-06 23:16:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Wait what Carbink forms?
784148889058238466 2016-10-06 21:50:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @Azurillkirby tbh I've seen more Delphox hate, tho I don't see anyone talk about Quilladin, which speaks for itself I guess
784146714043162624 2016-10-06 21:42:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon this really isn't even an issue
784146641880100864 2016-10-06 21:41:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Same, also we've been through this before with Quilladin, albeit for different reasons, but hate stopped after launch so
784135849566810112 2016-10-06 20:58:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> The whole feminine Brionne thing is hilariously dumb especially since no one will care anymore after launch
784069930081660928 2016-10-06 16:36:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Sun/Moon will bring a lot of new things to the table, so it's possible but not as likely, but that also depends on how fast u burn
783830105126600704 2016-10-05 00:43:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been the tiniest bit sick today, tried to start hw, but my body is heating up, conclusion: homework is literally making me sick.
783489777798479873 2016-10-04 02:11:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> maybe the same will happen for these three if they're real but I dunno
783489733221462016 2016-10-04 02:11:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's a good point. Similarly, I like Dewott much more than Samurott. I also hated Sam at first but they grew on me so
783489057670111232 2016-10-04 02:08:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> , then I don't think I like any of them. Maybe they'll grow on me, but otherwise, no.
783489017509654528 2016-10-04 02:08:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> If they're really true 1. that's incredibly stupid that EVERYTHING got leaked so early. 2. That's really the starter evos
783488526591459328 2016-10-04 02:06:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Popplio's I'll kinda give you, but Dartrix's evo looks almost nothing like Dartrix themself.
783487689861443584 2016-10-04 02:03:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> besides color scheme, that's just my opinion tho.
783487648266465280 2016-10-04 02:03:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> considering they're "leaks" and not confirmed. 3. The "leaked" starters don't really resemble the starters much
783487591890812928 2016-10-04 02:02:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hilariously so. Doesn't have to do with anything but I had to point it out. 2. I wouldn't consider any leaks
783487518880575489 2016-10-04 02:02:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Torracat just looks like a slightly bigger Litten, doesn't lean much towards Fighting. As for "leak": 1. it looks stupid.
783485891390021632 2016-10-04 01:56:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, when it seems like it's their mission to break as many trends as possible do you really think it'll be Fighting again
783485093046202372 2016-10-04 01:52:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's just flavor text, many Pokmon can casually wreck day to day things or people without the Fighting type
783362494752395264 2016-10-04 17:45:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Oh yeah I'm sure it was known but I didn't see anyone in the community talking about it and I missed it initially
783333357505515520 2016-10-04 15:50:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I dunno know how I missed this when it was revealed and didn't see anyone talk about it, but this is pretty coolpic.twitter.com/ADHtFEXh1D
783327856914866176 2016-10-04 15:28:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> All three starters have surprisingly relatable personalities Game Freak are you trying to do something to our feels?

783163454433570817 2016-10-03 04:34:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just watched the first 3 FMA: Brotherhood and wow this series starts pretty strong, really into it already! :D

782774484935716864 2016-10-02 02:49:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> you didn't get anything done. Cuz that's like every weekend for me at this point.
782774450810818561 2016-10-02 02:49:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Do you ever have those days where you weren't productive at all even tho you tried to be but you still enjoyed your day but you don't cuz
782755716524191744 2016-10-02 01:34:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Oh and Cowboy Bebop is great if you haven't seen that.
782755358003507200 2016-10-02 01:33:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie If you haven't seen FMA: Brotherhood, drops on CR tomorrow. Mob Psycho 100 is great. Hmm. I think that's all I got.

781175702271832064 2016-09-28 16:56:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Where is his right hand? Either they forgot to add it or...
780940641555537920 2016-09-27 01:22:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> That being said, Nintendo has cash for years, and that's barely an exaggeration, they just have to play the game differently.
780940091380277248 2016-09-27 01:20:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo's drastically different decisions, along with striving for uniqueness and accessibility make a lot more sense.
780939949616930816 2016-09-27 01:19:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> failures in that market better. Nintendo doesn't have that. Gaming is all they do. This dynamic, which is pretty obvious in hindsight, has
780939835175342080 2016-09-27 01:19:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Something I forget a lot is that Sony and Microsoft don't just work in games. That puts them in a unique position as they can handle
780939525132460032 2016-09-27 01:17:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> GIOVANNI AND CYRUS ONES WANThttps://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/780939248098738176
780773121896787969 2016-09-27 14:16:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because it's not like Sonic 06 level of bad, it won't get a score under 7, but not good enough to get close to 8 or 9
780772745495744513 2016-09-27 14:15:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anything lower is just terrible. Here's a lengthy but really good article on the subject.  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourPointScale
780772513231941632 2016-09-27 14:14:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Actually this makes sense, review sites use what some call a 4 point scale. 7-10 are the only scores that matter
780592275944460290 2016-09-26 02:17:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> To clarify, it's fine if you talk about it or whatever I can't stop you, but the fact that I thought that is an odd kind of impressive.
780591954174185473 2016-09-26 02:16:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Ugh, too much debate talk, I'm gonna go do my homework" I thought I just had. Wow. Good job guys.
780530145954103297 2016-09-26 22:11:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I somehow just realized pretty much all my life I've been pronouncing centaur "cen-eh-taur", prolly got that from "minotaur" but still
780226249679527936 2016-09-25 02:03:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah, so that explains it! #NeverLiveInTexaspic.twitter.com/3jzBRN14nY
779902748380712960 2016-09-24 04:37:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @_razzchan_ Happy birthday! Hope you have a fantastic day, stay awesome!! :D
779411117273550848 2016-09-23 20:04:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> I never noticed cuz it was always played for laughs. Cuz pain is hilarious.
779408936856190976 2016-09-23 19:55:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> You know in hindsight, Brock flirting with pretty much *every single girl* he met is kinda really creepy. That shouldn'tve been a thing
779352136467439616 2016-09-23 16:10:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Interesting, I'll have to watch the new episode later but thanks for clearing that up!
779163806677164032 2016-09-22 03:41:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> THAT MAKOTO THEME!! I really hope we get these themes America come launch. CUZ WOW SHE LOOKS BADASShttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/779162903026950144
779155367116759040 2016-09-22 03:08:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, these are airing on Fridays. Sun/Moon launches (for the most part) on Nov 18, a Friday, I wonder what they're gonna do for that ep? :O
779155157590302720 2016-09-22 03:07:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> there is still a lot we don't know about a lot of the future episodes, even with the above and villainous leaders in mind
779155111973122049 2016-09-22 03:07:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting to note that Zygarde, Giovanni, Looker, and Regigigas were all shown off in just the first two episodes, with 16 episodes left,
778770800430026752 2016-09-21 01:40:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Vulpix looks cute so people give them a pass. Meowth isn't as so, thus, shit lost.
778435962133028864 2016-09-20 03:29:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Note: @TadBitDiGital is far from the serious one. renaePetch
778432882888970240 2016-09-20 03:17:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Yeah I know, twas a joke :P
778431707674320897 2016-09-20 03:12:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hurricanes would be much more feared if they were much more excitingly named #HurricaneDoomageaddonpic.twitter.com/Nw9M4MyX1K
778231238465171457 2016-09-20 13:56:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> in Sun/Moon, but it doesn't seem like it
778231187789656064 2016-09-20 13:55:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I felt like Pokkn had a solid selection for guys, but I haven't seen the girls' for comparison, thought they could step up
778230889176113152 2016-09-20 13:54:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah I'm just gonna forgo the "maybe we get decent stuff" and play the girl.
778227025802764288 2016-09-20 13:39:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Yeah that'd be a problem. It'd make sense to both allow and disallow Z-Moves in competitive, so I'm not sure how that will go
778225797744107521 2016-09-20 13:34:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Z-Move animations will probably be skippable Probably.
778222302198497280 2016-09-20 13:20:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> So much customization, might play as the girl this time cuz their options will be much better
778216596388974592 2016-09-20 12:57:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Merry Birthmas! Hope you have a great one! :D
778214868616818690 2016-09-20 12:50:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> GF was super careful about the Wii U. It only got TWO games: Rumble and Pokkn. It'll make it yeah, but how many?
777545014544994304 2016-09-18 16:29:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just finished the work, which becomes a new genre itself, Cowboy Bebop. And what a great work it was. See You, Space Cowboy.
777178888367595525 2016-09-17 16:14:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Didn't do Gen VII cuz I wanna see 'em all before I can rank them
777178739163619333 2016-09-17 16:13:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I did a thing.pic.twitter.com/xmVpxsnl5M
776982862553755648 2016-09-16 03:15:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles pirated stuff before, only cuz there was little alternative to watching it or whatever
776982818479931392 2016-09-16 03:15:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles I agree with them on some points, but also yes, they shame people too much for it, that's the reason I didn't bring up that I've
776958506498793472 2016-09-16 01:38:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sephazon Sorry to hear that. D:
776469828777324544 2016-09-15 17:16:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Geez, poison ivy must suck. A lot. Hope you get better soon! Or eventually. Dunno how that lasts
776468117383884800 2016-09-15 17:09:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> This situation gets worse and worse every time you update about it
776448895874322432 2016-09-15 15:53:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait. Wait. Wait. Do you just start with Growl and Tail Whip No attacking Really That's hilarious
776446398501752833 2016-09-15 15:43:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> That'd be stupid but also, I kinda wanna see someone just run into Rayquaza over and over again haha
776445908040810497 2016-09-15 15:41:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah you're cheesing it 1/10 do over, but don't use any moves Just regular A attack. HEH
776444468635406336 2016-09-15 15:36:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait you're at Groudon already, geez you waste no time haha
776269151996260352 2016-09-14 03:59:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> P5's battle theme, Last Surprise, is sooooo good. The OST is gonna be so good These next few months are gonna be brutal
776264055283523584 2016-09-14 03:39:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry OKAY OK THAT'S GREAT
776182716022657028 2016-09-14 22:15:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Moltres will destroy all of your dreams good luck but gg Unless you grind. But I won't let you.
776166430295199744 2016-09-14 21:11:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was just listening to this and I really enjoy it, love the guitar!
776151652109721600 2016-09-14 20:12:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree My day's alright, hope you're doing well!!
776101673299161088 2016-09-14 16:53:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Protagonist's name is Akira Kurusu, I know what I'm naming my protag now hahahttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/776093902746951680
776086679543164928 2016-09-14 15:54:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> But...if the app is running, wouldn't it track steps anyway?https://twitter.com/NinWire/status/776084634761396225
776047235188396032 2016-09-14 13:17:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Japan got screenshots and official artwork of the UBs but that's oddly it
776045413765754881 2016-09-14 13:10:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> We're getting news on the 20th And it seems it's just delayed an hour? Not sure
776044292586348544 2016-09-14 13:05:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Masuda I have to go catch the bus to school so any time you wanna drop this is great
775904080929533952 2016-09-13 03:48:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen That's too bad, I took an odd enjoyment in thinking my mere existence was the reason literally everything is ruined. Oh well.
775893874287837184 2016-09-13 03:08:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen Wait, that means I'm not part of the group of people who apparently ruin everything?! D:
775863059998871552 2016-09-13 01:05:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> You peeps using the buddy system in GO may appreciate this info on getting candy for your 'mons https://pokeassistant.com/buddystats?locale=en
775859874605309953 2016-09-13 00:53:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> There was something unique about my mom being mind blown by something Pokmon related, I never thought something like this would ever happen
775859661933203460 2016-09-13 00:52:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> A couple days ago I told my mom about Magikarp needing 400 candies to evolve in GO and showed her what Gyarados looked like, she was amazed
775852350816686080 2016-09-13 00:23:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Though I can barely tell anything about those people other than the fact that they're people so who knows
775852244084273153 2016-09-13 00:22:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd The other thing that makes me doubt it's N's Castle is that those people don't look like Plasma peeps
775851995055861760 2016-09-13 00:21:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's also true, which makes them even more cool cuz their League is over the V O I D
775850833225195520 2016-09-13 00:17:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I thought of that too, but the bridges from his castle tore through the League. Though it could be the interior
775850360321679360 2016-09-13 00:15:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> btw I'm talking about scenes in the #PokemonGenerations trailer, as these were the only two scenes I didn't get to analyze yet
775850217329393666 2016-09-13 00:14:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm thought it was the Unova Pokmon League, as four people are shown, but it doesn't look so similar to the 1 in game aside from the bridge
775849788377968641 2016-09-13 00:12:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm thinking the cave scene is in Terminus Cave, evident by the Noivern (thx @TadBitDiGital), but the 2nd pic hmmpic.twitter.com/NMaJGoRv9i
775835526901354496 2016-09-13 23:16:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I approve of this yes good
775772488034693120 2016-09-13 19:05:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Went to the library earlier andpic.twitter.com/cnHVdl7UFu
775723927439933441 2016-09-13 15:52:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also teased in promo art: Face off against all villainous leaders, N, Primal legends, AZ. Hype hype and more hype
775723448563662849 2016-09-13 15:50:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is just a taste of what we'll see in Generations, I'm so hyped!! :Dpic.twitter.com/CGrhFgms29
775721489563721730 2016-09-13 15:43:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is the most excited I've ever been for Pokmon in animated form, this is gonna be amazing! :D
775720967125348352 2016-09-13 15:41:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> THIS LOOKS SO AMAZING I'M SO HYPED FOR THIShttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/775716833823293440
775707874051796992 2016-09-13 14:49:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Are Petch and Lonk a couple? What's the lore here?" An actual question I just asked myself
775685400647966721 2016-09-13 13:19:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> cooler but oh well I guess
775685347233505280 2016-09-13 13:19:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Rockruff's evolution, Rugarugan, is actually version exclusive and not like Espeon/Umbreon like the text implied, thought that would've been

775532454866063361 2016-09-12 03:12:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> TV Tropes is a wonderful website and it will ruin your life.
775516996884570112 2016-09-12 02:10:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> And when you use Metronome, you can't choose your target. You don't know what you're using or who it's hitting, it'll be wonderful! :D
775515661120397312 2016-09-12 02:05:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> My brother just came up with a genius idea to do in Sun/Moon: Metronome Wars Battle Royale. The beautiful chaos of Metronome Wars amplified!
775503403279540224 2016-09-12 01:16:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TomFawkes If I know it's unchanged besides coloring then yes. They'd look gross/unappealing, but it tastes the same in the end
775487888897089536 2016-09-12 00:14:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Sun/Moon looks promising in many ways but this is 1 thing that prolly won't be shown before launch: will it be too easy or not
775481593481748480 2016-09-12 23:49:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> Community is a great show and you should watch it that's my story peace
775427892079579136 2016-09-12 20:16:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sephazon That's awesome! Congrats!
775425296090603520 2016-09-12 20:06:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Boredom or carsickness, which would I rather deal with? -_-
775424911120543744 2016-09-12 20:04:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> While reading manga on the bus made the time go by quicker, I forgot that I get carsick when I read in a moving vehicle, that wasn't fun

775378535846252544 2016-09-12 17:00:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Bulbagarden @Dragonair314 Mudsdale's weight is actually accurate to the horse it's based on, the cyldesdale, so actual logic is in use
775350740562739200 2016-09-12 15:09:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> stronger Beauty, but with the beautiful appearance sacrificed for power. Or something I duuno, my ideas are all over haha
775350593476931585 2016-09-12 15:09:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> The name "Expansion" throws me off, it could be Beauty's abilities enhanced like a form change or somehow created to be a
775348130086653952 2016-09-12 14:59:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Maybe appearance is the only thing they have in common, like behavior and abilities are identical?
775347012455632897 2016-09-12 14:55:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry She doesn't stream on weekends as of late
775340443517067265 2016-09-12 14:29:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Around 50 including Alolan variants I think
775327234672517120 2016-09-12 13:36:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Double checked Serebii and Bulbapedia and yes time of day determines which form it takes
775325955745132545 2016-09-12 13:31:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Locks u for 24 hours, still in new games I don't know why people think it'll change cuz it's just an Espeon/Umbreon situation
775325205744922625 2016-09-12 13:28:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for UB-02 Beauty, they just look like Lusamine; whatever these Ultra Beasts are they know what beauty and who's got the most. XD
775324795818823681 2016-09-12 13:26:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can't unsee UB-02 Expansion looking a lot  like the Persona Rokuten Maoh from Persona 4, minus the mustachepic.twitter.com/j5xkcvlP5k
775320591326818304 2016-09-12 13:10:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> So glad I discovered Crunchyroll has a manga app, will make bus rides to and from school much less boring! :D
775320024160489472 2016-09-12 13:07:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I'll have to check that out, thanks!
775174140374298624 2016-09-11 03:28:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chansey could also learn Submission, with stubby arms like those, I'd love to see one try hahaha
775172926957948928 2016-09-11 03:23:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> And by TM, Arcanine, Cloyster, and Butterfree among others can bizarrely learn Teleport. Cuz Wynaut, right? :P
775171911261167616 2016-09-11 03:19:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Really strange decision
775171875634688000 2016-09-11 03:19:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> learn it. Excluding Mew's elusivity, the TM exists almost solely to be taught to Chansey, who can't learn the move naturally for some reason
775171837315559424 2016-09-11 03:19:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was looking through Gen I TM moves that could be transferred to Sun/Moon and noticed Softboiled was a TM, but only Chansey and Mew could
775137095090176000 2016-09-11 01:00:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects I've missed seeing dumb comments like this hahaha
775027894905032704 2016-09-11 17:47:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> From what I've observed, a good way to get good at any fighting game is to practice practice practice practice and practice
774960326815080448 2016-09-11 13:18:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ha! Haha! Hahahahahahahaha!!
774820024515108864 2016-09-10 04:01:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> My lack of concentration has gotten to the point where I have to tell myself "Alright now get the paper yes and now the pencil k now write"
774797420144136192 2016-09-10 02:31:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man I love FFVII for the NES
774771847242014720 2016-09-10 00:49:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TraviSemajBers I guess so haha
774770211316609025 2016-09-10 00:43:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TraviSemajBers I'm just wondering where it come from, it was never that big a thing for anyone from what I've seen in earlier years
774768043268333569 2016-09-10 00:34:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> all craving it. But has this always been a thing or did it start in recent years and I haven't noticed either way?
774767957251530752 2016-09-10 00:34:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last year I saw more love for October and Halloween than I've ever seen cuz of you guys, now we're not even halfway through Sept. and you're
774363675184562177 2016-09-09 21:47:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's fair :P
774363198048833538 2016-09-09 21:45:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> But really if you have any interest in LoZ, Ocarina of Time is a good game to start with, has a re-release on 3DS
774362833257635841 2016-09-09 21:44:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Zelda CDi is a good game to start with
774361244237193217 2016-09-09 21:38:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> The only others I've played are the original and Four Swords, I need to play more Zelda games :P
774360597139972101 2016-09-09 21:35:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> #Top5ZeldaGames  1. Skyward Sword 2. Wind Waker 3. Link's Awakening 4. Ocarina of Time 5. Oracle of Ages (unfinished)
774255998580039680 2016-09-09 14:39:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> THIS GAME LOOKS SO COOLhttps://twitter.com/P5jouhoukyoku/status/774227346844815360
774040027189747713 2016-09-08 00:21:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Better and better means things are better, so yay indeed! :D
773963429476302848 2016-09-08 19:17:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my fave fights, but man is it brutal hahaha
773962239535484928 2016-09-08 19:12:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thinking back on it RBRT was pretty tough haha
773961866489933824 2016-09-08 19:11:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Uh, isn't the boss for Mt. Blaze a little too tough?" "Huh? It's only 2x your expected level, that's fine!"

773949481691643904 2016-09-08 18:21:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I guess so, but I'm also just overanalyzing/exaggerating how important this is :P
773944132842598400 2016-09-08 18:00:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Not sure really, but they were obviously going off of "first Oak is Samuel, so let's make it similar" which is just eh to me
773923270315749376 2016-09-08 16:37:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Bulbagarden Lance and Clair are cousins, there's some strong competition. The Oaks are unmatched otherwise ;P
773923105601302529 2016-09-08 16:37:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Persona_Central I was kinda worried about this, I didn't think you would, but it was in the back of my mind, thank you for clearing this up
773918968029470720 2016-09-08 16:20:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I... But... ...okay
773916239940812801 2016-09-08 16:09:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anyone else think it's dumb his name is "Samson"? It's not a big deal, but they could've been a little more creative
773915221727391744 2016-09-08 16:05:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> The world loves Mario, so someone's excited for it, but for us more into gaming, it's not exciting
773874454573309954 2016-09-08 13:23:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby discover things and everything they reveal is one less thing they can discover on their own
773874340286849024 2016-09-08 13:23:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby We'll all buy the game anyway, no matter how much news we get, so their strategy is working, but people still-
773874100221640705 2016-09-08 13:22:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I get it's a business, but it's getting to a point where it isn't enjoyable for the consumer. The other thing is-
773742941391257601 2016-09-07 04:41:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls I feel like the fact that Megas haven't been mentioned at all is pretty telling, can't be 100% sure but yeah
773742781332353024 2016-09-07 04:40:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't think I've ever gotten annoyed for a company promoting their game TOO much
773737963519873024 2016-09-07 04:21:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> RTing to inform but GF can we please stophttps://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/773737696137187328
773734585721032704 2016-09-07 04:07:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> P5's marketing has been one of the best I've ever seen for anything and the Persona 5 PS4 commercial in my LRT is a great example of that.
773733252171456513 2016-09-07 04:02:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator Is she wrong tho?
773702185955782656 2016-09-07 01:59:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I could see an Alolan Cubone existing but I'd think Pikachu or even Exeggcute could be unchanged
773702031206969344 2016-09-07 01:58:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I see what you mean and that could be the case for some, but some could just completely change their type, it's not impossible
773699237557272576 2016-09-07 01:47:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @Nomppie I'm sure they edited the scenes to speed up the evolution animation, as we get the picture without seeing it all
773694448446341120 2016-09-07 01:28:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie It could just be that some standards evolve into their Alolan variants, they've shown so multiple times, not on accident I'm sure
773614028736307200 2016-09-07 20:08:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Is that really it? I have to care about getting a PS4 between now and Feb. but if that's it for a $100 bump I'll just get the slim.
773584990428815361 2016-09-07 18:13:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been wondering where all the Lusamine fan art was but now it's showing up yes good
773315446086905856 2016-09-06 00:22:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does this count as a meaningful post? For real tho, that's pretty consistent across many people, from what I've seen
773311878705537024 2016-09-06 00:08:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie But he's old, old people aren't evil! ...sometimes. ...often.
773308280173060097 2016-09-06 23:53:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I like how many people think "Aether Federation is evil cuz the have grunts" Guys A federation needs employees
773270588227858433 2016-09-06 21:24:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> It makes sense for reviewers to play through a game faster than normal but given the statement that it'd be longer I'd expect to take 100hrs
773269812961091584 2016-09-06 21:21:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find "80 hours" odd, as this was stated to be a longer game than P3 or 4, and I found those to be around 90 hrshttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/773268493777063936
772948217252024320 2016-09-05 00:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon What he said
772945180517249029 2016-09-05 23:51:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Glad to know the creative minds of Nintendo are wonderful trolls haha
772944964791656448 2016-09-05 23:50:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> According to Iwata, HAL Laboratory "was named as such because each letter put us one step ahead of IBM!" Source:http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/11/iwata_explains_where_the_name_hal_laboratory_came_from
772914825617825792 2016-09-05 21:50:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Cheated and lied to! D:
772896460069154817 2016-09-05 20:37:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> Note that a Nuzlocke potentially doesn't allow you to use a newly discovered 'mon, even if you *really* want to

772586605164961792 2016-09-04 00:06:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw thinking the words "I should start my hw soon" and actually starting your hw are like 5 hours apart. Oops.
772487689648148480 2016-09-04 17:33:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> tropes and a frustrating protagonist. It's not bad and it has its good moments, but imo it's pretty overhyped.
772487670845014016 2016-09-04 17:33:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Caught up on Orange and I'm gonna be honest, I don't really see why it's been so hyped. Without spoiling, it has typical high school drama
772442282947547136 2016-09-04 14:32:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Pokmon games are jam packed with content, I wouldn't say we know "little", but we don't know a lot.
772440975755005954 2016-09-04 14:27:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also it's Japanese cuz I haven't found English motto on YT with the new music, early XY uses a remix of original motto theme for its music
772440621214683136 2016-09-04 14:26:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been watching Team Rocket's motto from XY&Z on an almost daily basis recently! Visuals and music are amazing!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nT_b7k6HEY
772291771233480704 2016-09-03 04:34:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Ask me and *almost* every pizza chain is good, I don't understand the mass debates over them :P Pizza's just good.
772221886138724353 2016-09-03 23:56:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Every single one has been Kanto, and prolly not by coincidence, which is too bad cuz I'd like to see a ton more. Or GF is trolling.
772205569369223168 2016-09-03 22:52:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Started Orange and not gonna lie it's frustrating to watch hahaha
772191340062920704 2016-09-03 21:55:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain Ah, that's more than fair enough :P
772190531329765377 2016-09-03 21:52:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain Ah I see, then yeah "don't have a system" is pretty accurate :P
772188884067201024 2016-09-03 21:45:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain 1st and 2nd game are on PC I'm pretty sure you have one of those ;P
771927394441625600 2016-09-02 04:26:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles @CheeseyPokemon I've noticed that too, they need to let people have their own thing and just get their own >.>
771870275193413633 2016-09-02 00:39:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon w h o a Doing it. Thanks for showing me the way! :O
771869534802288640 2016-09-02 00:36:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Once I figure out how to soft reset in real life, what animal should I shiny hunt for first? I was thinking a bird or a squirrel.
771769091807772672 2016-09-02 17:57:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeMerrick Why would they remove them if they make money?
771737587799076864 2016-09-02 15:52:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> That was a confusing way to explain that sorry but main point is Sun/Moon has 4th most tracks on OST :P
771736948155097088 2016-09-02 15:50:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> games, the other 124 are not from BW, but new tracks for the game
771736824867807233 2016-09-02 15:49:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> BW and B2W2 coincidentally both have the same number of tracks on their super collections, but 49 of B2W2's are from other
771736548383399936 2016-09-02 15:48:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just checked Bulbapedia, B2W2 Super Collection has 17 tracks from Emerald and 32 from Platinum, so B2W2 has 124 new tracks
771735323768262656 2016-09-02 15:43:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> From the few themes I've heard of the OST, trainer and wild battle, the OST is gonna have some good battle themes, so I'm hyped :D
771734957597130752 2016-09-02 15:42:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT the Sun/Moon OST will have 175 tracks, which I thought was a lot until I checked past ones: HGSS - 270 ORAS - 260 XY - 212 BW&B2W2 - 173
771515928710254593 2016-09-01 01:11:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon O           H ... ...well at least you have an open mind.
771513186428215296 2016-09-01 01:00:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also Origins is great, I hope they do something cool like that again sometime
771511524548485120 2016-09-01 00:54:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> From Pokmon Origins Episode 3 THEY KNEW.
771511405782585344 2016-09-01 00:53:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> "It looks like you have at least learned better than to try to brute strength of your Charizard against every opponent." -Giovanni
771455207506972672 2016-09-01 21:10:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Maybe not about alternate timelines but they care enough to make a timeline of when each main games occur
771453945411538944 2016-09-01 21:05:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pretty sure it is. I usually don't theorize but there is strong evidence to support it and I can't find any counters
771453218043736064 2016-09-01 21:02:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Considering the whole alternate timeline thing, your tweet would be an Alolan's response, prolly doesn't exist in this time
771420289104171009 2016-09-01 18:51:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> hype building and time, the game's main development is done. It's almost here, at least for Japan. Whoa.
771420258582142976 2016-09-01 18:51:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Holy crap, Persona 5 comes out in 2 weeks in Japan. Which isn't as big a deal since it's still 5 months until US release, but after all this
771408447132676096 2016-09-01 18:04:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gold points, however, last an extra 6 months now
771408248083591168 2016-09-01 18:03:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's really annoying having my only time to eat between classes TuTh be the busiest time of the day on campus restaurants
771399731801038848 2016-09-01 17:30:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 bumping this, any April points expire in a month.
771384648433750016 2016-09-01 16:30:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> The change to 2D sidescrolling may make it a lot more accessible to those who were overwhelmed/weren't into the other 3
771381581009170432 2016-09-01 16:17:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Either way, I love me some Pikmin, so I'm excited for it :D
771381510368735232 2016-09-01 16:17:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because of this, I think it's safe to assume the "Pikmin 4" confirmed earlier is indeed the one planned for 3DS.
771381367024123904 2016-09-01 16:17:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Forgot the article oops: http://www.siliconera.com/2015/09/07/pikmin-4-is-being-developed-now/
771381313714565124 2016-09-01 16:16:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Got confirmation: when it was initially announced, no console was confirmed
771380943911198720 2016-09-01 16:15:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Cuz Pikmin 3DS could be the one he was talking about, or we could be getting *another* Pikmin game for NX
771380767133831168 2016-09-01 16:14:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> Miyamoto mentioned earlier this year that a Pikmin 4 was in development, I gotta double check whether that was confirmed for NX or not
771377411023704064 2016-09-01 16:01:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just watched the Direct. That was cool, genuinely did not expect to see Pikmin, hyped! :D
771344614083092481 2016-09-01 13:51:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Since two days ago haha Also it starts at the end of the hour, so yeah
771327852109139968 2016-09-01 12:44:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Scizor's words echo in your head: "Don't get your hopes too high for the Direct or you'll just disappoint yourself and blah blah blah

770644361591664645 2016-08-30 15:28:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> inb4 the NX was a giant prank by Nintendo and they got us all
770644192313774080 2016-08-30 15:27:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> While I accurately predicted there will be a Direct this August or Sept, I didn't think it wouldn't focus on the NX

770112507587489792 2016-08-28 04:15:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'd never do that. HOWEVER, I feel like I'd disallow my kids from watching shows on TV that are just too stupid. Like dangerously bad.
770112319959494663 2016-08-28 04:14:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> There are all those parents who didn't allow their kids to watch certain shows cuz they think they're inappropriate or whatever dumb reason
770104516935114752 2016-08-28 03:43:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> It'll be a memorable one, but for all the weird/wrong reasons.
770080606793367553 2016-08-28 02:08:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Wow, week long is brutal! XD Pretty sure internet on campus is faster so I'mma try there, no day long downloads for me! :P
770078513814769664 2016-08-28 01:59:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Tried to download a thing for school and hahahahahahaha I've never seen a estimated download time so long XDpic.twitter.com/lwz5dM8M7O
769348468770938880 2016-08-26 01:39:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've actually never heard of that, but everyone knows this one so :P
769348142223331328 2016-08-26 01:37:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah I see, that is much better, good to look forward to that! (college is rough, but not as terrible as I joking make it :P)
769343105698975744 2016-08-26 01:17:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy #NationalDogDay  I'm a terrible person.pic.twitter.com/cUCHgnk80f

769310455043018753 2016-08-26 23:08:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> "better things" like college? hahahahaha Oh wait I should be a proper upperclassman and give advice. Um...uh..good luck? :P

769202810252427264 2016-08-26 16:00:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love that boss fight and how long it took so I'm happy they screwed up in that regard :P
769201631950884864 2016-08-26 15:55:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Surprised PiT got second, love the game but it seemed like the least favored of the series
769003180889870336 2016-08-25 02:47:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Of course, reality is an illusion anyway and this is all one big social experiment to see if the universe can handle multi-soul interaction.

769001296388960256 2016-08-25 02:39:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> What if when you die, your soul gets reincarnated to a completely different person and time, *billions* of times, to the point where you'd
768871475717648384 2016-08-25 18:03:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I'm waiting for one rn actually

768870323462610944 2016-08-25 17:59:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Today I thought the words "eh, but I always have pizza" OH NO WHATS HAPPENING TO ME I DIDN'T THINK THOSE WORDS COULD BE IN ONE SENTENCE!! D:
768810115105492992 2016-08-25 13:59:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> What a irresponsible mayor, shouldn't you act like a real politician and...oh wait
768788434588536832 2016-08-25 12:33:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Paper Jam isn't that good anyway *bang bang*, the shots
768647325061226497 2016-08-24 03:12:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon to wonder about.
768647274276659200 2016-08-24 03:12:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I'd totally watch it, I love thinking on things that really don't expand on anything major in universe, but are still things
768632205442547712 2016-08-24 02:12:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Stupid_Pokenerd But I care, as I ask the questions that matter least and no one else does. How many people think about taxes? :P
768630875751723008 2016-08-24 02:07:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@Nomppie Yeah that makes more sense, but if gyms, centers, and (presumably) the Pokmon League all run via taxes, taxes must be pretty high
768629938442252288 2016-08-24 02:03:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon Centers are probably funded by taxes, right? And gyms? Unless gyms are funded by the money of trainers who lose to the leaders...

768549378315329536 2016-08-24 20:43:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Extremely sarcastic to the point of always being obnoxiously condescending.
768543221068668928 2016-08-24 20:19:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby You'll need a Wiimote and Nunchuck to play them.
768536997640019968 2016-08-24 19:54:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is $30 on Wii U and really worth the purchase imo, nice collection of some great games!https://twitter.com/OnThisDayGaming/status/768504926972547073
768459898438823936 2016-08-24 14:48:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Whatever is troubling you right now, I know you can get through it, never forget how amazing you are!!
768252778875531264 2016-08-23 01:05:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's weird having such a bright jacket, cuz almost everything I wear is either black or dark colors. :P
768252595936780288 2016-08-23 01:04:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Chie says "Don't think, feel", but I'll be thinking about how great it feels 2 have this jacket from @InsertCoinTeespic.twitter.com/XHjhF3ARW6
768235674214346753 2016-08-23 23:57:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> do it for me
768235646141931520 2016-08-23 23:57:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Everything's okay now, please don't worry about me, but one day the consequences of failing might be drastic, there won't be someone else to
768235437068390400 2016-08-23 23:56:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never hated something about myself more than now how do people do it. I want to support others but I can never figure out what to say
768235253655666688 2016-08-23 23:55:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hate how powerless I am, my brother needed words of support today and I couldn't say anything, just stood there silently like an idiot

768146655006760961 2016-08-23 18:03:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles year without everyone in the community. Just remember you won't ever be alone!
768146628062523392 2016-08-23 18:03:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Always remember you have us here online, I can relate to this a lot and I really don't know how I could've made it through last
767910908626624512 2016-08-22 02:26:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> So hyped for the #CellGames, better start drinking plenty of juice! :D
767713521152827392 2016-08-22 13:22:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I've tried and tried, but the universe is literally unbeatable in DDR.
767712628613316608 2016-08-22 13:18:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Let's just say the universe does not miss a single beat.
767712578185211907 2016-08-22 13:18:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me: You know, it'd be just my luck if a car drove by and splashed water on my like those unlucky people on TV.
766305405496549376 2016-08-18 16:07:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Terminator is a new Pokmon. Neat.
766290559925301248 2016-08-18 15:08:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Ah okay then, thanks for clearing that up.
766290385962315776 2016-08-18 15:07:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> But they're not being treated or anything are they? Do hospitals just have rooms full of people just hanging out? Healthy ppl just chillin'?
766289292024872960 2016-08-18 15:02:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why do Pokmon Centers in the anime just have stockpiles of Pokmon? It's like they only exist to be stolen by Team Rocket.
766123727553597444 2016-08-17 04:05:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Chespin evolves into that?" -Bonnie on the subject of Quilladin. Guys their jokes are getting meta, or I'm just reading into things :P

765996963728797696 2016-08-17 19:41:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator We don't like to tell many foreigners this, but many American women are actually pirates. Be careful out there! ;P
765919320002088962 2016-08-17 14:32:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @4reel17 Wait...is it your birthday? For real?! Happy birthday!! I hope you have a really real birthday, whatever that means ;P
765705115583995904 2016-08-16 00:21:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Those two, along with Master Core are just some of those characters that prolly won't get expansion and detail, but the mystery makes it fun
765703237240446977 2016-08-16 00:14:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if Master Hand and Crazy Hand fight each other in their spare time, I wonder who's stronger.
765698552110587904 2016-08-16 23:55:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know they're dense. But. REALLY?!

765360432236236800 2016-08-15 01:32:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YFYGuy Yes you can trade legends, you're required to in some games to get some other legends.
765353061762027520 2016-08-15 01:02:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find it kind of amusing that in the XY anime, of all characters, Bonnie is the most sarcastic character. Well, the only sarcastic char.
765339941870014465 2016-08-15 00:10:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looks like they determined P5 to be a viable enough threat, and this evidence shows that, interesting.
765339709920817152 2016-08-15 00:09:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Squenix JP held a survey a while back asking if fans would get FFXV or P5 if they launched in the same month, Sept.https://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/765339137608220673
765338892455190529 2016-08-15 00:06:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> You point at the moon then take a nap.https://twitter.com/kylegaddo/status/765246676852277248
765323022244851712 2016-08-15 23:03:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I found the Delta Episode to just be, go here, talk to this person, go there, talk. Too much exposition.
765302296624320512 2016-08-15 21:41:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> To clarify tho, I don't think XY was bad, just meh. ORAS tho...that's a different story
765301872529805312 2016-08-15 21:39:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because of this, it's gonna be odd thinking back to these past few months for Sun/Moon promotion after we've had a few months with it
765301236652384256 2016-08-15 21:36:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's even weirder how the desire for Hoenn remakes was a big Internet meme. Then ORAS happened.
765301105525821440 2016-08-15 21:36:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's weird thinking back on how hype I was when XY was revealed Jan 2013. And then I played it.
765288456834514945 2016-08-15 20:46:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Can't let a good cake go to waste.
765282382576353280 2016-08-15 20:21:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> The XY anime really likes the "let's separate the characters" trope. Was that always a thing in the older series?
765247172681961472 2016-08-15 18:01:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YFYGuy Better than looking for glasses on your face. Listen I was probably tired.
765215117218762752 2016-08-15 15:54:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree o m g No that's not bad, that's pretty great actually, I approve :D
765208890883530756 2016-08-15 15:29:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> This dumb schedule change ruined plans I had w/friend only reschedule can happen Labor Day or winter break in December this is so dumb ugh
765193043704111108 2016-08-15 14:26:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Welp better keep checking the date on the school's site to make sure it doesn't change THIS WEEK OR SOMETHING DFDUMBASD;FLAJSDFL;JADFOWIANVW
765191215956398081 2016-08-15 14:19:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I *triple* checked the date back in June, so the only way this could've happened is that they CHANGED IT and DIDN'T NOTIFY me a;sldkjfa;dlsk
765186292359442432 2016-08-15 14:00:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> All this time I thought school started on the 28th. It starts the 22nd.  This is my last week.  o     h
764692018714992640 2016-08-13 05:15:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I once opened my fridge to look for a fork to eat yogurt. Goodnight! :D
764686755316441089 2016-08-13 04:55:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> and it's exciting wondering where it'll all lead in the main series.
764686501028335616 2016-08-13 04:54:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow, just finished the first two Mega Evolution specials, and they were pretty interesting, nice to see things from a different perspective
764631692946444288 2016-08-13 01:16:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...oh Oh no...
764495061023240193 2016-08-13 16:13:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is why I don't get involved in fandoms, cuz some people are just >.>
764320996987764736 2016-08-12 04:41:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw even the narrator is getting tired of the filler, hahaha
764320921360277504 2016-08-12 04:41:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> "On the eve of Ash's Kalos gym battle with Korrina, our heroes have *finally* arrived in Shalour City."
764269506214502401 2016-08-12 01:17:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> But don't be like them and fail again, actually succeed eventually ;D
764269322269143040 2016-08-12 01:16:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> They're never deterred by failure, despite that being their whole life. Remember if you feel like a failure, be like TRio and never give up!
764268971675652096 2016-08-12 01:14:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Another thing I respect about the TRio is their Shuckle shell strong willpower. They NEVER give up, so adamant it's inspiring.
764258508493717506 2016-08-12 00:33:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> They'd have to make a plan, gather resources, and build it and they do it all in hours. Or TR has a storage full of mechs. That's possible.
764257844367495168 2016-08-12 00:30:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Team Rocket trio may be some of the greatest inventors ever, not for overall success, but for building their mechs in record time.

763915486564188160 2016-08-11 01:50:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Almost 164 total hours and I have conquered Persona Q. Definitely one of my favorite 3DS titles! Now onwards to the next challenge! >:D

763909852519215105 2016-08-11 01:27:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't see how that would be sarcasm as, on the English site, Alolan variants are considered new Pokmon, not prev. disc.

763892272857423872 2016-08-11 00:18:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Potentially, of course. We'll just have to wait and see what Team Skull's ultimate goal is.

763891425872257024 2016-08-11 00:14:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I get that the examples I mentioned were to show the villains treat Pokmon, now matter how powerful, as tools, but this makes for a
763891112142475264 2016-08-11 00:13:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> chance feel like daunting deities of power in a way similar to how Ho-oh and Lugia were, but with potentially more focus than them
763890858756153344 2016-08-11 00:12:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> and the mortality duo were batteries for a nuke. I like the concept of Skull not getting involved with the legendaries cuz it give them a

763888266919620608 2016-08-11 00:02:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Main thing I meant about this is that, in thinking about it, legends that aren't in RBYGSC are glorified tools. Kyogre/Groudon are basically
763887422153175042 2016-08-11 23:58:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thing is tho, I know it's possible, I know I can do it. It's gonna take a lot to do and that excites me, love games that push me like this!
763886817288466432 2016-08-11 23:56:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> P4G's bonus boss is one of the hardest bosses I've ever faced. They saw that and thought "hey can we make a harder fight" "oh yeah. we can"
763886350965673984 2016-08-11 23:54:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Utterly destroyed. Annihilated. Didn't even finish a third of the fight. Atlus doesn't make 'em easy. Oh no no no.
763885751176011776 2016-08-11 23:52:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Bag full of two playthrough's worth of the best items I've been saving for this one fight, I'm ready, LET'S DO THIS!!"  I got destroyed.
763885565624266752 2016-08-11 23:51:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> "I'll train my team to the 90s, assemble the strongest Personas in the game, best weapons, armor, & accessories, I even have a game plan"
763885102237483010 2016-08-11 23:49:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Oh man I'm SO excited to take on Persona Q's bonus boss fight. A fight so intense you have to beat the game *twice* just to get the chance"
763822857969283073 2016-08-11 19:42:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is seriously terrible to wait until now to announce, not to mentioned crippling the hype of the game's 20thhttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/763786002657927169

763786882006196224 2016-08-11 17:19:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like Team Rocket in both gene didn't get involved with legends, Skill seem to fit a local gang motif so this could be something similar
763786656251994112 2016-08-11 17:18:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thinking about how lackluster Team Skull are made me think "these guys will summon the legends?!" BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T
763785597739687936 2016-08-11 17:14:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> Most recognizable in the intro but some in the middle too!

763490437982216192 2016-08-10 21:41:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I, of course, can't control what you tweet, so if you wish to discuss leaks, give a heads up so people know to mute you or whatever
763489206517792768 2016-08-10 21:36:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby That's fine, thanks for the heads up! :)
763487397443203072 2016-08-10 21:29:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you wanna talk about them with some people, that's fine, but do so privately so that others don't have to see it
763487318082805760 2016-08-10 21:28:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> General PSA: don't spread leaks. Don't retweet them, don't spread them so openly. Just don't. It's not cool, k?

763381253215178753 2016-08-10 14:27:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby That is weird to imagine. After reappearing in the past two sequels you'd think it's a given they'd return again
763380910649552896 2016-08-10 14:26:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Huh? People thought one of the original 12 wasn't gonna come back?
763378851892240384 2016-08-10 14:17:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator This goes into more detail, and it's exactly how the old one worked.https://twitter.com/PokemonGoNews/status/763268754302234624
763378598270996480 2016-08-10 14:16:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @VRator It's basically the same as the "old" tracking system, just without footsteps.

763008282013249537 2016-08-09 13:45:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Despite the Corocoro leaks, the most surprising news I learned this morning is that Europe is getting Persona 5 the same time US does!!
762835677700509700 2016-08-08 02:19:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me at the grocery store earlier, seeing magazine articles: Man these tabloid magazine titles are so clickbaity. ... Wait.

762102462358491136 2016-08-06 01:46:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> So there's a bus that takes me to another bus stop but it's like a 30 min wait max for a 5 min bus ride to the 2nd stop, so I've decided to
762039982684934144 2016-08-06 21:37:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like a forest or an ocean or a cave that's on fire. Always.  Well that's what it feels like outside right now, anyway
762039803822997504 2016-08-06 21:37:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Whenever I become a video game developer, instead of a volcano being the fire themed area it'll just be like a place that's always on fire

761731516523175936 2016-08-05 01:12:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> bad as ignoring the person in need of support basically and I hate that as well.
761731432209186816 2016-08-05 01:11:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because of this, I sometimes don't even try in fear of sounding too generic/just saying something to save face but not saying anything is as

760217776850018304 2016-08-01 20:56:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> They still exist, just not in Alola. These 'mons have adapted and changed drastically to Alola's different microclimates

760129394228604928 2016-08-01 15:05:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> With all this hype and such I really hope I enjoy Sun/Moon. A basic thing to hope for I know but I really want this to greatly exceed Gen VI
760121013518467072 2016-08-01 14:32:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> NONONONONO
760118622937161728 2016-08-01 14:22:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SuperDanielM8 The answer to both is: we're not sure yet
760114592185921536 2016-08-01 14:06:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> No mention of gyms, ever. We'll just have to wait and see
760112418953437185 2016-08-01 13:58:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hopefully, anyway
760112390390231040 2016-08-01 13:58:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> On Pok Ride: "These Pokmon don't join your team, but you can call on them anytime to receive their help." ANYTIME FRIENDS ANY TIME NO HMS
760109724037545984 2016-08-01 13:47:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Remember to never believe anything until it's officially confirmed. imo, the safest way to go about things
760103730037395456 2016-08-01 13:23:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sylvaur @sami_spoon No starter evos were shown
760099413880483840 2016-08-01 13:06:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> After being eh for a while about these announcements, this one was pretty interesting
759955619335987204 2016-07-31 03:35:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Still don't see the problem here. If you have a strong will, you'll live. ;P The rest will be a challenge tho.
759955163431903232 2016-07-31 03:33:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't see a problem here. Just stay up all night, by the time it's 6 you'll be awake anyway! ;P
759886855684759553 2016-07-31 23:01:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Clefairy hung around the whole time, watching on, seems suspicious. Perhaps this was according to plan?! :O
759809889283682304 2016-07-31 17:56:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't see PV returning tbh since it violates ToS. Unless they want legal trouble with Niantic, & neither party wants that
759793706656407557 2016-07-31 16:51:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Ah okay.
759792856223526918 2016-07-31 16:48:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby You can still enjoy the game via PokeVision yes, but that's not the way Niantic wants
759792825315659776 2016-07-31 16:48:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I mainly meant how the devs wanted the game to be enjoyed, and I'm sure devs don't intend on adding enjoyment via glitches.
759740450462797824 2016-07-31 13:20:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> It may be frustrating to find Pokmon now but that doesn't change the fact the site partially ruined how the game was meant to be enjoyed.
759738863652708352 2016-07-31 13:13:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yes tracking was busted but of course they're working on it. And the tracking had u wander to find them, not know their exact location
759738043699908609 2016-07-31 13:10:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> People are really this upset about Niantic not liking PokVision? It was a violation of ToS and wasn't how the game was meant to be played
759627038177185792 2016-07-30 05:49:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @kyleenim Possible, but it seems like the Pokevision were fine with taking it down themselves http://www.techinsider.io/creator-of-pokemon-go-on-pokevision-cheating-in-the-game-2016-7
759584710271967233 2016-07-30 03:01:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Prolly so they can work on fixing it without having a mostly dead feature on the game. It's confusing UI leaving it there.
759584449709285378 2016-07-30 03:00:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> deal with it then
759584411025158145 2016-07-30 03:00:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also, the game may update in the future and not fix the changes you have issues with, but add better things, you'll have to
759584273099726849 2016-07-30 02:59:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Either way, tho the changes aren't favorable, I still don't think it's enough to not get an update to the game.
759584153020923904 2016-07-30 02:59:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> The tracking still didn't work like originally intended. As for running away, that's a little odd, can't really argue with.
759582461571375104 2016-07-30 02:52:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> They made 'mons harder to catch and removed a feature that didn't even work, I don't see much of a problem here.
759548205897949184 2016-07-30 00:36:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl Oh they definitely will, it's just a matter of when. Removing it removes confusion and possible hope that it'll work
759545980656062464 2016-07-30 00:27:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> in that specific regard
759545860418002948 2016-07-30 00:26:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find it funny people are complaining about the latest GO update removing a *broken* feature. Functionally, the game is no different
759403336583917568 2016-07-30 15:00:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wrote this late last night, it's kinda really important :P
759249741154754564 2016-07-29 04:50:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know that's kinda vague, seemingly out of nowhere and maybe a little clich, but it's the truth.
759249070858899457 2016-07-29 04:47:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Remember you are never alone! If you need help, reach out to people and someone will help you! We can get through life together!!
759182705338621952 2016-07-29 00:23:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> WORTH THO
759086519692898304 2016-07-29 18:01:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I dunno if this was the *first* thing you thought of when you read that but I'll definitely pretend it was.
759086326259982336 2016-07-29 18:00:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Twitch wittzLonk
758870662467325953 2016-07-28 03:43:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah we'll just see what happens and what our country will do about it. If they do anything that is
758869483607855105 2016-07-28 03:39:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Means anything immediately threatening at least
758869407665750016 2016-07-28 03:39:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Because of that, some people don't think it means anything, that's my guess tho
758869236081057792 2016-07-28 03:38:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't pay attention to stuff like this, but iirc, they basically have done this before and nothing really happened
758867410950598656 2016-07-28 03:31:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls He is a villain, and a murderer, so yes
758808940326948864 2016-07-28 23:38:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT hey look that's where my next paycheck is going hahaha XD
758379475667079168 2016-07-27 19:12:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MasaeAnela It's hilarious how this happens *every time* you head to a con
758291631518851072 2016-07-27 13:23:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's all about having fun in the end, so it's fine!
758281556070838272 2016-07-27 12:43:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite things in Family Feud is when a contestant says a dumb answer but they clap and proclaim "Good answer!", so confident
757799778289790976 2016-07-25 04:48:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been watching clips of Family Feud for the past hour...how come no one told me this show was hilarious???
757695331005890560 2016-07-25 21:53:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Now back to your regularly scheduled "so unfunny, it's hilarious he's still trying" jokes from yours truly; P
757694981507194881 2016-07-25 21:52:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's not hot anymore and I'm not that funny anyway, so Silver Scizor's Hottest Tweets (trademark rejected) has now concluded
757654628200624128 2016-07-25 19:11:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> The universe tries to do the same with Texas every summer by forgoing the coal mine and just lighting the state on fire with its sheer heat
757654373090467840 2016-07-25 19:10:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Centralia, Pennsylvania is a near ghost town because the coal mine underneath the town's borough has been on fire since 1962
757653665595424769 2016-07-25 19:08:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> They later became a pyrotechnic. *Disclaimer: this fact is neither fun nor factual
757653432303923200 2016-07-25 19:07:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Fun Fact*: The idea for burning lasers came around when a Texan child with a magnifying glass start burning holes into their house
757652588292476928 2016-07-25 19:03:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> On break at work and it's still hot outside  Time for more of Silver Scizor's Hottest Tweets (trademark pending)
757454806466256896 2016-07-24 05:57:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xANtVgWV9jw
757340090645356544 2016-07-24 22:22:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nishisuura The show it's from is also pretty great! But yeah the versatility is great too
757338850582605826 2016-07-24 22:17:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nishisuura I will always love this gif
757271097154768896 2016-07-24 17:47:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain You have my support! :)
757270647605047297 2016-07-24 17:46:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie GO tracks distance traveled, not steps taken, unless you have a house sized treadmill, then no it won't work :P
757042254812884992 2016-07-23 02:38:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's not a glitch. IT'S THE V O I D
756969605529075712 2016-07-23 21:49:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not all of my jokes make it to your timeline btw; they all go through intense humor evaluation to make sure you get the least mediocre ones!
756968861036011520 2016-07-23 21:46:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I love Pocket Monster Monsters!
756968469308899328 2016-07-23 21:45:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> On the other, somewhat contradictory hand tho, if you're looking for a significant other, come to Texas! Everyone here is really hot!!
756967937483771904 2016-07-23 21:43:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> PSA: Never use/fall for the "is is hot out here or is it just you" pickup line in Texas, as it's rhetorical; yes, it is hot out here
756929795309510656 2016-07-23 19:11:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> PSA: Please don't leave your mixtapes lying around outside, especially if they are as fire as u say they are cuz it feels like fire outside
756928230393688064 2016-07-23 19:05:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> I find an odd amount of amusement knowing that over half a million people bought a VCR last yearhttps://twitter.com/marksluckie/status/756133672739307520
756861328363495424 2016-07-23 14:39:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> *incessant buzzing noise*
756860959755345920 2016-07-23 14:38:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> The Crush 40 concert was pretty cool, but the rest, from the bit I saw and from what I read from others, was a great big mess haha
756718582688468992 2016-07-22 05:12:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> But really, that trailer really didn't show anything other than the fact that Classic Sonic is back again, really keeping classic around
756718396910149633 2016-07-22 05:11:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> "From the team that brought you Colors and Generations" My interpretation: remember the only games you guys thought were good in past decade
756693443426955264 2016-07-22 03:32:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Big thanks to Crush 40 for *rocking the place*" I really really hope that was intentional
756692854718685184 2016-07-22 03:30:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Stuck around longer and tweeted a lot more than I thought I would about this Sonic event, That concert was pretty fun
756691168394555393 2016-07-22 03:23:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> I respect their honesty
756691081345904640 2016-07-22 03:23:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> THE PALACE THAT WAS FOUND I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT WAS CRUSH 40 BUT I D O N ' T C A R E
756690441546989574 2016-07-22 03:20:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> Though brief, the buzzing actually came back, tbh I'm impressed
756689630188142593 2016-07-22 03:17:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> HE ACTUALLY WENT FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR! THIS GUY THO
756689472587051008 2016-07-22 03:16:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also no one plays you for not playing  06 cuz it was 06 haha
756689339581620224 2016-07-22 03:16:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I mean it's fine, not everyone knows all songs and what games their from, I just like to know those things cuz I love VGM :P
756689021296713728 2016-07-22 03:14:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> "All Hail Shadow" is actually Shadow's theme from Sonic 06, the prior two were from his game
756688664806068224 2016-07-22 03:13:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> The more this concert goes on, the more I want them to play "The Palace That Was Found" cuz it would just be great. Like, hilariously so
756686147124813824 2016-07-22 03:03:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> THE E D G E
756685765803769856 2016-07-22 03:01:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nothing wrong with Crush 40 having original songs, but why play non-Sonic songs at a Sonic event/concert???
756685599784988672 2016-07-22 03:01:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls Yes
756685122502430720 2016-07-22 02:59:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm still impressed no one talks about the Sonic game where he had a talking sword. Like is it really that unnotable? :P
756684666564861952 2016-07-22 02:57:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls Unless you meant the game, in which case yes
756684594427015170 2016-07-22 02:57:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls listen
756684469533376512 2016-07-22 02:56:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls
756684418719166464 2016-07-22 02:56:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Knight of the Wind" from Sonic and the Black Knight
756684194042945536 2016-07-22 02:55:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Oh, that's an odd choice?
756683560979951617 2016-07-22 02:53:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby What even is it from, I didn't recognize the past two at first but I'm completely lost here XD
756683433443680256 2016-07-22 02:52:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Where's Hunnid P droppin' "Unknown From M. E.",(SA1) but with the most of the lyrics replaced with "Knuckles"
756681782729150464 2016-07-22 02:46:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder how many people have actually heard the Crush 40 cover of His World, cuz it's pretty good, better than the original imo
756681367774048256 2016-07-22 02:44:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> it's gotta go fest
756681261536710657 2016-07-22 02:44:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm so glad I stuck around for this concert, it's not perfect, but Crush 40 makes some good stuff, really digging it! #Sonic25th
756680669183381504 2016-07-22 02:41:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I couldn't help it but I'm also sorry
756680532973400064 2016-07-22 02:41:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> "What's that BUSZZZ;SDLFKAJS;LDFJ? THAT'S THE SOUND OF 25 YEARS OF SONIC" THAT TIMING WAS IMPECCABLE
756680391759532032 2016-07-22 02:40:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxfRg0HyDKQ
756680086535958529 2016-07-22 02:39:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls I KNOW RIGHT?
756678860272349184 2016-07-22 02:34:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was about to joke about liking the instrumental of "City Escape", but I legitimately do! XD #Sonic25th
756677329049440260 2016-07-22 02:28:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> Aaaand spoke too soon, even if it was only for a second XD #Sonic25th
756677193233633280 2016-07-22 02:27:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Okay if the audio can hold it's own, genuinely hyped for Jun Senoue, Crush 40's work is pretty great
756674853869064196 2016-07-22 02:18:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Amazing, the audio could only hold on long enough for the trailer to play before crashing down again...and they're just playing it again???
756673718672355328 2016-07-22 02:14:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> When the audio cuts out on the (potential) buildup to the big reveal. ...starting of strong, blue blur XD #Sonic25th
756672972954431489 2016-07-22 02:11:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> That 5 seconds of the Generations remix of Big Arms has been the best part of the stream I've seen imo hahaha #Sonic25th
756672050316574721 2016-07-22 02:07:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just tuned in, and I apparently missed the chaos (no pun intended, oddly) XD But the audio is having issues so that's fun?
756671755465273344 2016-07-22 02:06:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP #Sonic25th
756475799469891584 2016-07-22 13:07:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> You would
756345864084348928 2016-07-21 04:31:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wow I didn't even notice that. Not a single one. We only know the name of Melemele Island, not even anything else
756340738158231552 2016-07-21 04:10:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Also new 'mons are cool and all, but I also just wanna see more than that, since the game is more than just the 'mons you can catch
756340613717471236 2016-07-21 04:10:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> It was cool for a while but I've really had enough, don't wanna see a third or fourth of the 'dex before launch
756340456674308100 2016-07-21 04:09:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh I hope this is like sneak peek at the villainous teams or just not new 'monshttps://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/756338402878955524
756200899408572416 2016-07-21 18:55:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy 16th birthday to Mario Tennis and, of course, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!pic.twitter.com/KtUapvjy41

755899109798576128 2016-07-20 22:56:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> And I mean that in both meanings of the ownable "records"
755899002537639936 2016-07-20 22:55:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder who has the record for owning the most records and I really hope they got a record for that.
755898305331073024 2016-07-20 22:52:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> 1. Nothing wrong about being "late" 2. It's never too late. 3. You good girl!
755837051925258240 2016-07-20 18:49:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Who says it uses its wings to fly? Where there's a will, there's a way.
755635660862722048 2016-07-19 05:29:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> A guy with warrants on him went *to the police station* cuz GO told him there was a gym there ahahahahahahaha http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/oakland-county/man-playing-pokemon-go-wanders-into-police-station-arrested-on-outstanding-warrant

755491563791196160 2016-07-19 19:56:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Plus tax? :O
755439920919961600 2016-07-19 16:31:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby It could just be a different "portrayal" And they're not animal equivalents, just based off of them
755406295960723456 2016-07-19 14:17:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> According to the site, Alola has signs warning of Bewear's strength. If they don't say something to the effect of "Beware of Bewear"...
755395653899919361 2016-07-19 13:35:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon eligibility, battle format, time limits, and it looks like we can even battle with 'mons straight out of Pokmon Bank!
755395413516050434 2016-07-19 13:34:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> With the Pokmon Global Link, we'll be able to host our own Friendly Competitions, with lots to customize!pic.twitter.com/ESpJNeRmua

755081882132291584 2016-07-18 16:48:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> this is honestly the best way I've seen anything promoted, ever. It's wonderful, and can't wait to play Persona 5!
755081310251524097 2016-07-18 16:46:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> The way hype has built for Persona 5 has been incredible and it's not even over yet. From events at Japanese landmarks to amazing trailers-

755038525968437248 2016-07-18 13:56:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> this morning*
755038396049862656 2016-07-18 13:55:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> No matter what's revealed at the #P5 event this, some of the best parts are referring to Morgan Freeman and this picpic.twitter.com/M2pmwWy664
755022905524707328 2016-07-18 12:54:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> And, even though I forgot about and missed 15 min, the Persona 5 event this morning made up for that! Good morning everyone! ^_^
755022593527193602 2016-07-18 12:53:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Woke up, thought I was late, checked the time and it was 7:29, one min till alarm...which went off 3 sec later, what a troll -_-
754904323839012864 2016-07-17 05:03:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @donnabellez Can't get legendaries outside of events, but Kabuto, a fossil Pokmon, is pretty rare, so that's a nice find!

754774789026226177 2016-07-17 20:28:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Of course first big #PokemonGO trip with a friend is when servers are down I really hope they're more stable in the future even with new-
754392164612714496 2016-07-16 19:08:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I, too, would like to know where the lamp is
754391889877479424 2016-07-16 19:06:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> The fire department comes by where I work daily to shop but I think it's to make sure the building doesn't ignite due to how hot it is
754341621735432192 2016-07-16 15:47:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen recent overload. But at this point it's down either way so it doesn't make *that* much of a difference
754341482685800450 2016-07-16 15:46:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen A hacker group "claimed" they DDOS'd, but at the same time it launches in many other countries? Could be-
754338678013517825 2016-07-16 15:35:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen No I highly doubt that's true, the game just launched in a few countries so that's it I'm pretty sure
754338538376671232 2016-07-16 15:34:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man everyone and their dog's kitchen sink had GO plans today, rip everyone's dreams
754319433766543362 2016-07-16 14:19:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> I couldn't get past the load screen this morning
754161879124152320 2016-07-15 03:52:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @4reel17 Sounds like that's been a recent glitch, I read other people having a similar issue
754161466593325056 2016-07-15 03:51:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> I need to learn to not take on tough fights and save every 5 min >.>
754161020566777856 2016-07-15 03:49:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Playing TMS, encounter with a stronger than normal enemy? OH I CAN HANDLE IT ONE TURN LATER NO I CAN'T GAME OVER A;SLDFKJA;SLDFKJ
754138225413808128 2016-07-15 02:18:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I doubt it tbh, but we'll need solid numbers to see
754134996453949440 2016-07-15 02:06:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> MARK YOUR EMAILS AS READ PLEASE IT'S BOTHERING ME SO MUCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH *twitches*
754019396574515200 2016-07-15 18:26:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon OLD! OLD! OLD!
754019161374720000 2016-07-15 18:25:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Hmm, let's see how old man you really are. How do you feel about bingo? ;P
753803467920056320 2016-07-14 04:08:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Oh yeah, I forgot that exists
753705205137498112 2016-07-14 21:38:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I haven't found a single Fire type in #PokemonGO and that's really inaccurate in Texas tbh cuz it's basically literally on fire out here
753588561056718848 2016-07-14 13:54:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> That just may be a glitch, while Tailsy literally doesn't have GPS
753587898528563201 2016-07-14 13:52:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Your tablet may have GPS, while @Tai1sy's doesn't
753094576236335104 2016-07-12 05:11:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I cannot get enough of this theme, it's sooooo jammin' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zs4iDaU6do
753060801569656832 2016-07-12 02:57:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hi still here I'm... bad at making good jokes ;P
753044943388553216 2016-07-12 01:54:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @PinkSeaVillage Can relate. On a walk? Doduo, Rattata etc. In the car where I can't walk around? Scyther, Pinsir, Tauros ;~;
753036976903720960 2016-07-12 01:23:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Me last week: Pokmon GO? Eh. I think it'll be alright, not thinking much of it Me today: Time to further integrate GO into my daily life.
752870194398179330 2016-07-12 14:20:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie "poppin" there's a Popplio joke in there somewhere But yeah I wonder what percentage of the new 'mons we'll know before launch
752718916305063936 2016-07-11 04:19:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> I really like the old Dragon Ball fights but man is the padding insane, one powerup scene literally took like 10 min, not even exaggerating
752717227258843138 2016-07-11 04:12:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Guys @sharaths228 and I figured it out!pic.twitter.com/jhOvRzqbhV
752662480174784512 2016-07-11 00:34:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is an actual text box from TMS #FE Really liking this game so far hahahapic.twitter.com/MscLmdKdlK
752634794710708224 2016-07-11 22:44:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> How has the Paper Mario series never made a "it looked/sounded good on paper" joke??? It looks pretty good on paper.
752502397595885568 2016-07-11 13:58:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> #PokemonGO really makes the walk and bus ride to work fun, caught 7 Pokmon! :D
752327993951870977 2016-07-10 02:25:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie We have those too, but just...a lot of Doduo. A lot.
752327665365839872 2016-07-10 02:24:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Seven_Cubed That's three heads, we got a Dodrio now, sweet!
752327180760125440 2016-07-10 02:22:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie But hey, at least we Texans have Doduo... ... ...right? D:
752325921302949888 2016-07-10 02:17:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Also: the fact that I caught a wild Pidgeot and @JoeHearthstone once found a nearby Venusaur implies you could catch a Dragonite
752325679589363712 2016-07-10 02:16:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Beats me, the rarest 'mon I've found is a Pidgeot :P
752325584697462784 2016-07-10 02:16:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Also think of it this way, the rarer the 'mon, the more arduous and work required, right? Just like in the main games!
752325457245196288 2016-07-10 02:15:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Determined and lucky people. Also some people already have a Dragonite
752316197920661506 2016-07-10 01:38:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love what this game is doing
752004022496686080 2016-07-09 04:58:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Those who skipped TMS #FE cuz of censorship are really missing out on a fun game for a dumb reason hahaha
751958712500105216 2016-07-09 01:58:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> the job done. In my SS Nuzlocke, Ledian was one such 'mon, Audino in my W -locke as well!
751958501170114560 2016-07-09 01:57:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of my favorite things about Nuzlockes: discovering how good some 'mons can be. They don't have to be the best, just get
751822003665985537 2016-07-09 16:55:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen I believe it tracks the distance you travel, not necessarily the steps you take.
751611603829809152 2016-07-08 02:59:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm such a fool why have I never dressed as Pepsiman for Halloween before. Shouldn't be too hard
751609509898891264 2016-07-08 02:50:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not even watching SGDQ, but that won't stop me. PEPSIMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z54MpfR3XE4
751595187273539584 2016-07-08 01:53:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nishisuura The main team actually planned for a sequel, even though they wrapped it up perfectly, prolly will fall to sequelitis D:
751574117371899904 2016-07-08 00:30:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> awareness bump too: return of the revenge
751566715163521024 2016-07-08 00:00:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for why it keeps crashing your game, I'm not at all sure, sorry but I can't help you there
751566482740420608 2016-07-08 23:59:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Kinda looks like a variable in coding. It basically checks if your avatar has already been created or not, just guessing
751564158584254464 2016-07-08 23:50:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nope, prolly froze
751557255804260352 2016-07-08 23:23:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Gonna share this FAQ page on GO, some helpful info (stuff the game should've given but didn't) is here: https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us
751507631760629765 2016-07-08 20:05:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> If only I had both, that would be the true combo :O
751507508934631428 2016-07-08 20:05:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> I remembered I once had popcorn with garlic butter and it was amazing, just had some with garlic salt and it was also amazing
751430833370636288 2016-07-08 15:00:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> bumping for awareness

751198021589708800 2016-07-07 23:35:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why would you expect to find Nemo in a movie about Dory?
751190084414693376 2016-07-07 23:04:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah, that's rough, hope you get to enjoy it eventually!

751122268231639040 2016-07-07 18:34:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I used to hate it but now I much prefer it over slots! Takes some time and thinking, but it's a fun challenge! :D

751060570862809088 2016-07-07 14:29:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I can just feel it, today's gonna be a wonderful day. Not for any specific reason. Nope. None at all. Not a single one.
750862283404783616 2016-07-06 01:21:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> This whole release has been...weird. I'm sure you'll get soon, tomorrow morning if not this evening it should be out 4 all
750861699654176768 2016-07-06 01:19:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Welp got Squirtle in GO, time to not touch it until my dog walk tomorrow morning :P
750861526412566528 2016-07-06 01:18:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> When it shows up, it'll be at the very top of the list, it's not up for you yet, which is odd, hope you get it soon
750853832624582657 2016-07-06 00:47:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Now that's weird, cuz we live in the same state. This whole release is just weird
750853356583686144 2016-07-06 00:46:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Alrighty then, I only heard "it was live", I didn't get any specifics, sorry to get your hopes up D:
750853047497027584 2016-07-06 00:44:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> I got it on Android, not sure about iOS, sorry
750852274046459908 2016-07-06 00:41:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 In America, at least
750852219927339008 2016-07-06 00:41:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> btw Pokmon GO is live, if you're unaware
750768638315991040 2016-07-06 19:09:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Level of pride for @Nomppie_____  Normal level of pride _____  Level of pride for @Seven_Cubed after saying "proudness"_____
750521904390221824 2016-07-05 02:49:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore When it comes to making typos, @CheeseyPokemon is innovative, tbh I'm impressed
749843964233080832 2016-07-03 05:55:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @4reel17 We should find other ways to rest then, so we can get more done! >:D
749842958166269952 2016-07-03 05:51:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Why have they been slacking? Cuz they have to take time to sleep! We, both scientists and everyone else, could benefit so much w/o it
749842142407778304 2016-07-03 05:47:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> Come to think of it, all these years of science advancement and we still have to sleep daily?  Scientists have been slacking
749840291583045632 2016-07-03 05:40:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Still think sleep is an annoyance; still want to do a bunch of stuff but nope, let's do nothing for 7-8 hours. >.> Night everyone!
749815742321745921 2016-07-03 04:02:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wha?! Wh-wh-why?!
749718470879645696 2016-07-03 21:36:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon "in too deep" (   )
749107402000048128 2016-07-01 05:08:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls That's the joke tho, they could've done more with it tho
749106620479647744 2016-07-01 05:05:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls I'm surprised and disappointed in myself that I remember this, but they actually do address it iirc
749106434567122946 2016-07-01 05:04:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hope you guys have a good night!pic.twitter.com/gD0BnA7Jni
749094365201440769 2016-07-01 04:16:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> At this point it's just too much of a hassle to keep trying. I hate giving up, but realistically I just have to move on
749094224868446208 2016-07-01 04:15:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> My old PS2 collection might not ever be played again, they'll just be fond memories forever
749084666217369601 2016-07-01 03:37:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was really looking forward to playing a ton of Ultimax but now I'll have to wait on that even more. That definitely killed my evening
749084494066380800 2016-07-01 03:37:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> t isn't backwards compatible. Which means I'll only play like one or two games on it. Ugh
749084084324880384 2016-07-01 03:35:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'll have to try to reflow it again just to get the disc out, but I'm tired of dealing with this crap, I'll just have to get a newer one tha
749083829848059904 2016-07-01 03:34:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> And the PS3 I reflowed last week died again, barely got an hour in with Ultimax. Of freaking couirse
749071527165865984 2016-07-01 02:45:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> What have you guys been playing lately? In addition to Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, I'll be at this for a while :Dpic.twitter.com/WsFMN4SKDb
749066644329144323 2016-07-01 02:26:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Okay...WHAT?! DO THEY USE THEIR BRAINS?! ??????
749065982035914752 2016-07-01 02:23:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's like, basically the entire point of the contest??? Like, did they think about that???
749065156357869568 2016-07-01 02:20:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> People need to like get...smart? Common sense? Chill out? I dunno they need something
749064486380670976 2016-07-01 02:17:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just looked up stuff about it and it seems like an awesome idea to me, what's there to complain about?
749063231910490112 2016-07-01 02:12:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> What thing?
749023031213690880 2016-07-01 23:33:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MasaeAnela Eeveelutions!

748876996151635968 2016-07-01 13:52:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> Use of the word "strike" instead of "act first" makes me think this only affects damaging priority & not like Protecpic.twitter.com/tdDanuay7R
748860059090718720 2016-07-01 12:45:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh yeah, I was wondering what happened to that.
748739334350659584 2016-06-30 04:45:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if the reason enemies exploding in Mario RPGs is the in-universe way of disposing the corpses. This is what I think about.
748732829886853120 2016-06-30 04:19:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> When you think the phrase "I don't have to kill you, but I'll do so for the sake of doing so" in an RPG, it's time to question your ethics
748706104985554944 2016-06-30 02:33:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just finished the live action Death Note drama and I really enjoyed it, especially the differences from the anime.
748689967581261824 2016-06-30 01:29:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sorry to hear that. Sending lots of love your way, my sincere condolences

748515892258971649 2016-06-30 13:57:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> Being an "island's guardian deity", it could be legendary, but I'm not sure and that's just speculation at that point :P
748515499965706240 2016-06-30 13:56:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> The first 'mon in the new trailer, Tapu Koko, was referenced in the E3 demo, and it seems like we meet it early onpic.twitter.com/M2KtSlLgJp
748346092006236164 2016-06-29 02:43:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain I'm not sure there's a way to do that, but blocking multiple bots is only a slight inconvenience
748344974949769216 2016-06-29 02:38:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain You could block it
748319332904505344 2016-06-29 00:56:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> would watch
748318949742256129 2016-06-29 00:55:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey just watch social eating could be the next e-sport
748294932830400512 2016-06-29 23:19:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> He apparently went uncredited, most likely to contractual complications, but yeah his was not a name I ever expected to see
748292770754789376 2016-06-29 23:11:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 If you're curious for details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3#Michael_Jackson.27s_involvement
748292657605029888 2016-06-29 23:10:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I was looking for who composed the Big Arm theme in Sonic 3 and...wait...is that...HUH?!pic.twitter.com/2cJAUHaiVi

748221825448976385 2016-06-29 18:29:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Not a lot of feelings are more sad than reaching for a bite of cake then seeing that it's all gone. D:
747909834901643267 2016-06-28 21:49:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I often forget the 3DS has 3D, despite it literally being 2/3 of the name
747818737860894721 2016-06-28 15:47:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yet another look into Luigi's true thoughts...he's an interesting one XD
747818574450831360 2016-06-28 15:46:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> "What do you mean there's no such thing as a safe place in this terrifying world?" -Toadette in response to what LUIGI said in Paper Jam.

747282137418604544 2016-06-26 04:15:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles Top middle and top right are my faves! :3
747258685261393920 2016-06-26 02:42:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> Eh, I'll let you have this one ;P Also, when's the show?
747258090018344960 2016-06-26 02:39:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man, what genius, someone should pay you for this brilliant idea! :O
747204022881267713 2016-06-26 23:04:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy birthday to everyone's favorite wheel of cheese: @CheeseyPokemon! Hope you've been having a great day! Stay awesome, friend! M3 <#
746770047549349888 2016-06-25 18:20:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects No need to apologize, hope you have a very relaxing day! :D
746730759763832832 2016-06-25 15:44:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeWeebles OH NO NONONONO
746522523337003008 2016-06-24 01:56:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> *I say, Amazon purchase screen open in another tab*
746522338133319681 2016-06-24 01:56:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> Since I've had a job and actually get an income, I've been kinda purchase happy, gotta be careful and control that, hahaha
746506464932487169 2016-06-24 00:53:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Update: it worked at least once, which I'm happy about, if only I could know how long this'll last. Buying the heck outta Ultimax now tho
746220390314172420 2016-06-23 05:56:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anyway I'm off to bed, good night friends! :D
746220211871748097 2016-06-23 05:55:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> it out for another 18 hours cuz of work. Needless to say, this took a LOT longer than I thought it would, hopefully it works out in the end
746220029050396672 2016-06-23 05:54:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Almost 9 hours later, I finally finished disassembling, reflowing the motherboard of, and reassembling my PS3, and I don't even get to test
746150294862475264 2016-06-23 01:17:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon @CheeseyPokemon Hahaha, beat me to it XD Anyway, have fun (   )
746010274663043072 2016-06-23 16:01:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah, so that's what that sound was ;P
745403438473715712 2016-06-21 23:50:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...man I'm obsessed.  I mean I knew that, but this makes me look at it in a different way, hahaha
745403262216478725 2016-06-21 23:49:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> I saw an expiration date for Jan 31 2017 and my first thought was "Wow this could expire and Persona 5 still wouldn't be out yet!
745372684003868673 2016-06-21 21:47:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie THAT WAS AWESOME  I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS WHY DIDN'T WE GET THIS?!?
744759635643535362 2016-06-19 05:11:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey guys? You're cool! Have a good night! :D
744634671925862400 2016-06-19 20:55:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> I didn't think much of this returning at first but after seeing what it was like I'm excited for what it can be nowhttps://twitter.com/grandmarth/status/742764080382025730
744290851128434688 2016-06-18 22:09:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain Sometimes it's better to keep quiet, cuz man do I know that feeling -_-
743617940839227393 2016-06-16 01:35:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Interesting coincidence I was discussing potential new Mario in the works today then this shows up :Phttps://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/743617255624302593
743532692201824256 2016-06-16 19:56:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Over the course of this year and next I'll prolly pick up later installments, excited for what greatness that will bring! :D
743532442737205252 2016-06-16 19:55:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished Trials & Tribulations. Wow. Fantastic. Love this trilogy, and can see why many people love this franchise, I'm hooked and then some
743499695964643332 2016-06-16 17:45:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @Seven_Cubed If a 'mon enters the field midturn, they take double damage. After a switch or U-turn, etc.
743495514973315072 2016-06-16 17:28:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> While that may seem obvious, this observation also makes me think there isn't another one planned for Wii U, which is interesting I guess
743495305048424448 2016-06-16 17:27:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's been 2.5 years since the last 3D Mario game and the fact that none was shown at this E3 makes me think one for NX is in the works
743283028709900293 2016-06-15 03:24:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> From what I saw of some of the dialogue, it had some funny lines, imo at least :P
743278733830684673 2016-06-15 03:07:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Update: @JoeHearthstone killed a spider, @CheeseyPokemon, and by extension, Santa, is Satan, it's high noon, & there'll be a spider funeral
743273884774862848 2016-06-15 02:47:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you're not in Renae's Discord server, you're missing out on...this beautiful chaos.pic.twitter.com/FWEVFlpf9G
743211203741179906 2016-06-15 22:38:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how they play around with the paper aesthetic in Color Splash, probably the most creative use of it yet! #E32016
743205625081929728 2016-06-15 22:16:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I seem to be the only one who hasn't written off Color Splash yet. I don't think it's perfect, but I'm willing to give it a chance
743192052565958656 2016-06-15 21:22:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> The accuracy tho renaePetchpic.twitter.com/ii1CAeu07W
743188929252188161 2016-06-15 21:10:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects The spider wasn't shiny tho dang imagine the luck :O
743163177702043649 2016-06-15 19:28:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> The new Mario Party looks pretty fun, if they're other modes and boards, I feel it'll be a really solid MP! :D
743161914054713344 2016-06-15 19:23:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YFYGuy Cuz this is just one mode
743144141824024577 2016-06-15 18:12:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> people need to chill haha
743141173523472388 2016-06-15 18:00:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait people thought the APP was gonna be $35 ...did they pay attention?!
743137470078812160 2016-06-15 17:45:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh I'd get it solely for a bracelet, the fact that I can play the game with it is cool too, I thought it'd just be alerts
743136582245318656 2016-06-15 17:42:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah, it's easy to forget that it's always at work, stuff like that don't come cheap. It also doubles as a cool bracelet :P
743135880676675584 2016-06-15 17:39:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's a tad pricier than I expected, but not really a huge deal at all, seems worth to me, easier to play while I dog walk :P
743134392357249024 2016-06-15 17:33:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon GO Plus seems like will get a release around the end of July, said by Miyamoto himself! #E32016
743114078046982144 2016-06-15 16:12:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YFYGuy Today is GO, new Monster Hunter, new Mario Party (possibly), a new RPG IP, among others, so no more Zelda it seems
743109216089448449 2016-06-15 15:53:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> Excited to see Pokmon GO, TMS#FE, and a brand new 3DS RPG IP today @ Treehouse Live! #E32016
743071644067856384 2016-06-15 13:24:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hmm, it looks like this applies to only digital purchases, if that's a deal breaker to you. I'm kinda eh about it as well, but I save $$$ so
742916920001728513 2016-06-14 03:09:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SnarkyRotomDex The Persona 5 stuff wasn't streamed, but I found some vids and pics people from news sites there took, so I got to see it :D
742829177934487553 2016-06-14 21:20:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> omg why can I do this hahahttps://twitter.com/SilverScizor753/status/742829132023660545
742829132023660545 2016-06-14 21:20:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wait I can retweet my own tweets, hold up
742813959107973125 2016-06-14 20:20:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> ngl I thought he looked like Ganon at first. I then pondered if he was related to the old man from the original :P
742805739387772930 2016-06-14 19:47:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think they'd make note if it they were showing off NX's graphical potential
742805335291760640 2016-06-14 19:46:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Terribly happy?
742805119557738496 2016-06-14 19:45:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yeah when they said no NX @ E3 they meant it :P
742804826992443392 2016-06-14 19:44:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Probably, more likely than not
742804582732992513 2016-06-14 19:43:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wii U
742799401131745281 2016-06-14 19:22:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> E3 always makes me happy, so much cool news and games to get excited for! :D
742795455952617475 2016-06-14 19:06:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Relieve your worries of a Navi, we just have confirmation that Link has *no* partner character for the most part in BotW
742787798172729344 2016-06-14 18:36:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nintendo is having a big sale on tons of games this week! My Nintendo members also get an additional 10% discount! http://e3.nintendo.com/sale/
742785158986637312 2016-06-14 18:25:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> They haven't said yet
742777988438073349 2016-06-14 17:57:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh yeah Battle Royale was cool, interested in doing that sometime! You guys better be ready fight! >:D
742777182380916736 2016-06-14 17:54:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Sun/Moon had some cool stuff, nothing super impressive though imo, UI looks super neat though
742776838724816896 2016-06-14 17:52:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Zelda Breath of the Wild is looking amazing, now that we've finally seen more gameplay, so hyped for it now! :D
742774790730092544 2016-06-14 17:44:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CosmicPandaWfls Sun/Moon coverage is over, the rest is Zelda
742581304068169728 2016-06-13 04:55:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> WAIT REMASTERS OF THE ORIGINAL THREE CRASH BANDICOOTS? WHEN AND HOW MUCH?!?!
742580180397350912 2016-06-13 04:51:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree @Seven_Cubed Wow, this is amazing! Also wow it's been 4 months already, happy anniversary you two!
742469152057614338 2016-06-13 21:30:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> Skimming through Twitter and reading about the Ubisoft conference is hilarious, apparently there was a dance segment? XD
742210551460159488 2016-06-12 04:22:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looks like it's just watching Nintendo's coverage for me, which I wasn't even overly excited for (tho not cuz no digital event), oh well :/
742210240574160896 2016-06-12 04:21:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looks like Atlus isn't streaming any of their Persona 5 events at E3, so much for looking forward to seeing that D:
742183437088362496 2016-06-12 02:34:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> Awesome! Congrats! :D
741857817401774080 2016-06-11 05:01:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Yo @Seven_Cubed you're cool I guess so have a great bday! You better have a smile like this one all day, got it?pic.twitter.com/f9c9CsCn78
741857003228696576 2016-06-11 04:57:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @LCacicio Confusion is non-volatile, so they'd still get confused, I'm assuming
741632155034357760 2016-06-11 14:04:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> Last night, @CheeseyPokemon revealed yet another truth to the world.pic.twitter.com/7ukaBJukFO
741468502180012032 2016-06-10 03:14:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain It's the Internet, it's so likely it's almost guaranteed. So just ignore it.
741403497745113088 2016-06-10 22:55:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> oh wow you're so metal
741403143410352129 2016-06-10 22:54:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> THAT CAR THO WHERE AND HOW MUCH?https://twitter.com/virtueslastmeme/status/741356112734212096
741401510991429632 2016-06-10 22:47:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Like butter knives or steak knives? ...or plastic knives?
741047684862091264 2016-06-09 23:21:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> "trash" in Pig Latin is "ashtray"...does that make "ashtray" a Pig Latin word? :O
740954534969675777 2016-06-09 17:11:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Wait, you can't do that everywhere? Interesting.
740581557807677440 2016-06-08 16:29:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> "I wish I could stand in the shade of my own shadow" -A thought I just had Me pls
740398587406913537 2016-06-07 04:22:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd -with whatever else, they're servicing the mass rather than my minority, I'll just have to deal with the pricier workaround
740398402861694976 2016-06-07 04:21:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Makes sense, also more people move onto new games than cling to older ones so in replacing backwards compatibility-
740387532433592320 2016-06-07 03:38:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just wanna play older games sometimes, why they gotta make it so complicated >.>
740386367998328832 2016-06-07 03:34:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> And then there's the fact that the only PS3s that are backwards compatible are the oldest ones, no longer in production and quick to break
740386071481974788 2016-06-07 03:32:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> annoying, especially when I have to buy a PS3 just cuz I want to play a few PS3 games >.>
740385850274414592 2016-06-07 03:31:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm basically only buying a PS4 for Persona 5 anyway, but the fact that I most likely be getting more than two games out of it is a bit-
740385585437630464 2016-06-07 03:30:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I care about only two PS4 games, so the fact that has very limited backwards compatibility is really annoying
740367927979839488 2016-06-07 02:20:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> omg E3 is in a week which means Persona 5 news in a week. Y E S
740188658238529536 2016-06-07 14:28:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wrote this late last night, some thoughts I have on the future of Pokmon for me, bumping cuz Wynaut
740167317380726784 2016-06-07 13:03:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhttps://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/740155832520847360
740049620198297601 2016-06-06 05:15:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm off to bed now though, g'night my friendos :D
740049346792587265 2016-06-06 05:14:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> I don't really rant (if you want to call it a rant) often, but here we are :P
740049168446558208 2016-06-06 05:14:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just some thoughts on how I feel about one of my favorite game franchises and how it might not stay my favorite, nothing super serious
740048651934928896 2016-06-06 05:12:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Pokmon: Will I Still Enjoy It?  Read: http://tl.gd/n_1soouus
740003675255365632 2016-06-06 02:13:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> brb reevaluating my life haha
740003187285884928 2016-06-06 02:11:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think it just hit me I've been like this basically my whole life. Whoa.
740001968526004227 2016-06-06 02:06:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> As for me, Persona 5, TMS#FE, FE Fates, Bravely Second, Sun/Moon, and Persona 4 Ultimax, to name a few. JRPGs have my wallet XD
740001509413249024 2016-06-06 02:04:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> What games are you all looking forward to playing this year? Randomly curious :P
739935108094791681 2016-06-06 21:40:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 That last one was a stretch, but you get the point, yea?
739934626278297600 2016-06-06 21:38:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> You hate a lot of things, don't you, sir? Please, don't take (of)fence to that, rant too long and your voice'll get hoarse.
739882608893427712 2016-06-06 18:12:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I only learned a few days ago, so don't feel bad :P
739879269132701696 2016-06-06 17:58:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie A lion devouring the sun is an alchemical reference, so yes you could say that's where that came from
739700411741790208 2016-06-05 06:08:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Update, it spammed the one attack that could hit past my near invulnerability rip the dream, rip like 2 hours of unsavedness haha XD
739699763306598400 2016-06-05 06:05:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed "6" isn't too far off actually. But 7Cubed = 343 and 6Cubed is 216 so in another regard 7Cubed is closer :P
739699285143355393 2016-06-05 06:03:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ironically, I got said item from defeating said boss, so it's funny how that's saving me now XD
739698972088926209 2016-06-05 06:02:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> I got completely massacred, was not prepared at all XD
739698871895367680 2016-06-05 06:02:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Luckily I *almost* can't lose, as one of my teammates has an item that grants near invincibility, but for the most part-
739698612817383424 2016-06-05 06:01:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm gonna go to bed early, just gonna do this quest in Persona Q real quick an- *accidentally runs into the strongest foe in the game* Welp
739678552992317441 2016-06-05 04:41:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Sometimes it doesn't even take interaction. OR EVENING KNOWING THE OTHER EVEN EXISTS
739509069254299648 2016-06-05 17:27:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> That's what happens when you're cruel enough to name one of your companions "Murderer"
739466494136877056 2016-06-05 14:38:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy birthday @Nomppie! Hope you have a great day and you get to nom on some...um PANCAKES! Betcha thought I was gonna say "pie", huh? ;P
739258742223437824 2016-06-04 00:53:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @4reel17 Instead of backflip tricks, Solgaleo just jumps and devours the sun as its trick. ...it's a hard trick to replicate :P
738796666099109888 2016-06-03 18:17:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie You think it was a coincidence Vanillite debuted in the generation after the Pokmon that could become a fridge? renaePetch
738785580000018432 2016-06-03 17:33:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Can't wait to see the results of this! If you're an artist in the Wittz community, take a look at this!https://twitter.com/_razzchan_/status/738780930953875457
738535440240640001 2016-06-02 00:59:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MustacheLemon I'm glad I could help! :D
738534702529679363 2016-06-02 00:56:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SuperDanielM8 @MustacheLemon But it is of course all odds. I say go for the charm if you plan to hunt a lot, if not then don't
738534504415952896 2016-06-02 00:55:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SuperDanielM8 @MustacheLemon Charm triples your chance, depending on method, but the chance was really small to begin with
738496364754001922 2016-06-02 22:23:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ah okay, well I can't help you there, well good luck :P
738495946460266496 2016-06-02 22:22:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> It looks like Smogon has an article on it but if that's too much for you, the other way is through cheating devices
738414321005252609 2016-06-02 16:57:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie with Ice Punch, so we'll see if it's stats are accurate or not :P
738414219687694336 2016-06-02 16:57:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Note that early gameplay hasn't always matched up with the final game. Gardevoir with Fairy Wind, Mega Blaziken...
738407804050886656 2016-06-02 16:31:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon Hmm, yeah you're right, that is all they said. Everyone's assumptions just seemed became what they thought was the "truth"
738407152889389056 2016-06-02 16:29:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon @CheeseyPokemon Saying that they were "doomed", however, is far from the truth, Nintendo is nowhere near doomed
738406964112150528 2016-06-02 16:28:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @sami_spoon @CheeseyPokemon tbf, Nintendo's official statements on the matter heavily implied that Zelda was all
738391501298765824 2016-06-02 15:27:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> No, but for the wrong reasons, we barely saw her and she barely did anything
738391382109212672 2016-06-02 15:26:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl Sabrina isn't fond of battling either, though she's a gym leader, so it's possible, but I personally doubt
738391170582085633 2016-06-02 15:25:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl I still doubt she'll be a champion, like incredibly.
738390806755561472 2016-06-02 15:24:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl Are you referring to Lillie, cuz she's not a fan of battling, she doesn't like it. Doesn't mean we won't fight her, but still
738386637579640832 2016-06-02 15:07:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd OKAY I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE GUILTED
738380717445382144 2016-06-02 14:44:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope Rotomdex isn't super hand holdy, but just really snarky.
738367150079901697 2016-06-02 13:50:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> He did, however they are not in Discord for one and for two they're probably fake, still not exactly sure though
738366020553826305 2016-06-02 13:45:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> There are no leaks in Discord chat
738356477564321793 2016-06-02 13:07:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh my fav parts of that trailer were how the HP bars looked and the Rotomdex. It was cool I guess but there wasn't much we didn't know
738351476670500865 2016-06-02 12:48:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> My mood music for the pre-Sun/Moon news reveal B) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNNeRCHBOVs
738202144075976705 2016-06-01 02:54:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Like, pizza is pizza. If it's not Little Caesar's I'll probably love it ;P
738164009409515520 2016-06-01 00:23:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd True, but they at least did so in a unique way
738162730985607169 2016-06-01 00:18:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon And by "events of years past" I just mean events in general :P
738162569920151552 2016-06-01 00:17:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon If we could go to an undersea temple like in the movie that would be sick, but that's not the case for events of years past
738162394132668416 2016-06-01 00:16:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon DPPt had Darkrai, Shaymin, and (unreleased) Arceus events actually had new areas and cutscenes, they were "events"
738158460861173761 2016-06-01 00:01:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> It didn't feel special or very accomplishing. I wish they put at least a little effort into some of these events >.> Like make it an event?
738157192595931136 2016-06-01 23:56:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> A lady handing it to me. Yay. -_-
738157132319621121 2016-06-01 23:55:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> As a Pokmon lover for years, this is a grand moment...which is soured by the fact I get said 'mon in the most boring way possible
738156945886961666 2016-06-01 23:55:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> Manaphy is a Pokmon that's eluded me for years, the last Pokmon before I officially own every single currently obtainable Pokmon.
738096419408510976 2016-06-01 19:54:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> My mom is napping and I've determined there is no way I can prepare any lunch without waking her. My solution? Not have lunch :'D
738014042829131777 2016-06-01 14:27:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> It just hit me that E3 is in like 2 weeks, so hyped for more Persona 5 news! :D :D :D
737843114916749312 2016-05-31 03:08:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Second guessing is like my entire existence I've failed like every quiz because of it D:
737824026429526016 2016-05-31 01:52:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not fond of it alone, but man does it go well with other things. Warm up some pie with some vanilla ice cream, mmmmm.
737689635929743360 2016-05-31 16:58:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz Best of luck on your first day of work, show 'em how great you are! :D
737314859512041476 2016-05-30 16:08:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you eat enough :P
736677018289344517 2016-05-28 21:54:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Excited to see what Trials and Tribulations has to offer, definitely loving this series so far! :D
736676878992310272 2016-05-28 21:53:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just beat Ace Attorney: Justice For All and man what a blast that final case was, fave case so far!
736561445878398976 2016-05-28 14:15:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 For those who still care, I made this late last night.
736440206610419712 2016-05-27 06:13:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey look, I finally got around to making one of these. Well, here ya go: http://www.quizyourfriends.com/take-quiz.php?id=1605280120158679&lnk&
736438780756791296 2016-05-27 06:07:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I bet you felt so proud when you came up with that, huh?
736395336751534080 2016-05-27 03:15:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed SECOND GUESSING SCREWED ME A;SLDGA;SLDFJAS;LGHAS;DLFJA;JSDF
736373629500280837 2016-05-27 01:48:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> Today I've learned I'm a mediocre guesser, I 2nd guess a lot and my first is usually right, and I don't know people as well as I'd like too
736317337117167616 2016-05-27 22:05:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Failing one of Joe's tests likepic.twitter.com/KiXNXi9oRL
736315262866096128 2016-05-27 21:56:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I even call shenanigans on the ones I got right. >.> ...but you'd probably make a good teacher yeah
736314933516734464 2016-05-27 21:55:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> A TON OF THESE ARE TRICK QUESTIONS
736307873395789824 2016-05-27 21:27:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> Don't worry though, le doge is currently dry, so it's all good ;P
736307531417419776 2016-05-27 21:26:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> *looks outside, cloudy but not currently raining* Looks fine, let's take the dog out. Not even 3 minutes later it starts POURING
735960911261761538 2016-05-26 22:28:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've proven my power and beat P4G's bonus boss, definitely one of my favorite boss fights of all time simply because of how brutal it is! :D
735856084393431040 2016-05-26 15:32:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> If you missed the Mew distribution in February, here's a second chance!https://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/735855794911076352
735705513254494208 2016-05-25 05:33:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 So I hope everyone's speed bump is a smooth one, night everybody! :D
735705369893183488 2016-05-25 05:33:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've begun to realize I view sleep as an unavoidable obstacle; a speed bump on the road of an enjoyable night.
734868754354446336 2016-05-23 22:08:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thanks much! ^_^
734822531517939713 2016-05-23 19:05:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ZerrockCrisis Thanks! :D
734822295949086721 2016-05-23 19:04:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> Nah my mood is fine. But yes. Yes it did
734821815470592000 2016-05-23 19:02:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I seriously never thought I'd ever get bird pooped on. Not even 5 min after the end of my interview
734820644366360576 2016-05-23 18:57:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Good news: I got the job! Bad news: a bird just pooped on me
734593668057812992 2016-05-22 03:55:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Vivillon has a lot of colorful forms...wait, "Sun"?! GUYS I FIGURED IT OUT THE HINTS WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIMEpic.twitter.com/SP2Oxx8sYp
734143120737075200 2016-05-21 22:05:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LCacicio No prob and yeah I'm doing the same :P
734142858505027584 2016-05-21 22:04:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @LCacicio CN France aired some episodes early. So the answer to that question is no and yes, if that makes sense
734064112712421376 2016-05-21 16:51:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Glad to see you again! Hope you're doing well and hope you punch that sickness in its face renaeFight
734063299801796610 2016-05-21 16:48:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Wishing a very happy birthday to they who's tag is labeled "Decker's": @DeckerStag! Hope you have an awesome day! :D
734051394710167552 2016-05-21 16:01:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 My nervousness left pretty quickly, but all that's left now is the waiting game, thanks for the luck wishes guys! :D
734033090943680513 2016-05-21 14:48:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> About to have my first job interview. Super nervous, but I know I can do it, wish me luck!
733861043726745600 2016-05-20 03:24:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> And you're the one who asked a question about a pic where the answer was in the pic, cast your sarcastic glances elswhere
733860309111181312 2016-05-20 03:21:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey, you asked.
733860060435075072 2016-05-20 03:20:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> "Mega Drain did not learn Drain Punch!" That's what he's saying.
733788604325994497 2016-05-20 22:36:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hmm, I guess that is odd, but they must have a reason for it :P
733787698733813761 2016-05-20 22:33:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Their finals are probably over, so the don't have any more school left? That's how it worked at my school at least
733506424093835264 2016-05-19 03:55:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> ...to this! It's amazing, I'll be having so much fun just scrolling through the menu! :Dpic.twitter.com/UZc17ZCEMa
733506122103934976 2016-05-19 03:54:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> On the topic of menus, the difference between P3 and P4's to P5's is incredible. Just compare these...pic.twitter.com/94YpKIMMe9
733499755427332097 2016-05-19 03:29:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> P3's menu is a gun's cylinder and while P5's isn't really anything thematic visually, it has the best UI of the 3pic.twitter.com/KG9RuapIYV
733498454693937152 2016-05-19 03:23:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was thinking about how stylish and creative P5's menus and such look but I had to stop and realize past Persona games were stylish too
733496676292272128 2016-05-19 03:16:49 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've experienced 300+ hours of P4G and it took until just now to notice the battle menu is a knob of an analog TVpic.twitter.com/UzPv5DRhvt
733359078466932736 2016-05-19 18:10:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Get destroyed
733358977010933760 2016-05-19 18:09:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> And by "super rare" I mean I've been grinding skill cards for a collective 8.25 hours and that's the second Rank 10 card I've gotten :'D
733358702175064064 2016-05-19 18:08:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 For reference, I need Rank 10 Skill Cards with Absorb Elec, Absorb Ice, and Absorb Fire, they're super rare and I got one!
733358377615642624 2016-05-19 18:07:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh? Oh?? OHHHH????? YESSSSSSS!!!pic.twitter.com/QaLllCrmDH
733155912534216704 2016-05-18 04:42:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Another half hour on top of that and still nothing. This is gonna take a while. A looooong while. :"D
733148219450920961 2016-05-18 04:12:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw about 6 hours of item grinding in P4G turns up nothing. This is fine. Perfectly fine. *twitches*
733123367348273152 2016-05-18 02:33:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd For reference, my entire party is at max level AND have the best armor in the game
733123174364106753 2016-05-18 02:32:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Oh yeah quite a bit, I'm currently item grinding to help me out quite a bit but it'll still be rough
733122402922569728 2016-05-18 02:29:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Definitely one of the hardest boss fights I've ever faced in an RPG, or any game in general, but I'll beat it someday!
733121748464369664 2016-05-18 02:27:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I wonder if Persona 5 will have a bonus boss as hard as P4's cuz holy crap were the devs cruel in making that boss fight
733050641535242240 2016-05-18 21:44:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Beat Ace Attorney 1 a bit ago and had a blast, even though I knew the all the major plot points. So pumped to play JFA completely blind! :D
732996470576533504 2016-05-18 18:09:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Probably one of the best uses of the gems, so we were quick to think on it :P
732995647452811264 2016-05-18 18:05:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I was always a fan of Acrobatics + Flying Gem, I hope the gems come back so I can mess with them more :P
732795706386354176 2016-05-17 04:51:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Can confirm, my Platinum Wedlocke was probably my roughest -locke that I've beaten.
732705405642543105 2016-05-17 22:52:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> 12. Fave main series game, great aftergame, fantastic music, fave region, has a lot of my fave 'mons so much to lovepic.twitter.com/J3yOsM1T7c

732700901790474240 2016-05-17 22:34:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Those guys were hilarious in the third game and I was pretty bummed they weren't the same silly robots
732700530108047360 2016-05-17 22:33:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> On the topic of Ratchet & Clank, tbh my biggest disappointment with the movie is that the Galactic Rangers weren't the same from the game
732698598341672960 2016-05-17 22:25:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> 10. One of my favorite games for its humor; fun gameplay, something something great musicpic.twitter.com/TJdGp04bdl

732680181744209921 2016-05-17 21:12:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> 8. This is one I have many fond memories of, despite one boss roadblocking me for 11 years (no joke)!pic.twitter.com/kW73KI74hA
732671731299553281 2016-05-17 20:38:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's notable in that not that many games make me stop and think about topics such as life, death, and the importance of friendship, love it!
732671357457063936 2016-05-17 20:37:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> 7. My 2nd favorite game of all, makes me stop and think about life and death; great characters and storypic.twitter.com/CVwPuXQH3M

732658544261005312 2016-05-17 19:46:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> As a native Texan, I can vouch for this being accurate renaePetchpic.twitter.com/PTiFToDUgS
732617710622760960 2016-05-17 17:04:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> I might as well prefix that I love the soundtrack in all of my fave games :P Also note that these aren't in any specific order.
732617538509529088 2016-05-17 17:03:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> 5. My favorite Mario game of all, so full of character and life, with, of course, an excellent soundtrack! ^_^pic.twitter.com/To4gTSfKlz

732100555074457600 2016-05-15 06:49:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Really tho Terraria is so much fun, it just eats time. Those 3 hours I played felt like 30 min :P
732100253436895234 2016-05-15 06:47:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> A little bit of Terraria with a friend turned into a couple h ours, as it's almost 2 now, oops :P Night everyone! :D
732009168454877184 2016-05-15 00:46:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> On the subject of Mega Evolution returning to Gen VII, @JoeHearthstone and I have figured out the truth.pic.twitter.com/fT987eJXmR
731978799978446848 2016-05-15 22:45:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> @lucahjin Actually, in Gen VI, it's weak to Fairy. Otherwise, you're right
731594614751158272 2016-05-14 21:18:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ace Attorney is so much fun, and I'm only playing cases I've already seen, can't wait to get to the 2nd and 3rd games completely blind! :D
731553313137647617 2016-05-14 18:34:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain That's the thing tho, you're *earning* this money. I think it's fine to take it as long as it doesn't put anyone in a bad way
731552302620770307 2016-05-14 18:30:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain You're working and you're getting rewarded for it, why feel bad? Unless money is tight?
731221343778144256 2016-05-13 20:35:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie The hardest part in any game. :O
730896735170494464 2016-05-12 23:05:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Just realized I might have to avoid Twitter to avoid SU spoilers >.>

730631496025792512 2016-05-11 05:31:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree @Nomppie @Seven_Cubed Am also Texan, where are my gunshorts?
730568022985981952 2016-05-11 01:19:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Picked up the trilogy, I've seen the first game in its entirety, but never played any/seen 2 or 3 :P
730566045690265600 2016-05-11 01:11:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Huge thanks to @Stupid_Pokenerd for getting me a $20 eShop code, looks like I'll finally be able to pick up Ace Attorney after all! :D
730529331680661504 2016-05-11 22:45:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> To clarify, I'm more so referring to the fact that it's *not* a Steven Bomb.
730529152810409984 2016-05-11 22:44:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thing that excites me the most about the fact that SU is returning tomorrow: that it'll have weekly airings again

730139750389047296 2016-05-10 20:57:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I dunno, that was the only reason I could think of, it really does make no sense now that I think about it.
730138747673530368 2016-05-10 20:53:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry They needed a boss fight for Knuckles?
730038163133980672 2016-05-10 14:13:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> From Persona 5's newest trailer looks like the crew goes to Hawaii New Pokmon region based off Hawaii COINCIDENCE?!pic.twitter.com/WRBrORqL0V
730033549345095681 2016-05-10 13:55:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Is this guy supposed to be our rival? I hope not tbh. Friends thing besides, his design looks pretty bland to me I guess
730015526987014144 2016-05-10 12:43:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby @_razzchan_ No I thought most people hated Chespin at first too, iirc.
730006626480979968 2016-05-10 12:08:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> That was cool. The starters didn't really grab me besides Litten, but the legendaries are cool though
730005367770382336 2016-05-10 12:03:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is a thing hahahahaha

729854074925944837 2016-05-09 02:02:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Well I doubt they'd *just* tweet it, but still we have no idea how this is getting revealed, which is odd
729853943233175552 2016-05-09 02:01:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry I have no idea. Since the event was announced via Twitter they might just tweet it? Or drop a YT vid on the official channel idk
729824374056853504 2016-05-09 00:04:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @wash_n_dry Should be 8am EST

729699857611427840 2016-05-09 15:49:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I wouldn't call our interactions "putting up with you", it's always a good time hanging out with you! :D
729676887165784065 2016-05-09 14:18:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Finished my last final, now I have the summer to shake off whatever funk I'm in so that fall I can hopefully drag my GPA back up

727914479535542276 2016-05-04 17:35:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone But...but...

727689717181898752 2016-05-03 02:42:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Sleep well! :D
727555172918947840 2016-05-03 17:47:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @pm461 @GT_Rakos @Pm461 GameStop through the 24th
727364332284039168 2016-05-02 05:09:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> Had a great day today, hope you did too, have a good night everyone! :D
727360498069446656 2016-05-02 04:53:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone Excused. ...I actually don't know what this is, but I might keep an eye out when this time comes :O
727315416805036032 2016-05-02 01:54:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @callieviolet29 Wishing you the best, you got this, I believe in you! :D
727307746706518016 2016-05-02 01:24:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time And you didn't take pictures to share smh. renaePetch
726864569813987328 2016-05-01 20:03:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Too bad the only two games I'm interested in or don't already have are gold rewards, Triforce Heroes and DKCTF, oh well XD
726863903641104384 2016-05-01 20:00:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Note this is for America, not sure about European rewards
726863798934491136 2016-05-01 20:00:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> It looks like My Nintendo has some new discounts! Dark Moon, SMG2, Pikmin 3, & Metroid Prime Trilogy I recommend!pic.twitter.com/JAVzc5ieUB
726818544915116032 2016-05-01 17:00:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone Don't forget to not remember this...wait.
726447660173938688 2016-04-30 16:26:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mechon_m808 $4.99 is pretty cheap, yeah I'd have to agree.
726432324087246849 2016-04-30 15:25:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tai1sy So happy that you've been making progress on your transition, I hope everything else goes well for you too!
726173404454215680 2016-04-29 22:16:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time As for why the sizes exist in the first place, to give you the illusion of choice, obviously
726173125528801280 2016-04-29 22:15:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time They were fixing your mistake, you clearly meant the large Who'd choose the option with *less* pizza
726125363114307585 2016-04-29 19:05:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @4reel17 That's what I'm thinking, but I'm not really sure, it's something I'll have to think on for a while
726124971542478848 2016-04-29 19:04:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@4reel17 This may just be some weird funk I'm in, I don't really know, but for now I just want summer so I don't have to think about it
726124691354619904 2016-04-29 19:03:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@4reel17 that anymore, I've been coding for like 3 years & 4 classes and I feel like I barely know anything and I haven't been enjoying it
726124527231488000 2016-04-29 19:02:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@4reel17 That's the thing though, my main goal is to make video games, programming and such, and I've realized that I might not want to do
726119081288425472 2016-04-29 18:40:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think my main problem is that I just don't care enough. Like I have a test today, probably gonna fail/not do well, but I don't really care
726118059178528768 2016-04-29 18:36:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've lost basically all motivation to try or even pay attention in class. It's annoying and I hate it, but I also don't care
726079080014090242 2016-04-29 16:01:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I wish being bored was my problem tbh :/
726078852489826305 2016-04-29 16:01:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 This year has been great for me , but academically it's been my worst, I just wanna push it away and be done with it
726078445772374017 2016-04-29 15:59:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Never before have I been so ready to just be done with school, just a little over a week left and I'll be done
725862503704465408 2016-04-28 01:41:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie ...different characters? I dunno, the only difference was genders and Druddigon's ability, it was pretty pointless :P
725844939750301697 2016-04-28 00:31:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Played a ton of the games as a child, so not only will it be nostalgic, but I'm interested to see what's new/different :D
725844598497501184 2016-04-28 00:30:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anyone else seeing the Ratchet & Clank movie this weekend? First time in years I'm going to see a movie in theaters and I'm hyped! :D
725818910646239232 2016-04-28 22:48:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie @catsruntokyo They'll talk about more than just Zelda, it'll just be the major focus and the only playable demo of the games shown.
725709031935889408 2016-04-28 15:31:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw you're willing to get up earlier than you get up for school for a video game event (I'm CDT :'D )https://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/725705126032211968
725465098286817280 2016-04-27 23:22:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Hopefully it's easier to power through them if you're used to them. You got this!!
725463790532235264 2016-04-27 23:17:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Grandpa Cheesey, why are your classes so late D:  And I thought my occasional 5:30-7pm physics tests were bad D:
725422593885368320 2016-04-27 20:33:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 @TreeckoloverPat play Smash as intensely as other people, like these Redditors do.
725422406991400961 2016-04-27 20:32:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Was curious so I did some light reading, seems good but not broken, but I'm not one to judge I-pic.twitter.com/t5eylDrIUI
725412522543570944 2016-04-27 19:53:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Many factors: just one match, maybe they just used it a lot, maybe they're good with it, one match isn't good determinator
725324162344964096 2016-04-27 14:02:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahahaha I've been up for 2.5 hours and it took me until now to realize my shirt is backwards good job me I'm proud of you
725159789257330688 2016-04-26 03:09:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've never been too interested in the 3DS themes but this Red and Blue one is so cool I want it :Ohttps://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/725134885342433280
725115519934730240 2016-04-26 00:13:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd I doubt it's going away, but I hope it dissipates even a little
725114752297369600 2016-04-26 00:10:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd That actually made a lot of sense, I just hope storytellers don't fall back on amnesia too much in the future :P
725110975347597313 2016-04-26 23:55:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 To clarify, I'm referring to a character whose memories are gone and upon returning, usually contain a massive plot reveal
725108942225862656 2016-04-26 23:46:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've recently realized the amnesiac character trope is in a lot of games, I can think of 5 off memory across 4 games
724990828297392128 2016-04-26 15:57:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Conversations with Hyper @JoeHearthstone, for context we were talking about stones with the fourth pic.pic.twitter.com/paCB6JOYXu
724978162694672385 2016-04-26 15:07:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Thanks, I appreciate that.
724977633109274625 2016-04-26 15:05:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope everyone is having a good day cuz mine sucks so far, in addition to the prior there's a lot on my mind,most of it me hating on myself
724977159626846208 2016-04-26 15:03:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Today I was that guy for the third time ever, all in this semester. Never be that guy
724977070489522177 2016-04-26 15:02:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> One thing I hate about group projects is the guy who doesn't do any work, I never thought I'd be that guy nor did I ever want to be
724729870316507136 2016-04-25 22:40:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Almost every Scizor is red though, so he can't have me beat renaeFight
724645797841633280 2016-04-25 17:06:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore @CheeseyPokemon I too don't believe in naps, I must be a robot then :P
724326093264719874 2016-04-24 19:56:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Who's your favorite Eeveelution?  Close tie between Espeon, Umbreon, and Leafeon. Espeon for its simple yet cute  https://l.ask.fm/igoto/45DKECPW7B667HQMHN2IG6NMZSADDOY7SDA6PANKCH4PFJ7IRAR4YJIIPIEYWXBTKSYPIFAJINUDYUSWRJ57M3FAK32KZBBGWIIERFKKBN3CEI7CJSEC4IG5TSRPTUTDTT2Z6HAV2DMH5UUQLGNDIT3C7XOXT6E2Z6CVXYLXTKT2GUOBD5XVBH5J3BY2F2H7XI5LSES4VFLPHSBO
723965594299572224 2016-04-23 20:03:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> The best thing about burritos is that they take about as long to eat as it does to make, minus cooking the meat :D
723946967970111488 2016-04-23 18:49:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @Seven_Cubed Sometime tomorrow
723905573238927360 2016-04-23 16:05:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone I feel personally attacked, then I stopped caring, we still have the timer
723905379764051968 2016-04-23 16:04:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm not even salty tbh, it's just oh okay I still have the timer. If I didn't then I might be a little upset
723901606987595776 2016-04-23 15:49:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> Looks like that P5 release date was fake. The PC note should've tipped me off, but the source was reliable and the site was hacked. Oh well
723730748239286272 2016-04-22 04:30:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Whoa, I love the lighting in this :O
723706487797764096 2016-04-22 02:54:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @7CubedThoughts Looks pretty cool so far! :D
723673011795054592 2016-04-22 00:41:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh the thing that most excites me about SU's return is the weekly airings I much prefer those to Steven Bombs tbh
723556681880231936 2016-04-22 16:58:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tai1sy Huh? How?
723525012498485248 2016-04-22 14:53:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone @p_kouhou I'M READY
723485360055971840 2016-04-22 12:15:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT AAAAAAH IM EXCITED!!~ I know I should stay level headed, but I need this game you don't understand
722921652644806656 2016-04-20 22:55:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore SAME *SOBS*
722834511122182152 2016-04-20 17:09:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @Pokemon It's been back to the original since Unova I think?
722815996780683264 2016-04-20 15:55:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> That umbrella would've been great to have right now. Of course I have it when I don't need it and don't have it when I do
722777865071120384 2016-04-20 13:24:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> After reading this it looks like it's kind of a stretch/grasping for anything at this point but if there's a chance I'm hoping
722775838328946689 2016-04-20 13:16:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahaha I'm such a hypocrite, I always say not to get excited over rumors and such, saw this and my hopes are high XDhttps://twitter.com/Persona_Central/status/722771799054753793
722627785387167744 2016-04-19 03:27:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Looks like it wasn't a goof :Opic.twitter.com/fgSYuDiVZq
722625773572530176 2016-04-19 03:19:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie I think I like the cream nose better than the green. Just me?
722625142870814720 2016-04-19 03:17:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Oh wow, never noticed that, hahaha. Prolly just a goof tho :P
722623885665894401 2016-04-19 03:12:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've had two days off cuz of weather and I did a great job of getting nothing done, I'm good at life guys :'D
722619033380466689 2016-04-19 02:52:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ForestDomain Probably not, but that doesn't stop many people
722612936812814336 2016-04-19 02:28:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone It's a GREAT 100 hours :D ...kinda wanna play it again too. hmmm.
722598191233835008 2016-04-19 01:30:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> .@Seven_Cubed Saying this regardless of @Azurillkirby's potential wasp caused death: you're dumb
722553154068328448 2016-04-19 22:31:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby ;~;
722553086313496576 2016-04-19 22:30:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 NOW I'M ANGRY HOW WELL WILL YOU DIE? CHECKMATE I'LL SAY WHEN IT ENDS I'LL KILL YOU TWICE I'M GONNA KILL YOU :D
722551041837768704 2016-04-19 22:22:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @JoeHearthstone Oh yeah I bet they do, just like people do for Twitter followers.
722502432001904640 2016-04-19 19:09:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Glad to hear one of the most satisfying things becomes even better! :D
722496643635945473 2016-04-19 18:46:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> Getting critical hits in FE Awakening are one of the most satisfying things in a video game ever.
722393751574872065 2016-04-19 11:57:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Needless to say my morning is starting out pretty well, hope yours is too! :D
722393403590205440 2016-04-19 11:56:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> Shoutout to the random guy at the bus stop for telling me campus is closed before I got on the bus and took the hour long ride there
722228987204734976 2016-04-18 01:03:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Yeah yeah, bring on the "I told you so"s, but I didn't think it was that hard. :P
722216904102785024 2016-04-18 00:15:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Guys I figured it out, feat. @Stupid_Pokenerdpic.twitter.com/ypMSYteDdq
722210999126794240 2016-04-18 23:51:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Just from the Prologue, the difference between Hard and Lunatic is staggering. If Hard is a step up, Lunatic is a leap
722210419167797248 2016-04-18 23:49:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone W O W
722208024056627201 2016-04-18 23:39:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh wait there's a Hard Mode How did I miss that. Never mind guys I'm an idiot
722207167671967746 2016-04-18 23:36:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> I may attempt to do the Lunatic Conquest as I've heard it's fairer in Fates, but I'm not so sure it'll be fun anymore
722207016962387968 2016-04-18 23:35:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I *guess* I can do Normal Classic No Reset, since I reset my first run, but I dunno, Lunatic is just super brutal
722206244262416388 2016-04-18 23:32:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> The problem is though, there's no middle ground in difficulty. Lunatic is too hard but Normal is too easy.
722205665507168257 2016-04-18 23:30:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> tbh I don't really find Lunatic all that fun. It's too hard and it seems like you'll be super dependent on like two units
722187798120235008 2016-04-18 22:19:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL Lunatic was a mistake
722096723393249280 2016-04-18 16:17:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I HAVE BUT IT'S SO ARGH AND IT'S ONLY THE PROLOUGE WHAT IS LUNATIC+ LIKE?!
722095832170778625 2016-04-18 16:13:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> WHY IS THIS SO HOW COME NO ONE TOLD ME A;SLDKGHA;LSKGJA
722093989218820096 2016-04-18 16:06:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Eh we'll see...actually, yes.
722093418499837952 2016-04-18 16:04:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've made the executive decision to drop the "no resets" portion of this challenge This is harder than I thought it would be
722092486261248001 2016-04-18 16:00:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Stupid_Pokenerd Well, no not yet, but Lissa is dead.
722092309395820544 2016-04-18 15:59:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> WHY THE HELL DID I THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA WHAT IS THIS

721207850190503937 2016-04-15 05:25:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Do spinoffs count? If so, PMD EoTDS, HGSS, B2W2. If not, then BW is third.
720968185294430209 2016-04-15 13:33:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @DeckerStag These laws look like the laws someone who won a "Governor/Mayor for a Day" contest would make, just screwing around with power
720967468034830336 2016-04-15 13:30:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I love how most rivals are bewildered as to how they lose to you and then there's just Blue who somehow thinks he's still better than you
720629823324860416 2016-04-14 15:08:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 He makes tons of stuff like that one so if that's your jam I highly recommend him
720629730915921922 2016-04-14 15:08:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 The person who made this, Djthesdotcom, is pretty much my biggest inspiration to make remixes
720629466083360768 2016-04-14 15:07:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> This is one of my favorite remixes to listen to as of late, it's all so goodhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmmJxyAz9CQ

720297753717252097 2016-04-13 17:09:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed I will end you
720297613392633856 2016-04-13 17:08:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Can I lose you?
720296012783353857 2016-04-13 17:02:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Especially when I take extra precautions to prevent losing them but no of course not, wonder what else I'm losing this week
720295797074432000 2016-04-13 17:01:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lost the umbrella I bought last week to replace the one I lost weeks before that, also lost a sharpener too, I hate how I keep losing things

720088836110286848 2016-04-12 03:18:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Just make the essay look so good the bed looks worse in comparison. Easy.
720087896959488001 2016-04-12 03:15:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone @RenaeCollects Is that what happened to you? Or were you born a weeb? :O
720086650127134720 2016-04-12 03:10:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Solution! Mess up your bed so it doesn't look so tempting!
720033207672942592 2016-04-12 23:37:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time and welcome to the sweet spread or preserve made from fruit and sugar boiled to a thick consistency.

719901201123319809 2016-04-12 14:53:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Oh man, I didn't know the new Ratchet & Clank brought back the Yu-Gi-Oh cards again! That was the best part about the original
719872390864314368 2016-04-12 12:58:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Whoa it wasn't?!...wait, it looks like Sun & Moon aren't out yet, man I missed 10 years of salt?! D:
719872111393681411 2016-04-12 12:57:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I was devastated that I lost 10 years of my life, but so happy to see that after all that time, people still remembered me
719871517102710784 2016-04-12 12:55:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> On an unrelated note, I had a bittersweet dream last night I got in an accident, was in a coma for 10 years and learned I was quadriplegic
719871385208684544 2016-04-12 12:54:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat As terrible as that sounds, I do enjoy people getting salty over their own expectations :P
719870124140789761 2016-04-12 12:49:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Basically, don't overhype yourself, you'll (probably) only be disappointed, though I've said this many times already :P
719869930468802561 2016-04-12 12:49:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> I thought this first CoroCoro was hilarious, but I know not everyone has the same sense of humor I do
719731891197181953 2016-04-11 03:40:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @7CubedThoughts @GirafarigTree @CheeseyPokemon This both is and isn't exactly what I expected.
719730335580160000 2016-04-11 03:34:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ugh, I'll just go to sleep so I don't fall asleep in class tomorrow, even though I probably will, good night guys
719729912219762689 2016-04-11 03:32:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> I try and try and try but I just can't get anything done. If I fail any class it wouldn't be on lack of comprehension, just lack of focus
719729586653630465 2016-04-11 03:31:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've seriously been attempting to work on the same assignment for a collective 14ish hours and have gotten NOTHING done. Zero. It's so bad.
719729171589541892 2016-04-11 03:29:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Guess who couldn't focus on a wall to save their life, let alone homework, I'm really good at not getting work done.
719719790688870401 2016-04-11 02:52:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @CheeseyPokemon Still not really one of the first thoughts when just red is shown, that's just me though
719716466677813248 2016-04-11 02:39:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Really disappointed in you man, I thought you were above this smh
719712910587461633 2016-04-11 02:25:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time I feel this so much
719663957284290560 2016-04-11 23:10:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon When you happy accident just right
719571159868579840 2016-04-11 17:01:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> Bus RNG is cruel, I either barely miss or barely get on the bus with little variance. I was lucky today, but knowing my luck it won't last
719372595041165313 2016-04-10 03:52:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hope you all have a good night, take care everyone!
719364423287111680 2016-04-10 03:20:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> Few can get little to no work done in a 7 hour timespan, I, however, make it a talent. All I need is an intense lack of overall focus.
718953411786313729 2016-04-09 00:07:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie That's pretty dumb, you'd think people would be smarter or at least have basic consideration to not do that to people
718950308617920512 2016-04-09 23:54:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie ...what? I can't even comprehend why anyone would do that.
718668890780241920 2016-04-08 05:16:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree You're one of the most kindhearted people I've ever met, you actually inspire me to be an actively nicer person, stay awesome
718636249976688641 2016-04-08 03:06:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree @Golden_Celebi Oh man, I love slight knock offs, it's like it's almost the real thing, but they're different in their own way
718603070922330112 2016-04-08 00:54:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I would say this is the unluckiest -locke challenge I've done, but at one point in my White Nuzlocke I had two 'mons and 5 badges so I dunno

717116456341606401 2016-04-04 22:27:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree I guess I could give him some pointers, but he's got a commanding aura that could come in handy. And he's royalty so bonus ;P
717111714727071744 2016-04-04 22:08:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 As for why Bowser, he'd obviously make a great wingman.
717111580794626048 2016-04-04 22:08:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> I still think Miitomo is trying to hook me up, so I may as well put in the work too. Don't be shy ladies.pic.twitter.com/1yINMauQQR
717074648316321793 2016-04-04 19:41:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Yes, I am still salty about that but it's the principle!
717074353725157376 2016-04-04 19:40:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I saw a stapler earlier today and no joke my first thought was "that one probably had staples in it when purchased" XD
717018482391457792 2016-04-04 15:58:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time @Seven_Cubed I'd have to agree, it's pretty amazing. Though, I'm biased, but oh well :P
716986271982178305 2016-04-04 13:50:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 THAT'S LIKE SELLING A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUY ALL OF THE CHARACTERS. LIKE SELLING A BOOK WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUY THE PAGES
716985851943628800 2016-04-04 13:48:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> I bought a stapler on Friday and I just opened it and there are NO FREAKING STAPLES IN IT WHYYY
716837765770399745 2016-04-03 04:00:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> Anyway, I'm off to bed, hope you all have a good night.
716837695964651522 2016-04-03 03:59:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Lack of focus and a headache have prevented me from getting anything done, ugh I hate my lack of concentration
716814648620617729 2016-04-03 02:28:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I need music to focus and I'm just having a really hard time doing that now, when I have a lot of work I foolishly put off
716814511777251330 2016-04-03 02:27:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hate when I'm so unfocused, I can't even stand listening to the same music for more than 5 min.
716728294712823808 2016-04-03 20:45:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 K, they literally asked me "Who are you in love with?" Geez, they're not even trying to be subtle anymore XD
716707708523511809 2016-04-03 19:23:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> I think Miitomo is trying to hook me up with someone, they keep asking me love questions XD

716304990671732737 2016-04-02 16:43:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JediMasterRen @AlqTheTentacle Persona anime isn't bad, but doesn't do the greatness of the games justice, that's just imo tho :P

716253901633114113 2016-04-02 13:20:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> Man, Miitomo is hitting me hard with the real questions, what a weird way to start my day

716119063689166848 2016-04-01 04:24:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat My cat is black, and she likes to hang around my door on early school mornings, so I can relate :P

716089673949388800 2016-04-01 02:27:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 It's like Schrdinger's Prank, you were and weren't pranked, boom get rekt
716089522174361601 2016-04-01 02:27:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 tricking all the people who thought I would make some prank after all!
716089483553148930 2016-04-01 02:26:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753  think that I'd "prank" by not doing so. Instead, I came up with an actual prank in mind: that I don't prank you after all,
716089382944440320 2016-04-01 02:26:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I bet a bunch of you were thinking "is his prank really gonna be no prank?". Anyone else, maybe, but not me. You see I expected you would
716078819262603266 2016-04-01 01:44:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Yes, a hat. It looks like you're missing a hat. renaePetch
716077588649672705 2016-04-01 01:39:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> @YFYGuy There was an April 1st Direct last year, this year people brought up the post again cuz April Fools, to mess with ppl, so no.
715990112551632896 2016-04-01 19:51:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> LRT. Why are you reading this when you could be playing "Big's Big Fishing Adventure 3"?
715967719011524608 2016-04-01 18:23:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 My genius April Fools joke will be this evening, hope you all can handle it. >:D
715945874459746309 2016-04-01 16:56:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon @MrMime_Time I believe in Cheesey, he believes in you, and by the transitive property of belief, I believe in you too. :D
715891972725088256 2016-04-01 13:22:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sola_Luna6 @Sylvaur Last year there was a direct on April 1st, people are bringing it back up to mess with people, no planned Direct today.

715718502993104896 2016-03-31 01:52:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat For the easy April Fool's joke. If people pay attention and remember they did that, it *shouldn't* be a problem, but y'know
715711454280716289 2016-03-31 01:24:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sola_Luna6 Yeah, their sorta tagline for it was "this is no joke" :P
715706894933856256 2016-03-31 01:06:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna have fun with Miifoto, I can feel it.

715384826929369089 2016-03-30 03:46:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> TIL there are tons of electronic instruments. Violins, harps, bagpipes, saxophones, banjos, harmonicas, organ, and more, so cool :O
715364356347731968 2016-03-30 02:25:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl Oh yeah it was, we combined elements of many games, Duel Spaces, Chance Time, items from multiple different games :P
715364057927168000 2016-03-30 02:24:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl Took like 10ish min to set up, took like maybe 2-3 hours to play out a 20 turn game. Forgot to mention we YouTube'd for music
715363784336912386 2016-03-30 02:23:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 @Pichuforbrawl It was a lot fun coming up with stuff like that, making up board events the games never do :P
715362270381903876 2016-03-30 02:17:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pichuforbrawl I was pretty fun, I think I remember making a Spear Pillar board, where Dialga can alter dice speed & Palkia can warp players
715355057269514240 2016-03-30 01:48:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I dunno what made me remember this but I did and those were good times :P
715354699021438980 2016-03-30 01:47:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I even remember making up board events and minigames. My bro and I controlled two characters each, but we kept it fair haha
715353853596577793 2016-03-30 01:43:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Uno cards for spaces, Legos for characters, Mario Wiki for minigames, our imagination for making our own boards
715353691935498240 2016-03-30 01:43:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I just remembered when I was younger, my brother and I would make our own Mario Party boards with the toys we had
715316984347365376 2016-03-30 23:17:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> Many people want a Waluigi centered game, but am I truly alone in wanting a Mario's Cement Factory sequel? renaePetch
715027712524595200 2016-03-29 04:07:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> @JoeHearthstone I spent 30 min on that you better appreciate it pls and tanks

714426801666154500 2016-03-28 12:19:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> I really need to look into making electronic music/remixes cuz I just entertained the idea of making themes for some of you using themes
714286933459898369 2016-03-27 03:04:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @7CubedThoughts Smart, funny, kind, a great friend who's always fun to chat with, stay awesome my friend :D

714155370910916608 2016-03-27 18:21:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 The Mario series just has so many variants and sub-species and I dunno, I just love it :P
714155185866551296 2016-03-27 18:20:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> Boo has 40 sub-species, Goombas have 62, Koopas have 24 (many of which with their own subs and variants), Piranha Plant has 54, I love it
714142872182730752 2016-03-27 17:31:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 @TreeckoloverPat He also voices Silas, apparently
714142670495481856 2016-03-27 17:30:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Just checked, yep, voiced by Anthony Del Rio, voice of Pit and Dark Pit
713973890679066625 2016-03-26 06:20:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Just like I thought, my day was pretty good, I hope yours was similar, have a good night! :D
713903693100228609 2016-03-26 01:41:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I feel like Ballad of the Wind Fish isn't a theme often mentioned when Zelda themes are discussed, it's one of my faves!
713903022368116737 2016-03-26 01:38:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Though Marin's cool, yes, the first thing I thought about was the potential good music, I really love video game music guys
713902716947312640 2016-03-26 01:37:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> Does this mean we get some sort of remix of the Ballad of the Wind Fish?! :Ohttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/713902200120979460
713752433223012354 2016-03-26 15:40:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Good morning everyone! I have a feeling today's gonna be a good one, I hope yours is too! :D

713599331773718528 2016-03-25 05:31:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Felt kinda down at the start of the day, but I quickly shook that off, today was great, hope yours was too, g'night! :D
713566080770256896 2016-03-25 03:19:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw you're messing around with Tweetdeck's scheduled tweets and 5 years in advance is too short for the joke tweet you wanna make
713545044372758528 2016-03-25 01:56:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TheJWittz I subbed to NPower the month before they announced their end. Still have the few issues I got and really like them.
713460908375339011 2016-03-25 20:21:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tai1sy I feel this so much

713415764703727616 2016-03-25 17:22:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Don't underestimate how powerful positive or negative thinking can be.
713415700954546176 2016-03-25 17:22:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 nothing bad has happened, I just need to learn from what I didn't do and keep moving forward.
713415536093204480 2016-03-25 17:21:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> I've been thinking back on things I regret not doing in my life and it's frustrating me, I'm basically forcing today to be a bad one when
713394403600011265 2016-03-25 15:57:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Once I get the game, I'll let you know how that Classic Lunatic run goes

713167007131152384 2016-03-24 00:53:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @TreeckoloverPat I know, it's at max and I still want them larger, haha
713166063064604672 2016-03-24 00:50:14 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat My only complaint with Tweetdeck is that the columns are too small for my liking, but it's pretty cool :P
713157498509729792 2016-03-24 00:16:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I don't wanna talk about it.
713156851295064064 2016-03-24 00:13:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 This is no joke the 4th time a 'mon who I think is best for the gym dies right before I take it on.
713156706436403200 2016-03-24 00:13:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> So Yggdrasil the Roserade was my main force for Volkner, no one else can really do it was well. She's dead.
713126536862302208 2016-03-24 22:13:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby haha, well don't get the *cheapest*, go for like third cheapest :P
713126224843788288 2016-03-24 22:11:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby I feel like decently priced, long lasting earbuds are hard to come by, hate having to buy like 4-5 earbuds a year :/
713124170184327169 2016-03-24 22:03:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> 1 week until I get to know what all the hype is around the Erased finale. Haven't waited weekly for a show like this in years, it's exciting
713072646129262592 2016-03-24 18:39:01 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh man, the new Erased is the last one? Interesting. Also, I have to wait a week to see it on Hulu. Oof :P
713025990310531072 2016-03-24 15:33:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @catsruntokyo @TreeckoloverPat Oh well never mind then :P

712970019223633924 2016-03-24 11:51:13 UTC <SilverScizor753> I had a dream an awesome looking tornado was heading towards me then my phone rang and my alarm went ofd right when I answered
712842845711773697 2016-03-23 03:25:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed You're pretty cool too I guess. Keep doing that for a while. <3 <3

703262688252600320 2016-02-26 16:57:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm mainly stupidly happy that everyone who thought Z was guaranteed was wrong hahahahaha
703262509776568320 2016-02-26 16:57:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Thoughts on Sun and Moon? Wish it wasn't revealed early but cool I guess
703226280032907264 2016-02-26 14:33:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Bumping this Zilly thing I made, cuz I'm so confident it won't be Z and I'm ready to laugh at everyone XD
703205506190422016 2016-02-26 13:10:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> 2 hours until all is revealed. Then 3 more hours until I find out cuz I have 3 classes in a row RIP
703089511522131968 2016-02-25 05:29:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Oh yeah, do that then, good night :D
703088975997566977 2016-02-25 05:27:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I did a large majority of my hw at school cuz I found the time, if u can't find the time then do it now
702926507895750656 2016-02-25 18:41:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @CosmicPandaWfls Technically, Gen V broke that with B2W2, those are a sequel pair, rather than just the one extra :P
702921353763008512 2016-02-25 18:21:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @mechon_m808 Actually, they didn't trademark "Water Blue", according to Bulbapedia :P
702901145480486912 2016-02-25 17:01:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> omg the entire Internet is exploding over this little thing this is so dumb hahaha
702899261055238144 2016-02-25 16:53:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I have pretty much the same no expectations mindset though
702899178855231488 2016-02-25 16:53:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon I'm really only bugged that they (potentially) got leaked, rather than the actual content.
702897106420281345 2016-02-25 16:45:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat it was so easily confirmed for whatever reason is just dumb and I love that my time to laugh at them all is near XD
702896494320353282 2016-02-25 16:42:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Like I don't care if Z was a thing (as long as it wasn't a lame third version) but just the fact that so many ppl thought
702895416593940480 2016-02-25 16:38:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @RenaeCollects I hate how so many things are ruined by spoils and leaks. Can't we just let something be revealed when it intends to be?
702894796516397056 2016-02-25 16:35:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Well that's something most of us expected I thought :P
702894707286736897 2016-02-25 16:35:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I make way to big of a deal about this, but I'm so ready to laugh at all the "Z confirmed" people XD
702894539132915712 2016-02-25 16:34:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hey you know what isn't trademarked? "Pokmon Z" that means it won't be happening right get rekt internet you were wrong
702894321658245120 2016-02-25 16:34:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Nomppie Continue holding cuz it's unconfirmed :P
702856482786676736 2016-02-25 14:03:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Sylvaur Pokmon trademarks a ton of things for some reasons, so it could be fake. Topaz, Grey, Crimson, and Scarlet are some unused TMs
702610766029950976 2016-02-24 21:47:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ckfenimore Happy Birthday! I hope your day has been and continues to be a great one! :D

702543291749765120 2016-02-24 17:19:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 This won't be the silliest thing I've done, but it will be up there, potentially :P
702543007573094400 2016-02-24 17:18:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hahahaha, I love how I will go to ridiculous lengths for a good laugh, even if said lengths will go to nothing, you'll see what I mean soon.
702503334377164800 2016-02-24 14:40:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time Did you check your face?
702488943212691456 2016-02-24 13:43:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @MrMime_Time Ah okay, that clears that up then
702488375433924608 2016-02-24 13:40:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time Serebii says it, but where did *they* get it from?
702482342560952320 2016-02-24 13:16:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat There will be much salt. It will be hilarious.

702480182641164288 2016-02-24 13:08:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 This has just not been my week, bit I hope yours has been well
702480018530676736 2016-02-24 13:07:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> First thing I realized this morning is that I forgot to turn in hw, missing a THIRD deadline this week ugh I hate my memory
702339417613144066 2016-02-23 03:49:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @GirafarigTree @Azurillkirby Yes

702289388785405952 2016-02-23 00:30:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Eh, life's too boring without a little insanity ;P Anyway, best of luck to you friend :P
702288474263592960 2016-02-23 00:26:34 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat That's a lot to deal with, hang in there and power through it, you'll get your time to rest eventually :D
702285691602927616 2016-02-23 00:15:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @YFYGuy Eh, maybe. (nice art tho)
702284800518819840 2016-02-23 00:11:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed Your hair is neither cubed shaped, Wright shaped, or Edgeworth shaped. I better see this fixed post-haircut.
702279446577827840 2016-02-23 23:50:42 UTC <SilverScizor753> So if you ever wanted to know the chance of getting 721 shinies consecutively, it's 1 in this number https://www4f.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP18981f3061ii55hiia2i000019bigbiai4g69067?MSPStoreType=image/gif&s=25

702174971045421056 2016-02-23 16:55:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat She must not be credited then, which is odd, but it's happened before.
702161104571494400 2016-02-23 16:00:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @DeckerStag @TadBitDiGital I wish the best for you both, take care and see you later my friends.

701778146073313280 2016-02-22 14:38:43 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Ugh I just hate school sometimes
701778066134007808 2016-02-22 14:38:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Like I'm doing well in two of my classes, but in the other two I'm just doing horribly in I need to get my act together
701777780543913984 2016-02-22 14:37:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ugh, I just found out I was too busy worrying about other hw to realize I completely missed a deadline, further denting that grade ugh
701776879875784704 2016-02-22 14:33:41 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pokemonr4reel17 Of course, the above could be a lie as well. Now you don't know what's truth and what isn't, hehehe.
701776619577278468 2016-02-22 14:32:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pokemonr4reel17 It's all good, besides I *could* be masquerading as a human to trick you all. Of course I wouldn't tell you if it were true
701775194021457920 2016-02-22 14:26:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Pokemonr4reel17 Shhhhh, don't reveal my secrets! D:

700190782267916288 2016-02-17 05:31:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> I was supposed to go to bed early today. I'm up in like 6 and a half hours. Well, good night you hilarious, wonderful people! :D
700190132016541696 2016-02-17 05:28:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @DeckerStag I'm just gonna devolve into spouting random quotes in broken order, some not even in SA2. It will be grand.
700189976776937472 2016-02-17 05:27:54 UTC <SilverScizor753> @DeckerStag Faker. Eating words. Aw shoot troublemaker. Found you. Fake around here. Showing black creatures a thing or two.

699746486649622528 2016-02-16 00:05:37 UTC <SilverScizor753> One of the most obnoxious things ever is never having money for the things you want. Or when something unexpectedly crushes your hype.

698965407248453632 2016-02-14 20:21:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> Ugh, I'm feeling obnoxiously unmotivated today, like I can't find something to sit down and enjoy. Hope everyone else is having a good one
698899017313308673 2016-02-14 15:58:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> I hope all of you, single or in a relationship, have a wonderful day today!! :D

698659409367404546 2016-02-13 00:05:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Just shoot me a DM or something if you can :D
698658965790457858 2016-02-13 00:04:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 So if anyone can hook me up with two Mew codes I'd be very much appreciative ^_^
698658772906938369 2016-02-13 00:03:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> So apparently the GameStops in my area use code cards now instead of wireless, and of course they're out.
698588782061223936 2016-02-13 19:25:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Guys this is super easy to understand and totally didn't take me 5 minutes to forge together. For real tho, love you guys
698587439305084928 2016-02-13 19:19:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> Happy #InternetFriendDay you guys are all amazing, never don't not forget to not un-remember that!

698544962342813696 2016-02-13 16:31:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 POOP ON THE SIDEWALK!!
698544931929874434 2016-02-13 16:31:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> So I stepped in dog poop today, and I didn't see it cuz it was on the sidewalk and I wasn't looking at the sidewalk CUZ THERE SHOULDN'T BE
698366438927499265 2016-02-12 04:41:48 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Have a good night! <3 :)
698345230144114688 2016-02-12 03:17:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat This is completely normal, just carry on.
698259418115231744 2016-02-12 21:36:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @AzureRosebloom @Seven_Cubed @Pokemonr4reel17 Well cubes, or dice, are commonly rolled, so yes. Yes he is
698214505344475140 2016-02-12 18:38:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @GirafarigTree Hai hello hi! <3 :D
698208311976398848 2016-02-12 18:13:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed ...
698208042425278464 2016-02-12 18:12:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 going or where it came from but just remember you're awesome and continue being awesome :D <3
698207902314528768 2016-02-12 18:11:50 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753  own way. Just stay positive, remember your strengths and good points, but work to improvement. I don't know where this is-
698207797264003072 2016-02-12 18:11:25 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 It's easy to be down on yourself or think you're inferior to others, but just remember you're you and you're great in your-
698207345986240512 2016-02-12 18:09:38 UTC <SilverScizor753> I always tell myself "I'm almost never down on myself" or that's uncharacteristic, but I've recently realized that I actually am very often.
697955035259338753 2016-02-11 01:27:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Weird how they took it off so quickly
697954673831981056 2016-02-11 01:25:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Wait there was an emotes only mode?

697655185967943680 2016-02-10 05:35:32 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 it and it just sucks D: Also I meant "wasn't planning*"
697654874264064000 2016-02-10 05:34:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Like I was planning on getting it all, just the $15 fighter DLC, but the deal is so good now and I can't take advantage of
697654381617897474 2016-02-10 05:32:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> Persona 4 Arena Ultimax with all of its DLC is on sale at $50 instead of $100 and the fact that I won't be able to get it really bums D:
697627311315619841 2016-02-10 03:44:46 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 All thanks to the tiny bits of healing from the Shell Bell! Unfortunately, we did get another death in Mercury the Crobat.
697627011850764288 2016-02-10 03:43:35 UTC <SilverScizor753> Update on the Platinum Wedlocke I'm doing, beat Fantina & Barry today, Hera the Luxio really came through, surviving with 1 HP against both
697599933382205440 2016-02-10 01:55:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mechon_m808 People have a lot to rant about, don't want everybody to see it I guess
697579328129740800 2016-02-10 00:34:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> @CheeseyPokemon Take care and see you soon! <3
697550025165926400 2016-02-10 22:37:40 UTC <SilverScizor753> These are probably things only I wonder, but what's the in-universe explanation for shiny locking? :P
697480177417256960 2016-02-10 18:00:07 UTC <SilverScizor753> Magiana looks veeery similar to Diancie, then Diancie shows in Shuffle. COINCIDENCE?! I think not.https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/697479302779052033
697478480582160384 2016-02-10 17:53:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22  to one in the previous gen isn't impossible, Regigigas for example
697478423791292417 2016-02-10 17:53:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SSamic22 I'd argue the striking resemblance to Diancie leans it more towards some sort of relation to Gen VI, then again a legend relating
697465141072244736 2016-02-10 17:00:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's not exactly removing a feature if it's still in the game, but just slightly more obscurehttps://twitter.com/Siliconera/status/697452406599237632
697421127052734464 2016-02-10 14:05:28 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Is that bad? :P
697421001261346816 2016-02-10 14:04:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> I know I said no hopes, but a small part of me hopes it's Gen VII/not Z so I can laugh in the faces of all who assumed Z was guaranteed
697418176682852352 2016-02-10 13:53:45 UTC <SilverScizor753> For real tho, I'm approaching this the way I always do: no assumptions or expectations, just watch and wait
697414694374494208 2016-02-10 13:39:55 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TadBitDiGital OMG I'm so ready
697414284158996480 2016-02-10 13:38:17 UTC <SilverScizor753> What does Robo-Diancie mean for the series? I'll be waiting to see and watch salty fans crying "Z CONFIRMED"
697273631043244032 2016-02-09 04:19:23 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @AzureRosebloom Some very toxic people, especially specific fandoms. Just be wary of where you go ;)
697273163663613952 2016-02-09 04:17:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @AzureRosebloom Be careful on Tumblr, I've heard horror stories of the place :P
697164455080124416 2016-02-09 21:05:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Keep in mind this is yet another rumor.
697088682361139200 2016-02-09 16:04:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FireandtheFlame @Seven_Cubed I eventually did yes, but only 30 min after I initially intended to go to bed :P
697088323190296576 2016-02-09 16:03:02 UTC <SilverScizor753> Speaking of streaming, he's streaming right now, come hang out http://twitch.tv/7cubed
697088087067787265 2016-02-09 16:02:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 To be fair though, it's all my fault. And by mine I mean @Seven_Cubed cuz I was up late at his stream last night
697087923959640064 2016-02-09 16:01:26 UTC <SilverScizor753> 6:10-8:29, not sleepy 8:30, class starts 8:31, sleepy OH COME ON
696856537214550017 2016-02-08 00:42:00 UTC <SilverScizor753> @FireandtheFlame If only you said "Delpluminatias"
696841672525676544 2016-02-08 23:42:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time @Azurillkirby @Seven_Cubed How old really is Pikachu though? And R.O.B.'s age is pretty indeterminant, also gender neutral :P
696840747400597505 2016-02-08 23:39:15 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time @Azurillkirby @Seven_Cubed Are you saying their age is irrelevant just because they're not human, wow #NonhumanLivesMatter
696840404797300737 2016-02-08 23:37:53 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @Azurillkirby @MrMime_Time Young adult is debateable, but it's not too alien for the Villager to be a kid.
696754652725948417 2016-02-08 17:57:08 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat $80 iirc
696563493584023552 2016-02-07 05:17:33 UTC <SilverScizor753> Hung out a fun stream, did my first speedrun, and had a chill evening; great day today, hope yours was and future ones will be, good night!
696562867206639616 2016-02-07 05:15:03 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Look at that, I was right :P
696552397246566401 2016-02-07 04:33:27 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 I mainly need to learn a ton of the tricks and not suck at the game, cuz holy Hylia I was infuriatingly bad at some parts
696551997953015808 2016-02-07 04:31:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 Yeah I thought it was a great idea to run a game for the first time I haven't touched in years with zero practice :P
696551511195684864 2016-02-07 04:29:56 UTC <SilverScizor753> Oh yeah I did a speedrun todaypic.twitter.com/91PFnTWQO2
696520117803315202 2016-02-07 02:25:11 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ozyxwvut If we're getting a game this year, judging by past trends, we'll get an announcement by April at the latest.
696519944851197952 2016-02-07 02:24:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @ozyxwvut It hasn't been that long, imo, but I don't think it's been the longest wait ever. Besides, an announcement this month makes sense.
696515411198681088 2016-02-07 02:06:29 UTC <SilverScizor753> Really though, people were expecting an announcement?! Seriously?! And didn't we already know they'd just shorten the ad anyway?
696515122399842306 2016-02-07 02:05:20 UTC <SilverScizor753> To everyone who was expecting more from the Pokmon ad or an announcement. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
696514838495821828 2016-02-07 02:04:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mechon_m808 But we knew that already. Didn't everyone know that?
696511541043007489 2016-02-07 01:51:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> It's interesting how so many people are split on which musicians are best/not great and I'm just like "ha I don't care about any of them"
696418620436418560 2016-02-07 19:41:52 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mechon_m808 Also, this is supposed to say "he usually" and I just can't win today D:
696418418073800704 2016-02-07 19:41:04 UTC <SilverScizor753> @mechon_m808 And to rub salt in the wound, I see that I misspelled "occasions" but I posted the tweet too quickly.
696418082001068032 2016-02-07 19:39:44 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 For reference, on multiple occassions @mechon_m808 and I have made the same joke and usually beats me to it
696417974056415232 2016-02-07 19:39:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> tfw Twitch tricks you into thinking you're first on a joke D:pic.twitter.com/P0tJ8lvcN3

696102952038068224 2016-02-06 22:47:31 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I know right, people are just waaaay too desperate for anything at this point -_-
696102563221938176 2016-02-06 22:45:58 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat The Super Bowl. Pokmon's commercial specifically and people are hoping/expecting an announcement.
696102219322494977 2016-02-06 22:44:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> I'm expecting a ton of salt from Pokfans tomorrow and the fact that that might happen is interesting/hilarious. XD
696058572078067712 2016-02-06 19:51:10 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Tai1sie Yes, even if it's something next to no one was even there for.
696051532605759489 2016-02-06 19:23:12 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Seven_Cubed @PinkSeaVillage Wow I just realized this I say no every time and it's never gone away, ugh.

695702512762884097 2016-02-05 20:16:19 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MasaeAnela Reminds me of the time someone found pants in the elementary lost and found. This was before changing to gym clothes.

695376058745356292 2016-02-04 22:39:06 UTC <SilverScizor753> Apparently some people pronounce crayon as "cran". I have NEVER heard this ever in my life.
695120190078496768 2016-02-03 05:42:22 UTC <SilverScizor753> @callieviolet29 Glad I'm not the only one who does this :P

695113150039924736 2016-02-03 05:14:24 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I've never had a nightmare so vivid like that, especially one reoccuring, but I can only imagine how it must feel
695112334449070080 2016-02-03 05:11:09 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat So I guess, and I know I always say something to this effect, just try to keep your head up and stay positive :D :P
695112130056450048 2016-02-03 05:10:21 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Those are some scary nightmares, but remember they are just that: nightmares, not future premonitions or anything
695089054832955393 2016-02-03 03:38:39 UTC <SilverScizor753> @MrMime_Time @TreeckoloverPat @Shuckle4ever19 Well I guess it does a good job as an ad, that's not the main purpose, just my thoughts tho
695087757572485120 2016-02-03 03:33:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @MrMime_Time @Shuckle4ever19 I'd say it's more of a celebration, not an advertisement :P

693606952132194304 2016-01-30 01:29:18 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat can explain spoiler free, doesn't do as much as the main game does. This is just imo though.
693606898067570689 2016-01-30 01:29:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I'd still say the main game's story is more important, that's where most of everything gets settled. Postgame, as best as I
693605133750398977 2016-01-30 01:22:05 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Point still stands, more of the plot happens in the main game.
693604006527049728 2016-01-30 01:17:36 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I still think the main game is more important, not to say the postgame isn't important, cuz it is.

693603921789497344 2016-01-30 01:17:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I didn't even know there was a guidebook. Plus "pre" means before, and that doesn't really make sense. Besides, a majority
693602470501552128 2016-01-30 01:11:30 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat I wouldn't really call it the "pre-game", it's the main game. The postgame is important, but the main game is the bulk
693276939117686784 2016-01-29 03:37:57 UTC <SilverScizor753> @SilverScizor753 it overall...all that, and a toilet!

692890473237581826 2016-01-28 02:02:16 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Riders has plot? Now I'm curious.
692881561071460353 2016-01-28 01:26:51 UTC <SilverScizor753> @Azurillkirby Do people even think? Do people hear rumors and just stop and think, cuz it doesn't seem like they do.

691764430678441985 2016-01-25 23:27:47 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat Well, the idea is that all types of people no matter the age, gender, or race can and do enjoy Pokmon, that's the lead up.

690209987939942401 2016-01-21 16:30:59 UTC <SilverScizor753> @TreeckoloverPat @Sylvaur Yes, I remember Darkrai & Shaymin (Arceus was intended to be too) were like that, why aren't events like this?
