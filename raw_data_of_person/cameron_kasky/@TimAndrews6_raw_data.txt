971589123428544512 2018-03-07 03:31:12 UTC <TimAndrews6> @HuffPost @nvisser He got his 8 hours of fame. Sad he looked like a loonitic.

971144872660029442 2018-03-06 22:05:55 UTC <TimAndrews6> @Amy_Siskind About F-ing time I would have thought that would have been gone when this 60 year old was still going to school.
971143282607697921 2018-03-06 21:59:36 UTC <TimAndrews6> @kylegriffin1 You've been President long enough for us to know when you say "Believe me" it's a lie.
970854261105070080 2018-03-05 02:51:08 UTC <TimAndrews6> @CNN Great job kids!

970388053369020418 2018-03-04 19:58:35 UTC <TimAndrews6> @politvidchannel And if we're lucky Trump won't have squandered them all away before he's out of office.
969740667491667969 2018-03-02 01:06:06 UTC <TimAndrews6> @ddale8 You're got to be kidding.
969737860244008960 2018-03-02 00:54:57 UTC <TimAndrews6> @Rosie @JustineBateman Even better get water systems and sewage systems on an infrastructure Bill. No way will it fly as a  public private partnership.  Good luck.
969734707914125312 2018-03-02 00:42:25 UTC <TimAndrews6> @CNN Most people think the National Inquire isn't worth 5 minutes of their time.
969732567871127554 2018-03-02 00:33:55 UTC <TimAndrews6> @CNN Give Orin a break, he's an old bigot.
969731898871369728 2018-03-02 00:31:16 UTC <TimAndrews6> @foxandfriends @TomiLahren Great we have to watch Entertainment and maybe some news tomorrow to see what the bigot has to say. If only she realised there are 350 million people in the US. The 5 million NRA Members are a drop in the bucket.
969730424837558272 2018-03-02 00:25:24 UTC <TimAndrews6> @Reuters Yes cheaper Bourbon for us.
969729383396233217 2018-03-02 00:21:16 UTC <TimAndrews6> @kdrum @MotherJones So sad. He needs to go, and before he's not reelected.

969366538951233536 2018-03-01 00:19:27 UTC <TimAndrews6> @thinkprogress Now that's crass even for Fox Entertainment and maybe some news.

969332438781562882 2018-03-01 22:03:57 UTC <TimAndrews6> @Newsweek I don't know anyone who robbed a bank but if I were a Senator I would still support no bank robberies.
969017937813233666 2018-02-28 01:14:14 UTC <TimAndrews6> @ShaunKing It's not just there but the others as well. Especially New Town. We have some of the best nuts in the world.

967210677248151553 2018-02-23 01:32:50 UTC <TimAndrews6> @AltStateDpt Did you ever wonder why there same people aren't clambering for SAMs, mortars and the like. What's the difference they're all military weapons.
967194785059569667 2018-02-23 00:29:41 UTC <TimAndrews6> @AltStateDpt He must have been in a school, and I know he's been to Andrews So He's been on a military base.  How could he not notice the difference?

966559595232718849 2018-02-21 06:25:39 UTC <TimAndrews6> Can someone tell me how to block someone?
966558239587553280 2018-02-21 06:20:16 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jaketapper @jesuispret_3239 That's fine I said nothing I'm ashamed of. I didn't make things up and I didn't like a post an hour after complaining to someone who was trying to help someone find their beloved pet. So take a xanex and go to bed.
966554247776137216 2018-02-21 06:04:25 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jaketapper @jesuispret_3239 All Dachshunds are diggers that's why we don't let them out alone. But you may and I don't mean to be catty want to see a mental health counselor because you are setting yourself up for a tragic event.
966552337954365440 2018-02-21 05:56:49 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jaketapper @jesuispret_3239 I have 9 Champion dachshunds. In the last 16 years I've had 1 wander off. She dug her way out from under the fence. No matter how much you care SHIT HAPPENS. That's life it happens with pets it happens with us. So stop being a dick to people you don't know and are making up fact
966544402226270208 2018-02-21 05:25:17 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jaketapper @jesuispret_3239 I agree with you that dogs should be keep on a leash but shit happens and on rair occasion they wander off through accidental happenings. The post didn't say we were out without a leash, that you added all on you own. So please keep your judging and scolding for people who need..
966509529855913984 2018-02-21 03:06:43 UTC <TimAndrews6> @brryyccceee Thanks I'm 60 we didn't have that.  I think I was15 before Iceys.
966509137789181958 2018-02-21 03:05:09 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jpodhoretz @BillKristol @asymmetricinfo @realDonaldTrump @DShaywitz Wrong you don't have to tell most people talking with people who have been through a trama  to be Empathetic.
966507361337856000 2018-02-21 02:58:06 UTC <TimAndrews6> @djrothkopf @JRubinBlogger Don't know I'm the 49% for unfit. What would be interesting is to know of the 49% fit how many served one or more terms in the military.  I think you would find more exmilitary  in the unfit.
966505896347086849 2018-02-21 02:52:17 UTC <TimAndrews6> @JohnJHarwood Amazing you don't pay more than one hundred thousand dollars to cover up a faithful relationship though some 42% of the GOP seem to think you may.
966496296826793984 2018-02-21 02:14:08 UTC <TimAndrews6> @JohnJHarwood Sure Claudia all Dems have Make America Great hats. It's us independentes that don't.

966491294037135360 2018-02-21 01:54:15 UTC <TimAndrews6> @thehill Of course they do. But I bet they are for an alcohol & tobacco age limit.
966469860510314496 2018-02-21 00:29:05 UTC <TimAndrews6> @AltStateDpt @wmjkids If he does it's probably so he can remember the number
966469610970247168 2018-02-21 00:28:06 UTC <TimAndrews6> @MollyJongFast Sad to say but you're probably correct
966468899742076933 2018-02-21 00:25:16 UTC <TimAndrews6> @ddale8 And I'm old enough to know you're either reading without your bifocals, which is why you didn't understand or you intentionally didn't understand and am buying into the media fake news BS

964667838882607104 2018-02-16 01:08:30 UTC <TimAndrews6> @kristincake YES!
964667466910720001 2018-02-16 01:07:01 UTC <TimAndrews6> @ChelseaClinton @boothheather Thanks for the moving and thoughtful argument I wish more people would read it in its totally.
964665076404969472 2018-02-16 00:57:31 UTC <TimAndrews6> @ABC To hell with the victims and their survivors
964664422848397313 2018-02-16 00:54:55 UTC <TimAndrews6> @marcorubio Which is exactly what your doing. I've heard of no one in the media or victims getting 3 million from THE NRA, but you.
964660626743230464 2018-02-16 00:39:50 UTC <TimAndrews6> @Comey @krassenstein @GaleMcdonnell @Ammo_Bundy @darby_bartley @mousejax Like our president

964654229087547395 2018-02-16 00:14:25 UTC <TimAndrews6> @jk_rowling That's most likely not American. No body talks like that, and most schools have armed guards including that one just wasn't in that building.
964649600543084544 2018-02-16 23:56:01 UTC <TimAndrews6> @bishopk0s She's the one that needs to shut up
964344298941698048 2018-02-15 03:42:52 UTC <TimAndrews6> @lyliahmtaylor @sarahchad_ What a freaking disgrace of a man. Part of the me generation I just want to slap him
964335475199758336 2018-02-15 03:07:48 UTC <TimAndrews6> @PaulBegala @farhip I think that's safe assumptions
964308633415757826 2018-02-15 01:21:08 UTC <TimAndrews6> @NicolleDWallace Don't worry kid you not going to please everyone. Intel isn't 100% correct and some don't understand that.
964260948684017666 2018-02-15 22:11:39 UTC <TimAndrews6> @CBSNews You just want your millions from the NRA
963425284207849478 2018-02-13 14:51:01 UTC <TimAndrews6> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Wow you've really sold your sole for this job. Even so I've not seen anyone saying you hate America.  You should be ashamed.
962153385943281664 2018-02-09 02:36:57 UTC <TimAndrews6> @realDonaldTrump Dream on
962143063702409217 2018-02-09 01:55:56 UTC <TimAndrews6> @AdyBarkan Could it be that the center doesn't believe the government should be shut down even for dreamers and if you want control of Congress you will need the center. Perhaps alienating them isn't a good idea.
962140934250082304 2018-02-09 01:47:29 UTC <TimAndrews6> @johnlundin A perfect example of the ugly American.
