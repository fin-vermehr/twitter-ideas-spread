762984743893733376 2016-08-09 12:11:53 UTC <tehandy121> Donald Trump says he wants to make the tax code simpler, so you don't have to use turbotax or any other service.

715187060588417024 2016-03-30 14:40:57 UTC <tehandy121> It really grinds my gears when people say that the word of God is absolute so therefore it will trump mankind's law. #LGBT #Hypocrisie
