971751397237673984 2018-03-08 14:16:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Lies to his lawyers, ignores their advice, doesnt pay his bills. Client from hell.
971747837452091392 2018-03-08 14:01:53 UTC <gaughran444> @smithsonian @NancyPelosi Go Nancy! Keep speaking!
971745694099918848 2018-03-08 13:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @radmac52 Yes. So much of our system was premised on an assumption of basic decency. All bets are off now.
971744810838188032 2018-03-08 13:49:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF @JamilSmith No question. A spectacularly bad idea.
971738125587435521 2018-03-08 13:23:17 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Preposterous idea espoused by people whose kids will never be in a school with armed teachers.
971733284551057413 2018-03-08 13:04:03 UTC <gaughran444> @brianefallon Shifty little cracker.

971727700862885888 2018-03-08 12:41:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Really - cant get full security clearance but can represent the US in a foreign state? We need new rules when these crooks are gone.
971726777872801792 2018-03-08 12:38:12 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Seriously. Has she said anything?
971589217137643521 2018-03-07 03:31:35 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @misslaneym How lovely. Thank you.

971580959895285761 2018-03-07 02:58:46 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @wavotingjustice Spectacular!!!
971576089884725248 2018-03-07 02:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich What if Russia interfered with a US election and neither the president nor his party lifted a finger to protect our nation? Watch the news.

971563951564697601 2018-03-07 01:51:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Our whole nation is going to need a good shower when this is all over.
971562885326438400 2018-03-07 01:46:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Another goddamned low point brought to us by trump. Those kind, majestic creatures, that deeply deficient excuse  for a man.
971562317216436225 2018-03-07 01:44:41 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris @JoyAnnReid Yes - States Rights get tossed when they want mass deportation.
971561898670985221 2018-03-07 01:43:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Id love to see those two go down.
971555610805358597 2018-03-07 01:18:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 This is disgraceful.

971545645650718721 2018-03-07 00:38:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen I once got the Osmond Bros One Bad Apple stuck in my head all day and started experiencing suicidal ideation.
971544505584406528 2018-03-07 00:33:55 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Trump should meet with Mueller and go totally Vinny the Chin on him. Bathrobe and all.

971499541085282309 2018-03-07 21:35:14 UTC <gaughran444> @car_nove That would be a vast improvement.
971499130643275776 2018-03-07 21:33:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate What a wholly deficient person. If she gave a damn about these kids, shed speak with them and call for a ban on assault weapons.
971497956930150402 2018-03-07 21:28:57 UTC <gaughran444> @GeorgeLatimer37 Yes in bedford.  And thank you for your tireless efforts.

971440918237769734 2018-03-07 17:42:18 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Of course. The nerve of him to face them.
971440616872792064 2018-03-07 17:41:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Adorable. Soulmates.
971440166396203009 2018-03-07 17:39:18 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Impeached? They would have tried to lynch him. Can you imagine?

971431481053605888 2018-03-07 17:04:48 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Seriously. Subpoena time.
971422949780721665 2018-03-07 16:30:54 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC Todays republicans still blow my mind. Did they ever believe in anything? States rights, deficits, evil Russia - was it all a charade?
971421627857633281 2018-03-07 16:25:38 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Dangerous imbecile.
971421338433916928 2018-03-07 16:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC An education secretary who gave a hoot in hell about public school students would be calling for an assault weapon ban. #GunControlNow
971375379016568832 2018-03-07 13:21:52 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Exactly. Like deficit hawks. A bunch of bs.
971247101823848448 2018-03-06 04:52:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen This occurred to me. The word steel probably makes him mad now.

971177941932691457 2018-03-06 00:17:19 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB Is this the baby girl who loved the portrait?

970850547027927041 2018-03-05 02:36:22 UTC <gaughran444> I love Ron Reagan. Not the bad president, his son. A real stand up guy.
970845879530860544 2018-03-05 02:17:49 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden This is so deeply upsetting. I hope trump meets with the brutal fate he deserves.

970750952788676608 2018-03-05 20:00:37 UTC <gaughran444> @DonCheadle What????
970746308918239232 2018-03-05 19:42:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Seriously. Why is Madame Mushroom Cloud back?
970743594784034816 2018-03-05 19:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Trump Breeze sounds like something malodorous that you should probably stay far away from.
970741895705096192 2018-03-05 19:24:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MercyForAnimals Dont eat bacon. Tastes good but just dont. Pigs are nice, smart animals. You can live without it. Just like you dont eat dogs.

970134141772713985 2018-03-03 03:09:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith Horrific. Prosecutor should serve at least as long as this poor man did.

969764216021422080 2018-03-02 02:39:41 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Hes mercurial, sycophantic and useless. Occasionally says something sensible, seemingly at random points. One of the good republicans.

967950749895462912 2018-02-25 02:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll This is a potential disaster. Very concerned.
967950589878513664 2018-02-25 02:32:58 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce @kathleenhussein Yeah. I think RBG should have bailed early in Obamas second term bc if she dies were stuck with a trump judge. But she DF seems fine.
967945054898802690 2018-02-25 02:10:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Why do we decry every type of discrimination but age discrimination? Dont get it.

967862495141617665 2018-02-25 20:42:55 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 No, just hang with the right people.
967857959391973376 2018-02-25 20:24:54 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I attribute it to age discrimination, which is particularly virulent against women. I held the same view when I was young. We devalue wisdom

966819705477623810 2018-02-22 23:39:15 UTC <gaughran444> @jgreenSTPA My parents were teachers. I tremble at the thought of them being responsible for winning a shoot-out. Utter lunacy.
966773519618109440 2018-02-22 20:35:43 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Good point. Its all hallucinatory bullshit.
966773305284886530 2018-02-22 20:34:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes yes yes.
966771177782960128 2018-02-22 20:26:25 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio And the importance of this as children get gunned down at school is . . . . ?
966770495411671041 2018-02-22 20:23:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MtnMD The mafia just shoot each other.

966658625543573504 2018-02-22 12:59:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Cops oppose this idea you horses ass. They also oppose you.
966655323099533319 2018-02-22 12:46:03 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast What?
966647939723595776 2018-02-22 12:16:42 UTC <gaughran444> @resisterhood @BreeNewsome Good point.
966645815325360128 2018-02-22 12:08:16 UTC <gaughran444> @News12WC This is why police want gun control.
966643538606870531 2018-02-22 11:59:13 UTC <gaughran444> @girlsreallyrule Love this guy.

966595435698761728 2018-02-22 08:48:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MercyForAnimals Poor baby.
966516513925672960 2018-02-21 03:34:28 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara And lower the voting age to 16.
966515055184531458 2018-02-21 03:28:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 She thinks if she says the word crazy enough this will go away.
966511596846624768 2018-02-21 03:14:56 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Post-utero life doesnt do it for them.
966511441351192576 2018-02-21 03:14:19 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @BetoORourke Nice first amendment case.
966502511136849920 2018-02-21 02:38:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila What we had. Painful.
966502099298242561 2018-02-21 02:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Schmuck.
966501713053208581 2018-02-21 02:35:39 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol @Phil_Lewis_ The bravery and presence of these people is amazing. I dont know how they do it. Heroes.
966488411543625728 2018-02-21 01:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Red. Like the fing MAGA hats.
966384207034535939 2018-02-21 18:48:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Thank you very much. Done. Shall we call/email these companies as well? Happy to.
966381809985564672 2018-02-21 18:39:12 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The police in my family detest you. FYI. And stop attacking the FBI. Theyre law enforcement too.
966106352799141888 2018-02-20 00:24:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn As is the Republican Party.
966026666853224448 2018-02-20 19:07:59 UTC <gaughran444> @BrittanyWallman Excruciating. This poor baby. #GunControlNow
966026405082468352 2018-02-20 19:06:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum He is a very low form of life.
965971089854746624 2018-02-20 15:27:09 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @gailjcam I see. She was paid off to not testify. Thanks for the reminder.
965949527206318080 2018-02-20 14:01:28 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Hopefully prison.
965945961242611712 2018-02-20 13:47:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 A well-founded inferiority complex.
965945722918068224 2018-02-20 13:46:21 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast He was acquitted, no? Does that mean anything?
965938340183801856 2018-02-20 13:17:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You say nothing about an attack on the US by Russia, but take a firm stand in favor of gerrymandering. Disgraceful wretch.
965923635943833603 2018-02-20 12:18:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Exactly.
965784474758926336 2018-02-19 03:05:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind @SusaMorgan Good.
965772460120592385 2018-02-19 02:17:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind @SusaMorgan Yeah. Looking pretty Hitchcockian over there. Appropriately enough.
965771518243426304 2018-02-19 02:14:07 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj My dog gave me a dirty look and left the room. Were mending the relationship today.
965586831738855424 2018-02-19 14:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @usblm Watch this on Presidents Day.

965423240255623169 2018-02-18 03:10:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid My dog was so bummed by that. I think it hurt his ears.
965409805228748800 2018-02-18 02:16:48 UTC <gaughran444> @SopanDeb This scared my dog.
965403206217060352 2018-02-18 01:50:35 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum @michmarkowitz Oh dear.
965401172046729217 2018-02-18 01:42:30 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol How about banning them for the love of god? Who tf needs an assault rifle?
965324795217932290 2018-02-18 20:39:00 UTC <gaughran444> @OnlyShaneOrtega @DrJillStein Wow. Youve got brass ones, lady. Youve done enough harm. Go away.
965318643868413952 2018-02-18 20:14:34 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast This will accomplish nothing. Those brave kids are not calling for blood, theyre calling for gun control. #GunLawsNOW

965216065448968194 2018-02-18 13:26:57 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 We have a seething, malevolent traitor where we should have a president. Its bad.
965215744203030528 2018-02-18 13:25:40 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Tough call.
965214341233553409 2018-02-18 13:20:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound crazy and really dumb. Even more so than usual. #TrumpRussiaCollusion
965092828354408448 2018-02-17 05:17:15 UTC <gaughran444> @stuartpstevens Im going with the talented, disciplined, kind one.
965084723495227393 2018-02-17 04:45:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sick, traitorous bastard. Cant wait till your ass is hauled out of the White House. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
965084234611351553 2018-02-17 04:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @ckhorowitz I understand. Ive had friends lose dogs to them. Adore my own dog. But couldnt shoot an animal. Anyway be well. Dogs are the best.
965056677484613633 2018-02-17 02:53:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Is this a joke?
965056602846920704 2018-02-17 02:53:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @ckhorowitz I do live in the country. I see them, but I keep my dog on a leash & we all coexist. I understand the danger but could never kill an animal
965052689464942593 2018-02-17 02:37:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Why?
965036404542754816 2018-02-17 01:33:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik @Phillipasoo Oh my god. This brave brave young lady.
965015506871832577 2018-02-17 00:10:00 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @kurteichenwald Human garbage.
965012659698585605 2018-02-17 23:58:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JenGranholm He wont lead on gun safety. He wont lead on Russias attack on our country. Hes a weak, corrupt traitor and we need him out.
965004583692046336 2018-02-17 23:26:36 UTC <gaughran444> @michaelianblack @SarahThyre I would think so. What the hell is a president for if not to defend his country?
965001381726826496 2018-02-17 23:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @ChildrensTheOne @VP @SecondLady Hope no one walks in with a sub machine gun. #GunContolNow
964994261329547264 2018-02-17 22:45:35 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT Hope this catches on.
964988856964612097 2018-02-17 22:24:06 UTC <gaughran444> @BretStephensNYT @tribelaw @IantheCovington The gun lobby wants the 2nd amendment to trump all other rights but theres no legal basis for that. Just raw nerve and a lot of money.
964932481932824579 2018-02-17 18:40:05 UTC <gaughran444> @BretStephensNYT @tribelaw Right. Were stuck with the 2nd amendment. We should argue that it, like the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th & 8th, does not confer an absolute right.
964922232593178624 2018-02-17 17:59:22 UTC <gaughran444> @markberman Such a substandard person.
964921149116309504 2018-02-17 17:55:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JoyceWhiteVance Unfortunately I think its pretty clear whose side he is on.
964918780953530369 2018-02-17 17:45:39 UTC <gaughran444> @HoarseWisperer Does anyone like her enough to do an intervention? Its time.
964918396948287490 2018-02-17 17:44:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF Isnt this just disgusting?
964873469900050432 2018-02-17 14:45:36 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio How much blood money did you take from the NRA? $3 million? What would the Bible say about that?
964728038893211650 2018-02-16 05:07:42 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @DHaines1 Exactly. Hes an incredibly generous, disciplined and outlandishly talented man. She is a malignancy.
964725478354575360 2018-02-16 04:57:32 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You took $30 million from the NRA. You have blood on your tiny hands.
964714876739432449 2018-02-16 04:15:24 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahchad_ You have nothing to apologize for. You are a heroine and your nation is grateful to you.
964712940145344512 2018-02-16 04:07:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Thanks to you I turned off Brian Williams & watched this lovely guy. Much appreciated!
964697144182657027 2018-02-16 03:04:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Indeed it is. Onward!

964638914806984704 2018-02-16 23:13:34 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Are we paying for two planes for these lovebirds? I want my money back.
964637600169512961 2018-02-16 23:08:20 UTC <gaughran444> @AliWatkins Top notch prosecutors dont talk. They dont want to ruin their case.
964636543934754816 2018-02-16 23:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich STFU. How much NRA blood money did you pocket over the years?
964528710928957440 2018-02-16 15:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Black. More ominous. Like the nra.
964489082054365184 2018-02-16 13:18:11 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT @HelenKennedy Had the same thought. Perhaps his winning personality?
964488111483957254 2018-02-16 13:14:19 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Why dont you resign from the senate and go to a seminary? You seem to have a calling. And it has nothing to do with governance.
964487623636127745 2018-02-16 13:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen Not to mention he should hear people shouting Youre fucking up the environment! Because he is. And this is America. We say things.
964486979168718849 2018-02-16 13:09:49 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social Perfect.
964481894334255105 2018-02-16 12:49:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger @thehill I  LeBron. Compare his history of charitable donations to trumps. Remarkable. Hes a decent basketball player too.
964481080630882304 2018-02-16 12:46:23 UTC <gaughran444> @RobGMacfarlane Your tweets are like cool water when one has a fever. Thank you.
964359457978265606 2018-02-15 04:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum LeBron could definitely be elected Governor of Ohio. Wish he would do it.
964337440470290432 2018-02-15 03:15:36 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw She was lovely. Good dean.
964337329497309184 2018-02-15 03:15:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @tribelaw Loathe works for me.
964331859009265666 2018-02-15 02:53:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila No kidding. Shameless bullshit artist.
964331487578542080 2018-02-15 02:51:57 UTC <gaughran444> The NRA insists that 2nd amendment rights are absolute. No other const. amendment - the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th - is interpreted this way.
964315287725199360 2018-02-15 01:47:35 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Not if Dems vote. Its all about turnout.
964315089733144576 2018-02-15 01:46:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes.
964290998900752385 2018-02-15 00:11:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon @detectivelily @JimLoftus4 Sorry if that happened to you.
964290826703687685 2018-02-15 00:10:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon Warped and racist af. Nasty little cracker.
964290210178707457 2018-02-15 00:07:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB What a doll.
964289400183115776 2018-02-15 00:04:43 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon @detectivelily @JimLoftus4 Yes, but they dont want so many guns on the street. It endangers them.

964139208448372736 2018-02-15 14:07:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Perfect perfect perfect. FWIW I would buy a t-shirt/bumpersticker that says this.
964138338272907264 2018-02-15 14:04:27 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @gelles Big fucking deal. Our flag should stay at half mast until we get sensible gun control laws and start protecting our children.
964137943341457409 2018-02-15 14:02:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Popovich/Kerr 2020.
964136536907374593 2018-02-15 13:57:17 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @AriFleischer What he says means nothing. All republicans who accept money from the NRA - in his case approx $30 mil - have blood on their hands.
964133263647367170 2018-02-15 13:44:17 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @TreyYingst Oh ffs. As if these children were soldiers lost in a war? Ok - its the NRA/GOP v innocent children.
964129851383910407 2018-02-15 13:30:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AdyBarkan This is critically important. Call your congresspeople and tell them not to eviscerate the ADA.
964126650807083008 2018-02-15 13:18:00 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien @NBCNews This is extraordinary. We have a lawless White House.
964125611311685632 2018-02-15 13:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Done. Go get em Claude.

963977319974137858 2018-02-14 03:24:37 UTC <gaughran444> @FLGovScott @critic_social So strange. Hes frightening.
963977085374132224 2018-02-14 03:23:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @toocherie Very good question. There should be a protest of historic proportions at this goddamned thing.
963976536289370112 2018-02-14 03:21:30 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social Maybe they cant bear to think about their vulnerability in a country where adults wont do the one thing necessary to protect them.
963975027208196101 2018-02-14 03:15:30 UTC <gaughran444> @NYPDnews Thank you. I know most NYPD officers are in favor of gun control. Can you take the opportunity of this latest horrific shooting to say so?
963974585304666112 2018-02-14 03:13:45 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Didnt know this. How grotesque.
963973982788743169 2018-02-14 03:11:21 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social And not a syllable about how to prevent it from happening again.
963946321974583298 2018-02-14 01:21:27 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball @NBCPolitics Crazy idea: Mitt could announce tomorrow that hes running for the senate, not taking NRA $, and will help enact gun control laws.
963930473599729666 2018-02-14 00:18:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CBSNews @wsvn @NBCNews @CBSMiami @nbc6 @coach_sjkl @Melody_Ball Jesus Christ. We must revolt against the politicians bought by the NRA.
963927671158820865 2018-02-14 00:07:20 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior Love this. Thank you.
963890606706774016 2018-02-14 21:40:03 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Stop praying and start advocating for gun control. Can you? How much $ have you taken from the NRA? #stopthekilling
963887085374656514 2018-02-14 21:26:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Peter King. Hates civil liberties. Loves tax cuts for billionaires.
963886294463057920 2018-02-14 21:22:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Theyre always white, no?
963885590566653952 2018-02-14 21:20:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Putting this up in Long Island? Go for it!
963871264984137729 2018-02-14 20:23:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 No. Theres footage of her energetically arguing for Obama to produce his birth certificate.
963870006420430848 2018-02-14 20:18:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Gutsy statement.

963813460487393281 2018-02-14 16:33:30 UTC <gaughran444> @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @critic_social But theyre white so its a-okay!
963783289222901760 2018-02-14 14:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell Hes actually an enthusiastic racist. Out and proud.
963781284823695360 2018-02-14 14:25:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF Bravo!!!!! Go LDF!!
963772609145004032 2018-02-14 13:51:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn No they dont. And they revile federal law enforcement. And collude with a U.S. enemy. Historically dangerous group.
963616005158326272 2018-02-13 03:28:53 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Our country is drowning in slime.
963615135037353984 2018-02-13 03:25:25 UTC <gaughran444> @bubbaprog @NYCoach1 Damn!!
963614925271773184 2018-02-13 03:24:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelCohen212 @TrueFactsStated Can you imagine how many abortions the repulsive orange lothario underwrote in his day?
963614206380642304 2018-02-13 03:21:44 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich A fraudulent issue from a fraudulent man. Ethically compromised for decades, and keeps on talking. Impressive in a repellant way.
963577979958956032 2018-02-13 00:57:47 UTC <gaughran444> @maevehiggins And then there are the great guys at Fox News!
963574459528548353 2018-02-13 00:43:48 UTC <gaughran444> @maevehiggins Youre nicer than I am. I dont find it sad. I find it infuriating. Pulling up the drawbridge after youve got yours.
963574104682049540 2018-02-13 00:42:23 UTC <gaughran444> @maevehiggins John Kelly being a prime example.
963571392854855680 2018-02-13 00:31:37 UTC <gaughran444> @maevehiggins My Irish ancestors were destitute, uneducated and desperate & sailed in when the only requirement was that you didnt have TB. Nothing to it
963510507524317190 2018-02-13 20:29:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MercyForAnimals @ColumbiaLaw Go Natalia!
963510200916480000 2018-02-13 20:28:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Good!
963509272842833921 2018-02-13 20:24:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Detest this little cracker.
963412819508187136 2018-02-13 14:01:30 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Wholly unconvincing piece.
963403420865581057 2018-02-13 13:24:09 UTC <gaughran444> @News12WC Excellent idea.
963258472061022208 2018-02-12 03:48:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ReelQuinn Someone help that dog.
963248844220850176 2018-02-12 03:09:55 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Lincoln would have detested trump with every cell in his body and would have had nothing to do with the GOP.
963241756664967168 2018-02-12 02:41:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Manglewood Hooray!!
963241192367493125 2018-02-12 02:39:31 UTC <gaughran444> @daveweigel Ugh.
963232864379826177 2018-02-12 02:06:25 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol @MattMurph24 Terrible.

963231769477681153 2018-02-12 02:02:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @khinman The business model of insurance companies is inherently fraudulent: take money for a service you dont plan to deliver. Take them down.
963203348974456832 2018-02-12 00:09:08 UTC <gaughran444> @GeorgeLatimer37 Thank you!!
963185198383935488 2018-02-12 22:57:01 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath Sounds like bs, but if so trump reacts more quickly to Russian plane down than U.S. mass shootings & military deaths.
963178973344731136 2018-02-12 22:32:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Repulsive but really just more honest than the republicans in office. ICE is repeatedly treating immigrants as less than human.
963155453273432065 2018-02-12 20:58:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ChuckGrassley @TheJusticeDept @FBI @LindseyGrahamSC Please cut the crap. These are serious times.
963145659900506112 2018-02-12 20:19:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR @JenniWrenB I hope they loved it and keep doing it.
963144138265948160 2018-02-12 20:13:51 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Well done.
963117136632864769 2018-02-12 18:26:33 UTC <gaughran444> @kashanacauley Tell that to my niece, who is NYPD and is black. Or my sister, who is a retired cop and is black. Or my late brother in law, a black cop.
963112328098189313 2018-02-12 18:07:27 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Glad youre saying this. She might have just cashiered her country.
963112167280128000 2018-02-12 18:06:49 UTC <gaughran444> @srl This is outrageous but dont think its a  sound legal argument by any stretch of the imagination; should fail.
963111784122060801 2018-02-12 18:05:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 This really is disappointing. She cashed out.
963107673599340546 2018-02-12 17:48:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MtnMD @mzbat Bon appetit!
963107384909496320 2018-02-12 17:47:48 UTC <gaughran444> @krassenstein @tribelaw Yes and epic levels of voter participation must almost temper the reliance on Mueller. We need blue stampedes starting 11/18.
963107034534219781 2018-02-12 17:46:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MichelleObama @BarackObama @davidaxelrod These are the most modern and of-their-time portraits since JFKs. Love them.

963102498943840257 2018-02-12 17:28:23 UTC <gaughran444> @RBReich This thug is tough on war widows and easy on wife beaters. Never understood the enthusiasm for him.
963102025083957249 2018-02-12 17:26:31 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Not like WWII? Oh right, the trumps were on the other side for that one. And he skipped Vietnam. Disgraceful coward.
962893348368535554 2018-02-11 03:37:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Love him. So glad hes here.

962885822629535745 2018-02-11 03:07:24 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Give this man his gold.

962876755144044544 2018-02-11 02:31:22 UTC <gaughran444> @clmazin Oh no. This is horrendous.
962876434644652033 2018-02-11 02:30:06 UTC <gaughran444> @fordm Its Raining Men or something equally big & tacky.

962690748457082880 2018-02-11 14:12:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes.
962683784486408193 2018-02-11 13:44:34 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Terrible idea. I have cops in my family. They dont want military equipment, they want gun control.
962683375713767425 2018-02-11 13:42:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro None.
962682918773641217 2018-02-11 13:41:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Im not sure either. I was a kid and was focused on Nixon. But I dont think either was as brazenly horrible in public as kelly.

962549771734081538 2018-02-10 04:52:03 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Perfect. And she never was a judge. She was a camera-hogging small Town DA.

962192871804858368 2018-02-09 05:13:51 UTC <gaughran444> @politico The White House has turned into that crappy tv show. Whatever it was called.

962157463205306369 2018-02-09 02:53:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Hence the refusal to release his tax returns. Would be the financial equivalent of his hair blowing around and showing his awful scalp.
962156984438067200 2018-02-09 02:51:15 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Thats precisely what the tea party was. Racist rage looking for a socially acceptable target. The deficit!
962156139591938048 2018-02-09 02:47:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Greed and bigotry.

962139552969347072 2018-02-09 01:41:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Of course Keith. Its a very hard time to be a person who cares about people, especially about vulnerable people. Youre better for it tho.

959801634007207936 2018-02-03 14:51:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Of course, you are the American disgrace. Stop attacking law enforcement you common criminal.
959787855894769665 2018-02-03 13:57:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Newsweek This is a nonstarter.

959401767317450752 2018-02-02 12:23:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Most members of organized crime rings are quiet. Theres something different about you.
959399858581975040 2018-02-02 12:15:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Youre a common criminal defaming law enforcement. You will lose this battle.

958377706063826945 2018-01-30 16:33:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid It is. This is why we need to take congress so the thug in chief can be impeached.
958345722658684928 2018-01-30 14:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Done.
958345540118466561 2018-01-30 14:25:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Kelly is a thug.

958342683721953280 2018-01-30 14:14:35 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @sbg1 Kelly is a thug.
958342393425813505 2018-01-30 14:13:26 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Fantastic decision.
958341882127450112 2018-01-30 14:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Glad a few Supreme Court justices will be there to see this. A nice warm-up to whatever Trump cases make their way to the SCOTUS.

958173959077482496 2018-01-29 03:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @critic_social Yes - unfortunately I think were stuck with a lot of his wreckage until we get a new president. But a dem congress can ashcan him at least
958171796095815686 2018-01-29 02:55:32 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Have we not been through enough?
958171398454890501 2018-01-29 02:53:58 UTC <gaughran444> @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @critic_social I think the Dems will impeach. Gs they are not, unfortunately, but I think theyll do that.

958139574185791488 2018-01-29 00:47:30 UTC <gaughran444> @GlazerRandee The party in charge doesnt give a damn about our country, only about maintaining power. Theres not a patriot among them.
958139109889007618 2018-01-29 00:45:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Not a goddamned one.
958127137055264769 2018-01-29 23:58:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Why are you giving your own response to the SOTU? Stop trashing the Democratic Party. Youve done enough.

957621443117842432 2018-01-28 14:28:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate No. You can try to push this story but we have much bigger fish to fry. Our country is on fire.
957621078490275848 2018-01-28 14:27:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Not a peep about Greg Popovich, who regularly savages him. Mmmmmm.
957620198458253312 2018-01-28 14:23:41 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @evanperez @mkraju It probably wouldnt hurt? She is a cypher.
957619740192722944 2018-01-28 14:21:52 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Wow. Shes minimizing the importance of this. The story is that he issued an order, not that the consulted with counsel.
957614741253427200 2018-01-28 14:02:00 UTC <gaughran444> @VanJones68 @jaketapper I thought Jay was remarkably generous towards him.

957605783537152000 2018-01-28 13:26:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The economy was better under Obama. As was everything else. #FailedPresident
957473422644334592 2018-01-27 04:40:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No youre the obstruction guy. Obstruction of justice.
957438038271029248 2018-01-27 02:19:51 UTC <gaughran444> @ddale8 @critic_social Yes. And too many goddamned guns.

957323568571961344 2018-01-27 18:44:59 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti @POLITICOMag @politico Yes because he too has a cerebral cortex.
957318701589630978 2018-01-27 18:25:39 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT At a time of nonstop serious crises, this feels like an unimportant archeological dig.
957313494084440064 2018-01-27 18:04:57 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Elephant tranquilizer. Its the only way.
957309855395713024 2018-01-27 17:50:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonOverstreet @critic_social Yeah. They almost lost Obamacare bc they didnt realize it was for nice white people like them. The tax bill screwed them.

957263459611283463 2018-01-27 14:46:08 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Why are you silent on the GOPs war on immigrants? Where is your conscience?

957248827781677056 2018-01-27 13:48:00 UTC <gaughran444> @RuthMarcus Enough already.
957056894081921024 2018-01-26 01:05:19 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio @critic_social Arent his parents immigrants? He has nothing to say about DACA? Trumps war on immigration? Nothing???
957053268475117568 2018-01-26 00:50:55 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio @critic_social Haha! So sick of this guy hiding behind the Bible. He should man up and say what, if anything, is on his mind.
957050860151955457 2018-01-26 00:41:20 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @MSNBC Our country is on fire. An imbecilic autocrat is at the helm. Are we really supposed to give a hoot about this?
957049282074431491 2018-01-26 00:35:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think theyre going to try to get out of it but hell end up having to talk.

956564116952449030 2018-01-25 16:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Good point. But punitive damages involve some level of outrage. Even if theyre objectively calculable.
956532333112328192 2018-01-25 14:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Theyre supposed to listen to the evidence with impartiality. In imposing a sentence, they can and should determine level of culpability.

953435705581162496 2018-01-16 01:16:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Good question. Repulsive little punk.
953435290953109508 2018-01-16 01:14:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Who is this POS?
953261527334825985 2018-01-16 13:43:53 UTC <gaughran444> @jbrownedianis Love this guy.
953110247882797057 2018-01-15 03:42:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Absolutely nothing.
953024414395838464 2018-01-15 22:01:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik 100%. We want this fool playing outside till hes out of office.
952886485258330113 2018-01-15 12:53:36 UTC <gaughran444> @irishrygirl @AUkeibro Exactly. This should not be up for further debate. Stone cold racism is one of the few things hes consistent about. For decades.
952563818231713792 2018-01-14 15:31:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump And we, as Americans, want a competent president who loves and leads our country. All of it. #ShitholePresident
952543991974723584 2018-01-14 14:12:39 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Resign, you common criminal. #PresidentShithole
952504187551698944 2018-01-14 11:34:29 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Get help.
952307892903927808 2018-01-13 22:34:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Maybe say how much?
952307828055822336 2018-01-13 22:34:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Smart.
952307468746547202 2018-01-13 22:32:48 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler Ive probably read this hundreds of times. It catches my heart every time.
952307162323275777 2018-01-13 22:31:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid The one and only category in which he beats Obama. #PresidentShithole
952306770386542592 2018-01-13 22:30:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Yes.
952306200598777857 2018-01-13 22:27:45 UTC <gaughran444> @ishapiro Hold on there. There are many native-born Americans who defend the constitution every day for their whole lives. This joke doesnt work.
952305593175429120 2018-01-13 22:25:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Amacord.
952305468021633024 2018-01-13 22:24:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Keep Vlad. Remind people what a thoroughly corrupted presidency this is.
952305227138560001 2018-01-13 22:23:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No, youre crazed and need to resign. Ask your lawyers to seek clemency if you leave the White House. Everyone will feel better.
952295026322825217 2018-01-13 21:43:21 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @Susan_Hennessey These pleasant new disclosures make me wonder if the speculation that his brain is rotting from syphilis has merit.
952294486276739072 2018-01-13 21:41:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This would have been unsettling under obama. With crazyface, its truly scary.
952247516489281537 2018-01-13 18:34:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance Having an insane president puts everyone on edge, to day the least.
952206663909507073 2018-01-13 15:52:14 UTC <gaughran444> @RamyInocencio Top notch guy.
952196408228106242 2018-01-13 15:11:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF Its also a false dichotomy. Many if not most of his voters have racist thoughts. Its why they voted for him.
952191746624163840 2018-01-13 14:52:57 UTC <gaughran444> @amjoyshow I think his idiot voters thought Obamacare was for black people. When they found out it covered their white asses, they were all for it.
952190868139757568 2018-01-13 14:49:28 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @TinaMcGugan Thank the good lord that hes not in their faces.
952190352118697984 2018-01-13 14:47:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 That poor child. Maybe better for him if his awful dad keeps his distance.
952189680497451009 2018-01-13 14:44:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Think youre right. At this point, even apolitical people are probably scared by his obvious incompetence and instability. They want out.
952188442431156224 2018-01-13 14:39:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @amjoyshow Good. We need this. Let the Repubs remain silent. Let the record be clear as day.
952176909542191104 2018-01-13 13:54:00 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Yes. Not a tough question.
952016936136822784 2018-01-12 03:18:19 UTC <gaughran444> @christinawilkie @ResistTrump17 Glad youre here. And youll be here long after that fool is tossed from the White House.
952008500896464896 2018-01-12 02:44:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson You sound frightened.
952008147819991040 2018-01-12 02:43:24 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics @JRubinBlogger No cognition.
952007973018177536 2018-01-12 02:42:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @casanova_kara Dont know what this means but sure like the sound of it.
952007197155823617 2018-01-12 02:39:37 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Oh ffs. The imponderable. The mystery of life.
952006886559281155 2018-01-12 02:38:23 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @keithellison Oh yes we can. Si se puede.
951990048148393986 2018-01-12 01:31:29 UTC <gaughran444> @streetdogfdn @JenniWrenB Thank god for dogs!
951981507563966466 2018-01-12 00:57:33 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB @streetdogfdn So cute!
951978773934694400 2018-01-12 00:46:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Vomitous.
951975452708605953 2018-01-12 00:33:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NYCLU @ACLU Hes gotta go. Done.
951974659532247040 2018-01-12 00:30:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Love this. Really.
951955394435350528 2018-01-12 23:13:47 UTC <gaughran444> @selectedwisdom @traceygaughran Anything, anywhere that brings this beast down works for me.
951954987357175808 2018-01-12 23:12:10 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta @businessinsider I love when republicans eat their dead. Let er rip.
951954812278632454 2018-01-12 23:11:28 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta @DavidBegnaud After the way weve forsaken them, its the least we could do.
951929628918255621 2018-01-12 21:31:24 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage If Obama had done it there would have been burning crosses on the White House lawn.
951926190239027200 2018-01-12 21:17:44 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I could use a new purse.
951926011020619778 2018-01-12 21:17:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare Thats our boy.
951923159393034240 2018-01-12 21:05:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Ryan on Hitler: unfriendly.
951876229887680512 2018-01-12 17:59:12 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Give him time.
951795434732883968 2018-01-12 12:38:09 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Yes. Hes always been super dumb but now hes dementing. Dynamo combo for the job.
951795163327852544 2018-01-12 12:37:05 UTC <gaughran444> @ThePlumLineGS His whole presidency is rooted in racism.
951792329387626496 2018-01-12 12:25:49 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol He can always take the 5th. Maybe thats where hes headed.
951664508283641857 2018-01-11 03:57:54 UTC <gaughran444> @fordm @CrimeADay Uh oh.
951643807178788864 2018-01-11 02:35:38 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Will never forget it. Those kids were exonerated by dna evidence, their lives destroyed. This Nazi bastard kept insisting they were guilty.
951641029136080896 2018-01-11 02:24:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Mikel_Jollett Exactly right. This bastards been an out and proud bigot since day one. #PresidentShithole
951636178960252928 2018-01-11 02:05:20 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran #PresidentShithole
951636008180862976 2018-01-11 02:04:39 UTC <gaughran444> @NaveedAJamali Maybe he wants everything tidied up before he arrives.
951630454695825408 2018-01-11 01:42:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @GlazerRandee Me too. Amazed by her ability to remain poised and articulate while clearly mad as hell. Not easy!
951623477416652800 2018-01-11 01:14:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @StarkyLuv73 Detest him. #PresidentShithole
951622824187322368 2018-01-11 01:12:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @SarahThyre Shes got an extraordinary ability to remain poised and articulate when shes mad as hell. Love her. #PresidentShithole
951614933262852096 2018-01-11 00:40:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @AhmedBaba_ Were glad they came.
951614662528962560 2018-01-11 00:39:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Hell be fondly remembered for the Shithole Doctrine.
951614352985075714 2018-01-11 00:38:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. Its pretty clear that hes scared of something but it cant be the gay thing right? Who gives?
951613998021169152 2018-01-11 00:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @henryfingjames Thats true. Hes been an out and proud racist for decades.
951604929201831936 2018-01-11 00:01:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Absolutely never.
951604285351002112 2018-01-11 23:58:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Is he smart enough? Deliberate enough? You are, hes not.
951601732991311872 2018-01-11 23:48:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yes. But he did take him apart.
951598420187320321 2018-01-11 23:35:17 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @Lawrence People dont leave everything and risk life & limb if all is well at home. Theyre driven by need. All to our countrys benefit.
951595083907960832 2018-01-11 23:22:02 UTC <gaughran444> @DailyMailUK @christinawilkie Of course he wont be. This imbecilic pariah.
951585146330910720 2018-01-11 22:42:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 If this wasnt the real deal, what the hell is?
951584667987267588 2018-01-11 22:40:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger Gorsuch is no good either, btw.
951584314537529345 2018-01-11 22:39:14 UTC <gaughran444> @AP_Politics Prepare for a shower of racist, bigoted invective.
951584090863620096 2018-01-11 22:38:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @REDLECTROID Yes. I think all of us who have seen this on our families recognized it immediately. Particularly hard to miss with this guy.
951583819022430208 2018-01-11 22:37:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow Right. Hes disinhibited. Cant contain his inappropriate thoughts any more. Doesnt have too many thoughts left. Just rage and impulse.
951582842970140674 2018-01-11 22:33:23 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior 100%. He was an out and proud bigot from day one.
951580865649405952 2018-01-11 22:25:32 UTC <gaughran444> @edelstudio Outstanding. What an image.
951579921524101120 2018-01-11 22:21:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen My puritanical little phone has resisted my profanity for too many years. Ducking sick of it.
951577521874767880 2018-01-11 22:12:15 UTC <gaughran444> @openculture Calling Mike Pence.
951459806522601473 2018-01-11 14:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @dnvolz I like the exhortation to Get Smart!
951454369077178368 2018-01-11 14:02:53 UTC <gaughran444> @jonathanvswan Other than insulting war widows what is Kellys contribution?
951312988899807232 2018-01-10 04:41:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein @maddow @MrDane1982 @lauren_ten My kind of broad.

951306169464877057 2018-01-10 04:13:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This picture exemplifies how good he is for minority voters.
951305554198257664 2018-01-10 04:11:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MitchMcConell @Frialish Crush him.
951303573215772672 2018-01-10 04:03:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Cabinet @realDonaldTrump A cabal of grifters. Look it up.
951291433117519872 2018-01-10 03:15:26 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Hes capable of neither.
951282886593925122 2018-01-10 02:41:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @thehill Ever seen a torn balloon stuck in a tree? The air is gone, its just ugly garbage. Thats this guy.

951273482507247617 2018-01-10 02:04:06 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes This confused imbecile doesnt make laws. He doesnt know that, but we do. Everybody breathe.
951270272136605696 2018-01-10 01:51:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF @NAACP_LDF Very sorry to hear this. Look forward to the many NAACP LDF victories ahead.
951255231173681154 2018-01-10 00:51:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated As a long time political nerd, I remember this.
951253233833594880 2018-01-10 00:43:39 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @TheStoryFNC @marthamaccallum @VP Youre disgusting in so many ways. How did your ancestors come to this country tough guy?
951215850085904384 2018-01-10 22:15:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Sounds cozy.
951167001845796874 2018-01-10 19:00:59 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Magnificent.
951164679304380416 2018-01-10 18:51:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Hes one of those few people who can make me feel embarrassed all by myself, watching him.
951150524048510978 2018-01-10 17:55:31 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Its equally clear to the whole country that youre running scared. What have they got on you?
951149188288516097 2018-01-10 17:50:12 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Not too much red there. What ev.

951137495584002048 2018-01-10 17:03:44 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Why choose?
951137392286629889 2018-01-10 17:03:20 UTC <gaughran444> @JeffFlake Oh come on. The Stable Genius didnt have a clue and went back to his wall garbage in subsequent tweets. Helpful to whom?
951079267542106114 2018-01-10 13:12:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Always good to plan ahead.
951074576812953600 2018-01-10 12:53:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Wheres a nice flying pitchfork when you need one?
950941762436124677 2018-01-09 04:05:58 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @Scavino45 How do you think your ancestors came here, Scavino? Whats wrong with you?
950935531172651008 2018-01-09 03:41:12 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris Hard out here for a pimp.
950934783827283968 2018-01-09 03:38:14 UTC <gaughran444> @aravosis Not sure shes the best example. Arguably her entry led to the destruction of our nation.
950931603563433985 2018-01-09 03:25:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @MollyJongFast The sooner the better.
950931402249392128 2018-01-09 03:24:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow And agree with what you said in your video. 100%
950930767445725185 2018-01-09 03:22:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow I cant look at his face this close. Can not do it. Physically can not do it.
950929978606145541 2018-01-09 03:19:08 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Dear god. These poor people.
950928386758795264 2018-01-09 03:12:49 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @sfmnemonic Wonderful article. Im so glad trump doesnt have a dog. Doesnt deserve one.
950922401612730368 2018-01-09 02:49:02 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @critic_social So grateful to her. No-nonsense woman. Just gets the job done.

950915401650667522 2018-01-09 02:21:13 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti @AUkeibro Forgot about that one! While people who serve their time lose their right to vote. So wrong.
950912212767531009 2018-01-09 02:08:33 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner And Senator Feinstein is a patriot. Should come as no surprise for a U.S. Senator, but there are none across the aisle.
950911040501534721 2018-01-09 02:03:53 UTC <gaughran444> @stevebenen The shameless turtle.
950910643334537216 2018-01-09 02:02:19 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @SenFeinstein Thank you Senator.
950910458898341888 2018-01-09 02:01:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Amen!! So grateful to her.
950903631468990465 2018-01-09 01:34:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @renato_mariotti In New York we have Michael Grimm trying for a post-prison comeback. And convicted people all over the country lose their right to vote.
950892054518919168 2018-01-09 00:48:27 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Jeff Sessions is a little white wrecking ball. Terrible for our country in every way.
950891406628982784 2018-01-09 00:45:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Get a room.
950891045465870336 2018-01-09 00:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein @AUkeibro @TheDemCoalition Go Senator Diane Feinstein! Thank you!
950735232650678272 2018-01-09 14:25:17 UTC <gaughran444> @Tilt_A_Squirrel @AdyBarkan Important to use the insurance companies names. Contrast their brutality with their warm fuzzy commercials.
950734943939973122 2018-01-09 14:24:09 UTC <gaughran444> @Tilt_A_Squirrel @AdyBarkan This is a very good idea. These companies should be outed every day. And your strength is remarkable. I wish you all the best.
950732248294313984 2018-01-09 14:13:26 UTC <gaughran444> @healthnet @JoeKeene @AdyBarkan Why dont you out this insurance company and we can bombard them?
950732006513696769 2018-01-09 14:12:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN Maybe just for dementia, which is measurable.
950726984421859328 2018-01-09 13:52:31 UTC <gaughran444> @RevDrBarber Fantastic idea.
950725264996294656 2018-01-09 13:45:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Brasilmagic Hes adorable!
950578813485928454 2018-01-08 04:03:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Oprah @IvankaTrump @critic_social Ha! CBA! Did you see that rumor that she was harboring fantasies of running for president some day??? These people cannot be embarrassed!
950575372248199169 2018-01-08 03:50:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Oprah @IvankaTrump Times up for your dad. Mueller wants to have a word with him.
950574953430216704 2018-01-08 03:48:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Pretty soon hell forget the words to Happy Birthday to You as well.
950559782536187904 2018-01-08 02:48:07 UTC <gaughran444> @bessbell Haha!
950410922220228609 2018-01-08 16:56:36 UTC <gaughran444> @kashanacauley Exactly. Competence. Experience. Top notch reading skills. Fundamental decency. Good work ethic. Sanity. All that sexy stuff. Please.
950410132881641472 2018-01-08 16:53:28 UTC <gaughran444> @AnneFrankCenter Horrific.
950409814819180544 2018-01-08 16:52:12 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Wholly inappropriate.
950363867548352512 2018-01-08 13:49:37 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulShrager Hope no FDNY get hurt.
950363250490822658 2018-01-08 13:47:10 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes. But his lawyers could write it more artfully than he can speak. Wont be permitted.
950236811703607296 2018-01-07 05:24:45 UTC <gaughran444> @marvien_ @emmyruiz Epic chutzpah.
950236191571501056 2018-01-07 05:22:17 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm Id prefer extended dental work.
950235587180728320 2018-01-07 05:19:53 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wouldnt we all prefer he simply stay in bed all day? Hopefully sleeping? The less hes conscious, speaking and tweeting the better.
950012025748549632 2018-01-07 14:31:31 UTC <gaughran444> @historylvrsclub Hope our aggressive imbecile never sees this.
950002901048578049 2018-01-07 13:55:16 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Hope he asks what the hell happened to you.

949983998486425600 2018-01-07 12:40:09 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Thats what I do, is I do things proper. Oy.
949982292235124736 2018-01-07 12:33:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro What a wimp.
949981557183348736 2018-01-07 12:30:27 UTC <gaughran444> @coach_sjkl @DearAuntCrabby Would much rather have Mr. Ed as president.
949840693219987462 2018-01-06 03:10:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Oh indeed it could. Jammed right into my craw.
949836967109382144 2018-01-06 02:55:54 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @CNNSotu Our little Goebbels. Cant wait!
949834657721409536 2018-01-06 02:46:44 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Good! Get in there!
949834307165618176 2018-01-06 02:45:20 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT How can you say this in light of his incoherent blathering about Russia & Comey firing, both subject to severe legal action?
949833642091732992 2018-01-06 02:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Im like a smart person. Im a bipedal mammal with opposable thumbs. Like a smart person.
949831595606839296 2018-01-06 02:34:34 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw @SteveBellovin Ha! Sounds quite accurate.
949819718373912584 2018-01-06 01:47:22 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Grotesque.
949819319583756288 2018-01-06 01:45:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TinaSmithMN @penultimatepen @alfranken Will do but think you should still be in the senate.
949815516583153665 2018-01-06 01:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @VABVOX There are neuropsychological tests for cognitive decline. Id like to see a few for this guy.
949814783049715712 2018-01-06 01:27:45 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw No offense to the Toaster but I wish theyd kept this building.
949814597858615296 2018-01-06 01:27:01 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @NikkisBubble This man has the best combined intellect and temperament of any president in my lifetime.
949813088739581953 2018-01-06 01:21:01 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta Have you ever heard an intelligent person describe himself as smart? Or really smart?
949789402032758785 2018-01-06 23:46:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NormOrnstein Seriously. Hes behaving like a hostage. Whats up?
949656676336111618 2018-01-06 14:59:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Horrible but true.
949656521331412992 2018-01-06 14:58:53 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC @notbern There it is.
949641487985373184 2018-01-06 13:59:08 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 And Pence.
949641376446275589 2018-01-06 13:58:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 An old valley girl with a nuclear arsenal. The best kind.
949640327077523456 2018-01-06 13:54:32 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden More frightened than humiliated at the moment but the day is young.
949635592870121472 2018-01-06 13:35:43 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 The Corleones were smarter.
949635443334754306 2018-01-06 13:35:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Scary. Not a single cabinet member or republican congressperson breathing a word about the 25th amendment. What has to happen?
949634689245073409 2018-01-06 13:32:07 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Wheres the elephant tranquilizer?
949634435804225537 2018-01-06 13:31:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Because he wont listen to legal counsels advice and probably doesnt pay his bills so good lawyers wont get near him.
949444377780342784 2018-01-05 00:55:54 UTC <gaughran444> @politico As it should.
949443852003397633 2018-01-05 00:53:48 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @ericgarland @ymreiser1 No could never forget that bastard!
949421277445525505 2018-01-05 23:24:06 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @joanwalsh The ambitious woman is the first cousin of the uppity negro.
949414076261822465 2018-01-05 22:55:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MollyJongFast Jesus Christ. Thuggish bastards.
949413179691593730 2018-01-05 22:51:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Yeah thats the one.
949375190915526657 2018-01-05 20:20:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Outstanding, even for you.
949374600948932610 2018-01-05 20:18:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ericgarland @berry_buzz @brengoode I dont argue with people on twitter but thats a very bigoted view of Catholics. Ever heard Justice Brennan, devout catholic? Take care.
949364458937307138 2018-01-05 19:38:20 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti @chbacon @clb0137 Why choose?
949360981796409345 2018-01-05 19:24:30 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Thank you. This shook me up. Even from republicans. All partisan, no patriotism.

949359270977589254 2018-01-05 19:17:43 UTC <gaughran444> @ericgarland @berry_buzz @brengoode Are you forgetting that Obama appointed two justices, Sotomayor and Kagan, after McConnell made that pronouncement?
949358522596319232 2018-01-05 19:14:44 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Poor things.
949358304484102144 2018-01-05 19:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @ericgarland @kh_nc1 I dont think thats so. Anyway its too late now.
949357776052146176 2018-01-05 19:11:46 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Confidence somewhat shaken by indisputable evidence that president is out of his very small mind.
949357206813757441 2018-01-05 19:09:30 UTC <gaughran444> @ericgarland @berry_buzz No. Should have done earlier. Always admired her but the individuals dont matter, its a cold question of numbers.
949344069414735873 2018-01-05 18:17:18 UTC <gaughran444> @gabrielsherman Out windows or doors?
949343821724377088 2018-01-05 18:16:19 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan If birds could talk theyd tell you they hate you too.
949342399649730560 2018-01-05 18:10:40 UTC <gaughran444> @ericgarland Would have been more baller & responsible for her to resign when Obama had ample time to appoint her successor. Unpopular view I know.
949324963076599808 2018-01-05 17:01:23 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC You have no authority to speak to the American people any more. Everyone wonders what trump has on you.
949297406725718017 2018-01-05 15:11:53 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik @Jerica_Phillips Love Love Love.
949297184700321795 2018-01-05 15:11:00 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer @codykeenan I wonder who set this in motion . . .
949296299257581568 2018-01-05 15:07:29 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @ddale8 He is a blight on our nation.
949295741696081920 2018-01-05 15:05:16 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouseCEA @WhiteHouse Is someone howling with laughter as he or she writes this garbage?
949292578087886851 2018-01-05 14:52:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Stealing from the poor. Working for the rich. Lying to the people.  (Just a first attempt. More to follow)
949291916356673536 2018-01-05 14:50:04 UTC <gaughran444> @johnlegend States Rights has always been code for racial oppression free of federal intervention. Or, as Roy Moore would put it, the good old days.
949287688137596929 2018-01-05 14:33:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson President Postliterate Bestwords is waiting on either the audio book or for Kellyanne to organize tableaux vivants of various chapters :)
949134533760245760 2018-01-04 04:24:41 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost No thanks. I just read the news.
949134242188992513 2018-01-04 04:23:32 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Of course they do.
949131172306653184 2018-01-04 04:11:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You mindless schmuck. The stock market rose at a higher rate under Obama than you. Ask someone to explain that to you. Very slowly.

949124977277767680 2018-01-04 03:46:43 UTC <gaughran444> @SykesCharlie Hope we live to see the movies. Will make What Ever Happened to Baby Jane look underplayed.
949124501228331008 2018-01-04 03:44:49 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer No worries. The prosecutors arent.
949111756953194496 2018-01-04 02:54:11 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @TinaMcGugan I think its a serious problem. An ignorant electorate is a demagogues dream.
949096839365701633 2018-01-04 01:54:54 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @TinaMcGugan Very very good law. Should have it in every state.
949096461500895233 2018-01-04 01:53:24 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Ok.
949096346325221377 2018-01-04 01:52:56 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy But he did have to recuse from Russia investigation. Which has been critical.
949095712272371712 2018-01-04 01:50:25 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Sorry too busy reading Fire & Fury.  But thanks!
949095298139394048 2018-01-04 01:48:47 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @TinaMcGugan Yes. Candidates and public school students. We need an educated electorate to avoid getting another disaster like this clown.
949091666627002368 2018-01-04 01:34:21 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis @virgoprincxss Little sweetheart!
949088423620632576 2018-01-04 01:21:28 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Stomach turning.
949088326031761408 2018-01-04 01:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @kumailn Great. So the organizing principle of this godforsaken White House is keeping the car keys from the demented grandfather.
949086022515806208 2018-01-04 01:11:55 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @ADIC33 Yeah. I am a lawyer and I have to agree with you. My children have made paper airplanes with more legal significance.

949076846758506497 2018-01-04 00:35:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yeah. Simplistic with that nice skosh of misogyny. Enough.

949025603763822592 2018-01-04 21:11:50 UTC <gaughran444> @jorgeramosnews A nostalgic and deeply racist view.

949025206659624961 2018-01-04 21:10:15 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel It really is. Am hesitant to spend another minute of my life thinking about him, but his legal blustering makes it a bit tempting.

948948586418573312 2018-01-04 16:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @TUSK81 @kpmel Well, yeah. Youve got to give him that.
948938079045373952 2018-01-04 15:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I may need a needlepoint pillow that says this.
948936542852141056 2018-01-04 15:17:56 UTC <gaughran444> @KaraCalavera Agree. The whole states right thing is a scam. See, e.g. Gore v Bush. They crashed in on states right to manage voting.
948935338155741191 2018-01-04 15:13:09 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @TUSK81 That little cracker is such a cut up.
948934466558361600 2018-01-04 15:09:41 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics I once had a plantars wart on the bottom of my foot that took forever to get rid of. At least it didnt talk.

948882288447762432 2018-01-04 11:42:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Bone Spur Boy for this inspiration! Thank you!
948879218905092096 2018-01-04 11:30:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I like Lock Him Up. The font looks kind of Russian but is a bit hard to read.
948878356178722816 2018-01-04 11:26:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The GOP doesnt want people of color to vote for obvious reasons. But you cant stop them. #2018Midterms
948768674286112768 2018-01-03 04:10:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare The first and last time trump has ever bested Obama.

948752229175037952 2018-01-03 03:05:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I had a busy day. What happened?
948752044797644800 2018-01-03 03:04:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Works for me.
948601349222125569 2018-01-03 17:06:00 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Youre being kind. I would say 50-75 lbs.
948554454684655617 2018-01-03 13:59:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh yes. I will think more about this. That little ghoul needs a special message.
948544044728274944 2018-01-03 13:18:18 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @BillKristol What indication do you have that this is so? All I see from @VP is energetic ass kissing.
948543311761104896 2018-01-03 13:15:23 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 These guys? The most unamerican leaders in my lifetime. Theyll do nothing.

948542309179777024 2018-01-03 13:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyersComm Critical. Meanwhile former felons can run for Congress. Like Grimm in Staten Island. Is this fair?

947878617442340865 2018-01-01 17:14:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Spoken like the true son of a baptist minister! Hear, hear! Happy New Year!
947877879425224708 2018-01-01 17:11:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA That would explain the public fellating of him by top republicans.  Really not pretty to watch.
947658186466775041 2017-12-31 02:38:12 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I love you! One of my favorite people ever!
947610701874548736 2017-12-31 23:29:31 UTC <gaughran444> @axios Yeah we noticed. What does trump have on him? Must be impressive.
947557187186036736 2017-12-31 19:56:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Want to see this one coast to coast.
947552184744513536 2017-12-31 19:37:00 UTC <gaughran444> Ah, authenticity. Next story: Trump bestows warm sense of belonging to previously sad, excluded white supremacists.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/us/politics/trump-reinventing-presidency.html

947520916484972546 2017-12-31 17:32:45 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Of course. That pesky constitution again.
947518156796506112 2017-12-31 17:21:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No. They dont quite get that action-consequences equation. Higher level thought.
947488587070701569 2017-12-31 15:24:17 UTC <gaughran444> @EricLiptonNYT @DonaldJTrumpJr When your lawyer tells you to pipe down, do you put your fingers in your ears and sing?
947476092864139264 2017-12-31 14:34:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @PMBreakingNews These brave souls.
947472878055952384 2017-12-31 14:21:51 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @Michael36776349 Maybe the commerce clause? Like they need my expertise. :)
947472748846239744 2017-12-31 14:21:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @Michael36776349 This makes sense. Dont know if it will work, but glad its being pursued.
947472496340733952 2017-12-31 14:20:20 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT This is the moment he became the president.

946923514317197313 2017-12-29 01:58:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. A brain in utter chaos. Harrowing to read & think about.
946923179724951552 2017-12-29 01:57:33 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Good. I dont care what they get this miscreant for. Just get him.
946775341619654656 2017-12-29 16:10:06 UTC <gaughran444> @historyinmoment So cute!! High?
946728364827725825 2017-12-29 13:03:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I dont think this could be better. Outstanding.
946608853235494919 2017-12-28 05:08:32 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT All your arguing with readers doesnt reflect well on you or the NYT.

946603727020089344 2017-12-28 04:48:10 UTC <gaughran444> @andylassner There are probably many things I dont know about this person, because I dont know who she is. Which I sense is fortunate.
946600673113706496 2017-12-28 04:36:02 UTC <gaughran444> @tedlieu If trump & co get taken down by law enforcement we look like, and are, once again, a nation of laws. Its a good look.
946599919179259904 2017-12-28 04:33:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SamanthaJPower And staggering stupidity.

946564962054438914 2017-12-28 02:14:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Dangerous imbecile.
946374981973356544 2017-12-28 13:39:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @alivitali @HallieJackson Ah, that time-honored legal doctrine, fake news.
946374613814177793 2017-12-28 13:37:45 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti I assume our federal government will do nothing until the democrats take back Congress and then the White House.
946373881891295232 2017-12-28 13:34:50 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Ah yes, the guy who decried the 15th Amendment. The black people voting thing does not work for him.
946373192817561600 2017-12-28 13:32:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @kylegriffin1 Whats with this dreary legal business? Cant he just ask Jesus to swoop down and make it better?
946372437670793216 2017-12-28 13:29:06 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Because we need our country back.

946354237830811648 2017-12-28 12:16:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Edsquire @HelenKennedy I think an explanation that doesnt include racism misses the point. Trump was a founding father of the birther movement.

946153317352304643 2017-12-27 22:58:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated More of an Al Capone approach.

945865840171343872 2017-12-26 03:56:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak Our country should be united and single-mindedly focused on vanquishing this enemy just as in past wars. Instead we rot from within.

945855259997548544 2017-12-26 03:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I should watch that again. Oh yes to the three ghosts! At this point Id prefer them to induce a stroke rather than teach a lesson.
945848180125655040 2017-12-26 02:45:53 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @Super70sSports I loved them.

943852859073941505 2017-12-21 14:37:12 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 The democrats should publicize this everywhere. Repeatedly. Drill it in.
943845513413234688 2017-12-21 14:08:00 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio You are blindingly full of shit. Just signed on to a tax plan that rewards the richest and will decimate programs for the poor.
943844566838534144 2017-12-21 14:04:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The blue state retributive tax plan will depress home prices in the targeted states. As you might understand if explained slowly.
943679645429329920 2017-12-20 03:08:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AndreaChalupa If trump had heard of Stalin, hed think so too.
943666197840752640 2017-12-20 02:15:28 UTC <gaughran444> @RadioFreeTom Maybe we could celebrate Presidents -1 Day.
943665737478139909 2017-12-20 02:13:38 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Thanks Bernie Sanders!
943660253605957632 2017-12-20 01:51:51 UTC <gaughran444> @FBIWFO @LindseyGrahamSC @MattMurph24 @TimInHonolulu Is this why Graham is so furiously kissing trumps ass now? Not fun to watch.
943657200945434624 2017-12-20 01:39:43 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt The republicans pretended to worry about deficits but that turns out to have been utter bullshit.
943656957164118017 2017-12-20 01:38:45 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes He is scum.
943656117678243840 2017-12-20 01:35:25 UTC <gaughran444> @markos @MichaelSLinden The lines are drawn. #Midterms2018
943640833219354626 2017-12-20 00:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken Dont go.
943640664943808512 2017-12-20 00:34:01 UTC <gaughran444> @kashanacauley Simmering rage.
943639656838680577 2017-12-20 00:30:00 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner Had the same thought. I believe its spelled fellatio, fwiw.
943580100624347138 2017-12-20 20:33:21 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC The republican senators should all get kneepads in their Christmas stockings.
943579829252837377 2017-12-20 20:32:16 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Excruciating imbecile.
943564541836840960 2017-12-20 19:31:32 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken Al hang tough. Dont resign. Youre a great senator and youve received no due process. Signed, a feminist fan.
943538754651815936 2017-12-20 17:49:03 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger Im a diehard feminist and think Franken should have stayed put. He received no due process whatsoever, despite his denials. Not okay.
943463022911254530 2017-12-20 12:48:08 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 I think its just like a cover up.
943462560820547585 2017-12-20 12:46:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I sure as hell hope so. And yes, I think they have at least crushed themselves in next years midterms. Good.
943453215751798784 2017-12-20 12:09:09 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are reviled from coast to coast. Look it up.
943452847403880448 2017-12-20 12:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Youre a shameless, lying thief. Disgraceful.
943452500396519424 2017-12-20 12:06:19 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 In a heartbeat.
943451799750619143 2017-12-20 12:03:32 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @mboorstein Hope that hell he talked about all his life turns out to be the real deal.
943339349877428224 2017-12-19 04:36:42 UTC <gaughran444> @benwikler @gelliottmorris Tectonic shifts. Keep em coming.
943337924086652933 2017-12-19 04:31:02 UTC <gaughran444> @RepWilson @CapehartJ As she should be.
943337403955208192 2017-12-19 04:28:58 UTC <gaughran444> @jenhab These people are a recurrent disease.
943337291493400580 2017-12-19 04:28:31 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Both could predict blue monsoon in the midterms.
943332790212407296 2017-12-19 04:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @timothycsimons @danpfeiffer Maybe that populist fervor was thinly veiled racist fervor. Abetted by Russians. Maybe trumps presidency is a fraud from every angle.
943330989543002112 2017-12-19 04:03:28 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill @jonfavs Do not forget this. #Midterms2018
943327593247465474 2017-12-19 03:49:59 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @BCAppelbaum Maybe its the trickle down effect of having a pathological liar at the top of the organization.
943324300156825600 2017-12-19 03:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @AdyBarkan @JuddApatow @MSNBC What grotesque behavior. How can he face himself?
943323791442182144 2017-12-19 03:34:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @MollyJongFast Does he mean the Russians?
943322900760809472 2017-12-19 03:31:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CREWcrew Of course. Trumps lawyers are slinging bullshit, in legal parlance.
943321667799060480 2017-12-19 03:26:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce @Jmillerbluebld Im glad.
943317224001064961 2017-12-19 03:08:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog Listen up people. The most critical midterm elections of your lives are on the horizon. Register and get the hell out there. #Midterms2018
943315529602945025 2017-12-19 03:02:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SenBooker Lets express these feelings loud and  clearly when they really count - 11/18. #Midterms2018
943315214858059781 2017-12-19 03:00:47 UTC <gaughran444> @rosannecash Youre very kind. I hope the rest of Ryans days are a living hell.
943310657654489088 2017-12-19 02:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich What would a rough and tumble guy like draft-dodging Vatican Newt know about elites?
943282733148753925 2017-12-19 00:51:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro A terrible loss for you and your patients/clients. We will indeed prevail but a lot of unnecessary suffering. Awful.
943282266465275904 2017-12-19 00:49:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @Lesia54321 No definitely not enough. But getting there. Weve got to get a new Congress in the mid-term elections. They can toss trump.
943281848813342720 2017-12-19 00:48:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Its just grotesque. And hard to bear. Im sorry. But lets see what happens in the mid-terms. Could change drastically.
943279064340684800 2017-12-19 00:37:08 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Any time. We all have our down days. Such a tough time.
943278793019613184 2017-12-19 00:36:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Wow. People are fed up. Good.
943278259692867584 2017-12-19 00:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Very alarming. But our country came back from world wars, the civil war, the Depression, assassinations. We will come back from this.
943277123883749376 2017-12-19 00:29:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I know. We have to keep breathing. 11/18 should be a turning point.
943273540622614533 2017-12-19 00:15:11 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Make it stop!!!!!
943273313144582145 2017-12-19 00:14:17 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen @crfredrickson @washingtonpost @NoahBookbinder Clearest explanation of this complicated issue out there. A must read.
943271564069482496 2017-12-19 00:07:20 UTC <gaughran444> @RedCross @SpeakerRyan And your brilliant policy wonk schtick is also pure bs. Youre not all that bright, just falsely pious and greedy as f.
943271191963492352 2017-12-19 00:05:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro That is some tortured logic right there.
943270955614216192 2017-12-19 00:04:55 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF Can you challenge it as a first amendment violation?
943270686285590529 2017-12-19 00:03:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Theyre both really crappy guys. Were stuck with Gorsuch for decades.
943269305684299777 2017-12-19 23:58:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveRattner @kevinkresse Will have to see this effect for myself. Sounds fun.
943250668529127424 2017-12-19 22:44:18 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @WendyRWeiser Fantastic. Congratulations.
943250397958950912 2017-12-19 22:43:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @RepDennisRoss We all know youre lying and we dont get dumber the more you repeat yourselves. We all know its bs. #11/18
943249832868831238 2017-12-19 22:40:59 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Poignant.
943242191920664576 2017-12-19 22:10:37 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @CharlesPPierce @laurastacotruck Another noble cause.
943202740934795265 2017-12-19 19:33:51 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Worst acid trip ever.
943202636773384192 2017-12-19 19:33:27 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wheres a nice lightning bolt when you need one?
943190970211946496 2017-12-19 18:47:05 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @ObamaFoundation Love my president.
943190742155087872 2017-12-19 18:46:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Franken got a raw deal, as did the Democratic Party, which could ill afford to lose him. We need fighters, like him.
943122547196997632 2017-12-19 14:15:12 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom This brave man.
943122439185293312 2017-12-19 14:14:46 UTC <gaughran444> @behindyourback Paul Ryan was a rich kid.
943122225967878144 2017-12-19 14:13:55 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol I thought he was vomiting. Maybe thats for next week.
943122032035852288 2017-12-19 14:13:09 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @JoanAlker1 Inexcusable.
942933210161348608 2017-12-18 01:42:50 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Well, now that the Trump presidential library is completed, whats next?
942869810056171521 2017-12-18 21:30:55 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper So self-aggrandizing and self-pitying. Alternatively, he might have prepped for the hearing so he could have answered a few questions.
942864112186548224 2017-12-18 21:08:16 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls Do you guys ever question the wisdom of an historically unpopular president ash-canning an historically popular president?
942863695042043904 2017-12-18 21:06:37 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU You know what to do.
942863294389473280 2017-12-18 21:05:01 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich Youre incapable of embarrassment arent you?
942863001975173122 2017-12-18 21:03:51 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH I think thats a fraction of how many would actually turn out.
942862633925070848 2017-12-18 21:02:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump So sick of having a carnival barker with honesty issues as president.
942862429343674369 2017-12-18 21:01:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Horrific. Hope he sues the shirts off their backs.
942861415156781056 2017-12-18 20:57:33 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes, yes, yes. A fools errand.
942769983855251457 2017-12-18 14:54:14 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Sickening. The arrogance of this guy.
942759014911406081 2017-12-18 14:10:39 UTC <gaughran444> @vulture Ebony and Ivory worst ever.
942757873960054784 2017-12-18 14:06:07 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Hope he does.
942752978578165760 2017-12-18 13:46:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Agree. He should not resign.
942752860110053376 2017-12-18 13:46:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Pillow talk is a beautiful thing.
942751720605716480 2017-12-18 13:41:40 UTC <gaughran444> @EliotACohen @BillKristol Interesting how people who disagreed with Obamas foreign policies always frame it as weakness rather than simply disagree.
942739880844713985 2017-12-18 12:54:37 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen I remember this. Rude and of course wrong.
942599624396886017 2017-12-17 03:37:17 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare What a great choice.
942592542826225665 2017-12-17 03:09:09 UTC <gaughran444> @ninaturner @tiniebeany @letourneau_pat @grandoftwo @Bluepurplerain @GeoffMiami @PattyArquette @phaedra1203 @No_To_Duopoly @MrDane1982 @SchMieke Dont forget identity politics.
942589586202652672 2017-12-17 02:57:24 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @ShaneGoldmacher Wow. This is disgusting.
942563395617873922 2017-12-17 01:13:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 So many correctly spelled words, so little vitriol.
942563026603003904 2017-12-17 01:11:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @TheRickWilson @critic_social I dont think good lawyers will work for this guy. Doesnt follow advice (e.g. STFU) and probably doesnt pay his bills.
942548831740268549 2017-12-17 00:15:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Thats what Oscar Wilde said about the urge to exercise. Good advice.
942548132935733248 2017-12-17 00:12:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SeanMcElwee Went to CLS long ago. Its a much better place now bc there are a lot more people like you there. But Im feeling v up on attys these days.
942544531005870080 2017-12-17 23:58:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SeanMcElwee Mmm. Ok. Hope youre enjoying CLS & would be great to have a NLG chapter there. Good luck.
942522717143732224 2017-12-17 22:31:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SeanMcElwee Lawyers are working around the clock to take trump down.
942520150988873730 2017-12-17 22:21:29 UTC <gaughran444> @CallyGingrich @newtgingrich @Sysyfus Ill mute you, poor soul. Good luck.
942517197947199488 2017-12-17 22:09:45 UTC <gaughran444> @CallyGingrich @newtgingrich Bet the Pope cant stand you.
942516713974837249 2017-12-17 22:07:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare Oh, for some silence. If he would only shut up.
942515031970902016 2017-12-17 22:01:09 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Hey, whats on TV?
942437529139187712 2017-12-17 16:53:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCBreaking Maybe now trump will say something nice about them.
942436465371484160 2017-12-17 16:48:57 UTC <gaughran444> @Marcshort45 @MalcolmNance @MeetThePress No, its not strictly speaking a conversation. Its more like high pitched screaming in the dead of night.
942436160365912065 2017-12-17 16:47:44 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @sgrant525 Cornel West is about keeping the focus on Cornel West. Like Bernie keeps the focus on Bernie. Nothing real about it.
942435814629429248 2017-12-17 16:46:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Damn straight. And we use wild methods like voting and law enforcement. That old-fashioned democracy stuff.
942415569726386176 2017-12-17 15:25:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow I have police in my family and they hate trump. NYPD. And dont forget, not all cops are white.
942413962557186048 2017-12-17 15:19:32 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj Good for you. West is a fraud.
942412823732408326 2017-12-17 15:15:01 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Still not happy about Franken. Not so fast.
942411299660681217 2017-12-17 15:08:57 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill And by odd coincidence he is also the worst first-year president in US history.
942411006571175936 2017-12-17 15:07:47 UTC <gaughran444> @waltshaub Right. Im desperately hoping for trump to fall - and think he will - but most important is that the rule of law is upheld.
942236050067509249 2017-12-16 03:32:34 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Yeah thats why.
942235883478179841 2017-12-16 03:31:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Talked a lot. A lot. Word after word after word.
942227167961911296 2017-12-16 02:57:17 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Enough with these goddamned people.
942226667589767169 2017-12-16 02:55:17 UTC <gaughran444> @DrGMLaTulippe @PuddinHearts Little sweetheart.
942224949330300928 2017-12-16 02:48:28 UTC <gaughran444> @ATLPeach404_ Imagine the terror the GOP would feel seeing lines around the block of people with sleeping bags waiting to vote. What a beautiful thought.
942222969652305925 2017-12-16 02:40:36 UTC <gaughran444> @ATLPeach404_ Love this idea. Would be great to see it catch on. We need a new govt more than we need new phones, thats for sure.
942207641480302592 2017-12-16 01:39:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik From sea to shining sea.
942207539638341633 2017-12-16 01:39:17 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Let syphilis be syphilis. Let bubonic plague be bubonic plague.
942159529575362560 2017-12-16 22:28:30 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @TrueFactsStated Yes he seems more demented by the hour. Also hoping this despotic move will fail when challenged in court. Tricky as hell though.
942158092929830912 2017-12-16 22:22:48 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @kpmel Yes. They seem to run in packs.
942091368486309888 2017-12-16 17:57:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @BruceBartlett Whats happened to the NYT?
942082964711772160 2017-12-16 17:24:16 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper These were not trick questions. This guy knew nothing and felt no obligation to try to learn before his hearing. Unqualified and arrogant
942082361113612288 2017-12-16 17:21:52 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @KatyTurNBC I want my money back.
942081840134967296 2017-12-16 17:19:48 UTC <gaughran444> @robdelaney Nothing says happy boys room like encroaching walls of brinjal.
942033219511341056 2017-12-16 14:06:36 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Someone should slip this little cracker a hash brownie. Chill, klansman.
942032184038354945 2017-12-16 14:02:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Personally I prefer a groping, witch hunt melange.
942027199993077761 2017-12-16 13:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @RobGMacfarlane @Stephanie_K_B But 1st covers more than personal speech. These are clearly matters of public concern.
942017829347446784 2017-12-16 13:05:27 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Stop with the fortune cookies. Youre a legislator and you just sold your constituents out on the tax plan.
942017084309024768 2017-12-16 13:02:29 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Time for them to walk into a federal court.
942016772861030403 2017-12-16 13:01:15 UTC <gaughran444> @RobGMacfarlane Still dont understand how this survives a first amendment challenge.
942013253504393216 2017-12-16 12:47:16 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Guy knows nothing and apparently felt no obligation to try to learn anything before swanning into his confirmation hearing.
942012431009796097 2017-12-16 12:43:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Orrick @CivRightsCorps @LawyersComm @KristenClarkeJD Congratulations! Fantastic work!
942011172034838528 2017-12-16 12:38:59 UTC <gaughran444> @NekoCase Love!!!
941875947422273538 2017-12-15 03:41:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @KatrinaNation Take a look at Alabama. Democratic Party values. Not all that complicated.
941874025613099008 2017-12-15 03:34:01 UTC <gaughran444> @waltshaub Done.
941872908707737600 2017-12-15 03:29:35 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @Kris_Sacrebleu Its okay. We hate him, too. And there are so many more of us.
941872299594088449 2017-12-15 03:27:10 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Its sad except for the part where his father nearly destroyed our country.
941849279873810432 2017-12-15 01:55:41 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @renato_mariotti How is this not a first amendment violation?
941849153092460544 2017-12-15 01:55:11 UTC <gaughran444> @RenaSofer I would vote for this guy in a heartbeat if I could.
941833582095372288 2017-12-15 00:53:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 That was a fun one, when he went all 14-year-old girl about Putin. Crazy bastard.
941833343355666432 2017-12-15 00:52:22 UTC <gaughran444> @rezaaslan @franklinleonard Cant a public interest law group challenge this on first amendment grounds?
941830934092845056 2017-12-15 00:42:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ParkerMolloy How could this survive a first amendment claim?
941830705125900290 2017-12-15 00:41:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No - thank YOU Bone Spur Boy! Thank YOU!
941743547124015104 2017-12-15 18:55:33 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast The most jolting surprise since this mornings sunrise.
941743321017454592 2017-12-15 18:54:39 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Theyre probably all fantasizing about arresting you. Always fun to land a big one.
941701084921389057 2017-12-15 16:06:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @dumptrump1234 @Dr_S_Miller Watch this space.
941698220996071425 2017-12-15 15:55:26 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti So helpful and interesting. Thank you.
941696905070903296 2017-12-15 15:50:12 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler Poor little Sassy! I worry about her. Really.
941696777769705477 2017-12-15 15:49:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He will also be further obstructing justice.
941696490988335105 2017-12-15 15:48:33 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs An angry, old, criminally inclined Fox viewer.
941695979778117633 2017-12-15 15:46:32 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Oh, you and that against the law stuff.
941695817987043328 2017-12-15 15:45:53 UTC <gaughran444> @AP If respect for and a lifetime of devotion to the rule of law is evidence of extreme bias against this low-life, then the WH is right.
941695390671400961 2017-12-15 15:44:11 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Hes certainly stupid enough to have done so. Lets hope, hope, hope.
941694619926089728 2017-12-15 15:41:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Clam God must be fed.
941694491139985408 2017-12-15 15:40:37 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics He sounds more primitive and senile every day.
941694353055080448 2017-12-15 15:40:04 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 How dare Bone Spur Boy besmirch these fine young Americans?
941694022036480006 2017-12-15 15:38:45 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Despotic POS.
941693241652662274 2017-12-15 15:35:39 UTC <gaughran444> @jameshamblin But it would be good for the environment and nice to animals.
941653875878170629 2017-12-15 12:59:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Our President.
941648627683950593 2017-12-15 12:38:22 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @StevenTDennis Yes, and good for him for doing so.
941647461784879104 2017-12-15 12:33:44 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @DavidWright_CNN Wish the graduates could remark back.
941647348954025984 2017-12-15 12:33:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Love that.
941639433316642816 2017-12-15 12:01:50 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Webers Job Lot.
941638413425487872 2017-12-15 11:57:47 UTC <gaughran444> @GlazerRandee @girlsreallyrule Its impressive. Can you imagine appearing before him? No, your honor, you sit in that chair up there. Ill stand here. Thank you.
941637999900717057 2017-12-15 11:56:08 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Next week: Jeanine Pirro arrested for shoplifting at TJ Maxx.
941529073767116801 2017-12-14 04:43:18 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Free Sassy.
941524936795086848 2017-12-14 04:26:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Be still my heart.
941523154400407553 2017-12-14 04:19:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @riotwomennn @KatieMHill Always delighted to see my President.
941517104808976384 2017-12-14 03:55:44 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Ok will do. Its a disgrace. Cant imagine these guys presiding over a traffic court. Thank you.
941516633121714176 2017-12-14 03:53:52 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 All hail Sir Charles.
941516223883378688 2017-12-14 03:52:14 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll To whom should we speak?
941516034405740545 2017-12-14 03:51:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Hopefully he gets the opportunity.
941514459046178818 2017-12-14 03:45:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @MoaniePandium Wow. Wonder if Australian courts will agree with this pious plan.
941511873366720513 2017-12-14 03:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @Minx970 Hard to believe. Nervy.
941511667824939008 2017-12-14 03:34:08 UTC <gaughran444> @evanperez @mkraju Not as painful as having this unqualified nominee on the federal bench.
941510880776376320 2017-12-14 03:31:01 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Never took a deposition, never argued a motion, doesnt know what a motion in limine is. Ludicrous.
941505966423584768 2017-12-14 03:11:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AprilDRyan @CNN Lindsay Graham should stop trying to stimulate Donald Trump ffs.
941496813932220416 2017-12-14 02:35:07 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs A very small, feverish brain.
941495250266226688 2017-12-14 02:28:54 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Hes not going to make it that far.
941384892310605825 2017-12-14 19:10:23 UTC <gaughran444> @tedlieu Holy cow. Simple but critical question.
941341946030755841 2017-12-14 16:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 Because we live in very challenging, hallucinatory times.
941308690958831618 2017-12-14 14:07:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Very unfortunate concept.
941307599391281153 2017-12-14 14:03:15 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Mr. Identity Politics. Shameless.
941306841715363840 2017-12-14 14:00:14 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @TheRickWilson Wonderful. Yet again.
941180914884861952 2017-12-13 05:39:51 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Shameless pain in the ass.
941179817193504768 2017-12-13 05:35:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik He certainly does. Glad he said this.
941179019827040256 2017-12-13 05:32:19 UTC <gaughran444> @kenklippenstein Boo hopes you feel better soon.pic.twitter.com/7bQZaGCRnP
941123670604468225 2017-12-13 01:52:22 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien Why is anyone talking to him about last night? The guy who wrote off appealing to black voters as identity politics?
941123210703261696 2017-12-13 01:50:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Did it make you feel better to fire a black woman? Bad news big guy, theyre going to fire you!
941122039993290753 2017-12-13 01:45:54 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Working overtime. Repellant.
941059585347129344 2017-12-13 21:37:43 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Brave soul.
941059486873280514 2017-12-13 21:37:20 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Are we done talking about identity politics? Over?
941030296841007105 2017-12-13 19:41:20 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Bless his little heart. Blog on, bro!
941020043185475591 2017-12-13 19:00:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken Youre a class act and I want you to stay.
941019756357877765 2017-12-13 18:59:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TomPerez Amen. And please no more bs about identity politics. Done.
941019371853484038 2017-12-13 18:57:56 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw He will not. Think back on his ranting about rigged elections when he thought he was going to lose.
941019015488602113 2017-12-13 18:56:31 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Very. Poor little thing.
940957315435515904 2017-12-13 14:51:20 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Really. Were supposed to care about this?
940956973901762561 2017-12-13 14:49:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Last night proved that your days are numbered. Resign now for clemency.
940954037456957440 2017-12-13 14:38:19 UTC <gaughran444> @GlazerRandee Maybe hes sucking up to get SOS appointment. Its not pretty to watch.
940952443835338752 2017-12-13 14:31:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveSchmidtSES @morningmika @joanwalsh @Elise_Jordan Poor baby.
940947830293835776 2017-12-13 14:13:39 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Bannon looks ghastly. And then theres the stuff that comes out of his mouth.
940945976034058240 2017-12-13 14:06:17 UTC <gaughran444> @GoodDogPup Haha! Love it! What a happy day!!!!
940936579085930498 2017-12-13 13:28:56 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Cool spelling of media! The nation hates you. Get out while the gettings good. Resign for clemency.
940808359124652037 2017-12-12 04:59:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger But they still voted for Moore.
940803643414077441 2017-12-12 04:40:42 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Keep talking! Fantastic!!!!
940802515179884544 2017-12-12 04:36:13 UTC <gaughran444> @BagOfDicksCom @PreetBharara @MyNextLifeDebi Send him a subscription to Seventeen magazine.
940802080197005313 2017-12-12 04:34:29 UTC <gaughran444> Old pervert talking about God and a recount. Okay dude.
940801112017457152 2017-12-12 04:30:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Important lesson to learn.
940798632709718016 2017-12-12 04:20:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson The only reason I like it is because of you
940797711317651456 2017-12-12 04:17:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Thank you Doug Jones!!
940797564751962114 2017-12-12 04:16:33 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara We are!!!!!
940794832636776448 2017-12-12 04:05:41 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Fantastic!!!!!
940794644950147077 2017-12-12 04:04:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik You and me both! Run along, little dogie! Haha!
940792008637116418 2017-12-12 03:54:28 UTC <gaughran444> @ava @neeratanden @JamilSmith Beautiful!!!!!
940790952561606656 2017-12-12 03:50:16 UTC <gaughran444> Hey Moore! Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!! God bless America!!!! Welcome Senator Jones!!!
940771615146684416 2017-12-12 02:33:26 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Helpful. Thanks.
940770334608973825 2017-12-12 02:28:21 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio @NoFilterInMe Did he? Okay, screw him.
940759120415731712 2017-12-12 01:43:47 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Go Senator Rubio! Be a man of the people.
940662984279543810 2017-12-12 19:21:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein He should delete his presidency.
940585638574911488 2017-12-12 14:14:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump How many abortions have you paid for?
940574438751461381 2017-12-12 13:29:55 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Because they tell him what he wants to hear and hes dumb.
940573954779033600 2017-12-12 13:28:00 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Back when our president had a heart.
940561784062271489 2017-12-12 12:39:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Wish to hell I was a scientist.
940434272015536128 2017-12-11 04:12:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Very ticked off about this. Franken was one of our best senators. A fighter at a time when we desperately need to fight.
940433894238715905 2017-12-11 04:11:27 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Thats a very mild word for a child molester.
940433379920621568 2017-12-11 04:09:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @SenGillibrand Id rather have Al Franken in the senate than this posturing.
940404682190737410 2017-12-11 02:15:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @bridgetbhc Get whom? 14 year old girls? Beneficiaries of the 15th amendment?
940404379429097473 2017-12-11 02:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Thank you NYPD.
940398782251978752 2017-12-11 01:51:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @TinaMcGugan Me too. Remember when he said Katherine Graham was going to get her tit caught in a wringer? Weve had dogs in the AGs office before.
940398337626435589 2017-12-11 01:50:10 UTC <gaughran444> @jonathanchait @traceygaughran Really. Is the common man an angry freak who appears not to shower? That seems kind of snobbish to me.
940394761147609088 2017-12-11 01:35:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @TinaMcGugan I know. Poor thing. Her husband was horrible.
940392602444222464 2017-12-11 01:27:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @TinaMcGugan I thought she was cool, honest and like a hostage.
940386153785626624 2017-12-11 01:01:45 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @Saving_TheDogs Good luck sweetie!
940382602623635459 2017-12-11 00:47:38 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidRivkin @WSJ Yes.
940381947020398592 2017-12-11 00:45:02 UTC <gaughran444> @daveweigel @Bencjacobs A little nostalgia is always nice.
940378827821387781 2017-12-11 00:32:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Heinzilla @jaketapper @critic_social With this and a metrocard you can ride the subway. Id rather have Franken in the senate than her posturing.
940270056721838080 2017-12-11 17:20:25 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @benjaminhaddad Why the hell not? Would fit right into this administration.
940268727597195265 2017-12-11 17:15:08 UTC <gaughran444> @IngrahamAngle New Yorkers, who bear the brunt of this type of terrorism in the US, dont engage in this bigoted hate mongering. Were better than that.

940080218001219589 2017-12-10 04:46:04 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @MarkRuffalo It could also mobilize the white people to vote against Jones.

940077094641442817 2017-12-10 04:33:39 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Deeply unsettling.
940073856974299142 2017-12-10 04:20:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Bros4America Seriously. Wtf.
940066037541650432 2017-12-10 03:49:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 A real US Justice Department would get the hell down there.
940065736965234689 2017-12-10 03:48:31 UTC <gaughran444> @funder @TheDemCoalition At the risk of sounding like an old person, nothing is more encouraging in terms of Americas future than seeing young people like these.
940065128866705408 2017-12-10 03:46:06 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @erin0915 Yes that was a bad, hallucinatory moment when that nasty cracker broke into Russian. Thank god for dogs.
940064881398620162 2017-12-10 03:45:07 UTC <gaughran444> @KFILE @natemcdermott The 14th amendment was enacted to protect black southerners from guys like him. Truly.
940064647918493696 2017-12-10 03:44:12 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Is that what the ass-kissing overdrive is about? Getting truly tedious.
940064289489956864 2017-12-10 03:42:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DanielSeidemann My father, WWII vet, had a stroke in his 80s. Was asked who the president was. Eyes closed, said Unfortunately, George W Bush.
940063191010177024 2017-12-10 03:38:24 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Good point. I wish Alabama could secede like they tried to do last time. Its just not working out.
940062252232671232 2017-12-10 03:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet @kpmel A vague sense of discomfort. So so hard to say why . . .
939960602373644289 2017-12-10 20:50:45 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel @TheRynheart Saw that. Very creepy.
939946096159350784 2017-12-10 19:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon She has a law enforcement background. What an utter disgrace she is. Bet the police she worked with are disgusted.
939892687582441477 2017-12-10 16:20:53 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy The propaganda-spewing trout has spoken.
939892058973790208 2017-12-10 16:18:23 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse What a farce. The Racist in Chief had no place there.
939687346357915648 2017-12-09 02:44:56 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Was she not? Didnt pay close attention. Saw her on tv, assumed was. Just so mad about this.
939685100245143552 2017-12-09 02:36:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MtnMD When does the breathing stop?
939682628319481857 2017-12-09 02:26:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Immigrants make our country great. Always have. Go fuck yourself.
939678755584401408 2017-12-09 02:10:48 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Nice first amendment case. Seriously.
939659198052360193 2017-12-09 00:53:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @peterdaou Hard to see. How weve fallen.
939653509582151680 2017-12-09 00:30:29 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 It is.
939653273719656448 2017-12-09 00:29:33 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy The little hand thing troubles him too.
939652557730873345 2017-12-09 00:26:42 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid The less this dangerous imbecile does the better.
939619200548720645 2017-12-09 22:14:09 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand Very unhappy with you. Al Franken should remain in the senate.
939586490199355392 2017-12-09 20:04:10 UTC <gaughran444> @rosannecash Courage!

939570470554423300 2017-12-09 19:00:31 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @thehill Wheres the congressional inquiry on this? This poor child.
939569224674136064 2017-12-09 18:55:34 UTC <gaughran444> @valerieonmaui I remember that. Im with you.
939568727435161601 2017-12-09 18:53:35 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Isnt it a little soon to come to that conclusion?
939568523646562304 2017-12-09 18:52:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Profoundly stupid, in that uniquely Democratic self-inflicted wound way.
939555144957603843 2017-12-09 17:59:37 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Dear god. How horrible.
939554916879818752 2017-12-09 17:58:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Its beneath John Lewiss considerable dignity to interact with that piece of garbage.
939509865172668416 2017-12-09 14:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @NatGeo This is heartbreaking.
939509518391750658 2017-12-09 14:58:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CREWcrew I want my money back. And we better not have paid for that stupid hat.
939509284974493696 2017-12-09 14:57:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Makes sense that a serial sexual predator would embrace a serial child molester.
939508971286728704 2017-12-09 14:56:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thats your fan base. Loud, loving and really smart. Like the Huns.
939508317298352128 2017-12-09 14:53:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Heartbreaking.
939508202575749121 2017-12-09 14:53:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your tweets feel like something issuing from a psychiatric facility. Or a prison.
939463712905334785 2017-12-09 11:56:18 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Im not crying. Youre crying.
939334215350542336 2017-12-08 03:21:43 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare Dear god yes. Get him the hell out of here.
939333957937745920 2017-12-08 03:20:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This is a cruel disaster.

939326241135583232 2017-12-08 02:50:02 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 What, did he have paper towels he wanted to lob at them?
939325599004463105 2017-12-08 02:47:29 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Hes been ghastly for decades. Cant believe hes still in the public eye.
939323747135311872 2017-12-08 02:40:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This is what trump voters voted for.
939232696345260032 2017-12-08 20:38:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Yes. Its called evolution.
939228896700129280 2017-12-08 20:23:13 UTC <gaughran444> @olgakhazan @KaraCalavera Hell never say, but anyone whos ever had a family member decline with dementia can tell you.
939228016248487937 2017-12-08 20:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JessicaTaylor @nprpolitics Because of course fetuses rights trump the rights of teen-age girls. Post-utero children dont matter.
939227134626852865 2017-12-08 20:16:13 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Because Democrats are jittery and over-reactive and republicans are tough and wholly amoral.
939184966239432705 2017-12-08 17:28:39 UTC <gaughran444> @KaraCalavera @eclecticbrotha He is horrendous.
939184747338715136 2017-12-08 17:27:47 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand Al Franken should still be in the senate. Not happy with you.
939176427299262466 2017-12-08 16:54:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @snarkylicious Cute! Let it snow!
939153867111129089 2017-12-08 15:25:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Franken should have hung tough. This was a mistake.
939118398721622018 2017-12-08 13:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand @MaryMarybrogdon @AUkeibro Dammit it hell. We dont need utter purity. We need fighters.
939099896971497472 2017-12-08 11:50:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Imbecile did you ever consider why?
939095398630780928 2017-12-08 11:32:45 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateDems @alfranken @nikangel39 @critic_social Good point. I thought of the Jacobins, but weve got plenty of horrible examples right here. Goddammit.
939094675616608257 2017-12-08 11:29:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand @MaryMarybrogdon @AUkeibro Yes - she was linked to Roger Stone right? And even if the rest were completely legit, it was all before he was a senator. No due process.
938992479860269057 2017-12-07 04:43:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @SLSmith000 This guy is really bad. And hes just getting started.
938990106995671041 2017-12-07 04:34:21 UTC <gaughran444> @OhNoSheTwitnt I want more women in government too, but the old fashioned way. With elections.
938989597014372352 2017-12-07 04:32:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand @MaryMarybrogdon @AUkeibro Went back & forth on this and have decided it was a mistake. One of our best senators out with no investigation, no due process. Not good.
938985506205028352 2017-12-07 04:16:04 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @soledadobrien Many white people know it too.
938974383871315971 2017-12-07 03:31:53 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @PatrickW Old white people should be repulsed too.
938972554286522369 2017-12-07 03:24:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateDems @alfranken @nikangel39 @critic_social Thats the issue. A person can lose what theyve worked a lifetime for without any investigation or due process? Big mistake.
938920291878744066 2017-12-07 23:56:56 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateDems @alfranken @nikangel39 @critic_social Yeah, I have to agree. Weve lost one of our strongest senators on the altar of purity. At least do an investigation first.
938913572331118594 2017-12-07 23:30:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateDems @alfranken @nikangel39 @critic_social Gone back and forth on this but am coming out in your camp. He should have hung tough. Especially if all allegations occurred pre-senate.
938912911220756482 2017-12-07 23:27:36 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory Are we a theocracy now? Wtf?
938912727942221827 2017-12-07 23:26:53 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Hope it includes a brain scan. Check if anythings in there.
938858934705819649 2017-12-07 19:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TinaMcGugan Kind of like Studio 54 in the early 80s.
938843939846619136 2017-12-07 18:53:32 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen He has no ethics. None whatsoever. #SociopathInChief
938843625651400706 2017-12-07 18:52:17 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @aravosis No. There is absolutely nothing. Child molestation, sexual aggression. Its all okay with the Republican Party.
938843159823638528 2017-12-07 18:50:26 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken Beyond sad to see you go. Had hoped to see you run for President.
938838906824527873 2017-12-07 18:33:32 UTC <gaughran444> @alfranken @DavidJollyFL I hope so.
938830398536155136 2017-12-07 17:59:44 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hope you can keep tweeting in prison. Would be sad to deprive America of your sparkling wit.
938606003557412869 2017-12-06 03:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> The ambitious woman is the cousin of the uppity negro. Sick of it.
938604640693903361 2017-12-06 03:02:39 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Terrible.

938558737849167874 2017-12-06 00:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @AP What happened to the GOP vaunted concern for states rights?
938558522740170752 2017-12-06 23:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @christinawilkie Our insane president has isolated and degraded us.
938557160623165441 2017-12-06 23:53:59 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm @BridgeProject21 Yes. And see Michelle and Hillary trying not to vomit while schmucko gets sworn in.
938517358615941121 2017-12-06 21:15:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson He doesnt drink. Quaaludes? Elephant tranquilizer?

938512122836934657 2017-12-06 20:55:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SykesCharlie If the GOP had a collective conscience Frankens resignation would put pressure on re Moore. But theyve none whatsoever. See: the taxscam.
938423547319463936 2017-12-06 15:03:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Okay! Now talk to your lawyers about resigning in exchange for clemency for you and your family.

938240495892955136 2017-12-05 02:55:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @JaneGrader Yes - horrible. They dont need more hostility & violence so this bastard can pose as a friend of Israel.

938172350104850432 2017-12-05 22:24:53 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH @NBCNews Good. He certainly should not.
938171559893708800 2017-12-05 22:21:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind Trump has been an overt racist for decades.
938171003334774784 2017-12-05 22:19:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I will place flowers on it every year. For real.
938169709907927051 2017-12-05 22:14:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Remember when you called him a kook, crazy and compared him to a disease?
938144657283969024 2017-12-05 20:34:50 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes @GoodDogPup We need each and everyone one!
938113808802992130 2017-12-05 18:32:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This fake hetero-holey-roller has been measuring the curtains since day one.
938113431894446086 2017-12-05 18:30:46 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos A better approach even than sending Jared.
938034496741564416 2017-12-05 13:17:06 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @POTUS @sunnysingh_n6 @TomWellborn They wont protect our children - see chip expiration - but they will molest them. The family values party.
938032552006356993 2017-12-05 13:09:22 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Not too vile for her husband to work for and endlessly suck up to.
938028435171106816 2017-12-05 12:53:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Biggest smile of the day. Much needed. Thanks.
938027340948541443 2017-12-05 12:48:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @jelani9 Exactly. We need her. She misses nothing.
937872441971499013 2017-12-04 02:33:09 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind Child molestation and crushing the middle class. Nice platform.
937859845277003777 2017-12-04 01:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @SethAbramson Hes a trump man and kind of a nut now. Hes theories are outlandish.
937859549746298880 2017-12-04 01:41:55 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner Or you can lie in court and the jury can conclude that youre lying and convict you. Kind of how most Americans currently view Trump.
937858956982194176 2017-12-04 01:39:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Wait till the midterms, grandma killer.
937803214988161024 2017-12-04 21:58:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This is a joke, right?
937790367142948866 2017-12-04 21:07:01 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Dershowitz is way smarter than you but sadly at this point almost as crazy.
937695147080454144 2017-12-04 14:48:39 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Its not about cake either.
937695032840253442 2017-12-04 14:48:12 UTC <gaughran444> @adamliptak @steve_vladeck Terrible.
937694724563054598 2017-12-04 14:46:58 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Didnt work for Nixon, wont work for this crook.
937694526709424129 2017-12-04 14:46:11 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Soon you can add nice shots of people deprived of medical care, rich guys counting their money.
937686915314266112 2017-12-04 14:15:56 UTC <gaughran444> @NatashaBertrand Is Giuliani locked in a closet somewhere? Not complaining, just curious.
937685750207991809 2017-12-04 14:11:18 UTC <gaughran444> @ClintSmithIII There is nothing better. Enjoy!
937681738037387270 2017-12-04 13:55:22 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller What good lawyer would represent him? Wont follow direction and will stiff you.
937681200663138304 2017-12-04 13:53:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @KenDilanianNBC That worked out well.
937679715531403266 2017-12-04 13:47:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Is he setting up an insanity defense?
937544226073726978 2017-12-03 04:48:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Sure. Clinton was.
937515917210259456 2017-12-03 02:56:27 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @nytimes Depressing.
937511913055051777 2017-12-03 02:40:32 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCOUT @JoyAnnReid @MrDane1982 @Patrickesque @FireJoy_Ried Okay my friend. I dont deal with Bernie Bros etc theres a lot of serious stuff going on. Gonna block you but wish you well. Bye.

937493417252327425 2017-12-03 01:27:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Could not miss him more.
937477755276578816 2017-12-03 00:24:49 UTC <gaughran444> @AndrewRestuccia @politico How about the whole world?
937469805560516608 2017-12-03 23:53:13 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNnewsroom @TeaPainUSA @INKY8971 @oesmom1 @critic_social Maybe trumps got everyone locked in a room and hes menacing them with that pants steamer he likes so much.
937469373815640065 2017-12-03 23:51:30 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNnewsroom @TeaPainUSA @critic_social @INKY8971 I think hell bail.
937469262133891073 2017-12-03 23:51:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNnewsroom @TeaPainUSA @critic_social No he didnt. It had the incomparable style and logic of the Fool in Chief.
937462865191153664 2017-12-03 23:25:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Impolitics Hopefully hell be otherwise occupied by then.
937461803113689088 2017-12-03 23:21:25 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNnewsroom @TeaPainUSA @critic_social Why would a lawyer draft a tweet implicating his client in obstruction of justice? Doesnt seem like a great atty but no ones that bad.
937459783824789504 2017-12-03 23:13:24 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCOUT @JoyAnnReid Were good.
937426645815910401 2017-12-03 21:01:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Thats great fun! Thanks!
937421045950271489 2017-12-03 20:39:28 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Looks like a turtle, acts like a worm.
937420783865024513 2017-12-03 20:38:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 When this woman makes such a promise it is truly meaningful.
937420338106978304 2017-12-03 20:36:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax No question. Only racists feel whites are oppressed. You have to defy basic reality to take such a perverse position.
937419398884810752 2017-12-03 20:32:55 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Disgraceful.
937419171582873600 2017-12-03 20:32:01 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor Wow. Sounds like an alcoholic with bottles stashed around. Oy vey.
937418650771951618 2017-12-03 20:29:57 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Jesus would have condemned Donald Trump in no uncertain terms.
937345613657722880 2017-12-03 15:39:43 UTC <gaughran444> @ezraklein And Dowd is Trumps Rosemary Woods.
937344894493917184 2017-12-03 15:36:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JulianAssange @MalcolmNance Youre a blast.
937344721554419712 2017-12-03 15:36:11 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Hes been just awful. But he was once a highly respected guy. Strange.
937343526844723201 2017-12-03 15:31:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @Lawrence Tough call.
937335226765848577 2017-12-03 14:58:27 UTC <gaughran444> @NatashaBertrand @waltshaub Seriously. I wonder if he gets that.
937332670354386944 2017-12-03 14:48:18 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Knew hed cave. Repulsive.
937328721131909121 2017-12-03 14:32:36 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @BarristerSecret I learned that too! And its fun.

937071721840041985 2017-12-02 21:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Who grabbed your phone?
937044284355866624 2017-12-02 19:42:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MattAsherS @matthewamiller I'm almost feeling warmth towards the Babbling Idiot in Chief. He should put exhibit tags on his tweets. Such a helpful fellow.
936984392731430918 2017-12-02 15:44:22 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Dont kid yourself. Nothing is worse than that. Nothing.
936982578514538496 2017-12-02 15:37:09 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix I  NY.
936979853278175232 2017-12-02 15:26:19 UTC <gaughran444> @cvermar @chrislhayes @critic_social Really true. Counting the days till the midterm election. We need a blue tsunami to push these bastards out.
936978629187293184 2017-12-02 15:21:28 UTC <gaughran444> @funder The Obstructor in Chief. Thank goodness hes so damn dumb. He will go down.
936975032944857088 2017-12-02 15:07:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik The lines are drawn. Midterm elections cant come soon enough.
936974727633129473 2017-12-02 15:05:57 UTC <gaughran444> @clairecmc @neeratanden Love her. The best.
936974514528899072 2017-12-02 15:05:07 UTC <gaughran444> @cvermar @chrislhayes @critic_social Tax breaks for private school?? Good idea for schools for disabled children. But not for Exeter, etc. Sickening.
936967414788558849 2017-12-02 14:36:54 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Thats a polite way to put it. What happened to him? He might have been a contrarian at times, now hes nonsensical.
936966797512802304 2017-12-02 14:34:27 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH @Filth800 I couldnt love this more.

936784155798487040 2017-12-01 02:28:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @mmfa When the going gets tough, the racists blame the black guy.
936778025693147137 2017-12-01 02:04:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Republicans would fight like hell against this. But its a great idea.
936776391084797952 2017-12-01 01:57:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TinaMorphis @jaketapper @dissentingj It wont be pretty.
936770506279174144 2017-12-01 01:34:27 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger Yes. That must have been some proffer.
936770084709658624 2017-12-01 01:32:47 UTC <gaughran444> @andylassner @jaloysius @KerryTweeterson Good & important point. Nixon & his guys were crooks who wanted control. They werent traitors. Were in unchartered territory.
936769475185119232 2017-12-01 01:30:21 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Actually we did.
936764528662106112 2017-12-01 01:10:42 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 We have no choice. We have to.
936740850855489536 2017-12-01 23:36:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Pros v schmoes.
936740584563380225 2017-12-01 23:35:33 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorCollins Vote no. Do the right thing. You dont have to defend a good decision.
936740208862691329 2017-12-01 23:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Dumb in every way. And cruel. I represent children with disabilities and hate how the republicans treat the most vulnerable among us.
936723636265897984 2017-12-01 22:28:13 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @CallyGingrich Hes not supposed to hate people, but Ill bet the Pope hates you both.
936723063051292672 2017-12-01 22:25:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated 100% right. And yet, I hear trumpets sounding! Hark!
936722356181127169 2017-12-01 22:23:07 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump @TVietor08 So far so good.
936721921101713409 2017-12-01 22:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Tie this bill around their necks 11/18.
936721752813637632 2017-12-01 22:20:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AGSchneiderman @MichaelSkolnik Extraordinary. Good.
936721431882330112 2017-12-01 22:19:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Must be terrible. Really sorry.
936717828325036037 2017-12-01 22:05:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Bottoms up Tea!
936716342027276289 2017-12-01 21:59:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Thats so awful. Im really sorry to hear this. Just terrible.
936715529661960193 2017-12-01 21:56:00 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 How about someone with a smidgen of relevant experience?
936715072134664193 2017-12-01 21:54:11 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Feeling a little better my friend? Tax stuff is horrendous but Flynn Friday is pretty good right?
936714773567336448 2017-12-01 21:52:59 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm When in doubt blame the black guy. Ridiculous.
936714493366808576 2017-12-01 21:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your tax claims are total bullshit but this Flynn stuff is for real!!!!! Youre going down bro!!!!

936702374080647168 2017-12-01 21:03:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Not having any more children, but hereby swear to name all future pets Robert Mueller. My hero. For real.
936578468162297856 2017-12-01 12:51:22 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Surprised its not more. Worth every penny. How much have we spent flying trump cabinet members on private planes?
936578204386648066 2017-12-01 12:50:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Worth every penny. Keep going, Mr. Mueller.
936576321471287297 2017-12-01 12:42:50 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen White people want Obama back too. Trust me.

936427191075856385 2017-11-30 02:50:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Olivianuzzi This piece of garbage can run for Congress while many convicted of felonies cant even vote.
936426602862440449 2017-11-30 02:47:54 UTC <gaughran444> @Yamiche Congratulations! Always enjoy watching you & look forward to more!
936422413583224832 2017-11-30 02:31:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Great state of mind evidence. Primitive fool has done everything but sky-write his motives.
936422053326020608 2017-11-30 02:29:50 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @TPM Do the right thing Susan. For gods sake.
936414750635851776 2017-11-30 02:00:48 UTC <gaughran444> @FullFrontalSamB Oh man. Can someone give him a party and tell him his term is over? Maybe hell buy it and clear out.
936414446758612992 2017-11-30 01:59:36 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Huge deal.
936414149239853058 2017-11-30 01:58:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Fear not, he will.
936410438568464384 2017-11-30 01:43:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are the anti-Christ, but thanks for the nice story.

936219673758195712 2017-11-30 13:05:39 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory What a national treasure this guy is. How old is he already?
936213441991380992 2017-11-30 12:40:53 UTC <gaughran444> @lasesana Exactly right.
936056501113884677 2017-11-29 02:17:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @NBCNews This is what crazy looks like. Its dangerous for a man in his position. #25thAmendmentNow
936055487744921600 2017-11-29 02:13:14 UTC <gaughran444> @justinjm1 Oh please.
936055220093808642 2017-11-29 02:12:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You need psychiatric care and rest. Ask your lawyer to arrange for clemency in exchange for your resignation.
936054890845044736 2017-11-29 02:10:51 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC I want a president who isnt deranged and dangerous. You know he is, now start protecting your country.
936033245837307905 2017-11-29 00:44:51 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @renato_mariotti I hope she gets tossed. We could all use a little cheering up.
936030593250484226 2017-11-29 00:34:18 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC The 25th amendment is for this exact circumstance. Trump is incapacitated and a danger to the republic. Where are the patriots?
935993688173502466 2017-11-29 22:07:39 UTC <gaughran444> @keithboykin Swimming under water and colonoscopies are good for this too.
935989847721959425 2017-11-29 21:52:24 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics Try targeting him on mental health and fitness for office.
935989649864118295 2017-11-29 21:51:37 UTC <gaughran444> @tonyschwartz Are there no republicans in Congress who give a hoot about their nations safety? The 25th amendment is for this precisely.
935936914112307200 2017-11-29 18:22:03 UTC <gaughran444> @owillis @Shareblue This cowardly bastard. Cares more about paying off his donors than the nations safety.
935935121240350725 2017-11-29 18:14:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This is dangerous. Where are the patriots? This is precisely what the 25th amendment is for.
935934635590201346 2017-11-29 18:13:00 UTC <gaughran444> @latinovictoryus Yes, this really worries me. Those who are not wealthy and powerful. Who stands up for them?
935934340143382528 2017-11-29 18:11:50 UTC <gaughran444> Whos next? Mr Rogers? Captain Kangaroo? Such a bummer.
935872923449085952 2017-11-29 14:07:47 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Thats right. And their man has delivered big time.
935872266688221184 2017-11-29 14:05:10 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 The old GOP is on a collision course with youth and demographics. Our nation is echoing with their ugly death rattles.
935861552871243776 2017-11-29 13:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Redone68 Ok. I havent followed his views on Israel, was thinking more about his claims re the 1st amend. which are bizarre. Anyway wish you well.
935704292358574080 2017-11-28 02:57:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Will miss the stache.
935704150142279680 2017-11-28 02:57:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @PressSec What a deft satirist.
935699634659430400 2017-11-28 02:39:12 UTC <gaughran444> @KieranSuckling @CenterForBioDiv Go get em! Thank you!
935688505426087936 2017-11-28 01:54:58 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Everywhere I go I see people desperate to get rid of your boss but very wary of you.
935616165640069120 2017-11-28 21:07:31 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood So reassured. Thanks!
935616050288365569 2017-11-28 21:07:03 UTC <gaughran444> @gbpressgazette @PRyan The GOP tax scam will crush the middle class and reward your wealthy donors. As you well know.

935489431825539072 2017-11-28 12:43:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AlanDersh @Redone68 Well, not really. Law is subject to interpretations but some of his recent explanations are outlandish. Try reading about it.
935359502769156096 2017-11-27 04:07:38 UTC <gaughran444> @LaguardiaCG @thehill Give the guy credit. Hes a devoted racist.
935347537296453632 2017-11-27 03:20:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Im ready Tea! We need deliverance from the dangerous imbecile!
935347314776035329 2017-11-27 03:19:12 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU These dignified men went to the trouble to come see this rambling idiot. Painful to watch.
935139144006856704 2017-11-27 13:32:00 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Oh damn.
935000240855420930 2017-11-26 04:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko I think shes just not too bright. She really should pipe down.
934999547838910465 2017-11-26 04:17:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA And were hearing a small fraction of what he and his peeps are doing.
934998947181072386 2017-11-26 04:14:55 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll @DanikaSidoti If everyone stood up every time you entered a room and everyone laughed like hell at even your lamest jokes youd live a long time too.
934998550894833664 2017-11-26 04:13:20 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. And I think the investigations will bring them down.
934983447227052032 2017-11-26 03:13:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MercyForAnimals Dont eat pork. Just dont.
934982625504235521 2017-11-26 03:10:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Love this guy.
934982283123142656 2017-11-26 03:08:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes, the courts are being savaged among other things. But weve got 2018 around the corner & crim.investigation closing in on WH thugs.
934979754016591873 2017-11-26 02:58:39 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh @tribelaw Dershowitz frequently takes outlandish, clearly mistaken positions now. He really seems off.
934973588888866816 2017-11-26 02:34:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Not even if you click your ruby slippers. We need to vote in 2018, and 2020, and in every damn election in our lives. Thats the way out.
934972967162908672 2017-11-26 02:31:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This is such a dark time. I honestly think things will get better - fully believe that - but damn is this tough.
934967391045419008 2017-11-26 02:09:31 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Mr. Impulse Control.

934964930876461056 2017-11-26 01:59:44 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Its just awful. Like the spread of a disease.
934962067118985218 2017-11-26 01:48:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Horrifying. Can you imagine how the people who work there feel?
934959848218923010 2017-11-26 01:39:33 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Federal judges tend to last forever. The gift that keeps on giving. Decades of consequences for each appointment.
934959189230800896 2017-11-26 01:36:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Killjoys.
934959090362658817 2017-11-26 01:36:32 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @TheRickWilson Good. Not a moment too soon.
934943696054902786 2017-11-26 00:35:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Dear god I hope so. Am worried about this.
934908371496505345 2017-11-26 22:15:00 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 It wasnt. And none of us heard it or saw the videotape. Youre imagining things. We all are.
934905637313662981 2017-11-26 22:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Absolutely critical.
934895113834323968 2017-11-26 21:22:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Moronic and Grandiose Ass.

934878923980144641 2017-11-26 20:17:59 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @crooksandliars Traitor to her gender. Okay Carly. Got it.
934878552507416577 2017-11-26 20:16:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Right. Since when do we need to follow the rules of criminal procedure when basic common sense and careful thought are called for?
934877167078596608 2017-11-26 20:11:00 UTC <gaughran444> @tomwatson Shes pathetic. Ive long been embarrassed that she is one of the two women op-ed writers for the nyt. With so many great alternatives.
934857964879532034 2017-11-26 18:54:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila And so so arrogant. She should stop talking about politics. Period.
934857471793025024 2017-11-26 18:52:44 UTC <gaughran444> @rogertansey @anneapplebaum This is a brilliant article.
934853215891460096 2017-11-26 18:35:50 UTC <gaughran444> @mitchellreports Low point in American history. We all knew she was telling the truth & he was lying. And there he sits to this day, meting out injustice.
934852555854761989 2017-11-26 18:33:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I think as a general rule shes pretty damned good. But this is an absolute mistake.
934847688092344320 2017-11-26 18:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 The visigoths are ascendant. For now.
934806597808918529 2017-11-26 15:30:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Without the nerve to say the guys name or use the word endorse. Invertebrate.
934802057294467075 2017-11-26 15:12:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 So very disgusting.
934797053355491328 2017-11-26 14:52:39 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Unacceptable. The settled to avoid rigors of protracted litigation thing is pure bs and everyone knows it. Insulting to all.
934796474981994497 2017-11-26 14:50:21 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 Must smell divine. Enjoy!
934792347489062912 2017-11-26 14:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You can probably arrange for clemency in exchange for your resignation. Ask the guy with the weird mustache about that.

934775389100142592 2017-11-26 13:26:34 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel The one & only way in which he will have surpassed his predecessor. Okay, he probably eats more too.
934775006323757057 2017-11-26 13:25:03 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @TrueFactsStated Perfect. And please turn the grounds into refuge for elephants.
934612578420101121 2017-11-25 02:39:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What a pathetic excuse for a man. If you werent destroying our country Id feel sorry for you.
934611255050100737 2017-11-25 02:34:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Theres no fate too cruel for him. But most of all just want him to go the f away. Far, far away.

933155741673730049 2017-11-21 02:10:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ We had it for Obama. Its only been gone for a year. Replaced by horror.
933142523148734464 2017-11-21 01:18:09 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Oh yes. Detested in nyc for decades.
933141525998878720 2017-11-21 01:14:11 UTC <gaughran444> Steve Schmidt re Roy Moore: prisoners in a penitentiary have a higher moral standard than the west wing.
933086738167287808 2017-11-21 21:36:28 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Okay no more pardons from the WH till next thanksgiving right?
933086218740490241 2017-11-21 21:34:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @nowthisnews Im not crying. Youre crying.
933039556638724097 2017-11-21 18:28:59 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast What soul?
933038894928494592 2017-11-21 18:26:22 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Hearing the words trump and pardon in the same sentence is unnerving.
933037560468828160 2017-11-21 18:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Just dont pardon Don Jr and were all good.
933037453312692231 2017-11-21 18:20:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No. Racist bastards. Inflicting so much wholly unnecessary misery.
933036946145779712 2017-11-21 18:18:37 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Hes probably warming up for more pardons to come.
932988450252390401 2017-11-21 15:05:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA I realize he has more weighty factors to consider, but would appreciate a few indictments before thanksgiving.   Holiday fun.
932988053802684416 2017-11-21 15:04:20 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Very important.
932987928334274561 2017-11-21 15:03:50 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Haha! If the lawyer is smart theres a clause in the retainer agreement requiring that.
932977890853031944 2017-11-21 14:23:57 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan You know full well that this tax scheme will hurt the middle class. But thanks for using black cartoon people. Mighty white of you.
932947591368671232 2017-11-21 12:23:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Donald Trump hates black people.
932946358323040256 2017-11-21 12:18:39 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Sssshhhhh.
932942096314626049 2017-11-21 12:01:43 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Nazis.
932788404965822464 2017-11-20 01:51:00 UTC <gaughran444> @FoxNews @seanhannity @newtgingrich Thanks for the heads up. Will watch ice melt instead.
932774122299502594 2017-11-20 00:54:15 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie Wonderfully reassuring.
932728117449412614 2017-11-20 21:51:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Maybe the 5 or 10 guys who have not harassed women can identify themselves. Might save some time.
932691690158161926 2017-11-20 19:26:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Olivianuzzi @SteveSchmidtSES She seems high or drunk on tv a lot. Wonder if that was a factor.
932680561730228224 2017-11-20 18:42:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @MikeDoak4 Scum.
932468955339481088 2017-11-19 04:41:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @MikeLevinCA Worry not. Hes a mutant.
932468823990718464 2017-11-19 04:41:06 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Pathetic wretch.
932466962453663744 2017-11-19 04:33:42 UTC <gaughran444> @EdKrassen She needs a lawyer. Clear 1st amendment violation.
932466752356831232 2017-11-19 04:32:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Amen.

932465984522391553 2017-11-19 04:29:49 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @majortominor Really? From whom?
932465832042680320 2017-11-19 04:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @hels So true.
931969855179370498 2017-11-18 19:38:23 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Eat with your back to the wall.
931969782408208384 2017-11-18 19:38:05 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara You sound pretty freaked out. Stay strong.
931961663615651840 2017-11-18 19:05:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson No doubt.
931961553871691776 2017-11-18 19:05:24 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Make it stop. Just make it stop.
931961236186652675 2017-11-18 19:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @KenDilanianNBC Is this a joke?
931960677924732930 2017-11-18 19:01:55 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I find him terrifying. Joan better eat with her back to a wall.
931955129321951232 2017-11-18 18:39:52 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost He should apologize (which he did) and not do it again. He should continue being an excellent senator. Enough.
931954906038140931 2017-11-18 18:38:59 UTC <gaughran444> @EdKrassen Or a toxic waste dump calling the kettle black.
931954724374568960 2017-11-18 18:38:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @Cernovich They are always hiding something. See, eg, our esteemed Vice President. Its not normal to want to monitor others sex lives.
931937472380063744 2017-11-18 17:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel I hope she reproduces by fission.
931869938507272193 2017-11-18 13:01:21 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox Are these people good at anything other than taking peoples money? Doesnt seem so.
931869675788652544 2017-11-18 13:00:18 UTC <gaughran444> @alfranken @tribelaw Absolutely. Illogical piece, illogical conclusion. Dems have to stop self-destructing. His behavior warranted an apology and he apologized.
931739851866755072 2017-11-17 04:24:26 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Busted.
931739750519787520 2017-11-17 04:24:02 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @bravenak @critic_social I want to hear more about the Roger Stone connection. And I want liberals to stop calling for Franken to resign. Get a grip people!
931739007066759168 2017-11-17 04:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @krassenstein They would have been burning crosses on the White House lawn.
931707433608732672 2017-11-17 02:15:37 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Super ugly. Everything looks like its been soaking in formaldehyde.
931696608869339136 2017-11-17 01:32:36 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH Thank you Captain Fiero for your great bravery and patriotism.
931684805254746114 2017-11-17 00:45:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Remember when we thought Karl Rove was gross?
931653512571899904 2017-11-17 22:41:21 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller @kpmel I dont know. Steered clear of their meetings.
931651245835681792 2017-11-17 22:32:20 UTC <gaughran444> @christinawilkie You can say that again girlfriend.
931636759418560512 2017-11-17 21:34:47 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller I remember the federalist society guys in law school. They were a total laugh riot. Nothing funnier than curtailing civil rights.
931636465984929792 2017-11-17 21:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan You think Americans are so dumb that if you promise them simplicity they wont notice theyre getting ripped off. They notice.
931623641636360192 2017-11-17 20:42:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @SenatorLeahy Sigh.
931620351662067712 2017-11-17 20:29:35 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @Mikel_Jollett Absolutely. And they succeeded repeatedly.
931619919426473986 2017-11-17 20:27:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TopherSpiro Is it me or are women the quiet conscience of the Senate? No drama, they just do the right thing.
931619434187427842 2017-11-17 20:25:56 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 The self-appointed messiah.
931619002761334784 2017-11-17 20:24:13 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Nothing cuter than an impish perjurer.
931492079628439552 2017-11-17 11:59:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate No he shouldnt. Calm down.
931491277044101125 2017-11-17 11:56:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @NormOrnstein You could see his defective personality in his confirmation hearings. First nominee to openly resent being questioned since Robert Bork.
931490138768723969 2017-11-17 11:52:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @AP Thoughts and prayers.
931488549710508033 2017-11-17 11:45:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think about this every day. Every day.
931380719863189504 2017-11-16 04:37:22 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation @ANNELAMOTT @joanwalsh Breathe.
931380109910650880 2017-11-16 04:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol I hope an awful fate befalls trump.
931375375506173953 2017-11-16 04:16:08 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @bruntofitall @critic_social Yes. And Roger Stone . . . I think well be hearing more about this one.
931372822206779393 2017-11-16 04:05:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @bruntofitall @critic_social Thats really troubling. On the other hand Al apologized so he must feel he did something wrong.
931369196486905856 2017-11-16 03:51:35 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @bruntofitall @critic_social Really strange. Did Roger Stone announce that this was coming? If its true its not good, not okay. But something does seem off.
931366656307290122 2017-11-16 03:41:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @bruntofitall @critic_social I agree with you. Something is off here. And Im not saying this bc Franken is a dem. And who would stay asleep with a mans hands there??
931365759569285120 2017-11-16 03:37:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Yet another historic lowpoint brought to us by this imbecile.
931363162460426240 2017-11-16 03:27:36 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel The stien thing bummed me out. And the rest of it.
931361181696249857 2017-11-16 03:19:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump President of the United States of America. God help us.
931360759677882369 2017-11-16 03:18:03 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @bruntofitall Really? Thats strange.

931131835345711104 2017-11-16 12:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Yes they do. I hope they get charged by an elephant.
931005647134568451 2017-11-15 03:46:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @davidfrum The worst.

930996541917155328 2017-11-15 03:10:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats If I wear this will you consider sleeping with me again sometime?
930918873989373953 2017-11-15 22:02:09 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox Unsettling.  But right he is.
930918097225216000 2017-11-15 21:59:04 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost And who should we thank for giving it to him?
930917969236037632 2017-11-15 21:58:34 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol @TheDailyEdge Hes totally right. This should be everywhere.

930840609874698240 2017-11-15 16:51:10 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Thats too bad. Truly.
930837521570893824 2017-11-15 16:38:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @ASlavitt The 2nd A permits gun regulation. No other const amendment has ever been construed as unlimited. And Heller decision was a big mistake.
930828811683418112 2017-11-15 16:04:17 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory Dont watch FOX so have missed this little Eva Braun. She looks lovely.

930484131892482048 2017-11-14 17:14:39 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Look in the dictionary under cracker and theyve got his picture.
930448334556483584 2017-11-14 14:52:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Horrifying and true.
930444819893293057 2017-11-14 14:38:26 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social Hes probably pissed bc he hasnt gotten a nobel prize like that uppity guy from Kenya.
930431603544875008 2017-11-14 13:45:55 UTC <gaughran444> @votevets Heartbreaking. An historic lowpoint. Yet another historic lowpoint.
930278783298490368 2017-11-13 03:38:40 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @TheRickWilson Easier than throwing Bannon over the cliff. Giant fat guy.
930269104149291008 2017-11-13 03:00:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JRubinBlogger Res ipsa loquitur.
930267777918754816 2017-11-13 02:54:56 UTC <gaughran444> @KingJames Rode nyc subways for 15 years. So bitter that I missed this.
930263277292150785 2017-11-13 02:37:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Theyve damaged us. They have not destroyed us. Dont despair.
930251009867251712 2017-11-13 01:48:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyceWhiteVance Exactly right. Maybe Mallrat Moore instead?
930250831361961984 2017-11-13 01:47:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Haha! She did a great job.
930246895842267138 2017-11-13 01:31:57 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Yeah.
930246792196870144 2017-11-13 01:31:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @eclecticbrotha Who the hell gets flagged by a mall? Jesus.
930246088946266112 2017-11-13 01:28:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Oh ffs. I dont want my hard earned tax dollars wasted on this crap.
930239660823056386 2017-11-13 01:03:12 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Id rather be one of those ladies who smells arm pits for a deodorant company.
930229665373020161 2017-11-13 00:23:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman Seriously, he should end up in a prison cell with just enough room for him & his goddamned Commandments monument.
930181587412619265 2017-11-13 21:12:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Yes he should.
930181359674560513 2017-11-13 21:11:32 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Some days the contrast between these pictures, this man, and our current leadership is truly painful.
930058351303626752 2017-11-13 13:02:45 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Truly frightening.
930054157582692352 2017-11-13 12:46:05 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Whew! What a relief.
930053483478339586 2017-11-13 12:43:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Youre delusional and dangerous. Youre coming back to a democracy and its not going to go well for you. Cut a deal and resign.
929921055413751808 2017-11-12 03:57:11 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel @Tilt_A_Squirrel Theres Stevie!
929919435737063424 2017-11-12 03:50:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta I dont personally know anyone as dumb as he is. Not sure I ever have.
929916369889562624 2017-11-12 03:38:34 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Love Steph. Good man.
929908147371855872 2017-11-12 03:05:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Wasnt a civil war fought so that Alabama doesnt get to decide?
929902337010880512 2017-11-12 02:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH @EvaChanda Precisely.
929902144332984320 2017-11-12 02:42:02 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Insane position. But he doesnt seem to understand that children are severely victimized in creating child porn regardless of who views it.
929892679323914240 2017-11-12 02:04:25 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @kpmel Hahaha!
929892382979624961 2017-11-12 02:03:15 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel @stevesilberman People who want to scrutinize and censure other peoples sex lives inevitably have something to hide. Its not a normal thing to do.
929887416931852288 2017-11-12 01:43:31 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Its astonishing. Weve seen everything but colonoscopy films of the damn trump voters.
929706979421024256 2017-11-12 13:46:31 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You can arrange to resign for clemency and then play golf and be friends with all kinds of wonderful people.
929572991360471041 2017-11-11 04:54:06 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 She is a national hero.
929571589271818240 2017-11-11 04:48:32 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Inspired.
929562087994593280 2017-11-11 04:10:46 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt @justinhendrix You can simply retweet this every day.
929559550721748992 2017-11-11 04:00:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Hes never even argued a motion in federal court. What the hell.
929557471944945664 2017-11-11 03:52:26 UTC <gaughran444> @paleblueeyes24 @JoyAnnReid Less anger, fewer insults, less saber rattling, less treason, probably a lot cuter.
929490806171426816 2017-11-11 23:27:31 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Loved him. Love you. What a good morning.
929484967922618368 2017-11-11 23:04:20 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ @traceygaughran @drewfhinshaw Oh my god. Horrific.
929483929551286272 2017-11-11 23:00:12 UTC <gaughran444> @tombrokaw There is no such thing as GOP outrage anymore. Doesnt exist.
929443000916299776 2017-11-11 20:17:34 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Are they wearing the pajamas they woke up in together? Sweet.
929442839175540736 2017-11-11 20:16:55 UTC <gaughran444> @davidaxelrod They seem to be deciding theyre okay with it. Day after day.
929442539177902081 2017-11-11 20:15:44 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 She should sue the shit out of him. The most investigated man in America, as he calls himself. Let him try a deposition or two.
929441747729608704 2017-11-11 20:12:35 UTC <gaughran444> @vulture @jaketapper Uh, why is this such a theme? Ive seen guys do this in the subway, etc. but who the hell does this to people they know? Apparently many.
929441255993544705 2017-11-11 20:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel Cracked me up. Maybe nervous laughter. What an image!
929366252526632961 2017-11-11 15:12:36 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen We seem to have an endless supply.
929365986456809472 2017-11-11 15:11:32 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse No, thank YOU Bonespur Boy! Thank you!
929348352977883141 2017-11-11 14:01:28 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel Perfect. All he needs is the half black child that he ignores.
929186419595251713 2017-11-10 03:18:00 UTC <gaughran444> I wish law enforcement could take a look at Roy Moores computer. Would probably erase any doubt about his sexual preferences.
929172677675438081 2017-11-10 02:23:24 UTC <gaughran444> @ChrisMurphyCT Done. Thank you.
929159570538319872 2017-11-10 01:31:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Just awful. Awful.
929155723342295041 2017-11-10 01:16:01 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @FrankLangben Thats a very legitimate concern but there seem to be a lot of calls for older politicians to get out of the way. Thats discriminatory.
929155161343262720 2017-11-10 01:13:47 UTC <gaughran444> Why are we seeing so much of Steve Bannon now? Its like pulling open the shower curtain and finding the walls covered with toxic mold.
929153172156964864 2017-11-10 01:05:53 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins Noticed that. Repellant. Was a huge fan of his. No mas.
929126862340739072 2017-11-10 23:21:20 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Also why are people who are against discrimination just fine with age discrimination?
929070052019761152 2017-11-10 19:35:36 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This is insane. Put Roy Moore in jail and let this man get on with his life.
929069095160614913 2017-11-10 19:31:48 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @kaitlancollins Yeah. Noticed that. Blech.
929068816927199237 2017-11-10 19:30:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JerrySeinfeld Okay.  And thanks for not being a pervert.
929023902357114880 2017-11-10 16:32:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Kindness and dignity. Remember?
929023340752367617 2017-11-10 16:29:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare Exactly.
929023213518163968 2017-11-10 16:29:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MittRomney Go Mitt! Now start talking about trump! Come on!
928983016885669889 2017-11-10 13:49:45 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH @businessinsider Oh crap. Its everywhere.
928981865305923585 2017-11-10 13:45:10 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So look forward to the day when we dont have to see your tiny hands flutter around as you spew nonsense. Its coming.
928981526016090113 2017-11-10 13:43:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Susansworld24 @weztex @scargordon @YanchakSteven @DabAggin Its going around.
928972751154663424 2017-11-10 13:08:58 UTC <gaughran444> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily No. A coup would be firing Mueller.
928966879326154753 2017-11-10 12:45:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @rezaaslan @jonkarl Wheres a good tornado when you need one?
928965176535248897 2017-11-10 12:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @tedcruz @AUkeibro @fawfulfan This is the guy who cashiered his wife. Probably can.
928820854074552321 2017-11-09 03:05:22 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer This guy or the child molester? Tough call.
928815755382149120 2017-11-09 02:45:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @SophieInCT @JoyAnnReid Yes indeed. We cant count on those wonderful ordinary Americans.
928815158029414401 2017-11-09 02:42:44 UTC <gaughran444> @mic Fantastic. The perfect antidote to Moore, Louis CK, Trump, et al.
928807304320946176 2017-11-09 02:11:32 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta It will be hideous.
928804200401825792 2017-11-09 01:59:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No apparently they wont. Shocking.
928803385704411136 2017-11-09 01:55:58 UTC <gaughran444> @evepeyser On the subway, yes, but no friends or co-workers for crying out loud. Cant believe this.
928800941519835137 2017-11-09 01:46:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @JonahNRO As a former 14 year old girl this Whats the big deal? crap enrages me too.
928797640543932416 2017-11-09 01:33:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Dispiriting.
928788610681311232 2017-11-09 00:57:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @JRubinBlogger Yeah its not our favorite thing.
928788468972556288 2017-11-09 00:56:41 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @lizmeriwether @NYCoach1 Do it, girlfriend.
928788321131786241 2017-11-09 00:56:06 UTC <gaughran444> @WenWillRun @ddiamond @critic_social Cant get over it. Loved Louis CK. Chris Rock better not be next.
928786953717329920 2017-11-09 00:50:40 UTC <gaughran444> Roy Moore should be tried and if found guilty should be imprisoned, squeezed into a cell with his 10 Commandments monument.
928786198302257152 2017-11-09 00:47:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AaronBlake @washingtonpost Serves them right.
928784509687992321 2017-11-09 00:40:57 UTC <gaughran444> @WenWillRun @ddiamond @critic_social Im 58 and havent met this many perverts in my whole life! Sexual harassers yes, but these guys are total freaks!
928784108268015617 2017-11-09 00:39:22 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Thank you Bone Spur Boy! Youre the best!
928783910800166913 2017-11-09 00:38:34 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Ana you gotta ditch these creeps.
928721277044576257 2017-11-09 20:29:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Me too. And after the hell weve all been through, it should be broadcast in Times Square.
928708610556874753 2017-11-09 19:39:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @costareports Wait - what about the Big Tent?
928708241843982336 2017-11-09 19:37:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro If true this is an outrage. Abuse of Office, abuse of taxpayers.
928705214080798725 2017-11-09 19:25:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen Yeah, but what we got is pretty good.
928688786749448192 2017-11-09 18:20:35 UTC <gaughran444> @GStephanopoulos @BrennanCenter @emilybazelon @jpodhoretz @PreetBharara It is surprising to learn how funny you can be. Oddly enough you werent really a laugh riot at the SDNY.
928664372993458176 2017-11-09 16:43:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Thats your faux intelligent man way of saying fake news. The facts are against you. Stop lying for a change of pace.
928616305535737856 2017-11-09 13:32:34 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Trump has mixed feelings about rape.
928612347446484994 2017-11-09 13:16:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Love this! Haha!
928611924568363008 2017-11-09 13:15:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson If we all survive the trump presidency, due credit must go to you. The laughter has been like oxygen.
928607461858308097 2017-11-09 12:57:26 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @lynnv378 Seriously. What the hell?
928486137424949248 2017-11-08 04:55:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @rezaaslan He's top notch.
928478892486164480 2017-11-08 04:26:32 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta I always check for my wallet when he says "believe me!"
928433736890413056 2017-11-08 01:27:06 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @VaughnHillyard Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain! The great Oz has spoken!
928430721177440256 2017-11-08 01:15:07 UTC <gaughran444> America found its soul last night.  https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/11/8/16622884/women-minorities-lgbtq-candidates-made-history
928402153609232384 2017-11-08 23:21:36 UTC <gaughran444> Happy about last night? Celebrate by sending $5 tohttp://dougjonesforsenate.com
928400953304330242 2017-11-08 23:16:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Except for maybe that dossier business.
928389980401143811 2017-11-08 22:33:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan You lied about healthcare and youre lying about this. Americans are on to you.
928389094522150912 2017-11-08 22:29:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeConason @HelenKennedy Such dignity.
928388393679118336 2017-11-08 22:26:56 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich When will the Vatican be blessed with your presence?

928358234523566081 2017-11-08 20:27:05 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 That coffee boy really got around.
928351100511703040 2017-11-08 19:58:44 UTC <gaughran444> Its almost like theyre working for an enemy state .  .  .
928349528897486848 2017-11-08 19:52:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Damn!
928349294171738112 2017-11-08 19:51:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik So so sick of them.
928348593697755136 2017-11-08 19:48:47 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hear, hear.
928347688210522117 2017-11-08 19:45:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Had the same reaction. Then it passed.
928346907029704704 2017-11-08 19:42:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Is this your response to your nationwide rejection last night? What a primitive, debased man you are.
928318863644725248 2017-11-08 17:50:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MichelleObama @POTUS44 @BarackObama @1992AngelM @TinaMcGugan Good god. That sounds bad.
928317065005535232 2017-11-08 17:43:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MichelleObama @POTUS44 @BarackObama @TinaMcGugan @1992AngelM Best jury duty ever! Go Angel!
928314020175712261 2017-11-08 17:31:24 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC When did you become so pathetic?
928301143394013184 2017-11-08 16:40:14 UTC <gaughran444> @latinovictoryus Votes = power. Keep going.
928298838712111106 2017-11-08 16:31:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CaraMcClellan6 @NAACP_LDF This could not be more moving.
928298467830747142 2017-11-08 16:29:36 UTC <gaughran444> @atima_omara So who are the ordinary Americans?
928126170977243136 2017-11-07 05:04:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Well you better start praying hard after tonight white boy. Lets see if it works.
928121805780475904 2017-11-07 04:47:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Its astonishing. Astorino was an institution.
928117544904519680 2017-11-07 04:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Was tonight rigged too?
928116837862330368 2017-11-07 04:27:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @brianjameswalsh They said the same thing after 2012 but they cant control their bigotry. Bigotry controls the GOP.
928116106337902592 2017-11-07 04:24:57 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @ddiamond The people have spoken. Racists get out.
928111013559439360 2017-11-07 04:04:43 UTC <gaughran444> @WilDonnelly Class act.
928107244348215297 2017-11-07 03:49:45 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @DavidJollyFL @aravosis Will be fun watching rats swan-diving off that sinking ship.
928095534795063297 2017-11-07 03:03:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @kethera Ive done it.
928092368288538625 2017-11-07 02:50:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Duramadera Youre smart. Its grotesque.
928092100750725121 2017-11-07 02:49:34 UTC <gaughran444> @timkaine @KellyannePolls Girl, your boss was roundly rejected tonight. Why dont you just go to bed?
928090256829747200 2017-11-07 02:42:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Menacing lunatic.
928090011756621824 2017-11-07 02:41:16 UTC <gaughran444> Now crazy face is lecturing the South Koreans about the horrors of N Korea. Because what do they know?
928088798742941696 2017-11-07 02:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> Oh please. The horses ass in chief is free associating about Korean golfers playing at his club.
928082929414262785 2017-11-07 02:13:07 UTC <gaughran444> @benwikler God bless America.
928081648465383424 2017-11-07 02:08:02 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump He fully embraced your bigotry and got his head handed to him. Tonight is all about rejecting you. More to come . . .
928081252116303873 2017-11-07 02:06:28 UTC <gaughran444> @juliehdavis @JonLemire @SarahHuckabee @anamariecox @andyharnik Super happy not to be there.
928080821151510528 2017-11-07 02:04:45 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @AUkeibro It should be. Christie hosed that state.
928074269430558720 2017-11-07 01:38:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @politico Heres hoping.
928073801308532736 2017-11-07 01:36:51 UTC <gaughran444> @tonyschwartz I think trump was a major influence in this election!
928073331861082114 2017-11-07 01:34:59 UTC <gaughran444> @IronStache Go get him!
928071488514732032 2017-11-07 01:27:40 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Did you burst into tears and hug them? I would have.
928070380459315201 2017-11-07 01:23:16 UTC <gaughran444> Yes. The triumph of sanity.
928069842040745985 2017-11-07 01:21:07 UTC <gaughran444> @RalphNortham @MichaelSkolnik 
928063330631274496 2017-11-07 00:55:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Guess youre not superstitious. Sssshhhhh.
928062519247335424 2017-11-07 00:52:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Twitter Brevity is the soul of wit.
928059861971193856 2017-11-07 00:41:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF @GovernorVA So important. And remember that convicted felons can run for the US Congress! Surely they should be able to vote.
928016656147894277 2017-11-07 21:49:47 UTC <gaughran444> This is beyond disturbing.
928015716191698944 2017-11-07 21:46:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hell yeah. Who is it?
927967573404258304 2017-11-07 18:34:44 UTC <gaughran444> @srl Meanwhile convicted felons can run for Congress, e.g. Michael Grimm. Is that fair?
927959183386906625 2017-11-07 18:01:24 UTC <gaughran444> @samstein Ssssshhh. Dont disturb his imbecilic followers.
927918724098772992 2017-11-07 15:20:38 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Im a job creator and I think youre hopelessly full of shit. Plus youre on the take from the NRA.
927752424537903109 2017-11-06 04:19:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik 
927744609794523136 2017-11-06 03:48:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Done. Thank you. Dear god.
927733528997126144 2017-11-06 03:04:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @TheRickyDavila Police want gun control. Ask them.
927720982848077824 2017-11-06 02:14:53 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @MrErnestOwens She was wonderful.
927713236258041856 2017-11-06 01:44:06 UTC <gaughran444> @McFaul Paul Ryan is on the take from the NRA. Will never do a thing.

927706001217851392 2017-11-06 01:15:21 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Shameless hypocrites. Do your jobs and pass legislation that will protect innocent Americans from savage attacks.
927629160394215424 2017-11-06 20:10:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @WilDonnelly Nice Title VII case.
927627792677855237 2017-11-06 20:04:34 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw When it comes to gun control, we are.
927523742246457346 2017-11-06 13:11:07 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @JoyAnnReid Popovich/Kerr 2020.
927330485696688129 2017-11-05 00:23:11 UTC <gaughran444> We will never ever leave their side. But we wont do fuck-all to prevent the next one.
927323329299714048 2017-11-05 23:54:45 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Youre a legislator, not a priest. Pass some gun control laws.
927251100301963264 2017-11-05 19:07:44 UTC <gaughran444> @KeithOlbermann A felonious Noahs ark. Two by two.
927244018819444738 2017-11-05 18:39:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @renato_mariotti A long, treasonous conga line.

927243224913186817 2017-11-05 18:36:26 UTC <gaughran444> @PeteSouza Your photos have always been wonderful & are now a lifeline during these dark times. Much appreciated.
927016750918619138 2017-11-04 03:36:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Had that exact thought earlier today. Love her.
927014662016851968 2017-11-04 03:28:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @thehill Scary scary. The battle of the titans.
927013817678270466 2017-11-04 03:24:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @AdamParkhomenko Oh no.
927013346649526272 2017-11-04 03:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MohamedMOSalih I cant really watch this without tearing up. Maybe someday, but not right now.
927012125033357313 2017-11-04 03:18:08 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax There were white people who were enraged every day for 8 yrs that we had a black president. His success and dignity burned them.
927011243788992512 2017-11-04 03:14:38 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Who the f is she, the queen of the Democratic Party? Replace??
926949383110823936 2017-11-04 23:08:49 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller @kpmel Hes got warm father written all over him.
926825359601012736 2017-11-04 14:55:59 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan Everyone knows youre lying. Its a give-away for the rich.
926815006250946561 2017-11-04 14:14:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Mueller must be terrified.
926654893368250368 2017-11-03 03:38:37 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha Trashing Hillary means never having to say youre sorry.
926648033063985153 2017-11-03 03:11:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Decade after decade after decade.
926624458424668160 2017-11-03 01:37:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate My days are numbered. Not taking the time to read this.
926616525334810624 2017-11-03 01:06:09 UTC <gaughran444> @ninaturner @SenWarren @donnabrazile @JoyAnnReid @critic_social Id vote for Joy for just about anything in a heartbeat. Mad smart, good person, straight shooter.
926615532778016768 2017-11-03 01:02:13 UTC <gaughran444> @coton_luver @AUkeibro I did too but didnt like her swiping at Obama for selling his book.
926604834530263040 2017-11-03 00:19:42 UTC <gaughran444> @coton_luver @AUkeibro Same. Her opportunism got the best of her today.
926594920592347137 2017-11-03 23:40:19 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @NormOrnstein Which is particularly striking given the nyts propensity for endless navel-gazing.
926593955948572672 2017-11-03 23:36:29 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Thank you!!!
926567849224699905 2017-11-03 21:52:44 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak Tbh I did forget that. Ok she's out.
926548488095256577 2017-11-03 20:35:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB Although you lose your right to vote in a number of states w/ a felony conviction, no prob for running for Congress.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/nyregion/staten-island-congressman-grimm.amp.html
926543390929539072 2017-11-03 20:15:33 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Right. But her tweets can help republicans win next weeks elections.
926524618998976512 2017-11-03 19:00:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 100%. Always easy to trash a woman.
926523398683013121 2017-11-03 18:56:06 UTC <gaughran444> @donnabrazile Youve got to be kidding. Dont want to sow discord?
926507750850428929 2017-11-03 17:53:56 UTC <gaughran444> @KatyTurNBC @feministabulous The law views it that way.
926477476246802432 2017-11-03 15:53:38 UTC <gaughran444> According to her father, hes more of a grabber.
926468644489613312 2017-11-03 15:18:32 UTC <gaughran444> @donnabrazile Too late. His response was wholly foreseeable.
926467465474924544 2017-11-03 15:13:51 UTC <gaughran444> @GavinNewsom @tawni_rican The aclu is suing for her release. You can donate to them.
926421366089437184 2017-11-03 12:10:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @critic_social Right before an election. Its mind blowing. Done with Warren too. Back to the grown up table.
926420877754892288 2017-11-03 12:08:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 One mans rogue employee is another mans national hero.
926417809562882054 2017-11-03 11:56:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @critic_social So so sick of this BS. Always really liked Donna B but will have to rethink that.
926415082334097408 2017-11-03 11:45:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Go for it. Really.
926265260805427200 2017-11-02 01:50:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Under your bed. Boo!
926188573547786240 2017-11-02 20:45:38 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Yay!!!!!
926158528141656065 2017-11-02 18:46:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Ive found that fossil fuels poured down a mans pants at just the right moment are highly effective at stopping sexual assault. Easy!
925924833690619904 2017-11-01 03:17:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @MarkSZaidEsq He has very little to laugh about. And  even he knows it.
925924038911852544 2017-11-01 03:14:28 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @critic_social Kellys a stone cold racist and Ana should ditch her ruined political party.
925923579685933057 2017-11-01 03:12:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson That will do.
925919062865170433 2017-11-01 02:54:41 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Theyve been prominently displayed since 11/8/16.
925914413747535872 2017-11-01 02:36:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Yeah this is impressive. He seems kind of gleeful.
925906752289329152 2017-11-01 02:05:46 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Its always worth looking close-up at these pictures.
925866510987522049 2017-11-01 23:25:52 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC As you know, our judicial system has a sterling record of meting out swift justice to these guys. Give it a rest, Lindsey.
925858747871825921 2017-11-01 22:55:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ElSKuhn @SHAUNALUVSDDNT I do too.
925851808911839237 2017-11-01 22:27:27 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @kylegriffin1 Hope they get in a cage fight.
925848287634231297 2017-11-01 22:13:27 UTC <gaughran444> @WillMantell Great idea! The more the merrier!!
925844250620817410 2017-11-01 21:57:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ElSKuhn @sockknittergirl She is.
925837155141898240 2017-11-01 21:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ElSKuhn Of course.
925836505133789184 2017-11-01 21:26:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump A friend asked a NYC cop if she could spit on trump tower. He said sure, everyone else does. NYPD & NYC detest you.
925835520869044224 2017-11-01 21:22:44 UTC <gaughran444> @ezraklein Would probably have been much like the last eight years.
925832018730082305 2017-11-01 21:08:49 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff Can you mention this to Lindsey Graham? Hes all excited about military tribunals.
925829670079205377 2017-11-01 20:59:29 UTC <gaughran444> @greenfield64 @politico This rules out impeachment by republican congress which I agree with but does not address criminal prosecution. And then theres 2018.
925821781880995841 2017-11-01 20:28:08 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @critic_social Oh yes! The examples are everywhere. Trump, the marchers in Charlottesville, the confederacy. One more wonderful than the next.
925821415210864646 2017-11-01 20:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Seriously. That dreadful guy is solid gone.  Dont miss him but its a little creepy.
925821121651531776 2017-11-01 20:25:30 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes The Cuban people love Obama and loathe trump. Very much like the American people
925794915451375616 2017-11-01 18:41:22 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @critic_social Havent you heard? Were all just wonderful!
925784489896366081 2017-11-01 17:59:57 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Lets see how he feels about it after it brings him to his knees. Dont think  hell be laughing.
925772087419113473 2017-11-01 17:10:40 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter Absolutely horrifying.
925768740519727106 2017-11-01 16:57:22 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt @RiskyLiberal Very distressing. Hes impaired. Was never a very bright fellow but now hes genuinely impaired.
925767610574262277 2017-11-01 16:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @bitterflie We should just read what he attempts to say. Listening and watching is simply too excruciating.
925765888300679169 2017-11-01 16:46:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Angry Neanderthal cant stop hammering Obama. Beneath contempt.
925764771722530816 2017-11-01 16:41:36 UTC <gaughran444> @bitterflie I usually make a point of not listening to him. Its scary. Simpleton in a hugely challenging job.
925764511365201920 2017-11-01 16:40:34 UTC <gaughran444> This pathetic excuse for a man is taking shots at Obama in his ramblings. He struggles to form full, coherent sentences, but manages that.
925763387727982596 2017-11-01 16:36:06 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths Put him down for a nap.
925762767004622848 2017-11-01 16:33:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey He has no idea.
925762546434441216 2017-11-01 16:32:45 UTC <gaughran444> Watching trump hammer democrats in his xenophobic ramblings, ostensibly in response to nyc attack. Primitive, uninformed imbecile.
925756575855366144 2017-11-01 16:09:02 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @ChadPergram Graham wants attention and sees a wonderful opportunity.
925756264533184512 2017-11-01 16:07:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter How in the hell is this legal?
925755879617630209 2017-11-01 16:06:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @TinaMcGugan And when Bernie says ordinary Americans he means nice white people.
925752636862861315 2017-11-01 15:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @NewsHour @LindseyGrahamSC Are you missing the television cameras? You seem frantic to glom onto this tragedy.
925751540907937792 2017-11-01 15:49:01 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @realDonaldTrump NYC detests Donald Trump. Including NYPD.
925748306084552704 2017-11-01 15:36:10 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @emorwee Omg. Omg.
925747857487028225 2017-11-01 15:34:23 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Shouldnt he be busy with weight-training for prison?

925746176036622336 2017-11-01 15:27:42 UTC <gaughran444> @GavinNewsom Or donate to the aclu, which is suing to have her freed.
925744320875061248 2017-11-01 15:20:20 UTC <gaughran444> @marcthiessen @LindseyGrahamSC No, save those words for our purported president.
925741769815445505 2017-11-01 15:10:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That family is going to have one tense thanksgiving.
925740641908330496 2017-11-01 15:05:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood He sounds like a demagogue, not a president.
925740096112005121 2017-11-01 15:03:32 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel He's doing the right thing.
925702242384121856 2017-11-01 12:33:07 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr Shouldnt you pipe down and see if one of the sealed indictments is for you? Are you spouting nonsense bc youre scared? Sssshhhhhh.
925701281901174786 2017-11-01 12:29:18 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Terrible news.
925697614728843264 2017-11-01 12:14:44 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Good luck to his lawyers on getting paid. Fat, orange chance.

925696716682211328 2017-11-01 12:11:10 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Sad and utterly predictable.
925575206529355776 2017-10-31 04:08:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MercyForAnimals Love them & wont eat them. Sweet creatures.
925571838406791168 2017-10-31 03:54:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @jordansdiamonds Go Dad!
925555822356254720 2017-10-31 02:51:18 UTC <gaughran444> @vulture And his last name is dick. There you have it.
925555325935259649 2017-10-31 02:49:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 NYC has loathed trump for decades.
925554775416102913 2017-10-31 02:47:09 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel @PA How horrible.
925551370010349568 2017-10-31 02:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> NYC 10/31/17. Love our city.pic.twitter.com/5JZNzGN5iR
925549015034400768 2017-10-31 02:24:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnKelly @chelseahandler @critic_social Good. No decent person would be affiliated with trump.
925544854654017536 2017-10-31 02:07:43 UTC <gaughran444> Never understood the enthusiasm for this guy. What was it based upon?
925543210725920768 2017-10-31 02:01:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnKelly @chelseahandler @critic_social Didnt know that. Okay fuck this highly decorated racist.
925538521020026880 2017-10-31 01:42:33 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnKelly @chelseahandler @critic_social What did he do to our President? Already thoroughly dislike him. Theres more?
925537790758215680 2017-10-31 01:39:39 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sorry. Were all focused on watching law enforcement take you down. Its riveting.
925536765821292544 2017-10-31 01:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What are you doing about the mass casualties in Las Vegas? Not a thing.
925527171816460288 2017-10-31 00:57:27 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff @AUkeibro Watching Chris Hayes. Maybe Manaforts lawyer was kissing trumps ass, trying to get a pardon.
925491779826266117 2017-10-31 22:36:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Stop with the arcane geography lesson.
925490977971888129 2017-10-31 22:33:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC And they do. Thank you NYPD.
925490343457509378 2017-10-31 22:31:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump NYC detests you, including NYPD.
925474275708096515 2017-10-31 21:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff @AUkeibro Yeah. It made me wonder who was paying him.
925474090827370496 2017-10-31 21:26:32 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics He couldnt do his job before the indictments. Not likely to change now.
925435109284593664 2017-10-31 18:51:38 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR This isnt Rudy Giuliani?
925428681354416130 2017-10-31 18:26:05 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou To Sanders, ordinary Americans are white people. His people.
925422602386132992 2017-10-31 18:01:56 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @NavKaz @retrolash Is this a joke? Who thinks this dignified woman needs this kind of patronizing advice?
925421236762628096 2017-10-31 17:56:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF If only there had been an association to deem trump not qualified for the presidency.
925418949713461248 2017-10-31 17:47:25 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @RepAdamSchiff Seemed odd to me that the guy ran out to courthouse steps essentially declaiming trumps innocence.  Who does he represent?
925418266503340035 2017-10-31 17:44:42 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Hitlers base was pretty loyal too.
925365361398214656 2017-10-31 14:14:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram I think trump means chaos in German.
925364732558757890 2017-10-31 14:11:59 UTC <gaughran444> @EdKrassen Yes. In their view, that was when America was truly great.
925359452378882048 2017-10-31 13:51:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your lawyer can arrange for clemency in exchange for resignation. Just go.
925348735470768128 2017-10-31 13:08:25 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum He looks a bit unstable. Had sort of a merry affect last night. Odd.
925338735989919747 2017-10-31 12:28:41 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara He should put exhibit tags on each tweet.
925198294481100800 2017-10-30 03:10:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 No decent person would work for our purported president.
925198026276245504 2017-10-30 03:09:33 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @rolandsmartin Cant wait till Kellys history. And his goddamned boss.
925196040306913281 2017-10-30 03:01:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @franklinleonard As is the president. Grotesque.
925195947742842880 2017-10-30 03:01:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Where did all the reverence towards this guy come from? Never got it.
925195460872204289 2017-10-30 02:59:21 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Go ACLU! This poor little girl. Go get em!

925192172550451200 2017-10-30 02:46:17 UTC <gaughran444> @mkraju Someone should put a mirror under his nose. Make sure it mists up.
925191994401611776 2017-10-30 02:45:35 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos So the St. John Kelly thing is over, right?

925123370932494336 2017-10-30 22:12:54 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta Expected Working on the Chain Gang.
925122748728430592 2017-10-30 22:10:25 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer But Im afraid you wont.
925122237748916224 2017-10-30 22:08:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Thats what Jesus would do.
925059228594835457 2017-10-30 17:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro We were all way overdue for a good day. This is pretty fucking good.
925058056211353600 2017-10-30 17:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Ill get the marshmallows.
925043378710073349 2017-10-30 16:55:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Bros4America Great news!
925040884135219200 2017-10-30 16:45:07 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Yeah. There was none and we need to hear more about this. I suspect we will.
925040142766702592 2017-10-30 16:42:11 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Sure is. Good day for decency!
925038975588487168 2017-10-30 16:37:32 UTC <gaughran444> @pbump They should invite Mother. Just to lighten the mood.
925038494933835777 2017-10-30 16:35:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated They wont even let him color his hair in prison. That could be the last straw.
925032485435727873 2017-10-30 16:11:45 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom What a patriot!
924982564917530624 2017-10-30 12:53:23 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Hilarious.
924838184458096640 2017-10-29 03:19:40 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost This is like the Middle Ages. Wtf is going on?
924836793266200576 2017-10-29 03:14:08 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Dont they know we have an indictment to follow in the morning?
924829050601918466 2017-10-29 02:43:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @AngryBlackLady @JoyAnnReid is a national treasure.

924614873165844480 2017-10-29 12:32:18 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU @DMRDynamics @tribelaw This would seem like an easy one.
924614749874253825 2017-10-29 12:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Im lying in bed with my dog and I confirm that President Trump is under investigation.
924614304455954432 2017-10-29 12:30:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This little man made a good choice.
924486844296855552 2017-10-28 04:03:34 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath @brianefallon Remember that. Ignominious ending to her political career.
924485647125110784 2017-10-28 03:58:49 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @renato_mariotti Shes depraved. Or tipsy. Or both.
924485418749452288 2017-10-28 03:57:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Claude thought of you when I heard news of first indictment. Onward!
924467529455669249 2017-10-28 02:46:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TheJusticeDept @deg2 @tedlieu Think the republicans back in Nixons day were more patriotic, more willing to put country first than todays invertebrates. Hope Im wrong.
924462800059207681 2017-10-28 02:28:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MarkSZaidEsq @funder How can they tell?
924460478692319232 2017-10-28 02:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Wouldnt bet on it. Who are the courageous ones? How many are there?
924460138680987648 2017-10-28 02:17:27 UTC <gaughran444> @SRuhle Dont forget that this human scum settled his Trump University case for $25 million.
924395379013181444 2017-10-28 22:00:07 UTC <gaughran444> @RepTerriSewell Go Doug Jones!!!

924394149864001536 2017-10-28 21:55:14 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Oh that would be a truly beautiful thing.
924393285975773184 2017-10-28 21:51:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger They certainly should. Where are the patriots?
924284723316383745 2017-10-28 14:40:25 UTC <gaughran444> @Morning_Joe @neeratanden @kylegriffin1 I pray this is so. If the Lunatic in Chief  fires Mueller well see if there are any patriots left in the Republican Congress.
924284118665396224 2017-10-28 14:38:00 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @iJesseWilliams Thats right. The only policy change was enhanced sentences for crack.
924237485001101312 2017-10-28 11:32:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kpmel Worry not. Hes super busy.
924115810880237568 2017-10-27 03:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 In a normal time this would be big news.
924108847639273472 2017-10-27 03:01:33 UTC <gaughran444> @jaredkushner @critic_social Noooooooooo.
924102449245417472 2017-10-27 02:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC He cannot fully acknowledge and respond accordingly because he was involved.

924088122513686528 2017-10-27 01:39:11 UTC <gaughran444> @rezaaslan Serious buzz kill, dude.
924085927907090432 2017-10-27 01:30:28 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @joshtpm @seanhannity When you become a legitimate journalist.
924085444345778176 2017-10-27 01:28:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Please stay on this. A grotesque low point in American history.
923979904840060929 2017-10-27 18:29:10 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @brianklaas It was perfect. And he should stiffen his spine and say it again. Now.
923909307565002753 2017-10-27 13:48:38 UTC <gaughran444> @waltshaub @AndyKroll Oh damn. 80s cover band. Thats low.
923771823355023360 2017-10-26 04:42:20 UTC <gaughran444> @brianefallon @SusaMorgan Call your senators and tell them to vote no on these lousy nominees.
923771215336165376 2017-10-26 04:39:55 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @JenKirkman Not Obama? Damn!
923770924377214982 2017-10-26 04:38:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Keep giving! This child has been through so much and her medical expenses will be high. Show what America is really about!
923661264450215942 2017-10-26 21:23:00 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll Absolutely. Who the hell does he think he is? Thuggish behavior.
923660858449907712 2017-10-26 21:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @SophieInCT @EdKrassen Definitely. Shes going to go down as Joan of Arc without the hallucinations and killing people.
923660616728043520 2017-10-26 21:20:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @RawStory How disgraceful. Because she had the nerve to tell the truth while black.
923660276574146560 2017-10-26 21:19:05 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Many of us have had that thought.

923626185699004417 2017-10-26 19:03:37 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahThyre You have to practice saying it that way at Ivy League schools until you get it right.
923625905506971648 2017-10-26 19:02:30 UTC <gaughran444> @politico This nasty little cracker doesnt understand our federal court system. He doesnt run the show.

923612525509447680 2017-10-26 18:09:20 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse He looks like hes dipping into something. Weird color, sweaty, sniffing a lot, erratic behavior. Whats the deal?
923612069727014913 2017-10-26 18:07:31 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller As it should be. What the hell?

923602014587752448 2017-10-26 17:27:34 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Of course not. His balls are attached by Velcro. Easy on, easy off. Hed never have the nerve.
923601821989527552 2017-10-26 17:26:48 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Can we just pop all these lovely gentlemen in a halfway house somewhere?
923601284288086016 2017-10-26 17:24:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CJBMD @AUkeibro Dare to dream.
923600774785044480 2017-10-26 17:22:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @GOP @realDonaldTrump @JenGranholm Trickle down common sense.
923594869834121217 2017-10-26 16:59:11 UTC <gaughran444> Im incensed about Joe Girardi.
923528903200837633 2017-10-26 12:37:03 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper I love when republicans eat their young. Go to it!
923527903568105472 2017-10-26 12:33:05 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Any woman who has ever worked or left her house has always known how pervasive this is.
923513242428821504 2017-10-26 11:34:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics And zero courage. Zero.
923399035679100929 2017-10-25 04:01:00 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Trickle down reality.
923397857968828416 2017-10-25 03:56:19 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @BeschlossDC Tragic. Have you even walked through GCT without feeling the majesty of the place? Imagine what this was like.
923392227942035456 2017-10-25 03:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis What a hypocrite. How does he think his ancestors got here?
923391700051087365 2017-10-25 03:31:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @mtran03 Hell yes! And send him $5 too! Come on. Get this good man across the finish line.
923389801776246784 2017-10-25 03:24:19 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics @patckat Exactly. Would slam the breaks on that nonsense. Let them witch hunt on their own dime.
923387021716082689 2017-10-25 03:13:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Always sorry to hear from Eva Braun.
923385153682067456 2017-10-25 03:05:50 UTC <gaughran444> @peterbakernyt @PhilipRucker He sounds deeply xenophobic. His Irish ancestors probably came to the US when there were virtually no laws against it. Hypocrite.
923379141843484672 2017-10-25 02:41:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics They should spend their own money on this crap.
923378713923899392 2017-10-25 02:40:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Band of greedy brothers.
923361334191972352 2017-10-25 01:31:11 UTC <gaughran444> @HouseGOP @IvankaTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP This is who you speak to about working families? What a pathetic joke.
923355935904583680 2017-10-25 01:09:44 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaSpec @ColumbiaClimate @ColumbiaLaw Yes.
923354313098964992 2017-10-25 01:03:17 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Love her. The woman does not mince words. And shes right about waitressing.
923336996680060933 2017-10-25 23:54:29 UTC <gaughran444> @ladygaga @JoeBiden This is lovely & Im a big fan of yours but you should manage some kind words about Hillary Clinton, a woman of tremendous courage.
923334203500097538 2017-10-25 23:43:23 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Follow up question should be whether theyd like to be black instead. See, eg, Chris Rock.
923333835345088513 2017-10-25 23:41:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson What a kvetchy pain in the ass he is, among other things.
923321737671991296 2017-10-25 22:53:51 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC An architectural felony.
923301515305000960 2017-10-25 21:33:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Youre feeling generous today.
923301281199878144 2017-10-25 21:32:34 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ New York please do this. Please.
923301172407971840 2017-10-25 21:32:08 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOEurope @politico Poignant.
923298704290824192 2017-10-25 21:22:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Sure. Anyone who says he is very intelligent is not. And anyone who announces that he went to an Ivy League school is a dick.
923295145654489088 2017-10-25 21:08:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @SenFranken Troubling and rampant. Our children are watching and imitating.
923294747686445056 2017-10-25 21:06:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yes they should. Would quiet down a lot of the saber rattling. But would need to include rich kids this time.
923293905151344640 2017-10-25 21:03:15 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hahaha.
923289550054707201 2017-10-25 20:45:57 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Particularly terrible considering Sessions clamoring for severe drug penalties.
923289273025130498 2017-10-25 20:44:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Lawrence Never.
923289100580524032 2017-10-25 20:44:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Its probably pretty soothing until you have to do something.
923288545871220741 2017-10-25 20:41:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This dangerous imbecile. Id rather have a single cell organism for President. Less damage.
923252728960290816 2017-10-25 18:19:38 UTC <gaughran444> @NPRinskeep Hes a dangerous imbecile and no one gives a hoot where he went to school.
923236174872891393 2017-10-25 17:13:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Seriously. Skip the tax cut for the rich and stop wasting our hard-earned tax dollars on this endless nonsense.
923235807024091136 2017-10-25 17:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn @ACLU Jesus Christ. This is grotesque.
923153466662498304 2017-10-25 11:45:12 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Youre not serving the country and your defective father is destroying it.
923007454517923840 2017-10-24 02:05:00 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls How many abortions did your boss pay for?
923006699388022785 2017-10-24 02:02:00 UTC <gaughran444> @BerkowitzPeter @WSJ Hahaha!
923003741908946944 2017-10-24 01:50:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @libbyanelson Who is this delightful fellow?
922999026735128577 2017-10-24 01:31:31 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @mic I clerked for a federal judge who stopped taking drug cases bc of the barbaric sentencing guidelines, which created injustices like this.
922990804205006848 2017-10-24 00:58:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @kilmeade @LindseyGrahamSC What happened to you?
922988359005458432 2017-10-24 00:49:07 UTC <gaughran444> @BillOReilly @JoyAnnReid 85% of Puerto Rico has no power and this douchebag is mad at God.
922986752524111872 2017-10-24 00:42:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Im in.

922978541708472320 2017-10-24 00:10:07 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @MG4NoH8 Its quite clear.
922974499779293185 2017-10-24 23:54:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Glad youre here Claude. These are tough times. And yes we will prevail.
922968001451909120 2017-10-24 23:28:14 UTC <gaughran444> @christinawilkie Was that the trip where he embraced the glowing orb? That was an enormous accomplishment.
922967194945949699 2017-10-24 23:25:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I joined twitter for the express purpose of telling Paul Ryan to go fuck himself. Do it every chance I get.
922885317773938688 2017-10-24 17:59:40 UTC <gaughran444> @kashanacauley Oh ffs.
922848523724509184 2017-10-24 15:33:28 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @ANNELAMOTT @sandrajcooper Dont rape. It could cost you $32 million.
922812671342317568 2017-10-24 13:11:00 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Wheres the good old first testament vengeful God when you need him?
922811059806834689 2017-10-24 13:04:36 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Cool, clean water for the brain. And heart.
922810782995369984 2017-10-24 13:03:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Ask your attorneys to arrange clemency for resignation, you subliterate menace.
922810125651447808 2017-10-24 13:00:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Thank god he doesnt have a dog.
922777118257401856 2017-10-24 10:49:44 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @GlauconTheWiser Yes I thought it had. But this would make it nonexistent no?
922670611268276226 2017-10-23 03:46:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik @critic_social How awful. Between that and the Bastard in Chief, its hard to take. Their families must be so devastated.
922670149110587393 2017-10-23 03:44:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik Come on, people! Give to the fund for this brave young man. Youll be glad you did.
922668548513783808 2017-10-23 03:38:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik @critic_social Thank you my friend! These poor young guys. Heartbreaking.
922660514290860038 2017-10-23 03:06:23 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @MichaelSkolnik Done.
922659189142577152 2017-10-23 03:01:07 UTC <gaughran444> @rezaaslan And what heart & soul would that be?
922657877638172672 2017-10-23 02:55:54 UTC <gaughran444> @funder @ChrisBruner13 Send $5 to Doug Jones! Its tied and we can win this. Critical victory for Dems!
922657420203225088 2017-10-23 02:54:05 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes How does this not violate the commerce clause? Sure brighter folks than I have thought it through.
922656856035733504 2017-10-23 02:51:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sick of these fucking drama queens. We need more women in the White House.
922656135601164288 2017-10-23 02:48:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Glad youre here. Much needed laughs.
922655374574084097 2017-10-23 02:45:58 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Whoo hoo! Huge accomplishment! Go you!
922640760138354688 2017-10-23 01:47:53 UTC <gaughran444> Interesting watching the highly dignified Eric Holder excoriate the relentlessly sleazy trump.
922634403901313024 2017-10-23 01:22:38 UTC <gaughran444> @samstein Hope God gets mad at Bill. Could be entertaining.
922628311540535296 2017-10-23 00:58:25 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes I miss tokens.
922628171186495488 2017-10-23 00:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @samstein Lock her up.
922621996223094786 2017-10-23 00:33:20 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Yes he is. I frequently call him for fashion & grooming advice.
922621600058478592 2017-10-23 00:31:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Looks like an art installment by Christo. Groovy, but I dont want to pay for it.
922621084071071746 2017-10-23 00:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy She knows whereof she speaks.
922620994002530304 2017-10-23 00:29:21 UTC <gaughran444> @ladygaga @BarackObama Mr. President you sing beautifully. Weve heard you. Thanks for doing this benefit.
922562817156251649 2017-10-23 20:38:10 UTC <gaughran444> @markos @Russian_Starr As are a significant number of our troops. They deserve respect.
922454785835524096 2017-10-23 13:28:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC Yes, but there are grossly inappropriate things one can say. And our poor excuse for a president has said many of them.
922442334809284608 2017-10-23 12:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Lowlife.
922431429149065216 2017-10-23 11:56:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JustJOSH_ingYa Outstanding.
922429195225108480 2017-10-23 11:47:12 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Fantastic. Love their reaction.
922310021295362048 2017-10-22 03:53:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No time like the present.
922304341129814016 2017-10-22 03:31:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Pressure to join the Dems? From whom?
922303780259016704 2017-10-22 03:28:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @paulwaldman1 Enough already. Its not all that clear that they actually think.
922299778310041600 2017-10-22 03:12:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Can you begin to imagine what Churchill or FDR would have made of this dangerous dimwit?
922298705474215936 2017-10-22 03:08:41 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @NavKaz @FoxNews Love my President.
922297248427528193 2017-10-22 03:02:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @TeaPainUSA Hope it hurt like hell.
922296505276489728 2017-10-22 02:59:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 This is a serious bummer. Love this man but think hes slipped his gears.
922275214523883520 2017-10-22 01:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Im sorry but why is this a headline?
922274641292484608 2017-10-22 01:33:04 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos @goldengateblond Yes. Hope hes just getting started.
922274525777195008 2017-10-22 01:32:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @JoyAnnReid An assault on disabled children, among the most vulnerable people in the United States.
922272686159613952 2017-10-22 01:25:18 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Oh come on. You cannot be serious.
922272249419354112 2017-10-22 01:23:33 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids These pictures are a lifeline during these dark days.
922271150620794880 2017-10-22 01:19:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JamesMartinSJ The Grand Wizard in Chief.
922270719077224449 2017-10-22 01:17:29 UTC <gaughran444> @FoxNews @DavidCornDC @JaneGrader Sure they were. For years.
922244685640413184 2017-10-22 23:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @DavidCornDC This is an enormous settlement for one plaintiff. Must have been ghastly.
922244180776284160 2017-10-22 23:32:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Impolitics Perfect.
922243621423865858 2017-10-22 23:29:48 UTC <gaughran444> @LeslieProll They really should try. Maybe leave Obama out of the discussion so trump might listen.
922242601381695489 2017-10-22 23:25:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Go get him, Senator.
922202165397065728 2017-10-22 20:45:04 UTC <gaughran444> @NatashaBertrand @Politicsinsider @justinhendrix So stop playing golf with him and kissing his ass.
922200370788618241 2017-10-22 20:37:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Oh no.
922193178303885312 2017-10-22 20:09:21 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes!!!  Would be fantastic. Could happen!
922192935701176320 2017-10-22 20:08:24 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz No theyre not. And theyre not going to do brutal stoop labor either.
922192684554620929 2017-10-22 20:07:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Love Love Love.
922192340562923521 2017-10-22 20:06:02 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @joncoopertweets Donate to Doug Jones campaign. $5! Just do it!
922191671223255040 2017-10-22 20:03:22 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman No decent person would be associated with him.
922191511760056321 2017-10-22 20:02:44 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Love Jimmy Carter but hes simply wrong about this. The press made trumps presidency possible.
922099314377330688 2017-10-22 13:56:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You meant sinking in. Sinking through sounds like a full diaper that has started to leak. Like your brain.
922096152413171714 2017-10-22 13:43:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A bulging file.
921943441713573888 2017-10-21 03:37:00 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @RedTRaccoon Disgraceful. But the underlying laws are still in effect.
921942704883367936 2017-10-21 03:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen Good for you.
921942523727183872 2017-10-21 03:33:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, we get it. We had a wonderful president who was succeeded by a racist imbecile.
921933522599849985 2017-10-21 02:57:35 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn A shameless attack upon some of the most vulnerable Americans.

921931956039880704 2017-10-21 02:51:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Lock her up. Shell feel safer that way.
921931772899753984 2017-10-21 02:50:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Racist slug.
921931681329762305 2017-10-21 02:50:16 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer His brain is a lava lamp. Moving blobs of impulse, fear and anger. He understands nothing.
921931189048442880 2017-10-21 02:48:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No administration in modern history has so relentlessly degraded this great nation. Youre in a class by yourself, you primitive fool.
921779769175433222 2017-10-21 16:46:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith Yeah that was a bit of a jaw dropper. Wtf?
921775924361744386 2017-10-21 16:31:20 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @kpmel She had a heart - how shall I say? - too soon made glad.
921724222023655424 2017-10-21 13:05:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid How refreshing.
921708994921627648 2017-10-21 12:05:23 UTC <gaughran444> @RobGMacfarlane Congratulations!
921707636113969152 2017-10-21 11:59:59 UTC <gaughran444> @lasesana Lock her up.
921707571072946176 2017-10-21 11:59:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Send him $. Come on lets get this done people!
921707410204626945 2017-10-21 11:59:05 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @McFaul Hear, hear.
921707141064548352 2017-10-21 11:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Are these people created in a lab? God help us.
921706759902941184 2017-10-21 11:56:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @brianklaas Sounds divine.
921706245148565510 2017-10-21 11:54:27 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Censorious trout.
921704984089169920 2017-10-21 11:49:27 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden I found Kelly meandering, accusatory and bizarre. Women were sacred? And then there was the lying part.
921704400531410944 2017-10-21 11:47:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. We need a two party system, and now its one party and one assemblage of racists/nihilists/know-nothings. Big problem.
921600201005109248 2017-10-20 04:53:05 UTC <gaughran444> Cant wait for the movie.
921598838053490688 2017-10-20 04:47:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump If there is a heaven, it will be defined in part by your absence.
921597234902372352 2017-10-20 04:41:17 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @kpmel Thank you Kevin! You made my day.
921517268592414721 2017-10-20 23:23:32 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost This censorious trout.
921445846155169792 2017-10-20 18:39:44 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Step one: White House locates which nation London is in, explains slowly to trump.
921401036392321024 2017-10-20 15:41:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Thanks. I was 13 yrs old. Flew it high!
921400896046673921 2017-10-20 15:41:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Bravo!!
921362870339801089 2017-10-20 13:10:01 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He has friends?
921356076133634053 2017-10-20 12:43:01 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Is this related to the smoothie craze?
921355073254494208 2017-10-20 12:39:02 UTC <gaughran444> @YerMouse @RobGMacfarlane So glad youre here.
921354368716279808 2017-10-20 12:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @WangCecillia Thank god for the federal judiciary. Or, ok, thank Article III.

921351453431730176 2017-10-20 12:24:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Everything went to hell when nice white people realized Obamacare was for them too. Golly!
921351133922291713 2017-10-20 12:23:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Ha! Did you really? Good man. I gave Nixons motorcade the finger. Participatory democracy.
921349759901855744 2017-10-20 12:17:55 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Metal?
921217633080537088 2017-10-19 03:32:53 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Wow. Thats really really bad. Schmuck.
921214119612764161 2017-10-19 03:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Alternatively he could have given her a call and tried to sort things out in a respectful manner. Less dramatic but might have helped.
921211811592065024 2017-10-19 03:09:45 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids #MyPresident
921200471678824448 2017-10-19 02:24:42 UTC <gaughran444> @GenJohnKelly @MattMurph24 @LRuko Well, hes not very stupid and hes not a draft dodger. But the St Kelly thing has to be put aside now.
921200120816906241 2017-10-19 02:23:18 UTC <gaughran444> @donnabrazile Good. I hope Clinton & Carter speak up too.
921199755874664448 2017-10-19 02:21:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Glad someone is taking this guy on. Nothing sacred about Kelly. Hes trying to sanitize the disease that is trump.
921197967658405888 2017-10-19 02:14:45 UTC <gaughran444> @RepWilson @Lawrence @donnabrazile Glad someone is. Enough with this guy.
921191316993859586 2017-10-19 01:48:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila @critic_social He is horrible. Always looks to me like he just pulled his white hood off.
921189627024891904 2017-10-19 01:41:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 He acted like a henchman.
921189378738843648 2017-10-19 01:40:37 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @xychelsea I have police in my family. They dont want assault rifles, they want gun control. #NYPD
921187082604810240 2017-10-19 01:31:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila @critic_social Cant stand that little cracker. But like when his cheeks turn red as he lies. Thats fun.
921186650700513280 2017-10-19 01:29:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @TheRickyDavila Aint no mountain high enough, aint no valley low enough . . .
921186099564859393 2017-10-19 01:27:35 UTC <gaughran444> @RepWilson @politico Good for her.
921173041664552960 2017-10-19 00:35:42 UTC <gaughran444> @funder No thats his hair.
921171679740432384 2017-10-19 00:30:17 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @ninatypewriter Me too.
921168933662740480 2017-10-19 00:19:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @brhodes No kidding. And its a good thing she did.
921168786270707714 2017-10-19 00:18:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @Stonekettle Exactly. Good people dont work with or for trump.
921168585938161664 2017-10-19 00:18:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MatthewNussbaum @jdawsey1 @politico Not today he didnt. He acted as a henchman. It was terrible.
921166960175538177 2017-10-19 00:11:32 UTC <gaughran444> @ddale8 Thats right. Shame on him.
921166879196155904 2017-10-19 00:11:13 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Oh right. Dignity. I remember that.
921153691989741568 2017-10-19 23:18:49 UTC <gaughran444> @KaraCalavera Exactly right.
921153291060416512 2017-10-19 23:17:13 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ How disgraceful to defend that behavior.
921152155117129729 2017-10-19 23:12:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram And clearly unconstitutional. Not even close.
921151980424302593 2017-10-19 23:12:00 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Thanks Seth!
921151754124824576 2017-10-19 23:11:07 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @VABVOX Im with you. Decent people steer clear of that guy.
921148214518173696 2017-10-19 22:57:03 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Grossly inappropriate.
921147643832819712 2017-10-19 22:54:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik @chrislhayes Yes but we need republicans to speak out against trump/white supremacy. The ones in office are too spineless/racist to do it.
921146246705897472 2017-10-19 22:49:13 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennKesslerWP Additional context: trump is a notorious racist and a lying SOS. Why shouldnt someone listen in? As it turns out, good that she did.
921145537562382336 2017-10-19 22:46:24 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @RobsonConLaw Ya think?
921144447496282112 2017-10-19 22:42:04 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare Its not bad enough to have insulted this poor family now trump/Kelly are going to fight with them? This is disgusting.
921141574708400129 2017-10-19 22:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow No good people work for trump & Kelly is no damned good.
921141210428903425 2017-10-19 22:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Yeah thats an easy one. Wow.
921094807086346246 2017-10-19 19:24:49 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta Kelly, the great stabilizing force in the White House.
921087921935044608 2017-10-19 18:57:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Compare with concerns about this when Obama was president.  Next to nothing.
921087607815180294 2017-10-19 18:56:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yeah. Nonsensical. Even for him.
921087162866642944 2017-10-19 18:54:27 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey Too bad. If it was meaningful could put her boss behind the eight ball.
921086947468238853 2017-10-19 18:53:35 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Are they behaving like this in the morning? Theres not enough coffee in the world to make me do that.
921086529681936384 2017-10-19 18:51:56 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @Newsweek Couldnt that line her boss up for a treason charge?
921085575788101632 2017-10-19 18:48:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Even the chairs look crazy.
920989740811382785 2017-10-19 12:27:20 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Quick! Send that to Robert Mueller! This will change everything!
920986773282590720 2017-10-19 12:15:32 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Like breathing.
920978324314316800 2017-10-19 11:41:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson He hopes for republican judicial nominees but says nothing about the horrible nominees theyre coming up with. Like the Satans spawn guy.
920848514376183809 2017-10-18 03:06:09 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF She hammered the hell out of HRC.
920847363761229826 2017-10-18 03:01:34 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Why?
920839090563698688 2017-10-18 02:28:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Well all see them eventually.
920835623212277760 2017-10-18 02:14:55 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Is this the yelling guy with the cowboy hat? If he says so.
920834882322026496 2017-10-18 02:11:58 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie Think he helped get trump elected. Dont want him to do it again. He should just chill in Vermont.
920832778626830341 2017-10-18 02:03:37 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @tedcruz @CNNPolitics @TheLeadCNN Why are these guys getting airtime?
920829828181479424 2017-10-18 01:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Always ready with a statement of the obvious.
920826282946060288 2017-10-18 01:37:48 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw His brain is Swiss cheese. Many many gaping holes.
920825859493318657 2017-10-18 01:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @jmartNYT @alexburnsNYT How about more black candidates?
920825528499736576 2017-10-18 01:34:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Gutsy position.
920824423137062917 2017-10-18 01:30:25 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris Another malignancy.
920824276428697600 2017-10-18 01:29:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @chrislhayes Rat bastard has to be shaken by the ankles to do the right thing, doesnt he?
920823913843707904 2017-10-18 01:28:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Honestly dont know why graham is sucking up so hard to trump. Dont get it.
920823506614484994 2017-10-18 01:26:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila I want to see the children walking into their renamed school. Tear up thinking about it.
920823108394725376 2017-10-18 01:25:11 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @ClintSmithIII We see.
920821491662454785 2017-10-18 01:18:46 UTC <gaughran444> Sickened by trumps mistreatment of this mans widow? Give to this fund. Legit and the right thing to do.https://www.gofundme.com/sgt-la-david-johnson-scholarship
920820673450213376 2017-10-18 01:15:31 UTC <gaughran444> @votevets Orange scum. Beneath contempt.
920808956997464064 2017-10-18 00:28:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hes just disgusting. Still sucking up to trump whos threatening his dying supposed good friend.
920775625102843904 2017-10-18 22:16:30 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @votevets Orange scum.

920736522235625472 2017-10-18 19:41:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Lying little cracker.
920735939214888960 2017-10-18 19:38:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Now youre talking!
920735790526795776 2017-10-18 19:38:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSkolnik And counting. Keep going.
920735294583918592 2017-10-18 19:36:15 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Graham is a bad egg. Time to ditch the myth that hes one of the good ones.
920734903473500160 2017-10-18 19:34:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Maybe hes dumb as a post and doing a ton of blow. I think hes dementing, too, but who knows? That tiny brain is somehow shriveling.
920734427159908354 2017-10-18 19:32:48 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Sssshhhhhh.
920733526856814592 2017-10-18 19:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Claire McCaskill looks like shes about to blow chow. Understandably.
920637642332622850 2017-10-18 13:08:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate He meant Ive been pressured into calling this black woman and Im mad. I couldnt care less about her loss.
920637196109000704 2017-10-18 13:06:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AP_Politics Of course he did. Our President.
920636668402655232 2017-10-18 13:04:21 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Hope were protecting this guy.
920625505233141760 2017-10-18 12:19:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Done.
920472835465859072 2017-10-17 02:13:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Not sure shes out of that one. Congenital condition in that family.
920472274649665536 2017-10-17 02:11:06 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @KimVanMunching Very good idea. I will do this too. We all should. Show her how real Americans feel about her son.
920471832460976129 2017-10-17 02:09:21 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Not in my lifetime. 58 years. Not a soul.
920471171954593792 2017-10-17 02:06:43 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Never send a ghoul to do a sensitive human beings job.
920459487953244160 2017-10-17 01:20:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Subhuman pos.
920459315101782018 2017-10-17 01:19:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram He is garbage.
920445883031937024 2017-10-17 00:26:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Were particularly entitled to do so since he coughed up that ludicrous drs letter extolling him as the healthiest president in history.
920443123926556672 2017-10-17 00:15:16 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH Its like those sleeping with your dog will kill you articles. Bow wow wow.

920107509100269568 2017-10-16 02:01:39 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak Haha! Forgot about that. I loved his wise advice about identity politics.
920107190794498048 2017-10-16 02:00:23 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @ananavarro Ana your party is defined by its hostility to Latino immigrants. Make a break for it.
920096184030711813 2017-10-16 01:16:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Id forgotten Obama lifted camera ban on soldiers coffins. Didnt know he called families of soldiers who killed themselves. My president.
920095617392758784 2017-10-16 01:14:24 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel I sure hope so.
920092048853741569 2017-10-16 01:00:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Only a stone cold liar would take that job. Thats the whole job.
920078997366730752 2017-10-16 00:08:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @MissTrippy1 Popovich/Kerr 2020.
920036519821430785 2017-10-16 21:19:34 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Would hate to lift the hood on trumps brain. Sizzle, sizzle. Dial tone.
920035550240878592 2017-10-16 21:15:43 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor This is humor right? Never thought of what trump must smell like. So unpleasant. Melted cheese, Hai Karate & flop sweat.
920033213082406912 2017-10-16 21:06:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @pdacosta No can do. And coincidentally trump is not a real human being either.
920032885377290241 2017-10-16 21:05:07 UTC <gaughran444> @rosannecash And now these GOP bastards are going after womens access to birth control.
920031894703656960 2017-10-16 21:01:11 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Damn! Its on!
920029998005792768 2017-10-16 20:53:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @IrisRimon This is how our President conducted himself. Always.
920029420647272448 2017-10-16 20:51:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @MaryDram @LADFLEG Yes he would and he died six years ago.
920028771100643329 2017-10-16 20:48:46 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Whos the little lady with the grey hair?
920026519275212800 2017-10-16 20:39:50 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich You need to do standup. Hilarious!
920003407116726274 2017-10-16 19:07:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics The demented racist uncle who no one wants to sit next to at thanksgiving is POTUS. Great. Just fucking great.
920002573062598656 2017-10-16 19:04:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No shame, no brain.  Ugly to watch.
920002403486830592 2017-10-16 19:04:00 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Maybe he can just tweet at them. That would be nice.
919963773120729088 2017-10-16 16:30:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood What a noble and inspiring leader.
919760384344707072 2017-10-15 03:02:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated His use of language was fluent and somewhat sophisticated. None of that weird, needle stuck in the groove repetition. Totally different.
919701766521999361 2017-10-15 23:09:23 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @danpfeiffer Is he trying to figure out which female supreme court justice will die next? His charms are unending.
919662750481174533 2017-10-15 20:34:20 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews Vomitous fellow.
919659355934470146 2017-10-15 20:20:51 UTC <gaughran444> @SykesCharlie Why does the GOP hate America?
919656491254239232 2017-10-15 20:09:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila The whole country will need a nice long shower when this is over.
919656096767324162 2017-10-15 20:07:54 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @thinkprogress How about using the $$ from all the goddamned golf carts we've paid for since his dreadful father took office?
919555202029678592 2017-10-15 13:26:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein This is critically important. Call your senators now.
919551169084710913 2017-10-15 13:10:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Right decision. Hope the district gets  slammed with punitive damages.
919431256202506241 2017-10-14 05:14:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Censorship and illiteracy make me acutely uncomfortable.
919315942735319041 2017-10-14 21:36:15 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF What a heritage. Saw the movie last night. Terrific.
919305866469355521 2017-10-14 20:56:13 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor @mgtex @TheDudeFromAF1 @IsItCotton @EricaCsapo @Spankybutt So I'll hold off on painful. Sssshhhhh.
919259087354957824 2017-10-14 17:50:20 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Yes we're hurtling towards the sun.
919258897092874245 2017-10-14 17:49:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @armandodkos Egomaniacal fool.
919243622792486912 2017-10-14 16:48:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BradSherman @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu You deserve it. Thanks for everything.
919242032266338304 2017-10-14 16:42:33 UTC <gaughran444> @votevets Yes. As they will when trump is just an ugly memory.
919240213880336384 2017-10-14 16:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @SenMarkey @tedlieu @will_c_fischer @BJHare @votevets This is what responsible people are thinking about.
919239248573845506 2017-10-14 16:31:30 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Someone needs to explain to him that there are white people there.
919231952108040192 2017-10-14 16:02:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog This morally decayed, imbecilic Salieri stalking the ever superior Mozart. Savaging our country in the process. And the GOP does nothing.
919225494515671040 2017-10-14 15:36:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That's it. Exactly. And here we are.
919225080319750144 2017-10-14 15:35:12 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor @mgtex Was just saying the same thing. One last golf swing and ka-blooey. Would save the country a lot of time and pain.
919224583282151424 2017-10-14 15:33:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thank god. He's like Stalin on qualuudes.
919085842995601410 2017-10-13 06:21:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're a broken mess. Get out of the White House now.
919085378962944002 2017-10-13 06:20:04 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse In America no one tells us who, or what, or if we should worship. Get out of the people's house you fraud.
919081739909296129 2017-10-13 06:05:37 UTC <gaughran444> @politico If I only had a brain . . .
919081330746552320 2017-10-13 06:03:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're a nightmare and America can't wake up.
919080977032413185 2017-10-13 06:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Hahaha. Two orange buffoons.
919080370896809984 2017-10-13 06:00:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're a disease.
919080082479730688 2017-10-13 05:59:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA That's a lot of scratch.
919079595290316800 2017-10-13 05:57:05 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce No.
919079476121698304 2017-10-13 05:56:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're a blight. Can't wait till you're driven from the White House.
918680003713339392 2017-10-12 03:29:15 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Hope so.
918673571299450880 2017-10-12 03:03:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM @HillaryWarnedUs Bernie's a deal breaker. Bye #WomensMarch.
918673252972662785 2017-10-12 03:02:26 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix @nadabakos Time to go bro.
918672763895853056 2017-10-12 03:00:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid We did.
918671753303547904 2017-10-12 02:56:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Young E-Z Pass
918670750533476353 2017-10-12 02:52:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Don't get it. Just don't.
918604855224266752 2017-10-12 22:30:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro They should change the name of this thing. The Women Who Love Self-Absorbed Blowhards March, perhaps.
918507240017063938 2017-10-12 16:02:45 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Can't wait till this menace to society gets hauled out.
918457041559093249 2017-10-12 12:43:17 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @womensmarch Count me & many women out.
918452197297451008 2017-10-12 12:24:02 UTC <gaughran444> @arelisrhdz @RoigFranzia @PhilipRucker This matters more than parsing the latest response to the Weinstein scandal. People are dying.
918451830425833472 2017-10-12 12:22:35 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @SarahLerner This matters a lot more than people realize. Absolutely critical issue.
918451076059271168 2017-10-12 12:19:35 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior Absolutely. A faux issue when urgent ones are all around us.
918450195549081600 2017-10-12 12:16:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Good. They should all ditch his racist ass.
918450023268077568 2017-10-12 12:15:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Find a coloring book about the Bill of Rights. Ask someone to put glitter on the 1st Amendment page to hold your attention. Fun!
918447445918527488 2017-10-12 12:05:09 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @JPemberton15 Exactly. Or the soldiers in Niger. Or a decent response to PR and USVI?
918446923694166017 2017-10-12 12:03:05 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Stop with the Weinstein rage meter. He's abhorrent but is being dealt with. The country is on fire and PR/USVI need food & water.
918446083264712704 2017-10-12 11:59:44 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Yes it matters quite a bit. Very tough job.
918445678283587584 2017-10-12 11:58:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Crystal clear.
918445356886749184 2017-10-12 11:56:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @IrisL49 25th Amendment or elephant tranquilizer. Just something.
918310797398421505 2017-10-11 03:02:10 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Details, details.
918305950301347842 2017-10-11 02:42:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NickMerrill @joanwalsh Wait - no hair shirt? Come on, fair is fair.
918304309061799936 2017-10-11 02:36:23 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden More every day. It's painful.
918293006524051457 2017-10-11 01:51:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Like him a lot.
918292239792721925 2017-10-11 01:48:25 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce What??????
918287320301916162 2017-10-11 01:28:52 UTC <gaughran444> @LeonHWolf And then trump wouldn't have been elected. Mmmm.
918286566333865986 2017-10-11 01:25:53 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Wait - isn't this identity politics?
918281216226447361 2017-10-11 01:04:37 UTC <gaughran444> @SecondLady @VP Did you throw paper towels at them? They love that.
918266103155093504 2017-10-11 00:04:34 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta Tyrannical imbecile. Can someone make a coloring book about the Bill of Rights for him? Maybe some glitter on the first amendment page.
918264663737032705 2017-10-11 23:58:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Which commandment does that follow?
918264528672083968 2017-10-11 23:58:18 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse So glad the sound's off. Still see the crazy face.
918264337873162240 2017-10-11 23:57:33 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids This man. Sigh.
918238607063863296 2017-10-11 22:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Republicans dogged by insane, super-pervy president.
918238254478057473 2017-10-11 22:13:54 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Oh ffs. Probably just that guy and a ouija board.
918195093848363008 2017-10-11 19:22:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SeanMcElwee Good idea.
918109915067179008 2017-10-11 13:43:56 UTC <gaughran444> @benwikler This is a critical issue.
918109597692547073 2017-10-11 13:42:40 UTC <gaughran444> @vulture What an unpleasant thought.
918108279313784833 2017-10-11 13:37:26 UTC <gaughran444> @benwikler Disaster.
918107967819526144 2017-10-11 13:36:11 UTC <gaughran444> @kilmeade @LindseyGrahamSC You're a disgrace. Sucking up to a president who you know is dangerous to our country. Where is your patriotism?
918103707065241600 2017-10-11 13:19:15 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan @mr_maximus357 Ah yes. The makers helping the takers. I forgot.
918101919062724608 2017-10-11 13:12:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JesseRodriguez Who will stop this madman? Congress? Anyone home?
918101683661623296 2017-10-11 13:11:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko She had the advantage of having nothing to hide.
918101082009669632 2017-10-11 13:08:50 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber @OnThisDayNYT Little did we know those were the good old days.
918100878229467138 2017-10-11 13:08:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @TUSK81 Gestapo.

918099644592414723 2017-10-11 13:03:07 UTC <gaughran444> @shannonrwatts Thank you.
918098572524040192 2017-10-11 12:58:51 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan This is for the benefit of the rich and you know it. Everyone else gets crumbs.
918098178980839424 2017-10-11 12:57:17 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan You deserve to lose your job for all the lying you do. This "reform" benefits the rich and you know it.
918094889367363584 2017-10-11 12:44:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ChocaholicBrit At work!!!!
917955052471537664 2017-10-10 03:28:33 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @Adolfhib Love this kid. 9 months well spent.
917951785473576960 2017-10-10 03:15:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 She's appalling.
917949050254757888 2017-10-10 03:04:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics No hurry.
917942604322492416 2017-10-10 02:39:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @keithboykin NYC detests donald trump. Has for decades.
917942327234252800 2017-10-10 02:38:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yeah, and he won't know what to do bc it's a white guy.
917936549047783424 2017-10-10 02:15:02 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids @liberalgirl4 Oh yes. Hard to bear.
917929153407700993 2017-10-10 01:45:39 UTC <gaughran444> @ezraklein @MaryDram He's dumb, unfit, ugly & despised. But he's kind of tall, so he tries work that meaningless attribute for all it's worth.
917918318652162048 2017-10-10 01:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @dandrezner Cowards one and all.
917916262885453824 2017-10-10 00:54:25 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes It's hard to focus on anything with the maelstrom of misconduct around us but for crying out loud what is being done here?
917914954430369793 2017-10-10 00:49:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Could not miss him more.
917891753524518917 2017-10-10 23:17:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN Why all the satellite finger pointing? Ludicrous.
917890205088190464 2017-10-10 23:10:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta Mad angry or mad out of his mind?
917882671816167425 2017-10-10 22:40:57 UTC <gaughran444> @BrookingsInst @benjaminwittes @ejkohse @lawfareblog Sobering.
917864381886672897 2017-10-10 21:28:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JudiciaryDems @LeslieProll That's preposterous for a critical lifetime appointment.
917860901222535173 2017-10-10 21:14:26 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Pithy bullshit. You're trying to cut taxes for the rich & everyone knows it.
917845752780611584 2017-10-10 20:14:14 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Indeed. A bargain at any price.
917820091714211842 2017-10-10 18:32:16 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics No one can make me care about this faux issue.
917801081048051713 2017-10-10 17:16:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics No hurry, grandma starver.
917800785244803072 2017-10-10 17:15:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Sounds like an efficient solution. Like it.
917797739852910593 2017-10-10 17:03:27 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Yes. He probably has no understanding of why this violates the 1st amendment, but perhaps someone could explain it to him. Slowly.
917797010408910848 2017-10-10 17:00:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Yes, yes, yes. God in heaven, yes.
917796372451069952 2017-10-10 16:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @RVAwonk Beyond troubling. Need more info on this.
917771786787479552 2017-10-10 15:20:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Nobody does it better.
917771724397170689 2017-10-10 15:20:05 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Apparently not. See, e.g. the United States Congress.
917740449489653760 2017-10-10 13:15:48 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Actually you're dealing with mental illness and an encroaching criminal investigation. Ask your atty to arrange clemency for resignation.
917739785707573249 2017-10-10 13:13:10 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix Could be if we had a functional Congress.
917739593377681408 2017-10-10 13:12:24 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Cowards.
917738543648305153 2017-10-10 13:08:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia @nytimes Imbecile. First amendment violation. As explained by him.
917592864737112064 2017-10-09 03:29:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Kaepernick7 @CharlesPPierce Spoken like a true catholic.
917584611072462848 2017-10-09 02:56:33 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum A lot of white people choke on that word. They should get over it.
917584091788333056 2017-10-09 02:54:30 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum The goddamned kardashians are in the White House.
917583313434501122 2017-10-09 02:51:24 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @jbouie @JaneGrader Slim pickings.
917583160447307781 2017-10-09 02:50:47 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio @critic_social Amen! Rubio supports the anti-Christ. And who needs him to spew scripture? He's a senator not a priest. #1stAmendment
917582420584685568 2017-10-09 02:47:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 1/20/17.

917581532826689536 2017-10-09 02:44:19 UTC <gaughran444> @politico This guy should be filtered out of his job. Promptly.
917581423820894209 2017-10-09 02:43:53 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @jbouie For real? Oh great. Corker the national hero.
917577381514305536 2017-10-09 02:27:50 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics I call on her to get the f out of the White House.
917572555661332485 2017-10-09 02:08:39 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Their tackiness knows no bounds.
917572009932058624 2017-10-09 02:06:29 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Thank you.
917571206177525761 2017-10-09 02:03:17 UTC <gaughran444> @GOPLeader @POTUS @VP You remind me of Eddie Haskell.
917564902075764736 2017-10-09 01:38:14 UTC <gaughran444> @allahpundit @JaneGrader Really. What the hell is wrong with him?
917559480123928577 2017-10-09 01:16:42 UTC <gaughran444> @allahpundit History will judge Lindsey Graham very harshly. Guess he doesn't care.
917558482701656064 2017-10-09 01:12:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The world's most menacing tea kettle.
917534333690437633 2017-10-09 23:36:46 UTC <gaughran444> @ddiamond Susan Collins.
917502344329416704 2017-10-09 21:29:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You really think a whole year? I'm counting on him filling his Depends & running out of the WH when he sees his unfiled indictment.
917499738253033472 2017-10-09 21:19:18 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Lay off O, motherfucker. Not having it.
917499531469697025 2017-10-09 21:18:29 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 He's an aberrant little wretch.
917499173850767360 2017-10-09 21:17:04 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Can we stop pretending she's anything but a grifter along for the ride? Spare us the fawning nonsense.
917498680940298240 2017-10-09 21:15:06 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris The United States would be nothing without those who came here willingly and unwillingly.
917483024144568320 2017-10-09 20:12:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TIME I'm not sure I'd fight over that accomplishment.
917482410757025795 2017-10-09 20:10:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes, on one condition: the Cheneys stay put.
917464723087593473 2017-10-09 19:00:10 UTC <gaughran444> @womensart1 I think some of the drawings at rouffignac were done by women. Could be wrong but that's what I think. Either way deeply moving images.
917464140209418241 2017-10-09 18:57:51 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc I just saw cave art in sw France and would be willing to bet some of it was done by women.   Whoever did it, it's deeply moving.
917460710728323073 2017-10-09 18:44:13 UTC <gaughran444> @GMA The dignity and grace of this family knows no end.
917460375590916097 2017-10-09 18:42:53 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He is now, that's for sure. Keep talking, Bob.
917460102101262337 2017-10-09 18:41:48 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes Excruciating.
917459632561573888 2017-10-09 18:39:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Well, aren't you a brave soul.
917410296125370368 2017-10-09 15:23:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta As they should. They're awful.
917400896451039233 2017-10-09 14:46:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Unfortunately election nullification is not a thing. Maybe it should be but it's not. Old Orange will have to be scared off.
917362670566825989 2017-10-09 12:14:39 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw No decent person could. Or did.
917362265254518784 2017-10-09 12:13:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 I think trump is learning to exploit racism as well as the Russians did.
917360693497815040 2017-10-09 12:06:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @AmyGore3 Whether a sitting president can be indicted is disputed. Many think he can be. Either way they can show him what awaits him.
917356369019396097 2017-10-09 11:49:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Or indictment. And we will weep with joy and profound relief.
917235604466929664 2017-10-08 03:49:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GeorgeTakei Yeah. He's a ken doll with burning ambition.
917230712671145984 2017-10-08 03:30:17 UTC <gaughran444> @nickwiger @sdeezy_ America the night trump resigns.
917229387308765184 2017-10-08 03:25:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak Most of America would happily see them liberated tonight.
917227009247469569 2017-10-08 03:15:34 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner @ColMorrisDavis @AlderWode It was like a car accident on the highway. You know you shouldn't look, and yet . . .
917226712223633409 2017-10-08 03:14:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Oh please. At last let's see those spineless bastards stand up.
917222405927587840 2017-10-08 02:57:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You know he is.
917217123373649921 2017-10-08 02:36:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hard to bear.
917206466364293120 2017-10-08 01:53:57 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner @ColMorrisDavis Oh god. The horror . . .
917204671181201408 2017-10-08 01:46:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Um, right now we're worried about a sociopathic president blowing up the world. Will get back to you on this one.
917203979746074625 2017-10-08 01:44:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It boggles the mind doesn't it? That woman risked her life to save his bigoted ass. And we're all supposed to tiptoe around this.
917203626967302144 2017-10-08 01:42:40 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner @ColMorrisDavis I'm afraid to ask. One Nut?
917203505647058944 2017-10-08 01:42:11 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris Absolutely. And they're a great asset to our country. We crush them and hurt ourselves with this brutal, bigoted policy.
917203181708496896 2017-10-08 01:40:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TopherSpiro I want my money back. I want my country back.
917202835309256705 2017-10-08 01:39:31 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Has the sick bastard said a word about Charlottesville yet?
917202606631608321 2017-10-08 01:38:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveSchmidtSES Tell it, Steve.
917202312774512640 2017-10-08 01:37:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Where's the stirring footage of you throwing paper towels at people? Truly no one but you could have done that.
917197566483337216 2017-10-08 01:18:35 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Is this a parody? You're joking, right? Hilarious. Except for the part where you're president. God help us.
917102200027058176 2017-10-08 18:59:38 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Feeling regretful that I've lived to see the term "@SecondLady Karen."
917100644217032705 2017-10-08 18:53:27 UTC <gaughran444> @Olivianuzzi So not feeling it. Pence probably ran out bc he missed Mother.
917088254423388161 2017-10-08 18:04:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Oh great. A faux free speech suppressor. Just what the world needs.
917087690763505666 2017-10-08 18:01:58 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Didn't a lesbian rush to save his ass? Didn't he speak to anti-gay group?
917086820973862913 2017-10-08 17:58:31 UTC <gaughran444> @SecondLady @Colts @VP Puerto Rico needs water & electricity. Women need control of their bodies. Americans need healthcare. Climate change is real. Cut the crap.
917086047766482944 2017-10-08 17:55:27 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Oh. Not because there were women there you weren't with Mother?
917062669773017088 2017-10-08 16:22:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Only trump's base, aka the brain trust.
917010191245348865 2017-10-08 12:54:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Yes, and on the take from the NRA.
917002605032861697 2017-10-08 12:23:52 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Yes, especially coming from conservative McCarthy.
916997058594328576 2017-10-08 12:01:50 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Read it. Did this inspiring exchange take place in a men's bathroom?
916996585803874304 2017-10-08 11:59:57 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @GeorgeLatimer37 Astorino is a total wuss. Caves to gun lobby too. Go get him George!
916894722693746689 2017-10-07 05:15:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics No he's not. He's not even a little problem for Democrats.
916851807191695360 2017-10-07 02:24:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Love this. Love.
916851121045598208 2017-10-07 02:21:56 UTC <gaughran444> @kaitlancollins Someone take all sharp objects away from Kelly.
916850853868457986 2017-10-07 02:20:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Groundhog Day from hell.
916850705012609026 2017-10-07 02:20:16 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Deeply sick man who enjoys traumatizing his country. Beneath contempt.
916850567808471040 2017-10-07 02:19:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Excellent news. Thanks.
916850439949299713 2017-10-07 02:19:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. Once he gets a load of what he & his family are up against, he will bail.
916780239417757696 2017-10-07 21:40:16 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your attorney can get you clemency in exchange for a resignation. Can get your whole family off. You can say you're not well and walk away.
916655432038518784 2017-10-07 13:24:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @JakeSherman He will be missed.
916654015190093824 2017-10-07 13:18:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. The whole country has been traumatized. He's so sick he'll ratchet it up as he feels the law closing in on him.
916653376913465344 2017-10-07 13:16:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids These photos are a balm.
916651126820352001 2017-10-07 13:07:13 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio How much $ have you taken from the NRA. WWJD?
916519136825667584 2017-10-06 04:22:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CillizzaCNN This is too dumb.
916515550116896769 2017-10-06 04:08:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Here comes a TV movie from hell.
916511332412862464 2017-10-06 03:51:44 UTC <gaughran444> @KarasuMartinez This is a hateful time in the US led by a hateful man. But truly most of the country supports you. All the best to you.
916353856803688449 2017-10-06 17:25:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Except potable water if you're in Puerto Rico.
916339701954564096 2017-10-06 16:29:44 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths Don't worry. You'll get to sit down again in 5 years. He's too cute.

916334429399928832 2017-10-06 16:08:47 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy 1.  I almost cancelled my Nordstrom card before they got rid of her crappy shoes/purses.    2.  That's it.
916333753273905152 2017-10-06 16:06:06 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @PreetBharara As is the nation.

916332781906616320 2017-10-06 16:02:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Good writer. Pleasure to read.
916277085630541824 2017-10-06 12:20:55 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes This sounds like a sexual problem. Seriously.
916111086486683649 2017-10-05 01:21:18 UTC <gaughran444> @vulture Such contrition.
916110911152316416 2017-10-05 01:20:36 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH Love this.
916101751945572352 2017-10-05 00:44:12 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule @TinaMcGugan Thanks. May go back next year. Unless I can stop him. Maybe we'll have a stable president by then
916099834909687808 2017-10-05 00:36:35 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule My son is in Seoul. Comes home tomorrow. Frightening. Despise this reckless imbecile.
916098510646366209 2017-10-05 00:31:19 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social Or the NRA.
916097035740336129 2017-10-05 00:25:28 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Someone get an elephant tranquilizer. Stop him.
916096790511935488 2017-10-05 00:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Idiot.

916036654560923649 2017-10-05 20:25:32 UTC <gaughran444> @tedlieu There's a lot of them. They reproduce by fission.
915998533458780160 2017-10-05 17:54:03 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 What a bunch of schnorrers. Sick of these people.
915989082563416065 2017-10-05 17:16:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA That is so very, very fun.

915955331750072324 2017-10-05 15:02:23 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes All to the detriment of the Cuban people who are very poor and did nothing wrong. Awful.

915764385477427201 2017-10-04 02:23:38 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @ALT_uscis Opportunistic grief.
915762294176600064 2017-10-04 02:15:19 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @GeorgeLatimer37 Wow. What a wuss. Go George!
915761808857853953 2017-10-04 02:13:23 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 The Right to Lifer who urged his gf to get an abortion? What a loss for America. Bye Tim.
915756739185782784 2017-10-04 01:53:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @cnnbrk Humans. I remember them.
915755802874580993 2017-10-04 01:49:31 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Well, you've spoken to him. But he seems dumb as a post to me. And deranged, with incipient dementia. A win-win for America.
915754640637079552 2017-10-04 01:44:54 UTC <gaughran444> @Impolitics Oh yes. We have detested him for decades.
915744368476262405 2017-10-04 01:04:05 UTC <gaughran444> @Impolitics I think everyone is just enjoying saying it over and over.
915737940793466880 2017-10-04 00:38:33 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Latest image: near miss felon. Very becoming.
915736844045824000 2017-10-04 00:34:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MilitaryEarth This poor boy. His poor mother. #EnoughIsEnough
915730857607954432 2017-10-04 00:10:24 UTC <gaughran444> @Taniel And for contrast, note that convicted felon Michael Grimm is seeking a return to his congressional seat in NY. That's legal.
915666332607303680 2017-10-04 19:54:00 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @xan_desanctis How about the Pain-Capable children losing CHIP coverage? Any interest in the post-utero child or not so much?
915665702241042434 2017-10-04 19:51:30 UTC <gaughran444> @RealJacobPerry Beautiful couple.
915662023609995264 2017-10-04 19:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Indisputable. Only breathtaking because the republicans who are not retiring are such cowards.
915660750231932928 2017-10-04 19:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ProPublica Outrageous. Thank you for your important work.
915657221949796352 2017-10-04 19:17:48 UTC <gaughran444> @buzzzbea @SenSanders @reesetheone1 Exactly.
915656950041395200 2017-10-04 19:16:43 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Strange to hear this from you given your history on this issue. Maybe you sit this one out.
915640596953550849 2017-10-04 18:11:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Haven't they been through enough?
915640485196320769 2017-10-04 18:11:18 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein Thank you Senator. This is what we want from our legislators. Not thoughts and prayers, legislation.
915639902464823296 2017-10-04 18:08:59 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Apparently called him a fucking moron. Better still.
915639774282702856 2017-10-04 18:08:28 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @BetteMidler Love Roseanne Cash. What a good idea.
915639173314437121 2017-10-04 18:06:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @TrueFactsStated Seriously feeling Rex now.
915638763392524294 2017-10-04 18:04:27 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Go Rex! The voice of America.
915621410101440512 2017-10-04 16:55:30 UTC <gaughran444> @ChrisMurphyCT Yes yes yes. Thank you Senator. Glad you're here.
915621061219274758 2017-10-04 16:54:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Ow.
915620973197643778 2017-10-04 16:53:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SRuhle @KenDilanianNBC Go Rex.
915620737184145408 2017-10-04 16:52:49 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Wow. Knew about moron. He said fucking moron? Warming up to Rex big time.
915576143562051585 2017-10-04 13:55:37 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Yes. And no David Bowie, and no Prince, and no William Trevor. But the  dangerous imbecile keeps going.
915575476814516224 2017-10-04 13:52:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Would love to see more of her & love to see her replace Ms Santa is White.
915573507618205696 2017-10-04 13:45:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @MrDane1982 Oh yes. But she's too smart and candid for the morning yak yak bs. We need her real thoughts.
915573116826525696 2017-10-04 13:43:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hell no. He's a stone cold racist and comes through loud & clear. Can't picture him hurling paper towels at white people. Disgraceful man.
915567795848478721 2017-10-04 13:22:27 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Lovely but painful to watch given where we are now. We went from the best to the worst.
915566325182926854 2017-10-04 13:16:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @owillis They're just not into the post-utero kids. It's all about the fetus.
915549050191192069 2017-10-04 12:07:58 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @mikiebarb @kailanikm If he really called Trump a "moron" I will have to give him another chance.
915545143897403392 2017-10-04 11:52:26 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti Grifters gonna grift.
915543217482891265 2017-10-04 11:44:47 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio How much blood money have you taken from the NRA?
915449362498641920 2017-10-03 05:31:50 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman Let us pray.
915447920987648000 2017-10-03 05:26:07 UTC <gaughran444> @politico How much blood money has he taken from the NRA?
915438499519778816 2017-10-03 04:48:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JeffreyToobin @imillhiser I can see why. Gorsuch was incredibly arrogant during his confirmation hearing. Almost Bork-like. Highly unusual.
915278062765461504 2017-10-03 18:11:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @ChrisMurphyCT Good for you senator. Thank you.
915200965455892480 2017-10-03 13:04:48 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff Talk about legislation. Please.
915199483465670657 2017-10-03 12:58:55 UTC <gaughran444> @business @renato_mariotti Wow. This is fascinating.  And troubling. Thanks.
915195768444801030 2017-10-03 12:44:09 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @kwelkernbc @AJsDad4227 Slimming and cool.
915195522775961601 2017-10-03 12:43:10 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @kwelkernbc Translation: I've taken a pile of dough from the NRA and will never talk about this. Plus, I have secret service protection so what ev.
915195190280933376 2017-10-03 12:41:51 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @nytimes Can someone do a puppet show for this guy about the first amendment? He doesn't seem familiar with the premise.
915192223603535873 2017-10-03 12:30:04 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Do you take $ from the NRA?
915192033974931456 2017-10-03 12:29:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Hard to say what prompted that one. Maybe he just got oriented and realized what country he's in?
915190073775271936 2017-10-03 12:21:31 UTC <gaughran444> @chuckwoolery @TeaPainUSA He's still alive? Gotta give him props for that. But he should stop talking.
915189914588925952 2017-10-03 12:20:53 UTC <gaughran444> @GavinNewsom It's false sensitivity devised to dodge urgency, aka total bullshit.
915189365265059840 2017-10-03 12:18:42 UTC <gaughran444> @NRA @MattMurph24 @shannonrwatts They'll say anything. Shameless.
915043837562753025 2017-10-02 02:40:26 UTC <gaughran444> @KenRoth Of course. And no constitutional rights are unfettered.
915034836133306368 2017-10-02 02:04:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Merrillmarkoe Oh yes. Leadership test. He can't pass the basic human being test.
915028580156899328 2017-10-02 01:39:48 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @tribelaw I think she makes a good point & I think she would have made a good president.
915022389905444864 2017-10-02 01:15:12 UTC <gaughran444> @HowardKurtz No we can't. If masses of Americans were perishing in fires, would we not be talking about fire safety violations? Guns aren't sacrosanct.
915021022377725953 2017-10-02 01:09:46 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @brianefallon I do remember that. Thought it was a bunch of bs back then.
915002438163271680 2017-10-02 23:55:55 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @sahluwal Oh no.
915001762700038144 2017-10-02 23:53:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Wait till all the killing has stopped? In what world will that happen?
915000429699846144 2017-10-02 23:47:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid If 60 people died & hundreds more were injured in a fire, no one would hesitate to discuss fire safety violations. This is a manipulation.
914998669388206081 2017-10-02 23:40:57 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon No it will not. Maybe public shaming for pocketing NRA $ will be.
914997291857203201 2017-10-02 23:35:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Trouble from day one. Figured as much.
914997047484469249 2017-10-02 23:34:30 UTC <gaughran444> @ChrisMurphyCT @tribelaw I want the opportunity to vote for him. Good man.
914962336464719877 2017-10-02 21:16:34 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This feels very 15th century. Dear god.
914962164586336257 2017-10-02 21:15:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Vegas @MandalayBay @CarmenYulinCruz Carmen Cruz for president.
914962080557617152 2017-10-02 21:15:33 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn We need to memorize this.
914956823354060800 2017-10-02 20:54:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @mikebarnicle @kpmel Good question. They sure don't in my family but I know so many do.
914950875013091328 2017-10-02 20:31:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @mikebarnicle I have cops in my family. They don't want grenade launchers and military equipment. They want gun control.
914950477346983937 2017-10-02 20:29:27 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @Mikel_Jollett Dammit.
914950409302757377 2017-10-02 20:29:11 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Diabolical.
914946671452282881 2017-10-02 20:14:20 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox They can pray all they want of course.  But they're elected to legislate. They need to do their job.
914946193985359873 2017-10-02 20:12:26 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Absolutely nothing.
914945973012566016 2017-10-02 20:11:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Blood on his hands.
914945702521958400 2017-10-02 20:10:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @StillLes4Hill Liking this man more every day. Calm but tough as hell.
914929707623358464 2017-10-02 19:06:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Fuck him and his faux heartbreak. #GunControlNow
914929343100538880 2017-10-02 19:05:28 UTC <gaughran444> @SamanthaJPower What better time to discuss a remedy than right after a disaster? People should not be cowed by this false sensitivity. #GunControlNow
914927876406988800 2017-10-02 18:59:38 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton Thank you. Keep going.
914927781531791367 2017-10-02 18:59:16 UTC <gaughran444> @BillClinton Please say the words gun control.
914923410270105602 2017-10-02 18:41:54 UTC <gaughran444> The Heller decision is a mistake and a disaster.
914923150625918976 2017-10-02 18:40:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi Thank you.
914922920513867778 2017-10-02 18:39:57 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @BarackObama Love you but prayers aren't doing it. We need gun control. You tried as president. Keep saying it please.
914922604825317377 2017-10-02 18:38:42 UTC <gaughran444> @ChrisMurphyCT @SenSchumer @mayatcontreras Yes. Not interested in their feelings or prayers. Want legislation, i.e. what they were elected to do.
914892575080947739 2017-10-02 16:39:22 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Without legislation nothing means a thing.
914892414178951168 2017-10-02 16:38:44 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio He also wasn't afraid to push our sick country toward gun control.
914884070009696257 2017-10-02 16:05:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Keep your prayers to yourself. We need gun control.
914704418649595904 2017-10-01 04:11:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @3L3V3NTH The crazy/superdumb + racism thing is killing us.
914703820801937408 2017-10-01 04:09:19 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids This beloved man.
914703019962494976 2017-10-01 04:06:08 UTC <gaughran444> @juliansinger You too.
914698107170025473 2017-10-01 03:46:37 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro He'll have his own little circle down there. Nice and toasty.
914697408403116032 2017-10-01 03:43:51 UTC <gaughran444> @juliansinger Haha! I'm thrilled when I remember anything. Like where I parked my car!
914696981703995399 2017-10-01 03:42:09 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU @Amy_Siskind Yes not a close case.
914695373146509313 2017-10-01 03:35:45 UTC <gaughran444> @KELLYWEILL @juliansinger Right.
914674741935517697 2017-10-01 02:13:46 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @realpaolathomas @OfficialJLD Two class acts.
914672412616249346 2017-10-01 02:04:31 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou I'm not crying. You're crying.
914663199420686336 2017-10-01 01:27:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Olivianuzzi Wtf are divorce jeans?
914662477299937280 2017-10-01 01:25:02 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris Love her.
914662243375120384 2017-10-01 01:24:07 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT @kpmel But of course!pic.twitter.com/a95BsJtk1C
914659399481819137 2017-10-01 01:12:49 UTC <gaughran444> @KELLYWEILL How does this comply with the 6th amendment?
914659192992157696 2017-10-01 01:11:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram And the police (the GOP) are all headed to Dunkin' Donuts.
914652218137161729 2017-10-01 00:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT Let's not forget "We Didn't Start the Fire."
914651275836485632 2017-10-01 00:40:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Why is this repellant fellow talking so much? Isn't he supposed to confine himself to lies about the tax plan?
914650869530075137 2017-10-01 00:38:55 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Always. Like he's on a week long sound delay.
914650598439518209 2017-10-01 00:37:50 UTC <gaughran444> @samstein What heart?
914618093233688577 2017-10-01 22:28:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro And yet I'm shocked. How are they all so depraved?
914617917278482432 2017-10-01 22:27:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko I think this is why trump has gone full scale batshit crazy. He knows the jig is almost up and he's scared.
914612292846850050 2017-10-01 22:05:37 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Zero.
914609574770040834 2017-10-01 21:54:49 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen OJ was good at something once.
914609123471347713 2017-10-01 21:53:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MollyJongFast Very very close call.
914608728749625344 2017-10-01 21:51:28 UTC <gaughran444> @swingleft Critical. Everybody on your feet. We need to sweep these bastards out of office.
914607483724935168 2017-10-01 21:46:31 UTC <gaughran444> @WBALPete They're booing black people who are not doing what they're told.
914606616049278976 2017-10-01 21:43:04 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I'm not even comfortable watching this entitled con artist speak.
914604502266925056 2017-10-01 21:34:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Now you're talking. Go Joy.
914581191600300034 2017-10-01 20:02:02 UTC <gaughran444> @DrPhilGoff Love him. What an extraordinary person.
914581053200850944 2017-10-01 20:01:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I hope so but they can't even stop him from racist ranting.
914580672064491522 2017-10-01 19:59:58 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yeah, and trump is a cheap, crazy cracker. Sorry. He just is.
914513761507201024 2017-10-01 15:34:06 UTC <gaughran444> @AshaRangappa_ Happy birthday Mr. President. One of the best people to have held that office.
914512793868623873 2017-10-01 15:30:15 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Yes. They could remove him if they gave a damn about our country. Instead they try to take away healthcare and give tax breaks to the rich.
914486760004038657 2017-10-01 13:46:48 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SamanthaJPower You wouldn't want that job and you wouldn't do that job because you have integrity.
914486505313366022 2017-10-01 13:45:47 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy It's always POC. He thinks they're lazy and undeserving. Never hear this crap about the people in Texas or coal miners.
914457975019966465 2017-10-01 11:52:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @BJHare @SenWarren You're a US senator. You need to do more than criticize. Make concrete proposals.
914326419588739072 2017-09-30 03:09:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Remember "his" African American? Plantation mentality.
914325707777601536 2017-09-30 03:06:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 I think he knows it and is decompensating. Wigging the f out. He sounds unhinged even by his deranged standards.
914325364448559105 2017-09-30 03:05:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Can't believe Silver did this. We know where this is headed. Fool.
914325105861201920 2017-09-30 03:04:27 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Carmen Cruz for President.
914324459636617216 2017-09-30 03:01:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Really? This guy is a widespread disease.

914241871018446848 2017-09-30 21:33:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Civics4GrownUps What a bizarre admixture. Maybe we can make amends for our current catastrophic failure to respond by granting statehood.
914240948422488064 2017-09-30 21:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Civics4GrownUps Thank you. I needed this.
914239983434846209 2017-09-30 21:26:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta Because trump is a stone cold racist. #UnfitToServe

914239247887953920 2017-09-30 21:23:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Perhaps we'll find out what the hell is wrong with this guy some day. Like with Aaron Hernandez.
914238126637412352 2017-09-30 21:18:49 UTC <gaughran444> @mobinc1234 I hope so. They'll have to mix up that crummy gene pool.
914231518121381888 2017-09-30 20:52:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Trump's base doesn't like people of color any more than he does. A non-racist could not tolerate this man.
914231023394787328 2017-09-30 20:50:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No one can touch him.

913746435224502272 2017-09-29 12:45:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Trump started his candidacy this way - "Mexicans are rapists" - now I wonder if it was just his racism/demagoguery or a plan.
913736915521884163 2017-09-29 12:07:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate @pdacosta @SafetyPinDaily He is a blight on the court and will be for decades. When trump is long gone he'll be assaulting workers' rights, environmental law, etc.

912864903861555200 2017-09-26 02:22:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum These guys hate women so much.
912793104570372098 2017-09-26 21:36:49 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @marcorubio @RepJenniffer @VP Get it done.
912783294558765056 2017-09-26 20:57:50 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain All comprehensive legislation is repeatedly amended. Go to it guys! That's why you're there! Thanks Senator McCain.
912782667678146560 2017-09-26 20:55:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila So glad to hear this!
912781317871407106 2017-09-26 20:49:59 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Do you have a job or are you just a philosopher at large?
912749014076084225 2017-09-26 18:41:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila His brain is a lava lamp. He must be carted off.
912748680733700096 2017-09-26 18:40:18 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Deeply tired of this grotesque man.
912748390143991808 2017-09-26 18:39:08 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper I can't.
912748339371880448 2017-09-26 18:38:56 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Burning crosses outside the White House.
912748121947611137 2017-09-26 18:38:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No one knows. Including him.
912747923712200704 2017-09-26 18:37:17 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Send help to Puerto Rico. Impersonate a human being for a few days.
912747547575373825 2017-09-26 18:35:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @PopupProtests Seems like one of the creepiest people ever.
912737020274933765 2017-09-26 17:53:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Is Roger Stone as scary as he looks? He makes me physically afraid.
912736821934731266 2017-09-26 17:53:10 UTC <gaughran444> @funder So ready. Haven't awaited anything this eagerly since I was 9.5 months pregnant 25 years ago.
912735589442686976 2017-09-26 17:48:16 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama Thank you Mr. President.
912689605899583488 2017-09-26 14:45:33 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This vile little man.
912689037701472256 2017-09-26 14:43:18 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveSchmidtSES @joanwalsh Love Steve Schmidt. Smart, patriotic and totally honest.
912688504282521601 2017-09-26 14:41:11 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Talk faster.
912660487527071745 2017-09-26 12:49:51 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @LibyaLiberty In some respects he's radical. That's why I love him.
912660232698044416 2017-09-26 12:48:50 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC There's a first time for everything.
912659345862725632 2017-09-26 12:45:19 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Enough with this crap. Like Jason from Friday the 13th. Die already.
912658828310847488 2017-09-26 12:43:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Olivianuzzi You had no choice.
912656329709322240 2017-09-26 12:33:19 UTC <gaughran444> @senjudiciary @Sam_Rubinstein @steve_vladeck Wish I could see this.
912654841675120641 2017-09-26 12:27:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 The feeling is mutual.
912653289510047744 2017-09-26 12:21:15 UTC <gaughran444> @politico King James.
912652989437038592 2017-09-26 12:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @NYDLC @MarkFavors This is how we get our country back.
912652900157018112 2017-09-26 12:19:42 UTC <gaughran444> @NYDLC @MarkFavors Nothing matters more. Nothing.
912651736355151872 2017-09-26 12:15:04 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @tedlieu Group rate?
912616373456646145 2017-09-26 09:54:33 UTC <gaughran444> @renato_mariotti This legislation is critical.
912506212490637312 2017-09-25 02:36:49 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Mr. Charming. Has top notch healthcare for life. Tried to take it away from millions. Isn't he the cutest thing?
912498895262973952 2017-09-25 02:07:44 UTC <gaughran444> @SamanthaJPower Yes that's what he's saying.
912495261179670529 2017-09-25 01:53:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump John McCain will be remembered as an American hero. You will be remembered as low point in our nation's history. You are a disease.
912487312612904960 2017-09-25 01:21:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow Trump is scared of him.
912487050791747584 2017-09-25 01:20:40 UTC <gaughran444> No one can touch him. No one.
912481977500143617 2017-09-25 01:00:31 UTC <gaughran444> @KingJames @TrueFactsStated Or Governor of Ohio.
912480769704112129 2017-09-25 00:55:43 UTC <gaughran444> @FoxNews @seanhannity @newtgingrich Hot air alert.
912466206376022017 2017-09-25 23:57:51 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorCollins Thank you Senator Collins.
912465955720192000 2017-09-25 23:56:51 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Stop. They've turned into stalkers.
912463769908994048 2017-09-25 23:48:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Nothing more offensive to a white supremacist than a highly successful black man, be it LeBron James or Barack Obama.
912463004054298624 2017-09-25 23:45:07 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorCollins @TrueFactsStated Their fearless leader is doing his damnedest.
912439261697335296 2017-09-25 22:10:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SherriWhit They're terrible.  But at this point even the Dems should be speaking up. Trump is out of control and dangerous.
912436542265872385 2017-09-25 21:59:58 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig This is dangerous. Is there not a single member of Congress willing to speak up?
912423423070138370 2017-09-25 21:07:50 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Dignified man. In contrast to others.
912416794467557377 2017-09-25 20:41:30 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber He's a gentle soul. Off the court, at least.
912381421389533185 2017-09-25 18:20:56 UTC <gaughran444> @stormtrees @maggieNYT @critic_social That's the question!!
912380747406856192 2017-09-25 18:18:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax That's more like it.
912378387854917638 2017-09-25 18:08:53 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC You should be ashamed of yourself.
912372957443497984 2017-09-25 17:47:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Actually he does care. He hates black people. Especially successful black people.
912372687737147392 2017-09-25 17:46:14 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @TrueFactsStated Yeah, he's permanently off the list of good republicans with this one.
912365955627577345 2017-09-25 17:19:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan One of the worst people ever.
912355090224295943 2017-09-25 16:36:18 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost He's not very bright and his grasp on reality seems to be loosening. This is not safe.
912354861693489152 2017-09-25 16:35:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @politico Thereby burnishing McCain's reputation for the ages.
912354508117823488 2017-09-25 16:34:00 UTC <gaughran444> @Twitter @JuddApatow Brown people are not people to him. He doesn't care.
912333958750392320 2017-09-25 15:12:20 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @SusaMorgan Yes. Money, money, money. But Russia will not go away.
912333721877000193 2017-09-25 15:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Why aren't people having a serious conversation about his escalating mental illness? #25thAmendment
912332502785773568 2017-09-25 15:06:33 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @SusaMorgan Yes. Very scary. They are invertebrates. Among other things, trump is floridly mentally ill and dangerous. And they focus on Obamacare.
912314756417163271 2017-09-25 13:56:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan It's an ill wind that blows no good.
912313299747909632 2017-09-25 13:50:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia Never cared. Never will.
912312713023500289 2017-09-25 13:47:55 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Good to hear. Hurry!
912305498522824709 2017-09-25 13:19:15 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Trump hates black people. And he hates successful black people most of all.
912305084180176896 2017-09-25 13:17:36 UTC <gaughran444> @KingJames Great athlete, great American. Thanks.
912304113249132544 2017-09-25 13:13:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax They're not even people to him.
912303957300666368 2017-09-25 13:13:07 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro He's herpes with a red tie.
912303568958496768 2017-09-25 13:11:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Have they got him bound & gagged somewhere? The crazy train is picking up speed. Scary.
912303241223966721 2017-09-25 13:10:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce It tried to tiptoe off while he was busy tweeting.
912188852227461120 2017-09-24 05:35:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean No dignified person would have taken this stolen seat. He's a highjacker.
912185296548171777 2017-09-24 05:21:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Hopefully it slithers over the White House.
912185074241671168 2017-09-24 05:20:43 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Can't stand it.

912085983780368384 2017-09-24 22:46:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Is he locked in a closet somewhere?
912085301660700672 2017-09-24 22:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath Heartbreaking.

912062214579900416 2017-09-24 21:12:31 UTC <gaughran444> @brennanmgilmore Love to grandpa. Good man.
912046858746388480 2017-09-24 20:11:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila So sorry.
912044552395149313 2017-09-24 20:02:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Ok Bone Spur Boy. Whatever you say.
912039678861283328 2017-09-24 19:42:58 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTumpr The people despise you. Coast to coast. Resign for clemency.
912039454004727808 2017-09-24 19:42:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTumpr You're cratering in the polls and you're criminally culpable. Stop shouting and cut a deal to resign for clemency. It's over.
912037779902750723 2017-09-24 19:35:26 UTC <gaughran444> Hahaha! Fantastic.
912036679321624576 2017-09-24 19:31:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated His brain is a lava lamp. No priorities. Just impulses, racism and hate.
912036422173020165 2017-09-24 19:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The day is young.
912036362844549138 2017-09-24 19:29:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Haha. Hockey's a white sport so they'll still come to the WH. You're a pariah and a white supremacist.
911961741227159552 2017-09-24 14:33:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Wasn't bipartisan legislation introduced to do this? Where'd it go? Critical issue.
911960615585030144 2017-09-24 14:28:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @RepMaxineWaters @amjoyshow She's marvelous. Crystal clear explanation of Putin's interest in trump's presidency.

911951099556491264 2017-09-24 13:51:00 UTC <gaughran444> @jchaltiwanger That's America. We need our country back.
911950561599160320 2017-09-24 13:48:51 UTC <gaughran444> @ddale8 Popovich/Kerr 2020.
911950384918401024 2017-09-24 13:48:09 UTC <gaughran444> Trump is feeling the long arm of the law start to wrap around his neck, and so like any abuser savages his usual victims.
911948237308858368 2017-09-24 13:39:37 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 Don't stop there. America lets you breathe day after day!

911943769490100227 2017-09-24 13:21:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Tell it, Claude. Quisling bastard needs knee pads.
911941374412562433 2017-09-24 13:12:21 UTC <gaughran444> @SquigglyRick Perfect.
911898780668235776 2017-09-24 10:23:06 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 That's it.
911894565220732928 2017-09-24 10:06:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Don't get him.
911894371951312899 2017-09-24 10:05:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @ShaunKing Of course he was.
911894089133707264 2017-09-24 10:04:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Exactly. Trump is a stone cold racist, and needs to be called out for the plague that he is. No euphemisms.
911891704134950912 2017-09-24 09:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @critic_social Exactly. In trump talk this means "the Russians pushed me across the finish line." Illegitimate, treason white supremacist indeed.
911891115569278976 2017-09-24 09:52:38 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson We're getting there. Any day now.

911801287024549888 2017-09-23 03:55:41 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Why is this broad in such a perpetual rage? Hasn't she gone very far on minimal talent? Why so pissed off?
911793806273662976 2017-09-23 03:25:58 UTC <gaughran444> @BenSasse @tribelaw Justice Jackson, one of the best writers, if not the best writer, to ever sit on the Supreme Court.
911793366941278209 2017-09-23 03:24:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh crap. Really? I always loved the SSB.

911785822638284800 2017-09-23 02:54:14 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol It wasn't brutal. It wasn't profane. It was to the point. And true.
911785572083040257 2017-09-23 02:53:15 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Oh yes.

911782297971695616 2017-09-23 02:40:14 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Vividly.
911778190565224448 2017-09-23 02:23:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Lindzeta @JaneGrader He is. Human garbage.
911776553821929472 2017-09-23 02:17:25 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @Lindzeta LeBron James is an American hero. End of story.
911776120097398785 2017-09-23 02:15:41 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien @RyanLizza And then there's the long arm of the law tightening around his neck. He's wigging out.
911775324974845959 2017-09-23 02:12:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Classy, dignified guy. Unlike that racist madman in the WH.
911773735262277633 2017-09-23 02:06:13 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis As even this freak knows, this is not a first amendment issue. The NFL is not a govt entity. This is a racist crazy president issue.

911689225602560000 2017-09-23 20:30:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @bannerite @babykitty40 @critic_social Sad but true. That's the bottom line with this administration.
911688506208026625 2017-09-23 20:27:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila I hope you've heard from your family.
911685578051211264 2017-09-23 20:15:54 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Mighty white of him.
911681166423576576 2017-09-23 19:58:22 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Curry is a class act, and so is LeBron. Both outlandishly talented & totally disciplined. Great role models. Then there's trump.
911680561567158272 2017-09-23 19:55:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Oh, I think we see the depths of his stupidity every day. Hard to miss.
911680035945353216 2017-09-23 19:53:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @mayatcontreras He's the White Supremacist in Chief. No one can seriously dispute this.
911679427616149504 2017-09-23 19:51:28 UTC <gaughran444> @funder The more the merrier. Fuck trump.
911634626518634496 2017-09-23 16:53:26 UTC <gaughran444> @KenRoth Wholly logical and the right thing to do.
911632710648647680 2017-09-23 16:45:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @JacobAWohl @DrTyffaniMDent Bum is too kind a word. He exercised a lot of restraint.
911630636171059200 2017-09-23 16:37:35 UTC <gaughran444> @StephenCurry30 @KingJames The King has spoken. Thank you.
911600463124017153 2017-09-23 14:37:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 No they never will. He will have to be threatened with criminal prosecution & forced to resign. Spineless Congress.
911599341206466562 2017-09-23 14:33:14 UTC <gaughran444> @henryfingjames Klansman in respectable citizen's clothing.

911205407129038848 2017-09-22 12:27:53 UTC <gaughran444> @NYCoach1 @Amy_Siskind Probably with xanax that's covered by their insurance plan.
911204664707895296 2017-09-22 12:24:56 UTC <gaughran444> @Brax6Jackson @AdrianCJax This is exciting.
911202014415253504 2017-09-22 12:14:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's the planet-threatening Salieri.
911201530665160704 2017-09-22 12:12:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So disconcerting. And now I have to work hard to casually slip "dotard" into conversations.
911201023305355265 2017-09-22 12:10:27 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Right. So man up and reject Graham Cassidy.
911187067392151552 2017-09-22 11:15:00 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Surely there's a place for him in the White House.
911185313300664320 2017-09-22 11:08:02 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I want my money back.
911185135357370368 2017-09-22 11:07:19 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro They are his people, ever loyal.
911184614617702400 2017-09-22 11:05:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump A good place in history. As opposed to yours, the Triumph of Ignorance.
911183694081216513 2017-09-22 11:01:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You'll be given the opportunity to resign. Then it will be over. It'll be okay.
911069415214546944 2017-09-21 03:27:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate How about utterly indifferent?
911065912559722497 2017-09-21 03:13:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @thehill And he's a klansman who hides his sheets under a suit. Barely.
911040659225808897 2017-09-21 01:33:14 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @nytimesworld And on which stage is his sparkling wit appreciated?
911040092906639361 2017-09-21 01:30:59 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Just in case he needed a reminder.
911037754888347648 2017-09-21 01:21:41 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR So unsettling to agree with this pie-faced monster.
911033956849606657 2017-09-21 01:06:36 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt He should be canned and have to pay it back.
911033737256820736 2017-09-21 01:05:43 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy How dishonest and disgusting you are. Meanwhile Cassidy and Graham keep top of the line lifetime health benefits.
911021247668133889 2017-09-21 00:16:06 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Can always count on your for a much needed laugh. Thanks fella!

911019974768152578 2017-09-21 00:11:02 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your name should be Luther Strange. Suits you.
911019407777857536 2017-09-21 00:08:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Mobute @epopppp Oh my god. Imagine if this were happening to rich white people.
911015838450192384 2017-09-21 23:54:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @kpmel You're right. He gets very revved up. It's not pretty.
910975124207226880 2017-09-21 21:12:49 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Trump gets kind of turned on by tyrants doesn't he? Among his many appealing qualities.
910974603241115650 2017-09-21 21:10:45 UTC <gaughran444> @nikkihaley @alivitali @markknoller She wants to be president. So she's working for this dangerous imbecile and trying to whitewash the threat he poses to all.
910974195160543232 2017-09-21 21:09:07 UTC <gaughran444> @justinjm1 @desiderioDC Oh man. That's hideous for everyone involved.
910913541594632193 2017-09-21 17:08:06 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Funny coming from you. Ok.
910913479372132352 2017-09-21 17:07:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NRO @TrueFactsStated Absolutely. Good man.
910913367090585601 2017-09-21 17:07:25 UTC <gaughran444> @funder He will be given the opportunity to resign instead and after he has soaked his Depends he will take this opportunity.
910848555761520640 2017-09-21 12:49:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Ty Cobb is an embarrassment. What competent atty yaks about the most sensitive case going in a D.C. steakhouse? And the moustache.
910847353934016512 2017-09-21 12:45:06 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Good for him.
910847032037961729 2017-09-21 12:43:49 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wow. Bad bad bad.
910842445524545537 2017-09-21 12:25:36 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Oh stop with the facts already.
910842247444406274 2017-09-21 12:24:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Can't see enough of these. Thank you!
910829651232268288 2017-09-21 11:34:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No, but the penalties for not doing so, if caught, are serious.
910829151350910976 2017-09-21 11:32:46 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound like an ill-informed used car dealer. Except what you're proposing will kill people.
910711658238152704 2017-09-20 03:45:54 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Can't wait to be postpartum from this whole damned family.
910707348502663169 2017-09-20 03:28:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Sorry. This sounds very hard.
910706338312986625 2017-09-20 03:24:45 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Hope springs eternal, right grandma killer? The American people have spoken - twice - but what do you care?
910694659940331520 2017-09-20 02:38:21 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball @val_mccabe The White House intimidating Comey. Entertaining thought.
910677425570410496 2017-09-20 01:29:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump America is soooo lucky to have a team of prosecutors who are going to take you down. Soon!
910676745547866112 2017-09-20 01:27:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @traceygaughran The sooner the better.
910676620851269632 2017-09-20 01:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr The America people have spoken. They don't want TrumpCare. Proceed at your peril.
910676293003423745 2017-09-20 01:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @DMRDynamics @SenWarren Critically important.
910675892011196416 2017-09-20 01:23:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog Huge. Did trump know?
910675575047622656 2017-09-20 01:22:31 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @SteveKopack Says the man who has comprehensive, lifetime health coverage. What a punk.
910675324391784448 2017-09-20 01:21:31 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @traceygaughran Or at least the White House, ffs.
910674673360363520 2017-09-20 01:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Stop. Just stop.
910672979494875139 2017-09-20 01:12:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 The Republican Party: Viagra Falls.
910672817049554945 2017-09-20 01:11:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Oh yeah. He's very scared. As he should be.
910672663961571328 2017-09-20 01:10:57 UTC <gaughran444> @lizzwinstead @jimmykimmel I really admire you for jumping in on this. Good man. Your son will be very proud of you someday.
910672436294758400 2017-09-20 01:10:02 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Unlike trump you have the intellect to know what a disaster this bill would be for the American people. Shame on you.
910552044402102273 2017-09-20 17:11:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated But there is an expectation that Mueller will kick trump's ass.
910551585759137794 2017-09-20 17:09:49 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes No that was Obama's fault because he was alive then.
910549786067111938 2017-09-20 17:02:40 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost So so tired of this game show imbecile.
910490830984577024 2017-09-20 13:08:24 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @associatesmind Ok, dude. Go pro se. See how it pans out.
910483653012152320 2017-09-20 12:39:53 UTC <gaughran444> @RebeccaMorin_ @politico As hundreds at the UN check to see if their translating devices are working.
910322852532035585 2017-09-19 02:00:55 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Trump did lay me down in sheets of linen right? Isn't that the kompromat business?
910322045212413953 2017-09-19 01:57:43 UTC <gaughran444> @briantashman That's grotesque. She should resign.
910056335261229056 2017-09-19 08:21:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Both. Always.
910008012923908096 2017-09-18 05:09:52 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 They're as clever as they look.
909893221542776839 2017-09-18 21:33:43 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Oh ffs. This too? Can't someone just give him a dart board with obama's face on it?
909883971743436800 2017-09-18 20:56:58 UTC <gaughran444> @Protect_Wldlife How horrific.
909883659599187974 2017-09-18 20:55:43 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics The Repubs are like the bad guy in a horror movie whose eyes open after everyone thinks he's dead. Stop already!
909873420590108672 2017-09-18 20:15:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow NYers are good people. I hope he is okay.
909871380082122752 2017-09-18 20:06:56 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @SecondLady Thank you, Mother.
909870904896782339 2017-09-18 20:05:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics In contrast to the lousy job he's doing on Mars.
909870019995160581 2017-09-18 20:01:31 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Every draft dodger should have one.
909861034340573184 2017-09-18 19:25:49 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP As long as you don't mind a draft-dodger. Or a guy who reneges on a promise of citizenship for people who serve. Or a trans-phobe.
909835338583076864 2017-09-18 17:43:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @OfficialCBC @CharlesMBlow @JenGranholm Yes he is. Clear as day.
909827982147117056 2017-09-18 17:14:29 UTC <gaughran444> @alevine014 @LindseyGrahamSC The American people have spoken. Cut the crap.

909652337416949760 2017-09-17 05:36:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Love this guy.
909650858299809794 2017-09-17 05:30:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid A friend of mine asked a NYC cop if she could spit on Trump Tower. He said, "Why not? Everyone else does."
909650025956937728 2017-09-17 05:27:21 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Better slogan than MAGA.
909649130326302722 2017-09-17 05:23:47 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Abject bullshit. He pouted and signaled to his acolytes not to vote for her.
909648214193840128 2017-09-17 05:20:09 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Sounds like an enjoyable working environment.
909537181823365120 2017-09-17 21:58:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Can this chaotic mess of an administration say something coherent about this very critical issue?
909530059211460609 2017-09-17 21:30:39 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Absolutely inexcusable.
909526916302073856 2017-09-17 21:18:09 UTC <gaughran444> @RVAwonk If Hillary had behaved like trump for just one day she would have been involuntarily committed.
909508355978403840 2017-09-17 20:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Don't think they saw this one coming.

909182997261250560 2017-09-16 22:31:33 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Maybe the babies from the hospital where he was born can chime in.
909182521220284417 2017-09-16 22:29:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Do we really have to know who the Juggalos are or will this pass quickly? Hard drive is almost full.
909182255456645120 2017-09-16 22:28:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders You'll never be president. Think of who you'd like to support.
909171030287032320 2017-09-16 21:43:59 UTC <gaughran444> @womensmarch Poor little babies.
909156915057438721 2017-09-16 20:47:54 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Thank you Bone Spur Boy!
909153570804633600 2017-09-16 20:34:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That'll do. Really.
909148364494786560 2017-09-16 20:13:55 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Does he get a degree with that hat?
909143448489480200 2017-09-16 19:54:23 UTC <gaughran444> @KFILE @JamesMAstill Guess he's signaling his staunch support for first amendment speech.
909141407356608518 2017-09-16 19:46:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Same here. Couldn't stand RR but he would not have collaborated with an enemy state. Would any other president have?
909135591417303042 2017-09-16 19:23:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I guess we don't have to worry about Zuckerberg's presidential aspirations.
909134996245549056 2017-09-16 19:20:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @kpmel Yes! We need our country back.
909113986586742784 2017-09-16 17:57:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Whatever it takes.
909112930066501634 2017-09-16 17:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @WSJ @renato_mariotti So very interesting. Thank you.
909111485384798209 2017-09-16 17:47:23 UTC <gaughran444> @studiohq @funder @critic_social Made my day, friend.
909107248923856896 2017-09-16 17:30:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Demands an apology? Fuck him & the white-hooded horse he rode in on.
909088664172470273 2017-09-16 16:16:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Always. We saw him.

908277785038385154 2017-09-14 10:34:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Yes you proposed to do exactly that, you sick bastard. Glad someone talked some sense into you.
908270203133407232 2017-09-14 10:04:25 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @critic_social Trump would have called security and had the guy hauled out.
908269595286491136 2017-09-14 10:02:01 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes News flash: 1. 1st Amendment bars govt decrees of permissible speech, 2. Trump is a white supremacist.

906826246595674113 2017-09-10 10:26:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TUSK81 Ah. Perhaps there is a God. Watch this repulsive administration ask him to recuse himself. Watch him say no.
906647897860534272 2017-09-09 22:37:58 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 So many men have so many things that are bigger than his. Must be difficult.

906430345238605824 2017-09-09 08:13:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 He's not capable of much thought. Someone probably told him to say this.
906277695373295616 2017-09-08 22:06:55 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Wtf? Didn't we just have a national day of prayer? How about you guys just try for the competent government thing? Skip the theocracy.
906273775364128769 2017-09-08 21:51:20 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Trump reminds me of a 7th grade mean girl. Except for the Hitlerian stuff.
906273352381120512 2017-09-08 21:49:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Equifax @4everNeverTrump How is this legal? Sounds like a wonderful basis for a class action suit.  They'd better watch it.
906270168350728192 2017-09-08 21:37:00 UTC <gaughran444> @bryanbehar Of course. And why would trump campaign give a damn about Hillary's "fitness?"  Nonsensical.
906265727857868800 2017-09-08 21:19:21 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior Just disgusting.
906264510427578368 2017-09-08 21:14:31 UTC <gaughran444> @hannahdreier Nazis.

905918541370605569 2017-09-07 22:19:46 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Too late. His brain has turned into lasagna.
905911253373214721 2017-09-07 21:50:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics I cannot get a single cell in my body to care about this woman.
905910714040295426 2017-09-07 21:48:39 UTC <gaughran444> @NYMag Wtf not? We don't bother with career diplomats any more, right?
905909974043320320 2017-09-07 21:45:43 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing Trump made America safe for these little bastards.
905905839948447744 2017-09-07 21:29:17 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wow. Disgraceful. At this late date.
905905552475136000 2017-09-07 21:28:09 UTC <gaughran444> @Fox26Houston @nbc6 @VP Are you going to use the words climate change or will it be a bunch of nonsense?
905905308253356032 2017-09-07 21:27:11 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan You're trying to break off more $ for the rich. You're fooling no one.
905904802198155264 2017-09-07 21:25:10 UTC <gaughran444> @RWPUSA Wow. What a pig.
905902132737466368 2017-09-07 21:14:33 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC Always such a relaxed looking guy.
905243219159547905 2017-09-05 01:36:16 UTC <gaughran444> @francescah28 @RogueSNRadvisor What an aberrant man.
905242975575396352 2017-09-05 01:35:18 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Maybe someone should mention this to evangelicals. A hard pill to swallow.
905242629524385792 2017-09-05 01:33:56 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Stone cold racist with an ugly past.
905237547214929921 2017-09-05 01:13:44 UTC <gaughran444> @anakcoronado_ So so many people feel this way. And we will fight for you.
905236145436581888 2017-09-05 01:08:10 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt He's probably not capable of a train of thought as coherent as what you just said.
905235100375371776 2017-09-05 01:04:01 UTC <gaughran444> @latinovictoryus He doesn't know. He never knows. Which doesn't stop him. He's poisonous gas.
905234693628600321 2017-09-05 01:02:24 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw He is animated by bigotry and greed but is incapable of concerted action. His brain is a lava lamp.
905233252499292161 2017-09-05 00:56:40 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @anakcoronado_ We want you here. You make America better.
905233076942512128 2017-09-05 00:55:58 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @CNNPolitics How does trump lying warrant  headline?

905232129889579008 2017-09-05 00:52:12 UTC <gaughran444> @woodruffbets @critic_social Exactly.
905231712145244165 2017-09-05 00:50:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JaneGrader He has no heart and half a brain. He is an affliction.

905227097878274049 2017-09-05 00:32:13 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @woodruffbets How horrifying.
905226925882400768 2017-09-05 00:31:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MaraLaGoFuckYou All of the very best health to you.
905225550830153728 2017-09-05 00:26:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It's a dark time but the rule of law, and we, will prevail.
905224987598098432 2017-09-05 00:23:49 UTC <gaughran444> @cher Absolutely.
905224349745115136 2017-09-05 00:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @SenSanders Wait - are you getting into identity politics now.
905223369477562368 2017-09-05 00:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JoinAryanJones Okay Aryan Jones, you wretch. Later.
905223071933632513 2017-09-05 00:16:13 UTC <gaughran444> @HITEXECUTIVE Maybe it was her conscience speaking.

905059940288606208 2017-09-05 13:27:59 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @Hadas_Gold @kpmel So many syllables, so few thoughts.
905057028363735042 2017-09-05 13:16:25 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @ananavarro Ana on what basis would you count on Paul Ryan?
905056426166538240 2017-09-05 13:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @harrysiegel When Dems are back in power we should dismantle these bastards like the Repubs have dismantled the EPA.

905048832643391488 2017-09-05 12:43:51 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Right. So start fighting for the Dreamers. You know it's the right thing to do. You'll be a national hero. Go down in history as a leader.
905048258392846336 2017-09-05 12:41:34 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @DefineAmerican We want them to stay.
905048152788619264 2017-09-05 12:41:09 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @DavidWright_CNN Wouldn't it be cool if he started telling the truth?
905047620506222592 2017-09-05 12:39:02 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @noahsiegler Please tell them that the majority of the country is behind them. They make America America and we're lucky to have them.
905046775916109824 2017-09-05 12:35:40 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @Philip_Elliott Spineless. Doing what's right figures nowhere in that calculation. All self-interest, all the time.
905046208615505921 2017-09-05 12:33:25 UTC <gaughran444> @BroderickGreer Now there's a good man.
905045654694748161 2017-09-05 12:31:13 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Absolutely. Hope it's not bad. What are you doing about #Dreamers?
905045220932419584 2017-09-05 12:29:30 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel An utter coward. Like all bullies.
905042345246240768 2017-09-05 12:18:04 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix Don't fight the feeling! We are so ready!

905040636507717632 2017-09-05 12:11:17 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta @beantownsox Hi. You and I clearly don't agree on politics, but see you're a dog lover. Same here, big time. Take care.
905039898213801984 2017-09-05 12:08:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis The Racist in Chief. Just as he promised in his "Mexicans are rapists" opening salvo. Most white didn't care, and here we are.
905039415038369792 2017-09-05 12:06:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro On a strictly cost/benefit analysis we'd come out way ahead.
905038717693423616 2017-09-05 12:03:39 UTC <gaughran444> @lawfareblog @benjaminwittes @Susan_Hennessey All deserved.
905038294223917056 2017-09-05 12:01:58 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean He's an historic failure as president but a competent demagogue.
905038056763338752 2017-09-05 12:01:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Our country is being raped by this primitive imbecile. Grotesque.
905037409242537984 2017-09-05 11:58:27 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta A real president of course. Not this coward.
904923451328253952 2017-09-04 04:25:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Flimflam man.
904917976620703745 2017-09-04 04:03:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MikeScarcella These cowardly, privileged bigots terrorize hard-working young people and children and then run away. Beneath contempt.
904911200005349376 2017-09-04 03:36:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @wexler Fuck that fucking wall already. Don't want a dime of my hard earned taxes going to that bigoted bs.
904910075508256768 2017-09-04 03:32:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Poor little souls.
904909957677625345 2017-09-04 03:32:00 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ I hope they don't change a thing.
904909535747481605 2017-09-04 03:30:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump God help us.
904883804732522496 2017-09-04 01:48:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Didn't we once have leaders who persuaded the American people to do what is right? Lincoln and the civil war? FDR & the Lend Lease Act?
904881725163134976 2017-09-04 01:39:49 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Walks like a duck, talks like a duck.
904881485454479360 2017-09-04 01:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths Do it. Grass lawns are an environmental drain, and it will be pretty and really fun.
904878738151755776 2017-09-04 01:27:57 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @JaneGrader @HankLewis1942 Wow. Hope things get better for you. Seriously.
904869580480401408 2017-09-04 00:51:34 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @HankLewis1942 @JaneGrader Thanks.
904864371834314754 2017-09-04 00:30:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @lulu_says2 I don't really know. Claude comes up with a lot of good info. Smart and patriotic. In depth govt experience. Good haircut. It works for me.
904863759205851136 2017-09-04 00:28:26 UTC <gaughran444> @lulu_says2 @TrueFactsStated Any time, Bro.
904861918673989632 2017-09-04 00:21:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @AUkeibro Indeed. That's why I keep winning powerball.
904861758887792640 2017-09-04 00:20:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @lulu_says2 I think Claude has a great record and if he gets anything wrong he immediately discloses that. And clearly a good guy. I'm a fan.
904860760945418241 2017-09-04 00:16:31 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @JaneGrader They're hogging the airwaves now. This is their death rattle. It's very ugly. But decency will prevail.
904860440462753793 2017-09-04 00:15:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I predict an evening of similar, heart-felt comments. Just wait . . .
904859491547664386 2017-09-04 00:11:28 UTC <gaughran444> @robdelaney @YDSA_ Damn!!! Honest Abe!
904858969621106692 2017-09-04 00:09:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid When my ancestors came, they let you in unless you were coughing up blood. The smug narrative of "my family did it right" is fiction.
904858570533064705 2017-09-04 00:07:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids These are helping me get through this ghastly time for our country. I'm not kidding.
904858100070580224 2017-09-04 00:05:57 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I'm all ears. Always ready to hear from my president.
904857943652360193 2017-09-04 00:05:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is why so many people like you. We want the info but we also like you.
904836313085509634 2017-09-04 22:39:22 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Grotesque. That little cracker is going back to his roots. And Trump is a devoted bigot. The suffering they are willing to impose.
904833272852643841 2017-09-04 22:27:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I try.
904833190145265665 2017-09-04 22:26:58 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid My ancestors were dirt poor and came from Europe without papers. The "my family did it legally" thing is a total myth.
904831976510808065 2017-09-04 22:22:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Good, good, good. Get the quislings.
904831772529229824 2017-09-04 22:21:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenatorDurbin Try a little decency. Enact the Dream Act.
904810611132989440 2017-09-04 20:57:14 UTC <gaughran444> @ObamaPlusKids Can't see enough of these.
904734169049309184 2017-09-04 15:53:29 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @CSBranded I have the biggest mouth in the family by miles.
904734049410981888 2017-09-04 15:53:01 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @CSBranded Good idea but they're shy.
904733909526700034 2017-09-04 15:52:27 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @JaneGrader Haha!
904733222344556544 2017-09-04 15:49:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JamesMartinSJ @Teresainman007 Hold on there. Complicated issue. Evangelicals are the trump people.
904715500835540992 2017-09-04 14:39:18 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Remember when people kvetched that Obama couldn't get legislation passed?
904715069908451329 2017-09-04 14:37:36 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @coach_sjkl Fantastic. Urge them to pass the Dream Act which will offer more protection.
904714901112967169 2017-09-04 14:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Variety Say no please. Let's go back to the distinguished public servants thing.
904711925786963970 2017-09-04 14:25:06 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @LindseyGrahamSC @EricColumbus This is invaluable information. Thank you. So should  people push congress to pass the Dream Act? Seems so.
904710579104907265 2017-09-04 14:19:45 UTC <gaughran444> @paulwaldman1 He doesn't have a heart. That was a lie too.
904710308006162432 2017-09-04 14:18:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CTDems @RepJohnLarson Good man. Fight like hell.
904710022743158784 2017-09-04 14:17:32 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @coach_sjkl Now you're talking. Make noise. This is our country. It's the dreamers' country too.
904709713190952960 2017-09-04 14:16:18 UTC <gaughran444> @coach_sjkl We will. Set aside your fear and tap into your rage. Bombard your congress people with calls about DACA every day. Every day.
904709378158231552 2017-09-04 14:14:59 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt @JaneGrader Oh my god yes.
904709212114169861 2017-09-04 14:14:19 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @coach_sjkl This dismantles America. And to harm children in any way is a sin. We all must bombard congress with endless calls to oppose this. Daily.
904705630832820231 2017-09-04 14:00:05 UTC <gaughran444> @coach_sjkl We must take it back. And we will.
904705531327152128 2017-09-04 13:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump @chrislhayes @julissaarce At best she's a cipher. At worst she's a collaborator.
904705005705449473 2017-09-04 13:57:36 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @JoyAnnReid It's a warm, deep embrace.
904704895227486208 2017-09-04 13:57:10 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Happy Labor Day!
904704519321382914 2017-09-04 13:55:40 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump This feels like Nazi Germany. They were given yellow stars. I can't stand it.
904704242744733696 2017-09-04 13:54:34 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball Wish it would break into a deadly fist fight. Wonder who would win.
904703814493712385 2017-09-04 13:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes I have police in my family. They don't want grenade launchers. They want gun control.
904703467771580416 2017-09-04 13:51:29 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Holy cow! Didn't know he said this. Thank you.
904703315207999489 2017-09-04 13:50:53 UTC <gaughran444> @RWPUSA We need them. They make America America.
904702958130081792 2017-09-04 13:49:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @JRubinBlogger Make America white again. Was clear as day when he announced his candidacy.
904702521532350464 2017-09-04 13:47:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Imbecile. But no doubt a wonderful Christian.
904702397422981121 2017-09-04 13:47:14 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Blinding hypocrisy.
904702101179260928 2017-09-04 13:46:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Will_Bunch We need to know, if the truth can be obtained.
904701453826220032 2017-09-04 13:43:29 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @DavidCornDC Absolutely. Make America white again.
904701277988429824 2017-09-04 13:42:47 UTC <gaughran444> @seungminkim Unbearable. And caused by the United States of America. A dark dark time.
904701069720248320 2017-09-04 13:41:58 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @RogueSNRadvisor Oh wow. Spoken like a true sociopath.
904700482828034048 2017-09-04 13:39:38 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper From the man destroying our country.
904700282424188929 2017-09-04 13:38:50 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @ananavarro Amen, Ana.
904700224614137856 2017-09-04 13:38:36 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Revolutions have been kicked off for less.
904700115151192065 2017-09-04 13:38:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I truly don't think he knows right from wrong. Soon he'll learn.
904699858786947072 2017-09-04 13:37:09 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio You're not speaking out in favor of DACA? Seriously? How do you sleep at night?
904699638845984768 2017-09-04 13:36:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated At that point it will be a self- preserving thing, not the right thing. The right thing called out long ago.  Where are the patriots?
904651382447382529 2017-09-04 10:24:31 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC It would appear so. He's decompensating.
904573339976511490 2017-09-03 05:14:25 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @mayatcontreras Absolutely. It's time for some courage and decency. #Dreamers
904572981975937026 2017-09-03 05:12:59 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @tim_cook Good. More business people should speak out.
904572600617238528 2017-09-03 05:11:28 UTC <gaughran444> @brianefallon Please speak out. We need to hear from our President on this one.
904572009216184320 2017-09-03 05:09:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @Freeyourmindkid Absolutely.
904571476048842752 2017-09-03 05:07:00 UTC <gaughran444> @EdKrassen Sick bastard.
904569493145489414 2017-09-03 04:59:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @jorgeramosnews @Bros4America @AIRMANDO93 We're glad you're here.
904569040282279936 2017-09-03 04:57:19 UTC <gaughran444> @lasesana Yeah really. Like reading a goddamned ouija board.
904568664476839936 2017-09-03 04:55:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @jorgeramosnews @AdrianCJax @__ramon17 We want you to stay.
904567657009172480 2017-09-03 04:51:50 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 That's what his candidacy and presidency have been about. MAGA means make America white again. Pure and simple.
904567186114654208 2017-09-03 04:49:57 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @lasesana @RosLehtinen No heart. No brain.
904567048348602368 2017-09-03 04:49:25 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Good. They should take no prisoners on this one.
904566964894527488 2017-09-03 04:49:05 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting Our country needs you. We're glad you're here.
904566520990326784 2017-09-03 04:47:19 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Right. They need to be threatened with obliteration in 2018. The only language they understand.
904565869082271744 2017-09-03 04:44:43 UTC <gaughran444> @joshhendler An historic low point for our country.
904565681437507584 2017-09-03 04:43:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's an affliction.
904565430798385152 2017-09-03 04:42:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AGSchneiderman Good man.
904565159758372869 2017-09-03 04:41:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @KeilaBishop25 Good. You keep going.  Our country needs you.
904558481902063616 2017-09-03 04:15:22 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @KeilaBishop25 We're glad you're here and want you to stay.
904557669926785025 2017-09-03 04:12:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hear, hear.
904522302292975618 2017-09-03 01:51:36 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC It's very irresponsible of you to egg on our deranged president. He does not need to be inflamed. Talk quietly to sane officials.
904485054704967680 2017-09-03 23:23:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yeah he probably thinks it's Spanish for illegal.
904441843831771137 2017-09-03 20:31:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @ACLU Can you sue them? What can be done? It should be a criminal matter. Horrible.
904437058495815681 2017-09-03 20:12:53 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @CharlesMBlow Twice I saw people chasing each other down the sidewalk with machetes in NYC in the 80s. 8th Ave & 2nd Ave. Not a good look, trust me.
904436622678249474 2017-09-03 20:11:09 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You understand so few things. Turf this to the generals.
904436479497297921 2017-09-03 20:10:34 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @tribelaw Do tell. Really? Really?
904412061807116288 2017-09-03 18:33:33 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @Margari2549 A typical example would be state restrictions on access to abortion which go up the chain of fed courts to the SCOTUS.
904411734735294464 2017-09-03 18:32:15 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @Margari2549 Of course!
904411684852432896 2017-09-03 18:32:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @BonnieWashing14 Ha! Like another language right?
904411497845096449 2017-09-03 18:31:18 UTC <gaughran444> @France4Hillary @GlennThrush Excruciating horse's ass.
904411347131277312 2017-09-03 18:30:42 UTC <gaughran444> @ToluseO Horse's ass.
904410928694919169 2017-09-03 18:29:03 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @Margari2549 Yes, someone has to challenge them in federal court in order for the state laws to be reviewed.
904410690378715142 2017-09-03 18:28:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @BonnieWashing14 My parents are from Brooklyn. The Gaughrans were originally from Navan, just north of Dublin.
904405726445146113 2017-09-03 18:08:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @BonnieWashing14 That's us! Where are you?
904390938063245313 2017-09-03 17:09:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That's right. They want a winner, dammit. A neo-Nazi is fine as long as he's a winner!
904389898878283776 2017-09-03 17:05:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @mkraju Yes, we have have a co-equal legislative branch if they could only locate their spines.
904389560595091458 2017-09-03 17:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Oh my god no. Let's go for decency, intelligence and tremendous competence next time. No red carpet people need apply.
904389103646625793 2017-09-03 17:02:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Cultish fellator. Good name for a boat.
904387126992793601 2017-09-03 16:54:28 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs Of course he told children to work hard. And he did the same. It's called being a role model.
904386147651960832 2017-09-03 16:50:34 UTC <gaughran444> @BV @CassSunstein @NavKaz @business Thought this was a contemplative  Larry David.
904384980368982017 2017-09-03 16:45:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @JoyAnnReid Any decent New Yorker should be able to confirm this. Guy has been a notorious racist for decades.
904382604882964480 2017-09-03 16:36:30 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill He wants to turn America into an all white third world country.
904382280621273088 2017-09-03 16:35:12 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @abfrancois He's free-associating about very dangerous things. Super.
904381646992023552 2017-09-03 16:32:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @ekcj1234 Can't believe she has the cojones to jump in on this.
904381312060063745 2017-09-03 16:31:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @AliVelshi Surprise!!
904381175598370816 2017-09-03 16:30:49 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @jdawsey1 He probably looked at the eclipse longer than he "looks at" these ideas.
904378559447400448 2017-09-03 16:20:25 UTC <gaughran444> @FDerron My late stepmother's father, who was 70 when she was born, was born a slave in Georgia. It wasn't that long ago.
904372238954192901 2017-09-03 15:55:18 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @fivefifths So where's his proposed legislation to save DACA?
904371648878575617 2017-09-03 15:52:58 UTC <gaughran444> @fakeshoredrive I didn't think Kanye's statement about Bush was at all surprising at the time and still don't understand why it was so controversial.
904370481570226176 2017-09-03 15:48:19 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @steveholland1 Dangerous imbecile.
904370085602713600 2017-09-03 15:46:45 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC I'm so glad your here. You provide a much needed respite from and perspective on these dark times.
904367826592518144 2017-09-03 15:37:46 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @JordanUhl @JaneGrader Yes! Maybe an interpretive dance.
904365465878896640 2017-09-03 15:28:24 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @JordanUhl Has this miscreant ever heard of the first amendment? Can someone make a comic strip explaining it to him?
904364637591924736 2017-09-03 15:25:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson How sad.
904364057226084352 2017-09-03 15:22:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Yes, and he probably felt heroic for doing so. Mighty white of him.
904363876283801600 2017-09-03 15:22:05 UTC <gaughran444> @yashar He has been a notorious racist for decades, one of the main reasons he is despised in NYC.
904273524227010561 2017-09-03 09:23:03 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Fuck no.
904270444005642240 2017-09-03 09:10:49 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @Margari2549 Yes federal courts can review state laws if they're alleged to violate the constitution.
904016392097329152 2017-09-02 16:21:18 UTC <gaughran444> @SalvationArmyUS @RedCross @sendrelief @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @critic_social Oh yes! We're digging in with our silly commas, apostrophes and semi-colons! En garde!
903976508271800320 2017-09-02 13:42:49 UTC <gaughran444> @SalvationArmyUS @RedCross @sendrelief @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @critic_social Honestly I think the MAGA people are waging a war on proper English to make us latte-sipping, book-reading liberals lose our will to live.
903971293372002304 2017-09-02 13:22:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SalvationArmyUS @RedCross @sendrelief @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @critic_social Love.
903971012726935552 2017-09-02 13:20:59 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @chrislhayes Is the mayor a black guy? Maybe trump wants to check out his birth certificate before they chat.
903970493816037376 2017-09-02 13:18:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis He's going to scatter dollars from a helicopter right? Will be so cool!
903964845636280320 2017-09-02 12:56:28 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Yes. So was there a conspiracy to obstruct justice?
903963791163092993 2017-09-02 12:52:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @TheRickWilson She is.
903963442004074497 2017-09-02 12:50:54 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt That is wonderful news. Never more needed than now.
903963338689916932 2017-09-02 12:50:29 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Hopefully federal courts will serve as a bulwark against these unconstitutional proposals.
903956085127729152 2017-09-02 12:21:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Kris_Sacrebleu @kylegriffin1 @critic_social There you go! It's that whole blonde pony tail thing. Works every time!
903911419531448320 2017-09-02 09:24:10 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Binge watching Fox News. Reminds me of that scene from clockwork orange.
903911033550630912 2017-09-02 09:22:38 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Isn't Kelly getting on trump's nerves? This guy looks qualified.
903910746882535424 2017-09-02 09:21:30 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Under what possible circumstance could police need or use bayonets? Absolutely grotesque.
903908451373502464 2017-09-02 09:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Kris_Sacrebleu @kylegriffin1 @critic_social I just don't know. There's something about that woman, but I can't put my finger on it . . .
903822212175626240 2017-09-01 03:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Little shop of horrors.
903817427288555520 2017-09-01 03:10:41 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell On our tax dollars. Dysfunctional crap.
903816580810907648 2017-09-01 03:07:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And with that promise and a metro card you can take any subway in NY.
903812435848650752 2017-09-01 02:50:51 UTC <gaughran444> @business @KFILE @IvankaTrump You pointless person.
903812254533025792 2017-09-01 02:50:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM @mspoint1106 He's grotesque. I hope he gets to enjoy the same sense of suspense about his liberty someday.
903811253377929220 2017-09-01 02:46:09 UTC <gaughran444> @mkh531 @stevesilberman Disgusting fellow.
903804674008109057 2017-09-01 02:20:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Because he's dumb as a post and dementing.
903800686596501505 2017-09-01 02:04:10 UTC <gaughran444> @USTreasury @Lily_v_Shtupp @SenSchumer It makes loads of sense if you're catering to white supremacists.
903796706835345409 2017-09-01 01:48:21 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @EricTrump Let's see the receipt!!!
903794563751522306 2017-09-01 01:39:50 UTC <gaughran444> @dustinhines @TheRoot Right. He and Anthony Weiner.
903789952290447361 2017-09-01 01:21:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Leave poor Donald alone! He only wants to give!
903789554095857665 2017-09-01 01:19:55 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Then he wistfully asked a friend to find his white hood, the nice pointy one. Poignant.
903788940368519169 2017-09-01 01:17:29 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Oy. Aricept time.
903786579549986820 2017-09-01 01:08:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @kylegriffin1 Could this act have been an attempt to obstruct justice as well? Wasn't Rosenstein trying to sanitize trump's motives at that point?
903784776066375680 2017-09-01 01:00:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You can't make your obstruction of justice woes go away with this nonsense. Talk to your atty about resignation for clemency.
903783673031532544 2017-09-01 00:56:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated They're just gussied up haters

903709439936659457 2017-09-01 20:01:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @kaitlancollins This White House can't even victimize innocent people efficiently.
903709104761425920 2017-09-01 20:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Unconstitutional. But okay. I will spend the day praying that you get hauled off in the very near future.
903708197067874304 2017-09-01 19:56:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Spare them. They've been through enough.

903694394892615680 2017-09-01 19:01:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta He's really like a dementing mafioso. Vinny the Chin II.
903693965135925248 2017-09-01 19:00:05 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos The constitution. What ev.
903693712768806912 2017-09-01 18:59:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He thinks he Obama and he hates Obama.
903606725122682880 2017-09-01 13:13:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's too selfish to make that much of an effort on someone's behalf.
903461082047635456 2017-08-31 03:34:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics How cool that this reporter wants an interview and not a huge settlement? The nasty Gianforte should just talk to him.
903460385247948800 2017-08-31 03:31:55 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @jrobeauty Thank you! You too!
903459418800615426 2017-08-31 03:28:05 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @jrobeauty Ok we probably don't agree about politics but I see you like cosmos. Hope you had a good summer of gardening. Take care.
903456209889628160 2017-08-31 03:15:20 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC I was five, faintly remember this. Seemed barbaric.
903455928892219392 2017-08-31 03:14:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Can't blame him.
903451538319970305 2017-08-31 02:56:46 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh give it a rest with this crap. We've got a traitorous lunatic savaging our country. Let the nonsense go.

903446640312410112 2017-08-31 02:37:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax This is just wonderful!!! Fantastic idea! Will pitch in when gofundme is set up. Go you!
903445468201574400 2017-08-31 02:32:39 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @MattMurph24 @RepAdamSchiff Fantastic. Thank you!
903437007384432640 2017-08-31 01:59:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @TiersOfLove I always think of her peeking over the side of trump's crib. May well explain everything.

903427739922944000 2017-08-31 01:22:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Jason_Redacted I don't fight on twitter but hilarious that you see trump as vanquishing "commies." Ever heard of Russia? Ciao dude.
903397570885672960 2017-08-31 23:22:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It's just insane. And then to try to gin him up as a insta-diplomat. No risk of conflicts there.
903397130957717504 2017-08-31 23:20:34 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Wasting money on this crap while Houston drowns. Disgraceful.
903381998722576384 2017-08-31 22:20:27 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Joy joy joy.
903381582953811969 2017-08-31 22:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 I haven't met as many creeps in my 58 years as we have come to know through trump. Like they reproduce by fission.
903381243059896320 2017-08-31 22:17:27 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Like client, like lawyer.

903379684343341056 2017-08-31 22:11:15 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras All hands on deck. Gotta take these bastards down.
903379258575290368 2017-08-31 22:09:33 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan You're just trying to cut taxes for the rich. Stop pretending; everyone knows.
903251588273328129 2017-08-31 13:42:14 UTC <gaughran444> @RealJacobPerry It's a nice golden blur. He likes that.
903227799745548288 2017-08-31 12:07:43 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Spare us the hot air KC. The planet's overheated enough.

903071419633987584 2017-08-30 01:46:19 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @Frank_K_Jr Sure hope so.
903070902019076096 2017-08-30 01:44:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog Can we reflect for a moment on the exquisite joy if New York brought this bastard down? I NY.
903070080472375299 2017-08-30 01:41:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson This will be very challenging. Thank goodness we've got that crack team in the White House.
903069564145205248 2017-08-30 01:38:56 UTC <gaughran444> @leegelernt @ACLU Bravo!!!!
903068591129587712 2017-08-30 01:35:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM @KamalaHarris An expensive disaster in every way.
903068308034998273 2017-08-30 01:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @2020fight @critic_social Really. I'm still blown away by how disgusting he was in Houston. "Look at the size of this crowd!" Just a sick guy.
903065464909246465 2017-08-30 01:22:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @davejorgenson Just saw a thing about pumpkin spice dog biscuits. Make it stop.
903062591970398208 2017-08-30 01:11:14 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @2020fight Although on second thought maybe that was a mercy. They've been through enough.

903055472428814338 2017-08-30 00:42:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That's right. If he's a confidential informant and acts in good faith, govt will recommend a lower sentence for him. But he's got to yak.
903054734407421952 2017-08-30 00:40:01 UTC <gaughran444> @VP You're painfully full of shit. But I guess you'll be better than your wildly deranged boss.
903054443947712512 2017-08-30 00:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Let us pray.

903051465845080064 2017-08-30 00:27:01 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Couldn't agree more. 160 people didn't hang themselves on Marc Rich's watch.

902979127111798784 2017-08-30 19:39:35 UTC <gaughran444> @latinovictoryus As they should be. When the power of the Latino vote is fully realized, the GOP will be in tatters. I can't wait.
902978847330754562 2017-08-30 19:38:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TeviTroy @WSJ "Look at this crowd!"  Seriously?

902954016304455682 2017-08-30 17:59:48 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala This mewling horse's ass. We knew he couldn't handle a crisis, but this is impressive.
902953429051613184 2017-08-30 17:57:28 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller And I can be a power forward for the NBA if I can learn and change.
902930712780840961 2017-08-30 16:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @JoyAnnReid Rare to see someone as smart, sharp and sweet as Joy Reid. Maybe this explains it.
902896922343723008 2017-08-30 14:12:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Watch to the tune of the "Jaws" soundtrack.
902896614959960065 2017-08-30 14:11:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Just stop.
902890440487309312 2017-08-30 13:47:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak @AndrewBeatty Wow. Good for you.
902888060144246784 2017-08-30 13:37:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What heart?
902887357694840837 2017-08-30 13:34:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Let the generals deal with this. You're not well.
902867637230862336 2017-08-30 12:16:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Good for her.
902725507116040193 2017-08-29 02:51:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JulieDiCaro @CharlesPPierce Star Wars. All of them.
902708262021332992 2017-08-29 01:43:15 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing @MalikYoba Yeah, he sure looks like good people.
902707923239010304 2017-08-29 01:41:55 UTC <gaughran444> @votevets Go military dogs!
902707696075493376 2017-08-29 01:41:00 UTC <gaughran444> @RWPUSA Yes he's trashed what was left of his reputation.
902707253937090560 2017-08-29 01:39:15 UTC <gaughran444> @ChristoR20 @critic_social Why can't a single one of these guys spell?
902702361633845248 2017-08-29 01:19:49 UTC <gaughran444> @rezaaslan They are. We're not.
902698768717549568 2017-08-29 01:05:32 UTC <gaughran444> @mennabucket85 @Nysteveo2AOLcom @critic_social Nothing against mall walkers! He just looks like a guy who can't find his wife in Yankee Candles.
902696170862116864 2017-08-29 00:55:13 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris @TinaMcGugan Think I heard him!
902695022797213700 2017-08-29 00:50:39 UTC <gaughran444> @GovChristie @allinwithchris Oh ffs.
902694498299514881 2017-08-29 00:48:34 UTC <gaughran444> @mennabucket85 @Nysteveo2AOLcom @critic_social Yes! And he looks like a dumbass mall walker in that hat.
902692967475011584 2017-08-29 00:42:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @deborahblum @MaryDav20821348 Oh yes!! We will survive him! Amen!
902667549262872576 2017-08-29 23:01:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @deborahblum @MaryDav20821348 No Mary sorry I was being sarcastic. I'm with you. I think trump is destroying our country. But we'll survive him.
902652699572883458 2017-08-29 22:02:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Did you grow up with an army of siblings? Scrappy fellow.
902652346253107200 2017-08-29 22:01:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @DavidAmoyal Not this president. Any other president.
902651216295071745 2017-08-29 21:56:35 UTC <gaughran444> @aliasvaughn @BandvSusan That would be divine. Hatch hammered trump after Charlottesville. Very conservative but better than those others.
902650228767166467 2017-08-29 21:52:39 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien @sunnysingh_n6 I think it looked like a man wearing a tuxedo. Out of touch and weird. Not a gender issue. A relatedness issue. Albeit a small matter.
902649255332122626 2017-08-29 21:48:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @deborahblum America is getting greater by the day.
902648626165506048 2017-08-29 21:46:17 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid How can blinding stupidity and true evil coexist in one man?
902648336313970688 2017-08-29 21:45:08 UTC <gaughran444> @BandvSusan @aliasvaughn Go Orrin! Want to hear this.
902633555649552386 2017-08-29 20:46:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @RogueSNRadvisor Someone should dump a bucket of water on him & see if he melts like the wicked witch of the west.
902632897739411456 2017-08-29 20:43:47 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn This brave guy did just the right thing.  Good for him.
902632590116577285 2017-08-29 20:42:34 UTC <gaughran444> @houstonpolice @PaulBegala Very sad.
902631839088640000 2017-08-29 20:39:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnLeguizamo @latinovictoryus I hope this changes soon.
902631736181448706 2017-08-29 20:39:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 There you go with the persistent sanity again.
902631491871666176 2017-08-29 20:38:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta He sees it as a referendum on himself - the only thing he cares about.
902628351319400450 2017-08-29 20:25:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MotionToStrike @JonTc1 @T_voglio_bene @AClaudeCase You did the right thing. All disclosed was in the public record other than your opinion. I was a usdj clerk long ago - you did good.
902595014575960064 2017-08-29 18:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @funder More of this please. @NYGovCuomo
902587744538558464 2017-08-29 17:44:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @HouseInSession Pence is repulsive in a special way.
902586312011784195 2017-08-29 17:38:40 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @joe_palazzolo If the court refers to the plaintiff as "the misdemeanant" he's probably not going to win.
902585556382736384 2017-08-29 17:35:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Wasn't that a band from the 80's? Oh no, that was Flock of Seagulls.
902577855451848704 2017-08-29 17:05:04 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Send in a psychiatrist.
902574883737128960 2017-08-29 16:53:15 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou How much longer are Americans going to submit to this abuse?
902574648184848386 2017-08-29 16:52:19 UTC <gaughran444> @DNC @NomikiKonst @fawfulfan @neeratanden @JordanChariton @riotwomennn Good for you for speaking up.
902574530643746816 2017-08-29 16:51:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak It's kind of gross when people are going without. $990 for a blouse is preposterous. Five inch heels in a flood zone are foolish.
902573868589703169 2017-08-29 16:49:13 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush @maggieNYT You cannot be serious. Stop looking for the good side of this monster. There isn't one.
902573310273343488 2017-08-29 16:47:00 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama This is true. Immigrants work harder. Are we not supposed to say that?
902536203270062080 2017-08-29 14:19:33 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Humiliating, infuriating and slightly gratifying at the same time. Trump is a man without a coherent thought in his head.
902529502198337536 2017-08-29 13:52:56 UTC <gaughran444> @latinovictoryus @vgescobar He is deeply hostile to the Latino community. He's a stone cold bigot.
902528883169349632 2017-08-29 13:50:28 UTC <gaughran444> @rosannecash Sorry that happened to you. Terrible.
902514369090682880 2017-08-29 12:52:48 UTC <gaughran444> @SeanMcElwee Many many people were outraged by the Civil Rights movement.
902514171501314048 2017-08-29 12:52:01 UTC <gaughran444> @politico This seems like a seriously big deal.
902511831612346368 2017-08-29 12:42:43 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics No. Because he clearly does not.
902510001792720897 2017-08-29 12:35:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @spaynespayne A piece of gum?
902509919848595456 2017-08-29 12:35:07 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 There's something biblical about a false prophet being exposed by an apocalyptic storm.
902508223646892033 2017-08-29 12:28:22 UTC <gaughran444> @IngrahamAngle @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Lame excuse for laziness and incompetence.
902506523208945665 2017-08-29 12:21:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TheLastWord @GovHowardDean @Lawrence Add this to the vast list of things he doesn't know.
902506150838534145 2017-08-29 12:20:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @kylegriffin1 Remember how scared and shocked he looked when he visited Obama in the White House? Like a 5 yr old put behind the wheel of a car.
902505710474465280 2017-08-29 12:18:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You need to work on your ambivalence Claude. How do you really feel?
902499099760570368 2017-08-29 11:52:07 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yeah. A little. Most people have some redeeming feature. Not this guy.
902498757832527872 2017-08-29 11:50:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro What soul?
902498056507203586 2017-08-29 11:47:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated $5 - $10k - nuisance value. Maybe?
902386254528081920 2017-08-28 04:23:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Settle and get on with your life. Your attys can counter offer with a low figure, hondle to the lowest possible amount, & pull the plug.
902376800029986816 2017-08-28 03:46:09 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @HelenKennedy Good campaign slogan for 2020.
902372337001037826 2017-08-28 03:28:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @DennisLittle19 Haha. No, don't worry. I can't forget him for a minute.
902367637098909697 2017-08-28 03:09:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Jim_Bakker @SophieInCT Shameless.
902367028429946880 2017-08-28 03:07:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @DennisLittle19 Yes - he's special. How can he explain himself after this storm?
902366634144407711 2017-08-28 03:05:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @nowthisnews This brave, brave woman.
902362710276530177 2017-08-28 02:50:09 UTC <gaughran444> @CBSNews This aberrant POS.
902361211198636033 2017-08-28 02:44:12 UTC <gaughran444> @politico So put him in another room with gold curtains and a desk. He'll never know the difference.
902360703402639360 2017-08-28 02:42:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Im_TheAntiTrump I can't with the hats. This evil clown.
902359641308483584 2017-08-28 02:37:58 UTC <gaughran444> @Jim_Bakker @SophieInCT Is this the guy who went to jail for ripping people off? F him.
902320454924414982 2017-08-28 00:02:15 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Don't egg on this crackpot for crying out loud. We don't have a normal president. You know that.
902311612660502528 2017-08-28 23:27:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JesseCharlesLee Legally that's a damn helpful thing.
902311418506207237 2017-08-28 23:26:20 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Aren't you engaging in identity politics now?
902307906468663296 2017-08-28 23:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Sorry that happened to you. I was once stuck with Osmond Bros' "One Bad Apple" for six hours. Therapy continues.
902306881007439872 2017-08-28 23:08:19 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Can you say more?
902306564052221952 2017-08-28 23:07:03 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @TheRoot Keep at it, fella!
902306483429412865 2017-08-28 23:06:44 UTC <gaughran444> @KeithOlbermann There's no question that is what he meant. And his voters heard him loud and clear.
902304328962232320 2017-08-28 22:58:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MattressMack @soledadobrien And they'll let you rest without preaching at you.
902304045569908736 2017-08-28 22:57:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics It was disgusting. Or should I say it, too, was disgusting? Hard to keep track with this deeply defective man.
902302675655680000 2017-08-28 22:51:36 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Charles Manson eagerly awaits the answer.
902297552996925440 2017-08-28 22:31:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon They should try it on him.
902297096350564352 2017-08-28 22:29:26 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @bradheath No. That's wrong.
902289454433538050 2017-08-28 21:59:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce A disastrous president and a subpar human being.
902249101391269888 2017-08-28 19:18:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax How very Christian of him.
902186914161283072 2017-08-28 15:11:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @LeftOfMainSt @selectedwisdom Yes. Today.
902171088989368320 2017-08-28 14:08:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @TomPerez @keithellison @tomwatson This is a big mistake. Turning off real Dems.
902165038806568960 2017-08-28 13:44:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU Go get him!!
902164861660094464 2017-08-28 13:43:59 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @TheDemocrats @JenGranholm This dangerous imbecile.
902164722719621120 2017-08-28 13:43:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Seems only fair.
902164564703367168 2017-08-28 13:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @thatgirlxf Rosa Parks sat so Barack Obama could run . . .
902133513348141056 2017-08-28 11:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid A stone cold bigot.
902020044003180544 2017-08-27 04:08:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oy.
902015380662702080 2017-08-27 03:50:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @BobForDinner Okay! Thanks!!
902015259766132736 2017-08-27 03:49:31 UTC <gaughran444> @mmpadellan Wish this storm hadn't happened but we're getting a much needed reminder of the best of America.
902013981606457344 2017-08-27 03:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Who is this delightful fellow?
902010956540252162 2017-08-27 03:32:25 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @TheEconomist When white supremacists look out for white supremacists. Touching.
902009106957049856 2017-08-27 03:25:04 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Yet another terrible idea.
902008170163396608 2017-08-27 03:21:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Sounds like a high school yearbook.
902000104730746880 2017-08-27 02:49:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Longer: pretty fucking awesome.
901999821233545217 2017-08-27 02:48:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Try to contain your excitement. It's unseemly. Look it up.
901999440218742788 2017-08-27 02:46:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila I look at this and see what I think of as the real America. The rest seems like a bad dream. One we have to deal with, of course.
901998646325071872 2017-08-27 02:43:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @grace_lightning A legitimate justice department would investigate this.
901998440560852992 2017-08-27 02:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @christinawilkie Everybody knows Pence is measuring the curtains. Even his deeply stupid boss must know.
901998039652499458 2017-08-27 02:41:05 UTC <gaughran444> @rtraister @lydiadepillis Horrendous.
901996132330549248 2017-08-27 02:33:30 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @TheToddSchulte So why aren't republicans making a peep about this now? Where are they?
901995624119357440 2017-08-27 02:31:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR I can't summon any interest in her at all.
901994636322988032 2017-08-27 02:27:34 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy He can't capitalize on an event that highlights human empathy and compassion because he doesn't have any understanding of it.
901993861995798528 2017-08-27 02:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Very very good idea. Excited to hear that this is a possibility.
901993501730246656 2017-08-27 02:23:03 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum He is numbingly stupid and incurious.
901992393288937472 2017-08-27 02:18:39 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama Great to hear from you President Obama. Miss you so.
901931625122066433 2017-08-27 22:17:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You're taking this health food kick too far.
901928699741732864 2017-08-27 22:05:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated She could buy some shampoo with 2.2 million dollars.
901928410410348545 2017-08-27 22:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @RCDavisUndiano @latinovictoryus @LatinoUSA You make our country better. Stand strong.
901925276959068161 2017-08-27 21:51:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @NicolleDWallace Good but we need more than a handful of republicans to repudiate this threat to our nation. Where are the patriots?
901923419058569216 2017-08-27 21:44:34 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Let's hope he goes for a swim.
901923279027523584 2017-08-27 21:44:01 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Terrible plan. How do they justify this?
901922703816499204 2017-08-27 21:41:44 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Yes. Right now.
901883100233424898 2017-08-27 19:04:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TinaMcGugan @EricBoehlert Ffs.
901882746217357323 2017-08-27 19:02:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Of course they will. As soon as we have a real president again.
901833560105070592 2017-08-27 15:47:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You don't care about crime. You just pardoned a lawless racist, Arpaio. Soon we'll know more about your criminal conduct.
901634007959564288 2017-08-26 02:34:33 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC I remember this. #FeelingAncient
901631549090783232 2017-08-26 02:24:47 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 The worst.
901630161338105856 2017-08-26 02:19:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Haha! Duly noted.
901627900750954496 2017-08-26 02:10:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated NYT v Sullivan. Tough row to hoe.
901626347226845184 2017-08-26 02:04:07 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Sorry Franklin. First amendment says no.
901626079701499904 2017-08-26 02:03:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That's why a lot of people decline to bring defamation cases.
901624892109582337 2017-08-26 01:58:20 UTC <gaughran444> @KevinMKruse @CharlesPPierce Huckabee used to be kind of clever and is now aggressively unfunny. The coach?
901624361932779521 2017-08-26 01:56:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Rich didn't cause 160 people to hang themselves. Not even close.
901555054179758080 2017-08-26 21:20:49 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Tell it Papi!
901554591761879040 2017-08-26 21:18:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Cernovich @JackPosobiec @TrueFactsStated Yes. No New Right or Alt Right for me. It's White Supremacists & Nazis. No sugar coating these bastards.
901551866416443393 2017-08-26 21:08:09 UTC <gaughran444> @mrs @IrisL49 Never.
901550936128192514 2017-08-26 21:04:27 UTC <gaughran444> @waltshaub Oh god.
901496916214730752 2017-08-26 17:29:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated When I get tweets from trump people I try to find something on their profile (e.g. dogs) & connect on that. If too egregious say fu & block
901479568745353217 2017-08-26 16:20:52 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior Good for you. Utter nonsense.
901479397601021954 2017-08-26 16:20:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MrMikeBlake For donald trump and his followers great means white. No other way to look at it.
901478576649904130 2017-08-26 16:16:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MerriamWebster @dog_rates This is Boo.pic.twitter.com/gUExBXyv4s
901475094853283840 2017-08-26 16:03:05 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @oufenix Moral bankruptcy.
901450898618155008 2017-08-26 14:26:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Why don't they let us correct them? All those pearls of wisdom lost . . .
901442242111524864 2017-08-26 13:52:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 I wish he'd get a hobby.
901442055737659392 2017-08-26 13:51:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @DevlinBarrett No. Don't compare financial crimes to the establishment of a concentration camp in the United States of America. Just don't.
901440540276903936 2017-08-26 13:45:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @peterbrack And the greatest threat to donald trump is the rule of law.
901439879544004609 2017-08-26 13:43:09 UTC <gaughran444> @robdelaney Grotesque.
901436447072423938 2017-08-26 13:29:31 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump A lot of our laws and systems are predicated upon an assumption of basic decency. All will have to be reviewed when he is out.
901435652348227586 2017-08-26 13:26:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump 160 people hung themselves in the concentration camp your friend created. Counting the minutes till the law takes you down.
901431957220884481 2017-08-26 13:11:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Not without a lot of honesty and hard work.
901431783878795265 2017-08-26 13:10:59 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes Another low point in American history, brought to us by donald trump.
901431400259301377 2017-08-26 13:09:28 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris @hardball Donald Trump is a stone cold racist. Can't miss it unless you want to.
901430520583794688 2017-08-26 13:05:58 UTC <gaughran444> @politico At least his wife is nice.
901430125702643712 2017-08-26 13:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Can you have a word with them and tell them to speak up? Our country is on fire. What are they waiting for?
901429859183931394 2017-08-26 13:03:20 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien Are they hearing impaired? He announced his candidacy by savaging Mexicans. He was clear as a bell from day one.
901429524587577344 2017-08-26 13:02:01 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Poignant.
901297806689873920 2017-08-25 04:18:37 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate I would like him to go away.
901293499311693824 2017-08-25 04:01:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @JeffFlake Thank you senator jellyfish.
901292691476099072 2017-08-25 03:58:17 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Ardent racists have long despised the federal judiciary.
901283539261550597 2017-08-25 03:21:55 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @PamKeithFL In.
901282256827842562 2017-08-25 03:16:49 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Are you talking about identity politics?
901278924042366980 2017-08-25 03:03:35 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @LeslieProll @SenJohnMcCain Good for you.
901277364142956545 2017-08-25 02:57:23 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good for McCain. The right thing to do.
901276943236116481 2017-08-25 02:55:42 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Does that implicate the availability of a pardon?
901276364334137344 2017-08-25 02:53:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Multi-tasker.
901276183387664388 2017-08-25 02:52:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Rich's pardon didn't involve a pattern of brutality directed at a minority group by a government entity. Arpaio is worse.
901271139116355585 2017-08-25 02:32:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Amazing what a fresh look and some banging lawyers can do! Kick hard!
901266720136024066 2017-08-25 02:15:05 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @LeslieProll Good idea.
901266535292993536 2017-08-25 02:14:21 UTC <gaughran444> @KevinMKruse First things first.
901266297719328768 2017-08-25 02:13:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Clearly the new haircut hasn't dampened your spirits.
901266089400836096 2017-08-25 02:12:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson A fine, twisted mind. Much appreciated.
901265891073163264 2017-08-25 02:11:47 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Barbaric.
901265817156956160 2017-08-25 02:11:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Good laugh on a bad night.
901265734067789824 2017-08-25 02:11:10 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Oh come on. This presidency is more virulent tonight than ever. Give it a rest.
901265385365929985 2017-08-25 02:09:47 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Or enthusiast. Doesn't have the greatest civil rights record himself.
901262513853091842 2017-08-25 01:58:22 UTC <gaughran444> @KeithOlbermann She looks like a sweetheart.
901262215323451396 2017-08-25 01:57:11 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras It gets worse by the second.
901261864675442695 2017-08-25 01:55:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Another army of bigoted frauds.
901261303448301570 2017-08-25 01:53:34 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I think little cracker Sessions would be fine with this.
901260390239268864 2017-08-25 01:49:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're like the Wizard of Oz. A fraudulent functionary. (Look it up). Not a brain in your head. Just a small, racist heart.
901256744172761088 2017-08-25 01:35:27 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @JeffFlake Pathetic wimpy response. If you want to be a renegade, man up.
901256472570593280 2017-08-25 01:34:22 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @tribelaw If only we didn't have an amoral, flaccid congress.
901256143145762816 2017-08-25 01:33:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @NBCPolitics That's a sad, weak reaction. On your feet, Senator.
901255507821940736 2017-08-25 01:30:32 UTC <gaughran444> @walterdellinger If you care about civil rights and the rule of law this is a cataclysm.
901255242649661441 2017-08-25 01:29:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @PreetBharara Much much more.
901254343600590849 2017-08-25 01:25:54 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill Good to hear. And glad he's speaking out now.
901254209013764098 2017-08-25 01:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SebGorka @KeithOlbermann @critic_social Haha. Don't think it's the lighting! Every day is a new set of outrages. Wish Hurricane Harvey could just single him out. Just him.
901253426780282880 2017-08-25 01:22:16 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @nycsouthpaw He needs to say a lot more than that.
901253196621938688 2017-08-25 01:21:21 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill Yes and the repercussions have been felt for decades. But glad to hear anyone denounce trump.
901253006510968832 2017-08-25 01:20:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @MidwinCharles Minimally decent.
901252647147229185 2017-08-25 01:19:10 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Trump takes an expansive view of this right.
901252513667719170 2017-08-25 01:18:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @Zac_Petkanas Yes.  That is one wimpy little conscience.
901252218774581248 2017-08-25 01:17:28 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @New_Narrative Like this Stanton guy a lot. Good for him.
901252091527782400 2017-08-25 01:16:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Just repulsive.
901251842914570240 2017-08-25 01:15:58 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 And yes grave disrespect for the federal judiciary.  Not the first time.
901251722001223682 2017-08-25 01:15:29 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Nice parting shot at Obama. These racist bastards.
901250804916645888 2017-08-25 01:11:50 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill Says the fellow who brought us Justice Clarence Thomas. Boo-hoo.
901250570668867584 2017-08-25 01:10:55 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel I've heard inchworms make more noise.
901250426879782912 2017-08-25 01:10:20 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos What a wimpy statement from flake.
901248974790807553 2017-08-25 01:04:34 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @4everNeverTrump @NCBlake And to aid and abet racism.
901247937979834369 2017-08-25 01:00:27 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Trump is getting closer to Hitler every day.
901247745268305920 2017-08-25 00:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith Exactly. Our goddamned Bull Connor.
901247393357848578 2017-08-25 00:58:17 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @RealSheriffJoe @JuddApatow @realDonaldTrump This debased low-life.
901247138360950785 2017-08-25 00:57:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 People of honor don't work for this thug.
901246847578238976 2017-08-25 00:56:07 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 I wish goddamned trump would get washed out to sea and everyone else would be spared. What a dark night.
901246587736862720 2017-08-25 00:55:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @AKMarkB Yes. Disgusting. Endless assaults on decent people.
901244746412294144 2017-08-25 00:47:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 He's a thug.
901244150124875776 2017-08-25 00:45:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @jorgeramosnews He is the Racist in Chief. No one can touch him.
901243995774496769 2017-08-25 00:44:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 He really is. Motherfucker.
901243718598053888 2017-08-25 00:43:41 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou It's just grotesque.
901243456789639172 2017-08-25 00:42:39 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Really.
901243311696084994 2017-08-25 00:42:04 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Whew.
901243263558053890 2017-08-25 00:41:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean What??
901242981491126274 2017-08-25 00:40:45 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Clearly inapplicable to remorseless thug arpaio.
901238078777556992 2017-08-25 00:21:16 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Slap in the face to immigrants, the legal system and basic decency.
901237610684829700 2017-08-25 00:19:25 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Open season on POC. Couldn't be more clear.
901236970285928448 2017-08-25 00:16:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber This disgusting, morally bankrupt man. Couldn't be more clear: it's open season on POC. The rule of law means nothing. For now.
901222667407282176 2017-08-25 23:20:02 UTC <gaughran444> @KeeganNYC Grotesque even for this obscene bigot.
901222459306856454 2017-08-25 23:19:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Those poor people.
901218291791917056 2017-08-25 23:02:39 UTC <gaughran444> @politico What do they do, add pictures?
901217157949923329 2017-08-25 22:58:08 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Clearly he himself can take a lot.
901217018149560320 2017-08-25 22:57:35 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw Great judge.
901216872632287233 2017-08-25 22:57:00 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Thanks for the laughs, Newt. Much needed in these grim times.
901208367695310850 2017-08-25 22:23:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @EricBoehlert Most of us have ancestors who would be illegal by today's standards. Most 19th c immigrants got in if they weren't sick.
901207845689077764 2017-08-25 22:21:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sing to the tune of "Climb Every Mountain" from "The Sound of Music."
901207323523371013 2017-08-25 22:19:04 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @JaxAlemany This is insulting.
901207227213762561 2017-08-25 22:18:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @thehill That's more like it.
901206765114720257 2017-08-25 22:16:51 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @RonBrownstein Let's pray they vote.
901204469978988544 2017-08-25 22:07:43 UTC <gaughran444> @justinjm1 This is what we've come to.
901203892779745282 2017-08-25 22:05:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MazMHussain That's right. They were okay with Nazis who hated POC too. That's how trump got elected.
901203088337498114 2017-08-25 22:02:14 UTC <gaughran444> @CraigSBPA @newtgingrich Hahaha. You fresh-faced thing you.
901202861102690309 2017-08-25 22:01:20 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT It's really violent. And there's a lot of snow. The male lead is good. Meh.
901195847836291072 2017-08-25 21:33:28 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @ItsKey_70sbaby Yes he said "good luck."
901181474820542464 2017-08-25 20:36:21 UTC <gaughran444> @funder @joncoopertweets I like our chances just fine.
901179411986354176 2017-08-25 20:28:09 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin At least he didn't say "sucks being you."
901178782643625985 2017-08-25 20:25:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax It's meant as a simple explanation of a more complicated set of principles. Your job: think of how these principles can apply to real life.
901177587904524288 2017-08-25 20:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Also another example of his weird disconnection from human beings. Like "too bad" when marines killed. Strong emotions reserved for himself
901177121569165312 2017-08-25 20:19:03 UTC <gaughran444> @JuliaEAinsley @PeteWilliamsNBC @JaneGrader @NBCNews This destructive bigot. Terrible for the kids involved, terrible for the county.
901176186549788674 2017-08-25 20:15:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Teen pregnancies at a new low at end of Obama presidency. These "pro-life" hypocrites will fix that.
901175445567287297 2017-08-25 20:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT Grotesque that it's even an issue.
901175317494194181 2017-08-25 20:11:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Eyes on the prize.

901144792817643524 2017-08-25 18:10:35 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @kylegriffin1 I should hope not.
901116692335603712 2017-08-25 16:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck The fish dements from the head.
901093192946393089 2017-08-25 14:45:33 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Jobs, jobs, jobs. Too bad these plans can't be renamed "not the black guy's plan" and maintained. People benefit.

901084872181248000 2017-08-25 14:12:29 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Anyone else find her boring?
901062687874048000 2017-08-25 12:44:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Very good point. Trump is the logical extension of years of republican misconduct.
901061951844962305 2017-08-25 12:41:24 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Why do I think if they're ignored they'll go away?
901061643051962368 2017-08-25 12:40:11 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good. Hopefully at some point they'll turn on him.
901061523912740865 2017-08-25 12:39:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Well he has done more to divide and enrage the country than any president in my lifetime. It's impressive.
901061238960115712 2017-08-25 12:38:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDreifuerst Job growth is actually declining, but hopefully will continue. I'm not a grandma but have grown up kids. Must be the best. Take care.

900904688903528448 2017-08-24 02:16:30 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt Great. Two sanctimonious, hard right phonies. But at least neither is seriously unhinged.
900904413291831297 2017-08-24 02:15:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC It's not only okay, it's our patriotic duty.

900888534856458240 2017-08-24 01:12:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This can't be a serious question. He's clearly an imbecile.
900861157157855233 2017-08-24 23:23:31 UTC <gaughran444> @tclary1687 @AUkeibro I hope I never happen upon a situation like this. Will definitely end up in jail.

900846633759502336 2017-08-24 22:25:49 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes or at least VP? Kane was a mistake.
900846300618526730 2017-08-24 22:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JebBush @TheRickWilson Instead we've got the chaos president.
900845033284399106 2017-08-24 22:19:27 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw Wish she'd been there when I went. Would have been cool. Was a bit more staid back then.

900825488406585344 2017-08-24 21:01:47 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos @Newsweek Thanks kids!
900825165260615680 2017-08-24 21:00:30 UTC <gaughran444> @RubenGallego Trump announced his candidacy by attacking POC. Most white people didn't care. And so here we are today.
900824647775789056 2017-08-24 20:58:27 UTC <gaughran444> @politico What would this termagant know about what Dems want?

900819650845560832 2017-08-24 20:38:35 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @NormOrnstein If MSNBC wants to give time to conservatives, why not a show for Rick Wilson? Would get huge ratings and be high quality.
900818969472454657 2017-08-24 20:35:53 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @CharlesPPierce What a gentle and polite way to put it.

900739312546959360 2017-08-24 15:19:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Stop this nonsense.
900739086834708481 2017-08-24 15:18:27 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Okay this is shading into obstruction territory, at least to show his intent.
900738083037040640 2017-08-24 15:14:28 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill Okay so Corker and Speier. Everyone knows he's off his nut. Any other patriots out there with at least one vertebra?
900725164425576448 2017-08-24 14:23:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Slightly comforting to see her looking like she's about to expire.
900720654445629440 2017-08-24 14:05:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @USoulSurvivor Wow. Wish this had been broadcast when it came out.

900718469196509190 2017-08-24 13:56:32 UTC <gaughran444> @sturdyAlex Oh joy!!!
900717666687750145 2017-08-24 13:53:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold Palm Beach sounds like a gleaming, sunny hell.
900717349875134464 2017-08-24 13:52:05 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths Consider posting more pictures of your son. Times are tough we need the smiles.

900707313530658816 2017-08-24 13:12:12 UTC <gaughran444> @LambdaLegal Go get him!
900704051368775681 2017-08-24 12:59:14 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JerryTravone You pathetic wretch. Endlessly obsessed with your superior.
900702868679913472 2017-08-24 12:54:32 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Cut a deal to resign in exchange clemency. Get psychiatric help. And it's spelled "there" you poor wretch.
900700896367128576 2017-08-24 12:46:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @Eugene_Scott @kpmel Absolutely. It's always been there, trump just fanned the flames. Now it's a wildfire.
900698802079891456 2017-08-24 12:38:23 UTC <gaughran444> @News12WC Love this. And beautiful garden.
900695265501487104 2017-08-24 12:24:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I get a lot of these. What are they?
900695152104288256 2017-08-24 12:23:53 UTC <gaughran444> @MotherJones @RWPUSA This is a horrible story.
900692891290533888 2017-08-24 12:14:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Decades ago had a racy dream about Gerald Ford. Still in therapy.
900691873408454657 2017-08-24 12:10:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Just hope no tax dollars are going towards this brilliant analysis.
900571417623879680 2017-08-23 04:12:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Happy bday to you!
900571279878750209 2017-08-23 04:11:39 UTC <gaughran444> @aholdenj Yes. He's also pretty dumb.
900566739758567424 2017-08-23 03:53:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Birther bullshit.
900566396425383936 2017-08-23 03:52:15 UTC <gaughran444> @fordm You must get a dog.
900557813113552896 2017-08-23 03:18:08 UTC <gaughran444> @Carrasquillo @MattMurph24 @BuzzFeedBen It's a disgraceful idea. Animated by bigotry, indifference to human suffering and contempt for the rule of law.
900550406698409984 2017-08-23 02:48:43 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths He probably can cause ulcers and migraine headaches. Gotta give him his due.
900548129036087296 2017-08-23 02:39:39 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @BazziNYU Yuck.
900547758129647616 2017-08-23 02:38:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @Eugene_Scott This should surprise no one. Stone cold racists supporting the Racist in Chief.
900546587109318657 2017-08-23 02:33:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Take a moment and read this thread. Well worth your time.
900543933972918272 2017-08-23 02:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MtnMD Oh no.
900543387249541120 2017-08-23 02:20:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Right. That's enough. Sickening.
900542585437126657 2017-08-23 02:17:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @NyleDiMarco Thanks for doing this critical work.
900541614015336448 2017-08-23 02:13:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Is this really coming from him?

900540775473311744 2017-08-23 02:10:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Angry draft dodger.
900540610444230658 2017-08-23 02:09:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @AriBerman This is why we need a federal judiciary.
900539900960833536 2017-08-23 02:06:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax This is great. Let's hear more from you, please.
900538302192914432 2017-08-23 02:00:37 UTC <gaughran444> @woodruffbets Keep at it, Alan. So far, so good.
900538075641769986 2017-08-23 01:59:43 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill How dare this draft-dodging slug attack those brave enough to serve?
900521974711156736 2017-08-23 00:55:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow @thehill Oh ffs.
900520654579130370 2017-08-23 00:50:29 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Disgraceful.
900519144386437122 2017-08-23 00:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Great appearance on Chris Hayes.
900518907668287488 2017-08-23 00:43:33 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Where does the savior Kelly stand on this?
900453302130937856 2017-08-23 20:22:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A very primitive man leading very primitive people. Thug life.
900452715947589633 2017-08-23 20:20:31 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Very few have faith in you. Get a decent lawyer and cut a deal. Resignation for clemency.
900447177117487104 2017-08-23 19:58:31 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @TheHoustonAstro Celtics fans suck. They have for decades.
900433449521213443 2017-08-23 19:03:58 UTC <gaughran444> @alfonslopeztena He's a tough, scary guy. Let him protect himself.
900432915552763906 2017-08-23 19:01:50 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost I like everything about this.
900432729984180226 2017-08-23 19:01:06 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama No I think we can assume that they're dangerous cretins.
900432535108415488 2017-08-23 19:00:20 UTC <gaughran444> @ULoveDeAndrea Go you!
900431089075970048 2017-08-23 18:54:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @TheRickyDavila But unlike Joe you didn't help him get elected.
900430769117683712 2017-08-23 18:53:19 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Was huckabee always this much of a schmuck? Knew he was conservative but thought he used to be kind of clever.
900414626340495360 2017-08-23 17:49:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You were clearly in the throes of a breakdown and the crowd markedly thinned by the end. Get a decent lawyer and cut deal to resign.
900405250330431493 2017-08-23 17:11:55 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean I wish you would lead the dnc again. So smart, practical and focused. Always glad to hear from you.
900405088908439552 2017-08-23 17:11:16 UTC <gaughran444> @kaitlancollins Outrageous. Among the worst things this piece of garbage president will do. Although it's hard to choose.
900404545116917760 2017-08-23 17:09:06 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou I think when he's gone we will be sifting through this disaster for decades, and blame will be assigned. Right now need to remove him.
900371906016059393 2017-08-23 14:59:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MeghanMcCain I'm a democrat and think this is despicable. All the best to you and your dad.
900369816086818816 2017-08-23 14:51:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You were widely perceived as mentally ill. Get a decent lawyer and negotiate immunity for your resignation. Spare the country and yourself.
900369471751282688 2017-08-23 14:49:44 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls You work for a dangerous lunatic. You have nothing to offer. Be quiet.
900369012105916418 2017-08-23 14:47:55 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Just speak for yourself. Man up and do something about the insane president. You'll be a national hero.
900368405965881344 2017-08-23 14:45:30 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @RoqPlanas Amen. That's why we have a federal judiciary.
900368231227117569 2017-08-23 14:44:49 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Just acknowledge that the president is out of his mind and describe what you're going to do about it. Nothing else matters.
900331275474661376 2017-08-23 12:17:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AJentleson What senses?
900325784975441920 2017-08-23 11:56:09 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw His animus towards minorities seems sincere.
900204761529581568 2017-08-22 03:55:14 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @politico How marvelous. Life without Newt.
900203054796025857 2017-08-22 03:48:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @mckaycoppins @JuddLegum It should be but the fact that he's mentally ill adds a great urgency to getting him out of the White House.
900202589031198721 2017-08-22 03:46:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Wow. He's been repellant for decades but this is impressive.
900198346203201542 2017-08-22 03:29:45 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Which means what?
900198158306856962 2017-08-22 03:29:00 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Surprised it doesn't say "The Blacks for Trump"
900197601110364161 2017-08-22 03:26:47 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias @chrislhayes Mofo is still talking? Brutal. And you have to listen bc of your job. Hang in there.
900196680280178688 2017-08-22 03:23:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @lulu_says2 Thanks!!
900187729031462912 2017-08-22 02:47:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's always the victim. Whiny bitch.
900186608946819072 2017-08-22 02:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Same. Can only read about what he says. His voice makes my ears bleed.
900178682161004544 2017-08-22 02:11:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Long live the resistance.
900173110078578690 2017-08-22 01:49:28 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @SarahLerner Next, an in-depth look at the political views of paramecium.
900172314645606401 2017-08-22 01:46:18 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos This is disgraceful. And I hope he gets a lovely cat very soon.
900170375438508034 2017-08-22 01:38:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson And what happens if someone starts shooting?
900169618194616320 2017-08-22 01:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He's going on the lam.
900169051367985152 2017-08-22 01:33:20 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden No. He's the first in our lifetimes. I don't know who might have posed such a threat in the past. Trump is a thug.
900167534028218369 2017-08-22 01:27:19 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden It really is. President of the United States. What a horror show.
900166503777153029 2017-08-22 01:23:13 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix This should be the job of the police.
900165039306493953 2017-08-22 01:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Oh ffs.
900163903111483393 2017-08-22 01:12:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Nicole_Cliffe @TMMcMillan If you know where that guy lives now, just pass it along. We'll deal with it.
900160874467520513 2017-08-22 01:00:51 UTC <gaughran444> @USNavy @realDonaldTrump Thank you Bonespur Boy. Thank you.
900157414103801856 2017-08-22 00:47:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Bonespur Boy has gotten so brave in his golden years.
900153180587261952 2017-08-22 00:30:16 UTC <gaughran444> @erinscafe Best throw down ever.
900152799220117505 2017-08-22 00:28:46 UTC <gaughran444> @Ange_Amene Yes. That "unity" tour was a real mistake.
900152241948151810 2017-08-22 00:26:33 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou God no. Ryan is a moral cipher with damaging ideas.
900144328399519748 2017-08-22 23:55:06 UTC <gaughran444> @tonyschwartz @4everNeverTrump I'm hoping he'll leave a searing impression on the electorate of how important it is to vote.
900143936102117377 2017-08-22 23:53:32 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @imillhiser He also swore he'd make Obama a one term president and proceeded to grind congress to a halt.
900143469406105600 2017-08-22 23:51:41 UTC <gaughran444> @GavinNewsom Go you! Very important.
900140197207318528 2017-08-22 23:38:41 UTC <gaughran444> @RedTRaccoon You can run away too. Don't get hurt.
900140054290599936 2017-08-22 23:38:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @RobsonConLaw Good.
900127423731310594 2017-08-22 22:47:56 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden What else can he do? Start speaking in tongues?
900125380270534657 2017-08-22 22:39:48 UTC <gaughran444> @repjohnlewis @benwikler @AriBerman Did he really? Shameless.
900123747717447680 2017-08-22 22:33:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TheSWPrincess @AZ_Indivisible @gbmnyc @DeepInTheHills @MrScottLads @Lily_v_Shtupp @borrellisusan1 Yes be careful. Worried about protestors.
900123133973286914 2017-08-22 22:30:53 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta @businessinsider Master negotiator. LBJ reincarnated.
900118955825737728 2017-08-22 22:14:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @IenareI He's not.
900118599049900033 2017-08-22 22:12:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA I love Republican cage fights.
900117180595015681 2017-08-22 22:07:13 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LuckydancinGuy True. That may very well be syphilis-ridden brain.
900115995855126529 2017-08-22 22:02:31 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @LuckydancinGuy Avoiding STDs was his "Vietnam!" Quite a guy!
900115724013887490 2017-08-22 22:01:26 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Which genius came up with this idea? Sounds like the ever helpful Patrick Lynch.
900114869084618752 2017-08-22 21:58:02 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics That's funny. I didn't hear him say a goddamned thing.
900114728156094464 2017-08-22 21:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Dirt off your shoulder Jake. You were great with Ryan.
900114318074707968 2017-08-22 21:55:51 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @Deggans Everything trump can do O could do better. Everything.
900113634071891968 2017-08-22 21:53:08 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews He's smarter than he looks, right?
900112638520303616 2017-08-22 21:49:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Bonespur Boy, you move me.
900108953597751296 2017-08-22 21:34:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Good. It's about time that vile tortoise made a contribution.
900106027672231937 2017-08-22 21:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TreyYingst @BrianKarem Sounds promising.
899992896719507456 2017-08-22 13:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @danecover1 Mine too! Shelter dogs are the best. Enjoy her!
899975842868101120 2017-08-22 12:45:36 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @danecover1 Ok we probably don't see eye to eye on politics but I think you're dog is so cute. I have a mutt part beagle great dog!
899971706143600641 2017-08-22 12:29:10 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I hope he makes a break for it and is never seen again.
899971532411326464 2017-08-22 12:28:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB Horrible.
899971071578968064 2017-08-22 12:26:38 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Bonespur Boy, you move me.
899970728975634433 2017-08-22 12:25:17 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ Wait. Doesn't monkeynuts own that?
899968292730933248 2017-08-22 12:15:36 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @Khanoisseur Surely there's a cabinet position for her.
899968119552307200 2017-08-22 12:14:54 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta How I wish I could get stuck on an elevator with her. Sounds lovely.
899967766891048961 2017-08-22 12:13:30 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol What a deeply poor choice of words.
899964570931998720 2017-08-22 12:00:48 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Invertebrate.
899963958077124609 2017-08-22 11:58:22 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce They should have given him a cookie while he saw the photo to reinforce positive feelings.
899963105857458176 2017-08-22 11:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @maggieNYT @DavidWright_CNN A great statesman.
899840926419484672 2017-08-21 03:49:29 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics No he did not condemn it. He said trump "messed up."  He minimized it.
899838526744911873 2017-08-21 03:39:57 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC @andEps I think he was referring not only to trump's racism - which is clearly not historically unique - but to the public response to it.
899837380722659328 2017-08-21 03:35:24 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC @andEps Anyway no need to argue with me but Beschloss is a terrific historian. Perhaps you are as well. Take care.
899837167513612288 2017-08-21 03:34:33 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC @andEps For the first 150years of American history very few people gave a damn about the concept of racism.
899836728122454016 2017-08-21 03:32:48 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden He had an hour where he wasn't foaming at the mouth. Is that momentum?
899835451196006400 2017-08-21 03:27:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Claire_Phipps I'd have to agree with him. Not saying much.
899835143766069248 2017-08-21 03:26:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Obama blocked out the sun today, too. Little devil.
899834748301967360 2017-08-21 03:24:56 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC @andEps You're saying this to Michael Beschloss? Seriously?
899832281073946625 2017-08-21 03:15:08 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @ReginaPatton20 Miracle. I remembered something!
899831050758750208 2017-08-21 03:10:15 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Insane and dumb. Super combination.
899828945830457344 2017-08-21 03:01:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @ReginaPatton20 Remember that. But think there was also misuse of campaign funds and a trial about it.
899825309347926017 2017-08-21 02:47:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 It's really disgusting.
899824731666493440 2017-08-21 02:45:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 These guys have spams of dignity and then revert to the same old crap.
899823751952572416 2017-08-21 02:41:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Forgetting someone's birthday is messing up. Embracing Nazis is deadly serious, and this little punk is trying to trivialize it.
899822619054288898 2017-08-21 02:36:44 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Don't think so. Didn't John Edwards get in trouble for something similar?
899821916080529408 2017-08-21 02:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> This weasel. Calling trump out for cozying up to Nazis is a "partisan food fight"? He's trivializing a very serious issue. Amoral punk.
899819578066432000 2017-08-21 02:24:39 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Gutsy position.
899813871615184896 2017-08-21 02:01:59 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Wow. Impressively repulsive.
899813219379949568 2017-08-21 01:59:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics That's something little Ryan should know all about.
899812718521221120 2017-08-21 01:57:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This little con artist.
899810770963365888 2017-08-21 01:49:40 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveEder @EricLiptonNYT We will fight to win. Tough guy.
899810642701561856 2017-08-21 01:49:09 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @BradMossEsq Mmmmmm.
899809276440571908 2017-08-21 01:43:43 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Bingo.
899809046055854080 2017-08-21 01:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @marcorubio Oh Marco. Go back to the Bible.
899807644369727488 2017-08-21 01:37:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson The power should automatically cut off if a president does that.
899807105108119553 2017-08-21 01:35:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Better than ringing endorsements of Nazis. Mission accomplished.
899806954884825092 2017-08-21 01:34:30 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Almost as if he didn't care.
899806885402030080 2017-08-21 01:34:13 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Tell 'em, Bonespur Boy.
899806722298187776 2017-08-21 01:33:34 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer You with the pesky details.
899806629041975297 2017-08-21 01:33:12 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Novel idea! Thanks!
899805741925761024 2017-08-21 01:29:41 UTC <gaughran444> @EarnKnowledge Love this child.
899805252454625280 2017-08-21 01:27:44 UTC <gaughran444> @funder And they're an ally of the US.
899804810660204545 2017-08-21 01:25:59 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Who wrote this crap? Sounds like a power ranger movie. From the guy who says "too bad" when marines go missing.
899804077617446912 2017-08-21 01:23:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson It's an ill wind that blows no good.
899803424941907968 2017-08-21 01:20:28 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer If they do they won't admit it, right?
899803297736826880 2017-08-21 01:19:58 UTC <gaughran444> @samstein He's such a crafty devil.
899803163770798081 2017-08-21 01:19:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum His handlers just wanted him to speak into a mic about something other than good nazis. He has nothing to say.
899802910732808192 2017-08-21 01:18:26 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Joke? A new president trump?
899801321431343104 2017-08-21 01:12:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hahaha! Great image.
899797314310688768 2017-08-21 00:56:11 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR @ZooMaster76 Which would exclude the fellow speaking tonight.
899797092234924032 2017-08-21 00:55:18 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Oh come on. This is the guy who says "that's too bad" when informed of missing marines. He says nothing of lost soldiers. He doesn't care.
899796587173617664 2017-08-21 00:53:18 UTC <gaughran444> @RubenGallego Maybe someone suggested he get in front of some cameras as soon as possible and endorse something other than Nazis.
899795627550420992 2017-08-21 00:49:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If only he could literally fall into that abyss.
899792227265691648 2017-08-21 00:35:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Isn't that gratifying? You can't fool all the people all of the time.
899791925984858113 2017-08-21 00:34:47 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I hope he lives out his days as a broken, bitter man. And his dumbass wife smiling & nodding while trump praised Nazis. Couple from hell.
899790898699042816 2017-08-21 00:30:42 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper You mean the part where no one believes a word he says? Could have some effect.
899790627050803200 2017-08-21 00:29:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @GetWisdomDude @AUkeibro Joy to the world.
899790520481984512 2017-08-21 00:29:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Amen. Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin Ta F Wit.
899789795047735297 2017-08-21 00:26:19 UTC <gaughran444> @Ange_Amene I'm with you.
899789367748829185 2017-08-21 00:24:37 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I thought of you when I saw it. Maybe the dawn of a new age? Maybe he pulled too much shit this time? I hope he's finished.
899789083274125312 2017-08-21 00:23:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @AUkeibro @GetWisdomDude Voting of course is more important but I would not say polls mean nothing.
899786976135610368 2017-08-21 00:15:07 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @selectedwisdom I hate when that happens.
899786581464272901 2017-08-21 00:13:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Thanks, but one interlude of eerie darkness is enough for one day.
899786199400939520 2017-08-21 00:12:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Did you see he's got an 18% approval rating in Kentucky?
899781874490408960 2017-08-21 23:54:50 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @Chris_Meloni Absolutely love this.
899778502098001920 2017-08-21 23:41:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Girding his minuscule loins.
899772727598358529 2017-08-21 23:18:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @ShaunKing How is this possible? That poor child.
899772443509891072 2017-08-21 23:17:22 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Chastised turtle.
899771939266347008 2017-08-21 23:15:21 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich Thanks for the tip, draft dodger.
899771405931352065 2017-08-21 23:13:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @Morning_Joe Embarrassed is such a bland word. How about mortified? Scalded by humiliation? Ruing the day one was born?
899740830923190272 2017-08-21 21:11:45 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel The really white blues brothers.
899739825493954561 2017-08-21 21:07:45 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Was this before he wandered into traffic? God help us.
899626328957358080 2017-08-21 13:36:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB Hail to the Chief.
899626111080034306 2017-08-21 13:35:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare I'm so glad you're here.
899623294164508674 2017-08-21 13:24:42 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou This is the guy who said avoiding venereal disease was "his Vietnam." Draft dodger who doesn't care about people who serve.
899622203163111424 2017-08-21 13:20:22 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule @JoshuaGrubbsPhD What heart?
899619938071179264 2017-08-21 13:11:22 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur This is disastrous.
899618377467121664 2017-08-21 13:05:09 UTC <gaughran444> @RubenGallego @davidfrum This vulgar, profligate, damaging Marie Antoinette.
899618075644964864 2017-08-21 13:03:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes So it's coke? Is that the deal with this guy?
899611786537820160 2017-08-21 12:38:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I've blown through the seven stages of grief. Want him out yesterday.
899500669895364609 2017-08-20 05:17:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump you never wanted this job and now you're losing your marbles. Cut a deal for immunity you'll feel better. #TrumpResign
899491213224669184 2017-08-20 04:39:51 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT @FoxNews Astute observation.
899490280117858304 2017-08-20 04:36:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 Wonderful. Thanks.
899487958054522880 2017-08-20 04:26:55 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @TrueFactsStated Here's the answer: he's dangerously unstable and not fit for office. His brain is a lava lamp. It's a real problem.
899487246230982660 2017-08-20 04:24:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 I think he will but amen about voting instead of bitching! How can I watch your show?
899485921988444160 2017-08-20 04:18:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like a lovely vacation. It was restful for us too, between threats of a nuclear holocaust and the Nazi endorsement. Thanks chief!
899349145001091072 2017-08-20 19:15:19 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Ok then. Later, Jerry. Much.
899343944940744704 2017-08-20 18:54:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @carlyvwest Haha! Thanks very much!
899343727050846208 2017-08-20 18:53:48 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill @kylegriffin1 A rhetorical question but should be asked.
899338435625963520 2017-08-20 18:32:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Whatever gave you the idea that they're concerned about racism?
899334705094569984 2017-08-20 18:17:57 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Poignant.
899334486638415872 2017-08-20 18:17:05 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Is this true? Well then fuck him. Never thought he was funny either.
899333135527272448 2017-08-20 18:11:42 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @AynRandPaulRyan More of this please.
899332123139743745 2017-08-20 18:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @richardmoore73 Bon appetit!
899331368735440898 2017-08-20 18:04:41 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @HipHopDX Love this.
899330925531680768 2017-08-20 18:02:56 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @WSJPolitics Wow. Anti-slavery. Gutsy move.
899279080624934912 2017-08-20 14:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes & we're getting a very poor return on this investment.
899276917454536705 2017-08-20 14:28:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is a breath-taking moment in American history. Will take years to understand how this happened.
899276611568140288 2017-08-20 14:27:06 UTC <gaughran444> @QuesinberryJo @AUkeibro I miss David Bowie so much. Loved him.
899275813257924608 2017-08-20 14:23:56 UTC <gaughran444> @splcenter All the more reason to get rid of them.
899275349812543488 2017-08-20 14:22:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Good for you. Well said.
899275061739347969 2017-08-20 14:20:57 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Never. Say buck up or stay sick.
899127551070793729 2017-08-19 04:34:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MeghanMcCain All the best to you & your Dad.
899119159782539269 2017-08-19 04:01:27 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Cheer up, pal. Some people don't make it that far.
899108236825169920 2017-08-19 03:18:02 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris @hardball Band of cowards.
899106978684915712 2017-08-19 03:13:02 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @GMA What an amazing young man. I wish him all the best in his medical career and in his life.
899093916733108224 2017-08-19 02:21:08 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy She is shameless and ridiculous. Look forward to her absence from public life.
899093427886981124 2017-08-19 02:19:12 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy How can he hold his head up?
899092487901511682 2017-08-19 02:15:28 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH @BostonGlobe Go Boston! Well done!
899091712714395649 2017-08-19 02:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko She's remarkable.
899091561316745216 2017-08-19 02:11:47 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Yes, but do they usually break out into cage fights like this one?
899023485921636353 2017-08-19 21:41:16 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Props to Boston. Sox & Celtics suck.
899023256677756933 2017-08-19 21:40:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It seemed like such a good idea at the time.
899020573560492032 2017-08-19 21:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @BrendaVitucci Sorry patriot. It's true.
899020126325846017 2017-08-19 21:27:55 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen You make a point. Busy fellow.
899019612632866816 2017-08-19 21:25:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @RTKash @stchar1201 Love this!
899018148166479872 2017-08-19 21:20:04 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @BrendaVitucci That's terrible. Truly. At least your guys got a cool little rotunda.
899017853776543744 2017-08-19 21:18:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @RTKash @stchar1201 Great. Go you! Glad it went well.
899017748281401344 2017-08-19 21:18:28 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews Go you! Thanks.
899017421104726016 2017-08-19 21:17:10 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @BrendaVitucci Okay okay.  Good luck to you.
899016950210207746 2017-08-19 21:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @PAM_SEZ That's what I thought. Sigh.
899016792336515073 2017-08-19 21:14:40 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @BrendaVitucci Hahaha! Guess you don't understand that both sides of issues are protected by 1st amendment, not just your side.
899015479007862784 2017-08-19 21:09:27 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @RTKash Not arguing with you just trying to understand. Are there a significant # of violent protestors?
899014959828541441 2017-08-19 21:07:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @AdrienneMahsa Just love this. He looks so scared and disoriented.
899014391731027968 2017-08-19 21:05:08 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews @RTKash Of course.  But aren't they a small exception?
899014058975698944 2017-08-19 21:03:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Why a picture of a black woman? You found one, congratulations. But seriously?
899013679546544130 2017-08-19 21:02:18 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs @BuzzFeedNews There you go. Bravo Boston.
899013445105922048 2017-08-19 21:01:22 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @CBSNews Just curious - was this a huge, largely peaceful protest? If so, why isn't that the lead story?
899010029835223042 2017-08-19 20:47:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes the Repubs in government are the most lily-livered people ever.  An army of cowards.
899009609901518849 2017-08-19 20:46:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump We were more unified and happy under Obama because he's better than you in every way. Smarter, more accomplished, way better looking . . .
899006307138588672 2017-08-19 20:33:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JoyAnnReid @LaurenWern Are they crowded into this little rotunda? Hilarious.
899005977843970048 2017-08-19 20:31:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MayoClinic @jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain All the best to you Senator.
899001270106820608 2017-08-19 20:13:00 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce BPD tweeted people were throwing rocks at them on Tremont. If not true that should be refuted. Protestors shouldn't be smeared.
899000353986760704 2017-08-19 20:09:21 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta They are shameless. And somehow infuriating and deeply boring at the same time. It takes a certain talent .  . .
898998938824351744 2017-08-19 20:03:44 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @bostonpolice @JohnMAGAMiller1 You & I probably disagree on many things but this is not okay. Not right.
898997977431162880 2017-08-19 19:59:55 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @bostonpolice By whom?
898996171162607616 2017-08-19 19:52:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Shoot first ask questions later.
898993875544530944 2017-08-19 19:43:37 UTC <gaughran444> @marty_walsh @realDonaldTrump Not in the mood fool. Bye.
898991925323333634 2017-08-19 19:35:52 UTC <gaughran444> @marty_walsh @realDonaldTrump I have police in my family. They detest you.
898991729663066112 2017-08-19 19:35:05 UTC <gaughran444> @marty_walsh @realDonaldTrump You pathetic half-wit. Your Mom's-basement-dwelling fans were massively outnumbered by real Americans of all ethnicities.
898991067726589953 2017-08-19 19:32:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your pathetic fans have been grossly outnumbered. Just like the country at large.
898990534408187904 2017-08-19 19:30:20 UTC <gaughran444> @RWPUSA Amen!
898990045809459200 2017-08-19 19:28:24 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @JohnJHarwood Yes. He will wet his Depends and head for the hills when he sees what they've got on him. Will seek immunity for resignation.
898989338230390784 2017-08-19 19:25:35 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF Congratulations!
898988712062853120 2017-08-19 19:23:06 UTC <gaughran444> @KaivanShroff I  Boston.
898988506630017026 2017-08-19 19:22:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Oooohh. An ugly divorce. Good.
898977176992624640 2017-08-19 18:37:15 UTC <gaughran444> @paul_lander Malevolent dorks unite.
898906650089840640 2017-08-19 13:57:00 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @kylegriffin1 Regular Americans would like this investigated as well.
898906267045023744 2017-08-19 13:55:29 UTC <gaughran444> @emily_kaiser @TrueFactsStated Love this one.
898904463620149253 2017-08-19 13:48:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I'm going to have to work hard on this one. Not there yet.
898904271869157376 2017-08-19 13:47:33 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Amen. A lot of the south feels like this.
898903553430913025 2017-08-19 13:44:42 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Giving him a bath? How could you?
898895003635908608 2017-08-19 13:10:44 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Just add the WH and we're in business.
898873653072449536 2017-08-19 11:45:53 UTC <gaughran444> @adr I love this.
898872997628583936 2017-08-19 11:43:17 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw The great Justice Jackson.
898868857724477440 2017-08-19 11:26:50 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta Admirable sense of duty.
898750382247211010 2017-08-18 03:36:03 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush He looks like a dumb guy trying to look tough. Imagine that.
898742737700126720 2017-08-18 03:05:41 UTC <gaughran444> @VeraMBergen Multiple circles of hell.
898708938434195456 2017-08-18 00:51:22 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Colorful in a super white kind of way.
898706045534691328 2017-08-18 00:39:53 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta @nytimes This is horrifying. This good man.
898705518361018368 2017-08-18 00:37:47 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 @david_tanenhaus Brilliant.
898705422022062080 2017-08-18 00:37:24 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Absolutely. An historic low.
898705012208971776 2017-08-18 00:35:46 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 The best people. The best times.
898704853089878016 2017-08-18 00:35:08 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama He just can't quit Obama. Obsessed with his superior predecessor.
898703760393814016 2017-08-18 00:30:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TheCounterTV @JKH2 a
898702026762199040 2017-08-18 00:23:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Nice. Better weather on the way.
898701906842968064 2017-08-18 00:23:26 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt And further disempowers some of the most vulnerable people in our country.
898701621907120129 2017-08-18 00:22:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Poignant.
898701530966241281 2017-08-18 00:21:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Nice white men in power porn. Get a decent lawyer and cut a deal to resign in exchange for immunity.
898674309794676736 2017-08-18 22:33:46 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Go Kevin.
898656562834685952 2017-08-18 21:23:15 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer @mattyglesias Exactly. Trump has been an out and proud racist for decades.
898621420086980609 2017-08-18 19:03:36 UTC <gaughran444> @20committee @jynersorebelone Damn!
898596341177122818 2017-08-18 17:23:57 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing @cjoyner Good. I hope there's an arrest soon.
898595854952550401 2017-08-18 17:22:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @yashar Feels kind of mobbish.
898595671904722944 2017-08-18 17:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @JoyAnnReid Exactly.
898567939460345859 2017-08-18 15:31:06 UTC <gaughran444> @GuardianUS @ColumbiaLaw Well done!
898567567199129606 2017-08-18 15:29:37 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC You just can't quit him, can you? Wtf?
898567464421908480 2017-08-18 15:29:12 UTC <gaughran444> @ScottAdamsSays @newtgingrich Aren't you supposed to shove off to the Vatican soon? Bet the Pope hates you.
898552129325060096 2017-08-18 14:28:16 UTC <gaughran444> @southernshade @TheRickWilson Go Mom.
898551887812808704 2017-08-18 14:27:18 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Oh, you with that factual stuff.
898551771177635840 2017-08-18 14:26:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Like any sentence that includes farrago and bullshit.
898550403121508353 2017-08-18 14:21:25 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Except she's white so he'll probably back off.
898550175953825792 2017-08-18 14:20:30 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio We know who you're talking about but you need to man up and say his name. Join Corker and call on him to resign.
898537330822217728 2017-08-18 13:29:28 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @Neil_Irwin @JohnJHarwood @Alan_Krueger I think trump has no credibility as to what will help race relations.
898536761378426884 2017-08-18 13:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Had the same thought. Open carry laws permit this??
898536142722695169 2017-08-18 13:24:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Good for her. This brave woman.
898535678094581760 2017-08-18 13:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Who t f do these people think they are?
898526790255333376 2017-08-18 12:47:35 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The biggest threat to our country resides in the White House. Cut a deal for immunity and resign.
898401627689762816 2017-08-17 04:30:14 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias @samdman95 Exactly right. It ruffles feathers. Heaven forbid.
898393591373897728 2017-08-17 03:58:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Shocking. He seemed like such a good guy.
898393417520107524 2017-08-17 03:57:36 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Yes. What an incredible woman.
898392669063266306 2017-08-17 03:54:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @Mediaite Fuck this guy and the Russian horse he road in on.
898391756605149184 2017-08-17 03:51:00 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien He is a racist.
898391225769877504 2017-08-17 03:48:54 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @kylegriffin1 Bonespur Boy is very brave in the war against women.
898388953174163456 2017-08-17 03:39:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No worries.
898388832969687040 2017-08-17 03:39:23 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @leftyjennyc So so sick of it. They've clearly inflicted more pain than they feel. Enough already.
898303556788273156 2017-08-17 22:00:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Absolutely agree. Horrible loss of life. But trump has put his racist cards on the table. And seems deranged. Can't go back.
898302379006799873 2017-08-17 21:55:51 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 Yes. You're right.
898301338429267968 2017-08-17 21:51:43 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 Anyone still questioning this is probably uneasy about his/her own racial attitudes. Trump's been an out and proud racist for decades.
898299706303930368 2017-08-17 21:45:14 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule Brown people attacking white people get a quick response. That's what he assumes happened.
898299183832064000 2017-08-17 21:43:09 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP Your boss is tweeting about pigs' blood. Coordination?
898298789370499075 2017-08-17 21:41:35 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @RawStory Hahaha. Jailhouse brawl.
898296181293555713 2017-08-17 21:31:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Well, yeah. He would.
898295423357431808 2017-08-17 21:28:13 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Certainly by dawn. Dead man with principles walking.
898295060315418624 2017-08-17 21:26:46 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum It's true. The outrages are so fast & furious you can't keep track.
898294596471406592 2017-08-17 21:24:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @Gus_802 Yes!
898294467270025217 2017-08-17 21:24:25 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian The wheels are coming off this clown car.
898294378380361728 2017-08-17 21:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> @yashar What???
898294303159496705 2017-08-17 21:23:46 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @deg2 @KaivanShroff Repulsive even from this primitive fool.
898293985667465216 2017-08-17 21:22:30 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @Marianhouk This was a low point in NYC history. Trump of course responded with energetic racism.
898293305150021632 2017-08-17 21:19:48 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Excellent. Good for ACS!!
898292960936120322 2017-08-17 21:18:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @deg2 Say??? This is a fact not an interpretation.
898292774965051392 2017-08-17 21:17:41 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @CBSNews Good man! A patriot at last!
898292618697859072 2017-08-17 21:17:04 UTC <gaughran444> @mkh531 Hallelujah! A crack in the wall of GOP indifference?
898292249754251264 2017-08-17 21:15:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Damn wish I could. Have fun!
898280700712857600 2017-08-17 20:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sorry you're having a total nervous breakdown. You didn't really want this job. Get a decent lawyer and cut a deal to resign for immunity.
898227926759608325 2017-08-17 17:00:00 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien Good for you. I'm white and I'm sick of white people.
898227544138317824 2017-08-17 16:58:29 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @foxandfriends Say his name.
898227356648779776 2017-08-17 16:57:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen The smarter, more beloved, happier, more competent, more accomplished, better looking black guy. It kills him.
898226898127527938 2017-08-17 16:55:55 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I so hope so. Our country needs to redeem itself from this plunge into indecency.
898224984434388993 2017-08-17 16:48:19 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Don't think so. The sense of propriety among scotus justices is not what it used to be.
898217282144530433 2017-08-17 16:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated In.
898176597299257345 2017-08-17 13:36:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnKasich @WillieGeist Get in there John. There's a severe decency deficit in the GOP.
898175988948926465 2017-08-17 13:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Hope so. Maybe he'll cough up his sense of honor. Seems to have gone missing.
898175613391040516 2017-08-17 13:32:08 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Sick s.o.b.
898159648179671040 2017-08-17 12:28:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Good times. Good times.
898159279714308096 2017-08-17 12:27:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @JaneGrader Trying to clean up my act a bit.
898159010423164928 2017-08-17 12:26:09 UTC <gaughran444> @EJDionne @ThePlumLineGS Good piece. "Birtherism was a first step towards Charlottesville."
898157149171351552 2017-08-17 12:18:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson How can a smart, principled man like you bear to stay in this party?
898155495051186176 2017-08-17 12:12:11 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Many people voted for him for that very reason.
898150593260376064 2017-08-17 11:52:42 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Don't forget golf.
898150219338133504 2017-08-17 11:51:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson But will they? The seem so flaccid.
898148326117441536 2017-08-17 11:43:42 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro You misunderstood them. Apparently they're not people of conscience.
898148091437748225 2017-08-17 11:42:46 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Robert Mueller has met his match. This guy sounds like a legal genius.
898146293264130049 2017-08-17 11:35:37 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 He appears to be a morning person.
898145610469056512 2017-08-17 11:32:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood I hope so.
898144997396148224 2017-08-17 11:30:28 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @brianklaas Thanks for the pick-me-up.
898144096472248320 2017-08-17 11:26:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You twisted wretch. We heard you.
898141632519962624 2017-08-17 11:17:06 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Congress.
898023774204956672 2017-08-16 03:28:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MerriamWebster No. No.
898022762677239813 2017-08-16 03:24:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamsFlaFan @MrDane1982 @schwelo I know what you mean. Good.
898017709774045184 2017-08-16 03:04:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @AdamsFlaFan They have footage of this poor child being attacked. How could no one have been arrested yet?
898013024921038848 2017-08-16 02:46:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I believe you. The woman-shover with four kids. This will have to be a small subplot in the movie. What a crew.
898011990165266437 2017-08-16 02:41:57 UTC <gaughran444> @PopovichKerr Ah, the good old days.
898010844587536384 2017-08-16 02:37:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Or lewandowski? My head hurts.
898010646276521984 2017-08-16 02:36:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Wait. Trump is in love? Come on. With someone other than himself?
898010286589857792 2017-08-16 02:35:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Well you called that one. Crickets.
898008277388115968 2017-08-16 02:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @rita_washko Seems to work as an anaesthetic.
898007850512986112 2017-08-16 02:25:30 UTC <gaughran444> @mmmm1026 @TrueFactsStated I'm hopping on one foot like after a swim to get this out of my head.
898007521901907968 2017-08-16 02:24:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hope he never hit her. Thuggish guy.
897998738995728385 2017-08-16 01:49:18 UTC <gaughran444> @politico How about never? Does never work for you?
897998336401211397 2017-08-16 01:47:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated She's pretty. Does she really . . . with trump? How? Why?
897997648619343872 2017-08-16 01:44:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JaneGrader You should! Would be so cool to meet Claude in person.
897997390858375169 2017-08-16 01:43:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Ah. Nice!
897993579192123392 2017-08-16 01:28:47 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @tribelaw No kidding. We already made our national statement condemning the Nazis. It was called World War II.
897992655073927169 2017-08-16 01:25:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Havana?
897982950813421569 2017-08-16 00:46:33 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP He's a substandard person who cares only about himself.
897981152862011392 2017-08-16 00:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller He's the client from hell. Won't follow advice and won't pay his bills.
897979992847638529 2017-08-16 00:34:48 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Very tired of it. We send money and they bitch about us.
897978011336790018 2017-08-16 00:26:56 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Good. I hope Dowd assists in trump's ruin.
897977554094698496 2017-08-16 00:25:07 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 Is it navet or blinding opportunism?
897963716708323330 2017-08-16 23:30:08 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @USArmy These are patriots. In contrast to the vermin that descended on Charlottesville.
897963344497430529 2017-08-16 23:28:39 UTC <gaughran444> @jules_su @traceygaughran You're better than me. This makes me laugh.
897953632976461825 2017-08-16 22:50:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @blumes15 I know!
897950930888515584 2017-08-16 22:39:19 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Forgot about this guy. What a statesman.
897947688930377729 2017-08-16 22:26:26 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson That's right. They think it's excess baggage, a diversion from what they care about. Civil rights are not identity politics.
897947495199789057 2017-08-16 22:25:40 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill Really? This man is garbage.
897944426814873603 2017-08-16 22:13:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro The self-pity of these racist bastards - seemingly to a person - is mindblowing.  Brutal victims.
897944093480939520 2017-08-16 22:12:09 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Some people are so brave it's breathtaking.
897943709450293248 2017-08-16 22:10:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Good point. Mr. Call It Like I See It. The party is a sea of jellyfish.
897943543422922752 2017-08-16 22:09:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Weasel, it's time to call out your racist leader by name. Stop with the games.
897942359563837441 2017-08-16 22:05:16 UTC <gaughran444> @Rolling_Podium Agree 100%.
897942192416804864 2017-08-16 22:04:36 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @thehill And which ones will condemn him? By name? A party of jellyfish.
897941084776448000 2017-08-16 22:00:12 UTC <gaughran444> @vicenews @AynRandPaulRyan I'm going to have to watch this again and again. Hilarious.
897939394031570944 2017-08-16 21:53:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Claude I don't know if he's lost self-control. I think he was more coherent - in his Nazi views - than other times. This is  the real trump
897938511399067650 2017-08-16 21:49:58 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich Oh Newt. You never had too much dignity but now . . . It's not pretty.
897913864024707078 2017-08-16 20:12:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryAnn_Mullen Sent you a pm.
897868386952151040 2017-08-16 17:11:19 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Why stunned? He has been an out and proud bigot for decades.
897868214511841280 2017-08-16 17:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @CNBC @JaneGrader @AliVelshi Poignant.
897867982608752640 2017-08-16 17:09:43 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @CarolEvansWM Endlessly. She actively helped trump get elected.
897867759413014528 2017-08-16 17:08:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 They certainly were. Virulent racists.
897866525956341761 2017-08-16 17:03:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryAnn_Mullen Sure. Tried to send you a pm but didn't work. Can you send me one & I'll respond? Running around right now but can later.
897863684265058306 2017-08-16 16:52:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Imagine what this poor little fellow has observed.
897863557211095040 2017-08-16 16:52:08 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing I can't either. Who did this?
897861820022697985 2017-08-16 16:45:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Yes he is. Some of them are "fine people."
897857865964109824 2017-08-16 16:29:31 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Heartbreaking and beyond impressive. This woman.
897851103689232384 2017-08-16 16:02:39 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Yes that too should have disqualified him for office.
897850907928481792 2017-08-16 16:01:52 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta This mother is an extraordinary person.
897850620916494340 2017-08-16 16:00:43 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen But a watched pot never boils.
897850309661405184 2017-08-16 15:59:29 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing @YousefMunayyer How helpful. Maybe he should focus on his dad's legal problems.
897802823815090176 2017-08-16 12:50:48 UTC <gaughran444> @NaphiSoc @AUkeibro That's what I think. And GOP will have to deal with the racism infecting their party. Yesterday was an historic moment, a big reveal.
897666264361046016 2017-08-15 03:48:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 He should run for governor of Ohio. Seriously.
897659110585499649 2017-08-15 03:19:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson But at least Jan Brewer hit it out of the park.
897658781282295808 2017-08-15 03:18:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelZaite That occurred to me. Back on his home turf.
897657670160850944 2017-08-15 03:14:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Darling baby.
897656657773252610 2017-08-15 03:09:59 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @critic_social That's right. I feel no pity for him. Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas. In this case fleas wearing little white hoods.
897653391819767808 2017-08-15 02:57:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 That was fun. Not a fair fight.
897651449588527105 2017-08-15 02:49:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Keep remembering her scowling and pointing at Obama.
897651234114605056 2017-08-15 02:48:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yes. But I wish she'd say that Repubs should impeach him.
897649946765271041 2017-08-15 02:43:19 UTC <gaughran444> Oh damn. Jan Brewer. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane meets Sheriff Arpaio.
897647020382539776 2017-08-15 02:31:41 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @MMFlint Why so shaken Chuck? Was today really such a surprise?
897646447780384769 2017-08-15 02:29:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile What kind of human being would join donald trump's WH staff? Nothing good there.
897646038156226561 2017-08-15 02:27:47 UTC <gaughran444> President's staff "stunned and disheartened." Oh bullshit. Trump's been an out and proud racist for decades.
897637371444957185 2017-08-15 01:53:21 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Seriously?
897637276523560960 2017-08-15 01:52:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @mattyglesias He's been an out and proud racist for decades.
897636985346691072 2017-08-15 01:51:49 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @JoyAnnReid Morally bankrupt turtle.
897635916151390209 2017-08-15 01:47:34 UTC <gaughran444> Steve Schmidt is the man.
897634504449433601 2017-08-15 01:41:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis There's plenty of shame to go around. Our country elected this craven POS. People said "give him a chance." Rampant cowardice.
897633863643668480 2017-08-15 01:39:24 UTC <gaughran444> @blumes15 Totally agree that this is who he is. 100%. He's been a devoted racist for decades. I just think he's also dementing and insane.
897632984903417856 2017-08-15 01:35:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @NaphiSoc Yes he is but today was a "good" day for him. Clear as a bell and meant every word he said. Wholly consistent with who he is.
897631081343614976 2017-08-15 01:28:21 UTC <gaughran444> @blumes15 I think he's got it all - dumb, crazy and increasingly senile. But even people with Alzheimer's have good days, and today was his.
897628960691040256 2017-08-15 01:19:56 UTC <gaughran444> @blumes15 I think he's crazy and at times cognitively challenged. But tonight the synapses were firing. This was the real guy. Stone cold racist.
897625443062435846 2017-08-15 01:05:57 UTC <gaughran444> This "trump went rogue" stuff is a false narrative. He seemed more coherent today than usual. This is what he thinks, and what MAGA means.
897618504098213892 2017-08-15 00:38:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Leave. All the good republicans should step off the deck of this morally bereft, sinking ship. Start anew.
897617749853261825 2017-08-15 00:35:23 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw I wouldn't assume he knows what the Jim Crow era was.
897615354519793664 2017-08-15 00:25:52 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Proceed at your peril, republicans.
897612094622846977 2017-08-15 00:12:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @BillKristol @AriMelber No need for depression.  It's time for honesty and action. The grand wizard in the White House has got to go.
897611798748299268 2017-08-15 00:11:44 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Right. And they'll scramble to cover their morally indifferent asses. Hypocrites.
897611292558729216 2017-08-15 00:09:43 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Absolutely. No neo, no alt-right. Let's be forthright. Nazis and white supremacists. Led by a Nazi sympathizer and white supremacist.
897610580223291392 2017-08-15 00:06:53 UTC <gaughran444> @jk_rowling Exactly. Exactly.
897609536663674880 2017-08-15 00:02:44 UTC <gaughran444> @funder They always knew. They just closed their eyes because they wanted power. And didn't give a damn how they got it.
897609372255301632 2017-08-15 00:02:05 UTC <gaughran444> @kristindonnelly @NBCNightlyNews Lie down with dogs, General.
897598473264148483 2017-08-15 23:18:47 UTC <gaughran444> @donlemon Yes he did. A rare moment of truth. Believe him.
897592715537518593 2017-08-15 22:55:54 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey Does the GOP have leaders? Remember some from long ago. We'll now find out who, if anyone, can lead.
897592019232727040 2017-08-15 22:53:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Unless you're wielding a tiki torch or a swastika flag.
897591656400211969 2017-08-15 22:51:41 UTC <gaughran444> @donlemon @JoyAnnReid He's a stand up guy.
897591405073362945 2017-08-15 22:50:42 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @AGSchneiderman Haul his ass in Eric. Please.
897591245744328704 2017-08-15 22:50:04 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @KeithOlbermann Ryan enabled trump. Over and over and over. Can't change the facts.
897590825487650817 2017-08-15 22:48:23 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump How dare they.
897590693668978688 2017-08-15 22:47:52 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Profiles in courage.
897536326618144768 2017-08-15 19:11:50 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Now we're talking.
897529885563830272 2017-08-15 18:46:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Nate_Cohn Are we sure they think?
897529704969900032 2017-08-15 18:45:31 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveCarey5 @Wwm_Shakespeare Cool! Thank you so much!
897527461847732224 2017-08-15 18:36:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare @SteveCarey5 Don't recognize it. What play is it from?
897458874583830529 2017-08-15 14:04:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Wwm_Shakespeare Really? He wrote this?
897456272643166208 2017-08-15 13:53:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Damn. You're like flypaper for these hotheads.
897452138879565825 2017-08-15 13:37:18 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Not to mention his mental health. #25thAmendmentNow
897449422426066945 2017-08-15 13:26:30 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn #25thAmendmentNow
897448756668280833 2017-08-15 13:23:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Yeah. Sometimes I feel like his reign of terror wouldn't have happened if he didn't have a micro penis.
897444979458658304 2017-08-15 13:08:51 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Trump laid is cards on the table as a stone cold bigot with that speech. It was an Hitlerian opening salvo & clear as day.
897443198162931712 2017-08-15 13:01:46 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths Ooooohhh! Adorable!
897439795277950977 2017-08-15 12:48:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This enraged, defective man. He's as angry as the country is angry at him. There's no depth to which he won't sink.
897439085056446464 2017-08-15 12:45:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 First smile of the day.
897438774795304960 2017-08-15 12:44:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko This is real??
897438663671508992 2017-08-15 12:43:45 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Hope it hits the 20's and the rats start swan diving off the ship.
897302500604338177 2017-08-14 03:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @20committee Local law forbids removal of statues without the approval of the local historical society. Would probably not happen.
897292990590459906 2017-08-14 03:04:54 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Our Lunatic in Chief will start braying that it was because of his threats.
897290353027559424 2017-08-14 02:54:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @SophieInCT @bbcstories The banality of evil. "He was wonderful to write for!"
897289347585761280 2017-08-14 02:50:25 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy The nexus of faint moral pangs and strong fears of losing business. And they're off!
897284540846055424 2017-08-14 02:31:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @BeschlossDC Omg! Loved him.
897283469092556800 2017-08-14 02:27:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Probably not a very strong reader either.
897282945425297409 2017-08-14 02:24:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @PiedmontMAHole Yes. Hideous.
897280918100078592 2017-08-14 02:16:56 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Ffs. Highly relevant.
897280337503543297 2017-08-14 02:14:37 UTC <gaughran444> @politico This is not a dog whistle. This is a clarion call to white supremacists far and wide. Arpaio is a vicious enemy of diversity in the US.
897279482213617664 2017-08-14 02:11:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yes he did. Welfare queen, etc.
897265618394562560 2017-08-14 01:16:08 UTC <gaughran444> @mikiebarb @JonLemire He doesn't belong in NYC. Or America.
897265441067995136 2017-08-14 01:15:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen And it was not. It was begrudging, resentful and insincere. Because he is a stone cold racist and he knows who his base is.
897264999407734784 2017-08-14 01:13:40 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @NYDailyNews He looked like a hostage. And was brimming with rage when he was finished.
897264716560687104 2017-08-14 01:12:33 UTC <gaughran444> Rachel Maddow recounting the recent surge in white supremacists' violence towards POC. It is devastating. And our current DOJ is defunct.
897259215076466688 2017-08-14 00:50:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics All this son of a bitch does is try - inadequately - to clean up his own messes. He's really got to go.
897253721557618689 2017-08-14 00:28:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @brhodes Exactly. He's been clear as a bell for decades.
897253559405867009 2017-08-14 00:28:13 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good. Trump should be a pariah.
897245188833374212 2017-08-14 23:54:57 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich FDR would have viewed you with absolute contempt. And you know it.
897244411117137921 2017-08-14 23:51:52 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Never.
897244070929674242 2017-08-14 23:50:31 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @girlsreallyrule NYC detests Trump. Has for decades. Now more than ever.
897229344648593409 2017-08-14 22:52:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I'm sorry nonwhite trump supporters need some world class therapy. #stockholmsyndrome

897084175748132864 2017-08-14 13:15:09 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel This.
897083815520292865 2017-08-14 13:13:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Maybe they don't displease him.
896935968523079680 2017-08-13 03:26:13 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @JesseRodriguez Yes he cashiered his reputation by sucking up to trump. Too bad, but that was his choice. The man who taunted disabled people.
896935230736564224 2017-08-13 03:23:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @kylegriffin1 Time to download some Bruno Mars.
896933140119392256 2017-08-13 03:14:59 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @blakehounshell Would love to see trump/bannon hash it out in a cage fight.
896932444267438080 2017-08-13 03:12:13 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Oh no. Who are these warped bastards?
896931645198041089 2017-08-13 03:09:03 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Much needed laugh. Thank you. And I think it would work.
896927509719248902 2017-08-13 02:52:37 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta Dear god you're demanding.

896926866262634496 2017-08-13 02:50:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I wish you could go. You deserve to be there.
896924431699894274 2017-08-13 02:40:23 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost I would never beg this son of a bitch for anything. He is the Racist in Chief. Why should he denounce his core beliefs?
896923355047178240 2017-08-13 02:36:06 UTC <gaughran444> @kurteichenwald A bankrupt soul.
896922780599427073 2017-08-13 02:33:49 UTC <gaughran444> @owillis Yes, for a pathologically dishonest guy he really put his cards on the table. Was crystal clear about his racism from day one.
896916984297926656 2017-08-13 02:10:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thanks be to God. His total ineptitude is his only saving grace.
896914926073151496 2017-08-13 02:02:36 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 @IChotiner Woodrow Wilson was a dedicated racist, like trump, but unlike him he had a functioning brain.
896914039292309504 2017-08-13 01:59:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum NYC detests trump.
896859251678654464 2017-08-13 22:21:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @laurenduca Social experiment?? Arguably the holocaust was a social experiment. Ffs.
896858911994773504 2017-08-13 22:20:02 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @MontePooleNBCS Exactly. These people put him in the White House. They're in it together.
896858730024849408 2017-08-13 22:19:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @splcenter If you're not outraged at this point, you're either a white supremacist or in a deep coma.
896857816107016192 2017-08-13 22:15:40 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien They're his base. Can't tick off the base.
896857487151955969 2017-08-13 22:14:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @spencerwoodman Atrocious. And goes perfectly with yesterday's savagery. White supremacy as far as the eye can see.
896853388536709120 2017-08-13 21:58:05 UTC <gaughran444> They should. I hope they do.
896853317212672000 2017-08-13 21:57:48 UTC <gaughran444> @jdawsey1 @politico Well, August has been good fun.
896853141865541634 2017-08-13 21:57:06 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Good. Go get 'em. I'll retweet any of these motherfuckers.
896852204258308096 2017-08-13 21:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think there will be. If nothing else, we can now call this administration what they are: white supremacists.

896729841566986240 2017-08-13 13:47:09 UTC <gaughran444> @LambdaLegal Precisely.
896726930409623552 2017-08-13 13:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JeffreyToobin Absolutely wonderful idea.
896726694647746560 2017-08-13 13:34:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's been a stone cold racist for decades. Check out his attacks on the Central Park 5 before and after they were exonerated.
896726364233052160 2017-08-13 13:33:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @mayatcontreras Cowards and collaborators.
896726206896275457 2017-08-13 13:32:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. They are his base, they are his people. They need to be driven back into their confederate flag-festooned caves.
896725000648105984 2017-08-13 13:27:55 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali All these guys see themselves as victims. It's amazing.
896724521033617408 2017-08-13 13:26:00 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Which heart would that be?
896567410588872705 2017-08-12 03:01:42 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis @thehill Why not thumbs up?
896567121274171395 2017-08-12 03:00:33 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis @AndrewKirell Johnny Cash wouldn't have given him the time of day.
896566644235005952 2017-08-12 02:58:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @GStephanopoulos Please. We've all been through enough.
896566417620914177 2017-08-12 02:57:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel I'll bet the other prisoners were afraid of him in jail.
896565478684073984 2017-08-12 02:54:02 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @MJGerson How small? Mexicans are rapists?
896564957915033600 2017-08-12 02:51:57 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @SethAbramson Melt them down and turn them into boot scrapers.
896564348864393217 2017-08-12 02:49:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @RyanLizza And the competition is stiff.
896563634020732929 2017-08-12 02:46:42 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT This family does not mess with their base.
896563488944009216 2017-08-12 02:46:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NationofChange @JulianCastro @zdroberts Oh no.
896560772029059072 2017-08-12 02:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @rafael7770 Good.
896556928863752192 2017-08-12 02:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @westindian93 Thanks!
896556894327853056 2017-08-12 02:19:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Harryslaststand @rosannecash Thank you.
896506243770048512 2017-08-12 22:58:39 UTC <gaughran444> @toddbryant5 Yes we had a different administration then.
896501244742651905 2017-08-12 22:38:47 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Because he doesn't.
896500635993911298 2017-08-12 22:36:22 UTC <gaughran444> And the driver of the car would be dead.
896500173853122561 2017-08-12 22:34:32 UTC <gaughran444> @rafael7770 If the republicans don't want these people they're going to have to make that crystal clear. Repeatedly.
896496822696456192 2017-08-12 22:21:13 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman No acute observation necessary. There was a bright flashing line between "Mexicans are rapists" and today. An inevitability.
896496033877852160 2017-08-12 22:18:05 UTC <gaughran444> @senorrinhatch Senator I rarely agree with you but this is the second strong statement you've put out about this and I thank you.
896493792408330240 2017-08-12 22:09:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Ditch that party Ana. This is their base.
896493540418637825 2017-08-12 22:08:10 UTC <gaughran444> If a POC or Muslim had driven into the Nazi parade in Charlottesville today, we'd be under martial law by now. #Charlottesville #TrumpsBase
896491922839150592 2017-08-12 22:01:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Rick is the man.
896491768862003200 2017-08-12 22:01:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Just right.
896491454511677440 2017-08-12 21:59:53 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala He can't offend his base. It's not a screw up.
896491010146148353 2017-08-12 21:58:07 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn No. The family of the person killed today should sue him for this. Probably not a viable claim, barred by immunity, but maybe try.
896489719445561344 2017-08-12 21:52:59 UTC <gaughran444> @funder And king of the birthers, and accuser of Central Park 5 after exoneration. Stone cold racist.
896489369590222850 2017-08-12 21:51:36 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 She'd slap them down like the vermin they are.
896489051041222657 2017-08-12 21:50:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Right. And are we done with identity politics?
896488226948567042 2017-08-12 21:47:03 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @marcorubio You're saying the right thing. Seriously. Now keep going and disassociate from this terrible president. Be brave. You can do it.
896462900109471744 2017-08-12 20:06:25 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Yes we can. That was pure bullshit from day one. MAGA meant make America white again and everyone damn well knows it.
896462289636917249 2017-08-12 20:03:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen He can't speak, he can't think, but he knows who his base is. And he will never piss those crackers off.
896461775012417540 2017-08-12 20:01:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @RubenGallego Well, he's a leader of white nationalists. Those are his people.
896461626991407104 2017-08-12 20:01:21 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller That's it. Can't piss off the base.
896461484003389440 2017-08-12 20:00:47 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy If he digs too deep he'll find sympathy for them.
896461255266914304 2017-08-12 19:59:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Can you manage to directly address the racism that caused today and that prevents a strong, clear response from POTUS?
896460906472898562 2017-08-12 19:58:30 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Many sides? Which sides would those be?
896460270381522946 2017-08-12 19:55:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Thank you. Right on the money.
896459910640267265 2017-08-12 19:54:32 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @justinsink Of course. Can't alienate his base.
896456423835672577 2017-08-12 19:40:41 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Thank you. This comes from the top. And this is trump's base. Front and center. Nothing fringe about it.
896456056464957442 2017-08-12 19:39:13 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Has this faux pious POS said a word about Charlottesville?
896455498446372866 2017-08-12 19:37:00 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT This should not be minimized in any way. It's the inevitable result of a devotedly racist administration. Nothing fringe or tiny about it.
896453833752268800 2017-08-12 19:30:23 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @marcorubio Come on Senator. This is not a fringe. This is what trump has wrought and you know it.
896453514762866690 2017-08-12 19:29:07 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahThyre Maybe he'll send out Miller to calm things down.
896452598697521152 2017-08-12 19:25:29 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt But you know he won't be. That's his base. They work in his White House.
896452270988173312 2017-08-12 19:24:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @joshdcapps See you're a Kamala Harris trasher. Adios.
896451891068055552 2017-08-12 19:22:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @katiepack Agree. Nazis, KKK. Alt-right sounds like a NYC parking rule.
896451528973840384 2017-08-12 19:21:14 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @JoeHeim That's what pro-white means.
896450663286161408 2017-08-12 19:17:48 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Hold on. Isn't this just identity politics? Are we to take our eyes off Wall Street and single payer healthcare, aka the real issues?
896450363259314176 2017-08-12 19:16:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @SenSchumer He will not condemn his base.
896450233768529920 2017-08-12 19:16:05 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta They are his base. He won't do it. May make some begrudging statements but no full-throated condemnation.
896447453016330240 2017-08-12 19:05:02 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @RWPUSA Yes. Melt them down and turn them into boot scrapers.
896446570794799104 2017-08-12 19:01:32 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Charlottesville spelled like this.
896446344994463744 2017-08-12 19:00:38 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Good clear statement.
896446187728982016 2017-08-12 19:00:00 UTC <gaughran444> @samdman95 @tomperriello Where is law enforcement?
896445294677721088 2017-08-12 18:56:28 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @HaroldItz This has to be made clear so the gravity of this horror is fully understood. What trump had wrought.
896444635521929216 2017-08-12 18:53:50 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill I don't know the facts as well as I should. If the scope of this is unprecedented that has to be made crystal clear.
896444268176445440 2017-08-12 18:52:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Charmin @Bakari_Sellers Too little way too late.
896444098923692032 2017-08-12 18:51:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @ernestine_12 They're economically anxious. And they feel disrespected. Exactly like the first Nazis.
896443874628874242 2017-08-12 18:50:49 UTC <gaughran444> @NPRinskeep Bless this man.
896443444603883521 2017-08-12 18:49:06 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom They're not so fucking fragile. They just ran people over with a car.
896439740068753408 2017-08-12 18:34:23 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm @JesseFFerguson White supremacists are his base. He will never say it. They made him possible.
896439363244089344 2017-08-12 18:32:53 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @aprilnicole82 Has he said anything? Talking about Wall Street?
896438673838944256 2017-08-12 18:30:09 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson That's what it means and trump voters know it.
896438533656915968 2017-08-12 18:29:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 Animals are better.
896438218555633665 2017-08-12 18:28:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile @letsgomathias Of course. Lowlifes.
896436408856006657 2017-08-12 18:21:09 UTC <gaughran444> @GilTPolitics @JoeHeim No limousines from D.C.?
896436151732637696 2017-08-12 18:20:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That's exactly right. Who couldn't have seen this coming the day he announced his presidency by viciously attacking Mexicans? Inevitable.
896435638140055552 2017-08-12 18:18:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Noticed. He doesn't want to alienate white supremacists, a.k.a. The Base.
896433405138804736 2017-08-12 18:09:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Aka, the base.
896423463082233860 2017-08-12 17:29:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Litapi1 Yes now the fellow who unleashed it cranked out a little text.
896420142334324736 2017-08-12 17:16:31 UTC <gaughran444> @rosannecash @Harryslaststand My father was a WWII vet. Glad he missed this.
896419671578116097 2017-08-12 17:14:39 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahThyre I agree. Yes they look like fools but this geyser of racism and hate should not be minimized. Meanwhile our government is silent.
896419285811294208 2017-08-12 17:13:07 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @letsgomathias Of course they are. Beneath contempt.
896418960681336832 2017-08-12 17:11:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 All she condemned was violence. Not a peep about white supremacy. Whomever wrote it for her forgot that part.
896418468832182272 2017-08-12 17:09:52 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller He'd be tweeting and calling for a military solution.
896418283884339200 2017-08-12 17:09:08 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt Yes this is the goal. MAGA means Make America White Again. Always did.
896417779045343233 2017-08-12 17:07:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If they fail to condemn this they are complicit. There's no middle ground here.
896415165205368832 2017-08-12 16:56:44 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Thanks very much. So clear and so appreciated.
896411936132395008 2017-08-12 16:43:54 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good.
896410067725160449 2017-08-12 16:36:29 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Right. But if you encourage and abet white supremacists you can't just confine them to going after brown people. Tough break.
896409147322884096 2017-08-12 16:32:49 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @4everNeverTrump He has abetted and unleashed this tide.
896408967081074689 2017-08-12 16:32:06 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Oh that's good.
896407333882011649 2017-08-12 16:25:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @joanmccarter @mirandayaver Wow. This nasty cracker is putting it out there.
896404066603077632 2017-08-12 16:12:38 UTC <gaughran444> @deray @MyNextLifeDebi Me too.
896397710953263105 2017-08-12 15:47:23 UTC <gaughran444> @pattonoswalt @JoyAnnReid I was wondering. These people are scum.
896397100841357313 2017-08-12 15:44:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Condemn it? He has unleashed it.
896384592701083649 2017-08-12 14:55:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Trump has made America safe for racism. Evidence is everywhere. We will get our country back and these lowlifes will return to the shadows.
896379517253677056 2017-08-12 14:35:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Scum.
896220376052768771 2017-08-11 04:02:43 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @kylegriffin1 Why choose?
896215149668913152 2017-08-11 03:41:57 UTC <gaughran444> Hope it happens again soon.
896213278719963136 2017-08-11 03:34:31 UTC <gaughran444> @markos @JoyAnnReid No skin in the game. For generations.
896212740372615169 2017-08-11 03:32:22 UTC <gaughran444> Is this the guy who got punched in the head in that video?
896210068496142338 2017-08-11 03:21:45 UTC <gaughran444> @markos He made America great again.
896129999647891456 2017-08-11 22:03:35 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @Indytenpoint @VP Most of your stuff is mindless drivel, but this is truly offensive. Trump would deport the "urban youth" of this country if he could.
896126286459842560 2017-08-11 21:48:50 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Ask your lawyer if you can resign now and get clemency for yourself and your kids. Might work.
896125383011061761 2017-08-11 21:45:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow They're not just disinterested in democracy. They're trying to disenfranchise parts of the population.
896099377600581633 2017-08-11 20:01:54 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @JenniferJJacobs Happy to let her speak for me.
896097109576892416 2017-08-11 19:52:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AstroTerry @CallyGingrich @newtgingrich Bet the Pope thinks you're dreadful.
896080241956765697 2017-08-11 18:45:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Any disgust for his assault on our safety?
896071707403747328 2017-08-11 18:11:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I don't accept the idea that basic civil rights are "identity politics." It trivializes one of the main tenets of the Democratic Party.
896063014331326464 2017-08-11 17:37:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @NBCNews Make sure he wears an electronic ankle bracelet. Little dude's in a lot of trouble, might try to skip out.
896062114023882754 2017-08-11 17:33:50 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Tell that little cracker Jeff Sessions about this idea.
896061961099649025 2017-08-11 17:33:14 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Your boss is a menace and you know it. Pipe down, junior.
896049216488853505 2017-08-11 16:42:35 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @wpjenna @margbrennan As if his prefrontal cortex permits sarcasm.
896048537330266112 2017-08-11 16:39:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JohnJHarwood @LindseyGrahamSC Can we once and for all dispense with the notion that Graham is "one of the good ones"? This is what he offers at this perilous moment?
896048130864689160 2017-08-11 16:38:16 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JohnJHarwood @LindseyGrahamSC Are you supporting the bellicose Lunatic in Chief? Seriously? Is this what you have to offer at this dangerous moment?
896047664214794240 2017-08-11 16:36:25 UTC <gaughran444> @PoliticusSarah @AUkeibro We'll find out. Yammering catastrophe. That's it.
896045054007103488 2017-08-11 16:26:03 UTC <gaughran444> @PoliticusSarah @AUkeibro Keith, thanks for much needed laugh! I like the brave GOP guys standing up for McConnell saying fuckall about wacko's nuclear threats.
896043281909469187 2017-08-11 16:19:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @DerWouter Okay, girl. Start talking.
896042680689594368 2017-08-11 16:16:37 UTC <gaughran444> @AP Thank god. There's a grown ups table.
896042405400653825 2017-08-11 16:15:31 UTC <gaughran444> @PoliticusSarah @AUkeibro He wasn't joking. And he hasn't said a word objecting to Russia's actions. Can't piss off his boss.
896041842281766913 2017-08-11 16:13:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Rosemary Woods redux.
896040807026839552 2017-08-11 16:09:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MikeLeePearl @VICE @ColumbiaLaw Oh ffs. Really?
896040574855335937 2017-08-11 16:08:15 UTC <gaughran444> @jeffmason1 Throw a banana peel in there please.
896040100743741440 2017-08-11 16:06:22 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 I had the same reaction. Seems like a good guy but that is off. By about seven years.
896037285875068928 2017-08-11 15:55:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BBBSBroward @marcorubio Speak out against the Lunatic in Chief.
896036582481965056 2017-08-11 15:52:23 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR What a useful fellow.
896036098497028096 2017-08-11 15:50:28 UTC <gaughran444> @BillClinton Congratulations. Can you call that crazy bastard in the WH and tell him to cool it? Many thanks.
896035883366969345 2017-08-11 15:49:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos More like Kentucky Fried Chicken. They should stop with the slogans and support good, Democratic candidates.
896025640813682689 2017-08-11 15:08:54 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 How touching. Why don't they speak up about the Lunatic in Chief endangering the world?
895997014936133635 2017-08-11 13:15:09 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Good. Don't ever.
895991372196364290 2017-08-11 12:52:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @davidfrum Does he feel? I hadn't noticed.
895985003607281664 2017-08-11 12:27:26 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Yes. We lined up facing the basement walls and folded our hands behind our heads. I remember thinking, "How is this gonna work?" Age six.
895984200221810688 2017-08-11 12:24:14 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel This dangerous imbecile.
895983548557033473 2017-08-11 12:21:39 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @sunnysingh_n6 @SarahBurris Nan Hayworth is a fool. CNN should dump her asap.
895983383410601984 2017-08-11 12:20:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @thecalmlady This dangerous fool.
895982463167725569 2017-08-11 12:17:20 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @AC360 The woman Ana is schooling - Nan Hayworth - is a smug imbecile. CNN should unload her as quickly as possible.
895980562065887232 2017-08-11 12:09:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Stop talking, tweeting and endangering the world. Ask your attorneys if you can resign now and avoid criminal prosecution.
895851465029419009 2017-08-10 03:36:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He really is. Breaking news all the damn time. Feel like a rat in a lab experiment. Zap, zap.
895838900089958400 2017-08-10 02:46:52 UTC <gaughran444> @BonBee81 @runswithwaves @AfricanLionBat @critic_social Is that why we're getting so many likes on our conversation? Totally baffled by this. Trump is deeply pathetic with his Obama obsession.
895823986763849728 2017-08-10 01:47:36 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @southpawgram Seriously. What does he have to do?
895822735930032128 2017-08-10 01:42:38 UTC <gaughran444> @BonBee81 @critic_social @runswithwaves @AfricanLionBat You too.
895821632173944833 2017-08-10 01:38:15 UTC <gaughran444> @BonBee81 @critic_social @runswithwaves @AfricanLionBat I don't argue with people on twitter, just bellow at politicians. We won't persuade each other. Good luck to you.
895819000453537792 2017-08-10 01:27:47 UTC <gaughran444> @karenroepke @ProgressPolls @BonBee81 @critic_social @AfricanLionBat Oh come on. He pulled us out of an incipient depression and presided over nearly unprecedented consecutive months of growth. Thanks Obama!
895813782374563840 2017-08-10 01:07:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @DanMeersand Sorry!

895811764054634497 2017-08-10 00:59:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate This is the tip of the cold, white iceberg. This kind of thing happened all over the country. Still happening.
895809164898906113 2017-08-10 00:48:42 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Teen pregnancies are at historic lows. Now they will go up, and these right to lifers don't give a hoot about babies post utero.
895801090419167232 2017-08-10 00:16:37 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia @Katulis That "Unity Tour" was a serious mistake. They should send some actual Democrats on tour and see if things pick up.
895791597719355392 2017-08-10 23:38:54 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Soon he'll be arguing with himself during press conferences.
895790249359663104 2017-08-10 23:33:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Oh yes indeed.
895790023848718336 2017-08-10 23:32:39 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich You need to go away. Really. If you need money get a job.
895787242412806144 2017-08-10 23:21:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Stop bullshitting the American people. Your president is mentally unwell and is endangering the world. What's the plan?
895786848768937984 2017-08-10 23:20:02 UTC <gaughran444> @RepRooney @SpeakerRyan Care to comment on your mentally ill, bellicose president?
895773469710979072 2017-08-10 22:26:52 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Meanwhile back on planet earth.
895758892176732160 2017-08-10 21:28:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Don't be sad. You sound sad.

895752178685661185 2017-08-10 21:02:16 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Poor little baby. I hope he comes through everything well.
895751818487230465 2017-08-10 21:00:50 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Sssshhhh!
895733948151681024 2017-08-10 19:49:49 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 He looks so wistful. Poignant.
895732888414683136 2017-08-10 19:45:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 Newsflash. A lot of people in law enforcement are black. Kamala worked with them, and was very effective. That's not a flaw, Mary.
895729869136461824 2017-08-10 19:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He's sitting on a bench on a median strip on Broadway & 103rd with a bottle of beer in a paper bag. Just talking.
895729454256881664 2017-08-10 19:31:58 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Now he's free associating. Maybe he can start talking about carnage again. That was fun.
895710175843278849 2017-08-10 18:15:22 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @Tara_Mckelvey Or thinking about his best cheeseburger ever while people talk about North Korea.
895680304752603136 2017-08-10 16:16:40 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Say what?
895677703608815616 2017-08-10 16:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 @cristianafarias Super strange.
895676888542216192 2017-08-10 16:03:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonWDC @JaneGrader This is bizarre. Talk about a potential conflict.
895660568702529540 2017-08-10 14:58:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Going gluten free this time?
895621037341245441 2017-08-10 12:21:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro You think they're urging him to attack McConnell? What's the purpose?
895620824111210496 2017-08-10 12:20:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Dumb ass. I remember seeing Just Say No brand rolling papers
895611538572267520 2017-08-10 11:43:25 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation Does he need to remember a user ID or password? That would stop him.
895610222391304192 2017-08-10 11:38:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @charlescwcooke Maybe time for one of those nice, silent Christian retreats. Lots of contemplation. No talking.
895607182309433344 2017-08-10 11:26:06 UTC <gaughran444> @GilTPolitics @yashar Good for you.
895602931126423552 2017-08-10 11:09:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Lucky you.

895598939122143233 2017-08-10 10:53:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @andylassner Hope they're wearing their MAGA hats.
895598399134867460 2017-08-10 10:51:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Just Say No was a punchline when it came out in the 80's.
895597703123619840 2017-08-10 10:48:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro And dangerous as hell.
895502861471297537 2017-08-09 04:31:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MaxineWaters @MaryDram @yashar Racist punk. Was he wearing pants while he said this?
895485340080906240 2017-08-09 03:21:57 UTC <gaughran444> @evepeyser @katherinemiller @JohnJHarwood @jaysonbuford Not only POTUS but better than him in every single way. Much much better.
895484657449488385 2017-08-09 03:19:14 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT He'll never get over the smarter, more accomplished, more loved, better looking black guy. A no-talent Salieri v. Mozart.
895483021327044608 2017-08-09 03:12:44 UTC <gaughran444> @miss_print Ulysses, collected stories of William Trevor, tender is the night, Moby Dick, Goodnight Moon

895480843120070656 2017-08-09 03:04:04 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNews I've been so ticked at him many times but find this very moving. This guy has cornered the market on grace under pressure.
895478021947351040 2017-08-09 02:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @historyinmoment Miss him so.
895428189673185280 2017-08-09 23:34:51 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @yashar Get a good lawyer and countersue his behind off.
895427538217951233 2017-08-09 23:32:16 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Turtle Boy.
895416125768556548 2017-08-09 22:46:55 UTC <gaughran444> @NicolleDWallace @matthewamiller @MargaretMenefee This is a guy to listen to. Understated and smart as hell.
895415288212189184 2017-08-09 22:43:35 UTC <gaughran444> @_dannymo_ Not saying it isn't but at the moment we have bigger fish to fry & he offers no solutions. Just a lot of whining and slogans.
895414651277725698 2017-08-09 22:41:03 UTC <gaughran444> @Newsweek Never mind him. How do we look?
895410832590467073 2017-08-09 22:25:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BillClinton I remember when presidents read books. Thanks.
895400423414272001 2017-08-09 21:44:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Worked last time.
895400108229099522 2017-08-09 21:43:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Today he was tweeting about income inequality. The fucking country is on fire and he's still banging his drum. Self-appointed Messiah.
895399207007379456 2017-08-09 21:39:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Omg. Whadda dick. Just don't kill us all, okay?
895396325277278209 2017-08-09 21:28:14 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix @studentactivism Good man. About time someone spoke up.
895378743920930817 2017-08-09 20:18:22 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Ma'am is a knife in the heart. Every time.
895377758230114305 2017-08-09 20:14:27 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB Amen. I wouldn't have handled it half as well at twice her age.
895376906530553856 2017-08-09 20:11:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB And what a tremendous asset to the United States she is.
895376586165424129 2017-08-09 20:09:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB He's a worm. But this young lady is brave and amazingly poised. I wish we could all help her specifically. As well as the large issues.
895368733337817088 2017-08-09 19:38:35 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali @NBCNews Good idea. Patronize a populace that has been justly frightened by the dangerous ramblings of the Lunatic in Chief.
895367484328599554 2017-08-09 19:33:38 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner Other than their shared good looks and gift for language.
895367367605268481 2017-08-09 19:33:10 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Everyone's a little uptight about that world blowing up thing. This is truly very interesting and significant.
895367096141570048 2017-08-09 19:32:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MottHallBridges @EDNYnews What a good idea!
895363910693523457 2017-08-09 19:19:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Scanning Indeed.
895363258424623105 2017-08-09 19:16:50 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Omg. How have you gotten more shameless? Sorry you failed in your granny killing efforts. Tough loss.
895346109312323584 2017-08-09 18:08:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Is there no legal challenge to this being undertaken?
895345673285062656 2017-08-09 18:06:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Sounds like his orange buddy.
895343681091375105 2017-08-09 17:59:02 UTC <gaughran444> @pattonoswalt And they had to listen to that music. What a night.
895343482138742784 2017-08-09 17:58:15 UTC <gaughran444> @funder He should send flowers. Mueller will back off in a heartbeat.
895343024275951617 2017-08-09 17:56:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady @TinaMcGugan Trump takes the crazy cake. No one can touch him.
895340942034653185 2017-08-09 17:48:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady @TinaMcGugan I was. And the irony of being put  there again by a puppet of Putin.
895339984202452992 2017-08-09 17:44:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @yashar End of days?

895328308522434560 2017-08-09 16:57:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wow. Ditching his old pal.
895327910671794176 2017-08-09 16:56:22 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Maybe he should offer him some money to go away. Will work like a charm.
895326742415515648 2017-08-09 16:51:44 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Jesus, man. Our country is on fire and all you can do is bang the same drum.
895312872204402689 2017-08-09 15:56:37 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala There is a plot among the MAGA people to torment the latte-sipping cosmopolitans with poor grammar. It's cumulative but it may kill us.
895304940360523776 2017-08-09 15:25:06 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP If that's true tell him to shut the f up.
895293259236462592 2017-08-09 14:38:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Acosta Good choice among the many options open to him.

895267999468453889 2017-08-09 12:58:19 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Because this WH is filled with idiots.
895265214907777024 2017-08-09 12:47:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon @paulandstorm This is appalling and unlawful but I wonder if in the long run it would lead to the extinction of the GOP.

895262956182786048 2017-08-09 12:38:16 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Dumb bastard.
895259918932090880 2017-08-09 12:26:12 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are threatening our existence. Resign.
895258662029185026 2017-08-09 12:21:12 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Seriously? Now the SOS has to assure Americans that the POTUS isn't going to kill them? A new meaning for morning in America.
895257883109150720 2017-08-09 12:18:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Probably the title of some porno he especially enjoyed.

895122223362715648 2017-08-08 03:19:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @williamjordann Hey thanks! Perfect for a nervous night.
895115275498135552 2017-08-08 02:51:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce I'm sad about him.
895115078894325760 2017-08-08 02:50:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Comforting. Thank you.
895114051600216064 2017-08-08 02:46:34 UTC <gaughran444> @DrGMLaTulippe Wow. Has hoped to sleep tonight. Never mind.
895113244142129155 2017-08-08 02:43:22 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @AmyMcGrathKY Rooting for you! Go Amy!
895111975553961984 2017-08-08 02:38:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @naretevduorp Orator seems like the wrong word for him. Hisser. Belcher. Snarler.
895111123523055616 2017-08-08 02:34:56 UTC <gaughran444> @WashBlade @DCHomos Viva Il Papa!
895109842620338176 2017-08-08 02:29:51 UTC <gaughran444> @wpjenna @critic_social Thanks for much needed laugh!
895109585236877312 2017-08-08 02:28:50 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Just who we want to hear from at a tense time.
895108738939572224 2017-08-08 02:25:28 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @WhiteHouse Are tax dollars paying for this crude propaganda?
895108167776030725 2017-08-08 02:23:12 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 So much more reliable than that fusty old diplomacy business.
895103559393566720 2017-08-08 02:04:53 UTC <gaughran444> @brhodes Right. Never mind that it would have been true.
895093100779057152 2017-08-08 01:23:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Wait, the front row of a fashion show isn't the Revolution she promised us?
895090998996606976 2017-08-08 01:14:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Loathsome pos.

895089969567481856 2017-08-08 01:10:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Most people, no. But this guy is pretty warped. God knows what he believes.
895088578107244544 2017-08-08 01:05:21 UTC <gaughran444> @EvelynNFarkas Crude. Primitive. Thuggish.
895082862667481089 2017-08-08 00:42:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis I wish trump would get taken out by a bolt of lightning on a golf course. Would rid us of him & give the holy rollers a lot to think about.
895080272072503296 2017-08-08 00:32:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @brhodes I agree as long as we outlive this crazy bastard's reign.
895079501654347776 2017-08-08 00:29:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Oh ffs.
895043133901328384 2017-08-08 22:04:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Hopefully nothing like that fellow at Fox News.
895042616294879232 2017-08-08 22:02:43 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Haha.
895023544584765440 2017-08-08 20:46:56 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Poor guy.
895022896137072641 2017-08-08 20:44:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated They'll get there. He's an idiot but presumably his lawyers are not.
895015977309667333 2017-08-08 20:16:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Life goes on, as is glaringly clear 14 hours later. Another day, another gd'ed trump crisis.
895015628381327361 2017-08-08 20:15:29 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're unwell and should let someone else handle this. Step aside.
895015468221726721 2017-08-08 20:14:50 UTC <gaughran444> @JDRF @SpeakerRyan Good thing you didn't get to yank her healthcare you little weasel.
895015260326907905 2017-08-08 20:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Very frightening He probably wants to distract and he's crazy/enraged. Terrible combination. He's wanted to kick someone for days.
895014460594761728 2017-08-08 20:10:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why choose? Just awful. Maybe one of those stolid generals we're all supposed to feel so good about can come forward, Al Haig style.
894989799530082304 2017-08-08 18:32:50 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell This is what the 25th amendment is for. This.
894989630239645698 2017-08-08 18:32:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @IrisL49 Sorry, I have to think about my hair. Or something.
894989309866119170 2017-08-08 18:30:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AJentleson @jessicaschulb Wouldn't viagra be cheaper?
894961888941010944 2017-08-08 16:41:56 UTC <gaughran444> @InxsyS @IrisL49 The ultimate shovel-ready project.
894961683164254209 2017-08-08 16:41:07 UTC <gaughran444> @politico No one should ever feel sorry for this little cracker. He's the worst.
894960426512994304 2017-08-08 16:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @BooksandtheArts @ryanlcooper @thenation @davidimarcus Uh, he got crushed. Very good man but that was cataclysmic.
894960002250788864 2017-08-08 16:34:26 UTC <gaughran444> @AnaGasteyer These are dark times.
894959487232114688 2017-08-08 16:32:23 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Sounds like the Republican Party circa 2017.
894959192754323457 2017-08-08 16:31:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Meghann_Pie I am too. Just want all good people to be included.
894956065699368960 2017-08-08 16:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Good point. Cooler heads. Thanks.
894955639444828161 2017-08-08 16:17:06 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @vavreck @datruth619 Just reread. Good point. And my reading miscomprehension supports it!
894937766689214464 2017-08-08 15:06:05 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @vavreck @datruth619 No proof of that scenario. Hence the term panic.
894936159159279616 2017-08-08 14:59:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Freeyourmindkid @critic_social Haha! You don't need it honey! Should catch my act in the morning. I look in the mirror and say "Hi Daddy."  He passed at 88!!!!!
894934151064944642 2017-08-08 14:51:43 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie @vavreck White panic has convulsed and damaged our country. Badly.
894933553527574528 2017-08-08 14:49:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Freeyourmindkid @critic_social With this administration I feel 100 years older! Damn.
894929927048396800 2017-08-08 14:34:56 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @MotherJones Is anyone challenging this in court? Don't think it would survive a 1st amendment challenge.
894929504703008769 2017-08-08 14:33:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Vroom!
894926918482526208 2017-08-08 14:22:58 UTC <gaughran444> @creynoldsnc Wild thing, I think I love you.
894926792636735488 2017-08-08 14:22:28 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean I think he's done a lot more harm than good and his acolytes should stop with the purity tests. They'll hurt our candidates.
894924408531320832 2017-08-08 14:13:00 UTC <gaughran444> @politico That's our $89,000.
894923415680929792 2017-08-08 14:09:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Guess the first amendment is fake news.
894923059747893250 2017-08-08 14:07:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers @kpmel So nice. Thank you.
894922916764241921 2017-08-08 14:07:04 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Oh give him some credit. Maybe he did.
894921917148409857 2017-08-08 14:03:06 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF This is terribly serious. I can't believe even this administration has taken this position.
894921061103480832 2017-08-08 13:59:42 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta @nycjim This could go on his tombstone someday. "Everything he said is wrong."
894920691925098496 2017-08-08 13:58:14 UTC <gaughran444> @JordanPeele @mindykaling Loved this movie.
894920458205876224 2017-08-08 13:57:18 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @blakehounshell This dangerous imbecile.
894919938238033920 2017-08-08 13:55:14 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper These poor young boys.
894909952275435520 2017-08-08 13:15:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers It's not a crisis until white people die.
894909224320471040 2017-08-08 13:12:40 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Well Trump did promise we were going to be saying Merry Christmas this year.
894908281868734465 2017-08-08 13:08:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @TheRickWilson Glimmers of sanity.
894907914598666240 2017-08-08 13:07:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson We live in a swirling maelstrom of hoo-ha.
894907496560824320 2017-08-08 13:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Love the haikus brother. Deep stuff.
894906390489292800 2017-08-08 13:01:24 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Good idea. See ya.
894906245014052865 2017-08-08 13:00:50 UTC <gaughran444> @USArmy @VP Guess that team doesn't include your boss. No valor from that guy.
894905979548127232 2017-08-08 12:59:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber You killed it. That was like a rodeo and you held on with grace and clarity. Good for you.
894905526282326017 2017-08-08 12:57:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @18major Yes, they love "the real America" from afar.
894754972654383104 2017-08-07 02:59:43 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Such primitive people.
894745944842878976 2017-08-07 02:23:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated All good! Thank you!
894733782288179201 2017-08-07 01:35:31 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @jaynya13 @JoyAnnReid Love Joy. Could watch for hours.
894727445755998208 2017-08-07 01:10:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance I saw that and thought it was great. No false piety. Refreshing.
894723499276861440 2017-08-07 00:54:40 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris @tribelaw Go Professor Tribe!
894717789159796736 2017-08-07 00:31:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @threecando @Puppet_Prince_ It sure as hell will.
894707897778794496 2017-08-07 23:52:40 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Very good development.
894701809104809984 2017-08-07 23:28:28 UTC <gaughran444> @kamala @BernieSanders @elizabethforma @KamalaHarris @tribelaw @neeratanden If he doesn't he should make that clear. Haven't heard a peep from him.
894701363468398593 2017-08-07 23:26:42 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt I think attacks by donald trump should be taken as a compliment.  Seriously.
894678300630667264 2017-08-07 21:55:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Beyond pathetic.
894675364282347525 2017-08-07 21:43:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @EdwardTHardy @Dawnm90 @birdiealways @20indicia Sigh.
894675016226406400 2017-08-07 21:42:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump NYC hates you. Go to one of your tawdry country clubs instead.
894651614652497922 2017-08-07 20:09:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Ha!
894649067455819780 2017-08-07 19:58:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro By any chance are you running out of gas with these people?
894646561703161860 2017-08-07 19:48:56 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris It will encourage abuse of some of the most vulnerable among us.
894644149948952576 2017-08-07 19:39:21 UTC <gaughran444> @RNC @JoyAnnReid Oh shit. I have found her repellant but this should have disqualified her. Except for this crew, I guess. Wow.
894633678458028033 2017-08-07 18:57:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Let us pray.
894613302080393216 2017-08-07 17:36:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Do people speak with you voluntarily?
894609717993119744 2017-08-07 17:22:32 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian We know. He sucks too but doesn't appear psychotic and might not blow up the world.
894606707195883520 2017-08-07 17:10:34 UTC <gaughran444> @KirstenPowers @mayatcontreras Yes. Just because Dems are respectful of 1st amendment & don't weaponize "faith" doesn't mean none are religious.
894600173741125633 2017-08-07 16:44:36 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Oh ffs.
894588326774095872 2017-08-07 15:57:32 UTC <gaughran444> @henryfingjames Haha! Even then.
894588110733844481 2017-08-07 15:56:40 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum @HelenKennedy Wow!!! Hope there is an afterlife and she's kicking back with a martini somewhere.
894573668562591745 2017-08-07 14:59:17 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @CharlesMBlow Perfect. And beautifully written.
894572718473007104 2017-08-07 14:55:31 UTC <gaughran444> @henryfingjames Dog looks psyched.
894568821582942208 2017-08-07 14:40:02 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum @HelenKennedy I miss Martha Mitchell. Always thought she got a raw deal.
894565681575989249 2017-08-07 14:27:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Sometimes he seems like a single-cell organism. So simple.
894565225109889024 2017-08-07 14:25:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GirlArchaeo @greenhousenyt You're describing a serious problem.
894564780954013700 2017-08-07 14:23:58 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Not this democrat.
894560341476225025 2017-08-07 14:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter Poignant.
894559697205960705 2017-08-07 14:03:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Friday.
894557487193612290 2017-08-07 13:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.
894552940777795586 2017-08-07 13:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Lily Pulitzer's ghost weeps.
894550498942038017 2017-08-07 13:27:13 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Sounds like he's enjoying his well-earned vacation.
894549283449516032 2017-08-07 13:22:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JaneGrader Thanks Jane!
894541639062093824 2017-08-07 12:52:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Isn't Kelly supposed to be wrestling you to the ground now?
894415788563738624 2017-08-06 04:31:56 UTC <gaughran444> @AttyDeniseBrown Still with the fucking hats.
894373630615932928 2017-08-06 01:44:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @ZivGuy Now be fair - some are sitting and some are standing.
894373446360195072 2017-08-06 01:43:40 UTC <gaughran444> @RepDennyHeck @hardball He can and probably will but it won't work out well.
894365433733820416 2017-08-06 01:11:50 UTC <gaughran444> @DayJojo771980 @HoneyDemForce Women are seriously sick of watching women get ashcanned in politics. Hillary, Pelosi, Kamala Harris. Proceed at your peril. #ExpectUs.
894345365708820480 2017-08-06 23:52:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Identity politics - Transgender, POC, feminists. Anything that diverts from whining about Wall Street.
894344732738015232 2017-08-06 23:49:35 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He's such a transparent priss.
894326848829755396 2017-08-06 22:38:31 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan I hope there are still state laws permitting such actions.
894326756349444096 2017-08-06 22:38:09 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Wholly unamerican. Which of course doesn't bother Putin's puppet.
894326276084858880 2017-08-06 22:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @walterdellinger They just can't quit her.
894325311059501056 2017-08-06 22:32:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Wow. That's a widespread problem. Terrible.
894324948642213888 2017-08-06 22:30:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Meanwhile not a syllable from the republicans about Trump's obvious mental illness.
894324604826771457 2017-08-06 22:29:36 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @PreetBharara Preet is the man.
894293387272171520 2017-08-06 20:25:33 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 I made a three point shot into a trash can with The Bridges of Madison County years ago.  Excruciating.
894289130431143936 2017-08-06 20:08:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Austan_Goolsbee @Susan_Hennessey Right. How is this even a thing?
894288990123249664 2017-08-06 20:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @MostlyMe2 Poor little baby.
894285226733686784 2017-08-06 19:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @LizWill99 I hope there are grounds to get rid of Pence. Not aware of them.
894282590496198656 2017-08-06 19:42:39 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson I think he or Pence will and it will indeed be disastrous for future left agenda programs and for what we take as basic rights.
894273055937179648 2017-08-06 19:04:45 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @JoyAnnReid @amjoyshow @DefineAmerican Of course we do. And the ones who spoke English weren't documented either. They were uneducated, desperate and poor. They needed a lifeline
894243741007052802 2017-08-06 17:08:16 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @johngramlich And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what brought us Donald J Trump. White rage & panic.
894232353509388288 2017-08-06 16:23:01 UTC <gaughran444> @funder @Merrillmarkoe Maybe his conscience is strangling him. If he has one.
894210883295039489 2017-08-06 14:57:42 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @VP Dude, everyone knows you're measuring the curtains.
894205651940978690 2017-08-06 14:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Do you have same problem if black people are tried by white juries? Let me guess.
894205428397215744 2017-08-06 14:36:02 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Go John! Keep talking.
894205158590164992 2017-08-06 14:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @TUSK81 Words fail. Barbaric.
894204849444851713 2017-08-06 14:33:44 UTC <gaughran444> @AynRandPaulRyan This guy is an aberrant, nasty piece of work who is not nearly as bright as he thinks he is. Much like his boss.
894203791876214788 2017-08-06 14:29:32 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT A very unfortunate thing.
894049456387227648 2017-08-05 04:16:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Just play jacks and enjoy your coloring books. Don't blow up the world and we're good for now.
893953881771831302 2017-08-05 21:56:28 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @ColMorrisDavis He's cool when he says ain't too.
893953441340542977 2017-08-05 21:54:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Yes he's a tricky little devil. So hard to figure out.
893953182543605761 2017-08-05 21:53:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @maziehirono You are a heroine. Thank you for everything.
893952833640431617 2017-08-05 21:52:19 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @estherthinx Totally agree. We're not America without immigrants.

893941307990822912 2017-08-05 21:06:31 UTC <gaughran444> @amjoyshow Great! About f'ing time, but good news.
893938972975562754 2017-08-05 20:57:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Haha. He wants his peeps.
893938714971340801 2017-08-05 20:56:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Everything he presides over looks like a whorehouse.
893938349483995136 2017-08-05 20:54:45 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson The decline of unions is one of the most heartbreaking stories in American history. Nobody talks about it. Not trump not Bernie. No dems.
893937769214615552 2017-08-05 20:52:27 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj Okay that looks amazing. Thanks.
893937481455992833 2017-08-05 20:51:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid He has really ashcanned his reputation.  Not pretty to watch.
893936984317726721 2017-08-05 20:49:20 UTC <gaughran444> @devons1972 @NavKaz @yourbibuddy If you'd be so kind as to clone yourself it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
893936597170880512 2017-08-05 20:47:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @GlazerRandee Girl when the rat bastard is chased out of the White House we are drinking and dancing to that song like there's no tomorrow!
893885025812451328 2017-08-05 17:22:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Bet they'll let you resign rather than be indicted. Think it over, to the extent that you can think.
893884799722676224 2017-08-05 17:21:58 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer It's Shakespearean without any of the beautiful language or profound thoughts.
893884542876090368 2017-08-05 17:20:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Read to the tune of Sly Stone's "Family Affair."  So down for this.
893884261996122116 2017-08-05 17:19:50 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 No. This bloodless, contemptuous mutant with a shaky grasp of facts and history. All anger all the time. Great.
893883927890464772 2017-08-05 17:18:30 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You're a great performance artist and I like your little poems. Will be a terrible president when putin's puppet gets hauled off.
893857396010962945 2017-08-05 15:33:04 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @markos @davidaxelrod A thing of beauty.
893857186975289350 2017-08-05 15:32:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MailOnline @RWPUSA This is one of the most pathetic thing this damaging wretch has done. Just pathetic.
893854012470169601 2017-08-05 15:19:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @RichardCleland1 @karenroepke Oh yes. I just direct my rage at public figures. On rare occasions tell people to fuck off and block. Often mute the maga peeps.
893853568607846401 2017-08-05 15:17:52 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @RichardCleland1 @karenroepke Hell yes!!!!

893851563793539072 2017-08-05 15:09:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Terrible terrible terrible.
893850986955116544 2017-08-05 15:07:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Shameless bigotry was what swept him into office.
893850374595063808 2017-08-05 15:05:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @RichardCleland1 @karenroepke I do not but my sense is that he's having a hard time and things could be better for him. I don't fight with people on twitter.
893849266975907840 2017-08-05 15:00:46 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @karenroepke @RichardCleland1 Don't pay attention to any snotty comments just try to get all the help you need. You're young & talented and will get through this.
893848020168708097 2017-08-05 14:55:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @karenroepke @RichardCleland1 Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Very rough thing to deal with. I hope there are good people who can help you. Meds can really help too
893845818796539904 2017-08-05 14:47:04 UTC <gaughran444> @ProgressPolls @critic_social @karenroepke @RichardCleland1 Are you a talented artist living in Northern Ireland? That sounds so cool. Why be angry?
893844918904475648 2017-08-05 14:43:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yeah. That Epstein stuff right? He's really cashiered his reputation with some of the dumb stuff he's been saying.
893844208792076288 2017-08-05 14:40:40 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Plant them in dry soil and water lightly. Let them dry out just a bit between watering. Lots of sun.

893701547703631872 2017-08-04 05:13:47 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @spivy2000 How awful. And illegal. But who will help? Not the DOJ.
893697938505043970 2017-08-04 04:59:27 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Great article. Hope Kennedy does the right thing.
893695961289117696 2017-08-04 04:51:35 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson That's exactly right. Make no mistake about it, this is why we got trump. It's called a death rattle and it's not pretty.
893693846470656000 2017-08-04 04:43:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @MaryMarybrogdon @BrianPaulStuart Anything you can do I can do better, I can do anything better than you. Love, BHO

893691607018610688 2017-08-04 04:34:17 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @InternetApex @whatchulooking Agree. We all need to keep our heads up and progress is progress. I have every confidence in where this is headed.
893691159687700481 2017-08-04 04:32:31 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes That is too damn bad.
893690994515992576 2017-08-04 04:31:51 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Oh I like that. Thanks to Dad.
893690564876611584 2017-08-04 04:30:09 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @whatchulooking @InternetApex I know. Any progress is good. Am very optimistic about this investigation. We'll get our country back.
893690115289206784 2017-08-04 04:28:22 UTC <gaughran444> @Civics4GrownUps Civics for Grown Ups. Maybe you guys can make a nice little coloring book for that fellow in the White House?
893686929325215745 2017-08-04 04:15:42 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @whatchulooking @InternetApex Haha! Whatever gave you the idea that you should confine yourself to things you know well? We're on twitter!
893684050464002050 2017-08-04 04:04:16 UTC <gaughran444> @DHSgov @fema @realDonaldTrump @Lily_v_Shtupp Could be used as implement of torture.

893679810970607616 2017-08-04 03:47:25 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Thanks Obama.
893679589326823424 2017-08-04 03:46:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MeLovesMLE @peterdaou Damned good question.
893678735047741440 2017-08-04 03:43:08 UTC <gaughran444> @Caitlyn_Jenner @TheRickyDavila Oh wow. What a jerk.
893672184195026945 2017-08-04 03:17:06 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @InternetApex Yeah I think you're right. Just don't want anyone to become dispirited, myself included. :)
893644809847676928 2017-08-04 01:28:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Please hurry.
893643444328865793 2017-08-04 01:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Trump take note. Looks like fun.
893642981693108225 2017-08-04 01:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris It will hurt the whole nation. And it's unamerican.
893642480708616192 2017-08-04 01:19:05 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @markseibel These poor baby boys.
893641246287306752 2017-08-04 01:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Exactly my reaction. Sick little bastard.
893640997816676352 2017-08-04 01:13:11 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Good. But don't view joy about gj with disdain. We don't have your expertise and are thrilled with all signs of getting our country back.
893639925320605697 2017-08-04 01:08:55 UTC <gaughran444> @EricLiptonNYT @markknoller Quick! Change the locks!

893638503388639233 2017-08-04 01:03:16 UTC <gaughran444> @maziehirono @thedailybeast American hero. I hope she gets well.
893638085896024066 2017-08-04 01:01:37 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Can you elaborate?
893636774551007232 2017-08-04 00:56:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow I have this on the wall in my office. Never get tired of it. Never will.
893636085351198721 2017-08-04 00:53:40 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou @radleybalko Maybe trump should think about this before he calls the press the enemy of the people. To the extent that he can think.
893634488848265216 2017-08-04 00:47:19 UTC <gaughran444> @FrancisShakin @BeschlossDC Sorry John.
893631723250044928 2017-08-04 00:36:20 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidYankovich To the extent that he has one. She's lovely.
893631481121132544 2017-08-04 00:35:22 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Is there something in the water cooler over there or are facist politics a natural aphrodisiac?
893630848137916416 2017-08-04 00:32:51 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting @generallyg123 That's right. And people who brag that their ancestors played by the rules are ignorant or full of it. There were no rules.
893617670482006016 2017-08-04 23:40:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson If my kids ask me to pay for this the answer is no.
893617402029760512 2017-08-04 23:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting I'm white and none of my ancestors were "legal" immigrants bc there were no such laws then. If you weren't sick you got in.
893616626351972354 2017-08-04 23:36:20 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Yeah well that didn't pan out so why don't you all just pack it in? #TrumpRussia #ObamaDay
893616377361293312 2017-08-04 23:35:21 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Heartbreaking. So sorry.
893616033248026625 2017-08-04 23:33:59 UTC <gaughran444> @karenroepke @ProgressPolls @critic_social So nice! Thank you! I guess if nothing else this trump hell time has sharpened our senses of humor!
893611207424430080 2017-08-04 23:14:49 UTC <gaughran444> @karenroepke @ProgressPolls @critic_social Who's that first guy they mentioned? That Russian candidate? #HappyObamaDay
893610570750070786 2017-08-04 23:12:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 And you no doubt are the light of her life.
893610104368529408 2017-08-04 23:10:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson The extended dance version of this is the best.
893609713459486720 2017-08-04 23:08:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 She must be beyond proud of you. What a son she raised.
893609453718708224 2017-08-04 23:07:50 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @Tahsudasj He or Pence will. Horrible but clearly true.
893609348974432256 2017-08-04 23:07:25 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Not to mention RBG. We're in for brutal times as far as the court is concerned. For decades.
893608533845053440 2017-08-04 23:04:11 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @kylegriffin1 Love Auntie Maxine.
893608321587884033 2017-08-04 23:03:20 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Every time she's attacked my enthusiasm for her grows. It's not based on attacks but they only increase my admiration of her.
893608064351424512 2017-08-04 23:02:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Amen!
893607918175703040 2017-08-04 23:01:44 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Crater time.
893607693197471744 2017-08-04 23:00:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro None.
893602837506252802 2017-08-04 22:41:33 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage @ihatejoelkim She compares herself to Rosa Parks. I can't.
893602248353132544 2017-08-04 22:39:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @IrishRose_14 Same. Book club!
893598845199953920 2017-08-04 22:25:41 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Changing locks I hope.

893597076164009985 2017-08-04 22:18:39 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders You sure you want to talk about fraud? Are you forgetting something?

893556850666471425 2017-08-04 19:38:49 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Works for some of us older white folks too. The more she's attacked by the BBs, the more I want to vote for her.

893480430317563905 2017-08-04 14:35:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Of course the evil turtle McConnell will not support this.
893480320846135296 2017-08-04 14:34:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC A bi-partisan move.  We are starting to feel like America again. Green shoots, green shoots.
893478114290020352 2017-08-04 14:25:57 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls When your boss is hauled away will you stop talking? You can make a pile of dough off a book and stop talking.
893476490880462849 2017-08-04 14:19:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @kylegriffin1 He should wear an electronic ankle bracelet.

893475714032443392 2017-08-04 14:16:24 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw No. He's a Ken doll. All plastic. No heart.
893475492682223616 2017-08-04 14:15:32 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Gotta love a leading constitutional scholar with a sense of humor.
893473927267311616 2017-08-04 14:09:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AmericanLegion @MaryMarybrogdon @djbratpack Steve Schmidt is a brilliant, principled guy. The republicans should give him a central role in rebuilding their party.

893471485494513664 2017-08-04 13:59:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Are they making a tunnel under the rose garden to slip away at night?

893465535140253696 2017-08-04 13:35:58 UTC <gaughran444> @NatashaBertrand Of course. But going after a black woman was irresistible to the Bigot in Chief.

892928483776749572 2017-08-02 02:01:54 UTC <gaughran444> Good for Corey Booker introducing fed law to legalize pot. Drug laws slam minorities. Hence Jeff Sessions' enthusiasm for them.
892927802340773888 2017-08-02 01:59:12 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @Pontifex @ColMorrisDavis @frenfer123 Viva Il Papa!
892920912361787392 2017-08-02 01:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @Khanoisseur What a disgrace. Bannon is no doubt descended from Irish immigrants who would also have been banned.
892919454241259521 2017-08-02 01:26:02 UTC <gaughran444> @LaraLeaTrump @EricTrump @POTUS @IvankaTrump If he resigns he might be able to avoid being indicted. Maybe they'll throw in a deal for your husband and brother too. Thank you dad!
892918229269655553 2017-08-02 01:21:10 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost Stephen Miller is a uniquely repulsive bigot.
892917095142481920 2017-08-02 01:16:39 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @theshrillest I'm not entirely sure who she is, for which I am quite grateful.
892915394738106370 2017-08-02 01:09:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander Actually heartbreaking. And horrifying. 2017.
892835611769524229 2017-08-02 19:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman Don't know much about the Middle Ages, looked at the pictures and I turned the pages . . .
892835310832320512 2017-08-02 19:51:40 UTC <gaughran444> @GovWalker @newbalance @SpeakerRyan Thanks! What matters most is killing healthcare and tax breaks for the rich. Much appreciated!
892835105416392705 2017-08-02 19:50:51 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou This is repulsive.  As is he.
892826721099161600 2017-08-02 19:17:32 UTC <gaughran444> @pdacosta This is how this son of a bitch started his campaign. Man of his word. About this only.
892826360292544512 2017-08-02 19:16:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Right? Get a chill down my spine looking at this little bastard. Monotone. Dead eyes. Nothing good here.
892826073569918977 2017-08-02 19:14:58 UTC <gaughran444> @KFILE @suzyhorts America getting greater by the minute.

892820231793586178 2017-08-02 18:51:45 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh stop.
892820080802902016 2017-08-02 18:51:09 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Stay strong.

892817781804150798 2017-08-02 18:42:01 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc You crack me up.
892817661326962693 2017-08-02 18:41:32 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You campaigned on anti-immigrant bigotry and racial hatred. Fortunately you will be forced from office soon.
892816480378728450 2017-08-02 18:36:51 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You go Bone Spur Boy!
892801403097427968 2017-08-02 17:36:56 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Good for him. Will pre-order on Amazon.  Psyched for the movie too.
892800972820553728 2017-08-02 17:35:14 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH Crack's supposed to be fun too.
892800624626212864 2017-08-02 17:33:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Freeyourmindkid Yes we can.
892793014636163075 2017-08-02 17:03:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Jesus what a truly bad idea. Serious position for this half-wit. Know he has a real job now too. Must go back to dancing with the stars.

892783408887279617 2017-08-02 16:25:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Unless it's something fun like ripping away people's healthcare or voting rights.
892783148517515264 2017-08-02 16:24:24 UTC <gaughran444> @postobits @ktumulty Great actress, great line from Potter Stewart. RIP Jeanne Moreau

892780403525914624 2017-08-02 16:13:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @ACLU I'm sorry but when Jeff Sessions came in as AG the message was clear as day.
892780184532922369 2017-08-02 16:12:37 UTC <gaughran444> @jorgeramosnews Of course. Bigoted SOB. Trying his damnedest to make America white again.
892779981541171205 2017-08-02 16:11:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 They tank the economy. Over and over.
892779744768471040 2017-08-02 16:10:52 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Economic growth, diversity of ideas, everything good about America.
892774808722841600 2017-08-02 15:51:16 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Good times.
892770922561712130 2017-08-02 15:35:49 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @MonicaCat999 I detest trump, think he's utter coward. Want him to keep tweeting bc might ultimately be helpful in unloading him.
892754605951549440 2017-08-02 14:30:59 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Congress ground to a halt when Obama came in. A functioning legislative branch is actually kind of handy. Hope they can really do it.

892753577638342656 2017-08-02 14:26:54 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Their asses got kicked. Repeatedly. So now will try something exotic: doing their fucking job. Even tho law has a black guy's name on it.
892752034147041280 2017-08-02 14:20:46 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc This is good. Means they will amend the law rather than appeal which is what is done for all comprehensive legislation. It's their job.
892749054572204032 2017-08-02 14:08:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Don't let them stop you! Your eloquence and bravery are a beacon to all freedom-loving Americans!
892748113907208192 2017-08-02 14:05:11 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Thanks Obama.
892747820981264386 2017-08-02 14:04:01 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahljaffe @Ali_Gharib Almost. Indeed.
892742613157150726 2017-08-02 13:43:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @StevenBeschloss It really is painful. But we need to know that's what we had and we will have this again. Thank you.
892742331551670274 2017-08-02 13:42:12 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @IvankaTrump @SBALinda @SBAgov @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump If you resign they might not indict you. Try it.
892741315015979008 2017-08-02 13:38:10 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Did you apologize for the Thug in Chief shoving him aside at the NATO meeting?
892740947603271682 2017-08-02 13:36:42 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Remind me why you're still talking?
892740806787952640 2017-08-02 13:36:09 UTC <gaughran444> @VP It's nice that you're not psychotic but you're going to be a bad president.
892602042811908096 2017-08-01 04:24:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusanVermazen @SusaMorgan I doubt it. I think there will be plenty of obstruction evidence. The firing of Comey was a hell of a start.
892601423719956480 2017-08-01 04:22:17 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Hahaha! You're funnier than Seinfeld! Real work!
892601218568249344 2017-08-01 04:21:28 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Sssssshhhhh.
892601135302922240 2017-08-01 04:21:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 You should write a book called Dear White People.  Could be great.
892600828363546625 2017-08-01 04:19:55 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I hope he's half as desolate and tortured as he looks.
892598992227512320 2017-08-01 04:12:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JonathanTurley @MarkSZaidEsq He's right about public statements but doesn't touch firing of Comey. It's all a spectator sport at this point; the truth will out.
892598167845437440 2017-08-01 04:09:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JonathanTurley @MarkSZaidEsq The Gambinos kept their mouths shut and worked harder.
892597290560630784 2017-08-01 04:05:52 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Uh, yeah. Except for that little international espionage investigation.
892587272511598593 2017-08-01 03:26:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @StevenBeschloss Go Steven! DT must be especially offensive to those with a full grasp of presidential history.
892585587517083648 2017-08-01 03:19:22 UTC <gaughran444> @iamjoonlee Fantastic.
892585184188563456 2017-08-01 03:17:45 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel He's so dumb it's physically painful.
892584638274818050 2017-08-01 03:15:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This is infuriating. These cynical racist bastards. Justice.
892582830114525184 2017-08-01 03:08:24 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @LeSynthese Same here.
892581858692739072 2017-08-01 03:04:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JoyAnnReid @markmobility So trump is lying or hallucinating. Highly fit for his job.
892581535223828480 2017-08-01 03:03:16 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel @Wwm_Shakespeare Props to whomever is doing this. Such a pleasure.
892581058788700160 2017-08-01 03:01:22 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Every time I look at this little cracker's face I see ropes hanging from trees.

892571305219903488 2017-08-01 02:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @_LeslieDay_ This.
892571193487892480 2017-08-01 02:22:10 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm The center cannot hold. Haven't gone a day since 11/8/16 without thinking about it.
892570497266982912 2017-08-01 02:19:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CoryBooker Wait. How will Jeff Sessions fill his friends' private prisons?
892569676194164737 2017-08-01 02:16:08 UTC <gaughran444> @lawrencehurley Very good news.
892569214569127936 2017-08-01 02:14:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Yeah but what would she know about racist policies? She had that little cracker's number but no one would listen.
892568767452073984 2017-08-01 02:12:31 UTC <gaughran444> @lrozen Interesting. Not only attorney on this team with foreign bribery experience.
892565114783715328 2017-08-01 01:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Little cracker Sessions has probably been dreaming of this for years.
892558406833328129 2017-08-01 01:31:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Crackle, crackle.
892556956187099137 2017-08-01 01:25:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusanVermazen @SusaMorgan I don't know about that. But if people who know more than I do say yes, I'd go with their view.
892556091791429635 2017-08-01 01:22:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @nytimes Justice is hiring new lawyers for this grisly task. What a perversion of civil rights laws this will be. Sickening.
892555572586967041 2017-08-01 01:20:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @nytimes This is disgusting.  I hate to think of the people who will sign on for this nasty work.
892507143093530624 2017-08-01 22:07:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusaMorgan That was reprehensible.
892464323762823169 2017-08-01 19:17:30 UTC <gaughran444> @maxthegirl Think mundaneness ok. No to mundanity. Although does rhyme with Hannity so tempting.
892463925266087936 2017-08-01 19:15:55 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ And that is why we love Auntie Maxine.
892463435547648000 2017-08-01 19:13:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusaMorgan Dumb dumb dumb. Like evil Kardashians.
892451919591088128 2017-08-01 18:28:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @CincinatusCee Good question. Maybe they can't confirm with enough sources to meet their protocols. Claude's got a good record.
892451338034061312 2017-08-01 18:25:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusaMorgan They're really imbeciles. Don't think they consult with their lawyers before mouthing off. It's crazy.
892450901071450112 2017-08-01 18:24:10 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Another fabulous mine for comedy. We need him gone.
892450789800783872 2017-08-01 18:23:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I guess we'll see more of these courageous rats diving off the sinking ship as time goes on. Yuck.
892442098439467008 2017-08-01 17:49:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Schneiderman's on this bastard like white on rice. So good.
892441866167365632 2017-08-01 17:48:16 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Oh come on. What's more comical than police brutality?
892441693131337729 2017-08-01 17:47:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Sure is. Seems to have tapped into some real courage he didn't have a few days ago.
892436924056686593 2017-08-01 17:28:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SusaMorgan I think Trump drafting a false explanation for the DT Jr/Russians meeting can be very helpful as to showing consciousness of guilt.
892382152259751936 2017-08-01 13:50:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I don't think it's unlawful to disseminate false news. Although would be interesting q if they're trying to change facts about Russia/trump
892380736673722372 2017-08-01 13:45:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Oh good. We've been sorely lacking in the drama department lately.
892374689083002881 2017-08-01 13:21:20 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @thehill Ok Lindsey. Thanks for sharing. Any action plan?
892373715236925444 2017-08-01 13:17:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics But where are the clowns? There ought to be clowns. Quick, send in the clowns . . .
892370361429495812 2017-08-01 13:04:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hey you're back! Kelly didn't grab your phone?
892370102330548224 2017-08-01 13:03:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @ChrisMurphyCT Or retire. That would work too.
892368108282925056 2017-08-01 12:55:11 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Hope it goes as well as your simple, fair healthcare "reform."

892211013260640257 2017-07-31 02:30:56 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @Bencjacobs It's been a banner day for overbearing dirtbags.

892193665174695937 2017-07-31 01:22:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @peterdaou You can't really say that it's time for the investigation to be over because you have no idea what they're doing or why.
892192904491540480 2017-07-31 01:18:59 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson You can't even go to the bathroom these days without all hell breaking loose.

892178991402102785 2017-07-31 00:23:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 This is a bad idea for highly trained lawyers. This clown? Oh boy.

892150311175036929 2017-07-31 22:29:44 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix She prefers the lilting tones of her husband's voice musing about grabbing pussies.

892147872107560962 2017-07-31 22:20:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @peterdaou Thank you. Couldn't agree more.
892147532062707712 2017-07-31 22:18:41 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Good. This guy is a vicious bigot with no respect for the law.
892120189478862848 2017-07-31 20:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Blinding ego, limited grasp of issues.
892118676199133185 2017-07-31 20:24:01 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Remember all that quiet competence?
892118362133848065 2017-07-31 20:22:46 UTC <gaughran444> @GovChristie @jaketapper Says the statesman who menaced a baseball fan over a plate of nachos.
892117946180481025 2017-07-31 20:21:07 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM Me too. Ambition first, country last.
892117528415174656 2017-07-31 20:19:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @TrueFactsStated I think you'd need a hazmat team to extinguish Bannon.

892078847646150657 2017-07-31 17:45:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @kylegriffin1 Would love to see what this bs cost taxpayers.
892078386755108866 2017-07-31 17:43:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MrFilmkritik Yes it is. Hope he's prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
892078092168155136 2017-07-31 17:42:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC No it can't and it won't.
892071749843595264 2017-07-31 17:17:33 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Yes. And they've also been insisting that anything accomplished by the black guy has to be obliterated.
892051735207968768 2017-07-31 15:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak So sad to hear he's gone and how went. Poor guy.

892008750747353089 2017-07-31 13:07:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR This happens to girls with other types of disabilities too - dyslexia, ADHD. They don't act out as much so get pushed along without help.
892008003452510208 2017-07-31 13:04:15 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyersComm How terrible.
892004082701000705 2017-07-31 12:48:40 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Yeah they're terrible. Too bad they own your boss.
892003729322516480 2017-07-31 12:47:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No it's either fear or disgust.
892003563173543936 2017-07-31 12:46:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Throw in footage of trump shoving the PM of Montenegro aside.
892003300954050560 2017-07-31 12:45:34 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Nice tactic to brag about something that he's forced to do.
892002586349457409 2017-07-31 12:42:43 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP He has to sign that bill and he's not talking about it. What's up?
892002266177306626 2017-07-31 12:41:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Dude, you are chaos with weird hair. Resign before you're indicted.
891870525810769920 2017-07-30 03:57:58 UTC <gaughran444> @RuPaul @brianklaas It was perfect. But why has he stopped talking?
891870169601122305 2017-07-30 03:56:33 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Not if you paid me.

891867776213803009 2017-07-30 03:47:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila What a great woman. Miss her so.
891845666791723008 2017-07-30 02:19:11 UTC <gaughran444> @nytopinion This is disastrous.
891844176236736517 2017-07-30 02:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics No.
891837257912659968 2017-07-30 01:45:46 UTC <gaughran444> @joshgreenman Because trump got elected on a tidal wave of bigotry.
891836511527817218 2017-07-30 01:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing @SenGillibrand And with so much less sturm und drang.
891836071880916992 2017-07-30 01:41:03 UTC <gaughran444> @PatCunnane Thug life.
891794070233862144 2017-07-30 22:54:09 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Ah. Sorry for your confusion. Good luck.
891791299136958465 2017-07-30 22:43:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That's it exactly. Churchillian resolve. This is how we do.
891791049173196801 2017-07-30 22:42:09 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Archetypal sexist pig.
891713842039980032 2017-07-30 17:35:21 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics "I am in charge."  Anyone remember that?
891713623441252352 2017-07-30 17:34:29 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 From the party that brought you the 8 hour day and the weekend.

891713261669941248 2017-07-30 17:33:03 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I love this. America is coming back, like the green shoots after the recession. We will prevail.

891712690774847489 2017-07-30 17:30:47 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @IrisL49 At this point the Repubs are slicing their own throats. 2018 is not that far away.
891711093843922946 2017-07-30 17:24:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SeattleJen42 @dawnrsingh They'll get him. It's harrowing to wait but they can't bring cases that will fall apart. Helps no one.
891709493402365953 2017-07-30 17:18:05 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @SenatorCollins @jaketapper Tone. What a nice way to refer to self-administered blow jobs. Elegant woman.
891708981131051009 2017-07-30 17:16:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SeattleJen42 Law enforcement will take him down. I think he'll resign before he's indicted.
891706766391738370 2017-07-30 17:07:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MickMulvaneyOMB @jaketapper Oy. What a shit show.

891701180744818688 2017-07-30 16:45:03 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @SenatorCollins @CNNPolitics @CNNSotu Can we gently close this door and tiptoe away?
891700708969504769 2017-07-30 16:43:10 UTC <gaughran444> @W7VOA @deg2 Everything's a school yard fight now. No diplomacy, no deliberation.

891628211179835392 2017-07-30 11:55:05 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Happy crazy Sunday.
891477880483565570 2017-07-29 01:57:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @HelenKennedy @RepSwalwell I represent kids who have been bullied  in school. Has skyrocketed since the Thug in Chief got elected.
891477245763702785 2017-07-29 01:55:12 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls Oh dear. You're kind of embarrassing.
891441153119268872 2017-07-29 23:31:47 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP No heavier hand of government than forcing women to have funerals for foetuses. Remember that great idea, Mr. Pence?
891439701227384833 2017-07-29 23:26:01 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro No, that's the Mooch.
891420488064434176 2017-07-29 22:09:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Fuck these perseverative ghouls. Can't they just dance around a burning picture of Obama and get on with their wretched lives?
891419930960293888 2017-07-29 22:07:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I don't think trump can pardon himself on fed charges so hopefully he gets it coming and going.
891419648423600132 2017-07-29 22:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @jk_rowling Primitive pos.
891337728624914434 2017-07-29 16:40:49 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulRudnickNY @MyNextLifeDebi I would kill to see Franken do the Mooch.
891336498678816768 2017-07-29 16:35:56 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen Wish he could be added as a defendant.

891287943926738946 2017-07-29 13:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Exactly. And now if they can amend Obamacare as they have all comprehensive legislation they'll be up and running again.
891275659120701440 2017-07-29 12:34:10 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He sure as hell did. And still does.
891274873137451009 2017-07-29 12:31:03 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Tell the prime minister of Montenegro that we're sorry the imbecile shoved him aside at the G-7.

891266655640330240 2017-07-29 11:58:24 UTC <gaughran444> @markos @EricBoehlert Wait. I thought it was going to happen on "Day One!"
891264418964795392 2017-07-29 11:49:31 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos What? Working class people are not all white??
891263071657787394 2017-07-29 11:44:09 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken They're adorable and you're great.
891261760338112514 2017-07-29 11:38:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The cops in my family don't rough people up and think you're beneath contempt.
891170485849001984 2017-07-28 05:36:15 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Oh no. Don't see them as my peers for a minute.
891122442994929664 2017-07-28 02:25:21 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis If only we could do a moon launch.
891121805108416512 2017-07-28 02:22:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Relax. We all lived through the Starr Report. It's okay.
891121642994360320 2017-07-28 02:22:10 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Time for bed, dude. You're not making sense. Repubs got owned last night. Sleep well.
890988389683662848 2017-07-28 17:32:40 UTC <gaughran444> @michaelhayes Go Commissioner O'Neill!!
890987348951015424 2017-07-28 17:28:32 UTC <gaughran444> @funder He will destroy the Supreme Court for decades but is not likely to blow up the world. Which is good.
890973340172681217 2017-07-28 16:32:52 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Thank you Obama.
890973121309794305 2017-07-28 16:32:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I want a block assistant for my life. Is that hard to arrange?
890972726176993283 2017-07-28 16:30:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump I have a lot of cops in my family and every one of them thinks you're a joke. A pathetic joke.
890972540092461059 2017-07-28 16:29:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I'm going to drop if the excitement doesn't let up. But that's okay. Thanks  Claude.
890972284072144898 2017-07-28 16:28:40 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan It's time to admit that you are ideologically and morally bankrupt and can't accomplish a goddamned thing.

890952752196669443 2017-07-28 15:11:03 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse Haha! You got owned! Obamacare is the law of the land!

890804562038185984 2017-07-27 05:22:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @Lawrence This is like a college mixer from hell. So much interpretation of every body movement. But no blasting music or warm beer.
890804010445295617 2017-07-27 05:20:01 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump I need a rosary.
890803634069413890 2017-07-27 05:18:31 UTC <gaughran444> @mattzollerseitz @JordanUhl Did his ashen old choirboy face look sad?
890803237535662081 2017-07-27 05:16:56 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @Bobblespeak No that was triumphant and exciting. This is like praying for a stay of execution. Not the same.
890802286993133569 2017-07-27 05:13:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @l_b_mitch Tell me his frozen face looked sad.
890802030108745728 2017-07-27 05:12:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This is like the worst New Year's Eve ever. Drop, you goddamned ball!

890800433437880320 2017-07-27 05:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yes. The dude likes his attention. Do the right thing, John. You'll feel good.
890799674579329025 2017-07-27 05:02:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Get the lead out you old bastards! We have work in the morning!

890798958812868608 2017-07-27 04:59:56 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos I will take back every syllable of every bad thing I've said about him. Could take a while but no prob.
890798475872354304 2017-07-27 04:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath @ChadPergram Pence working on McCain in the chamber? Sounds a little funky. Been a long day.
890798100599656448 2017-07-27 04:56:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Good point. Ffs. Very good point.
890797763247521792 2017-07-27 04:55:11 UTC <gaughran444> @ashleyfeinberg @PeteyOnBlogs Much needed laugh!

890796833173233664 2017-07-27 04:51:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile I know. Gonna be cranky tomorrow and hate them more than ever. However this goes.
890796480507686913 2017-07-27 04:50:05 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris @hardball No. We know these faux thugs are a bunch of wimps. Trump will wet his pants when he sees his indictment.
890796210654662656 2017-07-27 04:49:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated These rat bastards are screwing America and keeping me up on a school night.
890794587215740930 2017-07-27 04:42:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AJentleson @mj_lee McCain will forever be remembered as a hero by all Americans if he does the right thing.
890793050095534080 2017-07-27 04:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer @BurnettBetony Certainly looks that way. Year after year.
890792486368456709 2017-07-27 04:34:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MerriamWebster Okay that's a little scary.
890791404670038016 2017-07-27 04:29:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA That is the reason. We know it and we won't forget it. #ExpectUs

890785384057028609 2017-07-27 04:06:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 At least he has the coverage for it.
890785261654745088 2017-07-27 04:05:31 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @jpodhoretz On all sides yet these Republican bastards vote for it right?
890783575943110656 2017-07-27 03:58:49 UTC <gaughran444> @fivefifths That stuff is bad for you. Better cut it out, esp w/o healthcare.

890768300954800128 2017-07-27 02:58:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow You're being hard on the sopranos. They had a certain charm.
890765052034338817 2017-07-27 02:45:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 The feeling is mutual.
890763584585781248 2017-07-27 02:39:22 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur Yes, but 8 damaging pages no?
890763257383985153 2017-07-27 02:38:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Don't need him interpreting the obvious.
890761219963006977 2017-07-27 02:29:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Sounds like the GOP with the skinny bill.

890754012009705473 2017-07-27 02:01:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Oh bullshit. Voting no is pretty damn simple.
890753719121399810 2017-07-27 02:00:10 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath Yes, bad for the heart, bad for the soul. But unavoidable these days unless in a coma.
890748936004276225 2017-07-27 01:41:10 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @yashar To which trump replied, Don Jr likes to hunt, not me. No worries.

890735383323049984 2017-07-27 00:47:19 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Would be more persuasive if they could read.
890734385774956544 2017-07-27 00:43:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ChadPergram Not with my tax dollars. I want my Benghazi bullshit money back too.
890733217581588481 2017-07-27 00:38:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Ziga_Iglic @EricJafMN Why were both put in one bill? Who sponsored this?
890732983795240960 2017-07-27 00:37:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Ziga_Iglic @EricJafMN I see articles where Kerry voices concern re sanctions v Iran but nothing where he talks about Iran sanctions in Russian sanctions bill.
890730709945548800 2017-07-27 00:28:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Ziga_Iglic @EricJafMN Sanctions against Russia could destroy the Iran deal? How? I will read about it. Thanks.

890729933500280832 2017-07-27 00:25:39 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Assuming he can read, Trump probably loved the interview. Profane, swaggering nonsense. What could be better?
890728108709605377 2017-07-27 00:18:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @CraigCunningham Sorry don't buy it.
890727866379456512 2017-07-27 00:17:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Ziga_Iglic Don't buy it for a minute. Only he and one other senator perceived this imminent threat to the Iran nuclear deal?
890723354516361216 2017-07-27 23:59:31 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz I wouldn't trust him with a pet rock. Known in ny as a con man since the 80's.
890722678541361152 2017-07-27 23:56:50 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen I am so tired of this crew of drama queens. Fill that White House with women and watch things quiet down.
890722132405231618 2017-07-27 23:54:39 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR What? All those pesky security forms? Just blow them off like Jared did.
890721576345374720 2017-07-27 23:52:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Total bs. He needs to explain this. Looks bad, bad, bad.
890718412040785920 2017-07-27 23:39:52 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Shouldn't someone ask him about voting against sanctions v Russia? That's newsworthy, no?
890717418758209537 2017-07-27 23:35:56 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @yashar Can't wait for the extended dance version.

890702177391587330 2017-07-27 22:35:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Make that toilet paper. Profane little bugger.

890611057433116672 2017-07-27 16:33:17 UTC <gaughran444> @axios Could be. If anyone in my party had a goddamned spine. Don't look at me.
890610682512539648 2017-07-27 16:31:48 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost They can be restored. First the rule of law must be reestablished. This common criminal must be removed.
890610151908007936 2017-07-27 16:29:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @GlennThrush Yes. This White House/psychiatric hospital has yet to face a single crisis that is not self-imposed. Scary to imagine.
890608764193095680 2017-07-27 16:24:10 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Yes. Or one who would put his money where his mouth is.
890608453579808768 2017-07-27 16:22:56 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes And no penalty for the Lunatic in Chief terrorizing all these soldiers.
890608171840032768 2017-07-27 16:21:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon What a distinguished beginning for yet another august statesman.
890565228337000448 2017-07-27 13:31:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @HashtagGriswold @MollyMcGee Yeah. Our own f'ing Fonz.
890562305041346561 2017-07-27 13:19:34 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey @charlie_simpson Right. What's his deal? Can't be the voice of reason if you won't open your mouth.
890561231320489984 2017-07-27 13:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MyNextLifeDebi @TheRickWilson Exactly. Too goddamned peppy and combative.
890561064387186688 2017-07-27 13:14:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @GloriaBorger @danmericaCNN Aka patriots.
890560800099885056 2017-07-27 13:13:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson So fun to imagine.
890557797758361600 2017-07-27 13:01:39 UTC <gaughran444> @RepCohen @TheDemocrats @AdamParkhomenko Absolutely. 24/7.

890555978646769665 2017-07-27 12:54:25 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Good for them!
890555634076221440 2017-07-27 12:53:03 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @markknoller Great. Maybe he can go into a revelry about carnage. He likes that kind of thing.
890555363858239489 2017-07-27 12:51:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Julie_C_Smith @matthewamiller Oh you with the facts again!
890554415207329793 2017-07-27 12:48:12 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 He can't read.
890544660887867392 2017-07-27 12:09:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CameronCrowe @jaketapper Vanilla Sky. Hallucinatory mess with Tom Cruise having dumb revelations.
890543795657486336 2017-07-27 12:06:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @ComfortablySmug Yes. This faux gangsta stuff is cringe-worthy.
890542935334424576 2017-07-27 12:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @EsotericCD Hilarious movie. This version slightly less funny.
890542153977516032 2017-07-27 11:59:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @HashtagGriswold Maybe he should stop acting like a two bit thug and see how things go.
890541707368042498 2017-07-27 11:57:43 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Yes and more important if he does it they won't impeach.
890540145006567426 2017-07-27 11:51:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @critic_social He's a chip off the old narcissistic con artist block.  Because the world really needed another.
890539892517810177 2017-07-27 11:50:30 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @meetmissjoness What the fuck happened.
890539703119773697 2017-07-27 11:49:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @TheRickWilson @Anthony He's a mini-trump. Because the world needed another.
890539315100606465 2017-07-27 11:48:12 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @ZekeJMiller He's from the sleazy, con artist section of NY. Like his boss. There are other neighborhoods.
890538775876710400 2017-07-27 11:46:04 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidChalian @yashar Just what this White House needed. Another verbally incontinent narcissist. Hopefully it helps Mueller in some way.
890406930950361088 2017-07-26 03:02:09 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Will have to read it. Think it's about title vii.
890403678582173697 2017-07-26 02:49:14 UTC <gaughran444> @darionavarro111 Only a man with lifetime health insurance could take such a position.
890396706411622401 2017-07-26 02:21:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MollyMcKew That is really something to think about.
890396273924296706 2017-07-26 02:19:49 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix Hopefully they'll take a massive hit for legal fees. And get a bad result.
890395294797627393 2017-07-26 02:15:55 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama I think he heard there was a tv camera in the building and had to get their first.
890394816294645761 2017-07-26 02:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Can't they just pray for what they want? Why muck around in secular pursuits like government? Go straight to God and leave us alone.
890393727876956161 2017-07-26 02:09:42 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidColeACLU @ACLU Good. Please crush this ignorant beast.

890392648988721152 2017-07-26 02:05:24 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @OnlyShaneOrtega Great interview. People will be listening to you well after trump is removed from the White House. Onwards!
890388451211837440 2017-07-26 01:48:44 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Of course he is.
890347472198959104 2017-07-26 23:05:53 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage Oh shit. This is one bad guy.
890346699352403969 2017-07-26 23:02:49 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Hearing from a lot of brave, impressive people today. It's very moving.
890346045317709824 2017-07-26 23:00:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Mo money, mo problems.
890342304069890048 2017-07-26 22:45:21 UTC <gaughran444> @politico That's a start. Maybe he can convince his deranged client to resign when after he reviews the proposed indictment.
890341863814828032 2017-07-26 22:43:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @VP Your new stand-up routine is great! You're killing it!
890340065330835456 2017-07-26 22:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> @yashar Happy birthday! Now kick that orange ass!
890337732937093120 2017-07-26 22:27:11 UTC <gaughran444> @VABVOX How heroic.
890337651861139456 2017-07-26 22:26:52 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost If those freakishly tiny fists were larger none of this would have happened. The whole world had to pay for his inadequacies.
890337098598928384 2017-07-26 22:24:40 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn At this point looking like we even have a culture and values would be an accomplishment.
890336796302860290 2017-07-26 22:23:28 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @mattwaxman1 Super strong on hate. A little lighter on the boring stuff like legality.
890333888589029376 2017-07-26 22:11:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Mueller's got the tax returns. The jig's up President Hater.
890328159639482373 2017-07-26 21:49:09 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Right. The man's brain is a lava lamp. There's no master plan. It's eat, tweet, sit, pound table, eat, yell, sleep, repeat.
890314257933402112 2017-07-26 20:53:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Why don't you suspend your healthcare coverage while this all works itself out? Coward.
890307492869283840 2017-07-26 20:27:02 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory George is right.   Just wait.
890298009086550017 2017-07-26 19:49:20 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @CodyLouisiana You're the same age as one of my sons, also born in '92. I hope all goes well for you.
890297775585468417 2017-07-26 19:48:25 UTC <gaughran444> @mobinc1234 He won't. Too busy with his hair. :)
890290625937104896 2017-07-26 19:20:00 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Preet's the man.
890290468134768640 2017-07-26 19:19:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Our gutsy renegade.

890290133043486720 2017-07-26 19:18:03 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Straight up bullshit.
890289294413357056 2017-07-26 19:14:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @CodyLouisiana Good heavens. Didn't occur to me.
890267041084604418 2017-07-26 17:46:17 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Maybe he can reprise his mimicking routine of a disabled reporter for the occasion.
890263886083108865 2017-07-26 17:33:45 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @Littletams2003 Is that true? Sickening.
890263510864809985 2017-07-26 17:32:15 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm @washingtonpost There's a good joke in here but am too ticked off to think of it.

890260759376220160 2017-07-26 17:21:19 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck Sure as hell does.

890242681775022082 2017-07-26 16:09:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I think trump's brain is a lava lamp at this point. Don't think he's strategizing.
890212247808684032 2017-07-26 14:08:33 UTC <gaughran444> @WashBlade @DCHomos This will be challenged in court. Disgraceful.
890212066585346048 2017-07-26 14:07:50 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He's had a very Hitlerian week. Bigoted youth rally, singling out vulnerable minority for exclusion. And it's only Wednesday!
890208833905336322 2017-07-26 13:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Be still my heart.
890208741060210688 2017-07-26 13:54:37 UTC <gaughran444> @espiers He is a deeply deranged bigot who can't keep his violent fantasies to himself.
890205133044412418 2017-07-26 13:40:17 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt He's waging war on the working class.

890203469210161152 2017-07-26 13:33:40 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 What a disgrace. This depraved man.
890200207308226560 2017-07-26 13:20:43 UTC <gaughran444> @NewDay @HelenKennedy @CNNPolitics Just what America needs. Another shameless bullshit artist.
890198322996293632 2017-07-26 13:13:13 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt And no one is invoking the 25th amendment? What does he have to do?
890198124031082496 2017-07-26 13:12:26 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 He's really a low form of life.

890196548352712704 2017-07-26 13:06:10 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @washingtonpost It hurts. The rampant stupidity hurts.

890195813720358913 2017-07-26 13:03:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Voting, protesting or anti-Trump speech from this day forward.
890195050264657920 2017-07-26 13:00:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NicolleDWallace @kylegriffin1 I hope so. But where's the evidence of a republican groundswell against trump/Russia? Or even a whimper? The sanctions?
890193899096084480 2017-07-26 12:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @FranTownsend I'm sorry but he should have voted against this terrible bill. Incomprehensible.

890185933831770112 2017-07-26 12:24:00 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Absolutely right. The rise of ignorance made trump possible.

890180241649541120 2017-07-26 12:01:23 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS The president who mocked a disabled reporter and is trying to take Medicaid from the disabled. Let's celebrate.
890179947955970048 2017-07-26 12:00:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Don't Iike to kick someone when they're down but if he does he's a hypocrite. Thought I saw last night that Lindsay graham voted no.

889832491728633856 2017-07-25 12:59:32 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Okay. Start talking docs.
889830577121234944 2017-07-25 12:51:56 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @owillis He said that? From which planet??
889828197998747648 2017-07-25 12:42:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @imillhiser This is a fascinating thought. Any suggested further reading on this?
889827692035657728 2017-07-25 12:40:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @TheRickWilson That's the horrible part. This lunatic has yet to face a single crisis that wasn't self-imposed.
889826228236156928 2017-07-25 12:34:39 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou None whatsoever.
889820425202618368 2017-07-25 12:11:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Mobute Fantastic.

889688085759488000 2017-07-24 03:25:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You tried to turn that event into a Hitler youth rally. Despicable. Resign and seek help for your crumbling mental health.
889684483976425476 2017-07-24 03:11:25 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @TheDailyShow Trump is a communicable disease.
889682039871606784 2017-07-24 03:01:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Facts are such a buzz kill.
889681672945504256 2017-07-24 03:00:14 UTC <gaughran444> @AJentleson @CoreyCiorciari Very dangerous for kids.

889679289800687616 2017-07-24 02:50:46 UTC <gaughran444> Just a reminder of what a real president looks like.pic.twitter.com/y31Cvm1M5x
889677218137419777 2017-07-24 02:42:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @sgrant525 Absolutely will not.
889675784096559105 2017-07-24 02:36:50 UTC <gaughran444> @jaredkushner @RogerF1953 Yes, a humorless, priggish woody Allen.
889675406009397248 2017-07-24 02:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump @RogerF1953 You don't think you have the capacity to be shocked by this guy anymore, yet there's always some new outrage.
889675112617832448 2017-07-24 02:34:10 UTC <gaughran444> @1BabyBye He also was a Boy Scout. Unlike the flaccid tweeter.
889674411229556736 2017-07-24 02:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump You tried to turn a scout jamboree into a Hitler youth rally today. What a debased person you are.
889673097447649281 2017-07-24 02:26:10 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ And limitless self-pity.
889672618294620160 2017-07-24 02:24:16 UTC <gaughran444> @carolynsave Okay donate to Save the Children. Will do.
889672419123843072 2017-07-24 02:23:28 UTC <gaughran444> @carolynsave Oh this poor baby. What can we do to help?
889671887994925061 2017-07-24 02:21:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @ColMorrisDavis @DavidCornDC He really shouldn't. Last chance to be a true maverick.
889671059569614848 2017-07-24 02:18:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @MiaFarrow Disgusting. Maybe especially so to parents. How dare this cretin sink children into his mire.
889669932044214272 2017-07-24 02:13:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AidenWolfe Best of luck to him!
889668933669748736 2017-07-24 02:09:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Many moons ago he tried for serious immigration reform. With Ted Kennedy I think. And McCain/Feingold?
889666690245636096 2017-07-24 02:00:42 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @ShaneGoldmacher God help us. He's reproducing by fission.
889665752747397121 2017-07-24 01:56:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @ananavarro Sanders loves to bellow. Especially if cameras rolling. Quiet, careful thought less of a strong point for him.
889661892666552321 2017-07-24 01:41:38 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC @peterdaou Beneath contempt.
889655483891666944 2017-07-24 01:16:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Plus she got hammered by the media. Relentlessly.
889655340450680838 2017-07-24 01:15:36 UTC <gaughran444> @nickwiger @johnbazelnut How lovely.
889653117930942464 2017-07-24 01:06:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Bet you're good when 8 & 10 have nightmares.
889619361761304576 2017-07-24 22:52:38 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy @DabAggin He is an std.
889610163598053377 2017-07-24 22:16:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This move toward Bernie world is a big mistake.

889586742336118789 2017-07-24 20:43:01 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @jimsciutto Meant to avoid some legal conclusion.  I wonder what.
889586171172487169 2017-07-24 20:40:45 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs @jim_newell Drag a sick man back to work to hurt sick people. Ok.
889584305944633344 2017-07-24 20:33:20 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Uh oh. He's blown a gasket.
889583577838616577 2017-07-24 20:30:27 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn I hope so. Ffs.
889583270832336896 2017-07-24 20:29:14 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Getting sick of Chuck.
889542384035524609 2017-07-24 17:46:45 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Even with 9 extra hours and a hundred tv cameras, telling the truth is easier than lying.
889540034080190464 2017-07-24 17:37:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Or etch-a-sketch.
889539861581111296 2017-07-24 17:36:44 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Utter nonsense. Back channel communication with Russia. Nothing proper about it.
889539387918352384 2017-07-24 17:34:51 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt It's taken so many hits over the years and these anti-worker senators want to finish it off. Terrible.
889538392026996736 2017-07-24 17:30:54 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Very strange choice of words.
889532427638640642 2017-07-24 17:07:12 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Haha! You're a riot! Thanks for the chuckle.
889485027280646144 2017-07-24 13:58:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Maybe an interpretative dance will help.
889484122053332993 2017-07-24 13:55:15 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Seriously? This is American Heroes Week? There's at least one person in the WH with a brutal sense of humor.
889483891924402176 2017-07-24 13:54:20 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Merry little tyke. Hope this doesn't upset him. More to come.
889483728740900867 2017-07-24 13:53:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hahaha! You called someone sleazy. A guy with an impeccable reputation. Good one.
889483553922326528 2017-07-24 13:52:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Back off Dr. Death. Americans want OBAMAcare.
889464911352541186 2017-07-24 12:38:54 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Ever inspiring.
889464649619517441 2017-07-24 12:37:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR I don't think White House sincerely distrusts Mueller. They're trying to discredit him because they're rightly scared to death of him.
889464282500476928 2017-07-24 12:36:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @votevets How utterly disgusting. President Bone Spur hurting these brave young people.
889462151596978176 2017-07-24 12:27:57 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw This fucking guy. Nader redux.
889461976841285632 2017-07-24 12:27:15 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Yes and that billion dollar debt part kind of sticks out too.
889461175091703808 2017-07-24 12:24:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @traceygaughran So far.
889461044158107648 2017-07-24 12:23:32 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos So pissed at him. What's his motivation for this bs?
889458943193427968 2017-07-24 12:15:12 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw So relieved!
889458853284335617 2017-07-24 12:14:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @traceygaughran It's a crime to lie to a congressional inquiry even if not under oath. Little bastard is in a tight spot.
889458501780721664 2017-07-24 12:13:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance Yet he seems like an experienced hustler.
889458227909455874 2017-07-24 12:12:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Betterw05759703 @SethAbramson @critic_social Repulsive little bugger. Lying to a congressional inquiry is a crime, under oath or not. Nasty fellow is in a tight spot!
889457733229064192 2017-07-24 12:10:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MyNextLifeDebi @GeorgeTakei It's a new day!
889457637087211521 2017-07-24 12:10:00 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Why is he turning on Dems/Hillary at this point? I don't get it.
889454064689434624 2017-07-24 11:55:48 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 No the real problem is that the president is a delusional, paranoid crook. Fish rots from the head.
889453312378114048 2017-07-24 11:52:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated There will have to be a cleansing ritual complete with burning sage and chanting when he is extracted from the White House.
889452283595026432 2017-07-24 11:48:44 UTC <gaughran444> @bterris One would assume, right?
889448226813825024 2017-07-24 11:32:37 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 A prostitute in an expensive suit.
889447916309540864 2017-07-24 11:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel They want the healthcare for white people. TrumpCare.
889446883101466625 2017-07-24 11:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum The explanation for the attempt at a back channel communication route is ludicrous. Better US/Russia relations than under Obama?!?
889446145025593344 2017-07-24 11:24:20 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 True. But what's his deal writing off the impact of the interference at this juncture? How the hell does he know?
889441987564326912 2017-07-24 11:07:49 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 What's his angle? Why now?
889441034874302469 2017-07-24 11:04:02 UTC <gaughran444> @KatrinaNation @thehill How the hell does he know?
889440534145761281 2017-07-24 11:02:03 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @GeorgeTakei This is a war on the sick and disabled.
889440209930158080 2017-07-24 11:00:45 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Did he actually say that?
889439855868039169 2017-07-24 10:59:21 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 So full of shit. A back channel to make US/Russia relations better than they were under Obama? Ok.
889313935127703553 2017-07-23 02:38:59 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @DavidCornDC 10 minutes? You're being very kind.
889310875089346560 2017-07-23 02:26:49 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood The self-pity of this lucky grifter is stunning.
889310612945350661 2017-07-23 02:25:47 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Love to watch him, despite the sadness. And he owns the little slimy fellow.
889310153509654528 2017-07-23 02:23:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @kids8587 @missnancypants7 @SusaMorgan We need a third party/spoiler hall of fame. Self-involved public menaces.
889302323696209920 2017-07-23 01:52:51 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Atrocious. The degradation of America continues.
889300551346900992 2017-07-23 01:45:48 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Obama crushes this little phony. What we've lost.
889296891946696708 2017-07-23 01:31:16 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Sanders better not count on white women over 40 either. Can't stand him.
889296193414680577 2017-07-23 01:28:29 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your brain is like a lava lamp at this point. You probably can't comprehend too much.
889295930733842433 2017-07-23 01:27:26 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @kids8587 @missnancypants7 Those third party spoilers are just great aren't they?
889294471057338368 2017-07-23 01:21:38 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @KaraCalavera Good for you.
889293686676344834 2017-07-23 01:18:31 UTC <gaughran444> @ktumulty @DeborahKnappTV5 Heartbreaking.
889293581927809024 2017-07-23 01:18:06 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Hell yes. Not my President.
889293392060043264 2017-07-23 01:17:21 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @TopherSpiro Nihilists.
889293107501690880 2017-07-23 01:16:13 UTC <gaughran444> @funder I think when he sees a copy of his unfiled indictment he's going to run from the WH screaming.
889292617527287808 2017-07-23 01:14:16 UTC <gaughran444> @politico So now prostitutes wear suits and ties. Same job.
889292392511266819 2017-07-23 01:13:23 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 I hope they attack back already. Orange albatross.
889292219814957056 2017-07-23 01:12:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Hopefully never to be seen again.
889292144011247616 2017-07-23 01:12:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Good god. What a poor excuse for a human, much less a president.
889291527624810497 2017-07-23 01:09:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Is this that racist from Maine?
889188375172976640 2017-07-23 18:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid What an irrelevant impediment this guy is. Nader redux.
889183912307589120 2017-07-23 18:02:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CORLEBRA777 @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @Lady_Lear @lauriebrenner @lynayerickson @dcpetterson Absolutely.
889148126141042688 2017-07-23 15:40:07 UTC <gaughran444> @seanspicer @Scaramucci @TeaPainUSA @AgneseGandolfo @kpmel Right?
889146309130817537 2017-07-23 15:32:54 UTC <gaughran444> @seanspicer @Scaramucci @TeaPainUSA @AgneseGandolfo Very very good point. NYers have despised trump for decades.
889144241779298304 2017-07-23 15:24:41 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @shannonrwatts Excruciating.
889143791348846593 2017-07-23 15:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood He should pipe down. And have the humility to get a full view of Russian intervention before pronouncing on its limited impact.
889143342558326784 2017-07-23 15:21:07 UTC <gaughran444> @seanspicer @Scaramucci @TeaPainUSA I cringe to think how much the country will hate New Yorkers when this debacle is over. Most of us are honest and not sleazy.
889142927439663110 2017-07-23 15:19:28 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @VABVOX When I was young prostitutes wore different clothes than this guy. Guess the profession is evolving.
889142537570717696 2017-07-23 15:17:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Get in there Eric! A nation turns its sleep-deprived eyes to you.
889142308603670532 2017-07-23 15:17:00 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Two hours is a joke. What's the problem? Does this wunderkind lack stamina?
889142061970186240 2017-07-23 15:16:01 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @EvilGalProds Better idea: blow him out of the water with a rock solid indictment.
889139745980370945 2017-07-23 15:06:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ddale8 I would give something of great value to see Franken imitate Scaramucci. You know he'd be fantastic.
889138793370005506 2017-07-23 15:03:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated As they should. These guys are true patriots who understand what he's done to us. Glad they're speaking up.
889138448476536833 2017-07-23 15:01:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @Normsmusic Good.
889137952684732419 2017-07-23 14:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Ooooooohhh! Love this.
889137123311460353 2017-07-23 14:56:24 UTC <gaughran444> @KrangTNelson If you didn't key this car you should petition for sainthood.
889136936790700032 2017-07-23 14:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @SarahLerner Snotty and also strange while the Russian stuff unspools. How does he know?
889136685417680896 2017-07-23 14:54:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @EricBoehlert But would be kind of fun for old time's sake.
889135328526774272 2017-07-23 14:49:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AspenSecurity @joshtpm @nedprice That's bad news.
889134831468240897 2017-07-23 14:47:17 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @landpsychology By interspersing these lovely posts amidst the political hellstorm I keep my head from blowing off. Thank you!
889134065626099712 2017-07-23 14:44:15 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @maggieNYT @kyletblaine Why's he doing this? Doesn't need the money. Just loves to be in front of the cameras? Just stepped on the deck of the Titanic.
889133447419179009 2017-07-23 14:41:47 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Now we're talking!
889132851819663361 2017-07-23 14:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRevAl @ToddACox @NAACP_LDF That's what it is. Plain and simple. Voter fraud is less common than lighting strikes on people. Voter suppression commission.
889132052016230401 2017-07-23 14:36:15 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Oh dear. He's revolting. I'd make sure I still had my wallet after speaking with him.
889130931424034816 2017-07-23 14:31:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood What's going to save him? The rapture?
889130631808122882 2017-07-23 14:30:36 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @KFILE He sounds like a good citizen with a strong moral compass. Like his boss.
889130228215418880 2017-07-23 14:29:00 UTC <gaughran444> @DerekCressman Good. I hope more republicans join him. It's their duty if they love their country.
889083219412484096 2017-07-23 11:22:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Sorry for your loss. How terrible.
889082944417132544 2017-07-23 11:21:06 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Bone Spur Boy sounds like a nine year old playing with Power Rangers.
888979306550095872 2017-07-22 04:29:17 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump Was deeply stupid of him not to foresee that his unlawful activities would catch up with him as POTUS.
888977495722250240 2017-07-22 04:22:06 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @TrueFactsStated @themanfronUNCLE @lynayerickson @lauriebrenner Yeah blocked him. Was trying to be polite but no point engaging.
888970577335201793 2017-07-22 03:54:36 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Was just about to fall asleep. Now maybe not. Thanks!
888967930544881665 2017-07-22 03:44:05 UTC <gaughran444> @jackkirby @pettazz Could only improve matters.
888965177391161345 2017-07-22 03:33:09 UTC <gaughran444> @lauriebrenner https://verdict.justia.com/amp/2017/07/21/trumps-mueller-scheming-will-fail  This article says decision of AG appealable to fed Ct. but what the hell does John Dean know about this stuff? ;)
888962611529871360 2017-07-22 03:22:57 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Okay. I think our work here is done.
888962287347871744 2017-07-22 03:21:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Does your head spin around like in the exorcist when you write this stuff?
888961422079787008 2017-07-22 03:18:13 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Chill bro. I'm not big on arguing on twitter. Is there a case I can look at? We've both read the reg.
888958627406635008 2017-07-22 03:07:07 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Unless you know of a case where a district court declined jurisdiction on a challenge to the firing of special counsel.
888958236052910080 2017-07-22 03:05:34 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Oh no didn't mean to imply that. I think this stuff is complicated and somewhat unprecedented so we have to wait & see. Reasonable minds etc
888957023517376514 2017-07-22 03:00:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid What a fun, whimsical guy he appears to be. Maybe not the soul of honesty, but so facile.
888956333638258688 2017-07-22 02:58:00 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Ok let's watch it play out. The Lunatic in Chief will probably test it soon enough. Smarter people than you or I will make the call.
888949324373270528 2017-07-22 02:30:09 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @sgrant525 Who writes his crap?
888946698478907392 2017-07-22 02:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE It can be reviewed in a court of law.
888946588638474240 2017-07-22 02:19:17 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Ok then you & I see it differently. Time will tell. Probably not too much time. Crazy face may test it out.
888945893063487488 2017-07-22 02:16:31 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @DebbieRhoden57 So funny.
888943592189952001 2017-07-22 02:07:22 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @themanfronUNCLE Look at the reg. Can be fired by (acting) AG for good cause, and examples are tough.
888937603856289792 2017-07-22 01:43:35 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump So moving Bone Spur Boy! So moving!
888934366784737280 2017-07-22 01:30:43 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @RickResnick @lauriebrenner It's a nonstarter but the Repubs are pushing it.
888932584926916608 2017-07-22 01:23:38 UTC <gaughran444> @BuyReardenMetal Happy to have entertained you. Take a look at the regulation.
888928023063429120 2017-07-22 01:05:30 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @RickResnick @lauriebrenner That's right. It's a first amendment issue.
888927392093417472 2017-07-22 01:03:00 UTC <gaughran444> @lauferlaw @TrueFactsStated @kaysra I hope not. Sickening.
888927160009986048 2017-07-22 01:02:05 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @RickResnick Oh yes they will. 24/7.
888926956200370177 2017-07-22 01:01:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JanetCEarthDwlr No hard to tell. Shouldn't have made a joke - don't want to hurt anyone of course.
888926046346674176 2017-07-22 00:57:39 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @RickResnick That stuff about lawyers giving to Hillary's campaign is a non-starter.
888922380806103041 2017-07-22 00:43:05 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner I think they will amass mountains of evidence. President Scam Artist already talking about pardons. Incredible.
888916540673929217 2017-07-22 00:19:53 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner That's it! Looks like a tough standard right?
888913622839287808 2017-07-22 00:08:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch @lauriebrenner Sure. That's how it looks to me.
888912090353852417 2017-07-22 00:02:12 UTC <gaughran444> @misspinkkate @HelenKennedy Poor guy. That's terrible.
888909579953811457 2017-07-22 23:52:13 UTC <gaughran444> @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @LouiseMensch Look at the special counsel regulation. Can only terminate for "good cause" e.g. dereliction of duty. Written to make sc hard to fire.
888908500675461120 2017-07-22 23:47:56 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @misspinkkate Hope he makes it!
888908421499695105 2017-07-22 23:47:37 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @misspinkkate Oh no!!
888907471728898048 2017-07-22 23:43:51 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner @TheSquireman Mueller I would think.
888907207793922048 2017-07-22 23:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @natalielkelley3 This white woman worked on Hillary's campaign. Before that worked on both of Obama's campaigns, before that Kerry, Gore, etc.
888898548837883905 2017-07-22 23:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @CORLEBRA777 @lynayerickson @TrueFactsStated @lauriebrenner I think the special counsel regulation would ensure that termination of Mueller would be enjoined by a federal court.
888898031155851264 2017-07-22 23:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JanetCEarthDwlr Absolutely. He's a low form of life.
888896826845388800 2017-07-22 23:01:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JanetCEarthDwlr Don't be sorry at all. Sorry to have upset you.
888896072789131265 2017-07-22 22:58:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JanetCEarthDwlr Janet I was being sarcastic. Of course it's appalling. I hope you're okay and am sorry you've been thru so much. Terrible.
888895221072879616 2017-07-22 22:55:10 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @_ShamGod Don't f with Mr Softee. One of the beautiful sounds of summer.
888894780113027073 2017-07-22 22:53:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @JanetCEarthDwlr No no I was kidding. It's grotesque. Even for trump, it's shocking.
888893797949681665 2017-07-22 22:49:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No I was kidding. So on top of everything he's a f'ing pimp?? Out of words for this guy. The mind reels.
888891793172987904 2017-07-22 22:41:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why are you so critical? Can't a guy make a living?
888888179461410816 2017-07-22 22:27:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @StillLes4Hill @JoyAnnReid It's kind of like FDR's fireside chats, right? So reassuring.
888884538889428992 2017-07-22 22:12:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Sick of trump voters sucking off the public teat & endlessly reviling government & the people who pay their bills.
888884197611511809 2017-07-22 22:11:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Horrible to think about but I agree with you.
888883330820845569 2017-07-22 22:07:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Great. Feeling like we should just let this union idea go. Give red states all the guns they want & go our separate ways.  We tried.
888881460026978304 2017-07-22 22:00:29 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow I think he can decode and repeat words - i.e. make speeches - but can't comprehend large blocks of written language. Seriously. No attn span
888880074493231105 2017-07-22 21:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @NinaTotenberg Horrifying.  A birther no less.
888879523814572032 2017-07-22 21:52:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I love a good vocabulary. Such fun.
888879229454213120 2017-07-22 21:51:37 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel A devious trap for the unwary. Rigged.
888878947009798144 2017-07-22 21:50:30 UTC <gaughran444> @finneyk This is ghastly.
888869534551224320 2017-07-22 21:13:06 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro So blue states are supposed to underwrite tax breaks for trump supporters. Fuck that.
888867537148153856 2017-07-22 21:05:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @NorCalGino It's all relative.
888867394504060929 2017-07-22 21:04:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yes I think they want this to be handled as a question of law enforcement rather than politics. Trump is a crook, let the law get him.
888866976000552960 2017-07-22 21:02:56 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM @TeaPainUSA Good. Hope he ends up holding a tin cup out in front of trump tower.
888866765438169089 2017-07-22 21:02:05 UTC <gaughran444> @BruceBartlett The blue states should cut the red states off. Enough already.
888866457098100737 2017-07-22 21:00:52 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @JoshMeyerDC Patriots.
888862234977370113 2017-07-22 20:44:05 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @JoyAnnReid Firing him could also add to an obstruction charge.
888820752895664128 2017-07-22 17:59:15 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @jaketapper @Scaramucci Full transparency and working for trump. Good one!
888814782681317376 2017-07-22 17:35:32 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman Deadly serious issue but that is funny.
888804917091205120 2017-07-22 16:56:20 UTC <gaughran444> @KeithOlbermann Bone Spur Boy. What an inspiration.
888804529944371200 2017-07-22 16:54:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @iteachgovt Perfect.
888801996895129600 2017-07-22 16:44:43 UTC <gaughran444> @SopanDeb Yes but must keep checking.
888800525885591552 2017-07-22 16:38:53 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes, and wouldn't a SOL only apply to charges brought? Don't think they limit scope of investigation re background etc.
888795374307201024 2017-07-22 16:18:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC O'Connell, legislative genius.
888795137136091136 2017-07-22 16:17:28 UTC <gaughran444> @LaptopShopWH Bezos bought the Post so tinybrow thinks that's a wicked putdown.
888794800459272192 2017-07-22 16:16:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Choo! Choo!
888794340134449152 2017-07-22 16:14:18 UTC <gaughran444> @Blackamazon Yes and we know that pantywaist trump is gonna get his ass kicked. Can't wait.
888793635453534210 2017-07-22 16:11:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Agree. Get turnout from real democrats and skip these people.
888793445237743616 2017-07-22 16:10:44 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @jaketapper Little darling.
888785841736355840 2017-07-22 15:40:32 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Dude you'd look awesome in acid washed jeans. And you should resign.
888785603491504128 2017-07-22 15:39:35 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali @Lennard_lenn Ok we're probably not going to agree on politics. But I like your dog! Great little face.
888784017469919232 2017-07-22 15:33:17 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali His eloquence is inspiring.
888783633909252098 2017-07-22 15:31:45 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill Don't get any ideas, Donnie!
888782043164925956 2017-07-22 15:25:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow Such an uplifting image! Thanks Malcolm!
888781682890944513 2017-07-22 15:24:00 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Someone should give him one of those toy light sabers so he can feel powerful and safe.
888781179117285376 2017-07-22 15:22:00 UTC <gaughran444> @lasesana @funder What's with all the revisions? You're not allowed to lie on these forms.
888780851978403840 2017-07-22 15:20:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @HeartMommy Oh yes.
888780130696540160 2017-07-22 15:17:50 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Oh so sad. He was great.
888777836395474945 2017-07-22 15:08:43 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper For one brief shining moment that was known as Made in America week.
888776774821318658 2017-07-22 15:04:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson What????
888776631204143107 2017-07-22 15:03:56 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Barbaric. Although would be fun to see trump tower grabbed.
888776439239258112 2017-07-22 15:03:10 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Guessing piles of dough to Russians.
888775829156761601 2017-07-22 15:00:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh shit. Thumbs up comrade!
888775418966409216 2017-07-22 14:59:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thanks Claude. Enjoy the art show. Hope they turn trump tower into a homeless shelter.
888755300026789889 2017-07-22 13:39:10 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump They must love hanging with a draft dodger, Bone Spur Boy.
888754738501742592 2017-07-22 13:36:56 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos I think he's a coward.
888754010022449152 2017-07-22 13:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Exactly. Used to watch cutler do trials. A faux gangster. Worked with juries.
888753548489621504 2017-07-22 13:32:12 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Not even close.
888753045835829249 2017-07-22 13:30:13 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @TinaMcGugan Probably similar to acid-washed jeans. Those were cool.
888752192127107072 2017-07-22 13:26:49 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc It will be very hard for trump to fire Mueller because the regulation says can only fire special counsel for good cause. Won't have it.
888746411797467136 2017-07-22 13:03:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak Bummer.
888745838650036224 2017-07-22 13:01:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 So guilty and so primitive. Cannot shut up.
888745672626909189 2017-07-22 13:00:55 UTC <gaughran444> @detroitpolice @donnabrazile @TheRoot Go Chief Hall!
888744924425969669 2017-07-22 12:57:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He just can't quit her.
888741943219539968 2017-07-22 12:46:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak He has flagrantly broken the law with his lies on federal security clearance forms.
888740915489230848 2017-07-22 12:42:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Haha. No one is asking that except the guilty guy at the center of the investigation.
888740528250122240 2017-07-22 12:40:28 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Resign and let your feverish hamster wheel of a brain rest.
888739623945601028 2017-07-22 12:36:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak @SalenaZito Les tweets c'est moi.
888739394517164033 2017-07-22 12:35:58 UTC <gaughran444> @just_security Very interesting.
888738915275997184 2017-07-22 12:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump If you resign maybe you can keep whatever money you have. Ask your lawyer.
888738284771434496 2017-07-22 12:31:33 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Ask your lawyer if the investigation will be called off if you resign. Might work and you could golf more!
888515402220789760 2017-07-21 21:45:54 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind He's with Jimmy Hoffa.
888515165364387840 2017-07-21 21:44:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes he did. He's been disappointing recently but let's give him a chance. He has shown epic patriotism and bravery in the past.
888497809728647168 2017-07-21 20:35:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Scaramucci @TrueFactsStated Don't block. Let's see if he starts talking to you.
888488991288414209 2017-07-21 20:00:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Oh that's promising.
888488774774255617 2017-07-21 20:00:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SecretaryRoss @pdacosta He's dreadful. Would love to see him swept up in this mess.
888480761766170624 2017-07-21 19:28:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TPM @tripgabriel @Applebome Oh good. So he's a man of principle.
888479236847263744 2017-07-21 19:22:11 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro They are astonishing. They don't give a hoot in hell about our country. And he's a wrecking ball.
888478685312974848 2017-07-21 19:20:00 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @MJGerson @SenJohnMcCain Senator, the nation wishes you all the best and turns to you to lead your party. Please tap into the bravery that you're known for.
888478112224333824 2017-07-21 19:17:43 UTC <gaughran444> @VP You're spitting some crazy rhymes my friend.
888477651396112385 2017-07-21 19:15:53 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken No it looks like they were very much in on it.
888477502372446209 2017-07-21 19:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Gonna need some really good meds to last 12-18 months. I'm talking about me, not him.
888476874862678016 2017-07-21 19:12:48 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Wish he'd stroke out. And I will not apologize if it happens. He's ripping our country to shreds. He will fail but it's just brutal.
888462949085577220 2017-07-21 18:17:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @SpeedReads That would fit on a red hat, right?
888462479701016580 2017-07-21 18:15:36 UTC <gaughran444> @DerekCressman Can you imagine if a bunch of women acted like this? Everybody would be grumbling about hormonal problems.
888462217066270722 2017-07-21 18:14:34 UTC <gaughran444> @nickconfessore She looks delightful.
888462022278606849 2017-07-21 18:13:47 UTC <gaughran444> @jaredkushner @Scaramucci @pdacosta Nooooooooooooo.
888461525916241921 2017-07-21 18:11:49 UTC <gaughran444> @mitchellreports @mmurraypolitics Good to hear!!! Thank you for telling us. Please ask your colleagues to do the same.
888455340756529153 2017-07-21 17:47:14 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing @davidminpdx Horrible.
888454815394746369 2017-07-21 17:45:09 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Hope you go down in this investigation too. Years of you at the helm will be hard to bear.
888439453991219201 2017-07-21 16:44:06 UTC <gaughran444> @SRuhle @KatyTurNBC Jesus this White House feels like a really bad soap opera. I'm so eager to be bored again.
888438945914077184 2017-07-21 16:42:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. Think the courts will save us based on the applicable regulations. Pray that this is so.
888438607056338944 2017-07-21 16:40:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That'll teach you.
888435420765224961 2017-07-21 16:28:05 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You can't legally fire Mueller. Don't try it. Maybe they'll call off the investigation if you resign. Think about it. More time for golf.
888424117019521024 2017-07-21 15:43:10 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Yes it's really blatant. Just awful.
888423778748964864 2017-07-21 15:41:49 UTC <gaughran444> @aravosis @ericgeller @Resisting2016 Yes you do. Sorry.
888423494236635136 2017-07-21 15:40:41 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @ericgeller The great divide between the good and the don't bother with people.
888414862363308032 2017-07-21 15:06:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Lawrence Why choose?
888414743454777346 2017-07-21 15:05:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Jfc.
888414548729974784 2017-07-21 15:05:09 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn They have to speak louder.
888414251865563137 2017-07-21 15:03:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Your resolve to do what? Cut healthcare? Cut taxes on the rich? Look the other way from the crime ring in the White House?
888413650628874240 2017-07-21 15:01:34 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @JoyAnnReid Not like a boss. Like a two-bit underling. Not smart or quiet enough to be a boss.
888412894714572800 2017-07-21 14:58:34 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @Katalyst1964 I know. I've been really mad at him but of course wish him the best with his illness. But he has been extraordinarily brave in the past.
888393870513496065 2017-07-21 13:42:58 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @MaryMarybrogdon I so hope so.
888387287268175872 2017-07-21 13:16:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson What are those bucking horses you can ride in bars? He just sat on one.
888386871113515009 2017-07-21 13:15:10 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @Katalyst1964 That's how I've seen him too. Hoping with his health imperiled he might just be emboldened. Pure conjecture but he can be very brave.
888386448650620929 2017-07-21 13:13:29 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Will a single republican endorse this?
888386331101081600 2017-07-21 13:13:01 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @frogcycle Sad but true. Actually beyond sad. Horrifying.
888385530035146753 2017-07-21 13:09:50 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Ffs. Disgusting.
888383365002539009 2017-07-21 13:01:14 UTC <gaughran444> @nickconfessore @BCAppelbaum Because it had that black guy's name in it.
888383075205472257 2017-07-21 13:00:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson These are difficult times. Wish that would happen once per week. We all need a little pick me up.
888380696083013632 2017-07-21 12:50:37 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I have this fantasy that McCain will decide this is a bridge too far and will tell the republicans it's time to stand up for their country.
888380105340444676 2017-07-21 12:48:17 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie They didn't realize it helped nice white people like them, too. Now they're all for it.
888379761889824768 2017-07-21 12:46:55 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt But they can then be compelled to testify, won't be able to invoke 5th amendment protection bc no criminal jeopardy.
888375496026841088 2017-07-21 12:29:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Rick if Trump fires Mueller will that be a bridge too far for the republican senators? Is anything?
888375116597473286 2017-07-21 12:28:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. That was a bit demure. Get the lead out, Nancy.
888374869691387904 2017-07-21 12:27:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers White.
888374817161957377 2017-07-21 12:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro No question.
888374473883308034 2017-07-21 12:25:54 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw And he must have some sense of what they'll find, which is making him crazier than usual.
888373480865005570 2017-07-21 12:21:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I imagine he also knows what will be found and is scared shitless. This is going to get very ugly.
888372847206432768 2017-07-21 12:19:26 UTC <gaughran444> @froomkin President as cornered animal. This should go well.
888372459891720192 2017-07-21 12:17:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood It's been swell.
888372331147603968 2017-07-21 12:17:23 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Feels better to be a self-appointed provocateur than a common criminal.
888371611170164738 2017-07-21 12:14:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson They look like a bad Easter parade.
888308153452036096 2017-07-21 08:02:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @davidchapman141 @NickWes84032384 You're right.
888242462392819712 2017-07-20 03:41:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Yes but wouldn't you concede that we have a rapidly changing landscape?
888241737793241088 2017-07-20 03:38:27 UTC <gaughran444> @yonatanzunger This is the nightmare part. If they cared enough about their country . . .
888241511497969664 2017-07-20 03:37:33 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Looks like there's a dial tone in that head.
888241284829335553 2017-07-20 03:36:39 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @samcox Very cute.
888241067220488192 2017-07-20 03:35:47 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel These guys are all screamers. The decibel level must be astounding.
888240800248844288 2017-07-20 03:34:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Don't fire Mueller. That will be your undoing.
888240350913015809 2017-07-20 03:32:57 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @walterdellinger I'm in.
888237842559893504 2017-07-20 03:22:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Don't think it will fly. Hopefully he'll cave and resign before all that.
888235515279015936 2017-07-20 03:13:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @AriFleischer Props to any and all republicans who make this point.
888235328707997696 2017-07-20 03:12:59 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell It doesn't. Courts have ruled on this.
888234809167949826 2017-07-20 03:10:55 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Ok. See you there.
888234699293904896 2017-07-20 03:10:29 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean So is Las Vegas.
888234628049502210 2017-07-20 03:10:12 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Nixon on steroids. And crack.
888234297290883072 2017-07-20 03:08:53 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy These tax returns must be the Rosetta Stone of the trump criminal enterprise.
888233657902800896 2017-07-20 03:06:21 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara I love Preet unplugged.
888233211104460806 2017-07-20 03:04:34 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara How about a former independent U.S. Attorney who now teaches at N.Y.U. Law?
888232331252813829 2017-07-20 03:01:04 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Or you can go on Fox.
888227937283182592 2017-07-20 02:43:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @davidchapman141 No no no.
888227569602105344 2017-07-20 02:42:09 UTC <gaughran444> @blakehounshell He probably didn't either. His brain is a lava lamp.
888227390639542272 2017-07-20 02:41:27 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh ffs. Pipe down, curley.
888226885955661824 2017-07-20 02:39:26 UTC <gaughran444> @jdawsey1 Whatever gave him the impression he'd be getting the truth?
888224784525516800 2017-07-20 02:31:05 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko No. They're killing it.
888224691617452032 2017-07-20 02:30:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @PreetBharara Not sure how many principled republicans there are. We'll find out, I'm afraid.
888223961041047552 2017-07-20 02:27:49 UTC <gaughran444> @jaloysius And he was a financial Boy Scout compared to trump
888223370885693440 2017-07-20 02:25:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Wow. Guilty as sin. Maybe someone should grab their passports.
888220599423782912 2017-07-20 02:14:27 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Oh no no no. These fools will never do.
888219060458205191 2017-07-20 02:08:20 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMorett @aliasvaughn @Qwarktastic2 @accidntlmystic @AUkeibro @Well_RN Don't worry about their efforts to diminish the investigation. Pure bullshit. Really. Courts have held political contributions ok.
888191682579234821 2017-07-20 00:19:33 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie Very kind.
888191536512552961 2017-07-20 00:18:58 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt He should be picked up by police asap.
888189752733831169 2017-07-20 00:11:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @educator_mc Poor little you. Scary and sad time right?
888189394494115840 2017-07-20 00:10:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Got it. Another wonderful Christian. Thanks.
888188967220281344 2017-07-20 00:08:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Oh. I see.
888188570799935491 2017-07-20 00:07:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Ok thanks. Seems a little puritanical. Unless he makes a big deal out of being Christian etc.
888187325733318656 2017-07-20 00:02:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Oh damn! I was sitting in a tree, age 4, and our babysitter said, "The president has been shot, you must come down." So I did.
888186355922206721 2017-07-20 23:58:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Why do people care about this?
888186128930680832 2017-07-20 23:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @bravenak Can't stand him.
888184860141121538 2017-07-20 23:52:26 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @JaneGrader I always wish the animal had gotten the hunter first.
888184259734904833 2017-07-20 23:50:03 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @armandodkos Kennedy assassination. Because I'm ancient.
888184084362559488 2017-07-20 23:49:22 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 No we're not because that was a mistake and now is the time to wish him well.
888183861456379907 2017-07-20 23:48:28 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Disgusting.
888182311476490241 2017-07-20 23:42:19 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @paulkrugman Not me brother.
888181611312943104 2017-07-20 23:39:32 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @JaneGrader Smart! I'll never tell.
888178536896450563 2017-07-20 23:27:19 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @JaneGrader I still miss tokens. Cool looking and worked every time.
888176840237514754 2017-07-20 23:20:34 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen I like a nice hyperbolic lie, don't you?
888176659790278657 2017-07-20 23:19:51 UTC <gaughran444> @hunterw @traceygaughran @YahooNews How could they? Her make-up is perfect!
888176413660119040 2017-07-20 23:18:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia You've got a strong constitution. I'm sure they couldn't.
888176280956436482 2017-07-20 23:18:21 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMorett @aliasvaughn @Qwarktastic2 @accidntlmystic @AUkeibro I so hope so. Who are the patriots? I worry about DT's high ratings with republicans. Will enough members of congress do the right thing?
888175940714598400 2017-07-20 23:17:00 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia Ah. Sorry you had to grow up with that.
888171100982706182 2017-07-20 22:57:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MarkSZaidEsq @thehill Prayer group?
888171023442616320 2017-07-20 22:57:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MarkSZaidEsq @USATODAY Smart broad.
888170883663237120 2017-07-20 22:56:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMorett @aliasvaughn @Qwarktastic2 @AUkeibro @accidntlmystic Yes but not sure it would fire up congress. This is worrisome.
888170618297995264 2017-07-20 22:55:51 UTC <gaughran444> @politico And with that assurance and a metro card you can take the subway.
888170368019648512 2017-07-20 22:54:51 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump And we are asking you to resign, for the love of God, while America is still in one piece.
888170117707726853 2017-07-20 22:53:52 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You strange and deceitful man. This sounds like the bs the Chinese used to proclaim about Chairman Mao.
888169569986203648 2017-07-20 22:51:41 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie My brain would not hear of it.
888169453338447876 2017-07-20 22:51:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia Yes quite futile, as you point out.
888169345364504578 2017-07-20 22:50:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia Oh no! Where were you?
888157302607548416 2017-07-20 22:02:56 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Here's hoping.
888157079420243968 2017-07-20 22:02:03 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia If you were older you'd have had them in school. Crouching under desks to prepare for Russian bombs. We knew it was dumb.
888155027780636672 2017-07-20 21:53:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AnaGasteyer @JohnDeVore Gotta be trump on the right. Gaudier.
888148273973874690 2017-07-20 21:27:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @boyndog Not so faint.
888147402171011073 2017-07-20 21:23:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia @TheRickWilson I could not understand any algebra and I've had a good life.
888146988776251392 2017-07-20 21:21:57 UTC <gaughran444> @NRA @JaneGrader @BrettArends That is terrible.
888146697666297860 2017-07-20 21:20:48 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Poetry in motion.
888146313606508544 2017-07-20 21:19:16 UTC <gaughran444> @CBSNews This is precisely what we work and pay taxes for, no?
888121951075553284 2017-07-20 19:42:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Just don't piss him off, should be ok. He's so busy looking for the real killer.
888121677984317441 2017-07-20 19:41:23 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @SenJohnMcCain Good news! Americans of both parties will be very glad to see you back.
888121314543718400 2017-07-20 19:39:56 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Perhaps because he's dishonest and crazy.
888121006199525386 2017-07-20 19:38:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson They should put him on that voter fraud commission. He can look for fraudulent voters and the real killer at the same time.
888120622072582145 2017-07-20 19:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Haha. Your stand-up routine is getting better and better.
888096880827277312 2017-07-20 18:02:51 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel You might want to put some Tylenol aside.
888096670801686530 2017-07-20 18:02:01 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Don't think they're fond of crazy, belligerent draft-dodgers.
888084644326977536 2017-07-20 17:14:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR What??
888084289417609217 2017-07-20 17:12:49 UTC <gaughran444> @WSJ @Susan_Hennessey I've eaten there. Very meh.
888022244777222144 2017-07-20 13:06:16 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @MattGertz Let's arrange a nice big one for the day he resigns. Fireworks, tanks, the whole shebang.
888020985374441474 2017-07-20 13:01:16 UTC <gaughran444> @lulublitzer @PaulBegala That's a slim reed to rely upon. Is there a brave soul among them?
888020641512816640 2017-07-20 12:59:54 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Now he's got to man up and identify himself. Embolden others. Fight for our country.
888020268916117504 2017-07-20 12:58:25 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He understands nothing.
888017538512191489 2017-07-20 12:47:34 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell No question about it.
888016664880713729 2017-07-20 12:44:06 UTC <gaughran444> Deeply unsettling to say the least.https://lawfareblog.com/president-vs-federal-law-enforcement-trump-attacks-everyone
888012704702713856 2017-07-20 12:28:21 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @nytmike @PhilipRucker @peterbakernyt But if trump knew the contents were false where was the threat?
888011837815619586 2017-07-20 12:24:55 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Ultimately he can have two charges of obstruction of justice, for Comey and Mueller. All of which he announced in the press.
887883678038151169 2017-07-19 03:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @KatyTurNBC Second obstruction of justice charge. Exhibit A.
887883229121830914 2017-07-19 03:53:52 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy Has he been studying law? He seems to know all the elements of an obstruction of justice charge.
887882699683225600 2017-07-19 03:51:46 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Absolute dignity.
887874603149918209 2017-07-19 03:19:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JulianCastro @yashar Dignity and decency.
887873931885019137 2017-07-19 03:16:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AnneCoh21763276 @JoyAnnReid @deg2 Dear god.
887870175046971393 2017-07-19 03:02:00 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy @funder What an aberrant, twisted man. How on earth was he permitted to infect and debase our country?
887869390892544000 2017-07-19 02:58:53 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump We are.
887869234377871360 2017-07-19 02:58:15 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @JohnJHarwood @MaxBoot Feel the same about McCain. Terrible news but good to be reminded of the American family, where we can disagree and respect each other.
887868704301645824 2017-07-19 02:56:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MeghanMcCain @cindymccain @SenJohnMcCain @FranTownsend Oh yes. Remember this vividly. A moment of total integrity. In such short supply these days. So sorry about this news.
887867880674648064 2017-07-19 02:52:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Thank you. Needed some good news tonight.
887866106509176832 2017-07-19 02:45:50 UTC <gaughran444> @fordm @seanhannity You're white noise. For real.
887854748128485381 2017-07-19 02:00:42 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @Aruadha Now that's a good idea.
887850092065157125 2017-07-19 01:42:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Class tells.
887849116855926784 2017-07-19 01:38:19 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama Love and miss you Mr. President.
887846094679552000 2017-07-19 01:26:19 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball @MSNBC Sad news. Poor guy.
887824508719173632 2017-07-19 00:00:32 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 But if its contents are not true where's the leverage?
887811697083330561 2017-07-19 23:09:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thank you. Thought it was just me.
887811351841824768 2017-07-19 23:08:15 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara If he's subpoenaed he has to take the 5th right? Can't just blow it off or contempt.
887810673367019520 2017-07-19 23:05:33 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorDurbin @hardball I think the crime is going to be pretty impressive this time.
887810083119398914 2017-07-19 23:03:13 UTC <gaughran444> @EricLiptonNYT @susannecraig Big shoe waiting to drop: how much $ does Trump owe the Russians? Enough to do whatever he's told?
887802653908111360 2017-07-19 22:33:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @ReutersUS Of course. Cowardly racist.
887801577804877825 2017-07-19 22:29:25 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JohnFugelsang Depends on who is listening.
887801063058931716 2017-07-19 22:27:22 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Yes.
887800299615694849 2017-07-19 22:24:20 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC I think Mueller will let us know.
887783068060323840 2017-07-19 21:15:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson The war on drugs is, and has always been, a dismal failure.
887777829190021120 2017-07-19 20:55:03 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Death penalty? Civil forfeiture?
887773673360379905 2017-07-19 20:38:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Beclownment is a wonderful word.
887773518213120001 2017-07-19 20:37:55 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Can we grab Trump Tower as collateral now?
887764786934681600 2017-07-19 20:03:13 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 He'll skip it.
887764727300018177 2017-07-19 20:02:59 UTC <gaughran444> @GemmaKaneko @RachelAsher1 But sounds super cool. Sorry to have missed it.
887758464738615300 2017-07-19 19:38:06 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Out of his mind. It's dangerous.
887758356571705344 2017-07-19 19:37:40 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer On our dime.
887758292428173315 2017-07-19 19:37:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No doubt about it. Terrible menace.
887758175616851968 2017-07-19 19:36:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump As usual you are inaccurate and sound insane.
887752210767073280 2017-07-19 19:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Or an illness.
887728241888440321 2017-07-19 17:38:00 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball Except for the Golf Exception which is actually in the Constitution.
887726106782126081 2017-07-19 17:29:31 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Always knew history would be very kind to him. Didn't know how quickly it would happen.
887721182811885569 2017-07-19 17:09:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Dangerous imbecile.
887689585781862401 2017-07-19 15:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien @danafowlefox5 Adolescence will be fun.
887689366172295168 2017-07-19 15:03:32 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Damn that pesky first amendment. Could be a problem.

887642440332652545 2017-07-19 11:57:04 UTC <gaughran444> @rtraister @TheRoot Disgraceful.
887639874299461635 2017-07-19 11:46:52 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT @meslackman Yes. When my son was one years old he clearly thought teletubbies were with him. Nice that trump has this comfort too.
887634171526606848 2017-07-19 11:24:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @Newsweek Potentially enormous news. And thank goodness for this little girl
887633341679382528 2017-07-19 11:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @StCollinson @CNNPolitics Maybe they should find a new line of work
887506066149396480 2017-07-18 02:55:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated My autocorrect still changes fuck to duck. At this late date.
887504969674489856 2017-07-18 02:50:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @kylegriffin1 These guys remind me of the Founding Fathers. The closely held principals. The idealism. The eloquence.
887495343717445633 2017-07-18 02:12:33 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Did he crush any children to do it?
887495084492689409 2017-07-18 02:11:31 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @RepAdamSchiff It's a living.
887492035816697856 2017-07-18 01:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He can take his hatred of Obama with him to prison. It will keep him warm at night.
887491233630879744 2017-07-18 01:56:13 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Not a clue. All the stuff about the master distractor is nonsense. He's about as deliberate as paramecium on a slide.
887488279985127424 2017-07-18 01:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Yamiche Obama's legacy is being burnished by this imbecile. Our last legitimate president looks better every day.
887487757475606528 2017-07-18 01:42:24 UTC <gaughran444> @EricLiptonNYT He's a fungus. Nothing is unmarred by his touch.
887487338741465089 2017-07-18 01:40:44 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Don't forget golf.
887486590238547968 2017-07-18 01:37:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Hope you're feeling better.
887486058719576064 2017-07-18 01:35:39 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @RepJoeKennedy He's a real trailblazer, this guy.
887485882483318784 2017-07-18 01:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @leftyjennyc I think I hear Susan Collins vomiting in a corner. Or is that Obama?
887484208343646208 2017-07-18 01:28:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheNLJ @Tonymauro Great to hear. How's Ruth?
887478677285588993 2017-07-18 01:06:19 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @costareports I thought he was in a fire truck.
887476862401884161 2017-07-18 00:59:07 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews Love Al.
887450222300934144 2017-07-18 23:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColumbiaLaw Yes! Thank you Professor. Love it when people who are smarter than I am agree with me.
887449935108603905 2017-07-18 23:12:07 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @NBCNightlyNews He seemed like a decent guy and shouldn't associate with this crime ring. His call.
887449193039765504 2017-07-18 23:09:10 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP @teresa_dryden Haha. You know nothing about my religious beliefs. But good luck to you anyway.
887396726314762242 2017-07-18 19:40:41 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Wow. That would be cool.
887392886622482433 2017-07-18 19:25:25 UTC <gaughran444> @politico But their ties are pretty. Great statesmen.
887391214789591040 2017-07-18 19:18:47 UTC <gaughran444> @clairecmc America is getting a brutal crash course in the benefits of participatory democracy. Hopefully remembered in 2018 and 2020.
887390017429139456 2017-07-18 19:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox Wow. One confused hombre.
887389786197164032 2017-07-18 19:13:06 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter That is the goal.
887388599011901441 2017-07-18 19:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Yes. It's called legislating. Congress did it on a bi-partisan basis for years. Highly effective.
887387792803860481 2017-07-18 19:05:11 UTC <gaughran444> @SHSanders45 @AprilDRyan @ZekeJMiller Wow. Anything goes. Truth means nothing.
887387425965735936 2017-07-18 19:03:43 UTC <gaughran444> @mkraju @mikiebarb @edatpost The stolen seat. How pathetic.
887382262681133056 2017-07-18 18:43:12 UTC <gaughran444> @benwikler @johnlegend And it's not going to happen. Obama's legacy is secure not matter what this fool does.
887377784519233536 2017-07-18 18:25:25 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Extremely interesting.
887377532009533440 2017-07-18 18:24:24 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt As he looms larger on the horizon we've got to reckon with him. Terrible guy. Not psychotic like his boss but truly terrible.
887377059747688448 2017-07-18 18:22:32 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF Excellent!! Good luck!
887342301575602176 2017-07-18 16:04:25 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson He's right. White people loved oj because he kissed their behinds.
887321429737451526 2017-07-18 14:41:29 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Actually it's the GOP that's collapsing.
887320924843909122 2017-07-18 14:39:28 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Impressive how quickly you're bouncing back from last attempt to extinguish the poor.
887320749190643713 2017-07-18 14:38:46 UTC <gaughran444> @Pontifex Viva Papa!
887303004654895106 2017-07-18 13:28:16 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Senatorial procedure is so tricky! Who knew?
887300849235628032 2017-07-18 13:19:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Because you can't blame the black guy all the time. Have to mix it up a little.
887300634298507264 2017-07-18 13:18:51 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 This is likely to crush him, no?
887300351543660544 2017-07-18 13:17:43 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP I'm becoming fixated on how repulsive you are. Must stop. Think we'll be seeing a lot more of you soon.
887299991341076480 2017-07-18 13:16:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Do they even talk to him or does he just watch tv? Sounds wildly dysfunctional.
887298358561443840 2017-07-18 13:09:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @AynRandPaulRyan It's always the black guy's fault. Or the crooked, scheming woman's fault. Always.
887291960196771840 2017-07-18 12:44:23 UTC <gaughran444> @lasesana Not me.
887291881431998464 2017-07-18 12:44:04 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You're a nice combination of Eddie Haskell and Satan.
887290902556889089 2017-07-18 12:40:10 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Poignant.
887290570254798848 2017-07-18 12:38:51 UTC <gaughran444> @StevenTDennis Yes McCain described a functioning legislature. A shocking proposal at this point.
887290005747576833 2017-07-18 12:36:37 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 A small, garbled mind.
887289586422091781 2017-07-18 12:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Wonder what those numbers looked like under Obama.  The sane president thing is pretty soothing.
887145038190436352 2017-07-17 03:00:34 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump A legislative genius!
887144817448415237 2017-07-17 02:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood I hope he cries himself to sleep. All those children cured. All those grandmas tended to.
887138462062845952 2017-07-17 02:34:26 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He'll be more effective which is not good given his goals, but he probably won't blow up the world. That would be better.
887132077543628801 2017-07-17 02:09:04 UTC <gaughran444> @ktumulty @GlennKesslerWP No he likes gangsters and traitors.
887131887063453696 2017-07-17 02:08:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JerryMoran Good man!
887131819753312256 2017-07-17 02:08:02 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @SenMikeLee Good man!
887130624145981440 2017-07-17 02:03:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That's one big ass rat jumping off the ship.
887125452644593667 2017-07-17 01:42:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Exactly. Amend comprehensive legislation, as is always necessary. Stop posturing on our dime and do what they're paid for.
887123109823885312 2017-07-17 01:33:25 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You're like a fortune cookie from hell.
887109402423066625 2017-07-17 00:38:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How is this legal? By which I mean I don't think it is.
887109083505057794 2017-07-17 00:37:41 UTC <gaughran444> @RubenGallego Their dad was just as brave and helpful in Vietnam.
887108311413403648 2017-07-17 00:34:37 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc The geyser of lies is amazing. Hour after hour.
887108121998618625 2017-07-17 00:33:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan You're the worst, and the competition is stiff.
887060078150418436 2017-07-17 21:22:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @politico Crusty voice? Vaguely repellant and meaningless.
887059799728324608 2017-07-17 21:21:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Lucian_Kim What?
887059585911185413 2017-07-17 21:21:00 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Seriously? Don?
887036029680615429 2017-07-17 19:47:24 UTC <gaughran444> @actblue @AngusKing2018 @decaro_nick @SuMoh7 Really good guy.
887035060528046080 2017-07-17 19:43:33 UTC <gaughran444> @BillClinton @SophieInCT @CNN Lincoln, FDR, JFK, Obama.
886907656392380417 2017-07-17 11:17:17 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Disgraceful. Another low point.
886782113927897088 2017-07-16 02:58:26 UTC <gaughran444> @Green_Footballs @JumpTheRework @Carle_tt You're right. Criminality and chaos.
886779579540570112 2017-07-16 02:48:21 UTC <gaughran444> @mmmm1026 Absolutely.
886779074915557378 2017-07-16 02:46:21 UTC <gaughran444> @politico By which she means toothless and wholly ineffectual. Not good.
886776411192774657 2017-07-16 02:35:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SkyLaser3 I think he could veto it. What a shitshow that would be.
886776162692849664 2017-07-16 02:34:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I think they're going to show him his unfiled indictment and he's going to run out of the White House screaming.
886775305771388928 2017-07-16 02:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I hope so. Have so little faith in the Repubs.
886774490725797888 2017-07-16 02:28:08 UTC <gaughran444> @LisaHauser8 @MrDane1982 Even firebrands have to slow down sometimes. You rest and I hope you're much better soon.
886774233166225408 2017-07-16 02:27:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I do too. Silver lining: he will create an ironclad obstruction of justice charge by doing so.
886773345781526528 2017-07-16 02:23:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @LisaHauser8 Feel better young man! Sleep the sleep of the just.
886772958362034178 2017-07-16 02:22:03 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Maybe she can ride on the hood next time.
886772674801930241 2017-07-16 02:20:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How has Mueller prepared? What can we do? I think crazy mofo will fire him.
886772376662401024 2017-07-16 02:19:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Duly elected representatives from two American parties contesting ideas - aka democracy - would be divine.
886763688002244610 2017-07-16 01:45:13 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @thehill A real voter fraud commission would focus on this.
886763403393544193 2017-07-16 01:44:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @LarrySabato If the republicans could show some patriotism and courage they might save their party. If they can't good riddance.
886760485202391040 2017-07-16 01:32:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorCollins @MalcolmNance @jaketapper @JaneGrader Absolutely. Are any repub men standing with her?
886759041724284928 2017-07-16 01:26:45 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorCollins @MalcolmNance @jaketapper Go Senator Collins! Country first!
886757680358072320 2017-07-16 01:21:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Ha!
886756691152437250 2017-07-16 01:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MalcolmNance @POLITICOMag A terrible blast from the past.
886755961565835265 2017-07-16 01:14:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's the "You're Body is a Wonderland" guy. Meh.
886744481038565376 2017-07-16 00:28:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur Yes. There was an underlying assumption of basic decency. Will need new laws and regs when Dems take back Congress.
886743987037622278 2017-07-16 00:26:56 UTC <gaughran444> @USGA @realDonaldTrump You vary from wholly irrelevant to a menace. Truly terrible president.
886743249733472256 2017-07-16 00:24:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile @MazMHussain Yes. Fuck Ann Coulter.
886741625296257024 2017-07-16 00:17:32 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Now this is interesting.
886740689467432960 2017-07-16 00:13:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JohnJHarwood They are anti-science, anti-fact, anti-truth.
886739781958479872 2017-07-16 00:10:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Green_Footballs Calls himself the law and order president, routinely attacks law enforcement, intelligence, etc. who risk theirs lives to protect him.
886729539006738433 2017-07-16 23:29:31 UTC <gaughran444> @AttyDeniseBrown She wasn't a real judge was she? Repulsive woman. And seems to have some kind of buzz on during her program.
886728805347360769 2017-07-16 23:26:36 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @philthadelphian Good point.
886637815412531200 2017-07-16 17:25:02 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Very worst president in the history of our country. A correlation perhaps?
886637566199463937 2017-07-16 17:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Legally problematic. Grifting fools.
886637345101033474 2017-07-16 17:23:10 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @BettyBowers Seriously. What's the deal with her speech? Too much collagen in lips to enunciate?
886636499680321536 2017-07-16 17:19:49 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Tell us about your military service o fearless leader.
886630232651902976 2017-07-16 16:54:54 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump They have two speeds - 1. Blame Obama. 2. Blame Hillary.
886620310526730244 2017-07-16 16:15:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Perseverative POS.
886619529757028354 2017-07-16 16:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR There should be loan forgiveness for public school teachers. If we give a hoot about public education.
886619069213966336 2017-07-16 16:10:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AshleyRParker Not to be confused with "Made In Russia" day - 11/8/16.
886617965113864192 2017-07-16 16:06:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ABC So the American people are not brain dead. Just the republicans in congress. #TrumpRussia
886617508341587968 2017-07-16 16:04:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @DafnaLinzer Good for her. Now she should get the lead out on #TrumpRussia
886617160033894402 2017-07-16 16:02:58 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Uh-oh.
886613447491940352 2017-07-16 15:48:13 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Funny tweet from you.
886610694786961408 2017-07-16 15:37:16 UTC <gaughran444> @VanityFair @TheRickWilson @KBAndersen The short-fingered vulgarian was wrong again.
886610338313011201 2017-07-16 15:35:51 UTC <gaughran444> @daveweigel @mattyglesias @ThePlumLineGS Rs are not patriots. Don't mind our democracy being compromised by an enemy state.
886608702723305472 2017-07-16 15:29:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind To know him is to abhor him.
886607910578606080 2017-07-16 15:26:12 UTC <gaughran444> @ThisWeekABC SS there to protect president elect & family from harm, not to prevent trump & co from breaking the law.
886248209886171136 2017-07-15 15:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Please. We've lost too much. Not this too.
886247894726172673 2017-07-15 15:35:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Fantastic Keith! Made my morning. People will be digging themselves out of their own graves!
886247655747309568 2017-07-15 15:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @BeschlossDC Am I the only one who feels sad looking at pictures of almost every president other than trump? How degraded we've become. For now.
886246943357378560 2017-07-15 15:31:51 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @DMRDynamics Pence is a stone cold liar. Look at his dead eyes while he speaks. Not a clinical view, but it's creepy as hell.
886245489477287937 2017-07-15 15:26:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro If I couldn't vent at Ryan, Trump, Pence et al. on twitter I would probably be apprehended for road rage. It has to go somewhere.
886244997519089666 2017-07-15 15:24:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I know. I do have faith that there will be an avalanche of evidence. We all just have to live to see it.
886228547848765440 2017-07-15 14:18:45 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy I think he's such a stone cold liar that he doesn't even know when he's lying.
886228355573575680 2017-07-15 14:17:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro That's how they see it but the law will ultimately bring them down. Their arrogance and stupidity won't help.
886226315866779648 2017-07-15 14:09:53 UTC <gaughran444> @politico As well as basic decency.
886226147582803970 2017-07-15 14:09:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Hope he does. Wasn't he the genius behind the Comey firing?
886225517489401857 2017-07-15 14:06:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I joined twitter just to tell him to go fuck himself. Still do, but my repertoire has expanded.
886218646875492352 2017-07-15 13:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Thanks. Can you take a look at our electoral system being infiltrated by an enemy state?
886214889806737409 2017-07-15 13:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 This is preposterous and probably shouldn't be dignified with a response but might be good to see some scientists kick ass on this issue.
886047834868416512 2017-07-14 02:20:40 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH Great when US AG has utter contempt for the rule of law.
886047541955002368 2017-07-14 02:19:30 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @deg2 It really is the little jerk himself? Insane.
886047194364686337 2017-07-14 02:18:07 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld @DonaldJTrumpJr @deg2 Yes but until then better if these Imbeciles keep yakking. Who knows that they'll say next?
886040438754422784 2017-07-14 01:51:17 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia The words "competent and effective pols" are becoming alien to the English language. But I see your point.
886036029479804934 2017-07-14 01:33:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson No pants necessary. Just don't get up.
886035151003766785 2017-07-14 01:30:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Our fearless leader is a stoned college freshman philosophizing in the student lounge at 3:00 a.m.
886031279757697024 2017-07-14 01:14:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @TrueFactsStated What a lovely analogy. Maybe we have  nothing to fear but fear itself.
885973766219628544 2017-07-14 21:26:21 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 So hope so.
885973440796274692 2017-07-14 21:25:03 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @ReproRights Birth control foes in 2017. Surreal.
885972803337560070 2017-07-14 21:22:31 UTC <gaughran444> @WH_Visitor_Log @politico Any auto-translation from the original Russian?
885972581735698432 2017-07-14 21:21:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @maxbergmann Has been an aesthetic crime scene for years. But yes, now it's the real thing.
885949903486287872 2017-07-14 19:51:31 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @AishaS Good omen! Save it! And welcome aboard to your husband.
885949748452237313 2017-07-14 19:50:54 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Who writes this crap? Cool visual of you in an iron.
885948824463736832 2017-07-14 19:47:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Isikoff @BraddJaffy That's big news. Wow.
885948727118241792 2017-07-14 19:46:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @critic_social Let me know if you find one. :)
885948455138578432 2017-07-14 19:45:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Maybe trump's fans can trade in those MAGA hats for one of these.
885916726088654848 2017-07-14 17:39:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Yes depressing. Like sitting next to relative with dementia at thanksgiving. Nod politely and hope it ends quickly.
885914889172209664 2017-07-14 17:32:23 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Oh god. Fighting urge to click on this. Will be depressing.
885914354385858560 2017-07-14 17:30:16 UTC <gaughran444> @NatlGovsAssoc @VP Did you meet with Russians? Talk about that not this bullshit.
885891106029883393 2017-07-14 15:57:53 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Good. Now how about defending our country against Russia you quisling?
885879297810026496 2017-07-14 15:10:58 UTC <gaughran444> @kfc The mashed potatoes look like Trump.
885879123796779008 2017-07-14 15:10:16 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox Intricacies? How about the basic framework?
885855583429156864 2017-07-14 13:36:44 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics What a dumb and dangerous idea.
885852898520969221 2017-07-14 13:26:04 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Yes everyone trying to decide if this is sufficient for criminal charges. There will be much more to work with.
885852313893654528 2017-07-14 13:23:44 UTC <gaughran444> @AprilDRyan Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas.
885851904848343044 2017-07-14 13:22:07 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Did you meet with Russians too?
885851302370127872 2017-07-14 13:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan They'll be imperiled if your brutal healthcare legislation passes.
885844042084491264 2017-07-14 12:50:52 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Trump, Kasowitz, Stone, etc. Geriatric gangstas.
885698583974076416 2017-07-13 03:12:52 UTC <gaughran444> @splcenter It's a serious problem.
885698209556856833 2017-07-13 03:11:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Bonnie & Clyde. Thieves too, just more honest about it.
885697391344717824 2017-07-13 03:08:08 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt You'd have to be insane to represent this guy. Either way get the money up front.
885684114724179970 2017-07-13 02:15:22 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @HawaiiDelilah He's terrible. And we're stuck with him for decades. And there's a line of people just like him ready for KennedyGinsburg to go.
885683580281790464 2017-07-13 02:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Go Nita! Keep pushing against the #DoNothingGOP
885682967149981701 2017-07-13 02:10:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @TinaMcGugan He's a gem.
885638028307423233 2017-07-13 23:12:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Jesus. Feel like our country is being drowned in hot dirty French fry oil.
885634820407209984 2017-07-13 22:59:30 UTC <gaughran444> @EmmanuelMacron @realDonaldTrump You spoke to his wife like she was livestock.
885597851765669889 2017-07-13 20:32:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @AaronBlake Primitive fool.
885597601822846976 2017-07-13 20:31:36 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn And so sexist. What does he think she is, livestock?
885586573106049024 2017-07-13 19:47:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sounds like the musings of a stoned not-too-bright kid sitting on a dorm hallway floor at 3 am. This has to stop.
885579672272162821 2017-07-13 19:20:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum @JaneGrader @BarksandWreck I thought that was Pence.
885573261370818560 2017-07-13 18:54:53 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Wonderful! Good luck! So exciting.
885571426132140034 2017-07-13 18:47:35 UTC <gaughran444> @WaysandMeansGOP @SpeakerRyan Stop attacking healthcare and man up about Russia.
885571088264171520 2017-07-13 18:46:15 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Are you having a baby?
885557740940255233 2017-07-13 17:53:12 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Hope he's okay. Love him.
885556775323398147 2017-07-13 17:49:22 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @thehill I would give a toe.  At least.
885550574866976769 2017-07-13 17:24:44 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @cotton_candy28 Oh that's awful. Wow.
885549904654995456 2017-07-13 17:22:04 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali If only his words meant something.
885548961792237568 2017-07-13 17:18:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @LauraKi1117 No it will be brutal. Obstructionist with no respect for democracy.
885546960723341313 2017-07-13 17:10:22 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Yes!
885546362036736000 2017-07-13 17:08:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated McConnell will have a special place in history.
885546173074944001 2017-07-13 17:07:14 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 There's a ton of blue water between France and America. Most people don't know that.
885543027745452032 2017-07-13 16:54:45 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Insane.
885542541583687680 2017-07-13 16:52:49 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @rebeccaballhaus Oh ffs. Primitive clod.
885542237580480512 2017-07-13 16:51:36 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @deg2 It needs to be said. Over and over.
885542018008702977 2017-07-13 16:50:44 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 The truth feels like cool water in a desert. What a relief. Hope a single republican leader can do the same.
885538472710295557 2017-07-13 16:36:39 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Looks like vitiligo. Leave him alone.
885537558775693312 2017-07-13 16:33:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Maybe you can drown a few grandmas while you're out there. Save Medicare $$.
885537191941812224 2017-07-13 16:31:33 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Tell it Nancy.
885520134672191488 2017-07-13 15:23:46 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Who t f does he think he is? We're not looking into his love life. He's the gddnned AG of the United States.

885519065883848705 2017-07-13 15:19:32 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor This is a psychological issue. Trying to make something longer.
885469429345263616 2017-07-13 12:02:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How awful. I'm sorry.

885466899903119361 2017-07-13 11:52:14 UTC <gaughran444> @mckaycoppins @Rainmaker1973 How exquisite.
885466344392675328 2017-07-13 11:50:02 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes. Isn't that what the big one eats?
885465912505229312 2017-07-13 11:48:19 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @kylegriffin1 Which says what? That Obama DOJ was in on it? I don't think so.
885464894098862086 2017-07-13 11:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Baffling. Really don't get it. Do they serve KFC at that restaurant?
885464417474891776 2017-07-13 11:42:22 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes - this is baffling. Why the hell would he invite him?
885460991282163712 2017-07-13 11:28:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Absolutely. And I hope they make a pile of dough off the movie deal. They deserve a big break after all this.
885459479793414145 2017-07-13 11:22:45 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Any chance you could speak for yourself? What do you think about #TrumpRussia?
885351213172228097 2017-07-12 04:12:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Haha. Good one.
885350944942239744 2017-07-12 04:11:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheCounterTV @AdrianCJax @JKH2 Done.
885344084663169024 2017-07-12 03:44:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ElSKuhn Sorry, we have an urgent voter fraud problem to deal with first.
885339848164478977 2017-07-12 03:27:23 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @jdawsey1 Unamerican. We will fight.
885339666936942593 2017-07-12 03:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz No it should not. This is constitutional law masturbation.

885335332438380544 2017-07-12 03:09:26 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey @kairyssdal And morally reprehensible and totally unAmerican.

885323325907636228 2017-07-12 02:21:44 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak @Eviljohna The country is on fire and he's all about himself. Great.
885320103331586048 2017-07-12 02:08:55 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak @Eviljohna Please.
885308244322811904 2017-07-12 01:21:48 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Trump has made the country safe for haters. But keep notes. You never know.
885294858591752192 2017-07-12 00:28:36 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @JohnCornyn Wow. Brazen bullshit. Putin wanted trump, and got him. Hillary called Putin out from day one. We all heard her.

885290413933940736 2017-07-12 00:10:57 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @ReignOfApril @Ntheforest It also has to be said because without white support there would be no trump. And he won by trashing minorities.
885289710133940224 2017-07-12 00:08:09 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon This is news?
885287491418324992 2017-07-12 23:59:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram This crap started w Reagan. First amendment be damned. Only serious Christian modern pres was Carter, who never pushed it on anyone.
885286671281008640 2017-07-12 23:56:04 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce I love Preet unplugged.
885274228760641537 2017-07-12 23:06:38 UTC <gaughran444> @VP The remarkable thing is your utter comfort with lying.
885274021008429057 2017-07-12 23:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR As it should, given the penalties.
885272642781138944 2017-07-12 23:00:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Haha! Good point.
885272002193494019 2017-07-12 22:57:47 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Says the man who interacts exclusively with craven miscreants.
885271642695401472 2017-07-12 22:56:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Just his soul.
885270472149127170 2017-07-12 22:51:42 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @MattMurph24 But they say God and prayer a lot so they're better people.
885269246833569794 2017-07-12 22:46:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson So why didn't they subpoena him to testify?
885256466550190080 2017-07-12 21:56:03 UTC <gaughran444> @politico So much responsibility, so little vocabulary.
885256338665766912 2017-07-12 21:55:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Not for this sanctimonious fraud.
885255960096382977 2017-07-12 21:54:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Are you over 40? If so start keeping a log. Or tweet everything this little douche says.
885253487520604160 2017-07-12 21:44:13 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @RepMcSally @JoeKeene @Indivisible_SAZ @BelmarCPA No no. But he's such a fiery dude he can't be alone with a woman. So he says.
885253241495318528 2017-07-12 21:43:14 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Your tweets today are hilarous in light of reality. Thanks for the laugh!
885219255989522434 2017-07-12 19:28:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 @critic_social Thank you!
885216596960169984 2017-07-12 19:17:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 @critic_social In my father's eulogy I pointed out that he was a good, life-long democrat. Just to be clear so he went to the right venue for eternity.
885215476028248065 2017-07-12 19:13:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 They will never admit it.
885215174118047744 2017-07-12 19:11:58 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @docrocktex26 Is this a joke?
885206361193185280 2017-07-12 18:36:57 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @RepMcSally @JoeKeene @Indivisible_SAZ Is this policy so that VP Pence is not overcome with irrepressible heterosexual lust? That's a problem for him.
885199642702622724 2017-07-12 18:10:15 UTC <gaughran444> @RuadhanIT Dammit not eligible.
885198436483694592 2017-07-12 18:05:28 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yeah, and so far there's nothing to see. Not a thing.
885197610834964482 2017-07-12 18:02:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @ABCPolitics Now we're talking. Though I guess he'll be taking the 5th a lot.
885196736905576452 2017-07-12 17:58:42 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush Ah, logic. A quaint notion from the good old days.
885196585646403589 2017-07-12 17:58:06 UTC <gaughran444> @BenjySarlin Ryan is an invertebrate.
885179455660019712 2017-07-12 16:50:02 UTC <gaughran444> @NRDC @beccabluesky73 Jesus.
885164616527089664 2017-07-12 15:51:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TuckerCarlson @HelenKennedy @KatzOnEarth Peters did a good job.
885164241099075584 2017-07-12 15:49:35 UTC <gaughran444> @Wrenogranite @TeaPainUSA Done.
885163883656343552 2017-07-12 15:48:10 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Christ I hope so.
885163595381833728 2017-07-12 15:47:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @LittleMissFlint It's almost physically painful to watch this stuff.  What we lost.
885163451366215683 2017-07-12 15:46:27 UTC <gaughran444> @Independent @MattMurph24 @SafetyPinDaily Grotesque.
885163255324389376 2017-07-12 15:45:40 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes How about never? Does never work?
885163182456807426 2017-07-12 15:45:22 UTC <gaughran444> @robdelaney @SenSanders Everyone knows this. Any reaction to Russia?
885162504481120256 2017-07-12 15:42:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan We want law enforcement to have every possible resource at their disposal to fight the growing #TrumpRussia problem in America.
885140828972306432 2017-07-12 14:16:33 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Wait. What?
885140517176172544 2017-07-12 14:15:19 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @danpfeiffer @matthewamiller No conflict there.
885140447202553856 2017-07-12 14:15:02 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @danpfeiffer @matthewamiller No c
885140152334643200 2017-07-12 14:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Seems entirely consistent with his total dysfunction.  He's a weak, impaired guy in a very tough job. Terrible combination.
885139277440528384 2017-07-12 14:10:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaxBoot @kylegriffin1 Where they deserve to be.
885139113925627904 2017-07-12 14:09:44 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Is this part of a stand up act? Funny.
885136787311661056 2017-07-12 14:00:29 UTC <gaughran444> @NRDC So horrible. What does this mean?
885136691106906113 2017-07-12 14:00:06 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko While thinking "did I really go to law school to do this shit?"
885136128231211008 2017-07-12 13:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @NormOrnstein Or Elliot Richardson? The present day republicans are pathetic and not patriots.
885135529557336065 2017-07-12 13:55:29 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker @MaryDram @BraddJaffy This is a first in American history. Debates on how much tube the POTUS watches. So pathetic. Yet another low point.
885135080515096576 2017-07-12 13:53:42 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT If you cared about your work being his lawyer would be a nightmare. If you didn't, just get paid upfront and let it ride.
885134858175090688 2017-07-12 13:52:49 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Dear god. Give that man a little TV time!
885133785242750981 2017-07-12 13:48:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump So the Russian thing is no biggie, right?
885133460574273537 2017-07-12 13:47:16 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump How degrading that you feel the need to say this. Never mind that, like most of what you say, it's clearly false.
885133094939963393 2017-07-12 13:45:49 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker Does he dress in the morning? None of my business just wondering.
885132606693683200 2017-07-12 13:43:53 UTC <gaughran444> @AGSchneiderman @NYGovCuomo @funder Interesting idea.
885132334852395008 2017-07-12 13:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Hopefully not those crappy ivanka shoes.
885130794636902400 2017-07-12 13:36:41 UTC <gaughran444> @McFaul By FBI so that false statements are a crime.
885130652676501505 2017-07-12 13:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Spoken like a true wannabe dictator. Or a simpleton. Or both.
885130410912616449 2017-07-12 13:35:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Last night tiny brow said he'd probably spoken to other Russians. Right? Time will tell.
885130075921936384 2017-07-12 13:33:49 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc College was fun and easy. Ready to go back.
885129998365061120 2017-07-12 13:33:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So I was hoping. Everyone's going nuts trying to determine if that one meeting was unlawful. It's probably just a predicate for much more.
885129747277197312 2017-07-12 13:32:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A perfect task for his steel trap mind and even temperament.  This should go well.
885129527592189952 2017-07-12 13:31:38 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Any thoughts on the felonious White House? Any concern about the rule of law? Or are you too busy ripping healthcare from the vulnerable?
885129271416672257 2017-07-12 13:30:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You could probably arrange for total clemency if you walked away now. Think of all that time for golf and watching tv!
885071684021231616 2017-07-12 09:41:47 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian Disgusting.
884989125950152704 2017-07-11 04:13:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Fuck Russia.
884973634653220864 2017-07-11 03:12:11 UTC <gaughran444> @ReutersPolitics Maybe he can Skype in from prison next year.
884968024704417792 2017-07-11 02:49:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Cool face.
884967609204178945 2017-07-11 02:48:14 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule Is that their new tag line? Heard they dropped fair & balanced.
884967445844328448 2017-07-11 02:47:35 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @SethAbramson Watched that too. What a bunch of bullshit.
884967302856400897 2017-07-11 02:47:01 UTC <gaughran444> @passantino Oh boy. Can't wait to see what this wily master of understatement means by this.
884965939434967040 2017-07-11 02:41:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Really. What a grisly, degraded group.
884964394416865282 2017-07-11 02:35:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Yeah they don't like to rush to judgment.
884964198073217026 2017-07-11 02:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Our political system is broken, as one party is devoid of patriotism or accountability. This has to be dealt with as a legal matter.
884963189548621824 2017-07-11 02:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @TinaMcGugan Very good point. Our checks and balances are broken other than the courts.
884960572277706752 2017-07-11 02:20:16 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @TinaMcGugan Good point. Disaster.  But look at us, had loads of time to get a load of trump. Wish there were a mechanism to vote again.
884959688244252673 2017-07-11 02:16:46 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Clever. Keep modeling yourself on Nixon, young fellow. That turned out well.
884959341887074304 2017-07-11 02:15:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @thehill Yes like the 10 Plagues of Egypt. Boils, hail, locusts, etc.
884958525142728708 2017-07-11 02:12:08 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @AdrianCJax Right? Where did the self-appointed messiah go? Not that I miss him.
884958146883715073 2017-07-11 02:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy I caved at the last minute. Couldn't do it.
884957923348271106 2017-07-11 02:09:45 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @TinaMcGugan I always thought so. Although these days I've been wondering . . .
884955998649286656 2017-07-11 02:02:06 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @TinaMcGugan Other countries have interim elections triggered by events (e.g. England) but we don't.
884955122140418048 2017-07-11 01:58:37 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @TinaMcGugan I think trump is too insane to stay in office. His incompetence is great but his impulsivity could get us killed.
884945802631815168 2017-07-11 01:21:35 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc I don't think there is and I think we get Pence. He's dreadful and will destroy the Supreme Court but may not blow up the world.
884945483063586816 2017-07-11 01:20:19 UTC <gaughran444> @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOPSenFinance @senorrinhatch @WaysandMeansGOP @RepKevinBrady @WhiteHouse @SpeakerRyan Hey chicken. Can you manage any reaction to the Traitor in Chief?
884926440185225216 2017-07-11 00:04:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Morning_Joe @MaryMarybrogdon @kylegriffin1 And he's a circumspect professional.
884925578624860161 2017-07-11 00:01:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak So was Nixon.
884925312156524545 2017-07-11 00:00:10 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Big whoop.
884924452324159489 2017-07-11 23:56:45 UTC <gaughran444> @brianklaas Look in the dictionary under "brass balls."
884923889398239233 2017-07-11 23:54:30 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum They're doing it to themselves. They can still cut and run but they don't.
884907167647662080 2017-07-11 22:48:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko @GlazerRandee Witness protection program?
884888794679451648 2017-07-11 21:35:03 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics How is this news?
884888587006877696 2017-07-11 21:34:14 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @BraddJaffy The great popcorn shortage of 2017.
884886516237053952 2017-07-11 21:26:00 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Haha! Now you're all concerned about slavery? How about treason? How about Medicaid for the elderly and disabled? You're too much!
884886027273371648 2017-07-11 21:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Wouldn't be surprised.
884884386923106304 2017-07-11 21:17:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson It's true? The world is a wonderful place.
884883909535834113 2017-07-11 21:15:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @SarahLerner Maxine Waters said so too.
884883367845613568 2017-07-11 21:13:29 UTC <gaughran444> @splcenter Is this who Sessions is meeting with? Disgraceful.
884882758488788994 2017-07-11 21:11:04 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Your president is a treasonous menace. Any response?
884881886480392192 2017-07-11 21:07:36 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak Great. While the country is on fire. Can't stand him.
884880502427197440 2017-07-11 21:02:06 UTC <gaughran444> @bravenak Where is ol' Bernie these days anyway?
884880362047983617 2017-07-11 21:01:33 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Subpoenas?
884879472083828736 2017-07-11 20:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Okay that's not good but any reaction to the implosion of the White House?
884872277921345537 2017-07-11 20:29:25 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT @mogaffney @janefmorris @MSNBC @noradunn Probably popping Xanax. Might have candy bowls of it in the White House.
884871139734024192 2017-07-11 20:24:54 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell Not too late. Indictments will probably say conspiracy.
884870582780792833 2017-07-11 20:22:41 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Pantywaist.
884870460890021889 2017-07-11 20:22:12 UTC <gaughran444> @rezaaslan It's been such a tough time. We need to heal as a nation. We deserve the pee pee tape.
884869833741004801 2017-07-11 20:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @politico What happened? Heart attack?
884869734621216768 2017-07-11 20:19:19 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 It's like the old Goofus and Gallant cartoon in Highlights magazine.
884869528756383747 2017-07-11 20:18:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @JoyAnnReid When do we retire the term "nothingburger"?
884869157489135620 2017-07-11 20:17:01 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich You sure you want to keep doing this? Can't you retire or something?
884848875026231296 2017-07-11 18:56:26 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Seriously??? That's actually funny.
884848516648095745 2017-07-11 18:55:00 UTC <gaughran444> @adamgoldmanNYT Carry on!!
884848331343757312 2017-07-11 18:54:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Anyone else's face hurt from smiling so much? Haven't been this happy since before 11/8/16.
884848017727213568 2017-07-11 18:53:01 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Cut the guy a break. He's got grandmas to kill.
884847813988941824 2017-07-11 18:52:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Like he forgot to send a thank you note.
884847527874494464 2017-07-11 18:51:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No. A sea of jellyfish.
884827781271629825 2017-07-11 17:32:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes, their arrogance is only matched by their stunning incompetence. Very helpful
884826812093784065 2017-07-11 17:28:45 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Commenting on someone's weight is a big no-no. This is serious criminal activity.
884818141129433089 2017-07-11 16:54:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @JYSexton Thank you!
884817985067724800 2017-07-11 16:53:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @JYSexton @IrisL49 I'm still blown away that one of our two parties doesn't care. We grew up with Russia as our enemy. Clearly they still are.
884817431872622593 2017-07-11 16:51:29 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Right.  We're moving from the political sphere to the legal system.
884815068868771845 2017-07-11 16:42:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Motherfucker has 5 kids and his wife is pregnant. It was never about orphans.
884813433669070848 2017-07-11 16:35:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Absolutely. Peeing prostitutes more fun but this will do.
884813258913402880 2017-07-11 16:34:54 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Yeah, but what do you know about this kind of thing?
884812297499275265 2017-07-11 16:31:05 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 And hubris, greed, disrespect for the law and blinding stupidity.
884811850990444545 2017-07-11 16:29:18 UTC <gaughran444> @Kamgirl47 @IrisL49 And the bar is high.
884804536816336897 2017-07-11 16:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou We care. We care. We care.
884804332029435908 2017-07-11 15:59:26 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Bubble, bubble toil and trouble.
884804233740111873 2017-07-11 15:59:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Don't even think about what would have happened if Obama had pulled this shit. Too upsetting.
884804039954882560 2017-07-11 15:58:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Haha! Poignant!
884803869347385344 2017-07-11 15:57:35 UTC <gaughran444> @aliasvaughn @TrueFactsStated @MJCrispino Thanks.
884802838353903616 2017-07-11 15:53:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 If they don't get off their asses now the answer is yes.
884802670116163584 2017-07-11 15:52:50 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Defies belief.
884802500821475329 2017-07-11 15:52:09 UTC <gaughran444> I want to see a picture of Hillary walking through the woods with a giant gin & tonic.
884802187188211714 2017-07-11 15:50:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @hardball Problematic. What a brave and forthright statesman.
884798752611020800 2017-07-11 15:37:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @anamariecox Is his lawyer locked in a closet? Wtf is going on??
884798614618484736 2017-07-11 15:36:43 UTC <gaughran444> @aliasvaughn @MJCrispino @TrueFactsStated Release what??
884798438684188672 2017-07-11 15:36:01 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Hold on. He himself is tweeting this? Some kind of legal death wish?
884798163730784256 2017-07-11 15:34:55 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Christmas in July.
884798062513803265 2017-07-11 15:34:31 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 If? Get the lead out Lindsey. Time to locate that spine and love of country if they exist.
884797632614469632 2017-07-11 15:32:49 UTC <gaughran444> @RyanLizza Depends where your loyalties are.
884797439252860928 2017-07-11 15:32:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 That is disgusting.
884797281844830208 2017-07-11 15:31:25 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner Yes but not holding my breath. They care about their power, not our country, not our countrymen.
884797007545733120 2017-07-11 15:30:19 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @wendyphd Same. Looks like a duck, walks like a duck, etc.
884766177318383617 2017-07-11 13:27:49 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy The carter kids, the bush kids, the Obama kids, the Reagan kids. None of them.
884765960166662144 2017-07-11 13:26:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @jimsciutto Now it's liar v liar. Time to put people under oath.
884762823225737216 2017-07-11 13:14:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It's kind of wonderful that trump & co are not too bright. Unlike the investigators.
884760380681183233 2017-07-11 13:04:47 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes The aggramatical insults cut the deepest.
884759744921182208 2017-07-11 13:02:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Imbeciles.
884759373859491842 2017-07-11 13:00:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Thank god. About to have third cup. Cheers!
884759219320311809 2017-07-11 13:00:10 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Is there a decent patriot among them who will do this?
884757722343895044 2017-07-11 12:54:13 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes And thank you for doing it. So helpful.
884757509365542913 2017-07-11 12:53:22 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @christinawilkie Wow. Talk about playing hardball.
884756258548568064 2017-07-11 12:48:24 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated At least the Gambinos keep quiet.
884737667933646848 2017-07-11 11:34:32 UTC <gaughran444> @Interior @ShaunKing @NRDC Thank you!
884737234225831936 2017-07-11 11:32:48 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Unless he finally listened to lawyers telling him to stfu.
884736478999441409 2017-07-11 11:29:48 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @aussiehowie Her contribution on that issue has been immeasurable.
884736278767468544 2017-07-11 11:29:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Good point.
884734854344192000 2017-07-11 11:23:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Wonder where she'll go, and with whom. Imagine paparazzi shots of her animated and smiling with a normal man in the south of France.
884733594815672321 2017-07-11 11:18:21 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Merrick Garland.
884732510860718081 2017-07-11 11:14:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Haha! Oh to be a fly on the golden wall.
884731989600940034 2017-07-11 11:11:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It seriously is. This is the brutal price of civic disengagement. Low voter turnout, low information voters. Searing lessons for all.
884731265173397505 2017-07-11 11:09:05 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Thanksgiving dinner should be fun for this family.
884730358499078144 2017-07-11 11:05:29 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends Merrick Garland.
884612088408272896 2017-07-10 03:15:31 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @yashar Yes he does.
884611231038017541 2017-07-10 03:12:07 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @chrisgeidner They actually call this voter suppression drive the Election Integrity Commission? Orwellian.
884606078125834240 2017-07-10 02:51:38 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom @rezaaslan Clever fellow.
884603455201062912 2017-07-10 02:41:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel When it's all over there should be a monument to him in DC, complete with blowing dollar bills.
884602721483051009 2017-07-10 02:38:18 UTC <gaughran444> @Lawrence Wow. A little whiff of character there. What happened?
884592793406013440 2017-07-10 01:58:51 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Almost Shakespearean without the nice language.
884589851143786496 2017-07-10 01:47:10 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes He looks nice.pic.twitter.com/2LkMMogxSI
884589173218398208 2017-07-10 01:44:28 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox He'll be speaking in tongues. Could be very funky.
884586845958549504 2017-07-10 01:35:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @KeithOlbermann Look in the dictionary under clusterfuck. Nice family portrait.
884586069227958272 2017-07-10 01:32:08 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel The wheel turns.
884585767976271872 2017-07-10 01:30:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @traceygaughran @RogueCPI What grossness is this?
884585131578716160 2017-07-10 01:28:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Are you serious?
884584887252111360 2017-07-10 01:27:26 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Where's the candy gram? Let's do this!
884584750211620864 2017-07-10 01:26:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum So so so good.
884584615180201985 2017-07-10 01:26:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Big, big, big.
884584431926771712 2017-07-10 01:25:38 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @TrueFactsStated Go Claude! You're killing it!
884579859174916097 2017-07-10 01:07:27 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum Are you doing penance for something? Can't you just wear a hair shirt or walk on nails?
884579306344722433 2017-07-10 01:05:15 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel @Megs_WYSIWYG Congratulations!

884575922329964544 2017-07-10 00:51:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics They will do nothing to help the resulting unwanted children. Post utero life doesn't interest this crowd.

884567741054803968 2017-07-10 00:19:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh damn! The hits keep on coming.
884566593539371009 2017-07-10 00:14:45 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Lie are hard to keep in order.

884562114752516096 2017-07-10 23:56:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris @Pontifex @joanwalsh Had the same thought.
884561409388023809 2017-07-10 23:54:09 UTC <gaughran444> @ShaunKing Looks like a distinguished fellow.
884544220018733056 2017-07-10 22:45:50 UTC <gaughran444> @FBI @MattAsherS Petty and legally questionable behavior by this administration? Not a chance.
884543823195623424 2017-07-10 22:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @JoyAnnReid First task: get our government back. Second task: pass a law prohibiting use of the word "nothingburger."
884543478335778817 2017-07-10 22:42:53 UTC <gaughran444> @StevenTDennis @JaneGrader @JenniferJJacobs Good idea. How about a subpoena?
884543100617666560 2017-07-10 22:41:23 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Agree. They're supposed to be normal, decent people. And yet they do nothing when their country is on fire. Not a patriot among them.
884542835256684545 2017-07-10 22:40:20 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @JaneGrader He's so creepy he actually scares me.

884513143438880769 2017-07-10 20:42:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Could be a good weight loss method.
884510643486953473 2017-07-10 20:32:25 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost These are certainly not legal defenses. A bunch of bullshit.
884472684440170498 2017-07-10 18:01:35 UTC <gaughran444> @seanhannity That's what angry gorillas do. He can't help it.
884471890210942981 2017-07-10 17:58:25 UTC <gaughran444> @tedlieu As a mother I'd say the same thing.
884464215112732672 2017-07-10 17:27:56 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Would like or will subpoena

884460401328615425 2017-07-10 17:12:46 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Not a chance. He would have been shredded. HRC had to lay off him so as not to piss off his petulant followers. She still beat him.
884460089041702913 2017-07-10 17:11:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sorry Claude.

884394377665273856 2017-07-10 12:50:25 UTC <gaughran444> @francescah28 Want to throw a roast beef sandwich at her. A tootsie roll. Anything.
884394229501448194 2017-07-10 12:49:50 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Such a nice fellow. Hope he's not disappointed.
884393933287174144 2017-07-10 12:48:39 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush @nytpolitics Because he's delusional. Was a low point in American history.
884389212035928064 2017-07-10 12:29:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT She should stick with stealing shoe designs.

884387708218617857 2017-07-10 12:23:55 UTC <gaughran444> @elongreen Perfect. Performatively upset.
884387510436208640 2017-07-10 12:23:08 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis Always listen to your dog.
884387224414040064 2017-07-10 12:22:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It says on the face of those forms that you're breaking federal law if you fail to disclose info. Hard to miss. Tends to jog the memory.
884384928770785281 2017-07-10 12:12:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Yes. Because he's lying. By now lawyers have duct taped his mouth shut.
884384182755102720 2017-07-10 12:09:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Beautiful new healthcare bill. Sounds like a car salesman.
884383699638398976 2017-07-10 12:07:59 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Facile, stone cold liars.
884383374105817088 2017-07-10 12:06:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos That's right. And what we'll do to NK is "very bad" and "very serious." His verbal options are narrowing.
884382824123518978 2017-07-10 12:04:30 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Looks that way. ??
884380752372277250 2017-07-10 11:56:17 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Desperate men and capital letters. Good times.
884380607404548097 2017-07-10 11:55:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Can you please pull the plug on this whole mess before it gets worse? Has anyone explained to you that it's going to get much worse?
884380332337893377 2017-07-10 11:54:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Amended? Does she think those forms are little constitutions? They cite what law you're breaking if you lie on them - hard to miss.
884252259588157441 2017-07-09 03:25:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @PaulBegala @JeffreyGoldberg Gloves off.

884155923031371776 2017-07-09 21:02:53 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @sistermarie3 I understand. But this is very very good.

884144018841534464 2017-07-09 20:15:35 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Okay. This is a line of defective people. Some moral glitch there. Passed along. And along.

884142123477585922 2017-07-09 20:08:03 UTC <gaughran444> @DerekCressman Yes he lied. Family trait.

884140664874815488 2017-07-09 20:02:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate @saralivadeas @robertjones212 Okay, perhaps not.

884139405266608129 2017-07-09 19:57:15 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Trump voters finally realized Obamacare helps good white people like them, too. Oops!
884138248955678720 2017-07-09 19:52:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @nadabakos This seems deadly serious. Anyone in our whole goddamned govt going to do anything?
884136883718107136 2017-07-09 19:47:14 UTC <gaughran444> @RepTomSuozzi @SenGillibrand Excellent idea.

884136231759687680 2017-07-09 19:44:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur A tiny, quiet explosion.

884135368026664960 2017-07-09 19:41:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Is it me or are we seeing more courage from women than men in politics these days?
884135152473055232 2017-07-09 19:40:21 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH This little varmint has 5 kids.  Makes sense that he's looking for more.
884134552079409152 2017-07-09 19:37:58 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt @RepAdamSchiff That's what a traitor does.

884130940741660676 2017-07-09 19:23:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Trump is clearly beholden to Putin and can't defy him in any way. But what excuse do the republicans have? Where are the patriots?
884045788090966016 2017-07-09 13:45:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile That's right. Hot air.
884044344436695040 2017-07-09 13:39:31 UTC <gaughran444> @MyNextLifeDebi @PalmerReport Repellant but at this point the more rats the better.
884043962159423488 2017-07-09 13:37:59 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @BraddJaffy Then you've got the wrong president Lindsey. Care to do anything about it?
884043683678613505 2017-07-09 13:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Scared of his boss.
884043492242206720 2017-07-09 13:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Time to get him the hell out of the White House.
884041839808065536 2017-07-09 13:29:33 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @MSNBC @MeetThePress A blind spot or obligations?
884041377071472642 2017-07-09 13:27:43 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Is Lindsey going to do something about it?
884040906747387904 2017-07-09 13:25:51 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @MeetThePress Just don't get it Lindsey? Is it really that hard to figure out?

884040318273945600 2017-07-09 13:23:31 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @matthewamiller Almost seems like he was in on it.
884040128590696453 2017-07-09 13:22:45 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @MeetThePress Disingenuous nonsense.
884039930858668033 2017-07-09 13:21:58 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @MeetThePress Fuck his presidency. How about our country?
884039300689670145 2017-07-09 13:19:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ @brianstelter This dangerous clown car.
884038449598275584 2017-07-09 13:16:05 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @PreetBharara Outrageous that you were fired, but damn is it fun to hear from you.
884034775148875776 2017-07-09 13:01:29 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What? No pictures of you bending over for Putin?
884034346298093568 2017-07-09 12:59:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MeetThePress @LindseyGrahamSC Talk about our treasonous president or keep quiet.
884031152398491648 2017-07-09 12:47:05 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @RepAdamSchiff Adam this is your background. Is this treason?
884030402230407169 2017-07-09 12:44:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Let the finger pointing begin.
884030290355773440 2017-07-09 12:43:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your stupidity is beyond scary.
884029995856912384 2017-07-09 12:42:30 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio @DMRDynamics Rubio has random spasms of decency. Probably won't mean a thing.
883899819458256896 2017-07-08 04:05:13 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @politico Why? Because President Bend Over surrendered to Russia?
883830274005630977 2017-07-08 23:28:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean What a weirdo.
883830099040251904 2017-07-08 23:28:11 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Glad I was seated while reading. Stunning possibility.

883829557995982849 2017-07-08 23:26:02 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @davidaxelrod Brilliant alibi. This will stop Mueller dead in his tracks.
883829390647451648 2017-07-08 23:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich You're hilarious. Especially now that you're out of power.
883788131564216321 2017-07-08 20:41:25 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @HeerJeet No kidding. And he appears adept at feeding himself.

883781023531753473 2017-07-08 20:13:10 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Horrible.
883775602876141568 2017-07-08 19:51:38 UTC <gaughran444> @Russian_Starr There would have been burning crosses on the White House lawn if Michelle had done that. And she would have done it well.
883775225720131584 2017-07-08 19:50:08 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @Kasparov63 It certainly suggests that he's complicit in some way.
883774950871584769 2017-07-08 19:49:02 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner Probably for personal gain and an attempt to avoid criminal liability. Both will ultimately fail.
883763664628707329 2017-07-08 19:04:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Gracefully put. Sounds better than shoe design thief and lip gloss enthusiast.
883763319718457344 2017-07-08 19:02:49 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala President Bend Over. Quisling.
883719317321396224 2017-07-08 16:07:58 UTC <gaughran444> @3L3V3NTH @RonBaalke So needed this! Thank you!
883715529546113025 2017-07-08 15:52:55 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC No basic decency.
883714788378935301 2017-07-08 15:49:58 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @McFaul Probably better to move on with your life. Won't happen.
883714639611211776 2017-07-08 15:49:23 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Sorry but is that necessary? We all know Putin has Trump by the short hairs. Sorry for ghastly image.
883714413190160385 2017-07-08 15:48:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 President Bend Over.
883713087915917312 2017-07-08 15:43:13 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @jeitoapp Stunned to hear this. Okay, well I guess we'll see how it turns out. Good luck and have a nice summer. It always goes so fast.
883712144218497024 2017-07-08 15:39:28 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @jeitoapp No clear as a bell. Don't have a pick for 2020 yet if that's what you're asking. How about you?
883711831323406336 2017-07-08 15:38:13 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Absolutely. Suggests that women are glossy placeholders rather than people of substantive achievement. Insulting.
883710955506589697 2017-07-08 15:34:45 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @jeitoapp The rule of law.
883710047037124609 2017-07-08 15:31:08 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Hopefully will be reduced in 2018 and then overcome in 2020. This is a very bleak moment in our history but not the first.
883709186869166082 2017-07-08 15:27:43 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @JohnFugelsang Yeah, think he did yesterday. For over two hours. He must be tired.
883708768479047681 2017-07-08 15:26:03 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Oh no.
883708558533152768 2017-07-08 15:25:13 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden For the time being, absolutely. Still think we could be restored by a qualified, dignified president. Time will tell.
883707815080185856 2017-07-08 15:22:16 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Probably because not true.
883707345553031171 2017-07-08 15:20:24 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @IngrahamAngle @VP @Hatmanslyvanbea Goodbye troubled soul.
883700169602207744 2017-07-08 14:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn President Bend Over looked very happy.
883698708809961473 2017-07-08 14:46:05 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC I think I was in your class at Brown ('81) and often have similar dreams. Would be fun.
883691178172067841 2017-07-08 14:16:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Anyone who gives a damn about our country should be willing to say this. So no republicans.
883690559755497473 2017-07-08 14:13:42 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule That's it exactly. They have to explain to him what's going on in simple terms and then remind him what happened. I did this for my dad.
883689925681524740 2017-07-08 14:11:11 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ChelsIsRight That's how we got this disastrous presidency.
883687505912115200 2017-07-08 14:01:34 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @SusanBordo The useful fool, our president.
883682124796178434 2017-07-08 13:40:11 UTC <gaughran444> @politico With that and a metro card you can ride the subway.
883650167903223808 2017-07-08 11:33:12 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Strong stomach.
883551850867425282 2017-07-07 05:02:31 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @dustinhines He looks like a psychopath.
883546146546864129 2017-07-07 04:39:51 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @BraddJaffy President Bend Over.
883543268935573505 2017-07-07 04:28:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @CharlesMBlow Of course they are.
883542833365385217 2017-07-07 04:26:41 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Grifter in Chief.
883542634605817857 2017-07-07 04:25:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No question. The political system has ceased to function; law enforcement will restore order and political solutions will reemerge.
883541612256780292 2017-07-07 04:21:50 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahLerner @NYCoach1 Absolutely sadistic. Just when you think nothing can shock you.
883541244890275841 2017-07-07 04:20:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A man of his word. We're good.
883541087087988738 2017-07-07 04:19:45 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc A kind dog is one of life's greatest joys.
883476489861296128 2017-07-07 00:03:04 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Nope. President Bend Over.
883475975119523840 2017-07-07 00:01:01 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @kylegriffin1 Why does he need to be told this? Not glaringly obvious?
883464220687425537 2017-07-07 23:14:18 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Be careful. Crazy bastards.
883462728358273024 2017-07-07 23:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @deg2 Why the hell are men telling women what to wear?
883462287121674240 2017-07-07 23:06:37 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich Reminded me of Neville Chamberlain's speech at 10 Downing Street in 1938.
883444588559704064 2017-07-07 21:56:18 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT Epic accomplishment!
883444163458609153 2017-07-07 21:54:36 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @stuartpstevens Ethically bankrupt and power hungry.
883443277659353088 2017-07-07 21:51:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Absolutely. Like popping a baby in a playpen. You know where it is.
883441247700094976 2017-07-07 21:43:01 UTC <gaughran444> @StillLes4Hill @DavidCornDC This Clapper is a good guy. Straight shooter.
883439364394582017 2017-07-07 21:35:32 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS There are laws against hacking our electoral system. Try enforcing them.
883438991508475904 2017-07-07 21:34:03 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNews Does President Bend Over have a problem with this or does "good chemistry" conquer all?
883437108089827330 2017-07-07 21:26:34 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie All for their proper purpose of course. The Trump/Putin romance is troubling.
883402887723757568 2017-07-07 19:10:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AP Of course. They're in charge.
883401719383695360 2017-07-07 19:05:57 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush Hope Donnie remembered his knee pads.
883400376384225280 2017-07-07 19:00:37 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @deg2 He probably took extra care with his hair and make-up too. Want that good chemistry of course. #Collaborator
883400012792643585 2017-07-07 18:59:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @DavidCornDC Sounds like a dating site review. Disgusting.
883399903749079040 2017-07-07 18:58:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I hope that pooch bites his goddamned head off.
883399622160392195 2017-07-07 18:57:37 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @BBCSteveR That's one way to put it. How about a supine lackey? A passive houseboy? A willing collaborator?
883398212127670273 2017-07-07 18:52:01 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Fucking surreal.
883396304088342533 2017-07-07 18:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Moving on? When 17 US intelligence agencies says we were infiltrated by an enemy state? What was this, a lovers' quarrel?
883394535895650305 2017-07-07 18:37:24 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Remembering 8 years of Republican chanting about Obama's weakness, leading from behind, etc. This dumb orange traitor sold us out.
883394102296838146 2017-07-07 18:35:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan What??
883394003894272004 2017-07-07 18:35:17 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Invertebrate.
883393806430683139 2017-07-07 18:34:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood No. I think it's called bending over.
883393666034814977 2017-07-07 18:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @DanEggenWPost Dark moment.
883393546157408256 2017-07-07 18:33:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood So they both want to sell America down the river?
883393361142349824 2017-07-07 18:32:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Lucian_Kim Well then, that's settled. Super!
883393192976044032 2017-07-07 18:32:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @kylegriffin1 Speed dating.
883373376064061440 2017-07-07 17:13:19 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc See The Beguiled. Especially if you're a Colin Farrell fan.
883319878907830273 2017-07-07 13:40:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber @realDonaldTrump Maybe take notes so you can remember his orders.
883319718483984386 2017-07-07 13:40:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Fired and spoken to by police.
883319564788002817 2017-07-07 13:39:30 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @IngrahamAngle @VP The Trump administration has wholly degraded our country and its place in the world. Will take years to turn this around.
883315223150645248 2017-07-07 13:22:15 UTC <gaughran444> @repjohnlewis You are an American hero. Thank you.
883314740558168064 2017-07-07 13:20:20 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @blakehounshell Unbelievable.
883310721416744961 2017-07-07 13:04:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @DavidCornDC Dishonest, deflecting and senile.
883299825768431616 2017-07-07 12:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The haters? Your lack of dignity (and vocabulary) is grotesque.
883299555365855232 2017-07-07 12:19:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound like a dictator. Americans care very much about a free press. The 1st amendment guarantees it. Have someone read it to you.
883298509436399616 2017-07-07 12:15:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated "Are you going to tell on me?"
883298311557578755 2017-07-07 12:15:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Those talking voices in your head are not real people. Take some meds and get a job with less pressure. #25thAmendment
883297647150477312 2017-07-07 12:12:24 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Such a good point. I think she really pulled her punches and tiptoed around him. She could have taken him apart. Frustrating.
883201841521209344 2017-07-06 05:51:42 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama She was trying not to alienate his petulant followers.
883143380636774401 2017-07-06 01:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @KathyStricker2 @DavidWetherell @AUkeibro I do too. And he's dumb/primitive enough to think it will work.
883143075362734080 2017-07-06 01:58:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 @ALT_uscis Pathetic wretch.
883142575212900352 2017-07-06 01:56:12 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics I think it's called a lie.
883083008101765121 2017-07-06 21:59:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 No - missing caps, exclamation marks and references to blood.
883079702923157504 2017-07-06 21:46:22 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @JesseFFerguson It's called amending comprehensive legislation as problems emerge, aka legislating aka your job.
883078072265834497 2017-07-06 21:39:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Jon4Vermont @oneconnelly1 @MrDane1982 @AUkeibro I'm in.
883077151737696256 2017-07-06 21:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Ouch.
883071297135284224 2017-07-06 21:12:58 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw Hope so. They need help over there.
883071087516561408 2017-07-06 21:12:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson She's not a democrat.
883070923724791809 2017-07-06 21:11:29 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You erode our civilization every time you open your mouth.
883041233081442304 2017-07-06 19:13:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @BraddJaffy Thanks for the scolding but no.
883041000373067777 2017-07-06 19:12:35 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics He looks utterly baffled. An increasingly common expression for him.
883022187824893955 2017-07-06 17:57:49 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom @docrocktex26 @pannlewis44 This guy really likes money. Can we set up a GFM that pays him to stop talking?
883021305976586240 2017-07-06 17:54:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @RepAdamSchiff @hardball @mitchellreports This is news?
883019932061110272 2017-07-06 17:48:52 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Like coal.
883019711872741378 2017-07-06 17:47:59 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Have they got somewhere up there who can step in? Good news!
883019472994529280 2017-07-06 17:47:02 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @crlbe Any day. Absolutely.
883006005755478017 2017-07-06 16:53:31 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Probably the guy with the intact cerebral cortex.
883005228295090177 2017-07-06 16:50:26 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy His primitive use of language is alarming. It's getting worse, right?
883004820365422593 2017-07-06 16:48:49 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady @critic_social Thanks for your understanding!
883001817042485251 2017-07-06 16:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Bernie?
883001625413111808 2017-07-06 16:36:07 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Haha! So true!
883001487500161024 2017-07-06 16:35:34 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He really is catnip for the ladies, isn't he?
883001299461189633 2017-07-06 16:34:49 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Nice attempt at cleaning up his mess.
883000996208816128 2017-07-06 16:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @billmaher @MalcolmNance You must be so hurt. Stay strong.
882985076379852800 2017-07-06 15:30:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady Trump's campaign was the most virulent use of identity politics of any presidential campaign in my lifetime. Except maybe George Wallace.
882950303649234944 2017-07-06 13:12:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnCornyn You are morally bankrupt.
882948346406723584 2017-07-06 13:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Elsewhere, such as the US.
882948141162668033 2017-07-06 13:03:35 UTC <gaughran444> @Morning_Joe The nerve of this lowlife.
882947356936810497 2017-07-06 13:00:28 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 Dear god. So unashamed of his ignorance.
882945506263126016 2017-07-06 12:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Oh ffs. Really?
882945252444823553 2017-07-06 12:52:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NYPDnews This is heartbreaking. So sorry. This brave woman.
882944782724730881 2017-07-06 12:50:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Even in his fog Trump probably remembers that.
882944597198082048 2017-07-06 12:49:30 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 So scary. The danger of the situation contrasted with his simplistic, child-like language. Terrible situation.
882937982948450304 2017-07-06 12:23:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I can't contain my pride.
882804785975635968 2017-07-05 03:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 You're so persistently sane.
882802776677511170 2017-07-05 03:25:58 UTC <gaughran444> @marcmaron Sorry.
882802378583527424 2017-07-05 03:24:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Sounds super inviting but I'll pass.
882797815868649473 2017-07-05 03:06:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood These morally impoverished men.
882797542257381377 2017-07-05 03:05:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood "Anything you can do I can do better, I can do anything better than you."
882778579536314368 2017-07-05 01:49:49 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Another low point.
882777728734441472 2017-07-05 01:46:26 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos @thehill All hail Maxine!
882777562149203968 2017-07-05 01:45:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman Wow. What a slap in the face for Kobach & Trump. Good for Chertoff.
882777273174196224 2017-07-05 01:44:37 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @BandvSusan @AGSchneiderman Go Eric!
882769730561507328 2017-07-05 01:14:39 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias @armandodkos What about women over 40? A lot of us loathe him.
882754427324706816 2017-07-05 00:13:50 UTC <gaughran444> @yashar Best watched with the soundtrack to "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"
882753575423795200 2017-07-05 00:10:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SecretService They even show you where your limo is!
882752975386660865 2017-07-05 00:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This guy is such a fraud.
882731642669944832 2017-07-05 22:43:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson There must be a good joke that combines ancient artifacts with an aversion to birth control. Just can't think of it.
882722678481793024 2017-07-05 22:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @brianefallon This makes me happy. Thank you.
882722234644795394 2017-07-05 22:05:55 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 We live in dark times with some lovely glimmers of light.
882721814937571329 2017-07-05 22:04:15 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel The anti birth control people? What?
882721593889259520 2017-07-05 22:03:22 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And totally harshed her mellow on a holiday weekend.
882718949284204546 2017-07-05 21:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP Any concern about the sanctity of lives that will be wiped out by TrumpCare? Or is it only the in utero life that warrants protection?
882718613530189824 2017-07-05 21:51:32 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP How many abortions has Trump paid for?  Understand his reverence for the sanctity of life is a recent development.
882714178372456448 2017-07-05 21:33:54 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Thank goodness. These poor children.
882713896813031424 2017-07-05 21:32:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @kylegriffin1 Can we nominate her for the next Poet Laureate?
882713224159866880 2017-07-05 21:30:07 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Haha! It's always Obama's fault. Hope Obama doesn't fuck up Trump's meeting with the G-20!
882712898920996864 2017-07-05 21:28:49 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Wow. You have very little regard for the truth don't you? 44 states said no to this ludicrous request and you know it.
882711660774948864 2017-07-05 21:23:54 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Oh goody! Bedtime reading.
882677747520344064 2017-07-05 19:09:09 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @PreetBharara Go Preet.
882677373942079489 2017-07-05 19:07:39 UTC <gaughran444> @essencefest @yashar Love her. Just love her.
882666263289450498 2017-07-05 18:23:30 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Very good point. Dems have to buck up and go public with this. Be insistent. Like Repubs. It's not just politics it's the nation's safety.
882659470756761601 2017-07-05 17:56:31 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Absolutely horrific.
882659379413168129 2017-07-05 17:56:09 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @DMRDynamics Father and son obsess over bullshit. The mark of people who don't have enough to do.
882659139712937984 2017-07-05 17:55:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro See, e.g. Mitch McConnell. "Our goal is to make Obama a one term president."  Didn't work of course but they tried like hell.
882658570239717376 2017-07-05 17:52:56 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro That's the scary totalitarian guy with the dead eyes. Can't wait.
882641848363253760 2017-07-05 16:46:29 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 I swear it's a plot to drive us mad. Fairly effective.
882641328198254592 2017-07-05 16:44:25 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Just remind him about safe sex.  It will be ok.
882641098669252608 2017-07-05 16:43:31 UTC <gaughran444> @Russian_Starr Neither will this white voter. Hell no.
882640976296259585 2017-07-05 16:43:02 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Spoiler. Nader II. Perot without the ears.
882628143336620032 2017-07-05 15:52:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Imbeciles.
882627974004125697 2017-07-05 15:51:22 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Trump's entire campaign was identity politics. The whole goddamned thing.  From overt bigotry to loud unmistakable dog whistles.
882627531320545281 2017-07-05 15:49:36 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Good to hear. And glad you're back.
882627291204943872 2017-07-05 15:48:39 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @liljohnmac77061 Is the misspelling thing a brilliant tactic to annoy the shit out of us?
882622018625183744 2017-07-05 15:27:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The it's not illegal argument will be tough to make when the indictment is released. They spell out that law stuff pretty persuasively.
882621431430991872 2017-07-05 15:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @AdrianCJax Well-traveled path. See, e.g., the American music industry.
882621175058354176 2017-07-05 15:24:21 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc And shouldn't have been so glib - very sorry for your loss.
882620981218553856 2017-07-05 15:23:34 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Good idea. Twitter is a total release valve for me. It's that or a new career as a serial murderer.
882608160187572225 2017-07-05 14:32:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @docrocktex26 @AHamiltonSpirit Dementia. Verbal skills compromised.
882607856444481537 2017-07-05 14:31:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Someone can read his indictment to him before it's filed. Should be compelling.
882606860192419845 2017-07-05 14:27:28 UTC <gaughran444> @politico There is a certain authenticity in florid mental illness.
882606607225499648 2017-07-05 14:26:27 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Planet Bro. Lots of feelings, light on facts.
882574774949617664 2017-07-05 12:19:58 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR @HorsleyScott Dude, the helicopter's on your left.
882570878499917824 2017-07-05 12:04:29 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom Spare us.
882567332127748103 2017-07-05 11:50:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh joy!
882565680763211780 2017-07-05 11:43:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Should help with the collusion case. And the obstruction case for that matter.
882563806777548800 2017-07-05 11:36:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @AP Oh no. Horrible.
882563675269279744 2017-07-05 11:35:52 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @stevenacook @politico His plane found it. Got that right.
882561027241639936 2017-07-05 11:25:20 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh come on. The guy can't find the limousine waiting in front of him. Let's stop pretending.
882429694641135617 2017-07-04 02:43:28 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro @funder @sushispike Totally agree. Those ghastly tweets show how insane he is. Better that people know.
882429278373249025 2017-07-04 02:41:49 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @thehill I trust Mad Magazine more than Trump.
882421601890947072 2017-07-04 02:11:19 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @RogerJStoneJr @DineshDSouza Are you the guy who went to jail? What'd you do?
882420783703838721 2017-07-04 02:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @DonaldJTrumpJr Everything about you is subpar.
882420056675799041 2017-07-04 02:05:10 UTC <gaughran444> @RogerJStoneJr @realDonaldTrump How many fingers? #25thAmendmentNow
882418732215218176 2017-07-04 01:59:54 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes Thanks for working so hard to rescue our country. #Happy4thFBI
882417888564477952 2017-07-04 01:56:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I pray for the day his face appears on a milk carton
882405442164600832 2017-07-04 01:07:06 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Maybe they should put a low jack on him.
882405020943228933 2017-07-04 01:05:25 UTC <gaughran444> @djrothkopf @justinhendrix @dabeard Petraeus also thought whether information was classified was immaterial.
882395998202548224 2017-07-04 00:29:34 UTC <gaughran444> @ColMorrisDavis @ajplus I want him playing golf, jacks, go carts and Twister till he's out of office. Keep him away from the decision making process. #25Amendment
882394636681183232 2017-07-04 00:24:10 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @AdamParkhomenko I'd stick with terrifying.
882384147284733952 2017-07-04 23:42:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TODAYshow Beautiful woman.
882383921119461377 2017-07-04 23:41:35 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @TrueFactsStated Well done Paul!
882383782241808388 2017-07-04 23:41:02 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Yeah. He's wracking up quite a greatest hits tape. #25thAmendmentNow
882383149694693377 2017-07-04 23:38:31 UTC <gaughran444> @MicheleLianna @MyNextLifeDebi Absolutely. Have lived through it in my family. But ffs not meant for the White House.
882378967046647809 2017-07-04 23:21:54 UTC <gaughran444> @CDesign @DMRDynamics Horrible but so funny.
882377966398976001 2017-07-04 23:17:55 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn This is dangerous.
882377720650452993 2017-07-04 23:16:57 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan What better way to celebrate than to push old and disabled people off Medicare?
882377494120235008 2017-07-04 23:16:03 UTC <gaughran444> @DrGMLaTulippe Dementia.

882292588597915648 2017-07-04 17:38:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Delta @WalterReedArmy @ColMorrisDavis Good luck!
882292464694030337 2017-07-04 17:38:10 UTC <gaughran444> @PeteSouza I miss my President.
882292357571502082 2017-07-04 17:37:44 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @BraddJaffy I see this as a good thing. Keep him the hell away from his phone and the White House.
882292169586900993 2017-07-04 17:37:00 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 We will indeed survive this. Together. God bless America.
882291971506790400 2017-07-04 17:36:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No need to prepare them. Just scream "libtards!" and they're good to go.
882279665792040960 2017-07-04 16:47:18 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio @Duramadera Good point. Talk about a tough act to follow.
882275446645194752 2017-07-04 16:30:33 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Love my President. Always will.
882274537018183682 2017-07-04 16:26:56 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @docrocktex26 That's the problem. There's not a real patriot among them.
882239576886128661 2017-07-04 14:08:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's hard to bear.
882239268017647616 2017-07-04 14:06:47 UTC <gaughran444> @_LimoWreck I don't argue with people on twitter so you carry on and have a good 4th
882236922831278080 2017-07-04 13:57:28 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Voter fraud is a non-issue, a pretext for voter suppression.
882236734238601216 2017-07-04 13:56:43 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill @SusaMorgan Can't fool them! Just don't ask them to get off their asses and vote.
882236567380733953 2017-07-04 13:56:03 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro We're like lab mice in a bad experiment waiting for the next shock. I really hate this man.
882236309754048516 2017-07-04 13:55:02 UTC <gaughran444> @pbump With the fucking hat. Still with the hat.
882236115960434690 2017-07-04 13:54:15 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @AUkeibro Oh yes! Bold it is!
882234549723385856 2017-07-04 13:48:02 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt Don't despair. This is a low point - we've had many in our history - and things will get better.
882234044557262848 2017-07-04 13:46:01 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @AUkeibro Thanks for the tip. The higher octane the better.
882233609280729089 2017-07-04 13:44:18 UTC <gaughran444> This is their happy place. White as a sheet.
882232876577595393 2017-07-04 13:41:23 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Choo fucking choo!
882232663536521216 2017-07-04 13:40:32 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio So renounce the Lunatic in Chief. Show some courage and commitment to your country. It will change your trajectory and could help.
882232385055674373 2017-07-04 13:39:26 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @AUkeibro Amen. What kind of coffee are you drinking this morning? I need some.
882232123083689985 2017-07-04 13:38:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro He thinks they're America eagles saluting him.
882231805889454080 2017-07-04 13:37:08 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Preet unplugged is awesome!
882231646442987522 2017-07-04 13:36:30 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Tell it, Keith!
882227834617462784 2017-07-04 13:21:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @h_ferentschik Yes. He is an utter disgrace.
882091388086693888 2017-07-03 04:19:10 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill @paleblueeyes24 His brain is a dial tone intermittently interrupted by loud static.
882091036738301952 2017-07-03 04:17:46 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @MaryMarybrogdon @AynRandPaulRyan Good for him. Gently and optimistically put.

882083574610087936 2017-07-03 03:48:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump As usual you sound menacing and absolutely crazy. Get some meds and a different job. #25thAmendmentNow
882079155407527936 2017-07-03 03:30:33 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen @MassAGO Thank you!

882074865049718785 2017-07-03 03:13:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Yes. This is blocking out the sun.
882074104844734466 2017-07-03 03:10:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @kylegriffin1 How is this not criminal activity?
882014378794635266 2017-07-03 23:13:09 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @JohnJHarwood Until this imbecile runs it into the ground.
882014085981884417 2017-07-03 23:11:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan Except for the part where you're not human. Grandma killer.

881993957202440192 2017-07-03 21:52:00 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn But if he were a mob boss they would have disposed of him bc he talks way too much.
881993483531284480 2017-07-03 21:50:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @armandodkos This will make him psychotic. That is, more so.
881967386202714112 2017-07-03 20:06:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @AttyDeniseBrown Perhaps he feels a little self-conscious in a bathing suit and just needed a little privacy.
881967018102149120 2017-07-03 20:04:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @SophieInCT No kidding. These jackasses have nearly destroyed our country and we have to tenderly analyze them every which way to Sunday? Over it.

881959347009597442 2017-07-03 19:34:28 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Poignant.
881959263354183682 2017-07-03 19:34:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Bet the Pope thinks he sucks too.
881958912068644864 2017-07-03 19:32:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Don't we all have these moments? When the disgust rises up in the back of your throat and you can't bear it any longer? Fucking trump.

881892184169091072 2017-07-03 15:07:36 UTC <gaughran444> @GovChristie Wow. You really have brass ones pal.
881879455282716672 2017-07-03 14:17:01 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @BrownTiti Definitely. And just to be clear I don't think voter fraud exists in the US. Maybe I should rephrase.
881874541110276096 2017-07-03 13:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie They flip out. It's a third rail. But too damn bad.

881872695104868353 2017-07-03 13:50:09 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Voter fraud is a fraud. Pure and simple.

881859437660655617 2017-07-03 12:57:28 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Any clue of the name of the person you'll be speaking with? #25thAmendmentNow
881853906002882560 2017-07-03 12:35:29 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics Disgraceful.
881848778831142914 2017-07-03 12:15:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump At some point you'll be given choice to resign or be indicted. Hopefully soon. #25thAmendmentNow

881846596639621120 2017-07-03 12:06:27 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 No, those still loyal to him probably love this stuff. Imagine who they are to still support him.

881614546192019456 2017-07-02 20:44:22 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He wasn't foolish. He was trying to do the right thing, be president of the whole country. But these racist fucks wouldn't have it.
881605422762930178 2017-07-02 20:08:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @TeaPainUSA I'd take a random 8 year old over him. Most are much better intentioned and stable.

881582941255729152 2017-07-02 18:38:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Or just demonstrating his florid mental illness. Dangerous as hell. #25thAmendmentNow

881528894091911168 2017-07-02 15:04:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Please talk about his obvious craziness and the 25th amendment.
881528335909695489 2017-07-02 15:01:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @tanifitz Thousands of lawyers use this law all the time. A backbone of civil rights to this very day.
881525189472813056 2017-07-02 14:49:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 But don't you think he's out of his very small mind? I think he's fucking crazy and they need to haul him out in a net.
881524659258355712 2017-07-02 14:47:11 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio No dignity, no sanity. Dangerous as hell.
881524515892809731 2017-07-02 14:46:37 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Too busy tweeting crazy shit because he is crazy.
881524100316921856 2017-07-02 14:44:58 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics I find this terrifying. The man is ill and it's dangerous to have him in the White House. Do you agree?
881523701799432192 2017-07-02 14:43:23 UTC <gaughran444> @chucktodd I don't buy the calculated distraction theory for a minute. This man is serious ill and it's a crisis.
881523413411647491 2017-07-02 14:42:14 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @thomaswright08 Thank you. At the moment this is what matters. This is a serous crisis.
881523197857984512 2017-07-02 14:41:22 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC I am too. This is an emergency. What does he have to do for congress to act? There is no bottom here.
881523017217650690 2017-07-02 14:40:39 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Thank you. But the contrasts are also becoming very painful.
881522448604299264 2017-07-02 14:38:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Boring and stupid but also crazy. This is bad news.

881521690269937664 2017-07-02 14:35:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram He is a deranged wingnut. This is dangerous.

881487058883284992 2017-07-02 12:17:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated History will treat him very harshly, as a debased lowpoint, an outgrowth of rage, ignorance and foreign intervention.

881372121859067905 2017-07-01 04:41:03 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Voter fraud is a total fraud.
881371691296882688 2017-07-01 04:39:20 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Someone should ask Lewandowski to name his favorite Hemingway book. Dial tone.

881358470506844169 2017-07-01 03:46:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And they're doing a bang up job. That is one tight ship they're running.
881357885887975424 2017-07-01 03:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Nostalgia is a cozy way to put it.
881357688256569352 2017-07-01 03:43:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Your self-medication is not working. See a doctor.
881357451274178560 2017-07-01 03:42:45 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No it's just debased and pathetic. You're an utter embarrassment.
881294859012894721 2017-07-01 23:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @business @jluisfernandez1 Agree about the communist govt. They're horrible. But the people are innocent and need money/tourism. This hurts them.
881291313022455809 2017-07-01 23:19:57 UTC <gaughran444> @NicolleDWallace @JoyAnnReid @AUkeibro Right? Obliterate the evil black man, keep the healthcare and when The Occupation is over we can change the name back.

881268856559472645 2017-07-01 21:50:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @sahilkapur They're still traumatized that a black guy was president. Can't let it go. Like Agent Orange.

881263698488299520 2017-07-01 21:30:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Shared powers for fed and state govts. But states' rights is code for rampant pre-14th amendment discrimination.
881262956666859520 2017-07-01 21:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @williamcrawley @MaryDram I would think so. They must be teaching their kids to do it or it would have died out already, Right?

881236956889452544 2017-07-01 19:43:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @Forrest4Trees I think we've tried this union thing long enough. It's just not working.
881236175545147392 2017-07-01 19:40:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Delta @ColMorrisDavis This is turning into Odyssey. Terrible.

881234902938775552 2017-07-01 19:35:48 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveRudinABC7 @DumbartonOaks @DCHomos I love Dumbarton Oaks! Hope all is well!
881218124099538944 2017-07-01 18:29:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @washingtonpost Oh ffs.
881216152189501440 2017-07-01 18:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler I love Bette Midler. Patron saint of animals and gardens.
881215796458008576 2017-07-01 18:19:52 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian Glad to hear from my President.
881170105543135232 2017-07-01 15:18:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TerryMcAuliffe @CNNPolitics @Eugene_Scott Meanwhile the people rebuking the states for failing to comply with this ridiculous request will be the "states' rights" advocates.
881160802237108226 2017-07-01 14:41:21 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Imbeciles.
881160671341236224 2017-07-01 14:40:49 UTC <gaughran444> @alfonslopeztena So horrible. These poor people. Donald Trump should have to watch this.
881159627102195716 2017-07-01 14:36:40 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @LaurenWern Fantastic.
881127554677170176 2017-07-01 12:29:14 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @GlennThrush They are amazingly half-assed, which is on balance probably a good thing.
881122642727751680 2017-07-01 12:09:43 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @jk_rowling He doesn't drink. He's really dumb and mentally ill.
880964977284308992 2017-06-30 01:43:12 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Oh please.
880963591633072132 2017-06-30 01:37:42 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Good woman who had been subjected to endless bullshit.
880956539800084481 2017-06-30 01:09:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @maggieNYT @speechboy71 @brianefallon How the hell could anyone find that funny?
880956202779373568 2017-06-30 01:08:20 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT I'm white and I saw nothing funny about trump's candidacy at any point. He announced it by savaging Mexicans. Funny?
880954112677994496 2017-06-30 01:00:02 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Dumb bastard.
880953286911819776 2017-06-30 00:56:45 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @alexburnsNYT @SymoneDSanders He is a virulent racist and he was never funny. And the video of him ridiculing a disabled person was appalling.
880949485307867139 2017-06-30 00:41:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh happy day. Thank god trump is such a hapless imbecile.
880947356363104256 2017-06-30 00:33:11 UTC <gaughran444> @KrisKobach1787 @VP @tripgabriel I think they miscalculated states' willingness to comply with patent nonsense. Very gratifying to see this strength.
880932635324928001 2017-06-30 23:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz Exactly. He is awful.
880900773357420544 2017-06-30 21:28:05 UTC <gaughran444> @jmeacham @BeckyMcClellan @Colodemvoter @NickVFL Ah, he's a different story. Best to you.

880888851446853632 2017-06-30 20:40:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Bros4America @GovernorTomWolf God bless America!
880888489788702720 2017-06-30 20:39:16 UTC <gaughran444> @jmeacham @BeckyMcClellan @Colodemvoter @NickVFL Haha! Thanks! Happy 4th.
880869821293920256 2017-06-30 19:25:05 UTC <gaughran444> @jmeacham @CindyBartholom3 Blue dress etc was bad. There was no Obama corruption whatsoever. But I agree with you on animals. They're the best. Take care.
880868262531268608 2017-06-30 19:18:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Perseverative thought. He can't stop.
880867862235291650 2017-06-30 19:17:18 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @realDonaldTrump So they've knocked you out with an elephant tranquilizer and an aide wrote this. Sleep well.
880864440115240961 2017-06-30 19:03:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @JoyAnnReid There was nothing vulgar about President  Obama. Nothing.
880834767381516293 2017-06-30 17:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Please!! The sooner the better!
880834479975280644 2017-06-30 17:04:39 UTC <gaughran444> @NYGovCuomo Thank you Governor!
880834099585437696 2017-06-30 17:03:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon The nation feels your pain.
880833258505809921 2017-06-30 16:59:48 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @thehill Good! Fight back against the Voter Intimidation Commission!
880823164841988097 2017-06-30 16:19:42 UTC <gaughran444> @morningmika @JoeNBC @tribelaw @DMRDynamics @BeautyBind Don't worry, the FBI makes house calls.
880822921790447617 2017-06-30 16:18:44 UTC <gaughran444> @MattAsherS @JoyAnnReid He is a different species than my sons, who are kind, honest young men.
880821850221289476 2017-06-30 16:14:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @morningmika @tribelaw Nixon was self-destructive but trump makes him look like a piker.
880781324163964932 2017-06-30 13:33:26 UTC <gaughran444> @GeeDee215 Just say no.
880780478038638592 2017-06-30 13:30:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Normsmusic @MaryMarybrogdon @Sunnysgrl62 Yes. This is what it's for.
880778962451955713 2017-06-30 13:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> Miss him so.
880775115486769154 2017-06-30 13:08:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDailyEdge Yes we should. Immediately.
880764555571453952 2017-06-30 12:26:48 UTC <gaughran444> So much concern. So little follow through.
880762837068648448 2017-06-30 12:19:58 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @IrisL49 @StillNeverTrump That's right. This is scary.
880760929197182976 2017-06-30 12:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj That's right. He made clear who he was from day one. Before that it was birtherism and slamming the Central Park 5.
880760539256901632 2017-06-30 12:10:50 UTC <gaughran444> @jmeacham It must be particularly painful for an historian to watch this person. Have we ever had such a debased president?
880760199165988864 2017-06-30 12:09:29 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Um, afraid to ask, but what's he putting in that mouth?
880759919770832896 2017-06-30 12:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Christ I hope so.
880759159100243970 2017-06-30 12:05:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Great thinking! Just knock out people's health insurance and then play it by ear! Did you take your meds today? No bleeding stitches?
880512658524356608 2017-06-29 19:45:51 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Thank you. This is dangerous.
880512406476267520 2017-06-29 19:44:51 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 My step grandfather was born a slave in Georgia. He was 70 when my stepmother was born in NY.
880508463713013760 2017-06-29 19:29:11 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 Voter intimidation. Clear and simple.
880507761624313856 2017-06-29 19:26:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Claude would you let 8 & 10 get on a bus driven by our lunatic in chief? Why aren't people on their feet about his clear mental illness?
880504526456983553 2017-06-29 19:13:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Inability to handle criticism from or blood-thirsty hostility towards?
880503211844653056 2017-06-29 19:08:19 UTC <gaughran444> @_cingraham This is a Voter Intimidation Commission. Repubs have to minimize the non-white vote and they don't care how they do it.
880502838333460481 2017-06-29 19:06:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Not for the republicans. Foaming lunatic in the White House and they won't say boo. Dangerous situation.
880473157282537472 2017-06-29 17:08:53 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Not to mention his patent mental illness. Would you put your child in a school bus driven by him? This is dangerous.
880471745014243329 2017-06-29 17:03:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ It also shows that he is mentally unstable. Would you put your child in a school bus with this man?
880463245668175872 2017-06-29 16:29:30 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Yes because we know how dangerous grandmothers are. Ffs.
880462612122800129 2017-06-29 16:26:59 UTC <gaughran444> @NateSilver538 Before or after his psychotic break?
880462221444349952 2017-06-29 16:25:26 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Trumpcare is hated by the American people, as is your deeply deranged boss.
880461346411732992 2017-06-29 16:21:57 UTC <gaughran444> @mattklewis @JohnJHarwood @TerryMoran Basic mental health counts too. This man is unwell and dangerous in a position of tremendous power.
880461038919053313 2017-06-29 16:20:44 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Repubs are not addressing the issue. It's not about etiquette, it's about basic mental health. This man is unwell and dangerous in this job
880460751038820354 2017-06-29 16:19:35 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha I think the former is serious not as a matter of etiquette but as a symptom of compromised mental health. It's dangerous.
880459598657990656 2017-06-29 16:15:01 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeNBC @morningmika @MSNBC @GloriaBorger @CNNPR Ok but when will we speak about this man's mental illness? Would you like him to drive your children's school bus? Why is he president?
880458782647734273 2017-06-29 16:11:46 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos What does trump have to do for these spineless wretches to acknowledge something's seriously wrong?
880457835624243202 2017-06-29 16:08:00 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @ChrisMurphyCT Well, they're not even discussing his obvious mental illness. But of course they're pressing their brutal legislation.
880457574218424320 2017-06-29 16:06:58 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt There is no acceptable explanation.  This is a breakdown in our system.
880457060000956416 2017-06-29 16:04:55 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump @DMRDynamics If she believed in common decency she wouldn't be so closely allied with him.
880416442583314437 2017-06-29 13:23:31 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos This is a low point and a crisis.
880416286957862912 2017-06-29 13:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro This is dangerous. He's crazy.
880416211733016579 2017-06-29 13:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos If a single republican in office gave a damn about this country they'd be talking about the 25th amendment. This man is not well.
880413326408286209 2017-06-29 13:11:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Okay republicans. Have we hit the limit now? Is there a limit? This man is mentally ill. Any concerns about our country? Even one of you?
880405204985933825 2017-06-29 12:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz FDR was a different species than trump. Concerned about the less fortunate, concerned about people other than himself.
880400460582203392 2017-06-29 12:20:01 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj But have we ever had a pres so obsessed with his predecessor and so determined to wipe out his legacy?
880394697994272768 2017-06-29 11:57:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson At least he takes a nice picture.
880393959348084738 2017-06-29 11:54:11 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It is sad. And she wants to broadcast it.
880389842928099328 2017-06-29 11:37:50 UTC <gaughran444> @marcorubio Cool Marco. Where do you stand on the republican's healthcare bill?
880389657086840832 2017-06-29 11:37:05 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Done.
880245333871267841 2017-06-28 02:03:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Good for a POW camp.
880244243431870465 2017-06-28 01:59:16 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Terribly sorry for this poor woman but she started ranting about "illegals" so turned off. You're a bigot and can't wait till you're gone.
880239604644839424 2017-06-28 01:40:50 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Just say no.
880238049338249220 2017-06-28 01:34:39 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics I screamed at the sun this morning to stay in the sky and it did.  You're welcome.
880237107859656704 2017-06-28 01:30:55 UTC <gaughran444> @WuTangClan @chrislhayes @messagetime Haha. Who's the judge?
880235529085890560 2017-06-28 01:24:38 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @JaneGrader For decades.
880231017830916099 2017-06-28 01:06:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @4everNeverTrump Is there really no first amendment redress for this in the courts? Is anyone trying?
880230436852707328 2017-06-28 01:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Is this the guy who said we should never leave our homes? A real can do kind of fellow.
880227697603092480 2017-06-28 00:53:31 UTC <gaughran444> @hardball @NBCFirstRead It's time for Congress to amend comprehensive legislation - Obamacare - as they always have in the past. That's actually their job.
880226928506142721 2017-06-28 00:50:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TheJusticeDept @senjudiciary @SenFranken @Lily_v_Shtupp Perfect!
880226844854943745 2017-06-28 00:50:08 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 It sounds like working at a badly managed restaurant. Kitchen nightmares.
880226602537320448 2017-06-28 00:49:10 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics @samdman95 Yes a waste of our money. Tax dollars for bigoted bullshit.
880225699646275584 2017-06-28 00:45:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TheJusticeDept @senjudiciary @SenFranken @Lily_v_Shtupp And any woman who tells trump to kiss her ass in Irish is a friend of mine!
880211109470515200 2017-06-28 23:47:36 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath @IrisL49 @Shareblue Yes but his patent insanity and stupidity makes it a bit less chilling. Will come back to bite him.
880207007223099392 2017-06-28 23:31:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TheJusticeDept @senjudiciary @SenFranken @Lily_v_Shtupp Thanks!
880205137628803074 2017-06-28 23:23:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Lily_v_Shtupp I know! And you'd have to thank the good Lord for the blessing of serving him. Looks like you're not quite there!
880204818446508032 2017-06-28 23:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheJusticeDept @senjudiciary @Lily_v_Shtupp @SenFranken As we all should. Al, you are just great.
880203736110465024 2017-06-28 23:18:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Lily_v_Shtupp I don't think you're going to make it into his cabinet.
880199315356102656 2017-06-28 23:00:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 There's one prominently displayed black guy. They all look like hostages. Do they have to all thank Jesus for trump like the cabinet?
880195416968445952 2017-06-28 22:45:15 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @Cubs @realDonaldTrump Finally a team that's white enough to visit you. Don't get used to it.
880192627567726592 2017-06-28 22:34:10 UTC <gaughran444> @OnPirateSat @BlackMosesX @blacqer @BlkWomenStandUp @218Lov @MrDane1982 @AjalaTanya Dear little baby.
880192344242266113 2017-06-28 22:33:02 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @colinjones That should be saved for the trump presidential library. Only that.
880191990524203008 2017-06-28 22:31:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TomPerez @AdrianCJax @Ange_Amene Absolutely. For the moment it is a very negative word for a lot of us.
880191453787545600 2017-06-28 22:29:30 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Which strict constructionist okayed this?
880191143253729280 2017-06-28 22:28:16 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @HuntingOregon Haha! Yes he's using his special telekinetic powers to mess up an otherwise great leader.
880188765842661377 2017-06-28 22:18:49 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Hold on there. The aggression and nastiness is coming from one side. The other side is dignified and quiet.
880188292142047232 2017-06-28 22:16:56 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @justfinethanx Doing what they do best.
880185751761301505 2017-06-28 22:06:50 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @rickhasen Aka Minority Voting Prevention Commission. Only way Repubs can hang on as America gets more brown.
880159840764645378 2017-06-28 20:23:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Racism is rampant in this country. Not a happy fact, just a fact.
880159365810073604 2017-06-28 20:22:00 UTC <gaughran444> @narendramodi @realDonaldTrump Yes missed it. Was too busy looking at all your psycho tweets. Feeling better?

880130827367190535 2017-06-28 18:28:35 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @JesseLehrich Chlamydia is more popular than this plan.
880127554857906176 2017-06-28 18:15:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @mkraju What a maverick.
880116069771489282 2017-06-28 17:29:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @jdrower I think his ambition extends beyond albany he wants to be the guy who brings trump down. Hope he does while we're young enough to enjoy it.
880111422147092480 2017-06-28 17:11:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @SpeakerRyan @Dgmtexas NY is NY because of its immigrants. Italians, Jews, Irish now Africans, Asians, Latin Americans. Anyway, agree to disagree. Take care.
880109605858267136 2017-06-28 17:04:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hope he snags the ties and the man tan.
880092699323445253 2017-06-28 15:57:05 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 I think we can count on them.
880092620202094593 2017-06-28 15:56:46 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon And in so doing makes them look even worse. Clown car.

880091040279138304 2017-06-28 15:50:29 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good good good.
880090926236020738 2017-06-28 15:50:02 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt Ricky Perry looks super smart in those glasses.
880090662946975744 2017-06-28 15:48:59 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh crap. This is going to be super embarrassing.
880066035998760960 2017-06-28 14:11:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @SpeakerRyan @Dgmtexas Ok you & I see things differently. Don't knock New York. We are all immigrants. Good luck.
880052744471564288 2017-06-28 13:18:19 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @SpeakerRyan @Dgmtexas Don't look at me Texas. My family is nypd and I of course support them. They keep NYC safe.

880027950971842560 2017-06-28 11:39:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Sounds like trump.
880027865571622912 2017-06-28 11:39:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram But he knows all the Irish people in America. You have to give him that.

879881077929717760 2017-06-27 01:56:11 UTC <gaughran444> @USDOT @LindseyGrahamSC Where do you stand on the GOP's brutal healthcare bill?
879878167535792128 2017-06-27 01:44:37 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I may need an umbrella drink for that one.
879876575407349761 2017-06-27 01:38:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Disturbing picture.
879876221156433921 2017-06-27 01:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Are we sure trump thinks?
879874170787688448 2017-06-27 01:28:44 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @JaneGrader @sahluwal Great tactic with a sophisticated gay guy like Varadkar. He was probably looking for a barf bag.

879811456228876289 2017-06-27 21:19:31 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid I just can't.

879763320395501570 2017-06-27 18:08:15 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Thinking about his life-long dream of being a proctologist.

879439856535035904 2017-06-26 20:42:55 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders So try to save Obamacare and stop tooting your own horn.  Just this once.

879410671657594881 2017-06-26 18:46:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 They are. Thugs.
879409685039808512 2017-06-26 18:43:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Beautiful.
879395931992580096 2017-06-26 17:48:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AprilDRyan Can't someone bring a first amendment legal challenge to this?
879378142410022912 2017-06-26 16:37:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @jdice03 And he can't walk that far. Would need a golf cart.
879371941328678912 2017-06-26 16:13:03 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff Don't encourage him. This is about Trump, not Obama.
879371513249619968 2017-06-26 16:11:21 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @jdrower It's probably a job that inflates the ego, but the good of the country has to come first. Really not right.
879371275919077376 2017-06-26 16:10:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Even if John Gotti ordered dozens of hits, is that really a crime?
879370741388627970 2017-06-26 16:08:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I'm too dignified to say anything about trump's mouth. Not a word.
879370525407154176 2017-06-26 16:07:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Like the yucky ending to a bad affair.
879370250172674048 2017-06-26 16:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Kind of like WWII in reverse.
879369875344560129 2017-06-26 16:04:50 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @jdrower I know. She should have retired a long time ago so Obama could have replaced her. Big mistake that the country will pay for.
879342883828113409 2017-06-26 14:17:35 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @jdrower Maybe Supreme Court will help with new case. Or hurt. What a time we live in.
879337846770892802 2017-06-26 13:57:34 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Maybe he read a real newspaper and flipped out.
879337336676417537 2017-06-26 13:55:33 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He's on tear this morning. Making less sense than usual, which is impressive.
879336961303031808 2017-06-26 13:54:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics No he's got that one covered.
879336805023322112 2017-06-26 13:53:26 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter @jdrower I know. But next time the Dems are in power they've got to clean this up.
879336346355208193 2017-06-26 13:51:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Yes they do you hysterical fool.
879336092847177728 2017-06-26 13:50:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid It's also like watching a nervous breakdown.
879335447390031873 2017-06-26 13:48:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That makes sense. Lights off.
879333541376659456 2017-06-26 13:40:28 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Keep talking crazyface. Feels good to hurl the words colluded and obstructed at that uppity black guy, right?

879071170552791040 2017-06-25 20:17:54 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics How helpful.
878957259728064512 2017-06-25 12:45:15 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You can get plantars warts from a locker room floor. Enjoy!
878956292613779457 2017-06-25 12:41:25 UTC <gaughran444> @pbump I like when he exhorts us to enjoy!
878953767735091200 2017-06-25 12:31:23 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Sick of tiptoeing around these bigoted fools as they bring our country to its knees.
878953193790730240 2017-06-25 12:29:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid In that rusty little hamster wheel he calls a brain.
878952163606769664 2017-06-25 12:25:00 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Crazy and dumb as a post.
878951766783610881 2017-06-25 12:23:25 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Good.
878950742631096320 2017-06-25 12:19:21 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Unhinged and deeply stupid. Our fearless leader.
878942231327121408 2017-06-25 11:45:32 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @jdrower My hope is that the threat of indictment will force him to resign. Sayonara.
878829160646537216 2017-06-24 04:16:14 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast I'm so happy I don't have to read this.
878825497014226944 2017-06-24 04:01:40 UTC <gaughran444> @joshgreenman They didn't want to be seen as throwing the election for Hillary. Which would indeed have been the war cry of half the country.
878824923774537728 2017-06-24 03:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @coton_luver @MaryMarybrogdon Same here.
878822703570006016 2017-06-24 03:50:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @coton_luver Will always love him.
878822184558481408 2017-06-24 03:48:31 UTC <gaughran444> @NYDailyNews Damn, seemed like such a promising idea to send this punk into an intractable diplomatic mess.
878821402836709376 2017-06-24 03:45:24 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara More people seem to say indictment is possible but not prosecution.  What do you think?
878820789218365441 2017-06-24 03:42:58 UTC <gaughran444> @BrandyLJensen Couldn't they just go outside and talk to them?
878820449790066688 2017-06-24 03:41:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated My father lived a long time with this stuff. Not fun.
878815920537440256 2017-06-24 03:23:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No they didn't want you ranting about a rigged election.
878813967962865664 2017-06-24 03:15:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @ReneeNTexas It really is.
878813244168835073 2017-06-24 03:12:59 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Why is this little putz representing our country in anything, much less very complicated matters?
878805915935399936 2017-06-24 02:43:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @CamAnalytica @wikileaks @GOP @HillaryClinton @BeverleeHughes3 @SpryGuy @Samizdatz @gormangahst @critic_social Enjoy! Leave the craziness behind!
878748232024805376 2017-06-24 22:54:39 UTC <gaughran444> @lvdjgarcia But don't see Title VII as amendments to constitution getting set aside even by trump appointees.
878748045416034304 2017-06-24 22:53:55 UTC <gaughran444> @lvdjgarcia Good point. And depending what happens to scotus they could well succeed.
878741307098877953 2017-06-24 22:27:08 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha Thank you.
878741138882142208 2017-06-24 22:26:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 @SophieInCT Certainly if a govt entity does it. And even if private should violate Title VII.
878740897814523906 2017-06-24 22:25:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 I don't see how this survives a legal challenge.
878740745615757312 2017-06-24 22:24:54 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw I'd rather dig ditches than represent this guy. Will not shut up.
878726198066642944 2017-06-24 21:27:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDemocrats @CamAnalytica @wikileaks @GOP @HillaryClinton @critic_social @BeverleeHughes3 @gormangahst @SpryGuy @Samizdatz Watch out for bitchy women. We're everywhere.
878710306687655936 2017-06-24 20:23:57 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @HillaryClinton @SpryGuy @BeverleeHughes3 @gormangahst @critic_social Yes, thieves right and left. Just took a 2 hr walk on beautiful day with my dog. Wildflowers, birds, all good. Far from the madding crowd.
878663835057520640 2017-06-24 17:19:17 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @Lili32358043 @NpjamesKathy It's called insurance. Read about it sometime.
878663701217333248 2017-06-24 17:18:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @SherryP1967_5_7 Grotesque.
878663253404135426 2017-06-24 17:16:59 UTC <gaughran444> @BrookingsInst Disaster.
878663136777306113 2017-06-24 17:16:31 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom No it's not.
878662697763708928 2017-06-24 17:14:46 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @SpryGuy @BeverleeHughes3 @gormangahst @critic_social Oh joy! Yes gardening restores the soul, right? Badly needed these days!
878660604604579840 2017-06-24 17:06:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @SherryP1967_5_7 Did he really say that? Poor excuse for a human being.
878660221383708672 2017-06-24 17:04:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ColMorrisDavis Hard to be consistent when you're both senile and a compulsive liar. Challenging.
878659084916056069 2017-06-24 17:00:25 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics I wonder if there's any legal recourse under the 1st amendment.
878658786134810625 2017-06-24 16:59:13 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Yes and there's a lot more to work with with nasty Mitch.
878658481796120576 2017-06-24 16:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro They don't mind blood money. Any currency works for them.
878658071765159941 2017-06-24 16:56:23 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn The truth hurts.
878656981543899138 2017-06-24 16:52:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Hoping the FBI investigation for bank fraud will quiet him down a bit.
878653858200915969 2017-06-24 16:39:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @chrislhayes That is stunning even for these greedy bastards.
878653744367448064 2017-06-24 16:39:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Quiet fool. This is a serious issue.
878652898833555460 2017-06-24 16:35:50 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @SpryGuy @BeverleeHughes3 @gormangahst @critic_social Cannot believe the crap people say. The mind boggles.  I'm a gardener too - plants and flowers so beautiful and quiet! 
878606235167281154 2017-06-24 13:30:24 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Good question. Probably because it's easy and doesn't require careful thought.
878605568692375552 2017-06-24 13:27:45 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Freedom for the very rich to get more tax breaks. Freedom from basic decency.
878605418930610176 2017-06-24 13:27:10 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Personal responsibility? For cancer? ALS? Alzheimer's? Wtf are you talking about?
878599708805136385 2017-06-24 13:04:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate @jdrower Yes the Dems should take a page from the repubs' book, but not sure about this situation.
878595969285316608 2017-06-24 12:49:37 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Certainly with Hillary anticipated by everyone to win. He was trying to avoid delegitimizing her presidency.
878592937617227776 2017-06-24 12:37:34 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT @howiewolf Grossly simplistic.
878589253965553664 2017-06-24 12:22:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @adamcbest Why blame a 400 lb hacker when you can blame the skinny black guy?
878588746853224448 2017-06-24 12:20:55 UTC <gaughran444> @steve_vladeck No he doesn't. Feverish, limited brain.
878458162638147585 2017-06-23 03:42:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SentencingProj @DavidColeACLU @NACDL The "war on drugs" has gone on for decades and has been an unmitigated disaster.
878452975202705408 2017-06-23 03:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @riotwomennn @ColMorrisDavis Your first choice was more elegant.
878452825579302912 2017-06-23 03:20:49 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @JoshSchwerin Pro-life refers to in utero life. Once babies hit the delivery room table, all bets are off.
878451965361041408 2017-06-23 03:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @riotwomennn @ColMorrisDavis Nonsensical horseshit.
878449948181893120 2017-06-23 03:09:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Ugh. On whose behalf? Hopefully not Dems.
878440667638312961 2017-06-23 02:32:30 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Okay then. That's settled.
878429916269871105 2017-06-23 01:49:47 UTC <gaughran444> @SallyQYates Your country thanks you.
878427855482494976 2017-06-23 01:41:35 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yes.
878427787497009153 2017-06-23 01:41:19 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Because you were yammering about a rigged elections would have been screaming fraud if Hillary won, as everyone expected.
878427378401370112 2017-06-23 01:39:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @kylegriffin1 At least not on indictment. The threat of which could force resignation. See, Nixon.
878427148113018880 2017-06-23 01:38:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Everyone - everyone - thought Hillary was going to win. Trump was yammering about a rigged election. Didn't want to delegitimize her win.
878424703215558657 2017-06-23 01:29:04 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix This is moronic.
878418802450587648 2017-06-23 01:05:37 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @SpryGuy @BeverleeHughes3 @critic_social Enjoy the blissful peace!
878418647303282688 2017-06-23 01:05:00 UTC <gaughran444> @NRA @JoyAnnReid I have black police officers in my family. It can be dangerous.
878418261355921410 2017-06-23 01:03:28 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Anything to blame Obama.
878416320089526272 2017-06-23 00:55:45 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump But I thought it was fake news. Now it's real?
878408141859422215 2017-06-23 00:23:15 UTC <gaughran444> @Mikel_Jollett @Meadhbh254 Yes.
878406347057975300 2017-06-23 00:16:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Fuck this guy.
878399326791380992 2017-06-23 23:48:14 UTC <gaughran444> @hughhewitt @MSNBC Why on earth would we watch this guy?
878394725400805376 2017-06-23 23:29:56 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Count me in. I'll start taking more fish oil to make sure I make it.
878393273894797318 2017-06-23 23:24:10 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro We just have to survive this motherfucker. Outlive his presidency.
878352074517266432 2017-06-23 20:40:28 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Mueller and Schneiderman - heat seeking missiles. Fully confident here. And they're as least as motivated as we are.
878351736037146624 2017-06-23 20:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha Oh no.
878345186929250304 2017-06-23 20:13:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Bada-bing!
878345070923005952 2017-06-23 20:12:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Bravo Bone Spur Boy!
878324120223571968 2017-06-23 18:49:23 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes. Maybe it was his ability to morph from liberal to good ol' boy as necessary.
878323243454570497 2017-06-23 18:45:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Good! And it's also wrong, like much of what comes out of the clown car parked at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
878319430823886849 2017-06-23 18:30:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think Mueller can only be fired by asst AG for cause. Trump could trample over the regs/law to do it, but might bolster obstruction case.
878316538234679296 2017-06-23 18:19:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I was just about to have lunch. May pass now.
878316037325807625 2017-06-23 18:17:16 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @tomwatson No trust from this Dem.
878265279108849666 2017-06-23 14:55:34 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Pathetic liar.
878265065182564352 2017-06-23 14:54:43 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes. But doesn't it seem like Bernie is hellbent on disrupting unity?
878261790655696896 2017-06-23 14:41:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @peterdaou Economic anxiety.
878261359229587457 2017-06-23 14:40:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thugs.
878261186680291328 2017-06-23 14:39:18 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos So what to do?
878238828057608193 2017-06-23 13:10:28 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He does of course but comes off as crazy. Esp in debate.
878237725383680000 2017-06-23 13:06:05 UTC <gaughran444> @RVAwonk Yes, they're all about the fetus. Once it's out, what ev.
878237122091667458 2017-06-23 13:03:41 UTC <gaughran444> @climateprogress @SusaMorgan I can't.
878236439833530369 2017-06-23 13:00:58 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This fucking guy.
878235396680929280 2017-06-23 12:56:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated We may feel like ships cast adrift, but Mueller & Co are a US Navy destroyer. Trump is booze cruise lost at sea.
878231704690937856 2017-06-23 12:42:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And firing Mueller can add to the obstruction charges.
878092333211820032 2017-06-22 03:28:21 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @jdawsey1 Where do they think we are? Russia?
878091482531549184 2017-06-22 03:24:58 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @naretevduorp @MDivewench Definitely. What did they miss?
878091060202754048 2017-06-22 03:23:17 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @hawley_lisa Fair enough.
878089647200641024 2017-06-22 03:17:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeConason Gross.
878088442931847168 2017-06-22 03:12:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @hawley_lisa My dog is way nicer and cuter than him. Also calmer and more mature.
878086946450423808 2017-06-22 03:06:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Tough call. He's yet to have a crisis that was not of his own making.
878084937802448896 2017-06-22 02:58:57 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @naretevduorp Good! Now everybody stop pouting about Tuesday and buck up. Stop whining, start winning.
878058968903368706 2017-06-22 01:15:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Sickening.
878058953866969089 2017-06-22 01:15:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MeetThePress @JaneGrader @BraddJaffy Hang tough senator! Do the right thing!
878045362417582082 2017-06-22 00:21:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @TrueFactsStated @UntilZeroDawn @EpiphnySyndct I'm with you. No evidence that so-called progressives will help in any election.
878008237743910913 2017-06-22 21:54:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Oh god.
878006258216906752 2017-06-22 21:46:19 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow If any women attend, bring your own water.
878006065186701312 2017-06-22 21:45:33 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @cmclymer Yes. Because only white people work hard. Nvm the POC.
878005783878803457 2017-06-22 21:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Super way to meet women.
878005412079054848 2017-06-22 21:42:57 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Even if Comey didn't pause for a moment and hoped there were tapes? Just the attempt gets him? Hope so.
878002607226322948 2017-06-22 21:31:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @TomPerez American heroes. How about when the next confederate statue comes down one goes up for these brave souls?
878002226408562688 2017-06-22 21:30:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics So subpoena them, no?
878000446303944705 2017-06-22 21:23:13 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @SenGillibrand I love her even when she doesn't say fuck.

877985499767549953 2017-06-22 20:23:49 UTC <gaughran444> @esquire @MattMurph24 @JamilSmith Horrifying. Couldn't pull off an Easter egg roll.
877985287686811654 2017-06-22 20:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @Kat4Obama Yeah. This guy.
877985051706871808 2017-06-22 20:22:03 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Good one!!
877984467863969792 2017-06-22 20:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump There has never been a POTUS less dignified or qualified than you.
877984294941081601 2017-06-22 20:19:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Darwin strikes again.
877984086383411200 2017-06-22 20:18:13 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Do you have a day job?
877983936978325506 2017-06-22 20:17:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Are your lawyers advising you to release this dribble? If so, can them.
877967167597277185 2017-06-22 19:10:59 UTC <gaughran444> @KatrinaNation @chrislhayes Because we need some bad news for a change.
877966733516038144 2017-06-22 19:09:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Like any disease he claims a lot of victims.
877964062780518400 2017-06-22 18:58:39 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian @newolder Sure hope so.
877961742948732928 2017-06-22 18:49:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Some democrats. The kind who are comfortable hammering women for all the world's woes.
877961301707952128 2017-06-22 18:47:40 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos But states' rights!!
877956152419639301 2017-06-22 18:27:13 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @AshleyJAE_ Girls, pass on the drinks at these things.
877951626593443840 2017-06-22 18:09:13 UTC <gaughran444> @VP We are a laughing stock.
877951533031096320 2017-06-22 18:08:51 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Is this part of a stand-up routine?
877951445701709825 2017-06-22 18:08:30 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Partners???
877951310296907781 2017-06-22 18:07:58 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP More bullshit.
877951092931387392 2017-06-22 18:07:06 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Yeah the wall is a good start. Fools.
877945590725963776 2017-06-22 17:45:14 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Exactly right.
877945053489938432 2017-06-22 17:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 They're not given a choice.
877927623313240064 2017-06-22 16:33:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MeghanMcCain Fair enough.
877927159733510144 2017-06-22 16:32:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Robert Mueller and his staff are not a hoax. As you will soon find out.
877926953810087939 2017-06-22 16:31:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Omg. You lying SOS. He said no such thing.
877926795491672064 2017-06-22 16:30:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yeah. Wtf happened to him?
877925612526211072 2017-06-22 16:25:51 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson Oh yes. I'm white and I would definitely read it.
877925298271993857 2017-06-22 16:24:36 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @yashar Looks like a darling boy.
877924719118491653 2017-06-22 16:22:18 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala Who are they? Can they be pressured by their constituents?
877924239407542272 2017-06-22 16:20:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AAKnopf @PreetBharara Will pre-order as soon as available. Good luck!
877924021991464961 2017-06-22 16:19:32 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean A potentially huge deal.
877923853196021760 2017-06-22 16:18:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean You should be head of the dnc again. We need your energy.
877913274494328833 2017-06-22 15:36:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers It is indeed. I think old white freakout explains 75% of our current political situation. But man is it ugly to live through.
877869783374364672 2017-06-22 12:44:01 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @GloriaBorger This seems like a very big deal.
877864065770573824 2017-06-22 12:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 That can't stand up in court. Ffs.
877863203811852288 2017-06-22 12:17:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Awful.
877778484721983488 2017-06-21 06:41:13 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Oh no. So very sorry.
877704029924610048 2017-06-21 01:45:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Awful. I'm hoping the Dems will hold the floor and public disapproval will grow. Don't you think Repubs will fear next election?
877695045939286017 2017-06-21 01:09:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes they are emboldened. But they don't have a mandate for that terrible law. A confusing, wretched time in history.
877685073654538241 2017-06-21 00:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Sorry. It is truly demoralizing. Our side badly needs some wins for all kinds of reasons.
877653777167155201 2017-06-21 22:25:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Chordate is a great word.
877653514872279041 2017-06-21 22:24:38 UTC <gaughran444> @yashar I saw him say that. Don't get this at all.
877653390095925248 2017-06-21 22:24:08 UTC <gaughran444> @ABCPolitics What??
877653194956042240 2017-06-21 22:23:22 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff I think it's very complicated, not clear how it should have been handled.
877653004551417857 2017-06-21 22:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Not enough sun?
877630308321021952 2017-06-21 20:52:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IrwinJames327 @leftyjennyc If he doesn't perk up, bird rescue people might come to your house and check him out. They're very devoted.
877628151706341376 2017-06-21 20:43:51 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Don't kill the mood, man. This!
877627554416537601 2017-06-21 20:41:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Republicans should ask too but never will.
877627080237871104 2017-06-21 20:39:36 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Come on little guy!!!
877582420765155329 2017-06-21 17:42:08 UTC <gaughran444> @GrahamDavidA @davidfrum No. They get shot in the back while running away.
877515779331289089 2017-06-21 13:17:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Needed a laugh this morning. Thank you.
877515269937274880 2017-06-21 13:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @TrueFactsStated It's more than a strategy, it's a fact. Will become more compelling as heads begin to roll.
877495116302348288 2017-06-21 11:55:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This is a very tough moment. But a lot can happen between now and 11/18.
877494506328920066 2017-06-21 11:52:48 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 It is. Hang in there.
877493665358376960 2017-06-21 11:49:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Obstruction of justice doesn't work either.
877492580312911874 2017-06-21 11:45:08 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum God help us.
877361765696143361 2017-06-20 03:05:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT She's as dignified as her boss.
877361189684215808 2017-06-20 03:03:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @BJHare @GeorgeTakei He prefers to talk. Faux maverick.
877355649583153152 2017-06-20 02:41:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Absolutely. Talk talk talk.
877355274771636224 2017-06-20 02:39:32 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Won't there always be another woman to hate?
877347887889473536 2017-06-20 02:10:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Works for me.
877346608182177792 2017-06-20 02:05:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila Oh ffs. These holy rollers should be nowhere near education policy.
877346022183260160 2017-06-20 02:02:46 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean 95 throughout Ct has sucked for years.
877345620381634560 2017-06-20 02:01:10 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I've disliked this guy for years. Total dick.
877345291120254977 2017-06-20 01:59:52 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNightlyNews @MarySpr05445155 Definitely! My ancestors did that. But no complicated legal process to get through. Anyway, welcome to America. Glad you're here!
877282940354535424 2017-06-20 21:52:06 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @thehill Thugs.
877246907776741376 2017-06-20 19:28:55 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Very sad.
877245817266069505 2017-06-20 19:24:35 UTC <gaughran444> @News12WC No.
877243960598691840 2017-06-20 19:17:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump When was the last time you told the truth? Was it uncomfortable for you?
877243449610731520 2017-06-20 19:15:11 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 Maybe because he's cooperating.
877225869500133377 2017-06-20 18:05:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Will he follow through on anything? Ever?
877225640776400896 2017-06-20 18:04:25 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter @mkraju Excellent. Onward!!
877212263723270144 2017-06-20 17:11:16 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @frankthorp A glimmer of decency.
877212088057384960 2017-06-20 17:10:34 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Turtles are so cute except for this guy.
877211891101302784 2017-06-20 17:09:47 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump It's so scary. All his crises have been of his own making.
877211265814364161 2017-06-20 17:07:18 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Will they have to listen to him speak? Tough guys but that might be more than they can bear.
877210967490392064 2017-06-20 17:06:07 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio @critic_social Haha!
877210655706808320 2017-06-20 17:04:52 UTC <gaughran444> @keithellison Can you share these thoughts with Bernie?
877181456463929344 2017-06-20 15:08:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Fantastic. I miss Buttman.
877181300565782529 2017-06-20 15:08:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @AnthonyMcArthur And greasy for sure.
877181260770291712 2017-06-20 15:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @AnthonyMcArthur Sorry I think he's blindingly stupid. Born on third base and thought he hit a triple.  Also think he has dementia.
877168339734466560 2017-06-20 14:16:43 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes Shake off the paralysis and #HoldTheFloor
877167792507822080 2017-06-20 14:14:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @Here2Resist @bootsiannakfu73 Haha. Remember them.
877141536710037504 2017-06-20 12:30:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I loved the giant cigarette costume!!
877140861901041664 2017-06-20 12:27:32 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias First things first. Thanks Steve!
877139726033178624 2017-06-20 12:23:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @RachelAsher1 Let's do it!
877137576842448900 2017-06-20 12:14:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @chrislhayes Never mind the paralysis. Make noise.
877133805055877121 2017-06-20 11:59:30 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Do it Chuck.
877132578205184002 2017-06-20 11:54:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson They should put a musical mobile over his bed. He can swat at it.
877132239582187520 2017-06-20 11:53:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It's because he's super dumb and they're not good lawyers. Can't keep their stories straight.
877131968093224960 2017-06-20 11:52:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Donald Trump is a hate machine. Spews venom every day. The country will start healing when he's gone, will take years.
877131642636300288 2017-06-20 11:50:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What would you know about hard workers?
877131457512312832 2017-06-20 11:50:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are, as usual, making things up. You are a low point in American history. Go Ossoff!
877017664681644036 2017-06-19 04:18:00 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Delicious irony you puffy hypocrite.
877012989353877505 2017-06-19 03:59:25 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Fantastic.
877012811783839744 2017-06-19 03:58:43 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @Breznican He looks awesome.
877012642120036354 2017-06-19 03:58:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Is there a lab from hell churning these creatures out or what?
877008218324652032 2017-06-19 03:40:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Bc they're lazy bastards who would rather bellow than draft legislation. Bellowing is more fun and easier.
877003758387040258 2017-06-19 03:22:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Uh oh. Next tweet is gonna be a letdown.
877001776603561984 2017-06-19 03:14:52 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Poor little mite.
877000250430558209 2017-06-19 03:08:48 UTC <gaughran444> @IronStache @timjhogan Okay how do we help this guy run against  Paul Ryan? How do we get the country behind him?
876999059063615488 2017-06-19 03:04:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Hideous thought and probably right. Chilling.
876997549214879744 2017-06-19 02:58:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia @Civics4GrownUps The first amendment is the soul of our nation. Love the 14th - brought civil rights to the people. 13th - freedom. 19th - women's votes.
876989744244305920 2017-06-19 02:27:03 UTC <gaughran444> @Lilly67 @TrueFactsStated @Ceefee1724 He's a really bad guy. Just not psychotic.
876982446692159488 2017-06-19 01:58:03 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein Go get 'em Senator! The nation is behind you!
876981010617036801 2017-06-19 01:52:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @AprilDRyan When will the republicans speak up publicly? Ever?
876979970857480192 2017-06-19 01:48:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DrGMLaTulippe He doesn't. You have a soul.
876978734431182848 2017-06-19 01:43:18 UTC <gaughran444> @GeorgeTakei @GregInCT Perfect.
876966741280260096 2017-06-19 00:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Guess your handlers realized your cold, delayed response didn't cut it.
876931681197977600 2017-06-19 22:36:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Lilly67 @TrueFactsStated He's loathsome & will maim the Supreme Court for decades. But probably won't blow up the world which is a step up for us.
876918177648738304 2017-06-19 21:42:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @JenniferJJacobs Is this real? He said that?
876915773339574273 2017-06-19 21:33:07 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast I've heard that too. Guess they watch him pretty carefully.
876913513318551552 2017-06-19 21:24:08 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Where is this little fellow these days? Hope someone is keeping an eye on him.
876912063217532928 2017-06-19 21:18:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @riotwomennn He did! America getting greater by the minute.
876911776914440194 2017-06-19 21:17:14 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNightlyNews @MarySpr05445155 They didn't. There were virtually no legal requirements then. Which is true for most of American history. Sorry to intrude with facts.
876911070195175424 2017-06-19 21:14:26 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump When was the last time you told the truth? How did it feel?
876910903274291200 2017-06-19 21:13:46 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hey! Someone fixed the spelling for you!
876900446903959552 2017-06-19 20:32:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @nbc @TheRickyDavila @critic_social When is her Santa is White special? Do we have to wait till Christmas?
876899571959439360 2017-06-19 20:28:44 UTC <gaughran444> @USNavy @realDonaldTrump Who wrote this for you? You don't have heartfelt thoughts about anyone other than yourself.
876899050553057282 2017-06-19 20:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Amen.
876894588828561408 2017-06-19 20:08:56 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNightlyNews @MarySpr05445155 How exciting for you.
876892614984962048 2017-06-19 20:01:05 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 If this is a public school she might have a good 1st amendment case against them.

876891391917522944 2017-06-19 19:56:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Ever ready with a firm grasp of the obvious.
876889495135817730 2017-06-19 19:48:42 UTC <gaughran444> @GeorgeTakei Is there a word for an exceptionally loud, persistent hypocrite?
876888994235207680 2017-06-19 19:46:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Is this that beautiful Muslim child? Come on.

876887588791099392 2017-06-19 19:41:07 UTC <gaughran444> @DrMocarl @HelenKennedy Exactly. The whole full sentences thing sweeps us off our feet.
876870097608028160 2017-06-19 18:31:37 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Good! Stand up and be heard!
876869333271670784 2017-06-19 18:28:35 UTC <gaughran444> @bessbell Yes. That came to mind.
876865177513316353 2017-06-19 18:12:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @jmsexton_ I like to pick surgeons I see at the grocery store. It always works out great.
876864533503062016 2017-06-19 18:09:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is mean but I find him kind of repulsive. Just him, aside from the criminal conduct and spoiled rich grifter stuff.
876856794815090688 2017-06-19 17:38:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum He's slightly more repulsive when he speaks.
876856309513060354 2017-06-19 17:36:50 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NBCNightlyNews She will stand tall when trump is a distant nightmare. We are all immigrants.
876855877055246336 2017-06-19 17:35:06 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Yes. He's also lovely.
876848859703541760 2017-06-19 17:07:13 UTC <gaughran444> @joncoopertweets Like a dog barking from the back of a departing station wagon.
876841221372731393 2017-06-19 16:36:52 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls Your boss was too busy settling self-invented scores to notice when this happened. Pathetic.
876841021656772609 2017-06-19 16:36:05 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff @ABCPolitics Good luck with that.

876839776598581249 2017-06-19 16:31:08 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Quite an understatement. They're trying to kill Obamacare. No worries about killing people.

876832445504598017 2017-06-19 16:02:00 UTC <gaughran444> @samsteinhp Good. Democrats should raise hell, get loud. Americans don't want trump care. Or trump, for that matter.
876805619797438464 2017-06-19 14:15:24 UTC <gaughran444> @GlennThrush Because he's a bigot.
876803083858317313 2017-06-19 14:05:20 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos You're right. Pure and simple.
876802132611145730 2017-06-19 14:01:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamSchiffCA @KellyannePolls No dishonest one. He said no proof you could take to a jury. Yet.

876625384917413888 2017-06-18 02:19:13 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara Very gently put.

876623081409785857 2017-06-18 02:10:04 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill It's called whistle blowing and patriotism.
876622664605085698 2017-06-18 02:08:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro You'd think electing the orange imbecile would have calmed them down but it hasn't.
876611087772385280 2017-06-18 01:22:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It never fucking stops. They can't bear the thought that one of our nation's best presidents was a black man.
876578035172069380 2017-06-18 23:11:04 UTC <gaughran444> @SpringerKM @leftyjennyc It's hard isn't it?
876507809424306176 2017-06-18 18:32:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Trump is doing his damnedest. Have patience with him.

876434590801461248 2017-06-18 13:41:04 UTC <gaughran444> They should stop weighing and do it.
876415600809136128 2017-06-18 12:25:36 UTC <gaughran444> @biannagolodryga A deeply defective human being.

876403860830662656 2017-06-18 11:38:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid The most pathetic man in the world.
876403560275161089 2017-06-18 11:37:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin And Obama walked into a disaster which he fixed. Trump walked into a solid economy and time of relative peace which he is trashing.
876296549218865152 2017-06-17 04:32:32 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Beyond comprehension. These poor people. How could this happen?
876171622096490497 2017-06-17 20:16:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This may be a darwinian process that has to play out.
876169864246960129 2017-06-17 20:09:08 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax I think the point is that all black people have to fear for their lives.

875890943056109570 2017-06-16 01:40:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump What you did to the people of Cuba today is awful. You'll be indicted soon. Resign.

875756122422075394 2017-06-16 16:45:05 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm Because the republicans only care about power and control, not their country. There is no bottom for them.

875699013693190145 2017-06-16 12:58:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Hard to think about. That poor boy. Those poor parents.
875698004606504960 2017-06-16 12:54:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Yes and indeed you should. We need to hear the truth directly from you! Thank you for your bravery and candor!

875687392056926208 2017-06-16 12:11:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson And he's a very weak man. This is not going to be pretty. He's not exactly the suffer in silence type.

875685743867432960 2017-06-16 12:05:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson So why don't republicans in office denounce them? Where are the patriots?
875685139619221504 2017-06-16 12:03:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hahaha!
875680802163576832 2017-06-16 11:45:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol But why would the acting AG try to soften the blow? He's running part of the Justice dept not doing pr for trump.
875544806310674432 2017-06-15 02:45:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @SusanVermazen I thought she was. Poor Pope.
875535239820460032 2017-06-15 02:07:22 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Disgusting.
875533965599412231 2017-06-15 02:02:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 It's really sick. Massive inferiority complex, which is warranted. But he can't stop.
875533778927714304 2017-06-15 02:01:34 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Why is Newt so omnipresent now? His wife got the Vatican gig. What else does he want?
875533102755479552 2017-06-15 01:58:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Yes, it was the measured, dignified guy who sought unity, not the hair on fire guy screaming about witch hunts.
875532328998768649 2017-06-15 01:55:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Eeww.
875532086228201472 2017-06-15 01:54:50 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Yes.
875531967193853957 2017-06-15 01:54:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Let us pray.
875531586355286018 2017-06-15 01:52:51 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich You don't embarrass easily, do you?
875531343454756865 2017-06-15 01:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @timothycsimons @IngrahamAngle Thought you guys were the law and order party. Guess not.
875529735668981760 2017-06-15 01:45:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @AP What?
875529241982533632 2017-06-15 01:43:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AlanDersh @tribelaw @TrueFactsStated Tribe is the one to follow. Dershowitz is either losing it or is somehow compromised. Talking total shit.
875480066733613062 2017-06-15 22:28:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. Unlike Trump's.
875465768338587650 2017-06-15 21:31:19 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 Yeah this is really creepy.
875465611631095808 2017-06-15 21:30:41 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Right. He's ghastly but not psychotic. Will maim the Supreme Court but not blow up the world. These days good news.
875449760894898176 2017-06-15 20:27:42 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @blakehounshell Is there some factory somewhere cranking out dirtbags?
875449236669779970 2017-06-15 20:25:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA But wait.  What about all those beds to be made and children to be watched?
875448992708136961 2017-06-15 20:24:39 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce He should go to the Cliffs of Moher. Right on the edge.
875447410843103233 2017-06-15 20:18:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A cabal of cowards.
875447303242493955 2017-06-15 20:17:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Don't think pres waives hippaa rights. But how does one make the 25th amendment determination? Don't know.
875446988745166853 2017-06-15 20:16:41 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos More work.
875446898773172224 2017-06-15 20:16:20 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I thought he was supposed to be at work.
875446558019514368 2017-06-15 20:14:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MyNextLifeDebi Yeah that guy was impressive.
875446341928976384 2017-06-15 20:14:07 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander Yeah it's like when you sit next to someone on the subway who is talking loudly to self & you're too scared/embarrassed to move.
875446065092341760 2017-06-15 20:13:01 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes. The jury heard it.
875445964902936577 2017-06-15 20:12:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated When that rock gets picked up it's going to be so so ugly.
875445802847567873 2017-06-15 20:11:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes indeed. I think an elephant tranquilizer is in order but I'm not a physician.
875445621737615360 2017-06-15 20:11:15 UTC <gaughran444> @aussiehowie Trump rolled back Obama's rules denying guns to the mentally ill. But we're not supposed to talk about that.
875445328014712832 2017-06-15 20:10:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I don't think it's controlled by law but isn't pres supposed to get annual exam and doctor lets the country know how he's doing?
875445064557789184 2017-06-15 20:09:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump This doesn't make sense and aren't you supposed to be at work or something?
875444891941253120 2017-06-15 20:08:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are stark raving mad. Make a deal to resign in exchange for no indictment. You'll feel better right away. So will we.
875342314054590468 2017-06-15 13:20:45 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Me too!
875336321484673024 2017-06-15 12:56:56 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw That's for sure.
875335972283703296 2017-06-15 12:55:33 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @JoeNBC @deg2 Can't wait for the pictures of them and the Pope. Side eye.
875335605894479872 2017-06-15 12:54:06 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill Of course.
875333925186535425 2017-06-15 12:47:25 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Very dangerous to whom? Not to America.
875333823843663874 2017-06-15 12:47:01 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Are you unable to understand that all of these issues are related?
875333407122870272 2017-06-15 12:45:21 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Old bitches are the best bitches.
875333241586282496 2017-06-15 12:44:42 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Hahaha!
875332219321057280 2017-06-15 12:40:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @JessicaHuseman Terrible news.
875329990660952065 2017-06-15 12:31:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You could end it all today. Resign.
875201845928611840 2017-06-14 04:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation @traceygaughran Yes like a cornered animal.
875195155455909888 2017-06-14 03:36:00 UTC <gaughran444> @joeltyler_ Good to hear!
875190833510838272 2017-06-14 03:18:49 UTC <gaughran444> @joeltyler_ You're so welcome. A hard loss.
875177993878065152 2017-06-14 02:27:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Alex_Panetta That works too.
875177664478359557 2017-06-14 02:26:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram He sounds unhinged.
875176963295596544 2017-06-14 02:23:42 UTC <gaughran444> @joeltyler_ Yes yes yes. Sorry about your tree.
875169842596392960 2017-06-14 01:55:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Best birthday ever, right?
875149300061401088 2017-06-14 00:33:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics I was busy today. Guess that nonpartisan coming together thing is over?
875148791233613824 2017-06-14 00:31:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated What a roller coaster of a day. Onward! Justice will prevail and the rule of law will be reestablished. #GodBlessAmerica #AndXanax
875147064027598848 2017-06-14 00:24:54 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh He is truly honored.  As am I to get this reply. All the very best to you, brave soul. You will prevail.
875145119267246080 2017-06-14 00:17:10 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc The lift we all needed!
875144430751281153 2017-06-14 00:14:26 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Boo says hi. Hang in there!pic.twitter.com/P15cB7BI19
875143805892272128 2017-06-14 00:11:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Much needed good news!

875001597981597698 2017-06-14 14:46:52 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost He needs to be ignored.
875001267390754816 2017-06-14 14:45:33 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Went to college with her. So excited to see this. Will get the book.
874979001818914816 2017-06-14 13:17:05 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram How awful. Poor child.
874978819559567360 2017-06-14 13:16:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @OversightDems Dems should do the same. Although Kamala Harris would have been led out in handcuffs if she tried.
874968396735143936 2017-06-14 12:34:56 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @KyleCBarry @politico It begins.
874967739860955138 2017-06-14 12:32:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How long till Repubs start demanding her birth certificate?
874966595864580097 2017-06-14 12:27:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Uh oh.
874963669590978560 2017-06-14 12:16:09 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @PaulBegala @sethmoulton Glad he told the truth. How much courage does it take?
874828308764078087 2017-06-13 03:18:16 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Based on made up DOJ rules.
874827962356559872 2017-06-13 03:16:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You won't take me alive coppers!pic.twitter.com/HkjgP7ljmV
874825816496115712 2017-06-13 03:08:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MarkAgee Look like big steak eaters.
874825501076066306 2017-06-13 03:07:07 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris @neeratanden Waiting for them to ask for her birth certificate.
874825170044801026 2017-06-13 03:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Thomas Nast. Dreadful.
874817326427844608 2017-06-13 02:34:38 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @ralphb47 Was thinking exactly the same thing.
874816136407285760 2017-06-13 02:29:54 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Don't wait up for an answer.
874815780558442497 2017-06-13 02:28:30 UTC <gaughran444> @KirstenPowers @NYCoach1 @jbendery Hysteria?? Harris was cool as a cucumber. Sessions flipped out. Come on.
874815186921828352 2017-06-13 02:26:08 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha And yet he never gets embarrassed, never retreats.
874809175846658049 2017-06-13 02:02:15 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Was that just a spontaneous burst of hostage-like, wooden affection?
874808969818247172 2017-06-13 02:01:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce God yes.
874808834484834305 2017-06-13 02:00:53 UTC <gaughran444> @votevets @JoyAnnReid @tedlieu Bone Spur Boy. Profiles in courage.
874804992527433728 2017-06-13 01:45:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog The first Sessions. Was grifting from FBI budget.
874804833634725888 2017-06-13 01:45:00 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @KaivanShroff True. If a woman gave some inchoate bs reason for not testifying the committee would call the police.
874804566319136772 2017-06-13 01:43:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @deg2 Children with bad manners.
874804445326041088 2017-06-13 01:43:27 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He doesn't look that psyched.
874804281899175936 2017-06-13 01:42:48 UTC <gaughran444> @FoxNews @seanhannity @newtgingrich Thanks for heads up! TV off!
874800354965303296 2017-06-13 01:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Sad sequel to "Your Body is a Wonderland."
874799721092706304 2017-06-13 01:24:41 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel He scares the hell out of me.
874799085987012608 2017-06-13 01:22:09 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 They're good at complaining though.
874795181920407553 2017-06-13 01:06:38 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt @JaneGrader We shrinking violets have to stick together!
874795079784910848 2017-06-13 01:06:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @Redistrict He had to?
874787432360759298 2017-06-13 00:35:51 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt The Democratic Party has always been the party of working people. Sanders is full of shit. Destructive, self-appointed messiah.
874786646742454273 2017-06-13 00:32:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile @ACLU But he did. Now what?
874781579398324224 2017-06-13 00:12:35 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @NewYorker No time like the present!
874779516488515585 2017-06-13 00:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Deeply sorry you're president. Will be fixed soon.
874777612681453568 2017-06-13 23:56:50 UTC <gaughran444> @vicenews @sunnysingh_n6 @keegan_hamilton Horrendous.
874776000458108928 2017-06-13 23:50:25 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy Look closely. His cheeks turned bright red, his hands were clenched and his knuckles were white. Or whiter. Dude wasn't happy.
874775512417284097 2017-06-13 23:48:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson A bad omen. Annul that marriage.
874771922600570880 2017-06-13 23:34:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @DavidCornDC Much like his boss. Fancy that.
874771718027476992 2017-06-13 23:33:24 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris Senator Harris we're behind you.

874771252187103232 2017-06-13 23:31:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @TheScotsman Ooooohh!
874767570309599232 2017-06-13 23:16:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Nervous little cracker did not like that woman questioning him. Why? One of life's mysteries.
874767382555832320 2017-06-13 23:16:11 UTC <gaughran444> @NYCoach1 @keithboykin Wait 'till she's president.  At least Obama was a man. This could hurt.
874767019434024960 2017-06-13 23:14:44 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT It will.
874766764013490177 2017-06-13 23:13:43 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Excelllent. This guy did a good job today. Repubs are stonewalling. There's no legit privilege.
874763200235008000 2017-06-13 22:59:33 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Sessions wasn't even invoking atty/client privilege bc he can't. He vaguely referred to mysterious time-honored DOJ "rules," aka bullshit.
874748872794484737 2017-06-13 22:02:37 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell @JoyAnnReid And he never invoked Atty/client privilege which wouldn't cover his testimony. Just some mysterious old DOJ rules that probably don't exist
874748218155958273 2017-06-13 22:00:01 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell He's wrong about every single thing he says. But that doesn't stop him.
874746948691128325 2017-06-13 21:54:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRoot @DabAggin @smileyt22 God bless America. Land of the free & home of the brave.
874745387285979136 2017-06-13 21:48:46 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras Double jeopardy.
874745255949742081 2017-06-13 21:48:15 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras She kicked his dissembling little ass.
874740318754746368 2017-06-13 21:28:38 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio What a relief it was to hear that said clearly.
874733461063557120 2017-06-13 21:01:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound like Crazy Eddie. He would have been a better president.
874677889526099968 2017-06-13 17:20:34 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeKeene Popovich/Kerr 2020.
874668276277751808 2017-06-13 16:42:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Until he trashes it.
874667156130205700 2017-06-13 16:37:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson You're so OCD about this procedural stuff.
874666670819876864 2017-06-13 16:35:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Terribly, terribly sorry that you're the president. This will be repaired soon.
874666062922604544 2017-06-13 16:33:34 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR That's what the federal regs say. Nice to hear he agrees.
874665356400496641 2017-06-13 16:30:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Those pesky federal regulations.
874664967282331648 2017-06-13 16:29:13 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff Robert Mueller.
874661446319255553 2017-06-13 16:15:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson A little rill of integrity.
874660289467305984 2017-06-13 16:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Let's hope he's right.
874651839207276544 2017-06-13 15:37:03 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum They're not feeling the constitution. It's old news.
874651601465729025 2017-06-13 15:36:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @megynkelly Doesn't work. Giving this malevolent freak a platform is a ratings grab.
874650729776021504 2017-06-13 15:32:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @AP What?
874640675035381760 2017-06-13 14:52:41 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Omg! A hint of integrity!
874597121219059712 2017-06-13 11:59:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile @jbendery Where's the evidence that there's an ethical breaking point for any republicans in office? I don't see it. Want to.
874595550733238273 2017-06-13 11:53:23 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix No. He's focused on the enormous problem of voter fraud, aka universal suffrage.
874592195424210945 2017-06-13 11:40:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump It's a terribly dangerous time but you will be removed from office. The rule of law will prevail.
874590691527200768 2017-06-13 11:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sad that you're still president. But the long arm of the law is coming for you. America will prevail.
874478051349889024 2017-06-12 04:06:29 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @BJHare @tedlieu Maybe a fine tuner wood chipper.
874476628843343872 2017-06-12 04:00:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @mattmfm Remember all the bs about how Obama wasn't making an effort to win over congress?
874471999954972673 2017-06-12 03:42:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Come on! Golf first!
874463037465513984 2017-06-12 03:06:49 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Yes! Everybody pick up your phones. Make noise. This is critical.
874462544752234496 2017-06-12 03:04:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @cnnadam @JayKlos Comey's a republican. Yes, the optics. FOX will milk this to death.
874461622365863936 2017-06-12 03:01:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Beautiful. Drums a random choice?
874457625987076097 2017-06-12 02:45:19 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc You just for back from gorgeous trip. Maybe better to stay there in your head. This crap will be here when you're ready.
874457297182961664 2017-06-12 02:44:00 UTC <gaughran444> @Cabinet @realDonaldTrump Is this the meeting where everyone had to kiss your ass? So creepy. As we all know, you're disturbed.
874451835020599296 2017-06-12 02:22:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Ffs. Our country is under assault and we're going back to this bullshit?
874450583150833667 2017-06-12 02:17:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Nonstory of the day. But FOX will love it.
874448092128522241 2017-06-12 02:07:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MyNextLifeDebi @genevieveisgg A ray of hope.
874447082223960064 2017-06-12 02:03:25 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell Dad's right.
874445878794366977 2017-06-12 01:58:38 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @cnnadam Great FOX talking point but really, so what?
874445724989227013 2017-06-12 01:58:01 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @cnnadam So what?
874422917823594497 2017-06-12 00:27:24 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden Yes but the republicans are a priest who will grant absolution.
874421786691219460 2017-06-12 00:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @jonkarl Can't see whole thing. Any basis required for firing?
874415830423023616 2017-06-12 23:59:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson This dangerous imbecile.
874414162797047809 2017-06-12 23:52:36 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Should have handed out condoms.
874413472905383938 2017-06-12 23:49:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GilTPolitics @RepAdamSchiff I so hope this is true. Where are the decent republicans? Will they emerge?
874413220081139712 2017-06-12 23:48:52 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @Mikel_Jollett Or she does.
874411883469586432 2017-06-12 23:43:33 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC I'm surprised and horrified. Even for this guy this is shocking.
874411571874865152 2017-06-12 23:42:19 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff I so hope it's true. Are there enough decent people in congress to do this?
874411312884969472 2017-06-12 23:41:17 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt This is frightening. Is there a single decent republican in congress who will oppose this?
874410669034147840 2017-06-12 23:38:43 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara A lot of people care.
874410458404540416 2017-06-12 23:37:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You perverse fool.
874410321125015552 2017-06-12 23:37:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Do you think Rosenstein will fire Mueller? He'd trash his reputation, which was good, forever.
874409010103037953 2017-06-12 23:32:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Crazyparklady1 I know.
874386102911717376 2017-06-12 22:01:06 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Because there's not enough crazy in the world these days.
874384876887212032 2017-06-12 21:56:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @arthur_affect Seriously works for me.
874380410221981697 2017-06-12 21:38:29 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel God he's creepy.
874380045028032513 2017-06-12 21:37:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JJohnsonLaw When this is placed in the Portrait Gallery, it will become a key D.C. destination with large crowds. Someone must share photos with DT.
874377573039570945 2017-06-12 21:27:13 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @OccupyDemocrat1 @riotwomennn Dershowitz is talking a lot of bs these days.
874377478923579393 2017-06-12 21:26:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Losing? Not lost?
874374638918402048 2017-06-12 21:15:33 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @danpfeiffer Can someone FOIL it? This is insane.
874374435624669184 2017-06-12 21:14:45 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @stevebenen Because Obama was much, much better in every way.
874373790431629312 2017-06-12 21:12:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JeffreyToobin Let's hear it for unsmiling lawyers.
874373594738036737 2017-06-12 21:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt @WynneGuglielmo What a sweetheart.
874336647105712130 2017-06-12 18:44:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MeemMeem4 @DavidCornDC @GlazerRandee The ass kissing hall of fame.
874329880699310081 2017-06-12 18:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @j_boyd_ii I need one. Where can we buy copies?
874276266333134848 2017-06-12 14:44:39 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @politico His synapses are firing again.
874275888614998019 2017-06-12 14:43:09 UTC <gaughran444> @isteintraum And in a time of serious crisis in our country it is reckless.
874275601925931008 2017-06-12 14:42:01 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You sound like a fascist and nothing you're saying is true. America has been terribly weakened by this incompetent man.
874253750382325761 2017-06-12 13:15:11 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel I'm really worried about these brave young people. And not a word from our government of course.
874250137043955712 2017-06-12 13:00:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TPM @joshtpm Because he's out of his mind.
874249262510616576 2017-06-12 12:57:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind And what about the kids protesting? What happens to them? We say nothing?
874249055676895232 2017-06-12 12:56:32 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel @shuboogie Yes. This is so worrying.
874237280457764864 2017-06-12 12:09:44 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Translation: here comes the law. How can we stop it?
874202732424548352 2017-06-12 09:52:27 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @CraftySousepaw No.
874102899382652928 2017-06-11 03:15:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Hell yes.
874102510130262016 2017-06-11 03:14:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 I hope you're not suggesting that Santa Claus is not white.
874100999639752705 2017-06-11 03:08:12 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein @Duramadera Would be fun. But don't know if they have any possible criminal jeopardy so don't know if it would happen.  Bad guys.
874099930146721792 2017-06-11 03:03:57 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Where is the local police or federal protection?
874099064832483328 2017-06-11 03:00:31 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Is that "Enjoy!" meant to be funny or sadistic?
874098010191482880 2017-06-11 02:56:20 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein @Duramadera Subpoenaed yes. Dk about compelling testimony. Certainly not over 5th amend objection. If they obfuscate - contempt? Idk. Someone does.
874093729363243008 2017-06-11 02:39:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Priebus or Trump?
874093106932719616 2017-06-11 02:36:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko @SchreckReports Nvm the tweet, how about firing and defaming the guy?
874080472866971648 2017-06-11 01:46:39 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @DmitriMehlhorn @ThisWeekABC Bharara, master of understatement.
874080112773394433 2017-06-11 01:45:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ErinBurnett @CNN @funder Dershowitz has been slinging incoherent bullshit about trump, obstruction of justice, etc. This is one ugly bromance.
874076390286667777 2017-06-11 01:30:25 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast @moorehn Comey v Trump. Who's tougher and stronger? Mmmmm.
874075517691064323 2017-06-11 01:26:57 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Such primitive bullshit.
874073029453787136 2017-06-11 01:17:04 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @Zebop Very good rule.
874072884754427904 2017-06-11 01:16:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 But there seems to be more of him than ever. Why???
874072573147041792 2017-06-11 01:15:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @AdamParkhomenko It's actually heartbreaking.
874072299498065920 2017-06-11 01:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> Clever ruse.
874072154215788544 2017-06-11 01:13:35 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Yes. Critical, terrible difference. Also we had Repubs who put country over party.
874071559694143488 2017-06-11 01:11:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Let me guess you're the chairperson. :)
874071308539219968 2017-06-11 01:10:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT That tweet of his sounded cultish and weird. Or like a bad boyfriend. Creepy.
874070941642444800 2017-06-11 01:08:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel You're proceeding in good faith and she is not.
874070470068506624 2017-06-11 01:06:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson And now that marriage is irretrievably cursed. Thanks big guy.
874064700358750209 2017-06-11 00:43:58 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @EricBoehlert Like an extra cold New Jersey.
874064456011186176 2017-06-11 00:43:00 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Trump has no respect for the law and worked in an industry where he didn't have to. Got tripped up awfully quickly in DC.
874063766194974720 2017-06-11 00:40:15 UTC <gaughran444> @pbump Surprised it wasn't the father.
874061482270617601 2017-06-11 00:31:11 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Ok here we go. Bring on the Republican voter suppression machine.
874060499222245376 2017-06-11 00:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This is insane and a serious conflict of interest.
874060345790345216 2017-06-11 00:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy He's done so much for so many. Should retire.
874060189351260161 2017-06-11 00:26:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics This trump guy is like a fungus.
874059984950218752 2017-06-11 00:25:14 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood And like Comey, Bharara is fair, articulate and pissed off. Clever, Donald.
874059036701974529 2017-06-11 00:21:28 UTC <gaughran444> @juliettekayyem Damn right.
874055570252320768 2017-06-11 00:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 How disgusting.
874006857282723840 2017-06-11 20:54:07 UTC <gaughran444> @wpjenna @markberman @OliverWest100 Was this "advice" dispensed by WH counsel or the hacky guy representing Trump? I thought the latter.
873996852986880000 2017-06-11 20:14:22 UTC <gaughran444> @robdelaney Not if it's still happening on Election Day. Gets the shit elected.
873996492436115457 2017-06-11 20:12:56 UTC <gaughran444> @wpjenna @markberman That is outrageous. Terrible advice and he's got a major conflict there. And they're not his clients. Ethically wrong.
873995691047047168 2017-06-11 20:09:45 UTC <gaughran444> @GabbyGiffords You are an American hero. Thank you so much.
873995319608004608 2017-06-11 20:08:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Don't think so. Think the long arm of the law will wrap itself around his neck wherever he is when the time is right.
873993428593504257 2017-06-11 20:00:46 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Did he? Missed that. My god he is garbage.
873993015743959040 2017-06-11 19:59:07 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @AdrianCJax Like doesn't do it. Love this.
873992831504986113 2017-06-11 19:58:23 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Yeah maybe ashcanning the best and brightest DOJ/FBI people not as good an idea as originally thought.
873988605445910528 2017-06-11 19:41:36 UTC <gaughran444> @dnvolz Good for Leahy. He's got a very good record. And then there's Sessions.
873986970439036930 2017-06-11 19:35:06 UTC <gaughran444> @BenAdamsO_O @nycsouthpaw @TheRickWilson @ericgeller When New York sends its bad, thuggy lawyers who don't have a clue.
873986452765515776 2017-06-11 19:33:02 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @FoxNews If the Stay Puft Man and Satan had a baby.
873985634821693440 2017-06-11 19:29:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Titanic II.
873985242977251328 2017-06-11 19:28:14 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Mofo.
873985128929910784 2017-06-11 19:27:47 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @FoxNews Guidance from the guy who left congress under an ethical cloud. Maybe his proximity to the Vatican has purified him.
873984787152867329 2017-06-11 19:26:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Puh-leeze. Is there ever a point at which country comes first for this guy?
873982084976697344 2017-06-11 19:15:41 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @NormEisen @RVAwonk Not his call.
873977824952152064 2017-06-11 18:58:45 UTC <gaughran444> @PreetBharara @dcpoll Liking this guy more every day.
873976600085356544 2017-06-11 18:53:53 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Not exactly one for all and all for one is he?
873975939130159104 2017-06-11 18:51:16 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @4everNeverTrump Yeah this is really troublesome. Don't know what the rules are but don't want to pay for this garbage.
873902159921807360 2017-06-11 13:58:05 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @chillibeanboy Right. Good point.
873898677428998144 2017-06-11 13:44:15 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Pure comedy. Honorable public servant v draft dodging grifter. Who's the coward?
873898274666819584 2017-06-11 13:42:39 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump I wish he could just be president of West Virginia. Everyone wins.
873897278548914176 2017-06-11 13:38:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Wait till the long arm of the law wraps itself around his neck.
873896973681778688 2017-06-11 13:37:29 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Yes. And he's trying to take away their healthcare. Bone Spur Boy wearing out his welcome.
873896077602295812 2017-06-11 13:33:55 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics But watch the whole thing. She bails on logic, law & decency. Ffs Collins. Stop temporizing for once.
873895333176201216 2017-06-11 13:30:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 What a perfect project as our country is being burnt to the ground by fascists and an enemy state. Could we get back to this another time?
873894584753020929 2017-06-11 13:27:59 UTC <gaughran444> @verrit @SenatorLeahy @peterdaou Love this. Like doesn't capture it.
873894495535992832 2017-06-11 13:27:38 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC He's the only guy in this mess who scares me. Seems so batshit crazy.
873893780570746880 2017-06-11 13:24:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @thehill Pity. Would have so loved to have seen the protest signs in London. They've got a great way with words.
873893534683803650 2017-06-11 13:23:49 UTC <gaughran444> @RogerJStoneJr Good heavens. What to say?
873893248753963008 2017-06-11 13:22:41 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @Kennymack1971 That's it. Our country is on fire and we need all hands on deck. What's with the endless sniping?
873892949733539842 2017-06-11 13:21:30 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Crazy bling.
873892664156073984 2017-06-11 13:20:21 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Thank you Senator Feinstein. Watch her interchange with Comey at hearing. Laid out obstruction of justice very clearly.
873888125201903616 2017-06-11 13:02:19 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorLeahy Go Senator Leahy!
873887991600689152 2017-06-11 13:01:47 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Not a peep.
873886250276704256 2017-06-11 12:54:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Lily_v_Shtupp No doubt.
873885336237203458 2017-06-11 12:51:14 UTC <gaughran444> @changestatusquo That works.
873882375125688321 2017-06-11 12:39:28 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Prevalent? Can someone please translate for this guy? What's he trying to say?
873881791639302145 2017-06-11 12:37:09 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 I wonder what he's trying to say. Who can translate for this lunatic?
873880919823847424 2017-06-11 12:33:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated When we have a legitimate government again, they will do it.
873877923463299074 2017-06-11 12:21:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy Should this case really be argued by the DOJ? Do we really have to spend tax dollars on the specious crap?
873877524815769600 2017-06-11 12:20:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood This little punk. When his father gets hauled off, does he stop talking?
873867626132512768 2017-06-11 11:40:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @adamnagourney He doesn't think. Just reacts in the moment. Like a single cell organism.
873760531898912768 2017-06-10 04:35:19 UTC <gaughran444> @LiberalPhenom They'll never forgive him. We'll never forget him.

873741639113637889 2017-06-10 03:20:14 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Time to cut ties with CNN.

873740027603406848 2017-06-10 03:13:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Never. Could not miss him more. It hurts.

873582053064945664 2017-06-10 16:46:06 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @docrocktex26 So it seems. Not one decent soul? Not one?
873581828887674880 2017-06-10 16:45:13 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @SamuraiKnitter Yes that's the only conclusion one can draw. Horrible.
873573757796966400 2017-06-10 16:13:08 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 But where's the condemnation? We always insist that Muslims condemn terrorism. Why aren't the Repubs standing up for our country?
873572995389952001 2017-06-10 16:10:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No, no. Clearly meant in the kindest way!
873565594502778881 2017-06-10 15:40:42 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost So now we have to dump CNN. And tell them about it.
873565165731688448 2017-06-10 15:39:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So why won't these bastards speak up? We're always urging Muslims to condemn terrorism. Why don't decent Repubs condemn trump?
873559675987513345 2017-06-10 15:17:11 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @mayatcontreras Absolutely. Go Claire!
873559536824659968 2017-06-10 15:16:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You used Chinese steel in your buildings. Can you make a special signal when you're telling the truth?
873556944648273921 2017-06-10 15:06:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Is this serious?
873525640284262400 2017-06-10 13:01:56 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Remind me why you're still talking?
873525441772048385 2017-06-10 13:01:09 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @KellyannePolls If only he weren't a compulsive liar. Democracy is predicated on truth.

873516981303087104 2017-06-10 12:27:32 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Says the man who left congress in an ethics cloud. Comey is clean as a whistle.

873388242627956736 2017-06-09 03:55:58 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @MinerJustMining Except that I never hated James Comey. Have always admired him, never stopped. Sorry.
873385364546781186 2017-06-09 03:44:32 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Can I get in on that bet?

873376180795301888 2017-06-09 03:08:02 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro How is the repression worse? Was just in Havana they're desperately poor and we should not stop tourism. They need money.

873285570004480000 2017-06-09 21:07:59 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost To whom? He looks like a lying sos to most of us.
873285281927049216 2017-06-09 21:06:50 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @CNNPolitics If his lawyer lets him he's engaging in malpractice. A perjury charge in the making.
873285101261639681 2017-06-09 21:06:07 UTC <gaughran444> @GloriaBorger @CNNPolitics I'll believe it when I see it.
873283873374973952 2017-06-09 21:01:14 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Go get 'em Eric!
873246880389529600 2017-06-09 18:34:15 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady Amen.
873246828891975680 2017-06-09 18:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady Haha.
873246764903616512 2017-06-09 18:33:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @MSNBC @TheRickWilson Oh damn! At work!
873246582375948289 2017-06-09 18:33:04 UTC <gaughran444> @GStephanopoulos @ThisWeekABC @PreetBharara Preet is the man.
873246490860421120 2017-06-09 18:32:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He thinks it's expensive wine.
873246427371249665 2017-06-09 18:32:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You can't bullshit the G-men.
873246279110885376 2017-06-09 18:31:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. That will come in handy. Dumb bastard.
873246128392765440 2017-06-09 18:31:15 UTC <gaughran444> @FaithandFreedom @realDonaldTrump And for the old-fashioned among us, we keep them separate. A little thing called the first amendment.
873217419300532224 2017-06-09 16:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw @SophieInCT @TheLastWord Tribe is right.
873217214454878208 2017-06-09 16:36:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @tribelaw Thanks for correcting your friend and colleague. He has gone off the rails.
873214613000773632 2017-06-09 16:26:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Lobonator Don't mind a criminal defense lawyer defending a bad person. That's our system & their job. But Dershowitz is spouting nonsense.
873191998450257920 2017-06-09 14:56:10 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch Dershowitz has gone off the rails. Don't understand his feverish and nonsensical defense of trump. Tribe, Toobin & co are on it.
873172071949402112 2017-06-09 13:36:59 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala He has to live with that.
873171890596188160 2017-06-09 13:36:16 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Not so. Some say it's clear as a bell.

873165699509874689 2017-06-09 13:11:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thank goodness you're back! America was adrift last night without your leadership!
873164938843500544 2017-06-09 13:08:38 UTC <gaughran444> @resnikoff A man of rare courage and principal.
873164789534654467 2017-06-09 13:08:03 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw You were fantastic on O'Donnell last night. Thanks.
873164347131998210 2017-06-09 13:06:17 UTC <gaughran444> @DaviSusan @NPR @UpFirst Of course he will.
873163756532109313 2017-06-09 13:03:56 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Probably. Horse's ass.
873163540689027072 2017-06-09 13:03:05 UTC <gaughran444> @resnikoff So enjoying the sound of hammers hitting nails and happy workers whistling on their way to the job sites.
873154139332767744 2017-06-09 12:25:43 UTC <gaughran444> @facebook @newtgingrich Sneak preview: trump did nothing wrong. Everyone just leave that nice man alone.
873149380030865408 2017-06-09 12:06:49 UTC <gaughran444> @CLewandowski_ @TODAYshow Says the man who hits women.
873008796213366789 2017-06-08 02:48:11 UTC <gaughran444> @BuzzFeedBen @janinegibson Thanks. But I think at the moment we've got the electoral catastrophe market cornered.
873008164987383808 2017-06-08 02:45:40 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Was it the part where he didn't know what he was doing?
873007835558412288 2017-06-08 02:44:22 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey @BraddJaffy Yes little fool. It's all over. Back to grifting as usual.
873004472489959424 2017-06-08 02:31:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Only in utero. Once out, what ev.
872998001723224064 2017-06-08 02:05:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Haha!
872997851781111809 2017-06-08 02:04:42 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Yes it will. There's a lot more coming from Mueller investigation. This just the beginning.
872997437975220224 2017-06-08 02:03:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC He should know.
872996895261675521 2017-06-08 02:00:53 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @latimes And yet through his fog he tried to trash Hillary. Profiles in courage.
872996378896715778 2017-06-08 01:58:50 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath Haha. Remember trump at the sword dance? That was pretty.
872995982874750976 2017-06-08 01:57:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Nice image!!!
872995484054560769 2017-06-08 01:55:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I fedexed him a burner phone. I'm missing the lovable old fool.
872995271625650177 2017-06-08 01:54:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Nixon was a terrible guy but established EPA, opened China, etc. Trump has accomplished nothing and has sold us out to the Russians.
872994442961137664 2017-06-08 01:51:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Haha. I just imagine that creepy Miller guy standing around like a butler while trump bellows and throws things.
872968787385090048 2017-06-08 00:09:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Can you tweet from a burner phone? Maybe he'll smuggle one in.
872944118632206337 2017-06-08 22:31:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Sen_JoeManchin @jaketapper Weak stomach.
872943782160936960 2017-06-08 22:29:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Agree. He need to drop his frenzied defense of trump. Sounds like a fool.

872941659117498368 2017-06-08 22:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Why must they? Unload this corrupt fool. They're allowed to be Americans first, aren't they?

872936012099592192 2017-06-08 21:58:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @sethmoulton But why does only one party care about it? What has happened to the republicans?
872935170193731586 2017-06-08 21:55:37 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Haha!
872933391347396609 2017-06-08 21:48:33 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood In other words: I stand for nothing. Thanks Marco Rubio!
872932979575795712 2017-06-08 21:46:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Oh joy! Nasty little cracker.
872931413770862593 2017-06-08 21:40:41 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris Certainly not in the usual sense of the word.
872931225165582337 2017-06-08 21:39:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Don't make me come down there young man.
872930862890979330 2017-06-08 21:38:30 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Good man.
872930752882774016 2017-06-08 21:38:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Damn! You hit it lucky with the gene pool.
872930407288885248 2017-06-08 21:36:42 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Get the feeling his last word will be "server . . ."
872929118328954880 2017-06-08 21:31:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Not sure but the feeling is mutual.
872928979094786051 2017-06-08 21:31:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So love that place. This is beautiful.
872928638487977984 2017-06-08 21:29:40 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @TheRickWilson Why don't they care about their country? What the hell happened to the republicans?
872928492840734720 2017-06-08 21:29:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Even in the middle of a mini stroke his muscle memory tells him to trash Hillary. Hard-wired.
872928218382311424 2017-06-08 21:28:00 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Critical point. Trump could resign in the face of impending indictment. Let us pray.
872927912462340097 2017-06-08 21:26:47 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell Just a warm glow.
872927456201723906 2017-06-08 21:24:58 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol So say the party of invertebrates.
872926919188250624 2017-06-08 21:22:50 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I knew there was magic in the air. Just didn't know why.
872926807389073409 2017-06-08 21:22:23 UTC <gaughran444> @chucktodd @SopanDeb Is that her big take-away from the hearing?
872926560277463040 2017-06-08 21:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahHuckabee @politico And I can say I'm Queen Elizabeth.
872926164842676224 2017-06-08 21:19:50 UTC <gaughran444> @JoshuaGuess @docrocktex26 @joann_shawn And yet with his dying breath he hammers Hillary.
872925629880127494 2017-06-08 21:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Clearly. There's no bottom to this abyss.
872924145952206852 2017-06-08 21:11:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @hanrahanmj That he is.
872900449048952837 2017-06-08 19:37:39 UTC <gaughran444> @th3j35t3r @DonTMogilevich @accidntlmystic Oh yes. I only mean the elected officials, not private citizens.
872900039496085504 2017-06-08 19:36:01 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @tbmoore Is this serious?
872891031007617024 2017-06-08 19:00:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Ooh. Cracker went old school.
872890824618631168 2017-06-08 18:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson All lawyers know better. He's lying too.
872890591000088579 2017-06-08 18:58:29 UTC <gaughran444> @th3j35t3r If republicans gave a shit about their country this would be over.
872884865141809153 2017-06-08 18:35:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid I think he is a dunce and a venal criminal too. A man of many talents.
872884542444646402 2017-06-08 18:34:26 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @SybilT2 Yeah, touching that he tried to slam Hillary as his synapses short circuited. Muscle memory.
872884132057100288 2017-06-08 18:32:49 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost @nugslilsis I don't know. Think he's Irish Catholic. But definitely a choir boy.
872883824144920577 2017-06-08 18:31:35 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Not unless forced to some day. But there's always the 5th amendment.
872883472888729600 2017-06-08 18:30:11 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox No.
872879092483461125 2017-06-08 18:12:47 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @mkraju Haha! Good luck with that!
872877937934159877 2017-06-08 18:08:12 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter Hahaha!
872874847294115841 2017-06-08 17:55:55 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost What's with the Lordy? Isn't he from NJ? He's kind of sexy until he says that.
872874430824943620 2017-06-08 17:54:16 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost No he said "there was no case there." Anyway, here's my best friend. Let's agree to disagree.pic.twitter.com/vwD0Z0kSW6
872873119660331010 2017-06-08 17:49:03 UTC <gaughran444> @RachelAsher1 @SallyGold Don't tell Jeff Sessions.  Will make him sad.
872872901678157826 2017-06-08 17:48:11 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPost In an inchoate, disturbing fashion. Dark moment.
872872497221423104 2017-06-08 17:46:35 UTC <gaughran444> @fordm Yes that will be insightful.
872871956441333761 2017-06-08 17:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahKnuckey @ColumbiaLaw Who is Comey's good friend at CLS?
872871642413879297 2017-06-08 17:43:11 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill May?
872871309268713474 2017-06-08 17:41:51 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Great moment.
872869987542761473 2017-06-08 17:36:36 UTC <gaughran444> @MeLovesMLE @lauferlaw Yeah why is he so feverishly defending trump? He's making bs arguments and should just stop.
872869202805350401 2017-06-08 17:33:29 UTC <gaughran444> @resnikoff That was a protracted, partisan senior moment. Cognition stalled, reflexes say bash Hillary.
872868604357873664 2017-06-08 17:31:07 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Comey said today there was no case against Clinton. Anyway, totally with you on adopting dogs! The best!
872868197552332800 2017-06-08 17:29:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Even more terrifying: neither do the Republicans.
872867955339649025 2017-06-08 17:28:32 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou I think his lawyers hit him with an elephant tranquilizer.
872867558277476353 2017-06-08 17:26:57 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Oh yes he did. Clear as a bell.
872867265552805890 2017-06-08 17:25:47 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @politico He and McCain doing some world class free association today.
872866821631823872 2017-06-08 17:24:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated James Comey. Master of understatement. And another fucking G.
872861344739078144 2017-06-08 17:02:16 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @TrueFactsStated Spoken like a true patriot. Unfortunately only half of the room agreed with him.
872860588266983426 2017-06-08 16:59:15 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @JoyAnnReid Maybe McCain was some kind of funky performance art.
872860428854054913 2017-06-08 16:58:37 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy And only half the room cares.
872859527250628608 2017-06-08 16:55:02 UTC <gaughran444> @veteran_care Really.
872857730830266368 2017-06-08 16:47:54 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social @TrueFactsStated Chuck Todd is wrong. This was a giant smoking gun. Comey deferred to Mueller bc he's a fact witness who should not conclude legal q's.
872856763342745600 2017-06-08 16:44:03 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow A long, miserable, partisan senior moment.
872856487336583169 2017-06-08 16:42:58 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid No. Fizzle fizzle. Time to hang by the pool.
872856338950475776 2017-06-08 16:42:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila He blew some kind of synaptic fuse. Damn!
872855876163514368 2017-06-08 16:40:32 UTC <gaughran444> @keywest0007 He cashiered his integrity some time ago. Now his synapses are fizzling.
872855671011778560 2017-06-08 16:39:43 UTC <gaughran444> Comey's like wtf with McCain. What happened to this guy?
872854226040483840 2017-06-08 16:33:58 UTC <gaughran444> McCain looking partisan and senile.  Didn't understand that Clinton investigation is done. Thinks Russia investigation is looking at her!
872851156581720065 2017-06-08 16:21:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Abject bullshit. Never mind an enemy state attacking our country. Back to the goddamned emails.
872850824879382528 2017-06-08 16:20:28 UTC <gaughran444> Cornyn trying to make the bullshit Fox News point that Comey should have reported Trump's attempt to obstruct justice. Good luck with that.
872847648352591873 2017-06-08 16:07:50 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Like a gnat buzzing around our heads. Fuck that little fool.
872847420065021953 2017-06-08 16:06:56 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I wish it were true but don't think so. It's heartbreaking. Republicans stood up & did the right thing in Watergate. Not here.
872845567348682753 2017-06-08 15:59:34 UTC <gaughran444> Every time Comey talks about Russia attacking our country I get choked up. Why is this not a unifying issue? What happened to America?
872843539583037440 2017-06-08 15:51:31 UTC <gaughran444> Lankford's a horse's ass. The fact that only the POTUS told Comey to drop Flynn investigation means it wasn't serious? Terrible questioner.
872842996223442944 2017-06-08 15:49:21 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yeah that was bracing.
872840121674018817 2017-06-08 15:37:56 UTC <gaughran444> Blunt v Comey. Puh-leeze.
872838362377461760 2017-06-08 15:30:56 UTC <gaughran444> At this late date hearing Comey say this is not about party, this is about America, brings tears to my eyes.
872837423008559105 2017-06-08 15:27:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Abject bullshit.
872836870664749056 2017-06-08 15:25:01 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Exactly. And Comey spelled out the difference.
872836781326163969 2017-06-08 15:24:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander He's an invertebrate.
872836577113899008 2017-06-08 15:23:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If Dems regain control of congress in 2018 they can and will impeach. Repubs are morally bankrupt and will do fuck all.
872836198259142666 2017-06-08 15:22:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thorazine.
872836116759576578 2017-06-08 15:22:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Bharara is a fucking G.
872835935637037057 2017-06-08 15:21:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated His answers to Feinstein laid out obstruction of justice. Period. The Repubs, Dershowitz, etc will say otherwise but it's clear as day.
872786824481181697 2017-06-08 12:06:09 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix @RepAdamSchiff Critical on obstruction question.
872672739840192514 2017-06-07 04:32:49 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @jacquelineal Yes I was kidding. That's what Jeff Sessions called Hawaii when its fed court ruled against the travel ban.
872672512500518913 2017-06-07 04:31:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon @danjdob @alpinegoodtime Yes I know. Outrageous.
872672295164268546 2017-06-07 04:31:03 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama She got hammered relentlessly, right?
872671151062994945 2017-06-07 04:26:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Couldn't bear to turn on the sound.
872670739580801026 2017-06-07 04:24:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @JoyAnnReid @18major @MrDane1982 @CPinNashville No doubt about it. Want to see more of her.
872669631584112640 2017-06-07 04:20:28 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax @leahmcelrath I was there. Heartbreaking.
872669005944848384 2017-06-07 04:17:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Nate_Cohn @liamstack Unbelievable.
872668838529314816 2017-06-07 04:17:19 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Big whoop. An island somewhere in the Pacific.
872668282553344000 2017-06-07 04:15:06 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama You forgot Valerie Jarrett.
872667550143926272 2017-06-07 04:12:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Because it sets women free.
872664467523481602 2017-06-07 03:59:57 UTC <gaughran444> @Jenn877 @DonnaInformata @ALT_uscis Done.
872663947220013060 2017-06-07 03:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MtnMD Sigh.
872645298883088385 2017-06-07 02:43:46 UTC <gaughran444> @GOPChairwoman @SenFeinstein @DanaBashCNN @KellyannePolls You're not a badass woman. You're just bad.
872645151981744128 2017-06-07 02:43:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @Cjg111958 Um, I actually do know what it is. But thanks.
872642785555484673 2017-06-07 02:33:47 UTC <gaughran444> @antoniafarzan That is grotesque.
872642450875195392 2017-06-07 02:32:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Any NY'er will tell you this is total bullshit.
872641178793119744 2017-06-07 02:27:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yes but it was still beautiful.
872641074048774148 2017-06-07 02:26:59 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid That's super fun. Could it persuade our so-called president to resign?
872640757919879169 2017-06-07 02:25:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Except for that little obstruction of justice part.
872630921031278592 2017-06-07 01:46:38 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Dems have to take back congress and impeach this lawless thug in 2018.
872626543004135424 2017-06-07 01:29:15 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Dershowitz is off and his defense of trump is frantic and simplistic. Don't get him.
872625021377798145 2017-06-07 01:23:12 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @AC360 @TempoGT Okay. Nice to hear from you.
872621937595490306 2017-06-07 01:10:57 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @hisangel333 Lots of luck with that argument.
872621160755810308 2017-06-07 01:07:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Impolitics But he looks like such a nice fellow.
872620653735759872 2017-06-07 01:05:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko @yashar Raccoons terrify me and I don't think they're cute.
872620203544371201 2017-06-07 01:04:03 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Yes.
872612474998198273 2017-06-07 00:33:21 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @AC360 And Dershowitz - who is feverishly defending Trump for reasons that are far from clear - is woefully full of shit. Toobin's right.
872536645060505600 2017-06-07 19:32:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Two bit, low rent thug. A disgrace to the office and the country.
872532141871071232 2017-06-07 19:14:08 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @naivetruth I'm worried about Russians. Anyway good luck and take care.
872510217388535809 2017-06-07 17:47:00 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel But give props to that funky globe moment. Pretty unique.
872508547858407425 2017-06-07 17:40:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SenAngusKing @politico Tell it Angus!
872507640642981889 2017-06-07 17:36:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 I wonder if that will extend to the whole Republican Party. Could spell big problem for GOP.
872506065232986117 2017-06-07 17:30:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Were both humans and non-humans polled?
872455426926940160 2017-06-07 14:09:17 UTC <gaughran444> @BetsyDeVosED @splcenter She's a disgrace.
872454348680433665 2017-06-07 14:05:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @OversightDems Declines? Can he be subpoenaed?
872453813491335168 2017-06-07 14:02:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JenniWrenB @tedlieu Why do they permit this unfortunate fellow to speak? Bad idea.
872452305802711041 2017-06-07 13:56:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT I can't care about this woman. Haven't exactly thrown my back into it but it's just not going to happen.
872451733838024705 2017-06-07 13:54:37 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Yes yes yes. Good man.
872286104954785792 2017-06-06 02:56:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Washing my hair till 2020.
872285490749333504 2017-06-06 02:54:01 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @IamNurseTrish True.
872284391392899072 2017-06-06 02:49:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRealDratch @traceygaughran I'm in.
872267520379695104 2017-06-06 01:42:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Faster Batman, faster!
872267152090439681 2017-06-06 01:41:09 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris @hardball Agree. But neither did Obama or Clinton. Or Carter for that matter.
872266477663117313 2017-06-06 01:38:28 UTC <gaughran444> @FairfieldRTC @CTDems Congrats! Well done!
872265181216337920 2017-06-06 01:33:19 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @brianefallon Toxic Trump.
872263095716126721 2017-06-06 01:25:02 UTC <gaughran444> @YahooNews @MaddowBlog @PreetBharara They're washing their hair. Really.
872261894513577984 2017-06-06 01:20:16 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich @naivetruth Yes my father enlisted & fought in WWII, my grandfather enlisted & fought in WWI. Gingrich stayed home. Different world.
872246430618005505 2017-06-06 00:18:49 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hour after hour after hour. Insult after insult. Idiocy after idiocy. Hard to take.
872240426232803333 2017-06-06 23:54:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Nightmare. Today Qatar, psycho tweets & stealing from children with cancer. Tomorrow? God knows. Make it stop.
872233213111959556 2017-06-06 23:26:17 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich What do you know about courage? Where did you serve? Stop exploiting the memory of these brave boys. They're not props.
872232769925120000 2017-06-06 23:24:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You called that one. Crazy motherfucker, to use a clinical term.
872231225888583680 2017-06-06 23:18:24 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate This is a picture of Mitch McConnell looking optimistic in case you missed it.
872229946684567552 2017-06-06 23:13:19 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Tell me this is not real.
872222743135178752 2017-06-06 22:44:41 UTC <gaughran444> @traceygaughran @kaitlancollins I hope he feeds them questions.  He's an imbecile.
872222019043160065 2017-06-06 22:41:49 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Comey will testify as to facts, not law. Will not draw legal conclusions.  That's okay. It's still very important re obstruction. Hang on.
872219818023411712 2017-06-06 22:33:04 UTC <gaughran444> @JesuitHighPDX @jesuitnews Heartbreaking.
872219342339010562 2017-06-06 22:31:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 Why do you think this is?
872217191193694209 2017-06-06 22:22:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 It's true. And black men aren't. This is pretty interesting.
872216956283355136 2017-06-06 22:21:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Same. Have wheeled through the obscenities and insults. The mind freezes.
872216717166096384 2017-06-06 22:20:45 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP The nightmare ends when you & your boss clear out of D.C.
872205261313687552 2017-06-06 21:35:13 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @POTUS What do you know about courage Bone Spur Boy? Don't exploit these patriots.
872204364286504960 2017-06-06 21:31:39 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Because Comey doesn't give a f.
872204218332925952 2017-06-06 21:31:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @AuthorKimberley Go Claude!
872181098729623553 2017-06-06 19:59:12 UTC <gaughran444> @DocumentHate @MaryDram @AlbertSamaha I practice education & civil rights law. It's rampant.
872179657625526275 2017-06-06 19:53:29 UTC <gaughran444> @politico No so far. They don't even try.
872179540734476288 2017-06-06 19:53:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @JakeSherman @KellyannePolls It's D-Day. Stop talking about bullshit and show some respect.
872176084426649600 2017-06-06 19:39:17 UTC <gaughran444> @EricTrumpFdn @Forbes @DustinGiebel @Fahrenthold Hope Eric Schneiderman is in on this.
872175115676647425 2017-06-06 19:35:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @ericawerner Lindsay Graham is a waste of space.
872174910252224513 2017-06-06 19:34:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Of course. He's reporting facts not making legal conclusions.
872174264270680073 2017-06-06 19:32:03 UTC <gaughran444> @jorgeramosnews @borjaechevarria It's happening all the time.
872172882155196416 2017-06-06 19:26:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Carrasquillo @JohnJHarwood @PhilipRucker Didn't he make the same complaint about Comey? Look out Jared!
872171771801333760 2017-06-06 19:22:09 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump @marcorubio Hahaha!
872159770370768897 2017-06-06 18:34:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @robxlii And really pretty too!
872158458208018434 2017-06-06 18:29:15 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ Silenced? We never stop hearing about their rage. And we're living with its results.
872158221129195521 2017-06-06 18:28:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Who wrote this for you? You've been indulging in hours of crazy bullshit, clearly didn't know what day it is. Bravery is alien to you.
872157121000984577 2017-06-06 18:23:56 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Definitely slow. May be too insane to be political at this point. Feeling more unhinged by the day.
872128756026138625 2017-06-06 16:31:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @davidfrum Wholly defective human being.
872128486827327488 2017-06-06 16:30:09 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm No it hasn't. If any of these people had guns the casualties would have been exponentially increased. How could you miss that?
872124951662407681 2017-06-06 16:16:06 UTC <gaughran444> @politico If Trump resigns does this fool stop talking?
872124674297167872 2017-06-06 16:15:00 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Trump is a world class whiner.
872124199162318848 2017-06-06 16:13:07 UTC <gaughran444> @NYPDnews Thanks for your service!
872123798530797574 2017-06-06 16:11:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson He's the client from hell. Yakking away while stiffing on attorneys' fees. Steer clear.
872122913062866945 2017-06-06 16:08:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Please let this be true. Could shorten the investigation by months if Crazy Face cuts loose on twitter.
872122663849910274 2017-06-06 16:07:00 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Tell us about your brave military service tough guy. On D-Day.
872122453451055104 2017-06-06 16:06:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes.  Maybe they can give a thought to the concept of bravery on D-Day. Honor all those courageous boys by doing the right thing.
872082547232124929 2017-06-06 13:27:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You keep tweeting, you brave and eloquent patriot. As you so brilliantly pointed out, you are our voice!
872081719129780224 2017-06-06 13:24:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I'm embarrassed to say I didn't even think about Kahn's religion/ethnicity till someone mentioned it. But yeah, there it is. What a pig.
872081083420037124 2017-06-06 13:21:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics This guy's face makes me nervous. He doesn't look too sharp.
872079573990727680 2017-06-06 13:15:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Go Matt! Tell it!
872079220041809920 2017-06-06 13:14:23 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc How lovely.
872078731996786688 2017-06-06 13:12:26 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 Punk.
872078086292074497 2017-06-06 13:09:52 UTC <gaughran444> @VP More alarmed by psychotic president. Hearing a lot from you these days. Getting ready for the job?
872077884550250496 2017-06-06 13:09:04 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Will not relent from what, deranged tweeting? He's alienated our allies and hollowed out our government.
872077525127704576 2017-06-06 13:07:39 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP No they don't. Ask the Pope.
872033015102418944 2017-06-06 10:10:47 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras No we're not.
872032862979198976 2017-06-06 10:10:10 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes American Idea: get the f out of the White House and let us have our country back.
871943928358084609 2017-06-05 04:16:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Neubadah I pray for the day when we don't have to look at, talk about or think about this malevolent imbecile any more.
871943273799184384 2017-06-05 04:14:11 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Such bravery.
871943196691005441 2017-06-05 04:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Can take this tweets seriously. But not him.
871939422023020544 2017-06-05 03:58:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @mitchellreports Good.
871939331363135488 2017-06-05 03:58:31 UTC <gaughran444> @NickKristof Actually minimal competence probably would have done the trick.
871938992006189057 2017-06-05 03:57:10 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie That's touching.
871938679618646016 2017-06-05 03:55:55 UTC <gaughran444> @RyanLizza @tribelaw @armandodkos Same here. This guy is out of control. It's not an effort to distract. It's a mind full of sheer chaos.
871933664439001088 2017-06-05 03:36:00 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Do you think the Sp Ct is a legislative body? Or a grocery store? Or a fish tank? What do you know? Anything?
871932891181322240 2017-06-05 03:32:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hope they've still got him right now. Under a bare, dangling light bulb.
871932292498948096 2017-06-05 03:30:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @Brasilmagic Trump's Rorschach responses would send us screaming into the night.
871931777316786177 2017-06-05 03:28:30 UTC <gaughran444> @ICEgov @MaryMarybrogdon @TUSK81 Is there any investigation? Not our DOJ of course.
871926216344961024 2017-06-05 03:06:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveKingIA @KimWeaverIA @AdrianCJax Wonder if she could have gotten government protection. Maybe not these days. Such a shame.
871925775695523845 2017-06-05 03:04:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ClaraJeffery Tough on border collies.
871925417590091776 2017-06-05 03:03:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Eugene_Robinson It's gotten scary. Are there enough adults/patriots in Washington to do something about this?
871924297912209410 2017-06-05 02:58:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @TrueFactsStated Let us pray.
871922035571793920 2017-06-05 02:49:47 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos @jackiebensen Cherry blossoms.
871919351854751744 2017-06-05 02:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated What the hell is this? A legal defense fund?
871915889079312384 2017-06-05 02:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @ABC He seems terrific and I can't believe our disgusting president is attacking him. Beneath contempt.
871915225771110400 2017-06-05 02:22:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @kylegriffin1 @TeeTweetsHere Torture.
871911612172644354 2017-06-05 02:08:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @kylegriffin1 I never watched "The Apprentice." Was it like this? Boring, internecine fighting among repulsive people?
871907418061643776 2017-06-05 01:51:42 UTC <gaughran444> @timothycsimons @drewmckevitt Yes that is unbelievable. How did they justify putting these tributes to oppression up in the first place?
871882302858682369 2017-06-05 00:11:54 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Great. And then there's that dusty orange fungus in the White House.
871811423546073089 2017-06-05 19:30:15 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He's smarter than he looks right?
871810734757482496 2017-06-05 19:27:31 UTC <gaughran444> @VP I have a women-owned small business and I want Obamacare to stay & for TrumpCare & Trump to go away forever. As well as you.
871809008503595010 2017-06-05 19:20:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @aravosis Hadn't thought of that. How truly awful.
871805943071342594 2017-06-05 19:08:28 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @snowcones Evidently not or most of America would be dead. #PresidentCringe
871803231910940672 2017-06-05 18:57:42 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @TrueFactsStated Yes but that hasn't stopped them from pushing their unlawful Muslim ban. Can not wait 'till Thursday.
871799246093246465 2017-06-05 18:41:52 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC We're too enraged/terrified to notice punctuation.
871798587663024129 2017-06-05 18:39:15 UTC <gaughran444> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You are too distracted and lazy to make important appointments.  Make America Functional Again and Resign.
871748107561783296 2017-06-05 15:18:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid He is a uniquely repulsive person. In a class by himself.
871747867165196288 2017-06-05 15:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @rtraister Haha! You were great and so interesting. Keep talking and writing!
871721758319050752 2017-06-05 13:33:57 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP He is a wrecking ball and you are a fraud.
871721193501581312 2017-06-05 13:31:42 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon What a wretch this guy is.
871709164028010497 2017-06-05 12:43:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU Is there a support group for DOJ lawyers working under this guy? There should be.
871708562262822912 2017-06-05 12:41:31 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are one courageous fellow! History will recognize your unique qualities.
871708154366656512 2017-06-05 12:39:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Working for DOJ with you as president = special circle of hell.
871704515929616384 2017-06-05 12:25:26 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram And they want people to think he's sane. Good luck with that.
871697153273589761 2017-06-05 11:56:11 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Disgraceful.
871696604985794560 2017-06-05 11:54:00 UTC <gaughran444> @chucktodd Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!
871696296972890114 2017-06-05 11:52:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TODAYshow @POTUS @KellyannePolls He should apologize and you should go away. Fortunately Brits will ignore you. As will most Americans.
871696062137946112 2017-06-05 11:51:51 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Masochism.
871561820305334272 2017-06-04 02:58:25 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Absolutely. Wish he'd take up bocce. Stay the hell out of the Oval Office.
871558659008073729 2017-06-04 02:45:51 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Really? The jury was out on that one?
871546582067544065 2017-06-04 01:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yeah but they keep hitting.
871535186634264577 2017-06-04 01:12:35 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @Kennymack1971 So Reagan broke their union and now this schmuck wants to privatize. Only men who fly on private planes would do these things.
871533493184069632 2017-06-04 01:05:51 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @RogueSNRadvisor Where the fuck do these two miscreants get off making plans to remove Mayor of London??
871532981063745536 2017-06-04 01:03:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Has anyone explained to him that no birth control = more abortions? Just a thought.
871527814771748864 2017-06-04 00:43:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @Lmao Love that man.
871526172001218561 2017-06-04 00:36:46 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @Karoli Both bi-pedal? Both American?
871525716248145920 2017-06-04 00:34:57 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Lovely and heartbreaking. Been there. Kind thoughts to all involved.
871525269277995009 2017-06-04 00:33:11 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Yeah Trump.
871520378371416065 2017-06-04 00:13:44 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @Dan_Hamell That too.
871518822808813569 2017-06-04 00:07:34 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Like a 2 year old with blocks.
871516353018159104 2017-06-04 23:57:45 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I so hope somebody does.
871371648305430529 2017-06-04 14:22:44 UTC <gaughran444> @brianstelter It's called leadership.
871371376728453120 2017-06-04 14:21:40 UTC <gaughran444> @mkh531 @GeorgeTakei The nerve of him to go after that dignified, competent man.  Let's not think about how trump would behave in a crisis.
871371049341988864 2017-06-04 14:20:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If there were tapes they'd be sampled on dance tracks already. The Fool in Chief can't keep anything quiet.
871337670999461889 2017-06-04 12:07:44 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Trump doesn't think and we all know it.
871337380179050496 2017-06-04 12:06:34 UTC <gaughran444> @jk_rowling We don't. Lack of courage is our current president. God bless London.
871336218319093761 2017-06-04 12:01:57 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ Yes and this was heartbreaking to watch. He is a model of dignity.
871336022516404225 2017-06-04 12:01:11 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian Bet Kahn doesn't give two fucks. Has a real job to do.
871335850797346817 2017-06-04 12:00:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your usual trenchant analysis. Please resign.
871335331123138565 2017-06-04 11:58:26 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum I'd feel better with her at this point.
871334344182427649 2017-06-04 11:54:30 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidColeACLU @normative Court may ask just this question.
871330987665494016 2017-06-04 11:41:10 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Can't bring myself to read a single article about this cipher. Why are we supposed to care?
871330276345094144 2017-06-04 11:38:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Perhaps because she got screwed and the resulting administration is savaging our country? Because democracy was attacked? Big whoop right?
871328800566542337 2017-06-04 11:32:29 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet @ACSpollen I didn't know Maxine played soccer. She's an international menace.
871327948422492162 2017-06-04 11:29:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Dude you're never going to get smart. You very well might be indicted however. Resign.
871326766966747137 2017-06-04 11:24:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Claude really? He had a great rep and appointing Mueller was brilliant, but what was the deal with that memo?
871221122674634752 2017-06-03 04:24:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila @MyNextLifeDebi That would be glorious. But unlike trump he looks highly disciplined. Little monster.
871219768753364992 2017-06-03 04:19:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MyNextLifeDebi Haha! Yes they'd probably all rather be Uber drivers at this point.
871217140669575169 2017-06-03 04:08:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila @MyNextLifeDebi But why is an American station giving this murderous thug a platform?
871210489807876096 2017-06-03 03:42:21 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU @Lily_v_Shtupp @SchadenJake Who are the lucky devils who get to defend this crap on behalf of the govt? Solicitor General's office? So embarrassing!
871209863589789696 2017-06-03 03:39:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila All I can think about when I see her is "Santa Claus is white!" Gold standard?
871202218875260928 2017-06-03 03:09:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith Disgraceful.
871201523006664708 2017-06-03 03:06:43 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @LibertyBelleJ It boggles the mind. Retrograde insanity.
871190639794429952 2017-06-03 02:23:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Was that Joseph Kennedy?
871188057579454469 2017-06-03 02:13:13 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan Yes.
871184097087037441 2017-06-03 01:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan The justice department should look at this but . . .
871183675890823169 2017-06-03 01:55:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @yashar Lovely.
871164300571836417 2017-06-03 00:38:49 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @davidfrum Trump administration. Okay, two words.
871164031821897728 2017-06-03 00:37:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood God bless Article III.
871163949907095552 2017-06-03 00:37:25 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Good. That child's been through enough.
871162212987138048 2017-06-03 00:30:31 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JasonKander Aka "The president is being briefed on developments in London."  God help us.
871161065631088640 2017-06-03 00:25:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Wait till he goes to the Air & Space Museum and gets a load of all that NASA moon landing propaganda.
871148040656228352 2017-06-03 23:34:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Marmel Grotesque.
871147766734520320 2017-06-03 23:33:07 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile @imillhiser A low point.
871147555282923520 2017-06-03 23:32:16 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Guy can tap out a mean amicus brief.
871147430624071681 2017-06-03 23:31:47 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Did you get that from the Drudge Report too? Resign.
871147229758709760 2017-06-03 23:30:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SopanDeb No. This dangerous imbecile is sui generis.
871145708384137216 2017-06-03 23:24:56 UTC <gaughran444> Predictable but utterly disgusting.
871144923910811649 2017-06-03 23:21:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Disgraceful. He has debased our country.
871141797124345856 2017-06-03 23:09:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @SteveKopack This guy is a nadir in America history.
871140772028067843 2017-06-03 23:05:19 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And has asked, what is London?
871138528767488005 2017-06-03 22:56:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @maggieNYT @KellyO Can they draw pictures for him?
871135126067056641 2017-06-03 22:42:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Bros4America Why do they bother?
871134576898445312 2017-06-03 22:40:42 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Says the justice sitting in the stolen seat.
871134363999764480 2017-06-03 22:39:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson He can do better.
871132354521292800 2017-06-03 22:31:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @TeenVogue The world can't wait for this bullshit to play out.
871132021707427841 2017-06-03 22:30:33 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Not to mention she's a tiny little soul. Tough but tiny.
871113782659088385 2017-06-03 21:18:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump 37% approval rating. Obstruction of justice. Russia. Resign.
871090846455746561 2017-06-03 19:46:56 UTC <gaughran444> @ejdickson Props to Judge Judy.
871090437976621058 2017-06-03 19:45:19 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 As are you. By a mile.
871083490607067137 2017-06-03 19:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Absolutely.
871076996687724545 2017-06-03 18:51:54 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Do these people need to be covered?
871076106333454336 2017-06-03 18:48:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro As I expected, a few fat guys smoking. Can they get freedom fries delivered?
871075418169802752 2017-06-03 18:45:38 UTC <gaughran444> @megynkelly @MSNBC Must miss TV.
871054723243282432 2017-06-03 17:23:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber He could always bail on this crooked administration and just tell the truth.
871054364114288640 2017-06-03 17:21:58 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler Oh no. Bette thank you for your incredible support of NYC gardens. You are much loved for this.
871054185386606592 2017-06-03 17:21:15 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum And props to Judge Judy.
871054031329906694 2017-06-03 17:20:39 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Get in there and god bless! Keep kicking ass!
871053839562145792 2017-06-03 17:19:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Why?
871053642601824256 2017-06-03 17:19:06 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Not this liberal. Fuck no. I know a scammer when I see one.
871051838149230592 2017-06-03 17:11:56 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior On what basis can he be defended? That treasonous little cracker has got to go.
871051233775288320 2017-06-03 17:09:32 UTC <gaughran444> @laseptiemewilay @SusaMorgan Yeah he can be very tough. Funny was just thinking about that. We need tough.
871049923525050369 2017-06-03 17:04:19 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @laseptiemewilay Agree. Love Schiff but it's time to get the lead out.
871049526378942464 2017-06-03 17:02:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AugustJPollak But can they sell shoes?
871049237676646407 2017-06-03 17:01:36 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Actually they're urging the Sp Ct to cast aside the constitution and reinstate the ban. Hopefully will be met with the same fate again.
871048839620415489 2017-06-03 17:00:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. He won't make that kind of call now but he'll lay it out for the eager viewing audience. Follow the bouncing orange ball.
871048568592846848 2017-06-03 16:58:56 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Don't worry. I'll periodically remind you that Santa Claus is white.
871048278066028545 2017-06-03 16:57:47 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Haha.
870969652670849024 2017-06-03 11:45:21 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation @riotwomennn Where's a nice cliff when you need one?
870964863660679169 2017-06-03 11:26:19 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Hellish nightmare.
870964057691566080 2017-06-03 11:23:07 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I'm sorry but anyone who thought that is a fool.
870963825486573568 2017-06-03 11:22:12 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Yes, he could always change that tiny, roiling mind.
870856258630373378 2017-06-02 04:14:46 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JoyAnnReid That's right. Neither of which he will ever experience. So he attacks the accomplishments.
870848948851929088 2017-06-02 03:45:43 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom For all of our mutual benefit. One world.
870848046636167168 2017-06-02 03:42:08 UTC <gaughran444> @perlmutations This man is working overtime to protect Trump/Russia. Don't want to hear him called one of the good ones any more.
870841466427518976 2017-06-02 03:15:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Yeah the part about being laughed at was so scary. Crazy, destructive bastard.
870840971419934720 2017-06-02 03:14:01 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro No they were probably totally creeped out. Some really young. So gross.
870839374665134080 2017-06-02 03:07:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It did. Trump in Miss Universe dressing room.
870838420465233920 2017-06-02 03:03:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Kris_Sacrebleu @EdwardOReilly1 @SophieInCT @PlayfulDesign Every American with parents/grandparents who have/had dementia recognizes this stuff. Except our family members were better people.
870837680887787520 2017-06-02 03:00:57 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey Holy cow. That's a big deal.
870835716535853056 2017-06-02 02:53:08 UTC <gaughran444> @AmbassadorRice @donnabrazile @genebsperling Mmmmm. What is it about her . . .?
870835178180149248 2017-06-02 02:51:00 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I've always thought chain gangs were barbaric, but maybe we make an exception just this one time . . .
870832196122275840 2017-06-02 02:39:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Agree. Amateurs v professionals. Boys v men.
870831807750709249 2017-06-02 02:37:36 UTC <gaughran444> @maureendowd @tribelaw @pamica Haha! That too!
870830640563965952 2017-06-02 02:32:58 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate @SophieInCT Don't give a fuck about the rage/anxieties of trump voters. The product of their rage is ravaging our country. Want them drowned out 2018.
870828377594363904 2017-06-02 02:23:59 UTC <gaughran444> @maureendowd @tribelaw An empty, desiccated chamber with a few crude words cycling and recycling through the fetid air.
870827618458849280 2017-06-02 02:20:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MaddowBlog Same people who rant about abortion.
870826857628880896 2017-06-02 02:17:56 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias Haha. After the champagne ice pop maker?
870826274796826624 2017-06-02 02:15:37 UTC <gaughran444> @DabAggin @ninaturner This is an emergency.
870823493033762817 2017-06-02 02:04:34 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Sorry but this will be a few fat guys smoking cigarettes. Maybe they can get freedom fries delivered.

870819280673275904 2017-06-02 01:47:50 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood He is a world class liar. Just a little smoother than his boss, but another lying SOS.
870818083195293696 2017-06-02 01:43:04 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @SimonWDC Why would they stop lying about this as opposed to everything else?
870817621272350720 2017-06-02 01:41:14 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler Oh no no no. Boycott time.
870816922308423680 2017-06-02 01:38:27 UTC <gaughran444> Just heard Putin say "don't worry be happy." Worst acid flashback ever.
870810917897986048 2017-06-02 01:14:36 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Hope his lawyers are better at this than they are at drafting travel bans.
870803430985662464 2017-06-02 00:44:51 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @postandcourier He is a fraud.
870647876988411904 2017-06-02 14:26:44 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm Wtf?
870624570050531329 2017-06-02 12:54:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Paul Ryan just makes shit up. Look what happens when this famed policy genius has to reveal his "data."
870624090972971009 2017-06-02 12:52:13 UTC <gaughran444> @brianefallon Is this woman a scientist?
870623927562887169 2017-06-02 12:51:34 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @peterdaou Yes because they're so anxious and feel dissed. Seems fair.
870471570384465920 2017-06-01 02:46:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Yeah I wonder why. Ask his wife, Mother.

870461872528609281 2017-06-01 02:07:37 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Hillary got 55% of the vote in Pittsburgh.
870461150776918017 2017-06-01 02:04:45 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell That's it. But he can't touch Obama's legacy. History will be kind to Obama and utterly rejecting of Trump.
870456204417486849 2017-06-01 01:45:06 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon When is her "Santa Claus is Still White" special going to air?
870454923883929600 2017-06-01 01:40:00 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro That is one angry God they're worshipping.
870454620258263040 2017-06-01 01:38:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Unwanted babies and unabated climate change. Thank you Mr President.

870453965779070977 2017-06-01 01:36:12 UTC <gaughran444> @theprospect @BrennanCenter That's going to be one skimpy little file.
870453802008293376 2017-06-01 01:35:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Because there is a god and he loves the Bronx.
870453352609591296 2017-06-01 01:33:46 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro So when they've lost their health care and cows are blowing through their living rooms, will they have second thoughts about their vote?
870448268379140096 2017-06-01 01:13:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon So why is the Pope so concerned?
870428775712010240 2017-06-01 23:56:06 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Yes so construed with that arcane lying under oath thing.
870428530814980096 2017-06-01 23:55:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Yes. And it will never, ever work.

870426984601579521 2017-06-01 23:48:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No matter what you do to dismantle Obama's legacy, he will always be widely loved and admired and you will be reviled.
870426491749838848 2017-06-01 23:47:02 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're woefully unfit for the job and are a one man wrecking crew. America will need years to recover from you. Resign.

870385124189364229 2017-06-01 21:02:39 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich This is about out of touch greedy bastards putting short term profits over long term survival. You should stay away from the Vatican.

870249759604428800 2017-06-01 12:04:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Maybe when they see his DOJ summer picnic.pic.twitter.com/KwFEKv5SmS
870249359811764226 2017-06-01 12:03:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Maybe a prison work release program?
870249160318038016 2017-06-01 12:02:22 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sorry dude, the big story is treason. You should resign and clear out.
870248642942312448 2017-06-01 12:00:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated There is an underlying assumption of basic decency in our system that will have to be revisited when Dems control congress.

869891670539632641 2017-05-31 12:21:50 UTC <gaughran444> @politico His security clearance should have already been revoked. What say you, Jeff Sessions? This is not a close call.
869887584658444289 2017-05-31 12:05:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Every time you say witch hunt you sound more guilty and more crazy.

869337942422061065 2017-05-29 23:41:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated You didn't mean Ivanka's champagne popsicle tweet did you?
869335549202620416 2017-05-29 23:32:01 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn The people of Cuba desperately need American tourism and business. They've done nothing wrong.
869335210902663168 2017-05-29 23:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Go Angela!
869334633875480577 2017-05-29 23:28:22 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This is the Republican party's worst nightmare. But would be a wonderful thing for democracy and civic engagement.
869302403534913537 2017-05-29 21:20:18 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @CaitNapier Nice to see Il Papa looking psyched again.
869302057206992896 2017-05-29 21:18:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @jack @Twitter @deg2 @bessbell I'm trying hard but haven't had the honor yet.
869299525634203648 2017-05-29 21:08:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @IrisL49 He is spineless. Could have gone out as a brave maverick and restored his reputation but clearly is choosing not to.
869298418912563200 2017-05-29 21:04:28 UTC <gaughran444> @tedlieu Is this Kelly guy massively incompetent or crooked? Why is he defending Kushner's entanglement with an enemy state of US?
869293334468190209 2017-05-29 20:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Tell us about your brave service, Newt.
869263767288381441 2017-05-29 18:46:46 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @Rosie Poor baby.
869263437616087044 2017-05-29 18:45:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Go for it.
869263306447622147 2017-05-29 18:44:57 UTC <gaughran444> @anneapplebaum This is what a leader looks like. Too bad we have to look across the Atlantic to see one.
869262938967769091 2017-05-29 18:43:29 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics @nytimes A low point in American history.

869241626807422981 2017-05-29 17:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The brave, not to be confused with Bone Spur Boy.
869241329607487488 2017-05-29 17:17:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Watch those bone spurs! Ouch!
869241216692617217 2017-05-29 17:17:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thanks for these noble sentiments Bone Spur Boy.
869240983195615236 2017-05-29 17:16:14 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 Yeah I'm afraid so.
869239765866098688 2017-05-29 17:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @1stAmend_Rights @eyetwitchy Been there. All true and so hard.
869178484681265152 2017-05-29 13:07:53 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman Doesn't know how NATO works, doesn't understand the concept of classified information, new to separation of powers idea. Quite a guy.
869173798557421570 2017-05-29 12:49:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Not soon enough. But may have been going on for years. And is clearly picking up speed. (Bibi N flake out)
869173213351333888 2017-05-29 12:46:57 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @funder All talk no action. As is his little buddy Graham.
869172556347170816 2017-05-29 12:44:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Aka patriots.
869172345168171008 2017-05-29 12:43:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated His confused thoughts and diminished verbal skills are hard to fake. And he's not smart enough to pull that off.
869171383317692416 2017-05-29 12:39:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Any ETA?
869016711437176832 2017-05-28 02:25:04 UTC <gaughran444> @DanRather And Richard Collins.
869010912245673984 2017-05-28 02:02:01 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm Nicoderm habit. Tan suit.
869009439122128896 2017-05-28 01:56:10 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt How soothing for all those economically anxious voters.
869006199471169537 2017-05-28 01:43:17 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj And not a word from our usually hysterical president.
869005871543713797 2017-05-28 01:41:59 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Why choose?
869004042030256129 2017-05-28 01:34:43 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @donnabrazile @grandmainct It's Maddow grandma. Good night.
869003825646055424 2017-05-28 01:33:52 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha @Stonekettle Because Obama.
869002958683463682 2017-05-28 01:30:25 UTC <gaughran444> @RVAwonk Nor has he said a syllable about the Richard Collins and Portland murders. Disgraceful.
868998306860597248 2017-05-28 01:11:56 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm So beautiful!

868989665810010112 2017-05-28 00:37:36 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes A political weapon? It's a pretty blunt object. Who other than he gets hurt?
868988292104060928 2017-05-28 00:32:08 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Go to sleep President Cringe.
868985786858958849 2017-05-28 00:22:11 UTC <gaughran444> @NormEisen @kylegriffin1 The court should assess costs & fees against the plaintiffs for frivolous litigation. Bunch of bs.
868985323866513410 2017-05-28 00:20:20 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He knows nothing.
868984938401607680 2017-05-28 00:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to denounce the Richard Collins & Portland murders you demented fool?
868984210522083329 2017-05-28 00:15:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Do you have an editor?
868983059919622144 2017-05-28 00:11:21 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @donnabrazile Good.
868979424259080193 2017-05-28 23:56:54 UTC <gaughran444> @donnabrazile Were they put on notice to preserve documents? If so destruction of same could be obstruction.
868975894978801664 2017-05-28 23:42:52 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Total party hack. Faux renegade.
868967435214434305 2017-05-28 23:09:15 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Yeah let's all pile on Comey and forget about trump right Lindsey?
868967259766530048 2017-05-28 23:08:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @Stonekettle He also happens to be full of shit.
868961200792580096 2017-05-28 22:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Egg_radio @peterdaou I'd prefer govt expertise and integrity to automative skills at this point.
868952090445590529 2017-05-28 22:08:17 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @realDonaldTrump @politico He's a transcontinental disaster.
868951529964830720 2017-05-28 22:06:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I want to be there.
868891888836898816 2017-05-28 18:09:04 UTC <gaughran444> @FBI @LindseyGrahamSC @FranTownsend This is a diversion.
868853637501550595 2017-05-28 15:37:04 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT Don't notice him walking out. See, e.g. Elliot Richardson.
868849743845261312 2017-05-28 15:21:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Supertoaste Spent the whole week cringing at the fool's embarrassment of the day.
868849481080504321 2017-05-28 15:20:33 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @amjoyshow So greatful for your keen intelligence and gracious presence on tv. Wish there were more like you.
868848640852471809 2017-05-28 15:17:13 UTC <gaughran444> @studentactivism Too sad. This brave, good man.

868829890715549697 2017-05-28 14:02:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Trump is not bound by, or capable of, logic/consistency.
868829532920393731 2017-05-28 14:01:17 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes. And people still insist he's one of the good ones. He's not.
868828591030767616 2017-05-28 13:57:32 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost We missed the charming part.
868828243784237057 2017-05-28 13:56:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Resign.
868828016025247745 2017-05-28 13:55:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Trip was an international embarrassment. Resign.
868827665729454080 2017-05-28 13:53:52 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump It is the the American people's opinion that you are not fit to be president. Stop torturing our country and resign.
868827389417189376 2017-05-28 13:52:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And perhaps more direct $.
868827185162969088 2017-05-28 13:51:57 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Quislings colluding with Russia are the enemy.
868826948604243968 2017-05-28 13:51:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Delete your account and delete your presidency.
868825995968733184 2017-05-28 13:47:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Not my president.
868686897090101248 2017-05-27 04:34:30 UTC <gaughran444> @CommerceGov @realDonaldTrump Dude you can't read the back of a cereal box.
868678831061823488 2017-05-27 04:02:27 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound like Crazy Eddy circa 1975, not like a president.

868464696445292544 2017-05-27 13:51:33 UTC <gaughran444> @nickconfessore Not so late and utterly stunned.
868464494116311041 2017-05-27 13:50:45 UTC <gaughran444> @samsteinhp Gavone.

868448648438452225 2017-05-27 12:47:47 UTC <gaughran444> @Sifill_LDF 10 years in prison for aggravated assault.
868448290924355584 2017-05-27 12:46:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Don't make me come down there.

868445674702032896 2017-05-27 12:35:58 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @prchovanec And there was nothing proper about this. Russia is an enemy state of the US.
868444800961458176 2017-05-27 12:32:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC That was more than a hint. That was a clarion call. Go Hill!
868444496509493248 2017-05-27 12:31:17 UTC <gaughran444> @pbump Unlike the Republicans.

868409864091045888 2017-05-27 10:13:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No really, just pack it in.  The FBI is coming for you. Spare yourself and the country.
868409611698786304 2017-05-27 10:12:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump It's over, dude. Resign and spare the country and yourself a lot of pain.

868281096718491649 2017-05-26 01:41:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Me too. Over-leveraged little dirt bag wanted $ from Russia. No worries about taking money from an enemy state. Just a guess.
868280196121718784 2017-05-26 01:38:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @digby56 Not at all. Those forms are clear as a bell and tend to jog one's memory.
868279433416855552 2017-05-26 01:35:23 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch So far, so good.

868260940122292228 2017-05-26 00:21:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @tedlieu No more White House. Time for the Big House.

868255788812439553 2017-05-26 00:01:26 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Yes. Big big deal.
868254006543515648 2017-05-26 23:54:21 UTC <gaughran444> Pretty exciting evening, but I wish Chris Matthews was around to scream a lot. Would be so fun.

868246055850213377 2017-05-26 23:22:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Hope he can find a nicely tapered orange jumpsuit.
868244664981352448 2017-05-26 23:17:13 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Why should she go away? Because we have such great leaders? Because she means nothing to young women starting out in the world?
868238537682034688 2017-05-26 22:52:53 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 Me too.
868237300983005187 2017-05-26 22:47:58 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @tedlieu Another guy totally unfit for his job.

868227718298689536 2017-05-26 22:09:53 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @samswey Yeah. It really is.
868223709370351616 2017-05-26 21:53:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @JoyAnnReid He and Obama should remake "My Dinner with Andre."  Would be awesome.
868223171111112705 2017-05-26 21:51:49 UTC <gaughran444> @SER1897 And btw he can be indicted. And I think he will be. And then will crumble.
868222433865719809 2017-05-26 21:48:53 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 Good for the Israeli parliament. Would have loved to see that.
868214321603649536 2017-05-26 21:16:39 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls @DoublePTX2 Haha! Yes, we all excuse pedophiles! No, we all are pedophiles who like to waste federal tax money while we abuse children.
868192644719095808 2017-05-26 19:50:31 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls Wow. Are you being paid with federal tax dollars?
868191632495169537 2017-05-26 19:46:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson An all-time favorite.
868190243618422784 2017-05-26 19:40:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SER1897 I don't think so. He think he's a world class wimp who will crumble under pressure of criminal prosecution.
868175546349486080 2017-05-26 18:42:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SER1897 He can be threatened with prosecution and resign. I think that's what will happen. He won't fight. Too weak & too guilty.
868155914930593794 2017-05-26 17:24:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Poster Boy for the 25th Amendment.
868149319634964480 2017-05-26 16:58:21 UTC <gaughran444> @PhilipRucker He came to get smarter? Better pull up a chair.
868146921453629440 2017-05-26 16:48:50 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @SER1897 Yes but an indictment leading to a resignation is very real.
868146044047171584 2017-05-26 16:45:20 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @mikememoli He was trying to remember the words to "We Are The Champions."
868145473189793792 2017-05-26 16:43:04 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @byjoelanderson We've got a white nationalist president and lots of people don't want to admit it.
868141646025809920 2017-05-26 16:27:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @JoyAnnReid Wow! Dumber than I thought, which is saying a lot. Way to close the loop for the FBI.
868141392576622592 2017-05-26 16:26:51 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That would make her day. Seriously.
868139957080162304 2017-05-26 16:21:09 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @washingtonpost Please not.
868134685200789504 2017-05-26 16:00:12 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @RogerJStoneJr I've never seen a criminal ring talk so much. These guys can't shut up.
868110909830508546 2017-05-26 14:25:44 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell I love this child.  Let's lower the voting age.
868105766665949185 2017-05-26 14:05:18 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman Maybe they're not worthy of respect.
868059199489675265 2017-05-26 11:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @PreetBharara I'm sorry trump fired you but am so glad to hear your intelligent views.
868058574836072448 2017-05-26 10:57:46 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @YanchakSteven @smuckoback Blocked him. I just can't.
868049273727987712 2017-05-26 10:20:49 UTC <gaughran444> @politico He undercuts trump by existing.
868048811867942912 2017-05-26 10:18:58 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Don't engage. Just listen.
867944601969152000 2017-05-25 03:24:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson You were good on Chris Hayes. Would rather you had a show than he.
867930408637218817 2017-05-25 02:28:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Agree. Trump is not a tough guy and he'll lose it. The Clintons and Obama are tough as nails. Trump is a very weak man and will fold.
867912883824361472 2017-05-25 01:18:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRoot @docrocktex26 @SybilT2 They should give him his phone back and a little Xanax.
867908029760638976 2017-05-25 00:59:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRoot @docrocktex26 All in a day's work for this clown.
867906259248455686 2017-05-25 00:52:31 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @4everNeverTrump Wonderful language. The court did not hold back.
867899954051809280 2017-05-25 00:27:28 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @BraddJaffy Could not miss him more.
867842485673918465 2017-05-25 20:39:06 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR @Helloise7 The travel bans are brazenly unconstitutional. Judges don't like that.
867840971949699072 2017-05-25 20:33:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @crazypastor Only to the sighted.
867840523607867392 2017-05-25 20:31:19 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Strong, strong language for a judicial opinion. Well worth reading.
867838792329289730 2017-05-25 20:24:26 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS 4th Circuit opinion brings renewed faith that our republic will survive you.
867835068160638976 2017-05-25 20:09:38 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're a national embarrassment.
867832601855262720 2017-05-25 19:59:50 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveSchmidtSES Steve Schmidt please clone yourself and infiltrate the Republican Party. Many thanks in advance.
867832262074785793 2017-05-25 19:58:29 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff They practically did! Long live Article III!
867830398650384384 2017-05-25 19:51:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It is not immunity. Based on his level of cooperation, etc the ausa will recommend sentence to judge who can follow or depart from it.
867817829487300608 2017-05-25 19:01:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @TrumpsMeltDown By God they did!
867806964776128512 2017-05-25 18:17:58 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 They're polite and perplexed.
867806666850480129 2017-05-25 18:16:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Three cheers for the separation of powers!
867792063420616704 2017-05-25 17:18:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Nate_Cohn @jmartNYT @nytpolitics Hurled bodies.
867791686650523649 2017-05-25 17:17:15 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @BBCWorld Dear World, Americans may not have the best manners but most of us are not as crude as this guy. Really. With apologies, USA
867789233028726785 2017-05-25 17:07:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MasonCrossBooks Banana split. Extra chocolate syrup.
867787902864019456 2017-05-25 17:02:13 UTC <gaughran444> @finneyk Is this horrible story getting the national attention it deserves? Not a peep from the Racist in Chief of course.
867787514681188352 2017-05-25 17:00:40 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @michaelcrowley Maybe with some legos and play-doh he can get it.
867787064946851840 2017-05-25 16:58:53 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander Congrats! No time like the present!
867786853902143489 2017-05-25 16:58:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Profiles in courage.
867786645503959041 2017-05-25 16:57:13 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @BraddJaffy Vile.
867776945416794112 2017-05-25 16:18:40 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @TrueFactsStated Excruciating. How many times a day does this jackass make us all cringe?
867776487306518529 2017-05-25 16:16:51 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Wow. Primitive POS.
867771339985342464 2017-05-25 15:56:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @RVAwonk Fox is like the mafia with these vacations. Like going for a drive.
867724586414215168 2017-05-25 12:50:37 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @dissentingj I think white people never thought he'd hurt them. Oops.
867723048128040960 2017-05-25 12:44:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Serious offense. Arrogant Imbeciles. It will catch up with them.
867720808097079296 2017-05-25 12:35:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Maybe he can bodyslam a woman reporter. Could help.
867719656748044288 2017-05-25 12:31:02 UTC <gaughran444> @NRDC This is critical. Everyone pick up your phones and call. 5 minute investment in the planet. Just do it.
867717486510309376 2017-05-25 12:22:24 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Rick how do the decent republicans take their party back? I know a few (broad minded of me), you're clearly one. What to do?
867576123965702144 2017-05-24 03:00:41 UTC <gaughran444> @BuzzFeedBen Of course.
867571041815678976 2017-05-24 02:40:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @topnetworkeral No it was very really. The republican controlled legislative branch basically ceased functioning to thwart him.
867453178559819777 2017-05-24 18:52:08 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @abbydphillip Don't like Spicer but this is mean.
867452742536712192 2017-05-24 18:50:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @DianeRavitch How very Christian of them. And her.
867450119066718209 2017-05-24 18:39:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Russia is still a thing.
867449999126409216 2017-05-24 18:39:30 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I'm sick of this reality show. Anxiety-producing and boring at the same time.
867449761544237063 2017-05-24 18:38:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Kick something instead Keith! We need your head!
867434334109790208 2017-05-24 17:37:16 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Have these Fox guys never heard of medication?
867429520114167810 2017-05-24 17:18:08 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell I used to say this to my math teachers. Didn't fly.
867429351201099776 2017-05-24 17:17:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Oge @NBCNews @deg2 Grifters gonna grift.
867429101338054657 2017-05-24 17:16:28 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 As they torture themselves to explain whites voting for trump by any means other than the obvious.
867419899529973761 2017-05-24 16:39:54 UTC <gaughran444> Are you serious?
867418588667359232 2017-05-24 16:34:42 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT @EricBoehlert So living, breathing children lose healthcare, education for this guy's imaginary grandchildren?
867389210461970433 2017-05-24 14:37:57 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics Trump trying to work out what just happened:  "He is something" "Maybe a person?" "A guy in a dress?" "Why's he wearing a dress?" "Hungry."
867383591449366528 2017-05-24 14:15:38 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @mattbpete Right you are!
867368708775215105 2017-05-24 13:16:29 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @mattbpete You're assuming trump can read.
867365720610439168 2017-05-24 13:04:37 UTC <gaughran444> @dog_rates @anamariecox @caitgreenwood A determined patriot.
867360564573614080 2017-05-24 12:44:08 UTC <gaughran444> I loved Mookie.
867357798706937856 2017-05-24 12:33:08 UTC <gaughran444> @rtraister @EdgeofSports How long do I have to hang with this gavone?
867352199168491521 2017-05-24 12:10:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Or a senile auntie.
867351832871522304 2017-05-24 12:09:26 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Ivanka thinks she Jackie circa '63. Just like her except for the beauty and dignity part.
867349636234838016 2017-05-24 12:00:42 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Poor Il Papa is not feeling it!
867349264925675521 2017-05-24 11:59:13 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Guess they need a new woman to kick around. A party bereft of ideas.
867348888759521280 2017-05-24 11:57:44 UTC <gaughran444> @matthewamiller Guess he's a legal genius too.
867348582214623233 2017-05-24 11:56:31 UTC <gaughran444> @BraddJaffy @chrissiebooth3 Il Papa is not feeling it.
867203705271177217 2017-05-23 02:20:49 UTC <gaughran444> @statnews @ANNELAMOTT Incipient dementia.
867173270315036677 2017-05-23 00:19:53 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT They need a team.
867164405141819392 2017-05-23 23:44:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I don't know. They're taking their sweet time.
867164154771197952 2017-05-23 23:43:40 UTC <gaughran444> @alivitali As opposed to the paragons of mental health, Duterte and Trump.
867163740210438144 2017-05-23 23:42:01 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Omg. Does he know what this guy has done?
867148536282066944 2017-05-23 22:41:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Maybe couldn't remember it. At least he didn't call them the Biggest Losers.
867147665724911616 2017-05-23 22:38:08 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro A big if.
867147394475073536 2017-05-23 22:37:04 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Grading him on a curve appropriate for an intellectually compromised reality tv star. Honey Boo Boo expected to know Israel = Middle East.
867146767770546177 2017-05-23 22:34:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman Think this is true of other southern states. Great.
867082680072101889 2017-05-23 18:19:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @SenatorLeahy And a startling message to the agency investigating him.
867057777071579136 2017-05-23 16:40:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @ezlusztig If true this is absolutely disgraceful. McConnell was rabid about thwarting Obama and doesn't give a damn about his country.
867051146694852609 2017-05-23 16:14:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Show the Pope your new budget. He'll drop kick you across St Peter's Square.
867049728843948032 2017-05-23 16:08:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump As the Pope says, we must pray for him.
866750828991983623 2017-05-22 20:21:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith Damn.
866750684573597697 2017-05-22 20:20:41 UTC <gaughran444> @bipartisan @IrisL49 So far so good.
866713147482263553 2017-05-22 17:51:31 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Who is that? Looks like Robin Williams.
866712718056837123 2017-05-22 17:49:49 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @Stonekettle Donald Trump. The love machine.
866712370470637568 2017-05-22 17:48:26 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon @bobcesca_go Anyone interested in this history can always pick up a book. Drastic measure, of course.
866711779321237504 2017-05-22 17:46:05 UTC <gaughran444> @acgrayling Be strong.
866711351900680193 2017-05-22 17:44:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Aggressively, blindingly stupid. In a class by himself.
866711094232059905 2017-05-22 17:43:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Owned.
866694938477699072 2017-05-22 16:39:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid It's all in the wrist.
866680677751820288 2017-05-22 15:42:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Reasons to be cheerful.

866651408698945537 2017-05-22 13:46:12 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Evidently. Look what he permitted his thugs to do to our people without comment.
866623727089459200 2017-05-22 11:56:12 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Glad to hear it.
866621542796595200 2017-05-22 11:47:31 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha We can't pull down confederate statues and address gerrymandering, etc? I'm white and I want those statues gone.

866490066796990464 2017-05-21 03:05:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated She almost made it over the wall. Sigh.

866471106592600065 2017-05-21 01:49:44 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It was kind of a little dip bc he wanted that Ike Turner necklace they put on him.
866469753161908225 2017-05-21 01:44:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Come on. Curtsying will wear a fellow out.

865661317729759232 2017-05-19 20:11:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @DMRDynamics What's with this cretin's compulsive need to confess? Surely not a conscience?
865660687766257668 2017-05-19 20:09:25 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @HillaryClinton Comey tried to avoid it by hiding in the curtains.
865660249994285056 2017-05-19 20:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Ever desperate to remain relevant.
865659682500694017 2017-05-19 20:05:26 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF @deray @ShaunKing @VanJones68 @JohnArchibald @splcenter @ConnorASheets @AriBerman @verainstitute Good!
865659177909104641 2017-05-19 20:03:25 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Yeah maybe he can resign and toddle off as part of a plea deal.
865657684594315266 2017-05-19 19:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Our country is degraded every single day by this malevolent clown.
865656395281989632 2017-05-19 19:52:22 UTC <gaughran444> @USATODAY @OccupyDemocrat1 Let there be light.
865655727007776768 2017-05-19 19:49:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @mlcalderone Disgraceful.
865655492055515136 2017-05-19 19:48:47 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Consider cutting out everything other than carbs and alcohol for now.
865655035392180225 2017-05-19 19:46:58 UTC <gaughran444> @amjoyshow This was beneath his dignity and he should apologize. I'm a big Biden fan but this was bad. Almost Trump-esque.
865654700917403648 2017-05-19 19:45:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson If he's retained counsel, that lucky fellow or gal has just hopped out a window.
865653664689471488 2017-05-19 19:41:31 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld On whom?
865653256386600962 2017-05-19 19:39:54 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @POTUS @VP You want people to get used to seeing you near that desk, don't you?
865652655925805058 2017-05-19 19:37:30 UTC <gaughran444> @Matt4CT These were not police attacking people.
865601864577974272 2017-05-19 16:15:41 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon This bullshit with our tax dollars?
865601250372587520 2017-05-19 16:13:14 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @mike_the_mighty @daboomer1963 @Greedy_Bernie @3rdDegreeBern_ Okay this doesn't interest me. Good luck.
865583075308261377 2017-05-19 15:01:01 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Beneath his dignity. One thing we love about him is his kindness. This is not good.
865581280989073410 2017-05-19 14:53:53 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @MikeLevinCA Balls attached with Velcro. Like the rest of his party. Easy on, easy off.
865580776288538625 2017-05-19 14:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 He would have been lynched.
865577977362370560 2017-05-19 14:40:46 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @CharlesPPierce The scheming Ken doll.
865577737628434437 2017-05-19 14:39:48 UTC <gaughran444> @KeithOlbermann @TrueFactsStated You go Claude!
865573460617162752 2017-05-19 14:22:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Albany is a cesspool. Otherwise lovely.
865573163320696832 2017-05-19 14:21:38 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @sarah_grossman That's what it means. Straight up. Pining. Lighting crosses. Whatever.
865572901721866241 2017-05-19 14:20:35 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala Now is the time for all good men (and women) to come to the aid of their country. Go get 'em Senator.
865572174274473984 2017-05-19 14:17:42 UTC <gaughran444> @RayOfLaurel @amjoyshow Can we stop saying he's one of the good ones? He is not.
865571654818291712 2017-05-19 14:15:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Has Rhode Island lost its way? Used to be outstanding.
865571295127375872 2017-05-19 14:14:12 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol @svdate @TheRickWilson Correction: I have heard smart children announce that they're smart. But not one adult.
865571086804635648 2017-05-19 14:13:23 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol @svdate @TheRickWilson I've never heard a smart person say that he or she is smart. Not once.
865570464026046466 2017-05-19 14:10:54 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Like the scene from Oz: you killed her!
865567722805104640 2017-05-19 14:00:01 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls Must be refreshing to talk about someone other than your felonious boss. Enjoy yourself for now.
865567001418358784 2017-05-19 13:57:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram @WomenintheWorld Really?
865566361799491584 2017-05-19 13:54:36 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro And Trump is traveling.
865403358500110336 2017-05-18 03:06:53 UTC <gaughran444> @jackshafer @politico Eeww gross.
865395920375959552 2017-05-18 02:37:20 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @hamiltonnolan Not gracious. Should not have said this.
865375413887000576 2017-05-18 01:15:51 UTC <gaughran444> @GovernorKayIvey @LawyersComm Good!
865374289519943680 2017-05-18 01:11:23 UTC <gaughran444> @WmBrangham @benjaminwittes @NewsHour Hope he brought his purell.
865373924376358913 2017-05-18 01:09:56 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders You're trying to stay relevant while our country is on fire. Get lost.
865368217119850500 2017-05-18 00:47:15 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @juliettekayyem How horrible.
865367832124633088 2017-05-18 00:45:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @nycjim He probably thought he'd get taller if he hung out with Comey.
865367033449414656 2017-05-18 00:42:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Haha!
865354705135906816 2017-05-18 23:53:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Can we pretend we don't know him?
865351962669322242 2017-05-18 23:42:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes all of the above. He should be in one of those lavish assisted living places for rich people. Or jail.
865351678547156993 2017-05-18 23:41:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro McCain piped up. Big deal.
865345884330110976 2017-05-18 23:18:30 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hope it hurts.
865344985939496960 2017-05-18 23:14:56 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Just fucking appalling. With any other president this would dominate the news.
865343419266347008 2017-05-18 23:08:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @deg2 Tic, tic, tic.
865343195059826688 2017-05-18 23:07:49 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Uh huh. Nice try.
865342756251742208 2017-05-18 23:06:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @AUkeibro @JoyAnnReid Omert.
865342663553429504 2017-05-18 23:05:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think he's genuinely senile at this point. Among other good qualities for a POTUS.
865336703963344896 2017-05-18 22:42:02 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Him? What about us?
865335983503548417 2017-05-18 22:39:10 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 And cuter.
865332828158005248 2017-05-18 22:26:37 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper No.
865307474060091394 2017-05-18 20:45:53 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting That's why trump won. It's coming and white people are freaking out.
865306233384951810 2017-05-18 20:40:57 UTC <gaughran444> @mattdpearce No criminal charges against this guy? I don't get it.
865306115747315714 2017-05-18 20:40:29 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer He was trying to say a phallus. Fancy talk is difficult.
865305765325787137 2017-05-18 20:39:05 UTC <gaughran444> @markos Is it love?
865303138793918464 2017-05-18 20:28:39 UTC <gaughran444> @ngameztorres @marcorubio @PatriciaMazzei Not to be confused with the Russian/Trump power grab.
865302990248439809 2017-05-18 20:28:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @DanteLima115 He needs a very skilled criminal lawyer who will smash his phone with a hammer.
865302631543181313 2017-05-18 20:26:38 UTC <gaughran444> @EamonJavers Are they translating or just letting him talk?
865300942312361986 2017-05-18 20:19:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram He doesn't know what galls means. Goals maybe.
865300473498284032 2017-05-18 20:18:04 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @jaketapper @LisaDNews Wow. What a courageous maverick.
865300046899818496 2017-05-18 20:16:22 UTC <gaughran444> @AshleyRParker Don't we all get angry and sad when the psychotic fascist we chose to work for turns out to be very difficult?
865299767550717952 2017-05-18 20:15:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TGowdySC @jasoninthehouse @TeaPainUSA Such a sweet face on that Gowdy fellow.
865248808678174720 2017-05-18 16:52:46 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @BBCBreaking Thank god.
865247523878907907 2017-05-18 16:47:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC That's a jolly thought.
865247401988194304 2017-05-18 16:47:10 UTC <gaughran444> Does this mean stay strong or keep quiet?https://www.yahoo.com/news/investigators-circled-flynn-got-message-trump-stay-strong-145442727.html
865245587855355904 2017-05-18 16:39:58 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP These little fortune cookie messages you're cranking out are funny.
865245285425045504 2017-05-18 16:38:46 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Yeah those 7 am tweets are killing it.
865245088267546625 2017-05-18 16:37:59 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Eeww, forgot about this one.
865244905437835264 2017-05-18 16:37:15 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Know this - the long arm of the law will take him down. Perhaps you too.
865244710511751168 2017-05-18 16:36:29 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You knew about Flynn didn't you?
865244630769643522 2017-05-18 16:36:10 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP Nice stock market crash yesterday. Thanks Donald!
865220091146850304 2017-05-18 14:58:39 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Was in a store buying sneakers for my son and let out a hoot of joy when I learned that Scalia was dead. Today's grief was more private.
865218862769479680 2017-05-18 14:53:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson We're all trying to help this nice fellow but don't know if it's gonna work.pic.twitter.com/cYRXH0wlRp

865176545371017216 2017-05-18 12:05:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So many incoherent thoughts, so little time for spellcheck.
865176185743040513 2017-05-18 12:04:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood We feel besieged at the prospect of his return.
865175104413675521 2017-05-18 11:59:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Btw no good lawyer will represent you if you keep tweeting. They will insist you keep it in your pants.
865172073618042880 2017-05-18 11:47:51 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Oh damn! They gave you your phone back! Let the psychopathy begin!
865156996210798594 2017-05-18 10:47:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So glad to have a law enforcement icon in this important position. Now shake a tailfeather.
865043248301182976 2017-05-17 03:15:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @Acosta Sounds like a scene from the titanic.
865031308589887488 2017-05-17 02:28:30 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld No thanks. Been a tough enough day.

865026405066788866 2017-05-17 02:09:01 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @CHASE03670 Aside from corruption, his war on the planet should drive many young people away. They've got to live with the ramifications.
865025966636236800 2017-05-17 02:07:16 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate Boo-fucking-hoo. Try working for a decent human being. Much easier.

865004053171806209 2017-05-17 00:40:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JamesPMorrison That for sure or how about when he announced his candidacy by savaging Mexicans? Our country has much soul-searching to do.
865003182782431233 2017-05-17 00:36:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @JoyAnnReid How is this guy not in jail?

864925283417300992 2017-05-17 19:27:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes.

864900330462597120 2017-05-17 17:48:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes it is. Worked in fed court for 2 years never saw that happen. They'd just add security as necessary (terrorism trials).

864883692409368576 2017-05-17 16:41:55 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Maybe this will shake the Repubs out of their torpor?
864883370131587072 2017-05-17 16:40:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He could be indicted and then resign as part of a plea deal to avoid prosecution. They could let him claim med reason. Whatever it takes.
864882465789399040 2017-05-17 16:37:03 UTC <gaughran444> @MotherJones @DavidCornDC Maybe they can hide from the law there.
864882278366945281 2017-05-17 16:36:18 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 And because it was the coast guard they were too polite to boo or laugh.

864881561182797825 2017-05-17 16:33:27 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid A range of legislation so we don't have to rely on the basic decency of our future presidents, e.g. mandatory tax return disclosure.
864879826246782980 2017-05-17 16:26:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamSerwer @VaughnHillyard No thanks to you. Get the lead out and call for specific action.

864878831982792704 2017-05-17 16:22:36 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @TrueFactsStated You're very kind.
864878585290657792 2017-05-17 16:21:38 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Let's give due credit to the numbing stupidity that would lead him to ask the head of the FBI to stop investigating Michael Flynn.
864878076831961088 2017-05-17 16:19:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @joanwalsh No we're out to restore the rule of law and our nation's integrity.
864813252001366016 2017-05-17 12:02:01 UTC <gaughran444> @davidgregory @kylegriffin1 This is like watching a baby learn to speak. Come on McCain, get the lead out. Call for specific, meaningful action.
864811977889243136 2017-05-17 11:56:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Many thanks.

864810398352105472 2017-05-17 11:50:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson Am I a bad person for laughing at this?
864810185579220992 2017-05-17 11:49:50 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I want to hear that put to music. New national anthem.

864511933118119937 2017-05-16 16:04:41 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Why this guy hasn't hopped out of a first floor WH window and run off I'll never know. Grab your tattered reputation and fly.
864511590091108352 2017-05-16 16:03:19 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I have a heavy wooden mermaid that landed on my head, leading to an ER visit. Totally willing to donate it for good of the country.
864511219876724736 2017-05-16 16:01:51 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @JoyAnnReid Our system relies more on basic decency than any of us knew. Expect a rash of legislation when Dems are back in, like after watergate.
864507517166116866 2017-05-16 15:47:08 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @olgaNYC1211 Don't see McCain ever taking the next step and questioning trump's fitness for office. Master equivocator.

864483930233344000 2017-05-16 14:13:24 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @yashar Very reassuring.
864483854454857730 2017-05-16 14:13:06 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCFirstRead @MSNBC Not with the Repubs in control.
864483616201605120 2017-05-16 14:12:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid And the day has just begun.
864482645497057280 2017-05-16 14:08:18 UTC <gaughran444> @louisjnelson @politico Profiles in courage. Take off your flag pin. You don't care about your country.
864467129126584321 2017-05-16 13:06:39 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Probably hasn't done that in years. Can't blame him.
864466958061899776 2017-05-16 13:05:58 UTC <gaughran444> @RepSwalwell Thank you for speaking up. Please talk to your cohorts about duty to country and integrity.
864465674676183041 2017-05-16 13:00:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @kylegriffin1 Does he recall that he fired Comey?
864465120382132224 2017-05-16 12:58:40 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Gutsy move Susan. Your country is on fire. Can you ramp it up a bit?
864454366895407104 2017-05-16 12:15:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Oh shit! You're still president! Dude, pull the plug. This isn't working out at all.
864451509303615488 2017-05-16 12:04:35 UTC <gaughran444> @USDOJ @BJHare @tedlieu It's tucked away with McMaster's integrity. And the decency of the Republican Party.
864451284388261888 2017-05-16 12:03:41 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox @davidfrum From your mouth to god's ears.
864451097280360450 2017-05-16 12:02:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And if Obama has done it there'd have been burning crosses.
864447548001570816 2017-05-16 11:48:50 UTC <gaughran444> @benjaminwittes People with integrity would walk out.
864446745358544899 2017-05-16 11:45:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Flag waving fools who don't give a damn about their country.
864446496397250561 2017-05-16 11:44:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro He's too busy destroying the universe to create jobs. Bigger fish to fry.
864445093637484544 2017-05-16 11:39:05 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos They should submerge it in water. Or him.
864444371911020545 2017-05-16 11:36:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Prescient.
864294033472069633 2017-05-15 01:38:50 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @kylegriffin1 Great. The White House is being child proofed.
864290797683953665 2017-05-15 01:25:58 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Loyal soul.
864285717295443968 2017-05-15 01:05:47 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump Or because his frontal lobes are turning into ricotta cheese?

864271744667975680 2017-05-15 00:10:15 UTC <gaughran444> Didn't this Swalwell fellow get the "say nothing, do nothing" memo?
864263171707727874 2017-05-15 23:36:12 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Lovely to see him at this tense moment.
864260001090736129 2017-05-15 23:23:36 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @JoyAnnReid And yet said nothing. His speciality.
864257853812551681 2017-05-15 23:15:04 UTC <gaughran444> Steve Schmidt: the credibility of this Administration is shattered. Schmidt is a republican with integrity. A dying breed.
864254713956622337 2017-05-15 23:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @tedlieu @MaryMarybrogdon I'm aware. It was a joke.
864251572859043840 2017-05-15 22:50:06 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @kurteichenwald They'd be burning crosses.

864249974405640192 2017-05-15 22:43:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Nixon was intelligent. Bad guy, but smart.

864246079407239169 2017-05-15 22:28:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @TrueFactsStated Absolutely. Another day, another calamity. He's a menace to our country and he's got to go.
864245307789463553 2017-05-15 22:25:12 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorDurbin @JaneGrader Absolutely. Lock him up!
864244152741105665 2017-05-15 22:20:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @SenatorDurbin And some cognitive testing while they're at it.
864239449231826944 2017-05-15 22:01:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Certainly the ravages of dementia are.

864164664414023681 2017-05-15 17:04:46 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Compelling advocacy.
864164530225643520 2017-05-15 17:04:14 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Don't think that support extends to FBI agents.
864162276399607809 2017-05-15 16:55:16 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC You're in no position to decree what is and is not courageous. Grow a spine and stand up against Trump. And you misspelled judgment.
864157430372061188 2017-05-15 16:36:01 UTC <gaughran444> @Lily_v_Shtupp @PreetBharara They need to have integrity to do that. In short supply at the WH these days.
864153941310943232 2017-05-15 16:22:09 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Noncitizen voting is a racist myth. People without papers don't drive over 50 mph, much less engage in voter fraud.
864148139443400705 2017-05-15 15:59:06 UTC <gaughran444> @VP Does this include FBI agents or are you guys less fond of them?
864144578911367177 2017-05-15 15:44:57 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean @CNN The people of principal are speaking out.
864144199209414656 2017-05-15 15:43:26 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum Says the man largely responsible for Congress letting the Independent Counsel law expire. Thanks for chiming in Ken!
864143774020231168 2017-05-15 15:41:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hopefully they'll lean on the underlings with threats of mind-blowing sentences till they sing like Trump's great friend Pavarotti.

864142557835661313 2017-05-15 15:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Not a minute too soon.
864142441817022466 2017-05-15 15:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson It's the least important part of everything, but this is all so goddamned embarrassing.

864115767893250048 2017-05-15 13:50:28 UTC <gaughran444> @mmurraypolitics @Quinnipiac @JoyAnnReid Critical point. America will be so great by then the racists may well relax a bit.

862644180526534656 2017-05-11 12:22:54 UTC <gaughran444> @jelani9 Sounds like he got played but he better resign now or that reputation is trashed.
862643803651440641 2017-05-11 12:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @BillKristol Please encourage them. History will treat them very kindly.
862643463736745985 2017-05-11 12:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Just wait. He will be.
862643378990743552 2017-05-11 12:19:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @TrueFactsStated Release the hounds!
862642802743799808 2017-05-11 12:17:25 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @BraddJaffy It just never ends with this guy. Such a subpar human being.
862498761242800128 2017-05-10 02:45:03 UTC <gaughran444> @loudmouthworld @alcamus @LouiseMensch @pacelattin That's right Jared.
862489019980161028 2017-05-10 02:06:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes, I think so too.
862483348886884352 2017-05-10 01:43:49 UTC <gaughran444> @dissentingj She doesn't sound entirely well. Wow.
862482838913994752 2017-05-10 01:41:47 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. This is our best hope. A latter day deep throat to spill the beans.
862482166978142209 2017-05-10 01:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Ye$.
862476497340125184 2017-05-10 01:16:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Tamper, tamper, tamper.
862475975006748672 2017-05-10 01:14:31 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @RVAwonk Profiles in Courage.
862475100964220928 2017-05-10 01:11:02 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @DaHalperin Then Rosenstein should square his shoulders and speak up
862475100267974657 2017-05-10 01:11:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Exactly. Party before country. They won't do anything that will threaten their power, even if the US is on its knees.
862475100129558529 2017-05-10 01:11:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Narcissism, dementia and plain old stupidity. A winning formula for the leader of the free world.
862473302304010240 2017-05-10 01:03:53 UTC <gaughran444> @PavloKlimkin @VP Unless your boss Vladimir tells you to back off.
862472975106420736 2017-05-10 01:02:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Damn. They're going to go down with their man. Blind loyalty.
862464088282189824 2017-05-10 00:27:17 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @jimsciutto Make it rain!!
862463560684843008 2017-05-10 00:25:11 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @mike_pence @GlennThrush So at some point will Rosenstein have the decency to set the record straight?
862455268940161024 2017-05-10 23:52:14 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Charm??
862453106877112326 2017-05-10 23:43:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MyNextLifeDebi @SethAbramson Of course he'll plead the 5th.
862444108153008132 2017-05-10 23:07:53 UTC <gaughran444> @politico The invertebrate is back in action.
862443778422054913 2017-05-10 23:06:34 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet @armandodkos He and his boss.
862442800515776513 2017-05-10 23:02:41 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJohnMcCain @traceygaughran @kumailn Probably not a damn thing. Some quasi-tough talk followed by inaction.
862441434322018305 2017-05-10 22:57:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The FBI is doing just fine, and spirits will soar when you're behind bars.
862440903050395650 2017-05-10 22:55:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Yeah but reputation could/should suffer.
862439919905628162 2017-05-10 22:51:14 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump @jasonbaum Very encouraging. Thank you!
862439077752299520 2017-05-10 22:47:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram I don't see how a respectable law firm would take such a stupid case.
862437657007329280 2017-05-10 22:42:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @impeach_d_trump McConnell is blindingly full of shit.
862437122929827840 2017-05-10 22:40:08 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw What great stature is he losing? His fame for hostility towards gay and reproductive rights?
862436490034524160 2017-05-10 22:37:37 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala What integrity?
862436218730164224 2017-05-10 22:36:32 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro So what's left? Like 5 guys at an elks lodge who are hanging tough?
862392367449600000 2017-05-10 19:42:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Huge.
862360375714607104 2017-05-10 17:35:10 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Do tell. Because today doesn't suck enough.
862360099842654210 2017-05-10 17:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @politico If he says no does trump fire him?
862357915126071296 2017-05-10 17:25:23 UTC <gaughran444> @sgrant525 @owillis The boss is happy.
862357548707565568 2017-05-10 17:23:56 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP America trusts the FBI. Not you or your psychotic boss.
862357207077326849 2017-05-10 17:22:34 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP You're an accessory to obstruction of justice. Keep quiet.
862356798287872000 2017-05-10 17:20:57 UTC <gaughran444> @SusaMorgan @AdamHSays Is this at the graduation she had no business attending?
862356213266296834 2017-05-10 17:18:37 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @BenjySarlin Profiles in courage.  Susan the country is on fire.
862352840098021377 2017-05-10 17:05:13 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Not a goddamned one.
862352143428308993 2017-05-10 17:02:27 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum It was the right decision at the right time if the goal was to obstruct justice.
862351563238592512 2017-05-10 17:00:09 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Exactly right. No one with a shred of decency will get near it.
862351038669520896 2017-05-10 16:58:03 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Treasonous POS.
862350750365753344 2017-05-10 16:56:55 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Respected?
862350449625759744 2017-05-10 16:55:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MilesParks @rachelnpr @DomenicoNPR Hope she doesn't end up with the blade of a skate in her head.
862348935159054337 2017-05-10 16:49:42 UTC <gaughran444> @RobbyMook That is the critical difference. Party before country.
862330036107476993 2017-05-10 15:34:36 UTC <gaughran444> @finneyk @brianefallon You know they did.
862322711934193665 2017-05-10 15:05:30 UTC <gaughran444> @NYCoach1 @RVAwonk McConnell doesn't give a damn about America. Party before country.
862322386284183556 2017-05-10 15:04:12 UTC <gaughran444> @PostOpinions @washingtonpost Thank you Delphic oracle. Grow a pair and call for an independent investigation.
862303572549132288 2017-05-10 13:49:27 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Sorry but you don't need to be an all-star to know the answer to this one.
862303431247224832 2017-05-10 13:48:53 UTC <gaughran444> @ChuckGrassley @davidfrum @foxandfriends Fascist.
862303212312944640 2017-05-10 13:48:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SenateMajLdr @joshtpm Traitor.
862300848176680960 2017-05-10 13:38:37 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @Olivianuzzi Because Comey was also investigating him.
862300278837653504 2017-05-10 13:36:21 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Okay Eva Braun. Thanks for weighing in.
862299726628220928 2017-05-10 13:34:10 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes I'm upset enough this morning without seeing this picture.
862299239203971072 2017-05-10 13:32:14 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Our country is on its knees. Who are the patriots? Will Repubs call for an independent counsel & investigation?
862295754857172993 2017-05-10 13:18:23 UTC <gaughran444> @joseiswriting Heartbreaking.
862294695178891264 2017-05-10 13:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Troubled is not going to cut it. Have to denounce and demand independent prosecutor.  Are there enough Repubs who put country first?
862294244769366017 2017-05-10 13:12:23 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Disgraceful. Don't want to hear another syllable about how he is one of the good ones.
862293695399415809 2017-05-10 13:10:12 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Take it easy Bone Spur Boy.
862293543968288768 2017-05-10 13:09:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are wholly unfit for office and will be removed.
862292663739060225 2017-05-10 13:06:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @drivenRio State AG. Not an employer of fed govt.
862274608170500096 2017-05-10 11:54:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @DPetagrew Investigations have to be meticulous and thorough or the charges fall apart. How I wish he could get the lead out!!
862273622089633792 2017-05-10 11:50:26 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Not a chance. It's party over country for those guys, with a few isolated exceptions.
862273416996544512 2017-05-10 11:49:37 UTC <gaughran444> @DustinGiebel Please no. As he said after 9/11, this is more than we can all bear.
862273066835079168 2017-05-10 11:48:14 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Any sentient person should have a problem with the official reason behind this firing.
862269591657091072 2017-05-10 11:34:25 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thank you. Wish we could hit the fast forward button, but it doesn't work that way. I'm glad you're here.
862268746995556354 2017-05-10 11:31:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You will be replaced by someone who will restore America's dignity and the rule of law.
862268381566783488 2017-05-10 11:29:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are a lawless thug but you will not prevail.
862268153023389697 2017-05-10 11:28:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AttyDeniseBrown Not a chance.
862268067740516353 2017-05-10 11:28:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MorningEdition @NPRinskeep Because he was closing in on the White House. #thuglife
862267644992507904 2017-05-10 11:26:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. Claude, what do you think Schneiderman is up to now? Trump can't touch him.
862267364557160448 2017-05-10 11:25:34 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @PattiFromNYC These are very trying times. We don't have to listen to someone named Huckabee Sanders.
862260206285324288 2017-05-10 10:57:07 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes That is not a serious question.
862258488310996992 2017-05-10 10:50:18 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @20committee Not that hard. It's called a coup.
862257105952284672 2017-05-10 10:44:48 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel @jpaceDC Challenge? How about trash?
862256475275763713 2017-05-10 10:42:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Claude what about Eric Schneiderman? Trump can't touch him. What's he doing?
862132062492524545 2017-05-09 02:27:55 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Invertebrate.
862131317152075776 2017-05-09 02:24:58 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Invertebrate.
862130473304281089 2017-05-09 02:21:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Good for you.
862129852299841537 2017-05-09 02:19:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Patriots. Anyone care to join them?
862123612081446916 2017-05-09 01:54:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Shit, meet fan.
862119778118496256 2017-05-09 01:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @DerekCressman The water is coming over the dam.
862119291163987970 2017-05-09 01:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Yes. Surprised by that.
862116266475216896 2017-05-09 01:25:09 UTC <gaughran444> @eclecticbrotha Haha.
862115796474056705 2017-05-09 01:23:17 UTC <gaughran444> @4everNeverTrump He sure as hell is trying. Hope it runs over him too.
862115555989475330 2017-05-09 01:22:20 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickyDavila If it is the timing is extraordinary.
862115184227340288 2017-05-09 01:20:51 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @Austan_Goolsbee @MarkWarner Please appeal to your republican peers - the patriotic ones - to join you. If there are any.
862114834770481152 2017-05-09 01:19:28 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Will an ounce of pressure come from the Republicans? Party or country gentlemen?
862114441403432960 2017-05-09 01:17:54 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics He seriously doesn't give a hoot about the optics, does he?
862113269175201792 2017-05-09 01:13:15 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Yes. A sea of invertebrates.
862112940748673024 2017-05-09 01:11:57 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Good timing!!!
862107177665916928 2017-05-09 00:49:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate So let's not spend a lot of time focused on him. Pawn.
862106864426909697 2017-05-09 00:47:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @20committee Yeah that is the word.
862103652428853248 2017-05-09 00:35:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JesseLehrich Very important distinction. Where are the Republican patriots? Not one?
862103413810757634 2017-05-09 00:34:05 UTC <gaughran444> @JesseLehrich Okay, we don't need to see the James Comey motorcade on the la freeway. #OJredux
862096947712323589 2017-05-09 00:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @LouiseMensch Graham has no spine. All about unmasking. Staying far away from real issues. Coward.
862096536188190720 2017-05-09 00:06:45 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @nytimes The man who recused himself from Russia/trump investigation.
862096040689795077 2017-05-09 00:04:47 UTC <gaughran444> @johnson_carrie @nprpolitics Well they did for almost 5 months. The reason given for this firing is pretextual bullshit.
862089905786281985 2017-05-09 23:40:25 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Because they care about their country. Anyone who cares is aghast.
862087968286265344 2017-05-09 23:32:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @peterdaou Maybe those hopes were realistic and that's why Trump canned him.
862087450012909570 2017-05-09 23:30:39 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC You're a lackey and your grammar sucks.  Grow a spine.
862086486702862341 2017-05-09 23:26:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 Not in the Republican Party.
862086037316743168 2017-05-09 23:25:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid There is not one. Not one.
862085843753852928 2017-05-09 23:24:16 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Quislings one and all.
862085713017393152 2017-05-09 23:23:45 UTC <gaughran444> @CoreyCiorciari Il Duce.
862085403632955392 2017-05-09 23:22:31 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC @samdman95 Remember Graham was stuck on unmasking and leaking yesterday with Sally Yates. Obfuscating coward.
862084769768775680 2017-05-09 23:20:00 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @NBCNews Balls attached by Velcro. Easy on, easy off. Even within one statement.
862084452104765440 2017-05-09 23:18:44 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @RonBrownstein So far not a peep.
862074317131177984 2017-05-09 22:38:28 UTC <gaughran444> @sarahkendzior How could Sessions take part in this decision after he recused himself from Russian investigation? #thuglife
862066837454020608 2017-05-09 22:08:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is a full-out assault on the rule of law by the Thug in Chief. Worse than Nixon with Archibald Cox. Lawless thug.
862065224962244608 2017-05-09 22:02:20 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost That's bullshit. FBI closing in on him so this primitive thug canned him.
862063100920573954 2017-05-09 21:53:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Omg!!! Archibald Cox x 1000!!!!!
862062770396725248 2017-05-09 21:52:35 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Holy shit!!!! Archibald Cox x 1000!
862055485280833538 2017-05-09 21:23:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No borscht for dinner.
862055319408705537 2017-05-09 21:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 So so hard to use the R word! Might hurt someone's feelings.

862045563092705284 2017-05-09 20:44:12 UTC <gaughran444> @christogrozev Whew. Glad that's resolved. Thanks!
862042712274604033 2017-05-09 20:32:53 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @soledadobrien The latest euphemism for racism.
862042144239910913 2017-05-09 20:30:37 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump There's the Republican Party right there. All partisan, all the time. Never mind the country.
862041735844818945 2017-05-09 20:29:00 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Our rumor is more fun.
862034128379793408 2017-05-09 19:58:46 UTC <gaughran444> @sfpelosi Maybe he should just pinky swear and we can call off the dogs.
862033900335497219 2017-05-09 19:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @peterdaou Which party cares about America and which only cares about itself?
862033607451455488 2017-05-09 19:56:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @RepAdamSchiff And during that time he spoke on the phone to Putin with Flynn present.
861938146468139008 2017-05-09 13:37:22 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy @akarl_smith Reasons to be cheerful.
861938040209633280 2017-05-09 13:36:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MattAsherS @RVAwonk His presidency is a platform for disinformation.
861937851189125120 2017-05-09 13:36:12 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch You're giving WH too much credit. They don't understand the constitution and are not that organized.

861929586698973184 2017-05-09 13:03:22 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Cultural anxiety, aka racism.
861923223654588416 2017-05-09 12:38:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @RVAwonk Right - never mind our nation was attacked by an enemy state. Leaks and unmasking. They don't care about our country.

861781934241976321 2017-05-08 03:16:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Good. Hopefully working furiously on indictments.
861781380480544768 2017-05-08 03:14:26 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT It will be problematic and filled with belligerent weirdness. Like that.

861768684070633472 2017-05-08 02:23:59 UTC <gaughran444> @DMRDynamics @JohnWDean Full cover-up mode & banking on the whole country being as dumb as he is.
861762333198123009 2017-05-08 01:58:45 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No biggest story is you & Flynn on the phone with your boss Vlad after you were told that Flynn was on the take.
861761889801555968 2017-05-08 01:56:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Obama fired him & told you not to hire him. Remember?
861761683374649345 2017-05-08 01:56:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump When your sorry ass is in jail. Just don't waste our $ on appeals.
861761514663026688 2017-05-08 01:55:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How long are the Repub quislings going to dick around with "unmasking" & "leaks" before they react to an enemy state attacking U.S.?
861754113285140481 2017-05-08 01:26:05 UTC <gaughran444> @mattmfm Hopefully a nadir in American history.

861688371718103040 2017-05-08 21:04:51 UTC <gaughran444> Does Sally Yates have political aspirations? Please say yes. #ridesallyride

861441605722677248 2017-05-07 04:44:18 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @VABVOX Terrible.
861429990407249921 2017-05-07 03:58:08 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS We know you saw Obama get the Profiles in Courage Award. He's smarter, kinder and better than you in every way. Deal with it.

861050734770573312 2017-05-06 02:51:07 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Very surprised that Comey named Giuliani in that hearing. Hope he nails him but look forward to FBI getting back to silence till charges.

859095055788900352 2017-05-01 17:19:57 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Good. Let them try cage fighting.
859029827998941184 2017-05-01 13:00:45 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos They not only won't deal. A cottage industry offering any explanation other than race has sprung up.
859028830207586304 2017-05-01 12:56:47 UTC <gaughran444> @USARedOrchestra Oh god. It hurts.
859024177101197312 2017-05-01 12:38:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Comey wants to redeem himself. Doesn't want to be remembered solely as the guy who threw the election to worst president ever.
858878631698997248 2017-04-30 02:59:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think he's all talk.
858858940775501825 2017-04-30 01:41:42 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos He sounds like the Ray Liotta character on a cocaine bender in Goodfellas.
858856751151624192 2017-04-30 01:33:00 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @dissentingj No this is bullshit.
858856000966860801 2017-04-30 01:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Yeah and Hannity, O'Reilly, etc. What a sluggers' row.
858855418096955392 2017-04-30 01:27:43 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @JoyAnnReid Glad he's a leading expert on tuning out bullshit.
858837145406107648 2017-04-30 00:15:06 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation Yes. Don't like that sanitizing term.
858832161016860672 2017-04-30 23:55:18 UTC <gaughran444> @CapehartJ Is this guy still alive? If so, why no place for him in Trump cabinet?
858831741544542208 2017-04-30 23:53:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thank god. We could die waiting for those.
858830898678165504 2017-04-30 23:50:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @Nysteveo2AOLcom Remember dignity?
858829202723876864 2017-04-30 23:43:32 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Look on the bright side. Maybe Duterte will eat his liver with "salt and vinegar."
858824467874811904 2017-04-30 23:24:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @DavidYankovich I hope he catches everything in prison.
858823546960850945 2017-04-30 23:21:04 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien Absolutely nothing.
858817401491771392 2017-04-30 22:56:39 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics There's not enough viagra in the world for these guys.
858793386685366277 2017-04-30 21:21:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Champagne is chilling.
858791879999201280 2017-04-30 21:15:14 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Oooh! Scary! Jackasses.
858772113804722176 2017-04-30 19:56:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson @TrueFactsStated Money laundering? Do you know who the defendants are & are not saying yet? Or waiting to learn?
858771616486092800 2017-04-30 19:54:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated What is penalty for violation of FARA?
858767645524594688 2017-04-30 19:38:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yeah, that pretty much covers it.
858693015631736832 2017-04-30 14:42:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryMarybrogdon @New_Narrative Disgraceful.
858671089760829441 2017-04-30 13:15:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @wardie2 It was absolutely huge and an insane time. But the underlying misconduct was small potatoes compared with what today looks like.
858649585035694080 2017-04-30 11:49:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hopefully they'll be highly popular in jail.
858647250041438209 2017-04-30 11:40:31 UTC <gaughran444> @SueMoenius @TeaPainUSA @AUkeibro With the goddamned Joker teetering on the top.
858537204255272960 2017-04-29 04:23:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Watergate was downright quaint compared to the current situation. Internal US politics v. American democracy co-opted by enemy state.
858534918443368448 2017-04-29 04:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @tedlieu America the beautiful.

858514709041082369 2017-04-29 02:53:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Absolutely.
858505270447702016 2017-04-29 02:16:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @healthylifekids Of course. Action is critical.
858438905208688640 2017-04-29 21:52:38 UTC <gaughran444> @BretStephensNYT @STWorg @DavidCornDC @SusaMorgan Awful.
858437619553796097 2017-04-29 21:47:32 UTC <gaughran444> @SkyMarshalMeru Yes.  All of the above.
858430973884727296 2017-04-29 21:21:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @realpaolathomas @tedlieu This is his sole accomplishment.
858411411269189632 2017-04-29 20:03:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate I never knew quite how many ghastly people existed until this administration. Like they're reproducing by fission.
858410754437001218 2017-04-29 20:00:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes he has a lot to prove. And I think he'll do it.
858410490355167233 2017-04-29 19:59:44 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Look at climate march. That's what a big crowd looks like. Not a familiar sight for you.
858402511987896321 2017-04-29 19:28:01 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT A lot of people mad about these uppity negroes.  Too damned bad.
858399712482918400 2017-04-29 19:16:54 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter And fill up private prisons.
858371483881656320 2017-04-29 17:24:44 UTC <gaughran444> @NAACP_LDF Thank you! Way to go!!
858370679107973121 2017-04-29 17:21:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander Handcuffs.
858320615635341313 2017-04-29 14:02:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated When your son's at bat put that phone down or he'll be scarred for life. Otherwise cool.
858307774693998592 2017-04-29 13:11:34 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden He was the ultimate pragmatist. Arguably tried to trick a reluctance US into WWII. No purity tests for that guy. One of the greats.
858304053553487872 2017-04-29 12:56:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated First things first. Have fun.
858301124872470529 2017-04-29 12:45:09 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @GeorgeTakei And everything, from rogue meteors to split ends, is Obama's fault.
858300737385877504 2017-04-29 12:43:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Or back away from the Democratic Party. That would work too.
858283403673833472 2017-04-29 11:34:44 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics Probably Bernie exposure syndrome.
858282222884978689 2017-04-29 11:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Tremendous news. And we can be dispirited without being short on faith. The rule of law will be restored.
858271439245508609 2017-04-29 10:47:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics A mediocre senator with minimal accomplishments taking irrelevant potshots at one of our greatest presidents is distasteful.
858270639416897536 2017-04-29 10:44:00 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Our gestapo.
858192800919285761 2017-04-28 05:34:42 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hallelujah!
858081381720743936 2017-04-28 22:11:58 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes The war of the insane, impotent men. God help us.
858081082159353856 2017-04-28 22:10:47 UTC <gaughran444> Not really but would love him to stay home now and support her. Quietly.
858080762264006657 2017-04-28 22:09:30 UTC <gaughran444> @WomenintheWorld @MattAsherS @RVAwonk Join the club, sister.
858062727213973504 2017-04-28 20:57:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Did they add sombreros and maple leaves to clue him in?
858011881340096519 2017-04-28 17:35:48 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Fuck yeah.
857997188294684672 2017-04-28 16:37:25 UTC <gaughran444> @NRA @POTUS Blood on your tiny tiny hands.
857966329122484225 2017-04-28 14:34:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why choose?
857965989660688386 2017-04-28 14:33:26 UTC <gaughran444> @DHSgov @LawyersComm @Derrick_James Disgraceful.
857936492496289792 2017-04-28 12:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @VP @realDonaldTrump Yes Bone Spur Boy, you love our vets. Not enough to join them when it was your turn. But the love is there.
857932908035805185 2017-04-28 12:21:59 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @Pthorn6A Yes, the smarter, better, beloved black guy. It kills him.
857932416173920257 2017-04-28 12:20:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Yes. This image has reoccurred to me repeatedly since 11/8. The con man behind the curtain.
857932055019237376 2017-04-28 12:18:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Love Obama. Hate Trump. Like most of America. Check out the polls.
857928187573141504 2017-04-28 12:03:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @Mopshell They should resolve it with a duel.
857927068188856321 2017-04-28 11:58:47 UTC <gaughran444> @jonathanchait Jared to the rescue!
857926290325876736 2017-04-28 11:55:41 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Mind blowing. And they hold up Reagan as their patron saint.
857924453669449728 2017-04-28 11:48:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Whew! That's better!
857924036449488896 2017-04-28 11:46:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Worst affirmative action program ever.
857923721255952385 2017-04-28 11:45:29 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @kaitlancollins Hopefully he'll be incarcerated next year.
857786534174568449 2017-04-27 02:40:21 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
857780219066945536 2017-04-27 02:15:15 UTC <gaughran444> @alexburnsNYT @xenocryptsite Wait, is this the guy who . . . ?
857780129917005824 2017-04-27 02:14:54 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix @deg2 Hang on. He will be apprehended.
857752365671362560 2017-04-27 00:24:34 UTC <gaughran444> @cjwerleman @AUkeibro Can't stand it.
857751975944912897 2017-04-27 00:23:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @deg2 @KilohanaKona Maybe so. Sweet deal for the lawyer.
857740915351461888 2017-04-27 23:39:04 UTC <gaughran444> Lotta joy emanating from that store.
857737745455869953 2017-04-27 23:26:29 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Ridiculous.
857734498448015360 2017-04-27 23:13:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @deg2 Yes in that range. For about an hour of work. Terrible for the victim but lucrative cake walk for atty.
857732263806685184 2017-04-27 23:04:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @cjwerleman Oh for the love of god.
857729975272837122 2017-04-27 22:55:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So bitter that I wasn't his lawyer. Easiest case in history.
857729406940438528 2017-04-27 22:53:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. I wonder if there's a gene for dishonesty. Some folks really have it.
857722734943645697 2017-04-27 22:26:50 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think Nixon was a brilliant statesman and dedicated public servant compared to the crazy bastard we've got now. And I hated Nixon.
857683309928861700 2017-04-27 19:50:10 UTC <gaughran444> @AngryBlackLady Cornel West is a fraud.
857678800112553986 2017-04-27 19:32:15 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yeah. Sanctimony is not her friend.
857678276067831812 2017-04-27 19:30:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SenWarren @CNNPolitics @Eugene_Scott Get over it Liz. Bigger fish to fry.
857666148959125504 2017-04-27 18:41:59 UTC <gaughran444> FFS. Really.
857664239854661633 2017-04-27 18:34:24 UTC <gaughran444> @ChelseaClinton @SophieInCT @peterdaou Apple, Tree.
857660707659186177 2017-04-27 18:20:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So cool! Like "The Apprentice" for traitors!
857659051592876033 2017-04-27 18:13:47 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Haters gonna hate. Fuck 'em.
857592723603415040 2017-04-27 13:50:13 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Sorry, I think it's a bs good cop/bad cop operation. Except that they're both crooks.
857591817390501888 2017-04-27 13:46:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's not fully persuaded that any brown people are citizens.
857562601911406592 2017-04-27 11:50:31 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes, one who can also help with the heartbreak of bone spurs.
857404941190791171 2017-04-26 01:24:02 UTC <gaughran444> @RobbieGramer Please let this be true.
857270683734339585 2017-04-26 16:30:32 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Yes. The separation of powers. Which he has never heard of.
857269974171340800 2017-04-26 16:27:43 UTC <gaughran444> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Not my flotus. Ever.
857259248576811012 2017-04-26 15:45:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realpaolathomas @EricBoehlert Darwin warned us about this.
857220931332308994 2017-04-26 13:12:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I remember crouching under those desks and thinking, " is this going to work?"
857211905710206976 2017-04-26 12:36:59 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Will the DOJ investigate this or are they too busy threatening sanctuary cities these days?
857211516994678787 2017-04-26 12:35:26 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @blakehounshell Maybe he should send an armada there.
856976818632568832 2017-04-25 21:02:50 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw I should hope so. You're Laurence Tribe!
856970965695246336 2017-04-25 20:39:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yeah. In that job it should be country over ego. But I could be smothered with a pussy hat for saying so.
856957786609135621 2017-04-25 19:47:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Good to hear. I have too. It's sacrilege. But the whole Notorious RBG thing is bs. The justices are fungible. We need them to stay alive.
856955120575283202 2017-04-25 19:36:36 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I know. If Kennedy resigns we're screwed. And I'm pissed at RBG for not resigning during Obama's first term. Country first in that job.
856848581478805504 2017-04-25 12:33:15 UTC <gaughran444> @bjimd @DMRDynamics @docrocktex26 @TrueFactsStated People with dementia get very disoriented when admitted to the hospital. Imagine tossing one in the White House.
856838998853079040 2017-04-25 11:55:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Brass balls.
856838737514332160 2017-04-25 11:54:08 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw First bidder: Jefferson Sessions.
856836744364388353 2017-04-25 11:46:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Two branches of our government are paralyzed by partisanship and self-interest.
856834328403353600 2017-04-25 11:36:37 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @MAlib4eva Is our Dept of Justice still allowed to investigate these matters or has Sessions pulled the plug?
856834120755937282 2017-04-25 11:35:48 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 From the looks of it, they could have put out a platter of sandwiches and a box of Joe. Where did all that money go?
856676106459598848 2017-04-24 01:07:54 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @SophieInCT @peterdaou No I think that crap is reserved for women.
856675853924794369 2017-04-24 01:06:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. And the more he is humiliated (poll numbers, 100 days, Obama reemergence) the more likely he is to lash out. Jesus.
856671817653792769 2017-04-24 00:50:52 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Prepare for geysers of sanctimony.
856662141742575616 2017-04-24 00:12:25 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's bleak. And he's getting crazier by the minute.
856657684476682240 2017-04-24 23:54:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yeah. Is there a single sane, competent person advising him? Just awful.
856652504846786560 2017-04-24 23:34:07 UTC <gaughran444> @IrwinJames327 Horrifying thought.
856652379428704256 2017-04-24 23:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Horrible thought. But he's deranged. Do you think military advisors might restrain him?
856638830211936257 2017-04-24 22:39:47 UTC <gaughran444> @PplsAction @SenSanders Oh please. You've been endlessly divisive. Give it a rest.
856638638972653569 2017-04-24 22:39:01 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel I hope that's all it is.
856638401155432448 2017-04-24 22:38:05 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This crazy bastard. Dear god.
856612098792620033 2017-04-24 20:53:34 UTC <gaughran444> I could not miss him more.pic.twitter.com/11teYHUAkQ
856567777032908803 2017-04-24 17:57:26 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Finally something we can all agree on. Un-fucking-believable.
856564598970961920 2017-04-24 17:44:49 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch Put the petal to the metal boys! #trumprussia
856527090052718594 2017-04-24 15:15:46 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @JoyAnnReid Perhaps he'd like to go himself.  I'd throw some of my tax dollars at that.
856509387032145920 2017-04-24 14:05:25 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Total bummer.
856480907582164993 2017-04-24 12:12:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Gotta admire a spunky 93 year old war criminal.
856479565153271808 2017-04-24 12:06:55 UTC <gaughran444> @USArmyReserve @VP In sharp contrast to your boss.
856344751381118976 2017-04-23 03:11:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DesignDreamer1 Good! That was tough!
856334704060112896 2017-04-23 02:31:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A former fed prosecutor will understand the procedural possibilities in a way that we who just have law degrees do not.
856332154900537344 2017-04-23 02:21:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Dangerous imbecile. #100daysofshame
856326422473969664 2017-04-23 01:58:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump This man needs psychiatric care and a new job. #100daysofshame
856323969158443008 2017-04-23 01:48:38 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 Someone told him it's not done. What a shit show.
856322127896739840 2017-04-23 01:41:19 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 Holy Christ.  And he doesn't even drink. Very scary.
856321801667981312 2017-04-23 01:40:01 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You need psychiatric care and a new job.
856319723415498752 2017-04-23 01:31:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @Lynda143143 Very kind but I don't know much about this.
856317714293510144 2017-04-23 01:23:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @iamsarabourne I have great faith in the justice department. Not the rotten guy in charge, but the rank and file. Dedicated and capable people.
856316102602878976 2017-04-23 01:17:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @iamsarabourne Quit or removed? I don't know.
856315070082625538 2017-04-23 01:13:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @imillerand1 I don't think so. Sessions is off and these are people who believe in the rule of law. Plus they could be subject to criminal sanctions.
856314713243832323 2017-04-23 01:11:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If he is smart and spent time there he probably saw and knows a lot.
856314440031109120 2017-04-23 01:10:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated 2. It's really beyond me.  Wish I knew more.
856314375057100800 2017-04-23 01:10:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated 1. I don't know. Grand juries I believe deliberate in secret but there are all kinds of rules re questions of intelligence, into threats.
856311192700301313 2017-04-23 00:57:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He was a federal prosecutor?
856311102304649217 2017-04-23 00:57:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I would trust your source. I believe FBI needs the DOJ to convene a grand jury to hear evidence and issue indictments. Can be many defs.
856310009248043008 2017-04-23 00:53:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The last time I awaited something this eagerly I was 9.5 months pregnant.
856309267355271168 2017-04-23 00:50:13 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Okay, now we're talking.
856309044813975554 2017-04-23 00:49:20 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 If I heard this rant in a subway I'd move to the next car.
856290712211554304 2017-04-23 23:36:29 UTC <gaughran444> @Slate He's like the defendant who kills his parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court as a poor orphan. So sick of this guy.
856271206764478468 2017-04-23 22:18:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Make that 603,001.
856232265923395586 2017-04-23 19:44:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I think so too. Unless someone finds his Grindr account.
856228680145797121 2017-04-23 19:29:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Better than some of the alternatives.  But until 2020? You think Pence is going down too? Ryan? Can they get a group rate in fed prison?
856226732554244102 2017-04-23 19:22:15 UTC <gaughran444> @ClintonCenter @deg2 @BillClinton Oh ffs. By whom?
856226231649533952 2017-04-23 19:20:16 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Wow. Back already. Like a fungus.
856176148878852096 2017-04-23 16:01:15 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You are at odds with core American and French values, and a disgrace to our country.
856175605670457345 2017-04-23 15:59:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Aka, nasty little cracker.
856175484127805440 2017-04-23 15:58:37 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Allons-y!
856139491974709251 2017-04-23 13:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Good point. Without his TASS, where would he be?
856139068190724096 2017-04-23 13:33:54 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost And if he could think, he just might.
856136407596879873 2017-04-23 13:23:20 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc Corned beef and cabbage is ghastly.
855983229752496128 2017-04-22 03:14:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Me too.
855945574704709633 2017-04-22 00:45:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I hope Perez is up to his job. Like him but this was a real miscalculation. Now his overt support of women's issues feels like an apology.
855937324840095749 2017-04-22 00:12:15 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro There's got to be someone who actually wants unity and respects the various views within the party. Not this guy.
855847159891152897 2017-04-22 18:13:58 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He's making himself the enemy by ashcanning the Democratic Party and its core constituents every time he opens his mouth.
855846788150026241 2017-04-22 18:12:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Our fearless leader tried to throw his considerable weight behind Le Pen too. Disgraceful.
855846450701488130 2017-04-22 18:11:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Ed Meese can't hold a candle to Sessions. John Mitchell was pretty impressive in his day. But this little cracker takes the cake.
855845952518856705 2017-04-22 18:09:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Yes Bone Spur Boy, check out some people who didn't dodge the draft!
855845401190162432 2017-04-22 18:06:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I tried to reserve judgment but lasted about six hours!
855844752406827012 2017-04-22 18:04:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro The more attention BS is given the more entitled and shrill he gets. He and his acolytes seem like spoiled children.
855784877446377472 2017-04-22 14:06:29 UTC <gaughran444> @MerriamWebster @BCDreyer Everyone uses begs the question wrong but I don't want to be a douche so say nothing.
855768116344836096 2017-04-22 12:59:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. Sometimes surgery is the only way to go.
855761939053649920 2017-04-22 12:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon That's comical. Are they real estate lawyers? Not too familiar with that constitutional business.
855761649868918786 2017-04-22 12:34:11 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I feel like we're back to pre-11/8, with MSM & Bernie dancing on her head. It's sickening. He's a self-obsessed schmuck & not a patriot.
855743631541579776 2017-04-22 11:22:35 UTC <gaughran444> @LEXPRESS @alfonslopeztena Scary. And our Fascist in Chief is trying to push Le Pen across the finish line.
855602188688789505 2017-04-21 02:00:32 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @jilltucker Beautiful story.
855591208386744324 2017-04-21 01:16:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TurnbullMalcolm @VP Translation: Trump hasn't hopelessly fucked this up. Yet.
855437778351476736 2017-04-21 15:07:14 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum Think it's a chick thing. This does not work for us. Just not.
855433402127876096 2017-04-21 14:49:50 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Hope he is. Top notch guy.
855380598671781889 2017-04-21 11:20:01 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn So there's his accomplishment for the first 100 days. Job well done.
855380565763256320 2017-04-21 11:19:53 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Whiny little bitch.
855379766089830401 2017-04-21 11:16:43 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Check what he's got hanging in his closet.
855378777823731715 2017-04-21 11:12:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Boo-fucking-hoo. Ever heard of Franklin Roosevelt? And he was disabled - one of those people you make fun of.
855376138188853248 2017-04-21 11:02:18 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro BS questioning Ossoff's bona fides as a real "progressive" was a bridge too far. DNC has to detach from this self-appointed messiah.
855375369842679809 2017-04-21 10:59:14 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Love this. Good for them.
855374791750164480 2017-04-21 10:56:57 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @cmclymer Probably true of readers in general.
855258622527504384 2017-04-20 03:15:20 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris @OccupyDemocrat1 @kylegriffin1 Meanwhile, Sessions is from Alabama.
855256526524747776 2017-04-20 03:07:00 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @peterdaou Excruciating.
855251422748835840 2017-04-20 02:46:43 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt No he has not. He may have heard of FDR but probably just thinks it's that road by the east river.
855245743111778305 2017-04-20 02:24:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So his explanation is he misses his home mattress?
855241447787909120 2017-04-20 02:07:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Aside from the grifting it's also embarrassing. Who tf is she? What is she qualified to discuss?
855210043104514048 2017-04-20 00:02:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Stay strong.
855160304052973568 2017-04-20 20:44:39 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @JaneGrader I'm sure they did. Probably more empathy as well.
855159619966164993 2017-04-20 20:41:56 UTC <gaughran444> @BBCWorld Spoken like Winston Churchill. A beacon to us all.
855158899539836928 2017-04-20 20:39:04 UTC <gaughran444> @politico More soaring oratory from our inspiring leader.
855156257233264640 2017-04-20 20:28:34 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @brianbeutler Very obvious way: BS could embrace the party & its candidates and stop acting like a self-appointed messiah.
855098519786590209 2017-04-20 16:39:08 UTC <gaughran444> @jasoninthehouse @decaro_nick @TrueFactsStated Someone had an affair with Jason Chaffetz?
855058006622556160 2017-04-20 13:58:09 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump You pathetic wretch try to focus on your job. Or have mercy on this country and resign before you're removed.

855050238587006976 2017-04-20 13:27:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDanZak Already did in Yemen.
855030482714677248 2017-04-20 12:08:47 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Please him and not Kennedy.
855030350480896000 2017-04-20 12:08:15 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Hopefully because there are a lot of targets of the investigation and they need to make a case that won't fall apart.
854895128011571200 2017-04-19 03:10:56 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @TrueFactsStated Also Maureen Dowd asked him about this and he dodged the question. Limiting his vile spawn on this earth probably best thing he ever did.
854892984105611264 2017-04-19 03:02:25 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 Does he think waterboarding is that golden showers business he likes a lot?
854892484329078784 2017-04-19 03:00:26 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @TrueFactsStated Haven't you just assumed this? Remember him talking about his "Vietnam" being single in NYC in the 70's?
854809741368975360 2017-04-19 21:31:38 UTC <gaughran444> @CyrusMMcQueen Yes and integrity.

854721181055946753 2017-04-19 15:39:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GOP @TheRickyDavila So pathetic. He was supposed to be one of the decent ones.
854719605708869633 2017-04-19 15:33:28 UTC <gaughran444> @jeffl76 @TrueFactsStated @katicavanaugh Steve Schmidt is the man.  If we had more Repubs like him would be a better country.
854714010050207745 2017-04-19 15:11:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. As desperate as we are for action we won't be happy if charges dismissed, case falls apart.

854523182711267330 2017-04-18 02:32:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And the unicorn he rode in on.
854520678682382337 2017-04-18 02:23:00 UTC <gaughran444> @aalali44 @AUkeibro I think you're smart so will give Tom a chance. But shouldn't he somehow explain himself? Simple folks like me perplexed
854520149289861123 2017-04-18 02:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @TracyLynnWilso2 Why?
854513211621683203 2017-04-18 01:53:20 UTC <gaughran444> @aalali44 @AUkeibro Next question, to Perez: So wtf dude?
854513205997162497 2017-04-18 01:53:19 UTC <gaughran444> @bjimd @TrueFactsStated Yes. It's not diagnostic but that "Rose Bud" video is really striking in terms of his verbal decline.

854509322109321218 2017-04-18 01:37:53 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos So why is Perez hauling him around the country?
854509095323357184 2017-04-18 01:36:58 UTC <gaughran444> @ALT_DOJ Ok. Fuck Steve King & Blue Bunny.

854501611250606080 2017-04-18 01:07:14 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost This is disgraceful.
854501422079119361 2017-04-18 01:06:29 UTC <gaughran444> @owillis @AUkeibro Haha. The bathtub scene in Fatal Attraction.
854500943655821312 2017-04-18 01:04:35 UTC <gaughran444> @bjimd @AUkeibro @TrueFactsStated Great. Soon he'll be wandering through the rose garden in a bathrobe like Vinny the Chin.
854495498065072128 2017-04-18 00:42:57 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MaryMarybrogdon Remember Vinny the Chin? He's back.
854493852857716736 2017-04-18 00:36:24 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You've already dismissed minority issues as identity politics.  We get it. You're not a democrat.
854486788785795072 2017-04-18 00:08:20 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @daveweigel @wpjenna Ditch the cursing and BS, ffs.
854486613631672320 2017-04-18 00:07:38 UTC <gaughran444> @KatrinaNation If he wins let's say yes.
854486217563439104 2017-04-18 00:06:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Congrats! Does this mean my 300+ are not such a big deal? Damn.
854485486534103040 2017-04-18 00:03:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TheRickWilson I feel so broad minded when I like Republicans.  I like this guy.
854472273012678656 2017-04-18 23:10:39 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris @BernieSanders @TomPerez @chrislhayes No thanks. Have some democrats on and I may tune in.
854423139496992768 2017-04-18 19:55:25 UTC <gaughran444> @cdelbrocco @CharlesMBlow @Salon Surprise!
854415567368925188 2017-04-18 19:25:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Is he a trump appointee? Trying to figure out whether or not to believe him.
854415355594383361 2017-04-18 19:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 This is impressive even for them.
854414296847142912 2017-04-18 19:20:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This feels like a much darker, more dangerous version of the fucked up Easter egg roll.
854368034466746370 2017-04-18 16:16:27 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation That would be a big mistake.
854299767706443776 2017-04-18 11:45:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Stunning news.
854275987172929536 2017-04-18 10:10:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're going to be removed soon.
854159335039148032 2017-04-17 02:27:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AP @KELLYWEILL Let me guess. The transformation culminates in BS as the candidate for 2020. Radical.
854136898352291840 2017-04-17 00:58:00 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes! He used to have suspects paraded through the stock exchange in handcuffs. Guys who were subsequently acquitted.
854130410648948736 2017-04-17 00:32:13 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Ghoulish monster. Very hard to believe he's going down too but how great would that be?
854103803519528960 2017-04-17 22:46:29 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt @dailykos He was clearly an entitled, hostile guy at his hearing. And is sitting comfortably in a stolen seat.
854090411098472448 2017-04-17 21:53:16 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Dare to dream.
854090104356450305 2017-04-17 21:52:03 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 They were horrible. Shouting down speakers.
854089910231461889 2017-04-17 21:51:17 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes. We are. BS is not.
854067811043430401 2017-04-17 20:23:28 UTC <gaughran444> @donnabrazile Didn't work.
854059774534668289 2017-04-17 19:51:32 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Maybe because he's a smarmy, self-righteous POS who smiles as he decimates the well-being of people in need. Could be that.
854028417842413568 2017-04-17 17:46:56 UTC <gaughran444> @leftyjennyc @MrDane1982 @thehill Yeah really not feeling this. Wtf.
854026248607211520 2017-04-17 17:38:19 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Horrendous news if so.
854025777763012609 2017-04-17 17:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Takeover???? What democrats are they talking to?
854019075718209538 2017-04-17 17:09:49 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT Try clethra.
854003614112784384 2017-04-17 16:08:22 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Trump's little cracker is Jeff Sessions.
854003409271365632 2017-04-17 16:07:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This poor young man. Of course he was crying.
853994391677149184 2017-04-17 15:31:44 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @baad_kittee Agree. I just like some old white guys a lot personally. But we need more women and POC in power. We just do.
853989387960545281 2017-04-17 15:11:51 UTC <gaughran444> @USCISMediaFLA @NavKaz @TampaHillsLib Welcome aboard!
853988989237424129 2017-04-17 15:10:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He should but he won't. Didn't mind taking a stolen seat.
853988648030744576 2017-04-17 15:08:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @baad_kittee I'm very fond of some old white men but not if they write off concerns of women & POC as identity politics. No go.
853986984737505289 2017-04-17 15:02:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Madame Defarge here. So ready. Click, click, click.
853960688477372417 2017-04-17 13:17:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Finally a book you can read. No words.
853960587616899072 2017-04-17 13:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You can resign via twitter. Any time bro.
853960231415668737 2017-04-17 13:15:59 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @JenGranholm Sounds like law school. Remember?
853959386125000704 2017-04-17 13:12:38 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Too many big sticks in this world. We need a woman for president.
853957766590996480 2017-04-17 13:06:11 UTC <gaughran444> @HelenKennedy Remind me of Pence's military service? I love how these Ken dolls like to dress up in the costumes, not big on enlisting.
853935445276864512 2017-04-17 11:37:30 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Stunning revelation.
853934873328967682 2017-04-17 11:35:13 UTC <gaughran444> @wordpressdotcom @LouiseMensch I imagine a spontaneous explosion of joy coast to coast at that moment.
853929858023530496 2017-04-17 11:15:18 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Wish we could see you campaigning at 9 years old. Good child!
853808442607362048 2017-04-16 03:12:50 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @counterchekist @TrueFactsStated @wbutlermd Looks that way. And I thought she was just thinking about Obama.
853776144818200580 2017-04-16 01:04:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Well, then. Are we done? Can he be hauled off before he starts a war?
853768286990946308 2017-04-16 00:33:16 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Oh yes. That's a done deal.
853767063441211394 2017-04-16 00:28:24 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I'll step in.
853760376395231233 2017-04-16 00:01:50 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews @critic_social So hard to take. We went from the best to the worst. I get choked up looking at footage of him with kids.
853754654341177348 2017-04-16 23:39:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JustADCohen @BrennanCenter Also willing to lie to congress. Quite a guy.
853727157465608192 2017-04-16 21:49:50 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews @critic_social Could not miss him more. Not possible.
853726566240706560 2017-04-16 21:47:29 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Because unlike him we pay them.
853715446314524674 2017-04-16 21:03:18 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Thank goodness for #jammiesandwine !!
853708583636172800 2017-04-16 20:36:02 UTC <gaughran444> @jazzymorgan1311 @IrisL49 When did he finally tepidly endorse her?
853705850636173312 2017-04-16 20:25:10 UTC <gaughran444> @jazzymorgan1311 @IrisL49 The man is tone deaf.
853703834295783425 2017-04-16 20:17:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MikeVanriel2 @AUkeibro Or they think it's a-ok. Safety in numbers.
853676011401170945 2017-04-16 18:26:36 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 We do all the time right Iris?
853646379738116097 2017-04-16 16:28:51 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamWeinstein @ANNELAMOTT I think his little cracker is Jeff Sessions.
853642782258475011 2017-04-16 16:14:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MaryMarybrogdon Can't wait!
853641797746257921 2017-04-16 16:10:39 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch Still hoping for a wide stance scandal to take him out.
853640816329465856 2017-04-16 16:06:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @MaryMarybrogdon Not to worry.
853585150537551873 2017-04-16 12:25:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Mikel_Jollett @JaneGrader Shocking.
853585004802297856 2017-04-16 12:24:58 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hope to see you hauled off in chains.
853339261638234112 2017-04-15 20:08:28 UTC <gaughran444> @deray Yes. Heaven forbid we use the R word.
853333575025950721 2017-04-15 19:45:53 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn @davidfrum @JaneGrader Not. One. Thing.
853333350622392320 2017-04-15 19:44:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Thank you.
853333096384561152 2017-04-15 19:43:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AdrianCJax Imagine the lovely silence.
853331812772401152 2017-04-15 19:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @riotwomennn Is there nothing these grifters won't lie about?
853329146080092160 2017-04-15 19:28:17 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos I would pay if it would make him stop talking.
853328834762092545 2017-04-15 19:27:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Dear God: hit him with a lightning bolt on the golf course today and every church in the country willl be packed tomorrow.
853269556038701057 2017-04-15 15:31:29 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood This little punk should keep quiet. He has the same distinguished military record as his father.
853028686156759040 2017-04-14 23:34:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @nedryun @hardball Total crap.
853025222706040837 2017-04-14 23:20:36 UTC <gaughran444> @shaunwalker7 @MaryDram @guardian Have we heard a peep about this from any of our "leaders" from either party?
853024914412118017 2017-04-14 23:19:22 UTC <gaughran444> @ProPublica Just swell.
853024735122292736 2017-04-14 23:18:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MiaFarrow @ANNELAMOTT I love him.
853023386355814400 2017-04-14 23:13:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Are you embarrassed by brave men? You should be.
853020190589820928 2017-04-14 23:00:36 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos @craigaroo I don't see much concern about country by the Rs. Plenty of concern about retaining power.
853019929410490372 2017-04-14 22:59:34 UTC <gaughran444> @IndivisibleTeam @CANDRA_51_61 Awful.
852889454826053637 2017-04-14 14:21:06 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos But don't you think if he strifes the White House with multiple arrests his reputation will be somewhat restored?
852888780260474880 2017-04-14 14:18:25 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @JoyAnnReid Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas.

852874429898076160 2017-04-14 13:21:24 UTC <gaughran444> @BettieRose100 @MrDane1982 Yes. Why are they hauling him around?
852868032464551936 2017-04-14 12:55:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AshleyRParker @MaryDram @washingtonpost Except the part where everyone's sad.
852865822376812544 2017-04-14 12:47:12 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @LouiseMensch I hope that thug is going down too.
852862532297662467 2017-04-14 12:34:07 UTC <gaughran444> @Smartypants60 @armandodkos Start by getting the toxic waste out of the White House.
852862284019924993 2017-04-14 12:33:08 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Poignant.
852849290426941444 2017-04-14 11:41:30 UTC <gaughran444> @DomenicoNPR @NPRinskeep I don't think that's a strategy. I think he's internally incoherent as well.
852848513918652416 2017-04-14 11:38:25 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Yet we had to listen to 8 years of bs about his inexperience.
852847284421263360 2017-04-14 11:33:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Soundtrack: Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
852734944426078209 2017-04-13 04:07:08 UTC <gaughran444> @ParkerMolloy @Kasinxia Really wish we had a woman president.
852718360311869440 2017-04-13 03:01:14 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid This feels like the Grucci grand finale on the 4th of July. Can the FBI just kick the doors in and take him out?
852708478259003393 2017-04-13 02:21:58 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill @BJHare I think tonight most Americans just want him out of the White House. He's insane.
852707716476874753 2017-04-13 02:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Fuck yes. All cake, all the time.
852707286774579200 2017-04-13 02:17:14 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I want this crazy bastard to play as much golf as possible. Stay the hell away from the job.
852706995761229824 2017-04-13 02:16:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Amy_Siskind They're useless when in session too. Worthless.

852599571775713280 2017-04-13 19:09:13 UTC <gaughran444> @Mike_P_Williams @MaryMarybrogdon By that logic how do they show Trump?
852582236419493888 2017-04-13 18:00:20 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood How about never? Does never work for you?
852582119356420097 2017-04-13 17:59:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yes, the dumb, bullying ones.

852563993881448450 2017-04-13 16:47:50 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch Be still my heart.
852563255327326208 2017-04-13 16:44:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He wants to be the guy who brings Trump down. Have at it, Eric!
852546904118489088 2017-04-13 15:39:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @USARedOrchestra Sessions is a nasty little cracker should not be anywhere near the justice department.  & he lied to congress.
852546441696473089 2017-04-13 15:38:05 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Will never get that far. Cha-ching!

852481860701696001 2017-04-13 11:21:28 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Primitive pos.
852355020825743360 2017-04-12 02:57:27 UTC <gaughran444> @JordanUhl Privilege? How about psychopathology?
852352130019188741 2017-04-12 02:45:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. And this is a slugger's row of greedy bastards.
852344563306049536 2017-04-12 02:15:54 UTC <gaughran444> @politico That was easy. Even got a nice piece of cake.
852335620009668609 2017-04-12 01:40:22 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes, en route to the bustling coal mines.
852335333387751425 2017-04-12 01:39:13 UTC <gaughran444> @spectatorindex @MaryDram Law school is not the obvious remedy for boredom.
852334746579468289 2017-04-12 01:36:53 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos More every day. It's painful.
852326510866386944 2017-04-12 01:04:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Law & order will be restored when the DOJ indicts you and your fellow collaborators. Can't wait.
852325202952323072 2017-04-12 00:58:58 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Okay got it. No connection there. What a relief.
852324684066676736 2017-04-12 00:56:54 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter You guys know where he's gonna come out.
852324297620193280 2017-04-12 00:55:22 UTC <gaughran444> @WesleyLowery @ElSKuhn @washingtonpost Good. For god's sake.
852321383975661569 2017-04-12 00:43:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump One by one your administration revealed as Russian collaborators. Big changes on the way!
852269607612293121 2017-04-12 21:18:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Maybe there's a place for him in the Trump White House.
852254837253210117 2017-04-12 20:19:21 UTC <gaughran444> @nypl @ammonshea @PeterSokolowski @MerriamWebster I love M-W & their website. Long live words and thought!
852251598000709633 2017-04-12 20:06:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated We're largely useless. Sorry. If I think of someone will let you know.
852250267290619904 2017-04-12 20:01:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes but civil rights not criminal. Do you know any former/present  asst us attys? They'll know.
852247452249989125 2017-04-12 19:50:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That sounds highly probable. Why else would they bother?
852228482222501888 2017-04-12 18:34:38 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian @NavKaz Except for the part where he can't read more than a few words at a time.
852228135953235968 2017-04-12 18:33:15 UTC <gaughran444> @marcushjohnson @MrDane1982 Amen. Just vote vote vote and drown them out.
852219631599329287 2017-04-12 17:59:28 UTC <gaughran444> @dailykos @docrocktex26 @aerynsunx A convoy of taco trucks, stretching from coast to coast.
852219069260595200 2017-04-12 17:57:14 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Oh bullshit.
852216748581556224 2017-04-12 17:48:00 UTC <gaughran444> @KimWeaverIA @AUkeibro @SteveKingIA Done. Go get him!
852216103824760833 2017-04-12 17:45:27 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Little Mayhem!
852213901920022530 2017-04-12 17:36:42 UTC <gaughran444> @dailykos @docrocktex26 I pray for the day when we don't have to see or hear from these dangerous Imbeciles.
852213735372595205 2017-04-12 17:36:02 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Dangerous imbecile.
852207465185890304 2017-04-12 17:11:07 UTC <gaughran444> @CillizzaCNN @CNNPolitics Yes because he keeps talking.
852207107805982721 2017-04-12 17:09:42 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Really impressively disgusting.  And the bar is very high these days.
852206646977810433 2017-04-12 17:07:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Poignant.
852186823493394432 2017-04-12 15:49:06 UTC <gaughran444> @pattonoswalt So awful. And they're both disgusting.
852186180800131077 2017-04-12 15:46:33 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That guy.
852186171497226240 2017-04-12 15:46:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Russia. FBI. Tick, tick, tick.
852181328091074561 2017-04-12 15:27:16 UTC <gaughran444> @KatyTurNBC Revolting. Both of them.
852181327583600640 2017-04-12 15:27:15 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Thank you!
852009301635772416 2017-04-11 04:03:41 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 This nasty little cracker has got to go. Supposedly he dropped the word filth when giving the speech. Doesn't matter. He's got to go.
852004845062160386 2017-04-11 03:45:59 UTC <gaughran444> @LeagueACS @eduardo_LACS @4ourgirlsnow No need to kill these wonderful animals. I agree - senseless.
852003601379622913 2017-04-11 03:41:02 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social Yes. A real win would have been awesome!
852001625417928704 2017-04-11 03:33:11 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper @RuPaul This poor baby.
852001281090703360 2017-04-11 03:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @critic_social But came very close and Repubs should be scared. Now on to Georgia . . .
851999876682534912 2017-04-11 03:26:14 UTC <gaughran444> @DanaHoule I wonder why.
851998290707177472 2017-04-11 03:19:56 UTC <gaughran444> @speechboy71 Both critical to getting our country back.

851983242655870976 2017-04-11 02:20:08 UTC <gaughran444> @GeeDee215 Best guess: Paul Ryan?
851982082175897600 2017-04-11 02:15:32 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @objkshn Yes. Lots of legal constructs not found in the constitution.
851981898410799104 2017-04-11 02:14:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This administration is in bed with Russia. Trump. Kushner. Sessions. Page. Tillerson. Flynn. Manafort. Russian nesting dolls.
851980922643771398 2017-04-11 02:10:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yes. I think his ass will be thrown out and people will go to jail. Then Pence/nightmare but he probably won't blow up the world
851980118604091394 2017-04-11 02:07:43 UTC <gaughran444> @EsotericCD @tripgabriel Republicans be afraid. Be very afraid.
851979150726504448 2017-04-11 02:03:53 UTC <gaughran444> @NRDC Tragic.
851979042354077697 2017-04-11 02:03:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Don't think it will happen unfortunately but I don't think saying it's not in the constitution ends the discussion.
851978821406523392 2017-04-11 02:02:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Okay so it's not in the constitution. But does that mean it's prohibited?
851971683435065344 2017-04-11 01:34:12 UTC <gaughran444> Maybe Fox can create a nice sitcom for Bill O'Reilly and Sean Spicer. Sort of a grabby, anti-Semitic odd couple?
851970193765142528 2017-04-11 01:28:17 UTC <gaughran444> @gaviota330 @1stSvelteCelt Such a sweetheart. Hope someone can save.

851969005216825344 2017-04-11 01:23:34 UTC <gaughran444> @SallyAlbright @AUkeibro @imillhiser Good for this judge. She hung on after circuit court told her to reconsider.
851967836062969856 2017-04-11 01:18:55 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahThyre Thank you! Always start looking for blunt objects when someone says that.
851966425300422656 2017-04-11 01:13:19 UTC <gaughran444> @20committee @JaneGrader Ha! I really don't know! Am being lazy and hoping someone will answer!
851963294093111297 2017-04-11 01:00:52 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamSerwer Better to skip filth language when speaking about human beings, even criminals. Esp when your admin is persecuting immigrants.
851962723541897217 2017-04-11 00:58:36 UTC <gaughran444> @20committee @JaneGrader If you interfere with a congressional investigation is that obstruction of justice or only for criminal investig?

851960998873501699 2017-04-11 00:51:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sometimes I think we've given this Union thing a real college try and it just hasn't worked out. Go our separate ways?
851959619798913024 2017-04-11 00:46:16 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro I have a holy-roller ex-bro in law in Memphis. Creature from hell.
851959397831946244 2017-04-11 00:45:23 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro And bringing the country down with them.
851959216273330176 2017-04-11 00:44:40 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon What happy days those were. We expected our wonderful candidate to win and their candidate was lame but human.
851956703285456896 2017-04-11 00:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @jbarro @danpfeiffer That is seriously insulting to Jews.
851956410917289986 2017-04-11 00:33:31 UTC <gaughran444> @huffpostqueer @Jake_Bernstein @JaneGrader Outrageous.
851956261478379521 2017-04-11 00:32:55 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro All to their detriment. If I were a better person would feel sorry for them. Hard to do right now.

851953982046179329 2017-04-11 00:23:52 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro Don't you think it's racism? Their last shred of imagined superiority?
851953752315768832 2017-04-11 00:22:57 UTC <gaughran444> @Jake_Bernstein @JaneGrader @huffpostqueer This is horrible. Any response from our govt?
851952836288159744 2017-04-11 00:19:19 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro Good for you. Seriously. I'll bet you make a real difference.
851951585139855360 2017-04-11 00:14:21 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro Just read about it. Damn! You okay down there?
851949659849453568 2017-04-11 00:06:42 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro No. For real?

851948692391297024 2017-04-11 00:02:51 UTC <gaughran444> @soledadobrien I hope this isn't true.
851948281907294208 2017-04-11 00:01:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NerdyWonka @AUkeibro Better not fund with tax $$$. 1st amendment problem.
851948040516751361 2017-04-11 00:00:15 UTC <gaughran444> @dlin71 @MrDane1982 Festive fellow!
851947948342734848 2017-04-11 23:59:53 UTC <gaughran444> @tommyxtopher Maybe he wants the hell out and is trying to get canned?

851938816160038917 2017-04-11 23:23:36 UTC <gaughran444> @justinhendrix Take the mics and podiums away. We've all been through enough.

851935276368879617 2017-04-11 23:09:32 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Yeah. How hard is that?
851934782149754880 2017-04-11 23:07:34 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hope he loses.

851913469347733506 2017-04-11 21:42:53 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump Daddy should hire him as defense counsel. Would go really well.
851912528733057024 2017-04-11 21:39:09 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Russia. FBI. Tick, tick, tick.
851912383635349505 2017-04-11 21:38:34 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Carry on young man. You got this.
851912220233658369 2017-04-11 21:37:55 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Partisan? Which party is cool with Hitler? Don't answer.
851909629416271873 2017-04-11 21:27:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ByronYork @JohnJHarwood @dcexaminer No they just wanted belligerence towards minorities.
851908841486901251 2017-04-11 21:24:30 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS Yes you and your administration will be taken down by law enforcement soon. Counting the days!
851908526356267008 2017-04-11 21:23:15 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @Kasinxia @TPM It's been a banner day for the Twitler regime.

851907234086912000 2017-04-11 21:18:06 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Unbearable.
851887746411102209 2017-04-11 20:00:40 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox It will probably include some muffled sobs and pleas to come back.
851887457012469761 2017-04-11 19:59:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why is that guy making pronouncements? Why are they being reported?

851762165468078080 2017-04-11 11:41:39 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Words to live by.
851564546326224897 2017-04-10 22:36:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump First justice to take a stolen seat! Making America Greater by the Day!

851539348633812992 2017-04-10 20:56:16 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP No his qualifications are standard issue. Where he stands out is that he's taking a stolen seat on the court. First time ever.
851538377522499585 2017-04-10 20:52:24 UTC <gaughran444> @wilw @BJHare Yeah and he's trying to fill up for profit prisons which will benefit his staff and friends. Contemptible cracker.

851504558316638209 2017-04-10 18:38:01 UTC <gaughran444> @TomthunkitsMind @AUkeibro So hard to choose which of these guys is the worst. On any given can be Ryan, Sessions, McConnell, Miller . . .
851503926973272065 2017-04-10 18:35:31 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Just not a stroke and coma. Please god not a coma. Don't need an elephantine Terry Schiavo.
851470812318236672 2017-04-10 16:23:55 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @MaxineWaters Who has this guy? They better watch him like a hawk. Lock the windows. Test the food.

850808820712566784 2017-04-08 20:33:24 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes A doctrine, good or bad, requires coherent thought. Not how Trump rolls.

850799613573464064 2017-04-08 19:56:49 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Because he doesn't really care about them. The missile attack was a political ploy, and it worked.

850033901934452736 2017-04-06 17:14:09 UTC <gaughran444> @EricLiptonNYT So soothing to have a competent, sane president when the going gets rough.
850033205633839104 2017-04-06 17:11:23 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Oh please, please, please. We need a laugh. Bring it on.
850033017636749317 2017-04-06 17:10:38 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid McCain is a fraud. Had his chance to regain his integrity and is all talk. No maverick there. Party hack.
850032671254335490 2017-04-06 17:09:16 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He'll alternately saber rattle and blame Obama, accomplishing nothing, or ask his boss Vlad to do something, also futile.
849994544011771905 2017-04-06 14:37:46 UTC <gaughran444> @DEADLINE @1stSvelteCelt I pray for the day when none of this degraded horseshit is associated with the presidency of the United States.
849993864148594688 2017-04-06 14:35:03 UTC <gaughran444> @joanmccarter Yes. Trump is dirt on Obama's shoulder. Or a weird orange hair. Brush it off.
849993642731347968 2017-04-06 14:34:11 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol This is very very good. Thank god for Article III.
849992883176452097 2017-04-06 14:31:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Why aren't they talking about the real, live babies who were murdered yesterday? Were those kids too brown to matter?
849991095635369984 2017-04-06 14:24:03 UTC <gaughran444> @statesman @OccupyDemocrat1 Jesus. This guy is an imbecile. Stands out even in this administration.

849957826315390977 2017-04-06 12:11:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Reuters @RWPUSA We don't have years. Our country is endangered and we need Trump and his co-conspirators out.

849939259918344193 2017-04-06 10:58:05 UTC <gaughran444> @Jillie1949 @AUkeibro @Salon Had to read Ayn Rand in college. Threw "The Fountainhead" in the garbage. Pure crap.
849937321331916800 2017-04-06 10:50:23 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro God I hope not. What a time to have an incompetent collaborator as president.
849803483226275840 2017-04-05 01:58:33 UTC <gaughran444> @SopanDeb Haha. No way he ever said that.

849784878916915200 2017-04-05 00:44:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheGayHumanist @rossadol Or jay-walking, or littering, or any damned thing. Clean as a whistle.

849726950902034432 2017-04-05 20:54:26 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation @NavKaz Right. And this little punk is silent about the Muslim bans. #profilesincourage
849716045208326150 2017-04-05 20:11:06 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras That's right. Give the man his due.

849645731652796416 2017-04-05 15:31:42 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 You make a good point.
849603548895641600 2017-04-05 12:44:05 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @WhiteHouse @VP Saw him blame Obama for Assad's murder of children. Very impressive.
849601863557271552 2017-04-05 12:37:23 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro But we can't. Too busy blaming Obama.

849592562352623616 2017-04-05 12:00:26 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yes. Although I think Garland and Russia/trump should be primary reasons to justify filibuster. Gorsuch is awful but qualified.
849589693993943040 2017-04-05 11:49:02 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 He also seems to have exaggerated or lied about pro bono work in law school. Yuck.

849455667022897152 2017-04-04 02:56:27 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Our country has been infiltrated by one of our chief adversaries. Don't divert with this bs. Where's your patriotism?

849435652534005762 2017-04-04 01:36:55 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Well, he is consistent about blaming Obama for everything under the sun.
849381372678606848 2017-04-04 22:01:14 UTC <gaughran444> @PeterAlexander Hasn't he been taught to blame Obama for everything? WH policy.
849381157418524674 2017-04-04 22:00:23 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost This is ominous. And doesn't sound quite legal.
849380768988241921 2017-04-04 21:58:50 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 All talk no action. Some maverick. Sick of him.

849358768085381121 2017-04-04 20:31:25 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Grotesque. I hope his sons have a hunting accident.
849339519166021634 2017-04-04 19:14:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is intolerable. All that bombast and not a peep about this.

849338168541405184 2017-04-04 19:09:33 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Oh ffs. Our country has been infiltrated by one of our chief adversaries. Are we really going to dick around with this?
849337903314501636 2017-04-04 19:08:30 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation Yes. Off his nut.

849336757992779778 2017-04-04 19:03:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I believe her. This is a bs effort to displace attention.
849304285787684864 2017-04-04 16:54:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Has there ever been such a pervasively vile administration in US history? Never thought I'd live to see anything like this.
849290328939134976 2017-04-04 15:59:28 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch Critical. But who will do that? The Republican quislings? They wave flags but don't give a damn about their country.
849289436231860224 2017-04-04 15:55:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. He's the real deal.
849289272234582017 2017-04-04 15:55:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram It's a monument to bigotry.
849258318879174656 2017-04-04 13:52:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro They don't give a hoot in hell about our country. Hope the indictments come soon. Get the lead out Comey!
849252205018394627 2017-04-04 13:27:58 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes and how how wonderful to learn that her brother is in on Russian business. It does feel like our country is under attack.
849249319471415298 2017-04-04 13:16:30 UTC <gaughran444> @dominicholden @BuzzFeedBen Great. Now pay those players for the mad funds they generate and all is well.
849247832330690561 2017-04-04 13:10:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated 325 - 340. And yes he does look like he's about to stroke out. Someone should turn off Fox News and see if it happens.

849003568392806400 2017-04-03 20:59:59 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Had same thought!!
848999321634840578 2017-04-03 20:43:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @JuddApatow Shameless bullshit.

848962331392569344 2017-04-03 18:16:07 UTC <gaughran444> @WashTimes @CLewandowski_ Have you hit any women today?
848961414224125952 2017-04-03 18:12:28 UTC <gaughran444> Block Gorsuch with Garland and Russia/Trump. Otherwise we look like obstructionists bc he is qualified. Look at illegitimacy of process.
848960507239444480 2017-04-03 18:08:52 UTC <gaughran444> Dems should explicitly link no vote on Gorsuch to no vote on Garland. Question of basic democratic process. His conservatism not enough.
848945109278367745 2017-04-03 17:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox How many months at trump tower could that honker pay for? Save tax $$$

848876699131543552 2017-04-03 12:35:51 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel Is he tweeting from the psychiatric care wing of the WH?

848701940196409345 2017-04-02 01:01:25 UTC <gaughran444> @keithboykin @AUkeibro Same reason he swore to make Obama a one term president. Racist cracker.

848661318546718720 2017-04-02 22:20:00 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Worst consolation prize ever.

848647106755792897 2017-04-02 21:23:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Absolutely not.
848646920721620994 2017-04-02 21:22:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Doesn't it have a nice front porch with a rocking chair with his name on it?
848646673513549825 2017-04-02 21:21:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Can you imagine what FDR would have made of Trump? Or Truman? Kennedy? Lincoln? The heart breaks.
848645643312783362 2017-04-02 21:17:43 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory @sunnysingh_n6 Actually we're pretty sure.
848636171391578112 2017-04-02 20:40:04 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch I've made it this far without learning what a cuck is. Can I just skip it?
848635975362392065 2017-04-02 20:39:18 UTC <gaughran444> @SallyAlbright @AUkeibro He sure did. Disgraceful.

848634501152591874 2017-04-02 20:33:26 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris Thank you. Don't want to spend a nickel of tax $ on that bigoted bs.

848510514565173250 2017-04-02 12:20:45 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryAliceCam Just looked at your profile. Certainly true of you!
848389667225567233 2017-04-01 04:20:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated She really does. It gives her a slightly bad-ass look that reflects her personality better than the pantsuits.
848372530490613760 2017-04-01 03:12:27 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @AUkeibro They were gung-ho to kill Obamacare before they realized it would hurt them. They're fueled by rage and ignorance.
848366775515394048 2017-04-01 02:49:35 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @AUkeibro Abject fools. I know we're supposed to sympathize but I'm not feeling it.
848360838268407808 2017-04-01 02:26:00 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @AUkeibro They're shocked he would do anything that would hurt white people.
848358572702543872 2017-04-01 02:17:00 UTC <gaughran444> @mcuban @DavidLeopold @LouiseMensch @jsheehy Will have to see if they carefully cordoned him off. They don't seem like a careful bunch.

848349671970013184 2017-04-01 01:41:38 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Is this tone deaf egomaniac gearing up for 2020? Give it a rest, dude.
848347417292537857 2017-04-01 01:32:40 UTC <gaughran444> @nypost @CLewandowski_ You still hit women now that your an economist?
848347299432542208 2017-04-01 01:32:12 UTC <gaughran444> @nypost @CLewandowski_ Hahaha. Thanks professor.
848301871366275072 2017-04-01 22:31:41 UTC <gaughran444> @JCLayfield @realDonaldTrump Except the part where you put Russia first. 
848233673698799616 2017-04-01 18:00:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Hope it opens up beneath them.
848233350024372225 2017-04-01 17:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Well there was the tan suit. That was serious stuff.
848231809968111617 2017-04-01 17:53:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. And maybe the silver lining will be an electorate that will finally understand how important it is to vote. I hope.
848229867183276032 2017-04-01 17:45:34 UTC <gaughran444> @MCJalonick Go Claire!!
848229610181586944 2017-04-01 17:44:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's horrific. Killing protection for working people, for the planet. Hard to watch.
848229315682721792 2017-04-01 17:43:22 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders So you say today. Yesterday Trump's racism was immaterial.
848228796322983936 2017-04-01 17:41:19 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You should retain a good criminal lawyer who will immediately advise you to shut tf up.
848227055238094848 2017-04-01 17:34:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TimFederle Never have. Never will.
848189440740782084 2017-04-01 15:04:55 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think they're such craven bastards that they don't want to do anything that will threaten their power. Hopefully will backfire.
848175432541372416 2017-04-01 14:09:16 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's awful.
848169933133545473 2017-04-01 13:47:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro He has savaged our country's dignity. I think it will take years to rebuild when he's gone.

848156449322782720 2017-04-01 12:53:50 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Don't worry about NBC, boyfriend. Worry about the FBI.
848148456623550464 2017-04-01 12:22:04 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump She had called for you to step down.

848018370289172480 2017-03-31 03:45:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He's trying to reach out to white voters for next time. Can't stand this guy.
848015540094423040 2017-03-31 03:33:54 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated If he keeps tweeting after he resigns will be like a voice echoing from the grave. Weird as hell.
848012494148960256 2017-03-31 03:21:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated A phone and a tuft of weird hair.
847924037770780672 2017-03-31 21:30:18 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Spoiled punk.
847920296908795904 2017-03-31 21:15:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Maybe he can have all the women who've accused him of sexual assault to the Oval Office, like an nba team.
847919724566638593 2017-03-31 21:13:10 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Any chance he flips?
847908003709943809 2017-03-31 20:26:36 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Quisling.
847907536045035524 2017-03-31 20:24:44 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh Also methinks he doth protest too much.

847784553481633793 2017-03-31 12:16:03 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Wise to shift your gaze to outer space. Your party is unraveling.

847774396668424194 2017-03-31 11:35:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Can you even keep your phone in prison or do you have to use one on the wall? How to tweet?
847773527122096132 2017-03-31 11:32:14 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated It's like those Russian nesting dolls, and all the dolls suck.

847620767898521600 2017-03-30 01:25:13 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS Flynn wants immunity in exchange for testimony to congressional committees and the FBI.
847554315984220160 2017-03-30 21:01:10 UTC <gaughran444> @AlasscanIsBack @MrDane1982 That's the vibe for sure. No light behind his eyes.

847516232500875267 2017-03-30 18:29:50 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS Merrick Garland.
847495483014565889 2017-03-30 17:07:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He's a homophobic lowlife hiding behind religion.
847486085114597376 2017-03-30 16:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @angela_rye @WalshFreedom @BagheerahAsaad So repulsive. Starts with our supposed president.
847465614969065472 2017-03-30 15:08:42 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid With the sound off the moderator looks like she's going to vomit.
847465356276977664 2017-03-30 15:07:40 UTC <gaughran444> @nypost @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Do they have Twitter in prison?

847465087325450241 2017-03-30 15:06:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Bonespur Boy cares deeply about Vietnam Vets. Not enough to join them at the time. But deeply.

847175308994383872 2017-03-29 19:55:08 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT I think he should be more wary about being alone with men.
847147152908468225 2017-03-29 18:03:15 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Nixon always had the super strange body language. Like a caricature of a white man. Feeling nostalgic.
847115139300167683 2017-03-29 15:56:02 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw Is this obstruction of justice or does it need to be in context of a criminal investigation?

846757397645418496 2017-03-28 16:14:30 UTC <gaughran444> @DevinNunes @politico This is feeling very Watergate-ish. Except much more serious.
846753667927691264 2017-03-28 15:59:41 UTC <gaughran444> @repdonyoung @NatResources @SpeakerRyan Power grabs. One of the few things you understand. Go have an unsuccessful encounter with wildlife.
846749754201706496 2017-03-28 15:44:07 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Is this today? Did this guy just come out of a coma?
846748871074238464 2017-03-28 15:40:37 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Unfortunately racism is Fox's bread and butter. They won't bat an eyelash.
846748319879712771 2017-03-28 15:38:25 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum A corrupt conga line.
846748213063376896 2017-03-28 15:38:00 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid O'Reilly is a primitive thug. Nothing will stop Maxine Waters.

846713302537269248 2017-03-28 13:19:17 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @marcorubio Your party stole this seat as you well know. Dems shouldn't let Trump nominate justice in last year of his presidency.
846699104713494528 2017-03-28 12:22:52 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I can't.

846698461072412672 2017-03-28 12:20:18 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You need psychiatric care and a new job.
846557590913986560 2017-03-27 03:00:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So Dr Reiss is too dignified to say batshit crazy.
846557304665362433 2017-03-27 02:59:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Russia.

846386525952724992 2017-03-27 15:40:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics How about a little chat with the FBI?
846385871268012032 2017-03-27 15:38:11 UTC <gaughran444> @j_fuller @jbouie @MTV That's right. Wilding minorities and women in power suits! Save us!!!!
846177723764617216 2017-03-26 01:51:05 UTC <gaughran444> @Kasinxia Maybe because our dangerous, incompetent president got elected on a tide of racism?
846177143419785216 2017-03-26 01:48:46 UTC <gaughran444> @seanhannity No you're a geyser of angry misinformation. He meant you. You.
846166955652472833 2017-03-26 01:08:17 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow Go O! Huge issue!
846163773287288833 2017-03-26 00:55:39 UTC <gaughran444> @Brasilmagic @AUkeibro @LifeSite Tell it Nancy!
846163433414430725 2017-03-26 00:54:18 UTC <gaughran444> @theglobalist @Salon Yes they should. The seat was stolen and he's appalling.
846162824808333312 2017-03-26 00:51:53 UTC <gaughran444> @ValerieJarrett @Austan_Goolsbee @TinaTchen @EvanMRyan @AlyssaMastro44 Would love to read a transcript of what was said about the DT WH.
846161958290296833 2017-03-26 00:48:26 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce You need to work through your ambivalence.
846155840918827008 2017-03-26 00:24:07 UTC <gaughran444> @bentzminger @JoyAnnReid @TPM So do so many.
846155014137630720 2017-03-26 00:20:50 UTC <gaughran444> @AlexKokcharov @SheWhoVotes Brave people. There was a time when the US govt would have supported them.
846153535356129281 2017-03-26 00:14:58 UTC <gaughran444> @thenation Don't need to sugar coat it. It's called racism.
846152271826227201 2017-03-26 00:09:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostBlog @TrueFactsStated @ninaandtito Jesus.  Thanks.
846139352191250432 2017-03-26 23:18:36 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA The FBI is working much faster.
846138367968497664 2017-03-26 23:14:42 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Disgraceful.
846134988097667072 2017-03-26 23:01:16 UTC <gaughran444> @RogueSNRadvisor What a tacky pos.
846134367231598593 2017-03-26 22:58:48 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @RichLowry @jwpetersNYT It was so much easier when they could just line up against the black guy.
846133997008769025 2017-03-26 22:57:19 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Khanoisseur Who among us would sleep with DT to benefit hungry seniors? Brutal task, but she married him.
846133513179074560 2017-03-26 22:55:24 UTC <gaughran444> @tpolitical_news @OccupyDemocrat1 No question about it.
846123239726370820 2017-03-26 22:14:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Thanks!
846100841765457920 2017-03-26 20:45:35 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro You need to be blindingly self-absorbed to cling to your notions of purity and perfection when our country is on fire.
846071171699347456 2017-03-26 18:47:41 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hell yes. Helped him get elected. And they're not embarrassed.
846059170768019456 2017-03-26 17:59:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated They gotta learn the walk and talk.
846059063821701120 2017-03-26 17:59:34 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated That guy looks like all rage, all the time. Bring it on!
846058917637619716 2017-03-26 17:58:59 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Chilling the champagne.
846058277574193154 2017-03-26 17:56:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Haha. Maybe Bernie gets the Most Annoying Seniors category.
846057852817080320 2017-03-26 17:54:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @ninaandtito Yes. And the Ashcroft hospital bed thing. He needs to redeem himself after the Hillary email disaster.
846057216411127808 2017-03-26 17:52:14 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. Strong contender for most annoying man in America.
846009009559801857 2017-03-26 14:40:40 UTC <gaughran444> @MortonsEast Brave soul.
846008891645276160 2017-03-26 14:40:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Exactly. He was Mr Integrity for years. He wants that title back.
846008635255762944 2017-03-26 14:39:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics He should know.
845993869208637440 2017-03-26 13:40:30 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 What's he sitting on? Looks sharp.
845989140143452160 2017-03-26 13:21:43 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I don't think they'll ever shut up till he does. And he's everywhere now. So annoying.
845839381202173953 2017-03-25 03:26:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I hope our planet can survive this administration.
845824115068022785 2017-03-25 02:25:58 UTC <gaughran444> @joshgreenman @anamariecox I watched. Holy cow! Apoplectic. Do people still use the term female impersonator or not so much anymore?
845822446477459461 2017-03-25 02:19:20 UTC <gaughran444> @antonejohnson @TrueFactsStated Mind-boggling for anyone who grew up during the Cold War.
845806076234776576 2017-03-25 01:14:17 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou That camera hog must be edged aside.
845805405729116160 2017-03-25 01:11:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated So they won't even visit him in prison? Sad!
845801493877927940 2017-03-25 00:56:05 UTC <gaughran444> @foreignpolicy77 @funder Wouldn't the FBI have told them to preserve evidence during an investigation?
845795313998856194 2017-03-25 00:31:31 UTC <gaughran444> @kylegriffin1 @GlazerRandee @mitchellreports Is that destruction of evidence?
845785607100141568 2017-03-25 23:52:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram The important thing is that she always looks like she's having fun.
845785241621016577 2017-03-25 23:51:30 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump They say Flynn has a deal. Uh-oh.
845741265207644162 2017-03-25 20:56:45 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT Flynn.
845741047116447749 2017-03-25 20:55:53 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes They should. And they should get paid too. NCAA is a sea of money that they generate.
845735875740930050 2017-03-25 20:35:20 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Long time ago, bipartisan legislation for immigration reform, campaign finance reform. No more. All anger, all the time.
845731925977370625 2017-03-25 20:19:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro All rage, all the time. With frequent breaks for racism and misogyny. More dough for the rich. Not a real idea between them.
845730604490670081 2017-03-25 20:14:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The party of no. So much anger, so few ideas.
845730400530042880 2017-03-25 20:13:35 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Bottoms up!
845730077593751552 2017-03-25 20:12:18 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @SethAbramson Let us pray.
845729838916915200 2017-03-25 20:11:21 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hilarious. Why tf should democrats have voted for TrumpCare?
845729387840487426 2017-03-25 20:09:33 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Lots of competition but I think he wins too.
845728848687874048 2017-03-25 20:07:25 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffingtonPost Jail.
845688794699452416 2017-03-25 17:28:15 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala An Ayn Rand ideologue who grossly overestimates his own intellect.
845688578046902272 2017-03-25 17:27:23 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders No thanks to you. Stop attacking the democrats.
845655339685040128 2017-03-25 15:15:19 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I think he needs someone to remind him where he is and what the hell everyone's talking about. So many syllables, so fast.
845387200686624768 2017-03-24 21:29:49 UTC <gaughran444> @davidwbrown @20committee @LouiseMensch Why is Comey at the White House?
845380106201845762 2017-03-24 21:01:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Damn! Hope show goes well!
845374369954238465 2017-03-24 20:38:50 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Neither will he.
845373700086120448 2017-03-24 20:36:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Please find out why! Flipping out here!
845350728222883841 2017-03-24 19:04:54 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Reagan did not collaborate with Russia. Remember?

845319168178225152 2017-03-24 16:59:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders Stop trashing the Democratic Party. This is not about you.
845318140246573058 2017-03-24 16:55:24 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR So fun to imagine.
845307835550519296 2017-03-24 16:14:27 UTC <gaughran444> Democrats unable to fight back, says the guy who just found out about Trump/Russia. Bernie's in it for Bernie. Yet again.
845101447968641024 2017-03-23 02:34:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Master negotiator.
845094210088898560 2017-03-23 02:05:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Can they just let her go so we don't have to see or hear about her again?
845093597791834112 2017-03-23 02:03:09 UTC <gaughran444> @SpeakerRyan @JoyAnnReid The Republican Party is collapsing. Honest mistake.
845093221650849793 2017-03-23 02:01:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Madame Defarge here. Knitting away. Waiting. As long as it takes.
844987115180052481 2017-03-23 19:00:02 UTC <gaughran444> @JoeBiden Go Joe!!! We need you!
844985233778847744 2017-03-23 18:52:33 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @VP That is one scary lineup of dangerous white men
844968140220043264 2017-03-23 17:44:38 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich Don't forget the Know Nothings.
844941232895864832 2017-03-23 15:57:42 UTC <gaughran444> @kmjoseph705 I'm so sorry. Heartbreaking. I had a beloved dog 16 yrs and could only recover the loss by getting another dog. Any chance?
844925432478777346 2017-03-23 14:54:55 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Do it!
844880047408263168 2017-03-23 11:54:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TIME @rtraister I will weep with joy when they haul him off.
844877544264491009 2017-03-23 11:44:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MattMurph24 @AUkeibro I so hope so.
844877252143800320 2017-03-23 11:43:28 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC If he spills do the Russians kill him too?
844876834126925824 2017-03-23 11:41:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood He may indeed. Not for the reasons he wants, but he should have many more covers.
844876388318531584 2017-03-23 11:40:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics @IrisL49 The nerve of this little punk. Only did this because the mayor is a Muslim.
844875243000922113 2017-03-23 11:35:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Does he get to bring his cool hat collection?
844874703013642240 2017-03-23 11:33:20 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood @kmjoseph705 cute dog!
844793822324281344 2017-03-22 06:11:57 UTC <gaughran444> @McFaul @NavKaz Because he's afraid of law enforcement. Like all crooks.
844741100279615493 2017-03-22 02:42:27 UTC <gaughran444> @VABVOX @LeftOfMainSt Good question.
844721449109798912 2017-03-22 01:24:22 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Does Ivanka get a cell on the same block, just to be helpful to dear old dad?
844720879854653440 2017-03-22 01:22:06 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @jbouie Had a black guy gone to Boston to kill white men, perhaps there would have been a little more coverage.
844720542020222976 2017-03-22 01:20:46 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 No. He's just not feeling it. The country is on fire and he's still banging the same drum.

844713376999788546 2017-03-22 00:52:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman Pathetic.
844693845510160385 2017-03-22 23:34:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I'm kidding. I liked him until he hammered the hell out of Hillary.
844693347855945729 2017-03-22 23:32:42 UTC <gaughran444> @burgessev @politico Don't do it. Suspend hearings.
844692440229580808 2017-03-22 23:29:06 UTC <gaughran444> @dailykos @BJHare No.
844690427076886528 2017-03-22 23:21:06 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Must feel good to have gotten that off your chest.
844689851895173122 2017-03-22 23:18:48 UTC <gaughran444> @paleblueeyes24 Tears in my eyes. Our country has been so degraded. We must remove trump, restore the rule of law, and reassert decency.
844646150330290177 2017-03-22 20:25:09 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @nytpolitics That's reassuring.

844638288967274497 2017-03-22 19:53:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Okay this guy needs to go. He is trying to thwart investigation.
844638093244350465 2017-03-22 19:53:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Sure looks that way!

844637582642294784 2017-03-22 19:51:06 UTC <gaughran444> @CLewandowski_ Nice of Nunes to tip off Putin's puppet.
844637445840949248 2017-03-22 19:50:34 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Yes. So why isn't anyone insisting that he be removed from the committee?
844636889588092929 2017-03-22 19:48:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Susan_Hennessey @resnikoff How does he stay on the committee now?

844611081033207808 2017-03-22 18:05:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This makes watergate look like a late library book. Unprecedented in US history.
844610833925750784 2017-03-22 18:04:49 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood How is this okay? Is he not giving trump a heads up on an investigation of which trump is a subject?? Don't get this.
844610008847405056 2017-03-22 18:01:32 UTC <gaughran444> @RepublicanJD Check out how Gorsuch tried to treat students with disabilities. Super nice. Just slapped down by unanimous Supreme Court.
844606825538486274 2017-03-22 17:48:53 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR Enormous win for students with disabilities.  Rejection of debased standard advanced by Gorsuch. One for the good guys.
844606500165369860 2017-03-22 17:47:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Anthony @FranTownsend How is he talking openly about this stuff while on committee?
844606104306958339 2017-03-22 17:46:01 UTC <gaughran444> @RVAwonk @BJHare Loving Al more every day.
844605714735808522 2017-03-22 17:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @20committee Can you imagine if Schiff did this?
844605275285995525 2017-03-22 17:42:44 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Hope he gets swept in too.
844604859567554561 2017-03-22 17:41:05 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Oh ffs. He tried to savage law protecting disabled students. Got slapped down. That's what he's sorry about.
844603725985583108 2017-03-22 17:36:34 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Is he? Enough to unload him too?

844585270842277888 2017-03-22 16:23:14 UTC <gaughran444> @observer @LouiseMensch You sound deeply concerned.
844584954889687041 2017-03-22 16:21:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Patronizing bs artist.
844584881682305030 2017-03-22 16:21:42 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Leadership at its best.
844584533970300928 2017-03-22 16:20:19 UTC <gaughran444> @joshorton @MrDane1982 That's right. He's affronted that he's being asked questions.  At a hearing. Fuck him.
844583097148620802 2017-03-22 16:14:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @mattwhouse I'd say outrageous. Suspend these hearings.
844582983050936320 2017-03-22 16:14:09 UTC <gaughran444> @dailykos @TrueFactsStated Was he created in the Worst Person Ever lab? It never stops.
844582800024064000 2017-03-22 16:13:25 UTC <gaughran444> @imillhiser @Kasinxia @thinkprogress He's dishonest and arrogant. He's going to be a destructive justice.
844582495215587329 2017-03-22 16:12:13 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Not like the current lunatic they don't.
844563973156585472 2017-03-22 14:58:37 UTC <gaughran444> @AidenWolfe @BJHare Agree. Mad smart, nervy and principled.
844562416046354432 2017-03-22 14:52:25 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Do he and Bannon have the same drug dealer? The eyes on these guys . . .
844529025506775041 2017-03-22 12:39:44 UTC <gaughran444> @SenGillibrand @Lily_v_Shtupp Thank you Senator.
844528376685694976 2017-03-22 12:37:10 UTC <gaughran444> @CBSThisMorning @LindseyGrahamSC Suspend these hearings pending Russia/trump investigation.
844527190347780097 2017-03-22 12:32:27 UTC <gaughran444> @JCrongeyer @Lily_v_Shtupp No they won't. Quisling bastards.
844397824477409281 2017-03-21 03:58:24 UTC <gaughran444> @SenKamalaHarris Good for you!
844396699200208896 2017-03-21 03:53:55 UTC <gaughran444> @1stSvelteCelt Neil Gorsuch appeared outraged that anyone would dare question Neil Gorsuch. That's one arrogant guy.
844396435445571587 2017-03-21 03:52:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @neeratanden Not a chance. Look what they did to Obama.
844396077407240193 2017-03-21 03:51:27 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @1stSvelteCelt She looks like she's enduring death by Spanx.
844393856955273216 2017-03-21 03:42:38 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @RepAdamSchiff Go Adam Schiff!
844306580015403010 2017-03-21 21:55:49 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Crushed this phony. Go Al!
844303726785515521 2017-03-21 21:44:29 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @PaulBegala Franken kicked this entitled phony's ass. Thanks Al.
844302611998224386 2017-03-21 21:40:03 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics Until he gets a right to die case.
844302516787576833 2017-03-21 21:39:41 UTC <gaughran444> @nprpolitics Terry Schiavo.
844302047470141442 2017-03-21 21:37:49 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes. Poor Mother.
844300420600283136 2017-03-21 21:31:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @SureReality Yes but he's very punitive towards gay people. It's repellant and peculiar.
844299824283504640 2017-03-21 21:28:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AriMelber Yes found him arrogant, entitled and evasive. Vote should be postponed till conclusion of Trump/Russia investigation.
844298682862387200 2017-03-21 21:24:26 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes!!!! That's the clincher!!
844298341685088256 2017-03-21 21:23:05 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yeah get that vibe. He's so censorious. What's up with that?
844295600996798466 2017-03-21 21:12:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Still praying for a wide stance incident to remove Pence. Dare to dream.
844295258741653504 2017-03-21 21:10:50 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFranken @EJDionne Love Al!!
844294626425081857 2017-03-21 21:08:19 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS Suspend vote till Trump/Russia investigation is complete! This presidency may prove to be wholly invalid. Tick, tick, tick.
844290810673795072 2017-03-21 20:53:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SteveKornacki @AriMelber Oh please.
844290665311821825 2017-03-21 20:52:35 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA He should save his dough for a top notch criminal defense lawyer.
844289392646803457 2017-03-21 20:47:32 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Strucken?
844289020121284609 2017-03-21 20:46:03 UTC <gaughran444> @politico At some point he'll be hit with some projectile vomit, right?
844288718181748742 2017-03-21 20:44:51 UTC <gaughran444> @nikroybal @IrisL49 Maybe he thinks he's Obama in a football uniform.
844288089161977858 2017-03-21 20:42:21 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes It went away when white people realized it covered them, too.
844287581013655552 2017-03-21 20:40:20 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT He's comfortable enough to be there. Could have declined. Wants the job.
844287404311822336 2017-03-21 20:39:37 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Hopefully that is beyond repair at this point.
844286258016866304 2017-03-21 20:35:04 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU How awful.
844252357164744704 2017-03-21 18:20:22 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Getting a very spoiled, arrogant vibe from this guy. Merrick Garland is gracious.
844251428571004928 2017-03-21 18:16:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Some federal prisons let the inmates play golf.
844249558255357953 2017-03-21 18:09:14 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost This crazy bastard should not get a dog. Maybe a pet rock.
844248407233482759 2017-03-21 18:04:40 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics But taking a seat that should have gone to an Obama nominee is a-ok.
844247856395567104 2017-03-21 18:02:28 UTC <gaughran444> @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump You go comrade!
844247674245337090 2017-03-21 18:01:45 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNMoney @docrocktex26 Haha. Glad that's settled.
844247427397943296 2017-03-21 18:00:46 UTC <gaughran444> @NASA @realDonaldTrump They'd better look around for a new planet as you've declared open season on this one.
844247096735809537 2017-03-21 17:59:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce I think he gets scale.
844246678450388992 2017-03-21 17:57:48 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated At least JFK was super cute.
844172539194753024 2017-03-21 13:03:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @jamesgn6 @kitten250 I know. Crazy bastard.
844166233041915906 2017-03-21 12:38:08 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Chilling the champagne.
844165986022559744 2017-03-21 12:37:09 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Thanks Obama!
844165314816479232 2017-03-21 12:34:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated He's going to have to turn something or someone big over to the govt to get that.
844164879523168256 2017-03-21 12:32:45 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Where's a good tidal wave when you need one?
844016788321001473 2017-03-20 02:44:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JRubinBlogger @tribelaw @NewsHour If?
844016423324340224 2017-03-20 02:42:51 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol This guy is a heat seeking missile. Go Eric!
844010195672096768 2017-03-20 02:18:06 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT And not a peep in that addled brain about what's good for his country.
844005086607097856 2017-03-20 01:57:48 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Like spores.
844005010228854785 2017-03-20 01:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC @Lily_v_Shtupp No his voters loved that.
843995850149957636 2017-03-20 01:21:06 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders @aussiehowie Fun right? In a few days you'll be swearing like a sailor.
843995611808579584 2017-03-20 01:20:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Five hours.
843995175391281153 2017-03-20 01:18:25 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I wish to hell someone asked him today why he blabbed about wiener laptop when he knew trump was being investigated.
843994593435762689 2017-03-20 01:16:06 UTC <gaughran444> @RepAdamSchiff @GlazerRandee @POTUS Thank you Congressman Schiff. You hit it out of the park today.
843984547788341253 2017-03-20 00:36:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander That's right. Like John Gotti and his son, etc.
843983927727587329 2017-03-20 00:33:43 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Wait is this the scary looking one having a baby?
843983629705515008 2017-03-20 00:32:32 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Your evidence that he has one?
843983451040768001 2017-03-20 00:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @funder Waiting.
843983257616179204 2017-03-20 00:31:03 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC It feels like a century.
843982669058887681 2017-03-20 00:28:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Low class grifters.
843982485562310656 2017-03-20 00:27:59 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Why did no one at the hearing ask him why he did this?
843982345434775553 2017-03-20 00:27:26 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Jesus man! The country is on fire! Can you bang a different drum?
843981397983477766 2017-03-20 00:23:40 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Probably thinks he's an NCAA player.
843928805110636546 2017-03-20 20:54:41 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @newtgingrich @LouDobbs Hahaha! You old white guys lie even more when you're scared!
843928329803776004 2017-03-20 20:52:47 UTC <gaughran444> @NumbersMuncher Today will be a real numbers booster.
843928195053342720 2017-03-20 20:52:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MarkSalter55 No.
843924232803438593 2017-03-20 20:36:31 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's really something. Never agreed with them, but there were many more decent ones. The bottom somehow dropped out.
843921701020844032 2017-03-20 20:26:27 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think some of these guys (Gowdy) are so depraved they have no idea how they appear. It's hard to fathom.
843919792172138496 2017-03-20 20:18:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Wow. That's telling.
843919062602317825 2017-03-20 20:15:58 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Are you serious?
843918505410027521 2017-03-20 20:13:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Those republicans in the hearing today don't give a hoot in hell about their country. It's all party, all the time.
843899584501944320 2017-03-20 18:58:34 UTC <gaughran444> @joncoopertweets @sunnysingh_n6 @RogerJStoneJr Can he take those cool hats he likes to prison?
843898099290558466 2017-03-20 18:52:40 UTC <gaughran444> @kurteichenwald So pathetic.  They were swinging at Obama too. Limited repertoire.
843891317465858050 2017-03-20 18:25:43 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill @deg2 Just the aides?
843879931885031424 2017-03-20 17:40:28 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS No they did not. Get psychiatric care and a new job.
843868975297630212 2017-03-20 16:56:56 UTC <gaughran444> @mattyglesias @JaneGrader Sounds fair.
843865724959514625 2017-03-20 16:44:01 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS You need psychiatric care and a new job.
843858924289904640 2017-03-20 16:17:00 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @EliSananes He was pathetic.
843854615254851584 2017-03-20 15:59:52 UTC <gaughran444> Comey perplexed by Conaway's stupidity.
843852787486261249 2017-03-20 15:52:37 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Preposterous. Shameless fools.
843852444270575617 2017-03-20 15:51:15 UTC <gaughran444> Nunes trying to link Russia with Hillary! Pathetic. Next he'll call for her birth certificate.
843851651941355520 2017-03-20 15:48:06 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yes he did. Nasty little cracker. Couldn't care less about his country.
843851482743083009 2017-03-20 15:47:26 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC They're outraged or they're just trying to play out the clock.
843850956953608193 2017-03-20 15:45:20 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Haha. Belly up to the microphone Roger. Keep talking!
843846247735877632 2017-03-20 15:26:38 UTC <gaughran444> Gowdy trying to point to Obama? Nasty little cracker.
843844375478198273 2017-03-20 15:19:11 UTC <gaughran444> Gowdy doesn't give a flying fuck about collusion with Russia. So many flag pins, such little love of country.
843836431558737920 2017-03-20 14:47:37 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Last chance to redeem his reputation.
843835019676303362 2017-03-20 14:42:01 UTC <gaughran444> All these quisling republican motherfuckers can ask about is leaks.  When do the real questions start?
843804404922892289 2017-03-20 12:40:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Such a pathetic little man.
843804029624991750 2017-03-20 12:38:52 UTC <gaughran444> @lawfareblog @TheRickWilson Really interesting.
843789846279852032 2017-03-20 11:42:30 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Too wonderful to contemplate.
843788712710496257 2017-03-20 11:38:00 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Where did this ghastly man come from?
843787154186690560 2017-03-20 11:31:49 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Nervous about Comey?
843786706612641794 2017-03-20 11:30:02 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @AUkeibro Yes. Their hatred got the better of them.
843785863473610752 2017-03-20 11:26:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You sound nervous this morning.

843671804556337156 2017-03-19 03:53:27 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @donnabrazile Let us pray.
843666056812085249 2017-03-19 03:30:37 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox If that Russian pee tape comes out can we bag the bed-wetting liberal thing once and for all?

843661221245206528 2017-03-19 03:11:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics As if she is committed to anything but her family's enrichment.
843653556901203969 2017-03-19 02:40:56 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump @AUkeibro They never thought he'd hurt nice white people. Golly!
843653242798116864 2017-03-19 02:39:42 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala For the presidency. Sniff, sniff.
843635358239744005 2017-03-19 01:28:38 UTC <gaughran444> @kurteichenwald @BCSauerhaft Give him another few weeks.  He's got this!
843634888557453312 2017-03-19 01:26:46 UTC <gaughran444> @nytpolitics @hillhulse Yes, and if they could defeat him (they can't) what horror would be next in line?

843559201620279296 2017-03-19 20:26:00 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol This is truly alarming.
843557004358631425 2017-03-19 20:17:17 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I know. Praying he gets taken down in a wide stance situation.
843556389943435264 2017-03-19 20:14:50 UTC <gaughran444> @DCHomos Awful.
843555982638792705 2017-03-19 20:13:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Yeah. Painful contrast. Hope it hurts.
843554079540436992 2017-03-19 20:05:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Why are they so obsessed with him?
843553367251206145 2017-03-19 20:02:49 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro His dumbness is hard to bear but ultimately may be a blessing. May take him down.
843450833467523072 2017-03-19 13:15:23 UTC <gaughran444> @Reuters @CLewandowski_ Do you still hit women?
843445574263328770 2017-03-19 12:54:30 UTC <gaughran444> @ColumbiaLaw He was a great professor and a really nice guy!
843445401139265536 2017-03-19 12:53:48 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile That's it.
843445199577726976 2017-03-19 12:53:00 UTC <gaughran444> @wnct9 @KeithOlbermann Trump has made America great again. Right here.
843444667706499072 2017-03-19 12:50:53 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @IrisL49 Trump has made America great again. And so quickly.
843403581281701888 2017-03-19 10:07:38 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics How about never? Does never work for you?
843222046326882304 2017-03-18 22:06:16 UTC <gaughran444> @ancelinacolia @OccupyDemocrat1 I love this so much.
843219910251724800 2017-03-18 21:57:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BadgerMBB @PRyan Almost as fun as kicking people off healthcare plans!
843219332977102849 2017-03-18 21:55:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT The Irish hate you too Ryan. Choirboy from hell.
843218959751110656 2017-03-18 21:54:00 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol About time.
843218534478073856 2017-03-18 21:52:19 UTC <gaughran444> @SenFeinstein @politico Let us pray.
843209587444645888 2017-03-18 21:16:46 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump I'd rather pay for NATO than Trump Tower and Mar a Lago security any day.
843209341134147584 2017-03-18 21:15:47 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump We saw the footage, schmucko. You embarrassed our country.
843205732866674688 2017-03-18 21:01:27 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 Agree. She has no qualifications. Think she says stuff like "Daddy they were from Russia, we like them," etc.
843139871569010690 2017-03-18 16:39:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Truth is a defense to libel/defamation, right?
843138436596989957 2017-03-18 16:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Instead he kills innocent animals. Cool guy.
843137863822856193 2017-03-18 16:31:46 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Praying that he will take opportunity to redeem his reputation, which once was good.
843137607190110211 2017-03-18 16:30:44 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Exactly. Sharp contrast to Bonespur Boy.
843137411022540800 2017-03-18 16:29:58 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 I think so too. She distills and explains to Dolt 45 what happens in meetings.
843136578729971712 2017-03-18 16:26:39 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated At least he seems to know how to cut and paste. Wouldn't have guessed that.
843136161442881537 2017-03-18 16:25:00 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders As always, a firm grasp of the obvious.
843100771168239617 2017-03-18 14:04:22 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @LoveMyCymba He's senile and though she was Hillary.
843094359776153601 2017-03-18 13:38:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow @JaneGrader Exactly!

843083881419038720 2017-03-18 12:57:15 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffingtonPost Hope the death is painful.
843083348977303552 2017-03-18 12:55:08 UTC <gaughran444> @WomenG4Hillary @IrisL49 Maybe he's having hormonal problems.  You know men at this age.
843083178025926656 2017-03-18 12:54:28 UTC <gaughran444> @kharyp @IrisL49 Hope little D had fun with Shortey.
843081901661405184 2017-03-18 12:49:23 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol @GovHowardDean Poignant.
842948837824258048 2017-03-17 04:00:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ZerlinaMaxwell She was thinking "They went from Barack to this??"
842900754977488896 2017-03-17 00:49:34 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I think he thought she was Hillary.
842894901700415488 2017-03-17 00:26:19 UTC <gaughran444> I think Dolt 45 didn't shake her hand bc he's demented and thought she was Hillary.pic.twitter.com/Bwh5d7Mr0J
842894489152819201 2017-03-17 00:24:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Saw that. A big deal. Said after she met with Comey.

842865999552659460 2017-03-17 22:31:28 UTC <gaughran444> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Did she say this before or after she met with Comey?
842861430818967554 2017-03-17 22:13:19 UTC <gaughran444> @AndreaChalupa @AUkeibro @Shareblue Give her more!!
842861239072112640 2017-03-17 22:12:33 UTC <gaughran444> @BrennanCenter Trump is afraid of black people and wants everyone else to be, too.
842859716984406016 2017-03-17 22:06:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MeetThePress @chucktodd It's actually good that these monsters are incompetent.  Sad but true.
842858788159963136 2017-03-17 22:02:49 UTC <gaughran444> @leahmcelrath @AUkeibro @Shareblue Maybe the imbecile thought she was Hillary.
842854746528628736 2017-03-17 21:46:45 UTC <gaughran444> @SenJoniErnst @politico Wow. This is the pig castrating lady. He'd better listen up.
842832868120387585 2017-03-17 20:19:49 UTC <gaughran444> @prof_erikalee @joseiswriting Our ancestors were welcome unless they were clearly unwell. This "we did it legally" stuff is total nonsense.

842823942272442370 2017-03-17 19:44:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated To whom?
842822170153795585 2017-03-17 19:37:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why choose?
842770656836116480 2017-03-17 16:12:37 UTC <gaughran444> @WhiteHouse @RepublicanStudy @realDonaldTrump Studying how to take food from old people? Or children?
842700970463322115 2017-03-17 11:35:42 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Trump couldn't read the back of cereal box. Brain is shot.
842582065078067200 2017-03-16 03:43:13 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Pence.
842578128790851585 2017-03-16 03:27:34 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko It's true. Not a single goddamned one.
842574157518987264 2017-03-16 03:11:48 UTC <gaughran444> @thehill @justinhendrix Except third graders are cute.
842564796956524544 2017-03-16 02:34:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon That's right. Hard to keep track of all the lies.
842564520409255937 2017-03-16 02:33:30 UTC <gaughran444> @cimarcos @joshtpm Names please.
842563463566282752 2017-03-16 02:29:18 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Keep talking fool.
842563013068709888 2017-03-16 02:27:31 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @jbouie Of course. They never thought he'd hurt good - i.e. white - people.
842562474511683586 2017-03-16 02:25:22 UTC <gaughran444> @KPRC2 @Fahrenthold Hopefully a harbinger of things to come.
842562196605456386 2017-03-16 02:24:16 UTC <gaughran444> @JenGranholm Yes. We need to make American respectable again after this shameful debacle.
842560529784889345 2017-03-16 02:17:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TheAtlantic @davidfrum @tribelaw Frum's piece makes no mention of the alleged damage to the state should the EO be implemented.
842531706397704194 2017-03-16 00:23:06 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon He got pretty far making stuff up about Obama's birth certificate. Why stop now?
842530774914142209 2017-03-16 00:19:24 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Yes. And probably still thought he could be the republicans' president, too.
842529262330699776 2017-03-16 00:13:24 UTC <gaughran444> @davidfrum @TheAtlantic Interesting but completely ignores the arguments of injury made on behalf of the state.
842527559933988864 2017-03-16 00:06:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro I think Obama could sue his ass into another galaxy but is too dignified to do so.
842495307762012161 2017-03-16 21:58:28 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt His food should be withheld until demonstrable impact on his performance can be established.
842494611952205824 2017-03-16 21:55:42 UTC <gaughran444> @YouTube @GovChristie Wow! Almost as strong a turn around as Obama did with the whole country!
842492920766877697 2017-03-16 21:48:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Why don't we wait till the end of the story on this one?
842492592168357888 2017-03-16 21:47:41 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics If Eddie Munster and Satan had a baby. A mean, duplicitous baby.
842488622502854656 2017-03-16 21:31:54 UTC <gaughran444> @sethdmichaels @jbouie Small-minded con man posing as policy wonk. Stinginess of soul fully revealed.
842487218203774976 2017-03-16 21:26:20 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR How many tax dollars spent on the racist's hallucinations that a black guy was trying to get him?
842486623577214976 2017-03-16 21:23:58 UTC <gaughran444> @TheScope @newtgingrich Not under Trump's budget. Which you support.
842475094983229441 2017-03-16 20:38:09 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Why did you appoint yourself the round little court jester for this pathetic man?
842474794511679489 2017-03-16 20:36:58 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS You'll starve the poor, destroy the environment, kill medical research and end anti-terrorism funding to NYPD. How dare you?

842431744259330048 2017-03-16 17:45:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Obama is 100% smarter, kinder, better looking, better president, more loved, and black. Trump's worst nightmare.
842430249111584768 2017-03-16 17:39:57 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 My white mother dropped that one on us all the time. Pretty effective.
842429791273910275 2017-03-16 17:38:08 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated First had to explain the constitution, then the first amendment.  All during Fox News commercial breaks.
842429519868919808 2017-03-16 17:37:03 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Hey Trump pog mo thoin! (Kiss my ass in Gaelic) 
842428653434753024 2017-03-16 17:33:37 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated This is his chance to go down in history as a true patriot.
842428190341640192 2017-03-16 17:31:46 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Okay, dude, counting on you. If this pans out let us know where to send bottles of champagne.

842179609194070016 2017-03-15 01:04:00 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw He's not familiar with the establishment clause or, for that matter, the first amendment.
842178175530598401 2017-03-15 00:58:18 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And the Iraq war. And Sarah Palin.

842171538942111744 2017-03-15 00:31:56 UTC <gaughran444> @JasonKander And a cruel, nonfunctional healthcare plan. He's got it all!

842170095958921217 2017-03-15 00:26:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko Read the opinion. That's pretty much it.
842168254600761345 2017-03-15 00:18:53 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I was worried Feinstein looked beat and disappointed. A natural pessimist.
842148969857880064 2017-03-15 23:02:15 UTC <gaughran444> @IvankaTrump Your father will deprive these people - his voters - of treatment.  He's horrible and you're a complete fraud.
842148613501386753 2017-03-15 23:00:50 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Stop Making Sense.
842148505032499201 2017-03-15 23:00:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid The genocidal racist part works for Orange Hitler.

842099807493722112 2017-03-15 19:46:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MaryDram Could set his hood on fire.
842060965789216773 2017-03-15 17:12:33 UTC <gaughran444> @amyohconnor @maevehiggins Funny!
842049105622929408 2017-03-15 16:25:25 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro If he takes Trump down I might forgive him. Sure that factor will weigh heavily on his decision-making process. :)
842042273932140550 2017-03-15 15:58:17 UTC <gaughran444> @MorningConsult @KellyannePolls Most despised president in American history. No one likes you either.
842041673374945280 2017-03-15 15:55:53 UTC <gaughran444> @thedailybeast Appalling.
842017312765038592 2017-03-15 14:19:05 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT Yes he did. Pouting away.
842011663331143680 2017-03-15 13:56:39 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Trump said people should exercise their 2nd amendment rights on Hillary Clinton. BFD.
842007269567000576 2017-03-15 13:39:11 UTC <gaughran444> @thinkprogress @resnikoff Ryan is an invertebrate.
842005621536919552 2017-03-15 13:32:38 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Hoping he wants to redeem his reputation. He used to be respected.
842005303323443201 2017-03-15 13:31:22 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes. But he can't pretend to be president. It's not working.
842005046191652868 2017-03-15 13:30:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump The American people are appalled by you.
842004347500261376 2017-03-15 13:27:34 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you stop rallying and golfing and tweeting and watching tv and do your job?
841971952843669505 2017-03-15 11:18:51 UTC <gaughran444> @SnoopDogg @realDonaldTrump Such a model of dignity. Priorities in order. A grateful nation thanks you.

841861821439062016 2017-03-14 04:01:13 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes And what? When people ask about all the sick uninsured, blink those faux soulful blue eyes and mumble about freedom?
841861219090878464 2017-03-14 03:58:50 UTC <gaughran444> @HeatherWhaley @funder He looks like an understudy for Liza Minnelli in Cabaret.  Is that what he's going for?
841860791041155072 2017-03-14 03:57:08 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Good. I don't want to pay for this xenophobic bullshit.
841855722388373505 2017-03-14 03:36:59 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders @OccupyDemocrat1 As always a firm grasp of the obvious.
841855195172724737 2017-03-14 03:34:54 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Don't need this guy to figure it out. Glaringly obvious.
841855019028750336 2017-03-14 03:34:12 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Gingrich has a really big problem with how irrelevant he is.
841851178333941762 2017-03-14 03:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Yes. And it was hyped as such.
841844854678249472 2017-03-14 02:53:48 UTC <gaughran444> @RenuZ @armandodkos But doesn't show him breaking law or being beholden to Russia. It's legal to suck as a businessman.
841844602550267904 2017-03-14 02:52:48 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Why? Didn't this 2005 return make him look good? Remember Romney's 3% tax rate?
841844279286890496 2017-03-14 02:51:31 UTC <gaughran444> @DonaldJTrumpJr @seanhannity @CNN Nice try. Produce 2008 and onwards returns and we'll see.
841843710346330114 2017-03-14 02:49:15 UTC <gaughran444> @LouiseMensch @deg2 @maddow Pretty subtle stuff for TV audience.
841834562829328384 2017-03-14 02:12:54 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow This was an overhyped story. Big mistake. Hurts urgency of calls for recent returns. Made DT look good. Surprised you did this.
841834099241295879 2017-03-14 02:11:04 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Poor little things.
841833811361034241 2017-03-14 02:09:55 UTC <gaughran444> @eosnos @JuddApatow Yes. And skip the hyper news stories until it's obtained.
841833341884215298 2017-03-14 02:08:03 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes this was flattering to him. Think he released. Hope Comey news tomorrow is more encouraging.
841828711078981632 2017-03-14 01:49:39 UTC <gaughran444> @mkraju Hope so! And hope this story more legit than Maddow tax return story tonight.
841828384707629056 2017-03-14 01:48:21 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Yes so why all the fuss about this? Flattering info for DT. Sorry but seems dumb af.
841828096311492608 2017-03-14 01:47:13 UTC <gaughran444> @MaeveReston @FranTownsend @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump Yes. This story is dumb af. Bet trump released this return. Mistake to air this story.
841826279636774912 2017-03-14 01:40:00 UTC <gaughran444> @armandodkos Yes. Which is why this story strikes me as a waste of time, if not damaging to demands for his recent returns.
841826041534504960 2017-03-14 01:39:03 UTC <gaughran444> @GilTPolitics Yes that makes sense.
841822098268028928 2017-03-14 01:23:23 UTC <gaughran444> Love Maddow, but don't ever let her host the Oscars.
841821569110425600 2017-03-14 01:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I wish she'd spit it out already. Twitter has destroyed my attention span and need gratification before commercial break.
841721943619440641 2017-03-14 18:45:24 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You are the master of the obvious.
841721810303496196 2017-03-14 18:44:52 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean I sure hope so. Orange Hitler made it to the White House.
841721602274406401 2017-03-14 18:44:03 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Wow. Straight up lie.

841678927072514053 2017-03-14 15:54:28 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 TrumpCare is a disaster. TrumpCare is a terrible plan. TrumpCare is class warfare. No one wants TrumpCare.
841678586767650816 2017-03-14 15:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Thank you Obama!
841637965147303936 2017-03-14 13:11:42 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Like those little Russian nesting dolls.

841482595527450624 2017-03-13 02:54:19 UTC <gaughran444> Elizabeth Warren told to sit down and shut up. Steve King? Crickets.

841467152062435328 2017-03-13 01:52:57 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Criticizing? Try savaging.
841466713652776961 2017-03-13 01:51:12 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Jeanine Pirro.
841465629882363905 2017-03-13 01:46:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro This is really depressing. I cringe to think of the party hack the justice dept will slot in there.
841464964602839041 2017-03-13 01:44:15 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @AUkeibro Exactly. The Beverly Hillbillies except from Queens.
841464508551946240 2017-03-13 01:42:27 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama I hope not. Feel like it's open season for racists since you know who got elected.
841460854512091136 2017-03-13 01:27:55 UTC <gaughran444> @business @MaddowBlog Sounds like a bribe, no?
841460237068558336 2017-03-13 01:25:28 UTC <gaughran444> Keith Ellison just told everyone to "buck up." I assume that would include this whiner.
841459250496978946 2017-03-13 01:21:33 UTC <gaughran444> @allinwithchris @EthanObama it works for Steve King.
841458634290786304 2017-03-13 01:19:06 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Because no one has a more rollicking sense of humor than Donald Trump.
841458300969467906 2017-03-13 01:17:47 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid I think they're trying to make Trump voters feel at home.
841436137986101249 2017-03-13 23:49:43 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Hope it causes a painful injury.
841435656773611520 2017-03-13 23:47:48 UTC <gaughran444> @paulkrugman Why not just amend Obamacare like a normal, functioning legislative body?
841434658822840321 2017-03-13 23:43:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Grotesque.
841434494922022912 2017-03-13 23:43:11 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom @hughhewitt @chrislhayes I hope this backfires on this morally bankrupt little POS.

841433927738875905 2017-03-13 23:40:56 UTC <gaughran444> @impeach_d_trump Summer's Eve.
841433564608679938 2017-03-13 23:39:29 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Why not go Jonathan Swift and just kill the poor people? Will bring down the deficit and no more whining about insurance.
841432500736016384 2017-03-13 23:35:15 UTC <gaughran444> @MSignorile Our tax dollars are being spent on this hallucinatory bullshit.

841093471280779264 2017-03-12 01:08:04 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @VABVOX Glad you do. I guess identity politics is stuff that happens to other people.

841051472070639617 2017-03-12 22:21:11 UTC <gaughran444> @tripgabriel No. They either agree with him or are cowards.
841050237452079105 2017-03-12 22:16:17 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan @preDEEone Meanwhile you and I pay for the Ryans to have the best healthcare around.

840797669316517888 2017-03-11 05:32:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Hope so bc it could bring down his presidency but also just hope so because it's him.

840793171068100609 2017-03-11 05:14:47 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Me too. Maybe he can take up jacks for the other hours of the day.

840644173820768256 2017-03-11 19:22:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean Yes and unfortunately a lot of people listen to him, including our deranged president.
840643525763055616 2017-03-11 19:20:09 UTC <gaughran444> @mcbridetd @deg2 Ryan is so comfortable just making shit up. I want to see the healthcare plan he and his family have, what it costs us.

839969062239240193 2017-03-09 22:40:04 UTC <gaughran444> @AriBerman @SisterGiant According to Trump voters, absolutely.

839937731438477312 2017-03-09 20:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @scottdetrow @nprpolitics Hopefully once in a lifetime.
839936996676157440 2017-03-09 20:32:39 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum Ryan feels cool using the word conceit. He's not that bright and doesn't understand many things.
839936766220120064 2017-03-09 20:31:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddLegum TrumpCare looks like a bad idea. No one wants TrumpCare.

839913081341939714 2017-03-09 18:57:38 UTC <gaughran444> @CitizenCohn This is the premise of medical insurance.
839912456810020864 2017-03-09 18:55:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Most Americans did not vote for him for this, among other, reasons.

838241419311611904 2017-03-04 04:15:02 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro If you want to see an impressive Obama rage meltdown, check Hannity. Almost as good as DT's a.m. psychotic break.
838238364151205892 2017-03-04 04:02:54 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro It's all they've got. When cornered, they scream "Obama!" Very limited repertoire.
838237326904016896 2017-03-04 03:58:47 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Yeah but funny too. When cornered, these guys just start screaming "Obama!" Very limited repertoire.
838236916000702464 2017-03-04 03:57:09 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Oh man. Deeply pathetic.
838236362239328256 2017-03-04 03:54:57 UTC <gaughran444> @AttyDeniseBrown All these guys sinking right back into Obama bashing. Check out Hannity. Sheer desperation.
838235828186976256 2017-03-04 03:52:49 UTC <gaughran444> @studentactivism @docrocktex26 Will only be a headline if it happens to white people. #FlintWaterCrisis
838230809882525697 2017-03-04 03:32:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Can you get a punching bag with Obama's face on it? Haha. You're almost as crazy as your orange friend.
838230243596959744 2017-03-04 03:30:38 UTC <gaughran444> @seanhannity After 8 years you're hard-wired to attack Obama when you're upset. Hilarious.
838227582340431872 2017-03-04 03:20:03 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @seanhannity Haha Hannity you horse's ass! It's Obama's fault that Comrade Trump is going down!
838227097269190656 2017-03-04 03:18:08 UTC <gaughran444> @drmom89 @docrocktex26 Wouldn't let this crazy bastard water my plants.
838221676923994113 2017-03-04 02:56:35 UTC <gaughran444> @joeburb @MaryDram @MCO @orlandosentinel @OSPhoto Looks like his tie is attacking him. Good tie.
838220011382714368 2017-03-04 02:49:58 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy They're back in their favorite groove - blaming Obama for everything.
838217918676615168 2017-03-04 02:41:39 UTC <gaughran444> @jonfavs Maybe he scaled Trump Tower like spider man.
838126133824602112 2017-03-04 20:36:56 UTC <gaughran444> @W7VOA @ANNELAMOTT @POTUS @jeffsessions @ABC Sounds like a super fun place to work.
838125766567157760 2017-03-04 20:35:29 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Finally.
838121252644655104 2017-03-04 20:17:32 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Such alarming thoughts for that shrinking, desiccated brain. Fizzle, fizzle, pop.
838117974997417985 2017-03-04 20:04:31 UTC <gaughran444> @SopanDeb He'll be banging that irrelevant drum as his orange leader is led off in chains.
838117621572710400 2017-03-04 20:03:07 UTC <gaughran444> @andrewthesmart @NavKaz Yes, the fuses appear to be blowing as we speak.
838116884365131776 2017-03-04 20:00:11 UTC <gaughran444> @seanhannity Haha! Your crackpot is going down and you want to turn on the black guy! Not gonna work!
838107238728364032 2017-03-04 19:21:51 UTC <gaughran444> @anamariecox He couldn't order one. A judge would need to grant a warrant after application from law enforcement agency.
838106760141553664 2017-03-04 19:19:57 UTC <gaughran444> @colinjones @thedailybeast I'll say! Let's get to the bottom of this Russian business. Serious stuff!
838104381820125185 2017-03-04 19:10:30 UTC <gaughran444> @seanhannity No you fool. DOJ is investigating your orange friend for collaboration with Russians.
838103160531128320 2017-03-04 19:05:39 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 Makes sense. DT too dumb/primitive to understand only law enforcement would get a warrant to wiretap. Had to be DOJ.
838101358674857985 2017-03-04 18:58:29 UTC <gaughran444> @davidsirota @MaryDram @IBTimes The people's president.
838101196355305472 2017-03-04 18:57:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TheDailyEdge Can you imagine the Trump presidential museum? A red hat and a tuft of orange hair?
838100594934091776 2017-03-04 18:55:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Obama has everything DT doesn't: looks, brains and the love of millions. And he's black! Drives crazyface out of his mind.
838094189275541508 2017-03-04 18:30:00 UTC <gaughran444> @EJDionne It suggests that there is such an investigation by the DOJ and that WH didn't interfere. This is a big deal.
838041436859793408 2017-03-04 15:00:23 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost It's called paranoid personality disorder.
838040919916032000 2017-03-04 14:58:20 UTC <gaughran444> @CarolEvansWM Among many other attributes, what an amazingly dignified woman.
838040709064192002 2017-03-04 14:57:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA Tiny brow this would be serious bc it would mean that a judge issued a warrant to tap DT's phone.
838034268521697280 2017-03-04 14:31:54 UTC <gaughran444> @EJDionne Yes. Unless Obama spidermanned up trump tower and tapped the phone himself, as DT probably suspects.
838032381202337796 2017-03-04 14:24:24 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood While also accusing former president of haunting his house. 25th amendment time.
838031941484101634 2017-03-04 14:22:39 UTC <gaughran444> @greenhousenyt Didn't believe or didn't understand or doesn't remember. He's impaired and has got to go.
838030913384611845 2017-03-04 14:18:34 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Sure is what it sounds like. Or he's having a psychotic break.
838030619611394049 2017-03-04 14:17:24 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You need psychiatric care, not a high pressure job with immense responsibility.
838008674740289536 2017-03-04 12:50:12 UTC <gaughran444> @SaIIy_Yates It looks like he's having a psychotic break but he's so inarticulate it's hard to tell.
838000878766419968 2017-03-04 12:19:13 UTC <gaughran444> @SimonMaloy Hallucinations?
837995040211369985 2017-03-04 11:56:01 UTC <gaughran444> @politico What's the plan? Public executions?
837992456356573185 2017-03-04 11:45:45 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump See a psychiatrist.
837992352430059520 2017-03-04 11:45:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Special prosecutor.
837871327545606144 2017-03-03 03:44:26 UTC <gaughran444> @bubbaprog @MaryDram Wtf is on his head?
837673025277415424 2017-03-03 14:36:27 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Somehow I think I'd remember chatting with him.
837672655591522305 2017-03-03 14:34:58 UTC <gaughran444> @tribelaw From your fingers to God's twitter feed.
837672460501811202 2017-03-03 14:34:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JamilSmith @sunnysingh_n6 @WhiteHouse I find it heartbreaking, especially now that the place is being run by rabid racists.
837642772068847616 2017-03-03 12:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @joshgerstein @politico We need a special counsel.
837640282833317888 2017-03-03 12:26:20 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump It is so pathetic that you're beholden to Putin. #TrumpRussia
837527170683568128 2017-03-02 04:56:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SInow @JuddApatow This is happening all over. Awful.
837518110236246017 2017-03-02 04:20:52 UTC <gaughran444> @thefix @jmeacham Hope these lovebirds call for an independent prosecutor.

837432105047109632 2017-03-02 22:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Someone should slip Beauregard a nice blunt. He's gonna need it.

837387283556859904 2017-03-02 19:41:00 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Wow. She was lavish in her praise for him pre-confirmation. This is significant. Good for her.

837385480605925376 2017-03-02 19:33:51 UTC <gaughran444> @bmetzmetz @JaneGrader And definitely more than their own constituents, who they hide from.
837385194319593473 2017-03-02 19:32:42 UTC <gaughran444> @politico This guy's too dumb for Russians to want to speak with. He'll be the last man standing.
837384046711877633 2017-03-02 19:28:09 UTC <gaughran444> @GrahamBlog @SenJohnMcCain @ananavarro Wish these lovebirds would call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Russia-Trump.
837348242849476608 2017-03-02 17:05:52 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 This made my day. Thanks.
837344072029327360 2017-03-02 16:49:18 UTC <gaughran444> @ggreenwald No, actually it's time to make that exact equation.  Why do you think they are they all lying about it?
837343725172965377 2017-03-02 16:47:55 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Hard to choose which of these bastard is the worst but he's in the running for #1.

837286887203164161 2017-03-02 13:02:04 UTC <gaughran444> @jdawsey1 @iarnsdorf @politico Evidently.
837284330741317632 2017-03-02 12:51:55 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @MSNBC Like the impish smile while he lies through his teeth. Nice touch.
837143999676825602 2017-03-01 03:34:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce They were both bi-pedal.

837139510479683586 2017-03-01 03:16:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Perhaps it did.

836946742046257153 2017-03-01 14:30:27 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol How about reckless? A danger to the planet?
836946365364207616 2017-03-01 14:28:57 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Probably a good idea for the next four years.
836919986744606721 2017-03-01 12:44:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics So much for this guy. Thought he was smart.

836919430940610560 2017-03-01 12:41:56 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated And a lot of the media, not to mention the country, appears to have bought it. Fucking depressing.
836918874721374208 2017-03-01 12:39:43 UTC <gaughran444> @ACLU Finally. They were a-ok with it for a long time.
836918430364225536 2017-03-01 12:37:57 UTC <gaughran444> @JKH2 It really was. Didn't think he'd be so gullible.
836819782326439936 2017-02-28 06:05:58 UTC <gaughran444> @NolanDMcCaskill @realDonaldTrump @politico I think you meant to say Trump exploits a traumatized woman for cheap political gain.

836777511480602625 2017-02-28 03:17:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AmbassadorRice Because this incompetent lunatic is president.

836770640120135680 2017-02-28 02:50:41 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And if someone gets killed in a mission I approved I will blame them.
836770343113142273 2017-02-28 02:49:30 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics At this point the White House is a sanctuary for extremists.

834215343409201153 2017-02-21 01:36:51 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No. All black people look the same to him. Probably thought it was "my African American over there."
834214602372239361 2017-02-21 01:33:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Now that they realize that Obamacare is not just for brown people, they're all for it.
834213697732145152 2017-02-21 01:30:19 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Because he's a white supremacist who works for a latter day Nazi.

833900656733859840 2017-02-20 04:46:24 UTC <gaughran444> @robreiner We need the republicans to unload this lunatic and they care more about maintaining power than their country.

830972943442255872 2017-02-12 02:52:43 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Same. Don't know who half of them are and wonder if they're cold with so little clothing.
830972310534356992 2017-02-12 02:50:12 UTC <gaughran444> @SenSanders You helped get us here. Go away.

830863173142065157 2017-02-12 19:36:31 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesMBlow Don't think so. It's dangerous for our country to have a patently insane president.  Who is going to talk about it. Repubs?
830862578817564677 2017-02-12 19:34:10 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Our country is on fire and you're focused on your same old lines. Go away.

830835579206193152 2017-02-12 17:46:52 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You need to go away. You had your moment, did more harm than good. Go away.

824001809467457536 2017-01-24 21:11:55 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Exactly. No one believes it. It's a pretext for minority voter suppression.

822070899855785985 2017-01-19 13:19:10 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Thanks for much needed laugh.
822070792603238400 2017-01-19 13:18:44 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Skip that guy in the middle. He had his rehearsal. Didn't go well.
821937229731872769 2017-01-18 04:28:01 UTC <gaughran444> @emilynussbaum @ClaraJeffery Next time Kanye don't cozy up to racists.
821929870494224385 2017-01-18 03:58:46 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @speechboy71 Right. Like I wouldn't take a job driving an 18 wheeler. Don't know how. Could hurt someone.

821922307451002880 2017-01-18 03:28:43 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated The best of my lifetime too. Outstanding president.
821921814020493313 2017-01-18 03:26:45 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @greenhousenyt Disgraceful.
821920864031612928 2017-01-18 03:22:59 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Is that a wax figure? So scary.

821898197903831040 2017-01-18 01:52:55 UTC <gaughran444> @TonyOrlando @FoxNews @GilTPolitics My 18 yr old son asked who he is. I said "king of all has beens."
821895423568867328 2017-01-18 01:41:53 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Surprising. He seems like such an honorable man.
821894478210433029 2017-01-18 01:38:08 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Damn!!!!
821893335719800832 2017-01-18 01:33:35 UTC <gaughran444> @POLITICOMag @politico Well-founded fear. Dangerous fraud.
821753977524076544 2017-01-18 16:19:50 UTC <gaughran444> @esquire @CharlesPPierce Yes. And she's an insult to public education and students with disabilities.
821753054458417154 2017-01-18 16:16:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA An analogy! Well done!
821752469898330112 2017-01-18 16:13:50 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Omg. Hellish.
821719869888614400 2017-01-18 14:04:18 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics And has never heard of the IDEA, the law that allows students with disabilities to get a decent education. #Unqualified
821719409312100354 2017-01-18 14:02:28 UTC <gaughran444> @JaneGrader @ananavarro She is patently unqualified. Never heard of the IDEA. Ana, you know that's serious.
821718835845857280 2017-01-18 14:00:11 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost Oh no. This is going to get ugly.
821718194234814464 2017-01-18 13:57:38 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig If anything people are probably being paid to attend this national funeral/inauguration.
821717656596312064 2017-01-18 13:55:30 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 She's a disaster waiting to happen.  Terrible choice.
821571112060485632 2017-01-17 04:13:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnLeguizamo @joanwalsh @ananavarro DeVos never heard of the IDEA! Hearing should have been over then and there. Unqualified.
821568213888733185 2017-01-17 04:01:40 UTC <gaughran444> @LeftOfMainSt @SenSanders Again you miss the point. She's terrible not because she's rich but because she's terrible.
821567832681021440 2017-01-17 04:00:09 UTC <gaughran444> @wontchathink Same. Aiming for 5 years w/o hearing the sound of his voice. #NotMyPresident
821563996532867072 2017-01-17 03:44:55 UTC <gaughran444> @SenatorHassan @sunnysingh_n6 @Lollardfish This should have concluded the hearing. No further questions necessary. Unqualified.
821562537271496704 2017-01-17 03:39:07 UTC <gaughran444> @Fahrenthold @pbump His tiny hands etc really haunt him.
821553621301161984 2017-01-17 03:03:41 UTC <gaughran444> @GlazerRandee @mattmfm This is a disgrace.
821543112820588544 2017-01-17 02:21:56 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @DCHomos @GavinNewsom Oh no. Creature from hell.
821542950396162049 2017-01-17 02:21:17 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Tweet! Tweet! Should be quick!
821542811573035013 2017-01-17 02:20:44 UTC <gaughran444> @asherhuey Hopefully she's just wholly ignorant of the law and not hoping that Congress will repeal the right of disabled children to learn.
821530246797262848 2017-01-17 01:30:48 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @thinkprogress Shouldn't they call it a night when someone says this?
821529786472402944 2017-01-17 01:28:59 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Oh ffs. What now orange cow?
821527190110081024 2017-01-17 01:18:40 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @jeffchu Oh no. A lunatic.
821526714975186945 2017-01-17 01:16:46 UTC <gaughran444> The former.
821525878358372354 2017-01-17 01:13:27 UTC <gaughran444> @mkh531 @girlsreallyrule Is this true??  Where does one find such a hall of fame of terrible people? Each one worse than the next.
821525637261389829 2017-01-17 01:12:29 UTC <gaughran444> If Orange Hitler gets zapped by lightning on Friday I'm going to rethink this agnostic thing.
821484034073264129 2017-01-17 22:27:10 UTC <gaughran444> @LindseyGrahamSC Can you go back to the Russia issue?
821450958504939520 2017-01-17 20:15:44 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @sunnysingh_n6 @JuddLegum Thank you GOP.
821450563736965121 2017-01-17 20:14:10 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig From the racists hall of fame.
821353072253370368 2017-01-17 13:46:47 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Biden fully rejects the "identity politics" crap. Love him.
821348935511982080 2017-01-17 13:30:20 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Absolutely not.
821348788946292738 2017-01-17 13:29:45 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @NickReisman How dare he.
821190352170287105 2017-01-16 03:00:11 UTC <gaughran444> @williamjordann Just don't call it Obamacare. Make it clear it's for white people.
821185797940514817 2017-01-16 02:42:05 UTC <gaughran444> @NewYorker @emilynussbaum Our Eva Braun.
821185495904452608 2017-01-16 02:40:53 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @CNN @emilynussbaum @HeartAsArena Another wildly fucked up family. Surprise!

821182349660553216 2017-01-16 02:28:23 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid They thought Obamacare was for black people. Didn't realize it applied to them. Golly!
821129524691738624 2017-01-16 22:58:29 UTC <gaughran444> @BleacherReport @packers @PRyan Aren't you too busy taking healthcare away from the sick to watch football? #WePayForYourPolicy
821108495529418752 2017-01-16 21:34:55 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @MaryDram And white supremacists - the people who won the election - are the ultimate identity politics group. Bernie & co don't mess with them.
821107706291429376 2017-01-16 21:31:47 UTC <gaughran444> @CNBC @funder So far so good. Thanks Orange Hitler.
821107038193324032 2017-01-16 21:29:07 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @MaryDram "Identity politics" is code 4 white people who are sick of hearing about racism & bigotry. They're ready to move on bc it's not about them.
821098949016768512 2017-01-16 20:56:59 UTC <gaughran444> @GovHowardDean From the American point of view too.
821097976567308289 2017-01-16 20:53:07 UTC <gaughran444> @megynkelly @tripgabriel Can't read with the attention span of a gnat.
821097857969254405 2017-01-16 20:52:39 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Bingo. Bernie is about Bernie. Period.
821095779817455617 2017-01-16 20:44:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 He looked like a pain in the ass then too. Just wish he would go away. Self-involved jerk.
821057813476757504 2017-01-16 18:13:31 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @JRLHouston Sorry thought I blocked you. Congrats for being an unapologetic white, male, heterosexual Christian! Profile in courage!

821012139422912512 2017-01-16 15:12:02 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Did he? Great. So we have a seething lunatic.
821011499552534528 2017-01-16 15:09:29 UTC <gaughran444> @IAmSteveHarvey @JoyAnnReid Unless he says "sorry, I was hallucinating" doesn't really matter.
821011264805675008 2017-01-16 15:08:33 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated His henchmen may just prop him up indefinitely. Like a vicious, Orange Castro.
821010721790107649 2017-01-16 15:06:24 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics More like a funeral procession for basic dignity.
821010310123388928 2017-01-16 15:04:46 UTC <gaughran444> @blakehounshell Not yet.

820856413840936960 2017-01-15 04:53:14 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @nytpolitics Of course not.
820855904581152768 2017-01-15 04:51:13 UTC <gaughran444> @YahooNews @donnabrazile @davidaxelrod Perhaps they do but Putin has the last word. #PutinsBitch
820854043224506369 2017-01-15 04:43:49 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @ZachWritesStuff Newsflash Zachary. The "identity politics" that decided this election was white supremacy. We'll keep talking about racism. Every day.
820850544768065536 2017-01-15 04:29:55 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 @RNicholasBurns Trump only remembers the armies of cheering muslims that only he saw. Was too busy to notice NATO alliance. #UnfitToLead
820850137660616704 2017-01-15 04:28:18 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @tangelaekhoff The man has been a vicious racist for decades. And never was ashamed about it.
820849177076834306 2017-01-15 04:24:29 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA Hey! You made a pun! Rest up now. Must be tuckered out.
820803476150251520 2017-01-15 01:22:53 UTC <gaughran444> @KateMaltby We still use that law. Helps minorities, disabled people. It's a good one.
820779428871602176 2017-01-15 23:47:19 UTC <gaughran444> @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump It's hilarious watching them make fun of you. Right on target! They must be getting more popular every week. Unlike others . . .
820778675885002753 2017-01-15 23:44:20 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh @nate510 And presidents.
820760768597676033 2017-01-15 22:33:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Sorry Russia got you elected! So sorry!
820758439517372416 2017-01-15 22:23:55 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid 3. Free associative ramblings of an unhinged man who should be nowhere near the White House.
820757678725206017 2017-01-15 22:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare Wouldn't watch the inauguration if they clockwork oranged me. #notmypresident
820723183045246977 2017-01-15 20:03:49 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol He didn't bad-mouth anyone. He just spoke the truth. So disappointing!
820722834884493313 2017-01-15 20:02:26 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You're a trump enabler. Go away.
820722704424706048 2017-01-15 20:01:55 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian @ezlusztig He needs to say that under oath.
820722525072216064 2017-01-15 20:01:12 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You helped elect Trump. Go away.
820722225791848449 2017-01-15 20:00:01 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders You're a distraction and an annoyance. Stop stating the obvious and go home.
820721889119236096 2017-01-15 19:58:41 UTC <gaughran444> @KellyannePolls @robreiner @MalcolmNance Secret? No. Every American needs to know the truth about Trump/Russia.
820720122272874497 2017-01-15 19:51:40 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Sounds like a great little girl!
820719996569534464 2017-01-15 19:51:10 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump A lot of people are uniting against you. I'll give you that.

820661317648392193 2017-01-15 15:57:59 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Irresponsible is too kind a word. Vicious racism.
820653575508525056 2017-01-15 15:27:14 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden @AJentleson No, those bastards just questioned whether he was an American.
820652994094071808 2017-01-15 15:24:55 UTC <gaughran444> @politico I despise this fake choirboy.
820652610038464512 2017-01-15 15:23:23 UTC <gaughran444> @mayatcontreras @GeorgeTakei Abnormal and arguably unconstitutional.
820620549483327488 2017-01-15 13:16:00 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @maddie142519 They thought Obamacare was for black people. Golly! No more insurance for you!
820619927501570054 2017-01-15 13:13:31 UTC <gaughran444> @changemation Someone should have called the police.
820619386952253441 2017-01-15 13:11:22 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 I can't contain my sympathy.
820538920303816704 2017-01-14 07:51:38 UTC <gaughran444> @haveaclue85 He didn't dodge the draft. Think it through.
820470497452363777 2017-01-14 03:19:44 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Wow! Didn't know about this. Mad talent. And served his country. Trump, on the other hand . . .

820451681292972032 2017-01-14 02:04:58 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump 37% approval rate. Par-tay!!!
820451430859505665 2017-01-14 02:03:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Mucinex Thought this was about Trump.
820450928423763969 2017-01-14 02:01:59 UTC <gaughran444> @BarackObama @jonfavs @GabrielAivazov A joke, right?
820444552867835904 2017-01-14 01:36:39 UTC <gaughran444> @danpfeiffer Yes. And thousands of Muslims are cheering as they burn. He saw it.
820437061320769536 2017-01-14 01:06:53 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @Lee_in_Iowa Why do you think he can allow or disallow Trump to be inaugurated?
820436772551348229 2017-01-14 01:05:44 UTC <gaughran444> @KamalaHarris What does this have to do with Bernie Sanders?

817222857952522240 2017-01-05 04:14:47 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @politico I'd like to join them. Getting too scary out here.
817222620663939073 2017-01-05 04:13:50 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @LawyerRogelio Thugs. Slash and burn thugs.

817215891356139521 2017-01-05 03:47:06 UTC <gaughran444> @nahaltoosi @politico Crude POS with no interest in his country.
817215315029397505 2017-01-05 03:44:48 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Sounds like Dickens.
817208030286802945 2017-01-05 03:15:52 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon Yes, have really had enough with the apologists. Working overtime to discount the obvious.
817207527595188225 2017-01-05 03:13:52 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS I've said exactly the same thing. Can't bear it.
817206815280734208 2017-01-05 03:11:02 UTC <gaughran444> @CharlesPPierce Dear god I hope so. Am seriously sick of apologists for angry white people. It's not that complicated.
817206380209860610 2017-01-05 03:09:18 UTC <gaughran444> @BuzzFeedNews @realDonaldTrump @mattdpearce But Hillary's emails!!
817206247904657408 2017-01-05 03:08:47 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost No worries. He's doing it himself.
817205515159830532 2017-01-05 03:05:52 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood A) He's a bad liar. B) He's kind of dumb. C) He's a huge Marvin Gay fan.  Keeps asking the same question.
817195081245532160 2017-01-05 02:24:24 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich You shameless hypocrite. Remember calling Obama "the food stamps President?"
817194644073312256 2017-01-05 02:22:40 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Wild guess why.

817189877888483328 2017-01-05 02:03:44 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @Eugene_Robinson A must read. Especially the last sentence.
817188863374487552 2017-01-05 01:59:42 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes Bring the girl from Teen Vogue back on to kick his ass again
817188684663496705 2017-01-05 01:58:59 UTC <gaughran444> @AC360 @PaulBegala Because he's a quisling with the law on his tail.
817187827968516096 2017-01-05 01:55:35 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @AdrianCJax Beyond scary.

817187063934156800 2017-01-05 01:52:33 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Go for it!! And thanks for trying. Sessions is a disgrace.
817186615156215808 2017-01-05 01:50:46 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Can you be relevant and helpful for a change and advocate in favor of Obamacare?
817186377972547585 2017-01-05 01:49:49 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost What are they going to say? He's off his nut and we're all really scared?
817185721081614338 2017-01-05 01:47:13 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC Not sure he can. Seriously. Seems quite disturbed.
817185270575546369 2017-01-05 01:45:25 UTC <gaughran444> @BetteMidler Thanks for much-needed laugh. Wish you were president.
817185102253920256 2017-01-05 01:44:45 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood If this miscreant ever does have a press conference, can someone please ask him where his loyalties lie?
817184463998320640 2017-01-05 01:42:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Go Ana.
817184352656310273 2017-01-05 01:41:46 UTC <gaughran444> @carinakolodny @VP Vice President Biden, like so many Americans, I think you're the bees knees.
817184086859087872 2017-01-05 01:40:43 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Disgraceful and frightening. How dare he impune these hardworking patriots?
817183627926716417 2017-01-05 01:38:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Why are you working so hard to exonerate Russia? Where do your loyalties lie?
817183196806782977 2017-01-05 01:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Why are you frantically trying to discredit our brave, patriotic intelligence community?

816870441084219393 2017-01-04 04:54:24 UTC <gaughran444> @johnlegend That makes you human, not an elitist.

816827783800356865 2017-01-04 02:04:54 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA @GOPK8y But I will say I totally agree with you about pets as family. They are the best.
816827607262134272 2017-01-04 02:04:12 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA @GOPK8y Yeah this is gonna be awesome! Check in in 2 yrs and let us know what you think!
816819098147549184 2017-01-04 01:30:23 UTC <gaughran444> @SarahPalinUSA @ChaosApathy Actually they didn't lie they screwed up. The republican POTUS, vp & secretary of state lied. Perhaps before your time.
816815163668107264 2017-01-04 01:14:45 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated I think he's already RR late second term. Some people get super paranoid as they dement. Everything is looking good!

816811720207437826 2017-01-04 01:01:04 UTC <gaughran444> @Lee_in_Iowa @TrashyChic He also villified the poor and celebrated greed, and injected religion into modern US politics. Thanks Ronnie!

816810331632713729 2017-01-04 00:55:33 UTC <gaughran444> @docrocktex26 @andy_farquhar @bjimd I think this is true. Doesn't have the basic reasoning and verbal skills.
816807648767176706 2017-01-04 00:44:53 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics The nerve of this tiny fingered draft dodger. #bonespurboy
816806546491506689 2017-01-04 00:40:30 UTC <gaughran444> @tonyschwartz Yeah and tweet about ethics committee also didn't sound like him. Just staff trying to make him look influential and engaged?
816805913243844609 2017-01-04 00:37:59 UTC <gaughran444> @sunnysingh_n6 And yet he never looks good. Ever.
816805005084786689 2017-01-04 00:34:23 UTC <gaughran444> @TheWrap @sunnysingh_n6 @blackgirlinmain That is one sensitive fellow!
816797525499936768 2017-01-04 00:04:40 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama Yeah really wish he'd pipe down already. Not helpful. Self-appointed messiah.
816796536470437888 2017-01-04 00:00:44 UTC <gaughran444> @GlazerRandee @VA4Hillary1 It's just not fair. Making America pasty again.
816796290772271104 2017-01-04 23:59:45 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro @jesseclee44 What a morally defunct human being.
816795791855681536 2017-01-04 23:57:46 UTC <gaughran444> @petitchoux3 That is such a cute dog!!! What kind is he or she?
816764115523878932 2017-01-04 21:51:54 UTC <gaughran444> @LawyerRogelio Eloquent even back then.
816763965653024768 2017-01-04 21:51:18 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Yeah this guy is very compromised.
816763489393983497 2017-01-04 21:49:25 UTC <gaughran444> @KasiaMikurda They were against anything related to the evil Obama, never thinking he helped them too. Fools.
816762498238005254 2017-01-04 21:45:28 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yeah. I often do, but not for this stuff. I was listening.
816762280507543555 2017-01-04 21:44:37 UTC <gaughran444> @KasiaMikurda They thought Obamacare was just for black people, not good white folks. Surprise!
816761919461801985 2017-01-04 21:43:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Yeah he did say the election was rigged.  He liked the word rigged. Orange chimp likes it too, except when things go his way.
816742456872017924 2017-01-04 20:25:50 UTC <gaughran444> @EthanObama So sorry to hear from him again. All attacks and self-aggrandizement. No interest in the dreariness of real problems and solutions.
816741672067497985 2017-01-04 20:22:43 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 But Bernie is about sweeping pronouncements. Not interested in details or actually governing.
816741146458259457 2017-01-04 20:20:38 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @petitchoux3 Yeah and he's shameless. As if he had nothing to do with Trump's victory. They're both egomaniacs.
816740905101262848 2017-01-04 20:19:40 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 @SenSanders What ever suggested to you that republicans view health care as a right? Are you trying to help or just posturing?
816740373812957190 2017-01-04 20:17:34 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Did you ever have a coherent plan? Don't think so.
816735249715646469 2017-01-04 19:57:12 UTC <gaughran444> @KasiaMikurda Unless it breaks down, fast and pleasant.
816734902204977157 2017-01-04 19:55:49 UTC <gaughran444> @MotherJones @IrisL49 She's appalling.
816734694784061443 2017-01-04 19:55:00 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Good! He can end his career as a brave patriot, as he started.
816734512679882752 2017-01-04 19:54:16 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Deal with it turtle. You sank Garland Jeffries.
816734374909669376 2017-01-04 19:53:43 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Dude, do you get that you have a really serious job to do?? Jackie Evancho????
816708074392190983 2017-01-04 18:09:13 UTC <gaughran444> @NYDailyNews @joanwalsh Joey No Socks and Donnie No Brain.
816707865767510021 2017-01-04 18:08:23 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 She's strong & dignified. Unlike you know who.
816707688428142592 2017-01-04 18:07:41 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Exactly. No cause & effect from the Orange chimp.
816507049743970305 2017-01-03 04:50:25 UTC <gaughran444> @ANNELAMOTT If the shoe, or whatever, fits.
816504269461393410 2017-01-03 04:39:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I know it's all grim but this is hilarious. Will try this with his future tweets. May just save my sanity.
816503868330835968 2017-01-03 04:37:46 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @Fahrenthold @WPJohnWagner Probably being dumb because he is dumb. That's no act.
816503532132204544 2017-01-03 04:36:26 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom @JoyAnnReid Comprehensive legislation is usually fine-tuned by amendment, but our congress doesn't legislate any more. They just attack.
816502937199452160 2017-01-03 04:34:04 UTC <gaughran444> @TeaPainUSA Lying sos.
816502798674235396 2017-01-03 04:33:31 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Wait - now you're cool with identity politics? Thought we couldn't talk about such things for fear of pissing off white working class.
816502176109490176 2017-01-03 04:31:03 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Or not so lucky.
816501870919380996 2017-01-03 04:29:50 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Biggest laugh of the day.
816501436154572800 2017-01-03 04:28:06 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Such a disrespectful, primitive man.
816501101943988224 2017-01-03 04:26:47 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 And please explain what the hell a Goodlatte is.
816457377327222789 2017-01-03 01:33:02 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @dissentingj Stunning stupidity.
816456782721806336 2017-01-03 01:30:40 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 They're breakers, not makers.
816456184425226240 2017-01-03 01:28:18 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Joey No Socks with Donnie No Impulse Control.
816455879176372224 2017-01-03 01:27:05 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Glue his tiny fingers together.
816455656437850112 2017-01-03 01:26:12 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated @GlennThrush What a sluggers row of hacks.
816455148331470852 2017-01-03 01:24:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Crickets.
816455029511127041 2017-01-03 01:23:42 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump They're investigating not building a case. One comes before the other.
816391726478848001 2017-01-03 21:12:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @Montgomery_bjm I am so sorry to see him pontificating again. Nothing to offer.
816391471985295360 2017-01-03 21:11:09 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 No time like the present!
816390163182055425 2017-01-03 21:05:57 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @thefix Love him. Always will.
816389516411932672 2017-01-03 21:03:23 UTC <gaughran444> @jmeacham Make that 4 presidents and one orangutan.
816388833528913920 2017-01-03 21:00:40 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan Eeww!
816388505949630469 2017-01-03 20:59:22 UTC <gaughran444> @BernieSanders Any thoughts on how to pay for that?
816370082100158464 2017-01-03 19:46:09 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro Why would you think that of this loose cannon?
816369906748948482 2017-01-03 19:45:27 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Bravo!!! Don't back down on this!!!
816369482432184320 2017-01-03 19:43:46 UTC <gaughran444> @FoxNews @michaelcburgess @newtgingrich Do you have lifetime health coverage after being drummed out of congress for ethical lapses? Hope not.
816369083499290624 2017-01-03 19:42:11 UTC <gaughran444> @Salon He looks super wasted here.
816368855824171010 2017-01-03 19:41:17 UTC <gaughran444> @mmfa @nbc @mayatcontreras Yeah, including the lovely Santa Claus is white declaration.
816368482598211585 2017-01-03 19:39:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Neighbors4Hill No, add to infinite list of what he does not know.
816368098727129089 2017-01-03 19:38:16 UTC <gaughran444> @voxdotcom @ezraklein Absolutely nothing.

815230009115811842 2016-12-31 16:15:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump No matter what your politics, this is frightening. This man is disturbed and should not be in any position of power, much less POTUS.
815229074708824068 2016-12-31 16:12:12 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That's it exactly. He wanted to complain and accuse. She wanted to get things done.

815043837966057472 2016-12-30 03:56:08 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 She broke her back to try to lead this county. She can't take a break for a few walks in the woods?
815043126872174592 2016-12-30 03:53:18 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @kylegriffin1 Come on McCain, finish your career as the brave patriot you started out as.
815042672029302784 2016-12-30 03:51:30 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Given how contemptuous he is of our intelligence agencies, why don't they check him out?
815042358974803968 2016-12-30 03:50:15 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Trump knew, participated and owes lots of $$$ to Russia.
815042184059744256 2016-12-30 03:49:34 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You know you're over your head. Bail out now.
815041585549287424 2016-12-30 03:47:11 UTC <gaughran444> @kumailn @tribelaw @IsaLeeWolf @Lee_in_Iowa @twinlet133 I think that's where we're headed. Trump's craziness will scare even his adherents.
815040826871005185 2016-12-30 03:44:10 UTC <gaughran444> @Lee_in_Iowa @Kasparov63 I would say the latter.
815040248891764736 2016-12-30 03:41:52 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @JDiamond1 This is disgusting. We have had distinguished attorneys in this position, e.g. Donald Verilli, Robert Jackson. Not this party hack.
815039361494515712 2016-12-30 03:38:21 UTC <gaughran444> @Lee_in_Iowa @MiltShook Fuck Bernie and the white unicorn he rode in on.
815038860061278208 2016-12-30 03:36:21 UTC <gaughran444> @RawStory Wonderful woman!
814811870687326209 2016-12-30 12:34:23 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 How did she fit her tail under those pantsuits?
814810939623174144 2016-12-30 12:30:41 UTC <gaughran444> @AUkeibro So she's admitting that the interests of her boss and our country sharply diverge.
814809850056208385 2016-12-30 12:26:21 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Much of world history looks like a pissing contest. That's why we need more women leaders.
814685015284084736 2016-12-29 04:10:18 UTC <gaughran444> @OccupyDemocrat1 I don't know if education would help people who believe this stuff. Seems like willful ignorance.
814682706114211840 2016-12-29 04:01:07 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Looks dreamy.
814680204748750848 2016-12-29 03:51:11 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated How I wish we could hand him over.
814677962901647360 2016-12-29 03:42:16 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost This inauguration is going to be a sluggers' row of grifters and has beens. (Your favorite dignified person) will turn in his grave.

814602259845828608 2016-12-29 22:41:27 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden What state does this comrade "represent"?
814600775825584128 2016-12-29 22:35:34 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood Trump doesn't know what the word tranche means.  Someone should clarify.
814490950550638592 2016-12-29 15:19:09 UTC <gaughran444> @guardian I liked the world better with Bowie and Prince in it.
814489798379442177 2016-12-29 15:14:35 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage @IsaLeeWolf Glad it's Schneiderman doing it. He's one energetic guy.
814489575443853313 2016-12-29 15:13:41 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage @IsaLeeWolf I don't think anything will happen before 1/20, but there might be something significant when investigation is complete.

814344477099827201 2016-12-28 05:37:07 UTC <gaughran444> @fakedansavage @IsaLeeWolf The abrupt way these father and son dirtbags backed away from their "charities" suggests possible criminal activity. Stay tuned.
814343243487907841 2016-12-28 05:32:13 UTC <gaughran444> @YahooNews @EthanObama Not good.

814306987555033088 2016-12-28 03:08:09 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @greenhousenyt Epic schmuck.

814296519444668417 2016-12-28 02:26:33 UTC <gaughran444> @neeratanden That's one eloquent fellow.
814296289982775297 2016-12-28 02:25:39 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Don King? Is Trump trying to thoroughly degrade the office of the president or just doing what comes naturally?
814128524453879808 2016-12-28 15:19:00 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated No time like the present.

814126205595189249 2016-12-28 15:09:47 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @jamisonfoser Look at insider trading convictions. Lots of rich guys.
814125705130819585 2016-12-28 15:07:48 UTC <gaughran444> @politico @IrisL49 I think it is. Hope the ACLU is on this.
813971646088433665 2016-12-27 04:55:37 UTC <gaughran444> @KasiaMikurda Will he finish each tweet by saying "Thank you, Mr President!" ?
813960072762183681 2016-12-27 04:09:38 UTC <gaughran444> @HeerJeet Sad in a call 911 kind of way.
813959466882371585 2016-12-27 04:07:14 UTC <gaughran444> @rumpfshaker @JoyAnnReid Yes this seems like a pivotal moment in this crazy bastard's mental health profile.
813954954448764928 2016-12-27 03:49:18 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh I just hope he's not thanking a little orange mini-me tucked into bed beside him. Crazy bastard.
813953545103962112 2016-12-27 03:43:42 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood And then alarmingly thanks himself or the extra little orange man sitting next to him on the bed.
813952044012814346 2016-12-27 03:37:44 UTC <gaughran444> @Lawrence @SophieInCT We kind of know how that would work out.

813897653486518272 2016-12-27 00:01:36 UTC <gaughran444> @Die__Trying_ @mmpadellan @UglyGuy140 Given how that turned out they should know better.

813893626048708608 2016-12-27 23:45:36 UTC <gaughran444> @POTUS @davidaxelrod Of course.
813892769550893056 2016-12-27 23:42:12 UTC <gaughran444> @EricBoehlert He sure did. That part of the country didn't matter. Too black.
813884582735052800 2016-12-27 23:09:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @OccupyDemocrat1 Please!!!
813884453026230272 2016-12-27 23:09:09 UTC <gaughran444> @maggieNYT @SarahMaslinNir They should try some gold in that place. Jazz it up a bit.
813884132665200640 2016-12-27 23:07:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @OccupyDemocrat1 Good! Maybe some kind of executive clemency? Either way sounds like something serious is headed his way. The sooner the better!
813883255166476289 2016-12-27 23:04:23 UTC <gaughran444> @NavKaz @MrDanZak Can someone share this with the Orangutan?
813875332549840896 2016-12-27 22:32:55 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @OccupyDemocrat1 Not if it's a criminal matter he won't.
813872652762968064 2016-12-27 22:22:16 UTC <gaughran444> @RealClearNews @rebeccagberg I know nothing about criminal law but wonder about this.

813868355505557510 2016-12-27 22:05:11 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Please try to be dignified.
813860967545241600 2016-12-27 21:35:50 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie Why is it that some whites freak out when the word racism is used and others find it quite bearable?
813860738678870016 2016-12-27 21:34:55 UTC <gaughran444> @jbouie White panic at the use of the word racism does not need to be catered to. The truth hurts.
813860518704381953 2016-12-27 21:34:03 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @jwpetersNYT Wow, so this is your cause now? Good luck with that.
813860382615990273 2016-12-27 21:33:30 UTC <gaughran444> @nytimes @jwpetersNYT This was a badly written article with hopelessly sloppy logic, e.g.  the Mitt Romney analogy. Really poor work.

813858422932250625 2016-12-27 21:25:43 UTC <gaughran444> @NYDailyNews @KeithOlbermann But, hey, he was being "human."  A vile, racist human.
813858074222010370 2016-12-27 21:24:20 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid Yes he did. They didn't matter. And "identity politics" lost the race. That's the self-appointed progressive savior. No thank you.
813857277019115522 2016-12-27 21:21:10 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC Obama.  But he shouldn't say it.
813856796423155713 2016-12-27 21:19:15 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Oh! Well then that's perfectly fine. Leave this lovely man alone!
813817420892819457 2016-12-27 18:42:47 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 @EricBoehlert He discounted its importance. A dismissal that frankly had a racial tinge.
813816572879970304 2016-12-27 18:39:25 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @IrisL49 Mind-bending stupidity. From people who desperately need health insurance.
813816376171315200 2016-12-27 18:38:38 UTC <gaughran444> @TrueFactsStated Yes, every time someone good goes I think of that bastard still breathing.
813649675127582720 2016-12-26 07:36:14 UTC <gaughran444> @CNNPolitics Not Carter? Clinton? Is he going to paint pics of dogs and himself in the shower? Come on!
813584923261079552 2016-12-26 03:18:56 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Eric Schneiderman is going to nail you. Try putting your tweets in as evidence during the trial.
813580974164443136 2016-12-26 03:03:14 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @Pharaoh_Moses Yes, and if he'd put his back into supporting her instead of sulking and sniping. Petulant schmuck.
813580523398430720 2016-12-26 03:01:27 UTC <gaughran444> @deg2 @SoDSM4Hillary Yes. #nomandate #negativepoliticalcapital
813574480354299905 2016-12-26 02:37:26 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn Why is this self-congratulatory dick flapping his gums so much these days?
813573853385551877 2016-12-26 02:34:56 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur @aravosis Think he'd have been crushed.
813570952701284352 2016-12-26 02:23:25 UTC <gaughran444> @peterdaou Don't think that's true. Obama forcefully "defended" her during campaign. But I don't like him saying he'd have won. Immaterial and mean.
813570607354970112 2016-12-26 02:22:02 UTC <gaughran444> @riotwomennn People don't lose their marbles with syphilis any more do they?
813569960882696192 2016-12-26 02:19:28 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @riotwomennn Keep going AG Schneiderman! Orange Hitler is trying to hide evidence. Go get 'em!
813569385185087488 2016-12-26 02:17:11 UTC <gaughran444> @JohnJHarwood No more gloom! Except for the part where no one can have a full conversation about our new president without tears or rage.
813547668878327812 2016-12-26 00:50:53 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You have plunged more than half the country into despair.
813546726044954624 2016-12-26 00:47:09 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Same as it ever was.
813528918519115777 2016-12-26 23:36:23 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Do you know what the United Nations is? Are you confusing it with a restaurant?

813383088206135296 2016-12-26 13:56:54 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold As much of a philanthropist as he is a statesman.
813382752187940865 2016-12-26 13:55:34 UTC <gaughran444> @Danchrism And to you!
813381994860134400 2016-12-26 13:52:34 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 While trying to destroy evidence. Nifty!

812163067383574528 2016-12-22 05:08:59 UTC <gaughran444> @Bakari_Sellers Something about getting welfare checks delivered to an ivory tower. Man's gotta try one cliche at a time.

812047249563938817 2016-12-22 21:28:46 UTC <gaughran444> @IrisL49 Those were always so reassuring. Get under your school desk and if the country blows up you'll be just fine.

796187332009455617 2016-11-08 03:07:07 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 That's right and we are fighters too. It's not over.
796185680216997888 2016-11-08 03:00:33 UTC <gaughran444> @Luvvie @Marv_Vien Yes. That's what it is. FFS
796176324243161088 2016-11-08 02:23:22 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Seriously.
796153875808059392 2016-11-08 00:54:10 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT it's not every day you get to have a death mask on live tv. Networks can't resist.
796151386299924480 2016-11-08 00:44:16 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol And he can keep it.
796145371852509186 2016-11-08 00:20:22 UTC <gaughran444> @joanwalsh You missed nothing. Creepy liar.
796145113667948545 2016-11-08 00:19:21 UTC <gaughran444> @MSNBC @Neighbors4Hill Disgusting guy. Hope he disappears soon.
796144770334806016 2016-11-08 00:17:59 UTC <gaughran444> @MeetThePress @GilTPolitics Evidence is not his bag. Better to just accuse.
796144404415266816 2016-11-08 00:16:32 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT He's ghastly. But I thought Matthews hammered him pretty well.
796120972952739841 2016-11-08 22:43:25 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Don't miss tomorrow's point and laugh at Trump Tower event. Exciting!
796120777733107712 2016-11-08 22:42:39 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Looking for excuses for historic loss? Check one of your gilded mirrors.
796120536095092737 2016-11-08 22:41:41 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're going to be crushed. Farewell Orange Hitler.
796052824195039232 2016-11-08 18:12:37 UTC <gaughran444> @HardballChris You're not getting how dazzling it is for women and girls to vote for a woman. Dazzling.
796052504752558080 2016-11-08 18:11:21 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump You're losing Pumpkin Spice Hitler! Ciao!
795697861463834624 2016-11-07 18:42:08 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @JRubinBlogger Hypocritical cypher. He outmaneuvered himself. Still thinks he's a man of principle.
795697467547353088 2016-11-07 18:40:34 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich Keep beating this dead horse for what, ten years? Twenty?
795697033692717056 2016-11-07 18:38:50 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 Now you're talking!
795696860912558080 2016-11-07 18:38:09 UTC <gaughran444> @newtgingrich But didn't you love him last week?
795696623934468096 2016-11-07 18:37:13 UTC <gaughran444> @ananavarro Go Ana!!!!!!

795480291703930880 2016-11-06 04:17:35 UTC <gaughran444> @PaulBegala @kurtbardella Why should we care?
795476744740409344 2016-11-06 04:03:29 UTC <gaughran444> @jpodhoretz @jbarro Probably has fond memories of grabbing various parts of women as it played at parties.
795476288391757824 2016-11-06 04:01:41 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig @TomLlamasABC So hard to choose most disgusting moment of this election season but this is a strong contender.
795473937790550016 2016-11-06 03:52:20 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare @JeffersonObama I agree. Nate's covering his butt bc he screwed up Repub primaries and Dems primary in Michigan.
795459066646720512 2016-11-06 02:53:15 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan Stop! You've humiliated yourself enough.
795443091566170112 2016-11-06 01:49:46 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig Grim? Merriest thought of the day!
795443066903691264 2016-11-06 01:49:40 UTC <gaughran444> @jbarro Good point. Reasons to be cheerful.
795441088647593984 2016-11-06 01:41:48 UTC <gaughran444> @HillaryClinton @newtgingrich Is that a threat dough boy?
795440792617816066 2016-11-06 01:40:38 UTC <gaughran444> @colinjones Love LeBron. He should run for governor of Ohio when he retires. Seriously.
795439926909300737 2016-11-06 01:37:11 UTC <gaughran444> @CLewandowski_ Sure is and they're gonna kick Orange Hitler's ass off the map! Feel free to join him!
795422390889119745 2016-11-06 00:27:30 UTC <gaughran444> @CLewandowski_ @KatyTurNBC At least he didn't shove you out of the way like that other woman who made him mad.
795420727474262016 2016-11-06 00:20:54 UTC <gaughran444> @electionsmith @markmobility @GilTPolitics Can't wait!!!
795414998503849984 2016-11-06 23:58:08 UTC <gaughran444> @cdelbrocco @1stSvelteCelt Yup. 30 years of bullshit. But you can't keep a good woman down.
795414366107607040 2016-11-06 23:55:37 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Hey they're still letting you tweet! Lotta responsibility!
795414158338621440 2016-11-06 23:54:48 UTC <gaughran444> @Eugene_Robinson @PostRoz And not a peep as to why he put the country through this bs?
795413802804277248 2016-11-06 23:53:23 UTC <gaughran444> @ron_fournier @JoeNBC @HillaryClinton @Milbank @mattzap Wow. Delusional.
795412741947322368 2016-11-06 23:49:10 UTC <gaughran444> @BJHare Where's the apology for all this bullshit?
795412396223463424 2016-11-06 23:47:47 UTC <gaughran444> @maddow @KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @Neighbors4Hill While she's at it should grab his mantan.
795412079322787845 2016-11-06 23:46:32 UTC <gaughran444> @markmobility @GilTPolitics @electionsmith The very people who Trump abused - Latinos, blacks & women - will kick his orange ass off the map
795287895905075200 2016-11-06 15:33:04 UTC <gaughran444> @KatyTurNBC @CLewandowski_ You're a tiny footnote in history dude. Don't flatter yourself.
795274841507110914 2016-11-06 14:41:12 UTC <gaughran444> @NPRWeekend @nprpolitics Hint: we're voting for a really smart blonde lady with lots of stamina.
795274114235858944 2016-11-06 14:38:18 UTC <gaughran444> @CLewandowski_ Do you disappear too on 11/9? Please say yes.
795268622780403712 2016-11-06 14:16:29 UTC <gaughran444> @cajunsmiley @Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Orange pussies.
795267769239478272 2016-11-06 14:13:06 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence No not even cardboard signs can stop these fearless heroes! That was a close one!
795266451573800960 2016-11-06 14:07:52 UTC <gaughran444> @jaketapper Okay "certain group" kick that orange ass off the map!
795266152247259136 2016-11-06 14:06:40 UTC <gaughran444> @GilTPolitics @SebastianMurdoc Yes he does! False idols. Walls. Thanks Papa!
795264812427124736 2016-11-06 14:01:21 UTC <gaughran444> @WTFAROUT Sure is.
795263954335518720 2016-11-06 13:57:56 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @WDFx2EU8 @POTUS @HillaryClinton They're so desperate for Orange Hitler to be a hero. Ain't happening.
795263430932447237 2016-11-06 13:55:51 UTC <gaughran444> @Neighbors4Hill @VABVOX She may not be familiar with whole 50 state concept.
795263183753805825 2016-11-06 13:54:52 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @Vva10967 @EricBoehlert @HardballChris A lot of white people can't accept that racism drives Trump's success. Don't get it.
795262471745454080 2016-11-06 13:52:03 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm Orange Pussy will probably wear a bullet proof vest for the rest of his life. Even in his cool gold plated apartment.
795261399480078336 2016-11-06 13:47:47 UTC <gaughran444> @chrislhayes @TPM Kind word for it.
795261165085556736 2016-11-06 13:46:51 UTC <gaughran444> @HuffPostPol Jay uses words like "evolve." Orange Hitler gets confused and cranky.
795261110681268224 2016-11-06 13:46:38 UTC <gaughran444> @washingtonpost @spulliam He's talking about Trump. Pure and simple.
795194077327278081 2016-11-06 09:20:16 UTC <gaughran444> @MichaelSalfino @BJHare Because he's wrong. He blew republican primaries, minimized Trump's initial chances and is now covering himself.
795193450719301632 2016-11-06 09:17:47 UTC <gaughran444> @BenMargiott Our long national nightmare is over.
795123864929992705 2016-11-05 04:41:16 UTC <gaughran444> @lesliermyers check the polls. Most Catholics are against trump. Including the pope.
795121374415192064 2016-11-05 04:31:22 UTC <gaughran444> @ezlusztig Some of us are.
795121102922072064 2016-11-05 04:30:18 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews @DonCheadle Dignity v depravity. The best v the worst.
795119888243294208 2016-11-05 04:25:28 UTC <gaughran444> @burdentruth @GilTPolitics @AJDelgado13 Tough guy faced down a sign. Like a boss!
795115091465211904 2016-11-05 04:06:24 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 I guess their attitude towards guns is same as toward military service. Talk tough and let other people deal with it.
795110244825362432 2016-11-05 03:47:09 UTC <gaughran444> @JSavoly @lesliermyers Is this true? Please yes.

795108461365366784 2016-11-05 03:40:04 UTC <gaughran444> @ABCPolitics @joshtpm Yeah it's called democracy.
795108146524147712 2016-11-05 03:38:49 UTC <gaughran444> @NPR okay it's not the zapruder tape.  Enough already.
795103034904899584 2016-11-05 03:18:30 UTC <gaughran444> @MrDane1982 @surfermom77 No worries Sophia! You listen to the music you like and then come on down and vote on 11/28. Yee-haw!
795102248900685828 2016-11-05 03:15:23 UTC <gaughran444> @emigre80 @AUkeibro @Bencjacobs He doesn't know too much. Maybe he thinks they're not allowed to vote.
795101111594217472 2016-11-05 03:10:51 UTC <gaughran444> @joshtpm @Averre13 Saw that. Can't someone take his phone away?
795099161955811334 2016-11-05 03:03:07 UTC <gaughran444> @Khanoisseur Hillary like a boss. And then there's Bonespur Boy.
795096029242789888 2016-11-05 02:50:40 UTC <gaughran444> @JoyAnnReid @AUkeibro @samsteinhp Bonespur Boy has no respect for military service.
795095307902128128 2016-11-05 02:47:48 UTC <gaughran444> @SheWhoVotes @ditzkoff But yes let no one touch a hair on his orange his head. Just vote him off the map.
795095086887501824 2016-11-05 02:46:55 UTC <gaughran444> @SheWhoVotes @ditzkoff He was in no danger and now his lowlife sons are tweeting about an assassination attempt.
795093258787581954 2016-11-05 02:39:39 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC @mviser Desperate for some macho creds. Pathetic.
795093095276810245 2016-11-05 02:39:00 UTC <gaughran444> @SalHernandez @OkiesForHillary Sorry mofo. It's their country too.
795092835292868608 2016-11-05 02:37:58 UTC <gaughran444> @DavidCornDC @brianstelter @KevinBohnCNN Yes! Meanwhile, all those tough second amendment guys looked pretty jumpy.
795091597167837185 2016-11-05 02:33:03 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Heard you got hustled off the stage because someone had a sign! Tough fellow!
795091284239253504 2016-11-05 02:31:48 UTC <gaughran444> @steveschale Let's revisit some of these assumptions on 11/9.
795091057201545216 2016-11-05 02:30:54 UTC <gaughran444> @JuddApatow @neeratanden @CNN Rather talk about Jay-Z lyrics than the dribble coming out of Herr Trump's mouth any day.
795090630187876352 2016-11-05 02:29:12 UTC <gaughran444> @JRMiddleman @Lee_in_Iowa @Bencjacobs All those brave Second Amendment guys sure are jumpy.
795077135971008512 2016-11-05 01:35:35 UTC <gaughran444> @CNN @jaketapper Bravest dude ever!!!
795076744495644672 2016-11-05 01:34:02 UTC <gaughran444> @Bencjacobs @KatyTurNBC Was Orange Hitler attacked by a reporter?
795076396947308545 2016-11-05 01:32:39 UTC <gaughran444> God forbid anyone touch a hair on Trump's head before 11/9. He needs to be defeated fair and square.
795074855054012416 2016-11-05 01:26:31 UTC <gaughran444> @YouTube And here's our tough broad when the secret service rush the stage. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XDI6wWhlK0&sns=tw via @youtube

795060729598636032 2016-11-05 00:30:24 UTC <gaughran444> @PRyan You voted for Orange Hitler to get our country back in track? I dare you to say that on national tv. And use the bastard's name.
795059792280776705 2016-11-05 00:26:40 UTC <gaughran444> @SophieInCT @EastwoodUSA Clint chill. Wrong race to weigh in on. Let it go.
795059038778261508 2016-11-05 00:23:40 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump Nevada is going to kick your orange ass off the map! Enjoy!
795058567300743173 2016-11-05 00:21:48 UTC <gaughran444> @realDonaldTrump @politico Yeah Jay uses words like "evolve" that Pumpkin Spice Hitler has never heard. Makes him cranky.
795057556825772032 2016-11-05 00:17:47 UTC <gaughran444> 2016 - Latinos kick that orange ass off the map!

795054555075592193 2016-11-05 00:05:51 UTC <gaughran444> @politico Orange jumpsuits are slimming.
795054256151785473 2016-11-05 00:04:40 UTC <gaughran444> @AdamParkhomenko @WTFAROUT I'm feeling damned enthusiastic about this girl. Can't wait for 11/8!!!
795054028153556992 2016-11-05 00:03:46 UTC <gaughran444> @nowthisnews @MrDane1982 Meanwhile Orange Hitler complains about Jay's language. Someone should ask him what the word "evolved" means.
795053724188241920 2016-11-05 00:02:33 UTC <gaughran444> @aravosis @WTFAROUT Why does everyone look so excited lining up to kick his orange ass off the map? They look might enthusiastic to me.
