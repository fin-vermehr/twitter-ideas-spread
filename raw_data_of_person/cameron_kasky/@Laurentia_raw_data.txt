971498680988479488 2018-03-07 21:31:49 UTC <Laurentia> @joerogan Hey Joe, have you ever interviewed Lael Wilcox? She is a cyclist and actually won the @TransAmBikeRace in 2016. She is amazing.https://laelwilcox.com/
971429255367151616 2018-03-07 16:55:57 UTC <Laurentia> How awful Homeland InSecurity has become. This is the sort of thing we condemn other countries for doing.https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/971132358773694469
971053909253894144 2018-03-06 16:04:27 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump This is the exact opposite direction we should be headed in.
969412633790001152 2018-03-01 03:22:37 UTC <Laurentia> @kurteichenwald This sounds like the plot to "This must be the place."
969411756064845824 2018-03-01 03:19:08 UTC <Laurentia> @jordanbpeterson Thanks for the sanity.
966417513129984001 2018-02-21 21:01:04 UTC <Laurentia> There are enough high school students graduating this year, that turn 18 before the next election, to change the outcome in nearly every precinct if they all decided to vote. #TimesUp #JusticeForAll #KidLivesMatter #NextGenerationBestGeneration
954107971750866944 2018-01-18 21:47:21 UTC <Laurentia> We have moved from Fireside Chats that reassure the country to Poop Tweets that send the country into chaos.  #ContinuedAssault #DumbDonald #IAmExhausted #FakePresident
952221460604440576 2018-01-13 16:51:02 UTC <Laurentia> Dear World, I am horrified too. #dumbdonald #racistshithole #timeforanewpresident #Tulsi2020

944347400411365378 2017-12-22 23:22:20 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump It is not the biggest in history. Read a book now and then.
939868277223841792 2017-12-10 14:43:53 UTC <Laurentia> @patagonia @NatResources So selling it off to get drilled and spoiled is good for me? You are lying. You just want the money for yourself.
935718223533576193 2017-11-28 03:53:03 UTC <Laurentia> @MichaelPhelps That's great, but if you skip meat you could leave the shower on all day and save more.
933081752813236224 2017-11-21 21:16:40 UTC <Laurentia> Certainly, there are women that take advantage and sexually harass. When will those victims speak out?   Positions of power have traditionally been men, but women are making strides in all areas, including sexually harassing other humans. #NotAlwaysMen

918543293130010625 2017-10-12 18:26:01 UTC <Laurentia> The Vonnegut-esque world unfolding would be a hoot if only a novel. Dystopia tweets into existence while fire, water, & wind await locusts.
912395272344313856 2017-09-25 19:15:59 UTC <Laurentia> Damn you 45 and your hate speech. Now I have to start watching sports. #takingaknee #freespeech #middlefingertopower
910675385095880704 2017-09-20 01:21:45 UTC <Laurentia> So did I hear the idiot-in-chief correctly? A soverign country: Venezuela, adopting socialism, is enough reason for us to attack them? #fuck
910384132169125888 2017-09-19 06:04:25 UTC <Laurentia> Thank you Jimmy Kimmel! #HealthcareIsAHumanRight
909932610264088576 2017-09-18 00:10:14 UTC <Laurentia> You were so patient with @dpakman. How hard is it to understand: Women IN GENERAL don't flock to tech because it isn't social. @JamesADamore
909440615389077504 2017-09-17 15:35:13 UTC <Laurentia> Read the Google Document. Women need to get their panties un-wadded. It is not sexism that women do not stick in tech. It is a lonely job.
907757768714489856 2017-09-12 00:08:12 UTC <Laurentia> Fair time in my town. The park is full of carnival transients. Did they run away and join the carnival instead of the circus? No clowns!

898369384862818304 2017-08-17 02:22:06 UTC <Laurentia> Dog of an old man friend showed in my yard. Raw neck showed collar rubbed off. Where is old man? I already miss owning his dog, he's alive.

872537136414695424 2017-06-07 19:33:58 UTC <Laurentia> Biked to the river, hit the splash pad and am now watching a couple pushing 80 sell a fifth wheel to a couple pushing 50. #oldVSnewdreams

857735178508156928 2017-04-27 23:16:17 UTC <Laurentia> Just because it can be commoditized, does not mean it should be. Making money on misery is immoral. #Share #Kindness #Compassion #LoveOthers

851086799736668164 2017-04-09 14:58:00 UTC <Laurentia> @SenSanders Do we have proof of who actually did it?
851086515954307073 2017-04-09 14:56:52 UTC <Laurentia> @ALT_uscis @FBI @realDonaldTrump @realnavyveteran Ridiculous. The bar for terrorism is getting pretty low if tweeting is terrorism. That bar Tiny Hands leaps over daily. #snowflakes
850362690887311361 2017-04-07 15:00:39 UTC <Laurentia> Look at all the pro-missile boners popping up all over. When ratings go low, we bomb from on high. #BombBoners #RatingsBooster #WrongSteps

847897457379876864 2017-03-31 19:44:41 UTC <Laurentia> Thanks, @TulsiGabbard , this is long overdue. Also, thank you for your support of #HR676https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/847858307897446400
847484135819976704 2017-03-30 16:22:18 UTC <Laurentia> Had an amazing dream last night where I woke up from a nightmare and instead of Tiny Hands, Bernie was the president. Then I woke up. Damn.

842755914453078016 2017-03-17 15:14:02 UTC <Laurentia> The budget proposal is another way that it seems 45 is trying to get kicked out of the job. What's a guy gotta do to get fired around here?

840466598913753088 2017-03-10 07:37:06 UTC <Laurentia> On the sunniest day in months, my county declared itself a disaster area. Inches of rain on soggy ground has hillsides slipping onto roads.
840415831037161472 2017-03-10 04:15:22 UTC <Laurentia> My state is deeply red. Most races don't even have a choice. Even so, 51% of registered voters are unaffiliated. Waiting for change. #Idaho
840366119093325824 2017-03-10 00:57:50 UTC <Laurentia> @KeithOlbermann Hillary lost fair and square even with trying to rig the vote. She was a deeply flawed candidate with no platform.
840274395562037248 2017-03-10 18:53:22 UTC <Laurentia> @JoshMalina Have watched it beginning to end three times. I long for a time when the WH will look out for the country, not just themselves.
839890749709672448 2017-03-09 17:28:53 UTC <Laurentia> Up until the day the earth shatters like a dropped glass ball from being fracked, oil companies can point to their great shareholder value.
839876224641978368 2017-03-09 16:31:10 UTC <Laurentia> The Larson Ice shelf crack will release an iceberg the size of Delaware. That could lead to sea level rise of 15 feet. Goodbye Mar A Lago.
839712213933817856 2017-03-08 05:39:27 UTC <Laurentia> Why does it seem like all the GOP actions in the past two months are mean or out of spite? Their rich are pretty rich already. #TheRestOfUs

838876053762277376 2017-03-06 22:16:51 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump As a gesture of good will, produce your products here. All those American jobs you have sent to China,Mexico,India, Turkey.
837915366894424066 2017-03-03 06:39:25 UTC <Laurentia> Science is not the enemy, we use it every min. And so do corporations. Why is science only wrong when is might cut into profits? #cleanwater
837838625127579652 2017-03-03 01:34:29 UTC <Laurentia> For all my outrage, calling my senators, tweeting, and marching; I would be doing the same had the other horrible option won. #thirdway
837805131332661248 2017-03-03 23:21:23 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump There are enough Republicans to approve them all. What is their holdup? Of course, the Dems oppose them, they are horrible.
837720554329133056 2017-03-03 17:45:18 UTC <Laurentia> Sun is shining. We survived Nixon and Reagan, Clinton and W. This too shall pass. (fuck fuckety fuck) Breath in, breath out. Plant garden.
837539214711410693 2017-03-02 05:44:44 UTC <Laurentia> I hope the White House reporters were able to get the espresso machine Tom Hanks sent over working. They are really going to need it. #Rusky
837538078054985728 2017-03-02 05:40:13 UTC <Laurentia> The joy of a baby giraffe birth impending is an odd juxtaposition to a presidency in turmoil. I miss the old days when politics was boring.
837416044633321472 2017-03-02 21:35:18 UTC <Laurentia> I am skeptical of anyone who says they KNOW, Believe me. Show how based on current knowledge, this is a good option; remain open for better.
837348257596526592 2017-03-02 17:05:56 UTC <Laurentia> "I did not have communications with the Russians" sounds like "I did not have sex with that woman"; except with treason instead of a boner.
837195168562331648 2017-03-01 06:57:37 UTC <Laurentia> @neicolec exactly, the controversy was already in full swing. The smart choice would be to head it off at the pass, not try to ignore it.
837193322095521792 2017-03-01 06:50:16 UTC <Laurentia> Why wouldn't he just say during the hearings: I met them in my capacity as a member of Armed Services Committee. Instead I never met anyone?
837192845932941316 2017-03-01 06:48:23 UTC <Laurentia> Okay. Back to screaming into my pillow. Who is running the country? If he can't remember, he is an idiot. If he lied, well hell, who isn't.
837056561889476609 2017-03-01 21:46:50 UTC <Laurentia> Hysterical. Mike Pence as the source of the white house leaks. First time I every laughed with Hardball. He does have the motive.
837052592970579968 2017-03-01 21:31:04 UTC <Laurentia> Fighting against my own prejudices. On most topics people more learned than I have weighed in. Learning prior rebuttal is rational but rare.
837046395961925632 2017-03-01 21:06:27 UTC <Laurentia> Once you are sure you know, your mind begins to close and alternative ideas can't get in. Use the best info you have, but remain skeptical.
837045865562845184 2017-03-01 21:04:20 UTC <Laurentia> Every day presents an opportunity to learn more effective methods for life. Continue to question, it keeps minds from stagnating, settling.
837045081307635713 2017-03-01 21:01:13 UTC <Laurentia> Lack of experience is not a problem if you ask for help and study history. Willful ignorance, fear, and wishful thinking is bad policy.
837044520663408641 2017-03-01 20:58:59 UTC <Laurentia> Why don't we learn? We keep falling back on policy that doesn't work. We have the statistics to see what does work. Helps the most people.
837043821036761088 2017-03-01 20:56:13 UTC <Laurentia> Increasing defense spending is not money spent on helping ordinary US Citizens. We are already over the top everywhere. Spend it on schools.
837042581707972608 2017-03-01 20:51:17 UTC <Laurentia> Tucker Carlson should spend his fake outrage on something real. If he would read a science book now and then, he might be able to follow.
837042000356495360 2017-03-01 20:48:59 UTC <Laurentia> After a month of screaming into my pillow daily, I shouldn't be surprised that his reviews are glowing. He can actually read, stay on task.
837038534066221057 2017-03-01 20:35:12 UTC <Laurentia> Just watched the congressional address with Bennie Hill music playing. It was way less scary, more entertaining. His speaking raises my ire.
837037227678957568 2017-03-01 20:30:01 UTC <Laurentia> Going to eat as many fresh veggies as I can & going to grow my own this year. Missing immigrants means fields go unharvested & prices go up.
837036632716935169 2017-03-01 20:27:39 UTC <Laurentia> Not only is language a living breathing thing, so does the body of knowledge it explains. As such, learning should be continuous. You too.
837031859640909824 2017-03-01 20:08:41 UTC <Laurentia> What passes for a profound experience for you might be blase to me and vice versa. So let's start with the tangible we can agree on first.
837031025347706880 2017-03-01 20:05:22 UTC <Laurentia> Come on, spit out that baby giraffe April. I need the oohs and awws and the distraction. It will be good for my Trump Anxiety Disorder.
837028133131821056 2017-03-01 19:53:52 UTC <Laurentia> More military spending. Where is the next war? Is that is his plan to put Americans back to work? Military contracts and more soldiers.
837027433014427648 2017-03-01 19:51:05 UTC <Laurentia> America First. That includes US, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama... In North America. Get it right.
837026719546535937 2017-03-01 19:48:15 UTC <Laurentia> No specifics on anything. His slight of tongue on using "American" pipe for pipelines. Don't look too close, Canada is in America. Psyche!
837025808975724545 2017-03-01 19:44:38 UTC <Laurentia> Construction of a Great Wall. Fuck that. I expect more for 30 Billion dollars. How about a department that tracks crime against immigrants?
837013943943999488 2017-03-01 18:57:29 UTC <Laurentia> What I heard from the speech last night is: "I am going raise the deficit so much, Reagan would be proud. But be sure to be very afraid."
837010022181679104 2017-03-01 18:41:54 UTC <Laurentia> Purchasing health insurance across state lines requires a national policy on health care. If we are going national, why not single payer?
837009356923125760 2017-03-01 18:39:16 UTC <Laurentia> Protecting all Americans from universal healthcare is a horrible policy. With single payer, we could increase military for free. Read More.
837008881112895490 2017-03-01 18:37:22 UTC <Laurentia> The constant fear based rhetoric is exhausting. It is also misleading if not complete lies. He is counting on no fact checking, he didn't.
837007984928538624 2017-03-01 18:33:49 UTC <Laurentia> This country is going to need universal health care. T.A.D. is starting to spread through the populace, it saps energy & hope, closes minds.
837005712492392448 2017-03-01 18:24:47 UTC <Laurentia> Whenever anyone says they have all the answers my hair stands on end. That stance closes you off to new information. Like science and facts.
836996324427911168 2017-03-01 17:47:29 UTC <Laurentia> Can't get anything done now, hanging on for dear life: Up is down, hate is love, ignorant is educated, lies become policy & facts are fake.
835685456683544576 2017-02-25 02:58:33 UTC <Laurentia> Was waiting to see if the Democrats would lead, it turns out: No. Saved from wasting a donation. I guess more for a local issue. #Demexit

834650913360928769 2017-02-22 06:27:39 UTC <Laurentia> Clarence, bring back George Bailey.  I don't like Trumpersville. The air is brown and so is the water. Mr.Potter teamed up with Mr. Burns.

834215868586299392 2017-02-21 01:38:56 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump We are still Americans, remember us, the 81% of the country that did not vote for you. We get representation, redress, too.
833875043742470144 2017-02-20 03:04:37 UTC <Laurentia> @SallyAlbright No Pipelines, No Fracking. Time for a clean future.
833520402513031169 2017-02-19 03:35:24 UTC <Laurentia> Playing it safe. Not taking risks, not following wild dreams; it weakens your soul, body. Joy, excitement,   surprise foils cancer, vivifys.
833020716651999232 2017-02-18 18:29:50 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump These small groups are getting bigger. And louder with a passion for our great country. They have lots to protest. Thanks.
833019134887616512 2017-02-18 18:23:33 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump MEDICARE FOR ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
833018062601285632 2017-02-18 18:19:17 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Cities w/higher immigrant population have less violence. Natural Born citizens have a higher rate of violence. Get it right
833017112113274880 2017-02-18 18:15:30 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Our in your case a corrupt outsider who doesn't believe in science. Shame.
833013975944040448 2017-02-18 18:03:03 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Is DTS "Donald Trump's Swamp". The swamp is getting scarier by the day.
832719567352852483 2017-02-17 22:33:10 UTC <Laurentia> @PressSec Now, I want to believe you, but you guys have a history of #Alternativefacts

832393896881577984 2017-02-16 00:59:04 UTC <Laurentia> So let me get this straight: fake news was leaked from the white house? We need to find the leakers of this fake news? #WTF #Idiocracy
831628440025444352 2017-02-14 22:17:25 UTC <Laurentia> Sitting with a bag of popcorn watching 45's new reality show called "America". Even Shondaland couldn't invent such a perverted plot line.
831546825140080643 2017-02-14 16:53:07 UTC <Laurentia> The first domino just fell in the shitty game of democracy the 45 group is playing. Flynn flouted, pimped out Pence. Very "un-presidented".
831528384341569537 2017-02-14 15:39:50 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump try having top secret meeting in secret instead of the lobby of your motel.

828988886722293760 2017-02-07 15:28:47 UTC <Laurentia> Now it feels like he has moved on to. "What does a guy have to do to get impeached around here?" Constant insane rants, divisive, crazy.https://twitter.com/Laurentia/status/809121372613902336

827711405579132928 2017-02-03 02:52:31 UTC <Laurentia> Neither the National Endowment for the Arts nor National Public Radio is getting children killed in America's name. #budgetpriorites
827710544593293312 2017-02-03 02:49:06 UTC <Laurentia> They lose a $75 million aircraft in a botched raid in Yemen, and turn around and call the National Endowment for the Arts a budget killer.
827601701846683648 2017-02-03 19:36:36 UTC <Laurentia> @chrislhayes It appears as though they are counting on it.
827564958133006336 2017-02-03 17:10:36 UTC <Laurentia> @elonmusk Thank you. There needs to be a smarter forward perspective brought to the president. He can't only hear from the alt-right. #Help
826663293829787650 2017-01-31 05:27:42 UTC <Laurentia> It is starting to feel like The Shock Doctrine meets Vulture Capitalism. Time to get some new marching shoes. #NoBanNoWall #SavePublicLands
826464126264184832 2017-01-31 16:16:17 UTC <Laurentia> Good scary read:https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/how-to-build-an-autocracy/513872/
825451437320609792 2017-01-28 21:12:13 UTC <Laurentia> Divisive hatred is cancer in the Body Human. Left unchecked, it will kill the host. There is no "Them". Only Us. Choose Life, choose love.
824504357118828545 2017-01-25 06:28:51 UTC <Laurentia> I'm another fat lady marching again soon. Let's see, Science March, I'm there. Release Your Tax Returns March - Check. #ThanksTrump #Resist

821647415610658816 2017-01-18 09:16:24 UTC <Laurentia> The news comes hot and heavy these days but come on. The editing is atrocious. Typos, extra words - In the headline! Have you no pride?
820360522449072128 2017-01-14 20:02:44 UTC <Laurentia> So easy to #PealTheOrange - just say something he doesn't like and clang, clang, clang! Off it goes on a monotone, petulant, gullible rant.
820358877883473920 2017-01-14 19:56:12 UTC <Laurentia> I make myself laugh. Silly thoughts in my brain. Casual connections between disparate things causing mirth from absurdity. Peal the Orange!
820357480072888320 2017-01-14 19:50:39 UTC <Laurentia> Who will speak 4 fat programmers sitting on their bed in the glow of a computer looking 4 sanity in the chaos of the internet? #Indivisible
820356149182537728 2017-01-14 19:45:22 UTC <Laurentia> They came 4 Meryl, I was silent. They came 4 Buzzfeed-I was quiet. Then came CNN, I spoke not. When only Trump approved fake news remains...

820301153862696960 2017-01-14 16:06:50 UTC <Laurentia> They were worried about 'safety'. The safety of their big donations. Hypocrites.https://twitter.com/herbaliciousCA/status/819706408656453632
820298695027503104 2017-01-14 15:57:03 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Prove it, release your tax returns.
820104012909277185 2017-01-13 03:03:28 UTC <Laurentia> Started a workout routine today. After months of relative sloth and self-recrimination, I pulled out the kettlebell and went to town. #gasp
820095208318595073 2017-01-13 02:28:28 UTC <Laurentia> James Brown stuck in my head lead me to sing joyously loud at every alone moment all last week. I'm stronger & more motivated now.#IFeelGood

819776297379340289 2017-01-12 05:21:14 UTC <Laurentia> I keep singing to myself, out loud and joyful, whenever it won't bug someone else. And I'll be a monkey's uncle - I feel stronger, happier.
819385715591024640 2017-01-11 03:29:12 UTC <Laurentia> Putting on a bra in the morning makes me feel ready to tackle the day. But, oh baby; the shear joy of its removal at days end. #BraFreeBoobs
819246748753235968 2017-01-11 18:17:00 UTC <Laurentia> I have heard it before and will repeat it again now: The joy of a Trump presidency is an engaged and activated population. #indivisible
818992395417108481 2017-01-10 01:26:17 UTC <Laurentia> Today, driving in sloppy, cold winter weather, I was blessed repeated by the gods of green lights. Thanks for the traction green lights!
818109542881841152 2017-01-08 14:58:09 UTC <Laurentia> Made my first ever sweet potato pie. It was yummy. I surprised myself.
817850984550436864 2017-01-07 21:50:44 UTC <Laurentia> Driving to an appt in another town, I saw plowed bike paths. Even in fourteen-degree weather, I was wishing I had my bike w/me. #BikepeDiem
817845105272836097 2017-01-07 21:27:22 UTC <Laurentia> Woke up extra happy today & every time I think about it I get an extra jolt of joy. So happy I think I will make a pie for my man. #PieHappy
816782106181320704 2017-01-04 23:03:23 UTC <Laurentia> So, the women of Kentucky are only supposed to have sex if they want to get pregnant. Lysistrata can suggest an appropriate protest method.
816777869229555712 2017-01-04 22:46:33 UTC <Laurentia> In spite of the luxury of holiday sloth, I am rather thankful to be getting back to the routine of my job. My mind enjoys the distraction.
815711750926397440 2017-01-01 00:10:11 UTC <Laurentia> Sort of wish I had made resolutions last night. In spite of my choice, I would have something tangible to rebel against now. #AntiAnything
814173074459267073 2016-12-28 18:16:02 UTC <Laurentia> Me too, Loud and proud. I am a Cuck. I feel the Bern. I want equality 4 all, Black Lives Matter, #NoDapl. I own it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHM6HtPuVxs
813560101533413376 2016-12-26 01:40:18 UTC <Laurentia> I love my family and enjoy their company. But family gatherings are exhausting for my introvert side. Glad that I went, so glad to be home.
811041385226772480 2016-12-19 02:51:49 UTC <Laurentia> @ideaasgandhii God comes to every man in the way that works for both of them. There can only be one religion, per person.
810622090252533760 2016-12-18 23:05:41 UTC <Laurentia> Privatizing government services just puts a layer of billionaires between the taxpayer and the service. Insurance companies produce nothing.
810619635460698113 2016-12-18 22:55:56 UTC <Laurentia> @elonmusk Watch out for fracking holes.
810619350357049344 2016-12-18 22:54:48 UTC <Laurentia> So, I am guessing it will take an alien attack of Star Fleet proportions to bring this planet together and realize we are all one. #AllLife
810616898727583744 2016-12-18 22:45:03 UTC <Laurentia> It greed wasn't the predominant business model, the planet could be thriving now, with everyone doing well. Oh well, the stock market is up.
810582317412585472 2016-12-18 20:27:39 UTC <Laurentia> Evergreens were used to symbolize eternal life & tree worship common among the pagan Europeans. Christianity usurped trees to lure pagans.
810579707318206466 2016-12-18 20:17:16 UTC <Laurentia> When I was in college, a job selling shoes in the mall came with vacation days, health insurance and sick days. And paid more than minimum.
810578680305111045 2016-12-18 20:13:11 UTC <Laurentia> In 1976, minimum wage paid my tuition, books, rent, and food at a University. Still had enough left over to drink my way into weekend comas.
810577693368602624 2016-12-18 20:09:16 UTC <Laurentia> If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as tuition has since I was in college, it would be $37/hour now. I could educate myself.
810575937033093122 2016-12-18 20:02:17 UTC <Laurentia> A bigger boat is a better choice for a billionaire than drinkable water for the planet. Nestle can't wait till they are the only source.
810575231240781825 2016-12-18 19:59:29 UTC <Laurentia> Instead of spending billions to continue dying industries, multinationals could change to people positive policies; benefit mankind's future
810574216110239744 2016-12-18 19:55:27 UTC <Laurentia> Doing right by the planet would create so many jobs, Corporations could be beloved and still make lots of money. Just not obscene amounts.
810537665313513472 2016-12-18 17:30:13 UTC <Laurentia> I don't understand corporate think. There is so much money to be made doing the right thing: Taking care of workers and world. Why fight it?
809220909919653888 2016-12-14 02:17:54 UTC <Laurentia> If anti-abortion is truly the goal, instead of shame posters in the bathroom, have free condoms and spermicide!!https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/oklahoma-just-passed-law-requiring-private-businesses-turn-their-bathrooms
809124586348363776 2016-12-14 19:55:08 UTC <Laurentia> Cabinet members with "Oops" for brains, open hostility and clear conflicts of interest with the Dept. they are nominated for. #YoureFired
809123435209101312 2016-12-14 19:50:34 UTC <Laurentia> Now that the election is over & Trump seemed surprised to win; his conflicts and cabinet look like he is trying to get someone to fire him.
809121372613902336 2016-12-14 19:42:22 UTC <Laurentia> Watching the election I got the feeling that Trump had to wonder, "What the hell does a guy have to do to lose an election around here?"
809059001728012289 2016-12-14 15:34:32 UTC <Laurentia> They know what happens! HAHAHA!https://twitter.com/neontrotsky/status/807467468142755841
805721002336362496 2016-12-05 10:30:31 UTC <Laurentia> I am in the midst of a marathon of Gilmore Girls. There is some serious avoidance going on, obviously. Not sure what I am avoiding. Myself?
805649352114905088 2016-12-04 05:45:48 UTC <Laurentia> With expanding waistline; I proclaim my joy for banana cream pie. Constant stirring: the custard delectable. Time for bike trainer sessions.

803684490543407104 2016-11-29 19:38:08 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump You obviously have no idea what 'landslide' means. Have someone look it up for you.
803683842011721728 2016-11-29 19:35:34 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Have you heard of the constitution? Have someone read it to you.
803114871139102720 2016-11-27 05:54:41 UTC <Laurentia> @realDonaldTrump Do you know what "Landslide" means? How about "Legal"?
801120848467742720 2016-11-22 17:51:09 UTC <Laurentia> What excites me about the Orange Menace is the new art and music that will be inspired. The new Woody Guthrie is tuning up. #WeShallOvercome
796228457956970498 2016-11-08 05:50:32 UTC <Laurentia> The deplorables have spoken. Dumb is the new smart. The uneducated love deficits, corporate welfare, and a big middle finger from the 1%.
795429979022508032 2016-11-06 00:57:40 UTC <Laurentia> Memorial for a musician is a rocking time. Rednecks can really hoedown. Harmonica and a foot stomping beat. Dance baby dance. #RestInPeace
795032000138596353 2016-11-05 22:36:14 UTC <Laurentia> This day felt blessed. I know, I know, they all are; but some just feel shinier and more joyful. I guess I am feeling groovy. Sunny, funny.
794106514847866880 2016-11-03 09:18:41 UTC <Laurentia> I sneeze and sneeze. The air I breath is active with pepper. The rice was awesome but I sneeze and sneeze. More soy and pepper and sneezing.
794096739825262592 2016-11-03 08:39:51 UTC <Laurentia> Who am I embarrassed by in my life? And why? The people who love me have been my greatest ally. And yet somehow, moving beyond is painful.
794095366664617984 2016-11-03 08:34:23 UTC <Laurentia> @howto Knee deep in a brandy bottle. Delusions abound, smoke, watch a movie, contemplate navel, wonder of the future. Art needs to be made. @HowTo
794085663431868416 2016-11-03 07:55:50 UTC <Laurentia> So, I am making art again. It has been some years since I was the 'girl about town'. I have different tastes, different methods. #DoItNow
793970982583078912 2016-11-02 00:20:08 UTC <Laurentia> All morning while working, every peep outside showed clouds and gloom. Then as I got ready to errand, the sun bloomed and I biked instead.
793908189850808320 2016-11-02 20:10:37 UTC <Laurentia> I love my job, I love my job. I love my job. I love my job. I love my job, love my job, love my job. I love my job. Yes, I love my job.
793707141618016256 2016-11-01 06:51:43 UTC <Laurentia> One last moment of mindful breathing before heading to bed. The bed has new sheets, a cause for presence and joy. Taut, thick, fresh, cozy.
793681753235857408 2016-11-01 05:10:50 UTC <Laurentia> Is it possible to learn to write well in one hundred-forty character increments?  Are edits made to fit made for clarity or merely brevity?
793680245488427008 2016-11-01 05:04:51 UTC <Laurentia> As I sit here tweeting nonsense, Youtube is continuously feeding me new political pundit spin, comic rants, bicycle races, & news. #NotAlone
793677902252388352 2016-11-01 04:55:32 UTC <Laurentia> Looking to reinvent myself. Of course, I have thought that often. And as much as I change, both inside and out, I am still here. #TheRealMe
793570145415245825 2016-11-01 21:47:21 UTC <Laurentia> I have a brand new, no stamp passport. It needs to get used, dirty, pressed to breast, passed by foreign eyes. It needs adventure. So do I.
793309884104060928 2016-10-31 04:33:10 UTC <Laurentia> Getting plumper with winter warmth as I ride shorter rides and eat more chocolate. Time to set up the trainers and actually use them. #Ride
793288146372788224 2016-10-31 03:06:47 UTC <Laurentia> Organic fingerling potatoes, locally harvested venison, tomatoes from my garden: dinner here is always a delight; I do not cook, I feast.
793154781485289473 2016-10-31 18:16:50 UTC <Laurentia> Learning new stuff and getting organized are two of my favorite things to do in my office. Organizing work makes it easy to complete. Woohoo
793098010863337472 2016-10-31 14:31:15 UTC <Laurentia> Perhaps my elation has to do with the entire pot of coffee that was just consumed, laden with sugar and cream. I am joyously hopped up.
793094427501662208 2016-10-31 14:17:01 UTC <Laurentia> My heart is light, my brain is calm. Speaking my own highest truth; I know what is right for my purpose. Paying attention to my emotions.
792932924723126272 2016-10-30 03:35:15 UTC <Laurentia> Such a relaxing weekend. I dropped a bad contract on friday. Spent the time decompressing. Delicious to take control of destiny. #Grateful
791838154324004864 2016-10-27 03:05:02 UTC <Laurentia> Good Girls Revolt. Yeah. A good bit of girl power. Love Grace Gummer.
791701709366042624 2016-10-27 18:02:51 UTC <Laurentia> Just going to be happy today. I can decide and be. I am not going to let anyone change my mind. I am my own creator. Today I create awesome.
791674081573687296 2016-10-27 16:13:04 UTC <Laurentia> Small town life. Old lady swimming in the wee hours. Friends crashed on the couch. Fresh coffee. My small life feels big to me. Im Grateful.
791519257196568576 2016-10-26 05:57:51 UTC <Laurentia> Some days it feels like living in a Vonnegut novel. Watching the battle between the groper and the ball buster; frightening, yet amusing.
791468053393354752 2016-10-26 02:34:23 UTC <Laurentia> Home made thin crust pizza. My boyfriend is better than yours.
791411091343499267 2016-10-26 22:48:02 UTC <Laurentia> While 20 years ago I drank tequila gleefully; since then I teetotal. And yet two bottles showed up for my birthday. Time for a vision quest.
791406448244723712 2016-10-26 22:29:35 UTC <Laurentia> Second day of the new contract. These people hate their jobs. So glad I work remotely, it must be a toxic atmosphere. Good luck to mundane.
790939062383222784 2016-10-25 15:32:22 UTC <Laurentia> Last week a company called in a panic looking for someone to take over a project before the current person leaves. Then crickets. WTF?
790644399268958208 2016-10-24 20:01:28 UTC <Laurentia> Learning new stuff every day is almost as much fun as a bike ride. Today I learned that I should believe poor online reviews. #BadCompany
790369773313941504 2016-10-23 01:50:12 UTC <Laurentia> Starting a new contract tomorrow. It lasts for 3 months. Just long enough to be ready to move on to something new. Yippee for the short run.
789662634136121344 2016-10-21 03:00:17 UTC <Laurentia> Do you suppose that parents in China admonish their children to eat their dinner with the spectre of starving children in America? #GoodLife
788924377681145856 2016-10-19 02:06:43 UTC <Laurentia> I accidentally clicked on the debate. Where oh where is my happy place. I used to respect this process. Now it just seems dumb. #debatenight
788476169641340928 2016-10-18 20:25:42 UTC <Laurentia> I am Woman, Indian, Mexican, Muslim, Buddist, Man, Catholic, Jewish, Russian, Chinese, Tall, Short, Gorgeous, Ugly. I am We, I am One. #All1
787890734183612416 2016-10-16 05:39:23 UTC <Laurentia> Sad last moments of Sunday. Monday looms like a trip to the dentist. Luckily I don't have to work very hard to make things happen. #ImHappy
785663523149844482 2016-10-10 02:09:15 UTC <Laurentia> Went to ride and was rewarded with a break in the rain with the sun breaking through. It was positively luscious. Get ready for winter girl.
785413697812312065 2016-10-10 09:36:32 UTC <Laurentia> Binge watched all of "Betas". Not sure why. Even sort of sad that is all there is. But still, so many other lost opportunities. Like sleep.
784448279501078528 2016-10-07 17:40:18 UTC <Laurentia> The blessed rain has arrived. Time to set up the bike trainer. Dave Stoller rides again.pic.twitter.com/NFz8bPRuee
784419964476194816 2016-10-07 15:47:48 UTC <Laurentia> The rainy season has begun. Clouds hang thick over the sun, the drizzle will last all day. As I nestle in a blankie I see the trees dancing.
783042165542752256 2016-10-03 20:32:55 UTC <Laurentia> I came across notes from my last job. This was my email password: "NewJobNow!". Thanks Universe, you worked pretty quick. #ThoughtIntoBeing
782999456346103808 2016-10-03 17:43:12 UTC <Laurentia> Existential angst dropped into my stomach this weekend and rode me like a parasite. I feel better today. My dog crawled on my lap for hours.
782728053168320512 2016-10-02 23:44:44 UTC <Laurentia> Middle of the weekend, my stomach lurched. Not sickness of the body, but sickness of mind: I thought myself into fear. I've changed my mind.
782048938845024256 2016-09-30 02:46:11 UTC <Laurentia> So much me-ness to question. I rode my bike, made the scalloped spuds, shut my mouth in lieu of alternative views. Sitting outside alone.
781557398813020160 2016-09-29 18:12:59 UTC <Laurentia> Morning chores are completed. Promised sunshine is elusive but I am going to go take the bike out. Grateful to be able to ride. #BikepeDiem
781536368237293568 2016-09-29 16:49:25 UTC <Laurentia> Short lived dreams can boost me up, give me a glimpse into a new life, a new way of being. New thoughts alone expand my world. Imagine that!
781375698577403904 2016-09-28 06:10:58 UTC <Laurentia> Out of the blue, LinkedIn sent me a list of jobs, all in Barcelona. I applied for one; fabulous fantasy. I could ride my bike there, again.
781316894976606208 2016-09-28 02:17:18 UTC <Laurentia> My tire tread is thin, my bottle cage snapped, the tail-light battery is dead, the rear pack is faded. What a great bike summer. #BikepeDiem
781312958597046272 2016-09-28 02:01:40 UTC <Laurentia> Tired of small talk but my location leaves me bereft of persons to carry on canny, esoteric conversations with. I'd have to define it first.
781231591230013441 2016-09-28 20:38:20 UTC <Laurentia> Even though I keep a spreadsheet that tracks every statistic of my daily rides, while pedaling I just enjoy the ride endorphins. #BikepeDiem
781169067163955200 2016-09-28 16:29:53 UTC <Laurentia> Sometimes I wish I for that blissfully ignorant time of my life when politics were a non-issue in my thoughts. Only biking, boys, & beaches.
780975106910658560 2016-09-27 03:39:09 UTC <Laurentia> Feeling good about myself. Crawled off the couch in this spring. Fat, slow: 4 mile bike ride was tough. Now, 15 miles a day. Next a century!
780516868637405184 2016-09-26 21:18:17 UTC <Laurentia> My weekend was so nice, relaxing, fun. I don't even mind that it is Monday today. It was that refreshing. Long bike rides change everything.
779149612124741632 2016-09-22 02:45:18 UTC <Laurentia> There is some stir fry going down in my kitchen. I am not the cook, that is the primate maximus of the house. My stomach is getting excited.
779138494824263680 2016-09-22 02:01:07 UTC <Laurentia> Time to get my teeth cleaned. Yippie. Too much flossing at this late date will probably just scar my gums. No way to fool them now. I tried!
779130923392442369 2016-09-22 01:31:02 UTC <Laurentia> The good thing about all the crazy shit going on in the world, people are energized. For good or ill they are engaged and meme-ing about it.
779083583407337472 2016-09-22 22:22:55 UTC <Laurentia> Is feeling smug about riding my bike wrong? I always feel so happy after ride endorphins kick in. My vigorous thighs relax. #BikersAreBetter
779043140304904192 2016-09-22 19:42:13 UTC <Laurentia> Time to bike ride. My brain is running in circles. It needs to be distracted by playing in traffic. Brains are funny that way. #QuietDownNow
778842577181126656 2016-09-21 06:25:15 UTC <Laurentia> So happy. No reason. Just because I am. Well, lots of reasons. I am filled with dreams. I'm training to be ready for anything, making goals.
778356784863993856 2016-09-20 22:14:53 UTC <Laurentia> New knowledge, new truths always feels like remembering, Oh yeah! It is comforting; like I knew it all along, just remember. Relax and know.
778252687024398336 2016-09-20 15:21:14 UTC <Laurentia> OH, my eyes, my brain, my stomach... why oh why did I do that? Years of curiosity finally tempted me. Two girls, one cup. Don't do it! NOOO!
777709374504480768 2016-09-18 03:22:18 UTC <Laurentia> A good day riding will make me relaxed for a couple days. But I prefer to top off daily. Bike riding is my favorite drug. Happy thighs, joy.
777574372378718208 2016-09-18 18:25:51 UTC <Laurentia> Pondering riding in the rain. Yesterday, at the last hour of daylight, I went. I felt glorious; strong and soggy. Off I go again. Rock&Roll!
777060011650408448 2016-09-17 08:21:58 UTC <Laurentia> So many thoughts of creation flying out of my brain. Too bad my need to nap is stronger than the pull of the full moon and her temptations.
777059047715377152 2016-09-17 08:18:08 UTC <Laurentia> Drawing, part of my happy thoughts program. Working designs out on paper. Illustrator is great to refine, but my pencil is more creative.
777050329795792896 2016-09-17 07:43:30 UTC <Laurentia> Late night sirens raise unease. Friends playing night games, cars driving cliff roads, deer jumping into speeding lights. More cars come.
775812250435059712 2016-09-13 21:43:49 UTC <Laurentia> Tracking bike rides with excel. Is it making me ride more? If I spent the time riding that I spend spreadsheeting, would I be better off?
774039245916811264 2016-09-08 00:18:31 UTC <Laurentia> Learning more everyday. It's pretty exciting actually. To be able to respond quickly to requests. Yeah, this is gonna be good. #LoveMyJob
773391149226680320 2016-09-06 05:23:13 UTC <Laurentia> Time to quiet my mind. The world had its way, and I played along. Now, exhausted, I remember: Breath, close my eyes, get happy, see forever.
773311782274211840 2016-09-06 00:07:50 UTC <Laurentia> Reminding myself to write more. Even if it is a tweet. Is a tweet considered writing,or just a spurt into the void? A writing wrist icicle.
773262328103972864 2016-09-06 20:51:20 UTC <Laurentia> Every headwind is a tailwind when you turn around. Unless it's Wawawai Canyon where the wind just changed direction.pic.twitter.com/pFDwwtQBcU
772661160533295106 2016-09-04 05:02:30 UTC <Laurentia> Just watched a documentary on Irish pubs. A Guinness sure sounds good right now. Closest pour (not likely a 'Proper' Guinness) is 50 miles.
772657838460055552 2016-09-04 04:49:18 UTC <Laurentia> Beautiful day to be rollin' in the tall grass. Bike breaks in lush river delta. Dog smiles off leash. So do I. #Wildpic.twitter.com/e8oFBLzhlg
772562208601444352 2016-09-04 22:29:18 UTC <Laurentia> My normal bike ride felt like a stroll after the longest day of the year yesterday.  Further will be the new normal. TOSRV West in June 2017
772435076038537218 2016-09-04 14:04:07 UTC <Laurentia> Oh man, as much as I love summer and its heat and beaches; I do love putting on a hoodie and feeling the warm hug on a cold morning. #Autumn
772315035750113280 2016-09-03 06:07:08 UTC <Laurentia> Feeling restless when I should sleep. But here I am, watching a movie on UFOs. Of course I have seen them. Haven't you? Restless, agitated.
772273067259080704 2016-09-03 03:20:22 UTC <Laurentia> The Stacker leaves treats again. I never see the maker, but the markers are hidden all along Orofino Creek. #RockArtpic.twitter.com/ro1UN1U5GM
772167647303577601 2016-09-03 20:21:27 UTC <Laurentia> Made it to a long ride today. Sitting eating PB&J in Asotin. Turning around to head back. It is a four bridge, four park, four sandwich day.
772085097663037440 2016-09-03 14:53:26 UTC <Laurentia> "Up and At 'Em", at my age really means I did not die overnight and managed to make tea this morning. So I am Up and At 'Em. #IAmAliveStill
771974036284846080 2016-09-03 07:32:07 UTC <Laurentia> Half mast eyes, partially drunk, bike tired thighs. Still my brain runs full speed, thinking mad monkey brain thoughts. Quiet! Let sleep be.
771951526797533188 2016-09-02 06:02:40 UTC <Laurentia> Thrummy, flop-eared beast that cast my lifetime of cat person aside for leashes, poop bags, doggie treats and walks.pic.twitter.com/NyB6B0JXH6
771948765498466305 2016-09-02 05:51:42 UTC <Laurentia> I just butt dialed and hung up. Not fast enough. Call back. Awkward conversation. It was the one person who annoys me to the point of love.
771940564325560320 2016-09-02 05:19:07 UTC <Laurentia> Pandora & Talking Heads. My recollection as a yuppie in NYC differs distinctly from my SO who was a dad in grad school in Idaho. #crazypast
771777838915604480 2016-09-02 18:32:30 UTC <Laurentia> Has Twitter changed formats? The "Your Tweet activity" box makes me weirded out. Am I tweeting too much or not enough? And who cares anyway?
771728971268370432 2016-09-02 15:18:19 UTC <Laurentia> What is wrong with people? Pumpkin lattes, pumpkin rolls. The gross factor aside, it's the beginning of September. Give it a couple months.
771492039733096448 2016-09-01 23:36:50 UTC <Laurentia> I love my new job: making my own duties. Empowerment makes me happy. I will eat, breath, and dream this role. Plus, I get to bike for lunch.
771418744857911296 2016-09-01 18:45:35 UTC <Laurentia> Me and the dog on usual bike ride. In spite of my feminism, but because of my age, I enjoyed the construction workers obvious ogle. #BikeAss
770844557541986304 2016-08-30 04:43:58 UTC <Laurentia> Watching the Misty Copeland documentary. She is a world class athlete. A very graceful, lovely athlete. Makes me want to go to the ballet.
770804104775933952 2016-08-30 02:03:14 UTC <Laurentia> ACIM #  39:"My holiness is my salvation." Now that is a brain full. I am creeping into knowing. 38:"There is nothing my holiness cannot do."
770741298227580929 2016-08-30 21:53:39 UTC <Laurentia> Fidgety hands with access to pens, a brownie, colored pencils, and some time to focus on something distracting, new.pic.twitter.com/xa1LCjrMcU
770477499633598465 2016-08-29 04:25:25 UTC <Laurentia> Trying to break old patterns is a hoot. Interjecting random acts like jumping jacks. New thoughts occur, but my dog barked at me. #WhoAreYou
770365010216267776 2016-08-29 20:58:25 UTC <Laurentia> Things always work out for me, even when it sometimes looks like it is going in the shitter. Learning puts me in a better position for Next.
770318713362931712 2016-08-29 17:54:27 UTC <Laurentia> This is no way to start the week. Such innocent looking small glasses of brandy. Pens came out and music was played.pic.twitter.com/qv5kXeLWoY
769773020437065728 2016-08-27 05:46:04 UTC <Laurentia> A drive upriver to swim is a day date with my scotch boyfriend. Romance comes cheap in Clearwater County. #GeezerFunpic.twitter.com/jcau6f01De
769422720048074752 2016-08-26 06:34:06 UTC <Laurentia> Beauty can be found in the smallest, most mundane places. All i need do is look, pay attention, Enjoy more minutia.pic.twitter.com/Jwta32cdeA
769362237681115137 2016-08-26 02:33:46 UTC <Laurentia> This small town I thought I was trapped in... turns out, I got my shit together here. A fresh start from a mid-life upheaval. #ImAliveAgain
769323855588372480 2016-08-26 00:01:15 UTC <Laurentia> What an awesome day. Productive, fun, lots of work done. Still time for a bike ride and a soaking at the splash pad. Yin and yang-ed my day.
769086261701345285 2016-08-26 08:17:08 UTC <Laurentia> Why oh why do I fight sleep so hard and waking even more? At once my eyes threaten closure, body loving bed. Yet I tweet, not sleep. #idiot
768997781180588033 2016-08-25 02:25:32 UTC <Laurentia> In my small media diet I have noticed a remarkable new space in my thinking to engage in other ideas, activities. Feeling good is addictive.
768344807274008576 2016-08-24 07:10:51 UTC <Laurentia> Everything is happening all at once. I can only see what I believe in and focus on. I can see the effects on everything in my life. So smile
768234526283751424 2016-08-23 23:52:38 UTC <Laurentia> I love learning technical products, systems, programming new apps. Still, there are points in the process where I want to kick a computer.
767426954387525632 2016-08-21 18:23:38 UTC <Laurentia> Trying so hard to ameliorate, never seeing that the best you can hope for is to palliate. Comfort, guide, love, and support: then step away.
767405975686877184 2016-08-21 17:00:16 UTC <Laurentia> In the normal indolence of breakfast, waffles - with their quadrants and squares, demand orderly forking. My Boyfriend says it is my OCD.
767391085651865601 2016-08-21 16:01:06 UTC <Laurentia> My brother burns a small "V" for Vance on his lighters. It is so helpful. I know exactly who I lifted these two new lighters from. #freefire
767269058139918338 2016-08-21 07:56:13 UTC <Laurentia> Snugging in bed; I thought of the days when I would just now be arriving drunk, at some club in a too small dress; looking for prey. Meow.
767253807524749312 2016-08-20 06:55:37 UTC <Laurentia> Breaking out of the stultifying habits that burrow my mind into the rat's own rut, racing nowhere. Self imposed walls are hardest to scale.
767251686284890113 2016-08-20 06:47:11 UTC <Laurentia> Working minute to minute to stay in the minute to minute, where the action is. Not in the future, not in the past. Right now for pure magic.
767234465714147328 2016-08-20 05:38:45 UTC <Laurentia> Are all artists crazy? Seems to be an ingredient in many careers. I'm sufficiently crazy, why did I stop making art? Off the deep end I go.
767198789262127104 2016-08-20 03:16:59 UTC <Laurentia> Absolutely gorgeous day, sunny, hot, sweltering bike ride followed by luscious cooling dive into the crystal clear river. Yes, superlatives!
765408142117044224 2016-08-15 04:41:36 UTC <Laurentia> 27. Above all else, I want to see. #ACIM The lesson of the day had me looking anew at everything. as 25. I do not know what anything is for.
764961648134062081 2016-08-14 23:07:23 UTC <Laurentia> In the dog days of summer, I loathe to leave the beach. What if we don't get on the river again before fall? #WhatIfpic.twitter.com/eepdWi07Yb
763991298550358017 2016-08-11 06:51:34 UTC <Laurentia> So far, not a single meteor has streaked by me. I am tired. I guess I will grab a look at the NASA sight and call it a day. #Shootingstars
763832439126921216 2016-08-11 20:20:19 UTC <Laurentia> You know what is not negative, kick ass bike ride. Ten miles for lunch followed by some watermelon. I am happier, faster and smellier. #Bike
763796816739520512 2016-08-11 17:58:46 UTC <Laurentia> Have decided to go on media diet. Get rid of the negative noise. Election season has taken its toll, I need a break. Focusing on peace, joy.
763602232369483779 2016-08-10 05:05:33 UTC <Laurentia> So relaxing to watch something without a political message. No message at really except bike riding is fun. It even has a soundtrack to tap.
763597805290004482 2016-08-10 04:47:58 UTC <Laurentia> Racing a fixed gear bike with no brakes through New York City isn't something I will ever do. Pretending I am racing while in NYC, hell yes!
763595870935789568 2016-08-10 04:40:17 UTC <Laurentia> Watching "Line of Sight", Lucas Brunelle's film about alley cat races. Gets my adrenaline pumping, makes me want to ride. Fast, in cities.
763455695165329409 2016-08-10 19:23:16 UTC <Laurentia> Fresh plump grapes are sweet, crunch, juicy globes of goodness. The pop of the skin as my tongue slurps the juice. A good grape satisfies.
763428230615273472 2016-08-10 17:34:08 UTC <Laurentia> Okay, unusual for August,  it has been cloudy, rainy, cool. But the sun has peaked out. Time to ride my bike down by the river. #LoveMyBike
763406318795272193 2016-08-10 16:07:04 UTC <Laurentia> Hump day morning. Still have a month of things to finish this week. It's delicious to be busy, learning. Startups rule. #NoSleepTillBrooklyn
763080406719614976 2016-08-09 18:32:00 UTC <Laurentia> Local politics: the stakes are real, the people impassioned, but this time it is the guy that lives down the street. A different civility.
763066626363097088 2016-08-09 17:37:15 UTC <Laurentia> High of 70 degrees in August? Don't get me wrong, it's perfect bike riding weather so I like it. But, it is August. Is this climate change?
762860778483396609 2016-08-08 03:59:17 UTC <Laurentia> I am not hopeless,  I am hopeful. Joyful even. I got my eye on a star. I know it's only a matter of moments before I land in my dreams. Weee
762779544545693696 2016-08-08 22:36:29 UTC <Laurentia> Would love to write more. Can 140 character blurbs increase my skill? Do tweets even count as writing? Am I just lazy and that's all I have?
762772781083664384 2016-08-08 22:09:37 UTC <Laurentia> Dreaming in color of bike touring. Last tour cut short after 2 months because thieves took bikes on Gran Canaria. Want to pick up there & go
762763637349978112 2016-08-08 21:33:17 UTC <Laurentia> Spending a lifetime trying to not be a conformist. I conformed to that notion. How do I get out of the rut of following old ideas?  #NewPath
762761635698053121 2016-08-08 21:25:20 UTC <Laurentia> I did three more miles today than yesterday. Woohoo. Small increases. I was asked if I had lost weight? I hadn't thought about it. #Bikeloss
762748832803270656 2016-08-08 20:34:27 UTC <Laurentia> Working on a record this week for bike riding miles. Okay, so it is still only Monday, but I am on track so far. Small Goals, Big results.
762340013791064064 2016-08-07 17:29:57 UTC <Laurentia> Continue whining about what you hate, wrongs you suffered, people that hurt you, how your job sucks, and that is what you get. Your choice.
762339670193676288 2016-08-07 17:28:35 UTC <Laurentia> Stop whining and focus on what you think is awesome, joyful, happy making, sexy, fun, sweet, cool, and great. And there your life will head.
762088115708174336 2016-08-06 00:49:00 UTC <Laurentia> Post bike ride shower is always extra refreshing. Food tastes better when I earned it. Face it, life works so much better when I get to ride
761676888095928320 2016-08-05 21:34:56 UTC <Laurentia> Every day is a good day to go bike riding. Today was no exception. But now it is 98 degrees, I am glad I got myself out pre-swelter. #MyBike
761469436976955392 2016-08-05 07:50:35 UTC <Laurentia> Like when George W. Bush was running for president, we need to stop focusing on what we don't want else it will happen again. Focus on love.
761458527592251392 2016-08-05 07:07:14 UTC <Laurentia> At my local beach, I realized this would be a traveling coup, were I on the road. The wild beauty; why not enjoy it now. #LocalButSpecialToo
761457415514533888 2016-08-05 07:02:49 UTC <Laurentia> At the eleventh hour I am finally alone. I don't begrudge anyone else; I am just always more relaxed to be by myself. I get me. # dontworry
761450946807279616 2016-08-04 06:37:07 UTC <Laurentia> If I send a tweet with no hash tags, did the tweet really happen? If I dance to no music, will the crazy cops bring the jacket? #hashtagShhh
761268536144637952 2016-08-04 18:32:17 UTC <Laurentia> Okay, time to force myself to do something I always enjoy. Inertia is a bitch. Until you get that bike rolling. Then Weeeeeeeee. #OffTheSofa
760912826999255041 2016-08-03 18:58:49 UTC <Laurentia> Awoke with the intention of having a fun and productive day. Here I am, grinning at how easy it is. Change your thoughts, change your world.
760749478823493632 2016-08-03 08:09:44 UTC <Laurentia> Early morning bike rides along the river. I enjoy it every day I get my ass on the bike. Make it today. #BikeJoyNowpic.twitter.com/PxUJnvA5D3
760590665138921472 2016-08-02 21:38:40 UTC <Laurentia> When does voting for the lesser of two evils become really just voting for the evil you already know. Evil is still evil, pantsuit or wig.
760525242175463428 2016-08-02 17:18:42 UTC <Laurentia> Good days start after a good night's sleep. Great days start with a bike ride following a good night's sleep. This day is gonna be awesome!
760323424841371649 2016-08-01 03:56:45 UTC <Laurentia> Woohoo, new job, first completed project. Small win, but a start, success on the first day. Learning, Improving. I might even say: #Winning
760296088280571905 2016-08-01 02:08:07 UTC <Laurentia> In a burst of flurried activity, I cleaned my office, de-cluttered even the bulletin board. Started new spreadsheets, readied my life. #OkGo
759587557948526592 2016-07-30 03:12:40 UTC <Laurentia> Live music in the woods over the frog pond. Fiddle, bass, and rockin' granny on drums.  The 8 year old in the pink dress sings blues. #Blues
759228330805780480 2016-07-29 03:25:14 UTC <Laurentia> Just because someone takes advantage of me, I am still going to trust the next person I meet. It works out better for me that way. #Trust
759127040905715712 2016-07-29 20:42:45 UTC <Laurentia> Watching political speeches: filled with fear, lies & bombastic rhetoric, mixed with pleas for unity; till my head is ready to explode. #sob
759045102178230272 2016-07-29 15:17:09 UTC <Laurentia> So excited for the future. Finally not faking it. I always fake it until it happens and it always does. I am careful with my thoughts. #love
758047862664024064 2016-07-26 21:14:28 UTC <Laurentia> Just started a new job today. I welcome the challenge, collaboration, and cash. However, the slacker part of my soul sighed. #LoveLazySummer
757859455576838144 2016-07-26 08:45:49 UTC <Laurentia> Ramble, pointless posting of pointless posts. Twitter the void, dreaming of more than clarity, of being heard. Or adored. I want too much.
757857704014548994 2016-07-26 08:38:51 UTC <Laurentia> Watching TV late at night. For no good reason. Not tired, should sleep. Or read. My brain is getting lazy. I am getting lazy. To what end?
757856214894063616 2016-07-26 08:32:56 UTC <Laurentia> I so enjoy the idea of socializing.  I even enjoy it for a couple hours before I need to get drunk or flee. When young, I drank. Now I flee.
757758263219761152 2016-07-25 02:03:43 UTC <Laurentia> Round and Round. Lies vs Lies. Greed vs Power, the people be damned.https://twitter.com/BenjaminNorton/status/757711194568491008
757722502130987008 2016-07-25 23:41:36 UTC <Laurentia> I'd like to see any nominee get in a workout now and then, ride a bike. Both of them are getting larger as their faces look deathly. #NotVPs
757721569976258560 2016-07-25 23:37:54 UTC <Laurentia> We used to watch as Presidents jogged, worried when they gained weight. Both nominees are UnFit and Fat with bad VPs in the wings. #OhShit
757465953248514049 2016-07-24 06:42:10 UTC <Laurentia> Amazing the things that I think about then riding my bike. Sometimes the purity of beauty, sometimes truth and existence intrudes. #SmugLife
757457515613261824 2016-07-24 06:08:39 UTC <Laurentia> Yes, I believe the Bible is the word of God. Just as I believe Every Book is the word of God. There're many ways to learn the lesson needed.
757358344227086336 2016-07-24 23:34:34 UTC <Laurentia> WooHoo, with Dog. Dog is my Co-Pilot.pic.twitter.com/adZkwRF5wC
757357910573789188 2016-07-24 23:32:51 UTC <Laurentia> A great weekend away to ride. Better with the dog, but fun either way. North Idaho is gorgeous. #BikeLife #SmugLifepic.twitter.com/6ABGAjRKkC
757352204705509380 2016-07-24 23:10:11 UTC <Laurentia> Had a wonderful weekend at my reunion. High School clicks dissolve a little bit after four decades; & enjoying my childhood home. #Sandpoint
756998112359571456 2016-07-23 23:43:08 UTC <Laurentia> Twenty one miles on awesome bike paths. Perfect way to start day. Then a hot tub soak. Life is full of good things. I deserve it. #SmugLife
756174795633364993 2016-07-21 17:11:34 UTC <Laurentia> I thought it was a great idea, coffee with brandy. Oh so yummy. Now the morning after, turns out to be a crappy idea. #hangover #SmugLife
755514622002597889 2016-07-19 21:28:17 UTC <Laurentia> I have a large vocabulary, from lots of reading. Reading leads to agile thinking. Agile thinking creates a lexicon of compassion. #SmugLife
755490990207545344 2016-07-19 19:54:23 UTC <Laurentia> Since when is Chachi a smart political analyst? And Freddy Mercury would not likely lend his gay anthemn to a homophobe and bigot. #SmugLife
755437020973981696 2016-07-19 16:19:55 UTC <Laurentia> Girl is telling me increasingly incredible tales of woe: said she was held down and injected with Meth til she became a drug mule. #SmugLife
755305048054247424 2016-07-19 07:35:31 UTC <Laurentia> Confidence in your correctness: the price of entry into the #SmugLife. In the bight twixt correct and conceit, where is the line? #audacious
755285566099382275 2016-07-18 06:18:06 UTC <Laurentia> Red faced fat man at cycling event dinner; full kit, including clips, yellow jersey's message on long tail: "3 Feet, It's The Law" #SmugLife
755078681882611712 2016-07-18 16:36:01 UTC <Laurentia> So much to learn. No matter where you look. No matter what you want to do, always more to learn. Unless you are a "Know It All". #SmugLife
754879560970153984 2016-07-17 03:24:46 UTC <Laurentia> The most benign topic: the weather. Yet, it affects everything. Day to day, it is beautiful. Over years, it changes the face of life. #exist
754874642888658944 2016-07-17 03:05:14 UTC <Laurentia> Now that my smugness have been shown to me, how do I adjust. I was smug for a good reason, or so I thought. Does correctness excuse conceit?
754873544626974720 2016-07-17 03:00:52 UTC <Laurentia> Middle ground, common ground, gathering place of mediocrity, compromise. Social grace advises it, adventure seeking heart begs to veer left.
754872701034999808 2016-07-17 02:57:31 UTC <Laurentia> I have a problem with the middle. I need the edge. Either balls out through the world, or reclusive quiet solo existence. Social: new or not
754824339464134656 2016-07-17 23:45:21 UTC <Laurentia> An element of smugness, just a bit of conceit; it couldn't be helped. Five hundred bicyclists in one celebratory location. We ride, we rule.
754749735592861696 2016-07-17 18:48:54 UTC <Laurentia> Back home, new job on the horizon. IT Director. Woohoo. Challenging, exciting, new, with possible travel to places I like. I rock. #HelloNYC
754377382182608896 2016-07-16 18:09:18 UTC <Laurentia> Riding the Bitterroot Trail. Gorgeous day. Bumpy path keeps my bell ringing. And yes I mean my bicycle bell. #ridingpic.twitter.com/yxiRoFXW9L
753724688929468416 2016-07-14 22:55:44 UTC <Laurentia> Somehow everything just changed. I knew it would. I just needed to be patient, be happy, smile and know that it would work out. And it did!
753616321292619776 2016-07-14 15:45:07 UTC <Laurentia> Just got an advert on the tweet window above the Compose new Tweet box. Really? I closed the box in horror. No place to hide. #SolicitingTwt
753464628374491136 2016-07-13 05:42:20 UTC <Laurentia> Most everyday I am very happy with my decision to go vegetarian. However, with a carnivore chef boyfriend, somedays I ponder a relapse. #BBQ
752208801466494976 2016-07-10 18:32:08 UTC <Laurentia> Things feel like they are ready to explode. For the first time I am extra happy to live in the far out sticks. Everyone knows everyone here.
751958914057457664 2016-07-09 01:59:10 UTC <Laurentia> Working on my class reunion. Building badges for everyone attending with their high school photo on them. Boy have they aged, but #NotMe
751915988581380096 2016-07-09 23:08:36 UTC <Laurentia> It is amazing how responsive the universe is to changing beliefs. I decided I was tired of my industry, suddenly found myself on a new path.
751884793223065600 2016-07-09 21:04:38 UTC <Laurentia> Growing tomatoes in pots. I repotted 3 of 5, only pots available. Two weeks later they are twice the size. Repotting the last two. #Tomatoes
751838723608711168 2016-07-09 18:01:34 UTC <Laurentia> Thunderstorms on the horizon, muggy in the waiting. Bring it on Nature, I am ready. Just rain like the coming of the Ark, wildfires suck it.
751701887171239936 2016-07-09 08:57:50 UTC <Laurentia> Projects that keep me focused into the wee hours are the best. I love the timeless now that occupies my head when working on creative & fun.
751546891540656128 2016-07-08 22:41:56 UTC <Laurentia> Helpers that aid unbidden, nice sometimes, annoying at others. At least wait until I express distress or need. I might be happy this way.
751545888539942912 2016-07-08 22:37:57 UTC <Laurentia> Pithy wisdoms, terse witticisms, virtues extolled in 140 characters. Culture adapting to joy and banality, delivered in glimpses. #LifeIn140
751477144488800256 2016-07-08 18:04:47 UTC <Laurentia> I do love a good "AH HA" moment, it lifts my perception. But in my experience, that moment is preceded by a long line of "Oh Shit" moments.
751457773380968448 2016-07-08 16:47:49 UTC <Laurentia> There is a place in Clearwater County that is thick with UFOs. I can't see them with I look, but when I take photos, there they are. #OhUFOs
751454958940147714 2016-07-08 16:36:38 UTC <Laurentia> The foraging for food around here is pretty easy right now. Black caps are delicate, tart, and sweet and all mine!pic.twitter.com/M5oNe7SYtR
751318213326041088 2016-07-08 07:33:15 UTC <Laurentia> New sleeping schedule creeping in. It gives me more time in the nighttime. Something lights up my brain differently when other noise sleeps.
751313501415542786 2016-07-08 07:14:32 UTC <Laurentia> Striving to live a different life always has consequences for the life I am living now. Moving toward myself or further away; a coin flip?
751242570873774081 2016-07-07 02:32:40 UTC <Laurentia> I heard someone say "I saw a movie and it changed my life forever". I am pretty sure everything you do changes your life forever. #subtly
751237762372636672 2016-07-07 02:13:34 UTC <Laurentia> Bike ride, nap, shower, and dinner. Now a big fatty. I'm telling you, along with seeing a coyote cub, this was a damn good day. #LoveMyLife
751179507470512128 2016-07-07 22:22:05 UTC <Laurentia> Not able to stop for photos on my bike ride: on the way up river, I plead against loss of momentum, coming back, the joy of speed. #Weeeeeee
750993545348001792 2016-07-07 10:03:08 UTC <Laurentia> Capricious and unruly, my thoughts, the biggest challenge I face. Focus comes & goes, like tidal waves, ebbing and cresting. Time to travel.
750534246612164608 2016-07-05 03:38:03 UTC <Laurentia> How can I go from complete focused charge forward to immobile couch spud in the turn of a thought? Too much food? Maybe a nap is in order...
750392281136402432 2016-07-05 18:13:56 UTC <Laurentia> I am feeling awesome today. Well everyday usually, but today I am even more fantastic. It is a decision, and a bike ride. Glory be to today.
749827842209255424 2016-07-03 04:51:03 UTC <Laurentia> My addiction to composing the perfect tweet aside; my lazy attraction to my online life is waning. Real experiences beckon my ass to move.
749735048287363072 2016-07-03 22:42:19 UTC <Laurentia> Playing indoors on a sunny day. Baked muffins thinking of days gone by when most of the day would be consumed nursing a hangover. #maturity
749678974251311104 2016-07-03 18:59:30 UTC <Laurentia> Long weekends kick ass. One more day to get outside my norm. Need to do that often to relieve the pressure of regularity. Wild me lives big.
749326937919623168 2016-07-02 19:40:38 UTC <Laurentia> Now that the last lingering guest from last night's hoedown has left, I just thought of some great free-style lines. My free-style has debt.
749289178295201792 2016-07-02 17:10:35 UTC <Laurentia> I remember this feeling.It has been a long time. I just don't do that anymore. Well, apparently that is not true. I did it. I feel it. shit.
749104251599675392 2016-07-01 04:55:45 UTC <Laurentia> Enough musician grease has been consumed, even the one note harmonica player is jamming. Free-styling on the porch, dogs dancing in the dark
749055985780596736 2016-07-01 01:43:58 UTC <Laurentia> Freshly shucked peas, rice and beans, and a glass of sun tea. Is it too early to nap? A full belly always make me want to head for the couch
749049268296519680 2016-07-01 01:17:16 UTC <Laurentia> Guitar players on the porch. Always a joy to hear music live. I don't play, yet, but I have the strings, the players and the ears. Thx John.
749038254054187010 2016-07-01 00:33:30 UTC <Laurentia> TGIF. I drink like a pansy, kiddie liquor. It's okay, I've had hardcore days already. Enlightened drinking is cool.pic.twitter.com/imOkkF7lim
748957443724484608 2016-07-01 19:12:24 UTC <Laurentia> Ever faithful, girl's best friend, waiting to go where I go. He demands and gets love. I should be so devoted. #lovepic.twitter.com/VxY0vlToR5
748948612198043648 2016-07-01 18:37:18 UTC <Laurentia> Thermal imaging to detect motors? Cheaters, can't you just use steroids like everyone else?https://twitter.com/cyclingweekly/status/748948055114780672
748946595794808832 2016-07-01 18:29:17 UTC <Laurentia> The simplest thing turns my day into a magical summer funland. My toes dream of fantastical beaches, my mind is now.pic.twitter.com/ZtjMjG6n95
748927046982639616 2016-07-01 17:11:37 UTC <Laurentia> When wanderlust is caged for too long, things start to go sideways in ways incomprehensible to those who do not have it. It is incurable.
748800136340385792 2016-07-01 08:47:19 UTC <Laurentia> I used to think Boris Johnson was cool because he rode a bike and has a young man's hair. Clearly biking did not enlighten him as it did me.
748781817088450560 2016-07-01 07:34:31 UTC <Laurentia> I feel like a butterfly stuck in the chrysalis. I am dying to spread my wings and fly but the walls are too close. Let me burst out on wing!
748764275892637696 2016-06-30 06:24:49 UTC <Laurentia> Ug, when do hot flashes stop? They have been going on for more than five years. (Not continuously!) By now I notice them less, but I notice.
748729671290806273 2016-06-30 04:07:19 UTC <Laurentia> What are you doing here? I ask that often. Sometimes it's about my location.  Usually it's about the state of my thought. Peace, joy, fear.
748728586102722560 2016-06-30 04:03:00 UTC <Laurentia> What are you doing here? I ask myself daily. Sometimes it's about my location. Usually it's about the state of my thought. Happy, joy or not
748712829725716480 2016-06-30 03:00:23 UTC <Laurentia> Focus. Clear up Mind, go quiet. You've been whining out of turn. Just shut up and enjoy the ride. You asked for the most exciting trip ever.
748675802401632256 2016-06-30 00:33:15 UTC <Laurentia> It's hard to reach out when your natural tendency leans toward introversion. Not shy, nor afraid, merely focused elsewhere. #MySmilesNotFake
748661886065872896 2016-06-30 23:37:57 UTC <Laurentia> So stinking hot. Planning a float tomorrow. Somewhere in a cold waterbody. Anybody who doesn't believe in climate change can suck my ice.
748590235806629888 2016-06-30 18:53:15 UTC <Laurentia> I have been watching a series into this, its eighth & final season and we are down to the last 2 episodes and suddenly it's a musical. #FML
748416462914609155 2016-06-30 07:22:44 UTC <Laurentia> Looking for patterns in the chaos around me. Within the chaos all options exist. Patterns emerging remove other possibilities. Sweet wonder.
748191120534839296 2016-06-29 16:27:18 UTC <Laurentia> Yay, the organic farm truck comes to town today. For 20 bucks we have enough veggies for a week, including a watermelon. #ILoveInSeasonFood
748067527465574400 2016-06-29 08:16:11 UTC <Laurentia> Gad, Playing with Wordpress, hours slipped by. How did that happen. I was so engrossed. But things look better. How fun was that? #nerdplay
748005825625595906 2016-06-28 04:11:00 UTC <Laurentia> Our regular couch crashing booze hound has graced us again. Always enthusiastic in every conversation; it liberates me from speaking at all.
747953364848123906 2016-06-28 00:42:33 UTC <Laurentia> A friend just had his dog euthanized. Dog limped, hips barely moved, but still followed everywhere. I hope I go before my dog. #bestdogever
747945577640386564 2016-06-28 00:11:36 UTC <Laurentia> I live near the cross country bicycling route. Daily I see valiant souls pursuing same dream I followed 40 years ago. Same dream I have now.
747939658751848448 2016-06-28 23:48:05 UTC <Laurentia> Google maps solicited me for the last photo I took on my bike ride. When did that start? "Would I like to add my photo?" Back off creep.
747938315563761664 2016-06-28 23:42:45 UTC <Laurentia> Youtube thinks me snarkier than I do. Suggested videos lean to angry, conspiracy theory, basement anarchy. I support Bernie not Alex Jones.
747935323120771074 2016-06-28 23:30:51 UTC <Laurentia> Writing cover letters. Whether perfect job appears or not - my new writing skills: creative bullshit, feigned humility, and bold assurances.
747911887652720640 2016-06-28 21:57:44 UTC <Laurentia> So tired of dying my hair. Can I just shave my head and proudly go whatever color it is under the 40 years of chemical youth? #GrandpasGirl
747906792588349440 2016-06-28 21:37:29 UTC <Laurentia> When an intern in Portland years ago, it rained everyday. Everyday! Hacking down the jungle yard was normal. Now hoses run plant to plant.
747904688188620800 2016-06-28 21:29:07 UTC <Laurentia> Went with boyfriend to visit his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. Cute family, great food, bike rides. I enjoy being #GrandpasGirlfriend
747901333840113665 2016-06-28 21:15:47 UTC <Laurentia> Replanting tomatoes into larger pots. It needed to happen. At noon in 97 degree heat was a poor choice. For both of us. Ice tea and a hose.
747899101342138368 2016-06-28 21:06:55 UTC <Laurentia> What craziness when an online giant asks you to fax them documents. Fax? Who has a fax machine anymore? Trip to Kinkos anyone? #ReallyAmazon
747816812138553344 2016-06-28 15:39:56 UTC <Laurentia> How many tweets a day does it take to say you are an active Twitter user? Once a day, twice, 20 times? I don't have that much to spew. #Shhh
743226606236295170 2016-06-15 23:40:06 UTC <Laurentia> Can I stop watching the stupid news now? I am not getting smarter, only angier. I only want to get more calm, and peaceful in mind. #ILoveMe
743142563264139264 2016-06-15 18:06:08 UTC <Laurentia> Another Hump Day. But when working for oneself, where is the middle of the week really? But I will totally hump in solidarity. #HumpDayHumps
742916583329144832 2016-06-14 03:08:10 UTC <Laurentia> My reticence is not shyness. I am gregarious whenever the occasion requires it,  even if begrudgingly. It's not you, it's me. #PeaceInsideMe
742893155691831297 2016-06-14 01:35:05 UTC <Laurentia> First ever background check has me confessing every misstep. Nothing dangerous or even interesting. Just springboards to the future. #ILearn
742856983531786241 2016-06-14 23:11:21 UTC <Laurentia> Hearing rising calls for revolt from youthful corners in the wake of the shit show that is our culture. Remember nonviolent Gandhi. #OneLove
742834700725583873 2016-06-14 21:42:48 UTC <Laurentia> My 420th tweet! I can get excited about it with great billowing clouds of dank joy, small campfires of comfort. I lift my clamped doob. #420
742811114887467008 2016-06-14 20:09:05 UTC <Laurentia> Dear Universe, please bring me some work that excites me. You know what I like. And please make it something that helps the world. #DoNoHarm
742013222631284738 2016-06-12 15:18:32 UTC <Laurentia> Sunday mornings are always lovely. No errands, chores always done. Time to rest and play and be thankful for all this goodness. Woohoo. #Joy
741796307086385152 2016-06-11 00:56:36 UTC <Laurentia> Looking for more work. Actually, Not looking for more work. Thinking about looking for more work. Not the same thing. Fooling myself is best
741774253498851328 2016-06-11 23:28:58 UTC <Laurentia> Spent sometime with the boyfriend river side while he fished. Puffy clouds, and clouds of puffing. Ahhh, lawn chair chillin'  #SummerRocks
741653020228780034 2016-06-11 15:27:13 UTC <Laurentia> Rainy Saturday morning. Shall I hunker into my office, or say fuck it and go for a ride. What is the worst that could happen? Wet fun? #ride
740175026167549958 2016-06-07 13:34:12 UTC <Laurentia> I so enjoy temporal rituals, washing dishes, driving, folding laundry and mostly: riding a bike. Fickle mind busy, peace sneaks in #QuietNow
739895106166087680 2016-06-06 19:01:54 UTC <Laurentia> pic.twitter.com/9C20UYJrpa
738881773321392128 2016-06-03 23:55:17 UTC <Laurentia> These kiddie soda hard beverages are just the thing to slip into an altered state effortlessly. Root beer, Orange and Lemonade. #Modernlife
738877797825843200 2016-06-03 23:39:29 UTC <Laurentia> Kayaking early morning is beauty enough to catch glimpses of quiet mind. Maybe earlier would be better, less time for monkey mind to awaken.
738442338473639941 2016-06-02 18:49:07 UTC <Laurentia> Riding in the mist is great unless it's on a steep downgrade. Eyes misted over, Hands cramped from braking; felt like a stud. #DownhillSlide
738254879659982848 2016-06-01 06:24:14 UTC <Laurentia> Meditation is on my list of things that make life good. Wish I did it more. Perhaps I'll start today. I'm and my quiet mind. My world rocks.
738143169427050496 2016-06-01 23:00:20 UTC <Laurentia> Owl in daytime. Is there some superstition? Flew across the road in front of me to land in the tree. Yes I see you.pic.twitter.com/YBXbWhnco3
738118055830519811 2016-06-01 21:20:32 UTC <Laurentia> Sometimes I think about writing. How cool it would be to be a writer. Then I read a good book; a really good book. I am not cool enough yet.
737800043990679552 2016-05-31 00:16:52 UTC <Laurentia> Spent more time looking skyward today than normal. No UFO sight today. At least that I could see. My camera is faster than my eye. #My1stUFO
737737844819513344 2016-05-31 20:09:43 UTC <Laurentia> Photo of UFO yesterday. Appeared this frame, was gone within 3 seconds. Faster than a trip to crazy town. #My1stUFOpic.twitter.com/IKNzWdOIFg
737172947941490688 2016-05-29 06:45:01 UTC <Laurentia> Restless Leg Syndrome. When I was younger I used to call it Not Enough Bike Riding. I think that still says it best. I feel good. More miles
737167871449567232 2016-05-29 06:24:51 UTC <Laurentia> Flash of brilliance, near complete novel idea; jotted down the basics. A short story will prove it to me. Not a easy writer; how to proceed?
737148144257925120 2016-05-29 05:06:27 UTC <Laurentia> How can a confirmed, lifelong agoraphobic introvert reach out? Can't you just feel my love from behind my closed door? I'll send you a text.
737144068128407553 2016-05-29 04:50:15 UTC <Laurentia> Watching "The West Wing"; wanted to watch a political show where they aren't liars, thieves, & murderers. Forgot it makes me cry every time.
735899699907952640 2016-05-26 18:25:35 UTC <Laurentia> My 400th tweet. Four hundred times I have spewed tidbits of nothingness into the world. And here, commemorating all that nothingness is 400.
735885539178487808 2016-05-26 17:29:19 UTC <Laurentia> I just sent my first proposal with a bid. Yikes. I just know I undersold my time. But then, all time not on my bike is not worth the pay.
735594869272367104 2016-05-25 22:14:18 UTC <Laurentia> I wanted to stay at the house we are building but knew that we would be postponed as soon as my BF said that we should meet at home. Right.
735556511108206592 2016-05-25 19:41:52 UTC <Laurentia> Spent the better part of the morning looking for decent embedded spreadsheet web app. If it's so awesome, why is there no demo on your site?
735507477135949824 2016-05-25 16:27:02 UTC <Laurentia> Its true, focusing on myself makes me miserable. I need to help someone else accomplish their dreams and mine will happen ancillarily? Focus
735506591869337600 2016-05-25 16:23:31 UTC <Laurentia> I see what I said I wanted on the horizon and I panicked. Stall, is that really it? Or a horrible mistake of heading in the wrong direction!
734971553725616133 2016-05-23 04:57:28 UTC <Laurentia> Sucked into binge session of House of Cards; watch until ruthlessness, violence, and intrigue scare me, drive me away. Not there yet, again.
734248132272218112 2016-05-21 05:02:51 UTC <Laurentia> Pulled out all my art supplies here. My mojo is rusty so I scribble, draw and paint aimlessly; warming up for the big game. Put me in coach!
734044139751280645 2016-05-21 15:32:15 UTC <Laurentia> Somehow my website got over 80 comments, all lengthy, about video gaming. Something I know nothing about and care less about. #DeleteIdiots
733139376566214656 2016-05-18 03:37:03 UTC <Laurentia> Read "Stranger in a Strange Land". How the fuck did I miss such a seminal college tome? Solipsism was all the rage. I grok I am just an egg.
731862040093032453 2016-05-15 15:01:22 UTC <Laurentia> Away from home for a few days. I miss my boyfriend, but miss my dog more. The dog snuggles more. Maybe boyfriend needs more belly scratches.
730627877452947456 2016-05-11 05:17:15 UTC <Laurentia> Just saw Labyrinth for the first time. A great feat before CGI: puppets, Bowie, and imagination. Jim Hensen should have done Dr. Seuss.
730517682710159360 2016-05-11 21:59:22 UTC <Laurentia> thanks for some reality banksy. https://twitter.com/thereaIbanksy/status/730483702623436801
730277555098386432 2016-05-10 06:05:11 UTC <Laurentia> Aimless with expectations; drifting seaward with slack sails, looking for direction in wind. Metaphors are a substitute for vision. #WhoAmI
730232956166365189 2016-05-10 03:07:58 UTC <Laurentia> The issue is lack of direction not pessimism. Bukowski says: "My ambition is handicapped by laziness." Mine is also fear of failure. #WhoAmI
730229643303772160 2016-05-10 02:54:48 UTC <Laurentia> Another tweet into the void. Does my desire for clarity make clarity appear? Can I receive lucidity when my question is ambiguous? #WhomAmI
730214372258119680 2016-05-10 01:54:07 UTC <Laurentia> Family death makes so much seem so trivial. Time to re-evaluate everything. "What am I doing with my life?": my constant mind fuck. #WhoAmI?
727513818499190785 2016-05-03 15:03:05 UTC <Laurentia> Thank you universe for arranging time off just when I needed it. Perfect timing, perfect weather. Too bad it is for a funeral. #LovedButGone
726821238878801920 2016-05-01 17:11:01 UTC <Laurentia> Finally at the startline. Already hot. #Bloomsday2016
726816236324024322 2016-05-01 16:51:08 UTC <Laurentia> Ready to start Bloomsday. Walking just in front of the strollers. If one clips me, I am falling in and riding with the kid. #Bloomsday2016
726635285753159682 2016-04-30 04:52:07 UTC <Laurentia> Drinking the night before a 12K is a brilliant plan. I hope I do t barf on the route. #Bloomsday
722548606876540928 2016-04-19 22:13:06 UTC <Laurentia> Gad what a gorgeous day to ride a bike. Feels just like June did when I was a kid. People are swimming at the beach. Tesla and bike future.
721926542612271110 2016-04-17 05:01:15 UTC <Laurentia> Unemployment is sweet confusion. It might not last, I should enjoy it. But what if it does last? I should enjoy that too. It's good. #NewDay
721805235891478528 2016-04-17 20:59:13 UTC <Laurentia> Ten miles downhill on bike and I am more beat up than ten miles on the flat pedaling. Even the dog is in bed recovering. Braking is so hard.
721259175997603840 2016-04-16 08:49:22 UTC <Laurentia> I tweet because I am anonymous here. I have other delusions too: Tweeting is the same as a social life, an anonymous social life. #ITweeted
721223955118301185 2016-04-15 06:29:25 UTC <Laurentia> Is a thought annoyance the same thing as a headache the Dr. asks about? A pain in the brain vs a pain in my thinking? Is there a difference?
721222383936208896 2016-04-15 06:23:10 UTC <Laurentia> So on the second day of unemployment I drank wine and coffee. Talk about animated nonsense.  Let's see if weed saves the day. Woot. #NewDay
721014792916312064 2016-04-15 16:38:17 UTC <Laurentia> Okay, in a surprise turn, I became unemployed yesterday. What am I going to use for the bane of my existence? It it a new adventure. #NewDay
720748210910724096 2016-04-14 22:58:58 UTC <Laurentia> Deyo, deyo.. deeeeyo. Deyo Reservoir on a rainy spring day is gorgeous in it's solitude accented by a loon crooning.pic.twitter.com/vRLffSgROI
719720234131677184 2016-04-11 02:54:10 UTC <Laurentia> Dr. told me to ride my bike more. I cruised in the sun. Then returned to a half pan of brownies after a quarter pan ride. #CycleDeficitAgain
719334739778207745 2016-04-10 01:22:21 UTC <Laurentia> Full body mountain bike workout, it was gorgeous. I feel justified in eating a half a pan of brownies now. I already ate a banana, I'm good.
716770528703307776 2016-04-03 23:33:05 UTC <Laurentia> I love the hunger that results from physical exertion (riding my bike); rather than the faux hunger that is really me just not feeling full.
715775983052259328 2016-03-31 05:41:07 UTC <Laurentia> Wandered off with a pad and some paint. Boy it's been too long. My painting muscles are flabby. Need some light drawing before oil. #makeart
705523367990861825 2016-03-03 22:40:53 UTC <Laurentia> My brain is my biggest asset and my biggest enemy. It wanders often and wreaks havoc. It can also focus on a most perfect thought. #dualism?
701988167524569088 2016-02-22 04:33:16 UTC <Laurentia> Stuffing my brain with knowledge is not making it more quiet. I need to plan a vacation where wifi does not reach. Possibly even electricity
700792594133987328 2016-02-19 21:22:29 UTC <Laurentia> I am here, I am here, I am here. I break into my oneness. Welcome to all of me, and that includes you. #ExistentialGoodness
700517706508832769 2016-02-18 03:10:10 UTC <Laurentia> Why IPA why? I just wanted you inside me and after now you treat me like this. I should have done  #NationalDrinkWineDay
698941772655779840 2016-02-14 18:47:58 UTC <Laurentia> Buckle up kids, we are in for a wild ride. Political rhetoric lies. Things are going to get crazier as the truth sets us free. #LoveWillWin
696381954770382848 2016-02-07 17:16:10 UTC <Laurentia> @TamarHaspel @tamarhaspel You do not speak for me, I want labeling. I am now growing most of my own because I can't trust what I am buying. #LabelIt
695765080806326272 2016-02-05 00:24:56 UTC <Laurentia> Slowly I am coming to realize that everything we know and have ever learned may be a lie. Luckily, now that we know, we can #CreateANewTruth
