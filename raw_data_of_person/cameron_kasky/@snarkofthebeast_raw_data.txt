968912197576347649 2018-02-28 18:14:04 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SeattleSinBin You're right. I'm still bitter though. Maybe senselessly so, but screw it. It's my thing.

I DO however believe that @DonaldJTrumpJr and @EricTrump would have run in there, guns a-blazin', if you'd told them a rare Eastern Cougar had been spotted.
968186104825315328 2018-02-26 18:08:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @missoliviablack I say go for it.
968178680466833414 2018-02-26 17:39:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @jfreewright Naw, they'll probably just make up pithy justifications to excuse the remark. I've seen it all before. Nothing means anything anymore.
968178352065413120 2018-02-26 17:38:01 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS you've told some whoppers but you running into an active shooter situation...let me just say, if you need a lying coach I'm available. I could really help you steer clear of some of these outlandish and unnecessary entanglements you get yourself into.

967985933399113728 2018-02-25 04:53:25 UTC <snarkofthebeast> #Olympics introduced me to some new athletes to keep an eye on. But I'll miss you most of all Scarecrow (i.e. @JohnnyGWeir).
967965226778816513 2018-02-25 03:31:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It's these moments where it helps to remember that the #Olympics are not the IOC, it's about the athletes. Try to put all the bullshit behind, the politics, the money and just focus on the pure athleticism.
967961110891577344 2018-02-25 03:14:47 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Well Trumpkins DID say they wanted transparency.

967235885526691841 2018-02-23 03:13:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I had a tossed salad for dinner. It wasn't tossed until AFTER I tripped walking up the stairs with it.
967233019198152704 2018-02-23 03:01:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I almost can't resist watching a Home Alone movie (1 or 2, it should go without saying). I just watched Home Alone 2 for the 12 billionth time and bellowed like it was the first time all over again.

She should just go full GG Allin and come out flipping the bird, blowing snot rockets and throwing her feces at the crowd. They'd probably appreciate it.

But as a gun owner and/or an NRA member if you're not embarrassed and dismayed at their tone deafness and the way they've reacted in the wake of #Parkland you're an asshole.

966145542412582913 2018-02-20 03:00:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I find the idea of this groundswell of Trump support to be precious in the light of Republican seats being gobbled up by Dems in traditionally red districts. It's almost like @POTUS is not as popular in the US as he lets on.

964247693072637952 2018-02-15 21:18:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Whenever a shooting happens the @GOP, @NRA, @FoxNews "personalities" and conservatives at large say it's too soon to have the gun discussion, have respect for the victims. This is great because there's a shooting almost every month so at this rate they can keep this up forever.

Opportunity that the landscape of Trump's administration affords them. But they were surely amoral and unethical before all this.

961816416264470529 2018-02-08 04:17:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Are we really shocked the @WhiteHouse took a soft stance on a reported wife beater? I mean, his boss admitted on tape he likes to sexually accost women because he can. Didn't disqualify him from the highest office in the land.
961815600602296325 2018-02-08 04:14:43 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @happyloner To be fair to Trump, he's probably busying himself packing his bags for Mar-a-Lago.

961779168529629184 2018-02-08 01:49:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ADAMDEVINE Oh fine.
961779041060532224 2018-02-08 01:49:27 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Put simply, another country decided who they were going to throw OUR election in favor of. And if you don't care or have decided you're fine with the outcome regardless of the means then that tells us all we need to know about you. You are not patriotic OR American.
961777908539842560 2018-02-08 01:44:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> What @FoxNews is deliberately forgetting is that 4 security agencies have concluded that Russia did meddle in our election - not JUST the @FBI - and that intercession was heavily in favor of Trump. So whether or not someone sought to politicize the narrative is incidental.
961774837352955905 2018-02-08 01:32:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Trump/Hannity love affair can best be described as an ouroboros of two men 69ing one another.
961769280877416448 2018-02-08 01:10:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It will be interesting if/when we find out these text messages were either presented without context of wholly fabricated to see @FoxNews keep harping on them. 
961768888252825601 2018-02-08 01:09:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The only way it WILL matter to Trump is if a vocal consensus is reached wherein ALL of the credit for his ascension is given to Russia, and then his huge, stupid ego will intervene because he can't let that sit.
961768447259459584 2018-02-08 01:07:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> No doubt @POTUS will remain mum on this.https://twitter.com/AP/status/961381886600851457
961766800487665667 2018-02-08 01:00:48 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS doesn't give a fuck. It's all a means to an end for him. So if they conspired to help put him in the @WhiteHouse (or if he thinks they helped) he's not going to spend TOO much of his time worrying about it.https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/961385370448429057
961763819717406720 2018-02-08 00:48:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If you consciously have to spin negatives into positives or figure out how something bad is the last guy's fault then you know you're not the home of ethical or responsible reporting. I'm constantly amazed how @FoxNews still finds ways to surprise me on that front. So kudos.

That's not how that works.
960541092293763074 2018-02-05 15:50:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SPonzilloTV I seriously heard someone say something which was immediately refuted and their response was "Well it's MY truth." Um, no. There's truth and then there's your unwillingness to accept truth.

They like their facts to be chewed up and spit into their minds like baby birds.
959883300864081920 2018-02-03 20:16:27 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This is a good read (and I TOO am very disappointed in Tarantino) but that last paragraph is especially good.https://twitter.com/JeffreyVeregge/status/959878175806210048

959516674595569664 2018-02-02 19:59:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS hey, I gotta thank you for tanking the market today for the release of this inconsequential memo which by no means clears you of any wrongdoing. 
959510082840010753 2018-02-02 19:33:25 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The @GOP is devouring itself. If a dog exhibited the same behavior you would put it down.

959472472394424320 2018-02-02 17:03:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> All of the people at the head of this Russia investigation are Republicans so when @POTUS claims there's some vast conspiracy going on against him he's lying. Unless the conspiracy is to out abject stupidity. In which case, carry on Mr. Trump.
959465086862573574 2018-02-02 16:34:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Curious because this will all come out when @POTUS releases the memo. Seriously Donnie, you need to get better at lying. If you need a coach, do let me know.https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/959449575319789572

This is that, only with the longevity of human existence.

954877804012695552 2018-01-20 00:46:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS, @VP so does this mean you guys are taking credit for all the domestic terrorism? Cool.https://twitter.com/davidsirota/status/954833419384455168
954874529435721729 2018-01-20 00:33:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I remember distinctly being told be a Trump supporter just before the election "Must be nice for you having money in retirement". These are the same people celebrating a factor they dismissed as being germane to only elites.

948660514325856256 2018-01-03 21:01:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Paul Manafort suing Mueller is a bit like the seal biting the orca's tongue as it slides down its throat.

947909209969983488 2018-01-01 19:15:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This isn't working out quite the way they'd hoped.https://twitter.com/GOP/status/947630957925928960
947907421921349632 2018-01-01 19:08:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Watched Joe Swanberg's Easy on Netflix last night. I like some of his acting work but his preoccupation with sex is compulsive and at the same time boring as fuck. I don't know how he manages it.

945849877430276096 2017-12-26 02:52:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trumpservatives think liberal elites and Hollywood types hate Trump because, in effect, he has them in his crosshairs. So why, I wonder, did he give them a massive tax break and why are they still railing against them?   
945847293760040960 2017-12-26 02:42:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This is a pointless rollback. @POTUS is just deregulating things to look like he's fucking doing something while he dispassionately fucks Americans in the ass without the goddamn common courtesy of a reacharound.https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/945642712174333952

945840111375204352 2017-12-26 02:13:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> And @POTUS has bolstered these claims, cited this #FakeNews and RT it, giving it the illusion of credibility. So we needn't question where his allegiances lie. At BEST he's out for himself. That's the best case scenario. The worst hints at something far more nefarious.
945839408573399040 2017-12-26 02:11:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Well the @GOP did a lot of the heavy lifting, converting and weaponizing conservatives to reject their own best interests.

938595935411564544 2017-12-06 02:28:03 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It's not that I care about the opinions of others, it's that I care TOO much about stupid people thinking they're right.

938595501418602497 2017-12-06 02:26:20 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser I tried but it's not possible to get close enough to that headspace with out trepanning myself. So that's where we're at.
938591211492843520 2017-12-06 02:09:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> That's fine. I'm ok with you thinking that. I'll still be doing the work while you whittle down your ranks and float off into space.
938590703399059456 2017-12-06 02:07:16 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SydniDeveraux Well, now I guess I've been in one of those. Can I mark that down on my rsum?
938590519768137728 2017-12-06 02:06:32 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I was always toward the middle of the political spectrum but felt I was firmly in the Left that there was no question where I resided. But this abrupt acceleration, and the expectation of everyone to keep pace or be labeled an enemy has missed me.
938587910206472193 2017-12-06 01:56:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SydniDeveraux AND if you do pay, there's a lot of evidence that shows it's a racket anyway that doesn't grant you actual interest in your business but instead your audience is given access to "Like farms" of people who never have any intention of patronize your business or service anyway.
938587207203307520 2017-12-06 01:53:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> And I think now is as good a time as ever to dust this off so the dum-dum Alt-Right knuckledraggers know where I stand on them: On their necks.https://twitter.com/snarkofthebeast/status/768872030598856704
938585415845519360 2017-12-06 01:46:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Now seems like a good idea to RT this as I have progressives without any objectivity breathing down my neck.  In short, liberals are equal opportunity except where it pertains to them not being right some of the time.https://twitter.com/snarkofthebeast/status/937739575509651456
938583388331556864 2017-12-06 01:38:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> "But you used the word "liberal" in a dismissive fashion and fed the opposition."  I underscored the inconsistencies in your message. Being mad at this is like being mad at the history book author for "normalizing" the Nazis.
938582075505983488 2017-12-06 01:32:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Seems like Trump is going to spend as much time in court as president as he did a private citizen.https://twitter.com/komonews/status/938581523007078400
938581740154601474 2017-12-06 01:31:39 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm conflicted over this one but there does seem to be some correlation between a firestorm on the Left and bad news on the horizon for Trump, so maybe....? https://twitter.com/JenKirkman/status/938454344118149120
938580880481599488 2017-12-06 01:28:14 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This seems like a very reasoned argument, Benji.https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/938539813220777986
938579411649011712 2017-12-06 01:22:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Could I have used a word other than "liberals"? Sure, but it wouldn't have impressed the point the way I thought it should have been. If I had, those same people would have gone merrily along there way. But I didn't. And as a result it's all "Not all ____!"
938578287449726976 2017-12-06 01:17:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But then the pursuit that most of these people hold in the highest regard is self importance. One's one perfection doesn't matter as much as the perceived IMPERFECTION of someone else.
938577628348350464 2017-12-06 01:15:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Couple this with the fact that much of progressive liberals don't have a codified belief system so what seems in line with the core beliefs of one doesn't pass muster with another. It's virtually impossible to agree on who one's allies are.
938577279306809344 2017-12-06 01:13:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I've noticed that as the party shifts further and further to the left the people who WERE on the left begin to look, to the perspective of the fringe, as being on the right of center.
938576737775976448 2017-12-06 01:11:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> As a left leaning person, that's always been the part that's most amused me about liberals is their sense of humor....when you're making fun of anyone but them. But boy, you satirize them and they come unglued. 
938576047120904194 2017-12-06 01:09:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @IndyPowerRankin @strongstylebrit @thejtdunn @The_MJF @TheAceyBaby @OfficialEGO @StrongStyleB @TheJoshBriggs @allgoodag @RealJeffCobb @LWMaine That's the look of a man who probably smells fantastic.

938539372516745216 2017-12-06 22:43:18 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Ah, so if you deny it, even if the exact amount of "sufficient evidence" in your case matched the sufficient evidence in cases across the aisle and/or you were banned from a mall for that very reason, you're in the clear. You hear that? Just deny it and it's all good.  https://twitter.com/NatHemel/status/938484487654174720

938528619881644032 2017-12-06 22:00:34 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NickRojasVO Oh yeah. I wouldn't worry TOO much. However it still remains to be seen IF they would let 21th Century Fox conduct itself in a similar fashion as a separate and independent subsidiary.
938526493847707648 2017-12-06 21:52:07 UTC <snarkofthebeast> And you DAMN sure won't see Wade show up in any Disney parks. 
938526234790658048 2017-12-06 21:51:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Miramax was a subsidiary of Disney. It put out Clerks, Pulp Fiction, Kids, Priest, Sirens, Exotica and Trainspotting. So it's not INCONVENIENCE they will 20th Century Fox and allow it to operate as its own entity. You just won't see Deadpool crossover into the MCU.https://twitter.com/NickRojasVO/status/938523446321008640

938081676927700992 2017-12-05 16:24:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This sentence particularly struck me: "The Party of Lincoln now exists to help Neo-Confederates win the Civil War politically, long after losing it on the battlefield."https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisladd/2017/12/02/the-gop-has-become-a-dangerous-cult/#a40630245c1b
938079256101318656 2017-12-05 16:14:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Good morning Trump. This is your daily affirmation that you're an illegitimate @POTUS. 
938078228505174016 2017-12-05 16:10:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @AjitPaiFCC have fun parceling out the internet to your wealthy cronies today. 
938075472503513088 2017-12-05 15:59:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @TheEmilyBloom I still have yet to do that. Wondering if it's worth it now.
937865193761136640 2017-12-04 02:04:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @TheEmilyBloom @Richard31316163 Presumably, yes.
937832572452716544 2017-12-04 23:54:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @AaronQ13Fox Well damn. The one thing I agree with her on.
937830247084388357 2017-12-04 23:45:29 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @happyloner I mean, if you possess any objectivity.
937830139601199104 2017-12-04 23:45:03 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @happyloner Even if people hated him, thought he was an idiot and destroyed the country (kind of hard to justify that as we're more divided as a nation now than we were then) you can't deny he's head and shoulders more articulate than Trump.

937807403860373504 2017-12-04 22:14:43 UTC <snarkofthebeast> According to @AjitPaiFCC if you want #NetNeutrality you're "desperate".

937769930681806849 2017-12-04 19:45:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS Because make no mistake about it, the sole objective of an oligarchy is to put its boot on the neck of the working class and press them into indentured servitude.  So on behalf of most of America who didn't vote for this, thanks for your petulant revenge vote.
937769040457560064 2017-12-04 19:42:16 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS' supporters elected him to shrink the size of government and ironically he's extending government's reach. But I guess when you're all the slave class you won't have to worry about jobs anymore.

937764464920686592 2017-12-04 19:24:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @netflix @linnieloowho It's not even like he's really a good actor. I mean, realistically yanking the Kevin Spacey band-aid off hurt the company way more but they pulled the trigger on that right quick. This should be a lay-up.  Plus he's a Scientologist so there's even more incentive. 
937761669488324608 2017-12-04 19:12:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @taylorswift13 is, ironically, the only person who could take what is traditionally a sexy Xmas song in Santa Baby and render it in such a banal fashion that it sounds like Kidz Bop Christmas Classics.

937752070681063424 2017-12-04 18:34:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @RoseMooreWrites I guess she did me a kindness in her exit being so cold and ruthless in that it was easy to hate her. There was very little heartbreak on my end of things.
937750961426067457 2017-12-04 18:30:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @RoseMooreWrites At this point in my life I don't really know what I saw in that one. She was a vegan who didn't drink and hated horror films. What was I thinking?
937750407220047872 2017-12-04 18:28:14 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @RoseMooreWrites When my person cut and run on me I didn't spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get to the root of it. I was pissed, said fuck her and got on with my life.
937750068144123904 2017-12-04 18:26:53 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @RoseMooreWrites And as a guy who has been sorta/kinda ghosted (long story but we weren't together but that prospect had been discussed), after the initial confusion over what has happened passes (which when you think of it should be quick), you shouldn't WANT to track them down.

937071307891421185 2017-12-02 21:29:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This #TaxBill is so bad that, by way of example, if you really wanted to hurt the Clintons you'd have to not pass it.
937070588845113344 2017-12-02 21:26:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> You know, and what's amusing is that I don't hear a single Republican really standing up for it with facts, figures, graphs, tables...

932778252170444801 2017-11-20 01:10:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Funny thing about @AjitPaiFCC, see he doesn't answer to the American people so he doesn't care about you. He only cares about his wealthy benefactors and they want the internet you know and love.https://twitter.com/cbudoffbrown/status/932769009900179457
932777320015839232 2017-11-20 01:06:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If @DonaldJTrumpJr is found guilty we should send him to RUSSIAN prison, not the cushy American institutions we got here.

932775544076111872 2017-11-20 00:59:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FO_VVerhei I wonder if Keith was picking up those fish at the store when I saw him earlier today.
932756189779173376 2017-11-20 23:43:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS you do NOT want to reap the whirlwind that is @MommaLynch24.   On the other hand, do, and maybe the problem of YOU will take care of itself.
932755508301148160 2017-11-20 23:40:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Last night I saw several people I know in real life on Anthony Bourdain's show. Today I saw TV's Capt. Keith from Deadliest Catch at the grocery store.

932713853808386048 2017-11-20 20:54:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @pattonoswalt Yeah. That's totally weird. I wonder why that is. 
932712853445816320 2017-11-20 20:50:47 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @briannahilde They've kind of lost their steam when people discovered the grift - that they're a family of lawyers, not an actual church - and stopped taking the bait.
932712550571032576 2017-11-20 20:49:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Yeah, especially when they remember you didn't do you basic duties as @POTUS to rebuild their home, Trump. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/932691415636815872
932711808103620608 2017-11-20 20:46:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Ahem, @SarahHuckabee, @POTUS doesn't HAVE an agenda. He's a chaos agent.https://twitter.com/axios/status/932710433034833920
932711535176069120 2017-11-20 20:45:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FO_VVerhei I feel bad for the guy in red. He was so close so many times.

932693789465911296 2017-11-20 19:35:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FO_VVerhei As opposed to the President being a brainless twat and the VP as uptight as a clenched sphincter.

932646700954431488 2017-11-20 16:27:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @KSLibraryGirl If only there had been some kind of warning signs that he would be a useless, narcissistic poopy baby.
932640241126535168 2017-11-20 16:02:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @shopDisney I probably should have got what I was looking at in the park because I don't find it on the website now (even though I'm check the site AND app concurrently). I'll just have to get something else what with Xmas looming. Time is of the essence.
932639134933336064 2017-11-20 15:57:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS hey, thanks for hastening the decline of America by lowering its status from without and dividing and weakening it from within. Really masterfully done.

932499660568125445 2017-11-19 06:43:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Alaskamauve It'd be a bummer to see you go.
932487774338408448 2017-11-19 05:56:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So Manson is dead. Too bad. Missed that @POTUS pardon.
932470245343731713 2017-11-19 04:46:45 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Sure am glad @POTUS views his post as merely a way to expand his asshole brand.https://twitter.com/Trump/status/931587623071748098

932409396792999936 2017-11-19 00:44:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @xxxorcist_ That's just craziness. That's a mark in your favor where I come from.
932401479784136705 2017-11-19 00:13:30 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If @Disney wants to call all their @Marvel properties in from the cold, the very least they can do is remake Iron Fist.
932365772176760832 2017-11-19 21:51:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @AlexShipppp Actually that's pretty accurate.
932364304539574272 2017-11-19 21:45:47 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I can't help but think that if nobody had ever told @POTUS not to run with scissors when he was young we wouldn't be having this problem now.
932355780195393536 2017-11-19 21:11:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS My point is, the same thing that guided H.H. Holmes - sociopathic levels of narcissism and selfishness - are now the guiding principle of President Trump.  So in short, thanks for your vote to make an amoral grifter with potential to kill many times more people our President.
932351522607808512 2017-11-19 20:54:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> In 2006 @POTUS cheated architect Andrew Tesoro out of thousands of dollars for his designs for his golf clubhouse in Briarcliff Manor, NY.  Dr. H.H. Holmes would stiff merchants by defaulting on payment and hiding their furnishings.  H.H. Holmes was America's first serial killer.

932334248563916800 2017-11-19 19:46:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FO_VVerhei You mean to tell me that the guy who operated under the "team of dirtbags" ethic is guilty of being not so nice?
932331456709271552 2017-11-19 19:35:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @missannabiller As far as I'm concerned if a movie entertained you, it was a good movie. But I guess people can take that with a grain of salt because Ed Wood is, by very dint of this, one of my favorite filmmakers.
932322454189379584 2017-11-19 18:59:29 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser Actually, both look good. I can't decide.
932166005228367872 2017-11-19 08:37:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> #ThorRagnorak was terrific. @Marvel, you let @TaikaWaititi direct anything he wants from here on out.

929962713844822021 2017-11-12 06:42:43 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Joe Bob Briggs once said something which I think applies here. He said "Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity."https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/929936124298088453
929962276597014529 2017-11-12 06:40:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Haha! Oh man, that's rich. Imagine being a Christian and having to eat this much crow because Trump is as close as you have ever gotten to having a blank check for your ideals.https://twitter.com/DearAuntCrabby/status/929835854536892416
929961160236924930 2017-11-12 06:36:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Mediaite I'm not offended. Have you TASTED the coffee that comes out of a Keurig, @seanhannity? No, probably not. I bet you're some dilettante who has his beans flown in and drinks from a demitasse with his pinkie sticking out like some effete noble twat.
929952135323594752 2017-11-12 06:00:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> #TWD has done a TERRIBLE job of letting the viewers really know the state of The Saviors and whether this siege was a win or not.

929795962553344000 2017-11-12 19:40:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I thought they were going to do a dramatic reenactment of The Human Centipede. What a letdown.https://twitter.com/roywoodjr/status/929794884709515265
929794481716465664 2017-11-12 19:34:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But abhorrent ideals don't need your attention to proliferate. All safe spaces do is allow them to strengthen and grow their numbers in secret while you remain blissfully ignorant and unable to combat them later when you ARE confronted with them.
929793933374189569 2017-11-12 19:32:03 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It's that more than choking out the enemy, depriving them of the oxygen with which to espouse their views. They don't have the strength of their own convictions and so must create a bubble to insulate them from opposing thought.
929793387422560256 2017-11-12 19:29:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> They proliferate as they are granted so that the people they harbor can have a hivemind network of people who only think, talk and act like them. So they never have to worry about how to talk to someone with abhorrent ideas. They become intellectually "flabby".
929792650844057600 2017-11-12 19:26:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> "Safe spaces" should be called what they really are: Echo chambers.
929782920696365057 2017-11-12 18:48:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @KellyannePolls everyone except your boss you mean. You really have to put an asterisk after these remarks.https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/929775934982455296

929780151994408960 2017-11-12 18:37:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @IFC The most precious thing about this movie is that the ending makes it obvious the filmmakers thought they were going to get another bite at the apple.pic.twitter.com/oKgKZRCdOY
929778313731571712 2017-11-12 18:29:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @IFC The biggest butchery besides the makers killing the franchise is in IFC's editing of it. Way to go. Well done. 
929775156876079104 2017-11-12 18:17:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hellraiser Revelations is on @IFC but near as I can tell the only "revelation" is that a sentient human being wrote this.

929621040006799365 2017-11-12 08:05:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Which means, quite possibly, that when @POTUS was being a traitor he was even lying whilst doing it.https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/929400818473644032

929110047392538624 2017-11-10 22:14:31 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @TheRealXPac I suspect @GeraldoRivera's case for Roy Moore contains as much substance as Al Capone's vault.

911820051753295872 2017-09-23 05:10:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS Point of fact, Trump is out of his depth as to what to do in the wake of all these disasters so he invents some new drama to attend to.

911804871736623104 2017-09-23 04:09:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm going to live to be able to take a massive coiler on Trump's grave.  Assuming he doesn't get us all annihilated in the meantime.

911672592263548928 2017-09-23 19:24:18 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Make no mistake, the sanitation of expression is liberals trying to undermine their enemies on the right. A controlled burn, if you will.

911377973470625792 2017-09-22 23:53:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> By and large, the arbiters of humor are themselves not funny and in general also not fun to be around.

908459550579163137 2017-09-14 22:36:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Electing Trump was the Trumpservatives attempt to cure an ingrown toenail by nuking the immune system.

907969887582134273 2017-09-13 14:11:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So...#BillSkarsgardforJoker? Let's get that trending.

907865863168040960 2017-09-13 07:17:43 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm betting a lot of these Trumplodytes are having a difficult time dealing with their newfound fame.pic.twitter.com/zBULQ4dfb9
907838451571216386 2017-09-12 05:28:48 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But now that I've just come out of it, I can say, with the utmost assuredness....I was wrong. This movie is fantastic.
907838080849248257 2017-09-12 05:27:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> In fact the only reason I went to see this movie in theaters was, to be honest, the theater was next to a bar I wanted to go to.
907837864821608448 2017-09-12 05:26:28 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So I would continue to have no connection to the source material all the way through my adult life.
907837650475868161 2017-09-12 05:25:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But my thoughts were then as they are now: Largely an ambivalence. Aside from Tim Curry, what did the 1990 It really have to recommend it?
907837141421625346 2017-09-12 05:23:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But back to the original miniseries. I was a monster kid and looked forward to it (or IT) with great enthusiasm.

905745524698914816 2017-09-07 10:52:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It's 3 a.m. and once again my entire hilltop is out of power for no particular reason at all.

905678498701877249 2017-09-06 06:25:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> When you SAY "problematic" what I HEAR is "I'm just complaining". Because if it was a problem you'd have said it was a problem.
905672766724030465 2017-09-06 06:03:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I want all the #BloodDrive merch now. Shirts. Hoodies. DVDs. Comics. The board game. Prophylactics. Whatever.
905671476820320256 2017-09-06 05:58:01 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Thank you, #BloodDrive.  @SYFY, no thanks to you.

905651943921508354 2017-09-06 04:40:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @dalmatianjaws I just read the news (which sucks because I haven't even watched the finale yet).

891754341995913216 2017-07-30 20:16:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So it's not JUST the Left. Most of America didn't vote for this clown AND the Right, as evidenced by the National Review, has no confidence.

891044589406007296 2017-07-28 21:15:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump becoming @POTUS and @KidRock running for Senate is life imitating FART, amirite?
891042690082553857 2017-07-28 21:08:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> N. Korea is launching missiles to antagonize the US and meanwhile we got @KidRock running for Senate.
891040729631412224 2017-07-28 21:00:39 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So @Scaramucci was right, @Reince45 just got the ax. Which means he was probably telling the truth about #Bannon trying to blow himself.

887396006312132609 2017-07-18 19:37:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> To wit, Republicans hold both houses of Congress. Which means the plans before them are so shoddy no one wants to take credit for them.
887394679301353472 2017-07-18 19:32:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Just heard on the radio from Trump supporter: "The Democrats should stand aside and let Trump do his work."
887394323171389445 2017-07-18 19:31:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I intensely dislike the sight of Trump's angry, puckered little face-sphincter.
887322510059896833 2017-07-18 14:45:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The only history modern conservatives are interested in is the Constitution.

878360077811408896 2017-06-23 21:12:16 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Right ALSO likes to assume that quaint tack of the brother who lands the last shot and then calls "truce" in front of your parents.
878359743777062912 2017-06-23 21:10:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Right likes to use the Left's magnanimity against it. Because in so doing they believe it gets them off the hook.

875165836985618432 2017-06-14 01:39:29 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The words "domestic terrorism" are to @FoxNews like "I love you" to the unrepentant bachelor in a bad romcom.
875164996761665536 2017-06-14 01:36:09 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Or, on the other hand, be non-white, left leaning and/or have one of those "weird religions".
875164718054244353 2017-06-14 01:35:03 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Naw, they'll say it was unconfirmed and we "have to wait for all the data to come in". Then they'll refuse to acknowledge it further.
875164309013135360 2017-06-14 01:33:25 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Commit a heinous act of violence while citing Trump's America for the reasoning?
875163800176959488 2017-06-14 01:31:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> What's it take for @FoxNews to finally say those all important words: Domestic terrorism?
875162691207274497 2017-06-14 01:26:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser That escalated quickly.
875162431282008066 2017-06-14 01:25:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I love how @FoxNews - who incidentally didn't even WANT Trump as President - has now become his official spin dept.
875161682955321344 2017-06-14 01:22:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But make no mistake. They don't care. For the same reasons they can only remember the NAME Benghazi and not the names of those killed there.
875161320928059392 2017-06-14 01:21:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trust me, conservatives are THRILLED that this happened. This is their best ammunition yet to fight back against the Left.
875161080154120194 2017-06-14 01:20:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Right is like that shitty little brother who keeps taking swipes at you and then playing the victim when mom and dad are around.
875160759377866752 2017-06-14 01:19:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FoxNews quick to use today to accuse the Left of domestic terrorism. I see you're eager to erase all doubt of that "fair & balanced" motto.
875159253127909376 2017-06-14 01:13:20 UTC <snarkofthebeast> "Let's look at the definition of terrorism and call this what it is, liberal terrorism." Oh, so NOW you believe in domestic terrorism.
875158903687794689 2017-06-14 01:11:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> "We should take a step back and tone down our rhetoric and our anger to find the root cause of all this...liberals." @FoxNews

870743081758228480 2017-06-02 20:45:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Most times Andrew was completely overlooked for the inclusion of Weiland who really only came around after "grunge" was already hot.
870742827721867264 2017-06-02 20:44:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I keep hearing Scott mentioned in conjunction with Chris, Layne, Kurt and (sometimes) Andrew Wood. And that's only SOMETIMES for Andy.
870742475991687168 2017-06-02 20:42:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Now that some time has passed, can we admit that Scott Weiland doesn't need to be in the same conversation as Chris Cornell.

855127756341780480 2017-04-20 18:35:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So Ted Nugent, Sarah Palin and Kid Rock walk into the Oval Office. I swear this is not a joke....actually it still kinda is.
855096349083049984 2017-04-20 16:30:31 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @oreillyfactor blames Leftist agenda for his ouster and he's right. With their aversion to being sexually harassed. The gall of them!

854878601753247745 2017-04-19 02:05:16 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @oreillyfactor so hey, how am I going to find out if I won the contest of guessing where you went on vacation???
854828092010844160 2017-04-19 22:44:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @FINALLEVEL @itswhitneymeyer I'd prefer not to.
854827180827607044 2017-04-19 22:40:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @MegoLand It's somewhat late (because the con in question is next month) but I'm thinking ahead because I know they want to feature more cosplay.
854826920382414848 2017-04-19 22:39:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Somewhere @TuckerCarlson is thrilled at @oreillyfactor's dismissal because he gets to be @FoxNews' @jasonrantz.

854157443521167360 2017-04-17 02:19:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Starting to get the feeling that winning the Presidency was the Make A Wish for a billionaire suffering from late stage dementia.
853398586188414976 2017-04-15 00:04:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But because of it's flaws someone decided to derail a whole other film (Sucicide Squad).  I hope that person is homeless now.
853398338107883521 2017-04-15 00:03:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Just watched Batman v Superman for the first time. It was not a film without it's flaws but it was also unfairly maligned.

853007617559478274 2017-04-14 22:10:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser I seem to recall hearing on X-Files that Pocatello is a safe distance from a prospective nuclear strike.
853006966272086017 2017-04-14 22:08:03 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Just bought tix to @horisontmusic. I hope that wasn't a waste and we all get nuked before I see them.
852994302472933376 2017-04-14 21:17:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> You know of course that if N. Korea nukes the West Coast Trump supporters will laugh it off as "incidetal damage" so it's all over.
852954758457376768 2017-04-14 18:40:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @TheEmilyBloom Yup.
852954701775622144 2017-04-14 18:40:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @bubble_letters I like your spirit.
852954540076703744 2017-04-14 18:39:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS oh and hey, definitely don't worry about N. Korea during your three day vacation. I'm sure that situation will iron itself out. 
852952691722436608 2017-04-14 18:32:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS have you given any thought to who you're going to bomb this weekend from Mar a Lago over cake that taxpayers paid for?

825463127605022720 2017-01-28 21:58:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I will accept your resignation @POTUS.  And yours as well @SpeakerRyan, @VP, @Reince et al. You Chip Kelly'd the US.
825461366471352321 2017-01-28 21:51:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hey @POTUS, for tips on how to handle success when the deck is stacked in your favor, maybe consult your buddy Tom Brady on the @Patriots.

825453321641025536 2017-01-28 21:19:42 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS I thought you said you were going to ELIMINATE ISIS.  I'm curious as to why you chose instead to embolden and strengthen them?

824779252625059841 2017-01-26 00:41:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SophiaBush I think the most telling part was where he called the people he - and Trump - rose to power on "Working class Hobbits".
824778287851331584 2017-01-26 00:37:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trump: "I think torture methods work but will defer to my Defense Minister."  Mattis "Torture doesn't work."  Trump "Fuck your shit Mattis!"
824756960138457089 2017-01-26 23:12:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Since Trump's policies have been proven not to work from every expert in that field, we have to look to his true aims here.

823235602451546113 2017-01-22 18:27:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trump cannot HAVE the presidency he wants without press to tell it to.  He needs them more than he lets on.
823235366903627776 2017-01-22 18:26:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The press core needs to keep pushing back.  Force their hand.  They won't ban everyone because fire needs oxygen.
823234805886107648 2017-01-22 18:24:07 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @POTUS is weaving an elaborate fiction and @KellyannePolls is his ghostwriter.  Look for it on bookstore shelves under American History.

822551948842954760 2017-01-20 21:10:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> We should just go ahead and outlaw protest so RW hardliners can see their chickens come home to roost when a Dem is elected to President.

809586881578971136 2016-12-15 02:32:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Ribir22 I should think that if criminal charges were levied against a sitting President that impeachment proceedings would soon follow
809586432968835072 2016-12-15 02:30:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Ribir22 It was more a joke than anything else.
809582259741175809 2016-12-15 02:13:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Ribir22 If that's just it, he's probably safe.  Clinton wriggled off that hook, didn't he? 
809534002809872385 2016-12-15 23:02:01 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So what I'm getting is that it doesn't resemble the "real world" of the faux wood paneled environs of their mum's and dad's basement.https://twitter.com/TechnicallyRon/status/809034290474455041
809522787635204096 2016-12-15 22:17:27 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Allen_Clifton You are my absolute favorite person on Twitter today.
809521939928649728 2016-12-15 22:14:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Brought to you by the letters USS & R and the numbers 12/30/1922https://twitter.com/Allen_Clifton/status/809250815760273408
809518646326214656 2016-12-15 22:01:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> You were hoodwinked.  Bamboozled.  And a bunch of other old-timey euphemisms for "You just got F'd in the A!"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/809433292722171904
809467108790673408 2016-12-15 18:36:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SPonzilloTV It was shortly after that that I noticed I was blocked.
809467050712145920 2016-12-15 18:35:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SPonzilloTV I've despised the man for years but it was around the time of his Twitter feud with Danny Zuker that I gave him both barrels.
809461684448305152 2016-12-15 18:14:39 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SPonzilloTV A year or so ago.  It was definitely BEFORE he announced his run for President.
809460609477537792 2016-12-15 18:10:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I can't read the Tweet, because of course he has me blocked, but he's predictable enough that I can see it clearly in my head. https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/809449023983779840
809459830893092864 2016-12-15 18:07:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Brought my leftovers in an aluminum tray only to remember my workplace doesn't have paper plates so I feel like I'm in a Greek tragedy.

809453047491358721 2016-12-15 17:40:20 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @amberleighwest Artful blocking.  Well done. 
809151501155188736 2016-12-14 21:42:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @kaniehtiio I still need to watch that.  It's especially prescient for these times we now find ourselves in.

808825608624971780 2016-12-13 00:07:07 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ShannonMarlyse I'd actually welcome him.  After all he spent most of his college years occupying various administration buildings.
808816316580663296 2016-12-13 23:30:11 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump is like having relations with a frat bro: Always be aware of where both hands are at all times.
808812150567235584 2016-12-13 23:13:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> That's a good one.  Eartha Kitt was always my favorite Catwoman.

808809896837726208 2016-12-13 23:04:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @cbgirl19 I'm guessing 2017 will be no less busy to allow for it. I guess I should hope it isn't so I'm conflicted.
808809429013405696 2016-12-13 23:02:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I assume that we're about to (not) hear about some horrendous shit @realDonaldTrump has been or is currently involved in.
808809202806198272 2016-12-13 23:01:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Don't be fooled by this @kanyewest news.  ALWAYS pay attention to the man behind the curtain when the man in question is @realDonaldTrump.
808800006979211265 2016-12-13 22:25:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump won't have a legacy like Nixon after all this.  Nixon was at least a good bowler.
808750062209642496 2016-12-13 19:06:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I hope it is.  Not for you, but for my retirement savings.  It's the only reserves I got.
808749850493788160 2016-12-13 19:06:04 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The people who voted for Trump because they were desperate for change, you're going to see it.  Will it be what you want tho?
808514768004730882 2016-12-12 03:31:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Time for my annual viewing of Band of Brothers.  Always watch it this time of year.  Thanks @tomhanks, @DW_Pictures.
808494264204161024 2016-12-12 02:10:28 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @missannabiller I was a little worried I was just going to be writing a blow by blow synopsis of the thing.
808494137922056192 2016-12-12 02:09:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @missannabiller Glad I saw that Tweet about Mrs. Franklin.  Virtually nothing is spoken of this film.

808411774743515136 2016-12-12 20:42:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @TatianaKing I have a vested interest in hoping for the best because my retirement is in the balance. But I'm not optimistic.
808403481996365826 2016-12-12 20:09:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm going to be thrilled when @realDonaldTrump takes over the POTUS Twitter account so he can begin receiving my Tweets again.

808125679510261761 2016-12-11 01:45:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @shannonwoodward It seems like the GOP campaign to get their base to willingly reject education is complete.

807660646053490688 2016-12-10 18:57:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Ok, so you love @realDonaldTrump.

807256563748466690 2016-12-09 16:12:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump Probably no one in that island of misfit toys you call a cabinet explained this but you have to listen to ALL Americans.

806982411741368320 2016-12-08 22:02:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If you thought Paul McCartney's Wonderful Christmastime was the worst Christmas song ever, hold that thought.  Someone recently remixed it.

803396611795652609 2016-11-28 00:34:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I referred to Christmas as "the holidays" three times so I assume the wings fell off at least that many angels.
803377842482540546 2016-11-28 23:19:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @karengillan Happy birthday, kiddo.

803351160446853120 2016-11-28 21:33:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @RiverCityOtter @missannabiller Also a good movie.  You should see it.

801553791145242624 2016-11-23 22:31:30 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser Gee, that's a super bummer.  NOW where am I going to get my news on the lizard people?  You know, besides Alex Jones.
801525540620410880 2016-11-23 20:39:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho You can have the last laugh because unless they're in the 1% they're going to see their retirement savings shrink. ;)
801525176147972096 2016-11-23 20:37:48 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I think I double pissed off the hand-wringers in that last Tweet.
801525057969238016 2016-11-23 20:37:20 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I've seen this #AnywhereButTarget campaign and I want in on that.  Which is why I vow to shop EXCLUSIVELY at @Target this "HOLIDAY" season.

801493404920135680 2016-11-23 18:31:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho "So....you're telling me that if 111,927,986 million people left the US it would be bad for the economy?!?!"
801491099453820928 2016-11-23 18:22:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho They tend to think that somebody smarter than them at the top has ironed all these out and what they're promoting is sound.
801490830263320576 2016-11-23 18:21:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho I understand.  I just love analyzing them because their worldview is so full of snags and hangups.
801489991708704768 2016-11-23 18:17:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho Also, not for nothing, but nationalism doesn't halt its gains for borders.
801489797474680832 2016-11-23 18:17:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho Well then, junior, say goodbye to a lot of things you like and/or took for granted.
801489691476303872 2016-11-23 18:16:48 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho Yes, that's a good one.  A fancy buzzword.  "I care about our cultural identity."
801489441340596224 2016-11-23 18:15:48 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho It's almost as if...oh I don't know...they feel guilt or shame or that they're perhaps not 100% on the right track? ;)
801489266404573188 2016-11-23 18:15:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho I think it's hilarious when their inherent hate - one of the few things they take pride in - they're STILL wishy washy about.
801488739998396416 2016-11-23 18:13:01 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho I just found his charming lack of conviction to be endearing.  Dude, you're a proud racist.  Own it.
801486011310055424 2016-11-23 18:02:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @linnieloowho @grimace0327 The avowed racist saves the day with providing context. Or plausible deniability. Or whatever the fuck that was.

800530655020863490 2016-11-20 02:45:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Remember when Trump bilked hard working Americans and then settled for paying them a pittance?  Oh right, that was yesterday.

800075967699959808 2016-11-19 20:39:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Does anyone else get the sense Trump only ran for President to take pressure off some of the civil penalties he knew were in his future?

800044636651732992 2016-11-19 18:34:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hey Trump supporters, don't forget your President Elect just settled a suit wherein he fleeced ordinary ppl looking to get ahead in life.
800043105646850048 2016-11-19 18:28:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Watching Swarm on @tcm and thinking - you know - given the current state of affairs, existence being snuffed out by bees is preferable.
800042212264292353 2016-11-19 18:25:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Trump U case is something his voters SHOULD actually care about, but yeah, focus your ire on a play you were never going to anyway.

800034807728062466 2016-11-19 17:55:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The Right has successfully taught its base to distrust and throw off the shackles of higher learning.  The proud tradition continues.

799768748177563648 2016-11-18 00:18:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I hope that @realDonaldTrump makes America so great that one day I too can settle a multi million dollar fraud suit.

798283930684125184 2016-11-14 21:58:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @KellyannePolls @sofiahayat @guav So the Left is America's biggest hate group, why  is this video about indiscriminate acts?

797146927561195520 2016-11-11 18:40:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @PhillyD No, it's just a hamster on a wheel.
797146431605719040 2016-11-11 18:38:14 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Now Robert Vaughn has left us.    2016, you've been a real peach I tell ya.

797116101083557889 2016-11-11 16:37:42 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @JaimieAlexander @jessetyler We'll see when he and Pence put their heads together and come up with a Supreme Court justice.
797114932621811712 2016-11-11 16:33:04 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I don't like it but I understand it.
797113738998337536 2016-11-11 16:28:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser That almost has me MORE worried.  Almost
797113458885988352 2016-11-11 16:27:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @NatPurser Since he literally hasn't the first clue what the President is responsible FOR he wilk just regurgitate what his advisors tell him.
797113037907836928 2016-11-11 16:25:32 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ShaunKing @SeventhSonTRS Put your theory to the test if you're convinced.  Engage other white people with your rhetoric out in the open.
797109296244793345 2016-11-11 16:10:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If you voted for Trump and are put off by racism, good.  Police your bothers and sisters.  That's your job now.

796924756851200000 2016-11-10 03:57:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The amusing part of @TedNugent's rant is he's in such a high tax bracket he won't even notice if none of Trump's promises come to fruition.
796919311000440832 2016-11-10 03:35:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Forced myself to think of 1 nice thing to say about @realDonaldTrump.  I'm still young enough that he'll die in my lifetime. So that's cool.

796177830329466881 2016-11-08 02:29:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @joshkerns38 I like to think of Hell as being populated by boundary pushing artists, not those who abandoned taste. 
796176902239043584 2016-11-08 02:25:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @joshkerns38 You'd think I'd love that.
796175687270813697 2016-11-08 02:20:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @joshkerns38 The problem is that unless Trump is issued a blanket condemnation, the ugliness he inspired will still see it as a win.

795668306057232384 2016-11-07 16:44:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The CMAs only award pop artists, otherwise @HANK_III, @JaykeOrvis, @CodyJinksMusic and @WillWhitmore - to name a few - would be nominated.https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/794395962353414144

795490968245911552 2016-11-06 05:00:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Taking Trump's Twitter away from him doesn't make him LESS of a danger to himself.
795489535568162816 2016-11-06 04:54:19 UTC <snarkofthebeast> At this point if you're voting for Trump you're ignorant and delusional AT BEST.  Psychotic at worst.https://twitter.com/ReutersZengerle/status/795399310062010368

795374893088899072 2016-11-06 21:18:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Remember when Trumpies thought James Comey was in Hillary's pocket?    Good times...good times.

794972372704968705 2016-11-05 18:39:18 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @missannabiller I'm sure it would be very artful.
794870801002414080 2016-11-05 11:55:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Ironic that the best Child's Play movie was directed by a guy who hadn't seen any of the others.

794648761431572480 2016-11-04 21:13:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trump feels he has a "winning temperament".  You know who else thought that?  Charlie Sheen.
794629384141312000 2016-11-04 19:56:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It might be tempting to dismiss me as a hopeless libtard but my ballot is so red-and-blue it resembles a pair of anaglyph 3D glasses.

793700812866269184 2016-11-01 06:26:34 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump I look forward to seeing you return to un-ironically calling proven winner "losers" when your defeat becomes official.
793699837795368960 2016-11-01 06:22:42 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Somewhere @valcapone is losing her shit tonight.

793694943185219584 2016-11-01 06:03:15 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten Sadly, from experience previous times I've remembered and hit it up late there is nothing left by the third.
793690952116297728 2016-11-01 05:47:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Every year I say I'm going to take advantage of post Halloween sales and every year I forget to do it.  This year being no exception.

789926196989485056 2016-10-22 20:27:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> This Tony Schwartz guy.  Art Of The Deal?  Hardly.  I know all the best minds.  I've never heard of you.  LIAR. #trumpbookreport
789925600907567104 2016-10-22 20:25:14 UTC <snarkofthebeast> And Oompa Loompas.  I would impose a strict moratorium on immigrants from war torn countries until we know what's going on. #trumpbookreport
789925035095896064 2016-10-22 20:22:59 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If it were up to me Charlie wouldn't HAVE a chocolate factory.  Willy Wonka is a socialist.  LOSER. #trumpbookreport
789920446355345408 2016-10-22 20:04:45 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Where The Red Fern Grows. Crooked propaganda. There's no science - NONE - to back up Billy's dogs making the fern turn red. #trumpbookreport
789917682359414784 2016-10-22 19:53:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hey, you can call it whatever you want but if you have costumes at your Harvest Party, it's a Halloween party.  You're fooling no one.
789870577024503808 2016-10-22 16:46:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto For the simplest of all reasons:  Because
789755407833059330 2016-10-22 09:08:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Just heard @KeshaRose's Cannibal for the first time today.  It's not normally my brand of music but I gotta confess, I kinda dug it.
789754198384529408 2016-10-22 09:04:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Pretty sure my liver is done working after today.
789739036772474880 2016-10-22 08:03:53 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hey @realDonaldTrump, maybe NOW you'll take climate science seriously, you stubby-digit orangutan.http://www.iflscience.com/environment/global-wine-production-collapsing-thanks-climate-change/
789736304011423745 2016-10-22 07:53:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I started watching the Rocky Horror redux with cautious optimism.  I'll have to finish watching it with some other emotion
789735783737327616 2016-10-22 07:50:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @BarbaraPalvin Ay carumba!
789656421893754881 2016-10-21 02:35:36 UTC <snarkofthebeast> RIP Kevin Meaney
789518399105671168 2016-10-21 17:27:09 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Millennials thinking their treatment is any different from previous generations is proof of how special they think they are.
789514892902404096 2016-10-21 17:13:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont Between you and me I don't like being startled.  So they're kind of irritating to me also.
789514092583133184 2016-10-21 17:10:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont They hurl abuse at you and shove things in your face.  A lot of it in the dark.
789513933023391744 2016-10-21 17:09:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont I could see how it might be a bit of an issue for some people. I mean, you're pushed and shoved and confined to small spaces.
789511985251495936 2016-10-21 17:01:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont Otherwise it was fun but....electric shock.  I draw the line there.
789511470069407745 2016-10-21 16:59:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'll just say "No I didn't" anyway but making any conflicting statements inadmissible would save us both some time.https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/789504509168984064
789497618145488896 2016-10-21 16:04:34 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont I was zapped, in total, on three separate occasions in the span of 20 minutes.
789497387957964800 2016-10-21 16:03:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @lcfremont There are a bunch of things the performers get to do to you up to and including electric shock.
789378396891471877 2016-10-21 08:10:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @stefania_model Unf!
789378206419693568 2016-10-21 08:10:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Went to one of those haunts where you have to sign a waiver.  Of all the things they did, the electric shock was my line.
789377792949489664 2016-10-21 08:08:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @tortorooo Yay?
789341797457629184 2016-10-20 05:45:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I read this FAR too late.

787922551196426240 2016-10-17 07:45:49 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @sshamdarling "Fuck the shit out of" is an analogy I'll never understand.

787907243597369344 2016-10-16 06:45:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Watching the VVitch again last night has confirmed for me that @anyataylorjoy belongs right up there with Barbara Steele or Linda Hayden.
787895945191010304 2016-10-16 06:00:06 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Just heard the adage "hasn't the sense required to pound sand into a rat hole" and all I can envision is everyone still voting for Trump.
787873971832180736 2016-10-16 04:32:47 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I thought that was @BigDanFrater in this week's @WestworldHBO.

787745653623435264 2016-10-16 20:02:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Watching The VVitch again really sealed it for me. @anyataylorjoy belongs right up there with Barbara Steele or Linda Hayden.
787736477597782016 2016-10-16 19:26:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @alexiwasser That is a tight list.
787712185606647808 2016-10-16 17:49:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So am I to understand there will be no new episodes of the #BoneZone?
787705122201624576 2016-10-16 17:21:50 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump is fixing to lose this Presidency like Triple H loses the WWE World Title belt: No clean pinfalls
787703541754277892 2016-10-16 17:15:33 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump doesn't know how Gvmt works and neither do his followers.  So it's no shock that the myth of a rigged election caught on.
787698921279676416 2016-10-16 16:57:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> It's ironic since SNL is at least partly culpable for his popularity.https://twitter.com/dailydot/status/787691858243809281

787564963816542208 2016-10-16 08:04:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Realizing now it was probably a mistake to watch The VVitch ahead of coming home to my dark, forlorn cabin atop this hill.
787564581308604416 2016-10-16 08:03:23 UTC <snarkofthebeast> There is power in all directions around where I live.  Until I get to the top of the hill where it's fucking Amish country.

787359222128254976 2016-10-15 18:27:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Frostology you need to turn your RT on.
787353950148112385 2016-10-15 18:06:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump if you're confused about people's exhaustion after talking to you for 90 minutes, don't be.  I suggest it's not that rare.
787353501529575424 2016-10-15 18:04:37 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @realDonaldTrump thinks @HillaryClinton should take a drug test b/c of her exhaustion after the debate?  That's what debate prep looks like.
787335982962008064 2016-10-15 16:55:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Boy how I wish Type O Negative and Ghost had been on the scene at the same time.

775714062843994112 2016-09-13 15:13:39 UTC <snarkofthebeast> "Color rush" is a fancy way of saying "throwing off television color levels coast to coast".
775713038804643840 2016-09-13 15:09:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The idea that Trump is extending his brand has already proven itself untrue. He lost a TV show and his constituents were and are beneath him
775709606441955328 2016-09-13 14:55:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> A lot of people ascribe meaning to Trump that he didn't intend. But when you don't correct it, that IS your message.pic.twitter.com/adAtoCAnrK

760932259763482624 2016-08-03 20:16:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If your reason for voting for Trump is that he's the antidote to political correctness, I hate PC culture too and I think he's a cocksucker.

760682833916661760 2016-08-02 03:44:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Don't get me wrong, @WWE has made great strides with its women's division but I'd love for them to figure out actual STORYLINES for them.

760587802790752256 2016-08-02 21:27:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm beginning to wonder if @realDonaldTrump is like Montgomery Brewster trying desperately to get people to stop voting for him.

760344868707106818 2016-08-01 05:21:57 UTC <snarkofthebeast> If #WWERaw dispensed with Gallows and Anderson they could afford one RAGER of an ice cream social for the locker room.
760344090533736448 2016-08-01 05:18:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Gallows & Anderson are what would happen if Wyatt accidentally left a 3/4" floppy of Gymini's greatest matches in Gary's computer. #WWERaw
760342259724279809 2016-08-01 05:11:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Gallows and Anderson are a Heidenreich promo made living flesh. #WWERaw
760341863513460736 2016-08-01 05:10:01 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Gallows and Anderson are like if you captured the fail that was Brothers Of Destruction vs Kronik, gestated it in a lab & made it a tag team
760340717176631296 2016-08-01 05:05:28 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Gallows and Anderson here to fill out the "I'm compensating for being bald by growing an ANGRY beard" quota. #WWERaw
760340246525534209 2016-08-01 05:03:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> You can go ahead and bury Gallows and Anderson now.  I assume the Double Deuce is without its bouncers. #WWERaw

759818645203582976 2016-07-31 18:30:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Guys, Trump has made sacrifices. Like a year ago when only 30% of America hated him.  He sacrificed a further 30%.

759106051966992384 2016-07-29 19:19:20 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Kind of hoping for a second Seattle @templeofthedog show because upon refreshing Ticketmaster said "You're shit outta luck, son."
759104892669657088 2016-07-29 19:14:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto Ticketmaster opened and immediately showed "No tickets available" like it was sold out before the on sale date.
759102375999184896 2016-07-29 19:04:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten Now I wonder, how on earth does Ticketbastard open up ticket sales to a concert that's already sold out???
759102126236786688 2016-07-29 19:03:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten It's funny, the tix just went on sale and IMMEDIATELY came back "no tickets available".  At ANY price level.

759038557621104640 2016-07-29 14:51:09 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Probably, yeah.
759038341794795520 2016-07-29 14:50:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> How does @rudygiulianiGOP even GIVE interviews with @realDonaldTrump's Cheeto dick in his mouth?

756240712061030400 2016-07-21 21:33:30 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Trump supporters are basically the citizens of Gotham from the 1989 Batman movie.
756202375346544640 2016-07-21 19:01:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> In hindsight, Cruz not endorsing Trump may have been the smartest decision he's ever made.

755627736870350848 2016-07-19 04:57:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The other is realizing that they represent a token of a very insidious movement who will devour them in an instant if the mood takes them.
755627275404574721 2016-07-19 04:55:55 UTC <snarkofthebeast> There are 2 ways of dealing with boogeymen like Milo. 1 is knowing what they're about and like Freddy Krueger, not taking them seriously.
755626530848505856 2016-07-19 04:52:58 UTC <snarkofthebeast> We are living in an age where attention - good or bad - is a valuable commodity & that is what makes people like Milo Yiannopoulos possible.
755625382079004673 2016-07-19 04:48:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Which is to say that he's about as genuine a person as the Westboro Baptists are a "church".
755625118223695873 2016-07-19 04:47:21 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I only just discovered this Milo fella recently but in that time I have deduced that he is as authentic as the Westboro Baptists.
755623709860331520 2016-07-19 04:41:45 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The #freeMilo hashtag reads like people whose only understand of everything comes from Milo articles.

755605451778068481 2016-07-19 03:29:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @SPonzilloTV I'd make a reasoned guess that he believes only some of what he says but there's a lot of people willing to pay for outrage.

755601103060807680 2016-07-19 03:11:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> I'm sure Milo Yiannopoulos will show the world how casually above Twitter he is by devising a dozen ways of getting around his ban.

748638435896864768 2016-06-30 22:04:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Ever wondered what it would sound like if a Miss Teen America contestant was asked to be tone deaf for 2 mins?http://wonkette.com/603619/white-lady-tomi-lahren-so-mad-jesse-williams-wont-thank-her-for-freeing-the-slaves
748300380753244160 2016-06-29 23:41:28 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten Well that's Ms Winnick in a nutshell.  She's belted in Karate and Tae Kwon Do multiple times over and is a licensed bodyguard.
748298320553119745 2016-06-29 23:33:16 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten My hangup boils down to 1 thing: I'm in danger.  Which of these two do I trust to rescue me.
748298166278168583 2016-06-29 23:32:40 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten I honestly thought Brie was the older of the two.
748296675106627584 2016-06-29 23:26:44 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @LankaKitten I love Brie but I feel she was moved to the top of the pile based more on her Oscar win rather than suitability for the role.

747964120880713729 2016-06-28 01:25:17 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Ticketmaster @mich_dev Not surprising.  At this point it exists basically as a taunt to all the people the duped for a second time.
747839775248355328 2016-06-28 17:11:11 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Hey @Ticketmaster, you can take down the list of eligible concerts so that people don't have to wade through 17 pages of sold out shows.

747096477034389504 2016-06-26 15:57:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The hashtag #TrumpGirlsBreakTheInternet looks like a Hee-Haw reunion casting call.

746826562880757761 2016-06-25 22:05:02 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Continuing this clown horror theme with All Hallows Eve.  This I'm not optimistic about.

720742150548418560 2016-04-14 22:34:54 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto I have not.  I have to admit that the Mormons are one sect that hasn't interested me enough to really read up on them.
720741909573083136 2016-04-14 22:33:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto I mean yes, I understand they've distanced themselves from it NOW but it was my understanding that that was a tenet of it.
720741701699125252 2016-04-14 22:33:07 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto Wasn't polygamy part of the Mormon base from the start?

720739500842950656 2016-04-14 22:24:22 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @StellaLibretto I mean much worse from an LDS perspective.  Isn't that what we're talking about?

711232170954588160 2016-03-19 16:45:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 That'll undo a relationship as fast as ACTUAL cheating.
711222127613976577 2016-03-19 16:05:43 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 Well social media has definitely changed the game.  It took a fairly innocuous practice and made it public.
711221797098663936 2016-03-19 16:04:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 I wouldn't mind my woman doing it.  If I had my druthers it wouldn't be a CONSTANT, but that goes both ways.
711219622930833409 2016-03-19 15:55:46 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 Could it indicate a DESIRE to step out?  Sure.  But it's by no means a definite.
711219482308399108 2016-03-19 15:55:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 Cheating is cheating.  Commenting on a picture is at a level with just looking at other women.
711219212442689537 2016-03-19 15:54:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @AwardsDarwin Why were there never any teachers that hot when I was in school?!
711218892048183296 2016-03-19 15:52:52 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ArianaM276 I agree with it.

702220181695700993 2016-02-23 19:55:12 UTC <snarkofthebeast> So I loved @thexfiles and @TheWitchMovie, both of which are hotly debated and highly contentious.  To which I say...pic.twitter.com/HHdX2fWzBU
702218384671272960 2016-02-23 19:48:04 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ShannonElizab 9 out of 13.  I'm frankly disappointed in myself.
702215126221352964 2016-02-23 19:35:07 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @Sttbs73 @SliderZ33 Andrea Tantaros is FOX's form of clickbait.  It's like saying "Since you're here, why don't you have a look around?"
702214035672936449 2016-02-23 19:30:47 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @joelmchale Hopefully (if @thexfiles returns) they bring you along as well. Tad O'Malley has such potential to bring good AND misinformation
702202940212137984 2016-02-23 18:46:41 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Variety and AV Club - pubs a discerning sort would never deign consult - have declared themeslves arbiters of taste  http://www.avclub.com/r/232687tsd
702195099787067392 2016-02-23 18:15:32 UTC <snarkofthebeast> When they bring back @thexfiles - when, not if - I seriously hope they consider The VVitch's Robert Eggers to direct an episode.
702016580922642433 2016-02-22 06:26:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Does #WWE have more than 4 female wrestlers on their main roster or naw?
702013426554372096 2016-02-22 06:13:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @briannahilde I'm going to need that in a large, pleaseandthankyou.
702011162175475712 2016-02-22 06:04:38 UTC <snarkofthebeast> How does that 3rd rate Heidenreich, Ryback, still have a career in any promotion?  Besides TNA of course.
702007729838161922 2016-02-22 05:51:00 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @ashley_unicorn I'll agree with you.  Mostly because I don't know who that is.

701984952116576257 2016-02-22 04:20:29 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Shane McMahon should take control of the company back from dear ol' dad. And as an act of good faith for the fans, reinstate @TitusONeilWWE.
701966190051065856 2016-02-22 03:05:56 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @M_Nessk I didn't read the "you" part.  It thought you were getting YOURSELF a fancy shirt.

701931624443678720 2016-02-22 00:48:35 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @frightrags @TheWitchMovie This should happen.  Because I'm kicking myself over missing the Krampus one I wanted.
701928226847731712 2016-02-22 00:35:05 UTC <snarkofthebeast> What I wouldn't give for @frightrags to put out a @TheWitchMovie shirt. Or for them to market their own. I need fancy duds for @crypticon.

701545994794594304 2016-02-21 23:16:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> The problem with seeing a movie in the theater that I enjoy is that I immediately want it on DVD.

701525661865758720 2016-02-21 21:55:26 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Every time I'm tempted to give up hope on whatever my endeavor I remember that Best Of The Best 2 got a wide release in theaters.
701500490438221824 2016-02-21 20:15:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Getting hit up by phony dating sites that are really just spam on IG.  I gotta wonder, has that EVER worked?
701332323350872064 2016-02-21 09:07:10 UTC <snarkofthebeast> But of all the things I could cite that were stupendous about this day the fact that I was able to park in my same zipcode took the cake.

701318730853150721 2016-02-21 08:13:09 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Robert Eggers turned in a darn accomplished feature length directorial debut in @TheWitchMovie.  Can't wait to see how he follows it up.
701317236204576768 2016-02-21 08:07:13 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Everybody positvely crushed it in @TheWitchMovie but @anyataylorjoy is the only one I can be sure is themselves on Twitter so

700031994873274368 2016-02-17 19:00:08 UTC <snarkofthebeast> @deadpoolmovie better be recognized at next year's Oscars. At the very least a best supporting nod for @briannahilde's expressive eyebrows.
700029546884534272 2016-02-17 18:50:24 UTC <snarkofthebeast> Apparently you're not supposed to read the Bible chronologically but rather in a certain order. Like comics. And just as factual.
