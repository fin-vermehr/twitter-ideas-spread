China has almost no history of desire for military conquest in the communist era. Tibet is the only actual case. Some conflict w/Vietnam, threats to Taiwan and ocean territorial expansion.

970865387905699840 2018-03-05 03:35:20 UTC <tonydunc> @AstroKatie Yeah. All of that, but the one content idiocy that really pisses me off is EVERY space scene shows an astetoid belt with hundreds of wildly tumbling asteroids all within 1/4 mile of each other

This was a major Trump campaign adviser who sounds crazy after being subpoenaed.  There are so MANY tendrils connecting Trump to Russia that it will take a long time for Mueller to follow them all.

I am saying without a clear social political message that change is vital, there will not be much change. And that msg will have authority if globally government and private industry are seen to insist it is vital.

My town has forced composting. When people see the society is serious about carbonizing on the large scale, it is MUCH more likely that personal choices will become much more socially accoubtavle

Asking individuals to chsnge their lifestyle will have little impact if major industry- energy productuon, transportation, infrastructure (incl. cement), agriculture are not on strong trajectories to decarbonize
970745835272200197 2018-03-05 19:40:17 UTC <tonydunc> @cccalum @jBourgetron He misunderstands clinate change, and is much too sanguine about it. I actually am somewhat of an optimist, but we are already to the point of how bad is it going to be

969246582234337282 2018-03-01 16:22:47 UTC <tonydunc> I think this is a good point. I bet many Trump supporters WANT corruption in the admin.

969244942123061249 2018-03-01 16:16:16 UTC <tonydunc> @BigJoeBastardi @icarus62 What is that all supposed to mean? I would think a designer interpretion would say God set CO2 at 280 for humanity to prosper, so it is meant to be there. Any human with the hubris to ignore that is clearly acting against Gods will.
969188312748617729 2018-03-01 12:31:15 UTC <tonydunc> @DavidSea7 That isnt quite right. We are burning coal oil and gas at a much much faster rate than it was stored as fossil fuel. That is why CO2 went from under 300 to over 400 ppm. No, plugging a few volcanos wouldnt do it even if possible . All volcanos produce much less than humans do

The rage That @MichaelEMann @ClimateOfGavin and @AndrewDessler will feel about YOU being touted as the leader will result in infighting between you four  for years(bwahahahaha)
969173890760101888 2018-03-01 11:33:56 UTC <tonydunc> @RogerPielkeJr @aaronhuertas Well THIS was anticlimactic. I was hoping for fireworks and you just get a toothless cease and desist
969169420110258178 2018-03-01 11:16:10 UTC <tonydunc> @MRobertsQLD @DavidSea7 Neither of those facts in anyway undermines the scientific theiry of ACC. That extra 3%/year is why CO2 has increased so much over the last 50 years. #2 CO2 is a feedback so it lags or leads temp depending of the situation. Right now it leads

969163705924620288 2018-03-01 10:53:28 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Because tbe legal rightvto anortion is being attacked in many states, and in some it is extremely difficult to get one whatever the reason. Its a reaction.
969154417181282304 2018-03-01 10:16:33 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I know this is whataboutism but shouldnt you be more worried that Trump is the first modern US president to say you can take peoples guns away without due process?
969153759178870784 2018-03-01 10:13:56 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Because it is a tiny local thing that was just a stipend for australian students. Probably wrong quite possibly illegal. About 100 other political stories that are much bigger.

969046212052770818 2018-02-28 03:06:35 UTC <tonydunc> @edwiebe @damon_matthews Yes, because he did not know nearly enough About the environment and how consequences of warming would play out

968633973839683584 2018-02-27 23:48:30 UTC <tonydunc> @jenninemorgan Scientists are not lying about the climate. Skeptics have predicted a mini ice age for over 10 years. Did not happen. And only a very small number have done so. Solar radiance does not change enough to counter effects of GHGs

968537661429506048 2018-02-27 17:25:47 UTC <tonydunc> @theresphysics Can you post those responses?
968537258465820673 2018-02-27 17:24:11 UTC <tonydunc> @nypost @RWPUSA @MOWaterhouse In reading her article ( not this Post garbage) i found her ciews to be quite nuanced and reasonable. I nevet heard her suggest that Clinton deserved what happenrd to him. It was more about how unrepentant Starr was for what he did to all of them
968535869517893632 2018-02-27 17:18:40 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom Al tbat is i teresting. I appreciate your posting all those decisions. Do you know which were referrenced in Heller decision?
968468017721077760 2018-02-27 12:49:03 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom Only in 2008 by 5-4 vote. But sgain I do not argue that. The decision explicitly acknowledged the right to regulate.
968345499613958144 2018-02-26 04:42:12 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @MoonIAm93 @Toimatom The wording IS explicit.
968345374455984131 2018-02-26 04:41:42 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @MoonIAm93 @Toimatom No. That would be stated. A well regulated militia being necesary... cannot be honestly be considered up to the whim of the individual. As I said thst is tortuous rationalization.
968344288382935040 2018-02-26 04:37:23 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom @MoonIAm93 key part of tbat very long link Thus, the Framers chose not to explicitly define who, or what, would regulate the militias, nor what such regulation would consist of, nor how the regulation was to be accomplished. Tbe idea that it meant self discipline seems rather tortuous
968339862595268619 2018-02-26 04:19:48 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @nurse_katt @Toimatom Again it is irrelevant. Not an issue I am arguing about
968337375280721927 2018-02-26 04:09:55 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @nurse_katt @Toimatom Not a strawman. It is somewhat irrelevant. Clearly as with all amendments there are restrictions, that are for public safety.
968335805105229825 2018-02-26 04:03:41 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom Bear arms generally meant for military or militia
968328703624253441 2018-02-26 03:35:28 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom @nurse_katt Where is there a supreme court decision about this. if you can own a canon why not , according to Toimas argument, its current equivalent artillery, or maybe rpg, tank, or aircraft carrier?
968310487246090241 2018-02-26 02:23:05 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom Ah, so the stronger you are the bigger weapon you can have. Makes perfect sense. And of course some idiot took that in perpetuity thing out in the second or third  draft
968293623199563777 2018-02-26 01:16:04 UTC <tonydunc> @SethAbramson @Toimatom Owning ship canons? I actually dont remember that decision

I think very stongly that the key factor is changing the culture so that violence is not a preferrred method of solving conflict. I think regulations can assist that,  but I totally support the second amendment

968271705503404032 2018-02-26 23:48:58 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 He did not say the 2nd amendment is just about  hunting . He said he didnt see any need for more than 5-6 rounds when hunting. Also did not say registry would prevent gun violence. But it can be part of a public health initiative to promote responsible gun use
968232727219712001 2018-02-26 21:14:05 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 I see nothing misleading or not knowledgeable. He is saying the second amendment does not prevent regulation of guns
968226849733185537 2018-02-26 20:50:44 UTC <tonydunc> @chr1stianh @mammuthus My guess is terraforming mars would be a few orders@of magnitude harder and more expensive. And by a few I dont mean 1 or 2
968226533595930624 2018-02-26 20:49:29 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 Being his job is to decide what is constitutional and he had spent a large part of his life mKing rulings in issus like this, i think you are dismissing his opinion a little too easily
968219372287352833 2018-02-26 20:21:01 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 That guy was the chief justice of tbe Supreme Court.

968201366907834368 2018-02-26 19:09:28 UTC <tonydunc> @WhySharksMatter @AzurigenMCS I didnt say it was credible, but it was funny
968200902334132224 2018-02-26 19:07:38 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs You can mute this convo any time. Yes Obama attempted a reset w/ Russia, but did not include lauding him as a leader and changing policy to reward Russia for no reason. Also there was no significant evidence of Massive Russian i nterference in election and before Crimea/Ukraine
968197045159940097 2018-02-26 18:52:18 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 So you take back your claim of them  only being good for shooting rabbits and foxes?
968196667286618114 2018-02-26 18:50:48 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 Like banning these kind of semi autmatic rifles. Or keeping them in shooting ranges
968196428387508224 2018-02-26 18:49:51 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs No. You asked for evidence, and I provided you a fraction of what publicly exists. You seem to be asking for proof, and at this point I agree there is no publicly documented proof of actual unambiguous agreement for quid pro quo between Trump and Putin
968195772960387073 2018-02-26 18:47:15 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 So this radiologist article is a total fabrication?https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/what-i-saw-treating-the-victims-from-parkland-should-change-the-debate-on-guns/553937/
968195152106975237 2018-02-26 18:44:47 UTC <tonydunc> @WhySharksMatter @AzurigenMCS I actually performed at a biology conference a couple of years ago pretending to be E.O. Wilson. The scientists loved it but the event organizer was completely confused.
968194586169442305 2018-02-26 18:42:32 UTC <tonydunc> @WhySharksMatter @AzurigenMCS Will do!
968192678306435073 2018-02-26 18:34:57 UTC <tonydunc> @theresphysics Classy guy. I think it is good advice to suggest Pilke hang loose.
968191531546021889 2018-02-26 18:30:23 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs Greenwald is an ideologue. Fairly honest but he has a far left anti american bias that wants Russia to be not so bad because of how bad US is. He did great work with Snowden. Every piece of evidence I gave tou is documented and potentially shows collusion. Again, I left out LOTS
968190621507903489 2018-02-26 18:26:46 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w @averymt99 The description of the wounds and near instant deaths from internal trauma in Florida suggest otherwise. Unless of course you consider teenagers small game. I will grant you It may not be up for short distance elephant or rhino hunting

There is a TON of evidence both of lies and hidden@meeti gs and connections, but also active policy blatantly against any historical precedent. You are free to ignore it. Doesnt make it less real
968189413628043264 2018-02-26 18:21:58 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @TheLiquidx @Vinwagener It shows an honest responsible gun owner acknowledging the need for reasonable gun regulations

Defending Putin attacking US intel assessments. Not acting on solid evidence of cyber attack. Much More
968187273379569664 2018-02-26 18:13:28 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @TheLiquidx @Vinwagener It actually is a military grade weapon. Numerous military have made that very clear. That is the appeal of the gun. It is a semi automatic high capacity deadly rifle
968186776430043136 2018-02-26 18:11:30 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs I just laid out a fraction of the evidence that exists of the possibility of, in common parlance, traitorous actions Connected to Trump. There is NONE for your Obama analogy
968186084973834240 2018-02-26 18:08:45 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @TheLiquidx @Vinwagener Exactly.  has nothing to do with your baseless assertion

Trump family business interests in Russia. Numerous meetings between Trump officials and key putin allies. Campaign manager working for pro soviet Putin connected president and hanging republican platform against all historical precedent
968182253238005760 2018-02-26 17:53:31 UTC <tonydunc> @VirologyComics I love that this exists. Or did you just pull one over on me?
968181921724411905 2018-02-26 17:52:12 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @TheLiquidx @Vinwagener No he didnt. He just clearly explained there was no reasonable purpose in owning a military grade weapon, ao he did not want to keep it, and believes it should be banned or highly regulated
968181511236345856 2018-02-26 17:50:34 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs Oh the US is quite guilty and much worse.

You seem to be suggesting unless there is a taped phone call of Trump telling Putin specific quid pro quo there is no crime. there are many ways conspiracies are worked out.
968180397627596800 2018-02-26 17:46:09 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @G_OchoKhan Actually people do care. Seeing a reasonable gun owner do something rational and explain his reasoning is a social good
968179863965392896 2018-02-26 17:44:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @BlowingSn0w Nope. Those can have legitimate uses

968179236480737280 2018-02-26 17:41:32 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @TheWhiteDrake And a damn good one
968179181690523648 2018-02-26 17:41:19 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @caydenterry_ Yeah. Hes gonna get rich off of this!
968178862994706432 2018-02-26 17:40:03 UTC <tonydunc> @Shields245AM @mic @Vinwagener @TheLiquidx Nope. And that is not the point. He is promoting gun regulation that is legal and supports publicly safety
968177332023386112 2018-02-26 17:33:58 UTC <tonydunc> @WhySharksMatter @AzurigenMCS I guess that means you dont hire science savvy jugglers?

There are numerous indictments and guilty pleas in an incredibly complicated investigation. totally a unprecedented

I have no problem making sure people understand the difference between legal usage. And common usage
968171872360820741 2018-02-26 17:12:16 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs No one is going to refer to Trump as a conspirer agaisnt the US Government
968170343222439938 2018-02-26 17:06:12 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs 3/ no one here is actually legally charging him with a criminal act. If the reasonable worst case scenarios against Trumps prove to be true regardless of the actual legal statues or impeachment used against him, he will be commonly referred to as a traitor
968169391576797185 2018-02-26 17:02:25 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs 2/ In Trumps case has actions toward Russia have no precedent in either parties history, there is an active investigation with numerous charged and guilty actors and literally dozens of hidden interactions that circumstantially support the common usage of the term treason
968168349124513792 2018-02-26 16:58:16 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs 1/ That is a flawed analogy. The accusations of treason against Ibama for Iran seal were jist propaganda. It was an international agreement negotiated with numerois other parties with absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Obama conspired with Iran to undermine US interests
968151659330396162 2018-02-26 15:51:57 UTC <tonydunc> @PeterWSJ @JelaniRaysMom @rebeccaballhaus @Diana05639890 @HajVenneman @CanadianSpurs There is a technical constitutional term, then thete is the common universal understanding of the term. Trump very possibly falls under the second meaning. While not technically an enemy at war, most peole would consider promoting russian interests ahead of US interests treason
968100573257007105 2018-02-26 12:28:57 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik He has a 35% approval rating. If he exposed blatant fraud from previous administrations on a key issue for dems, he would guarantee relublican control for a decade at least and almost certainly his re election. He would be famous for exposing tbe biggest conspiracy in history.
968099835478990848 2018-02-26 12:26:01 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Perfect analogy. Thousands of scientists signed off on that too, right?
968099563692281856 2018-02-26 12:24:57 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik It certainly might explain #1. The rest is silly
968099115321233413 2018-02-26 12:23:10 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I dont understand. Trump says clinate change is a fraud, yet he does nothing to expose it. It would instantly give him and repubs super majorities in both houses in 2018. Why would you want someone that stupid to lead your country?
968098361235689472 2018-02-26 12:20:10 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik So all the cries of fraud from Trump and republican legislators were just plots to get elected. They could easilyvexpose the fraud at NOAA and NASA assuring relublican domince. So by not doing so they must be the stupidest politicians ever
968097726599778304 2018-02-26 12:17:39 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I told you I dont pay attention to oil companies. When there is credible evidence ACC is drastically wrong honest scientists will desert the tbeory. For 9 years I have been told by people like you thos was about to happen. I am not holding my breath.
968097015094800385 2018-02-26 12:14:49 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik No doubt. pretty sure every anti vaxx  and chem trailer m feels the same. climate scientists I know are honest,well versed in their fields. Never had one lie to me. Constantly see lies/absurd distortions from climate Skeptics. And most damning is they never correct each other
968095974571823104 2018-02-26 12:10:41 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom No idea what that means. Assume it is meant as some sort of insult?
968095707570884608 2018-02-26 12:09:37 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I said I follow Climate scientists. ACC is tbe only consistant theory that explains the facts. You can refuse to believe it, regardless of the consequences, and I have no diubt you will.
968094289187221506 2018-02-26 12:03:59 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Thats a relief
968094196841308160 2018-02-26 12:03:37 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry Yup. Him and his 35-40% approval rating. They are killing it in the interim elections that the dem base never votes in.
968093601199722496 2018-02-26 12:01:15 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik You refuse to answer my question about the validity of the graph from Sibley. You keep wasting time by arguing things that have no basis in reality. I.e that I believe no birds are killed by windmills, when nothing I have written could pissibly indicate that.
968092966320594944 2018-02-26 11:58:44 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry Actually it is the vast majority if climate scientists. I often take issue with the fringe clinate alarmists like McPherson
968092560643231744 2018-02-26 11:57:07 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I am not the one that believes oil companies are part of a conspiracy to promote ACC. Could you source that $100 million assertion? And for god sakes TRY to avoid Heller
968092062846472199 2018-02-26 11:55:08 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Is that not what you are saying is actually going on? If not please clarify what you ARE saying
968091719693688833 2018-02-26 11:53:46 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik a desire for accurate understanding of an important issue. I certainly dont hound the cli ate scientists I follow. I read what they write and occasionally respond. If you want to call that obsession, go ahead
968091065151565824 2018-02-26 11:51:10 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik But YOU are the one asserting what can be described as a conspiracy by logic and definition. I am not tarring you I am accurately describing  common language what you are insisting is actually happening.
968090494734688256 2018-02-26 11:48:54 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik U getting hidden tweets from someone claiming 2 be me? I acknowledged birds killed by windmills in first comment listing a graph that showed birds killed by windmills l. I have agred they are killed by wi dmills everytime you have brought it up. You refuse to answer my question
968089419554213888 2018-02-26 11:44:38 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I pay no attention to what oil companies say about clinate. Just climate scientists and people who lie and distort about the science
968088964719620096 2018-02-26 11:42:50 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry No. I am just applyi g standard definitions to what you are describing. Fraud and conspiracy. And even tbe people who decry the fraud who are now in power and able to expose it refuse to. That makes them part of the conspiracy
968088251344048128 2018-02-26 11:39:59 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry So the chinese and other asian coutries are also part of the conspiracy. Jesus, how could I have forgotten them??? You guys are SERIOUSLY fucked. But at leDt you will die thoroughly oppressed knowing you knew the truth. Kind of envy that!
968087581052325888 2018-02-26 11:37:20 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik No. If there is Fraudulent science and the oil companies know it, and do not set the record straight and profit from it They are explicitly part of a conspiracy. That is how logic works
968086947846590464 2018-02-26 11:34:49 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik No one on twitter has ever accused me of that. But if any contact you who feel that way, let me know and I will adjust my twitter behavior. Wouldnt want any climate scientist to feel uncomfortable
968086540344856576 2018-02-26 11:33:12 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik We never disagreed about that fact. My original post presented that fact clearly. Why you couldnt understand that is rather odd
968086182633537536 2018-02-26 11:31:46 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Nope. It is the word that describes what you insist is actually happening
968085985157419011 2018-02-26 11:30:59 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik No. YOU believe it is a conspiracy. They know tbe truth but are willing to be attacked mercilously and potentially lose trillions in stranded assets because they can make a couple of billion now. Shareholders must be thrilled!
968085538459840512 2018-02-26 11:29:13 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik The pause was proof previous warming was just a natural artifact. How has that worked for you the last few years? I actuslly though the pause had some merit for some unknown factor liniting ACC. That went out the window since 2015.
968083610489245696 2018-02-26 11:21:33 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Probably similar to or below avg wage for other Ph.ds, certainly much less than most MBAs.
968083253298126848 2018-02-26 11:20:08 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik So you Absutely are saying that big oil is part of the conspiracy. THANK you for being honest.
968082978546110464 2018-02-26 11:19:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Actually I get people to laugh at absurdities. Occasionally that includes making fun of male stereotypes. I was referring to the teaching I do
968082637926617088 2018-02-26 11:17:41 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Nope. I just follow climate scientists and critically assess peoples arguments that rely on conspiracy
968082327002808320 2018-02-26 11:16:27 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik How does posting a graph that acknowledges that birds are killed by windmills and then acknowledging that fact mean I deny it?
968081857635024896 2018-02-26 11:14:35 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry So the biggest most profitable business in tbe world is part of a conspiracy whoes proponents want to undermine their profitabity. At what point does that change?
968081428503199744 2018-02-26 11:12:53 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik You apparently do not know what a scientific prediction is. Or you are just being deceitful. But no. Climate cooling  was not a prediction of ACC. It was a prediction of a hypothesis that assumed rampant pollution overwhelming ACC. Or another hypothesis that ignored ACC
968080605656338432 2018-02-26 11:09:37 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik And WHY dont @RepRohrabacher and @inho expose the fraud at NOAA and NASA si ce they are in power, have support of president, and could in one  swoop destroy tbe basis for ACC and guarantee a generation of political power! Dems all in on fraud. They would be destroyed
968079875973279745 2018-02-26 11:06:43 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik They must know it is fraudulent. So they are part of tbe conspiracy by not providing honest research tjat they could easily fund.
968079545629888512 2018-02-26 11:05:24 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik And the climate scientists I know are not making money hand over fist. majority  make 5 figures.
968079150740320257 2018-02-26 11:03:50 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik How can they NOT be part of the conspiracy if they know the science is fraudulent? And using that fraud to steal money from us?
968078736405999617 2018-02-26 11:02:11 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I dont see that at all. I work with lots of woman and none disallow me being masculine. In fact most value those qualities in me, and I live in feminist utopia VT. I am appreciated in my work because I encourage strength creativity and independance with both men and woman here
968077851110068224 2018-02-26 10:58:40 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik I POSTED a fucking GRAPH that says they do. and I have asked you repeatedly if you think that graph is a lie. Why do you keep avoiding an answer?
968077260640145409 2018-02-26 10:56:19 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik As I predicted you do not understand what prediction means in science. And then you use a totally discredited argument that I have debunked personally probably 100 times.
968076546564124673 2018-02-26 10:53:29 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Or are they going to change their minds once they have squeezed what they can out of us with their fraud and pump and mine all they can in the future?
968076137065742337 2018-02-26 10:51:51 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Ah. So fossil fuel companies are part of the conspiracy. Glad you are aware of tbe depth of the plot. I must be lying when I say they stand to lose trillions in unused FF reserves. You must be a big believer in peak oil!
968075545480171521 2018-02-26 10:49:30 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Certainly what has defined manhood in tbe past has disallowed basic human expression, some of which is shared by both men and woman. key is studying childhood development and how socialization  channels self image.
968074644665270273 2018-02-26 10:45:55 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Why cant you answer the question. Is Sibley lying about the causes or numbers of bird deaths?
968074335461216256 2018-02-26 10:44:42 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Please provide me with you experts whose predictions have turned out to be true. Almost all predictions from ACC tbeory have been confirmed. Most skeptics I have talked to do not seem to know what prediction actually means.
968071278493077505 2018-02-26 10:32:33 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Not sure What you mean by resembles. And the whole point is that being a man can mean much more than the straight jacket we used to be forced into.
968066617107275776 2018-02-26 10:14:01 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Aside from being meaningless wordsalad, wouldnt fossil fuel companies have to he finacial resources to promote non co sliracy science sonce there are Trillions of dollars to be lost if they dont?
968066138490974208 2018-02-26 10:12:07 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Why do you ignore my question? Are you saying that an established birding organization is lying about bird deaths? Sibley is part of tbe conspiracy as well?
968065487858032641 2018-02-26 10:09:32 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Ummm maybe because it is the only way to get actual experts to take seriously any accurate research. Of course if there was widespread fraud, valid science produced anywhere would quickly be accepted by honest scientists and ACC would unravel smazingly fast
967989116259524608 2018-02-25 05:06:04 UTC <tonydunc> Certainly itvis a question of public safetyhttps://twitter.com/ericsteig/status/967835397634928640
967988682648178688 2018-02-25 05:04:20 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Seems pretty accurate. But it is changing. masculinity is now more open to less rigid parameters. i know no one that wants men to be weak and powerless
967963851319861248 2018-02-25 03:25:40 UTC <tonydunc> @ashahawkesworth @Impolitics Pretty sure the fascist monks scoured the earth and found her reincarnated as @danaloesch
967947701294895104 2018-02-25 02:21:30 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry You guys have been saying this for 9 years that I have been following. You know that is not true BECAUSE you do not call for independant investigation of temp records. Deniers controp the government. Proving that would destroy dems for a generation
967944171423182848 2018-02-25 02:07:28 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry That is absurd. You know it and repubs in congress and Executive know it. That is why in SPITE of my constantly harranging him to investigate NOAA and GISS temp records @RepRohrabacher just waves his arms
967943578025713664 2018-02-25 02:05:07 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry Exactly. An angry bluster. No evidence of conspiracy as genuine scientific papers by skeptics have been published since then. And they get critiqued, shown to be wrong or distortions and mostly ignored
967942734211436544 2018-02-25 02:01:45 UTC <tonydunc> @Impolitics 8. Has not called for increased euthenasia.                                          9. Supports Trumps affairs and sexual predation. Nazis would never publicly do so                            10 Make America great again, Definitely NOT Germany
967941735535009792 2018-02-25 01:57:47 UTC <tonydunc> @Impolitics 7. No demand to annex historically English speaking parts of Canada. Especially since Vancouver Isl. south of Bellingham, Wa.                                                     8. No secret deals w/ Russia to....... scratch that.
967939763356528641 2018-02-25 01:49:57 UTC <tonydunc> @Impolitics 3. No banners designed by Trump 4. Been a year and Trump has not executed. kushner, Bannon, and the people who pled guilty.                5. They have not burned down Congress and blamed it on Clinton.           6. They have not made false claims of wanting univeral disarmament

967931963725303809 2018-02-25 01:18:58 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik There was absolutely nothing in climate gaate emails that showed concerted attempts at fraud. In fact no attempt at fraud. wanting to beat up someone and talking about  to discredit and reform journal they thought was dishonest is as far as it went
967931334298566656 2018-02-25 01:16:28 UTC <tonydunc> @PaulHBeckwith @ZLabe @sideen_dan @IAmTheOnlyKyle Ah. Apparently there is a  North Pole Alaska. Glad you got me to check that. I am having trouble getting the right source. This probably has it, but I dont know which one is which.
967927462570184704 2018-02-25 01:01:04 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik not the reality of climate gate. showed pissed off scientists angry their work was being lied about and distorted, whose only illegal action was refusing FOI. No evidence of fraud and just a few unprofessional suggestions. Hide the decline, mikes nature trick are propaganda
967925351170084864 2018-02-25 00:52:41 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik So tou arexsaying my chart from a well established birding site is fake?
967887191555891201 2018-02-25 22:21:03 UTC <tonydunc> @PaulHBeckwith @ZLabe @sideen_dan When did you take that. I have 9* right now. Not going below Zero til Tuesday night
967884657214836737 2018-02-25 22:10:59 UTC <tonydunc> @monacharenEPPC @jerry_jtaylor Happy Birthday Mona!
967883724808474625 2018-02-25 22:07:17 UTC <tonydunc> @monacharenEPPC @jerry_jtaylor I disagree with her on many political issues, but I am supporting all conservatives willing to oppose the toxic mess the republican party has become.
967882586910609408 2018-02-25 22:02:45 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @scotpolitik @JWSpry I have been following Climate change rather intently since climate gate. My view has changed significantly based on 9 years of evidence and talking to dozens of climate scientists. Indicative is the comment I made showing the major causes of bird death and how silly response was
967836786029416449 2018-02-25 19:00:45 UTC <tonydunc> @icarus62 @kmpetersson Assume this is similar to Krauss book
967835440895135745 2018-02-25 18:55:25 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik That has to be one of the lamest responses to actual facts I have ever seen
967794062886567936 2018-02-25 16:10:59 UTC <tonydunc> @mackaymiller Never heard of this. Would have assumed lots of waste. But I see it is quite feasible in many cases. I have long thought geothermal would eventually be major source of heat energy.
967790577424257025 2018-02-25 15:57:08 UTC <tonydunc> @sapinker @jerry_jtaylor I think he makes some major mistakes here. nitrogen scare of late 19th century had technological fix. The alarm was real, but the solution simple and cheap. Today multiple factors limit necesary action to forestall possible devastating destruction. solutions complicated expensive
967786678000726021 2018-02-25 15:41:39 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry @scotpolitik Bird mincers. Obviously you already know this but for anyone reading that believes youhttp://www.sibleyguides.com/conservation/causes-of-bird-mortality/
967785947810140160 2018-02-25 15:38:45 UTC <tonydunc> @BretStephensNYT @JWSpry Do you want a detailed deconstruction of everything wrong in those articles. The blog is ludicrous. Stephans is just more sophisticated in his distortions
967782460175060992 2018-02-25 15:24:53 UTC <tonydunc> @LTorcello It seems odd. I see people like Harris and Shermer who are so concerned about left PC ruining america when tbeir impact is tiny, while Trump and right fascism control the political structure. I fight back against extremist left, but I prioritize the dangers
967775105224007681 2018-02-25 14:55:40 UTC <tonydunc> @Vivarn8 This seems awefully risky. But I guess they are factoring in all the potential problems
967649973868384257 2018-02-24 06:38:26 UTC <tonydunc> @Mcschweety Knew you codnt resist the Podesta bait. He was working for Manaforte. Typical greedy shit both parties due. Manaforte is special. Why Trump hired him!!
967649572251226114 2018-02-24 06:36:50 UTC <tonydunc> @Mcschweety Like I give a shit if you block me???. I was not insulting you. If I was insulting you I would be saying you are a fucking nutjob fanatic idiot for believing insane conspiracy theories about justice department conspiracies. I left the first part out.
967644589644566528 2018-02-24 06:17:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Mcschweety Good luck with that. Maybe they will find Hillary DNA on Foster murder weapon too! Bet you were sure Gates and Manaforte were innocent and this was all about Podesta
967643520755535872 2018-02-24 06:12:47 UTC <tonydunc> @Mcschweety I doubt it. Carter was a russian rube. no evidence Steele knew DNC was paying fusion. 4 judges,  all republican appointees,  reissued warrants. Steele bias just common sense. Trump is incompetent ignorant narcissist. No one who cares about american democracy thinks otherwise
967635963798224896 2018-02-24 05:42:46 UTC <tonydunc> @Mcschweety So are you saying that Ohr and Steele colluded to present false fraudulent evidence to surveil carter As part of broader conspiracy to fake Trump collusion by FBI?
967625852245684224 2018-02-24 05:02:35 UTC <tonydunc> @LTorcello All these critiques are interesting. I do agree with Pinker that there are many aspects of life that improve both qualitatively and quantitatively and the enlightenment was a huge factor. This makes many good points that there is much more to it

967537531519725568 2018-02-24 23:11:38 UTC <tonydunc> @sapinker @ClimateHuman @theresphysics The one alarmist scientific instance that has some relevance is the lack of  nitrogen  at end of 19th century. That had a single technical solution. This problem is MUCH more complicated and unlikely to have any remotely similar solutions
967486007456215040 2018-02-24 19:46:53 UTC <tonydunc> @carnivalosouls @SarahEMyhre I think people like McPherson exaggerate and there are alarmists saying the methane bomb will make temps soar in decades. But they are a fringe. Almost all climate scientists are honest and present realistic evidence and conclusions
967485415379951616 2018-02-24 19:44:32 UTC <tonydunc> @carnivalosouls Who are the people lying aboit climate change in the scientific community? No climate scientist  warning about the dangers of climate change has lied that I know of

967097880363372544 2018-02-23 18:04:37 UTC <tonydunc> @WotInEquation @AGW_Prof @EthonRaptor A long time ago I stopped a fight between two guys. One with a tire iron. I talked them out of attacking each other because they didnt really want to but couldnt back down because of pride. A gun would have been faster but would not have been their decision. If they had a gun??

967090296155754496 2018-02-23 17:34:28 UTC <tonydunc> @dasingleton I just got into someones car 3 weeks ago. Threw my bags in the back and key did not work. Realized it wasnt my car as owner walked up. We laughed about it, but it was embarrassing. My car, same model, almost same year, was right next to his.
967084972728291328 2018-02-23 17:13:19 UTC <tonydunc> @GLibWKTV @WKTV @Siubhan_H @DocBastard It is certainly conceivable that chiropractic could have some effect on the immune system. Without real resesrch indicating that there is no readon to think there is
966721043376345088 2018-02-22 17:07:12 UTC <tonydunc> @mpigliucci I found both critics to be reasonable, while the second certainly was rather condescending. Having not read the book itnis hard to judge how fair or valid their critiques are. I tend to agree with Pinker in theory and often clash with specifics.
966614991704076293 2018-02-22 10:05:47 UTC <tonydunc> @mpigliucci This bugged me about Sagan in the 80s. His views about evolution and other non physics areas were considered aythoritative, when they were acrually naive
966585583484243968 2018-02-22 08:08:56 UTC <tonydunc> @maddow @JoyceWhiteVance @SteveJordahlAFN Amazing that people bring up the tarmac meeting when rhere are 20 russian Trump proxy meetimgs that are so much more damaging.

966123821387395072 2018-02-20 01:34:03 UTC <tonydunc> @dougmcneall @nevaudit @edwiebe To be fair to Pinker, I think he is correct and his numbers mean something.

966067605147738112 2018-02-20 21:50:40 UTC <tonydunc> @RupertDarwall Glad SOMEONE is willing to give the NAZIs a little respectability. So many think they were evil all the wy through

Over a dozen accuse him, many with witnesses or documentation. He paid off one porn star and Enquirer paid off another when had 4 month old
966000497542008832 2018-02-20 17:24:00 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann @aaas @stevebloom55 @SarahEMyhre It is interesting that he is one of the very few apologists for climate deniers (though he would deny that) that is not right wing, libertarian, or fundamentalist. Is it oppotunism? He could easily present his arguments without associating with anti science fringe

But he never remotely suggested that and repeatedly said Any dem was way better than Trump. I heard him say it live as well
965885647532756992 2018-02-20 09:47:38 UTC <tonydunc> @CarnivoreKlein Nope. Goddard is a fraud. Not one skeptics Climate scientist ever references him for good reason
965884518786793473 2018-02-20 09:43:09 UTC <tonydunc> @MalyndaNyc @ggreenwald @RizviSalim MAYBE be the part where Bernie said Clinton is 100x better than Trump. And he was right

965849619262529536 2018-02-19 07:24:28 UTC <tonydunc> @NonsequiturThe @LTorcello That all makes perfect sense, and seems quite consistant
965662216606420992 2018-02-19 18:59:48 UTC <tonydunc> @NonsequiturThe @LTorcello Can you elaborate. I had never heard this argiment against him. Ok found some and can see a slippery slope argument. I personally feel birth is a reasonable dividing line, but that could be dependant on the context in the very extreme cases

965628212100390917 2018-02-19 16:44:40 UTC <tonydunc> @LHortonUEA I was there last month visiting elephant sanctuary. It is beautiful and reading this shocked me. We were told about the corruption but everything felt so safe and peaceful. They need international fonancial and technical support.
965626214089154561 2018-02-19 16:36:44 UTC <tonydunc> @biotweeps Thanks. Surprised at how emotional it feels to tell this simple version to a scientist. A deep part of me has always felt a failure. Yet the direction my life took has many many wonderful aspects. I never lost my love of science & twitter allows direct communicstion with so many.
965624377797693440 2018-02-19 16:29:26 UTC <tonydunc> @biotweeps Ps. At first school went to TA to explain relativistic theory I had developed based on Machs principle. high school physic teacher did not understand. TA humiliated me at my arrogance. Years later saw article about same concept by Dirac in 30s. I should have been encouraged
965623528463716353 2018-02-19 16:26:04 UTC <tonydunc> @biotweeps 2/2 went to other prestigious school for evolutionionary biology. Not allowed to matriculate. Encouraged by prof to continue. Aced class.  But discouraged by seeming egos of scientosts defendong their theories.  Developed aversion to math. More drugs.
965622147623383041 2018-02-19 16:20:35 UTC <tonydunc> @biotweeps 1/2 Went to high school where I was near top of class. Thought I was smarter than most. Studied astrophysics in college. It was hard! Was severely penalized for deriving equation in test instead of having memorized it.  Became discouraged. Stopped studying enough. Did drugs

964542905280057344 2018-02-16 16:52:03 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I corrected it on facebook the one instance I saw. How many people corrected the bernie supporter Antifa member thst I saw being bandied about gleefully. And this was not made up. The group admitted this. It was THEIR lie not the media. And I very quicly saw media correct this

964317499759218690 2018-02-15 01:56:22 UTC <tonydunc> @CitronCockatoo That made me laugh. Higher saving of lives how many lives are LOST in other developed countries because private guns dont protect them???? US has thousands more gun death from friends and relatives than all developed countries
964306132289425410 2018-02-15 01:11:12 UTC <tonydunc> @CitronCockatoo Did I need to differentiate the US from Somalia abd South Sudan?

964153455425318913 2018-02-15 15:04:31 UTC <tonydunc> @aaas @SarahEMyhre @stevebloom55 @MichaelEMann And Currys response to the Canadian ruling was interestingly silent on the question of Balls lack of credibility. I would think she would have serious bruises from her awkward fence straddling https://judithcurry.com/2018/02/14/update-libel-cases-and-the-climate-wars/
964152242130604032 2018-02-15 14:59:42 UTC <tonydunc> @CitronCockatoo Funny that is not what I said. The major correlation between gun violence and number of guns seems pretty well established. My belief is the costs will be so high getting really qualified armed people will be progibitive so there there will end up being more violence
964035684225953792 2018-02-14 07:16:32 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann @aaas @SarahEMyhre @stevebloom55 Yes. That is a genuine area of research in climate change, that he seems genuinely knowledgeable about. He appears to me to be an opportunist, but not as craven as Curry
963994387381391361 2018-02-14 04:32:26 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann @aaas @SarahEMyhre @stevebloom55 Not an accurare description. He has done real work i. Climate sciene and does understand the science. He claims to support action to limit CO2, but I have seen little to see that he actually cares. He may believe his own hype
963976285990113286 2018-02-14 03:20:31 UTC <tonydunc> Is this accuratehttps://twitter.com/mlpsta/status/963941654091591681
963975254640156673 2018-02-14 03:16:25 UTC <tonydunc> @realDonaldTrump @DowellRube Important point. Impeaching Trump and voting out republicans in 2018 can be a real start. Changing the culture to one that does not view violence as a solution to conflict. Treatingg guns like dangerous tools is key to that
963973895840813059 2018-02-14 03:11:01 UTC <tonydunc> @CitronCockatoo Just add a hundred thousand new guns to schools with no budget. So they pay $13/hr and hire sketchy security guards. What could possibly go wrong?
963972809092452352 2018-02-14 03:06:42 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann @aaas @SarahEMyhre He pretends to be an honest scientist persecuted by a corrupt ifeologocally droven cabal of scientists because he points out the limitations and exaggerations of this little theory that could cause disaster to humanity and the earth
963960074870968320 2018-02-14 02:16:06 UTC <tonydunc> @VariabilityBlog They are crowing about this victory at Wattsup. But all cmments and updates stopped. I am guessing about the time the judges ruling alwas actually available. Freedom of non credible speech may be the new battle cry
963959369133150211 2018-02-14 02:13:17 UTC <tonydunc> @wattsupwiththat Pretty funny reading these responses, wheb compared with what the judge actually ruled
963958325611200513 2018-02-14 02:09:08 UTC <tonydunc> @theresphysics @EileenOttawa Still it os quite a smackdown. I fear no that @MichaelEMann  might suffer a similar setback. This possibility had not occurred to me before, but it is so onvious as to seem inevitable now
963889106643308546 2018-02-14 21:34:05 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Possible take if you ignore all those things which are undeniable. So if none of that had been the reality. Her statement amounts to a dofference in outlook on what is acceptable diplomatic behavior toward a joint ally/enemy when host country in olympics enters the stadium
963888612591984642 2018-02-14 21:32:08 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 5/? . Would have been NO quite from her. Ignroing that the conservative panelist acknowledged that Pence support of Trump and policies was affirmstion of another murderous regime which  was more hypocrisy. And pretending that if Pence HAD stood you would be outraged. The worst
963887963791818752 2018-02-14 21:29:33 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 4/? Olympics and the fact that our ally made a decision that, while we might disagree with they have every right to do. Ignroing that Pence had publicly with much fanfare left a sports event becasue people protested a political action. Ignroring that without hos protest there
963887364195090433 2018-02-14 21:27:10 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 3/? It ignores that Breitbart lied that she said he should respect NK. Which she never says as she never  talks about seperate governments   Ignoring that this is a joint team with our ally as host country and then insisting that she is justifying NK when she is saying respect
963886852049723392 2018-02-14 21:25:08 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 2/? Ignoring  Breitbart cut and pasted their clip to purposefully not include universal agreement that NK is a murderous regime.also to show Her inderstanding that if that was the premise of the action he could not have come. Which undermines the argument that she is apologist
963886079215591424 2018-02-14 21:22:04 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 1/? Absolutely the opposite. You are taking a statement of hers completely out of context. ignorong that the context is the ENTIRE point of the statement. This is absoluely blatant by her choice of words. Ignoring that each panelist focused on this even the conservative one
963884047956049920 2018-02-14 21:13:59 UTC <tonydunc> @jk_rowling @GrrlScientist I have always read it as Herr mi own. Listened to the audiobooks so learned the proper pronunciation from her!
963862821191798791 2018-02-14 19:49:38 UTC <tonydunc> @mtobis This is not your first similar reference if I recall correctly
963862187663032321 2018-02-14 19:47:07 UTC <tonydunc> May very well behttps://twitter.com/yeswecrann/status/962961571403137029
963818934771306497 2018-02-14 16:55:15 UTC <tonydunc> @NGrossman81 Maybe. But it could also be reinforcing belief among those that have abandoned him not to go back. It is a legitimate factual political scandal. That it is not of the same scale as many others doesnt bother me
963791026656808960 2018-02-14 15:04:21 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom That is absurd. Her argument is if someone is so offensive DONT go shows  totally undermines your argument that she thinks NK should be respected. And you continue to ignore this was a joint team and she bever said respect NKand the whole point was his hypocrisy. All facts
963685158309253121 2018-02-14 08:03:40 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom The fuller clip shows agreement about how horrible North Korea is and Whoopi clearly saying, if you feel that strongly, dont go. So she was NOT saying respect North Korea. Respect Olympics and host nation. You can disagree but you cant accuse her of respecting NK
963684259969077248 2018-02-14 08:00:06 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom No. It was a joint delegation. Whoopi didnt say Respect North Korea. I just watched a fuller clip and it bears out exactly what I an sayinghttp://atlantablackstar.com/2018/02/13/sunny-hostin-calls-pence-olympics-protest-meghan-mccain-repeatedly-tries-deflect-gets-checked/
963679323789152256 2018-02-13 07:40:29 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom segment starting with the actual words used by Whoopi sent protest leave no doubt what point was. She NEVER said respect North Korea as it was a joint team. If Pence had stood, you would never have considered attacking him, as you would say he was just respecting South Korea
963678303122018305 2018-02-13 07:36:26 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom They used this to attack him by bringing up blatant hypocrisy. it is a minor issue. You say she says he should respect North Korea, which she never says. If it wasnt a lie it would be a difference of what constitutes appropriate diplomacy at worst.  again a minor issue.
963676853067223042 2018-02-13 07:30:40 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom And your argument doesnt even work then because this is our Ally and THEY decided to make a joint team. So sitting by definition and especially as tbe host country is disrespecting  them.
963676345929695232 2018-02-13 07:28:39 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom No you are just pretending that you are not making an ad hom attack clothed in fake outrage. Tbe worst argume t you could make is that she thinks diplomats should be diplomatic. But tbe reality is she and EACH panelist was pointing out hipocrisy
963675794538147843 2018-02-13 07:26:28 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Her statement was a blatant reference to the football protests. you know that, I know that Breitbart knows that. She did not bring mg this up and then someone reminded her of what he had done before.IF tbat had been tbe case then your argument about context would have merit
963672917438590976 2018-02-13 07:15:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom My argument is you are painting Whoopi as a north Korea apologist because she  thinks we should respect North Korea. When what she said was why doesnt he stand at the Olympics when tbe host country comes in after uou walked out of a football game condemning the same reasoning
963672233637007360 2018-02-13 07:12:19 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Both you and Bretbart are attacking Whoopi for wanting to respect North Korea. She never said any such tbing. And the pointnof you posts is to paint her as an apologist. We are not discussing diplomatic protocol, because it is a tiny issue
963671668345507845 2018-02-13 07:10:04 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Except the entire clip talks about Pences hypocrisy. One panelist said if he hadtaken a knee It would have been a proper protest. Whoopi did not say North Korea deserves respect. Which is what your post actually says
963670188347535360 2018-02-13 07:04:11 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom ONLY said it because of hypocrisy. Watch tbe clip again. Her crime has nothing to do with anything other than that. It is their country their decision. So Pence sits, she points out hipocrisy. Neither matters and your and Breitbarts sole purpose is to potray her as apologist.
963669077880340481 2018-02-13 06:59:46 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom This is a non issue. Pence sitting means nothing other than disrespect to both countries. One a murderous dictatorship. One a liberal democracy. Whoopi pointing out hypocrisy  has no relation to her views on North Korea
963668502904229888 2018-02-13 06:57:29 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 2/2 Attacking her is only possible because you ignore tbe context. If pence had stiod up you would say he was just doing his diomatic duty and aupporting our Ally in spite of their terrible decision to join teams.
963668113731538944 2018-02-13 06:55:57 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 1/2 Exactly their reasons for attacking Pence have nothing to do with the premise I advanced. Your premise was that Whoopi is terrible for saying Pence should have stood up. There is only one reason it was brought up. Because HE ATTACKED people who did not stand up.
963666676981084162 2018-02-13 06:50:14 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom The statement made by Whoopi ONLY occurred because of the premise that he was a hypocrite. Tbat was WHY she made the comment. This was the sole reason for the other comments. Without that tbere is NO QUOTE. No one would bring it up
963665920509046784 2018-02-13 06:47:14 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Your premise is based on a quote that is completely predicated on the context. Ifvthere was no Pemce football spectacle, therecwas no quote. You cannot say it is irrelevant. I acknowledge Pence can do what he wants. I bet Whoopi would too
963665127131222016 2018-02-13 06:44:04 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Which is kind of what the olympics is about. But again, no one was defending North Korea. They were ALL attacking pence for the hypocrisy of the football stunt. And  no evil was being committed at the Olympics
963661107796807680 2018-02-13 06:28:06 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Of course not. Especially not one as incompetent as our government. Exactly my point. There would have been no discussion of this if not for the football incident. If you watch the clip that is the entire point of what each person said
963659498228518913 2018-02-13 06:21:42 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom It canT NOT be related to fhe football issue since that was the ENTIRE point of the clncersation on of the clip breitbart posted. PENCE is a hypocrite he attacks leople who protest during sporting ecents but he does it too. End of story
963658741693517825 2018-02-13 06:18:42 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom But the real point is to attack Whoopi as somehow supporting North Korea. There is no ofher reaosn for either Breitbart post or our retweet.
963658420732747776 2018-02-13 06:17:26 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom No, my option would hqve shown support for South Korea, and disrespext for Norh Korea. But again tHEY decided to have a joint team. How could that NOT be disrespecting South Korea?
963658079907741702 2018-02-13 06:16:04 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Now if you can show that South Korea was somehow coerced into that decision then You would hace a valid point
963657829746962434 2018-02-13 06:15:05 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom That makes no sense. He CANT NOT have disrespeced South Korea. Their competitors were passing by IN THE HOST COUNTRY. EVERYONE ELSE STOOD. He swore NO oath to come to South Korea and dosreapext their sovereing decision to have a joint team
963656720865202176 2018-02-13 06:10:40 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Fir the 4th or 5th time@the ONLY reason this was commented in was BECAUSE Pence made a huge publix display of condemning political protest during a sports event. Calling that a strawman is ludicrous. It is the essence of the argument you are trying to make
963656308124680193 2018-02-13 06:09:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom What was the POINT of your retweeting breitbart. Why bring it up if you are not calling her an apologist for NK?  And why continue to say they didnt lie when I have watched the clip 4 times and she never said what the headline says?
963655673589452801 2018-02-13 06:06:31 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom And AGAIN the ONLY reason this came up and rhe ONLY thing that was discussed was PENCE using political protest after vocy and publocky condemning political protest. Ignoring that is creating a strawman, so Whiopi can be painted as apologist
963655293866598400 2018-02-13 06:05:00 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom No idea what you are talking about host county is South Korea. They are IN south Korea. He disrespected South Korean, which apparently within the rules had decided on a jount delegation. He disrepected both. I gave you practical option that would have been unambiguous
963654792504541184 2018-02-13 06:03:01 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Why the FUCK did he come to a country ( that is our ALLY) if he is so willing to disrespect them for teaming up with a brutal murderous dictatorship? Wouldnt be any political considerations going on there would there? Kind of Whoopis point
963654028407263233 2018-02-13 05:59:58 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom And your constant attempts to ignore the context, which was the ENTIRE point of the 2 minute clip, retrweet a headline that js a blatant lie and tour dishonesty in trying to tar someone as a North Korean apologist are duly noted
963652960684298241 2018-02-13 05:55:44 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Maybe every single intelligence service saying that Russia was cyber attacking US. Maybe Putin assassination of opponents. Lots of reasons, and lots of horribke countries. This was the HOST country in South Korea. He left himself open to hypocrisy by attacking people protesting
963652282851168256 2018-02-13 05:53:02 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom MONLY reasone for Breitbart to lie is to contend  Whoopi is apologist for North Korea. All she was saying was this was Olympics, he had condemned politicizing sports and was being a hypocrite here. If there was no joint team you might have a point. But he disrespected South Korea
963651482146037760 2018-02-13 05:49:51 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 2/2 NEVER would have been an ussue if had not made such a huge stink with hos propaganda move at the football game. came back to bite him in the ass. strawman is trying to portray Whoopi as somehow an apologist for North Korea. Which is only rationale for article, why they lied
963650732560998405 2018-02-13 05:46:53 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom 1/2 Never?  does this apply to Trump respecting Putin? She said that as a politician in a nonpolitical setting and the Olympics are specifically constituted to be outside of politics. Pence should have stood for the host country while their team was being honored.
963649668390572032 2018-02-13 05:42:39 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Breitbard article says not showing respect to North Korea. That is a blatant lie.
963649371832307712 2018-02-13 05:41:28 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I am not even saying he SHOULD have stood up. But he could have had a south korea flag that he waved as he stood and thrown down a North Korean flag as he sat down. Childish but it would have been unambiguous
963648940930461696 2018-02-13 05:39:45 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom The POINT is if he had NOT made such a big propaganda point ablut keaving the football game this ckncersation never would have happened. So your point is the strawman.
963648663741517825 2018-02-13 05:38:39 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom And you cannot disrespect one without inadvertantly disrespecting the other. Although I can undestand he was pussed at being placed to North Korean official who got more press than he did. Shows the lack repsect Trump admin has among our allies
963648167093915651 2018-02-13 05:36:41 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom You are ignoring their entire concersation and putting words in her mouth. The breitbart headline is an outright lie, she never suggested North Korea was not an inhumane disaster. Her point was politicians constantly do things for diplomtic reasons. And Pence is a hypocrite
963647372436955137 2018-02-13 05:33:31 UTC <tonydunc> @ScottPresler @MattAsherS Agreed. Turn against Trump and the blatant corruption and incompetence and unethical behavior that is rampant there
963646849063243782 2018-02-13 05:31:27 UTC <tonydunc> @ScottPresler @DonnaArchibal12 @ken30181 Those brown US Citizens. How dare they!!!
963646045984055296 2018-02-13 05:28:15 UTC <tonydunc> @DonaldJTrumpJr @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump @Hublife @ScottPresler @MaryGioiaGrace The Red Wave. Gotta love such absurd denial
963645685668171776 2018-02-13 05:26:49 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom For a JOINT delegation. The Breitbart headline is a lie. She never said respect North Korea
963644716075094016 2018-02-13 05:22:58 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I pointed out to you that the entire conversation was about Pence and his reaction to protesting a political issue at a sports event. You are taking her comment completely out of context. She said nothing remotely suggesting  North Korea was not a terrible inhumane dictatorship
963642105871650816 2018-02-13 05:12:36 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom How can the actual subject of the conversation be a strawman and a tangential issue not be a strawman?
963640163699216384 2018-02-13 05:04:53 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom And neither do professional football players. This was NOT about Korea, it was about Pence
963637437036711938 2018-02-13 04:54:03 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom This was a JOINT delegation. Was he not disrespecting South korea? He was the one who walked out  offended for football players making a political statement that he didnt like
963634862723870720 2018-02-13 04:43:49 UTC <tonydunc> @NGrossman81 This is also about increasing opposition to Trump. Whatever few honest fundamentalists still support him should renounce pYimg off adult film stars
963634326582779909 2018-02-13 04:41:41 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom You are asserting a strawman. This clip clearly shiws tbem ragging on Pence for walking out of football game and saying you should not mix politics and sports. Suggezting they are suporting North Korea is the strawman
963632175814979591 2018-02-13 04:33:08 UTC <tonydunc> @PhilipRucker @hardball @cherry_bethea He was fucking IMPEACHED for a consensual affair. But maybe you arent old enough to remember
963631832523788289 2018-02-13 04:31:46 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom Agreed. The point though was his condemning the kneeling.
963621805750710272 2018-02-13 03:51:56 UTC <tonydunc> @ken_crichlow Hey. She is allowed to have friends that espouse despicable anti american beliefs. Should not be hired by a reputable paper though
963621462748946437 2018-02-13 03:50:34 UTC <tonydunc> @ACNewman @MrMikeII If he likes ELP, maybe. He said he thinks the Beatles and Dylan are decent after all
963620469835554818 2018-02-13 03:46:37 UTC <tonydunc> @Toimatom I think you dont understand that this was about his attack on people kneeling for national antem
963618713768464384 2018-02-13 03:39:39 UTC <tonydunc> @drmichellelarue It is the POOP that stinks. I never noticed a smell when near the ocean and away from nests. And this with numerous species
963610547420848130 2018-02-13 03:07:12 UTC <tonydunc> @PhilipRucker @hardball @cherry_bethea After being told to resign by most of the party. Plenty of corroboration of Trump
963602432394743809 2018-02-13 02:34:57 UTC <tonydunc> @PhilipRucker @hardball @cherry_bethea Then why did Franken have to resign?
963594228113858560 2018-02-13 02:02:21 UTC <tonydunc> @PhilipRucker @hardball @cherry_bethea Cant be serious. Over a dozen credible woman have acused Trump, many with witnesses at the time. Franken had to resign for mucu less. Weiner too ended career. Party of family values is just a punch line

963584903475531776 2018-02-13 01:25:18 UTC <tonydunc> Agree, but Inam happy to use any reality thatbhelpsnother people stop supporting him ( except the hair. Anyone that leaves him just for that I dont want)https://twitter.com/proudresister/status/963436782686674944
963581260953202691 2018-02-13 01:10:49 UTC <tonydunc> @PhilipRucker @hardball @cherry_bethea I would certainly prefer Malania to Trump
963544089852604417 2018-02-13 22:43:07 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann Yeah. But, I have no problem being accused of going Godwin  when the analogy is valid. Trump and the rights propaganda often is stunningly similar
963513858248859650 2018-02-13 20:42:59 UTC <tonydunc> @MichaelEMann This is an old argument. It usually goes with the view that NAZIS were leftists

963130839889600514 2018-02-12 19:21:00 UTC <tonydunc> @Zerilos @divabusiness But how exciting for her if this is just another in a long list of accusations that does not go anywhere

962751462857232384 2018-02-11 18:13:30 UTC <tonydunc> @kevpluck @jeepgeek That was the FUNNIEST response I could have expected
962740557125701632 2018-02-11 17:30:10 UTC <tonydunc> @nathanpboston @AarneClimate He makes a valid point about overcpming last environmental crisis. Nitrogen fixing was a fortunate revolution that just required one technical fix. He does not address the orders of magnitide increase in scope climate change poses
962739998473801731 2018-02-11 17:27:57 UTC <tonydunc> @nathanpboston @AarneClimate 1/? I disagree. I think he does understand these issues. In article, he makes important  points but undermines them in some specifics. Dismissing postmodernism, marxism is against enlightenment principles. Suggesting Inequality is Ok because poverty decreaased ignores the same

I subscribed to SCI AM then & remember nothing from about global cooling

But at least you admit you are a Trump supporter! I see you did not engage in my thought experiment. Little reminder (grab by pussy, was on her like a bitch, Porn star sex, 19 sex harrassment claims) better?
959842621031178242 2018-02-03 17:34:48 UTC <tonydunc> @ggreenwald @Sharkyl @sun0369 @BlaqHook Trump supporters are often allergic to logic. They are the GOOD guys fighting against all us evil communists. Reality is hardly a consideration

Now are there MANY aspects of Trumps history that would suggest it could be valid? But even if  that particular is wrong does not mean all of it is wrong
959625266292252673 2018-02-02 03:11:07 UTC <tonydunc> @Comey @joeybaker09 You do realizevthat unverified does not mean fake and that salacious pretty much describrs Trumps ( she was married and I went after her like  a bitch, grab em by the pussy, attempted 3 some with porn stars while wife was with baby then paid her off) ethical nature.
959474051403145217 2018-02-02 17:10:14 UTC <tonydunc> @DrKateMarvel I think you are good enough, and Inhardly know you! To be fair almlst every@climate scientist I follow on Twitter I think is pretty darn good

The local paper for Helena Montana has a MISTAKE in it in 2012. But it ALSO reports that the UN made a critic of the the IPCC animal asessment the head of their agriculture organization! It doesnt get better than this

959288689015767041 2018-02-01 04:53:40 UTC <tonydunc> @jonathanvswan @morningjoehater @3jp__ That ended when they outed Valerie, and during Benghazi investigation

This was corrected as soon as glaciologists saw it. Inremember being shocked when this was first publicized and a few days later, the obvious correction was made
959268595602685952 2018-02-01 03:33:50 UTC <tonydunc> @BVerheggen @icarus62 @SturmLLiouville @climatefrauds Yeah. The Himalayan glaciers. You guys played thaf for all it was worth. Except every glaciologist knew itnwas wrong. And it was immediately corrected by them. Something you seem incapable of

He probably got that from mistakenly going to Heller website. Cant beat Trump 3 days ago though Sea ice is at RECORD levels. Not one word he saod wasnt a lie

959255540085002241 2018-02-01 02:41:57 UTC <tonydunc> @tan123 I never even heard of this. And it has no connection to any scientific research at the time. Apparentmy no one pushed this article for exactly those reasons

958813174236614658 2018-01-31 21:24:09 UTC <tonydunc> @cff1776 Exactly. All the states where republicans have control. African american poverty has been eradicated!

957346106609930240 2018-01-27 20:14:33 UTC <tonydunc> @voxdotcom @theresphysics I strongly oppose nuclear energy as well as flooding indigenous areas. But here have to be real tradeoffs to prevent the worst consequences of climate change

956373103407493121 2018-01-24 03:48:11 UTC <tonydunc> @scicurious The fear that sciences like biology and physics are going to be taken over by ideologues and corrupted is not realistic. What is needed is diverse perspectives and backgrounds to get more and different insights into solving problems.
956279107851038720 2018-01-24 21:34:40 UTC <tonydunc> @cliscep @theresphysics @SarahEMyhre I took a class w/ Allison Brooks in 1979 on evolution at GWU. She promoted the idea that social interactions were drivers of human intelligence when man the hunter was dominant paradigm. Spurred interesest in childhood development.

953753298640744449 2018-01-17 22:18:00 UTC <tonydunc> Grreat thread. Have not read article yet, but looks interestinghttps://twitter.com/mtobis/status/953743835795984385

953733644937498624 2018-01-17 20:59:55 UTC <tonydunc> @EthonRaptor @AndrewDessler @DuaeQuartunciae @mtobis Genuine skeptics who bring up valid issues I will respect and respond accordingly. Climate deniers who bring up valid issues, I will respect and respond accordingly if they continue to bring up rational arguments. I recently asked for help with a paper on clouds because of that
953732876578803714 2018-01-17 20:56:51 UTC <tonydunc> @EthonRaptor @AndrewDessler @DuaeQuartunciae @mtobis If someone promotes nazi or stalinist beliefs I will call them that unless they show me where my analysis is inacurate. If people have to resort to insisting on widespread scientific fraud I will call them a denier until they can prove fraud. If they prove fraud, I will apologize
953678619670384646 2018-01-17 17:21:16 UTC <tonydunc> @EthonRaptor @mtobis @AndrewDessler @DuaeQuartunciae Not sure I agree . Accurately naming things or attributes is valuable as long as people are willing to look at issues clearly. Sugar coating to appear reasonable runs risk of tacit acceptance. Acknowledging valid claims of people with opposing views is critical for credibility
953471043657699328 2018-01-16 03:36:26 UTC <tonydunc> @ClimateOfGavin What about regional differences. Is it much worse in china India, Indonesia where pollution is orders of magnitude worse than europe and North America?
953470044746510337 2018-01-16 03:32:27 UTC <tonydunc> @EthonRaptor @mtobis I do not hate people. I am honest and have real anger that people are so entrenched in ideology that they will oppose necesary measures to protect the planet and humanity from potential calamity. I do not hold grudges and will welcome anyone who ends up accepting rational science
953444562600693760 2018-01-16 01:51:12 UTC <tonydunc> @CharlesDarwinTX @EuphoniusNuts It may not be valid, but it certainly is a reasonable assessment
953432195380776962 2018-01-16 01:02:03 UTC <tonydunc> @theresphysics What bothers me is the continued repitition of the global cooling myth. They cherry pick the same stories every time and ignore the huge amount of counter evidence. I was a science nerd then and I barely remember it.

The science was published and well known among experts
953103611365658629 2018-01-15 03:16:23 UTC <tonydunc> @eszter_cs Seems to me this is bigger news than two decimal retweets?

952735593464725504 2018-01-14 02:54:01 UTC <tonydunc> @KirstenKing_ @morninggloria In going over my life since #metoo remembering sexual interactions where I was not paying attention to the woman and her real desires. The sex was never good, and I remained clueless about their feelings and concerns. Some was youth/inexperience, but unacceptable nonetheless
952733559919431680 2018-01-14 02:45:56 UTC <tonydunc> @LTorcello Agreed. It was established science, but the uncertainties were large enough to warrant some skepticism on the consequences being devaststing. Now it is likely that there will be devaststing consequences
952721776458588161 2018-01-14 01:59:06 UTC <tonydunc> @DeepakChopra @michaelshermer Why? He has little credibility
952721498355183616 2018-01-14 01:58:00 UTC <tonydunc> @shutupmay Ive always been mystified that none of my girlfriends did that. Thanks for clearing that up!
952720747662905344 2018-01-14 01:55:01 UTC <tonydunc> @joshtpm Actually what is amazing is a defensive back not looking to stop the receiver and missing him for a fame ending tackle, then taking out the OTHER defensive back who would also gave made the game ending tackle

952646300591443974 2018-01-14 20:59:12 UTC <tonydunc> @LTorcello 20 years ago there was still some reason to be somewhat skeptical of the actual outcomes. But it should still have warranted immediate action to until we knew more
