970561337259573248 2018-03-04 07:27:09 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @JamesGunn I can't believe how many times I've linked the dictionary lately, only to be told it's wrong.

969112263855554560 2018-02-28 07:29:03 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe @FedEx @DICKS @DebraMessing @gruntjeeper You are correct assault is a verb. Unfortunately where your argument breaks down is Assault Rifle is a noun. Hence the capital letter and the link.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assault%20rifle
969101252045848576 2018-02-28 06:45:18 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe @FedEx @DICKS @DebraMessing @gruntjeeper You still avoiding original comment. My Haynes manual says Austin Mini, funny it's still a car and cars still exist. Wow mind blown.

The original tweet was about Dicks, YOU AVOIDING ANSWERING THAT ONE. I think so. Fake news again and again. Or are you using alternative facts. @AlexVickeryHowe think we have a #Trumperoftheweek.
969089091848486912 2018-02-28 05:56:58 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @FedEx @DICKS @DebraMessing @gruntjeeper assume that you'd be happy. Anyway your just distracting from your original wrong statement.
969088688020836353 2018-02-28 05:55:22 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @FedEx @DICKS @DebraMessing @gruntjeeper Have you checked the dictionary. Don't really care about your colocual definition or even military definition, seen as you speak English I assume you'll be familiar with the dictionary definition. Seen as the whole of the Republican party is spouting the term "assault rifle" I'd

The fact that Dicks is stopping selling assault rifles at a subsidiary or the dictionary definition of an assault rifle. Cause at the moment you aren't making sense and are making yourself look stupid. Lets see if you can make a coherent sentence.
969034701573734400 2018-02-28 02:20:51 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @FedEx @DICKS @DebraMessing @gruntjeeper Plus read the dictionary, think you'll find assault rifle is spot on.

966803233577422848 2018-02-22 22:33:47 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @realDonaldTrump Experience from every other country shows school shootings last on average 0 minutes. Disgruntled students without guns can be handled by your existing highly trained teachers. No guns, problem solved instantly. NO DETERRENT NEEDED. #GunControlNow
964965836992561152 2018-02-17 20:52:38 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @RobertLeiba @JamesGunn Looks to me as if they were trying to tear the country apart. I think they've been remarkably successful.
964965341783719936 2018-02-17 20:50:40 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @shadowxaf @rusgreim In Ammendment 2 of your constitution, I'm sure it says something about being well regulated and reasonable people. But a 19 year old mentally ill man can go buy a semi auto assault rifle and go on a rampage. Pretty sure you need to put more controls in place.
964835247492816896 2018-02-17 12:13:43 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AidenWolfe @GinaEllis4 I've been telling that to 'thoughts and prayers' people for years. Funny most totally ignore.

964361914355630080 2018-02-15 04:52:52 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @goingglocal More none military action gun deaths in US since 1968, than American deaths in every recorded war they've ever had. That is truly shocking.

961751852986507264 2018-02-08 00:01:24 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @goingglocal Oh no! Not the Dictionary, you won't find a more Communist Fascist document in all the land. 
961747693428080641 2018-02-08 23:44:53 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @JohnCleese Sounds like us Welsh are thieves of the highest order.

960037179119386624 2018-02-03 06:27:54 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @JohnCleese With all the sycophants at the GOP not a lot.

953551844684414977 2018-01-17 08:57:30 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @JamesGunn That'll just mean the rest of him is bigger.
952506261798510592 2018-01-14 11:42:44 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @GOP You guys! You guys are the kings of fake news and 2/3 of the country know it. As well as most of the world.
952438793352527872 2018-01-13 07:14:38 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe Nope you carry on, he's definitely a contender.
952293644626624513 2018-01-13 21:37:52 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe Keep trying, you may get through to one or two eventually.
952027810385641472 2018-01-12 04:01:32 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @rmasher2 @wwshopgirl He got it even more wrong than that. The existing embassy is one of the only ones not actually owned by the country that occupies it. As well as that, the current embassy is horrible, which is why they are moving to a building that's purpose built and properly secure.
951205594760757248 2018-01-10 21:34:20 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @krassenstein Well that's an inconvenient fact, they'll have to report it as fake news.

950188178459189249 2018-01-07 02:11:30 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe It's the thick 30% only read the headlines. It would help if the online headlines related to the content of the article, far too much clickbait. Can't blame the news outlets though, they only get paid for the clicks.
948421466504089600 2018-01-02 05:11:13 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @krassenstein Problem is that they can find lies in seconds as well.

940541827962216448 2017-12-12 11:20:20 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe Huge I'd say. If your educated you've learnt how to research and verify sources. If you do that you see all trumps comments for what they are, lies.
940515596684312576 2017-12-12 09:36:06 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @AlexVickeryHowe Beggers belief, just when you think you've heard the worst, another one aims even lower.

However 30 odd % are too thick to see it and 0.001 % are actually going to benefit. He said it himself, "if I want to become president I'll turn Republican and lie."

934032927804891138 2017-11-24 12:16:18 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @AJemaineClement @AlexVickeryHowe @kapaibro @PeterSKR_syd Absolutely true I'm afraid. They've shown it time and again, but like most continuing Trump supporters your blinkers must be stapled on.

934031742293327872 2017-11-24 12:11:35 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @AJemaineClement @kapaibro @AlexVickeryHowe @PeterSKR_syd Mate the WHOLE conversation from the start shows you have only a basic understanding of the English language, and really really need to update you dictionary. Hopefully then you'll be able to see the similarities between the definition of fascism and the Trumps!
934017494531969024 2017-11-24 11:14:58 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @AJemaineClement @AlexVickeryHowe @kapaibro @PeterSKR_syd Trump and family put themselves  above all others. They belittle with regards to race and sex. Have a dictorial leader. Very very close to the actual definition of fascism.

933824164833591296 2017-11-23 22:26:45 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kapaibro @PeterSKR_syd @AJemaineClement Yep. That's what I thought you were getting at. 
933818391281876992 2017-11-23 22:03:48 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @AJemaineClement @kapaibro @PeterSKR_syd OMG I didn't realize Jemaine was right-wing, (see aforementioned dictionaries (apart from Puffer Pete's apparently) hahaha. Not sure you wanna carry this conversation on bro, it seems to be going in circles, and I'm having far too much fun 
933601523560456192 2017-11-22 07:42:03 UTC <SimonCa96990704> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kapaibro @PeterSKR_syd Nah pretty sure everyone else here has an accurate and nuanced understanding of what  @AJemaineClement was getting at bro.
