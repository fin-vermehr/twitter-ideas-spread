965744686022496256 2018-02-19 00:27:30 UTC <skittishscot37> I am spinning trying to take it all in...this has has to change and I will find a way. #iamresponsible
965744681144537088 2018-02-19 00:27:29 UTC <skittishscot37> I am sincere in this post. I see us being corralled into two separate pens; not an open pasture where our freedoms are truly in form. We are villifying anyone who thinks differently; bashing entire generations; and turning deaf ears on those who need to be heard.
965744679101915136 2018-02-19 00:27:28 UTC <skittishscot37> My questions: are we sure there are only 2 sides? Are we promoting/arguing/presenting the correct problems? Are we being informed by honest people without scripts and/or agendas?
965744676375547910 2018-02-19 00:27:28 UTC <skittishscot37> Most of us are being exposed to differing sides of arguments. 2 sides to every story is what we've been taught.
965373313903157248 2018-02-18 23:51:48 UTC <skittishscot37> It's not just gun control. It's not just mental illness. It's definitely not politics or race. It is lack of community. Therefore, I take responsibility. I have not done nearly enough to help.  I can't point fingers until I step up and do something. #iamresponsible
934973005930823680 2017-11-26 02:31:50 UTC <skittishscot37> Excitement uncontained, for at least a second or 2...my crush just asked if I was seeing anybody! !!! Then he slid me his card. Seems that he takes my insurance and has flexible office hours. Anyone know what an MSW and a PsyD is?  Seems intriguing...
934957114828771328 2017-11-26 01:28:41 UTC <skittishscot37> So, there's the whole "if at you first you don't succeed" thing. Supposedly,  you just dust yourself off and try, try again. But what do you do when it's the 1,396,509th time of not succeeding? Is it still the dusting thing?

932424988853964800 2017-11-19 01:46:55 UTC <skittishscot37> Yes, Moose. It's almost time to steal Christmas again... #femalegrinch #bahhumbugpic.twitter.com/KGedDbFMdp
931619489287983104 2017-11-17 20:26:09 UTC <skittishscot37> Public bathrooms. The only time  you try to convince yourself that peeing your pants isn't that bad. I think a date with Hollywood Harvey What'shisname would be safer than whatever happened in that hellish room. My bladder actually yelped #notenoughbleachintheworld

If anyone needs an all natural, possibly non toxic paint stripper, I have a whole pot of it.  And after 2 cups of said substance, I am free today to do ALL the things that need done-everywhere....
931002652393201665 2017-11-15 03:35:04 UTC <skittishscot37> Tonight I was able to experience a wonderful thing: staring off into space while pumping gas.  Yep, my mind just drifted away.  All this 2 days before payday. I'm like a boss or something.  It doesn't matter that I prepaid, let let me enjoy the moment...
930953805344202753 2017-11-15 00:20:58 UTC <skittishscot37> Well, I'm glad they put this warning out there (ranks up there with the one on curling irons being for external use only).  We have the Bicentennial plates, the In God We Trust plates, and now the new Papa Hut Caesar plates...http://wsbt.com/news/offbeat/police-car-had-license-plate-made-from-pizza-box

926276326352412672 2017-11-02 02:34:20 UTC <skittishscot37> T'was the night before payday, and all thru my purse, not a dollar was stirring, so loudly I curse.. #singlemomlife
925219381994491904 2017-10-30 04:34:25 UTC <skittishscot37> Me: **heading out** Mom: you gonna put makeup on? Me: I have makeup on... Mom:Ooh, I'm sorry...  (Thanks for the porcelain complexion)
923633403878150144 2017-10-26 19:32:18 UTC <skittishscot37> That awkward moment when you think your coworker says, "I gotta leave."  When she actually said, "I got Aleve." #abandonmentissues
917212714182807552 2017-10-08 02:18:46 UTC <skittishscot37> Wishing retrospective anxiety made me think introspectively instead of turning into a shivering puddle of drool.  #anxiety
