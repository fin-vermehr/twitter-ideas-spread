972564648540155905 2018-03-10 20:07:36 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump We will worry about the North Korea meeting, when and if it happens.  For now, we would like to focus on Russian Sanctions, Gun Control and your Stormy Daniels campaign payment. You can try to distract us, but it won't work.  #Sanctions #BanAssaultWeapons #NoNRAMoney

972537755493392384 2018-03-10 18:20:44 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @DGB_JAIID I am not very religious, but know from personal experience that there is a God. The God I know is all light and goodness. I believe God will welcome you, your soul will live on. So while it is hard to say goodbye, know in your heart that you are loved and this is not the end.
972491989177585664 2018-03-10 15:18:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @RepMarkMeadows Let's make this clear, taking away 2nd ammendment rights & banning assault weapons are NOT the same thing.  Common sense gun control is needed. No citizen needs an assault rifle for hunting/self defense. No one who is mentally ill or convicted of domestic abuse should have a gun.

All of the thoughts and prayers in the world will not bring these victims back to their families.  How many more Americans have to die for you to act on gun control?  #BanAssaultWeapons #GunReformNow
972278141971582976 2018-03-09 01:09:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @2HawkEye2018 I suggest an old fashioned gun fight to solve the dotard/rocketman fued.  But instead of pistols, we arm them both with the (NRA's Favorite Murder Weapon) AR-15's. They take their required steps turn and shoot... We crown the winner, and throw a parade.

971888314226704386 2018-03-08 23:20:05 UTC <_lynnwolf_> The evidence is overwhelming: Trump really is an idiot.

It helped you personally to the tune of 500k from the Koch Brothers, but normal middle class Americans, not so much.  Even Koch says you were bought by big industry, just like the NRA.  This will NOT end well for you.

969745785142349824 2018-03-02 01:26:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Liberals don't want to abolish the 2nd ammendment, they want common sense gun reform, complete background checks and closed gun show loopholes.  Liberals want assault weapons banned for civilian use.  What is so crazy about that?  It's common sense and works for other countries.

967752078142689280 2018-02-25 13:24:10 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @NRA @TonyAaronII @JWadeTaylor So @realDonaldTrump, you want a teacher with a handgun to go up against a crazy with this AR-15.  Watch the clip, then let's take bets on who wins.
967583178985738240 2018-02-24 02:13:01 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @ShereeIsHopeful Yes, maybe not quite so vocal... But stupid yes.  Now they have the ultimate role model.
967582679351873536 2018-02-24 02:11:02 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @brycetache Can we have a parade once he's indicted?  I think that would be nice, he really wants one.

967573661082320896 2018-02-24 01:35:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump How many indictments?  And these were the "very best" people that you hired.  The very best people you hired are crooks.  Mueller is picking them off one by one.  And you are next.  Can't wait.  We will have a huge parade... Biggest crowd ever.
967571822475702272 2018-02-24 01:27:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Wow, #LiarInChief the Nunes memo was not reviewed or approved by the FBI, in fact, they warned that it was very misleading.  The counter memo, on the other hand, was reviewed and approved as accurate.  Congrats on that Presidential Most Lies in history award.  Well deserved!
967570491736252417 2018-02-24 01:22:36 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump By enjoy, do you mean tuning to a different channel?  Or perhaps playing a drinking game where everybody drinks each time you blame something on Hillary, Obama or the Democrats?  I got hammered during your last speech, such a great game.

967236578409156608 2018-02-23 03:15:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Ernest_T_ @Emma4Change Maybe there is a common ground for us all.  People think the left is against the 2nd ammendment, but I think the majority are not.  Like both of you, we choose life over sport and want common sense reform. Ultimately, we can't have ANY lobbyists influencing how our lawmakers vote

Anyway to do the same thing for contacting all of the NRA paid politicians?  I am sending daily messages to my state reps, but I would love to see each of them contacted in mass.
967229288964640768 2018-02-23 02:46:47 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @2fishie @celiebugpro Thank you for making a stand.  Many people think the left is against the 2nd ammendment.  But I think the majority are not.  Like you, we choose life over sport.  Ultimately, we cannot have ANY groups/companies/lobbyists influencing our lawmakers to vote a certain way.

967055688336838656 2018-02-23 15:16:57 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CNN Get real @realDonaldTrump, a rent  cop with a pistol will NOT win against a crazy with an AR-15.  You (Mr. Draft Dodger) would've never gone into the school. That is why your arming teachers plan will never work... those teachers would be outgunned & end up being the first target
967033680358146048 2018-02-23 13:49:30 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump We do not NEED the wall.  We NEED to #BanAssaultWeapons.  And one more thing #MoronInChief, we NEED our president to grow up and stop blaming Democrats or Hillary or Obama for anything that goes wrong.

966877641696362496 2018-02-22 03:29:28 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @TuckerCarlson @CNN @realDonaldTrump And yet you don't have the balls to show up to hear the survivors speak.  You invite a few folks to talk that are vetted beforehand to be Pro-Gun and Pro-Trump. Anything to avoid conflict or a differing opinion. Survivors beg to speak with you, but you don't care to listen.
966822105617715200 2018-02-22 23:48:47 UTC <_lynnwolf_> The teachers that are armed with the handguns will be the shooter with the AR-15's first target.  REALLY BAD IDEA.  #BanAssaultWeapons Trump proposes bonuses for teachers who get gun traininghttp://flip.it/880a4y
966821023847993345 2018-02-22 23:44:29 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @NRA @SenSchumer Its a win/win for Trump, GOP, and the NRA.

966684231790485504 2018-02-22 14:40:55 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump This is all good, but Assault Weapons must also go.  No civilian needs a gun capable of shooting off hundreds of rounds in a manner of minutes.  A teacher with a handgun would not stand a chance against that. The goal here is to get guns OUT of schools not IN. #BanAssaultWeapons

It's a really stupid idea, but it's one way to keep the GOP & the NRA happy. Trump suggests we arm teachers. NRA is happy- they sell more guns. GOP is happy- they continue to get NRA $$ while appearing to care and act on the issue.
966448846204268545 2018-02-21 23:05:35 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Michael47504992 @WilDonnelly What happens when a teacher accidentally shoots a student near the shooter or a student takes a teacher's gun?  Combating shootings by adding more guns in schools is asking for trouble.  Likely a NRA & GOP idea, that meets both agendas- acting on issue while selling more guns.
966369762652585984 2018-02-21 17:51:20 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Question: If the President of the United States was a true leader and really cared about the people, would he be meeting with and listening to the thousands of kids protesting gun violence just outside the White House or sitting on his ass casting blame on Democrats and Obama?
966311484568539137 2018-02-21 13:59:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> If a NRA supported politician asks you for your vote, tell them "Now is not the time".
966162310476779520 2018-02-20 04:06:59 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @malditaseacaraj It is hard to believe that we are used to the President of the United States denigrating & bullying people on Twitter. He blames others for his failures & mistakes, & berates anyone who disagrees with him. He calls negative coverage- Fake News.  We are SO much better than this.

The list goes on and on.

965245249248464896 2018-02-18 15:22:55 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump What are you trying to shift the attention from this morning Donnie?  The Russian election interference that helped you win the presidency or the fact that you repealed gun control legislation that could have prevented #Parkland ?
965234132526788608 2018-02-18 14:38:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Blame it on the FBI. This is the one thing you are good at, Blame. FBI, Hillary, Obama, Democrats... It is always someone else's fault.  Who is the one person in the USA who could have banned Assault Rifles or made it so a mentally ill person or teenager could not by a gun?
965228976972148736 2018-02-18 14:18:15 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump They are laughing at you.  You know #TrumpIsOurs trended in Russia.

Anyone with half a brain can see that they discredited Clinton at every opportunity and boosted you.  Why don't you punish Russia with sanctions if you are so innocent?  Why would you allow them to disrupt our democracy?

And you are right, maybe that kid would have gotten an assault rifle illegally, but maybe not.  Thanks for your opinion.
964934231049822208 2018-02-17 18:47:02 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Shareblue @tedcruzsenate No-one is suggesting taking guns away from law abiding citizens. Your 'do nothing' strategy is what is laughable.  How about common sense gun reform. #BanAssaultWeapons, as they serve no valuable purpose except in war.  Other countries have done it, and it works.

964876677074554880 2018-02-17 14:58:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SpeakerRyan So you have known this for how long?  Why haven't you acted sooner?  Beyond measures blocking interference, why no sanctions? Trump blocked Russian sanctions, but Congress can act without him.  It was voted on and overwhelming approved. Why hasn't Congress acted on the sanctions?

More  importantly, if assault rifles were illegal, could any of these tragedies been prevented or resulted in fewer casualties?  Please answer, as I strive to understand.
964686373943959552 2018-02-16 02:22:09 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @spudsforever @SenFeinstein Good start, but more important to #BanAssaultWeapons   This is the one thing that will make the biggest difference.

Trump is trying to shift the focus off the fact that a disturbed 19 year-old was able to buy an assault weapon. Trump rolled back legislation on assault weapons & the ability for mentally ill to possess guns.

Who talks about themselves in the third person or retweets anything even remotely positive about themselves?  Ego much?  Let me make this clear, you do not represent me or the great country I love.  You do not deserve the title of President.
962493389836029952 2018-02-10 01:08:01 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump You overestimate the value of a wall, since most immigrants arrive by sea. Issues that pose a much greater risk to Americans include: Opiod Crisis, Russian Hacking, Mass Shootings, Increased Racism/Hate Crimes & Lack of Healthcare.  Your priorities do NOT align with the people's.

Russians MUST be held accountable for election hacking. #sanctions.  Blindly supporting @POTUS is wrong. You MUST call him out and fight for what is right. THAT is what you were elected to do.
962337873306509312 2018-02-10 14:50:03 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @DemWrite This is exactly why the GOP underestimates #TheResistance.

961424715326869504 2018-02-07 02:21:29 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump All Dems & Repubs support our Military.  But USA spends much more on military than other countries do.  Keep military spending the same then optimize funding at home. America shouldn't have kids w/out healthcare or w/out adequate food or shelter.  America 1st, right? People 1st!
961291592358342657 2018-02-07 17:32:30 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump What good does a tweet like this do? How does it help the American public? Please ask yourself that before you start typing. If it adds zero value and is negative in nature,  don't send it. You are the President of the United States.  Act like it, or at least, act like an adult.
961246388876206081 2018-02-07 14:32:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PressSec How do your negative partisan rants help Americans?  What positive difference do they will make? Between you, @realDonaldTrump and @SenateMajLdr, all I see is Dem bashing, name calling and bragging.  We would be better off if you would all just keep your negativity to yourself.
961009495936823296 2018-02-06 22:51:33 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CREWcrew Cool Story Bro.... But completely unbelievable.
960996970520367104 2018-02-06 22:01:46 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenateMajLdr Why is every single tweet used to disparage Democrats?  It is NOT us against them... Unless you and Trump continue to divide.  How does this help?  STOP the constant negative divisive language.
960980194386378752 2018-02-06 20:55:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump I wish we would have had your immigration policy in place when your grandfather immigrated to the US.  Then you wouldn't be here and the US would be great again.

960924445748744192 2018-02-06 17:13:35 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Colts @realDonaldTrump Using the Colts players death to promote your political agenda is a "shithole" thing to do.  We ALL notice your lack of tweets in response to hundreds of school shootings by American citizens. Why is that @POTUS? NRA Support? #guncontrol
960695286858506240 2018-02-05 02:02:59 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @davidaxelrod Nope, he won (forget Russian interference & popular vote).  We need to do the American thing and praise him, bow when he walks by, maybe salute, compliment him a lot. Like, you really are a stable genius.  Your hands are much larger than they appear on TV, and Great Hair!
960598200712335360 2018-02-05 19:37:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PressSec Sarah, If you need more taxcut stories to highlight, you can give a shout-out to companies that are absorbing millions in tax savings to increase their bottom line, fatten C-level wallets & buy back stock. May also want to call attention to GOP campaign donations.  It's HUGE!
960525341025619968 2018-02-05 14:47:41 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Yes, Donnie @foxandfriends is the ONE single honest media in the world.  ALL of the rest lie. It's a huge conspiracy and everyone is in on it.  They are so jealous of (The Stable Genius) that they make up stories to try to bring you down.  Everyone is soooo mean.
960139449521799168 2018-02-04 13:14:17 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Like your tweet, the memo is incomplete & misleading. And no Dem rebuttal- Why? Americans want the truth & more transparency in government. You smear honest & trustworthy FBI, most Republicans, some you appointed, for what?Leave them alone, if you're innocent, they will prove it.

959856180746178560 2018-02-03 18:28:41 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @POTUS @GOP A better fundraiser for the GOP would be bumper stickers that say "Veterans Against Trump".  Or if you want to make it even more popular, go with "Americans Against Trump".  It would be HUGE.
959854337672581126 2018-02-03 18:21:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PRyan The Teacher gets an $1.50 a week raise.  Koch Brothers give you a $500,000 campaign donation, because of their billion dollar tax break.  Sounds fair.
959822619435589632 2018-02-03 16:15:19 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Yo memo is so limp, even Stormy Daniels couldn't get a rise out it.  #YoMemoJokes
959820591288242178 2018-02-03 16:07:16 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @kdvncm Perbaps the perception that Trump was somewhat more presidential in #SOTU?
959810726293573638 2018-02-03 15:28:04 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump If there was or is no collusion with Russia, why have you not enforced sanctions against Russia when both the House and the Senate overwhelming supported it?  #TrumpIsOurs is trending in Russia because you do NOT hold them responsible.  If you are not #PutinsPuppet PROVE IT!
959808894645231616 2018-02-03 15:20:47 UTC <_lynnwolf_> GOP is oblivious to their biggest threat. Millions of independent/politically inactive Americans are joining the fight for freedom of speech, FBI/Justice Dpt independence, transparency, equal rights.. The GOP is shrinking, #Resistance is growing. Democracy IS worth fighting for.
959608633356177408 2018-02-02 02:05:01 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PressSec Why would we believe you over @WSJ?  You are consistent with the false narrative and fake truths. Your job sucks, I get that. Trying to make sense of Trump's ramblings or justify his non-truths must be incredibly difficult.  Save your breath... He is not worth lying for.
959568927671058433 2018-02-02 23:27:14 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @nytopinion Great idea.  I sure as hell don't want to pay for it.  Let Trump and his entire base chip in, get their name in big bold letters.  They could all be sooooo proud and we wouldn't inherit the debt.
959462274183331840 2018-02-02 16:23:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CREWcrew @POTUS If you're going to talk about transparency, you need to make some changes.  If you want Americans to trust you and to support your legislation and agenda it starts with honesty and complete disclosure.

959414932533071874 2018-02-02 13:15:19 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump STOP attacking the FBI and Justice Department. These men & women work hard every day to make sure Americans are safe. Why must you turn everything into a war and bad mouth anyone with a differing opinion?   DO your job and leave them the hell alone so they can do theirs.
959262328503095296 2018-02-01 03:08:56 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Fake News Sarah.  Look at the polls. No way for you to spin this one to make it true. Why don't you let the public know why there were no sanctions on Russia when the vast majority of both Senate and House voted for sanctions?  No mention of Russia in #SOTU Why? #PutinsPuppet

958570205525037057 2018-01-30 05:18:41 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi In todays political climate, its difficult to remain positive & hopeful. @POTUS get a pass on racism, infidelity, lying, collusion. Then Kennedy speaks & I remember that Dreamers, Environment, School Safety, Equal Rights, fighting Russian Interference. They ARE worth it. #Resist
958552249084645377 2018-01-30 04:07:19 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @JoyAnnReid Kennedy was more presidential, more believable, more likeable. Trump was obviously very scripted and misleading. The Elephant in the room was Russia. Very telling that @realDonaldTrump avoids the subject. Congress and the House voted for sanctions.  POTUS ignored.
958550254852374529 2018-01-30 03:59:24 UTC <_lynnwolf_> #SOTU @realDonaldTrump was handed his ass by a very young "more presidential" Senator.  Kennedy showed more heart, more care for the people than POTUS.
958549369556488192 2018-01-30 03:55:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @RepJoeKennedy @NancyPelosi Great job.  Trump should be so presidential.  Speaking fron the heart, caring about Americans.  No lies, no smokescreens, positive energy, positive outlook.
958540742321999872 2018-01-30 03:21:36 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @VP   Your silence is complicent.  By supporting @realDonaldTrump you are condoning lying, racism, collusion, infidelity, ignorance, and decency of any kind.  As a religious man, I do not understand how you can sleep at night.  #SOTU

The American public is not near as stupid as you think we are. Just because you say everything is great... Doesn't make it true. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS is the least popular president in history.

THAT is the people speaking loud & clear.

958185745361063936 2018-01-29 03:50:58 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @funder Yet, we apply no sanctions. You would think that if Trump wanted to prove he didn't collude with Russia, he would send a strong message. Applying no sanctions shows just the opposite.  His inaction is un-American and demonstrates collusion or corruption. Huge threat to democracy.
958181139696504832 2018-01-29 03:32:40 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CREWcrew Of course @realDonaldTrump didn't apply sanctions against Russia.  If he did, Russia is likely to release the whatever they are holding over his head.  The voting interference?  The hooker video?  Money laundering? Trump hotel in Russia? Who the hell knows?  Putin owns Trump.
958166965964636160 2018-01-29 02:36:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump How can you justify no sanctions on Russia?  Is Russia blackmailing you?  Do you owe them a private debt for the election help?  WTF?

957717924734799873 2018-01-28 20:52:01 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Black unemployment dropped from 12.7% to 7.8% under Obama.  It has dropped from 7.8% to 6.8% under Trump.  pic.twitter.com/aEQm5tMltn         Why not take credit for your own accomplishments?  Like paying off a porn star or calling Haiti and Africa shithole countries?
957648918619320320 2018-01-28 16:17:49 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Great Job Donnie. Black unemployment is lower. But what about respect?  What about equality?  You have done NOTHING, but encourage racism and divisiveness in America. The KKK originated your stupid Make America Great Again slogan.  America has ALWAYS been great. NO THANKS TO YOU.
957603346629709824 2018-01-28 13:16:43 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Your constant blame of Dems is dividing this country, and it is NOT working. Why don't you try something new? Work with both parties, listen, learn, develop ideas into working legislation, rather than just tearing everything & everyone apart.  Act like a president for a change.
957285883685801986 2018-01-27 16:15:14 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Great idea for you that gets you off the hook for saying over and over that Mexico would pay for the wall.  You and all your fans can donate the 32 billion for the wall instead of taxing the crap out of us who don't want it.  Perfect right?  You get your wall, everyone is happy.
957057227927576576 2018-01-26 01:06:39 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @wef @realDonaldTrump Look at me.  I am so popular.  I am like a stable genius, you know.

954915920559923200 2018-01-20 03:17:51 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @globalnews Yo Donnie... @realDonaldTrump, I agree.  You ARE responsible.  You could have avoided it.  Don't you just hate when your own words bite you in the ass?
954913905893048320 2018-01-20 03:09:51 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenateMajLdr Dreamers are NOT illegal immigrants.  CHIP and DACA are NOT bargaining chips, they are the RIGHT thing to do.  #TrumpShutdown #mcconnelshutdown, there is No Way you can put this on Schumer or Democrats.  Remember who voted you in... And represent the people.
954912602143981568 2018-01-20 03:04:40 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenateMajLdr Wrong Mitch.  The shutdown is on Trump and YOU played a huge part in it as well.
954895900253532160 2018-01-20 01:58:18 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @The_UnSilent_ What do you think @realDonaldTrump?  The crowd protesting you is much bigger than your inauguration crowd. If you want 2020, affect the people's agenda.  We support DACA, CHIP, Military and current immigration vetting process. We DO NOT support your wall and will NOT pay for it.

954737381206364160 2018-01-20 15:28:24 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Dreamers are NOT illegal immigrants nor are they bargaining chips to try to pass less popular legislation.  #TrumpShutdown
954735626632466433 2018-01-20 15:21:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump When the Obama administration had a government shutdown, you said it was 100% the president's fault, so take credit for your handiwork.  This shutdown is NOT on the democrats, it is on you!
954734985235361792 2018-01-20 15:18:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump With you at the helm we are no longer first.  Congrats on your most recent success.  #GovernmentShutdown
954734580673720322 2018-01-20 15:17:16 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Go celebrate your Government Shutdown and "Worst First Year President EVER" award. You deserve all the fake praise your Mar-A-Lago buddies will heap on you.
954732263115247616 2018-01-20 15:08:04 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @Mikel_Jollett Yes, Congrats Donnie on the government shutdown!  We are so Flippin proud of you. Also great job on the lowest approval rating for a first year president EVER.  You are, not only like a stable genius, but you won the worst president title.  Time to celebrate!
954727688232685574 2018-01-20 14:49:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung @robreiner says it well.  Represent the people.  This decision should be a very easy one.
954564104504692737 2018-01-19 03:59:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump A shutdown, is 100% on you. You could prevent it. Get your head out of your ass and lead. Not just the Republicans, lead all & make concessions for the bipartisan majority. Most people do NOT want the wall, do want DACA & CHIP funding.  You want people to like you?  Get it done!

954151515337494528 2018-01-18 00:40:23 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenDonnelly Senator Donnelly, please support Net Neutrality.  It is the right thing to do.

953455438145695744 2018-01-16 02:34:25 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump These are the stats for international terrorist attacks. You tweet out partial info that does not tell the whole truth. TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH. You know that most people don't read the fine print..Hell you probably don't. But many of us do, and we will NEVER trust your half truths.
953451021245865985 2018-01-16 02:16:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill That's our President.  Makes you really proud to be an American.  @realDonaldTrump Another thing for you to brag about.
953450628008771584 2018-01-16 02:15:18 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenGillibrand @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung Please support CHIP funding.  It is the right thing to do.  In different circumstances, this could be your child/children. Can you imagine not being able to get them adequate medical care?
953449394271150082 2018-01-16 02:10:24 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenatorDurbin The people support you and agree, Senator.  Let us know what we can do.
953317540649893889 2018-01-16 17:26:28 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Amy_Siskind @senatorperdue @SenatorCotton You have the opportunity to admit to the shithole/shithouse cover that may allow your constituents to trust you again.  Because If you don't, the lies will follow you, we will not forget when it comes election time. NEVER choose party over honesty.
953276207302356992 2018-01-16 14:42:13 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Poor little Donald.  Everyone is out to get you. The media makes up stories to make you look bad.  People protest in the streets against you. I think you ought to quit this job and play golf or something.  Your life before was a lot more fun and the people you paid off liked you.
953273664862121984 2018-01-16 14:32:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Poor little Donald, can't take it when people disagree with him.  Calls them bad names, puts them down.  The media reports what they see, good and bad.  You do NOT do yourself any favors with your Twitter temper tantrums.  GROW the F UP!
953271336234815489 2018-01-16 14:22:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly Please vote to overrule Net Neutrality.   You are not representing the people of Indiana if you dont.
953061535479422976 2018-01-15 00:29:11 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @AlexKoppelman Seriously dude, why don't you show the National Enquirer?  The wedding was on, then called off when Gwen found out that Blake was an alien.  You are right, I don't trust those credible news sources either.
953058176265531392 2018-01-15 00:15:50 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @tonyposnanski @FLOTUS Can you get your husband to stop being a bully? This would really give the America faith in your ability to make a noticeable change.  Perhaps he could channel his anger by. ..punching a bag, throwing a temper tantrum, hiring a porn star (JK That one didn't work).
953033777088991232 2018-01-15 22:38:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump How about Lindsey Graham who indicated you said the same thing? And so predictable for you to demean Durbin, we ALL knew it was coming. He is an honest, respected Senator. YOU stopped DACA and military funding has nothing to do with it.  Stop blaming others and GROW THE F UP!
952909169954381824 2018-01-15 14:23:44 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @senatorperdue @SenatorCotton @thehill I am hearing now that your lie was based on you hearing POTUS say "Shithouse' instead of" Shithole".  Either wrong in describing another country.  POTUS brags about saying it, and you both get branded (rightfully so) as liars by trying to protect him. Is it worth it?
952905953321668608 2018-01-15 14:10:58 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @robreiner Let the sunrise remind you, that this too will pass.
952905604691095553 2018-01-15 14:09:34 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Keep up the good work Senator Lieu.  We appreciate your voice and appreciate you standing up for what is right.
952903056869482501 2018-01-15 13:59:27 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @KamalaHarris You are awesome, Senator Harris!  I wish there were more in the Senate that would speak from the heart and really fight for what is right.
952740807479648256 2018-01-14 03:14:44 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @MaggieJordanACN Great work @realDonaldTrump make sure to brag about these in the morning when you take credit for lack or airline deaths and the sun rising.
952632119855075328 2018-01-14 20:02:51 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill Yo, @SenatorCotton @senatorperdue Do you still not recall hearing "shithole countries" come out of POTUS mouth?  Still glad you lied?
952577820169003009 2018-01-14 16:27:05 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SecNielsen Shame on you for lying to protect POTUS.  Racism cannot be overlooked.  Republican Party before Honesty/Integrity?  You do NOT represent your constituents or any Americans by being a follower or a yes-man.  America is better than this.  You are better than this.
952342312230817793 2018-01-13 00:51:15 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @sendavidperdue @SenatorCotton   Congratulations, you now have new accomplishments to add to your resume.   Lying to protect POTUS                      Supporting racism   Representing your constituents    I bet your family is SO proud.
952340189778673669 2018-01-13 00:42:49 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PressSec Dear Sarah,  Trump must pay you a shit-load, perhaps shithole load to continuously defend him.  I hope you can sleep at night.  I would not do your job for any amount of money in the world.  Honesty and integrity, standing up against racism and bullying, mean too much to me.
952338735902941185 2018-01-13 00:37:02 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump You and Russia won, the American people lost.
951991602041540609 2018-01-12 01:37:39 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Perduesenate Shame on you Senator for lying to the American public and your constituents.  How long are you going to cover for Trump's racism?  His comments on Haiti and Africa are un-American and do not represent our values.  America is SO much better than that.
951957400625573888 2018-01-12 23:21:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @TopherSpiro @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung Please speak up, Hoosiers elected you to be our voice.
951956544379334663 2018-01-12 23:18:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for your honesty in regards to POTUS negative comments regarding Haiti and Africa.  His comments do not reflect American values.
951955480498368512 2018-01-12 23:14:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenatorCotton Shame on you for lying and standing behind @realDonaldTrump racist comments.  This is NOT the America you represent or the America so many of us love.  Racism and hatred have No place in America.
951952952348037121 2018-01-12 23:04:04 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @RepMiaLove Thank you for doing the right thing, millions of Americans applaud you for standing up for what true Americans believe.  POTUS must be held accountable and he must be held to a higher standard.  The USA is much better than that.
951925952468090881 2018-01-12 21:16:47 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @INCivilRights @SenDonnelly Senator, you need to denounce Trump's racist comments.  Remaining silent implies approval.  The Senate must reject his comments as racist and un-American.  This is NOT who we are as Hoosiers or Americans.  We ARE better than this.  America IS better than this.  Please Speak Up!
951899792594096128 2018-01-12 19:32:50 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenatorDurbin Thank you for speaking out, Senator. You have earned my respect and many others as well.  We need all Senators to speak up and hold Trump to a much higher standard.  POTUS is not representing American values and his racist comments make us all look bad. We are better than this.
951884860729282565 2018-01-12 18:33:30 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill How do you explain stupidity?
951884081729548288 2018-01-12 18:30:24 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly Please do not let POTUS racist comments go without denouncement.  Silence is akin to approval. This is NOT representative of the values of Hoosiers or Americans.  This bipartisan issue needs your support and voice. WE MUST HOLD HIM TO HIGHER STANDARDS!
951849310399991808 2018-01-12 16:12:14 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Yes please, Record everything that is said in any of your meetings.  UNBELIEVABLE that you deny your racist comments when heard and retold by so many others.  #LiarInChief!
951613890114342912 2018-01-11 00:36:46 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump  Your words are not representative of the USA.  How dare you represent us as racist elitists.  YOUR ancestors migrated here, ALL of our ancestors (even from 'shithole' countries) migrated here. GOOD people.  F-YOU, for misrepresenting the good people of the USA.
951256254961324032 2018-01-10 00:55:39 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly Please vote to fund Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)!  All children deserve medical care.  #FundCHIPNow
951161328558800901 2018-01-10 18:38:27 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @NBCNews Why don't you @realDonaldTrump start by setting an example and being 100% truthful?  Not your alternative truth, but real truth that can be proven and corroborated.  It is extremely hypocritical of you, of all people, to be calling on others to tell the truth. #LiarInChief
951111475321561089 2018-01-10 15:20:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @DonaldJTrumpJr As soon as N Korea & S Korea decided to meet, we ALL knew that @realDonaldTrump would try to take credit for it. Just like the lack of U.S. aviation deaths, your dad was responsible!  No surprise that the story comes from @FoxNews either, as no credible news org would air it.
950737513026654208 2018-01-09 14:34:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> BREAKING NEWS- @realDonaldTrump cancels daily meetings and is noticeably quiet on Twitter as he attends National Anthem training class after his embarrassing performance at last night's football game.
950726143858167809 2018-01-09 13:49:10 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CNN Hell yes, every President elect should have to pass a mental and physical test, Democrat or Republican.
950568835320614912 2018-01-08 03:24:05 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @KaivanShroff Yep, no clue.  @realDonaldTrump, seriously dude, you are beyond hope.  Step down, go build hotels, claim bankruptcy, dodge taxes and pay off people to suck up to you.  You do NOT need this busy 11-4 work schedule and we do NOT need an unqualified part time president.
950566236009660416 2018-01-08 03:13:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CNN Yo, @realDonaldTrump, you seriously need to shut up.  SHHH... Hide in the oval office, block your whole day as 'executive time' and watch TV.  Let's be honest, you will NOT be successful if you keep talking and tweeting.  SHHH...
950378997552177153 2018-01-08 14:49:44 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @dagenmcdowell A lot of negative comments here, would you all prefer it if they said or did nothing?  Right or wrong they are going to spend thousands on a gown anyway.  At least they did something, by calling attention to the problem on a global stage. And people are talking about the problem.
950375905343438855 2018-01-08 14:37:27 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @tomhanks @krassenstein All Hanks would need to do is channel an evil, unlikeable Forrest Gump.
950372495902892035 2018-01-08 14:23:54 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @krassenstein Nothing offensive about that.  I feel the exact same way.
950201484058222594 2018-01-07 03:04:22 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @nitalovesmiles That will be a great defense strategy for when @realDonaldTrump finally has to answer to the many sexual harassment claims against him.  'Sorry Judge, I didn't know what consensual meant, I thought it was consequential.'
950198771350167553 2018-01-07 02:53:35 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Yo, stable genius, shhhh, don't toot your own horn, or coerce some idiot like Miller to sing your praise.  Let your work speak for itself.  And no, Golf is not considered work.
950190423087157248 2018-01-07 02:20:25 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @kurteichenwald Sad, but true.
950190274340417536 2018-01-07 02:19:49 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @Kasparov63 True, limiting Trump is not a cure, but it does staunch the blood flow.  We need our elected politicians to represent the people NOT their party.  I for one, am super sick of Republican versus Democrat.  We are all on the same boat (so to speak).  We need to be stronger together.
950181100923621381 2018-01-07 01:43:22 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @New_Narrative 25th amendment, Russian collusion, obstruction of justice, abuse of power, sexual harassment, Dementia...  Something will bring this asshole down.  The sooner the better.  #ProtectMueller
950179467678437376 2018-01-07 01:36:53 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @newtgingrich Wrong Newt, it was Miller who was rude and obviously on a 'defend @realDonaldTrump by any means' mission.  Miller interrupted, said the same thing over and over and did not answer any question posed to him.  Tapper should have cut off Miller's Trump infomercial way before he did.
950144969595129856 2018-01-07 23:19:48 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Congratulations (in advance) to all news organizations and all reporters that win one of these highly sought after 'fake' awards.  If POTUS dislikes you, it means you are honest and doing a great job.
950142720332435459 2018-01-07 23:10:51 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot.  Everyone knows that you call any news that is less than favorable to you 'fake'.  Grow up and do your job, not this childish made-up awards show that people will just make fun of.
950069712381194240 2018-01-07 18:20:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CNNSotu @PreetBharara I am sure 'Trump Force One', was a Trump coined term.  What an ego @realDonaldTrump has...  And got to love Suckup Miller.  He sounded like a paid infomercial for the Trump campaign.
950068242827104256 2018-01-07 18:14:55 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenSanders Keep up the good work Senator.  The people appreciate your voice and support you.
950034833962668032 2018-01-07 16:02:09 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @jaketapper The only thing you could have done better was to cut that little weasel off earlier.
950025173004115968 2018-01-07 15:23:46 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump I would elect Jake Tapper for President over you, ANY day of the week.  With that said however, there are very few people who I wouldn't choose over you.  Miller was obviously coached to defend you at all costs. Tapper was right to cut him off. Complete waste of air time.
950017786016911360 2018-01-07 14:54:25 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Yep, you and Ronald have a lot in common.  He had Alzheimers/Dimensia too.
950016025717891072 2018-01-07 14:47:25 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill What's truly comical about the CIA Director's comment is that out of all of the explosive things about Trump that Wolff exposes, he chooses to defend that Trump really does read.
949724548580216832 2018-01-06 19:29:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> You are right @SenSanders, keep leading in the right direction.
949665685868892160 2018-01-06 15:35:18 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump #fireandfurybook #Bestsellers   The truth is out.
949661622599118855 2018-01-06 15:19:09 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill Congress is supposed to represent the people, not babysit or cover up for an unfit president.
949660869641883648 2018-01-06 15:16:09 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Ok, let me see if I got this right,  Mental Stability  Like, Really Smart  Very Successful Businessman  Big TV Star  Huge Hands  Great Hair  Trustworthy  Chick Magnet   Honest  Loyal to your wife and staff   Humble  I could go on and on
949358170824232960 2018-01-05 19:13:20 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump I hear you had something to do about it.  You threaten then try to distroy anyone who disagrees with you.  Once you were best buddies with Bannon, now you create as much distance as possible gathering allies against your perceived enemy.  THIS is NOT normal behavior.
949288874534227968 2018-01-05 14:37:59 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump That's right Donnie, deflect the negative attention towards Hillary and call everything else fake.  You are too predictable.  You think that if you say it a million times, people will believe it.  Well NO, we won't.
949287421702803456 2018-01-05 14:32:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @stevebenen Yo, @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Would you care to comment since this is something you boast about so often?
949285002168160257 2018-01-05 14:22:36 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump You are obviously scared to death of this book.  Very typical of your reaction to any coverage that is unfavorable.  Can't wait to read it myself.  Love to hear what your co-workers have to say about life in the White House, especially since 99% of them are Republicans.
949107366653583360 2018-01-04 02:36:44 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenGillibrand @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly If you or your family lived in Puerto Rico, could you live without power for 1 day? 1 week?  Puerto Rico deserves the same response I hope that Indiana would get in the event of a natural disaster.  DO THE RIGHT THING!
949106120953597953 2018-01-04 02:31:47 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump NOBODY wants your wall.  NOBODY wants to pay for your wall.  You promised over and over that Mexico would pay for the wall?  #LiarInChief
948769771327238148 2018-01-03 04:15:15 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @timkaine Senator Kaine, your plan is good, but please take it to the next level and gather the necessary support to shut Trump up. If he continues his childish taunting of 'Rocket Man', all other efforts will be in vain. Don't wait till its too late, the time is now.
948569975157116928 2018-01-03 15:01:20 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenBobCasey Thank you for speaking up Senator.
947314627934908416 2017-12-30 03:53:02 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @ThePlumLineGS Yo, @realDonaldTrump Great survey results, more to brag about on the golf course.  Great ratings!
947313435347423232 2017-12-30 03:48:17 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @POTUS @tedlieu #LiarInChief #dementia
947259885816819712 2017-12-30 00:15:30 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Yo @POTUS, why don't you brag about your true accomplishments?
947136728602693634 2017-12-30 16:06:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill No shit?
946954356112478209 2017-12-29 04:01:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump If your family lived in Puerto Rico would this be acceptable?  Could you live without power for 1 day?  1 week?  You should be ashamed, we should be ashamed.
946848694661468170 2017-12-29 21:01:35 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @JuddLegum Yo, @POTUS, care to comment?  Crooked Hillary and retired Obama spend less time golfing than you do.  Perhaps one of them can take over for you.  It would be a win/win, as you could golf all the time.
946840336839606272 2017-12-29 20:28:22 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump So, in your opinion it's okay for Russia to provide fuel to North Korea, but not China?  Why is that @POTUS?
946839586830999552 2017-12-29 20:25:23 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump What happened to your promise that Mexico would pay for the wall? The people do not want the wall, nor do they want to pay for the wall. Trying to blackmail people into supporting your stupid wall is ridiculous. Supporting the Dreamers is the right thing to do, they are innocent.
946512114025402368 2017-12-28 22:44:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @JamesVGrimaldi Who would want to work for him?  I sure as hell wouldn't.  If I did, I would be fired quick, because I would NOT kiss his ass like too many people have done his entire life.
946458263087968257 2017-12-28 19:10:08 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @WalshFreedom @AnalizeThis @steve_durnan Forgive me, by automatic I was referring to semi/auto or any firearm that will shoot repeatedly with a single trigger pull. The point is, we need to do something to prevent gun sales to anyone who is unstable. We CAN prevent some mass shootings.
946402138472804352 2017-12-28 15:27:07 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @WalshFreedom @AnalizeThis @steve_durnan Improve upon the background check.  Lengthen the waiting period.  Eliminate the sale of 'automatic' weapons. There has to be something that will help.  This is primarily a U.S. problem, why?
946202148282527744 2017-12-27 02:12:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump to most admired Americanhttp://flip.it/oMIAF9
945849247362174976 2017-12-26 02:50:08 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @nikkihaley Americans do NOT want you to threaten other countries or withhold funding based on different views. Every country should represent the beliefs of their citizens.  Please do NOT turn into a bully like @realDonaldTrump.  One asshole representing the US is enough.
944403919358320640 2017-12-22 03:06:55 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @KamalaHarris Can we NOT focus on Democrats or Republicans and just focus on getting good, honest people who want to serve the people and the best interests of America?  Winning is bipartisan.

944388927032582146 2017-12-22 02:07:20 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill Never thought I would agree with Bannon, but now I do.
944378288725745674 2017-12-22 01:25:04 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Thank you @SenMarkey for standing up for the average American and for what is right.  We appreciate you!
944377593041768449 2017-12-22 01:22:18 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Keep up the good work @SenSchumer.  We need more Senators like you to stand up for what is right.
944331571234041857 2017-12-22 22:19:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @jonfavs #Metoo @RandPaul  Move on to something/anything that currently matters.  Your Trump ass kissing tweets are irrelevant.  He won.  Thank the Russians.
944330371738554368 2017-12-22 22:14:40 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @perlmutations Kissing ass pays dividends in today's White House.  Very few have the balls to standup for what is right and best for Americans.  I would not coddle @realDonaldTrump for ALL the money in the world.
944328768755257346 2017-12-22 22:08:17 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenToddYoung, Indiana voters want you to support Dreamers!  It is the right thing to do.
944328310611464192 2017-12-22 22:06:28 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenDonnelly Indiana voters want you to support Dreamers.
944016002307756038 2017-12-21 01:25:28 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @chrislhayes Bull Shit.
944014662215127041 2017-12-21 01:20:09 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @newtgingrich @PressSec Bull Shit.  35% APPROVAL RATING.
943879454094450688 2017-12-21 16:22:52 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Grasping at straws.
943328347005816833 2017-12-19 03:52:58 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @PressSec Sarah, Tell the full story.  What will that same family pay in future years?  What kind of debt will their children inherit.  You tell only a small part of the story and ignore the elephant in the room.

943313321972953088 2017-12-19 02:53:16 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenateFloor @SenToddYoung Vote No, we can not promote business at the cost of individuals.
943184094397165568 2017-12-19 18:19:46 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenToddYoung Vote No on tax bill.  Do the right thing for the people, not the corporations.
943136217801089025 2017-12-19 15:09:31 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Interesting story regarding Trump administration completely ignoring public opinion.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42409634
942954487030927360 2017-12-18 03:07:23 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump That wasn't us speaking @POTUS, that was Russia.
941687493841379328 2017-12-15 15:12:48 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @thehill Who's going to left to pardon you @POTUS?
941684547757977602 2017-12-15 15:01:06 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @GenFlynn @FoxNews Who's going to be left to pardon you @POTUS?
941135339573440513 2017-12-13 02:38:45 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump But... You're fired.
940979013585113088 2017-12-13 16:17:34 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to learn that unity not division is what will help you "make America great again". It is NOT Republicans vs Democrats.  It is ALL Americans, with different backgrounds, politics and opinions, uniting in wanting and working for the best America possible.
940589445941747712 2017-12-12 14:29:33 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump #LiarInChief
940588640639639553 2017-12-12 14:26:21 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenGillibrand Thank you for standing up to @realDonaldTrump.  You have my respect and my support.
940587987766775808 2017-12-12 14:23:46 UTC <_lynnwolf_> What is wrong with you @realDonaldTrump that makes you lash out at anyone with a different opinion?  This is a democracy.  Our differences are our strength.  Show every Senator respect.  Listen to them, learn from them.  I am so sick of you dividing this great country.
940246025771593729 2017-12-11 15:44:56 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @nytimes Did you watch a few of your sexual misconduct accusers on Meghan Kelly this morning @realDonaldTrump?  It was truly #mustseetv.
938454060797186048 2017-12-06 17:04:18 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump The Time cover went to the women that you harrass @POTUS.  And rightly so. Quit spewing campaign slogans and get to work.  Mueller will be working on making America great again, and honest again, and trustworthy again...
938047221068718080 2017-12-05 14:07:40 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Thank you @MittRomney for your honesty and integrity.  We need more like you in both parties.
937685723737706496 2017-12-04 14:11:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> A vote for @MooreSenate is a vote condoning sexual abuse.  Alabama voters, please do NOT let Roy Moore get away with abusing women and children.  If you have a mother, sister or daughter that you love, please get out and vote #NOMOORE!
937681921001353219 2017-12-04 13:56:05 UTC <_lynnwolf_> A vote for Moore is a vote promoting sexual abuse, plain and simple.  Alabama, do NOT let Roy Moore get away with abusing innocent women and children.  Shame on you @realDonaldTrump, you would sell out to the devil if he would vote your way.
936761885726314501 2017-12-01 01:00:12 UTC <_lynnwolf_> America has always been respected @realDonaldTrump, you are NOT.
934949404032880640 2017-11-26 00:58:03 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Just because you say it over and over again, does not make it true.  You can NOT take credit for everything that goes well in the US, and blame others for everything that goes wrong.  Your ego is unmatched and wholely undeserved.
934809053510930433 2017-11-26 15:40:20 UTC <_lynnwolf_> No, @realDonaldTrump, the last thing we need is for the POTUS to support a child molester.
934586610917826561 2017-11-25 00:56:26 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Wish @FoxNews wasn't your lap dog.   I believe @CNN any day of the week.
934585951350910976 2017-11-25 00:53:49 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @FoxNews #LiarInChief @realDonaldTrump  Congrats on the Time Person of the Year!
933131038104092673 2017-11-21 00:32:30 UTC <_lynnwolf_> Wow, finally @realDonaldTrump actually does something to brag about.  Good job buddy!  Well deserved pat on the back.  :)
932395042274148352 2017-11-19 23:47:55 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Jeff Flake is more presidential than you, ANY day of the week.  Why do you have to bully and demean others to feel good about yourself.  Grow a pair...
930992462021177345 2017-11-15 02:54:34 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump Why must you always cast blame?  Grow up.  It is Not Republicans VS. Democrats, it is everyone working for the best interest of the US And the world.
930991716546633728 2017-11-15 02:51:36 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @CNN @realDonaldTrump YOU are the Loser.  If you spent 1/2 as much time working for the US, as you do complaining about the media or Hillary, you might be able to accomplish something worthy of your constant bragging.  To date... Nothing to brag about.
922987137670238208 2017-10-24 00:44:16 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump If you want to be the most popular president ever, with the best ratings ever, the biggest standing ovation ever...Resign.

917565151787798528 2017-10-09 01:39:14 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @SenBobCorker Bless you for having the balls to standup to a bully and speak the truth.  Other Senators should take your lead and represent the people.
835961040433205250 2017-02-26 21:13:38 UTC <_lynnwolf_> @realDonaldTrump You call any news that is unfavorable to you, "fake news".  GROW UP!
