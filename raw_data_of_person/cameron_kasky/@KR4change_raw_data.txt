971518804973969408 2018-03-07 22:51:47 UTC <KR4change> @thehill Well, good to know how the "conservatives" are spending our tax dollars! #firstclass
971506740578496512 2018-03-07 22:03:51 UTC <KR4change> @AgCI3Cu2 The students see through our elected and appointed GOP officials. They know you guys are paid off by corporate interests, like the NRA. Gives me hope that they will be of voting age and will get y'all out soon.
970788132932149253 2018-03-05 22:28:21 UTC <KR4change> @Refinery29 And here's another even more frightening example of Anti-Semitism from progressives.

970787090303610881 2018-03-05 22:24:13 UTC <KR4change> And just in case you weren't paying attention, the rise of anti-Semitism is real, and no world leaders seem to be calling it out.

970786782932492288 2018-03-05 22:23:00 UTC <KR4change> I've been in a depressive slump watching all of this awful news about corruption in the Trump administration while Congress does nothing, but the Parkland students have given me renewed hope. #GunControlNow #MarchForOurLives

957035546991255552 2018-01-26 23:40:29 UTC <KR4change> Finally, that gross feeling that our election was stolen is proving to be true...more news about Trump's obstruction to the Russia investigation this week.
957002201968209920 2018-01-26 21:27:59 UTC <KR4change> @NARAL This is heartbreaking.

956738845495607296 2018-01-25 04:01:30 UTC <KR4change> Maybe this seems obvious but when you are voting, remember not every candidate is in the race for the right reasons. GOP is trying to fleece the country right now. Read between the lines.
956317551365009408 2018-01-24 00:07:26 UTC <KR4change> @kylegriffin1 A sad day. She will be missed.

956265711004864512 2018-01-24 20:41:26 UTC <KR4change> I think the Trump administration is trying to take down California. Why else place tariffs on solar? Why else pass a "tax reform" bill that places the most expense and burden on the residents of CA?
956264707702181888 2018-01-24 20:37:27 UTC <KR4change> Truth eventually comes out.

950855427599863808 2018-01-09 22:22:54 UTC <KR4change> I called mine - they are ON BOARD!! Hooray CA. Are Senate Democrats prepared to stand up for DREAMers? We contacted all of them to find out. https://thinkprogress.org/senate-democrats-daca-spending-bill-842d7f4bc14b/ via @thinkprogress

942191961619832832 2017-12-16 00:37:23 UTC <KR4change> @AP Poor Santa Barbara. Just getting worse.
942191729800658944 2017-12-16 00:36:28 UTC <KR4change> So the GOP bought off @marcorubio and @SenBobCorker to push through this immoral tax bill. Really guys? You would betray the American people - the poorest among us - for a little extra cash?
941473380762390529 2017-12-14 01:02:00 UTC <KR4change> @CAL_FIRE @VCscanner So tragic. Our thoughts are with all of the firefighters who are (and have been) working around the clock.
941444045003296768 2017-12-14 23:05:26 UTC <KR4change> Thank you 18 states for standing up for #NetNeutralityhttps://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/new-york-attorney-general-announces-a-multi-state-lawsuit-challenging-the-net-neutrality-vote/
941412537823723521 2017-12-14 21:00:14 UTC <KR4change> Our democracy is eroding. Net neutrality: gone. Climate Scientists: relocating to France. Tax scam: corporations win and middle class loses. Free press: it is "fake news." Mueller investigation: thwarted. If you care, #resist

941039311373287424 2017-12-13 20:17:10 UTC <KR4change> @Jim_Jordan @cspan Wow. The GOP is conducting a witch hunt. They are really pissed about Alabama. Please note GOP---the PEOPLE will choose where the country is headed, not you.
940983136451674112 2017-12-13 16:33:57 UTC <KR4change> Thank you Alabama!! Now we must fight to save Net Neutrality!
940704830422519808 2017-12-12 22:08:03 UTC <KR4change> So which takes down POTUS first - sexual harassment charges or FBI investigation? He is trying to silence both - pay attention to how he is building momentum to discredit people fighting him on both fronts. He knows he could be ousted.
940360554866122753 2017-12-11 23:20:01 UTC <KR4change> I can't believe where we are today vs. where we were 2 years ago. Alabama is voting on a pedophile for Senate and our POTUS has been accused by MULTIPLE women of sexual harassment. None of this would be happening under Obama.
938875413845090304 2017-12-07 20:58:36 UTC <KR4change> @CNN Whatever. @SpeakerRyan needs to call for the resignation of congressional sexual harassers in his own party. Coward.
938871452446552064 2017-12-07 20:42:52 UTC <KR4change> @Amy_Siskind I just called my senators about this! #higherstandards
938555276155744256 2017-12-06 23:46:30 UTC <KR4change> The past couple of weeks have left us reeling. Fires, Trump stirring up problems in Middle East, Net Neutrality, Bears Ears, Roy Moore, Trump calling for a voter database... and let's not forget the GOP tax scam. America, who are you??
938551414527332352 2017-12-06 23:31:09 UTC <KR4change> This is scary. Trump's voter fraud commission plans to create a massive voter database. Former national security officials say it could be hacked.http://wapo.st/2BCRI8j?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.bb496476615f

936353410462318592 2017-11-30 21:57:04 UTC <KR4change> The war on the media is the most frightening development in our country. Americans, open your eyes. The media is here to SERVE you, INFORM you of problems, corruption, etc. Don't just listen to the President. Fact check!!!
936349918616104960 2017-11-30 21:43:11 UTC <KR4change> If you're happy the market is doing well right now, take a good look around - the country will look very different in a year when more people slide into poverty thanks to the GOP "tax cut" bill.
936349381950767105 2017-11-30 21:41:03 UTC <KR4change> I'm not sure what to do with the onslaught of worrying news this week. I feel like our country is being hijacked. What can we do?? I've called, protested, made donations...feeling powerless.
935691534166405120 2017-11-28 02:07:00 UTC <KR4change> Please call your Congress member to OPPOSE the "Conceal Carry Reciprocity" bill, which allows people to carry guns across state lines and ignore the laws for weapons where they visit. NRA is behind it.
935275900643315712 2017-11-27 22:35:25 UTC <KR4change> Let's not get distracted. America can't be a democracy without a free, thriving press. Republican or Democrat, this is crucial. When the powers that be start discrediting news agencies, we should all be frightened. Journalists put their lives on the line to bring us truth.
933498861410123776 2017-11-22 00:54:06 UTC <KR4change> Joe Barton had to clarify his lewd photo was sent to an "adult woman." This is what our political environment has come down to in the age of Trump. Dick pics and pedophilia. SMH
933123971708416000 2017-11-21 00:04:26 UTC <KR4change> @TPM @RVAwonk He makes me sick. I can't believe Roy Moore gets even another second of consideration for a Senate seat. He's a victim-blaming sociopath.
933123724596854784 2017-11-21 00:03:27 UTC <KR4change> Trump believes Roy Moore, not his victims. Horrifying. This is why we don't need a predator in The White House. #ElectWomen
933121907444015104 2017-11-21 23:56:13 UTC <KR4change> I'm thoroughly sickened by Roy Moore and his terrible takedown of his victims. He's a coward. When you are a feral animal trapped in a cage, you destroy everything around you. History will not treat him kindly.
931274433326542848 2017-11-16 21:35:01 UTC <KR4change> GOP ideologies: Trophy hunting OK, education cuts OK, taking money from workers to give to corporations OK, sexual assault OK, and shaking hands with leaders who commit human rights abuses OK. Who thinks this is good leadership???
930951708343074816 2017-11-15 00:12:38 UTC <KR4change> @thehill The GOP Tax cut plan does NOT equal more jobs. Workers lose.

930884397003190272 2017-11-15 19:45:09 UTC <KR4change> I mean, the GOP is relentless. No matter how many people protest, how unpopular, they still try to gut our healthcare. Now it's through their "tax plan." Don't fall for it---NO on the GOP tax plan!!!
930557875172151296 2017-11-14 22:07:41 UTC <KR4change> Yet another shooting, this time near an elementary school in Northern CA. When is enough going to be enough?? We need some serious gun reform legislation. NOW.

926203044966014976 2017-11-02 21:43:08 UTC <KR4change> Facebook ads, Russia collusion with Trump team, Voter suppression. This isn't democracy. We need another election.
926199615317094400 2017-11-02 21:29:30 UTC <KR4change> I would LOVE to get through a news day without the mention of Hillary Clinton. She lost. Can we let it go already and focus on the present?
