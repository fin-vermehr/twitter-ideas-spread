945052019425005568 2017-12-24 22:02:14 UTC <crightonjohin> @wpjenna Trump is redistributing $1.5 trillion to the wealthy on the backs of everyone else, is spouting racist bullshit almost daily and is at war with the FBI, CIA, etc. but please continue to write terrible articles like this because the stupid fucks who voted for him are important.

941785481465008130 2017-12-15 21:42:10 UTC <crightonjohin> @SenBobCorker This bill is not imperfect, it is pure garbage for the majority of Americans and it only serves rich twatwaffles like yourself.  You should be ashamed of yourself.

941394466149228545 2017-12-14 19:48:25 UTC <crightonjohin> @FCC @tombellino @voidlogic @stan_spencer422 So basically you're hoping that you get a little discount because you only do FB and Twitter (which is sad in itself,) and those of us who actually use a much broader version of the internet get screwed? You're not seeing the big picture, pal. Its naive and pretty fucking stupid.
941393538276823051 2017-12-14 19:44:44 UTC <crightonjohin> @FCC Oh, look!  The corporate whores that have taken over the FCC are lying their asses off...again.  How much is Verizon and the rest paying you, Ajit?  Enough to sell us all down the river, I guess.

940695697447366656 2017-12-12 21:31:46 UTC <crightonjohin> @AP_Politics It's not accusing when you actually did it. It's not like his Twitter isn't a public record.  Why do you idiots do stuff like this? You're doing everything in your power to normalize his behavior and that's what got him elected. For fuck's sake, grow some courage and do your job.
940692846012698624 2017-12-12 21:20:26 UTC <crightonjohin> @AlexPappas Or maybe if Jones were pro-hiton14yroldgirls he might get those pesky and moral Republicans to vote for him.  Or maybe if he were a racist twatwaffle like Moore...or anti-gay.  Maybe the GOP should stop being fucking terrible, instead?
939596526078386176 2017-12-09 20:44:03 UTC <crightonjohin> @realDonaldTrump @larryelder Trump has been racist for decades.  This is not news.  It is also the reason why his appearance is being protested.  If he didn't go he would just confirm what blacks already know..he's a racist.

You realize that Nazi's were guilty of mass murder and part of their "platform" is ethnic cleansing, which includes getting rid of Jews, gays, all non-white people?

938525952023330818 2017-12-06 21:49:58 UTC <crightonjohin> @lisamurkowski But you're okay with Trump remaining President and Roy Moore becoming a Senator?  Is that correct?

I know you southerners get sad when you're called racist, but the solution is not crying about it, but to not be racist any longer.
936308611101446144 2017-11-30 18:59:03 UTC <crightonjohin> @SenJohnMcCain Not surprising.  You're much more likely to vote against the majority of Americans and side with your rich overlords.  You're really okay with transferring trillions from us to them?  Devastating our health care?  Really?  You're no hero, you're a coward.
