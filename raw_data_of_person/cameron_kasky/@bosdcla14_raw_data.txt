971859546762133504 2018-03-08 21:25:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @SarahFloresDOJ Nullification is saying federal laws don't apply in a state---for example, Idaho saying that the PPACA doesn't apply there (which is somehow OK with the Trump crowd).    California's simply saying that the feds can enforce federal law here but our cops have other stuff to do.

966779317035319296 2018-02-22 20:58:45 UTC <bosdcla14> After 9/11 in DC, there was a period of time where there were armed national guardsmen on many street corners and humvees with mounted guns at certain underpasses.

My point is that saying "burning calories causes weight loss, if you don't want to lose weight, burn fewer calories" is incomplete as you need to burn some. (I suppose you could choose not to live, but then you would lose weight anyway as...well, no need to be morbid)
961777394699784197 2018-02-08 01:42:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @RandPaul @HubFlyer @j_c_fitz @2_and_2_make_5 Spending causes deficits in the same way burning calories causes weight loss.  If you were short of food, you could become more sedentary to save calories.  But if you take in zero calories, you will lose weight no matter what, because you have to burn some calories to live.
961771745601400832 2018-02-08 01:20:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @RandPaul @HubFlyer @j_c_fitz @2_and_2_make_5 You stated "Tell me how less revenue adds to debt."  If reducing revenue never adds to debt, then you can reduce revenue to $0.  If you do not cut spending to $0, how can that be true?  If there is a "breaking point" where revenue reductions do add to debt, where is that point?
961770141905113088 2018-02-08 01:14:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @RandPaul @HubFlyer @j_c_fitz @2_and_2_make_5 I don't think every buck the feds spend is essential.  However, I do believe that dropping federal revenue to $0 would necessarily cause the deficit to rise, because some dollars spent are essential.  How could federal spending be cut to $0 without affecting anything essential?

But as one example, I think the Sox offering JD Martinez 5-125 is fair, not underhanded, for a power-hitting 30-year-old who as a defender is below average.  I think we're seeing the end of Boras' ability to sway teams into bad deals for them with advanced stats.

Meanwhile, Horford and Tatum were at 50% or above, and both were in single digits on shots tonight.  And tonight, he slipped to 2 assists with 6 TOs.  Enough.  Run the offense, create for others, no more crappy ISO.
953463832520704000 2018-01-16 03:07:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @AnnaHorford Nah we had to put it in the hands of the guy who was a scorching 8-23 on the night and hasn't shot above 37.5% in 2018.
953462368746352641 2018-01-16 03:01:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @dangercart True, only 5 last game.
953460363525218304 2018-01-16 02:53:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @dangercart Kyrie 2018: 5/14, 6/16, 8/22, 7/20, 7/20.  So really, an average 2018 night.

Tell you what, if he's so safe host him in your mom's home until his competition.
947649725888479232 2017-12-31 02:04:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @ArtAcevedo @JustJacquenette @nathanM4A1 He was so drunk that, while armed, he fought security guards and cops.  Per the NRA: "Never use alcohol, over-the-counter drugs or prescription drugs before or while shooting."  You acting smug about guns while not knowing you don't handle them while hammered is some weak shit.

943552387783860224 2017-12-20 18:43:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @TODAYshow @SpeakerRyan @AlexNBCNews The "average" (mean) of this cut is misleading since its provisions are designed to advantage the wealthy the most.  The median tax cut is far lower, and then the bill boomerangs in 2027 as those cuts fall away, AND the bill adds around 1.5 trillion to the debt by that time.
943538868300627970 2017-12-20 17:49:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @RepJudyChu Everyone should just pretend it has been repealed.  Whenever it comes up, tell Trump "you repealed Obamacare, anyone who says otherwise is fake news" so he can go back to golf.

943240255192186880 2017-12-19 22:02:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq "Ball Four" has a story about Mantle: Mantle was raffling off a Christmas ham, all the players chipped in & Bouton won.  Mantle tells Bouton "there is no ham" and says "that's the risk you run w/ games of chance."  So, in that way, the Paul Ryan comparison is right on the money.
943215585717972994 2017-12-19 20:24:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan @edatpost Weird, he claimed he wanted to simplify the tax code and this doesn't do that at all- still 7 brackets.  Apparently, you knew the simplification claim was false, but you chose never to report it and now cheerlead him for lying successfully.  Not great, Ed.

California is already a net contributor to the US treasury, one of only 14 states where that's true.  The deficit's going to rise by 1.9 trillion over 10 years while CA pays MORE in taxes for that.

Even if you disregard Tweeden & the accuser that alleged a waist grab, there are 6 women who said he grabbed their breasts, buttocks, or forced an open-mouthed kiss on them.

As for your hypothetical, I'd imagine that yes, an industry getting its dick sucked by Congress is enjoying the BJ.  We've had over 80 months of consecutive job growth, no need to cut taxes
936730653416026112 2017-12-01 22:56:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @lhfang @Scott_SoCal I understand tax types, I just object to corruption that you think is fine.  As you admitted, under the current rules, the beer industry is doing very well as a whole due to craft beer growth.  They don't need a lobbyist-obtained tax cut paid for w/deficits & draining California.
936720053814177792 2017-12-01 22:13:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @lhfang @Scott_SoCal If Mark Zuckerberg got Repubs to exempt all social media companies from taxes in exchange for a benefit from him, that'd be corruption, even if it benefited Twitter as well.  And "these companies are having massive success; they desperately need tax breaks" is a wild take, kudos.
936715494446395392 2017-12-01 21:55:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @lhfang @Scott_SoCal Right, because that doesn't matter at all.  A son-in-law got his Senator father-in-law to give the company he lobbies for a tax loophole and paying for it thru deficits and by sticking it to California, which was already one of only 14 net contributor states.

890410466903597057 2017-07-26 03:16:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @Scaramucci @PaulaReidCBS @jsatz23 The statement adopts the strategy of "true but unrelated."  Instead of weighing in on if this is a crime, it just generally decries crime.

890305217857585152 2017-07-26 20:17:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME Not clear. SHS implied we may go back to pre-DADT, where military did active investigations re if a soldier was secretly LGBT.

888586546344898561 2017-07-21 02:28:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZaidJilani It wasn't just about cheap labor.  It was also about a social structure that had strong support from poor whites bc they were above someone.
888586157776265216 2017-07-21 02:27:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZaidJilani Though sometimes there are forces that override.  Nazis, for example, slaughtered their cheap labor.  This is why I doubt slavery abolition.

883751678767280132 2017-07-08 18:16:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @wojespn @IanBegley @BostonKnick I think Noah. Lopez is only 1 year and can still score.  Noah is more expensive than Mozgov and more injury prone w/ same # of years left.
883748962766692352 2017-07-08 18:05:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @wojespn @IanBegley @BostonKnick Noah's contract is probably the worst in the NBA. Look at what the Lakers had to do to get rid of Mozgov.

881021562807238657 2017-06-30 05:28:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @teamziller @nekko377 Not stupid. Simply prioritized getting PG out of East to non-Laker West team over sheer "most assets" return.
881018737272406016 2017-06-30 05:16:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @daldridgetnt @kevinleekkc So you'd take a worse offer out of spite?  It's like selling a  for 5k instead of 10k b/c the offer is a higher % of the 1st guy's income.
880996933648515072 2017-06-30 03:50:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @CelticsLife True, though getting the hell out of the West has to look even more attractive now.
880995890189680641 2017-06-30 03:46:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn @MPfourthree43 Dunn was bad last year.  LaVine was so bad the Wolves did better without him, and you don't even know how to spell his name.

880992041869623301 2017-06-30 03:30:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub It almost works as a straight cap-clearing move.  If PG comes in and gives OKC basically nothing, he's an expiring contract/trade chip.
880991765943132164 2017-06-30 03:29:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn Also, flip it around: compare what Ainge got for Rondo vs. what the Bulls got for Butler, Sacto got for DMC, and Pacers got for PG.

880147280673685504 2017-06-28 19:33:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @voxdotcom @BuckInTennessee Of course. This estimate is with the PPACA as a baseline. Single payer would have fewer deaths and higher taxes than either PPACA or AHCA.

873345199900053504 2017-06-09 01:04:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @ColumbiaBugle That's fine.  Heck, investigate Hillary for the 1871 Great Chicago Fire if you'd like.  As long as there's a real Russia investigation.
873338472349573122 2017-06-09 00:38:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @Soxlunch Also we should be getting killed.  Johnson 7 hits, 3 walks, and 2 homers in 4 innings and only 3 runs?  Feels like one we could steal.

861363885105856514 2017-05-07 23:35:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck Jerebko was effective. Grabbed 1 of C's 2 total offensive rebounds that led to an Isaiah three.

858178856397623296 2017-04-28 04:39:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub @ChasingBanner18 @levelsoundz I'd originally intended it to be a fairly mild factual correction of an understable error, since Horford has long had a rep as a good passer

858176524549210112 2017-04-28 04:30:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @haralabob Well it seems like the refs are letting Pierce get away with more than they do with the rest of the players in this game.

858173714751340544 2017-04-28 04:18:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub @levelsoundz I thought you were saying he didn't more than double his career production in any category.

858172548667760640 2017-04-28 04:14:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub @levelsoundz He has a career average of 3 assists a game. He more than doubled that in this series.
858171519968485376 2017-04-28 04:10:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @nytimes @marclacey Why does the NYT require multiple reps of the fading Cheneyist movement (Brooks&Bret)?  Where's the Sanders socialist?  Or neo-fascist?

857042115586531330 2017-04-25 01:22:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @RawStory @grierhiggins @MrsSmh1 He means that Obama's team vetted him and fired him.  Trump's team then re-hired and promoted him.

854511669455630336 2017-04-18 01:47:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie This is basically saying Brad should be fired for losing one series they should have won. They were worse than their opponents in '16 & '15.

853778302795882496 2017-04-16 01:13:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillSimmons @JKemp1997 Olynck or Johnson? Or Jerebko?  Jordan Mickey?

853776585039560704 2017-04-16 01:06:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillSimmons @JKemp1997 The problem is the guy leading the team in rebounds and assists and shooting over 50% on 19 points?
853770737017958400 2017-04-16 00:43:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @617_Masshole He's leading the team in rebounds and assists, has 17 points and is shooting over 50% but other than that what's he doing right?
853761898973495297 2017-04-16 00:07:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Could do with some Jerebko if Amir and Kelly are allergic to rebounds
853756419073388544 2017-04-16 23:46:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck Letting someone smaller than you grab a rebound puts you in a good position to get a block.
853756106266390528 2017-04-16 23:44:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillKristol Cool. Bush liked Putin. I assume this is the thread where we're tweeting remarks from former Presidents about leaders that look bad now?

850447157513469952 2017-04-07 20:36:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @JimInhofe You are extremely unprincipled and your statement is absurd.
850375341814169600 2017-04-07 15:50:55 UTC <bosdcla14> Oh Trump misled you?  How bow dah?https://twitter.com/reaganbattalion/status/850338108424015872

850175047599742976 2017-04-06 02:35:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @Marc_DAmico If he could pick up his 6th foul that might actually help the Cs have a chance in this game.
848619155347587072 2017-04-02 19:32:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck We should just total the point differential and rank teams that way.
848419580645068800 2017-04-01 06:19:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbogg To attend, do you have to either actively courted Trump (Gabbard), said he's grown as President (Jones) or shrugged at damage (Sarandon)?
847673780247740416 2017-03-30 04:55:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @IndivisibleTeam @DrainThatSwamp Right, no one said it was directed to the committee...his lawyer put it out as an open letter...you OK?
847651795178463234 2017-03-30 03:28:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @MRidenourABJ Journey of thousand miles starts with single step.  Of course, Kyrie thinks if you walk 1000 miles you fall off the edge of the Earth.
847286472868741121 2017-03-29 03:16:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @KenSofer China could actually make him do it.  Threaten to pull his trademark and demand payment on Kushner's debt.

846099114496425985 2017-03-26 20:38:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @OldTakesExposed I guess @BFriedACC can't take the coldness of his own takes.
845491279446261761 2017-03-24 04:23:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @tysonchandler As I C's fan, I enjoyed it.  It was special.  That called-off 3 pointer reminded me of Bird's called-off 3 against the Hawks.

845465710344122368 2017-03-24 02:41:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @FoxNews @Lovablejerk07 I agree with the first part.  DJT playing in the truck while the bill skidded off the rails was fucking delicious.

845462318729256960 2017-03-24 02:28:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByJayKing This whole thing feels Belichickian---the Celtics won but Stevens is pissed and the C's believe he's right to be pissed.
844592286738530304 2017-03-22 16:51:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @Reuters @sutker Clinton's not President, but if that's what you need in order to care about your country, I hope they get those as well.

844019521325211648 2017-03-20 02:55:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @MschRn @keithellison @SellatiGiacomo The Reuters story has multiple sources, though I certainly get the desire to discredit such a story.

842920496756805632 2017-03-17 02:08:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @justinhendrix @sa3371 So odd, since saying "only blacks are racist" is a statement that whites are superior to blacks, ie, is racist.

842414346827251712 2017-03-16 16:36:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @Frank_Rizzos By that standard, so is Trump.  Guy constantly mentioned wikileaks during the campaign.  Interesting take, good chat.
842414038390718465 2017-03-16 16:35:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @Frank_Rizzos I understand the claim.  But the fact that he lied only came out after the stories about him. No stories, that's undiscovered.
842413120471552000 2017-03-16 16:31:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @Frank_Rizzos Why doesn't Flynn count?  Got so bad Trump asked him to resign. Unless you're saying that request was done for no good reason?

838526067895783424 2017-03-05 23:06:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh You need to reach all the way down to college students you presume are Democrats to find someone whose behavior is as bad as 45

838502269402296320 2017-03-05 21:31:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP @VP Wikileaks published private email addresses and phone numbers of random staffers, and you cheered them on.

837882329838182400 2017-03-03 04:28:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I get the Lakers announcers tonight.  They just explained that was a "frustration technical" on Nick Young.  Cogent analysis.
837881660473409537 2017-03-03 04:25:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I could do with a few fewer trips where we miss both FTs.
837840973338038272 2017-03-03 01:43:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @WSJ @DRUDGE_REPORT @sass0412 I suspect they'll buy a trivial amount of US steel & use it.  Promise was "use US steel" not "use only".
837840252291043328 2017-03-03 01:40:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @WSJ @DRUDGE_REPORT @seanmur30640484 Article is probably directed at ppl who take Trump's words at face value, not those who don't do that.
837840066940588033 2017-03-03 01:40:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @WSJ @DRUDGE_REPORT @sass0412 Where do you see that?  Article says the "steel has already been acquired" ie, they don't need any more.
837839695107141633 2017-03-03 01:38:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @VP @realDonaldTrump @WSJ @DRUDGE_REPORT Its an easy workaround.  Buy 1 ounce of US steel and use it.  Never said all, right?
837817609571618816 2017-03-03 00:10:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill That's a NI, negative impact. There's no filibuster on Cabinet appointments.  You're welcome.

837525681135206403 2017-03-02 04:50:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @DevinNunes You know we all can watch the video, right?  "Stop asking questions unless you want to be investigated" implication is v. clear.
837524100473995264 2017-03-02 04:44:40 UTC <bosdcla14> As for you, @RickLangel, if you didn't know Obama was issuing EOs at a historically low rate, then the media you're consuming misled you
837522522128048129 2017-03-02 04:38:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @commiegirl1 @RickLangel @dustizzl Yes.  Also the idea that its a recent explosion is false.  Coolidge did 1200+ compared to Obama's 276.
837521326856249345 2017-03-02 04:33:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @commiegirl1 @RickLangel @dustizzl Any 2 term President (GHWB lower), though Obama also issued fewer EOs than Nixon or Carter.

837505764973412352 2017-03-02 03:31:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker You can @ him.  Hey @newtgingrich, Sessions' spokesperson confirmed these meetings, you nitwit.
837501560196218880 2017-03-02 03:15:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @reidepstein @goodwillfiction Jeff Sessions is having the type of day African-Americans have if they come into contact with Jeff Sessions.
837501237096407041 2017-03-02 03:13:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @WSJ @reidepstein @SarahClapp @AndrewWeber87 Its too much.  I'm really wishing the Pence email story hit a couple days ago or tomorrow.
837500086938558464 2017-03-02 03:09:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenWarren @JustinIovanne77 OK.  I think its more important to stop those in power from implementing a far-right agenda but thx 4 answering
837498740294352896 2017-03-02 03:03:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @KathieR65 First time I think I've ever seen anyone openly object to working hard at a good paying job.  Twitter has it all.
837498516083658752 2017-03-02 03:03:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @TrumpStrong45 Why would Russia go to war with the US just because liberals criticized Trump?  After all, he doesn't have any ties, right? 
837495963505709056 2017-03-02 02:52:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @FoxNews That's his DENIAL?  That his campaign discussions with the Russians weren't constant?  Yeah, nobody's saying it was 24-7-365.
837495596055289857 2017-03-02 02:51:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @FoxNews @JoanneMulvaney1 Why'd Sessions lie under oath about this stuff?

837160158916595712 2017-03-01 04:38:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @FreedomUSA4 Lynch never lied about meeting (like JS did) but recused herself anyway. Should Sessions be forced to recuse himself as well?

836719990183120896 2017-02-28 23:29:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @FreeBeacon So people who wanted to express their views to govt officials went to townhalls to do so?  Wow, shocking.
836700253772361728 2017-02-28 22:11:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefix You wrote about Kerry putting Swiss cheese on a cheesesteak as a major story.  Cartoonishly absurd double standard by you.
836692027177738240 2017-02-28 21:38:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenSasse Cool choice of the word "die" when you're talking about letting people dump crap into America's waters.
836665955056926720 2017-02-28 19:54:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrisgeidner @neontaster You should be saying that to Trump.  Its Jewish institutions that are under attack.  Posturing otherwise is false.

836472764319989760 2017-02-27 07:07:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo Its more like "this is OK tasting.  The alternative is anthrax" and people respond, "THERE'S BASICALLY NO DIFFERENCE!!!"

836411780469403648 2017-02-27 03:04:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @nycsouthpaw @Inadvertantview I can understand why you think this is so bad that it must be a fake attempt to discredit Conway.  Yikes.
836409675482423296 2017-02-27 02:56:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @AnnaHorford @Ernestwill24 Definitely.  You don't care about the Super Bowl, while wearing the Super Bowl shirt.  Admirably brave face sir.
836409334217113600 2017-02-27 02:54:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Signing a huge free agent was valuable in its own right, since that had never happened before for the C's.

836085770234388481 2017-02-26 05:29:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @jordancornette @OldTakesExposed I'd disqualify this.  They announced the "winner." Not a cold take.  Not sure why I care but I do.
836085299247665153 2017-02-26 05:27:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @pauldriscoll I thought Kimmel did a nice job, but second screen makes it more fun.  But people mad are crazy.  This is great!  Good stuff.

835917365204267009 2017-02-26 18:20:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @ShaunKing @stevengberman Obama approved the idea of planning the raid.  Trump ordered the raid carried out.  Fairly obvious distinction.

835600165855600640 2017-02-25 21:19:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn @DanielFuglestad If we're counting close losses, I'd suggest Paul Hackett back in 2005.
835599090348011521 2017-02-25 21:15:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @DanielFuglestad @Nate_Cohn Arguably, it might be Sanders himself.  VT is largely white, I'm sure a number of VT residents are working class
835595090726813696 2017-02-25 20:59:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn @DanielFuglestad Does Perriello's serving one term in an R +5 after winning in a Dem wave count as excelling?
835591775003656192 2017-02-25 20:46:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @commiegirl1 And Ellison is Vice-Chair.  That can be seen as avoiding a repeat of a (possible) Hillary mistake in not naming Sanders Veep.
835589521072771074 2017-02-25 20:37:20 UTC <bosdcla14> This is the right call.  I'd also note that this outcome keeps Ellison in the House of Representatives.https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/835586791981867008
835348102290653186 2017-02-24 04:38:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @HPbasketball You'd think, but you'd also think that he'd have tried to get him at the deadline.  Or Noel.  Or Tucker.  Seriously.
835341094929911809 2017-02-24 04:10:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByJayKing "Dozing Danny" can be Ainge's new nickname.
835332942704472065 2017-02-24 03:37:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie "Everyone watch IT" is probably not a great strategy against a good team that knows its coming and game-planned for it.
835322316863090688 2017-02-24 02:55:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @JesseGladsaget He has put up a 17-6 or better in 5 consecutive games before tonight.
835320472656990212 2017-02-24 02:48:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByJayKing Followed up by a TO and a defensive sequence where no one made an effort to rebound except Smart.
835317412090146816 2017-02-24 02:36:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Its too bad there were no big men available for low prices at the trade deadline. 
835300569552035840 2017-02-24 01:29:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce @jbpieterse Also is it for the money or due to beliefs?
834967562907594752 2017-02-23 03:25:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @JosephKellyJr @Jared_Carrabis Not retweeting your producer's earlier tweet of this is pretty savage. @Steve_Perrault gets no respect.

834605000101814272 2017-02-22 03:25:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @ProPublica DeVos had the power to stop this, and chose not to.  Your interpretation of these events is insanely generous toward her.
833865920141352960 2017-02-20 02:28:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @JackPosobiec I hear Obama and Undead FDR were real masterminds.
833838916415344641 2017-02-20 00:41:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @jjmacnab Maybe Obama has built sand castles on the beach he's been hanging out at?  That's a kind of bunker, I suppose.

833772202696642560 2017-02-20 20:15:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @tomcolicchio I doubt it. Pence has gone from a gov w/ underwater ratings to the "reasonable VP" in the DJT admin.  He has to be thrilled.

833755890385768448 2017-02-20 19:11:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @RichLowry Why did CPAC invite a pedo lover?  Because it annoyed liberals.  What else is there?
833412958558392320 2017-02-19 20:28:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @DexterFowler @ryan_kantor What if celebrity Steve Kerr said conservatives were bad hombres & whined endlessly about who is unfair to him?

832142051676286978 2017-02-16 08:18:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes Here's what sucks: if they had spent $$, nothing would have happened, and ppl would have pointed to the spending as govt waste.
832141543855132672 2017-02-16 08:16:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @SCOTTFORCOLO Are you the shitgibbon who attacked a paper that endorsed you in 2014 as fake news b/c they asked you to support open records?
832089645848473600 2017-02-15 04:50:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @jasoninthehouse You established with Hillary's emails that only info matters, how info obtained does not. Apply the same standard, hack.

831368806907813889 2017-02-13 05:05:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker Does this mean Flynn cucked Trump by quitting first?
831367903911956481 2017-02-13 05:02:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicalwire Your evidence of this is that her statement was completely false, and at this point that's not evidence of anything.

831356828223107072 2017-02-13 04:18:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @DNC @JoyAnnReid Just lean into it.  "Update: Apparently, Donald Trump thinks Flynn knows nothing.  We'll take him at his word on this one."
831356576212488192 2017-02-13 04:17:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @GideonResnick Saying you had incomplete info about what happened in CALLS YOU MADE is some elite-level chutzpah.
831348019840716800 2017-02-13 03:43:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub On the Nurkic trade, I thought well, C's could have done KO + 2nd for just Nurkic+no pick...then realized I'm glad they didn't.

831341162740936704 2017-02-13 03:15:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight @Boilers32 This is a fair point.  I'm just saying that they're at record levels, not that other pols are models of competence.
831339303175282689 2017-02-13 03:08:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_John Smart got called for it earlier this game which was weird since he was dribbling on a post-up at the time.
831334716016062466 2017-02-13 02:50:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight To be fair, some Trumpers are just the most corrupt and incompetent ppl to serve in any Administration.
831334445378514944 2017-02-13 02:49:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @NatashaBertrand I love that Flynn thinks it'd be cool & fine if he, as NSA advisor, can't recall which countries he shared intel with.
831332515751157760 2017-02-13 02:41:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie True but remember when CP3 vs. D-Will was a debate-ish for 5 minutes?

830979093277466625 2017-02-12 03:17:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @soledadobrien Maybe he counts them as supporters anyway, like he does with @mcuban?
830978714821287936 2017-02-12 03:15:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @SamPackardNBA The number of ppl who think IT's leap is entirely unrelated to Horford joining the team is astounding.
830971703991754753 2017-02-12 02:47:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticsblog ?  The team is better w/ him, he helps space the floor for IT & it was also important for C's to prove they can land a big FA.
830863725603090432 2017-02-12 19:38:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @HPbasketball True, though Nurkic is only 22 while Plumlee is 26.
830858812911259648 2017-02-12 19:19:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @YouTube @mashable @adagioforstring @th0ttery I think she's trying to say one error in 8 years is the same as 2 errors on one day?

822263668712738816 2017-01-19 02:05:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias @hoosierchicago Meh.  I think the basic WH Syria goal was "nobody's the 'good guys', let's not get our own soldiers killed."

822261982300512256 2017-01-19 01:58:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @amyewalter @stmalia How did Dems spend even more to fix it?  Spending bills start in HoR.  O-Care passed in 2010, GOP controls HoR 2011-on.

821904053537906688 2017-01-18 02:16:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I like how people cannot differentiate a good team not playing well from a team that sucks.

821590983464906753 2017-01-17 05:32:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @RepubMass For being a wife beater?  I didn't even know she had a wife, never mind pounded the shit out of her like DJT & co.
821588694352228352 2017-01-17 05:23:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @RepubMass You think he should have nominated wife-beaters to multiple cabinet positions like DJT?  Weird take.
821586340819173376 2017-01-17 05:13:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @keithboykin @KellyScaletta @disgusted72 You don't understand growth vs. proficiency. Also, you spelled the nominee's name wrong. Holy fuck.

821128863816163329 2017-01-16 22:55:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @ConservaGrrl He's honored for both---he divided & united in a way which history in hindsight has (correctly IMO) judged admirable.
821126551139852288 2017-01-16 22:46:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @ConservaGrrl If you're not allowed to point out injustice, you can't correct it.  Ask Bull Connor or George Wallace if MLK was divisive.

821125167879372800 2017-01-16 22:41:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @RobSchneider @ErickFernandez @ConservaGrrl Because injustice should be opposed, even if doing so is seen as "divisive" by the comfortable.

820797782768250880 2017-01-15 01:00:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @neeratanden @leucinedreams @melimel521 So you'd classify Sanders as a centrist or rightwinger?
820797533018419200 2017-01-15 00:59:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @neeratanden @leucinedreams @melimel521 Wow, now Sanders isn't a member of the left?
820797056272900096 2017-01-15 00:57:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @neeratanden @leucinedreams @melimel521 PERFECT.  Thank you.  Choosing between center-leftism and neo-fascism, you choose the latter.

820796092920909824 2017-01-15 00:53:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @neeratanden @leucinedreams @melimel521 PERFECT example.  What has Trump done to earn the "personal v. policy" distinction you grant him?

820794109048688640 2017-01-15 00:45:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @neeratanden @melimel521 @leucinedreams I supported Bernie, I just oppose Trump.  That's what differentiates us.

820412631437541376 2017-01-14 23:29:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @IanBegley The simplest explanation is that his "family matter" was that he was upset about being benched and went home to his mom.
820403461422338048 2017-01-14 22:53:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan Regular Americans would pay more in taxes while the deficit increases due to the massive tax breaks to top .2%.

816824423135092736 2017-01-04 01:51:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @WSJ Given the dollar-ruble exchange rate, I suppose the FSB is probably a lot cheaper.
816823650699489280 2017-01-04 01:48:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek That's why Trump is pushing Republicans to make sure to blame what goes wrong after they repeal Obamacare on Obamacare.

816510977336193024 2017-01-03 05:06:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Now there are trolls like Wizards fan @BasedWaIl pretending to be Celtics fans to troll Jae.
816509951044554752 2017-01-03 05:01:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @MsSamanthaMay Ugh.  And he's not a C's fan, seems to follow Wiz/Rockets.  Changed his bio and name to do what he's doing tonight.
816506599762104320 2017-01-03 04:48:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @MarkMcn81 Yeah and approvingly RT'ing the guy saying come back to the Mavs is crazypants.
816500484852760577 2017-01-03 04:24:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_John I don't have any problem with it.  He's got fire in his belly.  I don't get fans coming back at him except to feel cool.

815700649744568320 2017-01-01 23:26:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @cody_k @LemieuxLGM Based on her TL, I think @Cody_K means Maddow would be heavily criticized for same behavior, ie, JoeScar is wildly in the wrong.
815691744272449536 2017-01-01 22:50:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @morningmika @JoeNBC @kwicrkd Tough to decide which of these would be worse.  I think the comped tix, but man, both are wildly corrupt.

815027712658051072 2016-12-30 02:52:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie A hallmark of the career of Kyrie Irving is his careful attention to piling up assists by getting all his teammates involved.
815024932237156352 2016-12-30 02:41:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Also he turned the ball over, and James Harden has zero lifetime turnovers.

814648157720100864 2016-12-29 01:43:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @Marc_DAmico I though the Cavs' defense was sharp & was causing havoc when the C's tried to move the ball.  Credit to the opposition.

813948351553019904 2016-12-27 03:23:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkSchofield Forgot about that.  At least that was an accident (or possibly an intern who messed up).  SAD!

813947052077948928 2016-12-27 03:17:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie The D stats Nerlens puts up in his 0-8 min/game for the last place Sixers while Smart makes crunch time plays for a 3 seed?  
813943234468585472 2016-12-27 03:02:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh @jacobkornbluh Can we just agree that his name should be "hot take Josh"?  As another Josh, I approve this change.
813084988757282816 2016-12-25 18:12:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Could also be due to his increasingly poor play combined with his increasingly frequent instagram posts from the club of late.

812823532786700288 2016-12-24 00:53:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @TUSK81 Eh. What's "up" is that the Trump Admin is going to be a mix of horrific policy and comedic incompetence and this is the latter.

812498781769867264 2016-12-23 03:22:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @IAM_AFROMADE @StoolGreenie @FCAlexB Best game of his career & a NBA historic game. Last player w/ at least 45/11/11 was Larry Bird in '92.
812497886449528832 2016-12-23 03:19:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie The freak-out over a 5-point loss due to a historic game from Westbrook is unreal.  We've won 4 of 5.  Calm down, people.
811431584213581824 2016-12-20 04:42:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet They thought the election meant total victory, music swells, credits  play.  Ugly surprise that there's no real world walk-off.

811422556368449536 2016-12-20 04:06:27 UTC <bosdcla14> I just watched a 5'9'' guy drop 44 points on 16 shots against a great defense.  That was incredible, @Isaiah_Thomas.
811421965785309184 2016-12-20 04:04:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @cam_fox Against a team that defines itself with its defense, and does so with good reason.
811421759136112642 2016-12-20 04:03:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie #4 drops 44.
811420542456578048 2016-12-20 03:58:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Its my fault.  After he got the rebound and made a FT, I had a brief moment where I thought Amir might not be an albatross.

811064152437293056 2016-12-19 04:22:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @bluemassgroup I'm sorry, but did a Trump supporter just need smelling salts about someone else not respecting boundaries?
811063679252721664 2016-12-19 04:20:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @seanmdav What does "hacked the electoral college" even mean?  Convince electors to change their vote?  I've never heard anyone say that.
809947502027931648 2016-12-16 02:25:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @sportspickle Maybe if he had a better nickname.  I mean, its not like you can do anything w/ "Allen Iverson is The Answer" for a show name.
809943420156477440 2016-12-16 02:08:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @Craaazzyuuh @pbump But the linked article sounds like it contains facts he'll dislike.  Why would he leave his safe space?

809937337551638528 2016-12-16 01:44:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Celts outscored the Hornets in Q1.  Thought "theory" was about quarters 1&3, not halves 1&2.
809930920006455296 2016-12-16 01:19:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_John Particularly if its a choice between that and the "pump fake out of an open 3" move that he's so fond of.
809824208603648000 2016-12-16 18:15:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias @4Clearsky @terib3294 Showing 1 bill is pointless, and giving ppl's contact info to a stranger would be nuts.
809822161141518336 2016-12-16 18:07:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias @4Clearsky @terib3294 "My premiums have tripled. No, I won't post the bills. Give me 10 ppl to harass." OK
809821367331799040 2016-12-16 18:03:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @chicagotribune @Afflictort @BrexitPlus Factual life: Kayne says he'd have voted for Trump.  Kanye not voting thus did not help Trump.

809575576415576064 2016-12-15 01:47:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness The biggest pop vote loser to be able to call himself President-elect, and fewer ECs than either Obama win.
809260710391738368 2016-12-14 04:56:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @jdforward @RightWingAngel @RVPatriot Trump's repeatedly expressed his sexual desire for Ivanka.  Why is everyone so PC about this?
809258805187907585 2016-12-14 04:48:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @NCGOP @mattdpearce Democrats always want to believe that Republicans are decent people too, despite all evidence to the contrary.
809258504779202560 2016-12-14 04:47:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I hate him so much.  I think I might hate him more than any other player except Wade.
809252246512758784 2016-12-14 04:22:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie This is a binding contract, right?
809246383441969152 2016-12-14 03:59:07 UTC <bosdcla14> What is it with Horford and missed layups?  Its crazy.
809243315228930050 2016-12-14 03:46:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @BecketAdams That's always true, to weird extremes.  Mulaney has a great bit ppl who admire Scarface if they saw the end of the movie.
809240975956545536 2016-12-14 03:37:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Shot selection is horrific.  Pass up an open 3 for a contested deep 2, Marcus taking an off-balance 3 w/11 left on the clock.
809237821466681345 2016-12-14 03:25:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I do appreciate it, though I'd also note that Rozier is playing his balls off so far tonight.
809206522899152896 2016-12-14 01:20:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @97Musick "You have no idea if Trump's actions are going to cause America to get nuked.  Premature!  Save it for when it happens."  Vapid.
809205559186452480 2016-12-14 01:16:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @97Musick Its based on what Trump is saying the arrangement will be.  "Oh, I know he SAYS he'll be corrupt, but don't worry, he won't."  SAD
809204880032165888 2016-12-14 01:14:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @MichaelSkolnik @cloudwanderer3 @JasonKander @LadyLibertyWDC He's announcing his corruption in advance.  We're not shrugging it off.  Awful.
809204295455211520 2016-12-14 01:11:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @pambesteder @JasonKander @dooksmcclurg @97Musick His point was straightforward, but your comment "was going" shows it went over your head.
808849093585838080 2016-12-13 01:40:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Of course, same as Cruz.  Trump is a sadist who delights in cruelty & pain, esp. to anyone who ever said anything he disliked.
808847276286222336 2016-12-13 01:33:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @JebBush Will he wear his Moscow medal when he's acting as SecState, as a reminder of who he works for?
808141547245973504 2016-12-11 02:48:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie And 13-11 is worse than 13-10.  Thanks for agreeing?
808140507847102466 2016-12-11 02:44:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I think they will, but I started this year thinking this team was superior to last year's team, and right now that's not true.
808138074026688512 2016-12-11 02:35:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie It meant they made the playoffs, where they were knocked out partially due to injuries?
808137254925283328 2016-12-11 02:31:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie You just had a series of tweets about C's repeatedly poor execution down the stretches of close games, you know.
808135527996108800 2016-12-11 02:24:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie By this point, this should have been made a point of emphasis by coaching staff.  Haven't heard discussion of it though.
808129376646594560 2016-12-11 02:00:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @dcexaminer Well, Repubs have long said Obama wants to destroy the country, so I suppose getting Trump elected would go along w/ that goal.
808107660167892994 2016-12-11 00:34:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce "Maybe a little balance"---WOW.  Horrifying people.
807430793253376001 2016-12-09 03:44:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @MitchMcConell @politicususa @PoliticusSarah It doesn't even spell his name right.  Jesus, we're failing as a species.
807429580260675585 2016-12-09 03:39:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @MitchMcConell @politicususa @PoliticusSarah You think the McConnell parody account you tweeted at is going to sue someone?
807425112639094784 2016-12-09 03:22:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @Olivianuzzi @Cronikeys Sigh.  From a Republican Stars and Stripes column in August:  http://www.stripes.com/opinion/why-russia-keeps-getting-away-with-hacking-the-us-1.421914
807424265637142528 2016-12-09 03:18:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Wasn't it the CIA reluctance to definitively come to that conclusion that led to Cheney setting up own intelligence shop?
807415818782851076 2016-12-09 02:45:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @postpolitics It might be a hard choice for Dems, but Repubs will not hesitate to put party above country.  Now and always.
807409237399715840 2016-12-09 02:18:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @nycsouthpaw I don't buy that for Comey.  Media orgs/WH, sure, but Comey actively and repeatedly intervened in ways that violated procedure.
807407253141626880 2016-12-09 02:11:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @dandrezner So while the FBI was leaking like mad to attack HRC with nothing, the CIA kept the puppet story to itself.
807404804460818432 2016-12-09 02:01:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Obama never got it.  Kept believing that he could find reasonableness where there was none.
807072618855604224 2016-12-08 04:01:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @awfulannouncing First 5 words had me thinking it was going to be a banner day for Skip Bayless.
807072275690188800 2016-12-08 03:59:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @vmetu Not enough EV from 1 comment. Bannon has described himself as a Leninist who admires Satan, which seems a bigger deal than prejudice.

807061628554342400 2016-12-08 03:17:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @JWGOP Hope you're right, but I'll believe it when talk turns to action.
807060257503473664 2016-12-08 03:12:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom "What if I told you that 30k a quarter-century ago is worth more than 30k today?  ESPN 30 for 30 presents OBVIOUS FACTS"
807059620346724352 2016-12-08 03:09:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Think it was you who had the 150k to FLA Cops> FLA cops pay 275k to M-A-L to have a "honor Trump" dinner.
807036484024868864 2016-12-08 01:37:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @robinsloan @OhSusieCue Seriously, if we could do this and not have to pay taxes, that'd be a huge win for CA.  Only get back .78.
806758261508554752 2016-12-07 07:12:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks But you know people won't buy that, so you try to juke the stats and inflame with fake pictures.  Come on.
806757537043222528 2016-12-07 07:09:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks If you have a problem with abortion, just say "hey, whether it is a person now, it will be one when its born"
806756634538061825 2016-12-07 07:05:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks So you start with a lie ("now") then you use a fake picture of a fetus and a sketchy definition.
806756355285491712 2016-12-07 07:04:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks Unless you go by the actual dictionary definition, as opposed to the one you chose.  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fetus
806754831134117888 2016-12-07 06:58:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks Exactly.  The fetus has not been born.  Trace McSorley has not been drafted.  Trump is not yet President.
806753480060719104 2016-12-07 06:53:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks By definition, a fetus is a fetus.  Saying its a person is like saying Trace McSorely is an NFL QB.
806750925545058304 2016-12-07 06:43:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks Wow!  But that's already illegal.  Be more relevant to know how many zygotes and fetuses were aborted.
806747694437761029 2016-12-07 06:30:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @ElizabethBanks Even pro-life groups acknowledge abortion is declining.http://www.operationrescue.org/about-abortion/abortions-in-america/
806746369801097216 2016-12-07 06:24:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @nakashimae So much for Pompeo serving as some sort of check on this total lunacy.
806743402331049984 2016-12-07 06:13:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @bballbreakdown @HendyLA Its esp. amazing since Curry defended him as a coach and tried to give him credit only to get crapped on by him.
806739575926235137 2016-12-07 05:57:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @bballbreakdown @HendyLA I used to him insanely gushing over Livingston b/c he was new.  "Wow, he really TRANSFORMED this team" etc.

806727035024351232 2016-12-07 05:08:08 UTC <bosdcla14> That's the thing: America is already great. Hope you decide to support the Bill of Rights & equal rights for all, unlike DJT.

806723206522368000 2016-12-07 04:52:55 UTC <bosdcla14> Man, you must have gotten triggered hard, you're confusing everything with Trump.  Is there someone I can call to help you?
806722633026838528 2016-12-07 04:50:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarlyRiveraESPN As opposed to the low tax and liberal-free NYC?  'Kay.
806721852106153984 2016-12-07 04:47:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @ClareMalone To update Orwell, the point of state-sponsored extrajudicial murder is state-sponsored extrajudicial murder.
806720769761767424 2016-12-07 04:43:14 UTC <bosdcla14> Ma'am, I'm sorry you got triggered so hard that you're disoriented.  You're thinking of what Trump needs at a Broadway show.

806702750788567040 2016-12-07 03:31:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce Of course.  Reporters should do their best to figure out if a pol is lying, and if they're lying, say so.  For any party.
806701410221862912 2016-12-07 03:26:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCNews Yep.

804541133166497792 2016-12-01 04:22:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_John Thanks for talking me down about Monroe.  So then is there a rebounding option that is less cap-constrictive?  #raininjs
804539132877778944 2016-12-01 04:14:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @JustinWolfers @SeyiTalks Absurd fawning coverage will be the standard?  Probably true.
804538382281867264 2016-12-01 04:11:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @ThomasClarkLaw "The mandate is repealed, we now have a Freedom Fee; no subsidies, instead there is MAGA Money."
804536972458868736 2016-12-01 04:05:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @katherinemiller Reminds me of Dems' polling on Ryan's Medicare plan in '12 for ads.  PPl refused to believe a factual description of it.
804534299517063168 2016-12-01 03:54:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid @AZroadunner So if there are any foreign attacks on US soil during the Trump Presidency, he's a failure?  OK.
804533191277039617 2016-12-01 03:50:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @WestWingReport "Broader rate" is "unemployed, looking for work" + "discouraged, has not sought work in 6 months" ?
804530923370790913 2016-12-01 03:41:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @wikileaks @thehill @stevils So you took 19 days to respond &your response was unrelated to "Name one thing they leaked about Trump"  OK
804518965108051968 2016-12-01 02:54:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @nhdogmom @tbogg I can deal w/ rich jerks, I can deal w/ dead teeth, but a rich jerk who looks like Maureen Ponderosa's fat dad is too much.
804518363527380992 2016-12-01 02:51:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @216Patrick @6ae025af2132401 @matthewjdowd No, they don't care.  Trump's an action flick, & you're the critic saying the physics are wrong.
804508272900214784 2016-12-01 02:11:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs @JoyAnnReid Someone should show it to Trump.  Just to drive him batty.
804508024781971457 2016-12-01 02:10:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @EsotericCD I've heard that one from other ppl.  I'm partial to the "tears in my eyes" one, reminds me of Cromwell's "bowels of Christ" line
804496709216677888 2016-12-01 01:25:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @JasonMillerinDC Dude how can you still have this up?  Trump said its Matthis.
804496487266721792 2016-12-01 01:24:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @DonaldJTrumpJr @JasonMillerinDC @woofeous He's on probation for disseminating classified info to his mistress, so that'd be weird.

804154460343713792 2016-11-30 02:45:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe Now 15 of 40.  38% from 3 is decent.  Rebounding is the issue.
804153987540795392 2016-11-30 02:43:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck The Bucks are giving Monroe DNP-CDs, and the C's are losing this rebounding battle by 19.  Let's make a freaking deal.
803815901007003648 2016-11-29 04:20:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 And, of course, Chicago as a whole.
803815621234343937 2016-11-29 04:19:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 That was great.  What a game 7.  I was pulling for them.  Was happy for Theo, Lester, Ross.
803814594959421440 2016-11-29 04:15:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 The reverse sweep of the Yankees was an amazing bonus, of course, with Riveria blowing the saves.
803814348132974592 2016-11-29 04:14:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 God and I are bros.  In '04, I told him I'd rather have the Sox than Kerry & he came thru.
803812436520235008 2016-11-29 04:06:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 I can and do.  Evil takes power when those who know it to be evil support it anyway.
803811053599485952 2016-11-29 04:01:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 Be like Trump going w/ Matthew 19:24 or Proverbs 6:32 instead of "Two Corinthians."
803810422922956800 2016-11-29 03:58:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 Rather than just going John 3:16 you chose a verse that highlights your own hypocrisy.  Its weird.
803803729958842368 2016-11-29 03:31:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa You too.  Have a good night.
803802566798675968 2016-11-29 03:27:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa Do you understand how bad things were in January 2009?  The world economy had fallen apart.
803802379040587776 2016-11-29 03:26:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa Yep.  Though for all of them, I tend to go with "oversaw the creation" rather than "created"
803801916928991237 2016-11-29 03:24:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa Neither RR nor WJC entered office w/ econ losing 800k jobs/month.  BHO had to fight to get us back to even after GWB.
803801103196270592 2016-11-29 03:21:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa 14 million private sector new jobs.  Read your own article.  Are you mad he didn't expand govt workforce by millions?
803800471626317824 2016-11-29 03:19:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @AndyRichter @tinaissa @tomsarsfield Cool story bro: http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/29/us-q3-gross-domestic-product.html
803800129618657280 2016-11-29 03:17:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa Your own chart shows 14.1 million new private sector jobs.  I can understand why you'd like to change the subject.
803799465639325696 2016-11-29 03:15:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 It would be like if my bio was "the most important thing in the world is email server security."
803798496847360000 2016-11-29 03:11:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @tinaissa How can you cite something from January which shows 14 million new private sector jobs to dispute 15 million?
803797833962778624 2016-11-29 03:08:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @AndyRichter @tinaissa @BronxLaugher Where did you see 5.5 billion?  That's well over a million dollars per job.  Really?
803795560578719745 2016-11-29 02:59:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @ObsoleteDogma @TheScreenTeam @mikeyj4460 Your bio is an anti-boasting Bible verse & you back Trump.  Why the quote if you don't mean it?
803795270924283904 2016-11-29 02:58:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @JustinWolfers @ScottPaulAAM This is like saying that openly paying hostage-takers doesn't influence the amount of hostage-taking that much.

803785784352337920 2016-11-29 02:20:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias @jackclymer Nah.  In that case, you actually had to bring in a clunker and buy a car.  Here, the threat alone is enough.

803782624023937024 2016-11-29 02:08:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @BecketAdams Scalia was truly someone without any intellectual consistency at all & was openly corrupt.  Media reverence for him is sad.
803781749842944003 2016-11-29 02:04:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @BecketAdams @Supreme____Beef @gloomhauer Keep it clean.  Say his wife is ugly, his dad an assassin, and that he was corrupt.
803777127606722560 2016-11-29 01:46:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeed @jamesrbuk @zauteb Yeah, she wrote a whole column about Mitt's coming landslide b/c of yard signs and enthusiasm.
803028731359100929 2016-11-27 00:12:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeed @jamesrbuk @zauteb Are you quoting Peggy Noonan in 2012?
803027687174504448 2016-11-27 00:08:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeed @jamesrbuk @zauteb If I say that its gonna rain tomorrow b/c I ate steak tonight, and it rains, I'm a genius?  Weird take brah.
803025953823879168 2016-11-27 00:01:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots Can we please for the love of God stop taking deep shots on covered receivers when we have 12 yard completions wide open?
803023867455410177 2016-11-27 23:53:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeed @jamesrbuk @zauteb So you recognize the gaping vapid stupidity of the "crowd size" argument.  So why make it?
803021182614138880 2016-11-27 23:42:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @cnnbrk Without evidence, you hacks.
803016011351998464 2016-11-27 23:21:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs @EmptyCircle Won't go that way.  Trump will argue it gives grounds for emergency rule by him & Jones will back him.
803015486527143936 2016-11-27 23:19:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @electionland It isn't about facts, its about feelings.  Trumpers FEEL that vote fraud is committed, therefore its true. Facts don't matter.
803015042492993537 2016-11-27 23:18:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp He's a petulant man-child who has emerged at a moment when such characteristics are rewarded by the media and populace.

803011182051393536 2016-11-27 23:02:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @Reuters Try to provide some facts in your headline. Not everyone realizes how often Trump lies and take his claims seriously.
803006065638014978 2016-11-27 22:42:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @joshgreenman @flmolly @TheRickWilson @JohannesRiecke Which, in turn, got it from some guy's tweets.
803003152807014401 2016-11-27 22:30:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @people I agree with you that its false, but we owe the process the recount that DJT's tweet demands.
803000332821364736 2016-11-27 22:19:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @Evan_McMullin I doubt DJT is really considering him. Same as Cruz: force a former opponent to grovel; humiliate 'em; delight in the cruelty
802998995190628353 2016-11-27 22:14:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeed @jamesrbuk @zauteb Are you quoting Mondale? That's what he said about why he was going to beat Reagan.
802998675567951872 2016-11-27 22:12:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots Can we start playing normal? No more TOs that give away first downs, no more desperate deep shots rather than disciplined drives.
802998055469457408 2016-11-27 22:10:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @OrinKerr @Le_FouDuRoi In CA, cast ballots have IDs that match them with voters.  I've got no problem matching them up (again).
802997479142608896 2016-11-27 22:08:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidaxelrod Pretty clear the invite to Mitt was just to humiliate him when the position is given to someone else.
802996898084900864 2016-11-27 22:05:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @chatham58 Annoying so far. Take an unnecessary TO which allows Jets to nullify a 1st; then deep shot after deep shot..let's play our game.
802996343774003200 2016-11-27 22:03:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @mattdpearce @PeterDo63016117 Take your own advice.
802995683657531392 2016-11-27 22:01:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @CBSNews How about a "all experts and election boards disagree" in that headline you hacks?
802990587968270336 2016-11-27 21:40:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @The_Archon Sounds good. Also purge the known fraudsters, like a certain campaign CEO who resided in someone's Florida garage.
802989579473063936 2016-11-27 21:36:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom That's where I am.  We can't have any doubt now that the DJT doubts the legitimacy of the election that made him PEOTUS.
802984073706647552 2016-11-27 21:14:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCNews @brennen_simon Why do you disbelieve Michael Cargill, the owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin?  One of sources quoted.
802982170570723333 2016-11-27 21:07:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro He finds any serious opposition to him or criticism of him to be an intolerable affront that is illegitimate & should be unlawful.
802981119734022144 2016-11-27 21:03:12 UTC <bosdcla14> As the comments note, Trump is making a strong argument for an audit of the vote.https://twitter.com/BrendanNyhan/status/802980163818491905
802980929887236098 2016-11-27 21:02:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @DavidAFrench Can DJT be impeached, Pence becomes POTUS & I hate his policies but don't have to worry the US could become a dictatorship?
802980035116335105 2016-11-27 20:58:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @SumerSloan @Green_Footballs @gcbrown1956 Well, those reports demand a vote audit.  You changed my mind Greg.
802979512019517441 2016-11-27 20:56:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @tonyposnanski @itsFranco He's going to have control of nukes & he's a petulant child. Its not a game. What's wrong w/ you?
802979125610872832 2016-11-27 20:55:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump Nah, your message resonated in loser states.  Winner states like CA don't want to change policies except for Feds taking $$
802977813305393152 2016-11-27 20:50:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn I know there was the thing where Bannon was registered at someone else's place in Florida.  Maybe that's what he's saying?
802976155380961280 2016-11-27 20:43:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump How does subtracting Bannon's Florida vote help you? Did he not vote for you?
802965486485078020 2016-11-27 20:01:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney @KellyannePolls @CNNSotu I assume the Mitt thing is the Cruz thing p2: Trump delights in cruelty & humiliation.
802962718785503232 2016-11-27 19:50:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @CNNSotu @craasch @michael_epps This is not CURRENTLY a dictatorship.  Trumpers would back one though.

802738184677376000 2016-11-26 04:57:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @willyv96 Fuck, even Rogers---who met with Trump for NSA---said Russia interfered with the election to support Trump.
802737752336924677 2016-11-26 04:56:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @willyv96 Don't say you like freedom of speech.  Trump said he wants a veto over press coverage.  He's skullfucking the Constitution.

802734895592304640 2016-11-26 04:44:47 UTC <bosdcla14> I suspect the cable TV disparity would be even more dramatically anti-Clinton.https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/802656352799629312
802734787119161344 2016-11-26 04:44:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @zeynep Any data on cable TV time on these topics?  I think the disparity might be even greater.
802732469921320960 2016-11-26 04:35:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @SethMacFarlane @willyv96 A hacker group & a security service were co-opted by a hostile foreign pwr to deny the pop vote winner the office.

802601824847065089 2016-11-26 19:56:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @stephenfhayes I suppose if Obama directly praised Castro for murdering political opponents, he'd be the Repub nominee?

801268389666701317 2016-11-22 03:37:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @nickeaster19 How's it hypocrisy?  They wrote a gazillion articles attacking HRC for this stuff.  One on DJT is out of bounds?
801267030833795073 2016-11-22 03:32:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @MyHoodie47 Well, if they'd written a story on this, they might have only been able to have 999,999 stories on emails.  Hard call.
801266587026108416 2016-11-22 03:30:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @PC_USA50 DJT argued that previous payments to CF would compromise her as POTUS.  Same logic.  Did you follow the campaign or nah?
801266312949342209 2016-11-22 03:29:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @nickeaster19 HRC will not be President.  Donald Trump will.  Do you understand why that is an important fact for this story?
801265965480570880 2016-11-22 03:27:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @SeyiTalks DJT argued that previous payments to HRC's foundation would compromise her as Pres.  Did you not follow the campaign?
801264890279141377 2016-11-22 03:23:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @Redistrict "The comments in the blog on http://DeepBlueLeft.net is just as pathetic as Donald Trump's refusal to blind trust his holdings."

801247230749331456 2016-11-22 02:13:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias @BusterBroncoEsq I suppose its an impossible dream to have a non-nutter non-hack in both spots.

801241555528888320 2016-11-22 01:50:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @JamilSmith To defend voters a bit, the media coverage of this was minimal, & made it seem like NBD, with Newsweek the exception.
801240616826847233 2016-11-22 01:47:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenTedCruz Government worker worth millions happy private sector workers earning 47 thousand or less will not get raise.

800905597293998080 2016-11-21 03:35:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @KSofen Agreed.  It is indefensible.

800892507877875712 2016-11-21 02:43:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @danielrainge Greg Monroe is getting DNP-CDs (!!), while Amir is getting 22 minutes a night & pulling down 4 boards. For heaven's sake, man.

800456528092221441 2016-11-20 21:51:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @jaketapper So we're going to have a national security policy based on coin flips and ouija boards?  We'll be lucky to avoid another 9/11.
800447385117655040 2016-11-20 21:15:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @NBCNews @Green_Footballs Strongly disagree.  Pence is far on the right, but a regular pol.  Trump/Bannon seek societal collapse.

799445780826177536 2016-11-17 02:55:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @BresPolitico @marthaevapearl No problem.  At first, when I googled it, it seemed like you were right and I was wrong.
799445283918618624 2016-11-17 02:53:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @BresPolitico @marthaevapearl OK.  I miss the days where these details seemed less urgent and crucial.
799442149829816320 2016-11-17 02:40:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @evanasmith The head of a "blind trust" and a Russia Today contributor meeting with PEOTUS and the Japanese PM?  No, I would say not normal.
799441656764207105 2016-11-17 02:38:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce Yep.  Technically, he didn't even lie in this particular tweet---never said the plant was moving before, just that it wouldn't.
799439307702288384 2016-11-17 02:29:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @BresPolitico @marthaevapearl You are correct.  Sorry, don't know why I thought otherwise.
799438644192739328 2016-11-17 02:26:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @BresPolitico @marthaevapearl No Senate confirmation for NSA.
799438240826544128 2016-11-17 02:25:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @IvanCNN So there's Flynn, who is still employed by Turkey's govt, and Ivanka, who is the head of the "blind trust."  Heaven help us.
799436401997594624 2016-11-17 02:17:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddale8 The tweet doesn't actually say that.  It just says the plant is staying in Kentucky and misleads as to the rest.
799428290247159809 2016-11-17 01:45:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @KFILE @PerryBullock Are you talking to Andrew or to the incoming NSA head who retweets fake stories?
799426933507256320 2016-11-17 01:40:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Kushner getting rid of anyone associated with Christie b/c Christie put his dad in prison was like the end of Usual Suspects.
799420387259842560 2016-11-17 01:14:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @Hayes_BHCSports @PFTCommenter @BHCSports You know who else took issue with media coverage?
799404102102851584 2016-11-17 00:09:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @YouTube @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly @CarlHigbie I watched it. Awful thing to cite. Contributes to culture of Trumpista terror.
799368393711157248 2016-11-17 21:47:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Kaladious This was a Trump campaign surrogate appearing in an official capacity. And you'll just excuse it if DJT echoes it.
799368158058455040 2016-11-17 21:46:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @WebsterGladwin Watch the video?
799109589501296640 2016-11-16 04:39:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @matthewjdowd @ABCPolitics FFS, stop normalizing him, his goons just went on TV and cited Japenese internment as a model.
799082902575140864 2016-11-16 02:53:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @nytimes @mattyglesias Call your Dem Senators and/or Rep if you disagree with this idea.
798979203668459520 2016-11-16 20:01:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Except that is what the NYT reported
798973538602393600 2016-11-16 19:38:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @Redistrict It does matter. Thanks.
798908288125411329 2016-11-16 15:19:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Also the NYT story is that he'd spoken with several world leaders so his tweet is weird.
798754986045771777 2016-11-15 05:10:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Does it matter, though?  Let's say Trump got the BEST briefing materials, I doubt he would have read them.
798754459572531201 2016-11-15 05:07:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @redsteeze @iveyanaa Sounds right to me.  Your generation can't do any worse than we're currently doing.

798738433275400192 2016-11-15 04:04:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Run that 2005 effort to stop Social Security phaseout back.  Conscience Caucus v. Fainthearted Faction.
798734592467312640 2016-11-15 03:49:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @SeanMcElwee Call your Senators and Reps.  I got a Feinstein staffer yesterday & urged her to oppose after hearing she had no position.
798734497327947776 2016-11-15 03:48:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @chrislhayes @SeanMcElwee @doclynn For the next group.  Current beneficiaries keep theirs; the rest of us get voucher-ized.

798725958622539777 2016-11-15 03:14:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes Yes, it would be nice if we looked into the fact that the Russians repeatedly attacked Americans.  Doubt it'll happen...
798725690153517056 2016-11-15 03:13:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @matthewamiller Not sure about using the present tense on that.  DJT promised to imprison HRC regardless of a finding of guilt or not.
798725064988295169 2016-11-15 03:11:09 UTC <bosdcla14> He also decided it'd be a good idea to spend enough money to air this ad during the Super Bowl.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f69VmIgmhOk
798724206510780416 2016-11-15 03:07:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @gregkarber I'd say that, not only is it a reality show, it is the most intense reality show of all time.

798708469188542465 2016-11-15 02:05:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkSchofield @SpeakerRyan Its more believable than him not knowing that Bannon describes himself as a Leninist who seeks destruction.

798629147601870848 2016-11-15 20:50:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @kerpen @Taniel @Dan001963 So you think he'll prosecute Bannon and the 3 cases of confirmed voter fraud this year, all Repub?  I doubt it.

798378374695522304 2016-11-14 04:13:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @kurteichenwald @King17Larry Why would any ally share intelligence if it could be shared with the Trump kids & their businesses?
798374580968517633 2016-11-14 03:58:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie IT was great.  Too many missed laups early and surprisingly super-shaky decision-making by Brad down the stretch.
798372484907024384 2016-11-14 03:50:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @CSNNE @celtics Why no Brown/Mickey on the lob, why have IT in the backcourt earlier..Brad's great, but horrible finish tonight.
798370674007867392 2016-11-14 03:42:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid It'd be one thing if Trump won some big majority.  He didn't.  He got fewer voters than HRC.  PPL don't want this.  Stop him.
798369820903231488 2016-11-14 03:39:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticshub The last few minutes, did Brad have a brain-freeze or something?  The IT not past halfcourt play, no big guys for a lob...
798362977556541441 2016-11-14 03:12:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Can he...play less?  Maybe a lot less?
798356638683971584 2016-11-14 02:47:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @celtics Fewer missed layups please.
798345935122087940 2016-11-14 02:04:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Why too crazy?  Resume looks great on paper.  Trump loyalist.  White male.  What else is there?

798331828000014336 2016-11-14 01:08:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @Wu_Tang_Finance Largest protests?  1960s. Income inequality?  Much lower. Fewer protests?  2004-2008, 2012-2016. Inequality expands rapidly
798330698075508736 2016-11-14 01:04:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @BrentGriffiths @politico @Carlos8791 They're supposed to be running a blind trust.  No ally would give us classified info w/ this setup.
798288472058384384 2016-11-14 22:16:17 UTC <bosdcla14> He will be missed.https://twitter.com/rschooley/status/798278489472319488
798273898789761024 2016-11-14 21:18:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro I think Repubs are terrified of Trumpers & will let him do whatever he wants in exec noms if he will kill O-Care & voucher Medicare.

798200061653958656 2016-11-14 16:24:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @baseballcrank @DonderolibtR Yes. That would also be racist. I agree. You have made my point.
798067420992708608 2016-11-13 07:37:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @liamstack @MarnieKaplan Shouldn't we have known better than to hire him for it?
798037742940626945 2016-11-13 05:39:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Assuming the gulag has wi-fi, I'll check in then. You can tell me how you came to despise Californians yet root for the SF Giants.
798036846492020736 2016-11-13 05:36:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @ScottAdamsSays @Bedhead_ I assume having Dilbert strips read aloud is what DJT means when he threatens "more than waterboarding."
798036362515517440 2016-11-13 05:34:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ His only consistent positions involve threatening anyone who criticizes him & attacking the Bill of Rights. Not by name, of course
798035841658408964 2016-11-13 05:32:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ He does nothing but BS. Guy's switched parties 5 times in 14 years. Toyed with jettisoning immigration during this campaign.
798035350044033024 2016-11-13 05:30:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Exactly. People don't become more responsible with power. It's resonant yaw. Unstable on the launch platform means worse in flight
798034821557600256 2016-11-13 05:28:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Nah. Hitler was too direct. Need plausible deniability. Also too poor and unmarried. Those would be deal breakers.
798034432816869377 2016-11-13 05:26:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Obama is polite to him in one meeting and suddenly he's keeping part of Obamacare. HRC compliments his kids& he's almost crying.
798034125244350464 2016-11-13 05:25:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Please. Bowing down to bullshit doesn't make anybody an alpha male. As for Il Douche, guy is a petulant attention-starved child.
798033389542481921 2016-11-13 05:22:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ And what establishment?  McConnell is a non-entity, and Ryan's so scared of Trump he can be called Speaker von Papen.
798032797680091137 2016-11-13 05:20:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ Not to mention his longstanding attacks on the basic liberties of the Bill of Rights.
798032416497541120 2016-11-13 05:18:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bedhead_ He's not even in office, and his top staff threaten to take legal action against political opponents who criticize him.
798029230323834880 2016-11-13 05:06:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomPauken @JWGOP @Bedhead_ How's it spin?  Opposing Trumpist fascism will hurt his career, and will cost him friendships as seen here.
798026439010357248 2016-11-13 04:55:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomPauken @JWGOP @Bedhead_ I guess he feels strongly enough about opposing racism and fascism that he's putting country before party.
798020633711869952 2016-11-13 04:32:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @hannahmosk @thetinkerfae @JeffEFrazier Its amazing that a policy director for a TX state senator wouldn't  know TX electors are unbound.
798015579521069056 2016-11-13 04:11:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @hannahmosk I do think it could be used to troll.  "FYI, someone is sending emails from your account without a salutation & in comic sans."
798006950122242050 2016-11-13 03:37:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots I am not a fan of this zone defense, which I will call the "leave everyone totally wide open and have no pass rush" zone.
797999289142153216 2016-11-13 03:07:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @Serena_AD @ddale8 @HeerJeet I think he talks himself into stuff & he certainly hates Obama (witness '12 meltdown) more than the Clintons.
797994522638622720 2016-11-13 02:48:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @60Minutes Honestly, for him, that's the best we can expect.
797993140703535104 2016-11-13 02:42:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe [Trump craps himself] Conway: It is up to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to clean this up.
797992198377598976 2016-11-13 02:39:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @baseballcrank @DonderolibtR He's a very effective racist?  I mean, I suppose.  Guy's website had a "black crime" section.
797990777091563520 2016-11-13 02:33:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @baseballcrank @DonderolibtR What lie?  I'm just asking where he gets 20 years.  Its an actual question.
797990188236447744 2016-11-13 02:31:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Nah, I mean it was bad, but its not in the red zone, not from his endzone, is nearly a punt.
797981470480445440 2016-11-13 01:56:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @baseballcrank @DonderolibtR Breitbart says he was in Navy for 7 years then did Pentagon "stint". Where do you get 20 years from?
797977944253612033 2016-11-13 01:42:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicususa @hockymom5 Name one person Obama threatened to take legal action against for criticizing him.
797977237597208576 2016-11-13 01:39:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicususa @hockymom5 He's the President-elect, and he has pledged to destroy our Constitutional Republic. He hates the bill of rights.
797945539060899840 2016-11-13 23:33:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidaxelrod @HeerJeet Exactly.  @Reince will be Card-style CoS getting burgers.  Someone has to get the food, since Christie's gone.
797945029662687232 2016-11-13 23:31:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek "We drive purchasing decisions but not voting decisions" is a silly claim.
797944779904466944 2016-11-13 23:30:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @emmyrossum I'm sorry.  They're awful.  The block button is your friend.
797944220434583552 2016-11-13 23:28:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicususa @hockymom5 Ah, so just a threat of abuse of power.  Well I guess everyone should be relieved.
797940824377991168 2016-11-13 23:14:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidfrum @jbarro @newtgingrich Think @Reince will be Andy Card-style CoS, going on burger runs. Someone has to with Christie out.

797922795887833088 2016-11-13 22:03:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @FallenAngel_Deb Are you under the impression this is something other than a pro-Trump puff piece? Endless sympathetic quotes.
797921747777437696 2016-11-13 21:59:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @jaketapper And the reply section split: Trumpers saying "no Trumper thinks that, stop lying" vs. Trumpers saying "yes, I agree w/ him!!"

797902916652675072 2016-11-13 20:44:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonfavs Everyone is interpreting this as "sue."  "Legal sense" could be something far, far worse than that.

797293141002887168 2016-11-11 04:21:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @angiesimone123 And Comey's confessional in June/July and then his encore in late October gave the victory to Trump.

797164655068090368 2016-11-11 19:50:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @theintercept @cher_toi People are doing what Trump told them to do if there was ever this exact situation: an EC/pop vote split.
797115288613363712 2016-11-11 16:34:29 UTC <bosdcla14> So insane.https://twitter.com/simonmaloy/status/797090628568043520
796951507039973376 2016-11-10 05:43:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes Think of the phone as a canary in the coalmine: if he starts tweeting about using nukes, he can be involuntarily committed.
796937871701602305 2016-11-10 04:49:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah @ybarrap We win the Presidential and aggregate House and Senate popular vote but don't win the Presidency, House or Senate?
796934227694481408 2016-11-10 04:35:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah I promise to give Donald Trump the same respect as President that Trump gave to Barack Obama as President for 8 years.
796933806418579456 2016-11-10 04:33:20 UTC <bosdcla14> For all the people who think that turnout was lower this year than 2012...https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/796933472615075840
796885570479718400 2016-11-10 01:21:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @wolfblitzer @CNNSitRoom It was always obvious what he was. You chose to ignore it so could say "emails" 24/7.
796864184642248704 2016-11-10 23:56:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddale8 Technically, he could have meant he always planned to bail early.
796819536674594816 2016-11-10 20:59:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @MrDanZak @petridishes @AP Press empowered him to do this.  If a candidate hates 1st amendment, maybe that's more important than emails?
796752783378563073 2016-11-10 16:34:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @JonLemire @Fahrenthold Press mentions of HRC emails exceeded all policy mentions combined. Press won Trump the EC. Now they get this.
796742179892756482 2016-11-10 15:51:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @lefthandturn80 Only anti-61 ads I saw were pharma and VFW.
796741971834322944 2016-11-10 15:51:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @TexasSheri Cool story. http://thestir.cafemom.com/politics_views/111515/rand_paul_supporter_stomps_womans
796573174976626688 2016-11-09 04:40:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @AlecMacGillis Also said people with Mexican parents shouldn't be judges.
796564228530470912 2016-11-09 04:04:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @BettyBowers @ArtTillery1980 Fair point, the Tea Party's threats of violence does mean it is more fairly characterized as a riot.
796563583748411392 2016-11-09 04:02:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @ericturner106 Democracy is when the candidate with the most votes wins.
796562461616963589 2016-11-09 03:57:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @BettyBowers @ArtTillery1980 Obama won 51% of the popular vote twice.  First person to do it since FDR. Also, the Tea Party isn't a protest?
796540016981921794 2016-11-09 02:28:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs Maybe lets put it behind us and try to figure out a way to survive the next 4 years.
796539896454385668 2016-11-09 02:28:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs @lefthandturn80 Bernie campaigned hard for Prop 61 here in CA and it lost.  I mean, who knows, but that's not encouraging.
796538245123362816 2016-11-09 02:21:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah But he's a good GS shill, like Campaign CEO Bannon. :)
796536032888057860 2016-11-09 02:12:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarlosGerboles Fine, you think its a joke.  20 million will lose their insurance, millions may be deported, but those are gag lines.  Bye.
796535261870039040 2016-11-09 02:09:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @KPhed @CarlosGerboles No!  I'm horrified. Why are you so fucking happy?  People are going to fucking die.
796535118911406084 2016-11-09 02:09:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarlosGerboles What the fuck is wrong with you?  This isn't a game or a purity test. What was done will have consequences for decades.
796534470337843200 2016-11-09 02:06:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @KPhed @CarlosGerboles Stein skullfucked the country for her own fucking vanity by contributing to Trump's win.
796533908301107200 2016-11-09 02:04:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @KPhed @CarlosGerboles What part of "votes are still being counted" do you not understand?
796533685906526208 2016-11-09 02:03:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie This team is trash right now.  Good lord do they need a semi-competent big man since Horford's concussion is neverending.
796533460114567168 2016-11-09 02:02:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @KPhed @CarlosGerboles How about 15,000 in Michigan?
796533100050345985 2016-11-09 02:01:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @KPhed @CarlosGerboles She literally argued to voters that Trump was a better choice than Clinton and convinced some liberals of it.
796527760084758528 2016-11-09 01:39:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck So much for getting my mind off things by watching the Celtics take on a team they should be able to handle.
796527134185504769 2016-11-09 01:37:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah @Glitchy_Ashburn @NYGIANTFAN1976 "I want everyone to get in shape, so I'm going to encourage them to gain 400 pounds."
796526262877618176 2016-11-09 01:33:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah @AnewThomasPaine We're discussing Cabinet appointees.  How is that not accepting the result?
796524976316813313 2016-11-09 01:28:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie They're just a lazy, sloppy team.
796524545201078273 2016-11-09 01:27:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah I had a horrific reaction when I saw the GS-er he wants to be TreasSec---I was OK with it.  Better than Alex Jones.
796521235136049152 2016-11-09 01:13:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah Obama won over 51% of the vote twice.  First President to do it since FDR.
796517115733876736 2016-11-09 00:57:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarolineArnoldx There it is.  The hate.  Its all that motivates you. Its your core.  You don't care about ideas or facts.  Just your rage.
796464085726441473 2016-11-09 21:26:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @CarolineArnoldx False, but even if true, you don't care about email retention policy except to punish HRChttp://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-companies-destroyed-emails-documents-515120.html
796463715583291392 2016-11-09 21:25:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarolineArnoldx Look at your TL. "Lying, evil bitch" "rigged" "sleazebag".  That's what animates you.  No discussion of tariff policy.
796459003437944832 2016-11-09 21:06:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @CarolineArnoldx CNN alleged this in 2016, w/o basis, plus you're admitting you didn't care at all when it happened.  Point proven.
796458265009733632 2016-11-09 21:03:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @CarolineArnoldx You don't care if Hillary goes to jail?  You wrote angry posts abt the Bushies "misplacing" 22,000,000 emails? Bah.
796457357681115136 2016-11-09 21:00:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @CarolineArnoldx Investigations by Repubs Issa, Gowdy & Comey found no crime.  You seek imprisonment anyway b/c it excites you.
796450315868336129 2016-11-09 20:32:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @ggreenwald Some of the voters in those areas who cited Hillary's emails as their RFD convinced themselves of it, you let 'em know GG.
796446779965214720 2016-11-09 20:18:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @CarolineArnoldx Caroline's comment shows why: hatred and a desire for revenge on enemies is what motivates Trumpers, not policy.
796446491443228672 2016-11-09 20:16:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS @briantidwell09 That's fine, say Republic then.  But its not a democracy.
796444344852975616 2016-11-09 20:08:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS Stop saying "our democracy." Say the Constitution or whatever, but in democracies the person with the most votes wins.
796443547176083456 2016-11-09 20:05:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @cram_shane Is "when you go, you have to take Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama with you" trashing the Texas independence idea?
796442624819220480 2016-11-09 20:01:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ConnorMooney Fuck that, Texas leaving was all good, they just had to take LA, Ark, Miss, Alabama, OK with them.
796438573553590272 2016-11-09 19:45:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @EricBoehlert Congratulate him on this appointment: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/
796437553163292672 2016-11-09 19:41:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Combination of a lack of effective communication & an attitude on the left that resembles this analysishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hZJ4cotUWc
796433652158644224 2016-11-09 19:25:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @GreenPartyUS @DrJillStein Interesting choice your candidate made for the EPA.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-picks-top-climate-skeptic-to-lead-epa-transition/
796430541683732480 2016-11-09 19:13:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbogg Also Feingold.  A principled pol who lost his seat for his bravery lost to a less successful, less compelling form of Trump in WI.
796429051439169536 2016-11-09 19:07:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidfrum @Roger247 You're the one that misspelled something, you Constitution-hating cockwomble.
796427419221512192 2016-11-09 19:01:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidfrum @Roger247 I must have missed the lynchings, hosings, dogs & unequal schools.  Thoughts and prayers to you and your hurt fee-fees.
796425470451384320 2016-11-09 18:53:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidfrum @Roger247 And your objection to this is that he gave his political opponents a seat instead of pledging to jail them?
796407962189250560 2016-11-09 17:43:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah I would note: historic records for longevity of growth, not for rate of growth during the growth period.

796406391602712576 2016-11-09 17:37:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @amandacarpenter The Trumpers calling him a cuck are correct.  Trump will throw him a few scraps and he'll be more than satisfied.
796405914702004226 2016-11-09 17:35:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @politico @amandacarpenter @jojonnyjon You know Bannon worked at Goldman Sachs, right? You think he's going to be only GS-er? Why?
796404881938448384 2016-11-09 17:31:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @POTUS @BostonGlobe In democracies, the candidate who gets the most votes wins. So that's not us.
796402468036849664 2016-11-09 17:21:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @seanmdav @Green_Footballs Republicans will just eliminate the filibuster and any trace of procedure that allows the minority a voice.
796401859674054656 2016-11-09 17:19:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @ryanlcooper And its worse now.  2 out of the last 5, a 40% failure rate, and this one is a massive failure.
796401576784953345 2016-11-09 17:18:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkSchofield Why would it?
796395890390929408 2016-11-09 16:55:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteBlackburn And upon getting it back a minority of American voters made it President of the United States?
796394729562738688 2016-11-09 16:51:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @minakimes I think the internet drives people insane.  I'm not sure what you do about that.
796394318877507584 2016-11-09 16:49:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro He can just say he's no longer pro-choice.  If it works for Trump, why not Rudy?
796392365728485376 2016-11-09 16:41:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @Maggie_Hassan @alfranken That seems ambitious.  I'd settle for limiting the slide backwards.
796391782644740096 2016-11-09 16:39:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq Thought it only existed for SOTUS anyway.
796283935588163584 2016-11-09 09:30:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @SethMacFarlane @BillWStl He has pledged to jail political opponents, murder the children of suspected terrorists, and veto the free press.
796243116957147136 2016-11-08 06:48:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @JayCostTWS I doubt it.  Need one to go the other way.  Republicans don't want democracy because they'd have lost 4 of the last 5 with it.
796224772833087488 2016-11-08 05:35:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @rudepundit @IdahoLark You're assuming there will BE a press.  He's said he wants a veto on coverage and that he'll sue them otherwise.
796221309361352704 2016-11-08 05:22:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @supahseppe @shonzshyt Maybe you can put that on a card and hand it to Mexicans and Muslims as he deports and interns them respectively.
796215920829997056 2016-11-08 05:00:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @LA_Banker With a Republican House and Senate, I mean, you sort of could if you're organized.
796214273181523969 2016-11-08 04:54:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @adamsmithtimes You think?  The likely popular vote winner isn't going to be President due to the intervention of a state security service.
796199157853655041 2016-11-08 03:54:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @greenhousenyt And every network giving saturation coverage to literally nothing.
796198480477704192 2016-11-08 03:51:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @JamesFallows @HMof2 Is CNN part of a publicly traded company?  If so, they just lost it.  #TrumpCrash
796198181746790400 2016-11-08 03:50:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn What do you call a country where the candidate who gets fewer votes wins twice in 5 elections? Not a democracy, that's for sure.
796197971301842944 2016-11-08 03:49:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @qhardy Ppl driven insane by the internet, routinely say crime is at an all-time high when its nowhere close.  No perspective.
796194135031959553 2016-11-08 03:34:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias It'll mean the US isn't a democracy.  Twice in 5 elections, the candidate with fewer votes "won."
796189696468467713 2016-11-08 03:16:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah Eh.  Voters don't seem to have long memories.  Case in point: The GOP tried to destroy the auto industry & are winning MI.
796177977574715396 2016-11-08 02:29:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @LA_Banker There's a bunch of states assumed to be in her column that look problematic, Wisconsin and Michigan being chief among them.

795837687055794176 2016-11-07 03:57:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn Not only would he spell it wrong, but like with "Ne-VAH-Dah" he'd insist his way was correct.
795836136329388033 2016-11-07 03:51:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @SeniABC @ABCLiz Unlike your lies, Trump actually lusted after 10 year olds including his daughter and raped a 13-year old.

795834311962345473 2016-11-07 03:44:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @SeniABC @ABCLiz Obama won over 51% twice, something even Reagan didn't do.  You misspelled "Christian" in your profile.
795830189972299776 2016-11-07 03:27:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @CBSPolitics @GlobeChadFinn @bnlfan_thunder Fair point, though on this one Trump's team acknowledged no letter:http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/07/31/trump-retreats-from-claim-that-nfl-sent-letter-regarding-debates/
795828074029805568 2016-11-07 03:19:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn It would, in fact, be the 2nd NFL letter Trump would have made up during the campaign.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-denies-sending-donald-trump-letter-over-presidential-debates/

795357622157217792 2016-11-06 20:10:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @weeklystandard @brithume @highwaymannc Why lie about this?  http://www.snopes.com/obama-hillary-clinton-isnt-qualified/
795353542231887872 2016-11-06 19:53:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @hannahbfine Both inspiring and infuriating.  It shouldn't take hours of waiting be able to vote.
795318940255670272 2016-11-06 17:36:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @geoffreyvs And there are 700k more Dems in CA than in 2012, while the Repubs have declined by 300k, so it'll be even bigger this time.
795062201807618048 2016-11-05 00:36:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @thehill @SierranWolf Hmm, so you think that's why the FBI is leaking attacks on Hillary? Interesting thought.
795018325046636544 2016-11-05 21:41:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Anxious that he might not make more money than you soon.
795005505886240769 2016-11-05 20:50:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan The last time we put the GOP in charge of Homeland Security, 9/11 happened and bin Laden escaped justice until Obama took over.
794578158989164544 2016-11-04 16:32:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @HowardKurtz @krystalball @BretBaier Well, you catapulted the propaganda already.
794375317192179712 2016-11-03 03:06:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson @TomPerezHairnet Patriot- a person who vigorously supports their country.  He's an Australian who lives in Ecuador's embassy.
794354863152906240 2016-11-03 01:45:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @AriMelber @mmurraypolitics @megynkelly Why not billions of agents?
794342083687378944 2016-11-03 00:54:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @paulwaldman1 Does the Judiciary Act of 1869 (which stipulates 9 Supreme Court justices) have any actual teeth/enforcement mechanism?
794340684027203585 2016-11-03 00:49:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs Well, Obama made Comey FBI Director b/c he's always trying to find mythical "reasonable Republicans" who love their country...
794331173094768640 2016-11-03 00:11:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @Redistrict Is NY-22 44% Republican and 32% Democratic?  Because that's the poll sample.
794330556553052160 2016-11-03 00:08:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias True, but that's not as big a miss as saying the Cubs are badly run, which Trump did in March.
794317763204349952 2016-11-03 23:18:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @Yair_Rosenberg @nymjr7 What do you mean?
794053501341106176 2016-11-02 05:48:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @Jamesbr71035348 Taken in a show of good faith following a bet with Guiliani after she became Senator.https://twitter.com/VampireLestat/status/794043963787182081
794038427708555265 2016-11-02 04:48:08 UTC <bosdcla14> WHAT A GAME THAT WAS AWESOME
794036467253137408 2016-11-02 04:40:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @katherinemiller A team from Hillary's birth city that she rooted for as a kid who overcomes a seemingly endless drought? Come on.
794034543422410752 2016-11-02 04:32:42 UTC <bosdcla14> David Ross hit a homer in this game in the 6th inning. I mention this because it feels like it was weeks ago. 2016: everything lasts forever
794023955958902784 2016-11-02 03:50:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @sethmoulton You're awake.  Joe Maddon is fully asleep.
794023543843487744 2016-11-02 03:48:59 UTC <bosdcla14> Chapman looking like a tired pitcher in RBI baseball where the ball flutters as it approaches the plate.
794022784796082176 2016-11-02 03:45:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @Buck @PeteAbe Agreed, tho I thought Smoltz was a bit kind to Maddon's bunt decision.
794020759693885441 2016-11-02 03:37:55 UTC <bosdcla14> Except in her own sworn statement.  Cool story about somebody not running for POTUS tho.http://www.politicususa.com/2016/10/09/sworn-affidavit-juanita-broaddrick-denies-allegations.html
794017849731780609 2016-11-02 03:26:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @Steve_Perrault Extra-inning rain delay.
794014873776594944 2016-11-02 03:14:32 UTC <bosdcla14> The decision to pitch Chapman so much last night in a blowout is looking interesting right now.
794003097257394180 2016-11-02 02:27:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe And it seemed like a frustration foul by Bradley.
793999570233479168 2016-11-02 02:13:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Not sure why we're seeing so much Zeller when Amir is playing so well.
793934928568205312 2016-11-02 21:56:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn @merkin_muffly Keep in mind this includes every voter who is 18-21, since none of them could vote in 2012, and they favor HRC.
793923179613851648 2016-11-02 21:10:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @haralabob @PtooE The settlement includes dismissal of the appeal.
793922047323668480 2016-11-02 21:05:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @RalstonReports Desire to avoid death threats from Trumpers who don't understand purpose of oversampling?
793921299835850753 2016-11-02 21:02:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNN @RalstonReports Are you joking?  CNN lives Trump.  Corey comments at CNN while also getting paid by Trump.
793920864433541120 2016-11-02 21:00:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnJHarwood @sbprice How?
793619201873195008 2016-11-01 01:02:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @MichaelRCaputo @Fahrenthold Caputo's already weighed in w/ his viewpoint: you're reporting facts, and thus carrying water for Hillary.
793225382665216000 2016-10-31 22:57:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @wilw @Scott_Gilmore @Slate Best detail: they took down server when reporters asked about it; them set it up again with a new name.
792105383942729729 2016-10-28 20:46:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkHalperin False. Comey's initial statement should have been confined to no charges. Rest was inappropriate GOP partisan editorializing.
791797933876342784 2016-10-27 00:25:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie To be fair, the defense is also not so hot.
791456426627518466 2016-10-26 01:48:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @csnts33 Seriously. Lets Rozier get trapped a 2nd time in the backcourt and the hoists a shot as soon as he touches the ball.
791447173103628288 2016-10-26 01:11:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse Voting is how you endorse. "I don't support this law but I will vote for it" is moronic & so is this.
791380473926651904 2016-10-26 20:46:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @daveweigel @ElinaBeauchamp You realize the letter you attached says it's not a Marketplace plan right?
791114618282254336 2016-10-25 03:09:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly @DanScavino Will she also be imprisoned without being charged with or convicted of anything?
791095582374756352 2016-10-25 01:54:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @KFILE @StormForce_1 Conspiracy just means multiple people involved. Did you mean to say conspiracy theory or do you think Hillary is Rambo?
791089374712647680 2016-10-25 01:29:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @jaketapper Ryan would never try that, but if he did, both Trump and Biden would probably start punching him.
791074570035789825 2016-10-25 00:30:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @brithume @richdoll54 @ppppolls @thebotanicalga1 Oh is this a fun fake invoice thread?  Sweet.pic.twitter.com/anOeIRTyPk
790978387137273856 2016-10-25 18:08:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Would Fox accept the ad?
790722019356585984 2016-10-24 01:09:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @GideonResnick @kenkircher1 One list.  Doesn't have insurance fraud/foreign donation stuff, too old. http://www.pajiba.com/politics/a-complete-list-of-all-the-times-donald-trump-has-broken-the-law.php
790720421049937921 2016-10-24 01:03:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @GideonResnick Mitt's ultimate AZ margin was 212,382, so while this is interesting, Dems have a long way to go to make a real play for AZ.
790718422850019328 2016-10-24 00:55:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @AppFlyer @BmoreBirds88 Ah, you're under the impression that what got Obama elected was "intensity of feeling" not "more votes." Neat!
790713387122470912 2016-10-24 00:35:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @ComfortablySmug @AppFlyer @BmoreBirds88 Yes, Obama spent more $ on organizing than McCain/Mitt & all he has to show for it is beating both.
790688647750164480 2016-10-24 22:57:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray @j4mesdub Neither was the swastika. Pepe wasn't originally alt-right. Things can acquire affiliation.
790667782895448065 2016-10-24 21:34:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @ajjaffe @onlxn @ChrisJansing Maybe @mitchellvii can explain to this guy that he should put up a Trump lawn sign in his heart.
790633684848082944 2016-10-24 19:18:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @TyroneHabbo @ppppolls @fenwaygreg Seems new. 2012 the argument was that the polls were skewed; now it's that they're push-polls or made up.
790599330512064520 2016-10-24 17:02:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @BorisEP @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Wait, @HicksNoComment didn't respond?  You don't say.
790406404381126656 2016-10-23 04:15:46 UTC <bosdcla14> This makes as much sense as anything else in what was a truly terrible NFL game.https://twitter.com/blakegriffin32/status/790406089682526208
790320975673909248 2016-10-23 22:36:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @JimTurn30433019 Stormfront etc are all hotbeds of Trump support. In short, actual Nazis and racial supremacists support Trump.
790294942752972800 2016-10-23 20:52:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @gossamer71 I want to understand the mindset of someone who chooses to spend time losing an argument w/ someone they think is 14. Why do it?
790287939058012160 2016-10-23 20:25:02 UTC <bosdcla14> I suppose the comment section does not tend to show humanity at its best.
790285433343127552 2016-10-23 20:15:04 UTC <bosdcla14> I get your viewpoint.  But your article was hyper-generous to alt-right & the main reaction was death/forced aliyah threats.
790281975084875776 2016-10-23 20:01:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray @gossamer71 I give a fuck b/c I oppose Nazism---your deleted cmt section shows persuasion not possible.
790280846431301632 2016-10-23 19:56:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray @gossamer71 Trumpers cite Hitler as a model, even in this thread.  https://twitter.com/ChibaTm/status/790274628736344064
790279059162877952 2016-10-23 19:49:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Wait, political staffers try to shape public perception of their boss?  You don't say. Next up: staffers discuss lunch options.
790257808771944448 2016-10-23 18:25:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray @gossamer71 Age had nothing to do with hating Nazis and those who endorse their rhetoric and goals.
790222735783845888 2016-10-23 16:05:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce @jbarro If these guys were told they were eligible let them keep the bonus even if the eligibility determination was wrong.
790061994149761024 2016-10-22 05:27:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @rahumphreys1 @jewrightwing @RosieGray @Bencjacobs Search for hashtag ovenworthy. Say hello to your fellow travelers.
790053059854348288 2016-10-22 04:51:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight He had a really good postseason & the Dodgers scored zero runs tonight.  I guess he was supposed to throw a shutout & homer?
790027057979764736 2016-10-22 03:08:23 UTC <bosdcla14> This feels wrong but I looked it up and it's true.https://twitter.com/natesilver538/status/790026426653282308
790020261101785089 2016-10-22 02:41:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray They didn't shoot you an email saying "hey we gotta delete this b/c of all the RW murder threats"?
790018349644132352 2016-10-22 02:33:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray You not only closed, you deleted the thread, I now see.  If it was NBD, why delete the thread?
790016829255147520 2016-10-22 02:27:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray "One guy". Right. That's why you had to close comments on your piece abt being alt-right. All one guy.
790010324984274944 2016-10-22 02:01:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @MuttBarkley @RosieGray "I refuse to consider the overwheming  evidence refuting my claims, therefore I win". Sad!
790008222094503937 2016-10-22 01:53:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @dcexaminer @brithume I remember when Brit was denying all the allegations against Ailes. Until Gretchen had tapes.  Oops.
790007931211096065 2016-10-22 01:52:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @RosieGray @MuttBarkley I know. Typical Trumper. 100,000 pieces of evidence, find one you can spin, ignore the rest. Thanks for confirming.
790005473424527360 2016-10-22 01:42:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @RosieGray @MuttBarkley Read pro Trump Reddit or Twitter. Same stuff. Broad approval among Trumpers. That's what the alt-right is.
790003317061488640 2016-10-22 01:34:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @RosieGray @MuttBarkley Did you not read your link? Describes protestors drawing negative reaction from crowd.  Not the typical Trump Nazis.
790002138193600512 2016-10-22 01:29:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @RosieGray @MuttBarkley Right. Read the rest of the thread where your Trumper compatriots defend the Nzai-inspired comments. Vile.
790001661913632768 2016-10-22 01:27:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @RosieGray Most Americans see Nazis as evil, not as a inspiring model for behavior like these Trumpers do.
789953581562507264 2016-10-22 22:16:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @awb @rejialex7 God, you're still way off. I'd ask what its like to be so stupid, but I doubt you could put it into words.  Enjoy the jazz.
789949010735878144 2016-10-22 21:58:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @awb @rejialex7 They banned campaign signs at the rally?  Or nobody remembered to bring any?  
789937836308901888 2016-10-22 21:13:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @LA_Banker @latimes "I am worth many billions of dollars" could also be the start of a Nigerian scam email.
789924995212324864 2016-10-22 20:22:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @ThreeGunsXp So you're OK with polling more Dems, you just want it correspond to those percentages exactly?
789923709444198400 2016-10-22 20:17:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @ThreeGunsXp Are you under the impression that the number of Dems and GOPers in the country and in every state is exactly even?
789355876763086849 2016-10-20 06:41:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @RachelGurvich It also is what local officials trying to obstruct democracy looks like. It shouldn't be such an imposition 2 be able 2 vote.
789287521771409408 2016-10-20 02:09:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @drksportsnews Not the leg arm!
789188382488350728 2016-10-20 19:35:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @RameshPonnuru @rkarpel @baseballcrank multiple suits. Bush filed first to stop the count on Nov 11, 16 days before Gore.
789169154385338368 2016-10-20 18:19:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @KenTremendous @AindiK I'd be OK w that comment. Saying we might not know results on Nov 8 is different than saying I might not accept them.
789168576129183747 2016-10-20 18:17:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @AindiK @KenTremendous @aindik "Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the Court's decision, I accept it." Gore 2000 concession.
789144375427084288 2016-10-20 16:40:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @Harlan @Timodc @oliverdarcy Harlan is from the UK and was a LibDem. Has never worked for an American Democratic campaign.
788958117581033472 2016-10-19 04:20:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbridis @gooseycheeks http://www.sptimes.com/News/121000/Election2000/Overruled_.shtml Recount automatic; Gore wanted particular procedure; Bush sued to stop & won in USSC.
788957678596796417 2016-10-19 04:19:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbridis @dapremonster @HoosIrish Recount was automatic, Gore argued for hand-count, Bush sued to stop count & won (other steps as well).
788945228103159808 2016-10-19 03:29:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbridis @dimplasm @DaphneDoGood1 Moveon started by calling 4 censure of POTUS Bill Clinton rather than impeachment. "Censure and Move on"
788936310148870144 2016-10-19 02:54:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @tbridis People arguing Gore didn't accept the outcome---actually, Bush sued to stop the vote count.  He was the Plaintiff.  Bush v. Gore.
788933337658175488 2016-10-19 02:42:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @readDanwrite Well, he forced a kiss on a young girl who didn't want one to prove he doesn't do that either, so consistent at least.
788930908082483200 2016-10-19 02:32:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @FrankLuntz @TheresaPhilips His wife said 2 days ago that he apologized to her, and he just said on stage that he never did.  Vicious.
788925150368411648 2016-10-19 02:09:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum Repeatedly investigated by hostile/adverse investigators, never charged with anything.
788910610473820162 2016-10-19 01:12:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @igorvolsky Well, Trump wanted to expand Stop & Frisk, which allows police to seize guns without warrants.  That's sort of a challenge.
788902587202363394 2016-10-19 00:40:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah @AlkireMike Bill Clinton is toast because the 22nd amendment limits Presidents to 2 terms. Can't argue with that!
788897607468748801 2016-10-19 00:20:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheJimHughes @stuartpstevens @non1amato Is that a defense of the invite or an additional criticism of it?
788862534556135424 2016-10-19 22:00:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @alexburnsNYT Well Bannon does get Seinfeld royalties, maybe he thought it was a good finale?
788810547198210048 2016-10-19 18:34:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @petridishes @erinfenner Separate the "off" part into its own word and I think you'll get it.
788789167186518016 2016-10-19 17:09:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight @Olivianuzzi I think Pierson would say the question mark means she's not making a statement she's asking a question.
788474217117261824 2016-10-18 20:17:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC @pmattiefl Maybe he'll play a classic like Louisiana delegate allocation grievances?
788446060666499073 2016-10-18 18:26:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @UHouston @kylegriffin1 Obama got 41% in TX so it's not that HRC is outperforming him. Ppl don't like her or DJT and are struggling 2 decide
788221448678625280 2016-10-17 03:33:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABC Why is this a negative story?  Its what Trump said.  Most pols would kill to get reporters to just print what they say.
788130191100944384 2016-10-17 21:30:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @DailyCaller Can he resign and be replaced with a weather vane?  Save some money and it would do the same stuff in a less annoying way.
788128865239445504 2016-10-17 21:25:38 UTC <bosdcla14> David Ortiz is even more awesome than I thought.https://twitter.com/desnewssports/status/787866317474848768
788127458843172864 2016-10-17 21:20:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @adonsports @desnewssports David Ortiz was a tremendous baseball player and still is a tremendous person.  Great article.

787320226085871616 2016-10-15 15:52:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls Dream the impossible dream. You should pin this tweet.
787114186618736640 2016-10-14 02:13:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @barryap1 @BecketAdams @Dick_Beninya The old meaning of bias is "prejudice in favor or against" something.  What's the new meaning?
787092651069677568 2016-10-14 00:48:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME I believe him.  He really is a dim bulb.  I think he has written instructions on how to put on pants that his wife reads to him.
787081048253358080 2016-10-14 00:01:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @VampireLestat "I have accidentally confirmed we were seated next to each other on a flight."
786786747963232256 2016-10-13 04:32:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid @highserenity49 Never heard of privacy while on mic but ok, if he speaks publicly he's lying. Good clarification.
786783554822819840 2016-10-13 04:19:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @NYDailyNews @JoyAnnReid Well he was telling the truth when he said he assaults women.
786775442061598720 2016-10-13 03:47:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @Marlins_Man @ithrow88 How else is he going to be able to post picture proof of how humble he is?
786706666859311104 2016-10-13 23:14:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @chrislhayes Doesn't it pre-date Bannon?  I think he convinced himself. He has one of the best brains, just ask him.
786417783512834049 2016-10-12 04:06:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @MSNBC NO ONE should vote for Bill Clinton this year.  It is unconstitutional to serve 3 terms!  NOT OK!
786417392804962304 2016-10-12 04:04:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @MSNBC I'm watching.  Its he said-she said.  Well, except there's 11 women...and of course he said it as well..but yeah.
786416322406027264 2016-10-12 04:00:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @MSNBC Which ones?  There's so many women saying he did to them what he said he did I'm having trouble keeping up.
786414727601672192 2016-10-12 03:54:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Second Trumper I've seen argue this.  Like saying a purse-snatcher had consent if the woman doesn't chase after him.
786407585364652032 2016-10-12 03:25:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @allahpundit NYT, Palm Beach Post, People, NYDN, the Today Show.  Also, why not the WaPo while he's at it?
786407277427208196 2016-10-12 03:24:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald In all seriousness, I think I might be more surprised by this than anything else I've heard today.
786394294256939008 2016-10-12 02:33:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @mega2e @Women4Trump @Robotbeat To be fair, Trump saying he let GOP shackle him&he's only free now b/c they dumped him is also pretty beta.
786393137354715138 2016-10-12 02:28:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports @MichelleFields @Graemeb11 So you choose to do things you don't care about or enjoy in your free time?  Why?
786391368197246978 2016-10-12 02:21:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports @MichelleFields @Graemeb11 God, I love when people make this comment.  Its the best.  As always "you care, you replied."
786390029421555712 2016-10-12 02:16:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @speechboy71 He's already said he wants to expand defamation law (to include quoting him unfavorably) and to be able to veto media stories.
786367495682654208 2016-10-12 00:46:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @AFP What about if they just play the tape of DJT saying it happened?
786367248331976705 2016-10-12 00:45:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes @NatashaBertrand @BenjySarlin @OBryDavid07 She also signed an affidavit saying the claims were untrue during the Jones suit.
786356054158286849 2016-10-12 00:01:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @RiverfrontTimes @DLoesch Maybe a bit, but I think it's more a cry for relief from the vileness of this campaign.
786350426346053632 2016-10-12 23:38:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @krystalball Ms. Leeds also told 4 friends at the time, who confirmed that to the NYT.
786349182697156608 2016-10-12 23:33:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @allahpundit @TheRickWilson @ChuckxJ Ms. Leeds had told 4 friends at the time, who confirmed to the NYT that they were told at the time.
786348345539166208 2016-10-12 23:30:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Leeds also has 4 friends confirm that she told them about the assault previously.
786253920423280642 2016-10-12 17:15:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @MonmouthPoll I always like seeing ACORN on these lists. Zombie fiction stories are so hot right now.
786056645482807300 2016-10-11 04:11:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @MeghanMcCain @FoxNews If Hillary had killed that fly on her face, she would be subject to multiple Congressional investigations.
786027463272902656 2016-10-11 02:15:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald @Adorably_Nerdy @melimel521 No, they simply quote his words & point out their falsity. You don't need to "decode" plain English.
786026590383640577 2016-10-11 02:11:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald @melimel521 @Adorably_Nerdy It is amazing to say you can 'decode' a candidate & mean it positively for yourself & the candidate.
785992242808758273 2016-10-11 23:55:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro This makes me happy but also sad, as I would like there to be some GOPers who seem like reasonable ppl I disagree w/ on some issues.
785946770576596994 2016-10-11 20:54:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Sometimes NFL head coaches hand over play calling to someone else. Maybe Farrell can hand over in game decision making?
785862553310199808 2016-10-11 15:20:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @rcole43 @DaveePena That's a good picture though. I hadn't seen that one and appreciate it when the players give a shit.
785861726164123648 2016-10-11 15:16:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @rcole43 @DaveePena I'll always be grateful to Tito for 2004 and 2007 and have an affinity for CLE.  I'm rooting for them against the Jays.
785856338257641473 2016-10-11 14:55:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan Is the problem that you're weak, ineffective and disloyal like Trump says?
785855116184346624 2016-10-11 14:50:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @DaveePena @rcole43 When ppl who brag abt sex assault declare their desire to rape America, it disturbs me.  Guess it excites you?
785696705169588224 2016-10-10 04:21:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @DaveePena @rcole43 "You'll be in jail" was what he said. That's a pledge. Why edit it to the less absurd section?
785691969926275073 2016-10-10 04:02:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @DaveePena @rcole43 Anyone who declares their dictatorial dreams I take at their word.  Pretend HRC said this and apply same standards.
785690424971100162 2016-10-10 03:56:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianefallon Can start with this one. http://www.newsweek.com/vladimir-putin-sidney-blumenthal-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-benghazi-sputnik-508635
785678991688466432 2016-10-10 03:10:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianefallon You guys need stronger pushback on specifics.  MSM takes "we're not going thru email by email" as non-denial.  Point out lies.

785664948764454913 2016-10-10 02:14:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @JMastrodonato I thought I had braced myself for how dumb this reasoning would be, but it was done to KEEP ANDREW MILLER IN THE GAME?!?!?!?
785659632186339328 2016-10-10 01:53:47 UTC <bosdcla14> What a career.  It was truly a privilege and a pleasure to watch.https://twitter.com/jcmccaffrey/status/785659372227530757
785655609265979392 2016-10-10 01:37:48 UTC <bosdcla14> Definitely. I think there's a strong argument he's the most important Sox hitter ever.https://twitter.com/billsimmons/status/785655247163097089
785646732122005504 2016-10-10 01:02:32 UTC <bosdcla14> It should be a thing. Benny had a double in his last AB, JBJ is 0 for his last 19. Maybe let someone else make in-game decisions.https://twitter.com/overthemonster/status/785645973343121409

785637025097449472 2016-10-10 00:23:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @stevebruskCNN @petergene Three possibilities 1. Incompetence 2. To spite media 3. Aid media bias narrative.  Not mutually exclusive.
785636367908818944 2016-10-10 00:21:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @sallykohn Well, if the rest of the planet is outside the stadium & DJT didn't say they were waiting to come into the rally, then...
785634954910720000 2016-10-10 00:15:44 UTC <bosdcla14> Top of the 9th will be Offerman-Renteria-Lugo.https://twitter.com/BillSimmons/status/785634633446625280
785634389187145728 2016-10-10 00:13:29 UTC <bosdcla14> Knowing Farrell, he probably still likes the matchup.  Thinks Pom-Pom had great stuff out there, tough to get power hitters like Coco out.https://twitter.com/TimBritton/status/785633914161401856
785627537963569152 2016-10-10 23:46:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Carson or Christie?
785614520035049473 2016-10-10 22:54:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @TimBritton I would agree and this is a good observation but I do not like it.
785605159120285699 2016-10-10 22:17:20 UTC <bosdcla14> Not ideal.https://twitter.com/timbritton/status/785603615419424768
785604719573995520 2016-10-10 22:15:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @AriMelber @Hashtag_New_Fad @DaveePena So he will try dictatorial actions but he will be stopped by brave statesmen like Paul Ryan? Right...
785599804030144512 2016-10-10 21:56:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @SethMacFarlane @AriMelber @Hashtag_New_Fad @DaveePena He said she'd be in jail. Prosecutor would only be 4 show, sentence is set. Dictator.
785598744423051264 2016-10-10 21:51:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias I hear she also tried to convince people they should vote for her and not for him.
785484247280738304 2016-10-10 14:16:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicususa @PoliticusSarah @DoustouDennis The President directing jailing of political opponents is dictatorial. No free nation does it.
785482366680649728 2016-10-10 14:09:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoeNBC @Morning_Joe @MSNBC Saying you're going to jail your political opponent is the hallmark of a dictator.  Auto-loss.
785378803950362624 2016-10-10 07:17:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs Probably only encourages them to point it out.
785378120312377345 2016-10-10 07:15:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @simonhedlin @jeandiata Not tried. In jail. No court, no charges, no proof, just an SP with a predetermined outcome & sentence. Dictator.
785345479798251522 2016-10-09 05:05:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @hrhjmm Bye Trumper.  I hope America stays free despite your best efforts to impose a dictator upon our great nation.
785345272947679232 2016-10-09 05:04:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @RightlyStubborn So if 3 GOP-led investigations aren't enough, what's the limit?  If a jury finds not guilty, do you toss double jeopardy?
785345001144266754 2016-10-09 05:03:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @hrhjmm So if a 4th GOP-led inquiry also says no charges, time 4 a 5th. If a jury finds not guilty, new trial.  Etc.
785344518673408000 2016-10-09 05:01:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @hrhjmm Exactly, the 'point' is HRC will be jailed & DJT will see to it that she winds up there, Constitution be damned.
785342838015864832 2016-10-09 04:54:58 UTC <bosdcla14> Sometimes the strongest thing you can do is be willing to get called weak.  So many Dems went 4 Iraq b/c scared of criticism..
785342545903489024 2016-10-09 04:53:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @hrhjmm So, if someone's your political opponent, you think you  should be able to jail them w/o a criminal conviction 1st?
785342090309840897 2016-10-09 04:51:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @RightlyStubborn You think she should go to prison after being convicted of a crime, or just on the whim/belief of a single person?
785340684106555392 2016-10-09 04:46:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @hrhjmm The Pres saying he's going to pick individuals to jail is a hallmark of a dictatorship.  No free nation does that.
785339458233131008 2016-10-09 04:41:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @GroverNorquist I feel like the vaping thing has become like that joke that was only sort of funny 1st time, but by 50th time is very funny.
785339013754257408 2016-10-09 04:39:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes I think Iraq and Libya showed us that a policy of "let's keep Americans from getting killed there" is sometimes best we can do.
785333653853184000 2016-10-09 04:18:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @RightlyStubborn @RadioFreeTomShe should just be subject to same law as everyone else.  Multiple GOP-led investigations & no charges.
785332634742173696 2016-10-09 04:14:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @RightlyStubborn Vowing to jail political opponents as President is done in a dictatorship. No free nation behaves that way.
785331267453595648 2016-10-09 04:08:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @Green_Footballs "Constitutional conservatives" who think that POTUS should direct the jailing of political opponents must be a neat group.
785328261039398913 2016-10-09 03:57:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum He likes the wrong ones.  They sound stronger, and feel better to say, and draw a bigger reaction from his crowds.
785326982955278336 2016-10-09 03:51:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @willwilkinson @KeepItRealist We know Hillary won't be convicted even in GOP-led investigations: Issa, Gowdy, Comey.
785326467953549312 2016-10-09 03:49:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @JustinWolfers @willwilkinson @JoeHacker4 @OFWHAP Only in dictatorships does the President single out people he'd imprison.
785322785677553664 2016-10-09 03:35:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @Heminator No, he said "you'd be in jail." IE, the SP would be just for show, the outcome would be pre-determined regardless of facts/law.
785322529313296387 2016-10-09 03:34:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @DonaldJTrumpJr @charliekirk11 Only in dictatorships does the Pres personally direct jailing of political opponents.  GOP goal.
785321263963090944 2016-10-09 03:29:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @DanaPerino Only in a dictatorship does the Pres personally direct the jailing of an individual, but he meant to do it, check your comments.
785318757056905216 2016-10-09 03:19:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @danpfeiffer And was a sniffling mess who was nearly incomprehensible.
785293705041223680 2016-10-09 01:39:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @seanspicer Did she sexually assault women like your candidate bragged he did?
785283224394092544 2016-10-09 00:58:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd Well, if his goal is to build a base of support for a future Trump TV network, I'd say its fairly smart.
785259184744824832 2016-10-09 23:22:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @KirstenPowers @jbarro @DEBussone This is a pinnable exchange.
785222930707775488 2016-10-09 20:58:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @MeetThePress @AMCE001 No, it's not. Large majority of Latinos support Democrats.  No need to tell vicious lies to try to hide this fact.
785201636666847232 2016-10-09 19:33:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @mitchellvii Which is why Dem Elliot Spitzer was able to stay in office while GOPer David Vitter had to resign for the same thing. Oh wait.
785199278994038785 2016-10-09 19:24:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots So great of you to post this.
785174335724019712 2016-10-09 17:45:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @JakeSherman They absolutely deserve everything that happens to them and more.  They knew he was a snake when they endorsed him.
785169761369858048 2016-10-09 17:27:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @tedcruz Burnett big in Christian films, didn't want to release tape b/c it would hurt him w/ right, got NBC to go along.
785146843000823808 2016-10-09 15:56:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh @gdebenedetti "Haven't thought it thru" is a good description of the Republican Party as an entity.
784931813185560576 2016-10-08 01:41:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @mike_pence @senrobportman @frankthorp "Instead I will vote for DJT's VP choice, who falsely denied DJT's previous comments at the debate."
784881500785287168 2016-10-08 22:21:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes Nope. Let's agree: no one should vote for WJC or DJT, and no one should blame Melania or Hillary for hubby's actions.
784862591034068992 2016-10-08 21:06:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @Deadspin McCain's previous statement didn't mention dropping support.  So he'd have stood by DJT if others did. What a shell of a man.
784848577302372352 2016-10-08 20:10:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence @MajorCBS He knew what he was getting into. He should just pretend Trump never said it, like at the debate.
784840580132057088 2016-10-08 19:39:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn Its amazing Kellyanne Conway worked for both Akin and Trump.  #ConwayCurse

784836071284617216 2016-10-08 19:21:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @CoryGardner Everyone knew this is who Trump was before this, and you tried to inflict him on America.  Just admit you're a POS and own it.
784816363604803584 2016-10-08 18:02:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker Give me a break. Kaine cited so many comments by Trump that Pence denied were made.  His only issue is he can't deny this one.
784815328144470016 2016-10-08 17:58:50 UTC <bosdcla14> Democrats should drape Kasich's "Nothing about this is surprising" statement around every Republican's shoulders.  Ppl knew who DJT was.https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/784809448296644609
784807875692535808 2016-10-08 17:29:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @hughhewitt @chriscesq Pence is DJT w/ better hair. DJT's pick and lied abt prev comments.
784800393922359296 2016-10-08 16:59:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenJohnThune Pence- the choice of Donald Trump, and a man willing to lie about Trump's words.  In other words, Trump w/ better hair.
784656482050551808 2016-10-08 07:27:38 UTC <bosdcla14> Yeah they just shot on the base and expect votes anyway.
784644532956606467 2016-10-07 06:40:09 UTC <bosdcla14> Quasi-apology is full of falsehoods.https://twitter.com/freddiecampion/status/784633426636865537
784622940360957952 2016-10-07 05:14:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 I'm good.  Hopefully you won't vote for someone who admits sexual assault, and you will learn to write in English.
784622414546268164 2016-10-07 05:12:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 *they're* *losing* *courtroom* Yes, the ability to write in English does help me in law.  Have you considered learning English?
784620086967603200 2016-10-07 05:03:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Losing.
784620026078826496 2016-10-07 05:02:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 I think the real issue is that fact that someone who can't tell cats from dogs probably should change their avatar.
784619886395985921 2016-10-07 05:02:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 What are you talking about?  You didn't know she had a cat until I told you.  And you haven't apologized to the cat.  Shame.
784618723478999041 2016-10-07 04:57:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 I assume some combination of Socks the Immortal + Hillary's Body Double the Killer Govt Robot + Jade Helm mercs + FEMA?
784617290897719297 2016-10-07 04:51:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Knew.  Honestly, its like shooting fish in a barrel.  Or I supposed you'd call them manatees?
784616925926219777 2016-10-07 04:50:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Knew.
784616882410229760 2016-10-07 04:50:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Good for you!  People that can't tell animals apart or use the English language could feel bad for themselves---not you!
784616538351566848 2016-10-07 04:48:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 "our you"?  You meant "are you" didn't you?  WOW.  Can't tell cats from dogs, can't write in English...thoughts and prayers.
784614618262073345 2016-10-07 04:41:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @mcuban A joke, I know, but thankfully they got rid of this loophole in 2002 (w/ HRC voting to eliminate it).
784611678877024257 2016-10-07 04:29:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 You sound like someone who can't tell the difference b/w a cat and a dog, or can and lies about it for some weird reason.
784611285317066755 2016-10-07 04:28:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Like I said, cat, how can I trust you on that?  You lied to me about an early and simple fact.  And you haven't apologized!
784609577421639680 2016-10-07 04:21:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkSchofield No, they're reading about a guy less successful with his passes.
784604770304679937 2016-10-07 04:02:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @onlxn I'm on the edge of my seat to see how this story arc plays out.  Twitter is so weird and great.
784598881501872129 2016-10-07 03:38:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes Well, laughing so hard you piss yourself is a KIND of crisis.
784593662210633729 2016-10-07 03:18:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 Plus you have a cat as your avatar!  Makes it all the more disappointing.  Deliberate deception or carelessness, can't have it!
784593226648911872 2016-10-07 03:16:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 But if I can't trust you to know cats from dogs, why would I trust your other claims or videos?
784591561241796612 2016-10-07 03:09:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefix @TheRickWilson @alfonslopeztena I feel like they're more "Franz von Papen" Republicans..."we can control him, we can box him in..."
784591175080615936 2016-10-07 03:08:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 How can I possibly trust you about cause of death when you can't tell dogs from cats?
784590595151032324 2016-10-07 03:05:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Can't believe you lied to me about the type of animal.  My trust in you is gone.
784588040052305920 2016-10-07 02:55:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @MagentaCat1 If you want to claim credit for a bunch of kills, just do it, and stop beating around the bush.  Or grabbing around the pussy.
784587454363951104 2016-10-07 02:53:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Kathleen Wiley says Bullseye was a cat.  Do you think she's part of the conspiracy now?
784586306458353664 2016-10-07 02:48:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Or is Hillary one of those government robots that DJT advisor Alex Jones mentions re Sandy Hook?
784585643682852866 2016-10-07 02:46:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Oh god, by speaking to the true nature of Socks' identity, have I made myself a target?
784585089241997312 2016-10-07 02:43:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Oooh, or Socks?  Is Socks the cat an immortal serial killer?
784584955045314564 2016-10-07 02:43:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 I assume Chelsea?
784583321967792128 2016-10-07 02:36:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Once again, you seem confused about who is on the ballot...should I send you a list?
784582955389882369 2016-10-07 02:35:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @RobEngstrom @DonderolibtR Actually, Paul Ryan reminds me of von Papen.  "I can work with Trump, I can box him in..."
784582374550102016 2016-10-07 02:33:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 I disagree, but you understand that Howard Stern is not running for President, yes?
784581661061181441 2016-10-07 02:30:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 You're confusing him with Trump again.  And its Epstein.  https://www.scribd.com/doc/316341058/Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-Rape-Lawsuit-and-Affidavits
784579564701876224 2016-10-07 02:21:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @haralabob I've yet to see anyone lob the weird "obsessed" comment who is not a DJT supporter who's currently trying to hide it.
784577755941892096 2016-10-07 02:14:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @igorvolsky And, at this point, shouldn't Hannity have a good understanding of what its like to defend a rapist for your job?
784577432175116290 2016-10-07 02:13:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 So he's so desperate to impress Billy Bush, he'll make up fake sexual assaults?  There's a winner.
784576880322179072 2016-10-07 02:11:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 That's not true.  Ivana said she didn't want her words take criminally, but not that they were lies.
784576002819235840 2016-10-07 02:07:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @sppeoples Luckily, Pence then determined that Trump never said those comments, and it was all good yo.
784573065812385792 2016-10-07 01:56:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @ErinBurnett @OutFrontCNN @MagentaCat1 Trump had 2 sworn rape charges against him b4 he ran 4 anything&has confirmed committing sex assault.
784570277183287296 2016-10-07 01:45:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @tedcruz "Despite that, go vote for the guy who brags about using his position of fame and power to commit penetrative sexual assault."
784555004275417088 2016-10-07 00:44:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnJHarwood "We must move on from the man who grabs women by the pussy to a man who grabs women by the uterus and never lets go."
784552746783477760 2016-10-07 00:35:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuckinBoston Gonna lay the smack down in Spring Training, I guess.
784551131028549632 2016-10-07 00:29:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnKasich Good for you for sticking with your principles, unlike the sad guy on the phone.
784545771039420417 2016-10-07 00:07:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticusSarah "Her America-hating bias towards people that hate America today" is some quality work, you attract a high class of troll.
784545407942754304 2016-10-07 00:06:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes DJT, not WJC, is running 4 POTUS, had 2 sworn rape claims agnst him B4 he ran&bragged abt penetrative sexual assault.
784533434031013888 2016-10-07 23:18:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheBrodyFile David, is this your way of telling us you used your fame to commit penetrative sexual assaults and bragged about it?
784532558537252864 2016-10-07 23:15:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @oreillyfactor Where he talks about using his position and fame to subject women to penetrative sexual assault.
784447339125628928 2016-10-07 17:36:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @SirKennyPoo @egericson There were 9 federal agencies that negotiated/signed off on the deal.
784255069839515648 2016-10-06 04:52:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @Wooflepup CA passed laws 4 free range chickens & no foie gras, overturned by Congress and fed Cy respectively.
784253230679150592 2016-10-06 04:45:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @Wooflepup Low population states already have wildly disproportionate influence on policy due to the Senate.
784201031605293056 2016-10-06 01:17:50 UTC <bosdcla14> This seems problematic.https://twitter.com/alexspeier/status/784200095873064960
784194182109724672 2016-10-06 00:50:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @Howl131 I'll agree with you that these are great looking dogs.  Probably the only thing we agree on!  Have a good one.
784189771497082880 2016-10-06 00:33:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn @whatgreatstuff Also had a stirring discussion on the possibility of Holt doing a sac bunt.  In the first inning.
784187656565436417 2016-10-06 00:24:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis @RustyRoyas Yeah, I'm not hating that particular call.
784187056410853377 2016-10-06 00:22:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Hasn't Holt made an insane number of outs on the basepaths?  I think the Sox think he's faster than he actually is.
784185632276885504 2016-10-06 00:16:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @DRUDGE I suppose they could stay in their homes to prove climate change is a hoax.
784120060189093888 2016-10-06 19:56:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @mcuban @markos @Newsweek But got an accountant who was able to use the tax code to let him steal home from American taxpayers.
784118693378666496 2016-10-06 19:50:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @GadiNBC @markos Is this thread a 50-50 split of DJT supporters saying this dude is a plant and DJT supporters agreeing with him?
783935262535458816 2016-10-06 07:41:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @Howl131 @VampireLestat It truly is amazing that the GOP contenders didn't try to use stuff like that to beat him.
783930342352654336 2016-10-06 07:22:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @VampireLestat @Howl131 I do enjoy it. I also think your dog looks friendly.  But if your kids are struggling, maybe unretire?
783928095128510464 2016-10-06 07:13:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson @VampireLestat @Howl131 Man you must have really hated Bush then, since unemployment was way higher when he left office.
783927887208427520 2016-10-06 07:12:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @VampireLestat @Howl131 I really liked the deplorables comment. I think the national socialists backing Trump are pretty deplorable indeed.
783901743474028544 2016-10-05 05:28:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @VampireLestat I know, I should resist but I find it amusing to poke the trolls.
783901003464585217 2016-10-05 05:25:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson @VampireLestat @Howl131 I ask b/c you said U recalled when U "hoped" to be which I found weird coming from a young retiree.
783824254227800064 2016-10-05 00:20:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @wesleynyc @barefoot_prof You should be able to get an abortion on yourself if you want.  Not sure how that would work, but live your dream.
783781253128392704 2016-10-05 21:29:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @viccarucci @NickVeronica @therealrob83 Went to the link you cited. Real data there: 3005 white victims, 2509 killed by whites.  Why lie?
783683167278411776 2016-10-05 15:00:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @AlanMCole Yes, it's like saying some foods are good for you and others are not, or some people are smart and others less so. 
783539350751604736 2016-10-04 05:28:33 UTC <bosdcla14> Too funny.https://twitter.com/dame_lillard/status/783530057419595776

783505567117484032 2016-10-04 03:14:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro They lost to Trump.
783500329778188288 2016-10-04 02:53:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @timkaine @mike_pence @cspan I suppose it wouldn't be professional to quote Blazing Saddles in response.  'Scuse me while I whip this out...
783499610400579584 2016-10-04 02:50:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump Good for you!  Thought you'd be mad at his going rogue, refusing to defend you, and instead setting up a 2020 Pence run.
783485288836243456 2016-10-04 01:53:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @timkaine @MegKinnardAP Has DJT ever praised a foreign leader who was elected in a free & fair election, or just dictators?
783476547550261249 2016-10-04 01:18:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd @wedge615 He once claimed that an Iraqi market w/ hundreds of troops providing security was the same as markets in Indiana.
783469920465985537 2016-10-04 00:52:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicususa @PoliticusSarah You say "mistakenly" but what makes you think that the GOP recognizes as fact that time is linear?
783109156257402880 2016-10-03 00:59:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid One possible exception: I think more Dems would defect in face of DJT-like nom for Dems (Kanye? Sarandon?) than Rs did for DJT.
783106850182995969 2016-10-03 00:49:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum Well, that critique only makes sense if the Trump people cared one iota about accuracy or even internal consistency of lies.
783072335695794176 2016-10-03 22:32:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @mequantum He won a Congressional vote on it, with 10 Dem senators and 86 House Dems voting in favor.

783059406904709120 2016-10-03 21:41:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC "This Trump claim is baseless" is an evergreen tweet.
782695171729174529 2016-10-02 21:34:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattpep15 @BenVolin @pooppooperson19 Speculation, but I think Goodell dislikes Pats being the only team that's always good in parity era.
782693712656642049 2016-10-02 21:28:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattpep15 @BenVolin @pooppooperson19 The previous discipline meted out for equipment tampering was a 20k fine. Pats lost a 1st and Brady.
782688102758256640 2016-10-02 21:05:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianmacp Also why moving him to lead off was a good move.
782687897518379008 2016-10-02 21:05:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @BenVolin @mattpep15 If Belichick said he had sources on other team Pats would lose draft picks for 5 years.
782652800576593920 2016-10-02 18:45:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots Missing the days when he was automatic.  That 39 yard game sealer against Miami that he missed and now this one.
782634333567725569 2016-10-02 17:32:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Timobns Gaming the system shows contempt for your fellow citizens and the country as a whole. Are welfare cheats also funny?
782631988146556928 2016-10-02 17:23:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Timobns You don't care about a story that you were the first comment on and have commented on multiple times?  Why comment then?
782631357188968448 2016-10-02 17:20:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Timobns Ah, so you knew your statement was false, but made it anyway b/c it felt good to say?  Well, I can see why you like Trump.
782629969104998401 2016-10-02 17:14:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Timobns Actually, some ppl do deliberately overpay, for multiple reasons which are pretty obvious. Do you need them spelled out?

782627499234562048 2016-10-02 17:05:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonathanalter Maybe by "fix it" he means "formalize the fact that the wealthy are effectively exempt from most taxation"?

782409689002758146 2016-10-01 02:39:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @nickconfessore @USA_First_2016 DNC leaks included ppl not running for POTUS discussing personal issues.  Do you honestly not see the diff?
782409473889480704 2016-10-01 02:38:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @nickconfessore @USA_First_2016 You understand he's not the one that gave the documents, right?  Anyway, doesn't apply to pre-1998 stuff.
782388840702947332 2016-10-01 01:16:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis 10.1 innings...oh right, you mean his last 2 starts.  Where he went 10.1 innings total.  I hate Clay going 7&6, so long!

781345569201467392 2016-09-28 04:11:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes It'd be funny that he's such an undisciplined child that he can't help himself if there wasn't a chance he could destroy America.
781345168343478272 2016-09-28 04:09:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @SnazzyBBQ You put an "s" in front of "he".
781326702324568064 2016-09-28 02:56:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn @bzref We won a WS in 2013. Just clinched the division. Got a Cy contender under team control for 3 more years. Horrible!
781325348562624513 2016-09-28 02:50:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn @bzref Also it's weird we now complain about how our teams made the playoffs but not as the top seed. Good problems.
781322846303690752 2016-09-28 02:40:57 UTC <bosdcla14> And Farrell. Ziegler or Koji are available to bail out Kimbrel if he lets Clay pitch the 7th.

781297416565846016 2016-09-28 00:59:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Then Trump says he's heard from many people, very smart people, that Monica and Bill are still secretly seeing each other?
781289883197444096 2016-09-28 00:29:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @HistOpinion I think the main thing I learned from this is that 1936, there were negative consequences for being very, very wrong.

780968394996666368 2016-09-27 03:12:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom I assume you mean in general, not b/c of this.  Endorsements almost never matter.

780586596739362816 2016-09-26 01:55:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC True, but that's a fact, and I don't think we're allowed to mention facts anymore.

780197444625666048 2016-09-25 00:09:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd Its an idiom used to emphasize severity and understood as such.
780196790016446464 2016-09-25 00:06:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd But the fact that both candidates have made shifting claims about their political beliefs is a fact.
780196037025681408 2016-09-25 00:03:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd Not seeing the problem. It applies to both sides.
780195888773804032 2016-09-25 00:02:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd Yes fine. So if she says I'm a moderate, fine for her to be fact checked with primary claim of progressivism.
780195566894448640 2016-09-25 00:01:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd No. Lies are lies. They are deplorable no matter which side utters them.
780193898790477824 2016-09-25 23:54:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd Its not an opinion. Obama didn't found Uber. Gore did not invent the Internet. Bush wasn't behind 9-11.
780193593541529600 2016-09-25 23:53:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinHoch22 @ColorBlndBastrd No. Founder means founder.  Obama didn't found Uber, did he?

779377494327631872 2016-09-23 17:50:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek @JoeMoor33349838 So if as an IT worker you agreed that the loss was irrevocable, you were a very lazy or very dishonest IT guy.

779367380052959232 2016-09-23 17:10:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek @JoeMoor33349838 Lol no it wasn't. That's a pile of nonsense. Do you believe it yourself?

779059712109137925 2016-09-22 20:48:04 UTC <bosdcla14> But at the same time, why the F is a police dept spending 275k on a gala?  Especially for a gift of 150k?https://twitter.com/dvnjr/status/778919762487341056

778979175222738944 2016-09-22 15:28:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @NRA @molly_knight @NBCNightlyNews A federalized police force will take all guns without warrants!
778833278715310080 2016-09-21 05:48:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @Mediaite @Only__Trump True. MLK had 66% disapproval among Americans & demanded a guaranteed income for all citizens. Neither true for BO.
778829610813235200 2016-09-21 05:33:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes I keep hoping some of the folks who complain about taxes would move to Kansas and reduce congestion. None yet. Wonder why?

778449310388064256 2016-09-20 04:22:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 And I knew you'd duck, dodge, and weave.  I wish you cared about your country.  Have a good night.
778448926089228293 2016-09-20 04:21:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 He'll have the power in his hands to destroy the country.  You should hang on his words---and HRC's words.
778448653199343616 2016-09-20 04:19:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 Yeah, I'd agree that it'd be pretty sad to lack that integrity.
778448362659917824 2016-09-20 04:18:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 If it was a mistake, I'm sure DJT will just say "so it turns out he's a GOPer, my bad."  If not...
778448033746866176 2016-09-20 04:17:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 Just want to see if you have any sense of honor.
778447935805624320 2016-09-20 04:17:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 One of the ironies is that, during the investigation of HRC, the cmmtes repeatedly leaked confidential info.
778447667189862401 2016-09-20 04:16:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 You mean marked confidential?  Did it bother you when no penalty was applied to Chaffetz, McCarthy, and Issa?
778447147796615168 2016-09-20 04:13:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 I'll ask again: if was HRC lying about  moderators' politics, would you defend her like you're defending DJT?
778446802328498177 2016-09-20 04:12:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 Yes.  For example, I'd think an email protocol story about DJT would also be stupid.  I'd defend him on that.
778445947474890756 2016-09-20 04:09:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddale8 @civiltwilight42 Personally, I don't think that simply not lying in a SOTU makes you great---just WAY better than DJT, a low bar.
778445404580950017 2016-09-20 04:07:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 Just apply the same std. Imagine HRC accused Trump & Holt of being old friends & its false. You'd defend her?
778443588656963584 2016-09-20 03:59:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @NPR @catinca1 He's lying about a moderator to make the mod look biased.  Pretend it was HRC; apply the same std to DJT.

778433780558143488 2016-09-20 03:20:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABC Probably b/c DJT is the worst major party candidate ever nominated for President...definitely since Buchanan in 1857, maybe ever.

778045063259574272 2016-09-19 01:36:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid I feel like you answered your question in your question.
778044568419700736 2016-09-19 01:34:15 UTC <bosdcla14> An unfair comparison, but in reverse: way more people were killed by cars in 2015 and 2016 than by Syrian refugees.
778039783364845569 2016-09-19 01:15:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster He's not just pitching well, he's pitching well with swagger.  Carrying himself like an ace, and backing it up.
778039460826972161 2016-09-19 01:13:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @DonaldJTrumpJr "If I pointed to your car and said 38,400 Americans died in auto accidents in 2015, would you drive?"
777717643813855233 2016-09-18 03:55:10 UTC <bosdcla14> Agreed.  You should stop advocating it.
777716204622405633 2016-09-18 03:49:27 UTC <bosdcla14> I think its a given that Trump would use state power in that way.  He's been pretty open about his neo-fascism.
777711444125114368 2016-09-18 03:30:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Holy shit, how long have you been sitting on this picture?
777706376508301312 2016-09-18 03:10:23 UTC <bosdcla14> .@HanleyRamirez ties his career high in RBI as he continues his one-man demolition of the Yankees.
777705686197121024 2016-09-18 03:07:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn Let's get that man a day off.
777659732924346368 2016-09-18 00:05:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Contra Spaceballs, Good will always triumph because Evil is dumb?
777644696881422336 2016-09-18 23:05:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @FDRLST "Integration" of Trumpism makes no sense.  Maybe you mean trying to find less dishonorable terms of surrender? Fight's already over.
777596153202249728 2016-09-18 19:52:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @Patriots Well I mean it is pretty tough to stop elite RB Kenyan Drake.
777345051613474817 2016-09-17 03:14:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @julieroginsky @soledadobrien Jesus I can't imagine being as gutless as you. You're in the home of the brave, try it once.
777318613413826561 2016-09-17 01:29:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @JamilSmith @bigbabygravycab He lies constantly. "I got a letter from the NFL" "I opposed Iraq". "I saw $ go into plane". Etc.

777316376562143232 2016-09-17 01:20:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @chrislhayes @JeffreyGoldberg @El_Chuco_TX This is a good example. Think how long ago that was---and with Trump it'd be constant.
777239989344083968 2016-09-17 20:17:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Maybe the pitcher would have alerted the catcher earlier.

777207544670367744 2016-09-17 18:08:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @kurteichenwald @Green_Footballs All of the above: Trump still agrees with them and Hillary invented this. Contradiction doesn't matter.
777206836114010112 2016-09-17 18:05:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @JDiamond1 @Green_Footballs @realDonaldTrump Publish their full email with the name. Letting them stay anonymous is fanning the hate.
777172235890991106 2016-09-17 15:47:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @RobinBellocchio So the defense is that Trump got so fooled by bureaucrats he said this?  Ok.
777010847344320512 2016-09-16 05:06:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker @GrayConnolly @ModernCortes That's like telling someone to turn the car around in mid-air. 
776982634480009216 2016-09-16 03:14:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker @ModernCortes @GrayConnolly "Gaddafi is killing thousands.  We should..go into Libya, knock this guy out."  DJT, 2/2011.
776956470780841985 2016-09-16 01:30:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @TimBritton No thanks.  He was very bad in his last 220 games in Boston, I think that's enough time to break a slump.

776948518032244736 2016-09-16 00:58:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @SnafuWorld A memo from an organization that ceased to exist in 2010 about a 2016 poll is as compelling as most RW stuff, I guess.
776948077080956928 2016-09-16 00:57:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @joyreaper @soniafarace @roycan79 @paul_schale But they FEEL like it exists, and isn't that more important?
776934897751461888 2016-09-16 00:04:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNNSitRoom There is no evidence he is joking. Please stop trying to cover for his calls for assassination of his opponents.
776888422015180800 2016-09-16 21:00:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn @mmurraypolitics @PollsAndVotes Also she tends to do better when media goes crazy on her, like NH 2008 after she got choked up.

776812698851913728 2016-09-16 15:59:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 @WhiskeyNick Read the article&reflect on the fact that the words "birthplace" "birth certificate", "citizen" etc never appear
776811862461599744 2016-09-16 15:55:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 @DiscoPriest Its back to the heady days of 1999-2002, when any false claim was OK as long as it painted Dems in a bad light.
776810757220478976 2016-09-16 15:51:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @GordonEdes @GlobeChadFinn @goldenbear1975 Paterno's own sworn GJ testimony acknowledges he knew of child rape & did nada.

776626444558479361 2016-09-15 03:39:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes The idea that increased revenue counteracts tax cut...Kansas tried this on a SMALLER scale and it was a deficit disaster.
776622185385308160 2016-09-15 03:22:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME Thank you for stating the actual positions of the campaign and candidate.  Amazing how many outlets got this wrong.
776621840718376960 2016-09-15 03:20:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @sportspickle WOW that is aggressive.

776615282806706176 2016-09-15 02:54:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @JoshuaGreen Its a private meeting.  We'll provisionally admit you since you have a 4-letter name starting "Jo."
776614779305680900 2016-09-15 02:52:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @JoshuaGreen Why would he have to?
776613455977586688 2016-09-15 02:47:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @USATODAY That isn't true.  Trump's communication guy says Trump believes this, but Trump repeatedly refused to say it himself today.
776613037906071552 2016-09-15 02:45:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @algore @jmartNYT @erinwalsh10 Yes.  Also the ballots, also the media, etc.  Many causes that, if taken away, would have flipped state.
776602258649718785 2016-09-15 02:03:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @LindseyThiry I really like this picture.
776599440874274816 2016-09-15 01:51:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @deray This seems optimistic.  Under GWB, we had 9/11, Iraq, Katrina & an economic crash.  Trump is WAY worse, I cannot imagine the damage.
776595556130967552 2016-09-15 01:36:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @algore @maggieNYT @jmartNYT @edwardharris251 Yep.  & Gore can discuss cost of losing: 9/11, Iraq, Katrina, OBL free.  Plus econ crash.
776594093195407360 2016-09-15 01:30:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @algore @jmartNYT @erinwalsh10 Defeat had lots of causes, but Nader deliberately & successfully targeted swing states to make Gore lose.
776458693793636352 2016-09-15 16:32:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum I understand its a country, not a state, but didn't Kansas fall way short of a less optimistic projection, leading to crisis?
775896402874380288 2016-09-13 03:18:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @DouthatNYT I sort of agree---I think simply turning to the camera, saying "Mr. Trump's assertion Y is false.  The truth is X" then move on.
775880983023280128 2016-09-13 02:16:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Pace yourself.  You need to save some anger for when Farrell lets Hanigan hit again.

775878202677866496 2016-09-13 02:05:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @kvnwtts01 But Trump said she had no policy, and FEELS like she has no policy, so the actual facts do not matter.
775865695280037888 2016-09-13 01:16:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @lordbeef So limiting!  Why only one problematic category, and not all 3?  They are vast, they contain multitudes.

775853448185024513 2016-09-13 00:27:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @Bencjacobs @mkng45 "47%"= no effect.  If anything, MSM was nice by focusing on that instead of his discussion of his use of forced labor.
775852415543152640 2016-09-13 00:23:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @alivitali It SOUNDS good, and it FEELS good to say.  The truth doesn't matter to Trump.
775803311681249283 2016-09-13 21:08:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @NathanWurtzel @HotlineJosh So HRC's 8 points below Obama 2012, Trump's 11 points below Mitt & the bigger deal is the lower HRC drop?  Um...
775768515156377600 2016-09-13 18:50:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes Are retired people hard-working?  Seems like, at most, they were previously hard-working, since they no longer work.
775734113995100161 2016-09-13 16:33:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarbaraBoxer Yeah but since he says stuff more insane than that there's not way the media will note that fact in their coverage.
775518392480518144 2016-09-12 02:16:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @daveweigel I certainly would have wanted it as a high school boy.

774015276496986112 2016-09-08 22:43:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence DJT talks about how this country isn't great, only loses, and he lies constantly.
774014344849874944 2016-09-08 22:39:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @HallieJackson @NBCNightlyNews But he FEELS like he opposed the Iraq War, and aren't his feelings more important than the facts?
774006334115098625 2016-09-08 22:07:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @jamestaranto @PiffleRMe Thanks, but I've been down the "I know more than career GOP prosecutor James Comey" road, I'm good.
774006299830784001 2016-09-08 22:07:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @jamestaranto @PiffleRMe There's a candidate involved in bribes in this race, but its the one who paid off AGs to make charges go away.
774006095744339968 2016-09-08 22:06:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @jamestaranto @PiffleRMe You know that the state email server was the one hacked, right?
774002951232696323 2016-09-08 21:54:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @jamestaranto @PiffleRMe Did you watch Lauer suck Trump off last night while regarding email servers as the greatest crime in history?
773984525764300800 2016-09-08 20:41:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @jamestaranto You think journalism requires letting Republicans lie w/ impunity? I mean, I guess you're right, based on the last 16 years...
773962488064774144 2016-09-08 19:13:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @igorvolsky Let's go old school.  Tamerlane.  Ghengis Khan.  Fall of the western Roman Empire.  Fall of Constantinople.
773961960811487232 2016-09-08 19:11:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @ashleyfeinberg @BLMpplarestupid I remember when Trump didn't know that and put it on twitter, you silly shitgibbon.
773959492669091840 2016-09-08 19:01:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh So a ref who calls ticky-tack fouls on one team but nothing against the other is better than a ref who ignores fouls from both?
773692858955988992 2016-09-07 01:22:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd Why is Trump not pressed on his false claims to have opposed Iraq war and Libyan intervention?  He favored both.
772500419217989632 2016-09-04 18:23:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @mcuban Any thoughts on why the mainstream reporting on that fairly simple fact has been so muddled and sensationalistic?

772496194870194176 2016-09-04 18:06:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @IngrahamAngle @elwood6789 Trump breaks so many laws. Has the elder abuse trial coming up, then the child rape case after that.
772235953259687936 2016-09-03 00:52:53 UTC <bosdcla14> I was going to question whether Clay had mentioned the concept of a play clock to his team.https://twitter.com/ReignofTroy/status/772235723751632897

772097541122891780 2016-09-03 15:42:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek I'm amazed anyone would expect otherwise. Leaving a trail of unpaid bills in his wake is basically the business model of DJT.
771883439083532288 2016-09-02 01:32:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @DrJillStein You know what else wasn't taken seriously?  Harambe's right to live.  Makes you think.
771866421210918912 2016-09-02 00:24:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @Mediaite MSM is resentful that HRC gives interviews to local and minority news sources. They think regular ppl less important than DC-ers.
771483572683235328 2016-09-01 23:03:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @Heminator @daveweigel As shown by Trump winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
771164834473750528 2016-08-31 01:56:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @pbump Good charts, though a bit strange (?) that one ends in 2010 and the next starts in 2009.
771158207003660288 2016-08-31 01:30:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @damianpaletta I thought I had a lack of professional baseball experience, but I met Wade Boggs so I guess I'm good on that.
771117139797291008 2016-08-31 22:47:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Weirdly, both could be telling the truth, sort of.  If Pena says that and Trump ignores him/doesn't respond, is that a discussion?
770822630496546816 2016-08-30 03:16:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @WalshFreedom And anything else is a failure!  Agreed!
770489777737064448 2016-08-29 05:14:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes Wild that DJT put a Putin asset then a white nationalist as head of his campaign but the MSM is all "Huma's hubby likes to sext!"
770322709838376960 2016-08-29 18:10:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @maggieNYT Wouldn't the comparison be to Bannon's ex-wife?  Dems haven't argued her conduct implicates Trump.
770064902094479360 2016-08-28 01:05:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @TimBritton Might as well try to steal second.
770027405264191488 2016-08-28 22:36:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes @GideonResnick @benafflek3000 She's won the election & is about to appoint judges & is stopped by 2A peeps.  Bye!
770026667171512321 2016-08-28 22:33:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes @GideonResnick @benafflek3000 Trump implied HRC could get assassinated by his supporters.  And praises them!
770025300709273600 2016-08-28 22:28:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes @GideonResnick @benafflek3000 Even a fool can see the diff b/w mentioning a possibility & terming it desirable.
769965496301129728 2016-08-28 18:30:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @chrislhayes @GideonResnick @benafflek3000 A member of Trump's campaign called for Hillary's death and Trump praised him, you shitgibbon.
769675269963558912 2016-08-27 23:17:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald Doubt it.  Did begging the Kochs for $ damage him?  Did putting a guy from Goldman Sachs in charge of his campaign do so?
769671028909846528 2016-08-27 23:00:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP Wade spoke out.  Trump celebrated that he thought this would get him votes.  You guys are messed up.
769591433997066240 2016-08-27 17:44:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @agearan He's campaigning to lead, not to read. 
769539077737553920 2016-08-27 14:16:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @realDonaldTrump What a ghoul.
769266086906703872 2016-08-26 20:11:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNN Nothing like leaving a voicemail with a gay slur to prove you're not a bigot.
769018080085311488 2016-08-25 03:46:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZekeJMiller Pretty unfair to associate Trump with the things he wrote and said and did and pretty much his entire existence.
769003131824779264 2016-08-25 02:46:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom You're very powerful.  Everyone says so.
769001196526768128 2016-08-25 02:39:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @MSNBC @Green_Footballs They'll be able to point to this for the rest of their careers as a defense to subsequent hackery.
768982439981047809 2016-08-25 01:24:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @spideyscouting Technically you guys do post a lot of hate speech...as quotes from media outlets like the one where Megyn Kelly works.
768971295119650816 2016-08-25 00:40:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @igorvolsky Its weird that this isn't reversed, usually Trump plays to the audience.
768646308122927104 2016-08-24 03:08:55 UTC <bosdcla14> Not quite the Sarah Palin Turkey Slaughter backdrop but some good stuff going on here.https://twitter.com/wpjenna/status/768645099349684224
768603930863345664 2016-08-24 00:20:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @FowlerSarah DJT not such a big fan of babies who cry at rallies.
768575431368847360 2016-08-24 22:27:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb I recall like it was yesterday when a path to legal residency was considered amnesty-lite by the GOP.  Because it was yesterday.
768538432838656000 2016-08-24 20:00:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Knitflix.
768467401641828353 2016-08-24 15:18:00 UTC <bosdcla14> OTOH Mark Halperin has never had brunch with them so are they even real?https://twitter.com/paulbegala/status/768256847337914368
768306791578951680 2016-08-23 04:39:48 UTC <bosdcla14> Lower unemployment, consistent growth.  Certainly could be better tho.  I'm doing well which, agreed, could lead to bias.
768282034796048386 2016-08-23 03:01:25 UTC <bosdcla14> Dunno on either tho C&R wouldn't count toward deportations.  Probably have seen an increase in 15-16 due to better econ?
768281439754260480 2016-08-23 02:59:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @wpjenna But not too sarcastic, right?  :)
768279505408360448 2016-08-23 02:51:22 UTC <bosdcla14> DJT is correct about BHO's policy.  http://fusion.net/story/252637/obama-has-deported-more-immigrants-than-any-other-president-now-hes-running-up-the-score/  GOP group even ran attack ads on it.http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/
768278378130448385 2016-08-23 02:46:53 UTC <bosdcla14> Quotes from Trump's last Bill-O appearance.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/23/trumps-new-immigration-plan-do-what-obama-is-doing-but-with-a-lot-more-energy/
768277407031623681 2016-08-23 02:43:02 UTC <bosdcla14> "As far as the rest, we're going to go through the process, like they  are now, perhaps with a lot more energy."
768277081511698433 2016-08-23 02:41:44 UTC <bosdcla14> "What people don't know is that Obama got tremendous numbers of people out of the country..I'm going to do the same thing."
768275255605407744 2016-08-23 02:34:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @alivitali @Enopoletus Had he praised Obama's immigration policy & said he'd do the same thing before?
768204342490836992 2016-08-23 21:52:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @Fahrenthold I feel like he'll eventually donate this one, but his temper tantrum when he's forced to do so will be volcanic.
768198260771033089 2016-08-23 21:28:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @LACaldwellDC Except there's fewer people now...172 employees/consultants in July vs. 197 in March.
768191918509391872 2016-08-23 21:03:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @dandrezner I think he'll do this one eventually, but the whining when he's forced to is going to be unbelievable.
768191639789576192 2016-08-23 21:02:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @ezlusztig She met with 84 big donors in 4 years, an average of 21 a year or almost 1.5 a month!
768186839165341697 2016-08-23 20:43:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByronYork @ppppolls Yeah "Utah is close" stuff is pretty silly and overblown.
768173465782194176 2016-08-23 19:50:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Workers should be able to choose to unionize & likely have a better sense than you or me on if that would be helpful to them.
768147342730027008 2016-08-23 18:06:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 @EdAsante77 Maybe if you count people who didn't vote but are embarrassed to admit it, or people who were too young to vote?
767970344074305536 2016-08-22 06:22:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Do you ever sleep?

767902514196783109 2016-08-22 01:53:20 UTC <bosdcla14> Outrageous catch.https://twitter.com/bostonsportsinf/status/767901829514596352
767900641750417408 2016-08-22 01:45:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp Utah office seems a little silly.  She's around 25% there and is down around a dozen to Trump.  Nice for Utah Dems, I suppose.
767900320999485440 2016-08-22 01:44:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @AmandaPresto ???  Blanket coverage of HRC's email habits vs. almost none of Trump bribing Bondi & Christie for reduced/dropped charges.
767899652234424321 2016-08-22 01:41:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @PatrickRuffini Similarly, it was entirely ineffective when the GOP called the Dems soft on defense after McGovern.  Oh wait.
767853108122660864 2016-08-22 22:37:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill Also water is wet.
767812516642562048 2016-08-22 19:55:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Fair enough. Is there an intervention you see as a model?
767808741697662976 2016-08-22 19:40:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom If you think every postwar was botched, perhaps your expectations about US ability to manage PW too optimistic?
767801572927479808 2016-08-22 19:12:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Do you believe the US approach to the postwar situation in Iraq was superior to the approach to postwar Libya?
767763609455689728 2016-08-22 16:41:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @KellyannePolls @JoeNBC She was probably just being sarcastic?
767513869413605377 2016-08-21 00:09:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe As opposed to having him pinch run for someone?
767434971510222848 2016-08-21 18:55:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @maggieNYT Why is the NYT not ID'ing Stone as a Trump ally and conspiracy theorist ("LBJ killed JFK!") when he's quoted?
767425610322890760 2016-08-21 18:18:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Martinez had hit .455 over his last 11 prior to today.  Farrell is such a brutal liability.
767425239126904833 2016-08-21 18:16:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Such an inexplicable decision especially with two outs.
767275082293084160 2016-08-21 08:20:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mviser Interesting. If CNN practiced journalism this sort of double dealing would be disallowed of course.
767162705908158464 2016-08-20 00:53:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattdpearce Gonna be the BEST amnesty, all class.
767083413572505600 2016-08-20 19:38:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @Deadspin @albo1952 "He asked a Twitter account of a website which writes about sports, with apparent sincerity."

766751788666007552 2016-08-19 21:40:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC @TheCochese Trump continuing his unique strategy of "link Hillary to people more popular than her"---Obama, now Merkel.
766746105644101634 2016-08-19 21:18:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @gamoid I would hope that the defining principle of leadership is something more than "going to a place and looking at a thing."
766741535362691072 2016-08-19 21:00:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Even more specific: someone in the crowd drops the c-bomb, Trump highlights it & says, "wow I should say that's bad" with a smile.
766741097074692096 2016-08-19 20:58:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @jjmacnab AP is real legal concept, but only if prop owners fail to take action to expel the possessor OR give permission (which negates AP)
766739560667635712 2016-08-19 20:52:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @onlxn [Juice box says TRUMP JUICE, citizen looks concerned].

766713864767451137 2016-08-19 19:10:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Assad released imprisoned Islamists to fight US in Iraq after invasion.  They returned to Syria battle-hardened & ready.
766701853857853440 2016-08-19 18:22:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarackObama @Newsweek @awmessenger "This POTUS is dictatorial" said area man in self-refuting statement.
766701211114352640 2016-08-19 18:19:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek These guys are like the cult leaders who give dates for the apocalypse and then awkwardly explain why they were wrong.
766678299418386432 2016-08-19 16:48:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @mmurraypolitics And that Bush had chosen a Bush loyalist to head FEMA over a disaster response expert.
766654610194829313 2016-08-19 15:14:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @politico Remember when Pierson said this wasn't a shakeup because no one had left. Feels like just yesterday. Because it was.
766652482965508096 2016-08-19 15:06:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @Gawker @Hyenastuff Yes agreed. Now rest of media will bow and scrape to the elites and plutocrats.
766480031606386690 2016-08-18 03:40:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @Shirleyann27 @TrumpWontWin She means how her gut feels the world views us, not anything based on data or facts.

766453228313583616 2016-08-18 01:54:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson Bennett saying other people are acting morally superior is like Pete Carroll saying other coaches need to trust the run game.
766432318017777664 2016-08-18 00:31:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp @phallicmanic @SubalternYouth But what's sweet about being white is I can just show 'em what's uphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaFxKSyTBEA
766431744551559168 2016-08-18 00:29:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp @phallicmanic @SubalternYouth So a nation ruled by a black guy...well, I think I'll just stay in this one, moving's a hassle.
766431240945709056 2016-08-18 00:27:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp @phallicmanic @SubalternYouth Unless you're eating someone's face. Then, finish, b/c faces are delicious & the cops will be cool
766430484859531264 2016-08-18 00:24:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @sahilkapur Is he arguing that HRC is racially biased against black people, white people, Latinos, Asians...?
766428832416997376 2016-08-18 00:17:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Well he's not saying we're doing it now, he's saying we will do it at some point.  :)
766425642925559808 2016-08-18 00:04:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp @SubalternYouth So I get pampered with no effort?  Tell you what, when it comes to learned helplessness I'd be a quick study.
766423378945150976 2016-08-18 23:55:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @samsteinhp @SubalternYouth Being bribed to death sounds amazing.  So much bribery that you die?  Tremendous!  Where do I sign up?
766418254889824260 2016-08-18 23:35:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @OPMpaul 2nd shirt was a Monica/HRC sucks joke. But Trump security is right, that guy shouldn't  support Trump.
766415161414430720 2016-08-18 23:23:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @DagnyDelinquent You're being very unfair to Reagan. There's no reliable way to self diagnose a neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's.
766412400073465861 2016-08-18 23:12:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @DagnyDelinquent So instead ppl should vote 4 a guy who can't run a campaign as well as a lady who gets strokes when ppl yell things.
766411378257043457 2016-08-18 23:08:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @DagnyDelinquent Well, go ahead & tell everyone that if they vote for the Democrat, they'll wind up with Tim Kaine, not Hillary Clinton.
766410230490017792 2016-08-18 23:03:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @DagnyDelinquent You think strokes are caused by..people yelling?  There's this thing called "medical science" that disagrees w/U.
766408680904404993 2016-08-18 22:57:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @DagnyDelinquent Jesus, he can't even read a prepared script if he gets interrupted?  Which candidate supposedly has brain damage?
766402786426662912 2016-08-18 22:33:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @BreitbartNews @MattMackowiak Oh man that's good.  Ethics and dignity.
766395652469170176 2016-08-18 22:05:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnRiversToo @thedailybeast @CherylLynneRose So Trump's too dumb to beat a candidate with brain damage?...OK, that sounds right, carry on.
766389796646203392 2016-08-18 21:42:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom @CapCube In the same way a person in a hospice is still alive.
766375537757392896 2016-08-18 20:45:41 UTC <bosdcla14> Trump might carry New England if he said he'd kick John Farrell out of USA. "Its temporary, just until we figure out what's going on."
766374303767990272 2016-08-18 20:40:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @Soxlunch Seems to have introduced consensus, not chaos.
766373343423410177 2016-08-18 20:36:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox Does Farrell think he has a time machine that transports 2013 Tazawa into the game?  That would honestly make more sense.
766350904354181121 2016-08-18 19:07:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias That means that if you're polled it is an invalid poll.
766336086368919552 2016-08-18 18:08:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @redsoxstats He's talked about feeling exhausted.  Seems like give him multiple days off and get him checked out by a doctor.
766331718181584897 2016-08-18 17:51:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @TimBritton Remy points out V-Mart never looked at ump. He went back because he thought it was a catch.
766318513417883648 2016-08-18 16:59:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @Gawker Too bad, site was smart, fun and irreverent.  A rich guy used secret funding of lawsuits to destroy a news org he disliked.  Ugh.
766314432221761536 2016-08-18 16:42:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @OGlobo_Rio @nathanfenno Maybe they were so drunk they thought they were in the pool and started naturally swinging their arms and pissing?
766108981655801856 2016-08-17 03:06:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm I recall seeing V-Dare respond to someone criticizing the RNC for featuring V-Dare's tweet by writing "what's wrong fam?"
766107929070022656 2016-08-17 03:02:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @stuartpstevens No need.  People should pull themselves up by their bootstraps the way DJT did when he inherited millions.
766107399421702145 2016-08-17 03:00:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @moody @smelllikesugar @JasonHornbuckle Its gotten much worse.  Reagan won Asians by a large majority, GWB got 40% of Latinos.
766103782392336384 2016-08-17 02:45:49 UTC <bosdcla14> Hey @AoDespair did you consider an arc on The Wire w/ a neo-Nazi city lawyer but decide it'd be too farfetched?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-police-neo-nazi-lawyer_us_57b511e8e4b095b2f5427fa6
766102823511535616 2016-08-17 02:42:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @BJYLive Um, it says it was posted by Real True News&the company couldn't call itself that if it wasn't true that's just science.

766085105953574912 2016-08-17 01:31:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald I find this so weird.  There's tons of issues to persuasively criticize HRC on.  Instead they lie about stupid stuff?
766084738511581184 2016-08-17 01:30:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mitchellvii And leave them shut down for how long?
766081867346874368 2016-08-17 01:18:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @zamartin I feel like Leo might have hesitated if Jack or Tracy had told him to call him the healthiest man to ever be President.
766075203990409216 2016-08-17 00:52:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh Point is GOP has attacked HRC for leaving material vulnerable to breach meanwhile they're DELIBERATELY sharing classified info.
766044800273387520 2016-08-17 22:51:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @ChadMosher I suppose he's not technically losing until people start actually voting?
765957750513741824 2016-08-17 17:05:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill Seems like another reason to not give him briefings.
765820373866680322 2016-08-17 07:59:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @foxandfriends What's that song?  "Every day I'm shuffling"?
765812346254192640 2016-08-17 07:27:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @colvinj @SopanDeb So Bannon's in charge, Conway is 2nd, and Manafort is now 3rd?
765755905107374080 2016-08-16 03:43:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @newtgingrich So the clearest appeal to the A-A community was introduced by Glenn Grothman, who wants to ban MLK day and kwanzaa...OK.
765748579310764032 2016-08-16 03:14:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @dbernstein DJT stood by this after real perp confessed & convictions reversed: "These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels."
765740057948860416 2016-08-16 02:40:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb WI has implemented a lot of so-called school reform&has seen  teachers/profs leave to avoid being subject to whims of politicians.
765736465049395201 2016-08-16 02:26:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @wilw "Please ignore the fact that I was introduced by Glenn Grothman, who wants to 'get rid of' MLK day and Kwanzaa."
765727358733004800 2016-08-16 01:50:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @clintonyates @OldTakesExposed Bad takes on Mookie Betts is a booming industry.
765725121138962432 2016-08-16 01:41:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis That's A Bad, Francisco.
765721574284546048 2016-08-16 01:27:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Yeah he sucks.  Worse than Layne, amazingly enough.
765718246745972737 2016-08-16 01:13:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Why?  NC went Mitt in 2012, the polls there have been closer than in VA, and Hillary's VP is a popular politician in VA.
765698744369111041 2016-08-16 23:56:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @wfaachannel8 @Wolfram1045 @KayTaylor3 DJT would have prohibited son's service since parents were Muslim immigrants.
765698376163663873 2016-08-16 23:54:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @maggieNYT @ModerateRCT Omarosa is an official Trump surrogate (paid by the campaign) and is Trump's director of African-American outreach.
765659563169226752 2016-08-16 21:20:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByRyanWood @rlbyrne29 Since Bountygate. Admits he has zero proof Payton knew, suspends him for a year.
765634656532246528 2016-08-16 19:41:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS The nominee whom he endorses.
765598157346443264 2016-08-16 17:16:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @SuzGamboa @aseitzwald What's she doing with it?  Seems like she should give it back. Organ theft is very bad. 
765595724864073728 2016-08-16 17:06:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @hughhewitt @RadioFreeTom @realDonaldTrump Illegal under the Hatch Act but it's not like he was following election law up to now so go 4 it.
765594871335833600 2016-08-16 17:03:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @albamonica @aseitzwald @PeteWilliamsNBC By the FBI, maybe, but the Republicans will leak any pieces that they like.
765044152266399745 2016-08-14 04:35:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Burn After Tweeting
765039773031407616 2016-08-14 04:17:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @EricBoehlert Collective action problem: each candidate thought that if they went after Trump, they'd destroy both Trump and themselves.
765021742284742656 2016-08-14 03:06:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @CLewandowski_ @sarahmccammon @EllisEllis1965 Because when you play the Throne of Trump, you either win or you have to work at CNN?
765015672803905536 2016-08-14 02:42:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @mitchellvii As @PFTCommenter has noted, Trump is the voice of internet commenters everywhere.
765015402384494597 2016-08-14 02:40:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom I'm braced for the random 18-1 comments, but the Fridge reference is a bolt of pain from the clear blue sky.  Cuts deep, Tom.
765014329024360448 2016-08-14 02:36:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @DrJillStein Study says we need to rely on nuclear power to do that.  Are you reversing your position on nuclear power? Or relying on magic?
765013858859659264 2016-08-14 02:34:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattmfm "Donald Trump, at age 70, should become a different person than the guy he's been since, according to him, first grade."  GLWT.
765003558492123137 2016-08-14 01:53:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump The return of the "sad" tweet!  Been awhile!  Good to see it back!  Go after those wayward Republicans!
765001795936530433 2016-08-14 01:46:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @nytimes @michaeldweiss @4305a49a4b924f7 Seems like this was known in Trump campaign. Corey just retweeted it.
764997380236193792 2016-08-14 01:29:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @CLewandowski_ Corey doing his part to oppose Manafort's attempt to turn The President into a Putin puppet. Good for him.
764952874128318464 2016-08-14 22:32:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @Citizenhad @HowardKurtz POTUS needs to be able to communicate clearly. Trump talks and then his surrogates struggle to find way to explain.
764622463103709185 2016-08-13 00:39:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC They came for the two minutes hate, not a nuanced discussion of where the top marginal rate ceases optimizing returns.
764338457703387137 2016-08-12 05:51:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @AngieEwart @ddiamond @VenterMitt Read the tweet.  Obama has been asking Congress for $ for 186 days; McConnell/Ryan refuse b/c they hate US
764337785624928257 2016-08-12 05:48:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddiamond @baethompson @sockettoomey Obama requested $$ from Congress on Feb 11, over 6 months ago, you brain dead shitgibbon.
764249089886199808 2016-08-12 23:55:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias They're probably just feeling too much economic anxiety to go to Church.
764228072866406400 2016-08-12 22:32:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Stretch 4 who can't be a starter on an elite team but can give good energy off the bench.
764205858263670784 2016-08-12 21:04:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @imillhiser Obama more popular than Hillary so it's weird to link them.
763767567202648064 2016-08-11 16:02:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @kplawver Maybe he needs to insult to live.  For example, I breathe to live, but I don't say "wow breathing is fun."
763580615161634817 2016-08-10 03:39:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @realOBF @SurvivingGrady @ghabs Probably only did that after he learned the rules did not allow him to force Papi to pinch run for someone.
763572654519390209 2016-08-10 03:08:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq But then he signed his name using capital letters. Big no no among sovereigns citizens.
763572230353584128 2016-08-10 03:06:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianmacp Feel like he needs some time off. He looks exhausted.
763567927186427904 2016-08-10 02:49:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Well, once you've introduced a campaign surrogate as your "Trump" card, I think we're done. Have a good one!
763567489372426240 2016-08-10 02:47:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Oh, so we are now relying on the dispassionate neutrality of campaign surrogate Rudy Guilani.  Strong stuff.
763566498069655552 2016-08-10 02:43:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr So give Comey a call already.  Twitter's a waste of your Perry Mason talents.  :)
763565674551578624 2016-08-10 02:40:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr [Quotes statute requiring intent].  "You know there's no intent requirement."  Cool, cool.
763565408141975552 2016-08-10 02:39:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr So just call Comey.  Or Issa.  Or Gowdy.  Or any of the other investigators.  And say, hey, I want charges!
763565254114578436 2016-08-10 02:38:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr But look man, I don't want to run thru all 9 investigations, will take all night.
763565124351242240 2016-08-10 02:38:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Comey.  Ashcroft protege.  Voted for Bush II twice, McCain, and Mitt.
763564629624631297 2016-08-10 02:36:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Cool, you should let all the GOP investigators & prosecutors who keep not bringing charges know.
763564110462062592 2016-08-10 02:34:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Who are you talking to?
763563465965379584 2016-08-10 02:31:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr You realize you got the word intent there, right?
763563198352011269 2016-08-10 02:30:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Cool, you know more about criminal law than the GOP lawyers who keep concluding no charges can be brought.
763562911860002816 2016-08-10 02:29:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq It is less than ideal.
763562749938892800 2016-08-10 02:28:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr 10th investigation is the charm?
763562704439119872 2016-08-10 02:28:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr In the statute Comey was investigating, intent required.  Its why Petraeus charged & Rep Issa & McHenry not.
763562420220497920 2016-08-10 02:27:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr So no charges is more serious than a massive civil suit based on criminal statutes?  *Such* a hot take!
763561966136758273 2016-08-10 02:25:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Oh, I thought you were saying the email thing.  If you're a Clinton Body Count person, we can stop chatting.
763561795411816449 2016-08-10 02:24:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Not investigation.  That's what the trial he was complaining about with Curiel is about.  What'd you think?
763561504792678401 2016-08-10 02:23:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr I'm a civil lawyer, not a criminal one, but even I know intent is part of the mens rea.  You?
763561248508162048 2016-08-10 02:22:42 UTC <bosdcla14> Is there a combination of words that will convince Farrell to leave in a reliever who is pitching well?  If so, I'd love to figure them out.
763561213909356544 2016-08-10 02:22:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Elder abuse, fraud, wage theft.  Also nonpayment of debts, but I'm not sure that qualifies, right?
763560556250877956 2016-08-10 02:19:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr There's a candidate in this race who's got charges pending for lawbreaking, but its a dude.
763559891642388480 2016-08-10 02:17:19 UTC <bosdcla14> Clay gets 2 outs on 3 pitches.  Farrell, knowing Kimbrel is unavailable...takes Clay out of the game.  Relievers set inning on fire.
763558677932486656 2016-08-10 02:12:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr Pedophiles are scum.  Terrorists are scum.  Defending either is...fucked up.
763557157543432192 2016-08-10 02:06:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @thehill @LSDsr I'd say both are pretty bad.  One guy a pedophile, other guy fathered a terrorist.  No?
763555544971943938 2016-08-10 02:00:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @EWErickson UGH what is wrong with them?
763554205038628865 2016-08-10 01:54:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @kurteichenwald Maybe.  I know some righties have turned on Palin years later.  But others still like her.

763551217268035586 2016-08-10 01:42:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @RyanLizza @Enopoletus No, they're not.  Reuters said the Secret Service said there was no "formal meeting."  "Formal" doing work there!
763550559798370305 2016-08-10 01:40:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @sinderbrand The repetition is deliberate.  Goal is to let it seep into someone's brain.  In 2 mos, they'll have a vague belief its true.
763548481910734848 2016-08-10 01:31:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @maggieNYT @AhronZombi Nope.http://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/gop-chair-rnc-emails-were-not-hacked-731731523520
763547832225673216 2016-08-10 01:29:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @NoahGrayCNN @realmrmom Constitution guarantees the press the right to report freely.  Can be partisan if they want.  Read it.
763546370863005697 2016-08-10 01:23:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @anamariecox I think someone could teach him the word "Heller."  Plus Scalia liked to insult people in his opinions so there's that.
763545635052097537 2016-08-10 01:20:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox Feats of Clay---Last 5 relief appearances: 6.1 IN, 0 ER.
763543917925195776 2016-08-10 01:13:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeedAndrew @SubBeck "with his Iraq"?
763540342478024705 2016-08-10 00:59:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @CBSNews @ArdenFarhi "Spilled."
763529906219212800 2016-08-10 00:18:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCNews @Green_Footballs Also "citizenship" would be Birtherism plus.  Not only was he not born here, his mom is not his mom?
763529070910988288 2016-08-10 00:14:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Probably Trump, though some hyper-rich flipping to Clinton (Bloomberg, Whitman) might make it more of a question.
763527325233274880 2016-08-10 00:07:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @Goldfarb @David_Dobbs @joshtpm @sethmnookin Post-surgical complications will kill them while they're driving?
763524229937573888 2016-08-10 23:55:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Nope.  Secret Service, asked if there was a discussion said, "there was no formal meeting."  "Formal" doing work!
763523383820627968 2016-08-10 23:52:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCNews So now they're straight up doubting citizenship?  Used to be just that he was born here, now maybe his mom isn't his mom?
763517805131993088 2016-08-10 23:30:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @JasonMillerinDC Q: "Did you have a meeting?" A: "We did not have a formal meeting"= there was an (informal or other-than-formal) meeting.
763514255060586497 2016-08-10 23:15:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @TEN_GOP Oh yeah bro they totally focus on the USA so if you want news focused on Europe turn on the BBC or something.
763484382933819392 2016-08-10 21:17:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @cnni Trump is denying the meeting took place so I guess he's decided to lie about the Secret Service now.
763374395020587009 2016-08-10 14:00:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @hughhewitt @benshapiro It led the news today over Trump's suggestion of murder but OK.
763363063491796992 2016-08-10 13:15:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCFirstRead DJT death threat to HRC bigger than emails.  Be better.

763190611021225985 2016-08-09 01:49:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @RightWisconsin Well, congrats to Nehlen on his new gig at...probably CNN.  Possibly Fox, or do they need all the $ for Carlson & Tantaros?
763186234344615937 2016-08-09 01:32:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Impressive to beat that out.  Benny has some jets.
763173588253880324 2016-08-09 00:42:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarbaraBoxer Trumpers have shown they will even defend threats of murder.
763157941021134849 2016-08-09 23:40:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @Taniel @JohnMulkey So now even ppl who work for his campaign are biased against Trump?  Cool story bro.
763156472838524928 2016-08-09 23:34:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @Taniel @JohnMulkey Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson confirmed Trump was discussing assassination of Hillary.

763133514367635457 2016-08-09 22:03:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @JasonMillerinDC Then Why did Katina Pierson say Donald WAS discussing a possible assassination?

763125540899487745 2016-08-09 21:31:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnMulkey @Taniel Reminds me of when Sharron Angle suggested "2nd amendment remedies" as an alternative to "the vote."  GOP so violent.
763111953933840384 2016-08-09 20:37:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @aseitzwald Can't be read as about election. Comment was about judge choices post election.
763109760845479938 2016-08-09 20:28:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe Except the comments were about stopping Hillary from appointing judges after the election.
763035097775742976 2016-08-09 15:31:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarrieNBCNews DJT can keep the $ and blame all the GOP defectors for his loss, then use the $ as a warchest to back favored candidates.
762856730149593088 2016-08-08 03:43:12 UTC <bosdcla14> An actual headfirst slide.  Showing some grit @PardonMyTake style.https://twitter.com/russe677/status/762851145823887369
762701639513800704 2016-08-08 17:26:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @mitchellvii Oooh, is it Unskew the Polls season?  Hang on, I have to get my unskewing boots.
762450540370407424 2016-08-07 00:49:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Well it's running here in Los Angeles.
762449062201217025 2016-08-07 00:43:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight Chopping onions?
762382182715273216 2016-08-07 20:17:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @SuzanneFleming9 Yep.  Problem goes other way---the majority of the voting-eligible population of the US doesn't even bother to vote.
762381358035382272 2016-08-07 20:14:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @Tomatjax Because Trump is focusing on other things, and they cover what DJT wants them to cover.
762148956109320192 2016-08-06 04:50:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @EricBoehlert Thanks Jenna Maroney.
762075732323426305 2016-08-06 23:59:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @cd_hooks @TyLeisher A home where they can support a VP who says Bernie serves white supremacy and his supporters are dupes.
761730394106363904 2016-08-05 01:07:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticalAnt Do you agree with Green Party VP Ajamu Baraka that Bernie is an agent for white supremacy who duped his supporters?
761728920026611712 2016-08-05 01:01:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarlKenner @muzikgirl11 @scalpatriot @DMiddletonCbus A sizeable % of Tom Foley's constituents believed this when he lost his seat in 1994.
761721539012141056 2016-08-05 00:32:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @RichardGrenell What changed about McCain, Ayotte, and Ryan today that made DJT go from non-endorsing to endorsing?
761695072425357312 2016-08-05 22:47:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Ryan's winning either way.  Seems weird to make Trump zig-zag based on nothing rather than being able to point to the primary win.
761693409392275457 2016-08-05 22:40:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of...
761665528997945346 2016-08-05 20:49:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnJHarwood Other people are not impressed by someone who hadn't heard of the nuclear triad.
761662581920509952 2016-08-05 20:38:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @politico Healthcare coverage will be replaced with Trump Steaks, Trump Water, and Trump Doctors from Trump Medical School.
761640795774472192 2016-08-05 19:11:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @BuzzFeedAndrew @jerweber @JerryCote10 You're the one who mistook Trump's daughter for a woman he "digs" b/c she's hot.  :)
761639798234689537 2016-08-05 19:07:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABCWorldNews I wish he'd space this stuff out, its coming too fast.  The fire marshal stuff would have dominated a week most cycles.
761583557869395969 2016-08-05 15:24:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillKristol So much drama.  The Democratic party was 'finished' in 2004, the GOP in 2008, then Obama was 'doomed' after 2010.  Settle down.
761432960436363264 2016-08-04 05:25:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson @MaxTwain Will it be the deepest bench in a generation again, just like this year?
761376088945664000 2016-08-04 01:39:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZekeJMiller @helpingthos I think you mean "except."  I'm also not sure why you capitalized "supporters", but live your dream.
761350174312497152 2016-08-04 23:56:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @CahnEmily @gabrielsherman @meganliberman Yep.  @Peggynoonannyc with her lawn signs, @GeorgeWill, etc.
761345053000208384 2016-08-04 23:36:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes I know on this one his campaign has admitted its fake, but he just goes on.  Campaign staff may be getting too exhausted to defend.
761342455429992448 2016-08-04 23:26:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @Taniel I think PPP once observed that Ds respond to bad polls by saying "we're doomed" Rs by saying "you're lying."
761330903746383872 2016-08-04 22:40:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnJHarwood Well, you mentioned he was +5 with whites.
761323646090489856 2016-08-04 22:11:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @SteveKornacki @Vmarius123 There's not even a quote from Hillary in the article you link...are you OK?
761321161351245824 2016-08-04 22:01:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @Pat_Garofalo And, of course, the population increased during that time, so even a constant number would represent a percentage decline.
761240258960732160 2016-08-04 16:39:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @EliLake Everyone who is taking this seriously: he's kidding.  He's making fun of this argument. No need for the agitation.
761233728710385665 2016-08-04 16:13:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @seanhannity @MarieLeff I liked it when Alex Jones said the baby was a plant.  Solid stuff.  False flag baby.
761222550567342080 2016-08-04 15:29:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens Poll is actually fairly Trump-friendly in the demographics: 93% white for a state that was 78% white in 2012.
761062916992794625 2016-08-03 04:55:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @onlxn This is relevant to my interests.
761042848430985218 2016-08-03 03:35:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 @GiantMeteorUS You're not even the main meteor in this race, @smod2016 has that covered.
761040541505101825 2016-08-03 03:26:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @kotuzak People who don't like babies are a neglected constituency.  Smart to reach out; should keep it up.
761039146462740482 2016-08-03 03:20:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryPolling @URNotInvisible @zhudigrandmoon Perhaps @smod2016 ?
761038618995544068 2016-08-03 03:18:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryPolling @URNotInvisible It'd be nice if you'd click thru and see the results for Johnson, Stein, undecided & other.
761037268240863233 2016-08-03 03:13:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews This reference is a bit dated, but its like telling Brett Favre "no more picks"--he's a gunslinger...
761034785619795969 2016-08-03 03:03:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @mateagold @AriBerman @pattmlatimes Only if voter fraud were based on facts in the first place.
761028635239157761 2016-08-03 02:39:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe "Thank you sir, may I have another?"
761028160423026692 2016-08-03 02:37:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @daveweigel Hope they ask her Veep about his slut-shaming of Beyonce and his view that Sanders was pushing white supremacy.  Should be lit.
761025262649610240 2016-08-03 02:25:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan Why are you tweeting about summer 2010 in 2016?  Are you OK?  Do you need an adult?
761020927165407232 2016-08-03 02:08:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNN Jefferson bought Louisiana (which wasn't a delineated Con power) and then BANNED ALL TRADE so that's interesting from libertarians.
761020415170883584 2016-08-03 02:06:20 UTC <bosdcla14> Tremendous.https://twitter.com/shannondrayer/status/761020124925014016
760971530180243456 2016-08-03 22:52:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @EricBoehlert Wouldn't first "victory" have been by something like -0.25%?
760969004630482945 2016-08-03 22:42:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @greta But rightwingers FEEL its new information, and aren't the feelings of conservatives more important than objective reality?
760962766261800960 2016-08-03 22:17:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @politico @ProdigalDaily It is a Fox News poll.  They polled registered voters nationally.  Crosstabs available thru the link.
760960534065799168 2016-08-03 22:08:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @ShepNewsTeam The poll may be accurate, but neither candidate looks as good IRL as they do in those glamour shots.
760923998028832772 2016-08-03 19:43:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @marcorubio Did you not read the press release in January?https://twitter.com/Khanoisseur/status/760922577346985984
760923709141979136 2016-08-03 19:42:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @marcthiessen @megynkelly Here's a press release from January which mentions it...https://twitter.com/Khanoisseur/status/760922577346985984
760915167831990273 2016-08-03 19:08:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME Has he never met a Republican?  Of course they'd go apeshit.  They can't tell fantasy from reality so thought he was Chris Kyle.
760904269717315584 2016-08-03 18:24:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @MittRomney @ZachWahls He won't b/c he hates her, and its probably more effective if he endorses Johnson anyway.
760848420307296258 2016-08-03 14:42:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @paulkrugman @will_moriarty Do you care that DJTs actual released tax plan totally contradicts your chart or nah?
760699286321504256 2016-08-02 04:50:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @JonCouture @GlobeChadFinn I don't understand why Farrell leaves in struggling starters and pulls relievers pitching effectively.
760646496588931072 2016-08-02 01:20:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @alivitali @ChrisCJackson This is absolutely tremendous, well done.
760642668640673792 2016-08-02 01:05:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @daveweigel @Redistrict @DMiddletonCbus But neither Gore nor Kerry encouraged that, never mind led it.
760617356393451521 2016-08-02 23:24:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonswaine @OliverWest100 Are you kidding?  Clinton didn't tweet one thing about Pat Smith.  How often has Trump tweeted about the Khans?
760614775923482624 2016-08-02 23:14:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @GPollowitz @realchrishynes @violet7489 Name one mistake Donald Trump has admitted.  Not blaming someone else.  One mistake.
760613585634504704 2016-08-02 23:09:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson Maybe the Globalists gave Obama a time machine?

760597442093953024 2016-08-02 22:05:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @swin24 Once again, Trumping the Onion: http://www.theonion.com/article/visiting-gore-calls-pennsylvania-a-hellhole-294
760591418809135104 2016-08-02 21:41:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker @mateagold Also funny---DJT says "we need strong leadership" then follows it up saying he can't decide whether to endorse.  :)
760585213235769345 2016-08-02 21:17:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME Funny for obvious reasons, also funny b/c Trump says "we need strong leadership" then follows with saying he can't decide something.
760581434763382784 2016-08-02 21:01:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @NH1News @Al_Baldasaro @steinhauserNH1 Interesting story about Bush in contrast to Trump on this: http://ijr.com/2015/04/303811-george-w-bush-once-let-a-soldiers-mom-yell-at-him-the-reason-why-is-heartbreaking-and-revealing/
760580365727641600 2016-08-02 20:57:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @PRyan @KatieMLeach I wonder if Trump's non-endorsement of Ryan will make the Speaker think about endorsing a dead gorilla over Trump.
760574499066556416 2016-08-02 20:34:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Maybe because Ryan is curious about Harambe's polling numbers for POTUS?https://twitter.com/KatieMLeach/status/760302525400567812
760530772046381056 2016-08-02 17:40:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenJohnMcCain WTF?  Trump--who you endorse--wants to outright ally with Putin in Syria and withdraw support from NATO.
760530091008937984 2016-08-02 17:37:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @HotlineJosh I actually think he's being overly nice.  McCain's mercurial indecision during the crash did make me doubt his capacity.
760526212150157312 2016-08-02 17:22:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @megynkelly @EnemyWithinn DJT was asked about Ivanka getting harassed, said she should leave her career then, Eric is following up on that.
760515181982003200 2016-08-02 16:38:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @mtaibbi @_PeteSmith_ He's already expressed admiration for Saddam, and has his chairs.  Could see him copying the rest of his style.
760292137174839296 2016-08-01 01:52:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro I personally think Dubya dodging Vietnam helped him win reelection since Dems focused on Vietnam in 2004 instead Dubya's presidency.
760291303217172481 2016-08-01 01:49:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @Phil_Mattingly Technically, no other GOP candidate for POTUS raised $35.8 million in July 2016.
760287194212737024 2016-08-01 01:32:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @EricBoehlert He wins so much we're all gonna get tired of it.  :)
760285478503403521 2016-08-01 01:25:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @Ken_Rosenthal I appreciate you owning up to the mistake, and think everyone's entitled to make one.
760280199938224128 2016-08-01 01:04:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @jmartNYT @davidwchen "I hate it when people I hate love America."
760273059253104640 2016-08-01 00:36:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @owillis I actually think Trump RT'd actor James Woods saying only voter fraud and MSM bias could prevent his victory b4 Jones said this.
760272301027762176 2016-08-01 00:33:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @kenvogel He's going to hire the best people.  I mean, if you hire and fire everyone on earth, at some point you hired the best people.
760270908980207616 2016-08-01 00:28:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Top Trumpet response: "He didn't say that!"  2nd Trumpet response: "He said that because its true!"
759870910857818114 2016-07-31 21:58:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @getnickwright Also recruiting KD.
759771662946480128 2016-07-31 15:24:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife We're done but let me leave you with this: Trump will try to weasel out of the debates. So be ready to defend that gutlessness.
759771291863756800 2016-07-31 15:22:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife No. You are employing a double std to the candidates.
759770663326322689 2016-07-31 15:20:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife And there it is, the wild double standard.
759768801399365634 2016-07-31 15:12:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife Gawker lost. Pretend HRC attacked the Benghazi mom & made Trump's defamation comments. What's your reaction?  Apply it to DJT.
759765390914301952 2016-07-31 14:59:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @VLRAmyCurtis @DaveinTexas @GrantDossetto That's the point. It doesn't depend. Even if you think the anger is misplaced you don't snap back.
759764865607098368 2016-07-31 14:57:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @markmobility I think pro-Putin numbers will rise rapidly as Trumpets get on board.
759764248004132864 2016-07-31 14:54:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife He's also said he wants to expand defamation laws.  He seeks to make it unlawful to criticize him.
759763470287941632 2016-07-31 14:51:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife Nope. I've told people they were wrong about shit but I've never suggested that their rights be restricted.
759762825476648960 2016-07-31 14:49:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias "There is no Russian domination of Eastern Ukraine."
759762272562483204 2016-07-31 14:46:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinMKruse @JustAnotherRich "I know Von Papen is supported by the NSDAP but Groener isn't nearly left wing enough for me."
759759781158526976 2016-07-31 14:37:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @eryourlife He has right to speak. Also he ASKED if Trump had ever read the Constitution. You Trumpets really hate free speech huh?
759759088494387201 2016-07-31 14:34:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens @eryourlife Both sides have right to comment. Trump is saying people who disagree with him don't have right to say so.
759758763477741572 2016-07-31 14:32:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @nwfisch Fact: you're a tubby Trumpet who points to 1866 because he can't defend his candidate's actions yesterday.
759758330877255680 2016-07-31 14:31:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @nwfisch Khan asked if Trump had read the Constitution not said he hadn't. Trump is lying about that on top of everything.
759501692391927808 2016-07-30 21:31:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @steriana Whoever gets the most votes in a state gets its electoral votes (except ME and NE by CD), doesn't need to be 50%.

758852115393486848 2016-07-28 02:30:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Possible (unintended?) benefit: Hillary is a weaker speaker than Obamas/Bill, but I assume she'll be better than that speech.
758851445412114435 2016-07-28 02:27:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom Yeah the speech was pretty dull.

758849818210873344 2016-07-28 02:21:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @rickklein Fair point; Trump kids' speeches focused exclusively on their father's endless fodder-for-the-tabloids affairs. Oh wait.
758842596047237122 2016-07-28 01:52:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom No those guys are more engaging.
758841215198437376 2016-07-28 01:46:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @jameshohmann 10,000 protestors and blood on the streets vs. a few chants from 57 grumpy people.  You think those are comparable?
758838019117846528 2016-07-28 01:34:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZekeJMiller I read somewhere that some of Bernie's delegates are more affiliated with the leftwing protest movement than any party.
758835554637127680 2016-07-28 01:24:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonlovett So proud of the Democratic Party right now.  That was moving and important.

758699604950994944 2016-07-28 16:24:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @HowardKurtz Saying "I was just kidding about wanting attacks" is not a real defense anyway.  Apply same std to Trump you'd apply to HRC.

758697169599594499 2016-07-28 16:14:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro A discussion of the clothing choices on the Democratic ticket, and its about Kaine, not Hillary.  Kind of great.
758694465863163905 2016-07-28 16:03:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @EWErickson Fair enough.
758680003873640448 2016-07-28 15:06:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @EWErickson See link-Erick urged ppl to buy coat hangers to use for self-abortions. He's OK w/ abortion, as long as its unsafe.
758518877055705088 2016-07-27 04:26:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @mmurraypolitics Agreed, but RIP your mentions for saying it.

758494743940608001 2016-07-27 02:50:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbouie Yeah that was unexpected and sort of great.
758493111555198977 2016-07-27 02:43:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @greggutfeld The only thing that would have been better is if you had said "Believe me!" then it'd have been perfect.
758492583362387968 2016-07-27 02:41:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @tonyschwartz Thanks for speaking up.  The Trumpets are about to come for you---they hate criticism of their God-Emperor---so be ready.
758479103825547264 2016-07-27 01:48:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @WhiteHouse Great!  Glad you're doing well economically, just like the country!  Isn't it great to be doing well?

758474763505324032 2016-07-27 01:30:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @byelin Melania's plagiarism might actually have been a net negative for Democrats given Biden's past issue with it.
758464781699325953 2016-07-27 00:51:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill Calling her "Muse" seems like a nod to Michelle being her muse.

758461434795667456 2016-07-27 00:37:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @ajjaffe Is it true that some of them are regular Dems calling to complain the DNC is being too nice to Sanders ("not an actual Dem!")?
758458516671635456 2016-07-27 00:26:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @JenniferJJacobs Wow, I hate having to listen to my own voicemails, having to do this sounds like an undiscovered circle of hell.

758429128282419201 2016-07-27 22:29:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @JamesOKeefeIII Against you (?), I mean (no blue checkmark so you could be an O'Keefe imposter, which would be funny).
758428407172517888 2016-07-27 22:26:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @JamesOKeefeIII Indeed!  Confused this one---with a req'd apology---w/ the defamation suit against him by former co-worker Daniel Francisco.
758422402183237633 2016-07-27 22:02:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @robbysoave @JamesOKeefeIII @AtomicElbow1 @sirfith Pleaded down to avoid trial. Then agreed to pay 100k to ACORN worker for lying about her.
758417061689163776 2016-07-27 21:41:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @JimCameron I don't get the deniers.  Summers used to have days that were too hot, now we have weeks that are too hot.

758400155330551810 2016-07-27 20:34:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox And stuff like what happened to Mookie is why you can't give games away like Farrell did yesterday.
758380671849025536 2016-07-27 19:16:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @dlin71 As the old saying goes, "Power calms, absolutely power calms absolutely."  People forget that.
758380269258706944 2016-07-27 19:15:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @Soxlunch Well he probably feels better about himself now.
758376856429088768 2016-07-27 19:01:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl Yeah.  And probably both wish that our 2016 choices would exercise more care with THEIR choices.
758376017249513473 2016-07-27 18:58:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl I'll be honest: when the Bushies deleted 6-22 million (depending on report) I was mildly irritated, that's it.
758375494291066880 2016-07-27 18:56:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @owillis For day 2 as well?
758374817183563776 2016-07-27 18:53:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl the poor security (or Russian skill) on our authorized servers, docs would be uncovered either way.  2/2
758374611021029376 2016-07-27 18:52:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl OK, I think that's as close as we're gonna get.  She made a bad choice, but due to poor govt security...1/2
758373673946324992 2016-07-27 18:49:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl Authorized servers that were hacked by Russia: State dept, Pentagon, DNC.
758373302050037762 2016-07-27 18:47:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @partyofthepeopl If HRC said "Well, I don't know where DJT's taxes are, but hey China if you do, you'll get a big reward" I'd be done w/ her
758372962206527488 2016-07-27 18:46:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl Even the GOP isn't trying to argue that.  Some GOPers are condemning, others are saying he was kidding.
758372736301277184 2016-07-27 18:45:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl From your silence about Issa, Pat McCarthy, & the Bush admin email "losses" you apply this only to HRC, right?

758370400745037825 2016-07-27 18:36:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl AND encouragement of theft is worse than bad security.  "That house is unlocked, be a shame if it was robbed."
758370086243545088 2016-07-27 18:34:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl And I think that was irresponsible.  Did you make the same comments about Issa and Pat McCarthy, or nah?
758367799685197824 2016-07-27 18:25:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl Were you also outraged at the Pentagon when Russia hacked them,, and with Issa ID'ing a covert CIA facility?

758363767730151428 2016-07-27 18:09:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl Word was "share" not "return."  Then he said maybe we should give them Crimea.  Even GOP has condemned.
758361980222578689 2016-07-27 18:02:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @mikeschnall @partyofthepeopl If Obama had encouraged Russia to hack Mitt, that'd have been treason. So is this.  Put country b4 party once.
758358759982845953 2016-07-27 17:49:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP_Planner Sounds absurd, but fairly tough to stop.  Do you make a rule that no one can fart?  How do you police said rule?
758357739772837888 2016-07-27 17:45:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC Guy's calling for cyberattacks on Americans and MSM members are like "have you thought about your son's political career?"
758357240722010112 2016-07-27 17:43:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @JohnKasich Tolerated? Forget tolerated, Trump is encouraging a hostile power to cyberattack Americans for his poly benefit.
758356748818276353 2016-07-27 17:41:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @HenricoCOtto They asked everybody...not just DJT voters...again, I'm fine with asking the Q for him as well, NBD.
758356478411493376 2016-07-27 17:40:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @washingtonpost @baseballcrank @soccerdhg Did he say "hack Mitt's email and release it"?
758355330187210752 2016-07-27 17:36:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @amandacarpenter I agree, but RIP your mentions Amanda.
758354706435452928 2016-07-27 17:33:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @MikeMitchNH Its a specific allegation made in a RNC speech by Carson, who once led the GOP POTUS primary polls.
758354335847690240 2016-07-27 17:32:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @HenricoCOtto That's OK (I assume you mean re DJT) but the Q is based on a specific allegation made in Carson's convention speech.
758353859534131200 2016-07-27 17:30:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @SpeakerRyan @JoyAnnReid Perfect example: imagine in 2012 if, after Mitt's debate comments, Obama publicly asked Russia to hack Mitt.
758353326576578561 2016-07-27 17:28:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @seanmdav Secure like the Pentagon?  http://www.stripes.com/news/us-military-suspects-russia-in-hack-of-pentagon-email-system-1.361872  or the satellite used by state and joint chiefs?http://www.stripes.com/news/europe/russian-hackers-siphoning-military-diplomatic-data-from-satellites-experts-say-1.367173
758350507379298304 2016-07-27 17:17:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @AriFleischer If, after Mitt had criticized Russia, Obama had said Russia should hack his email, everyone would have objected.
758348343005224960 2016-07-27 17:08:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @wikileaks @BostonGlobe @lisababy1124 She didn't let 4 people die.  Multiple Republican investigations have confirmed that.  Don't you care?
758344487919767553 2016-07-27 16:53:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @wikileaks @BostonGlobe @lisababy1124 I'd never support any candidate who encouraged a hostile foreign power to attack America in any way.
758342630304456705 2016-07-27 16:45:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @lisababy1124 He's repeated it on Twitter. He is serious. And treason is nothing to joke about anyway.
758340417435815936 2016-07-27 16:36:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @lisababy1124 I remember when Republicans rightly regarded what Trump just did as treason.

758332123170209793 2016-07-27 16:04:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomKott @JeffreyGoldberg @Buxom_Betty_ Perspective: I would withdraw my support from any candidate who did what Trump just did.
758329627337076737 2016-07-27 15:54:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomKott @JeffreyGoldberg @Buxom_Betty_ Trump just called 4 a hostile nation to do a cyberattack on America and release classified info.
758329627282542593 2016-07-27 15:54:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomKott @JeffreyGoldberg @Buxom_Betty_ Pretend for one minute it was Hillary who said this. Your reaction should be horrified for either.
758325865902059521 2016-07-27 15:39:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @TomKott @JeffreyGoldberg @Buxom_Betty_ They hacked DOD in 2015. They're quite skilled at it.
758324679245373440 2016-07-27 15:34:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC @PhilipRucker Look at the Trumpets defending it. They'd be baying for blood if it was Obama or Hillary who did that.

758148377464807425 2016-07-26 03:53:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd Love the passive voice on that.  Host of MTP and frequent MSNBC panel member can't help the narrative he chooses to push.

758139090000678912 2016-07-26 03:16:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @DemConvention @seanspicer Whereas GOP proved that #AllActorsMatter w/ Baio, Sabato Jr, the avocado actress, and 9th place finisher Omarosa.
758137623932080128 2016-07-26 03:11:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @StuPolitics @craasch Interestingly, wrong track was higher in 2012 as well, even on Election day.  Not always predictive.
758134056538165248 2016-07-26 02:56:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @KFCBarstool @AMuller65 She has sex on top of voters?  That seems awkward for the voters.  Do they try to leave?  I would try to leave.
758133570875514882 2016-07-26 02:55:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @KFCBarstool @AMuller65 Well, if they're still fucking at their age, I guess they got that going for them.
758132899820339200 2016-07-26 02:52:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox Someone should mention to Farrell that pitchers should be monitored during the game in real time because I don't think he knows.
758130081772351488 2016-07-26 02:41:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @ericgeller I suppose he feels like that's been covered.

758116288677842944 2016-07-26 01:46:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek I remember thinking at the time that it made him seem unserious.  Now candidates reference their dicks during debates.
758113866219794432 2016-07-26 01:36:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @JDCH52 @MeghanMcCain I respect your choice to turn off the TV.  Why should people be banned by law from a choice about keeping pregnancy?
758112791815294976 2016-07-26 01:32:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @BernieSanders @CBSNews I liked the guy who said "I'm being silenced" to a reporter live on the air.  Clearly believed it too.  Amazing.
758109916921946112 2016-07-26 01:21:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @nytimes Content: DNC staffers didn't like Bernie, wished he'd go away, sometimes thought about doing stuff, then ate lunch.

758104169148391424 2016-07-26 00:58:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb Gotta be unpredictable.  Fed min wage would be $10.10 one day, $15 the next, then no minimum and "make good deals."

758087576997593088 2016-07-26 23:52:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBCNews Man, its nice to have some fun at a convention, instead of alternating b/w prison threats and death threats.

758075005057896448 2016-07-26 23:02:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @daveweigel Is the "election difference" that HRC 2008 suffered a much closer defeat than Bernie 2016?  I'm guessing no, its something else.

758057478672166917 2016-07-26 21:52:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @TalKopan @CNNPolitics Example 1 billion of why US-based banks stopped lending to Trump and he had to reach out to Gazprom.

758005490047561728 2016-07-26 18:26:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @GeorgeWill Wouldn't Hillary be the Bush I to Obama's Reagan?  Riding to victory on the POTUS predecessor's popularity and weak opponent?

757997518521110528 2016-07-26 17:54:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @maggieNYT @oliverdarcy Not surprising.  DJT using the pwr he has now to tame the press & said he'll change laws to do so once in office.

757720223046856705 2016-07-25 23:32:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @KailiJoy @MainelyInsane He lost by 3 million votes.  He lost A-A voters by 50 points.  You can't do that & win the D nom.
757715441905233920 2016-07-25 23:13:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @owillis But Diane FEELS like that's what the emails say.  And who are you to deny her validation for those feelings based only on facts?
757715139902734336 2016-07-25 23:12:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefix It'll bounce lower after the email theft, then rise again, but I don't think it gets back to 90%.
757714858926276608 2016-07-25 23:11:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @este_fana Sanders and his entire campaign team has publicly agreed with this.  Do you think they're all lying?
757714325725388800 2016-07-25 23:09:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @este_fana I did.  DNC staffers behaved unprofessionally.  That doesn't determine votes.  If it did, the GOP nominee would be Jeb Bush.
757713421567602688 2016-07-25 23:05:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @este_fana How did the DNC "derail his campaign?"  He ran until the end.  The suggestion that all HRC voters are hoodwinked rubes is absurd.
757709886859816960 2016-07-25 22:51:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @slimwess @este_fana Sanders lost b/c he wasn't able to equal HRC's connection with minorities, and thus she got over 3 million more votes.
757709058719617024 2016-07-25 22:48:11 UTC <bosdcla14> Same problem as GOP---if you feed ppl garbage & claim it as truth, don't be surprised if they get a taste for trash.https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/757689570192482304

757700549038878721 2016-07-25 22:14:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Possibly within the party.  But no Dem has ever shouted down a GOP SOTU, the way Miller did with his "You lie!" to Obama.
757692853996834816 2016-07-25 21:43:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports If Dems are smart, they beg and plead with Bernie backer and former DNC vice chair Tulsi Gabbard to take the gavel.

757653150270525440 2016-07-25 19:06:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @DrJillStein @OwenRBroadhurst But isn't the fact that Owen doesn't FEEL that was said more impt than whether it WAS said?
757652421984169984 2016-07-25 19:03:08 UTC <bosdcla14> Straight out of "The Plot Against America" but set in the present day...https://twitter.com/markfollman/status/757630498550063104
757651773322465280 2016-07-25 19:00:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ehananoki Considering Sanders supporters are now booing Sanders, maybe they can be talked into this as well?
757650962773266432 2016-07-25 18:57:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @nytpolitics @tripgabriel @ScottFaldon I assume he'd just say "false flag!"  Probably argue Hillary hacked herself to blame Russia.
757648440616562688 2016-07-25 18:47:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @hughhewitt Putin's placement of a Russian intelligence asset as POTUS has to be among most amazing ops in history.
757647372969054208 2016-07-25 18:43:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @RichardEngel I think we see those in October, at which point a Russian intelligence asset becomes President of the United States.
757646118410870784 2016-07-25 18:38:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @Turtle6Turtle Trump campaign admitted theft.  Come on, keep up, we've always been at war w/ Eastasia and allied w/ Russia I mean Eurasia.
757645776243732480 2016-07-25 18:36:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @BetteMidler That's funny, but it also feels like something that happened at least a year ago.
757644842847444992 2016-07-25 18:33:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @RichardEngel @jpfoster65 No.  Both are bad.  One is an attack by a foreign power hostile to the US on the American political system.
757643740798341120 2016-07-25 18:28:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @thedailybeast @NoahShachtman @Julie_Loeck From who?  Guy's basically vanished from the discourse from 2012 on.
757642937320648704 2016-07-25 18:25:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @NoahShachtman @CTyrannus True, and a demonstration of Putin's consummate skill. A long game by him close to fruition with Trump's election.
757636902598029313 2016-07-25 18:01:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe That's an incredible photo.
757636744980238336 2016-07-25 18:00:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @MSNBC @mmurraypolitics Why would Trump get nothing done?  Has a GOP House and GOP Senate.
757627555838951424 2016-07-25 17:24:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @dlin71 "AND MY VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO I GAVE A HONORARY POSITION ON MY CAMPAIGN TO BECAUSE SHE'S SOMEONE WHO DESERVES HONORS AM I RIGHT?"
757606826259079168 2016-07-25 16:01:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @ezlusztig It is strange how it happens.
757606352025812992 2016-07-25 16:00:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonlovett "Neurotic"?  You've tweeted over 50,000 times, but are unfamiliar with basic twitter conventions, huh?  Sure.
757369088104472576 2016-07-24 00:17:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonlovett Also tweeted Bernie's name as (Bernie).  I suppose writing it (((Bernie))) would lose all deniability.
757360594320097280 2016-07-24 23:43:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton @60Minutes There's some truth in this.  Nobody cares the Bushies deleted 22 million emails, not even liberals.
757333367171878912 2016-07-24 21:55:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @DWStweets @alfranken RIP your mentions Al.  DWS falls short of Elanie Benes heading up J Peterman--"thx 4 a job...done."
757331080630325248 2016-07-24 21:46:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @Dena A good example of how she's bad at her job.  Glad she will no longer be doing it.
757326896031858688 2016-07-24 21:29:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @paulkrugman Good, she was very bad at her job.  Bernie supporter & former DNC vice chair Tulsi Gabbard would be good replacement.
757322788331884544 2016-07-24 21:13:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @KirstenPowers Trump does seem to think that quid pro quo harassment ("sleep w/ me if you want the promotion") is fine.
757281465906237440 2016-07-24 18:29:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @newtgingrich So he's eligible once the law gets waived. Which means he's ineligible now. Words have meaning.
757258012708921344 2016-07-24 16:55:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @fashymofo @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 Well, if you can't produce evidence beyond the voices in your head, I'd say we're done.  T&Ps.
757257057649033216 2016-07-24 16:52:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @fashymofo @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 As soon as you link that transcript, you win. Of course, if it never happened, you're just a liar.
757256574226145283 2016-07-24 16:50:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @fashymofo @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 What! Wow.  Could you link the transcript where Wright said ovenworthy?
757255757213470720 2016-07-24 16:46:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 Nah I don't wanna die in an oven or for others to do so.  Confusing me with this fella? https://twitter.com/fashymofo/status/756395187220328448
757255083327262720 2016-07-24 16:44:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 You seem to think a lot of people scream when they are talking or writing.  Is that based on something?
757254137935310849 2016-07-24 16:40:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 Do you see a difference b/w "not anymore, Jews" and "criticism of the Iran deal is based on false claims" or nah?
757253150294183936 2016-07-24 16:36:34 UTC <bosdcla14> "I'm the only one!"? From a guy who has praised Putin, Kim Jung-Un, and Saddam Hussein, that's a call to extinguish freedom.
757252821892730880 2016-07-24 16:35:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 None of them used the language you suggested.  You're saying that if you use a secret Obama decoder ring they did?
757251510543618048 2016-07-24 16:30:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet @Maverick_SS_49 The non-screamed quote in the link doesn't mention Jews or traitors.  Its a comment from Obama to Jon Stewart. ???
757249384123817985 2016-07-24 16:21:36 UTC <bosdcla14> It was the shrieking of an incompetent authoritarian who'd use POTUS pwr to respond to every personal slight he's ever felt.
757247406266130432 2016-07-24 16:13:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens Did you not watch his convention speech?  Clearest expression of his belief that America is awful.  Bad guy.
757243675659280384 2016-07-24 15:58:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @GenFlynn I'd personally say RT-ing an anti-Semite saying "not anymore, Jews" is a new low, but I guess its now the official Trump message.
757233371235831808 2016-07-24 15:17:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @Redistrict This is why I'm puzzled with Q-polls having their white % of the vote up from 2012.
757231062095237121 2016-07-24 15:08:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoyAnnReid @wikileaks "When we say 'we open governments' we weren't including the ones we're working with!  Those shouldn't be discussed."
757035109253992448 2016-07-23 02:10:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @invest1983 What type of attorney doesn't know that plaintiff in slander case has BoP and that all defense needs to show is GFB?
757033648310722560 2016-07-23 02:04:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @invest1983 Marlins man?
757023854506061824 2016-07-23 01:25:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @invest1983 Another trumpet who hates free speech and wants to use courts to stop it.  Bad news: true statements can't be slander.
756986301086261248 2016-07-23 22:56:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @wikileaks "Sure, an autocrat's ownership of Trump is neat, but did you see what the assistant DNC scheduler wrote about lunch?"
756896445576413184 2016-07-23 16:59:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @KSoltisAnderson @Redistrict @stevenfhayward I'd say "is working with Putin to subvert US interests" is new as is "thinks US not great"
756687327058014208 2016-07-22 03:08:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @EdWGillespie Bad news Ed, official GOP press release says Kaine is anti-liberal.
756668812187963392 2016-07-22 01:54:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @lgbillbolling You may like him more than the left!
756668188717420544 2016-07-22 01:52:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @JamesPindell I hate this election.

756653191744200704 2016-07-22 00:52:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS Underrated campaigner. Come from behind win over Kilgore was very impressive.
756652916258340864 2016-07-22 00:51:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @timkaine @HillaryClinton @CecileRichards @whynotsara He is observant Catholic but pro-choice in terms of law as his vote record shows.
756616145633968128 2016-07-22 22:25:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnKasich @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @MarkHalperin I saw a comedy sketch where a candidate ran attack ads after winning...now IRL I guess.
756614872578854912 2016-07-22 22:20:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @MarkHalperin @dragoon215 Trump changes platform to be pro-Putin, Trump attacks NATO, Russians hack DNC. There you go, its been discussed.
756607990212407296 2016-07-22 21:52:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Years from now, people will still speak in hushed tones about the avocado actress.
756603943589818368 2016-07-22 21:36:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @fleetadmiralj Agreed.   Edwards also shows how little effect VPs have: NC stayed red in 2004, yet swung blue next cycle.
756602892199469056 2016-07-22 21:32:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @fleetadmiralj Two words: John Edwards.  Two more: Joe Lieberman.
756601370438926336 2016-07-22 21:26:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @SopanDeb @deb4liberty I have seen that covered, but the media's in a tough spot.  Nobody lies as much as Trump, it is hard to keep up.
756600618437836800 2016-07-22 21:23:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @stranahan "Anytime there's a shooting in the Western world, attacks on Trump are inappropriate."  Cool cool.
756576126298759168 2016-07-22 19:46:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @loan2own No, I'm not for Putin's puppet Trump. Pop quiz: what is the one part of the GOP platform that Trump made sure was changed?
756575601008312320 2016-07-22 19:44:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @loan2own I see silly shitgibbons who shrugged at Madrid but now say "see, 6 dead in Munich, Trump was right about America!"
756573210217476096 2016-07-22 19:34:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 Best example of this was Edwards.  NC was becoming a swingy state (went Obama in 2008), but he couldn't swing it in 2004.
756572743764631553 2016-07-22 19:32:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro @loan2own When did Munich become part of the US?
756543398048215040 2016-07-22 17:36:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @BettyBowers @forgione_andrew Good, so we agree that he wants to fuck his daughter ("date"= so PC!) and he just slapped her on the ass.
756539912233549828 2016-07-22 17:22:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @BettyBowers @forgione_andrew Trump's repeatedly expressed his sexual attraction to Ivanka.  We shouldn't take him at his word?
756538248533389312 2016-07-22 17:15:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @MJBJD California, with only Dem officeholders: 4.1% growth in 2015.  Kansas, only GOP officeholders: 0.2% growth.  T&Ps to KS.
756536654832164864 2016-07-22 17:09:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP The level of insanity right now is astounding.  We're strong, but we're like an elephant baying loudly b/c we think we saw a mouse.
756526159009984512 2016-07-22 16:27:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @dandrezner I'm still confused.  Are there conservative Bolshevik commie dudes?  How about moderate Mensheviks? Can you be a lib capitalist?
756523525259849730 2016-07-22 16:17:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton I enjoy Pence's "what's wrong with him?" look in the background.
756498354700378112 2016-07-22 14:37:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @timkaine @HillaryClinton @krystalball Look he's fine, but compared to Warren or Perez he'd be somewhat disappointing.
756338374353489920 2016-07-21 04:01:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @RadioFreeTom I'd point out that if the polls are that tight in RI, we're almost certainly screwed anyway.
756335813546344448 2016-07-21 03:51:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @OfficialJLD @mtsmale1 Are you talking to Julia or to Trump?
756327579116646404 2016-07-21 03:18:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @lucia_graves I would also note that, as US population rises annually, that means the % rate decline is larger than the numerical decline.
756323702439088128 2016-07-21 03:03:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefutureyousee @JamesPindell @jpovia Is there a country that has not been compromised by terrorism?  I feel like no.
756321862263660544 2016-07-21 02:55:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @HuffPostWomen @emmaladyrose @ThatTanya He's repeatedly talked about how he'd like to have sex with Ivanka if she wasn't his daughter.
756321100066324480 2016-07-21 02:52:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @TheRickWilson Trade deficit 500 billion, not 800.  Iran deal signed 6 months b4 sailor incident, not after.  Lie upon lie.
756306945485574144 2016-07-21 01:56:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis 11-2 since the 21-2 loss.  Got rid of all the bad baseball for weeks in one night.  Good plan.
756298673034670080 2016-07-21 01:23:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @aubreyjwhelan A leftwing(ish) pro-NATO protest sign...I think that might be a first.
756296415278608385 2016-07-21 01:14:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @jacko2323 Both the avocado actress and the pseudoscience pill lady are involved in MLM businesses, I'm sure they pitched a few people.
756287968260657152 2016-07-21 00:41:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @Redistrict The full theme for tonight is actually "Make America One Race and One Religion Again" but its kinda long so they cut it a bit.
756279866991915008 2016-07-21 00:09:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @DouthatNYT Like an artist whose work grows better with suffering, I think you're on fire in your analysis of this convention & its meaning.
755981332728066049 2016-07-20 04:22:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @moody @CNNPolitics @Johnnyyumaaz Like Trump educated us tonight on how he'll leave our NATO allies high and dry if Russia invades.
755980815918436353 2016-07-20 04:20:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @moody @CNNPolitics @Johnnyyumaaz Wow so he got booed at the RNC for supporting the Constitution?  I stand corrected thanks for clarifying.
755979368619384832 2016-07-20 04:15:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @moody @CNNPolitics @Johnnyyumaaz Newt also says Cruz endorsed Trump!
755959541703913472 2016-07-20 02:56:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe I always find this comment a bit strange.  Obama's much more popular than Hillary. Why link them?  Say she's worse or whatever.
755956730983440384 2016-07-20 02:45:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @BillHemmer "We had no idea Ted was still upset Trump called him a liar, his wife ugly, and his dad a killer."  OK
755954037091028995 2016-07-20 02:34:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @tedcruz @newtgingrich @cspan I feel like we got it Newt, thanks though.
755953529546604545 2016-07-20 02:32:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @sistertoldjah Captain Obvious is a good choice.  "I will not be endorsing the guy who called me a liar, my wife ugly, and my dad a killer."
755952639813095424 2016-07-20 02:28:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Who you gonna believe, Newt or your lying ears?
755952035267084288 2016-07-20 02:26:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @jack_welch DJT called his wife ugly and his dad a killer.  How stupid do you have to be to not see this coming if you've done that?
755951721298337792 2016-07-20 02:25:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @KatyTurNBC @BraddJaffy @Vilestyle Why not?  Got to spit in the eye of the guy who called his wife ugly and his dad a killer.
755949957333393409 2016-07-20 02:18:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq I'd have respected him if he ended the speech "and Donald, the Cruzes send their regards."
755948619388157952 2016-07-20 02:12:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq Bah. "I like Donald Trump.  He's a friend.  I salute him.  He speaks the truth."  Cruz repeatedly during the campaign, etc.
755939527173091328 2016-07-20 01:36:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @RosieGray If they actually wanted to do some stagecraft, prepared text could not have endorsement and then he could endorse on stage.
755927939753979904 2016-07-20 00:50:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @DavidCornDC I had this question when the Ark. gov bragged they had their lowest unemployment ever.  So, lower than under any GOP POTUS...
755900716087029760 2016-07-20 23:02:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek Those branches/leaves that dude has on his helmet is great camouflage for the sandy terrain he's in, totally blends in.
755897298899439616 2016-07-20 22:48:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @JarrettHill Not sure why they're laughing. You scooped the entire media on the biggest convention story using only a laptop and your brain.
755883342847840257 2016-07-20 21:53:27 UTC <bosdcla14> This is nice to see.https://twitter.com/latimes/status/755881263597228032
755628874013274112 2016-07-19 05:02:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @DouthatNYT @rawaustin Yes this is twitter, where takes are strong and full of terrors.
755621252656541696 2016-07-19 04:32:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm "I have a dream of one people, one nation, and one leader."
755614814295117825 2016-07-19 04:06:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @KFCBarstool @Thepatsway @SlurdIsTheWord I hate the name, but if you get paid for one piece & try to re-use part of it magazines will flip.
755614259308965888 2016-07-19 04:04:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME Writer seems to have written the speech, so recycling rather than plagiarizing.
755607339315499008 2016-07-19 03:36:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @fbuckley Political conventions are not like concerts for old rock bands.  Everyone wants to see original material not retreads.
755606278425096192 2016-07-19 03:32:29 UTC <bosdcla14> I had no idea the Trumps were so committed to recycling, at least with the words of other people.https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/755601024908300288
755603613574057984 2016-07-19 03:21:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @tomdelbeccaro You realize your nominee says America isn't great right?
755599477960880132 2016-07-19 03:05:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @DouthatNYT The avocado actress wasn't so bad.
755598010160025600 2016-07-19 02:59:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZekeJMiller Well maybe its in God's prepared text, urging people to battle Lucifer did you think of that?
755596757044637696 2016-07-19 02:54:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @pourmecoffee Area man speaks at gathering.
755596589490581504 2016-07-19 02:53:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @RameshPonnuru I'm thinking about buying an avocado though, so she has that going for her.
755595284239949824 2016-07-19 02:48:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @nickconfessore Maybe but I doubt many Dems would be able to name Lee Atwater.  Hating someone who's long dead is uniquely GOP.
755594536894668800 2016-07-19 02:45:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @petridishes Being pro-guacamole seems controversial at this convention.
755585085894647808 2016-07-19 02:08:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME He's wearing a suit jacket.  There's also a suit jacket on his chair.  Someone please explain thanks.
755580576166404096 2016-07-19 01:50:22 UTC <bosdcla14> "Pectoral, maybe the shoulder, we can't really speculate as to what it is..."  Dave O'Brien.  Um...
755567219371679745 2016-07-19 00:57:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @JezebelButler He was planning to campaign on blocking Garland at one point so I'd say the latter.
755540206862774272 2016-07-19 23:09:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @mtaibbi Jeremy Piven is Christie's son?
755494847704731649 2016-07-19 20:09:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Hypothesis: Stated policy positions matter less than  encouragement of violence by supporters against largely minority protestors.
755492594281349120 2016-07-19 20:00:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @BGWhite42 Reince ("I'd fire the guy who wrote it") and Corey ("Manafort should be fired if he knew") are part of the shitlibs now?  So hot!
755442892978532353 2016-07-19 16:43:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME @HillaryClinton @BGWhite42 You are an amazing, beautiful flower, and you should never change.  Stay golden!
755441346408624128 2016-07-19 16:37:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @gabrielsherman @MadaGasp Can't be done.  She was just lying either then or now.  Probably then, but possibly now to please the Murdochs.
755434625745367040 2016-07-19 16:10:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME @HillaryClinton @BGWhite42 Oh no!  https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/755267953491271681  Thoughts and prayers to your family, if you have a family.
755432010848411648 2016-07-19 16:00:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME @HillaryClinton @BGWhite42 Trumpets defending theft of speech about working hard are the best. 
755424220209745921 2016-07-19 15:29:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @tomdelbeccaro I can't believe this tweet is still up.  When it gets deleted, I won't frown because its over, I'll smile b/c it happened.
755423332275675136 2016-07-19 15:25:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @stuartpstevens Asking the Trump campaign to use  "mistakenly" or "apologize" is like asking a dog to walk on hind legs.  Both?  Forget it.
755395631452082176 2016-07-19 13:35:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @GovChristie @TODAYshow "I was apart from my wife for thirty minutes and was faithful for 93% of that time." 
755298362161627136 2016-07-19 07:08:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @MsPackyetti I am glad someone else thought this quote belonged here. Great minds etc.
755293697768501248 2016-07-18 06:50:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @clmazin @jbarro @ang_yow @MSNBC @Lawrence Boom roasted. Thoughts and prayers to Angie's family if she has one.
755271873143767046 2016-07-18 05:23:41 UTC <bosdcla14> I was born a poor black child. #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes
755262146028593152 2016-07-18 04:45:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum Especially since she claimed she write the speech.
755261338289512448 2016-07-18 04:41:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME She claimed she wrote the speech when Matt Lauer interviewed her and Donald.
755260340288442368 2016-07-18 04:37:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet I would read that.
755256466961858560 2016-07-18 04:22:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump She liked Michelle Obama's speech so much she decided to repeat it?  Hot.
755254235390803968 2016-07-18 04:13:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @JarrettHill Great so show where Michelle took it from if it's so common. Except you can't because you're lying.
755250954816016386 2016-07-18 04:00:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @Husaria @badler @TrumpTalk930 Sheehan didn't speak at convention you silly shitgibbon.
755226390467928064 2016-07-18 02:22:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports [Jim Ross voice]: "GOOD GAWD THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S MUSIC!!!!!"
755225134206554113 2016-07-18 02:17:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias I mean, Pence hasn't technically been nominated yet...
755223917791358977 2016-07-18 02:13:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeedBen Thoughts & prayers for your mentions.
755222014382571520 2016-07-18 02:05:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @IngrahamAngle This convention is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful convention I've known in my life.
755221693564588032 2016-07-18 02:04:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @migold And sweaty and grunty.
755221169842683905 2016-07-18 02:02:12 UTC <bosdcla14> Pence WAS for TPP.  Since his selection, he's flipped on Muslim ban, and seems to have flipped on Iraq War, what's one more?
755220837972738048 2016-07-18 02:00:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo Well, if we have a nuked-out country w/ a plague of locusts o'er the land, racial disparities will not be as big a problem.
755208635081306114 2016-07-18 01:12:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnFugelsang Ouch.  Thoughts and Prayers to CB4T's family, if he has a family.
755207402115379200 2016-07-18 01:07:30 UTC <bosdcla14> I hear he's quite humble, especially for someone who is a great lawyer & owns over 100 horses & has many famous friends, not to brag.
755204708646531072 2016-07-18 00:56:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @DoktorZoom Well their leader has a similar interest in chairs.https://twitter.com/lbaris/status/754830808016416768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw
755200512157331456 2016-07-18 00:40:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @KyleKulinski Meh.  In 04, GOP convinced itself Kerry didn't earn medals, in  08 that Obama's ineligible, now Hill is a killer.  So it goes.
755188077182586880 2016-07-18 23:50:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @crampell Really? Sen. Dorgan's 1999 speech against G-S repeal predicts the crisis that will follow all the way to bailouts.  Lucky guesses?
755065291839672320 2016-07-18 15:42:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @BuzzFeedAndrew Attacks overseas & Dem POTUS: POTUS to blame for attacks.  Attacks at home & GOP POTUS: POTUS not to blame for attacks.
754339764925411329 2016-07-16 15:39:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @darreldrowland But Trump's gonna make CA and NY competitive, remember?
754160675891535874 2016-07-15 03:48:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Just b/c its not legal for him to seek that funding?  Wasn't legal to solicit 4 foreign $$, but that didn't stop the emails to MPs
754120704086245376 2016-07-15 01:09:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Nonexistent social media strategy.  Where's the mobile game?  Edrogan Go featuring adorable mascot PikaCoup.
754117412576829440 2016-07-15 00:56:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias "Thank you for the congratulations; now I'd like to replace my VP."
754109972456189952 2016-07-15 00:26:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @ConspiracyStuff @SYSKPodcast @holbtastic Its July.  The US election is in November.  Define "around."  Around is +-4 months?
754104110996008960 2016-07-15 00:03:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @AllMattNYT Turkish military needed to urge its citizens to play Edrogan Go, with a a cute online mascot named Pikacoup?
754102409434050561 2016-07-15 23:56:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @KarlreMarks @RichardHibbert I guess the BBC is of the opinion that Turkey is a little bit pregnant.
754102031057420288 2016-07-15 23:55:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @DaliDager According to DOD yes.  https://twitter.com/jessicaschulb/status/754101678996066304  All the events seem to be in Ankara and Istanbul.
754101185393537024 2016-07-15 23:51:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @KarlreMarks I think in reference to divided nature of military on the coup, and the fact that it seems to be failing.  Real one would work?
754100484475019264 2016-07-15 23:49:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @benshapiro Technically, the worst outcome would have been Obama backing the failed coup & then left holding a shitbag, a la Venezuela 2002.
754094366252085249 2016-07-15 23:24:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Venezuela deja vu: a leader the US dislikes strengthened by a botched coup. At least this time we didn't back the failed plot.
754091745038573568 2016-07-15 23:14:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @NoahCRothman Trying to avoid what happened in Venezuela after Bush backed a failed coup and left America holding a bag of shit.
754080320261984257 2016-07-15 22:28:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @nblaser18 @zetacontinuum I think he means its terrifying that the are large groups of pro and anti-coup citizens.  Suggests civil strife.
754048351784415232 2016-07-15 20:21:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @EsotericCD @Zaggs Or like stomach stapling.  Could help them be healthier or could be a complete disaster.  Status quo gone either way tho.
754047316626018305 2016-07-15 20:17:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @ChuckPfarrer Out of the country or just out of Istanbul?  Saw one report saying he was vacationing in Bodrum.
754047007287746560 2016-07-15 20:16:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @EsotericCD @Zaggs I suppose look at what happened in Venezuela after the failed coup during Bush II, and then add Islamists?
754045433018667008 2016-07-15 20:10:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @piersmorgan Turkish military may be tired of Erdoan's soft touch on ISIS, breaking the peace with the Kurds, and banning criticism of him.
754038603034927104 2016-07-15 19:43:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls @Darph_Nader This seems low.  Also his supporters would say the kid was asking for it.
754038113568116737 2016-07-15 19:41:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @petridishes @SageAntone It went up in the last Bush budget.  I suppose Obama's also to blame for not protecting us on 9/11 and Iraq?
753994699984121856 2016-07-15 16:48:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet I think @thinkprogress got there first.  https://twitter.com/pbump/status/753993322176413696
753990729521782784 2016-07-15 16:32:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @Stonekettle Tough morning for Christie.https://twitter.com/BarstoolTrent/status/753969174389534720
753987328897486848 2016-07-15 16:19:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @petridishes @SageAntone Nothing says bad governance like a soaring stock market, declining deficits & declining unemployment! GOP hates it!
753813036381515776 2016-07-14 04:46:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @jonfavs @danpfeiffer @HeerJeet That's become a Keeping It 1600 tradition.
753795665843453953 2016-07-14 03:37:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @oliverdarcy We're going to lose a lot of our intelligence if our analysts aren't allowed to visit ISIS websites.
753752014723555328 2016-07-14 00:44:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @politicoalex @ShaneGoldmacher This letter had to get leaked by Adelson, right?  The GOP wouldn't leak it since its so humiliating.
753750506040721408 2016-07-14 00:38:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes @Joelvegas12 Just funny, like banning AKs but OKing nukes.  Also not sure what you mean w/ CA, should we be shooting the wildfires?
753743703538229248 2016-07-14 00:11:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @SaraMurray @remingtonhill Trump may have told Pence he was the pick but that means little and Pence has a IN-GOV deadline tomorrow.
753743168944812033 2016-07-14 00:09:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @DecampSusan @kuramanga I think she just wanted to use that GIF.  You have to admit it is a fun GIF.
753740674860658688 2016-07-14 23:59:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @marinamaral2 This is great.  I also applaud the choice to go blue.  Sometimes a little artistic license makes it feel more true.
753736001420394497 2016-07-14 23:40:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @6ae025af2132401 @costareports @dettas61 What's that matter to Trump?  See Pence the same as TU students: shouldn't they have known by now?
753728179911614464 2016-07-14 23:09:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @joe_sheehan He and Clay can hang out after they both have their seasons end due to injury, I suppose.
753727581799583744 2016-07-14 23:07:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports Cool so he's probably got some babysitting gigs lined up for the future.
753725914215690241 2016-07-14 23:00:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm I feel like he'd get along well with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
753720236570849280 2016-07-14 22:38:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @sdutdennislin Hurts but I can't disagree with it.  Sox are going to score 900 runs and had absolute black holes for 2 rotation spots.
753651848565755904 2016-07-14 18:06:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @WesleyLowery @TruxtonZyker @NorthSTLCounty Sounds like you've got some ex-wife experience.  Can't say I do, still married.  T&Ps to you.
753646971051585536 2016-07-14 17:46:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @WesleyLowery @NorthSTLCounty @TruxtonZyker Sure sure.  Whatever you need to hold onto, buddy, whatever you need.  Best wishes.
753424783216214016 2016-07-13 03:04:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @PatrickRuffini Well, it will be the BEST Friday, everyone says so, we're doing SO WELL with Fridays...
753411847265525760 2016-07-13 02:12:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Shouldn't Young be #7, in honor of the 7 minutes he played tonight?
753363343981752320 2016-07-13 22:59:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @gehrig38 Because these statistics are not true?  For example the "Crime Statistics Bureau-San Francisco" doesn't exist?
753356829950828544 2016-07-13 22:33:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @TerriCary Is that a quote of Mitt Romney supporters in October 2012?
753356223907450882 2016-07-13 22:31:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @FoxNews @jeffcoco13 @BillNye73 Ooh, is it time to unskew the polls again? I gotta find my unskewing boots!
753353625410252801 2016-07-13 22:21:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @angelaeagle @PA @Alexand16594851 Did lay the groundwork for the exit of Scotland from the UK, but hey, nobody's perfect, right?
753348273327382528 2016-07-13 21:59:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @SylvanLane @MattZetaBaen And better pay/incentives.  Right now, @LAPDChiefBeck has been unable to recruit up to # of officers authorized.
753300391966617600 2016-07-13 18:49:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP_Politics @mouthym3rc Well, Trump invited him to speak at the convention, so I guess Cleveland?
753298993887580160 2016-07-13 18:44:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports So he's actually filed a lawsuit?
753298894071619585 2016-07-13 18:43:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @AP_Politics @mouthym3rc Other reports back AP, say it is Sam Nunberg, longtime confident of Roger Stone.  Tough break, T&Ps to you.
753287482754478080 2016-07-13 17:58:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @WesleyLowery @NorthSTLCounty Its been days, which means they showed Castile's ID to witnesses who said not him.  Again, so sorry for you.
753270068184616960 2016-07-13 16:49:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @WesleyLowery @NorthSTLCounty So sorry for you.  http://www.snopes.com/philando-castile-was-not-wanted-for-armed-robbery/
753267427496960000 2016-07-13 16:38:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @CLewandowski_ @CNN @farhip "He's not being paid, he's just being given compensation for services rendered."  A rose, by any other name...
752661467439083520 2016-07-11 00:30:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis It is amazing that now, in addition to the Mendoza line for poor hitting, there is now a Mendoza line for poor announcing.
752230065056788480 2016-07-10 19:56:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis As @TimBritton points out, Price has FINISHED the 8th in 5 of his last 7 starts.
751837887755198465 2016-07-09 17:58:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Might say that even if its more than one.  Saying "I need two" potentially drives up the price.
751816240738373632 2016-07-09 16:32:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports So not an official...Bobby Knight?  Pat Robertson?  Chuck Norris?  Ted Nugent?  Another Trump?  So many fun choices.
751574081594466304 2016-07-08 00:29:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster I'm hoping a 30 for 30 about this season can be named 40 for 40. "What if I told you Big Papi never stopped coming up huge?"
750907248721825792 2016-07-06 04:20:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Depends if my team is competing for a championship.  Low-level team is supposed to say no to picks just so GSW-CLE is even?
750905465714814976 2016-07-06 04:13:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Won't GSW just find someone else to take Bogut?
750867235153948672 2016-07-06 01:41:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @Dis_combob_hate Writing/ready twitter sarcasm can be treacherous terrain.  :)
750867034951606273 2016-07-06 01:40:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @JimmyNasium "I classify ppl's character based on race by examining the voting habits of their race, I'm not racist tho!"
750866498298613760 2016-07-06 01:38:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill Only thing suspect is GOP head of FBI using platform to attack HRC with allegations he just admitted he can't prove in any court.
750865560645152768 2016-07-06 01:34:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @IanSams @Hollis_Hicks "I agree that is what he's doing, but I don't like the way you're describing it."  Awesome.
750864251619647488 2016-07-06 01:29:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticsblog @KevinOConnorNBA If C's can get something for helping Bulls and not disrupt team, should do so.  Let Riley rot though.
750863823473479680 2016-07-06 01:27:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @Dis_combob_hate He's joking, he's mocking the viewpoint of those who say the "real racists" are people who point out racism.
750863232022175744 2016-07-06 01:25:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @Fahrenthold Maybe if you say pretty please with a cherry on top?
750856847402217472 2016-07-06 00:59:57 UTC <bosdcla14> Agreed.  An FBI head using an FBI presser about "no charges" to make accusations he can't prove in court is wrong.https://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/750835345302888448
750848593209094144 2016-07-06 00:27:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm You know this happened in March, right?
750826035692777473 2016-07-06 22:57:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @wpjenna @fastjohnny @_RScottWhitley_ @TrumpTrain8 But you didn't & now you're dead & talking from the afterlife like the Nationwide ad kid?
750521580053098496 2016-07-05 02:47:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @TIME So the FBI is looking at elements of proof written in criminal statutes instead of what pundits or ppl in the comment section say? No!
750519449040498688 2016-07-05 02:39:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @instapundit @BostonGlobe @c_cgottlieb GOPer James Comey, most known for refusing to bow to pressure from Cheney, bowed to Obama? Hot take!
750518764806942725 2016-07-05 02:36:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill Comey's a GOPer & that presser showed how much he wanted to find a crime, but despite a LONG investigation turned up nada.  Enough.
750513700314816512 2016-07-05 02:16:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Seems a bit nuts that he's this bad in both multi-inning situations AND in non-save situations.  Pick one to suck at.
750504340134080512 2016-07-05 01:39:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe They've had, what, 4 chances to hit with a guy at 3rd and less than 2 outs and scored the runner on zero of those chances?
750478502764290048 2016-07-05 23:56:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Gotta like the 95-96 mph fastballs?
750471869040435200 2016-07-05 23:30:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @KWAPT Nice move...not to nitpick too much, but is his normal release point that low?
750056563428077568 2016-07-04 19:59:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Technically, a quality start, since one of the runs was unearned.
750051942907277316 2016-07-04 19:41:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @CelticsLife In a way, but it is also absolutely a function of who those two guys are.  Kobe loved the tour, TD would find it too showy.
750047511209865216 2016-07-04 19:23:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @elizabethforma Happy 4th, Sen. Warren!
750047268875538432 2016-07-04 19:22:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @EdgeofSports Pierce got traded, and hadn't wanted to be.  Him making that sacrifice is why the C's are back where they are now.
750044401523503105 2016-07-04 19:11:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @royceyoung Sorry dude.
750039411425890304 2016-07-04 18:51:45 UTC <bosdcla14> Holt still in his glorious "I've had a lot of rest and look amazing at everything" phase.
750028907538100224 2016-07-04 18:10:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis I enjoyed JBJ's non-walk look back "how about that one?  Is that one a ball?"
750028206204334081 2016-07-04 18:07:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianmacp Pedroia's initials have also become unfortunate, as he seems to ground into double plays constantly now.
749971087581065218 2016-07-04 14:20:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticsblog @WTLC "YeahJeets"?
749792116453150720 2016-07-03 02:29:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @crampell This is why GOP elites acting unsure how they wound up with Trump's is absurd---this IS their party, Trump is what they want.
749791428369215488 2016-07-03 02:26:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @ESPNSteinLine @DomLBJ95 @RushedMyLuck Obvious man says: most married ppl live together & ppl who leave their birth states do it 4 a reason.
749787894236065792 2016-07-03 02:12:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @ESPNSteinLine @DomLBJ95 @RushedMyLuck I think her opinion is going to be pro-Miami not Wisconsin, and that her opinion matters to him.
749786730954264577 2016-07-03 02:07:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @ESPNSteinLine @RushedMyLuck @DomLBJ95 And since Gabrielle Union was Gabrielle Union before she became Wade's wife, I doubt she'd be down.
749424459115696129 2016-07-02 02:08:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Since the Durant meeting is done maybe Brady wants to throw a bit.
749423114161795072 2016-07-02 02:02:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis I kind of want Farrell to come out & just go full Farrell.  Talk about how he liked the fight in the team and Clay's stuff.
749337140572463104 2016-07-02 20:21:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @hautedamn @Reblawrence12 I doubt the Trumpets care about the facts, they're just desperately looking to spin.
749336594415431680 2016-07-02 20:19:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @guardian He didn't delete it.  He superimposed a circle.  You can still see the points sticking out of the side.
749335921141571585 2016-07-02 20:16:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @stevesilberman He didn't delete the tweet, they just superimposed a circle on top of it, you can still see some points sticking out.
749331077785722882 2016-07-02 19:57:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @royceyoung Perhaps, tho I think Durant might have figured out that Jae Crowder isn't Steph Curry's equal even if Brady wasn't there. :)
749329298918518784 2016-07-02 19:50:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @WojVerticalNBA Because, according to @royceyoung, Brady is one of Durant's favorite athletes?  Cross-brand admiration is possible.
749327839376257024 2016-07-02 19:44:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe This is a great chance to troll people.  "Well, he could be there, but I know Stevens was interested in summer league so..."
749327264051896320 2016-07-02 19:41:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe For everyone freaking out about IT and Jae, they're clearly there, just not in this particular picture.
749316467196239873 2016-07-02 18:59:02 UTC <bosdcla14> David Ortiz is good friends with Al Horford because Ortiz is good friends with everyone on Earth.https://twitter.com/SeanGrandePBP/status/749315547171618816
749307560394518528 2016-07-02 18:23:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @ZachKleinWSB They've really insulted him during this process.  With the ne cap, he's easily a max guy, and he's had to beg and claw.
749303689853100033 2016-07-02 18:08:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @richeisen Better 4 it to go publicly to players rather than secretly to the owners.  NBA players retire rich; NFL players retire wrecked.
749300589268389888 2016-07-02 17:55:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @Al_Horford @HousefromDC Guess the C's will have to settle for being a team with better coaches, management, and players.  :)
749031717810294784 2016-07-01 00:07:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @AdamHimmelsbach @KevinOConnorNBA I listened to JJ Redick's podcast with him and that is very true, he says that constantly.
749012036726558720 2016-07-01 22:49:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @Rschooley He's from the UK.  So when he says "long time Democrat" he means he was a LibDem in the UK growing up.  Pretty funny.
748983005637545984 2016-07-01 20:53:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @thekidet Congrats Evan!  I enjoyed the ET experience in your time with the Celtics.  Best of luck with the Blazers.
748909530851840001 2016-07-01 16:02:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I thought Hump played well for the C's & he's added a 3-pt shot, so I'm fine w/ this unless its in place of larger moves.
748757456394657792 2016-06-30 05:57:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Wouldn't Bridgegate and resigning from Congress in disgrace be disqualifying before any vetting was done in a normal campaign?
747619859719061504 2016-06-27 02:37:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm 1. Christ as VP :).  2.

747601178733641728 2016-06-27 01:23:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster @jkeggs1121 He went back to his old delivery on Friday.  Remy/Dave were speculating that Sox were "experimenting" with it.
747582914464878592 2016-06-27 00:10:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster That's fine, that's getting involved.  But he can't just sit there and think "man I hope Dave figures out Carl needs to go."
747582339430047744 2016-06-27 00:08:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Mgr should get involved if problem persists.  He can't just leave hitters to Davis, pitchers to Willis & shrug shoulders.
747580935961350144 2016-06-27 00:02:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster He's a former pitching coach & Price is his premier starter.  If Brady throws 4 picks in 3 starts, Belichick looks at tape.
747580160770084864 2016-06-27 23:59:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Why did it take Pedroia looking at Price's delivery to fix it, and how many other things are Farrell/Willis missing?
747540984850853889 2016-06-27 21:23:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @PFTCommenter Brits unexpectedly quit, don't show grit.
747450934997843968 2016-06-27 15:26:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS Media elites want to think GOP reasonable---so Trump will lose primary---he won? He must be popular w/ normal Americans.

746504378174017536 2016-06-24 00:44:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Guess he figured gotta take the risk there. If you won that, you'd have someone on first with 1 out in the 2nd, that's HUGE.
746485984267669505 2016-06-24 23:31:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro "If elected, we will overturn the Farage fraud.  To those who seek to cut the UK off from Europe, we say 'hell no, we won't go!'"

746414790147379200 2016-06-24 18:48:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @BBCJamesCook I enjoy that other people think Trump is trying to be correct & would be disappointed with himself if he learned he was wrong.
746406863369953280 2016-06-24 18:17:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @HillaryClinton The Dow and S&P 500 get crushed due to Brexit, while DJT celebrates those losses for Americans, a preview of his presidency.
746391470911807488 2016-06-24 17:16:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @KurtSchlichter Meh, Churchill was wildly pro-Europe. Spent to prop up govts in exile, pulled troops from N-Africa to go to Greece, etc.
746371073717854209 2016-06-24 15:55:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @juliamacfarlane Nah.  I mean, we may realize it, but we don't realise it.  :)
746166000630960129 2016-06-23 02:20:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlobeChadFinn That is a mind-boggling tweet.  Picked possibly best QB ever in 6th round, best TE ever in 2nd round.

746160412991717376 2016-06-23 01:58:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @zackbeauchamp Why is that surprising? That's been pretty consistent from the cons since Obama's been in office.

745440211614654470 2016-06-21 02:16:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Why hasn't he been dropped to 8th or 9th in the lineup?  He's a .265 singles hitter, 5 homers & 12 doubles on the year.
745419503899598848 2016-06-21 00:53:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @hilzoy That last Game of Thrones must have been hard for King, with Dany breaking the slavers' "society and civilization" at last.

745415611304443906 2016-06-21 00:38:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @MatthewNussbaum Did King also object to Tubman's divisive efforts to deprive Southern gentlemen of their human property?

745394301589327873 2016-06-21 23:13:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Can't wait to hear after the game how he felt good and how every pitcher misses location sometimes so its cool.

744274540004442112 2016-06-18 21:04:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianmacp At some point, did Vasquez decide that the way to get guys out is to throw them the same pitch again and again?
744262165817810944 2016-06-18 20:15:02 UTC <bosdcla14> Vasquez, in there for his defense, fails to catch a foul tip with 2 strikes and lets Cano get the hit that loads the bases with nobody out.

743629167762112512 2016-06-16 02:19:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Clay + Leon. 2.48 ERA last year, 3 scoreless in this game.  Certainly not proof that Cleon will work, but we know E-Rod won't work.
743599636175163392 2016-06-16 00:22:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Maybe he can pitch.
743599306318327808 2016-06-16 00:21:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Did he say in this start?  Maybe he means after he's out of baseball.  "He won't pitch anymore so no more walks."

742837695232118785 2016-06-14 21:54:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @CookJohnC I thought Putin would offer it in a "good deal" for some of the classified briefing info that Trump & Manafort will get soon.
742834858817265664 2016-06-14 21:43:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro I think it'd actually damage non-Trump GOPers more, as Trumpers vote for Trump but not the backstabbing establishment candidate.
742834383959121923 2016-06-14 21:41:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @AntoniaZ @Huscoon Exactly right!  Glad we agree that there are certain arms ppl can't be allowed to buy for safety reasons.

742781218790330368 2016-06-14 18:10:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @AntoniaZ The state requires that any car must comply with emissions standards.  I was unaware this counts as punishment.

742464794960089088 2016-06-13 21:12:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefix @MadaGasp Coverage of Hillary is overwhelmingly negative.  Can you provide 1 example of negative Trump coverage you'd say is OK?
742464449835982851 2016-06-13 21:11:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo Honestly, Trump sending Christie to bring him back McDonald's shows a lot of trust on Trump's part.
742463376375185408 2016-06-13 21:07:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @thefix @MadaGasp True journalists only ask questions The Donald wants to answer and consistently shower him with only praise?
742461933324926980 2016-06-13 21:01:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS No need for the qualifier- if you asked him "will you consider detention of all American Muslims?" I think he'd say yes.

741300849050288129 2016-06-10 16:07:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnJHarwood It is funny that Spicer's making this claim at nearly the exact moment Trump is tweeting about Warren's heritage.

740976681913982976 2016-06-09 18:39:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @costareports I'd think Obama gave him a heads-up in their meeting.  Was Sanders trying could bully him out of it w/ "neutrality" comment?
740975989266604033 2016-06-09 18:36:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump Current Gallup Obama approval numbers: 53% approve, 43% disapprove.  Gallup has a history of understating Obama's support.
740969217365676032 2016-06-09 18:10:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @HowardKurtz You object, because coverage must be all-Trump, all the time?  Maybe they should air FNC fluffing doc "Meet the Trumps"?

740260314067795968 2016-06-07 19:13:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @ReutersPolitics @JerryArk Trump said he wasn't fit because judge was of Mexican ethnicity.  Is that the group you mean is racist?

739958660248436736 2016-06-06 23:14:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Do U think the "We will overcome" quote from Trump was an MLK reference? Does he think he's carrying that banner? Possible, right?
739929490382413824 2016-06-06 21:18:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddale8 Someone could ask Trump if he sees his fight against Curiel as his way of carrying MLK's torch today.  I think he could say yes.
739926483179700224 2016-06-06 21:06:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @ddale8 Was Trump saying "We will overcome" a mangled reference to MLK?  Because that would be amazing.

739238325689556993 2016-06-04 23:32:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillKristol @KSofen Trump didn't point to the judge's membership in an organization as the DQ'ing factor.  He cited the judge's ethnicity.

737842767804534784 2016-05-31 03:06:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @DrFocash 1. Nah.  2. No he's not.  3. Ppl DJT cares about: DJT.  End of list. 4. What victory?  5. He'd steal a kid's piggie bank.
737838502948179968 2016-05-31 02:49:42 UTC <bosdcla14> I've gotten a much better idea this year of how thoughtfully Ortiz approaches his ABs.  Not just grip it & rip it.https://twitter.com/PeteAbe/status/737836047753748481
737827549724581888 2016-05-31 02:06:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @triguy58 Happy to help clarify.  No need to thank me.  :)
737826193261531136 2016-05-31 02:00:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @thehill @triguy58 Internet Iron Law: if you care enough to comment on an article, you care about the subject matter of the article.
737809155788922885 2016-05-31 00:53:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @FeitsBarstool I think it might be ppl worried that JBJ is injured or that Farrell is an idiot for playing Young against a RHP.
737422459020795904 2016-05-30 23:16:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump He granted your request for a continuance, which is completely within the discretion of the court.
737378011205357568 2016-05-30 20:19:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe I think he stays in.  Last inning was easy, he looks sharp, and as a knuckler his PC has a little more leeway than the average guy.
737375734289682432 2016-05-30 20:10:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @CBSSports @Jared_Carrabis Maybe this will motivate @cbssports to actually use Marco's picture for him, instead of simply re-using Xander's picture?
737363268327505921 2016-05-30 19:21:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @bradfo Three extra base hits, all triples, does seem like an odd stat line.
737346980976852993 2016-05-30 18:16:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Come on.  When Vasquez came in last time, this stuff immediately stopped.  Hanigan simply can't catch the guy.
736297528719593472 2016-05-27 20:46:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet I'd say this sounds crazy, but you're called a lot of stuff right lately.
736296708196335618 2016-05-27 20:43:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias He hasn't gone one on one with anyone.  Deliberately avoided it.
736240370074275840 2016-05-27 16:59:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @marcorubio Little Marco's telling, not spelling.  He has chosen to lead, not to read.
735670276126576640 2016-05-25 03:13:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @MikeIsaac @sacca Any billionaire can now bankrupt any publication they want by funding lawsuits.  Thiel's tactic kills free speech.
735663908757835776 2016-05-25 02:48:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm He forgot the "Sad!" at the end of that tweet.
735316840218394624 2016-05-24 03:49:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @POLITICO_Steve @jpegan10 More ppl voted in the primary.
734783133539672064 2016-05-23 16:28:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @DrJillStein The most progressive policy platform the Democratic party has ever had vs. a reality TV Mussolini?  Same thing, right?
734553125986566144 2016-05-22 01:14:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @AriFleischer What are you talking about?  Both McCain and Romney had leads.  You don't have to lie about everything, you know.
734222315425173505 2016-05-21 03:20:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @billpostmus @itldoranch He is out-giving the Dems, promised to expand Social Security, which is free stuff for whites.
733434453221998594 2016-05-19 23:09:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Is he saying he wants to make America responsible for security for all flights from Paris?  Yikes.  Pass.
733407132960231424 2016-05-19 21:21:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @petridishes This is funny.  The outraged comments made it even better.  Amazing.
733352014680227840 2016-05-19 17:41:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @realDonaldTrump This flight did not start in, nor did it land in, the USA.  We're not responsible for every airplane in the world.
733341968042889217 2016-05-19 17:02:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias A bunch of the Hillary holdout websites from 2008---Hillbuzz,, Hillary is 44---are now anti-Hillary, pro-Trump.
733135943993974790 2016-05-18 03:23:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Those 6 hours where there was a two-game losing streak were harrowing indeed.
733115194230984704 2016-05-18 02:00:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @blakehounshell Once he made it clear he was a Republican.
733107484169097216 2016-05-18 01:30:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @SteveKornacki @IraStoll Nutty confirmation fight.  Weld favored medicinal marijuana & Jesse Helms said that meant he liked drug dealers.
732792534909526017 2016-05-17 04:38:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhillipsPasha No. Sanders' speech said he's winning working class&Marshall is pointing that's wrong,Sanders only counting white workers.
732791449096486915 2016-05-17 04:34:30 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @snarkworthy @parallelcircle I think Bernie's ideas are the Dem party's future, but he's losing b/c of his botched outreach effort.
732790117304164352 2016-05-17 04:29:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @snarkworthy @parallelcircle So African-Americans should stop making their own decisions & instead vote Bernie b/c they owe him? OK
732787544006393856 2016-05-17 04:18:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @snarkworthy @parallelcircle Yes. I'd have thought Bernie did as well, until his statement implied no non-whites are working class.
732779031406383108 2016-05-17 03:45:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @snarkworthy Objecting to white supremacy is twisted pretzel logic?  That take is so hot, I'm gonna use it to make s'mores.
732778268231749633 2016-05-17 03:42:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @Raptors #WeTheNorth chants are cool though?  If you don't want USA chants, try not getting humiliated in the game.
732763562322460672 2016-05-17 02:43:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd @hardball @chrislhayes @maddow @saneprogressive Hayes must be a ninja since he managed to do it twice.
730951349634895872 2016-05-12 02:42:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @JeffBezos @oliverdarcy Am I misunderstanding this?  Hannity is arguing that the media shouldn't examine a nominee's history?
730917081009414144 2016-05-12 00:26:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Depressingly excellent.  Him, A-Rod, and Shulman could be a annoyingly great three man booth.
730916401565732864 2016-05-12 00:23:44 UTC <bosdcla14> It seems unfair that Roger Clemens and Alex Rodriguez are engaging and knowledgeable as analysts.
730843645465616384 2016-05-12 19:34:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarackObama @DevinSenaUI @markfollman @McCluskyJoe What's an "enemy hostile"?  Could someone be an "enemy friendly"?  Seems weird IMO.
730824651031482368 2016-05-12 18:19:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @MittRomney @ScottBaio @FoxBusiness "Be a man!  Be bullied into abandoning your principles!  That's what makes a man!"
730517430112419844 2016-05-11 21:58:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @THE1_AB @ImpactDemocracy So the contest that basically makes it impossible for single parents on limited incomes to participate is better?
730471708251979777 2016-05-11 18:56:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls Wow, a net of -60 AND the mark of the beast.  Quite the combo.
730443159570808832 2016-05-11 17:03:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @Reince I suppose the same is true 4 when 2008 Obama lost the majority of contests in March, April, May & June to HRC.  How'd that turn out?
730408439931789312 2016-05-11 14:45:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @HouseCracka @SteveRattner Democrats will, indeed, lose West Virginia in a landslide. Just like the last 2 times.
730200512650346497 2016-05-10 00:59:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox_Thoughts @OverTheMonster I agree.  Plus "Sully" is sitting right there.  Celtic Sully is probably leaving in FA anyway.
730200067450142720 2016-05-10 00:57:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @fairnjustperil @RestlessJack @jbouie It doesn't bother you that 44% of Bernie's WV voters are just ratfucking & will vote for Trump in GE?
730195421880942592 2016-05-10 00:38:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @draftshmaft @PeteBlackburn Which 2015?  In his 8 post-DL starts in 2015, he had a 3.51 ERA.  You mean his stats when he was injured?
730192285724348417 2016-05-10 00:26:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @thegarance "Libertarians who hate freedom of religion, free trade and want to government to kill Mulsims & take their oil for Trump."
730187710384627712 2016-05-10 00:08:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABCPolitics Not sure if the strangest part of this is the belated GOP belief in the Fairness Doctrine or that ppl get their news from FB.
729824455627706368 2016-05-09 00:04:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis @15Lasershow Maybe the Sox should hire a coach whose only job is to help the pitchers pitch well?  Could be revolutionary.
729486780035014656 2016-05-08 01:42:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe 40 for 40.
729482911112527872 2016-05-08 01:27:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Sounds like the words of someone who has come to trust a knuckleballer a little bit.
729464450676219906 2016-05-08 00:14:12 UTC <bosdcla14> Well @15Lasershow is fresh off fixing Price's delivery so of course he hits a 2-run bomb.
729463101616095232 2016-05-08 00:08:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @toeingtherubber Also because he's 42, been playing 20 years, and that's his first home.  And I'm sick of hearing about PEDs.
729366188724101120 2016-05-08 17:43:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @NancyPelosi @HouseGOP So absurd even @realDonaldTrump said that it was a failure and Gowdy is a loser.
729015872107380740 2016-05-07 18:31:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @DAVIDprice24 Jesus man come on, another crappy outing?
729012075641503744 2016-05-07 18:16:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @politico Trash lying lede. Speech never mentioned Trump. Discussed midterms.
729005926548570113 2016-05-07 17:52:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @davidfrum I thought it was "fair" not "nice" but pretty much the same.
728747531522342912 2016-05-06 00:45:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump "Dangerous" is so lame.  If it must be a word starting with D, how about deranged or destructive?
728744809016508416 2016-05-06 00:34:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Plus you get Sanders' voters in the party, they probably stay Democrats; disaffected GOPers are one-and-done AT BEST.
728703720737775616 2016-05-06 21:51:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @seanspicer @TheDemocrats You misspelled "candidate" in #18. Also you guys don't have any of your former Presidents going. That seems worse.
728320461298274304 2016-05-05 20:28:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @GlennThrush Nah. Trump has shown his true colors repeatedly. We know who he is. Make a choice.
728040174190354432 2016-05-04 01:54:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis And then his season-ending surgery spared the Sox of having to play him periodically for no reason.
728036464836009984 2016-05-04 01:39:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @alexspeier #NeverRetire
728031382958575616 2016-05-04 01:19:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Swap Mookie and JBJ in the order. Mookie is hitting 30 points lower and has not done anything with 3 easy pitches tonight.
727982043443798016 2016-05-04 22:03:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm Well, I don't know about that, but I hear Patrick Fitzgerald is going to indict 22 people including Rove, Cheney, and Hillary.  :)
727981022592163840 2016-05-04 21:59:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @CNN No audio where I am.  Does he specify whether he means raising the minimum wage or eliminating it?
727906902147895297 2016-05-04 17:05:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Take it to 'em Liz!
727904813564891136 2016-05-04 16:56:46 UTC <bosdcla14> @KR4HRC @notlarrysabato Webb already indicated he'd vote for Trump over Clinton.  Used to be a Republican, left b/c of Iraq.  Sort of a fit.
727718498542170114 2016-05-03 04:36:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @AOTR_Host @BenjySarlin Its already happened with a bunch of righties. Kristol, Fleicher, etc.
727690593585930241 2016-05-03 02:45:32 UTC <bosdcla14> Worst part of Ted Cruz's day?
727657932301602816 2016-05-03 00:35:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @Reince Trump said Cruz's dad helped Lee Harvey Oswald kill JFK, Cruz said Trump is a pathological liar with VD and then dropped out.
727646342642688000 2016-05-03 23:49:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit Record of consecutive months of private sector job growth.  Previous: 51 months- Clinton. Current: 71 months and counting.
727644914163458048 2016-05-03 23:44:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @MichelTy8 Right, that's why North Vietnam won, their industrial base.  South could have won, but subordinated strategy to battle tactics.
727643814043607040 2016-05-03 23:39:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit @paulkrugman "Some say attending law school increases income, but my income was low until I left, so that's wrong."  OK.
727641996584607744 2016-05-03 23:32:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @DouthatNYT I also think Cruz's attempt to deal with Kasich hurt him.  Seems to validate Trump critiques of party & Cruz as corrupt.
727641417506430976 2016-05-03 23:30:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit @paulkrugman Largest impact?  ARRA&PPACA.  Why do you think we set a record for private sector job creation?  Random luck?
727618766138314753 2016-05-03 22:00:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @MichelTy8 @HeerJeet Having more officers does not translate into having a vision on how to win the war--need plan to address weaknesses.
727618262431731712 2016-05-03 21:58:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @NormOrnstein He will. Even when Trump was demeaning Heidi, Cruz only said he wasn't in "habit" of endorsing such men, not that he wouldn't.
727613005731536896 2016-05-03 21:37:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit @paulkrugman Why would the 8 year average be more useful than the end point?  End point represents the results of policies.
727612685601267712 2016-05-03 21:35:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls Maybe they mean former Illinois DT/Oakland Raiders 2016 2nd round draft pick Jihad Ward?
727605937654013952 2016-05-03 21:09:08 UTC <bosdcla14> @ppppolls Which is wild since she won 67% of the Dem primary vote there in 2008...
727594060362350592 2016-05-03 20:21:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit @paulkrugman So unemployment of 4.1% is worse than unemployment of 7.8%?  That is such a hot take it could cook s'mores.
727502698199683072 2016-05-03 14:18:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @PurportedPundit @paulkrugman Thank God for steady growth instead of the massive crashes at the end of the Bush I and Bush II presidencies.
727310541992026113 2016-05-02 01:35:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Probably have to explain to not eat the ring like you have to with babies.
727280588063838209 2016-05-02 23:36:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @Mediaite So Bill Kristol is as bad at predicting his own actions as he is at predicting results of elections, wars, healthcare reform, etc?
727278972585660418 2016-05-02 23:29:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @PeteAbe Just read your Ortiz & Maverick story & enjoyed it, especially the detail about the parents getting married in Sox gear.
727257113513205760 2016-05-02 22:03:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @NBAMemes Trail Blazers barely beat a one-eyed Austin Rivers.
726939898050023424 2016-05-01 01:02:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @stoolpresidente @BarstoolNate Would the trip be covered by the StoolFinance blogger?
726509377180438528 2016-04-30 20:31:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @jeffjarvis Thanks for highlighting this article. I wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't for your temper tantrum over being rightfully mocked.
726468111143051264 2016-04-30 17:47:49 UTC <bosdcla14> @celticsfan221 PFT commenter's persona is satirical.  He takes absurd sports takes and makes them even more absurd.
726132546392592384 2016-04-29 19:34:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @MikeAndMike @nflcommish Maybe its unrealistic to ask you to be as incisive as @Rachel__Nichols, but can you at least not be such pushovers?
726132202459680768 2016-04-29 19:33:02 UTC <bosdcla14> @jobbe03 @Jobbe03 @buffsblg @ESPNNFL @MikeAndMike @espn Whereas Goodell's celebration & exploitation of unlawful & dangerous behavior is good?

725906052311437313 2016-04-28 04:34:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Your blogs made the season even more fun.  Also waiting for the inevitable "LAYUPS!" tweet on a missed bunny at the rim.  :)
725855714300727298 2016-04-28 01:14:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @celtics Well, I suppose that explains the first half then.
725855110228627456 2016-04-28 01:11:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @jaketapper Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went on "Seriously, good for him, I have no idea what I'm doing."
725853357164752898 2016-04-28 01:05:00 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Pretty arrogant to assume we're going to get another point in the final 1:36.

725521159245062144 2016-04-27 03:04:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @CarlyFiorina You got paid $40 million to leave a company so you'd stop killing it as CEO.  Seems like it worked OK for you.
725519349822312448 2016-04-27 02:57:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @MeighanCorbett @ByronYork @TheStalwart Probably has a good understanding of the 2-3 zone.  Maybe it has military applications?
725518506830123008 2016-04-27 02:54:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @exjon @AJerseyGirlYall @Bencjacobs Cool cool.https://twitter.com/AlyLovesMovies/status/724043961778757633
725512890812227584 2016-04-27 02:32:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @BusterBroncoEsq No, you have to yell "Run the BAUWLLLLLLL" at the TV.  @Tracifer42 can attest to how necessary I know this to be.
725492771356741632 2016-04-27 01:12:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @netw3rk I'd say endorsing/stumping for Trump is a step toward that goal.
725393931966386176 2016-04-27 18:39:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @professorjeanie @SpeakerRyan He probably means open borders.
725345155721519105 2016-04-27 15:25:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @gartenrehn @jbarro That's the joke, that people think that way.
725175598520262656 2016-04-26 04:11:50 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro "I'm not rich, we can barely afford private schools for our kids."  Ppl like to think rich means you own a plane.
725105675836227588 2016-04-26 23:33:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster "We've got a 4-0 lead, let's go with the guy with a sub-2 ERA instead of the ERA at 7."
725103101850587136 2016-04-26 23:23:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @darrenelwood If you want to get out, do so in under a year.  After that, anything under 40 degrees feels frigid and rain seems unnatural.
725101317891481601 2016-04-26 23:16:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @darrenelwood @JimMiller @RealSkipBayless That's true & a really interesting point.  Rovell's probably sweating trying to hold back a tweet.
724818874408013828 2016-04-25 04:34:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @FOXSportsSD @DonOrsillo @Mudcat55 I'm happy and pained at the same time. You're extremely lucky San Diego.
724786765668605952 2016-04-25 02:26:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis #PrettyRicky + #TheLawnMower = a beautiful landscape.
724784138968928256 2016-04-25 02:16:19 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Or at least google Zuckerberg's age.
724776030158749696 2016-04-25 01:44:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @ANNELAMOTT @joshtpm Try googling the exact title. WSJ sometimes licenses stories to other outlets who put them up without a paywall.
724725200651046912 2016-04-25 22:22:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABCPolitics @tedcruz Man, he's really hammering this, feel like he needs a new nickname.  Toilet Ted?  Crapper Cruz?
724652779461971969 2016-04-25 17:34:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie You need a "Defend the Wall" equivalent.  "Shield the Shamrock" or "Protect the Parquet" or something like that.
724466145609175040 2016-04-24 05:12:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox Hembree has been so great.
724390386882383872 2016-04-24 00:11:41 UTC <bosdcla14> @Marc_DAmico Ugh Sully.
724298658817044480 2016-04-24 18:07:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABC Predators?  I think he's confusing trans people with Republican Speakers of the House v
723997805384110081 2016-04-23 22:11:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @StuJackson32 Ok. So to any cops out there, if Stu speeds or does a rolling stop, prosecute him to the full extent of the law. No warnings.
723887079264915456 2016-04-23 14:51:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias I heard Perez on Keeping it 1600 and was impressed.
723702501657075712 2016-04-22 02:38:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @HPbasketball Like when Smart fouled Korver with his face?
723590339903123456 2016-04-22 19:12:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @stoolpresidente It was actually really interesting.  @BarstoolNate should have run it by you but it's a solid idea.
723568842165784576 2016-04-22 17:47:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @allegrakirkland @joshtpm Yikes. RIP your mentions.
722600355079462912 2016-04-19 01:38:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @mattyglesias Celtics should be allowed to add new players now. These closed playoff rules are unfair.
721910894628712448 2016-04-17 03:59:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @austinramzy Beating James Madison is pretty impressive.
721894319947276288 2016-04-17 02:53:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe @Jeff_Jacoby You want to go back to the days where 4000 US soldiers were dying in Iraq? That's crazy. Let Syrians solve Syria.

721506228094898177 2016-04-16 01:11:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @HPbasketball @MikePradaSBN Celts should play Rozier at the 3. Better defense and rebounding than Jonas.
721505840285360128 2016-04-16 01:09:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @Marc_DAmico Please put Jonas on the bench and leave him there.
721496484349218816 2016-04-16 00:32:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe And Sully on the floor in more ways than one.
721157095932821504 2016-04-15 02:03:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @SurvivingGrady Christianity is the faith devoted to the worship of Christian Vasquez as a baseball deity, right?  That makes sense.
721156890416128000 2016-04-15 02:02:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @alexspeier Need a shot of where Vasquez framed it
720740295374049280 2016-04-14 22:27:31 UTC <bosdcla14> @PardonMyTake Skip with shots fired at ESPN coworker @JalenRose.
720687197511294977 2016-04-14 18:56:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @robertmays @MalloryRubin New NFL Draft podcast to discuss the Rams-Titans trade?
720419200750133248 2016-04-13 01:11:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @GwashburnGlobe Sign him to a contract, can't be worse than Sully tonight.
720418892045115392 2016-04-13 01:10:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Hey, he's only given up 7 hits, 3 for extra bases, and 5 walks in 4 and 2/3.  Doesn't he deserve the win?
720407715122585600 2016-04-13 00:25:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie They really wanted your 47-win prediction to be spot-on accurate.
720401599760207872 2016-04-13 00:01:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @aaronbruski Too bad.  Adding Jackson's ego to that already-toxic brew could have really produced a historic level of dysfunction.

720355089471242240 2016-04-13 20:56:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @jcmccaffrey He's an easy target because he's so huge its hard to miss.  Like shooting jump shots at a laundry basket.
720297225134297088 2016-04-13 17:06:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek With your eyes closed and the sound off.
720064877188874240 2016-04-12 01:43:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox I miss @wademiley20
720055629319053313 2016-04-12 01:06:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis True, but Swihart has been horrific at the plate and as a catcher. He's so slow to react I've wondered if he was concussed.
720035524090564609 2016-04-12 23:47:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @IanMBrowne I think he should, because if Pablo can't hit a guy he used to mash, we'll know he shouldn't be getting to pinch-hit for Shaw.
719709298117349378 2016-04-11 02:10:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @Reince The conventions of Trump twitter dictate that you're supposed to put an exclamation point after "nothing different."
719696855576121344 2016-04-11 01:21:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @virgiltexas Having affairs and releasing classified info?  IOKIYAR.  Patrick McHenry pointing out targets, Issa ID'ing a CIA facility, etc.
719694475539288065 2016-04-11 01:11:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @virgiltexas I assume the GOP wouldn't care, look at Allen West.  However, McChrsytal would be out b/c he voted for Obama & talked about it.
719682372514385920 2016-04-11 00:23:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I'd like to see Zeller in this game.  Sully can't defend Big Al, so make him run ragged trying to keep up with Zeller.
719624553467486208 2016-04-11 20:33:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @brianmacp At least two of those were plays he should have made.
719610313633439744 2016-04-11 19:37:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @TimBritton I knew you were Trumbo when you walked in, Trumbo, Trumbo.
719605027145256960 2016-04-11 19:16:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis Gonna need the Mayor of Ding Dong City to pay attention to his constituents here.
719603419346939905 2016-04-11 19:09:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @S_MacDonald43 @PFTCommenter This take is so hot it is literally atomic.
719602962662699008 2016-04-11 19:08:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @redsoxstats Did he have an inning where he gave up 5 ER during 2015?
719577411071844352 2016-04-11 17:26:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @Newsweek @AngelTilaLove I think my favorite part is how the third sentence contradicts the first one.
718962365711036416 2016-04-09 00:42:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillSimmons I love the people who think you're serious.
718613509664145408 2016-04-08 01:36:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis If we could just give up 5 runs a game...
718613366139256832 2016-04-08 01:35:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Not saying I agree, & I'm guessing a bit, but I think Brad feels like Young's regressed to where he can't even shoot.
718612633302118401 2016-04-08 01:32:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Brad's playing guys he might play during the playoffs, and I think he thinks he knows what he has (or doesn't have) in Young.
717842162285555715 2016-04-06 22:31:23 UTC <bosdcla14> @OverTheMonster Fought off a lot of good tough pitches in that AB.
717588643850768384 2016-04-05 05:43:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @gdickerson_mass You mean bc it means that not only did the Celts beat the Warriors, they murdered their mojo as well?
717544684239716353 2016-04-05 02:49:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @toeingtherubber He had his moments. He called the location of Luis Gonzalez's game winning hit off Rivera in the 2001 World Series.
717544003663597569 2016-04-05 02:46:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @matthewjdowd @owillis He lost 6 of final 9.  There's more than a dozen contests left this year. You are very wrong and should apologize.
717409400692940801 2016-04-05 17:51:44 UTC <bosdcla14> Mookie going yard was certainly nice, but I still wish I was hearing @DonOrsillo's call of this game.
716651171675410433 2016-04-03 15:38:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @minakimes "Scheme" doesn't seem to have a negative meaning in non-American English.  UK pols call their own plans "schemes".
716109997713674240 2016-04-01 03:48:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @coolbrahchill He's getting hammered in the paint every time without a call.
716109774996185088 2016-04-01 03:47:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @BillSimmons That's an attempt to jinx.
713485145974697985 2016-03-25 21:58:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo @BernieSanders Or does it just prove he's right?
713474475300229120 2016-03-25 21:15:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @Drews_Views Article says he said we'd reach point of no return this year. Says nothing about world ending this year.
713439635792207872 2016-03-25 18:57:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @VaughnHillyard Well, I think he'd only be asked to do it this once, which is hardly a habit.
713156275912060928 2016-03-24 00:11:20 UTC <bosdcla14> @NFL Bah.  Where were the facts when you banned Payton for a year w/ Bountygate? Where were the facts on Deflategate? Goodell is a disgrace.
713037347391037440 2016-03-24 16:18:45 UTC <bosdcla14> @molly_knight @mattdpearce Probably, but keep in mind Clinton's 60ish ratings didn't produce a landslide for his VP.
712841142027444224 2016-03-23 03:19:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @schubie71 @ABC Also nobody cared what Bush was doing after the Madrid train attacks in 2004 killed 192.
712818873242767360 2016-03-23 01:50:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @ibee32 @danielrainge Offer them the Nets pick, and a TD Garden appearance for JD and the Straight Shot.

712811742376566785 2016-03-23 01:22:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @ByJayKing Evergreen tweet.
712798557783207936 2016-03-23 00:29:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @Jared_Carrabis WANT LARGE OUTFIELDERS FOR POWER, SANDOVAL LARGEST OF THEM ALL AND HAS GOOD REACH ACROSS PLATE IF PLATE CONTAINS FOOD.

712719716322643968 2016-03-23 19:16:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @HeerJeet Hey, @ppppolls, maybe ask respondents if they support a dictatorship of the proletariat after asking them party&POTUS preference?
712459392470286337 2016-03-22 02:02:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @margarita @Newsweek He just wanted to tweak it apparently; it has been re-posted.
712093229764648966 2016-03-21 01:47:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @sahilkapur What about all the times he wrote that @GroverNorquist was a mole for the Muslim Brotherhood, those OK?  http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/tag/grover-norquist/
711959737286307840 2016-03-21 16:56:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedSox @KFP48 I hear he could miss time, out w/ a pulled pork sandwich.  It is very tender, and you don't mess w/ a serious pulled pork.
711387315906551808 2016-03-19 03:02:07 UTC <bosdcla14> @BillSimmons The ppl taking this tweet seriously are the best.
710978588602814466 2016-03-18 23:57:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @alexspeier Is one of the reasons Sandoval is battling the sun because he is in his own orbit around it, independent of the Earth?

710272229754294272 2016-03-16 01:11:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @GOP Hatch literally said that Garland would be a consensus nominee who'd win bipartisan approval.  Give him an up or down vote.
710270749454376961 2016-03-16 01:05:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Really need Crowder to have a record-fast recovery from the high ankle sprain.  If he's missing in the 1st round...
710246747717505024 2016-03-16 23:29:55 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarstoolBigCat He's tweeting from the future, when the Cubs trade Kris Bryant.
710223958868504576 2016-03-16 21:59:21 UTC <bosdcla14> @joshtpm @TPM Josh Marshall taking cheap shots at Donald Trump.  Desperate to prop up failed website with mealy-mouthed criticism.  Sad!  :)
710210640879624192 2016-03-16 21:06:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @BarstoolBB At this point, if he swings at something and makes solid contact, I take that as an improvement no matter what.

710133373956534272 2016-03-16 15:59:24 UTC <bosdcla14> @SenToomey Constitution requires you consider nominee not whether POTUS hurt your feelings.
709896109863251968 2016-03-15 00:16:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro "Needlessly cruel" is a good description of the campaign.

709450846774267904 2016-03-14 18:47:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @TaylorArluck @mattyglesias @realDonaldTrump Matt's making fun of that talking point. Read the embedded tweet.
709206705188384769 2016-03-13 02:37:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @BrendanNyhan Why did you think that?  Bush got fewer votes than Gore and not one GOPer said he shouldn't become President.

708729090790936576 2016-03-12 18:59:17 UTC <bosdcla14> @just_nikka @Just_Nikka @speechboy71 Of the right. You just agreed with Rubio that Obama is to blame for Trump. Do you not remember doing that?
708720052359405568 2016-03-12 18:23:22 UTC <bosdcla14> @just_nikka @Just_Nikka @speechboy71 Its statements like this that show the moral depravity and neo-fascist sympathies of rightwingers today.
708684996500828160 2016-03-12 16:04:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @JoeNBC @rolandsmartin Anyone who says "both sides do it" is engaging in false equivalency. One side is always more responsible.
708490257403027456 2016-03-11 03:10:15 UTC <bosdcla14> @Trump_Train2016 @JuddLegum He had said he wants more violence and that he'd pay legal bills of his supporters who attack protestors. Bad!
708488701043560448 2016-03-11 03:04:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @Trump_Train2016 @JuddLegum No I condemn both them and Trump for encouraging violence repeatedly. See how that works?
708488457715212290 2016-03-11 03:03:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro I feel like Obama's comments on Trayvon Martin would come up.
708488007028834304 2016-03-11 03:01:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @Trump_Train2016 @JuddLegum Well of course. You support a candidate who never accepts responsibility for anything and you do the same.
708341959669067776 2016-03-11 17:20:58 UTC <bosdcla14> @kronayne Wait, so the Rubio ppl just did this without a discussion about terms with Team Kasich first?  Clowns.
708152826455678976 2016-03-10 04:49:25 UTC <bosdcla14> @MadaGasp @sahilkapur @MichelleFields Except for the victim, the eyewitness, the audio, the physical evidence & the perp not denying it.
708130018497470465 2016-03-10 03:18:47 UTC <bosdcla14> @lrozen "HULK SMASH!" is sort of a vision.
708119682230845441 2016-03-10 02:37:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @BostonGlobe By this standard, the most freest places on Earth would be Yemen, Somalia, and the breakaway Ukrainian territories.
708077516871741441 2016-03-10 23:50:10 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABCPolitics @MichelleFields @TomLlamasABC Well, considering Trump noted he might date his daughter if they weren't related...
707642282934075393 2016-03-09 19:00:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @ThePlumLineGS Trump could try to appeal to Dems, saying he speaks the truth w/o fear, will defend PP & attack the Iraq War in a GOP debate.
707628586371448832 2016-03-09 18:06:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie @TonyMassarotti Also the Rubio campaign on Trump, probably.
707409878155792384 2016-03-08 03:37:12 UTC <bosdcla14> @ForecasterEnten @ThePlumLineGS Except for the fact that "winning" drives media coverage---which drives donations and swings votes.
707407559146078208 2016-03-08 03:27:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @bluemassgroup Stays in I think. 1, Hates Cruz, 2, Could delude himself about his chances in FL, and 3, Holm's pass-out> McGregor's tap-out.
707358787804356608 2016-03-08 00:14:11 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro Susan Collins.  End of list.
706905241791307776 2016-03-07 18:11:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @Nate_Cohn Win the delegates.  Kasich losing doesn't automatically mean he drops out, and winning doesn't me he stays in forever.
705626544195051523 2016-03-03 05:30:52 UTC <bosdcla14> @jbarro They also change the quote.  Rubio said "he's very flexible", his team changed that post-debate to "Donald's very flexible."
705584083024244736 2016-03-03 02:42:09 UTC <bosdcla14> @krystalball Didn't they agree earlier to lessen environmental regs & nix the EPA?  So there you go, extra lead for Flint apparently.
705583052295016449 2016-03-03 02:38:03 UTC <bosdcla14> @BCAppelbaum Remember, Vicente Fox insulted him and so he had to build the wall 10 feet higher?
705479423785500672 2016-03-03 19:46:16 UTC <bosdcla14> @tromney So Trump would not only win in 2016, he'd be reelected?
705471970154950656 2016-03-03 19:16:39 UTC <bosdcla14> @MittRomney I doubt this.  Did Mitt reject anyone's endorsement the last time?
705469278833631232 2016-03-03 19:05:57 UTC <bosdcla14> @latimes "A free ride to the White House" so Mitt's saying he thinks that---unlike him---Trump would win?

701977759485046784 2016-02-22 03:51:54 UTC <bosdcla14> @JuddLegum Trump has been strongly pro-Brady, and from his numbers in Massachusetts, The North Remembers.
701868749750534144 2016-02-22 20:38:44 UTC <bosdcla14> @PhilipRucker Any indication if this is related to the Cruz-Rubio sit down that happened not long before?
701614788602793984 2016-02-21 03:49:35 UTC <bosdcla14> @GroverNorquist I for one find @frankgaffney's insistence that you're enabling a Muslim Brotherhood takeover to be hilarious on all levels.
701602965618974720 2016-02-21 03:02:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @lrozen I suppose he could argue he's gotten classified briefings, but he kept playing hooky from so many of those.
701551129960710145 2016-02-21 23:36:38 UTC <bosdcla14> @chucktodd As the right became more unhinged, MSM stuck to "both sides do it."  Refusal to call it out nurtured the insanity we see now.
701544254368120835 2016-02-21 23:09:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie Amir continuing David Lee's tradition of having the highest-paid Celtic be the worst player on the team.  KO is really missed.
701230732924956672 2016-02-20 02:23:29 UTC <bosdcla14> @RichLowry Jeb is the Cooper Manning of the Bush Family.

701228811795337217 2016-02-20 02:15:51 UTC <bosdcla14> @jacko2323 Trump's numbers will exceed his RCP average, and the way he's wining by county means he'll likely win every SC delegate.

700886337671401472 2016-02-19 03:34:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @AndyOplas True.  But before nominees were stopped due to disapproval of the nominee, as opposed to one party's spite toward a POTUS.
700884154565562369 2016-02-19 03:26:18 UTC <bosdcla14> @AndyOplas Right, that's what will ultimately happen.  The Senate GOP will ignore their Constitutional duty to advise and consent.

700882059393265664 2016-02-19 03:17:59 UTC <bosdcla14> @lisamurkowski There is no such tradition.  You literally could not point to one example of a President not nominating 4 an open USSC seat.
700421835804975104 2016-02-18 20:49:13 UTC <bosdcla14> @JohnFugelsang Not sure the scale should go from "non-existent" at the low end to "non-consensual" at the high end.
700406322903150592 2016-02-18 19:47:34 UTC <bosdcla14> @AgenerationXer @Stonekettle @RedDemonLSX Yep, that was my reaction to you, alright. Apology accepted!  
700403315436232704 2016-02-18 19:35:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @AgenerationXer @Stonekettle @RedDemonLSX Gotcha.  So you'd have no problem if a POTUS did this, as long as that POTUS was Reagan.  Neat.
700398651869261824 2016-02-18 19:17:06 UTC <bosdcla14> @Stonekettle @AgenerationXer @RedDemonLSX So now it's ok if Obama goes if he also signs an agreement there?  Cool, cool.

698979584746790912 2016-02-14 21:18:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @PoliticalShort And GOP's "we won't confirm anyone no matter what" stance gives him every justification to go that route.

695784400957472768 2016-02-05 01:41:42 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie If he can move, yes, but right now I think Turner's a better Lebron option.  Also b/c Turner is now really good somehow.
695783922462883840 2016-02-05 01:39:48 UTC <bosdcla14> @KevinOConnorNBA He's been so great lately, particularly when he's on the floor with Zeller.
695783620108091392 2016-02-05 01:38:36 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie  I was surprised when they said he would play given his pre-game injury. He's ineffective & risking worse injury.  Sit please.
695782433929605120 2016-02-05 01:33:53 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie This game would be great if IT and Crowder weren't having horrible games.  Crowder seems hurt too badly to be playing.

695038991423266816 2016-02-03 00:19:43 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie I think the best pro-Dwight case is pretty simple: rebounding.  Averages 12 a game in 32 minutes.  PER of 20+.
694989390624350208 2016-02-03 21:02:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @Johngcole There are McDonald's in France.  Sometimes people want something that's fast and mediocre.
694980292730179584 2016-02-03 20:26:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @bballbreakdown Prior to the dribble...that's not a travel?
694928858462552064 2016-02-03 17:02:05 UTC <bosdcla14> @HPbasketball Paid $15 million to watch basketball. Sounds amazing.
694697701066149889 2016-02-02 01:43:33 UTC <bosdcla14> @CBSSportsMLB Similarly, the NFL would be better if in the NFC QBs were required to play DB against the other team's QB.
694346516463378432 2016-02-01 02:28:04 UTC <bosdcla14> @RedsArmy_Chuck I'm for it, but I'd also throw in the expected cap decline, and that he's a non-superstar I suppose.
694345649190404096 2016-02-01 02:24:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @NateSilver538 I think the "has staff organize a rally instead of organizing caucus-goers on caucus day" is probably a bigger factor.

694326283539345408 2016-02-01 01:07:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @BobSacamanoSr @StoolGreenie Way harder now to get a KG in a trade no matter what. Look at Sacto with DMC. Total refusal to consider offers.
694321993231896576 2016-02-01 00:50:37 UTC <bosdcla14> @BobSacamanoSr @StoolGreenie @FFAdvisorcom The point of having so many assets is to be able to trade them to improve. Only a 13 man roster.
693190265708785665 2016-01-29 21:53:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @ABCPolitics @jonkarl It is wild that ABC assigns JK to cover HRC after he helped a source lie & smear her re Benghazi email. MSM HATES her.

692880090087043074 2016-01-28 01:21:01 UTC <bosdcla14> @FoxBusiness @CarlyFiorina @HillaryClinton El Chapo escaped custody, not prosecution.  He was in prison after being convicted.
692540464982016002 2016-01-27 02:51:28 UTC <bosdcla14> @StoolGreenie That play was Peak Evan Turner.  Turns it over, somehow winds up with an assist.
692191432937963520 2016-01-26 03:44:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @AlanTonelson Waco siege used gas, left 76 dead.  Moscow theater siege used gas, left 130 hostages dead.  Seems like a worse solution IMHO.
692136046734213122 2016-01-26 00:04:27 UTC <bosdcla14> @McCannSportsLaw Does Brady's team get appellate fees and costs awarded if they win?
691769628738129921 2016-01-25 23:48:26 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo They could have gotten the target too & the other dead ppl are just a bonus, like getting a free wonton soup with your order.
691398995663454208 2016-01-24 23:15:40 UTC <bosdcla14> @FeitsBarstool Catch and he's down before the fumble, first down, Patriots?

691365089597747200 2016-01-24 21:00:56 UTC <bosdcla14> @jeffphowe Collins looked awful on two TDs.
691364842444173312 2016-01-24 20:59:58 UTC <bosdcla14> Where was Collins going?  Is he unaware that he should stay close to the guy  he's covering?
691357648738844673 2016-01-24 20:31:22 UTC <bosdcla14> Should have been a PI, but I hate throwing at it to try to draw a flag.  Try to beat the Broncos, not get calls from the refs.

689950087737380869 2016-01-20 23:18:14 UTC <bosdcla14> @jeffphowe Will the Walpole Police Department have official information to report about you murdering TMZ?
689949156790648833 2016-01-20 23:14:32 UTC <bosdcla14> @InternetHippo Seems like he might put something on his website about this next to his Netflix & Chill section.
