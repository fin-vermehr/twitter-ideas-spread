971565490626748416 2018-03-07 01:57:18 UTC <MrsMZ2u> Im sure this has nothing to do with the gaming industrys $36 Billion annual revenue.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/971564422174007296
971565142889517056 2018-03-07 01:55:55 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CNN The same video games that are played in most other countries without issue?
971540478272331777 2018-03-07 00:17:55 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @jasonschreier The gaming industrys revenue was $36 Billion last year. What is 45 up to?
971539473979777024 2018-03-07 00:13:55 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @Mr_JamesLandis @bosseone2 @KithKanan @JonEHecht @Postbro1 Ive met many adults that havent been imbued with wisdom. You know what these kids HAVENT had? A chance to be jaded and swayed by money, politics or skewed beliefs. But Marvin all of this is moot. Theyll be able to vote soon and Im here for it.
971451420137304064 2018-03-07 18:24:01 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @BeautyBind @mystcole Nothing to see here. Its just coincidence. Just like the last dead ex spy and the one before that.
971450548699344896 2018-03-07 18:20:34 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @kristenmuyres Its totally weird (but also Ive cried twice today, once was because an artist painted a picnic table with eyes on it)

971064472545603587 2018-03-06 16:46:26 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @NIX1331_ @SoFlaNat He said he was going to tear up the subpoena, on TV. He went off the rails and I think that was the first interview of the day  Its been painful to watch but also not.
971062696165560326 2018-03-06 16:39:22 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat @NIX1331_ I mean it wouldnt be the first time. I think this guy is spiraling though. I think hes scared. Also, I dont give a shit and he needs to turn over those emails.

970837909178802176 2018-03-05 01:46:09 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @Dalrymple I wonder how much pressure hes under. Weve seen what this administration can do in public, I cant imagine what theyre capable in private.

943862887428194305 2017-12-21 15:17:03 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @alisonkgerber My friend took her family to visit her mother in Germany last month. Her youngest got sick. The cost for the doctors visit and 2 meds was under $50. She was also surprised she could buy contact lenses at the pharmacy, no prescription needed.
943296319841435648 2017-12-19 01:45:42 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat We're going to call them Trump years. They're like dog years but much worse on the liver.
943273549665509377 2017-12-19 00:15:14 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @ryanstruyk Wow. This changes everything. 
943254932966141952 2017-12-19 23:01:15 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat A post last week said that the HOLLYWEED sign stunt happened this year. Why does it seem like 3 years ago?
942817229380259840 2017-12-18 18:01:58 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @goldengateblond Eh, at least ol Ted has a future as a Starbucks barista.
942816687434252288 2017-12-18 17:59:49 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @MetalMushin You insult him and then you block everyone who disagrees. You seem kind of sensitive, like a snowflake.
942455726915514368 2017-12-17 18:05:29 UTC <MrsMZ2u> What I say: I'm going to take a shower.  What my family hears: Flush all the toilets, just for fun.

942167224298610688 2017-12-16 22:59:05 UTC <MrsMZ2u> Wind has knocked out my power. I immediately got hungry and wanted to watch Netflix. There's nothing else to do but nap till this nightmare is over.

942109902247313408 2017-12-16 19:11:18 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @JohnTaylor84 I agree. The second one was a lot better.
942090269771448320 2017-12-16 17:53:18 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @marcorubio @ASlavitt @DoctorSchwartz It's all relative to where you live. We're looking at $1200 a month for 1 child. Bottom line, that $25 isn't shit.
942069973211480064 2017-12-16 16:32:39 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @JohnTaylor84 So I yelped at the helicopter blade vs giant bald head scene. Jesus. This was NOT what I remembered. Oh and gremlins effed me up recently too.
941973389509455872 2017-12-16 10:08:51 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @lumpylouise @ProfessorDNA @kavn @DianeRosemond I don't think people understand just how dangerous Pence is, how dangerous the whole administration is. 45 isn't doing this on his own. He doesn't have that level of intelligence.
941971385521356800 2017-12-16 10:00:53 UTC <MrsMZ2u> 6 year old me didn't think Raiders of the Lost Ark was this violent. For some reason I thought it was more like Goonies, you know but with Nazis.
941905733846679553 2017-12-15 05:40:01 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @jonnysun @nprmonkeysee Jesus, the boys are argumentative tonight.

941801022363541504 2017-12-15 22:43:56 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @daveentrentmann "inappropriate"? Fuck that. Pay this child. Pay for her therapist, pay for her education and fire every officer involved, even the ones that didn't step in and intervene.
941777114927210496 2017-12-15 21:08:56 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat Agreed!
941766404335845376 2017-12-15 20:26:22 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat I agree. I fear it's worse than what we are seeing. It's time to rip off the band aid and clean out the wounds. Bring it all to light. I feel this will help tremendously in our fight against rape culture as well.
941755077059948544 2017-12-15 19:41:21 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat Also, I'm sure Peter Jackson isn't alone. I don't fault him. Being told someone is difficult to work with, by an industry leader, what would you do? Would you chance millions on it?
941754532698112000 2017-12-15 19:39:12 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SoFlaNat By both I mean the Weinstein brothers, yes. My response wasn't clear and it almost reads as if I were speaking of Sorvino and Judd. Robert Weinstein is getting through this virtually unscathed and it's maddening.

941735040559472640 2017-12-15 18:21:44 UTC <MrsMZ2u> I often wonder why some of my favorite actresses just sort of disappear. Unfuckingbelievable. Both of these assholes need to be stripped of every award, every cent and then be convicted.https://twitter.com/MiraSorvino/status/941689525960556544

941558016184217600 2017-12-14 06:38:19 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @ABC7News @BarackObama @KatieMHill @NancyChenNews @HillaryPolitics @asheme08 Choked me up. I'm so glad he got the experience. There are a few clips of the kids and they're just ecstatic 
941526821081722880 2017-12-14 04:34:21 UTC <MrsMZ2u> FYI when a child tells you your bellybutton is far away, it essentially means your fat. Thanks, son.

What the hell is wrong with you? But Obama, but Hillary. Anything so you don't have to face the fact that Trump is incompetent.
941340824662503425 2017-12-14 16:15:16 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @SenFeinstein @LesleyCGaither You do know that 90% of guns are semiautomatic, right? The exceptions are mostly revolvers. I get having a stance, but educate yourself on it first.

764261440530165760 2016-08-12 00:45:01 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @sheseauxsaditty That losing your lover makes you realize you also lost yourself along the way. It's also possible to get both back.

706561225375678465 2016-03-06 19:24:58 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @Awkward_Duck I often warn my husband if there are scenes related to hangings. His college roommate died. I see it on his face, the pain.
706560326217510912 2016-03-06 19:21:23 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @Awkward_Duck scenes like that are for shock factor and bring no "awareness". We know child suicides are on the rise, we need scene warnings

704868407401775104 2016-03-01 03:18:18 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @ScottNevins True. The problem is with the possibility of a Sanders write in, thus splitting the dem vote. Trump will have it.

700445308069683200 2016-02-18 22:22:29 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @Andy People saying Pope should stay out of politics. Are they unaware Vatican City is a country and he is it's leader?
700421413300080641 2016-02-18 20:47:32 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @sacbee_news  Wait, wasn't this their worst album? Wasn't this during the Manson era?
700400471060586496 2016-02-18 19:24:19 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @DavidLeeOrr @CrewBishop  Trump wants to build the wall to protect us from MEXICO. You know that. Where's his Canadian Wall plan? Hmm?
700399937087909889 2016-02-18 19:22:12 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CrewBishop @DavidLeeOrr as they are to everyone. My point being suggesting the Vatican remove their wall is asinine.
700399282604503040 2016-02-18 19:19:36 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CrewBishop @DavidLeeOrr He's done more bridge building in his short papacy. It was a metaphorical statement to Trump. Quit being so literal
700398898460774401 2016-02-18 19:18:04 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CrewBishop @DavidLeeOrr Agreed. I'll end on this. The Pope didnt build the wall, the argument he should tear down the wall is ridiculous.
700397888380112896 2016-02-18 19:14:04 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CrewBishop @DavidLeeOrr and I believe they're no longer threatened by the Roman Empire either  ISIS or ISIL is a real threat though.
700397110206672896 2016-02-18 19:10:58 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @DavidLeeOrr @CrewBishop Never said freely. Can you freely enter Buckingham? The White House? You need to understand what the Vatican is.
700395065974239232 2016-02-18 19:02:51 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @CrewBishop @DavidLeeOrr Exactly! The wall of the Holy City has gates that are open. People can enter and pay homage.
700394414162620416 2016-02-18 19:00:15 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @DavidLeeOrr comparing the Berlin wall and the wall around the Holy City is asinine. What's next? Great wall of China? Irrelevant.
700392682158317568 2016-02-18 18:53:22 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @JdVrat10 @DavidLeeOrr more so. First walls went up in 840.
700392588583383040 2016-02-18 18:53:00 UTC <MrsMZ2u> @DavidLeeOrr  The first walls to the Vatican were built in the year 840. Times were different. Would you suggest he tear them down?
