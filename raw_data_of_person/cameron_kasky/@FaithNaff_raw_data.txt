971003922730094592 2018-03-06 12:45:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @RuPaul @TheBitchToilet @igott2bme Drag is art. Any gender can express art. I've known cis and trans men and women who've all been drag queens and/or kings ( I do know people who perform both genders).
970979691338354689 2018-03-06 11:09:33 UTC <FaithNaff> Dear gay community,  When you defend RuPaul's transphobia as his "right to his own opinion", you become the very monsters that generations of queers before you marched, protested, were arrested, and killed resisting.  You are now the privileged, intolerant ones.
970975049111998464 2018-03-06 10:51:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @RuPaul @BenGidman @harrywright93 "Don't be so offended." "Can't anyone have their own opinion anymore?" "This is what's wrong with America."  Has the gay community really gotten privileged enough to start using lines from the same script as Republicans when it comes to other groups acceptance?
970973014480375808 2018-03-06 10:43:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @RuPaul, here is the lesson I impart...  Transgender women are women; fully, completely, unconditionally. Physical changes we make to ourselves are to better our lives, not be more convincing queens. Thank you for this first step.https://twitter.com/RuPaul/status/970810665685299201
970971658419933184 2018-03-06 10:37:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @heartedkaty @DerekPlease Forgiving and forgetting are not the same thing. I'm willing to give RuPaul another shot, but it will be done with great caution.

970738935994437632 2018-03-05 19:12:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs Drag is about more than the look. It's also about the performance. Trans women can't "act" like women because they already are women. If you're unwilling to accot this for cis women then it should apply to trans women too.
970738487396794368 2018-03-05 19:11:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs That reaks of the "real" vs. "not real" women mentality.
970738290293985280 2018-03-05 19:10:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs Same here. But the issue here is identity and not body. He is willing to take trans women who aren't physically transitioning while excluding cis women all together.
970737971476467714 2018-03-05 19:09:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs And I'm okay with him keeping it a boys club, even if I don't personally agree with it. My issue is that excluding cis women because they're women should mean trans women are excluded for the same reason. It plays into the "real" women toxic narrative.
970737632090058752 2018-03-05 19:07:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs We'll, we at least agree on that.   I hate the notion of trans women having masculine bodies. It just adds to the "not really women" rhetoric.
970734829326172162 2018-03-05 18:56:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs I'm friend with cis women queens. Drag is an art form and I resist the notion of any form of art being off limits to anyone.
970733593927483392 2018-03-05 18:51:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs That's very true. It's also the "defense" some of my older drag queen friends made of him in response to my post.
970733266469838848 2018-03-05 18:50:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs As far as "being women" they are interchangeable. If cis women can't participate solely because they're women, it's misogynistic to exclude trans women for any other reason.
970732129997946886 2018-03-05 18:45:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs In what way?
970729631350513664 2018-03-05 18:35:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs I just happened to have written this yesterday...https://genderexpressive.wordpress.com/2018/03/04/rupaul-and-trans-exclusion-in-drag/

970496957490876416 2018-03-04 03:11:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @womensmarch @hjfrousseau It's not good to assume someone who presents themselves as cis isn't actually trans and scared to come out of the closet. That's why "openly" matters.

970486523975159810 2018-03-04 02:29:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @Capt_Mal27 @RealmofHorror 1) why is anyone dropping their pants in front of anyone in a bathroom?  2) my safety trumps your discomfort that you might not know what the genitals of the woman in the next stall look like. Sorry not sorry.
970485768719388674 2018-03-04 02:26:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @RealmofHorror @CateSpice All of that is important, but peeing in peace isn't exactly way down on my list. Yes, I fight for access to bathroom space where I'm safe and comfortable. Does that upset you? Well, die mad about it.

Second, drag is a great article form, but a big reason why I don't go to the gay bar so much anymore is because I'm always afraid people see me as just another queen.

969935185541238784 2018-03-03 13:59:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro Not to be insulting either, but why should I take your opinion on this over that of the trained specialists I've seen? The American Phycological Association doesn't classify being transgender as a mental disorder because it's not.
969934358957215744 2018-03-03 13:55:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro I did get help. I saw multiple psychological experts and several doctors. Transition was the thing they suggested I do. I did it and now my life is so much better. What's more, my transition isn't hurting anyone. I don't see why you think any of this is a bad thing.
969933754578997250 2018-03-03 13:53:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @Wyatt_a_m @allyhoffmann_ @Audi_4_life This is the most intellectually stimulating debate I've ever witnessed.   Also, some dudes have uteruses. Get over it.
969808472333205504 2018-03-02 05:35:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @LittleNomiRose See questions up front.  Ask for the names others who are being interviewed. If anyone on the list is anti trans, walk away. They're trying to frame it like being transphobic has merrit.   And about the theme of the piece, what they SPECIFICALLY want to show about trans people.
969805513126006784 2018-03-02 05:23:47 UTC <FaithNaff> CW: possible dysphoria triggers.  Okay, I know passing isn't the point, but I feel like I just won the cis-passing Olympics. I sang Amy Lee karaoke in a packed straight bar and the crowd loved it. Not saying I sound like an angel, but they couldn't tell I'm #transgender.pic.twitter.com/dudj5iRrRP
969749574549204992 2018-03-02 01:41:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @kelbotsia @katiekelaidis Not exactly polite dinner conversation. 
969748643078123520 2018-03-02 01:37:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @kelbotsia @katiekelaidis I think the argument was more about using it as a generalized term for everyone rather than a personal identification with one's own body.
969747710453657601 2018-03-02 01:34:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @kelbotsia @katiekelaidis Hey, sounds good. More power to you (no sarcasm). I often refer to my penis as lady parts too.

969723955069235201 2018-03-02 23:59:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @Ze_Goth_Prince @roo_b_arts So the definitions of words are important unless they're ones you deem as postmodernist garbage and then it doesn't matter?
969720152093753345 2018-03-02 23:44:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro Transitioning was a choice. Being Transgender was not. Transitioning was the necessity for the reality of being transgender.
969719103530373120 2018-03-02 23:40:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @US_Defender @DannyJaycox2 This whole thread is about how transgender men have uteruses. Where have you been?
969718567477370880 2018-03-02 23:38:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @roo_b_arts @Ze_Goth_Prince Transgender men are men. Transgender men have uteruses. Therefore.... Some men have a uterus.   That's pretty focused.
969718305731829760 2018-03-02 23:37:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro Not my choice. Tried to embrace masculinity. Couldn't do it. Was severely depressed and suicidal. Transitioned and that went away. I love life now. Clearly, I found the solution to the problem.
969717386684313600 2018-03-02 23:33:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @US_Defender @DannyJaycox2 So, you respect my gender identity as female but don't respect the identities of transgender men? I'm confused.
969717089467543552 2018-03-02 23:32:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @US_Defender @DannyJaycox2 @BubbaruffRBLX I am under no obligation to respect a stance of "you are not who you say you are".
969716870277459974 2018-03-02 23:31:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro I promise you, this is the last thing I would have chosen for myself. I spent decades trying to unchoose it. You can't just not be trans. It doesn't work.
969716576659410947 2018-03-02 23:30:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @roo_b_arts @Ze_Goth_Prince Words defined.pic.twitter.com/ctocNNe4kt
969715144665255939 2018-03-02 23:24:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @Rhotos Trans men have a uterus. Nothing incorrect there.
969714706603757568 2018-03-02 23:22:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro More accepting is not the same as generally accepting. Also, the reaction of one's family is the most important. I didn't come out until my early 30's because I knew my parents would reject me for it. It only takes one person to make you afraid and hopeless.
969714297382359041 2018-03-02 23:21:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @US_Defender @DannyJaycox2 Your statement about how men can't have uteruses is clearly transphobic. Not exactly a stretch.   My pronouns are she/her. Question is, will you continue to use them now that you know I'm trans.
969712532859613184 2018-03-02 23:14:18 UTC <FaithNaff> Lol.pic.twitter.com/ckcCEntSEV
969712178180841474 2018-03-02 23:12:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @PPIndKentucky @US_Defender @DannyJaycox2 Says the transphobe who unknowingly referred to a transgender woman as "lady". (See, it's not so difficult to respect people's identity)
969711772084129792 2018-03-02 23:11:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro See, you say that, and yet when transgender people seek psychological help they're advised to transition and live authentically, which then greatly improves their quality of life. Suicide rate is a result of social acceptance far more than inner turmoil.
969707686232313857 2018-03-02 22:55:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @akaBavaro Thank you, random person on Twitter.  Let's see what experts have to say...http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx

969563641468080129 2018-03-02 13:22:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @americastarling I don't think it's an answer we can fully understand because so much of it goes on quietly in the minds of people absorbing and interpreting the media and having it influence their understanding. It's not an answer we'll parce out until years later.
969561376942419968 2018-03-02 13:13:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @americastarling That is definitely the split. The question though is whether those realities come together as either a net positive or negative for us.
969560606813630464 2018-03-02 13:10:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Discussion time: do you think the sudden ubiquity of drag queens in mainstream culture has helped or hurt the public understanding of transgender women? Does their visibility raise queer acceptance overall, or does drag lend to further confusion about gender variance?
969540418210811904 2018-03-02 11:50:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs @KatyMontgomerie The closest America ever came to true capitalism did amass us great wealth overall. It also gave us slavery, child labor, hazardous work conditions, etc. Free markets make money. Socialism creates a society more people can be happy in.

However, I think you should know that your efforts, intentional or not have scared me away...
969190329495760896 2018-03-01 12:39:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges If you're even asking, you're definitely not cis.

969163973462581248 2018-03-01 10:54:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @TheRedGrrl @KatyMontgomerie I have 2 guns (NO assault rifles!), but I'm in no way a gun nut. I have WAY more dresses and makeup than I do ammunition. 
969162929487712256 2018-03-01 10:50:23 UTC <FaithNaff> Thank you, @Walmart for taking steps to control guns. I'm still not shopping with you since you fired all those Co managers after getting a huge block of money from the Government, but even reprehensible organizations get something right occasionally.
969162375004872705 2018-03-01 10:48:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @UPS @Walmart @DICKS @Hertz @united @Delta @ananavarro With you up until Walmart. Glad they did what they did, but it doesn't excuse decades of worker abuses.
969161480074678272 2018-03-01 10:44:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @KatyMontgomerie @TheRedGrrl I knew I wanted to be a girl when I was 6. My bullies taught me really quick that I wasn't allowed to. Thus started 20 years of suppression and trying to act masculine.

968667353230856193 2018-02-27 02:01:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @LilacWrenTG @OhMiaGod How about June 30th? It's in the middle of the year between remembrance day and visibility day. It's also the last day of pride month.
968612170639474688 2018-02-27 22:21:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @LilacWrenTG Too close to day if visibility. I think it should be in the summer to split between visibility and remembrance.

Look, I'm not saying that Shuri should do it and RiRi sounds awesome. I'm just requesting that comic fans explain that in a way that isn't elitist and turns potential new people off from the fandom.

968296705161654272 2018-02-26 01:28:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @LilacWrenTG I like the idea of having a day to draw attention to it though. So much of our stories are steeped in homelessness and unemployment. And those are very real problems trans people face, it's important to show that many of us have accomplished great things.
968294726200971264 2018-02-26 01:20:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod what day are we doing this on?

968283566672175109 2018-02-26 00:36:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @SLAwrites They don't want to acknowledge transgender men because their very existence debunks every asinine argument against trans women.

968271341119066112 2018-02-26 23:47:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Dude had the audacity to try and correct my usage of "you're" when I'd not only used it right, but he'd made a typo in his first sentence. Unfortunately, after I called him out, he blocked me before I could screen grab it.
968267671132393472 2018-02-26 23:32:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @_ChristopherM Um, no? It's "you're", as in, "you are", as in "you are talking about..." And you really think you can play the English superiority card when you started your Tweet with, "It's an common issue..."?
968267054297092098 2018-02-26 23:30:29 UTC <FaithNaff> This is just about the purest example of elitist fanboyism I've ever seen. https://twitter.com/_ChristopherM/status/968264620174659584
968266787220488193 2018-02-26 23:29:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM In what world does "Shuri would be a cool Iron Man" equate to "WE CAN'T HAVE ANY MORE BLACK CHARACTERS!"?
968266534547329024 2018-02-26 23:28:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM @the_moviebob If it was presented like, "I know a lot of people think Shuri would make a great Iron Man, but let me tell you about RiRi and how Shuri can be the next Black Panther", then you can share knowledge and not be elitist and condescending about it.

968266041972396032 2018-02-26 23:26:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @_ChristopherM Hey kids, make sure you get into the fun hobby of comic book reading so longtime fans don't imply you're either uneducated or racist when you have opinions about movies.
968265721808588805 2018-02-26 23:25:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM Wow, that's a rather elitist perspective.
968263596789641221 2018-02-26 23:16:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM You were clearly talking generally about people with the same opinion I had upon seeing Black Panther.
968263266316189696 2018-02-26 23:15:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM I went and saw a movie. There was a kickass girl who does science stuff and is snarky like Tony. I thought, "hey, she would make a cool next Iron Man".  So sorry I didn't immediately go research comic lore. None of my other entertainment has required homework involved.
968262319724728320 2018-02-26 23:11:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @_ChristopherM I responded to a Tweet that was on my feed and I felt misrepresented the people making this callout.
968262120671465473 2018-02-26 23:10:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @_ChristopherM You're talking about people saying Shuri would make a cool next Iron Man: a group I fall into. I don't read comics, just like a LOT of MCU moviegoers. Just because we didn't know Shuri becomes Black Panther doesn't mean we are racist for thinking that would be cool.
968260769841377281 2018-02-26 23:05:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Okay, settle down. A lot of us DON'T read comics but DO like Marvel movies so we didn't know all that. I just thought Shuri was a kick-ass character and it would be fun to see her take over for Downey Jr. when he retires. my lack of comics knowledge isn't racism. https://twitter.com/_ChristopherM/status/968258489586999296
968259918057951232 2018-02-26 23:02:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @_ChristopherM Um...okay. I legit just thought Shuri would make a cool Iron Man. I'm not versed in comic lore or continuity but thought "awesome science character who could replace Downey when he retires".   But hey, thanks for equating my lack of comic knowledge with racism.

968215241325719559 2018-02-26 20:04:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @NOH8Campaign @Flarvik I'm just sick of the full LGBT acronym being used when something only applies to sexual orientation. It gives the false impression that we've all been helped so we can move on to the next issue.

967917128211992576 2018-02-25 00:20:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @BardCollege @xychelsea @Chickmiko You mentioned none of that in the initial tweet and threw in a clunky honorific to specify that you don't see her as a woman. Who exactly are you trying to fool?
967916619371634688 2018-02-25 00:17:59 UTC <FaithNaff> This honestly seems like a strange thing for Ryan to say. His voter base is driven to action by anger and fear. "Chill, we got this" isn't going to help his chances.https://twitter.com/AP/status/967874608128036865

967865992801112065 2018-02-25 20:56:49 UTC <FaithNaff> Left wing protests lead to businesses and organizations feeling the pressure to either change or fold.  Right wing protests lead to whiney snowflakes smashing their coffee makers and burning jerseys because black people get rights too.
967844786626531328 2018-02-25 19:32:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 I personally don't want to see anyone punching anyone's faces in. Sports like that are barbaric.
967842210103398401 2018-02-25 19:22:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 The sports system of sex separation was agreed upon without taking into account that trans people exist. I'm willing to make a new system that's based on body characteristics (height, weight, etc) instead of genitalia, but until then, I don't care if an advantage exists.
967841409289027585 2018-02-25 19:19:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 Your whole point boils down to the fact that I'm not a cisgender woman, and that's true. I am not nor will I ever be. It sucks, but that's life. But there's no reason that should take my identity away or negate my being treated as the woman I am.
967841031994650624 2018-02-25 19:17:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 Transgender women are indeed women. I wear women's clothes. I use a women's restroom. I'm referred to as "she", "her", and "ma'am". Taking these truths into consideration and deducing I'm NOT a woman is what doesn't make any sense.
967840505383018496 2018-02-25 19:15:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 Do I wish I was a cisgender woman? Yeah. Am I ever going to be one? No. Is that any reason to deny my identity when it isn't hurting anyone? Also no.

No one was oppressed when my wardrobe switched. No one was oppressed when I started hormones.  No one was oppressed when people started referring to me as "she".
967839078174613505 2018-02-25 19:09:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 It isn't? Really? Because you're spending an awful lot of time trying to convince me I'm not really a woman. Can't see why you'd be doing that if you didn't have a vested interest in either changing my mind or making me feel guilty/sad/whatever.
967837894479175680 2018-02-25 19:05:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 I have zero interest in convincing you of my femininity. That would be a waste of time. I have family and friends who respect me, so some troll on Twitter is just an interesting distraction on a rainy Sunday.
967837474755096576 2018-02-25 19:03:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 And yet so many cisgender women aren't feeling imposed on by my identity. Stop making up problems.
967834986794582016 2018-02-25 18:53:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 What exactly is an imposition about cisgender male/transgender male and cisgender woman/transgender woman? You want my opinion? Here it is: you're overcomplicating this in order to make it sound like some great burden on society.
967824842446778369 2018-02-25 18:13:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 I did no such thing. I said your feelings on the matter change nothing.
967823606213464065 2018-02-25 18:08:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 And yet your feelings on the matter in no way stop me from living my life so...again...I don't care.
967803321066098690 2018-02-25 16:47:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 The wisdom of someone called skankhunter is not something to give weight to.
967802938981789696 2018-02-25 16:46:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 I really don't care.
967801739071164421 2018-02-25 16:41:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 So... I'm gonna just keep trusting psychological and physiological experts on the validity of trans identities instead of some nobody on Twitter. Kbye.
967800712141918208 2018-02-25 16:37:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @scorpixon @skankhunter__42 I have absolutely no idea what you're trying to say.
967608633151447046 2018-02-24 03:54:10 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey everyone, @cameronesposito is about to win heteronormativity bingo.https://twitter.com/cameronesposito/status/967462172501651457
967583984233451520 2018-02-24 02:16:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @Valentine_Wolfe Yours isn't for an individual, so pronouns wouldn't be expected.
967415831968866305 2018-02-24 15:08:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Nothing like the look on the face of a couple of old woman missionaries when they find out they knocked on the door of a house full of people who are queer af. It's going to be a good day.
967408784317599745 2018-02-24 14:40:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Reminder to cis people: a really small but highly impactful thing you can do to support the transgender community is include your pronouns in your Twitter bio. Please help to normalize this practice.

966508002760118272 2018-02-21 03:00:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Figuring out how to arm teachers instead of passing gun control measures is like watching people aruge about how to start a fire by rubbing sticks together when there's a book of matches right next to them.

964619217843744768 2018-02-16 21:55:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Okay, first real test. Mexican food for dinner. Can I do a no meat meal here? #VeggieAdventure
964578702364499969 2018-02-16 19:14:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco On the contrary, I think they would get a gun budget that dwarfed the budget they need for supplies.
964573564350402560 2018-02-16 18:53:53 UTC <FaithNaff> It's astounding how many people would rather expect teachers to engage in open combat with school shooters than pass sensible gun reform. Teachers shouldn't have to double as cops, as soldiers. What kind of dystopia are you wanting to live in?

963948876943290368 2018-02-14 01:31:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @_celia_marie_ @Forte_x_Melody Any level of suck she had would have been DRASTICALLY lower than what we're currently going through.
963905668620148737 2018-02-14 22:39:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @PRyan offer thoughts and prayers. Go on, we all know you're going to. We all know it's all you'll fucking do. Offer thoughts and prayers to these grieving parents and go back to letting the NRA pay you to look the other way.  You goddamn coward.
963903744663609344 2018-02-14 22:32:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Has the body count of innocent children outweighed those checks the @NRA cut you yet, @GOP? Any chance you can finally try being human beings and give us some fucking #GunControlNow ?!?!

Trans people have to come and change my mind."  I've got better things to do, sport. If you lack even basic compassion, I'd be wasting my time.

963196558400421893 2018-02-12 23:42:09 UTC <FaithNaff> Privileged people say things like, "what does it matter if [person who did X] is gay/black/trans/latinx/etc.? Why does that have to be a part of it?"  These people have never known what a lack of representation feels like.  Ever.
963150678184017921 2018-02-12 20:39:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @twosoftevenings That's what I'm worried about. I wonder if I'll ever be able to do this.

963080416432357378 2018-02-12 16:00:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 Good on you, honey. Have fun with your racist gameshow host who can't even spell. 
963080197431062529 2018-02-12 15:59:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 So using the bathroom is like speeding down the highway? I mean, I've run pretty fast before if I'd been holding it a while, but otherwise you're making some lousy parallels.
963075928934019072 2018-02-12 15:42:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 Oh! Fun fact! My last Tweet was sent from a public womens bathroom. You'll be shocked to hear that no one got hurt or was in any way inconvenienced.
963073900585373696 2018-02-12 15:34:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 Wow, you are just really hung up on this, aren't you?
963073564789346305 2018-02-12 15:33:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 And I'm sure you've exhausted several hours studying this topic. That's why your stance here is so important.

963069793724256256 2018-02-12 15:18:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 Now I know you're worrying a lot about something that doesn't affect you and I think it's kinda sad.
963068936408494081 2018-02-12 15:15:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 .....um......sure..... *eye roll*
963068634347331584 2018-02-12 15:13:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 And if trans people ever become a viable threat to any of those people, maybe then we'll talk. Otherwise, they're much more likely to be hurt by a cisgender teacher, coach, or priest. Worry about actual preditors.
963067784484749312 2018-02-12 15:10:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 Again, thank you for providing the random nobody on Twitter opinion. I will give it as much weight as it deserves (read: none at all)
963067297937149952 2018-02-12 15:08:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @SonOfThor1060 If you say so, random nobody on Twitter. I'll stick with my trained medical and psychological experts.

962861561294610432 2018-02-11 01:30:59 UTC <FaithNaff> Been trying so hard not to let dysphoria drag me down today, but it's just not working.
962794505580744707 2018-02-11 21:04:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @stalkofyarrow Haven't we all?
962794382041722882 2018-02-11 21:04:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod It was a triumphant day when I first went to work with makeup on. It was also triumphant the first day after that I said "fuck it" and decided not to.
962767118033915904 2018-02-11 19:15:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges I would rather be a dysphoric trans woman than a cis man.
962766805566722050 2018-02-11 19:14:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @mololabo We all know that feeling and respect the cry for help.
962747536862863361 2018-02-11 17:57:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe My personal favorite: "trans women still exhibit male aggression. Watch how angry and combative this one gets when I barade her with insults and derogatory remarks!"
962725996591026183 2018-02-11 16:32:18 UTC <FaithNaff> ...own set of instructions, that will still make it "other". And what's more, I'll be getting it at age 34 at the absolute earliest. I won't have grown up with it, been able to get to know it. It will always be different. I will always be different.
962725995462778880 2018-02-11 16:32:18 UTC <FaithNaff> And it hurts like fuck. It kills me because I know my brain is wired for all of that. Everything about that night was my world, and yet it wasn't. And it's not even like it's a goal I can set. I'll never have that. Even if I get SRS, my vagina will have its own needs, its...
962725994158284800 2018-02-11 16:32:18 UTC <FaithNaff> ...cis female perspective. It got harder to hear the presenter talk about how toys I have no use for feel on body parts I don't have. It got unbearable to hear all the women in the crowd talk about experiences I can never and will never have.

962725991524327424 2018-02-11 16:32:17 UTC <FaithNaff> And it kills me. It kills me because I want it. I crave it. I was at a Valentines Day party with a bunch of cis women last night. It was a blast. Everyone treated me like one of the girls and the couple I did come out to seemed genuinely shocked that...
962725989854973952 2018-02-11 16:32:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Nothing will ever remove the time I spent pretending to be a guy and being fucking miserable doing it. There will never be a time when I'm with a group of cis women and the topic turns to something having to do with anatomy and I won't suddenly be the odd one out.
962725988542140417 2018-02-11 16:32:16 UTC <FaithNaff> Is technically possible. And there's hope in the future for things like a uterus transplant. But being cisgender? That's impossible. There's nothing to do about that but just mourn what never was. Nothing will ever give me a life where I was socialized female.
962725987220942848 2018-02-11 16:32:16 UTC <FaithNaff> The hardest type of dysphoria is simply wishing you were cis. There is no silver lining to that one, there is no hope on the horizon. You can turn just about any other dysphoria into action: wanting hormones, wanting feminine facial features, even wanting a goddamn vagina...

962382133682753536 2018-02-10 17:45:55 UTC <FaithNaff> @IzabelaKaramia I'm a mom already and love it. Never had a desire to carry a kid though (still don't). Just don't care about having a uterus. Definitely want a vagina though, but that's not for birthing purposes. 
962380725701042177 2018-02-10 17:40:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @IzabelaKaramia Men are all I fantasize about now.
962379432886448129 2018-02-10 17:35:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @IzabelaKaramia I had mental and emotional changes I didn't expect. Biggest one is my bisexuality went from preferring women to preferring men.
962378357290696704 2018-02-10 17:30:55 UTC <FaithNaff> I miss feeling growing pains in my breasts.  #transgender

But the storm didn't destroy our bond, and that has served as a sturdy foundation as we put the pieces back together.
961949093244342272 2018-02-09 13:05:10 UTC <FaithNaff> In that moment, I think he could at least feel the burden that had been lifted off me, even if he didn't fully understand it. We've been slowly building our relationship back ever since. Coming out was like a hurricane that destroyed everything we'd built as a family...
961949091482791939 2018-02-09 13:05:10 UTC <FaithNaff> ...the subject and talk about something easy, like work or how my son was doing. It felt like old times again, if just for a moment. Something funny was said and I laughed. I caught him staring at me. When I asked why, he said that he hadn't seen me smile that genuinely in years.
961949089930891266 2018-02-09 13:05:09 UTC <FaithNaff> ...he at least wanted to. He was trying. He said he may never be able to think of me as a daughter, and that was hard to take. Still, he promised to never stop loving me. There was one moment though where I knew there was hope. With the mood so dark, we decided to change...

961949084927119361 2018-02-09 13:05:08 UTC <FaithNaff> When we did finally connect again, it was my dad wanting to try and clear the air. We met for lunch that day. It was the first time I'd ever been around him as myself; in some ways a dream come true, and in others and absolutely terrifying ordeal.
961949083119312897 2018-02-09 13:05:08 UTC <FaithNaff> ...betrayed them. My mom called and texted constantly, always when in tears, asking why the hell I would possibly be doing this. There was no answer to satisfy. After a month or so they just stopped contacting me. I didn't hear from either of them for another 3 months or so.
961949081336778753 2018-02-09 13:05:07 UTC <FaithNaff> It wasn't easy after that. Hell, it was honestly the hardest part of this whole ordeal. My relationship with my parents had always been so close, so strong. This shattered it, almost to the point where it was as unsalvageable. I felt like it was my fault, like I'd...
961949077272514561 2018-02-09 13:05:06 UTC <FaithNaff> It's been 2 years to the day since my parents found out I'm transgender.

960658957596594177 2018-02-05 23:38:38 UTC <FaithNaff> As long as there is a social construct of gender, there will be people who don't align with what is considered normal. People are who they say they are, to their own detriment or benefit. My womanhood is not beholden to the tribulations of cis women under the patriarchy...
960658954832539648 2018-02-05 23:38:37 UTC <FaithNaff> ...a lot of the crap arguments against trans women. Being male is a pretty sweet gig in our culture, yet there are plenty of men who were assigned female at birth. No one is telling them they aren't really mem because they, "haven't suffered enough".
960658951888130049 2018-02-05 23:38:36 UTC <FaithNaff> ...so trans women would still be trans, even if being a woman was a goddamn cake walk. If you want proof of this...LOOK AT TRANS MEN! Yes, trans men, that entire group of the demographic everyone keeps ignoring in this conversation but very much exist and serve as foil to...
960658949048586242 2018-02-05 23:38:36 UTC <FaithNaff> It's no wonder TERFs are so angry all the time. They seem to believe that to be a woman is to suffer. In the context of our patriarchal society, that's often the case, and it fucking sucks. HOWEVER, transgender identity exists independently of any social structure...
960656127561256960 2018-02-05 23:27:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I am 1000% fucking done with having to constantly validate my female identity and I'm a BILLION % done with having to do so in the context of how much suffering I've endured.

960562146248679424 2018-02-05 17:13:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley My first instinct is and always will be to believe victims. I'm just not inclined to turn my back on Dier for accusations that start and stop at Tweets.
960551188654624768 2018-02-05 16:30:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR It's a shame he can't live long enough to serve this sentence. What a monster.
960550929958428672 2018-02-05 16:29:22 UTC <FaithNaff> I've been in a weird mood lately. It's like, not happy but not sad. Something is missing that I can identify emotionally but not logically.
960541409139920897 2018-02-05 15:51:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @SoulfirePhotos @Cinzia_DuBois Interested in YA fantasy from a trans woman author?
960528763900526597 2018-02-05 15:01:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Honest question: have the sexual assault allegations against Andi Dier been escalated to actual legal filings or is it just still social media comments? Not looking to start something: just seeking facts.
960527653051748353 2018-02-05 14:56:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @DianaSh64001589 I had my last laser appointment a month ago, though I'm considering going back sometime to have other areas done since I liked the results so much.

960501219797229569 2018-02-05 13:11:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod When people say people liked Joe I'm like, "why? He was always depressed and standoffish. You spent every moment with him asking 'whats wrong' and just just accepting it when he said 'Im just tired'. Why would you want that back?! I'm fun now, godammit!

960276963440066561 2018-02-04 22:20:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @womensmarch @toadbaiter It turned to shouting because Rose rolled her eyes and groaned as soon as she saw a trans woman asking her an uneasy question.
960276613131833344 2018-02-04 22:19:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe @womensmarch @BadgerPundit You can't end a horrific statement about other-ing a group of people with the phrase, "live and let live".
960237843955281920 2018-02-04 19:45:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @rosemcgowan @womensmarch @mtgjy @viktorikas7 How can you possibly say her message wasn't valid? You can argue delivery method all you want, but the message is absolutely valid.
960221844107341824 2018-02-04 18:41:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @rosemcgowan @womensmarch @viktorikas7 Disgusting is Rose rolling her eyes and groaning the moment she realized a trans woman was asking her an actually tough question. If I'd been met with that response, I'd be yelling too.
960193944914219009 2018-02-04 16:50:50 UTC <FaithNaff> The Women's March officially stands for trans women! My heart is overjoyed!https://twitter.com/womensmarch/status/959560253850509315
960193279106174976 2018-02-04 16:48:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @rosemcgowan @womensmarch @viktorikas7 Yea, and those uppity black men should save their protest for after our contrived faux display of patriotism before we play sports! How dare you bring injustice to my attention at a time that is inconvenient for me!

960191579888783360 2018-02-04 16:41:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @womensmarch @dacamovatib Cisgender means you identify with the gender you were assigned at birth. 
960191410023682050 2018-02-04 16:40:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @QueerDSA @womensmarch @JodyCoyote12 Thank you! People say the truth when they don't have time to prepare something else. To shout "I don't live on your planet" and "what have you done for women" is elitist bullshit of the highest Calibur.

959839110771937280 2018-02-03 17:20:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @RobertFloresNJ So, you've already indicated that any story I share exposing Trump's racism (which, this was about Pence, so is it just a knee-jerk reaction to bring Trump into it?) will be dismissed as fake news, so why bother?

959461971333648385 2018-02-02 16:22:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain Absolutely. 
959461401071931392 2018-02-02 16:19:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain When do you wanna Skype?
959460276771975168 2018-02-02 16:15:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain I've known cis women who could shout down god. Then again, I'm an American, and a lot of us have a wholly undeserved sense of superiority which manifests in brashness, so perhaps it's just a cultural thing.
959458587687964672 2018-02-02 16:08:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain Case in point: Hillary Clinton is pretty loud.
959458244199632897 2018-02-02 16:07:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain Also, volume isn't tied to masculinity as much as pitch. Plenty of cis women are known for not being soft spoken. 
959457895866920960 2018-02-02 16:06:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain When practicing, don't worry about volume. Use as much air as you need to achieve the desired sound. Once the muscles get used to holding it, you can dial it back to a more reasonable volume. This is why I suggest singing. When you sing, being loud doesn't feel weird.
959457223624847360 2018-02-02 16:03:22 UTC <FaithNaff> My soft-spoken, autistic son just asked our Google Home how she feels today and my heart melted into goo. 
959455484733476864 2018-02-02 15:56:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain Also experiment with different volumes of air.
959455341250564097 2018-02-02 15:55:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain No problem. Also, try this as an exercise: pick a note that you can comfortably hold in your normal voice and hold it in falsetto. Once you've got it, just play with the muscles in your throat and soft pallet to shape it. See how different muscle positions change the sound.
959453446469570560 2018-02-02 15:48:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain I'd be willing to do a Skype call or something sometime if you wanted to chat.

959447295485009921 2018-02-02 15:23:55 UTC <FaithNaff> @upandoutcomic @KatyMontgomerie I knew I was trans after meeting a trans person in my twenties. It had nothing to do with thinking it was cool or being persuaded. Rather, knowing him helped my mind figure out it's life-long "this is why you always feel off and out of place" mystery.

958877882708889600 2018-01-31 01:41:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @smaclean8 What matters is that trans and cis women share a common enemy. It's pointless to focus on how that enemy hurts us in different ways.

958652784265584641 2018-01-31 10:46:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @addamschloe After marriage equality passed, pride went from a movement to a party. Meanwhile, those who attacked the gays shifted their focus to trans people. They don't want to fight for us after we helped fight for them. They just want to party now.

958503440933584896 2018-01-30 00:53:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I love my boss. He saw me the other day and said, "Faith, you colored your hair". I nodded, and with a big grin he said, "two failed marriages have taught me I'm supposed to notice when you women do shit like that". It was hilarious.

957622985115959297 2018-01-28 14:34:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges God, when I first started to come out I had a TON of cis women say, "oh, you don't want to be a woman because X". Honey, I don't want to transition to get X. I'm willing to take X to get all the other stuff you take for granted but I would die for.
957621137818648576 2018-01-28 14:27:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges And also the pains of menstruation and child birth. TERFs define womanhood by the ways in which they suffer, and I find that sad.

956680190989623296 2018-01-25 00:08:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod The only thing that ever worked for me (kinda) was putting orange eye shadow on the goatee area under my foundation. Orange neutralizes blue, which is the hue of beard stubble.  So glad laser hair removal took that burden away from me.

955974157736579074 2018-01-23 01:22:55 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR And this is another reason why religion is a net negative for humanity. We'd be better off without it entirely.

955531510622445570 2018-01-22 20:03:59 UTC <FaithNaff> Damn, @neiltyson! Looking good! https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/955516431088738304
955500991813685248 2018-01-22 18:02:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @RileyJayDennis @EmTheLostBoy @Political_Imani @JaneTea4 I usually wear it on a t-shirt. 
955487161641590785 2018-01-22 17:07:46 UTC <FaithNaff> It's profoundly creepy how often a man's "I find you attractive" stare and "I can tell you're trans" stare are indistinguishable.

955474615962406912 2018-01-22 16:17:54 UTC <FaithNaff> It's always a laugh when TERFs feel obligated to tell me I'm "not a real woman" and then claim I'm being a misogynist when I say I don't care what they think.
955455526300766210 2018-01-22 15:02:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @GuildingLilly @IzabelaKaramia They're proudly trans exclusionary, and they're proudly radical feminists, but for some reason it's insulting if you just put it all together.

955453709277900800 2018-01-22 14:54:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Only logical reasons to blame Democrats for the #TrumpShutdown:  1 - You hate Democrats and want any excuse to blame them for something.  2 - You don't pay attention to politics and someone told you it was their fault.  No other explanation is possible.

955145376813723648 2018-01-21 18:29:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges Also, I wrote a blog post about this.https://genderexpressive.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/being-a-trans-woman-at-the-2018-womens-march/amp/?__twitter_impression=true

955125966703087617 2018-01-21 17:12:30 UTC <FaithNaff> The #WomensMarch2018 is largely an accepting place for #transgender women. I share my thoughts and experience in this post. #trans #lgbt #girlslikeus #wegotthis https://genderexpressive.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/being-a-trans-woman-at-the-2018-womens-march/
955115929838473216 2018-01-21 16:32:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges I'm writing a blog post now so I'm going to include my thoughts about it there.
955115608672219136 2018-01-21 16:31:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges UG! I was positive I'd written a blog post a while back about the whole "pussy hat" thing and now I can't find it. I was going to link to it.
955111201486368770 2018-01-21 16:13:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Never forget that TERFs are a minority in feminism, and they're not powerful enough to kick you out of womanhood. #WeGotThis #GirlsLikeUs
955110605148643330 2018-01-21 16:11:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @lilah_sturges At the Charlotte March I had a sign calling for trans-inclusive femininism. I was met with nothing but smiles, thumbs up, and even one random hug. TERFs are a minority, and sometimes it's easy to lose sight of that.
955108017397170178 2018-01-21 16:01:11 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm a trans woman and I fight for...  your right to control your body. consent to be mandatory. equal pay for equal work. harrassment free workplaces.  I fight for you, so how exactly and I destroying femininism? I'm in this fight for you, too!

955106110809272320 2018-01-21 15:53:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @RileyJayDennis @EmTheLostBoy @Political_Imani @sistersnit Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?
955100262225645568 2018-01-21 15:30:22 UTC <FaithNaff> To save my sanity, I'm just going to start immediately blocking people who send me any kind of transphobic or transmisogynistic tweets. There's no sense in feeding the trolls when I learned as a child how to play with "blocks". 
955076732893179904 2018-01-21 13:56:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @melstonemusic I luckily saw none of that. My sign called for femininism inclusive of trans women and I got similes, pictures, and one random woman came up and hugged me.  Just remember that one asshole doesn't speak for a group.
955073984047042560 2018-01-21 13:45:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe It has already begun.

954926089993969664 2018-01-20 03:58:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @curmungeon I barely remember ever being him. It's like an old dream.

954895786478899200 2018-01-20 01:57:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @melstonemusic I had a day like that many years ago...  ...so I transitioned and stopped trying to live as a boy.
954893281778962434 2018-01-20 01:47:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @ColleenOHara6 @SarahKSilverman Not all women have periods. Not all women have vaginas.  Just making sure that doesn't get forgotten.
954890607842996224 2018-01-20 01:37:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @SmartAssJen I'm about as bleeding heart liberal as you can get, but I'm also a proud gun owner. Does that count?
954882362243997696 2018-01-20 01:04:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @amaditalks At the March I attended, a white woman had a sign that read: We are all "of color". God loves all.  It was highly unsettling.
954880392775000064 2018-01-20 00:56:41 UTC <FaithNaff> This tweet is talking about a dumbass who thinks "TERF" is hate speech and I'm loving it. https://twitter.com/TramadolAndGin/status/954709379336450048
954879877404119040 2018-01-20 00:54:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @JolyonMaugham @alexrubner @supermathskid TERFs live by a principle that my simply being myself is somehow an assault on their womanhood and that I should be forced into harm's way just to appease their misguided understandings about trans people.   Terribly sorry for not disagreeing with those notions politely.

You & your 4 followers have fun.

954858162640867328 2018-01-20 23:28:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain Ah. I have the former happen often, but rarely the latter. I usually laugh when I see they've followed me because I think, "okay; I hope you like tweets about feminism because your feeds about to be full of them".
954855435697381378 2018-01-20 23:17:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP So historic that you got the government shut down and there are millions of women marching in the streets calling for you to go. You failed on an inconceivable level.  #TrumpShutdown #WomensMarch2018

954409297093562369 2018-01-19 17:44:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @GMA @YoungEtika Gender is a social construct where we've arbitrarily decided how everyone should act and identify based on their sex. How is this so hard for you to grasp?
954377864484478976 2018-01-19 15:39:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @passingtrain I started off singing along to male sung songs but using my female voice. The key is holding notes and using a lot of air. Even just doing scales is helpful.

954127033759547392 2018-01-18 23:03:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @twosoftevenings I would absolutely do the same.
954116099741806592 2018-01-18 22:19:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Just blocked an ad for @RealTimers because Mauher is no ally of the trans community.

954051571612045312 2018-01-18 18:03:14 UTC <FaithNaff> This is why I literally hate Trump supporters. This is why I cannot see this as a simple difference of political opinion. You fuckers LITERALLY pushed a man into office trying to ensure I die in the streets outside of a hospital that won't see me. You're all monsters. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/954046503881990144
954050946329448449 2018-01-18 18:00:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @twosoftevenings LOL for running unopposed! I hate my chin, too. I think it's too wide.
954041694617571328 2018-01-18 17:23:59 UTC <FaithNaff> The Department of @HHSGov is currently fighting for the rights of doctors to let me die in the streets because they don't like trans people. How's your day going?
954031989094567936 2018-01-18 16:45:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @MagsVisaggs I hated mine with an undying passion. I only ever grew it out because it looked good on me, but good Christ did I want rid of it (glad it's finally gone).

953824889768693760 2018-01-17 03:02:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Just scrolled past @NPR reporting on Trumps asinine "Fake News Awards" and almost threw up. You're better than that, NPR. You're my last hope for journalistic integrity. Please don't give into sensationalism like everyone else.   I'm going to go cry now.
953823803695448064 2018-01-17 02:58:10 UTC <FaithNaff> For god sake, @NPR, you're better than this! This isn't news: it's just nonsense Trump did solely to get attention and you just gave it to him. Don't report on this garbage. You're like the LAST shred of journalistic integrity in America. Don't let me down!
953822423111041024 2018-01-17 02:52:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @JasonSchwartz @politico Stop reporting on this. This isn't news. This is just nonsense. Stop legitimizing this bullshit!

953769969149513728 2018-01-17 23:24:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @passingtrain Same here. I knew I was trans nearly 10 years before I started transition, and I knew I didn't make a good boy long before that.

953687782907670528 2018-01-17 17:57:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod Just shared this on my own feed, but I'm going to do a live video tonight discussing what I do with my voice. Shooting for 6pm EST. Anyone is welcome to watch and hopefully I can help someone battle their dysphoria.
953687473326051329 2018-01-17 17:56:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Feel free to watch and ask questions. I'll try to answer some during the video. Other's I'll get to when I can. I really hope I can help other trans women find the voice confidence that I have. I'm shooting for about 6pm EST. Hope to see you there. #transgender #trans #MTF
953687471778336768 2018-01-17 17:56:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Up front, I am NOT a vocal coach. Nothing I provide can even begin to be considered professional advice. Still, I never had a pro teach me and I like helping other trans women with anything I can offer them so they don't have to buy it elsewhere.
953687470222266368 2018-01-17 17:56:26 UTC <FaithNaff> ...I talk to someone face to face. I can even kind of sing okay sounding cis-female. I'm not certain how well I can explain what I do, but I'm going to try my best. I know voice can be a HUGE source of dysphoria for trans women and that HRT doesn't do much for us.
953687468582285312 2018-01-17 17:56:25 UTC <FaithNaff> So, tonight I'm going to do a live video where I talk about what I do with my voice to sound like a cis woman. I self-taught my technique and it's gotten me to the point where I get ma'amed on the phone before even giving my name and my voice doesn't out me when...
953683204711616512 2018-01-17 17:39:29 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod My voice is self taught. I get ma'amed on the phone before I even give my name and I even sound like a girl when I sing (though I'm not great at that). Hit me up if you want me to teach you the techniques I use.
953682389884112896 2018-01-17 17:36:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @professor_snap I was just really hoping for C's. #AGirlCanDream

953573286448975872 2018-01-17 10:22:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod That's the part that's always hardest to remember: this isn't exclusively our problem. It just hits us in a more impactful way.
953404892198195200 2018-01-16 23:13:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @ACLU @theOutpostUSA How dare they spread understanding and tollerance, right?
953404741446524930 2018-01-16 23:12:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @ACLU @CalypsoKane4 I am a transgender woman as well and I agree.
953402584848650245 2018-01-16 23:04:24 UTC <FaithNaff> This was just tweeted to me and then they blocked me.

953342740095520768 2018-01-16 19:06:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @thehill @HBergHattie Not on matters of discrimination. We can let states decide how much to tax and where to spend it, but there should be no wiggle room when it comes to treating people with dignity.
953342172358684672 2018-01-16 19:04:20 UTC <FaithNaff> Why is it that every anti-trans dumb-fuck says trans people should see a shrink when a lot of us do and the shrink advises we live as our identified gender? What exactly do they think the shink is going to do?
953341749409275905 2018-01-16 19:02:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @thehill @TimSheryl @Forte_x_Melody Agreed.  Sidebar: love your avatar image.
953341462321778689 2018-01-16 19:01:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @thehill @TimSheryl Mental health professionals advise to transition and live as identified gender, so I agree with your last statement at least.

952918736519999488 2018-01-15 15:01:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenatorBurr You honor him by propping up the most blatantly racist president in modern history.  You're a disgrace.

952548388729446400 2018-01-14 14:30:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Just had a conservative try to insult me by saying I look like I was still in high school. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say he doesn't talk to a lot of women.
952547342300917766 2018-01-14 14:25:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 @Misanthrope1013 "Banana peel".  Do I win? Was this a game where we try to say the most meaningless thing we can pertinent to the conversation?
952547000242843648 2018-01-14 14:24:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 @ZenMaster29 First, don't accuse me of being a high school student when you can't form a sentence properly or use the correct format of "you're". Second, unless you have anything to add to this conversation that isn't childish diversions then please wait your turn while grownups are talking.
952409963019800576 2018-01-13 05:20:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 Supporting  racial  profiling  is  being  racist 
952408454202904576 2018-01-13 05:14:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 And if you're fully aware he racially targeted ALL Hispanics because MOST were illegal, then you don't care about the SOME who weren't illegal but still had their rights viloated.   This makes you...wait for it...RACIST!
952407880552116224 2018-01-13 05:11:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 The LAW is that you can't racially profile people and prisoners must be kept in humane conditions. That's what the law says. You can't be for law keeping on one hand and for law breaking on the other.

952401047078817792 2018-01-13 04:44:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 You just said you didn't care that Joe violated the Constitutional rights of legal residents because they were minorities. You admitted to that. I could screen-cap it for you. It's not exactly a baseless claim.
952398637979627520 2018-01-13 04:35:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 So then a generic, racist, uninformed, nobody.  You'd be more useful as a bot.
952396558460387328 2018-01-13 04:26:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 So you don't care that the constitutional rights of innocent people were violated because those people don't look like you?  And you wonder why we call your ilk racists?
952396277937041408 2018-01-13 04:25:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 It's because you're all just cardboard cutouts. At first, I honestly thought you were a bot.
952395348739227648 2018-01-13 04:22:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @lsarsour @RobertRainey80 And you're ignoring the fact that he illegally used racial profiling, kept prisoners in abhorrently inhumane conditions, and defied court orders.

952362434966228992 2018-01-13 02:11:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @APSouthRegion This is a bad idea. I have nothing against Chelsea Manning. I actually like her a lot. But she's too divisive a candidate to have a shot of winning and she'd just syphon votes away from a liberal candidate with a better shot. I love ya, Chelse, but could you please not?
952361729983504384 2018-01-13 02:08:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @APSouthRegion @gnight You're right. "He" is for males. However, since Chelsea is a woman, that doesn't apply.

950842017097158657 2018-01-09 21:29:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @WhiteHouse And you forgot the words to the national anthem. But hey, you're a white guy so it's okay if you don't respect it, right?
950835152866947073 2018-01-09 21:02:20 UTC <FaithNaff> The prospect of Oprah running for president is being discussed in a White House press briefing during a time when Donald Trump is president and I don't know what's real anymore.

950801367748227072 2018-01-09 18:48:05 UTC <FaithNaff> In silver lining news: having the flu lost me enough weight to get my stomach measurement back to my pre-holiday number and then a bonus half an inch. Not the diet method I'd recommend though.
950799787300999169 2018-01-09 18:41:48 UTC <FaithNaff> I now have more followers than I do people I follow and that feels like an accomplishment somehow. 
950779355357171713 2018-01-09 17:20:37 UTC <FaithNaff> If Alabama should have been a lesson to the GOP on anything, it should be that highly problematic and polarizing people on the right can't win elections. Sheriff Joe running for Senate would be where they'd apply that lesson.

950745414466244608 2018-01-09 15:05:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @AP @Just_SomeChick I'm so mixed on this. On the one hand, it's recognition for and a celebration of transgender women. At the same time though, it's through a medium I've always found to be degrading and exploitative.
950744775543676929 2018-01-09 15:03:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @AP They should just do it and say nothing about it. The only reason all these guys are whining that it's "gay" or "not a real woman" is because they know about it up front. I guarantee there are trans women these dude-bros have thought were hot before without realizing.
950741342157787137 2018-01-09 14:49:34 UTC <FaithNaff> If you now want Oprah to be President just because she gave a great speech then you're just as wreckless with your voting rights as those who put Trump in office.
950736377167085568 2018-01-09 14:29:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Fever has broken, so that's a relief. Still feel miserable, but somewhat more functional. Yesterday I felt like I was knocking on death's door. Today I just feel like I'm playing in the neighborhood where death's house is.

950138959979601920 2018-01-07 22:55:55 UTC <FaithNaff> Further context: my dad is almost 80.
950138816484073474 2018-01-07 22:55:21 UTC <FaithNaff> Met dad for dinner. We're trying to get our relationship back since my transition. Waitress asked my dad if I was his wife or his baby.   It was even creepier and more counterproductive to the situation than you're currently thinking.
950119343249068032 2018-01-07 21:37:58 UTC <FaithNaff> As a reminder, black people get to have racial pride because white culture saw to the erasing of their family history before slavery. You can trace your lineage to whatever nation it originated in, black people cannot. You get Irish, German, etc. Pride. Be thankful for that.

By all means be pleased with the aspects of yourself you had no control over, but there's no reason to be proud of them unless you're made to feel ashamed of them.
950117151171588098 2018-01-07 21:29:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @jonesy89cfpd @uppittynegress Also, "black pride" gets a pass because slavery erased the lineage of most of the black people in America today. They don't know where they came from, so that shared experience becomes their unified heritage.

950001864338178049 2018-01-07 13:51:09 UTC <FaithNaff> After the movie was out a friend of mine asked, "so, who is going to train Rey now?" My response, "I hope nobody". I hope Rey goes on to figure out new ways of using the force. I hope she shapes this ancient power in a way that bennefits all instead of the few "gifted".

948973930420822016 2018-01-04 17:46:30 UTC <FaithNaff> If we had to have a game show host as president, why couldn't we get Steve Harvey? Speeches would be way more entertaining and he knows how to poll lots of people to come up with all the answers.

948699913197629440 2018-01-03 23:37:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave I could talk you through what I do if you ever want to try it.
948699404051116032 2018-01-03 23:35:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave I get ma'amed on the phone before I even give my name, so I'd call my effort a success. :)

948369458288037889 2018-01-02 01:44:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave Being respected in the workplace is one of those moments in transition you never thought would happen. So, when it does, it's the sweetest of victories.
948368808615514113 2018-01-02 01:41:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP Hey, hon...could you please get your boss to quit having a dick-measuring contest with Kim Jon Un so we don't all get wiped out in a nuclear Armageddon? Please?

948360997009547265 2018-01-02 01:10:56 UTC <FaithNaff> That happy, squee moment when you get retweeted by someone you greatly admire. :)
948359547487387648 2018-01-02 01:05:10 UTC <FaithNaff> Why do I keep getting followed by people who have either argued with me on threads or should be able to tell with little research that I'm in staunch opposition to everything they seem to stand for?
948358484852117505 2018-01-02 01:00:57 UTC <FaithNaff> So @the_moviebob said American Assassin was one of the worst films of the year. I really enjoyed that movie. So now I have to come on Twitter and whine about how...his opinion didn't take away my enjoyment and I still really like his work.   See fanboys, that's how that works.
948341509983756288 2018-01-02 23:53:29 UTC <FaithNaff> I was male and somewhat nerdy, but mostly just a completely disposable human being. Adrift because I didn't know what I wanted other than not to be who I was. Now I'm a very happy woman.

947647200028516352 2017-12-31 01:54:33 UTC <FaithNaff> It's now 2018 in Europe.  It's still 2017 here in the US.  So, now we're LITERALLY living in the past behind European countries instead of just metaphorically.

947569354111152128 2017-12-31 20:45:13 UTC <FaithNaff> Me at consultation to have laser hair removal on breasts:  Nurse: (very professional) "Okay, I'll need to see your breasts."  Me: *lifts shirt & bra*  Nurse: "......oh, these are nice."  #TrueStory

947520536988520454 2017-12-31 17:31:14 UTC <FaithNaff> Making a better life for yourself requires a lot more than just believing in yourself and making an effort to be better, but that's literally the only place it can start from.
947518516172902400 2017-12-31 17:23:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Spend today thinking about what you accomplished in 2017. Doesn't matter if it's a big or small thing: just things where you wanted to do/be/make something better and you did. If nothing comes to mind, you are what's wrong with your life. Change.
947517745737936897 2017-12-31 17:20:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead You can't even form a sentence! Like, your understanding of even rudimentary English rules is abhorrent! Are you actually a child? Like, do your parents know you're on Twitter? Are you Tweeting past your bedtime?
947514936120528901 2017-12-31 17:08:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR Cis white people be like: "Even though 90% of everything is made to fit my interests, anything that is about people not like me is 'shoving it in my face'!"

947510813170044929 2017-12-31 16:52:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @politico Imagine hating someone so much that it's the only way you know to respond to anything anymore. Even with one of their own in the White House now, bitching about Obama is all their world is. It's all they know.
947510425058496512 2017-12-31 16:51:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Of course we have to end the year with another shooting. Fuck Republicans.
947509970291118080 2017-12-31 16:49:15 UTC <FaithNaff> The fact that we made it through all of 2017 with Trump as president and complete Republican control in Congress, and managed to keep them from taking away Obamacare is probably our greatest accomplishment of the year as an America.
947508778886467584 2017-12-31 16:44:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling kinda hoping the worst games video lists BOTW as shittiest game for a moment just as a joke to enrage the fan boys. :)

947474515935858690 2017-12-31 14:28:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @HeudaEverthot I wouldn't classify transphobia as a mental illness per say. It's more of a biggotted stance fueled by a combination of apathy and misinformation.  Oh, you meant TRANS being a mental illness. Well.... It's not. Sorry.

947288147100041217 2017-12-30 02:07:48 UTC <FaithNaff> A big HELLO to the person who just followed me after insulting me and making fun of trans people. Um...I have no fucking idea why you're here or why you decided to follow someone you apparently don't like, but you do you I guess...
947286300041842688 2017-12-30 02:00:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob I will happily balance your feed with positivity. I've been a huge fan of yours for years. I find your content not only entertaining but educational. Never stop being you! <3
947285689141522434 2017-12-30 01:58:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @JenBowerUK It means you are who you say you are. Your identity is valid. It's real.
947285344533254144 2017-12-30 01:56:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead Okay, you're just a broken record now. Have fun in your barnyard. I'm sure Old McDonald is glad to have you around.
947283455712419841 2017-12-30 01:49:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead And you keep saying "sexual fetish". This has nothing to do with sex...unless you've got a fetish for trans women you're not talking about.
947283162736070657 2017-12-30 01:48:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead Next are you going to teach me about how the cow says "moo"? I feel like I'm literally debating a child. And what the hell does any of this have to do with cosplay? Do you even know what that is? Are you just using words you saw on the internet?
947282279021367297 2017-12-30 01:44:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Someone just tried to argue that transgender people are unnatural by saying "sex is what makes babies".   It's like debating a 9 year old.
947279760023085057 2017-12-30 01:34:29 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead SEX IS WHAT MAKES BABIES! GENDER IS MALE OR FEMALE IN ANIMALS!  Jesus Christ, you sound like a 9 year old!
947279463229902853 2017-12-30 01:33:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead Okay, ice cube. What are your pronouns?
947277927112114176 2017-12-30 01:27:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead Why are you so hung up on birth? Is that all women are to you? And besides, you're talking about sex, which is not the same as gender.
947276865970073601 2017-12-30 01:22:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead "Trans(gender) People" are people who's gender identity does not match the one they were assigned at birth.
947276654644166656 2017-12-30 01:22:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @MauryRiddick @twthead Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!  Seriously, have big-boy things to say or bow out. If I want to talk about animals I have a 7 year old for that.
947276132805685248 2017-12-30 01:20:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @shelly2161 @twthead Hey, everyone. Put away your medical and psychological research that concludes there's nothing wrong with being transgender because Mike is going to wow us with what he learned about lions and bears in 2nd grade.
947274568623972352 2017-12-30 01:13:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @shelly2161 @twthead So women are nothing more than baby factories to you? Aren't you a keeper.

947259427480096768 2017-12-30 00:13:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @twthead That is one of the most glorious take downs I've ever heard! SO stealing that!
947258880622555136 2017-12-30 00:11:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR Hey everyone, meet @twthead. He has a 5th grade understanding of biology and thinks that makes him smarter than the overwhelming scientific consensus that being transgender is not abnormal. He is a textbook example of what happens when you mix ignorance with smugness.
947253684760662017 2017-12-30 23:50:52 UTC <FaithNaff> TO BE FAIR, this is a man who thinks each person in his crowds somehow represent 100+ people, so...https://twitter.com/TheDweck/status/946554277807390721
947253393042608128 2017-12-30 23:49:42 UTC <FaithNaff> He shouldn't be president for literally all the same reasons a 13 year old boy shouldn't be president.https://twitter.com/BarbraStreisand/status/946906596176809984
947244977599471617 2017-12-30 23:16:16 UTC <FaithNaff> So, go be a better you in 2018. And if you don't want to, don't ask me to do it for you.
947244976332787712 2017-12-30 23:16:15 UTC <FaithNaff> ...and then tomorrow you focus on the next day. If you fall short, start over. If you have to go back to square one half way though, that's fine. Despite what people might tell you, there IS value in just making the effort.
947244975317766144 2017-12-30 23:16:15 UTC <FaithNaff> So, if you're not making a new year's resolution, why not? I know you've got something you want, something you wish you could do. Fucking do it! If your first thought is how you won't make it, push that out of your head. Don't think about down the road. Focus on tomorrow...
947244974311079937 2017-12-30 23:16:15 UTC <FaithNaff> creep into my life and take over. Over the last few days I've had the epiphany that most of the shit I stress about is other people's problems! I lay awake at night wondering how OTHER people are going to make it. And I'm done with that. No more.
947244972813832192 2017-12-30 23:16:15 UTC <FaithNaff> ...but helping is not doing the caring for you. From now on, my cheer leading has a short shelf life. If I'm helping you to be better and feel your effort slack, I'm done. This all sounds harsh, but I've come to realize I've let WAY too much of this bullshit slowly...
947244971794534400 2017-12-30 23:16:14 UTC <FaithNaff> I've come to realize this year that there are WAY too many people in my life that have just given up. I normally figure this out when I realize I'm starting to shoulder the mental and sometimes physical burden of keeping them going. I love to help...
947244970490163200 2017-12-30 23:16:14 UTC <FaithNaff> ...on them right off the bat. Encourage them to succeed! Even if they do fall short, at least they're TRYING! At least they have some inkling of desire to be better that extends beyond wishful thinking. That's admirable.
947244969412186112 2017-12-30 23:16:14 UTC <FaithNaff> That's your business. But don't think that gives you any kind of high ground. And if you respond to someone's resolution with some kind of bet that they won't see it through...again...fuck the fucking fuck off, you fucking fuck. They sure don't need you coming down...
947244968342671360 2017-12-30 23:16:14 UTC <FaithNaff> Don't don't be a downer on people trying to move forward and better themselves just because you've given up and decided to find contentment in stagnation. I have zero time for that shit. If you want to coast through life, not doing a damn thing different day to day...
947244967071797249 2017-12-30 23:16:13 UTC <FaithNaff> And while we're on the subject of resolutions: if you're one of those people who likes to roll their eyes at people who make them, or who gets some kind of smug superiority about the fact that you're not making any...fuck off. Seriously, fuck right the hell off.
947244965461155841 2017-12-30 23:16:13 UTC <FaithNaff> My new year's resolution is to keep the house clean. It's something I've been bad at my whole life and 2018 is the year I finally change that. Already off to a great start. Last few weeks we've cleaned the whole house and I've done at least one thing each day to maintain it.

946999546604851200 2017-12-29 07:01:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump is the id of the old South Park Republicans made manifest: brash, crass, and standing for nothing other than being right and thinking you're always the smartest person in the room.
946913390945099783 2017-12-29 01:18:39 UTC <FaithNaff> That's what's so crazy: his presidency has created a world where the smart people have no choice but to discuss an absolute bafoon as though he were one of them. His job requires ability and mental capacity that he simply doesn't possess.
946913169179643905 2017-12-29 01:17:46 UTC <FaithNaff> It's like everyone KNOWS there's no intelligent thought to anything he does, but we've no precedent for discussing world politics any other way. "What can we discern from this tweet?" They ask, as though the answer wasn't that he saw something that upset him and he had a tantrum.
946911792575471618 2017-12-29 01:12:18 UTC <FaithNaff> The most amazing part of Trump's presidency has been watching truly brilliant people on the news try to hold high level discussions about his actions when they all know he's a psychopath with the mental fortitude of a 12 year old.

I'm about to finish my second and those little joys from hearing" "she" "her" and your real name never really fade away. My favorite part is finally smiling when I look in the mirror. 
946716163010105344 2017-12-29 12:14:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @PubicZirconium This looks like the scenario ("plot" is too kind) of the kind of porno that's bad by porn standards.

946148046718537729 2017-12-27 22:37:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave @skankhunter__42 @platypusrex256 This gets into muddy semantics. I don't identify as Transgender. I identify as female, which does not correspond with my assigned gender, and thus I am trans.

945969115784732672 2017-12-27 10:46:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @politico Good. I'd rather he throw his Twitter pissy fits over a nation with level-headed leaders instead of North Korea.
945968193641893888 2017-12-27 10:42:47 UTC <FaithNaff> We've never told our son no when it comes to self expression. He's gone to school with his nails painted because he asked to.

945964612373147648 2017-12-27 10:28:33 UTC <FaithNaff> The news media does in-depth stories on Trump supporters for the same reason NatGeo shows us videos of animals shitting on the ground and fucking each other out in the open, they're so far removed from civilization that we find them fascinating.
945762882029064192 2017-12-26 21:06:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave @skankhunter__42 You must be a cisgender man. Am I right?

944936737134010368 2017-12-24 14:24:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Just, everyone please know that this is the kind of shit you put trans people through when you don't respect pronouns and names. It's not a small thing. It's not benign details. It seriously crushes a person's world.
944936735443771393 2017-12-24 14:24:08 UTC <FaithNaff> I have hundreds of people in my life that know me for me, but they're not there with me in these moments. They can't be there to help keep me grounded in reality.
944936733770240002 2017-12-24 14:24:08 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm tweeting all of this because I know it's coming and I'm trying to strengthen my resolve. Deadnames and misgenders hurt. They rob you of confidence, distort how you see your reflection. They make you question everything you say and do, wondering if it's too masculine.
944936732071522304 2017-12-24 14:24:07 UTC <FaithNaff> How do you reconcile looking at me and then using a male pronoun? I know I sound like I'm bragging, but screw it. I've worked hard in my transition. I put a lot of effort into this body. When a family member calls me "he" all I can wonder is, how do you still see that?
944936730284777473 2017-12-24 14:24:07 UTC <FaithNaff> That's what makes it so jarring. I pass for cis female everywhere I go. I haven't been called sir by a stranger in almost a year! I know memories play a big role, but Jesus Christ...LOOK AT ME! I've done modeling for God sake (charity event)! Straight men hit on me. I'm no man!
944936728544120832 2017-12-24 14:24:06 UTC <FaithNaff> I need to add, for the record, that I go to these things in no way LOOKING like a man. I wear my normal clothes and put on some subtle makeup. I look 100% female, or at least I feel like I do.
944933272085303296 2017-12-24 14:10:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Seeing family today. It's the only environment left in my life where people see me as a man. With each visit I try to ready myself for it, but the experience is always a shock to the system. Nowhere else do I hear my old name or male pronouns.
944929928717459457 2017-12-24 13:57:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I go see my parents today. It will be another holiday of begrudging toleration of my presence sprinkled with a few dead names and wrong pronouns.   Merry Christmas.

942402759692779520 2017-12-17 14:35:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob CNN knows we're a nation of people who slow down to look at car crashes. If it's a complete mess, we wanna see it.
942402232447848449 2017-12-17 14:32:55 UTC <FaithNaff> @GuildingLilly Oh yeah, conference calls are an all the time deal.
942230396195962887 2017-12-16 03:10:06 UTC <FaithNaff> Dysphoria episodes are like getting sick. You know that, as soon as you feel it, it's not going away for a while and will probably get worse.
942200901816766465 2017-12-16 01:12:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @MokiAwa I have long lashes too. Hate it when cis women say "it's not fair you have those lashes". We'll, it's not fair you got a vagina and never had your life threatened for going to the bathroom. How 'bout some damn perspective.

942158849380966401 2017-12-16 22:25:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Are you really surprised Trump picked a judge that knows nothing about the law? You dumbasses picked a TV game show host who knows nothing about being president.
942147090431533059 2017-12-16 21:39:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @CDCgov just ignore @realDonaldTrump 's word ban. It's not like he's smart enough to read what you write anyway, so it doesn't matter.

941857072848822272 2017-12-15 02:26:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey "white genocide" dipshits: when the CDC is ordered to use language that assumes you don't exist, THEN you can talk to me about being marginalized. Until then, shut your privileged, dumb-fuck mouths.
941855738066063360 2017-12-15 02:21:21 UTC <FaithNaff> I can't begin to express how fucking angry I am right now. @realDonaldTrump You are an unforgivable piece of shit, and I genuinely hope for nothing but misery for you the rest of your life.  CDC gets list of forbidden words: fetus, transgender, diversityhttp://wapo.st/2j7DbdS?tid=ss_tw-amp
941820339276759040 2017-12-15 00:00:41 UTC <FaithNaff> I hate being privileged enough to have it easier than someone but not enough to make their burden go away.
941771823913623552 2017-12-15 20:47:54 UTC <FaithNaff> How do you nicely tell someone to read the goddamn news once in a while and stop asking you to explain to them everything going on in the world?
941738483525341184 2017-12-15 18:35:25 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm 9 followers away from 200! Quick, someone go find 9 people who want to give me attention. 
941667984447328256 2017-12-15 13:55:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Aversion to ads is what's killing real journalism. People expect to get their news online for free now instead of buying a paper. And that's awesome, but you had to buy that paper for a reason. Real journalism costs money.
941667659606872067 2017-12-15 13:54:00 UTC <FaithNaff> I will never understand people's utter hatred of ads online. TV has always been a paid service with LOTS of ads and there's never been mass backlash. But heaven forbid you have to watch ONE COMMERCIAL before a video on a FREE service like YouTube.
941667003995250688 2017-12-15 13:51:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @CNN I will never understand why people having to see advertisements on something they're otherwise getting to access for absolutely nothing is somehow sacrilege. Aversion to ads is what's killing news media. Fucking get over it and watch the commercials.

941519740232716288 2017-12-14 04:06:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @GuildingLilly There are so many accounts I've been lazy about changing it on.

941254291658084353 2017-12-14 10:31:25 UTC <FaithNaff> This is how misinformation runs rampant on the right. Just watch, some conservative outlet like Fox News or Brietbart will talk about this. It won't matter if they say it's just a rumor, because their base will talk about it online as a fact.  Just watch.https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/941045103673606144
941117564591230977 2017-12-13 01:28:07 UTC <FaithNaff> @iamstephbeatz thank you so much for the last episode of #BrooklynNineNine. I broke down and cried. As a transgender woman, I've heard the statement, "mom's going to need a little more time" word for word. Thank you for shining a light on this struggle. <3
941052969843339270 2017-12-13 21:11:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @WhiteHouse Then you'll need a completely different tax bill, because the one you're considering will screw us all.
940998439084621825 2017-12-13 17:34:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Fellow white people: we should be embarrassed and humbled by this figure.https://twitter.com/SikhProf/status/940787833752772609
940996668442529793 2017-12-13 17:27:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Black people in Alabama didn't just show up to vote. They pushed through intimidation practices, fake computer malfunctions, last minute venue changes, purposely faulty equipment, etc. Real effort was made to silence them and still they pushed on. Learn what you take for granted.
940995106496237568 2017-12-13 17:21:30 UTC <FaithNaff> In 2018, demand to know what every candidate you support intends to do to stop voter suppression and loosen voting restrictions. Don't ask their stance. Ask what actions they will take.
940958319585439747 2017-12-13 14:55:20 UTC <FaithNaff> "Vote like an Alabama black woman" is officially my 2018 battle cry.
940937106116968448 2017-12-13 13:31:02 UTC <FaithNaff> By the way, HUGE props to the African American communities of Alabama who pushed through rampant voter suppression to show up and vote. You are all goddamn heroes and any amount of praise you get for this is not enough.
940936448987074560 2017-12-13 13:28:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Glorious to wake up to the news that sanity prevailed in Alabama, even if just barely.
940673170591363072 2017-12-12 20:02:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @MDS2965 Also, reinstate is not the same as remove the ban on, but that by no means makes either a redeemable stance.
940672899131813888 2017-12-12 20:01:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @MDS2965 He said amendments after 10 were holding us back.  Amendment to abolish slavery is after 10  He didn't exclude it.  This is not a big leap.
940631535971168256 2017-12-12 17:16:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @OrdQuelu @ItanyaBlade I would need to take a shower after typing that out.
940631399098408962 2017-12-12 17:16:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @MDS2965 He said America was great before it was abolished and that the amendment to abolish it is on the list of ones that are ruining the country. If he's anti slavery, he does a piss poor job of showing it.
940591129401192448 2017-12-12 14:36:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Hard to think about, but right now, thousands of Americans are casting votes for a child molester who wants to bring back slavery. These are known things about him, and they're voting for him anyway.

940532974105317376 2017-12-12 10:45:09 UTC <FaithNaff> Conservatives make a point of being unwelcoming and downright hostile towards anyone who isn't exactly like them and then wonder why we consider their states fly-over country?  Don't you wanna visit?  No, bitch! I wanna LIVE!
940522726694977536 2017-12-12 10:04:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob I was so happy when IBWT started because The Big Picture was my favorite show on the web.

940381098160410624 2017-12-11 00:41:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey Alabama, here's reminder number 384,572,482 that ROY MOORE IS A GODDAMN CHILD MOLESTER AND YOU SHOULDN'T VOTE FOR HIM!  You know...in case you forgot.

940269496077619200 2017-12-11 17:18:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I trained my voice for months because it was one of my biggest dysphoria triggers. I get ma'amed by strangers on the phone now, so I guess it worked. I find that trans women who don't alter their voice just end up sounding like cis women with low voices. They do exist, ya know.
940202708904103937 2017-12-11 12:52:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Dear Alabama,  If you elect a slavery-supporting child molester to the Senate, I promise that you'll never be known for anything else ever again.

939859211386843137 2017-12-10 14:07:52 UTC <FaithNaff> (1)...I'm a different person on estrogen, and I love that person. Getting testosterone out of my body and replacing it with estrogen has been like finding a lost piece of me I didn't even realize was lost...(2)
939858944461361153 2017-12-10 14:06:48 UTC <FaithNaff> I've been on HRT for 22 months now. I have to say, it's changed me in ways I didn't expect but absolutely love.

939673620338692097 2017-12-09 01:50:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @base2wave I once had a family member's friend spew that shit to me on a comment thread on the family member's post.

938983046442881024 2017-12-07 04:06:18 UTC <FaithNaff> For next year, someone should put out a day calendar where each day is a tweet @realDonaldTrump made on the same day in a previous year. The owner can read it and contemplate how it probably contradicts what he has said or done in the present day.

Then he said, "mommy and mom". In my mind, I breathed the biggest sigh of relief. It would have been REALLY awkward if he'd called me dad in the middle of class
938980187664015361 2017-12-07 03:54:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @GuildingLilly ...(1) Fast forward a couple of weeks and it's his birthday. My wife and I decided to surprise him by showing up at his class with cupcakes and stuff. We walk in and he lights up like a Christmas tree. He's jumping up and down and smiling ear to ear...(2)
938979808305926144 2017-12-07 03:53:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @GuildingLilly Oh! Funny story!  So, a little over a year ago we sat our son down and had the talk that daddy wanted to be called Mom from now on. He was fine with it because he's a cool kid. He slipped up a few times in the first few weeks, but was always fine with correcting (1)...

938590862900125697 2017-12-06 02:07:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Trump's actions today do not say, "we wish to broker peace." They say, "we wish to help you agree with the decision we've already made where one side gets everything they want and the other gets fucked."

937355391528300546 2017-12-03 16:18:35 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey Republicans, when you go to vote next year, make sure you write your candidates name in the margins instead of filling in the little bubble. That apparently makes things official for the GOP now so it will totally count.

936949213623148544 2017-12-02 13:24:34 UTC <FaithNaff> DEAR FELLOW NORTH CAROLINIANS: @SenatorBurr and @ThomTillis just voted to raise your taxes to pad the pockets of the wealthy and cripple our economy. You know what to do in November.

936797174704173058 2017-12-01 03:20:25 UTC <FaithNaff> The GOP doesn't care if the American people like this bill. They're passing it because it makes corporations happy because corporations fund their campaigns and NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY CITIZENS UNITED IS TERRIBLE?!
936796643290095617 2017-12-01 03:18:19 UTC <FaithNaff> If I grab a Sharpie and write "don't pass legislation that fucks over the middle class" on a napkin, do you think I could get the Senate to vote on it? That seems to be how we do this shit now.
936796265274155008 2017-12-01 03:16:49 UTC <FaithNaff> If anyone EVER calls the GOP the party of fiscal responsibility again, remind them that they passed a 500 page sweeping tax overhaul with SCRIBBLED-IN ADDITIONS IN THE FUCKING MARGINS within a couple hours of passing it out.

936773321529614337 2017-12-01 01:45:38 UTC <FaithNaff> Never try to convince a transphobe that you're not a "real" man/woman. It'll never work. Just tell them their opinion doesn't stop you from being one and they're powerless to stop you so they can just die mad about it.
936569790688350219 2017-12-01 12:16:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @woodyandwilcox the Woody and Wilcox show sticks to one thing, not being funny.

934170995342049281 2017-11-24 21:24:56 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm ashamed to live in the time of Trump but proud to live in the time of male accountability.

933879324574445568 2017-11-23 02:05:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Deadnames and wrong pronouns hurt. They ramp up dysphoria, altering how you see your reflection. They destroy confidence and kill self esteem. They rob you of your identity. They shatter your perception of reality.  Don't deadname or misgender #transgender people. It's abuse.

933680570588114944 2017-11-23 12:56:09 UTC <FaithNaff> So @comcast, if you "support a free and open internet", as you keep repeating, why would you NOT support #NetNeutrality ? There has to be a reason you want the FCC to change the rules.

933111001137868800 2017-11-21 23:12:53 UTC <FaithNaff> With this, our president only pardons racists 50% of the time.https://twitter.com/VP/status/933109192344461312
932940983054020609 2017-11-21 11:57:18 UTC <FaithNaff> Now, I sincerely HOPE I don't have to endure that. But the probability is high and I'm trying to mentally prepare for it. If nothing else, I get to finally look back and see I was actually me at Thanksgiving dinner. 7/X
932940583835971584 2017-11-21 11:55:43 UTC <FaithNaff> So, they can misgender me all they want this Thanksgiving. I'm going to try my best not to care. It won't change the fact that they're seeing their child as the beautiful woman she always was, raising a glass to toast their good health. Their words won't change the truth. 6/X
932940046818336769 2017-11-21 11:53:35 UTC <FaithNaff> Dead names and wrong pronouns can really fuck with dysphoria. When someone calls me "he" or by my old name, it makes me literally think my appearance has changed. It's like those words magically make my tits shrink and my facial hair come back. 5/X
932939816236445697 2017-11-21 11:52:40 UTC <FaithNaff> My family is going to see me come in as a woman. They're going to see me sit down to dinner as a woman. They're going to see me mingle in the living room afterwards as a woman. No amount of dead names and wrong pronouns can take that away. 4/X
932939541341790208 2017-11-21 11:51:34 UTC <FaithNaff> Still, no matter what happens, I get to go to Thanksgiving with my family and be myself. Years ago, I would have told you with absolute certainty that such a thing would never happen. This is the mother of all bucket list things to get to cross off. 3/X
932939218187358210 2017-11-21 11:50:17 UTC <FaithNaff> I don't know how it will go. I don't know who all will dead name and/or misgender me and I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for that. Those things happen so rarely in my life now that hearing them is jarring. 2/X
932938946912366592 2017-11-21 11:49:12 UTC <FaithNaff> This Thanksgiving, I get to present authentically to my family for the first time ever (as far as holiday gatherings are concerned). This is something I've dreamed about for countless years. 1/X
932673046774771712 2017-11-20 18:12:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @MistyMassey That actually happened to my ex's mom. Bullet came through the bedroom wall; missed her by about a foot.
932661778059808774 2017-11-20 17:27:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Everyone, I give you...cis/white feminism.https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/woman-makes-bread-with-vaginal-yeast
932573513801785344 2017-11-20 11:37:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost I will very often spend the second half of my hour lunch break napping in my car. It's a wonderful way to recharge for the rest of the work day.
932573150994452482 2017-11-20 11:35:40 UTC <FaithNaff> And no, I'm not looking to make it a contest. I'm saying you don't want to either. I don't want anyone... ANYONE to have to feel like suffering is the gateway to validation of one's identity. You are who you say you are, no matter what you've endured.
932572558486048768 2017-11-20 11:33:18 UTC <FaithNaff> However, if they want to play the hardship card, trans woman will win every damn time. It's hard being a cis woman. It is MUCH HARDER to be a trans woman. We get the same sexism, but with transphobic layered on top.
932571596459520000 2017-11-20 11:29:29 UTC <FaithNaff> In truth, I pitty TERFs. They feel the gateways to true womanhood are bleeding and being subjugated by men all their lives. You are not defined by your hardships. The ways you have suffered to not validate your identity.
932570736685875201 2017-11-20 11:26:04 UTC <FaithNaff> TERFs are a special breed of transphobe. Plenty of people hate the trans community, but TERFs feel their identity is somehow threatened by ours. My being a woman doesn't make you less of one. I recognize the femminine in you, as you should in me.
932569981224738816 2017-11-20 11:23:04 UTC <FaithNaff> No one fights harder against trans women's rights than queer cis women. The most horrific things ever said about me were spewed from the mouths of TERFs, supposedly fighting for equality for women.
932569138572251136 2017-11-20 11:19:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Don't forget, trans people face a lot of alienation even in the queer community. If you don't believe me, go post a trans-positive meme in a queer space online and watch the hate wash over you.
932568555429793792 2017-11-20 11:17:24 UTC <FaithNaff> I have to work all day, so I regrettably won't be able to Tweet much about #TDOR. Whatever you're doing today, please keep those poor souls in your thoughts. They died just for demanding to live instead of simply existing. Honor their memory by fighting for the community.
932567773129166848 2017-11-20 11:14:18 UTC <FaithNaff> The fact that Jeffery Tambor is no longer going to be impersonating a trans woman is music to my ears.

932061966499237889 2017-11-18 01:44:24 UTC <FaithNaff> A man truly remorseful for harassing a woman will try to make right by her before anyone else knows about it. Don't say sorry to cameras after you're caught. Try to make right with your victim without the public spectacle.
932061246542811136 2017-11-18 01:41:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Regarding @SenFranken, the notion that someone is good if they apologize and has done other good works goes out the window when you realize he didn't own up until he was caught. Saying sorry after caught plays to your image, not your conscious.
932060148746670080 2017-11-18 01:37:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @transscribe Understandable. My child also throws tantrums when he doesn't get his way.

929905591014830080 2017-11-12 02:55:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @rCharlotteSmith Okay. I've always thought the phrase "good girl" has traditionally misogynistic undertones, so the notion of trans women seeking that kind of attention seemed alarming. That's why I asked for context.

929741288500551680 2017-11-12 16:02:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @queerheartbreak @GuildingLilly When I finally got to use the ladies room there were hardly any issues. One customer did call the corporate office to complain, but they just ignored it. After almost 2 years of HRT and laser hair removal, I pass well enough to never have any issues.
929740873998487552 2017-11-12 16:01:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @queerheartbreak @GuildingLilly When I'd finally catch a break I'd dash into the stall and do my thing. But I wouldn't come back out until everyone who'd come in in that time was gone. I wasted so much company time just sitting on the toilet doing nothing.
929740631378972672 2017-11-12 16:00:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @queerheartbreak @GuildingLilly When I first came out at work, my company made me continue to use the men's room for a month while they worked out the legal understanding of letting me use the women's room. I used to hold it for hours waiting for a moment when the men's room was empty. It was hell.
929738248104136704 2017-11-12 15:50:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @queerheartbreak @GuildingLilly I actually used to do that. I did a lot of not washing my hands back then because I was paranoid about lingering in there and getting clocked.  But somehow I'm the predator.

929346719137058816 2017-11-11 13:54:58 UTC <FaithNaff> I think when we lost Carrie Fisher she became a goddess and is now exacting her feminist wrath upon Hollywood against the forces of male oppression.  I refuse to accept any other explanation.

929150702823378944 2017-11-10 00:56:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @TwitterSupport I'd rather you ban @realDonaldTrump for using your platform to lead us into nuclear war. That has to be against your terms of service.
929149114444648448 2017-11-10 00:49:46 UTC <FaithNaff> So glad Twitter chose now to up the character limit on Tweets because dear fucking God do we have some shit to say right now.

928785004548763648 2017-11-09 00:42:55 UTC <FaithNaff> It fills me with glee to see the careers of serial rapists and harrassers in positions of power lose everything almost instantly. At long last, it seems no predator is too big to take down.
928783967083429888 2017-11-09 00:38:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I still get seriously struck down when I get misgendering, but it's an extremely rare occasion these days.
928778782252650498 2017-11-09 00:18:12 UTC <FaithNaff> When a big Hollywood movie spends millions to recast its lead over sexual assault allegations AFTER THE MOVIE HAS BEEN MADE, you know something in America has dynamically shifted for the better. #EndSexualAssault #EnoughIsEnough

928367035691798531 2017-11-08 21:02:04 UTC <FaithNaff> To all the people saying that we shouldn't care about the gender of someone who gets elected when we talk about the #transgender victories last night... Can we please just have this? Cis people have had representation all their lives. Let us enjoy our moment, for fuck's sake.

926906028339363840 2017-11-04 20:16:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Wasn't ANTIFA supposed to be mass murdering Trump supporters today? Isn't that the meme the right kept sharing without a shred of evidence?
926812292032839680 2017-11-04 14:04:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod Just like how femininity isn't defined by menstral pain or sexual harrassment. Misery isn't what makes you you.

925144129021104128 2017-10-30 23:35:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @WhiteHouse @POTUS The only thing haunting you is Robert Mueller.
925143952306720769 2017-10-30 23:34:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Can the tomes of history remember the Mueller investigation as "OPERATION: BUT HER EMAILS!"?
924742149199065088 2017-10-29 20:58:03 UTC <FaithNaff> So, do other people find this too hot to handle, @tacobell ? I mean, they have a kick, I guess. pic.twitter.com/nO6nUKA2cd
924678206984159232 2017-10-29 16:43:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod Are you like me and get stared at some times but try to discern if they can tell you're trans or are eying you up?

920107944980729856 2017-10-16 02:03:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley Don't think your gender validation is tied to how well you do or do not pass. You're a woman no matter what. They can't take that away.
920107221840691202 2017-10-16 02:00:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley Purposefully misgendering a trans woman is still misogyny.

919621019379339265 2017-10-15 17:48:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Not good to see #AaronRodgers injured.

918907671784378368 2017-10-13 18:33:56 UTC <FaithNaff> "Gay stuff" isn't automatically something that will speak to trans experiences. If there aren't trans characters, it's not about them.
918907371619053571 2017-10-13 18:32:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Really sick of seeing things saying they're for/about LGBT and only center around sexuality. TRANSGENDER IS NOT A SEXUALITY!
918905677766152199 2017-10-13 18:26:00 UTC <FaithNaff> Every day I find more evidence that transgender people are just window dressing as far as the larger pride movement is concerned.

917902776348413952 2017-10-10 00:00:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @noahbwilliams19 Got that, for sure. We have no leadership, just overpaid morons acting only for themselves.
917902298013163520 2017-10-10 23:58:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Sometimes there's just no appropriate outlet for what you want to say.
917900732053053440 2017-10-10 23:52:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @noahbwilliams19 What is the compromise you're speaking of? The Declaration of Independence? The Constitution?
917900042417123329 2017-10-10 23:49:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @noahbwilliams19 I'm sorry, but I'm not following your logic. War is the opposite of compromise. Help me understand your point.
917899797847265281 2017-10-10 23:49:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod My instant reaction to any compliment is "they just feel bad for me and want to make me feel better. They don't really mean it".
917898275822473216 2017-10-10 23:42:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @noahbwilliams19 Our founding fathers went to war over a tax on tea.
917823541185261573 2017-10-10 18:45:59 UTC <FaithNaff> We must stop demanding leadership from @realDonaldTrump and figure out how we're going to operate leaderless for the next 3+ years.
917547790410047490 2017-10-09 00:30:15 UTC <FaithNaff> My brain is once again insisting that I need FFS because I look too masculine.
917526611192315906 2017-10-09 23:06:05 UTC <FaithNaff> The dysphoria is strong in me today. :(
917499749342892033 2017-10-09 21:19:21 UTC <FaithNaff> Make no mistake, @VP's message in leaving the Colt's game was that he thinks only white people are entitled to the right to protest.
917047696720056320 2017-10-08 15:23:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod Honey, I'm right there with you. My folks have reached the point of "happy to love you over phone or text".
917047136214233088 2017-10-08 15:20:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @DianaSh64001589 Wish you luck. That shit hurts like hell but is 1000000% worth it.
917046862712012800 2017-10-08 15:19:44 UTC <FaithNaff> In the looks department, I feel like I've reached the point of "pretty hot for a transgender girl," and that's as far as I can hope for.
915541806410018816 2017-10-04 11:39:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @woodyandwilcox I wonder how Zerorez and Mattress Firm feel about their ad money paying for minutes long fart noises.
913111470501765122 2017-09-27 18:41:54 UTC <FaithNaff> If you're burning tickets and jerseys you paid for because of #TakeAKnee then don't ever call me a special snowflake again.   Good Christ!
912833586675449857 2017-09-26 00:17:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Your anthem protest anger is either from racism or misinformation. No other explanation is possible.
912104151185858561 2017-09-24 23:59:10 UTC <FaithNaff> People who say "support our troops" don't give 2 shits about our troops. They're a shield to hide behind and spew racist rhetoric unchecked.
912103920541081600 2017-09-24 23:58:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Using soldiers as a pawn in your crusade to stop peaceful protests against institutionalized racism is ACTUALLY disrespecting the military.
912018140418183174 2017-09-24 18:17:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @VZWSupport Resetting the WiFi fixed the problem. Thanks for the help! #GreatCustomerService
912007811391016960 2017-09-24 17:36:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @VZWSupport I cycled wifi on/off and that seems to have fixed it. Thanks for the help! #GreatCustomerService
912007406263169024 2017-09-24 17:34:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @VZWSupport Yes. Never been a problem before
912003853490540544 2017-09-24 17:20:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @VerizonSupport it's been doing this for about 20 minutes. I'd kind of like to access the stuff I pay for. Thank you.pic.twitter.com/4MSMkp0Dm9
911971340441223168 2017-09-24 15:11:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Who do you be vulnerable to when you're supposed to be the strong one?
911966307041599488 2017-09-24 14:51:25 UTC <FaithNaff> I hate my body.Just...absolutely fucking hate my body.Full stop.
910171546739777537 2017-09-19 15:59:41 UTC <FaithNaff> If you've ever claimed to be pansexual because you "like women and trans women" then we need to have a talk in my office.
905932574022885376 2017-09-07 23:15:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Why do you all trust these scientists telling you where the hurricane is going to hit but not that man-made climate change is causing them?!
902893821062721537 2017-08-30 14:00:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Good morning.pic.twitter.com/bkggTw6oh9

901513094542893057 2017-08-26 18:34:05 UTC <FaithNaff> Happy Cis-gay Pride, #CharlottePride . https://m.facebook.com/events/1327736187346994?view=permalink&id=1386953674758578
901223601579466753 2017-08-25 23:23:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley "not a complete person" is manageable by pushing through transition. It's the feeling of "never can be" that's hard to conqure.
901138929008693250 2017-08-25 17:47:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @laraxamerico They wouldn't want it.
901104603172929537 2017-08-25 15:30:53 UTC <FaithNaff> My only actual suicide attempt was brought on by this feeling, so it's always the hardest to battle.
901104095435657216 2017-08-25 15:28:52 UTC <FaithNaff> It's this feeling of "you will never have what cis women have" that always hits me hardest and stays with me the longest when I'm depressed.
901103702026670083 2017-08-25 15:27:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I've put a lot of work into my voice and now get ma'amed on the phone by strangers so I think I'm doing okay.
900829804731256832 2017-08-24 21:18:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod What a beautiful thought.
900809997390577664 2017-08-24 20:00:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I swear they always seem bigger in the morning.
900782253864882176 2017-08-24 18:09:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod That's me in the shower.
900366855235190785 2017-08-23 14:39:20 UTC <FaithNaff> Sometimes I really, really, really, really, really hate people.
900358668033634304 2017-08-23 14:06:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @espn firing Lee is them making every right-wing asshole accusing the left of taking "political correctness to the extreme" right for once.
900357601933762562 2017-08-23 14:02:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @espn for God's sake, give Lee his job back. What the hell is wrong with you?!
900010630375243780 2017-08-22 15:03:50 UTC <FaithNaff> NEW BLOG POST: Get a glimpse into the mind of someone with gender dysphoria. #transgender #trans #LGBT #genderhttps://genderexpressive.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/transgender-the-eternal-cycle-of-pretending/
899811656833933312 2017-08-21 01:53:11 UTC <FaithNaff> Today @realDonaldTrump went beyond "shouldn't be President" and head-first into "shouldn't be without adult supervision".https://twitter.com/jules_su/status/899707355180527616
899012326988423173 2017-08-19 20:56:56 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm sure opthamologists are dreading Tuesday morning. #Eclipse2017
898594719780843521 2017-08-18 17:17:30 UTC <FaithNaff> So are we watching a reality show where the last one left after Trump gets impeached gets to be president?
898569181679030272 2017-08-18 15:36:02 UTC <FaithNaff> When this is all over, I hope to look back and say we were the generation that saw Nazism pop up and made it sit the fuck back down.
898357988553097216 2017-08-17 01:36:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz We love you, Laura! You're a huge inspiration to me! <3 <3 <3
898151495409033216 2017-08-17 11:56:18 UTC <FaithNaff> When it comes to the confederate flag, there's a big difference between what something means to you and what it objectively stands for.
897985381643292672 2017-08-16 00:56:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @SAFEcoalitionNC Hey look! It's that Charlotte Mayor that sold out the transgender community for absolutely nothing.
897983144330014720 2017-08-16 00:47:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling It's so nice to be on your Facebook group and see other trans people being welcomed and free to express themselves.
897982731145105408 2017-08-16 00:45:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling thank you for not only your terrific show, but for cultivating such a trans-friendly gaming community. Thank god for you.
897841280641892353 2017-08-16 15:23:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Remember the good old days when "Nazis are bad" was something Republicans and Democrats agreed on?
897503288131698688 2017-08-15 17:00:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @imitalian1963 Consequences for being free to explore and define one's own identity? That's ridiculous.
897502899223146497 2017-08-15 16:59:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @boredpanda @OhMiaGod Transgender. People. Are. More. Interesting. Than. Their. Before. And. After. Pictures.
897457493605068801 2017-08-15 13:58:35 UTC <FaithNaff> Why is America falling behind? Well, maybe our clinging to dying technologies (coal) and celebrating our greatest failures (civil war).
897282058250317824 2017-08-14 02:21:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @imitalian1963 She apparently didn't push you to be a decent human being either.
897267997135523840 2017-08-14 01:25:35 UTC <FaithNaff> TERF tears are delicious.
896917035074105344 2017-08-13 02:10:59 UTC <FaithNaff> The top two highest trending tags right now are #Charolettesville a misspelled version of the same.
896870805807693824 2017-08-13 23:07:17 UTC <FaithNaff> The world is officially in Chaos when I'm retweeting @senorrinhatch in agreement.https://twitter.com/senorrinhatch/status/896486793083842560
896869982448922625 2017-08-13 23:04:01 UTC <FaithNaff> When you can't make your own torch to carry the flame of bigotry and hatred, store-bought is fine. #Charlottesvillepic.twitter.com/BVtg2msCwm
896810437433581568 2017-08-13 19:07:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Our president condemns made-up terrorist attacks in Sweden but doesn't acknowledge real terrorism on our own streets. #Charlottesville

896248329239236608 2017-08-11 05:53:47 UTC <FaithNaff> Someone at the Pentagon should change the nuclear launch code to hillarywouldhavebeenabetterpresident.   There, I just saved the world.
896071303186104323 2017-08-11 18:10:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @Kallisty If you can't beat'em, troll'em.
896056502154174464 2017-08-11 17:11:32 UTC <FaithNaff> I just referred to someone in a comment as "the #TERF version of Alex Jones". It's a weird conversation.
894364635935121408 2017-08-06 01:08:40 UTC <FaithNaff> When you're #transgender, ONE wrong pronoun can SHATTER you. I'm still picking up the pieces from earlier today.
894323797117083648 2017-08-06 22:26:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I am so fucking stupid sometimes.
894311220664295425 2017-08-06 21:36:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley I finally got my voice to where I get called ma'am on the phone, but it took a hell of a lot of practice.
894310504835018756 2017-08-06 21:33:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @biologicalriley Oh god, not being out at work was torture!
894309951803453440 2017-08-06 21:31:22 UTC <FaithNaff> For god sake, I know you always thought of me as your little boy, but I FUCKING HAVE TITS NOW! Tits! This shirt doesn't hide them! #NotAHe
894307457098551296 2017-08-06 21:21:27 UTC <FaithNaff> It's agonizing to be in a situation where you constantly get misgendered, can't correct them, can't get away, and can't show that it hurts.
894305862092771328 2017-08-06 21:15:07 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod Lucky. I'm with my mom right now and still getting male pronouns.
893854241705603073 2017-08-05 15:20:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @cameronesposito My wife has sometimes been my husband in conversations with strangers for safety's sake.

893078490639196162 2017-08-03 11:57:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @MarkRuffalo Thank me by casting actual Trans people for your Trans rolls.
891775265885630465 2017-07-30 21:39:26 UTC <FaithNaff> I am immune to internet trolls. They can't hurt me more than I hurt myself.
891773874240708609 2017-07-30 21:33:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Having one of those "I wish I could just be cis!" days.
891117820825743360 2017-07-28 02:06:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod It's also great to see people's reactions. "THAT WAS YOU?!?!?!?!"
891117610909261824 2017-07-28 02:06:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I do that when dysphoria tells me I still look masculine. A pic of me circa 2009 says, "no I fucking don't!"
891104298544881665 2017-07-28 01:13:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I like posting that stuff. I'm really proud of my progress and it helps my dysphoria to see the contrast.
890592564176449538 2017-07-27 15:19:48 UTC <FaithNaff> If wondering what another soldier's genitals looks like is distracting you from the mission, you are unfit to be a soldier. Full stop.
890590487542890496 2017-07-27 15:11:33 UTC <FaithNaff> "Your transgender status is distracting me!""Why the fuck are you thinking about my genitals while we're being shot at?!?!"
890555562659860480 2017-07-27 12:52:46 UTC <FaithNaff> Do the armed services pay for anti-depression or anti-anxiety medication?
890289728460914693 2017-07-26 19:16:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost Because they ARE morons.
890271609705070604 2017-07-26 18:04:26 UTC <FaithNaff> As much as it pains me to say it, don't let the military Trans issue distract you from healthcare. Don't ignore it, but don't lose sight.

889863092615753728 2017-07-25 15:01:08 UTC <FaithNaff> If your argument ever includes the phrase, "it's my opinion", you're an intellectual lightweight and need to GTFO.
889675890434723842 2017-07-24 02:37:16 UTC <FaithNaff> Events of the last 2 days have robbed me of all body confidence. It's gone. Just...gone.

889238390662713347 2017-07-23 21:38:48 UTC <FaithNaff> They don't care about your kind words. They're now looking for the next person to call them out who isn't an ally. You put them at risk.
889238228204752896 2017-07-23 21:38:09 UTC <FaithNaff> NEVER tell a #transgender person you can tell they're trans, even if you want to be supportive. Never fucking do that!

888174860702298112 2017-07-20 23:12:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound And they weren't afraid to make the art they wanted instead of what everyone expected. Each album was wholly unique.

888106408566071296 2017-07-20 18:40:42 UTC <FaithNaff> I can't stop crying. Chester's lyrics helped me make sense of so many emotions as I found my identity.  Fuck. Just...FUCK!

886746978490748928 2017-07-16 00:38:49 UTC <FaithNaff> I like to drink shots of straight lemon juice. Is that weird?
886745903549358080 2017-07-16 00:34:33 UTC <FaithNaff> What's more, it would be episodic so I could work on it in bursts.
886745558911725568 2017-07-16 00:33:10 UTC <FaithNaff> Today my brain pitched me an idea for a trans-centric romantic drama series and I think I'm going to write it. Would be a new genre for me.
886598760175980544 2017-07-16 14:49:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Trump's continued obsession with the election is like if the Patriots kept trying to prove Atlanta didn't have a 17 point lead at the half.
886597300965040128 2017-07-16 14:44:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @evelynhaddock If it means I gain another cup size then it's all worth it. :)
886394666794569728 2017-07-15 01:18:51 UTC <FaithNaff> So last week my estrogen regimen was increased and, well hello again, breast soreness. #transgender #transition #boobies
886206736264294400 2017-07-15 12:52:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod You are seriously gorgeous. :) <3
885590805892800512 2017-07-13 20:04:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Pretty sure lying is a big no-no according to that God fella you worship.https://twitter.com/VP/status/885539088253812737
885133171632852997 2017-07-12 13:46:07 UTC <FaithNaff> I apologize if I seem depressed or bitchy. Doctor upped my estrogen intake and it's fucking with my emotional stability.
885132249062154240 2017-07-12 13:42:27 UTC <FaithNaff> If Earth was a person and global warming were cancer, they'd be taking about stopping cemo and moving her into Hospice.
885131022748323840 2017-07-12 13:37:35 UTC <FaithNaff> If a Republican asked me "what's so bad about @realDonaldTrump?", my brain would explode just trying to figure out where to start.
885130505158627332 2017-07-12 13:35:32 UTC <FaithNaff> The election is over, you dumb fuck. Stop campaigning in an imaginary race and HANDLE YOUR SHIT! #disgracehttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/885128373441355777

883801179859406849 2017-07-08 21:33:16 UTC <FaithNaff> It's weird that I mean this without being hyperbolic: I literally think I could do a better job as president than what we have now.

883494548860698625 2017-07-07 01:14:49 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @the_moviebob ever thought about doing an IBWT on the fall of South Park? I remember you used to love that show.
883494235881828354 2017-07-07 01:13:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling Hope you feel better soon!  Also, why the fuck would people retweet this?

883301661069934593 2017-07-07 12:28:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @woodyandwilcox turned on my radio just in time for Chelsea to say "give me a pap smear". Sounds like a great show already.
883131566779707392 2017-07-06 01:12:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @RoyCooperNC and @NCDemParty have gone quiet on fighting for LGBT rights. They stop caring when we stop demanding action.
883130988825645056 2017-07-06 01:10:10 UTC <FaithNaff> LGBT people are only important to the @NCDemParty when it's topical. Unless it's in the national spotlight, they don't give a fuck about us.
883130453544370176 2017-07-06 01:08:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @RoyCooperNC remember promising to keep fighting for LGBT after your betrayal with #HB142? What are you doing for us? Guess you forgot.
883024807016763393 2017-07-06 18:08:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP Does that include climate science and evolution?
882617700958314496 2017-07-05 15:10:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod I never experienced body dysphoria until my early 20's. Before then I just knew I fit in better with girls.
881532991553622016 2017-07-02 15:20:17 UTC <FaithNaff> This is the priority of the fucking president of the United States.  Republicans are a national embarassment.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680

881073220673306628 2017-07-01 08:53:20 UTC <FaithNaff> I just heard a Trans woman refer to her hormone pills as "feminems" and I will be doing that from now on. XD
880760477529387008 2017-06-30 12:10:36 UTC <FaithNaff> When you've had to face a barrage of Internet attacks in the name of "God", then you can have your #heteroprideday
880760144308686849 2017-06-30 12:09:16 UTC <FaithNaff> When you've had to call you senators and demand they not try to criminalize your family, then you can #heteroprideday.
880759782684209152 2017-06-30 12:07:50 UTC <FaithNaff> When you have strangers driving by your house, honking their horns and yelling "FAGGOTS!", then you can #heteroprideday.
880758783449772036 2017-06-30 12:03:52 UTC <FaithNaff> When you have to see whose looking before you kiss your spouse in public, then you can have you #heteroprideday. Till then, fuck off.

880533637933940736 2017-06-29 21:09:13 UTC <FaithNaff> As the rest of the world innovates and progresses, we choose to live in the past.   It's pathetic.https://twitter.com/VP/status/880511893147762688

880054181188390913 2017-06-28 13:24:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod @EvieJMadison Lucky! Having mine removed with lasers cost me almost $5,000!!!
880053845472292864 2017-06-28 13:22:42 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @acegiak @OhMiaGod By that picture you posted...yea...you looked really feminine pre-transition. #jealous
880053206218399745 2017-06-28 13:20:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @LaurakBuzz @acegiak I always thought my beard looked good on me, I just didn't want it to.
880050634417950720 2017-06-28 13:09:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod I met my first transgender person EVER in college and, after he explained it to me, my whole life made frightening sense.
880049714510561280 2017-06-28 13:06:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod In my 20's I tried to fight my femininity by growing a beard, wearing camo, and becoming a Republican.Those were dark...dark times...
880047454829334528 2017-06-28 12:57:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod That's not how they walk. That's not how they talk. That's not what they like. That's not what they think. Etc.
880047255545417728 2017-06-28 12:56:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod My teen years were basically me studying how to be a man because I really sucked at it.
880046895330209792 2017-06-28 12:55:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @RhaganaD @LaurakBuzz I used to dream about living as a woman, now that I am I dream about going back in time and getting my youth back.
880046379078488064 2017-06-28 12:53:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @OhMiaGod Also, not so much ignore signs as not know how to iterpret them. All I knew for 20+ years was I didn't like being me.
880043996013367297 2017-06-28 12:43:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod You are gorgeous! If that's all pre-any physical transition I'm super jealous!
880043499613282304 2017-06-28 12:41:35 UTC <FaithNaff> If you're Transgender, make sure you're following @LaurakBuzz. She's a wealth of knowledge + experiences that will help you feel not alone.
880042451242803201 2017-06-28 12:37:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Your willingness to be open about your transition is such an inspiration. Thank you for all you do for our community. <3
880040935475879936 2017-06-28 12:31:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I used online personas. I always told myself it would be enough to just be female online.  I was just fooling myself.
880040578381205504 2017-06-28 12:29:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @RhaganaD I can SOOOOOO relate! You feel like you have to start your life in the middle.
880040194610745344 2017-06-28 12:28:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Call your senators every day and tell them to vote no on the #HealthcareBill.  Call. Every. Day.

878913519101636608 2017-06-25 09:51:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Cis-normativity is a radio commercial for Always pads saying, "ladies, periods are something we all have in common."
878595775214870528 2017-06-24 12:48:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Recognizing privileges isn't being mad at yourself for having them, but being mad at the world for unfairly giving them to you.
878580283469164544 2017-06-24 11:47:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco I want to see guys bring this up to actually change it, not as a reaction to lessen femininist arguments.
878579808057405440 2017-06-24 11:45:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Of course, if men WANT to wear skirts to work, there should be nothing stopping them.
878579518293803009 2017-06-24 11:44:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Seeing many stories of men wearing skirts to work because it's hot and shorts aren't allowes. All I say is bra-fucking-vo. Send a message.
878579205574987777 2017-06-24 11:43:00 UTC <FaithNaff> Bare legs look professional in women's attire but not men's because we've culturally trained ourselves to think that way.
878578923252191233 2017-06-24 11:41:53 UTC <FaithNaff> In fact, as global warming gets worse, I wouldn't be surprised to see shorts find their way into men's business attire.
878578667407978496 2017-06-24 11:40:52 UTC <FaithNaff> FYI, there are examples of sexism against men. Letting girls wear skirts at work but not letting men wear shorts is one of them. Not fair.

878287585210007552 2017-06-23 16:24:12 UTC <FaithNaff> I always used to eat so fast that I didn't realize I was full till I was over-stuffed. Not a problem anymore.
878287418948018176 2017-06-23 16:23:33 UTC <FaithNaff> After disiplining my eating habits, I'm shocked by just how little food my body actually needs to stay healthy and energetic.
878228044854505472 2017-06-23 12:27:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @CNN This is not as important as the dumpster fire of a Healthcare bill the GOP just revealed. Don't be distracted.

877857228128083968 2017-06-22 11:54:07 UTC <FaithNaff> @jeffreytambor People need to see Trans women that are women on screen and then women in the interview. This is about identity, not acting.
877857046908985344 2017-06-22 11:53:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @jeffreytambor It may not be his intent, but it's the result.
877856944631017472 2017-06-22 11:53:00 UTC <FaithNaff> When @jeffreytambor steps out in a suit to talk about playing a Trans woman, he perpetuates the notion that being Trans is just an act.
877854275287752704 2017-06-22 11:42:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I burned my thumb on the toaster this morning making breakfast.  How's your day going?
877842990911369216 2017-06-22 10:57:33 UTC <FaithNaff> The moment isn't the experience. It's the knowledge that the moment represents a pattern for the rest of your life.
877842729291706368 2017-06-22 10:56:30 UTC <FaithNaff> This is like if Robert Downey Jr. said he understood being black after Tropic Thunder.
877842386256355328 2017-06-22 10:55:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @jeffreytambor can't "get it" after experiencing transphobia once because he will always know it's temporary. We see our future in it.
877835080118321158 2017-06-22 10:26:07 UTC <FaithNaff> @jeffreytambor actually said he took a #trans "field trip" and that taught him what it's like to be trans.  This is why I avoid his show.
877834675275743232 2017-06-22 10:24:30 UTC <FaithNaff> Do not applaud this man. If he really "got it" about being #trans after a shopping trip he'd have given up the role.https://youtu.be/KAuwwKqdvww

877548809517228036 2017-06-21 15:28:34 UTC <FaithNaff> I really hope I get time to write my new blog post idea this evening because my mind is obsessing over it.
877541045826977796 2017-06-21 14:57:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @jonesy89cfpd Hillary Clinton: "Why didn't the kids vote for me? I said 'may the force be with you' and everything!"
877527819877744641 2017-06-21 14:05:10 UTC <FaithNaff> Dems: remember how @SenSanders got your young base excited like Obama did? Why do you keep thinking you can do this without them?
877527528835076096 2017-06-21 14:04:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Dems: cheated to stop their base from nominating the more progressing presidential candidate and lost. What the hell is it going to take?!
877527135015096320 2017-06-21 14:02:27 UTC <FaithNaff> If the Democrats didn't learn anything after loosing a presidential election to Donald Trump then they're just too fucking stupid to get it.
877526687327682560 2017-06-21 14:00:40 UTC <FaithNaff> Dems: remember when the GOP took control by running hardcore Tea Party candidates?  TAKE OFF THE KID GLOVES AND RUN SOME FUCKING LIBERALS!

877293325371486208 2017-06-20 22:33:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @POTUS It's pathetically easy to tell when it's you tweeting and when it's a staffer with an actual education and self restraint.
877259525610459137 2017-06-20 20:19:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenatorBurr VOTE NO ON #AHCA!!!!!
877259006301089793 2017-06-20 20:17:00 UTC <FaithNaff> Plot twist: the nurse couldn't find any. You have to have a heart if you're going to have blood. https://twitter.com/VP/status/877250281016315904
877184777744506880 2017-06-20 15:22:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Being #transgender is often waiting till you hear a pronoun used to determine if you need to feel afraid in a place or not.
877184517043257344 2017-06-20 15:21:00 UTC <FaithNaff> When you're a Trans woman in a very rural tire shop, getting "ma'am"ed is a huge relief.
877152546971897856 2017-06-20 13:13:58 UTC <FaithNaff> Hiding the #AHCA bill is a metaphor: you'll never see it just like your doctor will never see you again after it passes.
877151723126751232 2017-06-20 13:10:42 UTC <FaithNaff> Good luck to those voting in the #GA6 today. You will be an early judge of our rising momentum.   GO VOTE!!!!
877149419845685249 2017-06-20 13:01:32 UTC <FaithNaff> You won't find the #AHCA bill. Repubs hid it where they stash their dignity, humanity, and decency; and those haven't surfaced in a while.
876994326429151233 2017-06-19 02:45:15 UTC <FaithNaff> So proud to be a Democrat right now. DON'T GIVE UP! #HoldTheFloor

876747916077150208 2017-06-19 10:26:07 UTC <FaithNaff> Ted Nugent has a LONG list of violent rhetoric from the last 8 years to apologies for before he can dream of being taken seriously here.
876747360109563904 2017-06-19 10:23:54 UTC <FaithNaff> What do this hardcore liberal and hardcore conservative have in common?  They're both fucking terrible.  Just...just...terrible...https://twitter.com/thehill/status/876585584298524672
876607896737525761 2017-06-18 01:09:43 UTC <FaithNaff> The @NRA are a bunch of whack-jobs who help radicalize domestic terrorists though.
876607538615246848 2017-06-18 01:08:18 UTC <FaithNaff> However, having to resort to a car instead of having an AR15 does make a big difference and I'll take the former if I must have one.
876607104559218688 2017-06-18 01:06:34 UTC <FaithNaff> I mean, I'm really liberal, but I do tend to be more pro-gun than a lot of other liberals. I own 2 and am not giving them up.
876606701927100416 2017-06-18 01:04:58 UTC <FaithNaff> I Have to admit, events in London are giving weight to the "if you ban guns, murderers will just run people over in the streets" argument.

875737576644235266 2017-06-16 15:31:23 UTC <FaithNaff> He's right. We held a worldwide march last Sunday just to party for no reason.   It's not like a Trans woman just made the ballot in VA.https://twitter.com/spookperson/status/875399357721214978

875735900617142272 2017-06-16 15:24:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Any time @MarkRuffalo talks about Trans issues, I will point out that it's just a publicity move for him and he doesn't actually care.
875734904461570048 2017-06-16 15:20:46 UTC <FaithNaff> This man lost the right to stand with us when he cast a cis man to play a Trans woman in his movie. Your words ring hollow, sir.https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/875729117324423168

874396142519410689 2017-06-12 22:41:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno you still haven't drawn a connection between terrorist attacks and Transgender people peeing.

874333314957619200 2017-06-12 18:31:21 UTC <FaithNaff> Nothing rings more hollow than #PulseOrlando condolences from Republicans who champion conversion therapy.   You wanted worse for them.
874330416056029185 2017-06-12 18:19:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP is upset they died before he could torture the gay out of them in conversion therapy.  How dare you offer empty condolences.https://twitter.com/VP/status/874328600681598976

869030983990947840 2017-05-28 03:21:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno @Mortscab okay, you're clearly more interested in being an elitist than actually discussing this so take care.
869030710954405888 2017-05-28 03:20:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @Mortscab @Ryumoau_Juno we clearly hang out with very different groups of LGBT.
869030569514086400 2017-05-28 03:20:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno @Mortscab again, more going on culturally under the surface that makes it about more than its face value.
869030245457965056 2017-05-28 03:18:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @Mortscab @Ryumoau_Juno your argument assumes I stop at complaining.
869029728216375301 2017-05-28 03:16:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno @Mortscab there's a lot to unpack there culturally that goes beyond just seeing a movie.
869029487765327872 2017-05-28 03:15:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno @Mortscab I didn't know that. I also think it's a disappointing way to drive a culture though.
869029026681237508 2017-05-28 03:14:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno @Mortscab HEY! You think America is a laughing stock?! Well, THIS American woman...  ...absolutely agrees with you.
869028445929517056 2017-05-28 03:11:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno I know that sounded really simplistic but I was trying to squeeze it all into one tweet.
869028321262219265 2017-05-28 03:11:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno I thought her lore started on a women-only island to keep her safe from men before becoming a hero. Seems fitting to me.
869019215193354242 2017-05-28 02:35:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ryumoau_Juno I'm curious about that first part. How do you figure?
869009132053037057 2017-05-28 01:54:57 UTC <FaithNaff> So you all want an America where an all-female movie audience is discrimination but barring gays from your store is religious liberty?

866660584951087105 2017-05-22 14:22:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @MwieZorro @lamar_mcalister Do you know any transgender people? It's not pretending. It's also medically and psychologically proven that gender identity can vary.
866660337738809346 2017-05-22 14:21:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @MwieZorro @lamar_mcalister Then I'm more worried about cis male perverts, and I don't think they'll undergo full gender transition just to prey on girls in restrooms.

839582876517691393 2017-03-08 21:05:31 UTC <FaithNaff> "Happy #InternationalWomensDay cis women! You trans women can go fuck yourselves." -America
839575493099798528 2017-03-08 20:36:10 UTC <FaithNaff> I got to spend #InternationalWomensDay getting a driver license that says I'm a man because America doesn't give a shit about trans people.
839572209714741248 2017-03-08 20:23:07 UTC <FaithNaff> I sent an email to a rep with the @ACLU. Wondering if I have a case here.
839572056412934149 2017-03-08 20:22:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Now I have to get a passport just to have an ID with 100% correct information. So fucking ridiculous! I'M A WOMAN, GODDAMNIT!
839571801755824128 2017-03-08 20:21:30 UTC <FaithNaff> I feel like I've been issued a falsified document! Do my state and federal records not have to match?!
839571632637243394 2017-03-08 20:20:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Social Security now lists me as a female named Faith. NCDMV refuses to change my gender marker. How is it legal for them to do that?!
839533643542351872 2017-03-08 17:49:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @ACLU I need help! State of NC denied me my rights as a transgender woman. Is there anywhere I can turn for guidance on what I should do?
839462115257765889 2017-03-08 13:05:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Getting ready to go to the DMV and get a new license. Preparing for a fight to get my gender marker changed.
839461613694509056 2017-03-08 13:03:39 UTC <FaithNaff> He didn't have enough characters to add "as long as I find them attractive and they're submissive to my authority".https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/839433951957696513
839452388532572160 2017-03-08 12:27:00 UTC <FaithNaff> A critical role you never appreciate or wish to fully compensate. Also, no part of our role is to look beautiful for you, so fuck off.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/839433951957696513
839451595003871232 2017-03-08 12:23:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Not all who believe in God hate LGBT, nearly all who hate LGBT believe in God. This is why I don't trust religion.
839446967684038656 2017-03-08 12:05:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @RealComeonman it was culture. Lack of understanding + no cultural conversation = people stay closeted.
839318021952925696 2017-03-07 03:33:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @RealComeonman again...that makes no sense.
839317844672274433 2017-03-07 03:32:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @RealComeonman it hasn't been for hundreds of species who exhibit gender and sexual variances. Read "Evolutions Rainbow".
839306042685210624 2017-03-07 02:45:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost @RealComeonman that has absolutely no bearing on this topic.
839305747645214720 2017-03-07 02:44:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @washingtonpost GOD is make believe. GOD didn't make anything. Stop pandering to ignorance and intolerance.
839278848835534848 2017-03-07 00:57:25 UTC <FaithNaff> "Sell you iPhone to buy insurance" is America's version of "then let them eat cake".
838537219006730240 2017-03-05 23:50:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Finally about to see Rouge One.
838524890076557314 2017-03-05 23:01:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter @grandypa75 that...is a meaningless response.
838507146371293185 2017-03-05 21:50:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter @grandypa75 the fact that the liberals are the ones fighting for Muslims, immigrants, and LGBT.
838491302056583169 2017-03-05 20:47:59 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter @lylegardner gay and Trans people deserve respect. Climate change is real. Muslims aren't scary. These are facts.
838484853683269635 2017-03-05 20:22:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Beautiful day.pic.twitter.com/BWdYDiJ6pz
838483504228859905 2017-03-05 20:17:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter protests since election have been overwhelmingly civil. Zero arrests at any women's marches across the country.
838468431288631297 2017-03-05 19:17:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter based on???
838459735762485249 2017-03-05 18:42:33 UTC <FaithNaff> Sorry but @MarkRuffalo still has no credibility with Trans people, not after he wouldn't cast one of us for his Trans role in "Anything".https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/838451768384086016
838459286057594884 2017-03-05 18:40:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @huffpostqueer @MarkRuffalo that is the most ludicrous anti-trans argument I've heard in a while.
838459045757468672 2017-03-05 18:39:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @huffpostqueer @MarkRuffalo Trans is beautiful. Now if only filmmakers like you would cast Trans people for Trans roles and actually help.
838417479982530560 2017-03-05 15:54:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @NPR @_A_Trotter more like through the lense of empathy and compassion.
838417044215328770 2017-03-05 15:52:55 UTC <FaithNaff> @politico thank god! It was getting WAY too easy to breathe around here! Good thing GOP doesn't give a shit about Earth.
838416564873482240 2017-03-05 15:51:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @politico this is terrfying.
838413133685350400 2017-03-05 15:37:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @nytimes I will NEVER consider the Pope a good person for as long as he demonizes Transgender people.
838406379807334400 2017-03-05 15:10:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna your typo aside, I'll let Trump be president just like the right did for Obama.
838281334263021568 2017-03-04 06:53:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna what proof do I need that states shouldn't decide civil rights issues?
838279598353879040 2017-03-04 06:46:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna states don't get to decide on civil rights. And why are only things the GOP doesn't like up to the states?
838277120182878208 2017-03-04 06:36:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @Denisedances @onthego228 enjoy your, 'no one's coming after me so fuck everyone else' privilege. I'll be fighting for equality.
838276748206813185 2017-03-04 06:35:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna that "lie" has video footage, witness testemony, and proof within the orders he signs.
838276229476265984 2017-03-04 06:33:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna his executive orders specifically target them. Visa-carrying immigrants detained. Transgender protections stripped away.
838274057707597825 2017-03-04 06:24:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @notbrendan @Creodonta12 we also used to have higher wages, affordable college, and strong unions. We're not lazy, we're fucked.
838273523114205184 2017-03-04 06:22:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @iamkawsar because he can do whatever he wants because penis. That's what it boils down to.
838272937803284480 2017-03-04 06:20:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP @dmagee3_donna I'll stop attacking him when he stops attacking immigrants, Muslims, and LGBT. I don't start fights, but I finish them.
838272428476411905 2017-03-04 06:18:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @POTUS @VP @Denisedances @onthego228 stand up to the evils of tollerance, education, diversity, and acceptance?
838272174456770561 2017-03-04 06:17:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @VP America has never been great for all. If you all ever figured that out then maybe it finally could be.
838161007059079168 2017-03-04 22:55:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco I prefer the notion that I'm some sort of witch. :p
838047848046407681 2017-03-04 15:25:51 UTC <FaithNaff> My conditioner lasted through 1.5 shampoo bottles and I think I might have broke physics.
838017243313278977 2017-03-04 13:24:15 UTC <FaithNaff> @cameronesposito my wife and I went on a date last week and they waitress assumed we were splitting the check without asking.
837508627179180032 2017-03-02 03:43:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @karatwrites @mmmdraco I don't know... Justin Trudeau was a guest star for one episode.
837362444771209217 2017-03-02 18:02:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenatorBurr the fact that your Twitter says nothing about the Russia scandal says everything about how much we can trust you.
837084258418184192 2017-03-01 23:36:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal @LNation10 "bad things happen to other people too" is not a valid argument to ignore a problem.
837084034840870912 2017-03-01 23:36:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal @LNation10 not a zero sum situation. Mourning some isn't done at the expense of others.
836766981072306179 2017-02-28 02:36:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @POTUS you are all talk with neither the ability or the drive to back it up. #fraud
836766299707568129 2017-02-28 02:33:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal "white men in womanface".
836765381964484609 2017-02-28 02:29:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz if you ever want another Trans woman for such a podcast drop me a line!
836728549734244352 2017-02-28 00:03:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Coworker: "You watching Trump's speech tonight?"  Me: "I'd rather pour battery acid in my eyes."
836726731021123584 2017-02-28 23:56:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal your insult of trans women seemed oppositional.
836703165860962304 2017-02-28 22:22:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal why does any of that make my mention of the victim's races bad?
836546075494338560 2017-02-28 11:58:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco that's what I figured.
836545314878259200 2017-02-28 11:55:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal Trans women of color are one of the most at-risk demographics in America. That needs to be talked about.
836544586038272000 2017-02-28 11:52:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco @womensmarch @Ovalegal hu?
836525324569612288 2017-02-28 10:35:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread @DebraMMason1 so it has no bearing on why Trans women shouldn't be allowed in the restroom.
836382418269528064 2017-02-27 01:08:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 it's a mute point either way.
836379587785461761 2017-02-27 00:56:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 "creepy people" don't abuse Trans protection ordinances in the states/cities where they already exist.
836379184565993472 2017-02-27 00:55:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread @DebraMMason1 the fact that men would likely harass a woman in the men's room has nothing to do with Trump.
836378904646537217 2017-02-27 00:54:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread @DebraMMason1 you can't "just be" when laws are passed to keep you from doing that. That's the whole point of all of this.
836378675171983361 2017-02-27 00:53:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 A: you're assuming I haven't already had surgery.  B: if no one notices NOW...then it doesn't matter NOW.
836371643362594817 2017-02-27 00:25:13 UTC <FaithNaff> Trans youth: there's a difference between people who are supportive and just somewhat tollerant. Seek the former. They're not the same.
836371198254723072 2017-02-27 00:23:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread and people wonder why I'm an atheist...
836369058987716608 2017-02-27 00:14:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread that's not support then. That's mild tollerance.
836366689293979649 2017-02-27 00:05:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread on purpose? That doesn't sound like she respects your identity.
836363596284186625 2017-02-27 23:53:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @spoodertom @rykbread good!
836363423374012416 2017-02-27 23:52:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread also, do your parents support your gender identity?
836362748883832832 2017-02-27 23:49:52 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread I am so sorry. Can you try to find an ally within school admin? How's your principal?
836361129886625794 2017-02-27 23:43:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread have you had anything bad happen to you in a women's room at school? Any harrassments?
836360717448138752 2017-02-27 23:41:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz he said he wouldn't and he always lies, so there's that.
836359929669763072 2017-02-27 23:38:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @rykbread I hope he can help you go without being targeted. Holding it all day can damage your bladder. You talked to any school admins?
836357963531026432 2017-02-27 23:30:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @DebraMMason1 @rykbread is your friend male or female?
836356549907984384 2017-02-27 23:25:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @womensmarch @mmmdraco and it must be stressed that they were all women of color.
836356108914733056 2017-02-27 23:23:29 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @DebraMMason1 @rykbread that's dangerous for your health. Can someone go with you?
836328075419860992 2017-02-27 21:32:06 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @rykbread @DebraMMason1 as well as greatly increase my chances of facing harrassment.
836327986961993729 2017-02-27 21:31:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @rykbread @DebraMMason1 legally in certain buildings yes. I break that law because me in a men's room would look weird.
836327703871700992 2017-02-27 21:30:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 @TateOrtena no. I own 2 guns.
836327649979039746 2017-02-27 21:30:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 the law makes illegal what is already happening with no incident.
836327279500361732 2017-02-27 21:28:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @DebraMMason1 why would I want to announce anything? I just want to pee and get on with my day.
836282693591662592 2017-02-27 18:31:46 UTC <FaithNaff> The fact that the first Oscar win for an LGBTQ movie had a black cast is monumentally important. Congratulations, @moonlightmov.
836183095606935552 2017-02-27 11:56:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling fucking brilliant, mate. Glad to finally see the muzzle come off.
836171505725734912 2017-02-27 11:09:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @rykbread @DebraMMason1 so punish the creeps, not innocent Trans people.
836171162388398080 2017-02-27 11:08:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @Steph35300322 you're right. Everyone can just use the bathroom where they're most comfortable. It's so simple.
836051045000310785 2017-02-26 03:11:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @LauritzGuildie you need to post stats in order to claim they're on your side.
836050365615333376 2017-02-26 03:08:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @Steph35300322 no. I will not be punished for a crime I didn't commit.
836050080239058946 2017-02-26 03:07:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @Steph35300322 which doesn't happen.
836049189301862400 2017-02-26 03:03:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @LauritzGuildie oh please, continue to lecture me on my own mind armed with nothing but your "world view". So enlightening.
836047098650968067 2017-02-26 02:55:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @LauritzGuildie doesn't work for the trans person or for the society unwilling to accept them? Because I can attest it works.
836041182769709056 2017-02-26 02:32:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @Steph35300322 Trans women have been using "your" bathroom for years. Statistically, you've been in a bathroom with one.
836040114702848002 2017-02-26 02:27:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @newcreationron please forgive me for my assault on their crusade to take my rights away. How inconsiderate of me.
836039488694534144 2017-02-26 02:25:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @rykbread @DebraMMason1 I'm a trans woman. I use public bathrooms every day and nothing happens. It's normal.
836038749742071808 2017-02-26 02:22:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @Xanymal TRANSLATION: I agree with you on other stuff so I can't possibly be a bigot.
836038468224561154 2017-02-26 02:21:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders it's a complicated process involving walking in, peeing in the toilet, washing your hands, and leaving.
836036086140907524 2017-02-26 02:11:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @BernieSanders @LauritzGuildie the help they need is to transition and live authentically. Nothing else works.
836035838752468993 2017-02-26 02:10:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Thank you @BernieSanders for fighting for us. #transisbeautifulhttps://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/835980013761662977
834844281785417728 2017-02-23 19:16:02 UTC <FaithNaff> I think the current most privileged statement possible is "I'm so sick of hearing about politics".
834843615625170944 2017-02-23 19:13:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz you are a blessing to the Transgender community.
834840991664332800 2017-02-23 19:02:57 UTC <FaithNaff> Our president has sexually assaulted more women than the entire Transgender community combined. Yet we're the scary ones.
833635889217675264 2017-02-20 11:14:18 UTC <FaithNaff> Welcome to 2017, where we punish Trans women for made up assaults in bathrooms and punish immigrants for made up terrorist attacks.
833454798447996928 2017-02-19 23:14:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @HBO, how about you fire @billmaher and give his time slots to @LastWeekTonight? The Trans community would thank you.
833110160436502528 2017-02-18 00:25:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Representation matters. It's hard sometimes to enjoy a show or movie when you keep noticing, 'none of them are like me.'
832283270989639680 2017-02-16 17:39:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Republicans say refugees threaten our security and yet ignore all this Russia shit.
830724675579805696 2017-02-12 10:26:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @LS_Taylor I'm planning to do a basic makeup tutorial for Trans women in the near future. All are welcome to message me specific questions.
830482255139237889 2017-02-11 18:22:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @LS_Taylor Can't say I do. My partner taught me. Is your friend trans?
830482086888869889 2017-02-11 18:22:13 UTC <FaithNaff> Was just fixing our pride flags from where the mounts were damaged in the wind. Someone driving by yelled, "FAGGOT!"  How's your day going?

828940947580940288 2017-02-07 12:18:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz well, if you're ever looking to hire an editor, I have a BA in English. #TwitterResume
828682503321944065 2017-02-06 19:11:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob I love your topical stuff. You're like my nerdy NPR. :)
828681965251465216 2017-02-06 19:09:11 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @realDonaldTrump, executive orders aren't the Apple terms of service. READ THAT SHIT BEFORE YOU SIGN!
827112570444197888 2017-02-02 11:12:58 UTC <FaithNaff> It's illegal both to discriminate against gays and to feed the homeless. Guess which one "religious freedom" fans are eager to change.
826185518220210181 2017-01-30 21:49:11 UTC <FaithNaff> I have been asked to speak at this event. Please come out and show support to those fighting for #Equality . #LGBT #transgenderpic.twitter.com/La3P5Gj5gj
826185192746389504 2017-01-30 21:47:54 UTC <FaithNaff> History is trying to repeat itself. This is our test to see if we have the guts to say no this time.
825882490116116480 2017-01-29 01:45:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco everything you just said is true.
825712482266267648 2017-01-29 14:29:31 UTC <FaithNaff> The history of Trump won't be that he was able to fool America, but that America was dumb enough to be so easily fooled.
825349335152001024 2017-01-28 14:26:30 UTC <FaithNaff> Tell me about the Christ you worship and then explain why you won't open you home to refugees. Go on...I'll wait...
824455178850013186 2017-01-25 03:13:26 UTC <FaithNaff> You know you live in the future when you get to say the phrase, "our light switch is flashing because it has to install a firmware update."
824328941938806786 2017-01-25 18:51:49 UTC <FaithNaff> If you see a tweet from a national park about climate change, don't retweet it. Screen-cap it and share image before deletion  #ResistTrump
822425699965341696 2017-01-20 12:49:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Okay, Tea Party, time to sit back and watch how intelligent people protest a president.
821728523664654336 2017-01-18 14:38:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Why did the snail get GPS? He wanted to know where escargot! #BadJokes #IHateMyself
820677287951613953 2017-01-15 17:01:27 UTC <FaithNaff> New blog post on the dos and don'ts (mostly don'ts) of making a project about #transgender people. #LGBT #trans https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2017/01/15/so-you-wanna-do-a-project-on-trans-people/
819313225929986049 2017-01-11 22:41:09 UTC <FaithNaff> Obama serves 8 years scandal free and now @realDonaldTrump is in trouble for treason and pee-play before he even takes office.
819185721214926852 2017-01-11 14:14:30 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @realDonaldTrump, if you think @AlecBaldwin was hurting your feelings before...oh boy are you in for a treat. #GoldenShowers
818602594448920580 2017-01-09 23:37:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @JenRobertsNC how much $ did Charlotte lose to HB2 before you threw Trans people under the bus? What's our humanity not more valuable than?
818472284709146625 2017-01-09 14:59:33 UTC <FaithNaff> You can't pass "bathroom bills" to protect women while also defunding Planned Parenthood. You're not even trying to hide the lies.
818107795593629696 2017-01-08 14:51:12 UTC <FaithNaff> I want to point out that, in 2008, their was a national security discussion on whether Obama should be allowed to keep his Blackberry.https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/817568825562501120
818097120926429190 2017-01-08 14:08:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I used to shop for makeup while looking at my phone so it looked like someone was texting me to get it for them.
817953881376362499 2017-01-07 04:39:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @HamillHimself is doing the Lord's work.https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/817901534948179968
817949135869538304 2017-01-07 04:20:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Then there are days I stare in the mirror, trying to find the woman I saw there just the day before. #genderdysphoria
817948809015726084 2017-01-07 04:19:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Some days I love looking in the mirror, others I avoid it.
817948077990481921 2017-01-07 04:16:33 UTC <FaithNaff> I tend to vent more to Twitter than Facebook when dysphoria hits. Not sure why.
817947661064163328 2017-01-07 04:14:53 UTC <FaithNaff> *sigh* I may keep looking more and more feminine, but I'll always look trans.pic.twitter.com/KrPcua5cjv
817577404193505280 2017-01-06 03:43:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey guys! @realDonaldTrump is gonna get Mexico to pay us for the wall! Also, I'm inheriting $1million if I just go ahead and pay the taxes!
816133591105208322 2017-01-02 04:06:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Breast tenderness has returned. Hoping that means more growth on the way. #transissues #MTFtransition #TMI #boobies
815609942874984448 2017-01-01 17:25:38 UTC <FaithNaff> Sucessful...  BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!!  #EpicFail #HistoricLoss #LaughingStock #Shame https://twitter.com/GovOfficeNC/status/815198434206646272
813181713010585600 2016-12-25 00:36:43 UTC <FaithNaff> 2016: "Look at that. Everyone is enjoying Christmas. They all look so happy. I think I'll kill George Michael." #Fuck2016 #georgemichael
813067423842701313 2016-12-25 17:02:34 UTC <FaithNaff> Okay, family obligations fulfilled. Now get me out of the land of male pronouns and dead names.
811875577951059968 2016-12-22 10:06:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Welcome to North Carolina, where the Republicans are evil and the Democrats are gullible idiots. #HB2 #WeAreNotThis
811566198559215616 2016-12-21 13:37:14 UTC <FaithNaff> If one more cisgender person tells me how to act in response to legislation that targets my rights I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
811451516431323140 2016-12-20 06:01:32 UTC <FaithNaff> "I have to wonder how many of my injuries came from soft things." -@mmmdraco
810969773311922176 2016-12-19 22:07:15 UTC <FaithNaff> The NCGA's message today was clear: we'd rather see the state collapse than recognize transgender people are people. #HB2 #NorthCarolina
810886954359422980 2016-12-19 16:38:10 UTC <FaithNaff> It never would have held up in court! What happened to standing up for what's right?! #HB2 #NorthCarolina #Charlotte
810883331088908288 2016-12-19 16:23:46 UTC <FaithNaff> 2016: the year hate always won. #HB2 #NC #translivesmatterpic.twitter.com/IA6cIkiMrK

810289880429461505 2016-12-17 01:05:36 UTC <FaithNaff> The goddamn president-elect of the United States can't even fucking spell! #unpresidented
808609392056791040 2016-12-13 09:47:56 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm learning that hope is nothing more than the prelude to greater disappointment.
808375638470127617 2016-12-12 18:19:05 UTC <FaithNaff> Hurray for little things done by bosses that completely dehumanize you.
807719965394669568 2016-12-10 22:53:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Why is the GOP worried about national security with ISIS but not Russia hacking our election?  Russians are white.  Next question.
807035569192767488 2016-12-08 01:34:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Goal now becomes having surgery in the late fall of 2017. Very preliminary and a lot could still change that.
807035219215785985 2016-12-08 01:32:44 UTC <FaithNaff> So found out tonight that my insurance will cover gender affirmation surgery! So excited...and terrified... #transgender
807034411413860352 2016-12-08 01:29:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump @Twitter Hey @twitter. I'm begging you, as a matter of national security, PLEASE delete @realdonaldtrump's account!
806804268242059264 2016-12-08 10:15:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Things "safe spaces are for pussies" people are offended by 2016:  Starbucks cups Black Santa  Stay tuned for more.
805772960481079296 2016-12-05 13:56:58 UTC <FaithNaff> Republicans care more about a flag's right to not get burned than a woman's right to not get raped.
805046594513072128 2016-12-03 13:50:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco does way too good an impression of an old, Jewish guy.
804167934461571072 2016-11-30 03:39:10 UTC <FaithNaff> There's an hour and a half left of November. I should probably start on that #NaNoWriMo2016 project.   I've got time...
804167255797989376 2016-11-30 03:36:29 UTC <FaithNaff> I wish my life was so easy and privileged I had to make up reasons to be outraged. #DumpKelloggs
804166708760023040 2016-11-30 03:34:18 UTC <FaithNaff> We're here worried our rights will be legislated away, but go on about how you're mad Tony the Tiger isn't a Nazi. #DumpKelloggs
804165847224827904 2016-11-30 03:30:53 UTC <FaithNaff> This is how privilege works: we're mad over losing rights and getting killed. You're mad a company doesn't agree with you. #DumpKelloggs
804165159744917504 2016-11-30 03:28:09 UTC <FaithNaff> #DumpKelloggs say the people who think liberals get to riled up and offended over silly little things.
804163399382876161 2016-11-30 03:21:09 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm not one for safety pin hate, but I question your devotion if you're trying to make it look "fashionable".
804162454817296384 2016-11-30 03:17:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Not much more I can do for name change stuff now. Just gotta wait for stuff to come back.
804160190903783424 2016-11-30 03:08:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Having one of those moments when you just think, "damn I wish I could just be cis". #transgender
804159925660372992 2016-11-30 03:07:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob they made @NancyPelosi minority leader again. Sadly, they're not changing shit.
804159356522627072 2016-11-30 03:05:05 UTC <FaithNaff> You've got no lies left to work with @PatMcCroryNC. Time to stop being a child and concede. This is embarrassing.
804087344244674560 2016-11-30 22:18:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Democrats keep losing because they refuse to change.https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/804003059022123008
804086592109498372 2016-11-30 22:15:57 UTC <FaithNaff> And suddenly, epic downpour!
803599499281235968 2016-11-29 14:00:25 UTC <FaithNaff> It just took me a second to remember how to turn on my windshield wipers.
803414584803688448 2016-11-28 01:45:38 UTC <FaithNaff> FBI background check stuff gets mailed off tomorrow! #transgender #NameChangeJourney
803293435809644544 2016-11-28 17:44:14 UTC <FaithNaff> I really need to stop immediately assuming the worst.
802901193387147265 2016-11-27 15:45:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Just had a customer say I must be married based on how I snatched the money out of his hand. #sexism
802810176017416192 2016-11-27 09:43:56 UTC <FaithNaff> So @the_moviebob, I'm curious... does "In Bob We Trust" have a junk drawer?
802629529466335232 2016-11-26 21:46:06 UTC <FaithNaff> Was hoping to be bored by many more a sermon from you, Sheppard.  RIP Ron Glass.  #firefly #fuck2016
802594041560825856 2016-11-26 19:25:05 UTC <FaithNaff> Looks like the Clinton camp is going to participate in recount.   I guess Hillary is done licking her wounds and feeling sorry for herself.
802381278553088000 2016-11-25 05:19:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz me too, though mine are job and family issue triggered, not gender dysphoria.
801060388196483072 2016-11-22 13:50:54 UTC <FaithNaff> "Float, bitches!" -@mmmdraco
800804749385859072 2016-11-21 20:55:05 UTC <FaithNaff> The deputy who finger printed me asked if I was pre or post opp. Why do people think my genitals are up for casual conversation? #trans
800749247708745728 2016-11-21 17:14:32 UTC <FaithNaff> The lie of Thanksgiving is such a farce it's literally playing out in front of us right now. #NoDAPL
800421643889741824 2016-11-20 19:32:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco I cherish you. <3
800404764907466752 2016-11-20 18:25:41 UTC <FaithNaff> This is the transcript of my speech tonight for #transdayofrememberance #TDOR #transgender https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/11/20/transgender-day-of-remembrance-2016/
800097758560460800 2016-11-19 22:05:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump throwing a tantrum because Pence was called out at Hamilton. You GOP idiots elected a spoiled child!
800049438270091264 2016-11-19 18:53:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Protesting Trump will be unlike anything seen from protesting Obama because this time it's the smart people who are pissed off.
800018476211597312 2016-11-19 16:50:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Cried as I wrote my speech for #transdayofremembrance tomorrow, so I'm sure I'm going to as I give it.
799790225883070464 2016-11-18 01:43:43 UTC <FaithNaff> "We didn't hold protests and demonstrate when Obama won." -People who literally started a movement named after the fucking Boston Tea Party.
799688347052638208 2016-11-18 18:58:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Applied for a reprint of my Social Security card.  It's a start.
799628696885727233 2016-11-18 15:01:52 UTC <FaithNaff> In brighter news, my journey to name and gender marker change starts NOW! Off to the Social Security office and the court house.
799628553574895616 2016-11-18 15:01:18 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm really feeling tempted to take down the American flag in my yard. Looking at it now makes me feel physically ill.
799605768895033344 2016-11-18 13:30:45 UTC <FaithNaff> GOP logic: Nothing bad could ever come from registering Muslims, but gay marriage is a slippery slope leading to people marrying dogs.
799603836398628864 2016-11-18 13:23:05 UTC <FaithNaff> To the people of the world thinking America is mostly a bunch of idiots filled with either hatred or apathy  Yea, you're pretty much right.
799390055710261248 2016-11-17 23:13:35 UTC <FaithNaff> To all the people jumping on the "say no to fake news sites" bandwagon: welcome to the party but you're all too late.
799000229974392832 2016-11-16 21:24:34 UTC <FaithNaff> Finally feel like I'm moving forward with my name change. I have a plan and I have help. Gotta get this done before Trump takes office.
798999054420213760 2016-11-16 21:19:53 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz that's called Imposter Syndrome. I often feel the same way. It's a form of anxiety.
798866964294803456 2016-11-16 12:35:01 UTC <FaithNaff> As we threaten the water of Natives, our rain goes away when we need it most. I'm not a religious girl, but I think their gods are winning.
798651956222824448 2016-11-15 22:20:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling @LaurakBuzz I'll do it, but only it you ask nicely.
798378047644770304 2016-11-14 04:12:14 UTC <FaithNaff> We're not "descending into" those things. We're continuing to wollow in them.https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/798346463386341377
798366119908118528 2016-11-14 03:24:50 UTC <FaithNaff> Dems want to control SCOTUS to protect/progress rights. GOP wants it to take things away. That literally says everything you need to know.
798364240222584833 2016-11-14 03:17:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Upper lip is a little puffy and swollen from my laser session. #transition #transisbeautiful #PainIsBeauty #nomakeuppic.twitter.com/LEr1fIZsfQ
798280200043855872 2016-11-14 21:43:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Now more problems with the car. Can something PLEASE go right?!
798164849406726144 2016-11-14 14:05:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Laser hair removal session today at noon. Not fun, but better than trying to hide facial hair.
797616086430679041 2016-11-12 01:44:28 UTC <FaithNaff> The team Trump is putting  together is basically the Legion of Doom.
797255801354223616 2016-11-11 01:52:49 UTC <FaithNaff> The president-elect of the United States is iffy on the question, "are Nazis bad?".  Let that sink in.
796908309609586688 2016-11-10 02:52:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Depends on when it is. I live an hour away.
796907231388307456 2016-11-10 02:47:44 UTC <FaithNaff> I've started open-carrying my gun. I didn't want it to come to that, but here we are.
796906954899750913 2016-11-10 02:46:38 UTC <FaithNaff> In honor of our new president, I'm going to stop paying my taxes. He said that would make me smart.
796475864984731650 2016-11-09 22:13:38 UTC <FaithNaff> If you are #LGBTQ and looking for hope in these dark times, here is, I believe, our only path forward. https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/finding-hope-for-lgbt-in-trumps-america/
796352532448772096 2016-11-09 14:03:33 UTC <FaithNaff> All of human history, from our dawn as a species to the end of the world, will be summed up as, "white people completely fucked it all up."
796062747461042176 2016-11-08 18:52:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Most Canadian thing I've ever said: "Please accept this apology moose."
796032158783729668 2016-11-08 16:50:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling I'm a long time Jimquisiton fan. Just discovered Nitpick Theater and I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe! Awesome stuff!
796031663499345920 2016-11-08 16:48:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Mike Pence supports conversion therapy for trans people, while half likely kill themselves during. He and Trump terrify me.
795611067099582464 2016-11-07 12:57:14 UTC <FaithNaff> BRILLIANT!https://twitter.com/the_moviebob/status/795600358798225408
795608099931426816 2016-11-07 12:45:27 UTC <FaithNaff> In the last few hours, my feelings are the prefect definition of cautiously optimistic. #ImWitHer
795277152237289473 2016-11-06 14:50:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I get personal in this blog post, but it's a question #transgender people need to consider for themselves. https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/expressing-transgender-pride/

795014995885125633 2016-11-05 21:28:40 UTC <FaithNaff> Have a blog post idea but I'm stuck at work.
794693014077796352 2016-11-04 00:09:13 UTC <FaithNaff> Finding time to write when I'm so busy has been overwhelming. Re-editing old works and submitting them to publishers feels more productive.
794692463478902785 2016-11-04 00:07:02 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob and also with you. :P
794564961188151296 2016-11-04 15:40:23 UTC <FaithNaff> In 600 years, our treatment of Native Americans has improved to the level of "just don't actually kill them". #NoDAPL
794477969171484672 2016-11-04 09:54:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Cancel Thanksgiving. It's a lie. Who are we kidding? It's been over 600 years and we still treat Natives like shit. #NoDAPL
794299215039975424 2016-11-03 22:04:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Don't ever tell me liberals are too easily offended. Two years now you all have gotten outraged over the color of a goddamn Starbucks cup.
793663760061853696 2016-11-01 03:59:20 UTC <FaithNaff> Donald Trump gaining in polls ground despite getting ready to go to court for rape because fuck America.

789477765087133696 2016-10-21 14:45:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @MikeMcWhertor @Andrewpitts This image was the first thing I saw about the Switch. I like it now that I've seen what it is.
789476252025487360 2016-10-21 14:39:40 UTC <FaithNaff> Had a BLAST at the @equalitync panel in Morganton last night. Thanks for having me as a guest and please think of me for the next event.
789476069208383488 2016-10-21 14:38:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump debates just like every right-wing nut I've ever argued with online. Nothing but baseless yelling and angry fear mongering.
789163351452491777 2016-10-20 17:56:19 UTC <FaithNaff> What the hell is this, Nintendo?https://twitter.com/MikeMcWhertor/status/789127099277643776
789136644398018560 2016-10-20 16:10:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Trump's campaign is proof that it doesn't have to be true as long as you make it sound scary enough.
787513531268816897 2016-10-15 04:40:31 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm at a loss. To think, in 2016, hate is still so proudly displayed. #NeverTrump https://twitter.com/prasejeebus/status/787427872474484736
787469002884935680 2016-10-15 01:43:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @equalitync @SarahEMcBride I wanted to go!!!! :(
786901464551657472 2016-10-14 12:08:23 UTC <FaithNaff> Here's a random blog post about video games to keep me from talking about politics. https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/video-games-confessions-of-a-filthy-casual/
786019656456933376 2016-10-11 01:44:24 UTC <FaithNaff> The GOP nominating @realDonaldTrump is every woman who ever started dating a bad boy because she was so sure she could chance him.
785242643026546689 2016-10-09 22:16:49 UTC <FaithNaff> Based on the teaser trailer, the Power Rangers movie looks like, "what if the kids from the Breakfast Club got super powers".
785147946388099072 2016-10-09 16:00:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Cis men: "Oh, we all say stuff like what Trump said. That's normal. BTW, watch out for trans people in bathrooms. They're perverts."
785147106784866304 2016-10-09 15:57:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @PatMcCroryNC, your boy Trump just admitted to the kind of sexual assault you wrongfully accuse trans women of. Got anything to say?
784558035343663104 2016-10-07 00:56:26 UTC <FaithNaff> This is what hypocrisy looks like.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/322079549812785152
784548590203105280 2016-10-07 00:18:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey, @realDonaldTrump, no way you could grab @HillaryClinton by the pussy since she's clearly got you by the balls already.
784548348632166400 2016-10-07 00:17:57 UTC <FaithNaff> If you're a conservative and offended that your feed is suddenly full of the word "pussy", just remember that it's your candidates fault.

783779156433698816 2016-10-05 21:21:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Ug. Too sick to do ANYTHING productive.
783776235260350464 2016-10-05 21:09:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Have you read my blog post on trans representation done right?
783735886630359040 2016-10-05 18:29:31 UTC <FaithNaff> our story isn't worth sharing unless they tell it. :(
783735019265155072 2016-10-05 18:26:04 UTC <FaithNaff> the fact that show stars cis people is still too much of a turn off for me to try it.
783463678008000512 2016-10-04 00:27:51 UTC <FaithNaff> I'd be up live Tweeting the #VPDebate if I wasn't sick or if I didn't have to be up at 4:30am.
783454240123518976 2016-10-04 23:50:21 UTC <FaithNaff> My new goal in life is that I basically want to be the next @SarahEMcBride.
783453614606090240 2016-10-04 23:47:52 UTC <FaithNaff> Sent out volunteer opportunity requests to several LGBT organizations in NC. Really eager to do more for the community.

780843624393302016 2016-09-27 18:56:42 UTC <FaithNaff> Every time @realDonaldTrump interrupted @HillaryClinton, I wanted her to say, "wait your turn, Donald. Grownups are talking."

780589352413954048 2016-09-26 02:06:18 UTC <FaithNaff> Notice he didn't actually say he wasn't guilty. Just that he didn't admit guilt at the time. #DebateNight

779430491967610881 2016-09-23 21:21:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Ha! That moment you outsmart a right wing mansplainer and he blocks you because he can't handle it.
779340679126319104 2016-09-23 15:24:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @Andrewpitts I'm not there. I live an hour away.
779340583936614400 2016-09-23 15:24:09 UTC <FaithNaff> "Vote your conscience" is a convenience awarded to those who only have a clear conscience to lose.
779130718467268608 2016-09-22 01:30:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ben_Huh Cops kill black people -> black people protest -> more police show up. How is it childish to recognize that progression?
779126188329533442 2016-09-22 01:12:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @Ben_Huh calling your opponent a child is not an argument.
779118812906057729 2016-09-22 00:42:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Protests have a cause. This police state brought to you by racist cops who get away with murder. https://twitter.com/Ben_Huh/status/779110897948188672
779109596581462032 2016-09-22 00:06:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Isn't this the kind of scene you right wing idiots are stockpiling weapons against? #CharlotteRiots #CharlotteProtestpic.twitter.com/q2VitZFKrv

778795163644596225 2016-09-21 03:16:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob I live in NC. I'm only and hour from Charlotte and go there all the time. This is surreal.
778794731207700480 2016-09-21 03:15:07 UTC <FaithNaff> "Looting and rioting won't help your case" means nothing when you get just as mad when their protest is just sitting down. #blacklivesmatter
778755998731427840 2016-09-21 00:41:13 UTC <FaithNaff> THEM: "I was spanked as a kid and I turned out just fine."  ME: "No, you turned out as an adult who thinks it's okay to hit children."
778407215623393280 2016-09-20 01:35:16 UTC <FaithNaff> Unarmed black man in Charlotte shot by police while sittingin his car reading. Racism in my own neighborhood. #blacklivesmatter

778242694820814848 2016-09-20 14:41:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @oxygen Just watched first episode of "Strut" on @Oxygen. It's pretty good. I should have a review up on http://www.the4gshow.wordpress.com Thursday.
777893845618929664 2016-09-19 15:35:20 UTC <FaithNaff> Remember the good old days when a Republican candidate could tank their chances just by saying "binders full of women"?

776098277607473152 2016-09-14 16:40:23 UTC <FaithNaff> If you automatically equate kneeling for the Anthem with protesting the military then you admit you only think of America as a war machine.
776075401974210561 2016-09-14 15:09:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Is the Alt Right basically the final form of the Tea Party?
775887999309668352 2016-09-13 02:44:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob doesn't change the fact it casts a negative light on the already maligned transgender comminity.
775887464795897856 2016-09-13 02:42:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @NotSureWhatYou and when did that happen?
775887309736644609 2016-09-13 02:42:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @MRodOfficial more garbage media to make real transgender people look like sick freaks. I'm so sick if this shit.
775799367009759232 2016-09-13 20:52:37 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC multi billion dollar businesses and 60% of NC voters aren't wrong. YOU'RE wrong! Enjoy your last few months as governor.
775798934405087232 2016-09-13 20:50:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @NotSureWhatYou and you're quoting...?
775780639794749440 2016-09-13 19:38:12 UTC <FaithNaff> No one who's ever demanded a black person stand up has been on the right side of history. #BlackLivesMatter
775708914541363200 2016-09-13 14:53:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @transtoaster and said criticism highlights the fact that they're not listening.
775697110310215680 2016-09-13 14:06:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @transtoaster I hear a lot more of "how dare you sit for the Anthem" than "tell me about why you're protesting".
775696565017145344 2016-09-13 14:04:07 UTC <FaithNaff> White people are proud their ancestors fought a war over a tax increase, but #BlackLivesMatter protesting murders by cops is acting extreme.
775695834616922112 2016-09-13 14:01:13 UTC <FaithNaff> I can't think of a more peaceful protest than sitting down when asked to stand, yet you won't even let them have that. #BlackLivesMatter

774431020539969536 2016-09-09 02:15:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @jakebible already planning to. :)
774359337036812288 2016-09-09 21:30:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @jakebible "Doxen" sounds like the name of a bad ass male protagonist, so there's that.
774073528786227200 2016-09-08 02:34:45 UTC <FaithNaff> NOOOO!!!!! Don't let Cam be hurt! #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding
774073215924760576 2016-09-08 02:33:30 UTC <FaithNaff> Way to waste that interception, offense. #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding
774072600897159168 2016-09-08 02:31:04 UTC <FaithNaff> 3rd turnover! Gonna call the 40 yard line the "choke zone" for Denver from now on. #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding

774062345064710144 2016-09-08 01:50:19 UTC <FaithNaff> Were the Broncos fans chanting "Super Bowl" after the Panther's TD? Because that's not tacky and childish. #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding

774059393843359745 2016-09-08 01:38:35 UTC <FaithNaff> Still pissed that jumping up and down is unsportsmanlike but shoving Cam isn't. #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding

774049218080022528 2016-09-08 00:58:09 UTC <FaithNaff> Carolina, why have you burned 2 timeouts on your first drive of the fucking game?! #PantherVsBroncos #KeepPounding
774047258534903808 2016-09-08 00:50:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Alright Cam. Let's do this! #PantherVsBroncos

773991699785932800 2016-09-08 21:09:35 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm worried about the new @oxygen show "Strut". This blog post explains why. #transgender #LGBT #transisbeautiful https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/the-stumbles-of-strut/
773946368616337408 2016-09-08 18:09:28 UTC <FaithNaff> A blog post about Strut on Oxygen is coming tonight. I'm not mean to it, but I don't praise it either.
773863943496470528 2016-09-08 12:41:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Thank you, Apple, for a tech reveal that reminds me why I don't buy any of your shit.

771382493459189761 2016-09-01 16:21:32 UTC <FaithNaff> @huffpostqueer they tried to have the conversation BEFORE you fucked up. Too late now. Boycotting this movie.
771381669152583680 2016-09-01 16:18:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz you are still loved and an inspiration to me. <3
771381137361035264 2016-09-01 16:16:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @MarkRuffalo @SmartAssJen This isn't a conversation. It's a boycott. You knew better and chose to do the wrong thing. Too late now.

770978917205348352 2016-08-31 13:37:52 UTC <FaithNaff> Seriously, did Hollywood learn nothing from the failure of Stonewall? WE WILL NOT SEE THIS! @MarkRuffalo @MattBomer #Anything #LGBT #trans
770977935167741952 2016-08-31 13:33:58 UTC <FaithNaff> @Variety @MarkRuffalo Will boycott. Cast actual trans people to play trans parts. Otherwise it's just blackface.
770977490479308801 2016-08-31 13:32:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @MattBomer @MsJamieClayton @Muh_Sadam That would be a valid argument if trans people playing themselves wasn't so incredibly rare.

770738965066416128 2016-08-30 21:44:23 UTC <FaithNaff> Here's why cis playing trans is never okay. Looking at you @MarkRuffalo and @MattBomer #transgender #LGBT https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/trans-face-exploiting-transgender-characters/
770025636975050752 2016-08-28 22:29:52 UTC <FaithNaff> White people: "#BlackLivesMatter anger is unjustified."  Also white people: "SOMEONE DIDN'T STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?! RAWR!"
769559343742148608 2016-08-27 15:36:59 UTC <FaithNaff> No, GOP, THIS is what using death for political gain looks like. Just sickening. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/769526017887080449
768994217444118529 2016-08-25 02:11:23 UTC <FaithNaff> One person should not have the power to make you doubt everything about yourself when you've worked so hard to love who you've become.
768264242969579520 2016-08-23 01:50:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump If you look up hyperbolic in the dictionary, it just shows a picture of @realdonaldtrump.
768263046162702336 2016-08-23 01:45:58 UTC <FaithNaff> White guy commits rape. = "It's a little mistake. Think of his future!"  Black guy caught with pot. = "He's a thug! Lock him up for life!"
768148139941429248 2016-08-23 18:09:22 UTC <FaithNaff> FYI to the GOP, Obama is going to come get your guns and declare martial law about the same time Jesus gets back. Just keep waiting.
768120472089362432 2016-08-23 16:19:26 UTC <FaithNaff> @YouTube Hey @Youtube, don't put political attack ads in front of videos obviously meant for children. My son doesn't need that. Sort that shit out.

764076934279995393 2016-08-12 12:31:51 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I'm jealous, but not resentful.  I put that energy into building a fan base with my blog and podcast to maybe follow your path.

763443985134260224 2016-08-10 18:36:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Ask Jim if he can come to Dragon Con now that he's not going to be in the UK in early September.
763213336066523136 2016-08-09 03:20:13 UTC <FaithNaff> @pastaslut @the_moviebob @DrJillStein what?
763192575536852993 2016-08-09 01:57:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Even if Trump doesn't win, we're not in the clear. Because we'll still be living in an America evil enough to let him get that close.
763189163529297920 2016-08-09 01:44:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @Danjitsu "I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture [of my food]" is a phrase that kinda perfectly represents this generation.

760844561321254912 2016-08-03 14:27:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @laurakbuzz you should come to America in September for Dragon Con!
760714445047926784 2016-08-02 05:50:31 UTC <FaithNaff> Is it just me or are we suddenly being bombarded with movies about killer social media? This shit is popping up all the time now.
760599122860802048 2016-08-02 22:12:16 UTC <FaithNaff> I think the real reason @realDonaldTrump kicked a baby out of his rally is because he can't stand not being the smartest person in the room.
760563701393096704 2016-08-02 19:51:31 UTC <FaithNaff> GOP: "We can make Trump as our nominee work. What could go wrong?"  Trump: *insults dead soldier within a week.*  GOP: "....well fuck..."
760561310920740868 2016-08-02 19:42:01 UTC <FaithNaff> If you think #feminism is anti men then you assume having all the power is an inherently male thing and that's kinda the whole problem.

758414735956119553 2016-07-27 21:32:18 UTC <FaithNaff> The one thing both Clinton and Trump have taught us is it's apparently impossible to do something that disqualifies you for candidacy.
758278584381222914 2016-07-27 12:31:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Every time I see footage of groups boycotting #DNCinPHL because Bernie didn't win, it's always all white people who look under 30.  Hmm....
758105314084458496 2016-07-26 01:02:46 UTC <FaithNaff> What's more valuable than Bernie Sanders in the Oval Office? Bernie Sanders in the heart of everyone in the Democrat Party. #Revolution
758097413026570240 2016-07-26 00:31:22 UTC <FaithNaff> The ENTIRE platform of the Democrat Party now reflects the ideals Bernie Sanders fought for.  You know what that's called?  Victory.
758088772672167936 2016-07-26 23:57:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie protestors: We're going to fight for Bernie by doing exactly what he's begging us not to do! Take that, establishment!
757990629217624064 2016-07-26 17:27:03 UTC <FaithNaff> The #RNCatCLE  had a stage full of spoiled, entitled, privileged children. The #DNCinPHL  has an audience full of the same.
757953516048490496 2016-07-26 14:59:34 UTC <FaithNaff> If you're still #BernieOrBust, congrats on your white, cis, straight, Christian life. The rest of us have something to lose. #ImWithHer
757716473003569152 2016-07-25 23:17:39 UTC <FaithNaff> #BernieOrBust people, listen to the words of he whom we have trusted! GROW UP AND STAND UP AGAINST TRUMP!https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/757707676583391232
757711818055974912 2016-07-25 22:59:09 UTC <FaithNaff> The #RNC had a stage full of spoiled, entitled, privileged children. The #DemsinPhilly has an audience full of the same.
757600539995697152 2016-07-25 15:36:58 UTC <FaithNaff> Libertarianism is just Diet Republican.
757595516754661376 2016-07-25 15:17:01 UTC <FaithNaff> "This weather is arm-pit soup!" -@mmmdraco
757566460600483840 2016-07-25 13:21:33 UTC <FaithNaff> We've reached a point where the ONLY way to process mass murder is desensitization. We scroll past shooting news now like a weather forcast.
757565602533957633 2016-07-25 13:18:09 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco children murdered in school wasn't enough, so it seems nothing ever will be.
757323476399165440 2016-07-24 21:16:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenSanders resend endorsement of @HillaryClinton and demand delegates get to vote their conscious. We've proved the election was rigged.
757321777148231680 2016-07-24 21:09:16 UTC <FaithNaff> All delegates should be allowed to vote their conscious at the #DNCinPHL. Shultz resigning as chair PROVES the election was rigged.
757321146928885764 2016-07-24 21:06:46 UTC <FaithNaff> That moment when the DNC chair resigns in disgrace but HRC already has a new gig lined up for her. #corruptionhttps://twitter.com/mmmdraco/status/757320901058826241
757318647568338944 2016-07-24 20:56:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @KaterineMacFie I went to check it because it was showing 0 listens and then quickly figured out why.
757317994964025344 2016-07-24 20:54:14 UTC <FaithNaff> @KaterineMacFie Why didn't anyone tell me the last upload didn't work?! :P
757317571251171329 2016-07-24 20:52:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @GeorgeTakei And that's exactly why she's so out of touch with the transgender community. She will never represent me.
757317267076030465 2016-07-24 20:51:21 UTC <FaithNaff> Good, but this needed to happen months ago.https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/757311164959322113
757316960128475136 2016-07-24 20:50:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Okay, after technical difficulties, HERE is the new episode of the 4G Show Podcast. #LGBT #Pokemon #transgenderhttp://gaygeekgirlsgossip.podomatic.com/entry/2016-07-23T06_30_06-07_00
757298485804883968 2016-07-24 19:36:43 UTC <FaithNaff> Today has been very frustrating.
757281264806363136 2016-07-24 18:28:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Also, @HillaryClinton, just admit you've done some shady shit. If you at least own up to it, you might get some to give you a second chance.
757280360623403008 2016-07-24 18:24:42 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @HillaryClinton, stop telling us why we can't trust @realDonaldTrump and tell us why we CAN trust YOU! That's what we need to hear!
756960724300226560 2016-07-23 21:14:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I've always been bi but preferred female. 3 months on HRT and I feel that shifting towards the other way.
756845800504909824 2016-07-23 13:37:55 UTC <FaithNaff> Tig and I discuss #PokemonGO, Emmy nominations, and bad sunburns in the new podcast. Have a listen! http://gaygeekgirlsgossip.podomatic.com/entry/2016-07-23T06_30_06-07_00
756332667440885760 2016-07-21 03:38:54 UTC <FaithNaff> I really hope the Dems don't spend their whole convention just talking about how scary Trump is.
756146393702686720 2016-07-21 15:18:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @HillaryClinton, we already know not to vote for @realDonaldTrump. We need more about why we should vote for you.
755972654109171713 2016-07-20 03:48:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @femfreq what was wrong with Infinite? I loved that game.
755768390342549504 2016-07-20 14:16:40 UTC <FaithNaff> @Lesdoggg Don't know if you'll see this, but your movie was amazing and you were awesome in it! Truly a star is born!
755459870518874112 2016-07-19 17:50:43 UTC <FaithNaff> How life feels right now.  Step 1: Try really hard. Step 2: Fail  Repeat until dead.
755397965922103297 2016-07-19 13:44:44 UTC <FaithNaff> I think @HillaryClinton might need to hide her old First Lady speeches with her Wall Street ones. Mrs. Trump is looking for new material.
755159978948820993 2016-07-18 21:59:03 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz hope I'm not pestering, but did you get the book I sent you?
754776902771019776 2016-07-17 20:36:51 UTC <FaithNaff> What's the opposite of an #SJW? Find out in my new blog post! #socialjustice https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/07/17/those-darn-pdes/
754747697983328256 2016-07-17 18:40:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Recording happening in just a few minutes. If you have a question you want us to answer on the show, there's still time to send it in.
754724984577286144 2016-07-17 17:10:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz thanks. I'm still at least a year out, but never to early to start thinking.
754695475887046656 2016-07-17 15:13:17 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz okay. Was curious how I would eventually work around that not working from home.
754687449251586048 2016-07-17 14:41:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Do you mind me asking how long a session of that takes?
754687169860669440 2016-07-17 14:40:17 UTC <FaithNaff> Breast growth has reached, 'they hurt when I run'. #Transgender #Transition #MTF
754489006600192001 2016-07-16 01:32:51 UTC <FaithNaff> I can't take a truck into the bank, or theater, or nightclub, etc.
754481511475384320 2016-07-16 01:03:04 UTC <FaithNaff> Mass shootings this year: 28,973 Mass killings with a truck this year: 1  Your "you don't need a gun" argument rings hollow. #GunControlNow

754425800116563969 2016-07-16 21:21:41 UTC <FaithNaff> I just saw someone making a phone call with their #PokemonGO catcher! What a time to be alive!
754381494957793280 2016-07-16 18:25:38 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz not going to make the boys suffer anymore? :P
753089051306123264 2016-07-12 04:49:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Oh, upper lip is TORTURE!
753088750050222080 2016-07-12 04:48:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Let's be glad they didn't make Zelda Go. I don't need kids wandering into my house and breaking all my pots. #PokemonGo

752923621987717120 2016-07-12 17:52:34 UTC <FaithNaff> How I look right after a laser hair removal treatment. #transition #transisbeautiful #MTF #ILookLikeDeadpoolpic.twitter.com/pjx7NR5cE3
752698869486645248 2016-07-11 02:59:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Police cam footage is supposed to protect the public, @PatMcCroryNC. You absolutely don't give a fuck about the people of this state.
752661462863183872 2016-07-11 00:30:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Here are my thoughts on #PokemonGo, and though this comes from a long time fan, they're not positive. https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/pokemon-goes-too-far/
752146642418147328 2016-07-10 14:25:08 UTC <FaithNaff> My partner commenting on my hormone progress: "your boobies are definitely getting boobie shapped". #transition #MTF
751880836396486656 2016-07-09 20:48:55 UTC <FaithNaff> Seriously, some sicko could download #PokemonGO and have a detailed map of places kids might walk by while completely distracted.
751880418815868928 2016-07-09 20:47:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Just thought of how the stops in #PokemonGO let people know empty places where neighborhood kids might walk alone and that's terrifying.
751790349782310912 2016-07-09 14:49:21 UTC <FaithNaff> @ribnose I treat every interaction as though they already know. It lessens that sting for me.
751789941710028800 2016-07-09 14:47:44 UTC <FaithNaff> I think you're very pretty. :) <3
751789558459686912 2016-07-09 14:46:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Episode 2 is here! We talk about #TorontoPride and #blacklivesmatter, as well as the harm in #heterosexualprideday.http://gaygeekgirlsgossip.podomatic.com/entry/2016-07-08T21_00_12-07_00
751444381425623040 2016-07-08 15:54:36 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I've been on HRT for 2 months now and I kow how you feel. Everything makes me tear up now.
751411861803900928 2016-07-08 13:45:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @OhMiaGod @LaurakBuzz America has that cranked up to 11.
751264404763586561 2016-07-07 03:59:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Everywhere I turn now it's just death and hatred...
751197562930094080 2016-07-07 23:33:50 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm searching in #PokemonGo for the rarest catch of all... a working server.
751181610041634818 2016-07-07 22:30:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Caught a bulbasaur in @mmmdraco 's closet. Was wondering what had been banging around in there all this time. #PokemonGo
751174522972336128 2016-07-07 22:02:17 UTC <FaithNaff> This has been my entire #PokemonGo experience so far.pic.twitter.com/CHabVNvIHi
751171164471517184 2016-07-07 21:48:56 UTC <FaithNaff> My experience with #PokemonGo so far has just been creating an avatar and then having the server crash.
751169559185485824 2016-07-07 21:42:33 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco You're the shoe whisperer.  Their soles speak to you... :P
751166945471426560 2016-07-07 21:32:10 UTC <FaithNaff> It seems America finds a black man selling CD's more dangerous than a suspected terrorist on the no fly list.
750975395906936832 2016-07-07 08:51:01 UTC <FaithNaff> My body tempreture continues to confound my partner. :Phttps://twitter.com/mmmdraco/status/750901488315236352
750974821991870464 2016-07-07 08:48:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Downloaded #PokemonGo last night. Hoping one day the world slows down enough for me to try playing it.
750858963592372224 2016-07-06 01:08:21 UTC <FaithNaff> GOP reminds us the founders went to war over high taxes but somehow #blacklivesmatter unrest over getting murdered by cops is uncalled for.
750764386667626496 2016-07-06 18:52:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Today the universe has been systematically designed to kill my dreams.
750526961823453185 2016-07-05 03:09:06 UTC <FaithNaff> Welcome to #Ubisoft, where we can't even program a survey to be inclusive of women.http://boingboing.net/2016/07/05/ubisofts-gamer-survey-first.html
750521193334206464 2016-07-05 02:46:11 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound so fucking done. It's embarrassing. We get to pick between a crook and a con man.
750101080445427713 2016-07-04 22:56:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Thank you, @Walmart for a not so subtle reminder that warfare is basically what America is all about.pic.twitter.com/9qi0oiiiOx
750081843865714688 2016-07-04 21:40:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @Mets, let's not let Harvey start anymore. Okay? This is now a pattern.
750080684379762690 2016-07-04 21:35:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Gender neutral bathrooms are not the answer for #transgender people. I explain in today's blog post. #LGBT #HB2 #NC https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/neutral-bathrooms-the-right-solution-to-the-wrong-problem/
750016542939680768 2016-07-04 17:20:53 UTC <FaithNaff> My blog post this #independenceday about the #freedom of #transgender people to use the restroom. #wejustneedtopee https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/neutral-bathrooms-the-right-solution-to-the-wrong-problem/
749983462564782080 2016-07-04 15:09:26 UTC <FaithNaff> It's still illegal for me to pee in my state, so I will not be celebrating #IndependenceDay.
749982932941561856 2016-07-04 15:07:19 UTC <FaithNaff> Happy White Cis Straight Male Freedom Day
749648009974181888 2016-07-03 16:56:28 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I hope the package I sent you arrived by now.

749464031430316032 2016-07-02 04:45:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob Looks like they took it down.
749463403295543296 2016-07-02 04:42:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz At least your parents are supportive.
749355313674018816 2016-07-02 21:33:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @ggreenwald @TheLOTDreport @the_moviebob @CarlBeijer I stand with Bob. I've got a lot of respect for his work and progressivism.
749354562830696448 2016-07-02 21:30:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob @TheLOTDreport @ggreenwald @CarlBeijer punish LGBT? I'm trans and have followed Bob's work for years. He's been a great ally.
749239367311454208 2016-07-02 13:52:40 UTC <FaithNaff> "PPl r free to do what they want," and general name calling seem to be the only rebuttals anyone can conjure up to my post.
749238155446976516 2016-07-02 13:47:51 UTC <FaithNaff> My post about #HeterosexualPrideDay seems to have given someone a booboo on their feelings. Have recieved several angry tweets from them.
749087427751391233 2016-07-01 03:48:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz It's certainly helped me get a glimpse of a potential future if I choose to get SRS. Your Tweets have been invaluable to me.
749086649280147456 2016-07-01 03:45:49 UTC <FaithNaff> Question is: will he actually read the blog post?https://twitter.com/C_Bartlett_/status/748935103867392000
749085851020173312 2016-07-01 03:42:38 UTC <FaithNaff> Here's my post on everything that's wrong with #HeterosexualPrideDay. https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/heterosexual-pride-day-is-harmful/
748927600089759744 2016-07-01 17:13:48 UTC <FaithNaff> This is brilliant.https://twitter.com/the_moviebob/status/748738902744182789
748927254890176513 2016-07-01 17:12:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Blog post about the ridiculous #HeterosexualPrideDay going up soon. I didn't say nice things.
748588794119622657 2016-06-30 18:47:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz oh, Celsius. For a moment there I thought you were dead.
748002050391285761 2016-06-28 03:56:00 UTC <FaithNaff> "You must issue marriage licenses regardless of faith." "Christian persecution!" "It's also illegal to feed the poor and homeless." "So?"
747876888249536512 2016-06-28 19:38:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @NBA don't take any new version of #HB2 from #NorthCarolina. No repeal, no game!

747819530550976514 2016-06-28 15:50:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco how dare you.
747583798490071040 2016-06-27 00:14:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @jbouie @the_moviebob I love Warren, but picking her as VP would tank Clinton's chances. Too many sound bites of criticism of her.
747583052356943872 2016-06-27 00:11:03 UTC <FaithNaff> I bet this week a lot of Americans marked out England on their list of places to move if Trump gets elected.
747575798316568576 2016-06-27 23:42:14 UTC <FaithNaff> New blog post about geeks complaining about "political stuff". I'm sure it won't piss anyone off...nah... https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/06/27/getting-political-but-not-really/
747570051688062978 2016-06-27 23:19:24 UTC <FaithNaff> "Quite twirling, you twirly twirler!"  @mmmdraco yelling at a loading screen.
747297383302594560 2016-06-26 05:15:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Not saying don't be cautious or trust just anyone, but we've not reached a point where we can be THIS picky about our allies.
747297038765694976 2016-06-26 05:14:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Obama spoke AGAINST gay marriage when he first ran for president and we voted for him in droves. Where was all this sanctimonious shit then?
747296355832340480 2016-06-26 05:11:49 UTC <FaithNaff> A leader who came around to the cause is best equipped to know how to turn other hearts. "I used to think that way too" is a powerful thing.
747295866608721921 2016-06-26 05:09:53 UTC <FaithNaff> If we never forgave anyone who was originally against gay marriage we'd never have gotten anywhere.
747295270539427840 2016-06-26 05:07:31 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm no fan of HRC but if you're going to hate her do it for a good fucking reason. Don't shame someone for seeing the light we showed her.
747294729579094017 2016-06-26 05:05:22 UTC <FaithNaff> Yes, HRC was anti marriage equality. So was Obama and we've seen great advancements with him. He lit the WH rainbow for Christ's sake.
747294325407506432 2016-06-26 05:03:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Apparently we think it's awesome when people are enlightened about LGBT issues unless you're @HillaryClinton.
747294006212628485 2016-06-26 05:02:29 UTC <FaithNaff> @JordanChariton @danmericaCNN @NYGovCuomo @BilldeBlasio @Chirlane Isn't winning hearts to the cause the whole goddamn point? Why's this bad?

747128557823008770 2016-06-26 18:05:03 UTC <FaithNaff> I've got a lot to say today. Check out my new blog post. #GayMarriage #Pride2016 #LoveWins https://the4gshow.wordpress.com/2016/06/26/one-year-of-gay-marriage-and-the-fight-ahead/
747071070285533184 2016-06-26 14:16:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Happy anniversary, #GayMarriage.
746821799518801920 2016-06-25 21:46:06 UTC <FaithNaff> Torn between wanting to clean house because I'm sick of the mess and not wanting to move because it's so damn hot.
746756860557033472 2016-06-25 17:28:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Thank you SO MUCH for live tweeting this experience. Other trans women like me appreciate it very much.
746756137538695168 2016-06-25 17:25:11 UTC <FaithNaff> The first episode of my new podcast, the 4G Show, is up now! http://gaygeekgirlsgossip.podomatic.com/entry/2016-06-25T09_42_53-07_00
746711151665373184 2016-06-25 14:26:26 UTC <FaithNaff> Sending a big congrats to @LaurakBuzz for her gender confirmation surgery! So happy for you!
746535659779854337 2016-06-24 02:49:05 UTC <FaithNaff> You don't know rage until a computer glitch wipes an hour's worth of your podcast recording at 10:30pm.

746351283167182848 2016-06-24 14:36:27 UTC <FaithNaff> It's really weird seeing a country turn into an absolute cluster-fuck and for once it's not your own. http://www.itv.com/news/2016-06-24/david-cameron-to-resign-as-prime-minister-after-eu-referendum/

746213251332005888 2016-06-23 05:27:57 UTC <FaithNaff> The UK just proved America's xenophobic, exclusionary, racist, immigrant-hating apple didn't fall far from the tree. #UKDecides #EUref
746203820321996800 2016-06-23 04:50:29 UTC <FaithNaff> The UK just out-dumbassed America. How is that possible?! #UKreferendum
745823365869506560 2016-06-22 03:38:41 UTC <FaithNaff> So proud of @SenateDems. This is what representing the people looks like. #NoBillNoBreak #OccupyCongress
745822136548352001 2016-06-22 03:33:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenateDems, I love that you're standing up like this, I'm furious it didn't come after #SandyHook. #NoBillNoBreak #OccupyCongress
745820447263047680 2016-06-22 03:27:05 UTC <FaithNaff> Watching as @SenateDems earn their reelection this year #NoBillNoBreak #OccupyCongress
745818970306019328 2016-06-22 03:21:13 UTC <FaithNaff> Go Senate Democrats! Hold the floor! Don't back down! #OccupyCongress
745460640752480256 2016-06-21 03:37:21 UTC <FaithNaff> Going to bed. Big announcement tomorrow on my Facebook page. http://facebook.com/faithnaff
745452057658691584 2016-06-21 03:03:15 UTC <FaithNaff> #LGBT in Fandom panel from #ConCarolinas now on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf0tMkZgkqI&feature=youtu.be
745274479543222272 2016-06-21 15:17:37 UTC <FaithNaff> When the next shooting starts, we'll see today as the time we could have saved their lives, but there was no profit in it. #GunControlNow
745268317296992256 2016-06-21 14:53:07 UTC <FaithNaff> Don't know why the GOP wants to blame shootings on mental health. It's just another issue they're doing fuck all about. #GunControlNow
745069243759214592 2016-06-20 01:42:05 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenThomTillis You are an unfathomable embarrassment on NC. November can't get here fast enough. We need you GONE!
745069016046264322 2016-06-20 01:41:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenatorBurr You are an unfathomable embarrassment for NC. November can't get here fast enough. We need you GONE!
745031661566435332 2016-06-20 23:12:44 UTC <FaithNaff> @SenateGOP You are all vile filth and the blood from the next mass shooting is on your hands.
745031030046859264 2016-06-20 23:10:14 UTC <FaithNaff> We shouldn't be surprised. These are the people who didn't bat an eye when little children were slaughtered at school. They aren't human.
745028773247062017 2016-06-20 23:01:16 UTC <FaithNaff> Tune into C-SPAN to watch white, straight, cis privilege in action. #senategunvotes
745028397923991552 2016-06-20 22:59:46 UTC <FaithNaff> The blood of the next mass shooting (probably tomorrow) is on the #GOP's hands. #senategunvotes
745028159167434752 2016-06-20 22:58:49 UTC <FaithNaff> I fear the #NRA and #GOP more than ISIS. ISIS carries out the attacks, but the GOP makes it all possible.
745027740634595328 2016-06-20 22:57:09 UTC <FaithNaff> When you can't even pass an amendment to ban suspected terrorists from buying guns, you're officially aiding terrorism.#RepubsAreTerrorists
745027471251283968 2016-06-20 22:56:05 UTC <FaithNaff> ALERT: #GOP votes to let more innocent people be shot.
745009169804234752 2016-06-20 21:43:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @eliakeefe thank you. I really needed to hear something like that. <3
744988735993950208 2016-06-20 20:22:10 UTC <FaithNaff> I just want one thing I work hard on to succeed. Just one goddamn thing...
744987906243170304 2016-06-20 20:18:52 UTC <FaithNaff> Breaking news! Most Americans know expensive toys not more important than human lives!https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/744986966580727808
744987651846062080 2016-06-20 20:17:52 UTC <FaithNaff> When you pray for the victims of a terror attack, you're calling on the same god they were killed in the name of. Different book, same guy.
744987268612562944 2016-06-20 20:16:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob Fun fact! The god they pray to to help the victims is the same one the terrorist killed them in the name of to begin with.
744984069780422656 2016-06-20 20:03:38 UTC <FaithNaff> Basically, rejection sucks, makes you feel like your work is shit, and makes sure "give up" is the only thought running through your head.
744983662488391680 2016-06-20 20:02:00 UTC <FaithNaff> I've mostly spared Twitter from the crippling depression I've had the last 2 days. Facebook wasn't as fortunate.
744649559918395392 2016-06-19 21:54:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Took a nap. Awoke to a 6-0 loss by the @Mets against the Braves. This can't be real, right?
744647288249815045 2016-06-19 21:45:23 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz your transtweets have been a big deal to me. It's relieving to see into the mind of another t-girl way closer to SRS than me.
744599175589928960 2016-06-19 18:34:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Holy crap. This is terrible. http://m.tmz.com/#article/2016/06/19/star-trek-anton-yelchin-dead/
744576056733085697 2016-06-19 17:02:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz The results are in! It is, indeed, blood. Hope that helps. :P
744573963909619713 2016-06-19 16:54:01 UTC <FaithNaff> A lot of strange feelings today on #fathersday, what with my relationship with my dad and my being a parent in transition.
744573536631676928 2016-06-19 16:52:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound what's the best way to email you?
744366272155095040 2016-06-18 03:08:43 UTC <FaithNaff> @amazon @JimMacAuth @emilytwolf PLEEEEEEEEAAAASE review! :) hope you enjoy!
744241442848182273 2016-06-18 18:52:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I hope the gift I sent you gets there at a good time.
743447639421755392 2016-06-16 14:18:24 UTC <FaithNaff> The GOP thinking that Democrats use tragedy like #PulseShooting to further an agenda is them assuming the other side thinks like they do.
743273672396378112 2016-06-15 02:47:07 UTC <FaithNaff> The @SenateDems have had enough. Thank you for taking action! We're with you! #holdthefloor #filibuster
743266826621231104 2016-06-15 02:19:55 UTC <FaithNaff> When you only offer prayer, you offer nothing. Change only comes from those willing to open their eyes and get off their knees.
743103100114862081 2016-06-15 15:29:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Does @miracleofsound have any music genres he feels he could never write in?
743102634945597440 2016-06-15 15:27:29 UTC <FaithNaff> This needed to be EXPLAINED?!https://twitter.com/ELLEmagazine/status/743102398902734848
743056097003634688 2016-06-15 12:22:33 UTC <FaithNaff> 2 months on hormones has turned me into that girl that cries over everything. #Transgender #Transition #mtfpride

742421973607829504 2016-06-13 18:22:46 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @the_moviebob, LOVE the new series! I've really been missing my "The Big Picture" fix! Keep up the good work!
742421326711918592 2016-06-13 18:20:12 UTC <FaithNaff> Banning assault rifles won't help! The Boston guy used a bomb!  Sounds like... Global warming isn't real. I saw a snow flake yesterday!
742179796994654208 2016-06-12 02:20:27 UTC <FaithNaff> If you still think America is the greatest country in the world then you are unbelievably out of touch with reality.
742176548078374912 2016-06-12 02:07:32 UTC <FaithNaff> Forget "Make America Great Again". I'm ready for "Make America Not An Embarrassment Again".
742118416014794756 2016-06-12 22:16:32 UTC <FaithNaff> GOP lawmakers praying for #PulseShooting victims are basically telling ISIS they can't attack gay people because that's their job.
742111002548940806 2016-06-12 21:47:05 UTC <FaithNaff> Now I understand why the #GOP wants to destroy #ISIS: they're taking out the compitition.#PulseNightclub #OrlandoShooting
742099654314217472 2016-06-12 21:01:59 UTC <FaithNaff> "Can these minority groups quit getting shot already so we don't have to worry about losing our assault weapons?" --Republicans
742089420057288704 2016-06-12 20:21:19 UTC <FaithNaff> As we all cling to our loved ones as though we may never see them again, gun nuts are clinging to their assault rifles for the same reason.
742060749019832321 2016-06-12 18:27:24 UTC <FaithNaff> When the #Orlando shooting was happening, I was safely driving home from my local gay bar. That's really hard to think about.
742060274417553408 2016-06-12 18:25:30 UTC <FaithNaff> Absolutely numb over the #Orlando shooting. My heart goes out to the LGBT community there. It's so unthinkable.
741452768049778689 2016-06-10 02:11:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @LauraKBuzz if I wanted to send you something where would I mail it to?

741055126065033216 2016-06-09 23:51:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound We were clearly too stupid to know what we had.
740961839308230656 2016-06-09 17:40:43 UTC <FaithNaff> It seems #BrockTheRapist wrote a letter to the judge. I'll read it later. I don't have time to go into a table-smashing rage right now.
740953693298798592 2016-06-09 17:08:21 UTC <FaithNaff> What do the Bible and Constitution have in common? The #GOP thinks they're both words to live by except the parts they don't like.
740953324556591104 2016-06-09 17:06:53 UTC <FaithNaff> Just a friendly reminder that the Senate STILL isn't doing their job and giving Obama's justice pick a hearing...85 days later. #DoYourJob
740716741911826432 2016-06-08 01:26:47 UTC <FaithNaff> My new sounds: Female Representation in Nerd Culture Panel - Con Carolinas 2016 https://soundcloud.com/faith-naff/female-representation-in-nerd-culture-panel-con-carolinas-2016 on #SoundCloud
740652915589799937 2016-06-08 21:13:10 UTC <FaithNaff> The way #KingdomHearts numbers games, you'd think they were OS software upgrades instead of sequels.
740652692486402048 2016-06-08 21:12:17 UTC <FaithNaff> What loon at SquareEnix or Disney signed off on the numbering system for #KingdomHearts?
740565422177718273 2016-06-08 15:25:30 UTC <FaithNaff> @HillaryClinton Can we get some mention of transgender women in the next video please?
740564630955786240 2016-06-08 15:22:21 UTC <FaithNaff> 2 things crossed off my to-do list. That earns me more coffee.
740541652524249088 2016-06-08 13:51:03 UTC <FaithNaff> I won't get to cast my vote for president this year so much as pay it as ransom. Give it to #HillaryClinton or the #Trump destroys America.
740412365859065856 2016-06-07 05:17:18 UTC <FaithNaff> That's like protesting a new mall that gets built anyway and being told to take that energy and apply it to getting good deals on jeans.
740411945535295489 2016-06-07 05:15:38 UTC <FaithNaff> People saying Bernie supporters need to take our revolution and throw it behind Hillary now completely miss what it's all about.
740411487601217536 2016-06-07 05:13:49 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm not emotionally ready to feel dead inside about this election cycle.
740407216373649413 2016-06-07 04:56:51 UTC <FaithNaff> I know a lot of people online who are big @HillaryClinton fans. I really hope I somehow see what you see between now and November.
740406902400679936 2016-06-07 04:55:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Bush Clinton Clinton Bush Bush Obama Obama Clinton  That's potentially about to represent 32 years of POTUS last names.
740406092426051584 2016-06-07 04:52:23 UTC <FaithNaff> I feel sick. I have to vote for a Dem I don't trust just to keep a lunatic out of the White House.
740310047369072641 2016-06-07 22:30:44 UTC <FaithNaff> Maybe we were too hard on Hitler. We probably ruined his bright future as a great painter. #StanfordSurvivor #BrockIsARapist
740168048359952384 2016-06-07 13:06:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Remember that the #LGBT in Fandom panel from #ConCarolinas 2016 is available to listen to on SoundCloud.https://soundcloud.com/faith-naff/lgbt-in-fandom-panel-con-carolinas-2016
740160511573135360 2016-06-07 12:36:32 UTC <FaithNaff> You could teach a semester-long class on white cis-male privilege just using the #StanfordRapeCase and everything surrounding it.
740153190277120001 2016-06-07 12:07:26 UTC <FaithNaff> The "why are you a #feminist," question can now be depressingly summed up with "literally every aspect of the #StanfordRape case".
739625582003138561 2016-06-05 01:10:54 UTC <FaithNaff> @TraciLoudin What's your blog?

737395564996878336 2016-05-30 21:29:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Wondering when the "you're sad about a dead gorilla but not about tragedies x,y, and z" posts will start up.
737292089436803072 2016-05-30 14:38:27 UTC <FaithNaff> I get that the characters all represent their male counterparts, but if we were already breaking molds anyway..I don't know.. #ghostbusters
737291176202670080 2016-05-30 14:34:49 UTC <FaithNaff> Basically, it's lame that the three white girls  are all accomplished scientists while the black woman is "street smart". #Ghostbusters
737290696521076736 2016-05-30 14:32:54 UTC <FaithNaff> HOWEVER... I do feel the movie seems to have some problem with racial stereotypes. #Ghostbusters
737288014737625090 2016-05-30 14:22:15 UTC <FaithNaff> I know I'm late to the reaction party here but holy hell does the new #ghostbusters look freaking awesome!!!!
737135152845979648 2016-05-29 04:14:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound I edit my books over and over, PAY other people to do the same, and readers still keep telling me they catch errors.
736710956831670272 2016-05-28 00:09:14 UTC <FaithNaff> What the hell was that?! It was just a bad pitch! Screw that umpire and his ego. #Mets #ThatWasBS
736702759953661953 2016-05-28 23:36:39 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @Dodgers, Maeda is a freaking warrior! Hit in the hand with the ball and then right back on the mound?! Mad respect! #MetsVsDodgers
736694796291571712 2016-05-28 23:05:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound @LaurakBuzz @LauraKBuzz PLEASE tell me there are plans to animate @MiracleofSound 's Podquisition open!
736369246666653696 2016-05-27 01:31:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @realDonaldTrump What do you get when you cross @RealDonaldTrump & @HillaryClinton? Don't know, but it would be too scared to debate @BernieSanders.
736368233553514496 2016-05-27 01:27:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound I was listening in the car the first time and I can't believe I didn't run off the road. I was crying I was laughing so hard
736366509346443265 2016-05-27 01:20:31 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound I've lost count how many times I've re-listened to your Podquisition intro. SO FUNNY!
736321054348611584 2016-05-27 22:19:54 UTC <FaithNaff> So @realDonaldTrump won't even debate the oponent that likely won't win the nomination? And he thinks he can make it to November? #Coward
736018920168165377 2016-05-26 02:19:19 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz That actually moves me to tears. I'm so happy for you. :)
735645741583077376 2016-05-25 01:36:27 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz I can never get close enough with an electric. I'm happy that laser treatments are going well for me.
735540623223205888 2016-05-25 18:38:44 UTC <FaithNaff> I didn't think it was possible to have a server at a reataurant so overbearing that they induce a panic attack.  I was wrong.
735523985442672641 2016-05-25 17:32:38 UTC <FaithNaff> My new theory is Hydra is real and they've infiltrated @Marvel to sabotage it from within with terrible story ideas. #CaptainAmerica
735109925928570880 2016-05-24 14:07:18 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @PatMcCroryNC, we will not compromise with you on #HB2 because we do not negotiate with terrorists.
734928644720758786 2016-05-23 02:06:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco She is beauty... She is grace...

734516447536422912 2016-05-22 22:49:02 UTC <FaithNaff> So hey...um...fuck the @Padres. That's incredibly messed up.
734512321943511040 2016-05-22 22:32:38 UTC <FaithNaff> I don't care how much you disagree with someone on the internet. Don't send people death threats. Seriously, NOTHING justifies that.
734469977382739968 2016-05-22 19:44:23 UTC <FaithNaff> The man on the pulpit telling your kids to be afraid of me is the one they should really be afraid of.
734469402062655488 2016-05-22 19:42:05 UTC <FaithNaff> I've see 5 stories this MONTH about preachers molesting kids, but trans people (who've never hurt anyone) going to pee is our big crisis.
734468835160526849 2016-05-22 19:39:50 UTC <FaithNaff> @JimSterling while @LaurakBuzz is off the show, you should let Chip be co host, then just keep telling him to shut up whenever he talks.
734463340597108739 2016-05-22 19:18:00 UTC <FaithNaff> Cespedes be dodging bad pitches like... #Metspic.twitter.com/PvBsQ1VYBt
733508468062203905 2016-05-19 04:03:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Dafuq, Oklahoma?! Are Republicans just throwing up Hail Mary's since it's the last quarter and they're pretty sure they're going to lose?
732774982128918528 2016-05-17 03:29:04 UTC <FaithNaff> A society this adamant about bathrooms being segragated by gender is a society admitting it isn't actually civilized.
732411654026059776 2016-05-16 03:25:20 UTC <FaithNaff> I was just informed that the Nintendo 64 is 18 years old and I can feel myself turning into dust.
731896856234627072 2016-05-15 17:19:43 UTC <FaithNaff> I think Trump's nomination is the GOP saying, "Fuck it. We weren't going to win anyway. Might as well do something crazy."
731494726264868864 2016-05-14 14:41:47 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco dammit! You made me cry! :)
730729900714405888 2016-05-12 12:02:39 UTC <FaithNaff> @the_moviebob Further cementing that we'll never get another Scott Pilgrim vs The World. :(
730728461992624128 2016-05-12 11:56:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @Noahsyndergaard @Mets @mmmdraco You forgot to mention IN A ROW! #GoMets
730155079446188034 2016-05-10 21:58:31 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm determined to get #PatMcCROWy trending on here. Anyone wanna help me out? #WeAreNotThis #RepealHB2 #NC
729863344069480448 2016-05-09 02:39:16 UTC <FaithNaff> I think we should refer to @PatMcCroryNC as #PatCrow from now on.
729823252563034113 2016-05-09 23:59:57 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC did you hear the Attorney General speak today? I hope you were taking notes because that's how grownups handle things.
729705176752373760 2016-05-09 16:10:46 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC stop embarrassing our state trying to defend a bigoted law no one is enforcing anyway!
729704830189633536 2016-05-09 16:09:23 UTC <FaithNaff> Statistically, the ratio of effort spent on keeping #HB2 vs enforcing it is 100/0. #WeAreNotThis #FuckMcCrory
729470047245225984 2016-05-08 00:36:26 UTC <FaithNaff> My @BernieSanders sign was stolen, meaning a non-socialist felt justified taking something that wasn't theres.
728582932282093569 2016-05-06 13:51:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC stop gambling with our kid's futures and our educators livelyhoods! This level of disgraceful government is unfathomable!
728227352669528064 2016-05-05 14:18:25 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC you are not protecting our state. If anything, at this point, you are holding us hostage. #WeAreNotThis #RepealHB2
728021278775496704 2016-05-04 00:39:33 UTC <FaithNaff> For god sake, @PatMcCroryNC, #repealHB2 before you bakrupt our schools! Prove you ACTUALLY want to protect our kids!
725875646665232384 2016-04-28 02:33:34 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco wow...that sure takes me back.
725709514805252096 2016-04-28 15:33:26 UTC <FaithNaff> "Trans women in bathrooms are disruptive," say the men who insist on bringing their AK-47s to Denny's.
724381744489717760 2016-04-24 23:37:20 UTC <FaithNaff> @Andrewpitts I love it! May I have permission to use it?
723698968878829568 2016-04-22 02:24:14 UTC <FaithNaff> If you had to go one day without any of the services provided by minimum/low wage workers you would completely shut down.
723698548446007296 2016-04-22 02:22:34 UTC <FaithNaff> "These people want $15/hr to flip burgersr?" YES! Because they want to pay rent and have food! Stop being an elitist little shit!
723698244241510400 2016-04-22 02:21:21 UTC <FaithNaff> People who claim fast food workers deserve a slave wage because they messed up their order that one time need to kiss a speeding Buick.
723318135034634240 2016-04-21 01:10:56 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz How the TSA in America treats trans people is exactly why I try not to fly ever.
723104251682131968 2016-04-21 11:01:02 UTC <FaithNaff> Happy National Surprise Drug Test Day.  Please pee in this cup.
721881102726643712 2016-04-17 02:00:41 UTC <FaithNaff> They're making Bill and Ted 3. To frame how long it's been, they traveled through time in a phone booth.   Phone booth.  Ask your parents.
721761217820229635 2016-04-17 18:04:18 UTC <FaithNaff> @HillaryClinton charges $334,000 to sit with her at dinner. @SenSanders flies coach. Pretty much sums up which one really represents us.
721149784623562753 2016-04-15 01:34:41 UTC <FaithNaff> Someone explain to me how banning trans women from the bathroom keeps perverts out but banning guns from places doesn't prevent shootings.
720774741989199873 2016-04-14 00:44:24 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @newcivilrights I live in NC and HB2 is a goddamn embarrassment. We're pushing HARD to get it gone! #WeAreNotThis
720449516005126144 2016-04-13 03:12:04 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC get used to the pressure and the backlash, because it's not going away until HB2 is eradicated. #WeAreNotThis #RepealHB2
720447885301653504 2016-04-13 03:05:35 UTC <FaithNaff> Trans people aren't the problem, but rather a society that formed ignoring our existence and now doesn't know how to fit us in. #trans
720070923961954306 2016-04-12 02:07:41 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC trans people never bother anyone in the bathroom. HB2 solved nothing and only exists because of bigotry. #WeAreNotThis
720067430639407104 2016-04-12 01:53:48 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC don't think for a second this is over. We'll only push harder to undo all of this hurtful law.
720067166733774848 2016-04-12 01:52:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC until you undo all of HB2, you will never look like you stand for equailty. Trans people are people and we deserve respect.
718571374579687424 2016-04-08 22:49:00 UTC <FaithNaff> @PatMcCroryNC thanks to HB2, we're losing jobs by the thousands and we're a national embarrassment. You're a cancer on this state!
718551363643420672 2016-04-08 21:29:29 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm the evil, feminist, SJW your bros warned you about.
718457552774803457 2016-04-08 15:16:43 UTC <FaithNaff> I somehow managed to pull a muscle in my shoulder this morning by reaching for my phone. How is your day going?
717465791029972992 2016-04-05 21:35:49 UTC <FaithNaff> @miracleofsound I haven't played it, but I was very moved by the inclusion of a Trans character in Dragon Age. Wish we had A MTF playable.
717465232885608448 2016-04-05 21:33:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey @JimSterling, looks like now we both live in states with shit-tastic new anti-LGBT  laws.
716333203326439424 2016-04-02 18:35:19 UTC <FaithNaff> When you've got your outfit all planned out for the event, then your partner texts, "I bought you a new dress while I was out." @mmmdraco
716272573617717249 2016-04-02 14:34:23 UTC <FaithNaff> So biggots won't be going to see Disney movies with me anymore? I call that a win/win.https://twitter.com/huffpostqueer/status/715697712700735488
715661511218315265 2016-03-31 22:06:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Young people: how many scary, backwards, repressive laws need to be passed before you realize you don't get to "not care about politics"?
715500768409882624 2016-03-31 11:27:31 UTC <FaithNaff> What a difference 5 years makes. Happy Transgender Day of Visibility. #TDOV #transisbeautiful #translivesmatterpic.twitter.com/rJ9iOqcb4j

712656826349789184 2016-03-23 15:06:42 UTC <FaithNaff> Bathroom bills prove that nothing motivates the GOP to act like the threat of equality. #wejustneedtopee
712353413258977280 2016-03-22 19:01:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Mass murderers don't represent most gun owners, but we better monitor all Muslims after a terrorist attack. #GOPLogic

712310443558117377 2016-03-22 16:10:18 UTC <FaithNaff> All the things that make spring pretty are the results of nature having a massive orgy.  Feel the love. Happy spring.
711608223124627456 2016-03-20 17:39:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Spring at last! Bye bye, winter. You will NOT be missed!
711238872169107456 2016-03-19 17:12:15 UTC <FaithNaff> Happy for @LaurakBuzz, but sad too because it feels like the only way to be successful as a Trans person is to be at least somewhat famous.
710673527570038785 2016-03-17 03:45:47 UTC <FaithNaff> Next laser hair removal session is next week. Hoping to soon be confident enough for no-makeup selfies.
710227176575135744 2016-03-16 22:12:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Come on, GOP, you're still not going to consider Obama's nominee? He picked a white guy. You love those! #SCOTUSnominee
707994245320151040 2016-03-10 18:19:16 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz You don't owe anyone facial femininity. You're beautiful as you are.
707979181867466752 2016-03-10 17:19:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Just voted for the first time as my authentic self. Proud to cast that vote for @SenSanders #transisbeautifulpic.twitter.com/XnHOb3DvKP

706676360832544768 2016-03-06 03:02:28 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie clearly won this debate. Now let's go to CNN's coverage where they'll likely say exactly the opposite. #DemDebate
706675175786467328 2016-03-06 02:57:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton is getting a softball question because she's not been able to handle anything tough tonight. #DemDebate
706674932906905600 2016-03-06 02:56:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Let's see how Clinton does with a completely irrelevant question. #DemDebate
706673758900248577 2016-03-06 02:52:08 UTC <FaithNaff> Hillary knew the crowd would hate Trump, so she just bashed him instead of answering the question. #DemDebate
706672778993344513 2016-03-06 02:48:14 UTC <FaithNaff> "Obama should get to do his job! Republicans are stupid!" -Hillary's new tactic to win the crowd. #DemDebate
706672202423390210 2016-03-06 02:45:57 UTC <FaithNaff> Hillary can't get the crowd fighting Bernie so she's resorting to just saying whatever she knows the audience will like. #DemDebate
706671576230531072 2016-03-06 02:43:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton is so frustrated. I'm imagining a thought bubble over her head saying, "this wasn't supposed to be this hard!". #DemDebate
706670421857476608 2016-03-06 02:38:52 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie understands how a yes or no question works. #DemDebate
706670251296100352 2016-03-06 02:38:11 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton basically just said she doesn't support fracking when the people she's talking to don't support fracking. #DemDebate
706668641027301376 2016-03-06 02:31:47 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton: let's talk about fixing Detroit's schools with an "Education SWAT Team". That won't sound awful at all. #DemDebate
706668296742031360 2016-03-06 02:30:25 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton 5 minutes ago: stop bringing up the 90's  Clinton now: let's bring up something from the 90's.  #DemDebate
706664921279422465 2016-03-06 02:17:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie answers questions about his past looking at the audience. Hillary looks down at her podium. That says a lot. #DemDebate
706664572959195142 2016-03-06 02:15:38 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie seems to be the only one up there who can begin an answer with "this is what I will do." #DemDebate
706664080627638272 2016-03-06 02:13:40 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie mentions his work with #blacklivesmatter. That's big. #DemDebate
706663384847163392 2016-03-06 02:10:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Hillary, if you're going to ignore your question to answer your opponent's, it helps if you have a better answer than he did. #DemDebate
706662916397916160 2016-03-06 02:09:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton: That's a really good question...so I'm going to completely ignore it and answer Bernie's question. #DemDebate
706662638210654209 2016-03-06 02:07:56 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie: I went to jail fighting for equality. Does that answer your question? #DemDebate
706661624430526464 2016-03-06 02:03:55 UTC <FaithNaff> Thanks for talking a full 2 minutes, but you didn't answer my question...at all... #DemDebate
706661224310841344 2016-03-06 02:02:19 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton doesn't want to talk about the 90's because she was a completely different person then. #DemDebate
706660606384988160 2016-03-06 01:59:52 UTC <FaithNaff> Clinton has officially lost her cool and it's showing. #DemDebate
706659231894773760 2016-03-06 01:54:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie doesn't sugarcoat anything. He tells the truth, not just whatever you want to hear. #DemDebate
706658528539369472 2016-03-06 01:51:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Did she just say we have to try everything that works? That's the biggest non-answer I've ever heard. #DemDebate
706657899561484288 2016-03-06 01:49:06 UTC <FaithNaff> Equating healthcare access with afordability is like saying there's no hunger problem because the poor can buy food at the grocery store.
706657055134904321 2016-03-06 01:45:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Coverage and affordability are not the same thing. I'm covered by healthcare, but that doesn't mean it's not a financial strain. #DemDebate
706656815497547776 2016-03-06 01:44:48 UTC <FaithNaff> BTW, Bernie just won the primary in Maine.
706656575784615937 2016-03-06 01:43:51 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie might as well go home. Hillary is winning this debate for him. #DemDebate
706656457731743744 2016-03-06 01:43:23 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie's eyes went WIDE when Clinton said Boeing deserved all that money. #DemDebate
706655867152830465 2016-03-06 01:41:02 UTC <FaithNaff> "Here's the hard truth: Democrats aren't always right." That's what a leader sounds like! #DemDebate
706655046352703489 2016-03-06 01:37:46 UTC <FaithNaff> When Bernie calls out Clinton, she looks pissed. When she calls him out, he just laughs because he knows she's full of shit. #DemDebate
706654177863323648 2016-03-06 01:34:19 UTC <FaithNaff> Earth to Clinton: Obama is awesome, but he's not the second coming of Christ! Stop treating everything he did as perfect! #DemDebate
706653671317184512 2016-03-06 01:32:18 UTC <FaithNaff> I swear to god, it sounds like Clinton's first act as POTUS would be to call Obama and ask, "what do I do now?" #DemDebate
706653072534183937 2016-03-06 01:29:56 UTC <FaithNaff> The gloves are off tonight! #DemDebate
706652457586319361 2016-03-06 01:27:29 UTC <FaithNaff> Sit down Hillary. Grownups are talking. #DemDebate
706651895826411520 2016-03-06 01:25:15 UTC <FaithNaff> BOOM! Bernie with a truth bomb dropped on Clinton! #DemDebate
706651228676161536 2016-03-06 01:22:36 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie: You didn't know I was here before because I was here to help and not make a spectacle of it. #DemDebate
706650335167782912 2016-03-06 01:19:03 UTC <FaithNaff> Hillary, how the hell are you going to eliminate lead in the soil? You quit making empty promises and started promising the moon. #DemDebate
706649253138010112 2016-03-06 01:14:45 UTC <FaithNaff> Hilary, when you're dancing around each question and Bernie is direct to the point, you look shady as hell. #DemDebate
706648663456681984 2016-03-06 01:12:24 UTC <FaithNaff> Bernie cares about Flint's children. Hilary cares about their votes. #DemDebate
706647962227707904 2016-03-06 01:09:37 UTC <FaithNaff> Take note, Hillary. That's how you directly answer a question. #DemDebate #FeelTheBern
705799680584769537 2016-03-04 16:58:51 UTC <FaithNaff> The @HillaryClinton Twitter is getting kinda funhttps://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/705598496934633474
705548901470830593 2016-03-03 00:22:21 UTC <FaithNaff> This is a spoiled child throwing a tantrum! WHY DO PEOPLE WANT HIM TO BE PRESIDENT?!?!https://twitter.com/funnyordie/status/705541395965063168
705528741032828928 2016-03-03 23:02:14 UTC <FaithNaff> Can we please get a better representative in the public eye?! PLEASE?! FOR GOD'S SAKE!http://gawker.com/caitlyn-jenner-wants-to-be-ted-cruzs-trans-ambassador-1762666412
705470598496063488 2016-03-03 19:11:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco That was meant as a further point, not a counter point.
705470078284857348 2016-03-03 19:09:08 UTC <FaithNaff> @mmmdraco we as a society do a thousand things online a day that are harder to secure than a damn ballot.
705459767511162880 2016-03-03 18:28:10 UTC <FaithNaff> The fact that voting hasn't moved online is embarrassing.
705359069998092288 2016-03-03 11:48:01 UTC <FaithNaff> Singers pronouncing the word "you" and "chu" bothers me way more than it should.
705190444897083392 2016-03-02 00:37:58 UTC <FaithNaff> There was just a shooting at the McDonald's 5 minutes from my house!!!!!
705156994303291392 2016-03-02 22:25:03 UTC <FaithNaff> The President is doing his job. You better do yours, Congress. #DoYourJobhttps://twitter.com/nytpolitics/status/705135863940968448
705154022156734465 2016-03-02 22:13:14 UTC <FaithNaff> Nothing stings like presenting authentically and still getting missgendered.
705130025624801281 2016-03-02 20:37:53 UTC <FaithNaff> Republicans, when your choices are a fascist and someone you don't like just to keep the fascist from winning, it's time to change sides.

705064214038245377 2016-03-02 16:16:22 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz My heart aches for you. I know it's hard. Please know you are loved and there's at least one girl in the US who looks up to you.
705063649510092800 2016-03-02 16:14:08 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm working on my 8th novel, and I STILL have to constantly remind myself that I don't have to get it perfect on the rough draft. #writing
705062867763142656 2016-03-02 16:11:01 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz They're always there: whispering, offering the "easy out". I fight them off daily. Hang in there. We love you! <3
705062148720959492 2016-03-02 16:08:10 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz Right there with you. If it's of any help, you are a HUGE inspiration to me!!!!
705045999006433280 2016-03-02 15:03:59 UTC <FaithNaff> The south is America's cancer, and I say this as someone born, raised, and still living there.
705040189878575104 2016-03-02 14:40:54 UTC <FaithNaff> Interesting election. On the left: 2 people who would each make a fine president. On the right: basically the entire Legion of Doom.
705039508174143488 2016-03-02 14:38:12 UTC <FaithNaff> @LaurakBuzz @LauraKBuzz question for Jim: How the hell did you end up in Mississippi?
705037843626921985 2016-03-02 14:31:35 UTC <FaithNaff> @huffpostqueer Really great post. Where were the people saying this when I was growing up? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mia-violet/yes-youre-trans-enough-to_b_9318754.html via @HuffPostQueer

704874809247842304 2016-03-01 03:43:45 UTC <FaithNaff> @ChrisChristie should just change his name to Smithers.
704873817534046208 2016-03-01 03:39:48 UTC <FaithNaff> Hey Millenials, every time you don't vote, you prove an old person calling you lazy and unengaged right.
704872814629789700 2016-03-01 03:35:49 UTC <FaithNaff> I've been depressed enough today and these #SuperTuesday results aren't helping.
704825912601264128 2016-03-01 00:29:27 UTC <FaithNaff> Trump keepswinning primaries. How can this be real life?
704822354434613248 2016-03-01 00:15:18 UTC <FaithNaff> These are the facts, and Republicans are cowards #DoYourJobhttps://twitter.com/PressSec/status/704801940501180416
704768047354159104 2016-03-01 20:39:31 UTC <FaithNaff> I'm a confirmed guest now for #charlottecomicon in May.
704762574252994560 2016-03-01 20:17:46 UTC <FaithNaff> No. The trans community fought with the gay community to secure your rights. It's time for you to return the favor.https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/704733947893309441
