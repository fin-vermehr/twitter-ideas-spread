971820685256470528 2018-03-08 18:51:21 UTC <Steele_Sean> Like this is pathetic, it is unbelievable that you charge for this. Like develop all the great shows you want, but if your website doesn't work people are not going to keep paying for this.
971818624146132992 2018-03-08 18:43:10 UTC <Steele_Sean> It is really disappointing that @hulu cannot play through a video without constantly freezing on high speed internet. Only website that does this, even free to watch websites like youtube and vimeo do not have this problem. Fix your tech.
971487226533236736 2018-03-07 20:46:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs Hahahaha lmfao

971486694682845184 2018-03-07 20:44:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs You are not a very bright person
971486642983899137 2018-03-07 20:43:59 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs No one is harrassing you because they find you attractive, it's a power thing

971485444088238081 2018-03-07 20:39:13 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs And just to clarify my girlfriend and countless women across this city go to work and home on public transit without problem everyday, you are projecting out of racist and classist assumptions. I would ask if you've ever been on our lovely subway but again, already done with you
971484403112251392 2018-03-07 20:35:05 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs I mean, yeah- you don't care, I got it. You're a selfish, pitiful, amoral individual and you don't have any interest in growing. I am done with you.
971479928637132800 2018-03-07 20:17:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs Lmao
971462193207218177 2018-03-07 19:06:50 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs Subway harrassment is a real threat but your perception of public transportation is undoubtedly colored by racist and classist stigmas. This is classic exclusionary white "feminism," rather than make subways safe for all women you'd rather turn up your nose and avoid it.
971437198447923200 2018-03-07 17:27:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> @DavidKlion @krysti_hotdogs Wow the racist/classist undertones of this statement are so thick they are palpable. Also, just simply untrue, you have a better chance of getting raped or murdered walking down your own street than you do of it happening on a subway.
971019589617373184 2018-03-06 13:48:05 UTC <Steele_Sean> Jesus Christ, it's amazing how shitty of a website hulu is. Even with all the money in the world they can't hire a team that can code worth shit

970016803064819713 2018-03-03 19:23:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> @holy_schnitt @IceKareemy @jadenvalentina I think it changes by location cause TJ Maxx and Marshalls are owned by the same company, if you go in a TJ Maxx or Marshall's in lower Manhattan they have the exact same stuff
969980573447086080 2018-03-03 16:59:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved, better not fuck with with her surfboard

969977312849604609 2018-03-03 16:46:27 UTC <Steele_Sean> @holy_schnitt @IceKareemy @jadenvalentina And even Burlington has some gold if you know what's good
969977180670365701 2018-03-03 16:45:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> @holy_schnitt @IceKareemy @jadenvalentina TJ Maxx and Marshalls are literally the same thing. Burlington is that right in between thing.

969951207300222976 2018-03-03 15:02:43 UTC <Steele_Sean> @holy_schnitt @IceKareemy Whaaat bruh you know Amazon is selling just below MSRP, TJ Maxx and Burlington are like half as much! And for expensive brands it's even better, like CK underwear usually 30-45 on amazon is 8 bucks in those spots

967409816221167616 2018-02-24 14:44:08 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 Our voting lines are visible to everyone, they are clearly unfair,  yet they persist. You would just have another unfair thing people know about, can see, and do virtually nothing about.
967409432220094464 2018-02-24 14:42:36 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 That doesn't surprise me one bit.
967409043907244033 2018-02-24 14:41:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the reason you can't see any issues with your idea is the overwhelming privilege you live with, your right to vote wouldn't be altered as you are "an informed"/"literate" vote. We have tried this here. It was bad for people of color.
967407750648082437 2018-02-24 14:35:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 Like Antonio already said, you would be putting this "literacy test" in the hands of lawmakers who have proved time and time again that they can't be trusted, putting their own interests before objective fairness, for example with gerrymandering.
967406806833225728 2018-02-24 14:32:10 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 It is naive, you're just not as bright as you think you are. Elections turn out best witha high voter turn out, putting any hurdle in front of voting is without a doubt going to be used for voter suppression, which you would know if you've ever cracked open a history book.
967254937855057920 2018-02-23 04:28:42 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jonlovett @tonym864 @LukeKenneth3 If you want an informed public, which is the most important part of any democracy, then inform the public- don't put extra hurdles in front of voting. It will be used for voter suppression everytime, regardless of your naive idealistic view of it.

966340649384660993 2018-02-21 15:55:39 UTC <Steele_Sean> @piersmorgan See, it's really funny how think that you can define being American when you are not one. I could live in England the rest of my life and never be British, but that's not how it works here. It's not your immigration status, it's where your heart is. @iamjohnoliver is American.
966336384930902016 2018-02-21 15:38:42 UTC <Steele_Sean> @piersmorgan God, if there is anything you proved today it is that you clearly have no idea what "American" even means. It is no wonder you failed here.

956172469756485632 2018-01-24 14:30:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> @BoringEnormous Wait this edit is missing the best part! The pig finally wakes up and scares the bejesus out of the pup

954589115722412037 2018-01-19 05:39:15 UTC <Steele_Sean> The government just shut down but it's supposed to be 50 degrees tomorrow so I'm staying optimistic
953727340143632384 2018-01-17 20:34:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> There's nothing wrong with a good deal, but when little notes start showing up in your clothes because the laborers who made it are basically slaves (@ZARA) it's maybe time to look elsewhere, especially if you make millions a year @StephenCurry30

952241442705068032 2018-01-13 18:10:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> @markwahlberg @MarkRuffalo @marsbar42 @PeggysWriter They had the same agency, he fucking knew, everyone knew the director and his costar were doing it for nothing, reshooting around Spacey just wasn't worth him working for free for a week. He got caught, now he's trying to seem like a nice guy and not the shitbag he is.
951951325448888320 2018-01-12 22:57:37 UTC <Steele_Sean> @donlemon THIS IS THE @DONLEMON WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
951823835707428864 2018-01-12 14:31:01 UTC <Steele_Sean> Couple months back, I bought myself a nice umbrella thinking "I'm older now, I'm responsible- I can take care of an umbrella," and now here I am, going into work on an off day, terrified of someone taking the 40 dollar umbrella I left.

951475878734827521 2018-01-11 15:28:21 UTC <Steele_Sean> @NYPDnews Scary amount of white men among those recruits. Never seen a black cop unnecessarily shoot someone.
951471942904766465 2018-01-11 15:12:43 UTC <Steele_Sean> @NoiseyMusic @ggimhigh This has to be satire

951130109704056834 2018-01-10 16:34:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> I would have way more respect for Ridley Scott if he fired @mark_wahlberg when he demanded pay for the reshoot, and even more respect for him if he never hired his punk ass in the first place.

It's practically impossible, they don't want it hurting their stats and professors have passed enough politicians' kids sleeping through class to fail a kid who is at least passionate.

943114742415097856 2017-12-19 13:44:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> I love Star Wars but it's probably why science fiction and fantasy get lumped together

941804059157254144 2017-12-15 22:56:00 UTC <Steele_Sean> @comcast coming so hard with those obnoxious sponsored tweets, doing rhetorical gymnastics to try to justify their incredibly unpopular position
941803144681582593 2017-12-15 22:52:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> @AnnCoulter Like it's a mystery as to how you're still single

940738217606860800 2017-12-12 00:20:43 UTC <Steele_Sean> @Alebutton That exact shit happened to me two months ago and then a month later it refunded it, but I think it was Chase that did it, not the MTA
940415160610672640 2017-12-11 02:57:01 UTC <Steele_Sean> @rgay God, you are just the best.

939895683309625344 2017-12-10 16:32:47 UTC <Steele_Sean> The trader joe's employee holding the "end of line" sign just said "I am the end of the line, I am the begining of the end." Happy Sunday

939349000540622848 2017-12-08 04:20:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> You know if you use a little sweet dressing, salad is almost as good as dessert.
938208435002372096 2017-12-05 00:48:16 UTC <Steele_Sean> What isn't happening
938165381239377922 2017-12-05 21:57:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't think there is a single day I have to take the train that I don't think "fuck @NYGovCuomo"
938165381222592512 2017-12-05 21:57:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> @NYGovCuomo most kids aspire to be better than their parents but you just love shitting on your father's legacy
938165381059014656 2017-12-05 21:57:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> God what the actual fuck is happening with the A train
937419633199665153 2017-12-03 20:33:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> How did Williamsburg get even worse?
937335066665127936 2017-12-03 14:57:49 UTC <Steele_Sean> I know there are bigger things going on right now but obviously @people needs to print a retraction on that "sexiest man" garbage like that's just bad journalism.
936977073020850178 2017-12-02 15:15:17 UTC <Steele_Sean> Jesus Christ, impeach the man before he can sign the bill.
936051254647803905 2017-11-29 01:56:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> @rosannecash @gcberg @AdrianBFalcone Actually, things like climate change (like most bad shit in life) disportionately affects people of lower economic classes.
935923182858637319 2017-11-29 17:27:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> Hey @comcast, how about instead of trying to save your brand through shitty sponsored posts you just stop pushing to end net neutrality and not ruin the internet
935703192297451520 2017-11-28 02:53:20 UTC <Steele_Sean> SZA and Solange both got snubbed for album of the year noms. Like both those albums are masterpieces.
935702791720448000 2017-11-28 02:51:44 UTC <Steele_Sean> @sza @thefader She got snubbed on a album of the year nom, though
935170979285884933 2017-11-27 15:38:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> @NYGovCuomo thanks for killing the life blood of the greatest city in the world through chronic  underfunding!
935169956253257733 2017-11-27 15:34:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Who trusts pretty girls, anyway?"
934778417551114240 2017-11-26 13:38:36 UTC <Steele_Sean> As if @comcast won't boost Hulu and slow down @netflix that's adorable, you don't spend that much on lobbying then not do what you want.
934777742071037952 2017-11-26 13:35:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> @comcast You know what's amazing? You are legally not allowed to do any of those things now, and you are fighting really hard to make sure there is no law to prevent you from doing that. You are even looking for ways to prevent states from protecting their consumers
934572289361838081 2017-11-25 23:59:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> In my defense, it is a really cute rain jacket.
934571505601609731 2017-11-25 23:56:25 UTC <Steele_Sean> My roommate just walked into the living room where I was standing wearing a rain coat fully buttoned up with the hood on looking at my phone. It's not even raining outside.
934570218000699392 2017-11-25 23:51:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> I wonder how much ISPs will extort @amazon for if net neutrality is taken away? Those q-tips won't be so cheap anymore.
934444170046996481 2017-11-25 15:30:25 UTC <Steele_Sean> @netflix would probably be the first big victim of the end of net neutrality. @hulu (40% owned by comcast and time warner) is getting more and more competitive with them and would get a speed boost while netflix would be stuck in the slow lane. #verticalintegration
934436370604535808 2017-11-25 14:59:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> Good luck trying to find someone to touch your dingus!

934107332920987648 2017-11-24 17:11:57 UTC <Steele_Sean> @eBay is there a way to change my account so I never get stuff sent via USPS? They are constantly losing/stealing my shit. Like an shipping preferences thing where it calculates fedex or ups instead?
933842656538648578 2017-11-23 23:40:13 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 Right right right cool bruh have a happy thanksgiving!
933841871922696197 2017-11-23 23:37:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 "Technical description?" Now I know you didn't read it. If you don't understand the journalistic integrity is a moral issue, that's fine.
933840098403209218 2017-11-23 23:30:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 Like she completely misrepresented the truth. That's the opposite of integrity, nothing silly about that.
933839234636681217 2017-11-23 23:26:38 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 Okay, first of all did you even read the piece you're talking about? Synthesizers and pedals are objectively not "powered by" computers as she suggested. I don't know what you can't get your head around here.
933837801468121093 2017-11-23 23:20:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura They didn't suggest that anyone attack you, they called you out for being a shitty journalist who suggested that synthesizers and pedals are "powered by" computers. Does being a journalist mean anything to you?
933826902275579905 2017-11-23 22:37:37 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 She literally implied that their synthesizers and pedals are somehow powered by computers, she either has no idea how they work or is purposefully misrepresenting the truth. What do you think the definition of integrity is? Lol
933726295447494658 2017-11-23 15:57:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> @maura @portugaltheman @jsmooth995 You're right, it's asking way too much of a music "journalist" to have any integrity in her work. How dare they explain how she misrepresented them.
933552632865705984 2017-11-22 04:27:46 UTC <Steele_Sean> Net neutrality will probably be dead very soon but a naive part of me hopes the "free market" will destroy @verizon and Time Warner for doing this to us.
933543813439787008 2017-11-22 03:52:44 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm the only one left at this party that doesn't speak Chinese; I think it's time to go.
933401560603865088 2017-11-22 18:27:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> @Noahpinion @csilverandgold And SZA and Solange- both their albums from this year are instant classics.
933392979548655620 2017-11-22 17:53:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> @eddierockerz @FrancisMelber1 Hahaha did you make this account just to argue with @TalibKweli?
933392231544836096 2017-11-22 17:50:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> @TalibKweli @eddierockerz @FrancisMelber1 God, you are so ignorant. Did you know that one of the reasons the March on Washington was so successful was because it was also a huge free concert? Black artists were a essential part of the civil rights movement. "Singing songs" gets people moving.

931533361268625409 2017-11-17 14:43:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> @jack how come there's no log out all devices on twitter? Second night in a row I have woken up to bot retweets from my account even though I changed my password after it happened yesterday.
931379751087951872 2017-11-16 04:33:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop I don't think it's "completely unreasonable,"  but you were missing a huge bit of context there and even when that other dude explained it, you fought him.
931378866295361536 2017-11-16 04:30:00 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop I gotta hand it to you, man- you are funny.
931377617890103296 2017-11-16 04:25:02 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop Oh, but there is. I've read your interactions and you seem to be missing your funny bone, man. I mean- maybe I'm wrong, maybe you love comedy. But yeah, dude. There is.
931375684534067200 2017-11-16 04:17:21 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop I can't imagine you enjoying watching a comedic show if this is how you react to a simple absurdist joke on twitter.
931372824228519936 2017-11-16 04:06:00 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop I was not aware The Good Doctor was about a person with autism but that's not really relevant to the joke- you clearly haven't seen Difficult People but I don't know if you would like it, it's a comedy, which I know isn't your strong suit.
931173862032756736 2017-11-16 14:55:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> @billyeichner @HenryRBishop How did you even arrive at that? Like you jumped so far to make that offensive.

900574143762051072 2017-08-23 04:23:02 UTC <Steele_Sean> Since i rarely take the train anymore i no longer buy an unlimited and not swiping people in feels real odd
900573095349673984 2017-08-23 04:18:52 UTC <Steele_Sean> My last tweet was exactly 140 characters which is impressive considering my level of intoxicati9n
900572917603459072 2017-08-23 04:18:10 UTC <Steele_Sean> I think trump's self control is similar to mine after a couple whiskeys- "this doesn't seem like a good idea but could be awesome let's go!"
900572538002165761 2017-08-23 04:16:39 UTC <Steele_Sean> I am too drunk to skateboard and I'm only typing this so I don't skateboard home but how bad could that be honestly

897568346870251521 2017-08-15 21:19:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> @UnderArmour @BactiveorBquiet @Read_N_Learn Is every person that supported Hitler a Nazi? You bet

892588274925137920 2017-08-01 03:30:02 UTC <Steele_Sean> A passive culture only enables the worst among us to prosper
892587711781064704 2017-08-01 03:27:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> You should be petrified to try and board a train without letting people off first

892585286231879680 2017-08-01 03:18:10 UTC <Steele_Sean> I am honestly at the point where if you're gunna be inconsiderate with your walking I will just plow your ass over
892113521181421568 2017-07-31 20:03:32 UTC <Steele_Sean> Do you guys tip you the dude who makes the halal food at a cart? Serious question, what is the etiquette here?
892112199916892160 2017-07-31 19:58:17 UTC <Steele_Sean> We'll always have "I'm not trying to suck my own cock," timeless. We'll miss you, @Scaramucci lmao

891335192622886912 2017-07-29 16:30:44 UTC <Steele_Sean> If there is any plus side to @realDonaldTrump sort of winning the election is it totally disproves the Illuminati

884513999039148032 2017-07-10 20:45:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> Was there a time when "raving" was actually cool? Late 90's?
884503771275038720 2017-07-10 20:05:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> It would be fantastic to have some world leadership coming from @JustinTrudeau but he's busy taking oil out of the ground.

882678932746711040 2017-07-05 19:13:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> @darren_mills So what Im getting is you do run a parody account, but acknowledging that would undercut why your tweets are funny?

882021850318077953 2017-07-03 23:42:50 UTC <Steele_Sean> This radio station just played "Eye of the Tiger" and then "Hot Stuff," pretty sure they are trying to kill me.

870977682485506048 2017-06-03 12:17:16 UTC <Steele_Sean> @HBO @hbo just cancel @billmaher and give his whole budget to a show that actually works and has a brilliant host, @LastWeekTonight.
870977328846966785 2017-06-03 12:15:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> @HBO you really need to fire @billmaher. I mean that show has been a shit show for a while but that was unacceptable.

849968876683186177 2017-04-06 12:55:46 UTC <Steele_Sean> @pepsi @samtenchuwo @deray You can't get made at models for not being diserning, that was 100% Pepsi's fault and the creatives behind the ad. They owed her an apology.
849968509614526464 2017-04-06 12:54:19 UTC <Steele_Sean> @pepsi @samtenchuwo @deray She's a teenage girl who gets paid to look pretty- not think. She didn't come up with that ad, she just played the part they handed her.

779804169121267712 2016-09-24 22:06:16 UTC <Steele_Sean> Usually I open up Twitter because I want to say something stupid
779330707445391378 2016-09-23 14:44:54 UTC <Steele_Sean> Just another reminder, Burning Man hasn't been cool since I was about 7. Have a great weekend!

778591389215064064 2016-09-21 13:47:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> Waking up is stupid
778303303599919104 2016-09-20 18:42:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> Not quite enough cigarettes to calm me down

774965657649676288 2016-09-11 13:39:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't give a fuck about people in love; they don't piss me off, they just make me give up.
774600843224092672 2016-09-10 13:30:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> Can my brain throw up?
774598361542426624 2016-09-10 13:20:15 UTC <Steele_Sean> Super glad I woke up so early
774375525162835968 2016-09-09 22:34:47 UTC <Steele_Sean> Do I look like a drug dealer?

774133211790123009 2016-09-08 06:31:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> Why would anyone ever order fries when McDonald's serves hash browns all day now?

770907076801462272 2016-08-31 08:52:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm sorry I don't have the right words to say to you. I'm sorry I can't make this easier.
770340674789076993 2016-08-29 19:21:43 UTC <Steele_Sean> Brie cheese is the meaning of life
770328240019898368 2016-08-29 18:32:19 UTC <Steele_Sean> Remember that time when @CommunityTV licensed "Layla" only to use the instrumental at the end
770315605870272512 2016-08-29 17:42:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Do you still have the number of that private investigator you used when you thought Ross Perot was sleeping with your mom?"
770309775246721024 2016-08-29 17:18:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't even work during the day or anything but aren't Mondays the worst?

769583618545086468 2016-08-27 17:13:27 UTC <Steele_Sean> The way that shows advertise their Emmy nominees you would think I was a voter or something.
769580096952864770 2016-08-27 16:59:27 UTC <Steele_Sean> @xkaraalove shut up
769579198377783297 2016-08-27 16:55:53 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm just a little baby
769192188790046720 2016-08-26 15:18:03 UTC <Steele_Sean> @UPSHelp hey thanks so much but it just arrived
769188221754433536 2016-08-26 15:02:17 UTC <Steele_Sean> Waiting for/hoping you haven't missed the ups guy is more anxiety inducing than it really ought to be.
768087879281176576 2016-08-23 14:09:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> @TheParamountNY @TedNugent @ORSVP you cannot even give away free tickets to see that racist clown.
768087640117743617 2016-08-23 14:08:58 UTC <Steele_Sean> @TheParamountNY @TedNugent @ORSVP literally no one. That's amazing.
767925044261642240 2016-08-22 03:22:52 UTC <Steele_Sean> Sometimes, I think you're right- I do hate you.
767853153438076928 2016-08-22 22:37:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> I wish I had like one more hour to sleep
767847548694462464 2016-08-22 22:14:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> And the sky was all violet
767361598470184960 2016-08-21 14:03:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> Ouch
767260951389364224 2016-08-21 07:24:00 UTC <Steele_Sean> I think I'm already hungover.
767043089307406336 2016-08-20 16:58:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> @steele_abby it's your own fault for being naive enough to believe that originality exists
767042212861452288 2016-08-20 16:54:49 UTC <Steele_Sean> I get so patriotic during the Olympics.
766129022082441216 2016-08-17 04:26:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> Maybe we could run away and start a little repertory movie house or something
765935239361359872 2016-08-17 15:36:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Look both ways before you cross my mind."

765640046267494400 2016-08-16 20:03:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> Kill everybody walkin/you know that his soul in the furnance.
765413132198084608 2016-08-15 05:01:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> @SanaLorraine_ That show is so classic
765412748725485568 2016-08-15 04:59:54 UTC <Steele_Sean> Keep your heart three steps

763678959632523264 2016-08-11 10:10:27 UTC <Steele_Sean> Dear sleep, I think we could potentially be better together than apart. I'm just saying. Love, Sean
763244982698405888 2016-08-09 05:25:58 UTC <Steele_Sean> I know you love your cat but it's not particularly photogenic, sorry.
763244298519339008 2016-08-09 05:23:15 UTC <Steele_Sean> @samtenchuwo I would be so much healthier if I listened to you more often
763229184168697856 2016-08-09 04:23:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> I probably smoke too many cigarettes.

755768394494910464 2016-07-20 14:16:41 UTC <Steele_Sean> I can't find my favorite pair of kick around torquoise boat shoes and it does feel somewhat tragic.

746774408153473025 2016-06-25 18:37:47 UTC <Steele_Sean> The whole "friends" thing is way too anxiety inducing.
746358222689345536 2016-06-24 15:04:01 UTC <Steele_Sean> @CNN That's a new low, @cnn.
746078083317403648 2016-06-23 20:30:51 UTC <Steele_Sean> Doesn't it just rock when your coworkers are super racist?
744219985694892034 2016-06-18 17:27:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> @SanaLorraine_ yeah no shit. Was this before or after he stole all my shit?
744206339698753537 2016-06-18 16:33:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> An old lady just wished me a happy early father's day. Uhm, no thank you.

744159051609743361 2016-06-18 13:25:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> @xkaraalove get lost in my eyes or get 10x more lost in his
744080397772939264 2016-06-18 08:12:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> @xkaraalove this is about Jamie
742550493038252032 2016-06-13 02:53:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> Holy shit, did you guys know you can make gin and tonics at home? This is a game changer.
740209307195707394 2016-06-07 15:50:25 UTC <Steele_Sean> Remember when @CNN wasn't a complete joke? Those were the days.
739696375047327745 2016-06-05 05:52:13 UTC <Steele_Sean> Because I am the definition of a terrible person.
739696231363006464 2016-06-05 05:51:39 UTC <Steele_Sean> Sometimes I get drunk and just read my own tweets.
739695691409334272 2016-06-05 05:49:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> "The first step towards failure is trying."

739122741731831814 2016-06-04 15:52:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> Is it too late to just disappear?
738826226358456320 2016-06-03 20:14:33 UTC <Steele_Sean> The only thing standing between scurvy and I right now are the limes in my nightly gin and tonics.
738821328543862784 2016-06-03 19:55:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> Whenever I type the word "quit" in a text or something my phone suggests "smoking" as the next word. Nice try, phone.
738813090523942916 2016-06-03 19:22:21 UTC <Steele_Sean> There needs to be a puke reaction on Facebook for posts that unironically use the phrase "dad bods" or mention Donald Trump.
737312343370129409 2016-05-30 15:58:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> Was there an original "Ignition" or did R Kelly just jump right to releasing the remix?
736754425738465281 2016-05-28 03:01:57 UTC <Steele_Sean> It's a couple years late but I finally gained that freshman 15
736649829875654656 2016-05-28 20:06:20 UTC <Steele_Sean> Everything is better on tape

735182160919994368 2016-05-24 18:54:20 UTC <Steele_Sean> Time Warner Cable is what is wrong with America.
735127648561561602 2016-05-24 15:17:44 UTC <Steele_Sean> @zennioptical the middle one, it's like 10 -14 days or something, not the two to three week one
735127342780030977 2016-05-24 15:16:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm not here, this isn't happening.
735000518335008768 2016-05-23 06:52:33 UTC <Steele_Sean> Like, my Internet from my cell phone goes to space first, and somehow is still faster than my direct cable Time Warner.
734541523547742209 2016-05-22 00:28:40 UTC <Steele_Sean> That there- that's not me.

734376742404624384 2016-05-22 13:33:54 UTC <Steele_Sean> @steele_abby yeah it was a joke like "all your friends graduated but I just don't have any,"
734368488660275200 2016-05-22 13:01:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> @steele_abby I know I was just teasing you
734266185030770688 2016-05-21 06:14:35 UTC <Steele_Sean> @SanaLorraine_ I mean that goes without saying lol

734016978537549824 2016-05-21 13:44:19 UTC <Steele_Sean> Does it feel freeing to say your art is dead?

733683280487321600 2016-05-20 15:38:19 UTC <Steele_Sean> @zennioptical quick question, I know this is slightly absurd but I ordered glasses yesterday and I want to see if I can upgrade the shipping
733015892800503808 2016-05-18 19:26:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> What the fuck am I fighting for?
732988717871312896 2016-05-18 17:38:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> Rapidly getting over this
732578110323974151 2016-05-17 14:26:46 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm gunna die really fast when I get old because I'm not waking up for shit as soon as I'm retired.
732572659880333312 2016-05-17 14:05:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> Sure, you'd prefer my attention but you'll happily take his, too.
732391849013465088 2016-05-16 02:06:38 UTC <Steele_Sean> So when @realDonaldTrump loses, we don't ever have to hear about him again, right? Like he'll just disappear?
732367169766350850 2016-05-16 00:28:34 UTC <Steele_Sean> I've grown accustomed to her face.
731774468142575616 2016-05-15 09:13:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> If you don't get Kid A we'll never actually be friends

729422803481595904 2016-05-08 21:28:43 UTC <Steele_Sean> I feel like a wizard without a wand when I am without my cellphone.
729006648568758272 2016-05-07 17:55:03 UTC <Steele_Sean> Scrolling through Facebook on my phone makes it easier to get out of bed, right?
728350401045643264 2016-05-05 22:27:22 UTC <Steele_Sean> I take procrastination to new levels
728041773558272002 2016-05-04 02:00:59 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm gunna be the last one of my friends to get a doctorate lol

726417826345529344 2016-04-30 14:28:00 UTC <Steele_Sean> @steele_abby I just didn't know that it was that much better than other BBQ because it was basically the only BBQ I had ever had.
726416585792049152 2016-04-30 14:23:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> Eating Limp Lizard just made me appreciate Dinosaur.
724811758377009154 2016-04-25 04:06:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm too young to be this old
723215809556914176 2016-04-21 18:24:20 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't want to say rest in peace to Prince because I'm still holding out hope he's still alive and this is just a sick joke.
722825930478075906 2016-04-20 16:35:05 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Look at my flaws, look at my flaws/look at my imperfections in awe,"
722677315176677378 2016-04-19 06:44:33 UTC <Steele_Sean> There are just so many books to read
722472476933009408 2016-04-19 17:10:36 UTC <Steele_Sean> Lol remember when you used to be cute?
721901317531312128 2016-04-17 03:21:01 UTC <Steele_Sean> Sometimes I slightly wallow in the fact I wasn't young while cats like Trane and Miles were rockin but like I got K-dot and Ye so fuck it.
721327757507084289 2016-04-16 13:21:53 UTC <Steele_Sean> Whaaaaat new Kimmy Schmitt episodes
721151972288671744 2016-04-15 01:43:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> Icees are just liquidish snocones.
721087561591087104 2016-04-15 21:27:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> I bet the person who invented sushi was a real prankster
720825492949979136 2016-04-14 04:06:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Everything is in order in a black hole,"
719564019137437697 2016-04-11 16:33:25 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm not remotely suggesting this- but it would only take like 2 nukes to just eliminate North Korea as a whole, right?
719555128647401472 2016-04-11 15:58:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> I love that @genesimmons thinks anyone gives a fuck about what he says, like you weren't cool in the 80's and you're definitely not shit now
718129386113859584 2016-04-07 17:32:42 UTC <Steele_Sean> @ShariTen @shariten @cubagoodingjr Right totally I knew I was forgetting one.
718128854393626624 2016-04-07 17:30:35 UTC <Steele_Sean> @cubagoodingjr not hating on Young Thug or anything but The Beatles did have a movie, "A Hard Days' Night" and it was kinda cool
718107051638067200 2016-04-07 16:03:57 UTC <Steele_Sean> Cradle your head in your hands
717582795728617472 2016-04-05 05:20:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> You're the only one bobbing your head to your beat, kid.
717178085708271616 2016-04-04 02:32:34 UTC <Steele_Sean> The question remains, how self destructive can I be in one night
717031826339074049 2016-04-04 16:51:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> I just tooted. You're welcome.

715864135406395392 2016-04-01 11:31:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> @donlemon Have a fun time letting @finneyk essentially monologue through that segment?
715845276855103488 2016-04-01 10:16:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> Fuck up some commas
715739494268477440 2016-03-31 03:16:07 UTC <Steele_Sean> Making them fall in love is easy, making them stay in love is what's difficult
715229467719901184 2016-03-30 17:29:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> If you're talking about how hard it is to be a Republican in college there is literally no hope for you.
713206473090797568 2016-03-24 03:30:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> I can't hear the word "chulupa" without thinking of @iamjohnoliver saying "I love America... I love chulupas," as Duncan on @CommunityTV
713197332179845120 2016-03-24 02:54:29 UTC <Steele_Sean> Christ has come again but he goes by Kendrick.

712725811602845696 2016-03-23 19:40:49 UTC <Steele_Sean> Is it bad that when I watch @HouseofCards I am low key thinking "#RelationshipGoals?" #Underwood2016

711967913163542528 2016-03-21 17:29:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> Light and sound are basically the same thing.
711961059029024768 2016-03-21 17:01:58 UTC <Steele_Sean> My little sister is cooler than all of you.
711954756151943168 2016-03-21 16:36:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> Georgia could be a really wonderful place aside from all those people that live there.
711949118252388352 2016-03-21 16:14:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> I just woke up, why is Hotline Bling already stuck in my head?
711608249494151168 2016-03-20 17:40:02 UTC <Steele_Sean> Can't I just be Asap Rocky's best friend? Is that too much to ask?
709007430047371264 2016-03-13 13:25:18 UTC <Steele_Sean> Fuck you, daylight savings time.
707973996277592064 2016-03-10 16:58:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> Drugs won't get you high as this- Love won't get you high as this
707837558793904128 2016-03-09 07:56:39 UTC <Steele_Sean> So @HouseofCards is obviously amazing- but I feel like I haven't heard even close to enough about the score. I mean this music is so solid.
707454665617756160 2016-03-08 06:35:10 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm so sad to hear ya left. Rest in peace, George Martin.

705893809247363077 2016-03-04 23:12:53 UTC <Steele_Sean> @ColtenCaudle Yo my bad dude, you're totally right. I got thrown when you called it the "real unemployment rate"
705892011518386177 2016-03-04 23:05:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> #whitegirls
705080502290685952 2016-03-02 17:21:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't think life has been quite the same since @McDonalds stopped serving Mozzarella sticks. It was a hot, short love affair.

703478700147396608 2016-02-26 07:16:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> Isn't it funny how I almost seem human?
703478614982049792 2016-02-26 07:15:46 UTC <Steele_Sean> Ugh.
703263740037369856 2016-02-26 17:01:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> @playdots Hey, sorry I didn't realize there was an update available- it's working now.

703232255624396800 2016-02-26 14:56:49 UTC <Steele_Sean> @nevona So I'm pretty sure this means you win.pic.twitter.com/k7G7KQtdSh
703061296783171586 2016-02-25 03:37:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> @playdots hey, for some reason every time I try to start the first level on the quest map the game crashes. I've tried like a dozen times.
700946588492021760 2016-02-19 07:34:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> Dear @McDolands, Mozzarella sticks were the best thing you've ever carried. Why on earth would you stop? Love, Sean
700937753404563456 2016-02-19 06:59:17 UTC <Steele_Sean> The plight of the common man. #lol
700935313565286401 2016-02-19 06:49:36 UTC <Steele_Sean> Republicans have already been successful in creating a partisan split that will last decades.
700934478546374656 2016-02-19 06:46:17 UTC <Steele_Sean> I don't mean to stereotype but you can totally tell a conservative by head shape.
700769052822794241 2016-02-19 19:48:56 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen thrown together style of the track list is part of what makes it should a Kanye album
700768681689792514 2016-02-19 19:47:28 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen Sia on Wolves was dope, the album version was like solid but not as good, but I see what you're saying. I felt like the...
700767942825353216 2016-02-19 19:44:31 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen And while Drunk and Hot Girls is exactly the track I had in mind when I said that, I love Bound 2- and I love the video lol
700767518470840320 2016-02-19 19:42:50 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen Haha I feel ya, that was a heavy jam. While it didn't keep the choir throughout, the minimalistic beats continued.
700766347555373056 2016-02-19 19:38:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> Rest in peace #PaulGaston, you were twice the man than any of the excuses for human beings that murdered you.
700765800446164992 2016-02-19 19:36:01 UTC <Steele_Sean> "OH MY GOD, WHAT'S HE DOING" shouts the Cincinnati cop before opening fire. Mother fucker you had a gun in his face, are you that insecure?
700765338846294016 2016-02-19 19:34:11 UTC <Steele_Sean> When cops say they were "scared for their lives" while a man in unarmed and on his knees at gunpoint is pathetic.
700765056137633792 2016-02-19 19:33:03 UTC <Steele_Sean> If you are scared of a unarmed man you have no business being a police officer.
700741243182120962 2016-02-19 17:58:26 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen and I feel like that honestly counts for a lot.
700741083819548672 2016-02-19 17:57:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen every now and then, even up to MBDTF, Yeezus was the first I honestly loved every track on, and this hit it for me as well...
700740756143738880 2016-02-19 17:56:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen I also feel like this is honestly his most listenable album, even on his early shit I find myself wanting to skip a song...
700740477390290944 2016-02-19 17:55:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen I feel like is the most artistic and experimental of all of his records. But the songs are all fucking banging, I agree
700739530857586688 2016-02-19 17:51:37 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen throughout, with moments of profundity among a sea of profanity, his favorite juxtaposition and the production on this...
700739177567145984 2016-02-19 17:50:13 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen creativity that while obviously far less polished than his other albums. Lyrically there certainly were similar themes...
700738539131117569 2016-02-19 17:47:41 UTC <Steele_Sean> @mikegandersen I feel like this is the most Kanye album he's put out yet, the somewhat ADD feeling feels like a more honest outpouring of...
700502329657786368 2016-02-18 02:09:04 UTC <Steele_Sean> It's 9 pm on a Thursday in Syracuse so @tacobell is the poppinest joint around.
700354625120178180 2016-02-18 16:22:09 UTC <Steele_Sean> But Father Stretch My Hands Pt 1, doe. #thatdrop
700352418165424129 2016-02-18 16:13:23 UTC <Steele_Sean> Haters can talk shit but this new Yeezy album is off the fucking chain.
697488599529431040 2016-02-10 18:33:35 UTC <Steele_Sean> I am just shit at dictating rhythm
696918150684790784 2016-02-08 04:46:49 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm watching this David Letterman interview from 2014 and he keeps referring to @JonahHill as "the kid" to Scorsese.
696575639600701440 2016-02-07 06:05:48 UTC <Steele_Sean> "Every libertarian was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple."
696399508381560833 2016-02-07 18:25:55 UTC <Steele_Sean> God, Syracuse sucks so bad.
696349860304449536 2016-02-07 15:08:38 UTC <Steele_Sean> .@fatherjohnmisty should cover "10,000 Candles in the Wind (Bye-bye, 'Lil Sebastian)" from @parksandrecnbc because duh.
695987187062591489 2016-02-06 15:07:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm really glad I went to the high school that I did so I know what all the shittiest people really think. #memories
695739778961170432 2016-02-05 22:44:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> @LathieEeener Bahahaha what?
694551164696817664 2016-02-02 16:01:16 UTC <Steele_Sean> Cause you could say that this is not too far to carry this.
694239571438104577 2016-02-01 19:23:06 UTC <Steele_Sean> @playdots It's cool, love the game
694196447001088001 2016-02-01 16:31:45 UTC <Steele_Sean> @playdots It happened a couple times in a row that time and like a couple other times afterwards.
693875416902279168 2016-01-31 19:16:05 UTC <Steele_Sean> @samtenchuwo I guess it depends on your age when they were released lol
693872429135982592 2016-01-31 19:04:13 UTC <Steele_Sean> You're not a real Harry Potter fan unless you read Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through The Ages as a kid.
693615808312930304 2016-01-30 02:04:30 UTC <Steele_Sean> @j3lander I don't know what you're talking about but count me in
693360552475824129 2016-01-30 09:10:12 UTC <Steele_Sean> Go home, @playdots- you're drunk. #whatishappeningpic.twitter.com/jrf46aec9e
692374102477291520 2016-01-27 15:50:24 UTC <Steele_Sean> I know I'm super late on the bus but Transparent is amazing and heartbreaking and fantastic and I'm only on episode three.
691011688578031618 2016-01-23 21:36:39 UTC <Steele_Sean> Swing so hard it's almost a shuffle.
690434805415202817 2016-01-21 07:24:19 UTC <Steele_Sean> I'm far too idealistic for life.
690424541118644224 2016-01-21 06:43:32 UTC <Steele_Sean> I really don't like three ball.
