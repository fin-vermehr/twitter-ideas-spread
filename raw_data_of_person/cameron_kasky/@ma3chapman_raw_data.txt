899836248847769600 2017-08-21 03:30:54 UTC <ma3chapman> i think bangs can be super cute and ~quirky~ but also a lot of brunette mormon girls have bangs. we can't help it. do i want that image?
899835972384423936 2017-08-21 03:29:48 UTC <ma3chapman> there's also the fact that i could purchase fake bangs. and be THAT girl.
899835125252444160 2017-08-21 03:26:26 UTC <ma3chapman> I'm not insane though. they can be a pain. you have to straighten them all da time. when they grow out it's annoying. i see the cons.

836970361912766464 2017-03-01 16:04:19 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns Shack has a doctorate in administration. Not in music.
836970159659225088 2017-03-01 16:03:30 UTC <ma3chapman> @aimee_ns welcome to life, where I attended a meeting to make MY voice heard and you didn't do the same, but want people to ~chill~.
836968683943702531 2017-03-01 15:57:39 UTC <ma3chapman> @hal_k28 @_michael_017 @aimee_ns some students can't help their "level of understanding". there are kids from all backgrounds at oths.
836968076671348736 2017-03-01 15:55:14 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns it's saying that she is easily replaceable, even though our program is 3rd in state? that's why i whine.
836967736530071553 2017-03-01 15:53:53 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns shack was the old director, so by firing nordin now they are saying "thanks for keeping this seat warm for 6 yrs"
836967024479842309 2017-03-01 15:51:03 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns the choir program isn't going away, sure. but they are firing nordin only to keep shack. no other reason.
836966812474540034 2017-03-01 15:50:12 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns actions speak louder than words. they are giving nordin's position to shack.
836966440020365312 2017-03-01 15:48:44 UTC <ma3chapman> school board spent hrs listenin 2 public comment + still passed budget cut no 1 wanted. they r supposed 2 represent us. I will whine 4ever.https://twitter.com/aimee_ns/status/836914789251178497
836965573275840513 2017-03-01 15:45:17 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns they had other options. consolidate. cut central office. cuts across activities. the tax levy.
836964081617743872 2017-03-01 15:39:21 UTC <ma3chapman> @_michael_017 @aimee_ns I'm so thankful that the program Nordin created for 7 years meant little/nothing to the school board! Ecstatic even.
836963479017910272 2017-03-01 15:36:58 UTC <ma3chapman> @aimee_ns they will still be taught, but it will not be the same quality by any means.
836963301661749248 2017-03-01 15:36:15 UTC <ma3chapman> @aimee_ns you're right, WE get to have an education. But what about the future OTHS students? What about our underclassmen?
836838154220994560 2017-02-28 07:18:58 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman meanwhile, DB doesn't attend my choir concerts, fall play performances, etc. No effort in knowing students personally.
836837783029297161 2017-02-28 07:17:29 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman this man potentially has his job on the line and still took time to giggle over little pictures with me.
836837466451685377 2017-02-28 07:16:14 UTC <ma3chapman> Prindable was rows behind me and we sent some gifs while waiting for the decision. That's how cool our teachers are.pic.twitter.com/PCBJjX9vdL
836833881936506880 2017-02-28 07:01:59 UTC <ma3chapman> @nboone00 he's the only board member who responded to any of my emails the past week regarding the meeting and budget cuts.
836830670425112576 2017-02-28 06:49:14 UTC <ma3chapman> I vote we shower our teachers with love this Friday. We make cards, sing songs, and appreciate the staff we have while they're here.
836829941635375104 2017-02-28 06:46:20 UTC <ma3chapman> @Maggiemoo_914 basically. unless teachers will speak up when they know, even though DB likes to have everyone keep quiet
836829544942350345 2017-02-28 06:44:45 UTC <ma3chapman> @Maggiemoo_914 it's still not confirmed because you know...school board doesn't tell us anything until it's too late
836829410439348224 2017-02-28 06:44:13 UTC <ma3chapman> @Maggiemoo_914 we've been told Garrison, Nordin, and Prindable.
836827545425358850 2017-02-28 06:36:48 UTC <ma3chapman> @KingJones88 
836827268940980225 2017-02-28 06:35:43 UTC <ma3chapman> @Maggiemoo_914 i mean...you aren't wrong
836826268595257344 2017-02-28 06:31:44 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman also....that's not clever enough to repeat every year. next!
836825971093291008 2017-02-28 06:30:33 UTC <ma3chapman> remember when DB said "it's my way or the Benway"? she says it at NHS induction every year. gross.
836819349302362112 2017-02-28 06:04:14 UTC <ma3chapman> CLASS OF 2017, I'm gonna say this right now. I am not shaking Benway's hand at graduation (thx for the idea @madelyncooper_ ) 
836811935559610369 2017-02-28 05:34:47 UTC <ma3chapman> OTHS ignores public comment for 2 hours, does what they want anywayhttps://twitter.com/othstoday/status/836811652754509825
836811769733648384 2017-02-28 05:34:07 UTC <ma3chapman> We all deserve better than what we were given tonight. That's the reality of the situation. Our community deserves better than this.

836807694795304960 2017-02-28 05:17:56 UTC <ma3chapman> I can't apologize enough to the underclassmen and future students of OTHS. The school board has failed you.
836807136801869825 2017-02-28 05:15:43 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman And three times, for good measure...the school board doesn't care about us. They don't know who we are. My teachers know me.
836806993503522817 2017-02-28 05:15:09 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman The school board doesn't care about us. Thank you to the few members who voted in our favor.
836806700883673090 2017-02-28 05:13:59 UTC <ma3chapman> Glad to know our school board doesn't care about us. 2 and a half hours of public comment, begging the board to vote no.
836773039664676864 2017-02-28 03:00:13 UTC <ma3chapman> dr benway made a joke about the storm during her presentation and NO ONE LAUGHED. not a laughing situation, sorry girly
836650999049760769 2017-02-28 18:55:17 UTC <ma3chapman> STUDENTS!! Please come to the board meeting tonight. Our attendance could make or break their vote.

834981335731142657 2017-02-23 04:20:38 UTC <ma3chapman> @vicky_birchem 
834977021809864704 2017-02-23 04:03:29 UTC <ma3chapman> @erincornwall true! he is the best.
834976722508517376 2017-02-23 04:02:18 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman OH WAIT. i have seen an administrator at a performance of mine. Shackelford.
834976317842079744 2017-02-23 04:00:41 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman i've never seen her at a choir performance or at fall play. i would have loved to see an administrator supporting the arts.
834976095116136448 2017-02-23 03:59:48 UTC <ma3chapman> Quick question for OTHS students: when has Dr. Benway attended one of your games? concerts? performances?
834962428182016001 2017-02-23 03:05:30 UTC <ma3chapman> FYI school board didnt want students knowing all this info. they aren't happy campers. we deserve 2 know when our education is in danger!
834956938370813953 2017-02-23 02:43:41 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman Even if you're a senior, the education of the youth in this town is at stake. Our siblings, our neighbors, our community.
834956755603947520 2017-02-23 02:42:57 UTC <ma3chapman> OTHS students deserve better than losing Shack, Nordin, and another 10 full time teachers. YOUR education is up for a vote on February 28th.
834912257033265153 2017-02-23 23:46:08 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman there are 10 full time teachers on the line + we just recently heard about it? that doesn't sit well with me at all. it's gross.
834904322265788417 2017-02-23 23:14:36 UTC <ma3chapman> The students at OTHS don't need a million people working in the central office who don't know us. Shack watched us grow. We need Shack.
834893942193803265 2017-02-23 22:33:22 UTC <ma3chapman> @BaileyBoswell99 we talked to some other teachers and we've been told Mr. Garrison is one of them.
834792661966008320 2017-02-23 15:50:54 UTC <ma3chapman> @SAS_Ripper they are voting 2 fire shack from her position + give her her old position as choir director, which kicks nordin out of the job
834594759754788866 2017-02-22 02:44:31 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman there r staff @ oths who have little/no interaction w/ students. shack welcomed us that first day freshman year. remember that.
834594305125838849 2017-02-22 02:42:43 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman And the people i've met through these programs (choir and frolics) because of Nordin + Shack are my best friends. February 28th.pic.twitter.com/woSQYcKn7n
834593344735047681 2017-02-22 02:38:54 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman Nordin has created this world that I have gotten to live in for four years. It's the one place I know where I belong.
834592958397685760 2017-02-22 02:37:21 UTC <ma3chapman> @BaileyBoswell99 no, we weren't told who yet. they'll probably say at the meeting but those teachers probably know by now
834592814503718913 2017-02-22 02:36:47 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman Imagine your coach/mentor looking you in the eyes and APOLOGIZING for looking for another job when their's is in jeopardy.
834592402878889984 2017-02-22 02:35:09 UTC <ma3chapman> @ma3chapman our sports/activities won't be the only ones suffering, the quality of education at OTHS will end up worse.
834592150075691008 2017-02-22 02:34:09 UTC <ma3chapman> I may b graduating in May, but every student at OTHS deserves the best. Moving Shack & firing Nordin + 10 other teachers is a bad choice.
834581083312287746 2017-02-22 01:50:10 UTC <ma3chapman> @breannclare i personally copy and pasted my email to each member and also benway
834581019860807680 2017-02-22 01:49:55 UTC <ma3chapman> My emails are sent! Are yours? Please consider reaching out to the school board to express the need for Shack at OTHS!!pic.twitter.com/8dtBZfEw4W
