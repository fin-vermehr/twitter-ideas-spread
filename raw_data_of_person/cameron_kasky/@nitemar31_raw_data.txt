820644284349169664 2017-01-15 14:50:18 UTC <nitemar31> Someone needs to get a copy of the Constitution to Trump......perhaps the 5th grade level so he can understand it.
820637925159354368 2017-01-15 14:25:02 UTC <nitemar31> The GOP has a plan.  Replace Obamacare with the Affordable Care Act.  After all the Trumpsters don't know they are the same thing.

813889252517941248 2016-12-27 23:28:13 UTC <nitemar31> The GOP will try pass as many destructive bills as possible in the first year.  They know what a short memory the electorate has.
812330223257718784 2016-12-23 16:13:12 UTC <nitemar31> Instead of the #Rockettes, perhaps Rick Perry could do some dancing at the coronation. At least he has some experience at that.
812326726583877634 2016-12-23 15:59:18 UTC <nitemar31> Looks like Trump is playing chicken with nuclear rhetoric. Maybe trying to start a nuke war before he is sworn in so Obama can be blamed.
812325201614696448 2016-12-23 15:53:14 UTC <nitemar31> Trump wants a coronation not an inauguration.
812323456989720576 2016-12-23 15:46:19 UTC <nitemar31> Perhaps the Rockettes could get "Trump flu" and call in sick.  Surely they have sick days or vacation time? Maybe?
