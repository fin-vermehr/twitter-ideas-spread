971853337825042433 2018-03-08 21:01:06 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Seminole County, just north of you and have an office in Palm Beach Gardens.
971852799364476928 2018-03-08 20:58:58 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 I live in Florida friend.
971844946230640640 2018-03-08 20:27:45 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 You can Google the Wikipedia page on DC versus Heller
971844764004962306 2018-03-08 20:27:02 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Supreme Court also said the 2nd doesn't prohibit who can own what, where or when. Specifically saying mental illness,  assault weapons, and schools. So. Again. Rule of law.
971844190001942528 2018-03-08 20:24:45 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Agreed. There's no frivolity in a court date. So the cops  come and take your weapons for a bit when the ex or neighbor rats you out. You get a hearing and you get your things back. Reasonable gun laws arent the problem.
971843510512078848 2018-03-08 20:22:03 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Fuck you. You move. I've every right as you do to live anywhere in the USA.  And, I trust our laws, cuz I'm not a criminal and can afford lawyers.
971843230110306307 2018-03-08 20:20:56 UTC <pauloesco> @TopRopeTravis I don't think they'll take him back

971839661302845440 2018-03-08 20:06:45 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 So. You don't like my reasoned points versus your fears. You dont like my religion, cuz yours it right? And you're willing to put your selfish material ownership of a gun over the lives of kids.  I'm happy I've shaken your beliefs enough that you need 2 give yourself a time out
971838648273514497 2018-03-08 20:02:44 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Yep. We have a rule of law in this country. You get a day in court over your guns. I'm a gun owner, and had that day in court in Massachusetts during a divorce. If you can't prove your point, you're a danger to society. Deal with it.
971835334416912384 2018-03-08 19:49:34 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @SueZen54 @kencollinsdp And you know what else, the first teacher who accidentally misfires a weapon or God forbid shoots a non-mass murderer is going to be fully prosecuted for the death penalty in FL. So help me god.
971834887371132928 2018-03-08 19:47:47 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @SueZen54 @kencollinsdp Right. And you think a 5 hour course is going to teach you to stack up to defeat a shooter or 2 with assault rifles. You're a moron. You're advocating a school gunfight with kids all around you. Which is exactly why we need gun bans. You probably flag a weapon at a range today.

971832879171940352 2018-03-08 19:39:48 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @_c243 Ok. So you get a report against you, and you get your day in court to prove you're not a maniac who should have his guns taken. You don't believe in the courts, or your ability to prove your sanity and responsible gun ownership?
971832368490336258 2018-03-08 19:37:47 UTC <pauloesco> @BamaStephen @marcorubio @FilmDoctor It means that the Parkland shooters foster parents believed it was his right to own, at 18-19, despite the 39 complaints against that kid.

971829874972381184 2018-03-08 19:27:52 UTC <pauloesco> Little Marco thinks that video games, not guns, has something to do with mass shootings. Remove the "environmental factor" to gun massacres, namely, the guns.https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/971816747132162054

971458451275681792 2018-03-07 18:51:58 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden See, now China is always an interesting case. Communist command economy buys where the govt says to buy. Now THAT'S targeted retaliation.
971454840734969857 2018-03-07 18:37:37 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden It's just an idiotic idea. What is it, the 19th century? Global trade is how American consumers spend to add to that 3+% gdp Drumpf keeps crowing about
971454581216604162 2018-03-07 18:36:35 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden Yep. But targeted too to have an impact on McConnell Ryan and their ilk

971450466214334466 2018-03-07 18:20:14 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden And the dollar is going to weaken, anyway, especially as the ECB ends their bond buybacks as the US did a year ago
971450234554535936 2018-03-07 18:19:19 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden Altho I will agree that the bigger issue is erosion of USA trust globally. But that started with TPP then Paris and now NAFTA. The tariffs are just an insult.
971449759260082176 2018-03-07 18:17:25 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden BI always has some funny stuff in it. I listen to my industry sources and take that bet atm
971449295173046272 2018-03-07 18:15:35 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden No, truly, the retaliation comes from the trade war. Remember that the US debt market is 40% of global bond markets. And, investors are aggregate of people, biz, and govt buying. So "invisible hand" makes bond dumping to fite US tariffs impractical
971445987947446273 2018-03-07 18:02:26 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden And look, you're a nice person and we're "on the same side"... But finance and funds is what I do. And, I'm really good at at. So, trust me on this one
971445349494685696 2018-03-07 17:59:54 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden Are we going to debate a bind fund which sector rotates for currency and junk bonds v US trsy? Again, that's not how it works.
971442767485394944 2018-03-07 17:49:38 UTC <pauloesco> @CarolForden That's not the reality of economics. We have a 3% yield on that debt. Euro bonds pay sub zero except for their junk debt. No one is going to sell 3% bonds to buy Euro
971440476267143168 2018-03-07 17:40:32 UTC <pauloesco> @brickpathdream @JoyAnnReid Haha. Most of his base thought he ran on The Wall and being a racist and misogynist. Most Americans don't understand "trade" or foreign relations, unless, as they say, it comes with a bayonet (showing my age)

971424781097631746 2018-03-07 16:38:10 UTC <pauloesco> @Alyssa_Milano @dodgerblue_42 Ya, typically GOP sheep. You might want to try reading. The only tax cut it repeals is the top personal bracket back to 39. EVERYONE else keeps the cut.
971424391736291336 2018-03-07 16:36:37 UTC <pauloesco> @Alyssa_Milano Let's be clear that it only repeals the tax cut to the RICH. middle class and corps get to keep it

971402086733709312 2018-03-07 15:07:59 UTC <pauloesco> @fawfulfan I appreciate in depth argument. But there's a very simple answer here. If there are no guns, you can't have gun massacres. It's like saying kids may get Martian flu or STDs. Sure, they may want to sex up an alien, but if you can't get it, you won't have an epidemic #gunreformnow
971400161799950338 2018-03-07 15:00:20 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @kbo8898 @borrinet The legal argument here is that age, like race etc is a protected class. The counter argument is that it's moot, since by the time it gets to court, he can buy it. And it's not an evasion of court action, since you only turn 21 once. Same thing happened in another college case.
971397639500718080 2018-03-07 14:50:19 UTC <pauloesco> @RightsOfWhites Wow. RightsOfWhites is a complete dick, and earns the rare "insta-block"
971217263889141760 2018-03-06 02:53:34 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @kbo8898 But, the kid isn't going to win a court case, since he's going to be 21 before it can get to court.
971216991154573313 2018-03-06 02:52:29 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @kbo8898 Well, I don't disagree. Except age is a protected class for discrimination, just like sex, race, and religion. And. Oregon has a law setting gun sales at 18+
971128355331358720 2018-03-06 21:00:17 UTC <pauloesco> @johnpavlovitz @ZootopiaCity The part that I always find interesting is how the "faithful" can be uncompassionate, and usually more so than those of us who've adopted atheism or some form of secular humanitarianism
971120500222050304 2018-03-06 20:29:04 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @JonathanRiggeri and yes, that's a pivot on dismissal
971120402859569152 2018-03-06 20:28:41 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @JonathanRiggeri I thought you were taking the same tack, that 2nd A -- all the same though DeFunis v. Odegaard  is the precedent and plaintiff wont get it to court before its moot.
971119131301855232 2018-03-06 20:23:38 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe He's going to be 21 when it gets to court, so it'll be ruled moot
971109667999924224 2018-03-06 19:46:01 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe @JonathanRiggeri Oregon has a law that says you MUST sell guns to people?  Well, that's news to me.
971108481787879424 2018-03-06 19:41:19 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe Pretty sure that's not how 2nd A rights work -- or maybe you think "age a majority" is defined in the constitution. And, ignoring where SCOTUS already ruled in 2008 in DC v Heller (google it) where the court said "Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited."

971077547147563014 2018-03-06 17:38:23 UTC <pauloesco> @NBCNews @sp1r1tharambe Haha. Nope. Wanting to be a gun owner isnt a protected class under title ix  this action will be dismissed with prejudice, which is a funny way to say, it's baseless and it's dismissal can't be appealed

971000091552206848 2018-03-06 12:30:36 UTC <pauloesco> @LaurelCoons Your chart even has "stomach acid" on it. So, adding carbonic acid isnt going to harm your body. And you should brush your teeth more.
970999705164533761 2018-03-06 12:29:04 UTC <pauloesco> @LaurelCoons Yes, and your point is to save our teeth? Stomach acid is about pH 1.5-3. So carbonic acids, like soda, just get added to the mix. As your mom told you, brush your teeth more, and you'll be fine.

970653909139296257 2018-03-05 13:35:00 UTC <pauloesco> @CloydRivers @THEmickmartin42 Otoh a semi auto rifle ban is possible, because we can overturn our representation - in congress and POTUS. And also because of Heller, SCOTUS won't overturn an assault rifle ban.
970653293893517313 2018-03-05 13:32:33 UTC <pauloesco> @CloydRivers @THEmickmartin42 Reality. Even if you could get a handgun ban, it'd be ruled unconstitutional by the courts because of Heller and a GOP appointed SCOTUS isn't overruling Heller. That's why Garland/Gorsuch was a disaster
970447057394851840 2018-03-04 23:53:03 UTC <pauloesco> @CloydRivers @THEmickmartin42 Maybe worry about that when someone even mentions that. Besides, how would that ever happen with Gorsuch replacing Scalia. Heller specifically found handgun bans to be unconstitutional - which is where the NRAs "God given right" comes from.

But then again, you'd be willing to take a recertification course and background check to own and register these firearms, right? There's common ground between, no laws and reasonable regulations
970425761164398592 2018-03-04 22:28:25 UTC <pauloesco> @CloydRivers @THEmickmartin42 And, we don't need to ban all semi auto weapons, just semi auto hunting rifles. Bolt action, even with a mag, is fine for hunting and slows rate of fire in schools, theaters, concerts....

But not all guns need to be or could be banned in America. So. REALISTIC gun control reform is licensing, registration and limits.

And, I'm not a fan or AR15s; they''re just fancy hunting rifles. HOWEVER, any hunting rifle, if you miss, is going to punch a hole in the side of your house and could go THROUGH the house next door too.

Handguns don't have the muzzle power that a hunting rifle (including AR15s) do. So, the bullet can stop a "bad guy" but not necessarily kill -- or at least not like a hunting rifle does - they are 3x more deadly - designed for 1 bullet to destroy the body

968875946836033536 2018-02-28 15:50:01 UTC <pauloesco> @OriginalJLP @RhondasGotThis Also #SCOTUS affirmed in 2008, in #Heller, in the MAJORITY #SCALIA opinion that the #2ndAmendment does NOT restrict -specifcally- WHICH FIREARMS can be prohibited, nor WHO can own, nor WHERE guns can be prohibited.  What does prohibit good ideas? #repealDickey #gunreformnow
968874537373786113 2018-02-28 15:44:25 UTC <pauloesco> @OriginalJLP @RhondasGotThis Two points. First, "assault weapons" is a meaningless term. ANY semi-automatic hunting rifle can do what an AR15 can do. We need to limit hunting rifles to bolt-action. One shot kills a deer. No one needs to be able to fire off 30 rounds in under a minute.
968874031779688448 2018-02-28 15:42:24 UTC <pauloesco> Waiting periods aren't going to make a difference. From Pulse to Parkland and all the way back to Columbine, mass killers are PATIENT.

However, largely semi auto hunting rifles, at best, fire 2-3 rounds a second, as 1 trigger pull shoots 1 bullet. Time yourself with a finger gun... And the AR15 isn't "special" in that regard
967490585568346113 2018-02-24 20:05:05 UTC <pauloesco> @tribelaw @BenjaminBudde @babsbeaty Look, I agree. However, if you want meaningful change the language matters. All semi auto hunting rifles need to be recalled and banned. Not "AR15"s. Not "assault rifles". Limit capacity, caliber, muzzle velocity.

967305472670928896 2018-02-23 07:49:31 UTC <pauloesco> @IndivisibleNet @DMAE2 Look up any ballistics table. There's nothing, mechanically, special about an AR15. It's just a gun...one designed to be light, allow for mods, and allow for large clips. But, ballistically, it's just a gun
967304897921273857 2018-02-23 07:47:13 UTC <pauloesco> @IndivisibleNet @DMAE2 An M4 or AR15 does the same to people on a battle field. Hit the center of mass, body, and that concussive force - 3000 foot pounds - goes in, shatters organs, and leaves an exit wound the size of a baseball.
967303495643746305 2018-02-23 07:41:39 UTC <pauloesco> @IndivisibleNet @DMAE2 ? I'm not sure what your point is. An AR15 or a deer rifle is designed to kill, by concussive force to heart, lungs or liver. Doesn't require a direct hit. We eat ribs, loins, haunches etc

966886514595545088 2018-02-22 04:04:43 UTC <pauloesco> @PrincessBravato @treasonstickers Bcuz in FL, a legal private sale requires no pprwork or ID and can take under 10 mins.

Where do you think the guns in Detroit come from? Where it's easier to buy legally, then they're driven across state lines. Just like we used to cross state lines to buy beer, when there was no federal drinking age.

966787447236411392 2018-02-22 21:31:04 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio Semi auto is still 2-3 rounds per second,  Bolt-Action hunting rifles aren't anywhere near that fast.  Most hunting rifles are 3x as devastating (foot pounds) as all but the highest caliber hand guns

966738245483556864 2018-02-22 18:15:33 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @BioAnnie1 I'm flexible on the insurance policy idea. Are we providing "death benefits" to victims -- and hoping that this "malpractice of a firearm" is going to "price out" gun ownership with insurance?
966737789659185152 2018-02-22 18:13:44 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio @RyanWelchko These are immaterial to the question at hand. Massacres or muggings -- the range is very short (with the exception of the dallas sniper(s))  So, if we ban semi auto rifles, do you want to guess the next weapon, almost universally on a shooter? Yep, a semi auto hand gun.
966737184500826112 2018-02-22 18:11:20 UTC <pauloesco> Teachers are soldiers. And, do you know what MOST ALL mass shootings share as a common clue?  Boys with Military training. Pardon us for being skeptical.https://twitter.com/PackaFleas/status/966718323181477888

ANY semi auto (rifle or hand gun) can shoot 2-3 rounds a second, one shot per trigger pull. There's also little difference in the lethality of the bullets when fired.

966332299733168129 2018-02-21 15:22:28 UTC <pauloesco> @jimmykimmel Misguided and an NRA Strawman -- the AR15 isn't the problem, it's just a popular choice. We didn't solve road fatalities by banning Ford Mustangs, but we did create national standards for licensing, registration, speed limits, and school zones.

966326799566225409 2018-02-21 15:00:37 UTC <pauloesco> "ALONE" is a qualifier without distinction. Your entire interview was "thoughts and prayers" and "gun control doesn't work".  Do you think we're stupid?   @marcorubio

966002827997863936 2018-02-20 17:33:16 UTC <pauloesco> @CNN @ConservEsq BTW, Would you guess that he checked "No" to the Mental Health question on the FFL form or that he checked "Yes" since reports say that even doing so stops fewer than 2% of sales or even CWP permitting.
966002101183684608 2018-02-20 17:30:23 UTC <pauloesco> @CNN @ConservEsq @McTestaInc Agreed; although unless Tallahassee changes the "private gun sales" laws, it doesn't matter. Same with "assault rifles" versus any other semi automatic rifle or pistol. As CBS just used my line -- it's easier to buy a gun than cold medicine in Florida
965997130912428032 2018-02-20 17:10:38 UTC <pauloesco> Prevention is to Restriction, as Reaction is to: ____   a) armed teacher b) intervention c) more guns in schools d) who's going to pay for it, in money AND in BLOOD the next time?
965996715500191744 2018-02-20 17:08:58 UTC <pauloesco> "Ban" = prevention. "Restrict guns" = prevention.  "Armed Teachers" means waiting for a gunman to open fire? And, then have a shootout. DUMB . Let me try again

965987121352794112 2018-02-20 16:30:51 UTC <pauloesco> @Emma4Change @CNN @7bugglettes This is a NRA strawman.  "Assault rifle"? Just "looks". That kid carried a pistol, with the same lethal firepower as that AR15 -- the pistol had the same rate of fire, same lethality of bullet, same 30 round capacity. Banning Ferraris doesnt make the roads safer. Control it all.
965985811542917120 2018-02-20 16:25:39 UTC <pauloesco> @CNN @ConservEsq @jama_jane ^^^YES
965985757276983296 2018-02-20 16:25:26 UTC <pauloesco> @CNN @ConservEsq But today, the background check can't pierce HIPPA. So, all he needed to do was lie and check "no" to mental health issues on a form.  And, even if that had stopped him, all he needed to do was go to a gun show and legally buy "privately". FL has too loose laws
965985380292939776 2018-02-20 16:23:56 UTC <pauloesco> @Emma4Change @CNN @DenaMullen More specific:  forget abt "assault rifle" Limits on "models" -AR15- dont work, Limit how many guns you can own, how much ammo, what capacity (no more 30 round magazines). No more private sales w/o pprwrk, registration, checks, or licensing, demand locks on guns at manufacture.

965982478014885888 2018-02-20 16:12:24 UTC <pauloesco> @CBSNews HEY -- THAT WAS MY LINE !
965982322007801857 2018-02-20 16:11:47 UTC <pauloesco> @marcorubio #RepealDickey as a start. Turn down NRA donations. And then think like a parent -- you don't want guns on campus or in the hands of maniacs anymore than any of us. More Gun Control.
965981542592913408 2018-02-20 16:08:41 UTC <pauloesco> @polishprincessh @Edtbonetaylor1 @Navyvet270 We have armed police / security on site in most all of our Florida schools -- including Parkland.  Anytime you have a 1000 kids coming and going, it's a soft target. More guns isn't the answer.

965980527172845568 2018-02-20 16:04:39 UTC <pauloesco> @Edtbonetaylor1 @starcrosswolf without safety standards, in cars, drivers ed, speed limits and other laws -- the fatalities of students killed by cars would be orders of magnitude higher. It's why we set up the NTSC and why we have these laws. #repealdickey
965978889523638272 2018-02-20 15:58:08 UTC <pauloesco> @CNN @repealNJGOP @Edtbonetaylor1 EXACTLY. And, we do that through a system of reasonable laws. My right not to be killed by a drunk driver, means you don't get to drink and drive. My right to not have my kids shot in schools, means we need better controls on gun ownership, sales, limits on capacity and caliber.

963953071838715904 2018-02-14 01:48:16 UTC <pauloesco> @CarlosGSmith @StopPredators PS. I'm serious about the lack of security, just making a point about who could conceivably come and go. And, I'm not so naive to think all the ladies I've seen in the lobbies in my day are "promotional models for the convention that's in town.
963952582191386625 2018-02-14 01:46:19 UTC <pauloesco> @CarlosGSmith @StopPredators Have you ever been to a hotel? I have. In fact, I spend a fair bit of my life in them and they've never run a safety or security check. Not on me. My friends. My "therapists" or my therapists friends. You live in a delusion that long term rentals are any safer.
