Thousands of teachers spend their own money buying supplies for students, and thanks to the new tax bill, they can't even deduct it from their taxes.
971460188086718465 2018-03-07 18:58:52 UTC <sere_ngeti> @dretiquette @CajunFiddle I don't know what kind of discussion to have with people who just make things up. Why lie and make things up? Nothing you have mentioned has actually ever happened and non-partisan research groups & independent federal orgs can tell you that. Why lie?

Undocumented individuals can't do any of the things you listed & they pay billions in taxes and do work you would never do for the amount they get paid.
