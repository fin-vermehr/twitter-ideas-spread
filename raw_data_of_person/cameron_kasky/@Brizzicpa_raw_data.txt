971963835853635585 2018-03-08 04:20:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LevineJonathan Somebody should tell Elizabeth many of these kids will be at the polls in November.  I dont know when shes up for re-election but Id be concerned if I were her.
971958447070728192 2018-03-08 03:58:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @1kyleshorten @KwikWarren Youre entitled to your opinion.  He will never be impeached anyway and yes they both are awful but for me pence is just clearly worse.  Hey we can agree to disagree on this one. I think we both are on team get those 2 out of office ASAP!
971956994214170624 2018-03-08 03:53:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KwikWarren @1kyleshorten Ill have to disagree with you also. Mike Pences would be so much worse.   He can get things done that useless trump cant.  His extreme religious beliefs are dangerous. Im not living the handmaids tale.
971951819357392898 2018-03-08 03:32:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @1kyleshorten @KwikWarren At least we didnt call each other snow flake, libtard, and all the other favorites
971951500963532801 2018-03-08 03:31:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @1kyleshorten @KwikWarren This is true.
971951241210318849 2018-03-08 03:30:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @1kyleshorten @KwikWarren I have to disagree. Mike pence has more allies in DC and knows the valves of govt. he will be able to push his horrible Christian extreme agenda through. trump has less power. Better to lame duck him then to impeach.
971945753512996864 2018-03-08 03:08:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Alt_moms @ABC Im jealous. I must have done something wrong in life. Have to work on Thursdays.

971083093347131392 2018-03-06 18:00:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @Patrick14073255 DACA people do support themselves. I personally know one in dental school, 1 paramedic, 1 physician assistant, Im fine with ending lottery immigration. Im not paying for a wall let Mexico like asshole said we can secure the border with better technology than a wall
971027761027526658 2018-03-06 14:20:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump As if it has something to do with you
971027631658463232 2018-03-06 14:20:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Give me a break with this. Youre the worst president in history.
971027406160060417 2018-03-06 14:19:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You refused to sign the bipartisan solution that was formed so it was blocked by the republicans. Stop lying to your base. You personally destroyed DACA and refused to solve because nobody wants to give you a wall.

970648451330519040 2018-03-05 13:13:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @krassenstein So the. I guess @DevinNunes we can say the joke trump made about being a president for life are a danger to this country. @DevinNunes you are a criminal and you belong in jail.

While thats not a lot its not a tax cut.  Its an increase. Theres a husband wife combo that wont be voting for trump a second time.
970646529357811713 2018-03-05 13:05:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You do realize bush tried this in 2002 and it failed miserably. You republicans sure know how to kill an economy. Its really sad.

These tariffs will lead to increased prices on products that Americans will be forced to pay. Corporate America isnt going to eat the cost. Ultimately this will lead to loss of jobs in America.

969441870102388736 2018-03-01 05:18:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Kelisia @PeterAlexander What a waste of time and tax money.Let me get this straight guns dont kill people its people and video games.i bet congress could get a video game restriction passed before a gun restriction. Really sad America. Shame on us.

969081448484560896 2018-02-28 05:26:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marcorubio If you worked for me Id fire you today. Oh wait I dont live in Florida so I cant fire you but my tax money does get used to pay you and buy into your agenda whether I like it or now so you know what please resign youre a horrible man and your agenda sucks. Youre fired! 2/2
969079023388291072 2018-02-28 05:16:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marcorubio Arrogance and boasting is only ok for you and the rest of Washington. You stood on  a stage and said buy into my agenda and now you use Christianity and blame the left of smear.  17 people are dead mostly kids and this is what you tweet. Resign, 1/2
969075496792350730 2018-02-28 05:02:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRickyDavila Its really sad that this is going on in America. This is supposed to be freedom of religion? These people are sick and just the kind of people who should not have guns. This isnt normal Im sorry. These people are brain washed and just not educated.

You cant force raising a child because its not easy and being a parent is a serious commitment. Women deserve the right to privacy of body and health they deserve to have the right to choose.

I just didnt want to be pregnant I couldnt believe it. 1/

967572075501314048 2018-02-24 01:28:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @FoxNews Lets see how she does in a mass shooting environment. (Example only) Its so easy for everybody to act like just because they have a gun they will be able to take the assailant out. Its not that easy.

967393974263705602 2018-02-24 13:41:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisJZullo @qedigiv Ive been on both sides of the street. Before I had a kid and now that I do. Where I live the public schools are really good but we pay a lot of taxes. I love ny blue state and I accept the higher taxes for some of the great things we get. Free state college for many families
967393033137377280 2018-02-24 13:37:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisJZullo @qedigiv My point was that just simply paying to send your kid to private school isnt necessarily hurting the funding of a public school since the tax assessment is the same.
967392509948252160 2018-02-24 13:35:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisJZullo @qedigiv That wasnt the point at all
967392344935948290 2018-02-24 13:34:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @qedigiv @ChrisJZullo I dont support using public funded vouchers to allow people to circumvent the public school system. That money should be used to increase teacher salaries, technology in schools, improved curriculums. Supplies etc
967391504267403264 2018-02-24 13:31:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @qedigiv @ChrisJZullo Now yes that is a problem.
967390037900972033 2018-02-24 13:25:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisJZullo @qedigiv Thats not completely true. I could put my kid in private school but Im still paying all the school taxes to fund the public school and the person with no children next door is also paying the same school taxes.
967389085718515713 2018-02-24 13:21:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @EdanClay Ivanka trump is disgusting and as a women I find her a disgrace to women.  Will the evangelicals vote for a Jew? Technically she doesnt believe Jesus is the messiah will they accept that?
967388338742333441 2018-02-24 13:18:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @EdanClay Of course she thinks shell be the first women president.  Not. Not. Not.

Im not convinced any of these crooks will see a jail cell. Washington is the biggest swamp of criminals weve ever had. Morons put a crime family in charge of America.
967281890297372672 2018-02-23 06:15:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PalmerReport @CantLetItbe His charges are all federal.  That was a federal grand jury indictment in a us federal court.
967273177087922176 2018-02-23 05:41:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> Was taking my kid to daycare today and the car in front of me had a hand made sign on the back that said Trumps a piece of shit.  It actually made my whole shitty day

967256569963536384 2018-02-23 04:35:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KMCRadio @CorbieCrow @tedlieu Something needs to change because I watched a video on this very twitter of a man who went on Facebook and bought an AR15 from another private citizen in South Carolina as legal as could be. No questions asked, they didnt even know each others names.
967254799711395840 2018-02-23 04:28:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CarrieSweet2017 @BatosteMel Or better yet let a group of armed teachers protect him. Whats good for our kids should be good for him.

I have guns and my dad is very into guns and so is my sister. They have AR15 rifles.  Some common sense regulations arent going to kill America.
967090727535726593 2018-02-23 17:36:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @jwilsonRealDeal I dont want guns in my kids classrooms. Period

966878818874015745 2018-02-22 03:34:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @Keefer1958 And by the way Im not a liberal. I actually have voted for both parties many times in my life. While I socially am liberal Im very fiscally conservative.

966870598797479936 2018-02-22 03:01:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NRA @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu @catsBneat She gives me bad vibes and she could quit the NRA tomorrow and it wouldnt matter. She just has that built in creep factor.
966869581280227329 2018-02-22 02:57:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews This argument is absurd and ridiculous. These shooters are blowing away kids before they even see a teacher and they usually have a death wish.  A hand gun is not going to beat a rifle and a rifle leaned up against the desk is a no.

While we clearly need to keep guns away from those who clearly are mentally ill this idea that banning guns for only mentally ill people or arming teachers is a #failure.
966535228041957377 2018-02-21 04:48:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt How exactly are they determining mental health. Will anybody whos ever been to a therapist be banned? If you take an anxiety med will you be banned? This is a flawed plan. Will every introverted person be banned?

My mother was given a 1 to 5% chance of survival 4 years ago.  She lived I thanked the doctors and modern medicine my sister thanked Jesus. We all believe different things.

I have found myself thinking the same thing.

Im just not sold on 1 firm belief.

I have a relative who is very religious I find some of her beliefs to make her seem a little unstable.  That doesnt mean she is.  I love this person I just dont believe what she believes

964919728757248000 2018-02-17 17:49:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @VP @JoyVBehar @LawrenceBJones3 @FoxNews Because I believe in evolution and the possibility of life outside of humans and earth I believe in a god because its scientifically possible but Im not buying all the stuff that organized religion is selling with it

Im sorry.
964918487020986368 2018-02-17 17:44:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @VP @JoyVBehar @LawrenceBJones3 @FoxNews I have some very Christian people in my family who try to tell me Jesus talk to them in a soft way not a verbal way. Im not buying this stuff Im sorry.

Why is it the second you speak out against religion your persecuted.  Jesus doesnt talk to people period. Praying and believing is different then thinking Jesus speaks to you.
964914054853746689 2018-02-17 17:26:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @eugenegu Well said. We must make sure we come out in 2018 and vote them out.

963057536130744320 2018-02-12 14:29:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @DuszaLukasz Im an honest hard working American and I hate him so  I guess your tweet is bullshit
962814613451628545 2018-02-11 22:24:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JDiamond1 @BeebleZapp Yes her job is to be head skank at the White House.

962811801325965315 2018-02-11 22:13:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CathyJoeGPT @gpk3gpk Mike Pence is an extremist and dangerous. We should be happy he doesnt hold the top Job. he Just gets to hide in the background because his boss is just such a useless dotard.
962810329116954624 2018-02-11 22:07:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DaGodfather77 @AlexzandraMusic Why is he facing that charge as a minor. That means no punishment. What a piece of shit he is. I hope he gets hit by a bus crossing the road.
962808212893429767 2018-02-11 21:59:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Thats faster than the response to our American tragedies.  Trump the true patriot to his motherland. Mother Russia
962806657918095366 2018-02-11 21:52:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @eljubiladophoto I am liberal. The friends should have been plural in that tweet. Referring to my twitter friends. I just cant support that. They are not raise a family jobs.
962805231598931969 2018-02-11 21:47:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @alisonrose711 @MattMurph24 @Shareblue This is why his neighbor assaulted him. I want to punch him in the face.
962803054750978048 2018-02-11 21:38:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I am not a trump supporter at all. You should read my tweets on that. On this issue I do not agree with 15.00 for fast food work.
962801296981012480 2018-02-11 21:31:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews My liberal friend will get pissed off but here I go. Fast food is not a career. Not when I grew up and not now. 15.00 an hr is ridiculous. These are jobs that are supposed to be for the summer while in college or while in high school. Extra money jobs not a career.

962734827437993984 2018-02-11 17:07:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AdamsFlaFan Tell this rich disgusting spoiled brat to take her horrible family leave plan and leave.

962732895889776640 2018-02-11 16:59:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DawnMarieBer @krassenstein They cant even use English properly.  Probably better off if our Spanish speaking friends are spared the propaganda garbage they now call a website.
962731907682324481 2018-02-11 16:55:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @EricBoehlert See what happened when she spoke. All untrue lies and nonsense.
962731169379966976 2018-02-11 16:52:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TruDatElton @SassyKadiK It will be my turn today.  I just sent some responses to an end of days Texan evangelical. When they get home from church today Ill get blasted.

962727251216338944 2018-02-11 16:37:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SafetyPinDaily Trump will say its fake news you know because of shitty 1 time bonuses and a few companies that increased the minimum wage ahead of phase in state law increases. Many of those same companies had job cuts right after. Dont worry its fake news. The supreme leader knows all. NOT
962726488540893184 2018-02-11 16:34:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SusanKBradford @IronStache He cant investigate that because he would be investigating all his friends and himself for insider trading. Mulvaney is a huge crook

962549255629090817 2018-02-10 04:50:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @birdman8272 Fox sure is. The biggest fake news network out there.
962547605262753792 2018-02-10 04:43:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @InspiringU2 This is what happens when corporate criminals take over Washington. In corporate America the gray area is used all the time. And there are at least 50 shades. Rules are bent and broken all the time. Laws are broken behind closed doors. Now its at the WH. Good job America
962543406353436672 2018-02-10 04:26:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ZekeJMiller Well trump if you didnt fire him and hes so innocent and welcome at the White House why is he not there? Why resign ? Why let him leave?

962403485554741248 2018-02-10 19:10:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you should try surrounding yourself with people who dont have allegations.  Im married to a man who has never been accused in his entire life of anything abusive sexually or physically against a women. If you dont put yourself in those positions you dont get accused.
962402556566822912 2018-02-10 19:07:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CorbieCrow @danpfeiffer The Republicans dont have the balls to put any bipartisan legislation on his desk.

961348728757112834 2018-02-07 21:19:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP_Politics @tech_iceman @DB_Grimwalker @davidcarper I was really just pointing out that canceling research funding over a report you dont like is wrong.  Thats it. I do have issues with the current EPA but thats another topic. Ive had issues with past EPAs also.
961348441355022336 2018-02-07 21:18:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP_Politics @tech_iceman @DB_Grimwalker @davidcarper Really ? Its twitter with 280 characters not a doctoral thesis. Ive read science that links that chemical to cancer as well as science that links many other chemicals to cancer.  We need chemicals unfortunately.

The comment was about cutting cancer research over a report that says the chemical probably causes cancer. Thats wrong if thats what they are doing. Its no secret that it has been linked to cancer. As have most pesticides.  I didnt say ban it.

There is no such thing as safe chemicals. We cant ban them all. To cut off any cancer research funding if thats whats happening over the fact that some science says it probably causes cancer is wrong
961101423172837376 2018-02-06 04:56:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @qz @MattMurph24 @SenDuckworth We did it in NY. Its part of disability insurance requirement its employee paid at a low rate.

The memo was written by a very biased Republican who is shitting his pants because of his Russian dealings. The memo is cherry picked making it useless.  These people will never get it. They cant fathom that there a 3 sides to every story.
959416290480934912 2018-02-02 13:20:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Comey @JacobAWohl Youre getting as bad as infowars. Im finally doing what I should have done ages ago. Blocking this trash from my eyes.
959412247180333056 2018-02-02 13:04:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump We should believe a memo written by a Republican congressmen who is completely biased. Your uneducated base will eat it up so thats all that matters to you.  The rest of us know what a sad display of obstruction it really it is. Youve destroyed this country.
959288494592950272 2018-02-01 04:52:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> Can a Loews store please open close to my house. This Home Depot boycott is killing me time wise. My office is next to a Home Depot and Loews is a good 30 minutes with all the local traffic.  Im committed but its hard.

Not the 1 sided skewed memo written by a Republican senator who should have recused  himself. Release the Democrats memo also. Youre a disgrace to this country. I hope you get voted out in November.
959272848484458497 2018-02-01 03:50:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MidnightRideYC @RepJeffDuncan I am a cpa this is the longest audit ever.  Are you kidding me with that bullshit excuse.
959052868127985666 2018-02-01 13:16:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Its very simple stop attaching the DACA bill to the wall and other immigration cuts. Deal with DACA alone. You and the republicans want to use it as blackmail. Nobody  complains more than you.

957638821784547328 2018-01-28 15:37:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheTweetwit @ChrisJZullo Exactly and 1000 one time bonuses are a scam. Instead of giving a raise its a one time what 50 cent an hour boost for that year. Most of the bonuses are 200 or 300 unless you worked there 20 years.

956369913802903553 2018-01-24 03:35:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 You said its misinformation thats your opinion.  Im sure some tariffs work. Overall they are economic failures. Thanks for the photo montage article and the oped piece. Oh and the non article from wapo. You send garbage as support.  Bunch of 1 liners.
956368572942635013 2018-01-24 03:30:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 Its not 1950 we can advance past manufacturing and evolve and create new industries.
956368364892454912 2018-01-24 03:29:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 I dont care about tariffs that much sorry.
956368248894828544 2018-01-24 03:28:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 Im not in support of subsidizing solar or big oil.  Oil and gas gets an enormous amount of subsidies.  Im not in support of farm subsidies. Im not in support of govt subsidies for any private company.
956367135256797184 2018-01-24 03:24:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 I dont care enough to much to spend more time on it. Tariffs are ultimately a failure.  The lumber tariff is a failure. The United States should be concentrating on infrastructure and technological advancements. The country needs to evolve. Its not 1950
956363855579533313 2018-01-24 03:11:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @DmanfeldDeezy Keep telling yourself trump cares about you. Let me help you out. No one in Washington DC in the govt gives a shit about you unless they are your family.
956363377013592065 2018-01-24 03:09:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @Francanfish Exactly. Restrictions on when you can sell. Appreciation restrictions, dividend reinvestment requirements.  restricted stock can have numerous restrictions that can impede value.
956362036983803909 2018-01-24 03:04:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @g1gary @KamalaHarris Offer them some Koch money that usually works
956360933592485889 2018-01-24 02:59:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 Good for SC. There will be 950 new jobs over 3 years.  Lets hope they dont lose 950 with the solar panel tariff. Again the lumber industry is suffering from tariffs on Canadian lumber.
956360135768670208 2018-01-24 02:56:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 No they decided on that location in 2016. They decided to expand US operations over 3 years ago. And tariffs are a detriment to the economy.  Not every Samsung appliance will be made here. LG has already announced a price increase due to tariffs.  They are not the answer.
956357411790639104 2018-01-24 02:45:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 They did not foresee trump and tariffs. They would have built that factory regardless. It was a long planned opportunity from years ago. I dont support consumer tariffs.  They are not the answer. They are actually causing a problem in the lumber industry.
956352720096710656 2018-01-24 02:27:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crzymom110 The plant was in the works 3 years ago. That decision had nothing to do with tariffs. When we had imports in excess others will tax our exports in excess. Tariffs always pass to the consumer. Ultimately they are a detriment.  Still not buying whirlpool.
956238079160995841 2018-01-24 18:51:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods Im not on team trump but absolutely dont support that. There are extreme idiots on both sides.  No American who give a shit about this country would support that crap
956206779129565185 2018-01-24 16:47:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> *too
956206643385073665 2018-01-24 16:46:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> Let whirlpool cut executive pay, stop stock buy backs, cut costs internally and then they can lower cost of washing machines.  They want their cake and eat it to. Ill officially never buy a whirlpool even its cheaper.
956206238563471360 2018-01-24 16:45:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> Trumps tariffs are not #maga. Those taxes go directly to the consumer. To tariff washing machines to the extent of 50% is disgusting. It squashes competition takes away consumer choice and will end up costing jobs.  Im not buying a whirlpool because trump and whirlpool say so.

Lets get the government going and then start voting on some of these important issues.  Bring bills before the house floor and senate. Vote on amendments get some shit done.
955162113466564609 2018-01-21 19:36:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MTWGeorge @SenDuckworth @Curmudgeon2017 The biggest issue with DACA is for years these people have been working, paying taxes and going to college, buying homes. I know a women whos in dental school. They dont deserve to just lose it all either. This does need to be addressed.  It also cant just be rushed.
955160115174367233 2018-01-21 19:28:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MTWGeorge @SenDuckworth @Curmudgeon2017 I want to see both sides get back to governing.  Compromise.

They can break daca away from this and vote. They can break issues away from the budget and vote. This is all politics
955134917125472262 2018-01-21 17:48:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @thehill @navi_tavi @Secrest_ @BeanfromPa wont like the nuclear option when her party doesnt control the senate anymore.  If one party cant convince a few members of the other party to compromise and work together whatever they are trying to pass into law is garbage and shouldnt be passed.

954954606618005504 2018-01-20 05:51:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PressSec Well tell your Republican Congress to get something done. 5 Democrats said yes 4 republicans said no. Your party is responsible for the shut down. Trump wanted a shutdown he was all about it.

954943386980626432 2018-01-20 05:07:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MTWGeorge @SenDuckworth Its sad that they blame the democrats. They can have an up and down vote on anything they want. They are in control. McConnell voted no on it and then voted no to pay the military. Next theyll say its Hillarys fault
954915989447208961 2018-01-20 03:18:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisJansing Hes so proud of himself. This administration is so gross and incompetent. Worst administration in history.

954899870732705792 2018-01-20 02:14:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @1Jedi_Rey @WheresMyCovfefe She actually voted yes on the bill I believe
954898456077914114 2018-01-20 02:08:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HitchcockDebera He also voted no on the bill last night. I dont care if it was some procedural bull shit it was still a no.

954862684436074496 2018-01-20 23:46:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump I looked at the votes too many Democrats actually voted yes and too many republicans voted no. They should blame themselves. Mitch mcliar actually voted no on the bill. Hes such a liar.

952442560039063552 2018-01-13 07:29:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillClinton @deefiliz @tghw I was keeping it more simple and general. I wasnt even saying it was true. I was pointing out to them that many large charities have a pennies on the $ ratio. Its common and not indicative of wrong doing..

They as recently as today accused the Clintons of using Clinton foundation money to pay for Chelseas wedding. Which is a complete lie. This actually true and this charity lost its right to even get donations in NY.

The allegations of paying for the wedding are completely false. The facts on the trump charity are true. Get over it. Youre dumb.
952402743775387648 2018-01-13 04:51:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CarelessRetweet When 9/11 happened. He had the nerve to mention that one of his buildings would now be the tallest in NY. He claimed he helped and exaggerated donations. All lies and narcissistic bullshit. Hes always been that way. Disgusting.

This money we paid to IRAN was already IRANIAN money we seized. We literally just gave it back. 4/4
952401227127631872 2018-01-13 04:45:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Andrea6Mitchell @pollsofpolitics Its better to have diplomatic relations with all nations and never have any country ever want to use a nuclear weapon. But we certainly should keep our friends close and our enemies closer. Especially our nuclear enemies. 3/
952400690667802624 2018-01-13 04:43:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Andrea6Mitchell @pollsofpolitics We are the only country to ever drop a nuclear bomb on innocent civilians.   We dont have the monopoly on nuclear weapons.  Counties have the right to defend themselves.  This isnt about 9/11 or terrorism. Its simply about nuclear weapons.  2/
952400057034264576 2018-01-13 04:40:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Andrea6Mitchell @pollsofpolitics Let me give a history lesson. The USA had advanced warning about the attack on Pearl Harbor. They let it happen .  They had been working on the atomic bomb and now had to perfect excuse to justify entrance in WW2 and test their new technology. 1/

952392562064744448 2018-01-13 04:10:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillClinton @deefiliz As a CPA I have to say 3 percent is not out of the ordinary  for large charities. Its pennies on the dollar that actually benefit the cause. Smaller charities actually are better. BTW: trumps charity lost its right to collect donations in NY for pay to play bullshit

The Russians not the fbi influence the election. You are owned by Russian banks. The emails and servers are old news and investigated numerous times.
951354550170025984 2018-01-10 07:26:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Its also a top 5 taker state in federal tax funding so really the rest of us are funding the incentives for that 400million. Especially the blue states. Youre welcome from NY for the new plant Alabama.
951353784504061952 2018-01-10 07:23:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You left out the fact that Alabama is giving 400 million in tax abatement and incentives and the minimum wage is 7.25 an hour and Alabama is anti union. 7.25 equates to 15k a year for full time. Can anybody say food stamps and Medicaid.

949142453717618690 2018-01-04 04:56:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 No they need to change the mandate not repeal it. Why am I repeating myself with you all the time. Its getting annoying
949142136259198976 2018-01-04 04:54:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 It takes a mix of many economic policies to increase growth and demand. This tax bill will not get the job done.

949141597211381760 2018-01-04 04:52:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 You even have to ask that question? You realize most of congress are very wealthy right. They own real estate and benefit greatly from a tax cut. You realize they make large salaries and have way better benefits than most Americans. Not just republicans.
949140784242028544 2018-01-04 04:49:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 They need to revise the law in many ways. 50 employees doesnt mean you are large.   I told you that the ACA wasnt perfect. Im not in support of a repeal. Im in support of some changes

Every member of congress and your president are benefiting from those tax cuts along with all the special interests way more then the everyday American or small business owner and thats a fact.
949139694473830402 2018-01-04 04:45:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 I told you I dont necessarily support a 15.00 an hour wage for all and I didnt say ACA is perfect. It could have been tweaked to be a good law. The big pharmaceutical and insurance lobby are a huge factor in healthcare costs.
949139193342541826 2018-01-04 04:43:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Yes it did. It affected some businesses negatively.  It is not perfect. Its fine for the Wells Fargos and Walmarts and ATT. Not so helpful for the 50 employee business that was just starting to turn a profit.  You assume I rubber stamp all these things
949138679284482048 2018-01-04 04:41:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Tax breaks do not increase employment, or demand. Thats a fact.

It will do minimal things for small businesses. Almost nothing for individuals. Some will benefit. I could have written a better tax bill for all to benefit. That tax bill caters to the swamp.
949137904743333889 2018-01-04 04:38:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 What the last tax bill that had to clean up the George bush mess.

If he stood in front of me I would tell him to his face as well as my thoughts on his social policies and economic policies.

Why is that interesting. Almost none of my clients offer retirement plans to employees. I dont know where you get your beliefs from.
949133340938067969 2018-01-04 04:19:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Im a self employed cpa. My clients do not intend on giving back to employees.

949132887256961024 2018-01-04 04:18:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 I asked 1 of them to start a 401k with the new found tax break. I got a big fat are you kidding me Im buying a summer house.

Like I said Im good regardless.  The trickle down will fail and the economy will suffer and the average worker will suffer.  Ill clean the mess up just like i always do.
949131673962254336 2018-01-04 04:13:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Call it what it is. When businesses struggle they need me more. Increase demand increased money.
949131240858374144 2018-01-04 04:11:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Companies only hire if there is a consumer demand. They dont just hire because they get a tax break. I know that for a fact because Im working with clients who are going to benefit and none of them are giving it to workers.  Im glad you found 7 companies that are giving back.
949130177833062400 2018-01-04 04:07:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Whether they succeed or fail I make money either way. Im secure regardless of his policies.

949129092175187969 2018-01-04 04:03:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 The laws are already in place. Businesss are already preparing. I know Im helping them prepare. Were planning on keeping labor costs exactly the same as they were before the increase. Well let go enough workers to keep it the same.
949128453298819072 2018-01-04 04:00:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Keep supporting that moron in the White House. I make a ton of money whether the economy is good or bad. Actually when businesses are in trouble I make even more.  Ill just wait for the trickle down to fail and clean up the mess and laugh on the way to the bank.
949127350708527104 2018-01-04 03:56:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 I understand plenty. You listed a source that said ny had a certain minimum wage and I said thats not true. The minimum wage in many states varies depending on area.

Im not impressed that they sre complying with minimum wage laws in states like ny, ca, wa, mn, where they are forced to anyway. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.
949122819308314630 2018-01-04 03:38:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Youre really proud of those shitty bonuses.

Many states have increased minimum wage laws forcing them to comply. And again who cares about that shitty 1k 1 time bonus.

Let me tell you giving a shitty 1000 one time bonus is a scam. It saves the Corp wc ins, payroll taxes, all the increased costs from giving permanent raises.
949119466188804096 2018-01-04 03:24:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IvankaTrump @kayteterry @Lorenzo_Duartes @LikesScaryStuff @JoshuaSasser818 Big deal a 1000.00 dollars. When att gets a windfall of a tax break, buys back stock pays the ceo millions and gives investors huge returns. Ask those employee if they would rather have a job or a shitty 1k

944667214677979136 2017-12-23 20:33:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @VP @SecondLady @SpeakerRyan It would be great if you would give America a resignation letter for Christmas and keep the raspberry Kringle

944577643327971328 2017-12-23 14:37:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @janlascko @GeorgeTakei They are too stupid. It will take the opposition to rally their base and get them out to vote to change this. I met a millennial yesterday who didnt know what the attorney general was let alone who he was.

944222554700607488 2017-12-22 15:06:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews @OCNaNa2013 The IRS is actually guesstimating the tax tables. They are based on exemptions which have been eliminated. Just because you see more in your paycheck for some doesnt mean it will end up that way when you file.

Although they should have some plans that dont have maternity and other things. They cant do full a la cart because you need sick and healthy to reduce the risk pool.

943532654175113217 2017-12-20 17:24:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Whats sad for me. For the first time in my adult life I wont watch the upcoming state of the union address. Hes disgusting, cant speak and I just cant even look at him. Ill read it when its over.

Thats what criminals do

Would like to keep them out of the mentally ill and people whove done jail time for violence and domestic violence. But criminals will always get guns because they are criminals.  We already have laws and the criminals still get them
943476636124663808 2017-12-20 13:42:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @cmpeacefully @KamalaHarris @raven163 @PamelaPatriot @DSlayer666 @p211shann Youre entitled to your opinion. Gun bans dont work. Smart laws with regards to guns work. Im not the one with the bad grammar stupid.
943476031972937728 2017-12-20 13:39:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DavidCornDC The new tax bill was literally crafted to benefit him. You dont need his returns. As a cpa Im telling you what they look like Ive done returns for hedge fund guys, wealthy real estate people. They are all the same. Structured the same way.
943475647007150080 2017-12-20 13:38:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DavidCornDC He wont pay a dime more. he was pretty much complete phase out on all itemized deductions except charitable. He is a complete phase out on personal exemptions. He paid the Amt. he has all passthroughs and businesses. He has a huge estate.
943474907375177729 2017-12-20 13:35:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @grailsnail @tedlieu My motger in law dr wants a nurse to come a few times a week to do her bandages  on her legs. Medicare is denying her. Its starting already. The dr office is begging them. Looks like shell have to go into the hospital to get the wounds taken care of. Isnt that more expensive?
943473781946896384 2017-12-20 13:30:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @christinadropna @benwikler Im not really rich and my taxes are going up and Im not in Manhattan Im in the suburbs of New York.  You really have some nerve with that statement.
943473318618976256 2017-12-20 13:29:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @foxandfriends @SpeakerRyan @FoxNews Now you know thats not true because overseas labor is cheaper. Numerous American companies are still investing in overseas labor thats not changing.
943472351857037312 2017-12-20 13:25:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @foxandfriends @SpeakerRyan @FoxNews Since you excluded cpas from the reduced pass through rate and cut salt down and took away the personal exemption I get a large tax increase while you get a huge tax break

943299442773577728 2017-12-19 01:58:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @melaniedeppen @Philip_Elliott That dotard doesnt even know whats in the budget. He hasnt read through it
943298779196870656 2017-12-19 01:55:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOP @jj_poitras @dabeard @nanelvisfan @crayoh @MotivatedVoter @tundrawolfqueen They do and the kids send me thank you notes.  And the teachers email me.  Thank you for the kind words. As long as Im fortunate and able to help others I always will with my taxes and my personal money. As long as I can give back I always will.

Im sure you and I disagree on everything politically. But not on guns. I have rifles. My family is from rural NY and NH before we came down state. My dad is a disabled vet. Guns have been a part of my life.

943016055336730624 2017-12-18 07:12:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski @ASlavitt @alaskawater Its like you said a 2 benefit for 1 yes vote
943015721277280256 2017-12-18 07:10:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski @ASlavitt @alaskawater I saw the real estate ones. I was adding to it pointing out that she also benefits from the estate tax change. Its a double cash in for her
943014750149062657 2017-12-18 07:06:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski @ASlavitt @alaskawater Most of those assets are set up as trusts for tax purposes. Mostly to avoid estate tax. So that estate tax change will benefit her down the road.
943013103326908417 2017-12-18 07:00:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods Even though Im not on team trump. That tweet was funny. Im no Bernie fan.
943005988067643392 2017-12-18 06:32:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @alaskawater @lydiadepillis I went to a client today. Small business contractor. Laid off 12 guys because the big real estate management company they work for said they are planning for next year and are limiting the Renovations to a fixed budget. They are using the cash and tax savings for shareholders.
943005004390109185 2017-12-18 06:28:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @cmpeacefully @KamalaHarris @PamelaPatriot @raven163 I have stayed away from this topic on twitter in the past but I am a second amendment supporter and a law abiding citizen and I have guns. Im not going to apologize for that.
943003553202831360 2017-12-18 06:22:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @cmpeacefully @KamalaHarris @PamelaPatriot @raven163 You nailed it. The second amendment is to allow the citizens to fight a tyrannical out of control govt. for this reason I will never support a full gun ban.
942999778262216704 2017-12-18 06:07:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRynheart Were both probably right!
942999621906980865 2017-12-18 06:06:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRynheart I read it and was thinking what a bunch of naive ignorant pathetic people who cant even use 2nd grade grammar properly.
942998510160502790 2017-12-18 06:02:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RandPaul @BillKristol Honestly rand Paul is a libertarian nut job.
942997052388184064 2017-12-18 05:56:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRynheart Im at least 6. Somebody should have told them they dont need the apostrophes. Maybe they should invest in schools
942990564177403904 2017-12-18 05:30:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DanaRohrabacher @carol_dacanay Same for republican reps in ny
942987179634122752 2017-12-18 05:17:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LoriGreiner @darkrider871 Mood rings are bullshit heat isnt reliable to determine if somebody is gong to hurt someone
942930892141531136 2017-12-18 01:33:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RandiWYoung Its bullshit. I almost broke my phone when I went to twitter jail for the telling one of them to go fuck themselves after they spewed the most racist, douchebag shit. Twitter is like communist China with the censorship or a huge trump lover.
942928418357772288 2017-12-18 01:23:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RandiWYoung Its the fuck right off tweets. Im telling you I got reported for similar tweets a couple weeks ago and went to twitter jail. Its sad and pathetic. If a pussy troll reports you and the tweet says fuck in it. They always put me in jail
942924608046555138 2017-12-18 01:08:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn Could you be anymore corrupt. How much Russian money have you taken.
942757359235096576 2017-12-18 14:04:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 Youre an idiot
942757042888101888 2017-12-18 14:02:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 Im shaking my head at you wanting a religious state. Because those have worked so well in the Middle East and other places.
942756869415882754 2017-12-18 14:02:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 I would never live in a religious controlled state.
942756736066310144 2017-12-18 14:01:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 Its called separation of church and state and the us constitution. You dont get it.
942751415788802049 2017-12-18 13:40:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 Also god should have zero to do with government.
942749991952699392 2017-12-18 13:34:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 I didnt say the govt wasnt mismanaging money and in debt.  If they spent money properly we wouldnt have a fraction of the problems we have. Kids live in poverty so rich people can get a tax break. It goes on and on
942749211451420673 2017-12-18 13:31:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @eva_josselyn @KevinKe31392675 Unfortunately the democrats have zero power. They are the minority on every conference and committee. I saw it first hand watching the House ways and means committee. They really no say.
942747472333590529 2017-12-18 13:24:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @0XFatimaX0 No the govt should not be involved in land for homes.  Humans are unable to completely self govern. The United States would be a 3rd world shithole without some governing and taxes.

942644922305392640 2017-12-17 06:37:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Thats the republican motto cheap labor for factories
942644766591930368 2017-12-17 06:36:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Ridiculous.
942640708468559873 2017-12-17 06:20:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Education is the real key to beating poverty.
942640649110802432 2017-12-17 06:20:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 For time allowed and existing children but no future children of collecting. Get these people educated and in good jobs. Not factories and low paying jobs.
942640346797871105 2017-12-17 06:19:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Those are 3rd world countries. Whos taking care of these kids that youre taking away? The psychological impact of breaking up the parental bond and the lasting effect of this oh and the fact that we are a democracy not China it just cant be done. They could limit welfare
942638696985014272 2017-12-17 06:12:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Maybe a single mom whos struggling who has kids but I bet the participation would be very low.
942638538453147648 2017-12-17 06:11:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 That will never happen. A child bearing female would not do that. This is not politically correct but they are always 1 husband away from a change of lifestyle.
942637810451873792 2017-12-17 06:09:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost @cyferPtVila @clfunez Well when you make the rest of the world feel like they are inferior criminals youre bound to become unpopular.
942637111190196226 2017-12-17 06:06:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 I see you have the libertarian thought process.Sometimes its just not a simple as that. Not every child living at the poverty level was born into poverty. In order for a society to overall be successful and progress forward we have to find solutions to these issues.Not ignore.
942635709625720832 2017-12-17 06:00:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @LucioMM1 Perhaps the govt should stop limiting access to sex Ed and birth control and abortion.

Factor in the loss of itemized. Youve been drinking too much eggnog
942590840140070912 2017-12-17 03:02:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Protectaxpayers This is not even remotely true. Stop with the fake news.
942588240627937280 2017-12-17 02:52:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MsCypresse25 @ellevogueandme This is the post where a trump supporter told me the math changes because hes a democrat.

942581297351987200 2017-12-17 02:24:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @4everNeverTrump If we want to avoid a recession in a few years were going to need to redo taxes.  Even with a dem house and senate trump will never sign it. So were 3 years out on fixing that
942580853485420545 2017-12-17 02:22:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DerekLo07352747 @rmayemsinger Is something wrong with African American ? Why are we turning the clocks back 50 years. I havent seen on twitter where 1 black American complained that they didnt have negro on a form

942528997656842241 2017-12-17 22:56:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @erikforCO I didnt take it as an argument at all. My comment referred to the ridiculous argument the person in Texas made. I should have been more clear.
942528692294684672 2017-12-17 22:55:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @paulkrugman Just so you have the background: a Democratic millionaire releases his tax return and explained how he would save.
942528437230751744 2017-12-17 22:54:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @paulkrugman Today a trump supporter told me the math changes on the tax plan If the millionaire is a Democrat.  I swear. I blocked them because of the complete ignorance.

942503667814551553 2017-12-17 21:15:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC As any good politician should. Its called doing his job. A change for washington
942479560712564736 2017-12-17 19:40:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WattersWorld @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @FoxNews This is such bullshit. Hillary is doing a book tour. Shes not colluding with the FBI. She has nothing to do with any crimes trump and company have involved themselves with.  Trump and his team and supprters are just crazy. This is so wrong on so many levels.
942478367395405825 2017-12-17 19:35:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WattersWorld @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @FoxNews @TheZenCorner @Eph51516 Absolutely nonsense. You are completely out of your mind.  Stop listening to Alex jones and Sean hannity.

942477594724880384 2017-12-17 19:32:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @pampylu Im really talking about long term. Here in ny they refer you out to social services and catholic charities helps with the paperwork. Im glad they are around for emergency situations.  Churches arent the answer for long term poverty issues.
942468994250035202 2017-12-17 18:58:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOP @jj_poitras @dabeard @nanelvisfan @crayoh And how many blankets can we buy with the 90 million he spent on golfing
942452118656561152 2017-12-17 17:51:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn I have to say these are my favorite Texans. Ive been taking a beating from trump Texans lately. Ive been to Texas I like it. Im feeling good about Texas again. Yesterday was a bad day for Texas and I.

942411504854413312 2017-12-17 15:09:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jaketapper @awelab1956 @brianstelter Well munchkin mnuchin its called an investigation because things are being investigated. They dont have to make a determination on your timeline.  I cant stand him.
942410805680771072 2017-12-17 15:06:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard @erikforCO Didnt work out. Of course churches dont give out money for housing and expenses and healthcare. Ridiculous argument.
942405683902865408 2017-12-17 14:46:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Alyssa_Milano @KurtDillon7 Whatever his party that doesnt change the math on the tax bill.
942403713599266823 2017-12-17 14:38:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mickey_fezell @RawStory Youve got to love that they vote on shit they havent read. NOT!
942403112131792896 2017-12-17 14:36:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard If 1 in 5 children in Texas live in poverty perhaps the red state economic model isnt working. Just a thought.
942402815825203200 2017-12-17 14:35:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard Id love to help this child.
942402737152647168 2017-12-17 14:34:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jj_poitras @dabeard Yesterday some Texans said its charities and the churches job to help poverty not the govts.  Im going to call my local church and ask for mortgage money and see how it goes. Ill get back to you
942401655571648517 2017-12-17 14:30:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @QuinnipiacPoll @amjoyshow @mickey_fezell Not going to reflect. Period.
942393468311228418 2017-12-17 13:58:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @OrinKerr @alaskawater Thought so. Was wondering if I lost my mind this weekend. Good luck on the warrant argument. Criminals are desperate
942392250155356160 2017-12-17 13:53:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SafetyPinDaily Yeah because thats not a waste of money and helps the environment
942391968079974402 2017-12-17 13:52:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @alaskawater @OrinKerr How are .gov or .mil private emails
942389674789744641 2017-12-17 13:43:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrookingsInst @Harvard @POTUS @dany_bahar @eveldread @BetsyC1219 @stearnol @Tim_Price_71 Tired of trump losers this weekend.
942179731025383424 2017-12-16 23:48:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarbaraMain07 @rickhasen Its amazing they can have a recount when the Moore team and republicans pushed to destroy ballots 2 minutes after election.
942179548459950086 2017-12-16 23:48:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarbaraMain07 @rickhasen Its not even that close. If it changes there will be epic lawsuit.
942124873698209793 2017-12-16 20:10:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @McSnurdRock @DemWrite I challenge the CDC to use them anyway. Lets force trumps hand.  Lets see what he does.
942123228025278465 2017-12-16 20:04:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AndthenIsleep @tribelaw Its true and pasig Ryan benefits from it as well.

942121265288097792 2017-12-16 19:56:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dalsanto72 @Dzikhead It didnt go over my head.  I checked his profile and my comment stands.
942086938546311168 2017-12-16 17:40:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TamiSFGiantFan @JoyAnnReid Joy they dont understand that trickle down doesnt work. Youve nailed it in explaining. Big public corporations actually have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for shareholders and pay dividends. They have no obligation to hire more workers.
942084766144352257 2017-12-16 17:31:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson You too I have to go out as well
942084683311009792 2017-12-16 17:31:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson I like to donate to smaller organizations. The overhead on these big ones is too much. Look at the financial statements for them. Look what the director gets paid. Look how much actually goes to the cause its pennies.
942084043407060993 2017-12-16 17:28:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson I have some very wealthy clients. Hardly any give to charity or go fund me or anything. They arent as charitable as you think. Neither are the in between middle class and wealthy. My middle class and lower give the most. This is part of the problem
942083504568979457 2017-12-16 17:26:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Im not for unlimited govt programs. We do need limits. I support go fund me and Ive donated. Lobbyists are a big part of the healthcare problem, and the government problem. They just wrote the tax bill. Before Im willing to cut social programs I want them gone from govt.
942082494177869824 2017-12-16 17:22:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson I run a charity you have to beg for money. We are all voluntee. Believe me without some social programs the poverty in this country would be as bad as some African nations. Most charities are very poorly run and greed always takes over. Churches have an agenda also.
942080814656958466 2017-12-16 17:15:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Charities only end up using pennies for the cause.  Some government help for the poor and disabled is the human thing to do.
942080628337541120 2017-12-16 17:14:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson They dont. Churches buy real estate and keep all the wealth. The Catholic Church is the richest in the world they own the most real estate. Look at the mega churches the pastors are living in 15 million dollar homes and wearing 5k suits. charities are way under funded
942080110567542785 2017-12-16 17:12:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson @Idjitseverytime Im not too full of myself to apologize when Im wrong about somebody.
942079508613685250 2017-12-16 17:10:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Brown skin or wears a head scarf. And terrorists attacked my home state. I dont care if a person doesnt believe in Jesus. I believe in helping the poor and the disabled.
942079180858187778 2017-12-16 17:09:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson I dont dislike you I dont know you. Maybe I would like you if I met you. Ive seen what happens under trickle down economics it doesnt work. Im not concerned whos marrying who its not my business. I dont care whos sleeping with who. I dont care if my neighbor has
942078470531747840 2017-12-16 17:06:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson They killed 6 million Jews after they started squashing free press, limiting rights of non whites, limiting what people can say and read.  I know all about it. My grandfather died fighting nazis.
942077559113699328 2017-12-16 17:02:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson @Idjitseverytime And you corrected me. You dont make minimum wage. Good for you.  I still dont think youre very educated.  I question how much travel you done. How much have you read in your life. Your understanding of economics. Your understanding of poverty issues.
942076349048610816 2017-12-16 16:57:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson I dont belong to a party. Before the Republican Party turned into a nazi loving disgrace. I voted Republican many times. Critical thinkers dont latch on to party. They think and learn and then vote.

942073521311805441 2017-12-16 16:46:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Your president trump will make sure you get 25.00 a week in his tax cut. Let me see what my 2 businesses will get? Oh way more I guess Ill put that in the market or by a luxury car.
942072774549438466 2017-12-16 16:43:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Enjoy your minimum wage.
942072353403662336 2017-12-16 16:42:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Ignorant conservatism is an epidemic.  Its a cancer but it will be cut out in the mid terms next year.

942071797972946944 2017-12-16 16:39:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson Im always donating money to Texas underfunded schools. You go have an enormous amount of industrial fracking and drilling. My state does have much higher wages than yours and even with the poorest urban areas we still have less poverty than you.
942071458645372928 2017-12-16 16:38:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @Dwvork @LuC4zNytMare @ar_thompson How many times have you been to mine ?

New Yorkers do live there but they also move to Georgia. Florida, Carolinas, Ive been to Texas. Its s nice place but not where I personally wold live. I would like to live in Colorado.

941908406549479425 2017-12-15 05:50:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @SpeakerRyan While you receive a tax break in the millions. You forgot to mention the tax break for that family is only from the child credit because your double standard deduction is 24k before they got over 28k. Hope the kids dont turn 17 then they got an Increase or go to college.

941902754175488000 2017-12-15 05:28:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GetOutUBum @funder last minute they added the special deduction for real estate pass throughs. All 13 members benefit, of course trump and family and Paul Ryan with his vast real estate holdings. What happened to the laws that prevent the president from specifically having laws that benefit him

The 1 or 2 employee businesses that rely on young teenage workers etc.

They will pass it because they have the majority.  At one point they wanted it on the record that the bill was not a 4 nose Pinocchio because one family would save 1000 a year and be able to see a movie. #vomit
941315935989878784 2017-12-14 14:36:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @marcorubio @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @R_Singer1 @Knspal They only care If certain people get the breaks they need and the rest of America will have to deal with it. They are ok with many people getting an increase as long as the energy sector is protected and the small group of republicans who control Washington  get what they want.
941315305674039296 2017-12-14 14:33:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @marcorubio @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @R_Singer1 @Knspal I watched and listened to the ways and means committee meeting on the bill. They dont care if only 30% support the bill. They know it. As long as the corporations and donors get the breaks they want they are happy. They said it in the meeting not everyone is getting a tax cut
941314296637788160 2017-12-14 14:29:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @judiehowrylak @timkaine @WayneScruggs80 Conversation over you are either a bot or the dumbest person ever.
941314117620649984 2017-12-14 14:29:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @judiehowrylak @timkaine @WayneScruggs80 You are not understanding the point. The middle class needs tax relief desperately. They are skewing all the relief to the rich and business and this will not get you a job. It will go into the pockets of the owners and share holders.  Thats capitalism thats how it works
941313591717883905 2017-12-14 14:27:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @judiehowrylak @timkaine @WayneScruggs80 With that grammar I imagine your job is not a good one.

The economic toll in the end will be a big one. Bye bye Republican Party
941312860566810624 2017-12-14 14:24:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MoveOn @PERIlousDefiant Its disgusting. Our only recourse is the vote them all out.
941311915573293058 2017-12-14 14:20:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenGillibrand You know that the Republican in Alabama and Washington will never let this happen.
941311595182948352 2017-12-14 14:19:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepJasonSmith @SpeakerBoehner @JasonKander Thats because you have integrity
941311327246700545 2017-12-14 14:18:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateMajLdr @BeauWillimon Do you think with this corrupt scumbag administration that if this were to happen in trumps last year of office they would delay the vote for 293 days never. The Republican Party is disgusting
941311001428942848 2017-12-14 14:16:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateMajLdr @BeauWillimon The Supreme Court delay was a complete violation of the law. The constitution doesnt say if the justice dies or retires in the last year of a presidents term we delay.
941309979117719553 2017-12-14 14:12:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @KamalaHarris @rob_libadia It does and Its bullshit but you literally have to have no insurance to get any benefit from that deduction. And if you had no insurance you have worse problems then this tax deduction.
941308910182567936 2017-12-14 14:08:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @thehill @AltYelloNatPark It only needs 51 votes
941308762522050560 2017-12-14 14:07:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @judiehowrylak @timkaine Yes actually after watching the House ways and means yesterday they made it even better for the top earners and worse for the middle class.
941308448117018629 2017-12-14 14:06:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MoveOn @PERIlousDefiant Thats not going to happen. The Alabama sec of state isnt going to certify the election until sometime between 12/26 and 1/3. Republicans are corrupt so they will not hold the vote. The bill will pass before Christmas.
941307785576419329 2017-12-14 14:03:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laceyinme @4everNeverTrump I watched the entire live feed of the House ways and means meeting. They arent doing hearings.  They have a deal in place and this bill will be signed into law by Christmas. Its a really shitty bill.
941305843991109634 2017-12-14 13:56:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenShelby @SenRonJohnson @SenDeanHeller @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker @lisamurkowski @SenJeffFlake @SenatorCollins @Linda1746 @TopherSpiro @ltgins @cornfieldgirl @prepostmeltdown I spent all day watching the House ways and means committee. They are going to pass this crap bill and it will be done before Christmas.  Im pissed off but I saw the corrupt process first hand and most of this list has given turn yes vote assurances
941171326471073792 2017-12-13 05:01:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SafetyPinDaily Big deal he is an idiot.
941170131409006592 2017-12-13 04:57:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri It was all about corporate America and the very wealthy.  They rationalize the estate tax repeal because these people saved and accumulated assets and should be rewarded. The exemption is already 5 million. Let me see the average American save 5 million on 60k a year
941169408554295296 2017-12-13 04:54:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri They barge about a 2000 child credit. Depending on income it already is. They talk about single mothers who make 40k with a few kids. They dont pay tax now and get the earned income credit.
941168996421947392 2017-12-13 04:52:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri They are taking away personal exemptions and talking about how simplicity has value, what value? Nobody needs non cash value.
941168794797568001 2017-12-13 04:51:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri How is taking away deductions for teachers and employees, student loan interest, lifetime learning credit, mortgages, insurances, home equity loans, medical, state and local taxes helping and growing America
941167903084306433 2017-12-13 04:48:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri Very bad. It will this time as well. This is a major overhaul with permanent consequences and it is going to pass.  Its very bad for America.
941167051959406593 2017-12-13 04:44:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri It was just all false bullshit. They cut most dems off if they tried to ask for a bipartisan approach or hearings.  It was sickening . Let me say we are NOT a democracy. All this stuff is decided by a few thats it. No facts whatever suits them and gets them re-elected.
941166343629533184 2017-12-13 04:41:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri I know a little something about taxes and the economy. I wanted to crawl through my phone and bust in there and call them all out. Dems also
941166149672275968 2017-12-13 04:41:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri All this trickle down nonsense and they were sourcing open pieces from papers and an economic article written 40 years ago. This is a travesty
941165918826229760 2017-12-13 04:40:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri I saw your tweet was nice. I was outraged at what went on. I want it on the record one of them says that this bill is not the 4 nose Pinocchio because I family would save 1000 while a person making 1m would save 60k alone just on the tax rate.
941163533366018048 2017-12-13 04:30:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jansterling7 I have not once called or referred to him as the president.
941162131134844928 2017-12-13 04:25:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri Honestly while most Americans enjoy holiday music or something else at their desk. I chose to spend all day listening to the details of the tax bill and these men are unbelievable.
941160756913037313 2017-12-13 04:19:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Shaybird49 @alexlynnsam21 @politix_news @ruthie_is Of course they know a predator when they see it.
941160467577307136 2017-12-13 04:18:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri Not every old American is out of touch. Those senators need to go
941160329387659265 2017-12-13 04:18:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepAdamSchiff @JoeBarri Im specifically referring to the house Way and means committee. They are old ass white men and they are out of touch with what the future of America is. I saw it first hand.
941159137207095296 2017-12-13 04:13:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bkat5150 @mog7546 After watching the committee discuss it live today. Its is the biggest scam their is. They all sat there convincing each other how it is for the middle class. Or despite 300m Americans they are ok if it only helps 3m
941158391367561217 2017-12-13 04:10:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoeBarri @RepAdamSchiff After I watched the House ways and means committee on the tax bill you work with a bunch of mean, lying. Old, out of touch and reality people. This country is in trouble
941157553110765568 2017-12-13 04:07:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @grailsnail @thehill Thanks to the black women of Alabama we dont have this piece of garbage in Washington.

941142658164187136 2017-12-13 03:07:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie We have to get Stache elected. Its so important. We need to flip Arizona and Nevada senate seats

941005179725471752 2017-12-13 18:01:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @Real_Assange_ Alabama has some of the most restricting voting laws. Photo Id required and they had police at polling stations looking for warrants and illegals. You lose get over it
940954819107291136 2017-12-13 14:41:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt @mattmfm He will not wait. They are losing badly and they need that tax plan passed.

940845479134416896 2017-12-12 07:26:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @elizabethforma @SusanDoyle1963 Alabama already said they will certify the election between 12/26 and 1/3

940844454969331713 2017-12-12 07:22:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @elizabethforma @SusanDoyle1963 Lets see how fast the scorned republicans in AL certify the election. Then lets see if Mitch McConnell seats him before the tax plan. I doubt it happens.
940843463444135937 2017-12-12 07:18:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SusanDoyle1963 @elizabethforma First Alabama has to certify the election. And the Republican leaders arent planning on doing it until after Christmas or even New Years. They need the tax plan to pass.

Didnt feel well and went to lie down. Set my alarm for 11pm. When I got up and saw I cried as well. Ive had so much built up anger. Those tears of joy made me feel so good
940835919002816512 2017-12-12 06:48:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @Cmusicfactory @tedlieu You should want to flip the house and and senate and make him a lame duck.  Dont root for his political survival. You know they have no plans to cross that aisle. They are after the entitlements next.

The marked minorities as inactive even when they voted in November. That election was air tight on voter corruption. Youre a sore loser.

Thats my feeling. Something tells me there are gay people in heaven whether some of us like it or not.
939868523651846145 2017-12-10 14:44:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @jitendra_lalani @TonyGrayson9 I will say we are not  the perverted generation. You should not say that just because you strictly follow the Bible and others dont.

939635573899309056 2017-12-09 23:19:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> Holy shit. Lets mark today down as dumbest trump supporters ever day. Theyve responded to me today with, poser, loser, buffoon (not spelled correctly) snowflake, libtard. Im still waiting for an opposing opinion with a fact to back it up.
939634865867145216 2017-12-09 23:16:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @ElderLansing @DMBromberg Youre def not a smart person and Im not wasting my education on you
939634593459834882 2017-12-09 23:15:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @TonyGrayson9 If everybody agreed on everything or just did it one way. We wouldnt be a democracy. We wouldnt need a constitution. We would be a dictatorship that just does it the way 1 says to do it.
939633786794409984 2017-12-09 23:12:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @TonyGrayson9 The flag is not just about the military and my dad is a disabled vet and my grandfather died in service. The first amendment gives people that right whether I like it or you like it. Thats what freedom is about
939632286034743298 2017-12-09 23:06:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @ElderLansing The funniest thing about this thread. Is they all think trump is responsible. Zero understanding of economics. Should we tell them ? Let them just be delusional. I need comedy
939629380195831809 2017-12-09 22:54:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @TonyGrayson9 This is not what freedom means and its doesnt not dont
939628626605158400 2017-12-09 22:51:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @TonyGrayson9 I dont define myself as a liberal.  While I personally will always stand during the national anthem I respect others rights to not do so. Thats what freedom is about
939624115635355650 2017-12-09 22:33:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovernorTomWolf @BonniBK @MsDuhMeanor @carmic14 @BookCd They arent my precious Democrats. Ive always voted based on issues. Ive voted for both parties. Im also not going to give away everything to everybody.
939622929998008321 2017-12-09 22:28:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovernorTomWolf @BonniBK @MsDuhMeanor @carmic14 @BookCd Im against lobbyists but your agenda is way to socialist for me. Americans should have access to affordable healthcare and education and with education and trade skills comes higher wages. Im not for free for everybody there is no way to pay for that
939619106650812416 2017-12-09 22:13:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Kelisia @dailykos America is in its way to being a 3rd world nation. But you know they are making America great. Force them to have the babies then starve them.
939618360538615808 2017-12-09 22:10:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SocialPowerOne1 Because he cant run the country he has no idea what to do.  Hes leading by example for his base. Watching fake ass Fox News all day and drinking soda.
939614846773092353 2017-12-09 21:56:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MattArpen @craftyfox4 Im the type who likes to listen to the opposition. I cant listen to him.  His shit is so disgusting
939609148056068096 2017-12-09 21:34:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MattArpen He is beyond dumb. He was born without a brain

939607560671330304 2017-12-09 21:27:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @victorloo_ @AndrewRegister1 @PkDeam2 Nice take on girls. The whiniest bitches I know are men.
939607290486943745 2017-12-09 21:26:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @duke_garry @AndrewRegister1 Stop insulting yourself
939606427231977477 2017-12-09 21:23:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @KazmierskiR Paid for trump bot account
939606212873736193 2017-12-09 21:22:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Anybody who comes out for a rally for you is not smart
939605833196982272 2017-12-09 21:21:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WomanResistorNC I admire him just for being a Democrat in Alabama.
939594651136352257 2017-12-09 20:36:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @amandacarpenter @RobbyMook @rebeccagberg @jaketapper @swerve2987 Youre right his policies are so bad and trickle down will fail in 3 years
939594329177362432 2017-12-09 20:35:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @amandacarpenter @RobbyMook @rebeccagberg @swerve2987 @jaketapper Because none of his policies are driving the economy. He inherited it booming. Lets see what it looks like 7 years from now
939593821276557312 2017-12-09 20:33:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @duke_garry When he shows respect then he can talk respect.
939593619522179072 2017-12-09 20:32:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Thats because you only support the first amendment if it agrees with you.
939576919271538688 2017-12-09 19:26:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mickey_fezell Yesterday some posted an entire market analysis comparing growth of the stock market under obama and the past year
939576490810896385 2017-12-09 19:24:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mickey_fezell Theres been many posts on this lately
939576423995662336 2017-12-09 19:24:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mickey_fezell The stock market growth is actually slower than the previous average.
939576311198208001 2017-12-09 19:23:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mickey_fezell the stock market will respond to recent current events. Nothing trump has implemented has even taken effect. The economy is currently on the same course it has been from the past several years. Even his failure of tax plan wont actually have its detrimental effects for years
939544314891440130 2017-12-09 17:16:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Youre a brainwashed idiot
939544247065284608 2017-12-09 17:16:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Im dont youre an idiot
939538750799007744 2017-12-09 16:54:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 The president you staunchly defend has more foreign workers than you could fathom. Hes bringing in people on j1 and h1 visas to work at his clubs and golf courses . Not because hes an asshole. Americans are too expensive for his profit margin. Thats how capitalism works
939535941030596609 2017-12-09 16:43:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Honest question ? How much could you afford to pay for living room furniture ?
939534877216706561 2017-12-09 16:39:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 You act like I hate America. I love this country but Im not going to buy into the falsity that we are going to be a manufacturing giant. We arent and we should be focusing on making sure we gear our jobs to the future not the past.
939534059256123392 2017-12-09 16:35:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 The phones are already 1000.00 and they are made overseas. Your America only thought is nice but economically not feasible and will never happen.
939533755068370948 2017-12-09 16:34:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CarrieSweet2017 @SRuhle @tiffany3406 Literally the only control. If we dont take the midterms there is no stopping this
939532357031419905 2017-12-09 16:29:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Can you afford a 10,000 couch
939532292912971776 2017-12-09 16:28:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Can you afford a 5000.00 tv
939532132346626048 2017-12-09 16:28:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Im a certified public accountant with an extensive client list in numerous states.  Your bosses rely on my facts and people like me  for figures in deciding growth, rate of pay, layoffs, new expansion of facilities, corporate borrowing, health insurance, retirement funds.
939530942389129216 2017-12-09 16:23:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 You keep telling yourself that.
939530462141341696 2017-12-09 16:21:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Thats not how you spell buffoon
939530208109121539 2017-12-09 16:20:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Really? Im def the person your boss relies on to make those decisions. Like I said enjoy making the widgets until somebody like me says  its not profitable anymore.
939529751965913088 2017-12-09 16:18:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 I got a news flash for you its people like me who decide whether people like you get those jobs, how much you make.
939529284288466944 2017-12-09 16:16:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 While your making widgets. Im giving the CEO your boss the financial statements and controlling whether or not you get raises healthcare or even a job. You keep telling yourself whatever you like.
939528796893564928 2017-12-09 16:14:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Why do I waste my expensive education which I paid for myself on these people. Let them all keep their shitty manufacturing jobs. Ill keep being the person who handles the finances for their employers and tells their bosses to lay them off when the economy tanks.
939527370884767744 2017-12-09 16:09:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @leslieolds98 Let me explain it to you so you can understand. Saying how many jobs created without saying how many left is not accurate. When you report both figures its more accurate. Also neither figure is attributable to the current president anyway.
939526185809272832 2017-12-09 16:04:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CarrieSweet2017 @SRuhle @tiffany3406 Her state heavy relies on Medicaid and it expanded it under the ACA. Shes too stupid to realize that all the signed letters in the world wont make congress act to stop automatic cuts. They want those programs reduced.
939525105310412801 2017-12-09 16:00:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods Now report how many jobs still left and went over seas
939524583169945600 2017-12-09 15:58:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @melakatweets @DavidCornDC How  long before they all take dirt naps ??? Im losing my patience

They are hoping for the end of days. You need to lower expectations. It was refreshing to read your highly intelligent remark.
939522985723080709 2017-12-09 15:51:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MplsMe How about we test his theory out. Blue states stop paying taxes.

939520269907058689 2017-12-09 15:41:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RadioFreeTom @Funkmongo @Marmel Hes going to win because quite frankly the majority of people of Alabama are not critical thinkers. They are beholden to that religious thought process or brainwashing whatever you want to call it. Sad but true.
939519785053970433 2017-12-09 15:39:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ybbkaren @StopTheSpeaker The blue states know all about it. Were getting sick of taxation without representation in Washington. The real tea party is coming not that libertarian bullshit

939379936321777664 2017-12-08 06:23:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JustToSpiteYou This is what happens when people think minimum wage work is values and higher education is lies and socialism
939379130407284736 2017-12-08 06:20:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You just dont respect the constitution. Religious freedom is the foundation of this country. All gods not 1 god. Or even no god. You understand this you just lie to keep your base going. You dont speak for the we. You only speak for you and 63 million ridiculous minions.
939367819363352577 2017-12-08 05:35:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lovetogive2 @amirtibon Any foreign leader who trusts trump should get a psyche evaluation. Trump is a dangerous man who craves the power of a dictator. He is not to be trusted.

939364643151237120 2017-12-08 05:22:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR @lisajonesville4 @happydem18 I cant imagine a 33 year old with a 14 year old. There is nothing ok about that or normal or anything. The way that woman is being treated by the people of Alabama and this country.  People trying to shame her and pick on a year book. Its sick and gross and wrong
939363100163215360 2017-12-08 05:16:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CarrieSweet2017 @democracynow Is that enough for trump ? I remember how disappointed he was when the death count was like 25 and we were comparing it to Katrina
939362808336089088 2017-12-08 05:15:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewjdowd @chrisdonovan @AlanLunin Youre so right. The irony is he doesnt even know the definition of those words.

939359206087458817 2017-12-08 05:01:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR @lisajonesville4 @happydem18 It was wrong and it could have gone so wrong. I shared hoping somebody will see that even I who did that thinks its wrong and so does my husband. Teenagers dont have the development to be in adult relationships.  my story has a happy ending. Imagine the ones that dont
939357780565250049 2017-12-08 04:55:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IjeomaOluo My god it is not right that any American lives where people are gunned down in the streets and hiding for cover.
939356147160633344 2017-12-08 04:48:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR @lisajonesville4 @happydem18 33 to 14 is just so wrong its beyond wrong.  Im telling you 19 to 15 was wrong. 19 is still a teenager who doesnt knows shit about life. 33 is full grown adult
939355145447661568 2017-12-08 04:44:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR @lisajonesville4 @happydem18 Hes 48 Im 44 so you think who cares. Its not ok when youre a teenager. Neither one of us would allow our daughter to do it even though we did it.  We think about now how wrong it was despite our strong marriage.
939354575630491648 2017-12-08 04:42:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR @lisajonesville4 @happydem18 I married the guy I fell in love with at 15. He is 4 years older than me.  When I was 15 my parents wanted him in jail. When I was that age I didnt understand why. Now I do understand as a mom myself.  I would never allow my daughter to date a guy 19 at 15.

939311327604084737 2017-12-08 01:50:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Dont worry there is nothing politically correct about you or otherwise
939304116903391232 2017-12-08 01:22:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @refusedone @joncoopertweets No. I refuse to let trump put an even more conservative religious nut Job on the court
939303666946924544 2017-12-08 01:20:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR So what I made notations by every person who signed my yearbook. Dates, comments things to look back on. If somebody only used first name I wrote the last name to remember who it was .
939301924909862912 2017-12-08 01:13:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ShaunKing If you watch this video and think that shooting is justified youre an ignorant person and youre the problem. That guy was not armed and that cop was in as much danger as my kid watching cartoons
939301307248271360 2017-12-08 01:10:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FtM_MSW @ShaunKing Not every cop is decent and good. That cop wanted to kill him and made it happen. Theres a place in hell for people like him
939300686453444608 2017-12-08 01:08:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FtM_MSW @ShaunKing Murder plain and simple. That cop needs a bullet between his eyes.
939298569072324609 2017-12-08 01:00:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StevenTDennis You have to work extra hard to be as racist as him. He must of raised his family telling them everyday how evil anybody Non white is. Babies are not born hating people who look different than them. Is this the Christian way? Would Jesus support this? BTW Jesus was NOT white

Go get an education quick because your posts lack intelligence. Its like saying Ill be homeless so Im not forced to pay rent. This is whats wrong with America. Idiots
939265563108487168 2017-12-08 22:48:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @JimmyA_Shook1s @touristufo @iamkashprince This argument is ridiculous. Utter nonsense
939265197444825091 2017-12-08 22:47:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @iamkashprince The tax bills causes automatic cuts to Medicaid and Medicare which he now relies on for care. He can be denied care. Thats what his als has to do with it.
939216118744526848 2017-12-08 19:32:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski You need to just stop the bullshit lying at this point.  If fisherman have estates that valuable they are rich. Not a poor fisherman. They can hire lawyers and accountants and protect their non cash assets. The tax cut is not for the middle class no matter how much you try

939143870847377408 2017-12-08 14:45:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPostPol Roy Moore has to be the most morally bankrupt man in the USA after trump. Alabama should lose its federal funding if they eject this criminal to office
939143382055702529 2017-12-08 14:43:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @The_UnSilent_ Is he going to spend his entire presidency making ridiculous speeches on the taxpayer dime. Why do i have to pay for his constant campaigning with my tax money. I didnt agree to fund him
939002791195852800 2017-12-07 05:24:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Kairos_Center @dawsonfmuniv Its disgusting Ive been reading up on it. Im in New York its very easy to vote.
939001529746407424 2017-12-07 05:19:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Kairos_Center @dawsonfmuniv Alabama Alabama ??? What are we to do with you ? Should we cut off federal funding if you elect a pedophile? Moore supports cutting off sanctuary cities ?

The repeal of healthcare is different will have immediate effects. As will cuts to social programs

938999149483003904 2017-12-07 05:10:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @charlesgoyette @tribelaw @dawsonfmuniv People dont even realize that economic policies that are driving the economy in 2017 were already in place from the previous administration. The stock market can respond to current events to some extent but most of the growth has been in place for years and continuing.
938996987365441536 2017-12-07 05:01:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @charlesgoyette @tribelaw @PamelaPatriot @dawsonfmuniv The problem is by the time the trickle down fails trump wont be in office and theyll blame the current congress and president.  Youre point is spot on
938994080779984897 2017-12-07 04:50:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SIRIUSXM @RowenaResists @slpng_giants Can I play devils advocate: most people pay for cable and just choose not to watch the crap like Fox News. Newspapers have many viewpoints you either read or you dont. In a political climate as volatile as this we should make sure we are flies on the walls of everything a 1/2
938991061375975426 2017-12-07 04:38:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovernorTomWolf @BonniBK @MsDuhMeanor The Republican Party is completely out of control. They have no morals or credibility. They will do nothing. Lets make sure they own every word and action and gut them in 2018
938990360067424256 2017-12-07 04:35:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Jukehorse50 Manufacturing in the USA is dead because of cheap overseas labor.  That will never change. We need to focus on technology, green energy and advancing our job market through science and innovation. Because he refuses to do this the jobs he promotes will continue to leave

You choose to insult me because you have no intelligence and cant make an opposing point to me without an insult.  Its proof of your low IQ. Youre not a patriot. Youre just dumb.
938983964919910400 2017-12-07 04:09:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CeciliaNano @JasonHalle Congress uses it as their personal slush fund and now they dont want to pay it back so they will just make it go away

938980363916988416 2017-12-07 03:55:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PressSec @ElizLanders We think when trump learns what civil rights are and respects them then maybe somebody like Lewis would stand next to him. Its called integrity @elizlanders
938975791131578368 2017-12-07 03:37:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski But its ok for trump to stay? Youre a hypocrite

938636722711224320 2017-12-06 05:10:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @alaskawater @clairecmc Tons of loopholes and errors. Thats what happens when you allow lobbyists to write tax law in 15 minutes.

938623521370107904 2017-12-06 04:17:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNNPolitics @jaketapper So in other words they will steal all the money paid in already and refuse to pay it out.  Im 44 but technically Ive worked since I was 14 non stop. Ive already paid in for 30 years. Ill expect a full refund with interest asshole

938569723452772352 2017-12-06 00:43:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomiLahren The fact that you have any airtime in America is the real proof of how far American has fallen.
938565053078560768 2017-12-06 00:25:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepKathleenRice No because they have no morals at all. They just want to ruin the country no matter how many women get assaulted or how many Americans get hurt. Party over country

938532526892683265 2017-12-06 22:16:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 Dont take the high road Schumer because the Republicans sure arent. They support a pedophile and are proud of it. You want him out fire him and then fire Moore
938532280364134400 2017-12-06 22:15:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 And hes wrong. Franken should be investigated and then fired. As should Roy Moore if he wins next Tuesday
938531735435988992 2017-12-06 22:12:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer you need to do your job. Franken needs to be investigated and then removed. If the republicans want to keep Roy Moore and seat him as a pedophile and predator then he needs to be investigated under the same authority and removed as well.
938530729323048960 2017-12-06 22:08:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @alfranken @chuckschumer @ryanobles No @senschumer he should have to be kicked out since the republicans want to seat Roy Moore. Im tired of the double standard. Do an investigation and fire him. No fucking way should franken go and Roy Moore gets seated. Do your job @senschumer. Disgraceful
938510623830429696 2017-12-06 20:49:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kimlockhartga @AP @typicaloutlier Thats why franken should not resign and they should be forced to kick him out.
938489822913748993 2017-12-06 19:26:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @The_UnSilent_ Trump only kills animals  he is the lowest class person ever to be in the White House. Money does not give class. Hes so disgusting.
938489255864819712 2017-12-06 19:24:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SocialPowerOne1 What will these are women do when Roy Moore is seated. Will they demand he resign or demand the senate not seat him. Im all for franken going as long as the other scum bags go.
938488726027735040 2017-12-06 19:22:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Will be there this much outrage when Roy Moore is seated. I doubt it.
938487721294786560 2017-12-06 19:18:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomPerez No he should not. Let them remove him. They dont get to keep trump and seat Roy Moore but franken goes. They all go or none
938487007256498176 2017-12-06 19:15:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SocialPowerOne1 Are any senators calling for Roy Moore to not be seated if he wins?
938486703563657217 2017-12-06 19:14:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomPerez Not if the same senate will seat Roy Moore then franken should be ousted through official procedures.  Im  not going to let one party do right and the other do wrong. Let them kick franken out this way Moore can be kicked out
938486205070626816 2017-12-06 19:12:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kimlockhartga @AP I want franken to resign but not if Roy Moore will be seated. If they are going to seat him then franken should be ousted through official channels
938420714272681984 2017-12-06 14:51:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WilDonnelly Its called dumbing down America. Vote the red out and blue in. We can fix the tax changes in 10 minutes and repeal that garbage
938420041841770498 2017-12-06 14:49:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SafetyPinDaily Yeah pence he believes in discrimination, taking away womens rights, sexually harassing women, supporting pedophiles the kkk and nazis. He sure is a believer.
938419267187499010 2017-12-06 14:46:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 They can pass that. Ny governor already came out and said hes going to court. All the way to the Supreme Court. We shall see how it ultimately plays out in my state
938418729024737280 2017-12-06 14:43:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Does he have an opponent

936960728841490433 2017-12-02 14:10:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Thats not true. Nobody can read 500 pages of legislation written by lobbyists in legal jargon with handwritten garbage in the margin in a few hours.

Not so smart.m are you let me help: Bitcoin is ridiculous at this point. After the tax plan is done destroying the economy it wont be so bad. Ha ha get it
936836385176043520 2017-12-01 05:56:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenatorTomUdall @Redacted404 @woodshedwriter Satire

936833397556572160 2017-12-01 05:44:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenatorTomUdall I can go on but let me assure you any senator that votes for this will be responsible for the recession and they will be voted out.
936833049819463680 2017-12-01 05:42:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenatorTomUdall As a CPA Im in the trenches of the economy everyday. I can assure you this tax plan will lead to a recession. Wait until the stock market adjusts. Wait until all this drilling kills the price of oil with no investment in green energy. Wait until the banks go unregulated.

They have been threatened by Koch and Mercer and the rest of the 1% donors. The tax bill even contains special benefits for conservative hillsdale college a Betsy Devros payback. Its corrupt politics at its finest.

936741412216934401 2017-12-01 23:38:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChadPergram I  wish they would have restored the mortgage interest back to original legislation because several states are going to suffer a housing market crash. New home sales will plummet as will existing home sales. You dont get much for 500k in some states. You get a regular home.

936625196794040320 2017-12-01 15:57:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StevenTDennis @LauraLitvan Then please say you dont support taking chemo away from senior Medicare patients and gutting Medicaid. The double standard deduction is a scam youre taking away personal exemptions. Your giving the middle class nothing compared to billionaires who will not hire.
936624615845253120 2017-12-01 15:54:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PrincessBravato @SteveSchmidtSES The tax cuts are going to send the economy into a recession.  Despite what everybody is raving about. The stock market is over valued. People dont actually look at the financial statements of these companies. It will crash big time and the recession will start.
936623893183385601 2017-12-01 15:51:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jaketapper @PrincessBravato @barmb17123 The Flynn plea is also why he wants the investigation ended. His son is up next.
936623498608435201 2017-12-01 15:50:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lisamurkowski @Redpainter1 Some really small self employed people are going to have to incorporate and have more filing burdens to avoid this tax increase.
936622920381714432 2017-12-01 15:48:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Thats just to deflect the guilty plea from Michael Flynn.
936622680274595842 2017-12-01 15:47:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Tom_Winter @MSNBC From the same man who chanted lock her up. Wonder what he chants now.
936596940883742720 2017-12-01 14:04:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @krassenstein I read something yesterday I blew off as fake news. Did anybody read  anything that the president is claiming inside the whit house its Hillary Clintons voice imitating him on the access Hollywood tape? Thats so ridiculous I couldnt believe even that liar said it.
936593073034940416 2017-12-01 13:49:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @andylassner Thank you Andy but trump can golf less and the feds can pay for it.

936476156722892800 2017-11-30 06:04:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Pulsa48 @JoeBerkowitz Alabama ranks on the bottom in education and top 5 for taking of federal tax money to run state.

936462396255821824 2017-11-30 05:10:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 You made my night with this one.
936462337770323969 2017-11-30 05:09:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 Lmfao!
936462094706335744 2017-11-30 05:08:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 I got a kid of my own to call me names wasnt taking that shit from him so I blocked him before I forgot he was 16.
936461619751718912 2017-11-30 05:07:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 He was just like that but not as arrogant. He had bad language and was calling me names.
936461057111019520 2017-11-30 05:04:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 He tells me you cant read beyond elementary after he said his dad reads the most complicated code. I said oh I thought that I read the most complicated code according to Republicans since I read the us tax code. He didnt even know what I meant
936459792830300161 2017-11-30 04:59:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 If he only knew Obama saved his daddy job.
936459703152009216 2017-11-30 04:59:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SuplexCity55008 I pelted him with facts but he was 16 and was repeating Fox News and Ann Coulter. I just blocked him.   His dad is a legal Mexican immigrant whos daddy works as an engineer supposedly for the auto industry.
936458605276073984 2017-11-30 04:55:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SafetyPinDaily So let me understand. It was socialists and LGBTQ people who tried to force the 14 year old to suck his dick?
936457560785383425 2017-11-30 04:50:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> This is a new low for me.
936457205401956353 2017-11-30 04:49:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> I really do. Its a bad day when you argue politics with a 16 year old from Michigan. I blocked him also just because he was really annoying.
936456756028420096 2017-11-30 04:47:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA I have better things to do now Jose.

936455851791003648 2017-11-30 04:44:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Like I said I read the most complicated code there is. The IRC code. The one that says your tax dependent of your parents.
936455428195717120 2017-11-30 04:42:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Good for him. Im glad he has a job in the auto industry. The walll wont be made of bricks little man.  Study hard and you can be just like pops.

936454701524160513 2017-11-30 04:39:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA According to your conservatives I read the most complex code there is. Called the tax code. Since it needs such an overhaul.
936454074513412098 2017-11-30 04:37:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Please do go on and on. We need engineers. What is he working on now?  He can help build the wall you like that my taxes pay for.
936453651064938496 2017-11-30 04:35:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Still waiting on dads job and skills ?

936451633071915008 2017-11-30 04:27:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA He wants to push a plan to severely limit legal immigration into this country. You only listen to his propaganda. Youre a child you have lots to learn and read.
936451258231160834 2017-11-30 04:25:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA You sit over there in your bedroom and get ready for school little boy. You dont know shit about anything.
936451041708699649 2017-11-30 04:25:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Your president doesnt support you or minorities. As a matter of fact he wants to stop all immigration from Mexico legal or otherwise. He has a whole list of countries.

They better never need any assistance when they do arrive because theyll pay taxes but be ineligible for help. They better speak
936450123739160576 2017-11-30 04:21:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Did she come to your bday party. Is she your friend. You sound like a child in your tweets.  You want to play with the grown ups lets play. Liberal. A liberal is a person who lets immigrants like you come to the country. Your beloved trump wants to eliminate legal immigration.
936449591406481408 2017-11-30 04:19:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Since youre a child Ill explain twitter to you. The comment was for Ann Coulter and her wall remark. It always goes to the people on the post. You felt compelled to respond. Youre a teenage with nothing but what your parents give you. You know ann Coulter good for you
936448597817733121 2017-11-30 04:15:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DewDropInn222 @kylegriffin1 Good. We dont want that garbage here anyway.
936448149899575297 2017-11-30 04:13:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @renato_mariotti Yes but nobody will do anything about it.
936447224946491397 2017-11-30 04:09:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA I commented to ann coulter and you posted a wise ass remark
936447071464443904 2017-11-30 04:09:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA Then be more appreciative for what you have in America. Dont you dare try and be a wise ass to me. Youre a child living off your parents. Ann Coulter is a rich elitist who could give 2 shits about you or your family.
936445742381715456 2017-11-30 04:03:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA When you can support a child, fund a retirement account, get a college degree, pay a mortgage, utilities, support a home then come talk to me. Until then back on mamma tit.
936445242928193536 2017-11-30 04:01:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AnnCoulter @carlosrMAGA What little boy. Keep living off mommy and daddy. You dont know shit about life.

936436683544977408 2017-11-30 03:27:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SteveRudinABC7 @SweeneyABC Can we really piss trump off and post a side by side with one of Obamas
936423629151195136 2017-11-30 02:36:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNewsTHINK @NBCNews We are already torn apart.
936412131523743745 2017-11-30 01:50:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> Really bigotry against southerners.  No its bigotry against pedophiles and child rapists
936377732929335296 2017-11-30 23:33:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr Try to stop lying please
936377693511344128 2017-11-30 23:33:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr Giving 12 and taking away 8 for a married couple is not double. Its giving them 4
936377551253131264 2017-11-30 23:32:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr You took away the personal exemptions which offsets your doubling of the standard deduction make sure you post that
936377398894972928 2017-11-30 23:32:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr But if your middle class that itemizes your screwed. The tax credit was already 2000 depending on income and liability. Im sure its not refundable so its basically the same
936326060127477766 2017-11-30 20:08:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jimmykimmel @MooreSenate jimmy just burnt your ass. Youre not a Christian. Youre a pedophile and human scum
936317736858382336 2017-11-30 19:35:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump This is a ridiculous statement. When your democratic predecessor left it wasnt half idiot. It will be half after your trickle down tax cut fails and the housing market collapses.
936316550558224384 2017-11-30 19:30:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Now thats a happy ending.
936316456312213504 2017-11-30 19:30:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @ViewFromWise The shit people in this country get paid for is ridiculous.
936305687780577281 2017-11-30 18:47:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WilDonnelly @LindseyGrahamSC  you know what concerns me your tax plan for the rich that will lead us into a recession, the huge cost of health insurance. Lack of human rights in the USA, By the way, he is a kook and unfit and the press speaks the truth. Maybe you should resign. Its time.
936288252885168131 2017-11-30 17:38:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MHGURU The censorship is getting ridiculous. And she is a complicit bimbo.
936100572914225152 2017-11-29 05:12:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> Have you been refused this request as part of discovery in your lawsuit? Of course not. You dont have knowledge or respect for the law.

936096961236799488 2017-11-29 04:58:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laura_styron Its not 1950. Im a great mother and I work hard and support my entire family and my mother and my mother in law. My child is under 4 and goes to a day care program where she learns to socialize and arts and crafts and books. Youre whats wrong with the country Laura.

936093496511025153 2017-11-29 04:44:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Slate @SafetyPinDaily He already is. Anybody trump appointed in the current administration is already the worst in history.
936087465282232320 2017-11-29 04:20:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jeffspross @taninthesummer @SafetyPinDaily Im sorry in advance for insulting you curious George

936086613532258304 2017-11-29 04:16:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PMueller2 @jdice03 Thats probably the only truthful thing hes ever tweeted.
936085584417837056 2017-11-29 04:12:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @activist360 Whats very wrong with America is kanna @keys1961
936084969721618432 2017-11-29 04:10:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @activist360 @fashionsizzle1 @keys1961 Whats up in Ohio they didnt teach reading comprehension. He said he just kisses them, grabs them.  Those women are not lying. You actually believe all 13 are lying. Youre either mentally ill will delusion or just fucking stupid. My guess is the latter.
936074277060784128 2017-11-29 03:27:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> dozens of people followed me and 2 people unfollowed me // automatically checked byhttp://fllwrs.com
936071452356464640 2017-11-29 03:16:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @11thHour Except one video didnt even have a Muslim in it.

936056375423197184 2017-11-29 02:16:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @lovetogive2 @DanMathewsBooks The problem is the person who beat up the crippled kid was not even a Muslim. Thats the problem with the posting of non fact checked videos by somebody as powerful as the president of the United States
936055240989794304 2017-11-29 02:12:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Im a cpa I understand it.  Believe me your Republican Party and you will get all the credit. You own that garbage bill and youll see the consequences.
936053532075216896 2017-11-29 02:05:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BradThor @miketomaro @rleonekc @own_the_game Can you give  me your examples of how it is abused?
936051811944992771 2017-11-29 01:58:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SteveRattner Its such a lie. What he saves on the schedule e pass through from 39.6 to 25 thats almost 15 percent. The amt the estate tax, the overseas tax breaks, tens of millions is putting it mildly
935998481390555136 2017-11-29 22:26:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeraldoRivera What are you next? Scared? Setting up your defense?
935997258021171201 2017-11-29 22:21:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RichardRubinDC Oh stop! Ive been to Colorado its a great place.  Dont be a little sad over that silly thing.  You should hear what people say about my state. NY
935979782277337088 2017-11-29 21:12:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RichardRubinDC I know I was just pointing out that Colorado had been progressive with its economy
935974125981634562 2017-11-29 20:49:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RichardRubinDC Marijuana helped that. Other states should take a look
935974000991391744 2017-11-29 20:49:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @RichardRubinDC That plan was a horror Sam brownback and created zero jobs and was repealed. Ive never seen a bunch of people lie and want to hurt America in the name of ideology so badly as the Republican Party. Sad and pathetic.
935947743503187968 2017-11-29 19:05:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SocialPowerOne1 Pat Roberts is a disgusting person who preys on weak minded people and robs their money from them.  Im sure in his warped mind. Woman living in sexual servitude would be fine with him. Hes so gross. Time for the coffin.
935931837846867969 2017-11-29 18:01:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @musicwithmyra @SenSchumer Thats to buy murkowski vote. Shes owes that to her deceased dad.
935931641851150337 2017-11-29 18:01:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JW4Resistance @SethAbramson I demand an investigation of the sexual harassment claims against trump.
935925731082809344 2017-11-29 17:37:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JeffFlake @StashCleveland Im blocking your ass your all trump rhetoric no real points.
935925476039766017 2017-11-29 17:36:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JeffFlake @StashCleveland We dont look up hoe much ny federal taxes are paid and what we receive back. We get back .79 on the dollar. Were not a taker State we support ourselves. Your from a taker state Im sure.
935911102227144705 2017-11-29 16:39:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JeffFlake @StashCleveland No are taxes are high because we are self sufficient.
935893280029593601 2017-11-29 15:28:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRickyDavila @thisage Yes that too. I really need the entertainment he provides me on twitter.

935880834896355328 2017-11-29 14:39:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods What ridiculous nonsense study is that.
935880527055392768 2017-11-29 14:38:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump We should boycott you on twitter except where would I get my stand up comedy for the day
935880340551462912 2017-11-29 14:37:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Its the same stock market since 2010. What policies have you implemented to change it. You got handed a booming economy
935880133222785024 2017-11-29 14:36:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump What policies? Name 1
935880037710094336 2017-11-29 14:36:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump No thats def not it.
935879912661114881 2017-11-29 14:35:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Cant wait until they fire you for the same thing.
935879645152645121 2017-11-29 14:34:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRickyDavila Why is Matt layer his concern. Im not defending him i have zero facts but it seems its not a presidential matter
935868570831065089 2017-11-29 13:50:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @COGICFamily @TalbertSwan @jlsherf Its satire.
935748820633309185 2017-11-28 05:54:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mcspocky Or a white male Democrat.
935742235504726016 2017-11-28 05:28:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Kris_Sacrebleu Shes says this when trump tweeted about the election, the nfl, a contest about fake news, getting stood up by Democrats, Xmas decorations at the White House. Should I go on.
935736357217099776 2017-11-28 05:05:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenatorDurbin We all know trickle down fails. Im sure you remember October 1987. These corporations are not going to hire more workers and increase wages. Its going to shareholders/executives. 30% are foreign s/h. Tax cut for USA rich and overseas investors.  Shameful.
935733571226144768 2017-11-28 04:54:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Amber_Addison_ @RiverdivaNM @jlcphotother @RobinBrenizer @DC2CA @stearnol @psstricia @JadedCreative @LoolooMagdalena @RoseResists214 @ChiefCovfefe @Jr3597 @arabnhorse1 As much as I want him gone. Its very very very hard to remove a sitting president. In the mean time we have to start in our home town and move up taking every position from red to blue.
935731429312532481 2017-11-28 04:45:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Amber_Addison_ @RiverdivaNM @jlcphotother @RobinBrenizer @DC2CA @stearnol @psstricia @JadedCreative @arabnhorse1 @LoolooMagdalena @RoseResists214 @ChiefCovfefe @Jr3597 If the market adjusts then yes that soon but if not it will probably take a few more. If this country doesnt start focusing on jobs of the future instead of TRUMPS jobs of the past. Were going to be so far behind China and Europe in economy and power and wealth well be a joke
935729480227803137 2017-11-28 04:37:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Amber_Addison_ @RiverdivaNM @jlcphotother @RobinBrenizer @DC2CA @stearnol @psstricia @JadedCreative @arabnhorse1 @LoolooMagdalena @RoseResists214 @ChiefCovfefe @Jr3597 Once they pass it. They own the consequences and they will suffer from them. The trickle down will fail and be obvious in about 3 years
935728870799675394 2017-11-28 04:35:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Amber_Addison_ @RiverdivaNM @jlcphotother @RobinBrenizer @DC2CA @stearnol @psstricia @JadedCreative @arabnhorse1 @LoolooMagdalena @RoseResists214 @ChiefCovfefe @Jr3597 I got to be honest theres probably not going to be any. The republican will not lose on this matter. They will do whatever it takes to pass it.
935728048883798016 2017-11-28 04:32:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business The companies getting the tax breaks will use the money to invest in this technology and then get rid of the American worker. Ironic. I didnt read the article. Off cuff comment.

935719598321815552 2017-11-28 03:58:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @scb1932 @rodellca @PamelaPatriot No worries
935718644503535616 2017-11-28 03:54:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @scb1932 @rodellca @PamelaPatriot I was joking about the seceding. We are the USA
935718381545840640 2017-11-28 03:53:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @scb1932 @rodellca @PamelaPatriot In my daily life I dont care whos marrying who, whos sleeping with who and what sex they are, I dont care if men become women. Vice versa. Who am I to judge others. What others do is their business. Why is this so hard for them.
935717833887109120 2017-11-28 03:51:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @scb1932 @rodellca @PamelaPatriot Im in very liberal Ny. I knew the south and Midwest were different Ive been there. Not until trump did I realize Im educationally and progressively not even on the same planet as these people.

935713967368032256 2017-11-28 03:36:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @docdaddio23 @EdKrassen Trump has no respect for native Americans. His rant before congress in the 90s over casinos was so filled with hated and bigotry. That suddenly went away. Not.
935713193825132549 2017-11-28 03:33:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @joimonki @CelticWombat Even trump should be able to understand it.

935712808083378176 2017-11-28 03:31:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @renato_mariotti Well i question if trumps college degree is real.

935710566206836737 2017-11-28 03:22:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump The job producers as you call them the big billionaire corporation wont take 1 cent of that tax savings and higher people or increase wages. They will give it to executives and shareholders. 30% of sh are foreign you gave the foreigners a tax break
935710043202379778 2017-11-28 03:20:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Rand Paul a libertarian whacko
935709953544908800 2017-11-28 03:20:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump More with the NFL... its called free speech. 1st amendment. Read the constitution if you can read. Btw: all amendments apply not just the ones you like
935708622520233985 2017-11-28 03:14:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Your tax bill is the bill that raises taxes on middle class people like myself. Im getting an increase. You caused my premiums to skyrocket. They want to save Daca not letting  floods of people in.
935708079714381824 2017-11-28 03:12:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Great for your billionaire friends and yourself

935387992428081152 2017-11-27 06:00:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Yes set up s Corp do payroll at lower amount do s distributions. Much more record keeping more tax filings. Certain cities dont recognize s corps tax earnings,
935386828819124224 2017-11-27 05:56:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist A nice little break for a small schedule c would have been nice.

935386319626428416 2017-11-27 05:54:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump New home sales will be zero with your tax bill. When you kill the market with the limits on mortg, loss of state tax deduction and prop tax ded limits and loss of pmi deduction.
935385040099446784 2017-11-27 05:49:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Youd pay 38k on your 100k
935384944167280640 2017-11-27 05:48:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Exactly thats a lot
935384789384867840 2017-11-27 05:48:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Your not selfish but if you profited 100k and you are just you no employees. Starting at 15k before your federal income tax is a lot of money. An employee who makes the same 100k starts at 1/2 the ss and mc
935384143571058690 2017-11-27 05:45:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @blue_activist @Hillybean444 Its is a shitty bill. I dont know why the AICPA seems to like most of it
935383935961518080 2017-11-27 05:44:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @blue_activist @Hillybean444 Plus on the real big real estate flow throughs like Mr trumps is really getting a big benefit out of the 25% cap instead of 39.6. Im not totally on board for that. Real estate is always where the money is. They will get all the tax breaks.
935382894419365889 2017-11-27 05:40:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @blue_activist @Hillybean444 You know the tax starts at 15k before you pay on the 100k I would of liked to see them give a bit of a break on that
935382638696779781 2017-11-27 05:39:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @blue_activist @Hillybean444 I agree with the 25% but you know for a schedule c with no employees and they come in at that 100k that 15.3 is a killer.
935381556587266051 2017-11-27 05:35:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Home office is fine. Its schedule c

Instead of giving big corps all the breaks they need to give sole proprietorship schedule c a break on the matching self employment tax.
935377495418916864 2017-11-27 05:19:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @molosgatos @naomirwolf @Hillybean444 @blue_activist Sorry I was commenting to the other CPA. They are all the things like educator expenses over 250.00, employee unreimbursed exp, union dues, safe dep, tax prep fee, uniforms, job search costs, any expense related to employment/income and others, gambling loss, legal tax advise
935375729851813888 2017-11-27 05:12:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @renato_mariotti @cyferPtVila @djmulryan I know I meant they sneaky as putting things in and out of the bill. Not all those senators read it all and sneaky amongst themselves with access in changes etc. bottom line they are buying the votes with drilling for you and this for you. They have a good shot at it passing.
935225155583987712 2017-11-27 19:13:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MrsScottBaio Sometimes I wasted my time responding to assholes on twitter. Let me correct that now. Blocked

935215857692823552 2017-11-27 18:36:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> Since thanksgiving I just cant tolerate the trumpkins. I usually ignore their comments or just laugh at it. The ones that have been commenting are so sad and the profiles all Hillary and blll I have been on a blocking spree. You cant talk to them.

Whats sad is he knows hes full of shit and praying on weak minded people. He doesnt believe that crap he spews. He just takes their money. And those people dont have it to give. They suffer because they believe hes a profit of god.

Like Rachel Maddow. Shes a talk show. They arent news. They are opinions.  I have only blocked 10 Accts. Im not listening to garbage. They are meant for entertainment
935150105665200129 2017-11-27 14:15:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Thankfully that whacko is gone. Im sure this feed is full of race comments. That is irrelevant to me. It makes it even more egregious and ridiculous. Her comments were literally threats to the lives of babies in that hospital which is the biggest issue. She should be arrested.

Its only a fair contest if the vote includes all news agencies. You like rigged things like the election.  Fox is fake news. Ask hannity he said hes not news hes an opinion talk show.

Its a cartoon depiction of love with no gender implication at all. They wont be happy until Jesus adorns the cup.
935029030776078336 2017-11-26 06:14:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SlythSeeker2017 @nowthisnews Im very mixed on this. While I personally since a child and to this day feel extremely uncomfortable hugging and kissing people even my own immediate family I have a 20 month old and I see how important hugs are for her and how she hugs me and daddy and grams and grandpa.

Everybody seemed to be screaming about it. It went on all night and I dont understand any of the thread. I said thanks for explaining it and went on posting.
935015159684268032 2017-11-26 05:19:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SKWaller @RobinBrenizer Dont forget melania commented on it as well in an interview!

934997337331654656 2017-11-26 04:08:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DeepInTheHills @MichaelSLinden By limiting the mortgage interest deduction and taking away the PMI deduction and real estate tax deduction they are killing are housing market and will cause a collapse. New home sales will stall and foreclosures will increase. I know many think were all rich 2/
934996522634276864 2017-11-26 04:05:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DeepInTheHills @MichaelSLinden I loved the thread. Dont forget in ny we pay a lot into the federal tax system way more than what we receive in benefits. Many middle class families have homes that sell here for more than 500,000 and they are regular homes that probably would be 200 or 300 somewhere else 1/

934978052039331840 2017-11-26 02:51:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tedlieu He is lying he apologized and had his wife talk about it as well.

Im going to quit twitter. This is such censorship. I didnt even curse: he supports child rapists and Im limited.
934951503953088512 2017-11-26 01:06:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @krassenstein Utter incompetence in every facet of the White House. How many years will it take to reverse the damage. Will we be able to reverse the drilling damage on the opened up areas even if they kicked out years down the road.  USA destroyed.

The rich will own everything and the workers will basically take whats given and die with nothing. Theyll have no voice and we will not be a democracy.
934848695174074368 2017-11-26 18:17:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lovetogive2 @Tahoesquaw1 My comment was really just a joke.  Its disgusting the agenda hes pushing. We literally have a handful of people now making us policy. Youre 100% correct.
934845793600770050 2017-11-26 18:06:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 This is so serious. Could you imagine where th USA will be if this attitude continues. This is fascism and people better wake up.
934845192724676608 2017-11-26 18:03:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bravenak Trump being elected has sure shown everybody for who they truly are.
934843790371811335 2017-11-26 17:58:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lovetogive2 @Tahoesquaw1 Totally unrelated to the retweet but I seriously think he so fucking ugly and gross. Then he opens his mouth and its just a race to whose more gross him or trump ?
934842926076657664 2017-11-26 17:54:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chick_in_kiev @RadicalGoats @Cassius614 They know that they arent wanted here in this country, and they arent supported here by fellow Americans and most importantly that the government doesnt support them. Thats not happening and its dangerous.
934842531304665088 2017-11-26 17:53:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chick_in_kiev @RadicalGoats @Cassius614 How can trump have a Jewish family and accept support from nazis and kkk. How can Jared and ivanka even look at him. Its all fake bullshit in the name of power and money and its ruining this country. He needs to denounce the nazis and kkk and make sure
934839292618330113 2017-11-26 17:40:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @sketchpads19 @TheTweetwit How much ?
934838988099280896 2017-11-26 17:39:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> You are clueless about net neutrality. Hope you have a lot of disposable income because youll see 49.99, 9.99, 39.99 when isp provides charge to view content owned by other corporations. Better tell a lot of jokes and write some more books.
934835953037914112 2017-11-26 17:27:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AMagidB @nowthisnews @LynSojak Ill point fingers at all of them. IF the USA. wants to stick its big fat ass into everything while children are dying and they pick sides then could do more to make sure humanitarian help go through.
934694588668891136 2017-11-26 08:05:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Nitemists @JoyAnnReid He did get OJ off correct? Hes good at peddling bullshit
934689516371275776 2017-11-25 07:45:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LunaLuvgood2017 @KellyRH312 Hey twitter youre really acting very much like  communists lately.  Really with this nonsense.  Who on twitter hasnt posted a screenshot of blocking and commented. I call bullshit on twitter.
934676151427092481 2017-11-25 06:52:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @Suenorr11888815 Its only good if your oil and gas oh yeah and Ivankas retail business.
934671423989272576 2017-11-25 06:33:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid @romanticskeptc @renato_mariotti Im 1 American with eyes open I see it clearly. My grandpa died fighting nazis and Ill do the same if necessary. Ill never live in a fascist USA. Never.
934670367557406720 2017-11-25 06:29:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @blakehounshell @hobodeluxe @USAARMYVETERAN Stand up comedy at this point
934666769914040321 2017-11-25 06:14:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Sophia_Auston @Lorry_william I have to be honest. I dont care and I think he  is a fraud and always have. Jesus is not about  14 million dollar homes and $10,000 in clothes and accessories on any given day and lavish vacations and stock accounts all tax free. Fuck Joel Osteen. Hes disgusting.
934657414200217601 2017-11-25 05:37:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AdamParkhomenko My sister and her husband whose Puerto Rican voted for trump. I slammed my sister over and over. Once she had to get trump care and the hurricane devastated his family in pr how the tides have turned. Now they want him impeached. Sometimes ignorance can be flipped.
934655165092810752 2017-11-25 05:28:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AdamParkhomenko Shes def New York or New Jersey. She sounds like me everyday.
934651739747340289 2017-11-25 05:15:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LunaLuvgood2017 I checked out the Lincoln bible one. Be glad your blocked. Its incoherent nonsense and all retweets mostly
934647852579639296 2017-11-25 04:59:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> This is a Christmas gift from Ricky Davila to @realDonaldTrump.  Merry Christmas Donny boy. Can you put together something with a bunch of Hillary for him? Lets put the merry back in Christmas.https://twitter.com/therickydavila/status/934447621330145281
934646764333862912 2017-11-25 04:55:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @blakehounshell @hobodeluxe Thats why we have a Sean Hannity, tucker whatever his name is and the rest of them.  They arent a news agency they are talk show entertainment. No fact checking required.
934646196802588672 2017-11-25 04:53:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @blakehounshell @hobodeluxe Foxnews will be exempt because they arent registered as a news agency like cnn. They are registered as an entertainment network.
934642117602955269 2017-11-25 04:37:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Amy_Siskind @MishMashB1 @VoasWa I live here in the USA and I always call him trump or Donald Trump. Never president trump. My apologies for the embarrassment 60 million people made. Were working on fixing it.
934640176076414976 2017-11-25 04:29:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CathyJoeGPT @richardhine What he meant to say was that with no regulations the banks can loan money to people and businesses they know cant afford it then sell the debt to hedge funds who will still make billions on the foreclosures and garnishments.
934638174231564289 2017-11-25 04:21:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MishMashB1 @AndyRichter Nazis dont deserve any fairness at all not in journalism not in anything. Nobody should give them a platform. They had one it was ww2 and they lost. My family died fighting nazis. Fuck nazis
934636663749402624 2017-11-25 04:15:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DavidHonaker79 You are correct Im only band-aids over bullet holes even with my work around because the whole plan sucks !
934636028303958016 2017-11-25 04:12:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DavidHonaker79 They wont be able to close it I promise. I just dont want to say until I see the final proposal.  It wont save them all but it will help with a bunch of them. It wont solve all the other disgraces in that plan. Im still against it.
934633810053885952 2017-11-25 04:03:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> Im a cpa and i was just reading one of the feeds on the tax bill.   I just figured out how to get around some of the loss of deductions. Will reveal once I see the final passed law. Ill show the middle class how to beat the 1% at their own game
934630011084173312 2017-11-25 03:48:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealDonalTrump @McSnurdRock Do you ever get your twitter access limited? Every time I send a tweet like that I get limited by twitter. Why are they watching me Im a total twitter nobody.
934628024175259648 2017-11-25 03:41:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealAlexJones I think Im off punishment now
934627900757889024 2017-11-25 03:40:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealAlexJones Watch out I got limited for that tweet so twitter said
934625904445321216 2017-11-25 03:32:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @CNNPR @Dyann057 Thankfully because everything on Foxnews is stand up comedy these days.
934625269679312896 2017-11-25 03:30:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SKWaller @EdKrassen And in nyc in Times Square we have our brand new impeach trump bill boards they are beauties.
934621550334087168 2017-11-25 03:15:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bewaremysting @kylegriffin1 Was thinking the same thing
934621296868102145 2017-11-25 03:14:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Pajjr2016 @Happy2BNana @garylopez4 Im in Brooklyn everyday and I dont see black on white crime in the streets.  In ny home Town of Huntington a white drunk loser smacked a brown skinned man in his head and yelled trump. It was all good he got his ass whipped good. We all clapped.
934591423877349381 2017-11-25 01:15:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenToddYoung @SenateGOP Stop using your dad taxes as a way to lure in votes. Its bullshit. Your dads problem was the both portions of fica tax. same as me. A 1 person self employed should not pay both portions. Fix that instead of giving a break to Exxon
934590482474250240 2017-11-25 01:11:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenToddYoung @SenateGOP Im sure it want the fed tax rate. When a self employed person (1) like a salesmen or accountant etc. has to start off by paying more than 15% in se tax its not fair. They are not the same as an employer match. The new tax plan does nothing about this. He would still pay over 40%
934586260513009666 2017-11-25 00:55:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @trumpwinery @DonaldJTrumpJr Actually I dont want wine for Christmas and if somebody dared to give me any trump wine Id bust that bottle up right in front of them.
934583768375054336 2017-11-25 00:45:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MattMurph24 @MattGertz Trump isnt interested in a free society. Nationalism is much closer to fascism then democracy. He would love an autocratic state with just his followers. The rest would be slaves and minions
934582686529843205 2017-11-25 00:40:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chick_in_kiev Many people who voted for trump hate Jews and are in support of nazis. Its so sad that he relies on these people to elect him when if they got the chance and the fascist country they want they would march his daughter and  her whole family to the gas chambers.
934579252745383936 2017-11-25 00:27:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRickWilson So when they support us in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and our soldiers are with them the equipment is only 90 percent are good. He really is a dotard
934578865095217152 2017-11-25 00:25:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @Not_My_Dotard @DTrumpPoll Whats wrong with 3 percent in your pole. Have they had recent brain surgery
934578171915264003 2017-11-25 00:22:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews @gsbling You retweet tweets from coulter and Lohren enough said
934577488101040129 2017-11-25 00:20:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @COGICFamily @TalbertSwan @jlsherf God had not one thing to do with Donald Trump. He is so far from religious. He is the opposite of anything good and decent and moral. Hes a piece of shit. And if Jesus was here now even he would say so to his face and then ask his father to forgive him.
934574949632823296 2017-11-25 00:10:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews I have to be honest. Who gives a shit we have much bigger problems to worry about then this nonsense. This is how trump got in to office. Focus America
934573920329654272 2017-11-25 00:06:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AMagidB @nowthisnews Im aware that some Yemen extremists have committed horrific terrorist acts but the USA has plenty of its own homegrown. The worst terror attack on our soil came by Saudi Arabians
934573358347358208 2017-11-25 00:03:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AMagidB @nowthisnews Amazing that he supports the Saudis. 19 of 20 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia.  We all know its about oil and of course Americas greed. Who can benefit America more Saudi or Yemen? Thats who America will support at any cost
934553908919357440 2017-11-25 22:46:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @BrandonTXNeely Im limited to only my followers today for calling Huckabee a moron and cursing at Alex jones. But I was saying that most of the USA sees fox as propaganda and fake as does the rest of the world. Its only him and 60m other dotards that believe fox is actually news.
934552311472492544 2017-11-25 22:40:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Memmons13 What is wrong with the hill they really have been printing a bunch of this nonsense. He is a liar liar liar. Stop trying to distract
934551295129776128 2017-11-25 22:36:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> I care about #BigCats. Where do you want to see Nat Geo make an impact?https://cards.twitter.com/cards/4z6xh1/51mhf
934550178740260865 2017-11-25 22:31:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bessbell My grandfather did not fight and die fighting nazis for this guy. My dad is a permanently disable vet from Vietnam and he didnt fight for this asshole either. Fuck nazis
934546023170658307 2017-11-25 22:15:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Newsweek I know Im limited by twitter so Im sure they cant see my reply. They obviously want another 4 yrs of trump recycling this garbage. Bernie Sanders is washed up and done and hurting the Democratic Party
934545414346420224 2017-11-25 22:12:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GirlNamedBoston Me neither
934515915865063424 2017-11-25 20:15:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RobinBrenizer Im limited on twitter so Im not sure who can even see my post
934515603175624704 2017-11-25 20:14:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RobinBrenizer I resist because I dont want to live in a country run by a racist ignorant narcissist who takes away rights from women, disabled people, elderly, animals, healthcare and gives tax breaks to the rich, gives our environment to oil and gas.
934498420991111168 2017-11-25 19:06:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PrincessBravato Did your twitter get limited. I said something less harsh and got limited for 24 hrs.  I did rail on Alex jones though so that may have caused it.
934498029855494144 2017-11-25 19:04:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Give me a break willow smith. Boo hoo Im crying for you. Give up all you have and change your name. Problem solved.
934480950699937792 2017-11-25 17:56:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Chihiro_NoFace @politvidchannel Can we make it Hillary it will infuriate trump more ?
934479812042936321 2017-11-25 17:52:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jimmyjohns @HarleyResists Your correct about posting with facts. But that piece of garbage killing rhinos and elephants and bears.  Id like to see how he does without his gun against the same creatures. Piece of shit none the less.
934478841426391042 2017-11-25 17:48:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PoetLvr @RVAwonk They should just call it a cult. Thats what that is.
934477344047235074 2017-11-25 17:42:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @sjones1905 @ShaunKing Extreme narcissism is such a severe disorder.  Very hard to treat as a narcissist cant recognize they have the disorder and they surround themselves with yes people and people with similar disorders.

934476218048614400 2017-11-25 17:37:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @cyferPtVila @SadlyCatless Must have been a pregnant raccoon.
934475435454451712 2017-11-25 17:34:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HashtagJones1 @cyferPtVila @charley_ck14 I actually have some jehovah witness friends. I had to pry out of them their religion. They never pushed it on me.  We exchanged gifts because we cared about each other not because it wes Christmas. Just sharing.
934471188906201092 2017-11-25 17:17:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dumptrump33 They have no shame.
934470528831811584 2017-11-25 17:15:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @McSnurdRock @JustinTrudeau That the tweet our president should have sent but instead he said we need to ban Muslims and build a wall bordering Mexico.
934470227131355136 2017-11-25 17:13:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @dontraiseabetsy Hes part of the Puerto Rico economy problem with his failed golf course he walked from.  Left them with what was it 30 million in debt.
934469666797445120 2017-11-25 17:11:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan And what about the taxpayer who are hurt by that but are not rich like you. Called the middle class?
934468784999497733 2017-11-25 17:08:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kathyb5783 @CREWcrew But this acceptable to his ridiculous base. This is disgusting and such a violations of ethics.  Why is it no one cares? Must be kickbacks.
934462071739179008 2017-11-25 16:41:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RestlessRuffian Donald Trump doesnt want educated people. He cant spew his lies to people with a brain.
934460527530729473 2017-11-25 16:35:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KevinDarryl @Rosie Its pathetic that he was ever voted in.
934456713343840257 2017-11-25 16:20:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @taninthesummer Time shouldnt have stroked his ego last year and put him on the cover. Trump also thinks person of the year is a compliment to him. They also put Hitler on the cover one year. Please mueller hurry up
934454560395063296 2017-11-25 16:11:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosarium8 @McSnurdRock Im glad you pointed it out. Just because  your person of the year doesnt mean your a great person. They put murderinh lying despots on the cover all the TIME.
934453459495079937 2017-11-25 16:07:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @Kane_Says405 @SRuhle The tiger woods golf game is about your golf course in Dubai he is designing.  What jobs has this dotard created
934452075752194048 2017-11-25 16:01:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> Was it this tweet that got me limited on twitter or.......https://twitter.com/brizzicpa/status/934316372800278528
934316372800278528 2017-11-24 07:02:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealAlexJones Anybody who believes the garbage crap lies that come out of your pathetic sad lying, fake ass are ignorant, despicable, brainwashed, morons and fucking imbeciles.
934308255282745344 2017-11-24 06:30:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ColSand42 I saw the first one and hated it.

933511666603560961 2017-11-22 01:44:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @barry_corindia Thanks for making me vomit on thanksgiving eve. Why do white old fat men think anybody wants a dick pic. So gross.
933509718143832064 2017-11-22 01:37:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KrisKobach1787 Why would anybody want to meet a narcissistic a*hole like him.
933509354527055872 2017-11-22 01:35:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You have a very severe narcissism disorder.  It makes you unfit to lead this country
933343140941004800 2017-11-22 14:35:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie Today Moore says hell be taking legal action against at least 1 woman, maybe more.
933342390148108288 2017-11-22 14:32:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump When will shut the fuck up about the nfl and do what you actually are supposed to do. Theres a thought for you
933182051385331712 2017-11-21 03:55:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Well lets just say that nonsense was true they watched and learned from the master trump and his master Putin
933176044995067905 2017-11-21 03:31:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kimlockhartga @RWPUSA This is a disgrace considering how may other mergers/sales have been approved in the same industry and other industries. This is illegal and is meant to get rid of cnn and violates the constitution.  This can not be allowed and the trump tweets should be used    In the lawsuit.
933168708125675520 2017-11-21 03:02:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @itsrupaulryan He would literally be the leader of gilead.  Everyday we are moving 1 step closer...
933158034725097473 2017-11-21 02:19:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SofyaAngelz @NicholsUprising Maybe theres hope for Alabama?
933156978544775168 2017-11-21 02:15:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost Not to be an asshole but is there anybody who isnt bat shit crazy in Alabama. Is the whole state a big pile of bible toting people with no real morals hiding behind some ridiculous version of truth.
932458456958885890 2017-11-19 03:59:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jimsciutto Im not defending these countries at all but at the same time us citizens need to be extra careful and have the utmost respect with regards to these nations laws. We have to be responsible to make sure these incidents stop occurring.
932457647495933952 2017-11-19 03:56:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jimsciutto Us citizens really need to start respecting the laws of the lands they travel to and stop this disrespectful nonsense. It cant always be they are just kids. This keeps happening and this time a happy ending in the past weve seen whats happened.
932455509797625856 2017-11-19 03:48:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jimsciutto While his comments are completely inappropriate why is it ok for us citizens to travel to an autocratic land or any land and violate the laws and expect no consequences. Dont we expect them to respect our laws when they come here?
932398802664935424 2017-11-19 00:02:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Yeah I was happy about that. Youre a decent person it seems with the ability to have a rational conversation even if you have a dissenting opinion which is nice for a change on twitter. I find the more people talk the easier it becomes to find common ground. Congress try it!
932398144847007746 2017-11-19 00:00:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh You arent rich at that income and neither am I and they just take and take.  I am tired of all of them both parties.
932397498441879553 2017-11-19 23:57:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh You and I can come up with a better tax plan than all these idiots.  I have one they dont listen.
932397134527303680 2017-11-19 23:56:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Exactly
932396431016591365 2017-11-19 23:53:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I want them to really give a shit about the middle class and do it right. This plan sucks and wont help.
932396248472186881 2017-11-19 23:52:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Im just saying taking more away from the middle class to give it to rich people isnt the answer regardless of Democrat or Republican
932396100702687234 2017-11-19 23:52:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Im paying her real estate taxes.
932396036387147776 2017-11-19 23:51:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh My mother in law gets 500 a month social security and her real estate taxes are 3000
932395897216032770 2017-11-19 23:51:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh This happens at the local level. All the politicians suck
932395811450875906 2017-11-19 23:50:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I agree I think they need to change how real estate taxes are assessed
932395651555618817 2017-11-19 23:50:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Cuomo is no prize
932395553144692738 2017-11-19 23:49:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I dont think nyc does enough for its teachers or its schools
932395462514106368 2017-11-19 23:49:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Nyc is in need of supplies but Its so bad in some of these low tax states. Beyond bad.
932395148046151681 2017-11-19 23:48:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh My point is none of trumps tax plan resolves any of this
932395084091416576 2017-11-19 23:48:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Teacher deductions are deductible in excess of the 250.00 but again they go into the 2 percent agi issue.
932394878625046528 2017-11-19 23:47:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh They are just eliminating that all together
932394723519684609 2017-11-19 23:46:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh The union dues are because of the 2 percent agi requirement
932394447370969089 2017-11-19 23:45:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh They should let people deduct student loan interest regardless of income. Again if the werent so consumed with breaks for the super rich they could really help the middle class
932394136845635587 2017-11-19 23:44:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh They dont need to limit mortgage interest I homes to 500k. That will kill the ny housing market.
932393967651573762 2017-11-19 23:43:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I also didnt say we shouldnt cut the tax rates. I actually think they dont do enough with them. They should carry that 12 percent bracket they want all the way to 150k
932393285435428864 2017-11-19 23:40:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I told you the AMT can go its the worst tax ever put on the books.
932393184465956865 2017-11-19 23:40:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh His plan doesnt help with the college credit. He should let people making 200k get a college credit instead of giving corporations a break
932392874020360192 2017-11-19 23:39:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh I have couples that are teachers both of them  it doesnt mean everybody hits the AMT. teachers in ny can be making a lot of money
932392551910342656 2017-11-19 23:38:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Ive analyzed the plan it sucks
932392379948072960 2017-11-19 23:37:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Almost no middle class pay AMT
932392250939764736 2017-11-19 23:36:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh No personal exemptions wipes most of the standard deduction increase away and for a family of four its actually less
932391869149057024 2017-11-19 23:35:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh How would Donald trumps tax plan help one person in Ny buy a home ?
932391656816566272 2017-11-19 23:34:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Again we do have issues that need work but not cutting deductions to give giant corporations tax breaks that WILL NOT trickle down.
932391449085300736 2017-11-19 23:33:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh We do have some good schools on Long Island in relation to other states.  The teachers in Texas are begging for donations constantly for supplies.  They are severity under funded
932391105122983937 2017-11-19 23:32:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh The AMT can go its unfair for all income levels.  I dont pay the AMT Im middle class You have quite few dollars if youre paying the AMT. Im a Cpa I know about the taxes.
932386087674241024 2017-11-19 23:12:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Not sign it should have said difficult cycle. Most of the real estate taxes are for the schools, fire departments, garbage service, transportation. There are things nys needs to change thats absolutely true but that doesnt change the fact that the federal tax plan stinks
932385344443572227 2017-11-19 23:09:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh The states with the lowest income taxes and lowest real estate taxes have the highest rate of needing federal tax dollars to subsidized state programs of all kinds. Its a difficult sign
932384809669849093 2017-11-19 23:07:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka @WhatMakesMeUgh Thats another topic Im specifically referring to that comment. It does not benefit all New Yorkers.

932073484641034240 2017-11-18 02:30:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @RandallFrench14 I loathe him as well. Thank you for reminding me of his horror. They are a match made for each other until the expensive divorce
932031149030944773 2017-11-18 23:41:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @scottaeckert @Philly_Asshole The Gang of 8 measure, while passing the Senate, was stopped in the House due largely to Republican opposition.
932031024514682880 2017-11-18 23:41:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @scottaeckert @Philly_Asshole Also, in 2013 Schumer was one of four Democrats and four Republicans, known as the Gang of 8 who proposed an immigration overhaul to the Senate. Part of the overhaul involved removing the diversity visa program.

932027024562098176 2017-11-18 23:25:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @Philly_Asshole You do realize he was one of eight senators who tried to get rid of the visa lottery program.  Of course you dont that would reqiuire you to obtain facts instead of propaganda.
931913281207402496 2017-11-18 15:53:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @Jkleaka Im educated and a New Yorker and it doesnt help me at all. I get a tax increase and Im middle class.  Youre comment is a stupid generalization. Just because you hate the governor doesnt make the tax plan good
931763008245850113 2017-11-17 05:56:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoyAnnReid Thanks for all the kind words Ill share them with her tomorrow and promise her there is an end to the horror in the whitehouse.

931233834351374336 2017-11-16 18:53:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I did the math its not 1182.00. Really depends on what the child tax credit is and with increase in healthcare costs from the sabotage that youve done. That family is in trouble

Enough.
931037537996562432 2017-11-15 05:53:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marielinboston2 @RBReich Seems convenient that a real estate developer trump would be fine with a housing market collapse. He needs renters not buyers. Hes the buyer and he wants it cheap. No coincidence it will be ny, nj, va, ca his prime spots that suffer most. Hmmm.....
931036763447013377 2017-11-15 05:50:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marielinboston2 @RBReich The Medicare and Medicaid cuts are perhaps the cruelest of the plan not to mention the destruction of the housing market.

931002890994569216 2017-11-15 03:36:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tankcat Bottom line. This man was banned from a mall. Nobody gets banned from a mall especially not back then. He got banned because he was sexually harassing children. Period. End of discussion. Really banned from a mall. Pedophile.

923761621595492352 2017-10-26 04:01:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Corporations 28 instead of 20 and keep the proposed fixed asset full expense they propose (sec179 but better) make some other tweaks.
923760946316791808 2017-10-26 03:59:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I have other ideas. The standard deductions have to be higher than they propose with no itemized. Get rid of the amt for all.
923759303982448641 2017-10-26 03:52:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud The new 12% bracket up to like 150k.  then I would change the proposed 25 to 20 and leaving a 28 and making a 35. Increase the standard
923757514726010881 2017-10-26 03:45:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I'm just pointing out it can be avoided without even needing a repeal. I'm ok with s repeal if they leave itemize or drastically expand
923750436838039552 2017-10-26 03:17:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud After your 5.49 million dollar exclusion and you can can use living trusts, structure ownership as stock, have you met with good estate ppl?
923747707923173376 2017-10-26 03:06:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I actually could give the dems and the republicans a great tax plan for the whole country they should call me
923746333877587969 2017-10-26 03:01:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud If you don't have money you don't pay estate taxes.
923744671045701632 2017-10-26 02:54:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Use trusts, living etc. you can pay zero estate tax with a good accountant and lawyer.
923744450802802689 2017-10-26 02:53:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud A house is the core so it only is taxed on the cap gain and the basis is a step up on date of death. Always do jtwros on stock accts.

923742343429271552 2017-10-26 02:45:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud You need a good accountant. You can avoid the estate tax and your are very rich if thr estate tax hits you.

923741983922892805 2017-10-26 02:43:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud The proposed plan is all but mortgage and charity. With an education credit and child credit. Charity favors rich and tithes.
923741775499550720 2017-10-26 02:42:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I'm a CPA so I have vast tax resources to get accurate valid info. Nothing has passed but it's not just an elimination of 1 or 2 deductions.
923741553360801792 2017-10-26 02:42:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud The republicans including Paul Ryan have released outlines. The AICPA who lobbies Washington. The budget guidance has it listed.
923740396487880704 2017-10-26 02:37:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Give me the example ?
923740311670722560 2017-10-26 02:37:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I know exactly how it works
923740250693931008 2017-10-26 02:36:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Those investors will get the tax breaks.  Rich investors and executives will get all the money. I do this for a living
923739940164382721 2017-10-26 02:35:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Not one job will be created from the tax cuts. The money will all go into the stock market which 30% of investors are foreign.
923739707753844737 2017-10-26 02:34:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud I don't deserve a tax Increase so billion dollar corporations can get tax breaks the CPAs  like me already give them.  The estate tax really
923739270921228288 2017-10-26 02:32:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud By the way we aren't all rich in ny. I grew up to a single mom paid my own college and saved every dollar for my down payment
923739057645113345 2017-10-26 02:32:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud The same example on a family of 4 increases Income by 4000 and taxes by 500.00 the plan is a failure.
923738845971087360 2017-10-26 02:31:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud They increase the standard by 6k take away 4,100 so they reduce the income by 1900 but increase the bottom bracket they maybe get 190.00
923738626378387456 2017-10-26 02:30:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud It also hurts the elderly and the people who get the eic. A single person with a w2 of 50k will see a tax savings of maybe 190.00
923738272739811329 2017-10-26 02:29:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud The tax cuts depend on trickle down economics. The majority are for businesses and the wealthy. The loss of deductions hurts middle class
923735138810376192 2017-10-26 02:16:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud Give me 1 example of trickle down success. I'll give you 2 failures. USA 1987 oct 19 and Kansas present day
923734802041376769 2017-10-26 02:15:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud They are also eliminating the personal exemption and raising the lowest tax bracket. This tax cut is for the rich
923734425640239104 2017-10-26 02:13:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @anneL5694 @DiversityInclud What about the medical deduction for elderly, the eic for the working poor There's many other deductions that will be lost.
923723642290278400 2017-10-26 01:30:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WNBC With the wc insurance and the gl insurance and osha this is a nightmare. The company doing that job can lose their insurance.

923579144797151232 2017-10-26 15:56:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Yeah because statues are more important than itemized deductions for Va and women's reproductive rights.
923417514998149121 2017-10-25 05:14:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Lets compare our taxes under your plan. Guarantee I get a tax increase and you get a tax decrease. You're rich I'm NY middle class.

922249818440859648 2017-10-22 23:54:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @jeffmason1 @FoxNews No the American people need a win. This is about the 536 morons running the government
922248671143628800 2017-10-22 23:49:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @renato_mariotti We don't have an EPA. I call it the US office of oil and gas production.
922246165189611522 2017-10-22 23:39:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JuddLegum Disgusting NYPD fix this shit
922244419587276800 2017-10-22 23:32:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jasoninthehouse It's called travel ban for chad. Chad pulled soldiers. There's consequences for alienating allies. #moron doesn't get it
922244011980664833 2017-10-22 23:31:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @alyssahertzig @bravenak @frankonfranky You have a conservative congress who wants to take away everything. His delusional brain thinks free hc and college will pass. Not happening
922243420151861251 2017-10-22 23:29:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bravenak Go away Bernie and don't come back.

922242167694938113 2017-10-22 23:24:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Maybe it's both
922242104897802240 2017-10-22 23:23:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews There must be a daily memo at fox that reads: If you don't slam obama and Clinton once a day you're fired. Otherwise these people are morons
922120075074850816 2017-10-22 15:18:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really with the god references. From you it's a joke
922119598463479808 2017-10-22 15:16:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MariaBartiromo @POTUS @FoxNews @PersevereEver Most s corps and llc and sole proprietorships are getting an increase while the big c corps get a windfall. RECESSION COMING SOON
922119294602895361 2017-10-22 15:15:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MariaBartiromo @POTUS @FoxNews @PersevereEver Also the pass through tax being fixed at 25% hurts the majority of pass throughs who on average pay less than that.
922118080939118592 2017-10-22 15:10:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Koch
922117010338795520 2017-10-22 15:06:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really with this useless tweet. Boo hoo. Big whining baby
922114111630176256 2017-10-22 14:55:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MariaBartiromo @POTUS @FoxNews @PersevereEver Yeah and the other brackets hes changing are for the rich.  The loss of the deductions and personal exemptions is a tax increase
921937116644499456 2017-10-21 03:11:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABCNewsRadio Yours dads religious agenda Ivanka suppresses women as entrepreneurs. They don't have access to private nannies and millions of dollars.
921935907401424897 2017-10-21 03:07:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WisePaxCat @TranslateRealDT With less birth control access women will be too busy with all the babies her dad wanted born they won't be opening businesses.

921933086656430080 2017-10-21 02:55:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MsCruse411 @thebrionnaelam Just realized I'm old. This tweet is a foreign language to me !
921932198894297089 2017-10-21 02:52:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @davidaxelrod @teapartydem I am a tax expert and I've done the math. A large % of the population is getting a tax hike. Trickle down economics has failed every time
921924371643592705 2017-10-21 02:21:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillOReilly @coldorangina Corporations don't pay 32million for nothing. They would have squashed the claimants like a bug if they had no case.
921920493837602817 2017-10-21 02:05:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @lucylouise1112 @KamalaHarris He must be so proud

921798490509864960 2017-10-21 18:01:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bravenak Lmfao!
921733337806405632 2017-10-21 13:42:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PatrickW @jackmjenkins I know when he was living NYC on the stern show he didn't seem to have a faith advisor. Did that come with his paid for presidency?
921608544478167041 2017-10-20 05:26:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WisePaxCat @scjessey Just another regular day at the office.
921592337461018625 2017-10-20 04:21:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bravenak I just love your tweets
921584198963654656 2017-10-20 03:49:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews It's called democracy you should try it in your country. Stay out of our elections.
921574351979384832 2017-10-20 03:10:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewjdowd She's perfect for under his eye in the handmaids tale.
921568781876514816 2017-10-20 02:48:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @carol_dacanay @Karoli The budget turns MC into a voucher program. So older American will get a fixed amount to buy insurance on the exchanges trump destroyed.
921566576918384640 2017-10-20 02:39:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Camerams4 @tedlieu The White House will never admit it's because our former ally chad pulled troops due to travel ban
921564296617873408 2017-10-20 02:30:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @floydian_slip1 Party time
921563810128957440 2017-10-20 02:28:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheRickWilson I look at this picture and know I can't say anything nice. I'm going to leave it at that
921557789067169792 2017-10-20 02:04:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @kdstarbux Under the new plan they get a tax increase. But you can keep talking about educating yourself
921557515137175552 2017-10-20 02:03:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @kdstarbux Under the new plan the same people get a 24k deduction period. They are planning on getting rid of the personal exemption.
921556288269668353 2017-10-20 01:58:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @kdstarbux @carol_dacanay @TinStL This is huge. For a family plan If the employer pays 15k you would be taxed on that and you didn't actually get cash.
921555689662832640 2017-10-20 01:56:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux They are actually increasing the bottom racket by 2 percent.
921555487400873984 2017-10-20 01:55:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux That's only 3900 extra deduction at best.
921555400729808897 2017-10-20 01:55:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux A married couple who doesn't itemize now gets 12 plus 8100 for the personal exemption. The new plan takes away 8100 and gives 12 so
921555109288529920 2017-10-20 01:53:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux Did they tell you they are getting rid of the personal exemption
921555034491490304 2017-10-20 01:53:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux The regular Ira contribution is a direct adjustment for AGI so losing that can cost 550 for a 10 percent tax bracket If the max is done
921554708065595393 2017-10-20 01:52:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux First of all the 401k contribution is reflected on your w2. You'll feel that each week.
921554388396724224 2017-10-20 01:51:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux I'd do returns for individuals for free if I had to to prevent this sham from becoming law
921554209895604225 2017-10-20 01:50:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @brianschatz @carol_dacanay @kdstarbux Are you for real. I'm an accountant and this is just false
921554016978587648 2017-10-20 01:49:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crispalomino @brianschatz It's getting worse and worse. No personal exemptions, no itemized.
921553141446922240 2017-10-20 01:46:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @socal_american @Lawrence If sacred means 1950's and earlier and handmaids tale I like not being sacred anymore
921552813389475840 2017-10-20 01:44:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kfhall0852 Only 42%?
921551967549313024 2017-10-20 01:41:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @grandoftwo @tonyposnanski I have a huge problem with Lara trump having access to anything. Who is she ? What's her job ? Despite the lies
921547687538728960 2017-10-20 01:24:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @davidgshortell @Nitemists @mkraju No respect for the constitution

921547262978871298 2017-10-20 01:22:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I'm sure they will all convenient be gay people they "quarantine"
921545998828175360 2017-10-20 01:17:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews You can also help stop with needle exchange programs
921544010606501888 2017-10-20 01:09:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Who wants to read that crap anyway. That dr knows as much about heaven as any other human still on earth which is 0.
921543474733895680 2017-10-20 01:07:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It's not appropriate for you to push books for your friends
921543222886850560 2017-10-20 01:06:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @keithboykin Because he knows the chad travel ban contributed and this is his Benghazi
921542381765263360 2017-10-20 01:03:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ColMorrisDavis We don't do it that way and 4 star generals who don't want to answer ? Should not be cos
921542098180067328 2017-10-20 01:02:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews It also would help if the president didn't cut all the hiv money out of budget
921541945960353792 2017-10-20 01:01:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews You can stop the spread of hiv by making sure Medicaid and health insurance and condoms are available. Not quarantine
921541423886893056 2017-10-20 00:59:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @SwannDives @JordanFaretto @MySofistkat There's a big difference on how you catch the 2
921541235344625664 2017-10-20 00:58:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews What is she a witch doctor
921521435163680768 2017-10-20 23:40:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Why would a sitting us president feel the need to point this out. You don't see the problem with this
921364716450144256 2017-10-20 13:17:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Which will cause the economy to crash as it did October 1987. Hey you'll be remembered for it though don't worry it will be your legacy
921363411421876224 2017-10-20 13:12:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 Besides I want to get off twitter it's too time consuming. He needs to quiet down
921363243959975936 2017-10-20 13:11:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 It's a problem pepper. He should be more silent
921363152788512769 2017-10-20 13:11:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 He needs to get that under control. Everything he does is over shadowed by it. You know I'm center on opinions. He does lie a lot.
921362852031672327 2017-10-20 13:09:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 You know I don't like him, but he won't stop because he is a narcissist as many rich powerful guys are.  That's not about insulting him.
921362539782590464 2017-10-20 13:08:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 They are all using lobbyists. Nothing has changed with that. To say that is not true. Washington is still full of lobbyists.
921220815982559232 2017-10-19 03:45:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @erikforCO It's fantastic and true. What will congress do about it ? #nothing
921219821093687296 2017-10-19 03:41:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ybbkaren @SenFeinstein Do something about it before our democracy slowly slips away.
921218835721736192 2017-10-19 03:37:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump you are responsible for the death of those soldiers in niger. CHAD TRAVEL BAN. this is your BENGHAZI. #murderer.
921212861002801153 2017-10-19 03:13:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @moveover4me2 @PaladinCornelia Chad pulled its military that was fighting ISIS with them until trump insulted them and caused our only ally chad to abandon us.  #murderer
921212309829234689 2017-10-19 03:11:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 Those families should consider themselves in a better place without a call from him
921211654184079361 2017-10-19 03:09:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Then don't call. Calling and making it worse as trump has done is a stain on America
921210852040208384 2017-10-19 03:05:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ACLU The early stages of a dictatorship

921208723405725697 2017-10-19 02:57:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Philip_Elliott Unfortunately narcissists lie as a normal part of life. His condition is so bad I'm sure they are truths to him. He's so unfit for office
921207588510986242 2017-10-19 02:52:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @PoetLvr @Amy_Siskind What's sad is that I hated and thought bush was the worst president. I'd take him back in a heartbeat.  Now I see what the worst is.
921207064264871943 2017-10-19 02:50:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @joepabike @chrislhayes Where's the Benghazi outrage that the chad travel ban just caused these 4 green berets to die. Investigate now.
921205475634499584 2017-10-19 02:44:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SandraTXAS @pepper10001 No matter what trump is an elite. He may not be a politician but he's a 1 percenter elitist. He's a ny elitist.
921204263367397376 2017-10-19 02:39:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @costareports He's the one working for the pos.
921203801775845377 2017-10-19 02:37:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenBobCorker Is deductible as an itemized in schedule a. Is something wrong with your brain
921203629905928192 2017-10-19 02:37:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenBobCorker I wouldn't call itemized deductions special interest. Your state may not have state tax but you have an almost 10 percent sales tax which
921195502024232961 2017-10-19 02:04:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Reuters It will require a Benghazi investigation even more with this corrupt administration.
921194158144081920 2017-10-19 01:59:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laceyinme @grantstern Of course the ban caused it. The White House is quiet covering it all up
921193410081574914 2017-10-19 01:56:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Camerams4 @RVAwonk Let him take trump and his supporters and secede at this point. It would be so much easier and I could quit twitter

921005574564827136 2017-10-19 13:30:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PatrickW As a direct result of trickle down economics which failed and this administration and Paul Ryan are pushing
921005207303094272 2017-10-19 13:28:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Ouch when this over valuation corrects.
921004536470343681 2017-10-19 13:26:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Nobody cares what old out of office politicians are doing. Get it yet???
920863927558397952 2017-10-18 04:07:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC It's utterly false and a complete fabrication
920853579027681280 2017-10-18 03:26:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski @kashanacauley Thank you for the laugh on twitter! Made my night
920846159849119746 2017-10-18 02:56:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @Lrihendry Trump sucks worst president ever. #lovebeingblocked
920842983578226688 2017-10-18 02:44:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @P_McEnroe I thought so. Unbelievable that a registered nurse would have that opinion
920842537677606912 2017-10-18 02:42:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @P_McEnroe She's a very extreme righty. She's a whacko. I think she's a registered nurse at some point
920842035334172673 2017-10-18 02:40:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @ScottPresler You guys really need to get over Hillary

920834458756009985 2017-10-18 02:10:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 It's sad.I'm on here every night as a CPA slamming them on this tax plan. We have the AICPA all over it.  We'll see how it goes. I'm worried
920833952176361472 2017-10-18 02:08:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 Medicare doesn't cover either. It's a huge blow if she can't offset those retirement distributions with that deduction
920833742314311680 2017-10-18 02:07:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 They are losing there whole retirement to the bills. It's complicated they aren't on Medicare. Insurance doesn't cover her neuro treatment
920833540186624000 2017-10-18 02:06:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 Glad you have that. But the deductions for medical are so important for seniors. I have a client that spends over 40k a year on medical.
920832969824227328 2017-10-18 02:04:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 You deserve better
920832912588791808 2017-10-18 02:04:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 My guess was California or Tennessee if you see my other tweet.  It's not right
920832729868066817 2017-10-18 02:03:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 It's not right.They can preserve the itemized deductions and still cut taxes. They need to take it from the top not seniors and middle class
920832136353144832 2017-10-18 02:01:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 Or Tennessee

920831675713708032 2017-10-18 01:59:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 This is not even being talked about the gutting of Medicare. They are ruining the insurance market and then throwing seniors into it.
920831461787348992 2017-10-18 01:58:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 The budget that they want to pass turns Medicare over time into a fixed voucher based on income and you have to buy your own insurance.
920831255926788096 2017-10-18 01:57:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 I'm a cpa this is the worst tax cut plan for seniors and the middle class unlike the White House I've ran the numbers

920822843784486913 2017-10-18 01:24:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Instead of everyone consulting hannity maybe ask a few of us certified public accountants

920822380418818048 2017-10-18 01:22:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan What about the earned income credit. What is your supposed increase for the child credit. It's 1000 plus another 1000 if income allows
920822060837998592 2017-10-18 01:21:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 Class family of 4 married 2 kids who doesn't itemize you lose 16200 in personal exemption and gain a 12000 deduction you lose. Simple math
920821824186920960 2017-10-18 01:20:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @CharlieD296 They are planning to get rid of the personal exemption which offsets the doubling of the standard deduction. If you're a middle
920821218282033152 2017-10-18 01:17:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @erikforCO @murrell_gina @jmonteer Why can't they reduce the tax rates and preserve itemized deductions. There are many other areas they could tweak and still give all a cut
920820926631038976 2017-10-18 01:16:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @erikforCO @murrell_gina @jmonteer It's the loss of itemization it kills people. I pay a lot like you but his tax plan increase my taxes by a lot almost 6k
920819587679244288 2017-10-18 01:11:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StevenTDennis Who is high on oxy at the White House On what basis do they figure this. Literally nonsense.

920518214622351360 2017-10-17 05:13:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jonfavs Narcissists never have empathy for others. It's always all about them and them alone.

920517248766406657 2017-10-17 05:09:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Brasilmagic Honestly I never hear about any other religion pulling this shit.  How about being good Christians and minding ones own business
920516830741123078 2017-10-17 05:08:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz @Brasilmagic Why can't we just keep church and state separate. It seems the Christians are constantly looking to get involved in other people's shit.
920516408433414145 2017-10-17 05:06:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz @Brasilmagic So that means anybody has a fundamental right based on 1A to discriminate against Christians or anybody. It's a ridiculous argument

920490289512566785 2017-10-17 03:22:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @ACBLimehouse They are taking away the personal exemption so it really isn't a doubling of the standard deduction.

919922741662441472 2017-10-16 13:47:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Your bullshit increase to the standard deduction does nothing when you wipe out itemized wipe out personal exemptions take away credits
919922296101441537 2017-10-16 13:45:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Have you informed ppl they are also losing the 4050 personal exemption or are you still keeping that quiet. For a family of 4 that's 16200
919921652066148353 2017-10-16 13:43:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan So now the middle class is a special interest loophole you can keep your tax increase thanks anyway
919921414681055232 2017-10-16 13:42:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Morons are governing America
919898831105527808 2017-10-16 12:12:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Reuters My taxes are going up more than that and my income won't increase 1 dollar. I've don't the real math

919601770019639297 2017-10-15 16:32:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan This man is lying to everybody. His math is bullshit. I've actually done the math and you're a liar speaker Ryan
919601607670730752 2017-10-15 16:31:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I read an outline that says the child credit will be increased to 1000.00 it's actually already 1000 and 2000 each if you are lower income
919601332213952512 2017-10-15 16:30:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan They will also be getting rid of the earned income credit poor people
919601244733403136 2017-10-15 16:29:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan He thinks throwing that family a 6000 increase in the standard deduction helps them. It just cost them. A 10k deduction
919601012104671233 2017-10-15 16:29:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan His tax plan takes away the 4050 personal exemption also they are keeping that hush hush.  A family of 4 loses 16200 of exemption
919600508201037826 2017-10-15 16:27:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Maybe you should tell Americans to buy homes and invest money in education  and the future instead of coal jobs and low pay factory jobs
919600165098532866 2017-10-15 16:25:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Keep your middle class tax increase. I don't want it. I'll keep my deductions
919599735115313152 2017-10-15 16:23:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I don't think so. If someone's makes 75k but wants to buy expensive clothes and vacations instead of a home that's not my tax issue
919599292985282560 2017-10-15 16:22:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Here's your slogan: morons are governing America #maga enjoy
919599095588761600 2017-10-15 16:21:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump The EPA is a disgrace. Letting corporate America just pollute everywhere. These are not accomplishments these are blemishes on this country

919405921582886912 2017-10-14 03:33:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @pepper10001 @NinaMorton I'll go one further. It's so hard to remove a sitting president that if democrats controlled both houses he would not be removed.
919405399383642112 2017-10-14 03:31:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @pepper10001 @NinaMorton Nobody takes him seriously anyway.  Trump isn't getting impeached. That will never happen with majority control of both houses.

918294018357854208 2017-10-11 01:55:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoshuaGreen @ferguson_twf we can feed ourselves in ny. We'll stop funding the red states. They can keep their food. Most of ny is rural

917956895939485697 2017-10-10 03:35:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> I'm assuming he will get between a 90 and 105. He's probably average.
917949907746435072 2017-10-10 03:08:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> Not only do I want to see it I want to challenge him. I will beat him by 50 points if he doesn't cheat.
917941753482706944 2017-10-10 02:35:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz Can we get a 5550 hold on him
917941291815702528 2017-10-10 02:33:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MzDivah67 @Dowens8490 If you're white and can't recognize that being born that way gives you an advantage I don't know where you've been.
917937018365202432 2017-10-10 02:16:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StephenAtHome He's a moron but It's more narcissist behavior that drives it. I'd bet he comes up in that 90 to 105 range
917936600709042179 2017-10-10 02:15:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StephenAtHome He's going to come up average
917936494999932928 2017-10-10 02:14:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StephenAtHome Trump is between a 90 and 105

917744783174656005 2017-10-10 13:33:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @freetofly543211 It's pathetic. We subsidize a billion dollar industry so they can rip us off at the pump.
917744565628669952 2017-10-10 13:32:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @freetofly543211 America also subsidizes nearly 50 percent of all oil and gas in this country as well. Most Americans don't know this.

917562564095115265 2017-10-09 01:28:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @VP @realDonaldTrump I expect him to pay the taxpayers back for his protest. Nobody has shown more disrespect for our country than you and your family. #disgrace

917540333742952448 2017-10-09 00:00:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @costareports On second though maybe we should keep him at rallies. He'll never get his agenda passed
917539867994808320 2017-10-09 23:58:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @costareports Traveling on official business. Literally every fucking week it's a campaign rally. Enough already

917526402672594944 2017-10-09 23:05:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Ny is much more liberal then GA but many parents object. They don't sign the permission slip and the children are not taught that
917526172325511169 2017-10-09 23:04:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews What don't they have that available for Georgia. You can't just teach that without a parents knowledge or consent
917525971124805632 2017-10-09 23:03:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews In NY sex education is part of health in 6th grade and you can opt your kid out ahead of time for that portion of the curriculum.

917202173963800576 2017-10-08 01:36:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @VP Write a check to pay USA taxpayers back for your planned protest. You have the right to protest but not on my dime.
917194110469099520 2017-10-08 01:04:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR There should be no Wall funding. Mexico is paying for that. That's what he said in his campaign. Oh I see that was just another lie.

917181073402064898 2017-10-08 00:13:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> They didn't kneel and disrespect the flag so he won't condemn them.  Being a nazi isn't enough. My dead ww2 relatives are spinning in graves

917034454517993472 2017-10-08 14:30:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump That's what true believers do. Ask your evangelical friends If they would convert or allow their pride and joy daughter to do it
917034233377492992 2017-10-08 14:29:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're not religious you never were. Your daughter Ivanka was so religious she gave hers up for snotty to get married. Because
917034072265945090 2017-10-08 14:28:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You think you can just force woman to have baby after baby. You don't even see how irrelevant and how extreme mike huckabee is.
917033799522930688 2017-10-08 14:27:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Your agenda is already failing. Your jobs report was proof. How's the rebuilding America through coal working out.
917033393765920768 2017-10-08 14:26:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump The young will take this country away from the extreme conservatives forever. It may take years but it will happen
917033103583047680 2017-10-08 14:25:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're agenda is a Christian agenda that won't work. The other 70% will keep going to college instead of home schooling. Eventually
917032462810845185 2017-10-08 14:22:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump I'm sure there's important country business there. More campaigning and rallying on the taxpayer dime. So sad
917032024208297984 2017-10-08 14:20:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl What progress. He can only write EO which will end up in court. He can't pass legislation without cheating the rules. You're just a crook
916885042575630336 2017-10-07 04:36:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC @PocketBoba I can't budge. It pains me but I have to say it's covered under the 1st.
916883620484218882 2017-10-07 04:31:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC @PocketBoba 1st amendment. I would not burn a flag or sit during the pledge. My dad and his dad all military. But I am so strong on the 1st.
916882815526014976 2017-10-07 04:27:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC @PocketBoba It's the amendment that separates us from all other nations.
916882537036894209 2017-10-07 04:26:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC @PocketBoba Yeah. It's so unconstitutional. It's already been to court. She has the right nobody has to like it. Like flag burning.
916882055056822272 2017-10-07 04:24:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Read it. Bad idea expelling for this. Lawsuit.
916881647152304128 2017-10-07 04:23:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Hasn't this been to court already. Public schools can't do this. Let me read the article
916880805653295104 2017-10-07 04:19:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa Actually when my mom needed a hospital  it was not the catholic ones. We wanted the best people in the field. They were not working at them.
916880063219601408 2017-10-07 04:16:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa My state has plenty of jobs. Most small businesses just can't afford to offer the insurance. Not until they aren't so small anymore.
916877712316403712 2017-10-07 04:07:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa The catholic hospitals in my area won't be able to get the greatest if they offer subpar insurance.
916876509855518720 2017-10-07 04:02:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa I'm not talking about the copay. it's more about refusing to have it covered.  The catholic hospitals where I live are falling behind.
916875653785538560 2017-10-07 03:59:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa And ask btw can I get a vasectomy, birth control, abortion, or tubiligation on your plan. Really ? That argument is ridiculous
916875236582330368 2017-10-07 03:57:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa Many jobs are far and few. In reality most can't afford to say no to a job based on whether bc is offered. What interview do you go to
916874825708331009 2017-10-07 03:56:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa They would all be outside of the law. Small businesses. Under 50 employees.
916874313101463552 2017-10-07 03:54:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa I'm well aware. There are several hospitals where I live that employ thousands from all religions and they should have options. They won't
916872892415127552 2017-10-07 03:48:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa It's not that simple. Employers often have only 1 plan offered that's it. There's not always numerous options available
916872407486468097 2017-10-07 03:46:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa Shit at home. If your offering benefits offer them not based on your religious beliefs.
916872083698839553 2017-10-07 03:45:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa I employ people and don't push my religious beliefs on them or what coverage they should get.  If you're going to be an employer leave that
916870269016399872 2017-10-07 03:38:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa Yeah im the employer and I have many religious objections.
916868755782762496 2017-10-07 03:32:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods I have to say I'm offended. I rarely agree with you but find your opinion interesting. Now I'm a deplorable..maybe I should switch sides.
916863674723241984 2017-10-07 03:11:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @toddstarnes @FoxNews I can't stand trump but this is not acceptable at all.

916859934066839553 2017-10-07 02:56:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @eviebauer727 @thehill So let me get this. Can't get any legislation passed so just use EO. Isn't this a dictatorship then ? Am I wrong ? Help please?
916858178968662016 2017-10-07 02:49:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa What if all employers in the USA decided they don't want to cover maternity which BTW is one of the biggest cost factors in insurance?
916857075736686592 2017-10-07 02:45:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realJamesAllsup @sarahkmorgano @HopeRehak @SwolePrincesa I believe in the right to get bc because I pay $1503.00 a month for my insurance. How about that Jessica
916854087630704643 2017-10-07 02:33:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tedlieu I've been saying this all along. China and Russia will not allow the us to start war in their backyards

916755797941637121 2017-10-07 20:03:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Why is he so eager to send out more young military men and women to die.  Isis isn't enough for him
916755572686548993 2017-10-07 20:02:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely He says nothing has worked for 25 years but we haven't been at war with North Korea so apparently something has been working
916755333187547136 2017-10-07 20:01:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely It's really sad what this country has become under his administration

916754701068193793 2017-10-07 19:58:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really because for 25 years we've managed not have war with North Korea. Why are you so eager to kill our young military men and women

916157253090148352 2017-10-05 04:24:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MotherJones This is also just plain bullshit. It's says can't discriminate based on sex. Whether M,F, or T we are still talking about sex/gender.
916149445758210048 2017-10-05 03:53:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Just can't stand the lobbyists in this country all of them. Corporations and Lobbyists own the USA. Want to MAGA get rid of the lobbyists.
916147599442366465 2017-10-05 03:46:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MotherJones So let me understand this. He makes it so they can't get a job but then him and his party will complain that they are all on welfare.

916111975175868418 2017-10-05 01:24:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheEconomist Really? People are very narrow minded. How can you make an educated decision if you don't view both sides.

915423814888181760 2017-10-03 03:50:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @politico Ok. I'm def too liberal for you but I respect your acknowledging his hypocrisy.  Thank you for answering.
915422870830018561 2017-10-03 03:46:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix @jcasper11 It's a horrible morning fit. That's what I meant. She should be doing something like  Rachel Maddow. This is setting her up for failure.

915414797478432768 2017-10-03 03:14:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix Because they are setting her up for failure
915410828949639170 2017-10-03 02:58:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews That's a big advantage to the wealthiest Americans. 50 percent and taxed at special lower rates.
915410492218372096 2017-10-03 02:57:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Not mentioned but I'm a cpa so we have some additional resources. They are being hush hush but may only tax 50 percent of investment Income
915410211615191041 2017-10-03 02:56:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews 39.6 is already the highest rate in the code. The flow through at 25 gives them s huge loop hole
915409889245179904 2017-10-03 02:54:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews It won't matter with the 25 percent cap on flow through. That's a loophole to avoid the higher rates.
915394740950052866 2017-10-03 01:54:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo NYC has more guns than people and the laws are so strict the policy can barely get one (sarc). It's not cut and dry

915387342722134016 2017-10-03 01:25:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @socal_american I mixed feelings. I'm not sure we need military grade weapons available.  When I was a kid my house was invaded by armed attackers. My dad
915386561516261377 2017-10-03 01:22:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews But you want to cut that out of medical insurance and cut Medicaid. I'm confused mr speaker. Oh no I'm not you're an ass

914686608603049990 2017-10-01 03:00:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Workers still have the recession mentality and are not rocking the boat.  You won't get what you don't ask for and you have
914685591610171392 2017-10-01 02:56:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Because workers allow the employers to get away with it. They still have a fear that there are no other jobs to get.

914645787174424576 2017-10-01 00:18:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Alyssa_Milano I hope corporate America is prepared for the day all the regulations go back into effect. This will happen and at great expense a 2nd time.

913453890162524160 2017-09-28 17:22:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @WGR_Janitor We can beat up ny for a tax decrease later. I see a few places for improvement
913453261251678208 2017-09-28 17:20:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @WGR_Janitor Nys is using nys tax dollars for college so this particular debate on the trump plan is not related to that. That's my point
913452959551381505 2017-09-28 17:18:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @WGR_Janitor We all missed out by a few years.
913452856333799424 2017-09-28 17:18:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @WGR_Janitor Your bringing that up on a feed for federal taxes. Those are not funding college. Your nys is. That's another issue.
913452096996945920 2017-09-28 17:15:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump How am I growing with my huge tax increase in ny to fund your agenda for red states?
913450424300171264 2017-09-28 17:08:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @frankiecalamari Just look at Oklahoma.
913450015615586309 2017-09-28 17:07:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @frankiecalamari Fracking is the worst thing ny could do Oklahoma has 3.0 and under quakes on a daily basis. The rivers and streams are toxic from run off
913449303695396865 2017-09-28 17:04:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @WGR_Janitor That would be out of your state taxes not federal. So is ny giving you a tax increase to pay for college.  No
913396501677842438 2017-09-28 13:34:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Your killing 3.5 million under 200,000 dollars in ny alone what about nj, ca, pa, IL
913395934180102146 2017-09-28 13:32:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes I tweeted how he benefits yesterday
913395465894457344 2017-09-28 13:30:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump They want tax cuts but not those
913284606085955584 2017-09-27 06:09:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @J_D_Landis Considering my 18 hour day getting into bed is anticipated.
913270473835806720 2017-09-27 05:13:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ViewFromWise @Acosta The estate tax repeal is good for his kids. Low corporate tax rate benefits him, cap on flow through tax at 25% helps him. I can go on...
913252591764672512 2017-09-27 04:02:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan And sometimes the amt does hit the middle class. I meant to add while it tends to help the wealthier it needs to go.
913241871459262464 2017-09-27 03:20:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan You want to take away healthcare and now deductions.
913241786310643713 2017-09-27 03:19:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan People who have children with needs not covered by insurance benefit greatly from medical deductions.
913241609189421056 2017-09-27 03:19:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan People think retired people pay hardly any tax but that's so far from the truth.
913241471700000768 2017-09-27 03:18:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Taking away medical deductions on the itemized hurts elderly taxpayers greatly.
913241189805109249 2017-09-27 03:17:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Now we are back to taking away my healthcare.
913240910900662273 2017-09-27 03:16:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump A great guy who believes in gods law only. Wants to mix church and state. Tried to block seating of Ellison. Yeah great guy
913240621002960896 2017-09-27 03:15:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I need more details. As a cpa I'm thumbs down for the middle class tax relief if you don't just have 50k on a w2
913240326696984577 2017-09-27 03:13:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan You got rid of real estate taxes and state taxes because those effect middle class blue states the most.
913240098455588864 2017-09-27 03:13:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Not in love with this plan. Getting rid of amt helps wealthier. You kept the charitable and mortgage because those favor rich
913239932004691968 2017-09-27 03:12:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan That would tax another several thousand prob at 25 percent. I get a 2500 minimum increase. I haven't seen the child credit
913239558585806849 2017-09-27 03:10:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan For me in ny I get a tax increase my itemized deductions are more than 24k standard deduction. Now I would be forced to take the 24k
913239320873410560 2017-09-27 03:09:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan My problem is the itemized deductions you are talking about are used by the middle class.  They trigger the amt in wealthier people.
913237010097336320 2017-09-27 03:00:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods It was torture even if time magazine doesn't want to say so

913168992357044225 2017-09-27 22:30:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Local politicians suck !!'n
913168933334679553 2017-09-27 22:30:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider It's a problem you're not off base, but I'm not convinced the fed tax plan is good for the itemized deduction middle class person.
913168521663787008 2017-09-27 22:28:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider We'll see when they roll out the details
913168458094907392 2017-09-27 22:28:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider State taxes deduction... I'm not feeling yet Dustin on those clients.
913168239890485251 2017-09-27 22:27:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider They would really have to cut the personal income tax rate by a lot to make up for loss of unreimbursed employee expenses, real estate taxes
913167156950573057 2017-09-27 22:23:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Did you hear me say I love cuomo I hate the minimum wage increase law
913167057444835330 2017-09-27 22:22:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider I agree with you on this point
913166171620421636 2017-09-27 22:19:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Up to 50k is 15 percent then the next 25k is 25 percent ... then 34 kicks in from 74 to 100 k then it goes up and back down
913165835748986880 2017-09-27 22:17:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider If your c corp is paying 35 percent you have 100k in profits
913165549907202048 2017-09-27 22:16:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider I have a list of clients that will be getting an increase from the loss of deductions
913165417610403847 2017-09-27 22:16:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider None of my clients do business over seas. None are subject to estate tax. A few will benefit from the Amt. maybe 3
913165179596296193 2017-09-27 22:15:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider My clients so far from the outline are not benefiting. They aren't paying a 35 percent corp rate. Your business must have lots of profits
913164954244648960 2017-09-27 22:14:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider You have a c Corp so they help you. You benefit and you'll hire people. My clients are s corps, llc, sole proprietors
913163645533790209 2017-09-27 22:09:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider They are pass through
913163599811620864 2017-09-27 22:09:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Most small businesses aren't c corps
913163530861531136 2017-09-27 22:08:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider That's the corporate rates for c corps. s corps and flow through LLc don't pay that unless your in a very high personal tax bracket.
913163106490224640 2017-09-27 22:07:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider I know the Feds plan gives me a tax increase. Ny isn't raising my taxes.
913162997002047489 2017-09-27 22:06:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider So far apple is getting tax breaks and those in the amt. those who have no itemized deductions
913162874696212480 2017-09-27 22:06:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider I am debating it as a whole. I have yet to see how that plan helps lower for small business. I'll see when they show the details
913162649550168064 2017-09-27 22:05:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider What in the tax plan is helping small businesses? I'm waiting to see. It's only an outline
913162278672969728 2017-09-27 22:03:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider No need to take away deductions from people.
913162204584824833 2017-09-27 22:03:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider I own 2 small businesses. I know how taxes work.  Trickle down is a failure. Flow through income can be lowered by a tax rate decrease
913161724936716288 2017-09-27 22:01:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Btw. I don't expect the fed to solve my local issues. I don't expect them to give a red state and rich person tax break on the backs of us.
913160914538549252 2017-09-27 21:58:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Something tells me I know more about taxes. I'm a certified public accountant.
913160823937388544 2017-09-27 21:58:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Really? I'm not going to support a tax plan that give many states not just ny a tax increase.  So he can kill the estate tax. AMT, and corp
913158621864845313 2017-09-27 21:49:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Covers itemizers and standards.
913158530928189440 2017-09-27 21:48:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider If they want to help the middle class. Leave the deductions,  cut the rate and double the standard and increase the child credit. Boom done
913158074051055618 2017-09-27 21:47:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump So glad that's your number 1 concern. Calling Jerry jones.
913157914940014592 2017-09-27 21:46:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump The economy was already rolling? What exactly have you accomplished not by eo.
913157577931976705 2017-09-27 21:45:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Maybe upstate you have lower real estate taxes. No nyc tax. I don't know what your mortgage interest is. You may benefit but not downstate
913156823548653568 2017-09-27 21:42:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo @DustinSnider Are you kidding me. In ny we have real estate taxes and high state and city taxes. Losing those deductions is an increase for us
913156637749338113 2017-09-27 21:41:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo Ill be all over the ny reps. It hurts all of us here. It's disgusting.  Just helps corporations
913135683975475200 2017-09-27 20:18:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I'll be contacting my reps in ny to make sure they vote note. New Yorkers pay enough and now you take more from us
913135497643511809 2017-09-27 20:17:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan I read the outline.  Thanks for the tax increase. I lose my state tax deduction and my real estate taxes.  Nice tax increase for ny, ca, il

912887621596188673 2017-09-26 03:52:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> You literally need to drag the minority voters to the polls. When was the last time we there was a dem senator from AL?

912864686458228738 2017-09-26 02:21:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MzDivah67 If they don't keep him under control we will all be apostles in his self declared Jesus prophecy.
912864478592675845 2017-09-26 02:20:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MzDivah67 Roy Moore (Satan) is now coming to Washington. And you think trump is bad. This guy is the worst.
912864041730789376 2017-09-26 02:18:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TuckerCarlson 2 rich privileged idiots arguing over nonsense. So glad I came home from a 14 hour day for this headline
912863831692578817 2017-09-26 02:17:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TuckerCarlson His guest also has no argument. He's rich and privileged also.
912863128760840192 2017-09-26 02:15:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews You're an American elite as well.
912862439859015681 2017-09-26 02:12:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TuckerCarlson He is white and privileged what's his argument
912861597118423040 2017-09-26 02:08:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson You've ignored it until now so apparently the kneel is working if your bringing up discussing brutality
912860748686258176 2017-09-26 02:05:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CmdrAdama2017 @TheSWPrincess @RedTRaccoon @morethanmySLE @chillibeanboy @AynRandPaulRyan @DHStokyo @ybbkaren @decaro_nick @MattAsherS They will try and revisit and so this again. We need to start taking some seats at the midterms to prevent this down the road
912860478208188417 2017-09-26 02:04:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CmdrAdama2017 @TheSWPrincess @RedTRaccoon @morethanmySLE @chillibeanboy @AynRandPaulRyan @DHStokyo @ybbkaren @decaro_nick @MattAsherS Don't trust them they will attach it to 2019 budget after midterms and make the repeal in effect after general election. Anything to repeal
912859820138618885 2017-09-26 02:01:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Welcome to my world I wake up everyday ashamed that you're the president
912859678593470464 2017-09-26 02:01:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC But you don't feel ashamed calling us citizens sons of bitches.
912859447596343296 2017-09-26 02:00:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Now he'll be able to talk privately about allowing all his pals to pollute
912859234156589056 2017-09-26 01:59:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Is this so nobody can monitor all his corruption.
912858836612124672 2017-09-26 01:58:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar If 280 doesn't work maybe go to 180
912858640083759108 2017-09-26 01:57:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar It will cut back on the 1/ 2/...i so find myself wishing I had a few more characters to work with
912858343873634304 2017-09-26 01:56:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar 280 nits so bad.
912855983269048320 2017-09-26 01:46:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @harleydavidson @SpeakerRyan It will not. No matter how much tax cutting you do we will never compete against foreign labor. That's the whole issue.
912855043778412548 2017-09-26 01:42:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Are you sure that's a 2017. I though only the phone camera existed
912853796769976321 2017-09-26 01:37:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost It only took 110 years. Congrats to the ladies of Saudi Arabia.  Voting rights in 2015. Driving in 2017. No guardianship next?
912848668516024320 2017-09-26 01:17:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy Was that before the election ? I'm sure now they'll come to bargaining table as the minority

912846686745178118 2017-09-26 01:09:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jack @yashar That would be perfect
912846385053134851 2017-09-26 01:08:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar We can't have editing. Too dangerous. Have to deal with delete and repost
912846015107158016 2017-09-26 01:07:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoeNBC Sadly my friends daughter asked me what VHS was when I mentioned it to her mom. I'm getting old.
912845744117305344 2017-09-26 01:05:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoeNBC My life as a teenager. I want it back.
912845317569220608 2017-09-26 01:04:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You contributed to the debt with your golf course... remember

912844062016901121 2017-09-26 00:59:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Should I like this tweet despite my paul Ryan feelings??? Hmmmm....
912776368265596928 2017-09-26 20:30:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @jsftennis Yes that's what we need to do
912771497260912640 2017-09-26 20:10:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @jsftennis Correctly you can have millions and pay a low percentage
912771415665004544 2017-09-26 20:10:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @jsftennis I don't want to raise taxes either on anyone either. The tax law is designed around the wealthy wealthy... if you structure things
912771077939630082 2017-09-26 20:09:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @jsftennis I was pointing that out. Technically they have enough taxes. They waster too much damn money
912716732166475779 2017-09-26 16:33:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan The people making 250k are actually paying a lot of taxes.  I'm a cpa.  It's the millionaires that are using the law to get around taxes
912716364237991936 2017-09-26 16:31:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Most of your base doesn't even pay that much tax and your tax cut plan does nothing for them
912693227031023617 2017-09-26 14:59:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 Actually Howard played the tapes today this is fake news !
912665134862143489 2017-09-26 13:08:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC We should have let Alabama secede from the union.

912662412221931522 2017-09-26 12:57:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Most of the kind words are for NY AND Cuomo
912662206319390720 2017-09-26 12:56:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump How's Puerto Rico mr president ? Are they doing better than the NFL?
912661931567263744 2017-09-26 12:55:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You call interfering in the NFL big progress. You are the worst president we've ever had and will ever have.
912512221145632769 2017-09-25 03:00:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie @BetteMidler Yeah the war that gave my dad cancer from agent orange. The war my dad fought so we could be free to kneel. Trumps an asshole

912511586681663488 2017-09-25 02:58:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LindseyGrahamSC @dwebbKHN The bill does nothing to lower the costs of insurance or healthcare

912490307434029057 2017-09-25 01:33:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me. There is a tweet from the past that contradicts all your current policies. All of them

912471988689653760 2017-09-25 00:20:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews Who expects any NASCAR to take a knee. I figured those are his base.
912471254552256512 2017-09-25 00:17:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RandPaul @SBAList @c80p78 @liberalinohio Yeah and my daughter was born at 35 weeks and weighed 8lbs and needed no help but in NY she's considered a premie and is plagued with that
912470920752697344 2017-09-25 00:16:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @noneyah321 You live in ny depending on where you're getting this increase anyway because cuomo changed the minimum wage rules.
912468532079857665 2017-09-25 00:07:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Alt_FedEmployee Do not trust rand Paul he's waivering. The only thing he hates more than this bill is the Aca and working with the democrats. He's a yes.
912373829066018816 2017-09-25 17:50:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @VP I personally know a woman who decided cigarettes were more important than health insurance so she took the penalty
912373686598029312 2017-09-25 17:50:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @VP Many residents of all states paid penalties. That meant they had income and decided not to get health insurance.
912373426114920454 2017-09-25 17:49:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It does if that's why they are kneeling
912373234913435648 2017-09-25 17:48:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @pw_cunningham @BillCassidy @costareports Then she def needs to vote no

912169588925849600 2017-09-24 04:19:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt 6/ along with a number of other fixes.
912169491538247681 2017-09-24 04:18:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt 5/ and we need essential benefits plans
912169432289554434 2017-09-24 04:18:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt 4/ we need sort of an alacarte of plans to make this work. Ones that appeal to young 27 to 34 year single people.
912168847549005824 2017-09-24 04:16:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt 3/ maybe offer some plans that don't cover maternity or bc for older Americans
912167841826304001 2017-09-24 04:12:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt 2/ bipartisan effort going forward if this bill dies is going to have to address some cheap catastrophic plan as a compromise.
912167554206064641 2017-09-24 04:11:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt Let me play devils advocate here.  Many of the trump supporters want these plans. They need to kill this horrible bill but any

912148179864424449 2017-09-24 02:54:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Andrea6Mitchell @illdoitagain @tonikuehl12 Yes many NFL owners came out in support of the players

912120475685474304 2017-09-24 01:04:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I could go on all night. Plus with reduction to itemized deductions you're really giving them a tax increase
912120226220789760 2017-09-24 01:03:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ As a cpa this is awful. A pass though entity that generates 30k is taxed at less than 25%. So they would be giving them a tax increase.

912096873909047301 2017-09-24 23:30:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheNFLBoycott @NFL @Patriots @NYDailyNews Protest but don't get called names and ridiculed.
912096745504505858 2017-09-24 23:29:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheNFLBoycott @NFL @Patriots @NYDailyNews But he absolutely said people have that right and that's what he fought for.  He wants to live in a country where people peacefully
912096476272226304 2017-09-24 23:28:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheNFLBoycott @NFL @Patriots @NYDailyNews He says it gave him such honor to know that his fight was so they could stand out there and protest free. He doesn't even agree per se
912096051124981760 2017-09-24 23:26:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheNFLBoycott @NFL @Patriots @NYDailyNews My dad also told me that when he got back from Vietnam soldiers sometimes weren't treated great by protesters of the war

912024092878032897 2017-09-24 18:41:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu He'll never understand. He's a narcissist and they always make everything about themselves. He doesn't respect those who dissent
912023656049577984 2017-09-24 18:39:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @MzDivah67 I have to say I like Conway in orange

912017971312316416 2017-09-24 18:16:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @ezralevin They are busy robbing America of healthcare and also Puerto Rican's don't vote for presidents so he doesn't care
912016605554626560 2017-09-24 18:11:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @newtgingrich @FoxNews He's irrelevant and he's always been fringe and extreme
912016367267827712 2017-09-24 18:10:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnFugelsang @Visitkarte @drlipman And it always contradicts. He only supports free speech for himself and those that agree with him.
912008810188992513 2017-09-24 17:40:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @danibostick Didn't know his job was commentator on NFL players. My bad
912008487059804163 2017-09-24 17:39:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomiLahren My grandfather died for this country and my dad is a disabled Vietnam vet. He says he fought so we could kneel or stand our choice.
912008218989211649 2017-09-24 17:37:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomiLahren You have that right because of veterans like my dad and my grandfather.
912007889589604353 2017-09-24 17:36:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP Prepared to face that personal and private choice. It felt ok to know the choice was available for my family to decide.
912007717195276288 2017-09-24 17:35:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP I got pregnant at 42 and took the genetic profile test at 10 weeks.  This decision is very personal and private. No Down syndrome but I was

912002368476188673 2017-09-24 17:14:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CLewandowski_ @FoxNews It's about what's on the table now and the replacement sucks so we keep the old until there's better.  To just vote on past ideal is wrong
912002149957214208 2017-09-24 17:13:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CLewandowski_ @FoxNews What part do the republicans not get. They had 7 years to come up with a bill and they came up with garbage.  It's not about past promise
912000923752427520 2017-09-24 17:08:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost Really we pay you to comment on the NFL?  Do your job. If you have all this excess time to comment on the NFL maybe we should fire you.
912000304757067776 2017-09-24 17:06:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nyjets @realDonaldTrump @NFL @NYDailyNews @edjsandoval I was just in the bagel place and the treasury secretary is busy giving his opinion on the NFL. Really? He has nothing to do apparently.

911977311301455873 2017-09-24 15:35:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @bendreyfuss @ugsadkid Twitter may have finally made me speechless.  People are so dumb and heinous

911746436999651329 2017-09-23 00:17:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Trump You have to give respect to get some. Why don't you lead by example
911746256497774594 2017-09-23 00:17:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You have repeatedly insulted a war hero, woman, men, and yes veterans, anybody who doesn't support you.
911745156575055872 2017-09-23 00:12:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Trumps probably trying to cancel the act that made them citizens.  He's busy reviewing the documents

911687146687299587 2017-09-23 20:22:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ASlavitt Is it true the people testifying are the writers of the bill.  Why bother with a hearing if no one else is speaking

911431203680587776 2017-09-22 03:25:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kurteichenwald @jim_hollifield Opinion would be the same. He's always been a greedy elitist and always will
911431069345382400 2017-09-22 03:24:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kurteichenwald @jim_hollifield Trump is a fake, liar, narcissist,con artist and manipulator, he's a thug. He always has been. He could have ran on either ticket and my

911407657776492544 2017-09-22 01:51:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYGovCuomo The mainland USA needs to help Puerto Rico. They need money and boots on the ground. Trump where are you? I know your taking away my
911391409118355457 2017-09-22 00:46:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Yeah you'll steal it from the blue states
911391078170939402 2017-09-22 00:45:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy Your party is more ingested in repeal then actually putting forth a good bill.
911390803578286080 2017-09-22 00:44:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy This bill needs to fail and you need to reach across the aisle and fix the ACA
911390612183797760 2017-09-22 00:43:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy It Robs the elderly of Medicaid for nursing homes with block grants. You know your bill sucks because you tried to bribe Alaska and hi
911390179453276161 2017-09-22 00:42:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy How do you sleep at night your bill is against women's healthcare
911389833678983168 2017-09-22 00:40:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy There are not protections
911389785343881217 2017-09-22 00:40:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy You think the words adequate and affordable protect preexisting conditions they don't.  If your bill doesn't say you can't charge more then
911389418170277889 2017-09-22 00:39:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy You take away resources from ny to give to your own party States.  You got to have that Koch money. This bill is a disgrace and you lie
911389072127664128 2017-09-22 00:37:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BillCassidy No your bill kills protections for preexisting conditions.  I already pay 1443.00 a month and I can be charged 27k more .
911243740609744897 2017-09-22 15:00:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JuddLegum @tampagirl19655 @msloulou @calina_paige @twistedmic24 @Visitkarte @hollymwchris Exactly and we already pay most of the taxes.
911242803933532162 2017-09-22 14:56:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte You're not wrong. We should get to vote on it.
911239437060853760 2017-09-22 14:43:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte It feels like a ton!!! When I pay those quarterlies !  But it is going to finance ideals I don't agree with
911238750763716608 2017-09-22 14:40:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte To go over seas to actually use the stem Stella to save a sibling or myself or eventually her because of the science denial
911238546752667648 2017-09-22 14:39:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Oh don't even get me started on the science thing. I saved my babies stem cells by saving the cord.  It's kryo frozen. As if now I'd have
911238263301648384 2017-09-22 14:38:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte one party has def done more I'm just angry and feeling helpless with the way the electoral college is and how corrupt the whole system is.
911237483781918720 2017-09-22 14:35:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte I'm so angry
911237428991623169 2017-09-22 14:35:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte We pay a ton of taxes in ny basically funding red states
911237340013744129 2017-09-22 14:34:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Or my plan with my husband and child would be like 2350.
911237137772765184 2017-09-22 14:33:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Ny would literally have to fund billions to makeup for the cuts. It's impossible
911236991311908866 2017-09-22 14:33:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Insurance is very expensive. I pay 1443 for a gold plan for me and a child. My husband had other coverage
911236831118807041 2017-09-22 14:32:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte We do have a law about preexisting conditions since 1993 but it's still only protects from a 63 day lapse most wait periods are 90 days.
911236469758550016 2017-09-22 14:31:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Exactly
911236362136883201 2017-09-22 14:30:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte I'm going to do standup !
911236296705703938 2017-09-22 14:30:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte Both parties take lobby money, both have taken Koch money, Its all gross.  We have no independent thinkers in govt anymore
911236047392010242 2017-09-22 14:29:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @DemWrite @Visitkarte I'm not holding my breath at all. I'm living in NY hoping my state govt will counteract what awful laws this congress passes.
911231485138669573 2017-09-22 14:11:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan How about oct 19 1987 was that a good day or year.  Well I'm waiting ?
911215196005371904 2017-09-22 13:06:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods Who cares how much education she obtained. To beat a 4 year old to death in that heinous matter is not redeemable
911215007119134722 2017-09-22 13:06:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods She's deplorable!
911213689239425024 2017-09-22 13:00:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @Visitkarte @DemWrite It's disgusting but pretty unstoppable unless a few republican senators stand up for all people. Don't count it politics will prevail
911213345327509505 2017-09-22 12:59:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @Visitkarte @DemWrite Care about the masses. They want the Koch money and Conway is the ring leader of the Koch money.  Both parties want the lobby money
911213150619553792 2017-09-22 12:58:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @Visitkarte @DemWrite Catch what I'm saying only 30 to 40 % of the population controls most of electoral college. The Republicans want these votes. They don't
911212684217061377 2017-09-22 12:56:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateGOP @Visitkarte @DemWrite Trump blocked a cancer patient.This is about Koch money and lobby money and making 25 %of America and around 70 % electoral college happy
911211454732357632 2017-09-22 12:51:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan Remember Ryan they pay taxes also. Mr post card tax man
911211239493300224 2017-09-22 12:51:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan You'll need to rebuild Puerto Rico also the island is completely destroyed
911207645889036289 2017-09-22 12:36:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Sorry I cursed again I'm mad as hell that nobody wants to care about substance just getting even
911206348855169024 2017-09-22 12:31:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes All of it. Even the red states. Elderly people will not have ltc when the Medicaid cuts kick in and forget rehab and battling opioids
911206116142481408 2017-09-22 12:30:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes This is disgusting and disgraceful and any senator who votes for this garbage should lose their job in the next election. It hurts America
911205868510879744 2017-09-22 12:29:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes They don't want to fix and the senate admits they haven't read it and many admit it only matters to repeal not the substance
911205685270122498 2017-09-22 12:28:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Up further especially with the cuts. We'll have to find a way to pay for the Medicaid cuts. What can we do. Congress just wants to repeal
911205381510254593 2017-09-22 12:27:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes This bill is awful. If it passes I can only hope ny stays blue and keeps preexisting condition law. Ins will remain high in ny and will go
911203465254330370 2017-09-22 12:20:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @goldengateblond She can afford any amount for insurance and doctors so they don't care.
911202754873499651 2017-09-22 12:17:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @hunterhardage That's why birth control is important it prevents pregnancy it should be covered by all insurance and affordable as possible.
911087855199436802 2017-09-21 04:40:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @paulkrugman I'll be making changes every November
911087782562381824 2017-09-21 04:40:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @paulkrugman This is not what a senator is elected for. Shame on all of you. Just passing shit to save face.  Disgraceful
911087435299164161 2017-09-21 04:39:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @paulkrugman They even admit it's more important to them to repeal because they said they would than the actual substance of the bill.
911084292524056576 2017-09-21 04:26:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf Also birth control prevents unwanted babies which prevents abortions so it is life saving.
911082261214195713 2017-09-21 04:18:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOP @Visitkarte @JesseLehrich They have bought her vote.  She'll vote yes and this crap will pass. get ready for the lawsuits
911081710330068992 2017-09-21 04:16:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOP @Visitkarte @JesseLehrich Vote for our shit and you can keep your better than ours Aca
911080720415604736 2017-09-21 04:12:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar No more . I'm going to run that's it. Barbara rizzi for president  I'll bring the left and right to common ground
911080156189433858 2017-09-21 04:10:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Really spicer?  Just go home and don't come out for like 5 years.
911073319595778048 2017-09-21 03:43:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Let's just send trump and Kim on a vacation together and they don't come back until it's all fixed. We could all get off twitter and relax
911062702419857408 2017-09-21 03:00:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf I do think Medicaid has to cover it. Unwanted Babies and more welfare is more expensive
911062425654489088 2017-09-21 02:59:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf I'm against paying for insurance and birth control isn't covered that's it
911062310080282624 2017-09-21 02:59:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf I'm not against a copay
911062225892372482 2017-09-21 02:58:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf I'm for free life saving drugs also but can we agree that both sides take lobby money and this is why drug costs are so expensive anyway
911061847696117761 2017-09-21 02:57:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf If you pay insurance how is it they are free?
911059582893641728 2017-09-21 02:48:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf Anybody who has health insurance should have the option of getting birth control under that plan. Insurance isn't free
911059260188057600 2017-09-21 02:47:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @gobluesurf Medicaid should provide birth control because it's cheaper than a child
911059221566951424 2017-09-21 02:46:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> 3 people followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked byhttp://fllwrs.com

911058115373813761 2017-09-21 02:42:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @funder This is gross. Bernie sanders debating against repeal. He hates Aca and his socialist garbage will never pass anytime soon.

911044763452891136 2017-09-21 01:49:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @USMC_DDSS We actually have people in this country that think the earth is flat.
911043841729409024 2017-09-21 01:45:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NancyPelosi @RonaldP98241029 Thats because Washington is in the pockets of big pharma and insurance co.
911043279457841154 2017-09-21 01:43:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crooksandliars Guarantee they will try and bribe hawaii because it can't stand the Medicaid cuts. They are very poor
911043070392782849 2017-09-21 01:42:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @crooksandliars Crooked shit. File a lawsuit now to block it.
911042895427375106 2017-09-21 01:42:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz Wow this is the most corrupt shit ever.  Giving 2 states preferential treatment to get a vote that hurts ny, ca and other blues
911041784800776192 2017-09-21 01:37:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP I lose my real estate tax deduction, no union dues deduction, no medical expense deduction, no self employed health ins deduction
911041294474018821 2017-09-21 01:35:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Notice how the charitable stay, the investment income is only half of what you got . This is a rich mans tax form.  Shame on you.
911040263191252992 2017-09-21 01:31:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @coffee_mornin That's not even a source. In NY if you want birth control Its an obgyn.
911036823400587264 2017-09-21 01:17:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree How can any human be against birth control.  Nobody forces anybody to take it.  It's all choice. Wtf is wrong with people?
911035364957151232 2017-09-21 01:12:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @Jgigi8 This tweet doesn't even make sense
911035143263006720 2017-09-21 01:11:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KeepBCFree @coffee_mornin Not any dr can do birth control it requires a pelvic exam and Pap smear and that is an obgyn. That's how it is in my state
911033783025065985 2017-09-21 01:05:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheDemocrats New Yorkers should revolt not pay a dime in taxes until they get representation in govt.  see how the red states do without our money
911033522470752257 2017-09-21 01:04:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheDemocrats Republicans talk about Hillary and corruption. This bill is the most politically corrupt garbage ever. It's clearly red state friendly
911032626793926656 2017-09-21 01:01:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheDemocrats Based on that chart New York is basically funding every other state. We get treated the worst by the federal govt and contribute the most

905122210825764866 2017-09-05 17:35:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods @TimCrise The IRS checks all dependents.  Everything is electronic.  They have cracked down on that.  You instantly get an efile failure.

903307205344186369 2017-08-31 17:23:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mckaycoppins Of course because the democrats will elect some unpopular socialist who can't get votes from Midwest, south and swing states.

901427940717719552 2017-08-26 12:55:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @joepabike @SenDuckworth Well congress will you step in and block the ban with legislation ? Step up
901427402039021568 2017-08-26 12:53:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @kylegriffin1 According to trump he gets treated unfairly by the press. The press doesn't cover his issues.
901427072970756096 2017-08-26 12:52:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @RVAwonk Don't forget about his deplorable record on sexual assault cases

901424056632737792 2017-08-26 12:40:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @OMGno2trump Pence is worse than trump I never call for impeachment because the alternative is worse. At least trump is disliked in Washington
901423583280459777 2017-08-26 12:38:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ananavarro This is his drained swamp
901422937999368196 2017-08-26 12:35:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GDVegasK @JackPosobiec I'll ask CNN
901422003365842944 2017-08-26 12:32:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Again bottom line I now have a crappy oxford plan that's expensive and less coverage
901421772444233728 2017-08-26 12:31:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom The other people can't be relatives or you have to have 90 percent enrollment out if your 4 employees meaning all of them
901421541367439361 2017-08-26 12:30:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom I'm being punished because I only have 2 or 3 people for insurance. Every year the insurance companies make it harder
901421169961816066 2017-08-26 12:28:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom We need a solution for very tiny businesses and sole proprietors.  Not everybody totes a w2 from corporate America.  I need insurance also
901420858220183556 2017-08-26 12:27:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Because the repeal would leave me with no insurance choices either. It wasn't fixing the small market problem
901420697414717442 2017-08-26 12:26:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom I already sucked it up and have enrolled in a new plan.  I'll pay my extra 900 for shitty coverage and wait for an aca fix
901420068411723776 2017-08-26 12:24:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Yes I said it needs fixing.  I also just told you it's my 2000 not yours so don't worry about it.
901419876421644289 2017-08-26 12:23:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Your money it's mine
901419834151497728 2017-08-26 12:23:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Obamacare needs fixing but all of the republican trump plans sucked worse.  Bottom line I now pay 2000 for health insurance abs that ain't
901418098246504448 2017-08-26 12:16:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MayorStanton At 85 he'll be dead soon enough.  Nail the lid shut. Throw the dirt on and end that chapter.  Soon nature will step in and solve for us.
901417208554901504 2017-08-26 12:13:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StacyLStiles My other comment on schooling I'll keep to myself
901417103202414592 2017-08-26 12:12:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StacyLStiles Wall is a waste of money. Better ways to secure boarder.  One day any wall built will be destroyed so let's not bother
901416850248130560 2017-08-26 12:11:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StacyLStiles I want to comment so bad but I'm going to be nice.
901410531218771968 2017-08-26 11:46:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom I'm not saying the Aca doesn't need fixing it does but trumps sabotage is hurting worse and ultimately my family and my employees lost.
901410320819920896 2017-08-26 11:45:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom For big copays and high deductibles and only 2 companies to choose from for small employer market.
901410141723136000 2017-08-26 11:44:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom The bottom line is small groups 2, 3, 4, 5 we need stable healthcare. I don't get subsidies.  I was already paying 1100.00.  Now about 2000
901409629758001153 2017-08-26 11:42:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Of the future of healthcare and trumps constant rants about cutting off funding and further destabilization of the market they are out
901409227369054210 2017-08-26 11:41:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @MiddleClazzMom Yes they have because they are small and localized. The state stepped in and contributed 100 million dollars but because of the uncertainty
901266341331709952 2017-08-25 02:13:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @mmfa The fact that he speaks to the whacko shows what your dealing with
901266030047227904 2017-08-25 02:12:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN It actually is good that it was vetoed. It's not good. Our governor did it in ny and it's killing all the small businesses
901264906506424320 2017-08-25 02:07:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JoeNBC @crampell Trump has no respect for the bill of rights or the constitution.

901263065852805120 2017-08-25 02:00:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely My prayers are with you and all your fellow Texans. I remember when hurricane sandy devasted my home town in 2012.  I'm praying for y'all

901259052612759554 2017-08-25 01:44:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @andylassner Because of trumps sabotage. At least he lost 1 but my rural relatives won't budge despite not getting one benefit from him
901258606930276355 2017-08-25 01:42:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @andylassner Is it really dwindling. I know by at least 1 it is. My old dad loved him until I told him his granddaughter lost her health ins today
901258185008402432 2017-08-25 01:41:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU Thank god for the ACLU

895258817109389313 2017-08-09 12:21:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan A lot of evangelicals are eager for the end of days. It would be wise for me trump to steer clear of these lunatics.
895258364002934785 2017-08-09 12:20:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Sorry about spelling ran out of room

894382886912221184 2017-08-06 02:21:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC The president made no mention I guess he supports terrorism against our Muslim citizens. If this was a church ?  Forget about it

894274832426307584 2017-08-06 19:11:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods You're a propaganda promoting tool
894274481748889600 2017-08-06 19:10:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton @WajahatAli Because under the current administration it's ok to terrorize anybody who's Muslim

894183819175243776 2017-08-06 13:10:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Your White House leaks don't blame the press.  Trump seemed to support leaks when they benefited him.

893454528967737344 2017-08-04 12:52:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Tweet the list of jobs.
893363100740706304 2017-08-03 06:48:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 Almost no 10 employee company can absorb 84k in salary increase plus thousand more in insurance and pr taxes.
893362656639406082 2017-08-03 06:47:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 10 employees that's 2000 per week on gross pay alone. That's 8k per month and 84k a year.
893362341194211328 2017-08-03 06:45:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 The difference between 10 and 15 hr is 200 per week not accounting for gl and wc ins inc. and the increased pr taxes. Times that by

893360139209768964 2017-08-03 06:37:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 You don't know shit about business
893360095823876096 2017-08-03 06:36:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 Support that mark up
893360063791988736 2017-08-03 06:36:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 It's a 1 register person women's clothing boutique.  The people who apply to work are 18. They don't ask for 15.00 and retail doesn't
893359657921785856 2017-08-03 06:35:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 I have 2 manufactures in NYC. As soon as they have to give the factory that kind of increase here comes the pink slips.
893359467143847936 2017-08-03 06:34:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 Manufacturing is almost dead in NYC and Ny. The 15.00 minimum wage will finish it off.
893359185521463296 2017-08-03 06:33:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 All my restaurant clients are going to reduce staff to make up for the 5.00 an hour increase.
893358921007681536 2017-08-03 06:32:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 My employees are 18 years old

893358322740547584 2017-08-03 06:29:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 It's not fair to very small 2 to 3 people part time employers
893358195011457024 2017-08-03 06:29:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 The payroll the same
893358164158152705 2017-08-03 06:29:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KamalaHarris @jrivera64 It does.  I see it in my client payrolls. Not everything is a national number. I'm hands on abs I'm telling you my clients lay off to keep
893344698819121152 2017-08-03 05:35:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews @Chefmudshark Well said.
893344472314118144 2017-08-03 05:34:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump So tired of the campaigning but keep it up while your agenda goes nowhere and the grand jury investigates your family
893343681150947328 2017-08-03 05:31:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris We need to educate and generate high paying quality jobs and not force businesses to over pay for unskilled workers.
893343267328335873 2017-08-03 05:30:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris Go ahead and slam me but the economic truth is the truth and the 15.00 hour living wage mandate is a bad idea.
893343091603755008 2017-08-03 05:29:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris Making extra money before college or during. Not a job for somebody to try and raise 3 kids on.
893342951669157889 2017-08-03 05:28:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris It's a hard truth to swallow but some jobs are not careers. I'm sorry but fry cook at McDonald was and is meant to be a teenager
893342617072807936 2017-08-03 05:27:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris I'm a cpa and NY has passed this and we are prepared to reduce labor to counteract
893342409060487169 2017-08-03 05:26:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris Businesses will reduce the work force to make up for the forced increased payroll.
893342284732878848 2017-08-03 05:26:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris In  Seattle from the 15.00 minimum wage and ultimately it costs jobs.

893342074887708673 2017-08-03 05:25:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris I support a living wage with exceptions and limitations.  It's killing business in Seattle
893341842833633281 2017-08-03 05:24:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jrivera64 @KamalaHarris Not all work is worth 600.00 a week and not every job is meant to be a career.

893337849151488000 2017-08-03 05:08:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ProudResister They should ask themselves why they get jobs that kill them but Wisconsin gets the iPhone assembly factory. Electoral college votes.

893318899852357632 2017-08-03 03:53:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheEconomist Of course this is the Keebler elf being his usual racist self.  Trying to keep minorities poor and without education.

893226472424517632 2017-08-03 21:46:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Considering they all want coal mines and black lung and he wants to make sure no one has insurance I'm not sure why they like him

892583291727073280 2017-08-01 03:10:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews You can't support the republican rich person tax reform. That's all it is more money for trump, corporate America, tax free inheritances for
892582972548931584 2017-08-01 03:08:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews 12 to 20 percent.  If you can't say your getting more each week from the tax reform and your not seeing it on your tax return.
892582338785312768 2017-08-01 03:06:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Itemized deductions.  Lower flat tax rates instead of bracket marginal always benefit the rich. They go from 35 to 20. You go from
892581359755157504 2017-08-01 03:02:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Next Friday when I get my check will it be higher from trump cutting the corporate tax rate, eliminating the estate tax, taking away
892580838721847297 2017-08-01 03:00:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews For every person who truly pays tax. Next time you collect your pay.  Once they reveal the tax reform plan ask yourself this?
892579984543559680 2017-08-01 02:57:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Cut. I'll take it.  His lower flow through tax benefits my self employed ass but does nothing for your w2 employee.
892579632133877763 2017-08-01 02:55:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews These republican tax reform ideas are all for the rich.  The middle class will pay more. If that asshole trump wants to give me a tax
892579167774142464 2017-08-01 02:53:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Reconciliation or not this is no easy task. What's sad is trumps base thinks these tax plans benefit them.  As a CPA I can assure them
892577499481346049 2017-08-01 02:47:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR The policy makers ask this. It's called big pharma drug lobby and they know all about it. They accept millions from them
892577124330209281 2017-08-01 02:45:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity You spent 8 years practicing the double standard. Just change your name to sean hypocrisy

892573864131166208 2017-08-01 02:32:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Can we at least let trump have the old ones.
892572019086295040 2017-08-01 02:25:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @mcwm It's really not all about the taxes.
892570557811654656 2017-08-01 02:19:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @KimBenabib @Joryls And it's not that simple
892570207218225152 2017-08-01 02:18:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @KimBenabib I assume this was more like a funny !
892570088137797633 2017-08-01 02:17:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @KimBenabib You clearly don't understand corporate accounting or tax at all.
892569036147625984 2017-08-01 02:13:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahLerner Have to quickly check math. If they all voted no he doesn't get confirmed. Wtf.

892566423691776003 2017-08-01 02:03:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews The stock market is over valued. Dodd frank repealed means subprime mortgage disaster brewing. Min wage jobs no one can live off of. Thanks

892564527547650048 2017-08-01 01:55:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Because he's a communist dictator not the leader of a democracy.

892561717632413697 2017-08-01 01:44:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei My father would never do this. He was a military guy and has honor he didn't teach me to collude lie and cover up.
892559790878191621 2017-08-01 01:36:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews He already has ruined it with his gold everywhere. Gaudy and hideous.
892559585889878016 2017-08-01 01:36:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews If this is true he truly has no respect for this country. It's a historic home.

892553742062694400 2017-08-01 01:12:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @mitchellreports @ddale8 How come nobody calls him out on this. I may pack my shit sell my house and relocate to Washington so I can call him out on his bs.
892547651153129472 2017-08-01 00:48:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews This is just comical.
892547171349921793 2017-08-01 00:46:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Really we are suing universities for discriminating against white people. Wow. What a real slap in the face to all who died for civil rights
892471230372171782 2017-08-01 19:44:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman Breast fed that they are somehow healthier or smarter. None of the research proves that.  Everybody enjoy what the prefer. I'm a def no.
892470988511866880 2017-08-01 19:43:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman To each his own. I'm not the breast feed fan and I'm not scientifically convinced.  There is no evidence in adults or children that were
892372061468938241 2017-08-01 13:10:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman Also show me the millions of American children harmed by no breast feeding. Wait they don't exist . How's that for science. Show them to me
892365095006818304 2017-08-01 12:43:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman When you can actually get pregnant and breastfeed then get an opinion.
892364915771662336 2017-08-01 12:42:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman By the way aren't you a man!
892364869235855361 2017-08-01 12:42:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman I don't care is you think anything is anecdotal  I know what goes on with my baby and her 1 sick visit in 15 months.  Have a nice day.
892364289289465856 2017-08-01 12:40:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman I hope all the moms who Brest feed have happy healthy babies as I did without
892364193399222272 2017-08-01 12:39:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman I am fully aware of the scientific research and I don't agree. I'm entitled to my opinion as you are yours:
892357323242573824 2017-08-01 12:12:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews @sanctionedman The immunity claim doesn't work for me and I get the free thing. My baby has a great immune system and it had nothing to do with bf.
892181249871269888 2017-07-31 00:32:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews Cranky from colic, in my personal opinion as it pertains to me. I see no benefit to it.  I'm glad I did not breast feed.
892180363031851009 2017-07-31 00:29:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews My 15 month old was never sick, slept through the night, never c
892180145771081728 2017-07-31 00:28:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews I have to say I disagree with all experts on breast feeding. I think it's completely overrated.
892179542592430080 2017-07-31 00:25:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ That hurts Americans as well idiot

891903063946035200 2017-07-30 06:07:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @Visitkarte Don't even get me started on Ronald Reagan. I got to work tomorrow and I'll be bashed all day If I post my thoughts
891901481737228288 2017-07-30 06:00:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @MrDane1982 They are both wrong. Russia needs to have tough sanctions. They are our enemy.
891900908635860993 2017-07-30 05:58:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @kylegriffin1 As much as I think it's an absolute waste of taxpayer money. It's part of the reason nothing gets done. Distractions all the time. Love it.
891898589294854148 2017-07-30 05:49:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Lawrence Show the country you can handle North Korea.
891898154970382336 2017-07-30 05:47:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Lawrence Ask yourself how they get the enriched uranium for nuke? Another country is helping ? Iran , Russia, Pakistan, china, ...
891897732117524480 2017-07-30 05:46:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Lawrence She was not the right choice for the Job from the beginning but she can't do shit about n Korea. We can't rely on China. Send in drones
891897329963479041 2017-07-30 05:44:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar The list goes on and on.
891897110144135168 2017-07-30 05:43:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar The United States has to expect some push back from Putin. Russia is not our friend. The arm the taliban in Afghanistan, support Assad

891864174854365184 2017-07-30 03:32:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie They don't want birth control or abortion but then say single mothers are a drain on welfare and Medicaid. Insanity
891781282543394816 2017-07-30 22:03:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @FoxNews Try being bipartisan instead of polarizing

891759090342514688 2017-07-30 20:35:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Aren't you playing golf today
891755323329052674 2017-07-30 20:20:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnKasich @FoxNews How you could respect Donald trump is beyond comprehension.
891753469824184320 2017-07-30 20:12:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews No because no one is going to Jail and it is a waste taxpayer money.
891752328361115648 2017-07-30 20:08:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AGLynch @HillaryClinton @FoxNews Because we aren't wasting enough taxpayer money.  Because we haven't already investigated that crap.
891738524118126592 2017-07-30 19:13:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @FoxNews Boo hoo ! Should have picked a leader that doesn't insult and bully and act like a dictator. Congress does not work for him

891737316443770880 2017-07-30 19:08:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jaketapper This is because John McCain has left so he thinks he can now push through with mike pence.  What a dictator.  I'm so angry today

891697431829762048 2017-07-30 16:30:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie @crzyinthedesert Because some Man thought she would be a nice hot piece of ass for conservatives to look at on tv.
891695841861394433 2017-07-30 16:23:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost Of course. Trump is a hateful bigot who instigated violence. He wants to be a dictator so badly.

891658775899369473 2017-07-30 13:56:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei She's too stupid to realize that she has that because of Obamacare.  I don't even comment on her stuff because she's so "dumb"

891656652176461825 2017-07-30 13:48:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @KellyannePolls @FoxNewsSunday Maybe we should withhold our taxes from this president. Since he doesn't want to use them as the law requires. I'll put mine in escrow.
891656193353150464 2017-07-30 13:46:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @FoxNewsSunday Wow you finally have looked in the mirror and self reflected . Thought this day would never come skeleton.
891655748513673216 2017-07-30 13:44:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN I challenge trump to an IQ test right now. I'm telling you if he gets a 90 I'd be surprised.
891655579080544256 2017-07-30 13:43:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN We don't agree on much but this I'll agree with him on. It is wreckless and irresponsible and incomprehensible. Trump is just a moron.
891655004523778048 2017-07-30 13:41:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @soledadobrien The lives of the Wall Street rich are interesting to say the least. You should be at one of the real Wall Street parties. Talk about gutter.
891654661115195392 2017-07-30 13:40:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix Greece is not the safest place. Sorry to say. People I know got assaulted by drunks there and police did nothing
891654375545995265 2017-07-30 13:39:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @soledadobrien @kylegriffin1 You can't take trump anywhere. When he leaves there is an aftermath of Apologies and statements of we don't agree with that etc.

891650656196493313 2017-07-30 13:24:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You could end up a lame duck president. Just because Paul Ryan got bought by 1 factory coming to his state doesn't mean shit.
891650304768454656 2017-07-30 13:22:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump And you assume you'll have the senate and the house you're whole presidency. That's a gamble I wouldn't take.
891650042771234818 2017-07-30 13:21:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Good leaders know how to govern in a bipartisan way. Not just change the rules when things aren't going as planned

891520705036201984 2017-07-29 04:47:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost @ambasalas Call me liberal because I don't give a crap who marries who or who identifies as fm or ml. I believe in birth control instead of

891492257634947073 2017-07-29 02:54:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell Kids see what a bully he is and he's the president so it must be ok
891490024683970560 2017-07-29 02:45:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Rosie @4everNeverTrump We know he's surrounding himself with yes men

891488535903166465 2017-07-29 02:40:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Nothing's ever your fault. What a loser
891488430810705920 2017-07-29 02:39:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan I bet the combined IQ of all of them is 75
891488245279838208 2017-07-29 02:38:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're really the worst president ever. Take some responsibility. What are you doing about n Korea, china ? Nothing you're on twitter.
891487854387396613 2017-07-29 02:37:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Really ? Get over it. You are over reacting
891487069347950592 2017-07-29 02:34:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Other than kellyann Conway she's the dumbest person on twitter
891485911472644097 2017-07-29 02:29:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar No because the zookeeper is nuts
891485797337231361 2017-07-29 02:29:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump The Christian Right got you elected. End of story .
891485267537924097 2017-07-29 02:27:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Her lack of intelligence is amazing
891483688273412096 2017-07-29 02:20:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @carloszuniga316 @robin_hauff @JustDawnlefties At the thought of growing up in a country run by trump
891480942144929792 2017-07-29 02:09:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It's your responsibility to do something.  They aren't pointing missiles at china.
891480026906021889 2017-07-29 02:06:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FifthKentucky The south fought only to keep salves. End of story.
891470406988820480 2017-07-29 01:28:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It doesn't work that way.   You just vote on the same piece of garbage until someone changes their mind or has cancer treatment
891331770834145281 2017-07-29 16:17:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Dictators always try to squash democracy.
891330227300954112 2017-07-29 16:11:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MeghanMcCain @SenJohnMcCain @Alyssa_Milano @cindymccain You stood up for Americans over party. Not many can do it.
891316841628540928 2017-07-29 15:17:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Alyssa_Milano @SenJohnMcCain It would be nice but as you can see this morning. Trump just wants to change the rules.
891316479928537088 2017-07-29 15:16:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump I couldn't help that last part of my comment after reading the govt spends 84 mill on viagra.
891316206262726656 2017-07-29 15:15:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Other than what the scpd does with gangs they are suburban cops dealing with affluent suburb issues. Catch what I'm getting at
891315837847711744 2017-07-29 15:13:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely He's so disgusting our police department had to issue a statement.  They really weren't supporting his call for brutality. It was awkward.
891314410211483649 2017-07-29 15:08:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews It's already a failure
891314298622013441 2017-07-29 15:07:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Kids write letters to presidents all the time why is this news
891314176366440449 2017-07-29 15:07:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Who cares
891313792541491200 2017-07-29 15:05:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @SHABOOTY He'd be sucking all day you don't think it works without viagra. Barron is the last time it worked
891313383290662912 2017-07-29 15:04:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It's called bipartisan legislation
891313256891129856 2017-07-29 15:03:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump We just need to get rid of you.
891311201971470337 2017-07-29 14:55:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @BklynSprngWtr Insurance companies often won't give insurance for factories without drug testing. OSHA regs and other issues.
891310386405933057 2017-07-29 14:52:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @BklynSprngWtr You absolutely don't understand employer liability relating to workers compensation insurance and business liability insurance
891309637475192832 2017-07-29 14:49:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @SkyNews Because trump cares so much about the constitution. You know innocent until proven guilty
891153369250836480 2017-07-28 04:28:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump That's very easy to do. Keep you out of our country, out of our communities and we'll be safe.
891151197134041088 2017-07-28 04:19:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SebGorka @VP What success. You're admin is in chaos. Too many puffs on the crack pipe
891147131775528961 2017-07-28 04:03:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @InxsyS They will leave my classroom with an F
891147014192463872 2017-07-28 04:02:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @InxsyS I'm sorry I fail every one of those kids.
891123759528194050 2017-07-28 02:30:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Reince @FoxNews Where is your self respect
891123289711575040 2017-07-28 02:28:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @chrislhayes @GPDBenTobias We did not appreciate his speech on Long Island. The SCPD had to make a statement
891121174704521217 2017-07-28 02:20:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz If the hospital doesn't have his name on it he doesn't care
891120793618350081 2017-07-28 02:18:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar It's disgusting none the less.  And it's not helping tigers.
891120588969959424 2017-07-28 02:17:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar This is where I get off your train. Trophy hunting is disgusting.
891118256160985091 2017-07-28 02:08:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @seanhannity It's not that bad please get the suicide thoughts out if your head.  It will be ok.
891116920958840833 2017-07-28 02:03:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It's a democracy not a dictatorship
891116762531586048 2017-07-28 02:02:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Changing to simple majority is not what was intended
891116449347096577 2017-07-28 02:01:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump I suggest you tone down your nasty rhetoric and reach across the aisle
891060776974331904 2017-07-28 22:20:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NancyPelosi @sassygayrepub Any gay or transgender person supporting trump needs to enter therapy now to figure out why
891060193458626561 2017-07-28 22:17:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews He fires everyone who disagrees with him.   Mooch purged his twitter and said he only cares about trump agenda. He's a yes man
891058940561240064 2017-07-28 22:13:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Do us all a favor
891058913403179008 2017-07-28 22:12:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Just stop guarding it
891058511467225088 2017-07-28 22:11:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @gabbygal2013 @NOMAD_NP @bklynborn1971 How much did it personally cost you ?
891057751924899840 2017-07-28 22:08:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Right ? Seriously let's random drug test him
891056360984588288 2017-07-28 22:02:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar They have had a couple of incidents but they are not known for brutality and roughing up people arrested
891056175390875648 2017-07-28 22:02:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar It does and the scpd does not need that
891056034349015040 2017-07-28 22:01:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump At least you admit you're not the star.
891055676973350914 2017-07-28 22:00:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan We want to evict him from trump tower
891055598330142722 2017-07-28 21:59:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan This is not trump land. Even his old friends I. Nyc turn backs on him.
891055486019280898 2017-07-28 21:59:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan The cops are just faking support believe me. Here in ny we openly walk around saying everything and anything and no one defends him
891054882240835584 2017-07-28 21:56:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan He's gross
891054541885648898 2017-07-28 21:55:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Scaramucci @yashar She's smart she wants half that 90 million
891054304408342529 2017-07-28 21:54:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Now that's smart
891053710499082240 2017-07-28 21:52:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really that's why you let mooch publicly degrade him with obscenities. Stop being a hypocrite
891046378373361664 2017-07-28 21:23:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews You getting elected does nothing to change that in ny. Take that shit back to Texas
891046219258228736 2017-07-28 21:22:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews I hope that 2nd amendment speech  wasn't on Long Island. The police dept issues most permits and Its almost impossible to get one.
891045616981245953 2017-07-28 21:20:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Please leave ny asap. We hate you here.
890970268230762497 2017-07-28 16:20:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost They work for us. When you learn that maybe you'll be able to govern.
890970185649225728 2017-07-28 16:20:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost No the senate did what the American people asked of them.  Ignored your bullying to destroy healthcare. Get over it. They don't work for you
890903655624445956 2017-07-28 11:55:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Your party could have tried to cross the aisle anytime. But you chose insults and threats.
890903149963247616 2017-07-28 11:53:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump How about you realize that there is only 1 option. It's called bipartisan reform. You are not the all powerful dictator you think you are.
890899187893710848 2017-07-28 11:38:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business No one cares Christie. Your just a statue in nj.
890896385704435712 2017-07-28 11:27:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Remember Washington is not a board room.
890896303156318208 2017-07-28 11:26:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Sucks to be you.
890895922657415168 2017-07-28 11:25:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump How you feeling about Washington this morning. We found 3 ppl to stand up to you. That's all we needed.  Welcome to Washington.
890894591334993920 2017-07-28 11:19:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MrTommyCampbell I love the new White House.
890810503508877312 2017-07-27 05:45:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business Wow you're a coward.
890810148259639296 2017-07-27 05:44:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar It's pathetic
890807533572505602 2017-07-27 05:34:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RealJamesWoods @BrandonTXNeely They are all snowflakes
890806625564368902 2017-07-27 05:30:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost It's more than back lash. In the private sector they'd get paid a boat load after filing an employment suit against them
890805816076279808 2017-07-27 05:27:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RyanLizza @Scaramucci @yashar The mentally ill attract to each other
890800623540617220 2017-07-27 05:06:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @SenDuckworth He can't relate he's a draft dodger.
890799985284993024 2017-07-27 05:04:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC That's not very impressive for the leader of the free world.  I'd like better then can walk and chew gum. Btw:  no way he's a big clutz
890799322945642496 2017-07-27 05:01:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RepBuddyCarter @AynRandPaulRyan @SpaceGhost84 The new America under trump. The bigots and sexist creeps feel empowered
890798642260459520 2017-07-27 04:58:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MichaelCBender @EliStokols @yashar Nice stance mooch. The I'm ready to piss all over stance. You're gross.
890797448632729600 2017-07-27 04:53:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan They can just reappoint him ? No ?
890796907211010051 2017-07-27 04:51:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Well of course it's the chain of command and foundation of the military. Also the end of the world.
890796633264226304 2017-07-27 04:50:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SHSanders45 @ZekeJMiller That would be why our country is in chaos.
890796260151578625 2017-07-27 04:49:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity @yashar Not in support of his boy trump.
890795750245793793 2017-07-27 04:47:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marinafang Only rich people care about filling out disclosure forms in govt imbecile kellyanne. Boo hoo it demoralizes. Get over it hag
890794951658754048 2017-07-27 04:44:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes @bhaktadasa Thankfully for the rest of us you're in Thailand and soon will be taking a dirt nap.
890791471221096449 2017-07-27 04:30:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan For NY we've known this narcissist, greedy, spineless bully for years. He's the same sleeze he always was. So sad he was able to con so many
890787542739558400 2017-07-27 04:14:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Worst everything in history
890786384784445441 2017-07-27 04:09:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovMikeHuckabee Coming from the man who supports child molesters and whose son murderd a dog and who's daughter has no integrity. Nice family

890785099662237698 2017-07-27 04:04:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei @grg_mc Wholesome. Trump said grab em by the pussy. His sons trophy hunt. Anyone wants the scoop on the trumps ask a New Yorker. We know them well
890783869187670016 2017-07-27 03:59:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews @SHSanders45 you are magnificently brain washed. Your dad had done a great job since birth
890783266629795841 2017-07-27 03:57:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews Because tampons and birth control cost too much
890783168193744896 2017-07-27 03:57:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews Soon women will be out also
890783021170704384 2017-07-27 03:56:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews The rest need not apply
890782984755757056 2017-07-27 03:56:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews He wants the greatest military but only the males and Christian's
890781786912849920 2017-07-27 03:51:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes @thehowie People pay for mandated auto and homeowners but scream that health ins is mandated. Priorities not in order.
890778479574343680 2017-07-27 03:38:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews But 84 million dollars for viagra is ok.

890424997017264129 2017-07-26 04:13:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @VP Really today's votes don't indicate that
890380488438935552 2017-07-26 01:17:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Something nice to read for a change
890379639595651073 2017-07-26 01:13:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @SimeonStandfast When I see a deal implemented before 2019 great. Again I don't care about trade enough I'm moving on to other issues tonight.
890378250614177797 2017-07-26 01:08:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @SimeonStandfast Same opinion there is no trade deal with Britain taking effect until they brexit. Trump likes to praise himself early. We'll see in 2 years
890327403012272129 2017-07-26 21:46:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @SimeonStandfast I actually don't care that much. I hope we get a good trade deal.
890327261429280768 2017-07-26 21:45:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @SimeonStandfast After they leave the eu they can implement. Teresa may will be gone by then
890327084433903619 2017-07-26 21:44:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ @SimeonStandfast They can talk but can't implement for like 2 years.  Announce it when it's real not imaginary
890319517431341056 2017-07-26 21:14:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @markknoller Bosses should not berate and insult subordinates in public. It's actually against the law.
890319098990784512 2017-07-26 21:13:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump I thought we had a separation of church and state? Am I misunderstanding the constitution or is the president a moron?
890317371805765633 2017-07-26 21:06:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @AynRandPaulRyan @PhotoWil He won't because he's a narcissist
890316915721330690 2017-07-26 21:04:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews I don't think so
890316779796520964 2017-07-26 21:03:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @EricTrump @FoxNews We want to country to succeed your father is failure all in his own.  He can't govern and your opinion is irrelevant
890316104920334336 2017-07-26 21:01:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Oh good start firing your cabinet filled with oil execs and Goldman Sachs execs
890294688208613380 2017-07-26 19:36:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You have nothing to do but just campaign. It's very sad
890294304496910336 2017-07-26 19:34:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @andylassner Or affect and effect or even there and their
890294008571940865 2017-07-26 19:33:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ You have not shown any evidence of that
890291182504378369 2017-07-26 19:22:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Don't worry we'll honor you by renaming all the polluted rivers and streams after you. You'll have a legacy as a polluter
890290873379979264 2017-07-26 19:20:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Joke or not you will never be on Mount Rushmore.

890286244399378432 2017-07-26 19:02:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP Didn't know that was a stand up show in Ohio
890285341445369858 2017-07-26 18:59:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP The women in congress stood up to you.  They were independent thinkers who didn't cave to your bullying.
890083227653853184 2017-07-25 05:35:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @JesseBWatters @FoxNews It's called a wife not the attorney general of the United States. Not the attorney general of trump org.
890082392773447681 2017-07-25 05:32:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Ignore him. He just wants to keep everybody quiet
890080199236362240 2017-07-25 05:23:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AdamSchiffCA People of low intelligence can only attack. Please can we IQ test trump. I'm betting 88 to 110
890079736587841537 2017-07-25 05:22:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AdamSchiffCA @jdraeger65 @DMMadora @emsmsh @WarriorsoWorld @coachcubs People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
890079036160049152 2017-07-25 05:19:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar I support that make trump fire him

890073253179424769 2017-07-25 04:56:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Every time he speaks I hate him more.
890070223101054977 2017-07-25 04:44:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP Teens will get pregnant, no abortions, no Medicaid, no food stamps, no affordable day care so no job, no welfare for rent.
890068387287752704 2017-07-25 04:36:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Have they given him an MRI for a tumor.
890067180049641472 2017-07-25 04:32:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Your crap on the American flag every day. Draft dodging, lying, no honor, no integrity. Counting the days until your gone
890065488700735489 2017-07-25 04:25:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Let me clarify. Your boasting about a deal that can't happen until 2019 and may is as hated as you. She'll be gone by then. It's a moot deal
890065135699668992 2017-07-25 04:23:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ For something that can't happen until 2019
890063435181981697 2017-07-25 04:17:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I'm not super far left though. I objectively look at all sides and arm myself with knowledge then make my choice
890063155841437696 2017-07-25 04:16:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I once was also. I saw the light.
890062956016410624 2017-07-25 04:15:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Do you ever tell the truth. They can't deal until brexit is done. Stop lying.
890062753146302466 2017-07-25 04:14:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Only because he can't get his agenda pushed past congress
890061741455028225 2017-07-25 04:10:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Omg I've been screaming this all day

890058383725932544 2017-07-25 03:57:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Why? According to her she stays out of politics. Nobody lawyers up for no reason.
890057620849119232 2017-07-25 03:54:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski His daughter is all over Fox News demanding a full repeal

890057165913894912 2017-07-25 03:52:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan He already got away with it. There's no consequences.  No matter what he does his base just tows the line. What's wrong with this country.
890054625138749440 2017-07-25 03:42:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Ask the Obamacare haters to tell you why and how it has hurt them and what it has cost them.
890053569621237761 2017-07-25 03:38:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews I read this chain. Do people from Texas really think minimum wage and food stamps are in Obamacare.

890050845903134721 2017-07-25 03:27:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jasoninthehouse @yashar Honestly he should be shaming deblasio and sending his picture out.
890046966708809729 2017-07-25 03:11:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz He's all about polluting and ruining the environment. Disgusting. What will they all do when there's nothing left to destroy
890039162467995652 2017-07-25 02:40:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're the only one torturing the American people.  Please go away.
890038273715953669 2017-07-25 02:37:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Stop whining and go ahead and fire him. You're already in the road to impeachment. Vegas is taking odds soon.
890037698970492928 2017-07-25 02:34:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You donated so much money to Hillary. She was at your wedding. You have no integrity. You're a hypocrite and liar. You're garbage.
890035126863876097 2017-07-25 02:24:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Of course waiting to strip millions of coverage

890032378927820801 2017-07-25 02:13:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Are you really this ignorant.  Please resign as soon as possible. You are the worst president ever.
889708940921057281 2017-07-24 04:48:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @soledadobrien @thehill It's just such a disrespectful disgraceful thing to do.  Trump is garbage.

889707834019119104 2017-07-24 04:44:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CoreyRobin @chrislhayes @haroldpollack @CunliffeMcBee We have the most people and pay the most taxes. But we actually have no say in govt at all. Our electoral college vote and congress
889707488395882498 2017-07-24 04:42:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CoreyRobin @chrislhayes @haroldpollack @CunliffeMcBee Because If they can take out the world financial capital they can cripple the global and us economy. Yeah ny and ca should get more say.
889707230194536449 2017-07-24 04:41:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CoreyRobin @chrislhayes @haroldpollack @CunliffeMcBee Don't forget ca, ny pay all the taxes and support the rest of the country.  Why do you think the terrorists come for ny

889703872964505605 2017-07-24 04:28:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar If you break down his stupid into: amazon kicks ivankas business ass and uses tax loopholes that she can't. He uses those same ones. Crybaby
889702859163525120 2017-07-24 04:24:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity @FoxNews What you refuse to realize is that they already are. It's just not yours or the presidents or congresses.  Get over it

889697697778814976 2017-07-24 04:03:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You use the same loop holes amazon uses. Congress gave them to all of you. You're just such a moron this statement is just so false.
889696520471293953 2017-07-24 03:59:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Don't forget the energy and hc lobby and we all know how you feel about taxes. Those are for the middle class.

889335646057353216 2017-07-23 04:05:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes It's standard in debt disputes for the creditor to prove they own the debt. If they can't they lose by dismal of debt. Don't lose paperwork
889333847049076736 2017-07-23 03:58:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump It's very sad that you need anyone to protect you 6 months in.  Stop your corrupt tactics and you won't need protection

887843014835621888 2017-07-19 01:14:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOPChairwoman @ZekeJMiller They want to fix what they have.
887842907440521216 2017-07-19 01:13:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOPChairwoman @ZekeJMiller Americans now see that the republican plan is  crap so they no longer want a repeal. They've told their congress why do you think it's dead
887780370921422848 2017-07-19 21:05:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar Jobs ... tremendous jobs...

887513272051781635 2017-07-18 03:23:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN Ask trump why he knows.
887507431911280640 2017-07-18 03:00:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @yashar @michellebhasin Old boring news.
887506975671685120 2017-07-18 02:58:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS That's nice maybe in 3.5 years you'll be done announcing intent
887506479770718210 2017-07-18 02:56:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski We need to replace the house and senate. All of them !
887506352591056896 2017-07-18 02:56:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski So true.
887504415850147841 2017-07-18 02:48:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @RandPaul @FoxNews It's called they want to keep their jobs in 2018

887503856271319040 2017-07-18 02:46:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I wish I could like this one 1,000 times myself!
887503642626052097 2017-07-18 02:45:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Tomorrow they can all have lunch and decide how to screw everybody with a new tax bill.
887500908166340608 2017-07-18 02:34:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan I assure you it's based totally on your utter lack of intelligence and ignorant statements.
887500522814681088 2017-07-18 02:33:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @Visitkarte @tedlieu Plus he assumes his party will control congress in 2 years. Wouldn't it be ironic if they repealed, wait and lose the majority.
887499303807320064 2017-07-18 02:28:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Under your plan most people have no insurance so of course that's cheaper.
887499069496709120 2017-07-18 02:27:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MrTommyCampbell Well said.
887498924042452993 2017-07-18 02:26:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews He can't fix Obamacare.  But smart people can
887498169420066816 2017-07-18 02:23:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I hope they are into open rudeness, open pissing, open barfing, open sex in the street. Wtf really
887497632079388672 2017-07-18 02:21:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HouseGOP @BillPascrell It takes time to see effects of economic changes.
887497509735731205 2017-07-18 02:21:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HouseGOP @BillPascrell They are still riding the job train from the old administration.
887497360833642497 2017-07-18 02:20:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC He's frustrated with continued ignorance of congress
887497078808743936 2017-07-18 02:19:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan @EdwardTHardy I'm fine with him as a lame duck

887496471549022208 2017-07-18 02:17:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @attn @GeorgeTakei It is maybe this video will help. Most people don't understand the issue
887494604253278208 2017-07-18 02:09:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYDailyNews What do you expect there are people who think the earth is flat.  Most of this planet is filled with idiots.
887492964691435520 2017-07-18 02:03:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ They need to ban all the food.  It just smells and brings bugs and people are slobs. You can't go for a subway ride without eating really
887492360023748608 2017-07-18 02:00:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Because he's a useless bought and paid for tool.
887489282251902976 2017-07-18 01:48:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @david_avella @FoxNews Since we have a miraculous drop we don't need to waste any tax dollars on an ineffective expensive ugly wall
887489025455661056 2017-07-18 01:47:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity Nobody cares. You're so irrelevant now that you have a republican president.  No viewers no ratings.
887488710287265795 2017-07-18 01:46:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC You are so pathetic.  When you can't accomplish your answer is failure. Wow what a role model.  That explains trump jr, and clan
887488159554183168 2017-07-18 01:44:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You just want to cry and complain and blame the democrats.  Your party has had 7 years and you all proved you have nothing better
887487784923037696 2017-07-18 01:42:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Stop taking lobby money from big insurers.  Obamacare is easy to fix you don't want to fix it.
887487350347005953 2017-07-18 01:40:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Maybe instead of letting things fail to get your way.  You should figure out cross state competition on health insurance.
887487173586558978 2017-07-18 01:40:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Go forbid you did what America wanted instead of just doing what you and congress want.
887486989242703872 2017-07-18 01:39:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump America no longer wants to repeal Obamacare. They saw the grass is not greener on the other side.
886770367334940673 2017-07-16 02:11:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChrisMurphyCT You didn't do one adjustment that saves Medicaid or Medicare.

886718639646416896 2017-07-16 22:46:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost I'm going to refrain from what I should say
886718532083384320 2017-07-16 22:45:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @AlvedaCKing @FoxNews Every women or teen who gets pregnant please carry to term and leave for mrs king. She will love and support them all.
886717450154332161 2017-07-16 22:41:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy And by the way the salaries they earn aren't going to triple.
886717248467062785 2017-07-16 22:40:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy I hope his base realizes the goods at Walmart triple in price at a minimum if everything is made here.
886617883605954560 2017-07-16 16:05:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @grandoftwo @bravenak @TeresaBerkowitz @Visitkarte I agree.

886427475605061633 2017-07-15 03:29:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @grandoftwo @bravenak @Visitkarte @TeresaBerkowitz He's actually too far to the left and he has no shot against trump.  Has anybody learned any lessons from the disaster that we have

884855815089389572 2017-07-11 19:24:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @Mike_P_Williams How ironic that trump jr was yelling lock her up while he should have been locked up
884846198179471360 2017-07-11 18:45:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Im not against them but your so afraid of foreigners why would you want the olympics here
884846044944748548 2017-07-11 18:45:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really you have nothing better to do? I guess you'll be easing up visa restrictions.   Big events like the olympics aren't a terror draw
884845375970041856 2017-07-11 18:42:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Could we get that lucky? Money has been buying them out of and into everything their entire life.
884825073256992768 2017-07-11 17:21:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy The usual day at the office. Deny deny deny . Blame Hillary and obama
884824924048809986 2017-07-11 17:21:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @peterdaou They all need to be ousted
884824644477472769 2017-07-11 17:20:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan @Coach_Ralph That's the problem. In real world prayer can't solve problems it takes actual action
884822488223449088 2017-07-11 17:11:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz Hey Donald why don't you have your grandchildren take a dip in this creek. Looks refreshing.
884822306006216704 2017-07-11 17:10:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz He's such a piece of crap and so is Scott Pruitt
884636670762643456 2017-07-10 04:53:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahKSilverman I can't find a person in this picture that can actually get pregnant
884633428783661058 2017-07-10 04:40:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN The puppet forgot what she was supposed to say? Could it be?
884633145567584256 2017-07-10 04:39:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN That's a first ? Are we sure this isn't fake news? 
884632933679718400 2017-07-10 04:38:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're missing the point. Ivanka was not elected. What exactly is her job since she stays out of politics?
884632509253865476 2017-07-10 04:36:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Don't you have North Korea, healthcare, stripping women of medical rights to get to today. Really with Chelsea?
884632111294156800 2017-07-10 04:35:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Like so illegal... gag me with a spoon!
884631672502747136 2017-07-10 04:33:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Well hopefully the 185,000 and counting trump state retail job losses will remember this in 3.5 years when they vote.
884629332408270848 2017-07-10 04:24:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy 6 months in and this is what is going on in this administration.  When you need this many lawyers.. it's going to be a long road.
884624315035123716 2017-07-10 04:04:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @BrandonTXNeely @BrianKarem Just bring the audio. Dare them ?
884623906505728001 2017-07-10 04:02:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PeterAlexander @BraddJaffy That's the famous trump family excuse.
884623182363316224 2017-07-10 03:59:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Any surprise he's a sarcastic narcissist. It's in the gene pool.
884616157021564928 2017-07-10 03:31:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity @BrandonTXNeely It's so disgusting he has totally disrespected the nypd on more than one occasion. He needs to go. He's so pathetic.
884614770036543488 2017-07-10 03:26:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity @BrandonTXNeely First time ever @Seanhannity we agree . Deblasio is an embarrassment
884245289024016384 2017-07-09 02:58:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewwalther @landosmiles I have a very painful rheumatoid condition and still won't touch them opioids.
884245060308672512 2017-07-09 02:57:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewwalther @EmpressNorton I'm saying there are certain cases where people have to use other techniques to get through short term pain without opioids
884244869526540289 2017-07-09 02:56:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewwalther @EmpressNorton They have use but they are so addictive. My dad has cancer so I understand
884243534630592513 2017-07-09 02:51:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I have to admit they were comfortable back in the day
884242896936992768 2017-07-09 02:48:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump When will you stop blaming obama. You're in charge he's on the beach somewhere
884242726778175489 2017-07-09 02:47:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump When your out of office we will
884242596603801600 2017-07-09 02:47:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @matthewwalther How about people suck it up. I had a c section and took Motrin at the hospital.  Not one opioid.
884241723190280193 2017-07-09 02:43:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews When will people learn
884241615971377152 2017-07-09 02:43:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NYDailyNews @BraddJaffy How does he get the hair to look like that. Elmers!
884239145383677956 2017-07-09 02:33:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Can we build an impenetrable place for you to disappear to and not be heard from again.
884238491223195652 2017-07-09 02:30:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump So then why bother discussing it at all.
884238057469333504 2017-07-09 02:29:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC No surprise as soon as he got back to the White House they scolded him.
884237782192988160 2017-07-09 02:28:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity You need to be evaluated for mental illness
884235010622074880 2017-07-09 02:17:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Yeah except the replacement is cruel and garbage. They had 7 years to come up with a plan. They produce that junk
884234011534602240 2017-07-09 02:13:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Is it amazing ? I hate to be insulting, he's not the sharpest tack in the pack.
884233414890721282 2017-07-09 02:10:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I read this it's barely an article. No details. Useless news
884229151695261697 2017-07-09 01:53:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Hey don't pick on the knicks they got enough problems
884228885541515264 2017-07-09 01:52:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Why are they dumbfounded. He's clearly exhibited his lack of intelligence for 2 years.
884228421194317825 2017-07-09 01:50:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @BrandonTXNeely Trump here is an employee for your commission on voter fraud.
884122585885224961 2017-07-09 18:50:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @maybellinecat @Amy_Siskind @4everNeverTrump Will the same Christian base that supports her father support her orthodox Jewish religion?
883879945356881920 2017-07-08 02:46:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Not anymore !
883520045325877249 2017-07-07 02:56:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Weren't they fake news not that long ago ? Now they are worthy of retweet
883502834687279104 2017-07-07 01:47:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump No one is talking about that. Stop with this nonsense.
883431625392103425 2017-07-07 21:04:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're the only one talking about this still
883171068588019712 2017-07-06 03:49:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Me too.
883163549308248069 2017-07-06 03:19:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @kimguilfoyle @FoxNews They have to be saying this shit because they are getting paid or they are the dumbest people, 8 years! 8 years!
883163102476464128 2017-07-06 03:17:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @kimguilfoyle @FoxNews So I guess you guys proved obamas points after 8 years!
883159574861295616 2017-07-06 03:03:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @VP @POTUS @RichardGrenell @FoxNews What might those be because I'm telling you he isn't using the military the repercussions are too severe.
883153509004214274 2017-07-06 02:39:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @APEastRegion Fascist, communist, impeach him now he's dangerous.
883149660159959040 2017-07-06 02:24:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Sometimes I have to ask who the hell makes this shit up
883148934092394496 2017-07-06 02:21:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Trump will want to expand it...He'll say he's building a big, huge, beautiful ....lots of terror being stopped
883145100670447616 2017-07-06 02:06:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laurenduca So they must thin the navy blue sleeveless Melanie had on coming off af1 today was inappropriate
883143933148229632 2017-07-06 02:01:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan His answer will be to build a trump hotel in Hamburg not staff his administration
883139870780207105 2017-07-06 01:45:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @jlodge28 Exactly he obviously does not like steak
883137996442267652 2017-07-06 01:38:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester You're welcome and thank you for taking your time to read it.  His statement made me so sick I had to share
883136260268797952 2017-07-06 01:31:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Once I saw the video I agree.
883133035775918085 2017-07-06 01:18:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @jbarro Here's a little medical lesson: black lung and cancer
883131471296385025 2017-07-06 01:12:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester 6/I don't think he CHOSE to be locked out/fired on June 30th and left with no insurance.
883131157675737089 2017-07-06 01:10:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester 5/ he'll be ok. That's impossible to find a new job with health benefits and a wait period of less than 63 days.
883130967195611139 2017-07-06 01:10:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester 4/most new jobs have a 90 day wait period for health coverage.   If he gets a job right away and it provides coverage with no wait period
883130722319466498 2017-07-06 01:09:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester 3/he has 63 days to get insurance or it's a lapse and his sons pre-existing condition will make insurance untouchable
883130396766089217 2017-07-06 01:07:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester 2/the shop steward has a Down syndrome child with ciliacs. They can't afford cobra with him having no job. Under the senate plan
883130027101097984 2017-07-06 01:06:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JohnCornyn @chobiester Oh yeah choose: WALDNERS in ny fired all the union employees and is using subs. The cobra will be well over a thousand dollars
882995045124767744 2017-07-06 16:09:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski Who is she exactly?
882994319069761536 2017-07-06 16:07:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews What is he doing about it now ????
882994070389436416 2017-07-06 16:06:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN @POTUS @dixiechicks @votevets @AynRandPaulRyan Do we have enough time ?
882993919855874048 2017-07-06 16:05:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Neubadah @AynRandPaulRyan Maybe we should just led the confederates secede from the union and they can set up a county called #maga with trump.
882993458914492417 2017-07-06 16:03:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Neubadah @AynRandPaulRyan It's embarrassing that a confederate flag is waving. Shame on trump.
882993241427259393 2017-07-06 16:02:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews To think I used to say he was the worst president ever. What was I thinking. Trump clearly holds the title.
882992654463709185 2017-07-06 16:00:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes I face this every day in my career
882992218491019266 2017-07-06 15:58:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC A TRUE PATRIOT AND LEADER WOULD NEVER DISPARAGE A PREDECESSOR OR AGENCY ON FOREIGN SOIL PUBLICLY EVER.
882989515396321281 2017-07-06 15:48:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN We better get air force one there because he won't believe it unless he sees it.
882989090945343488 2017-07-06 15:46:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NBCNews Then have your husband resign
882988540237410307 2017-07-06 15:44:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely In like 2 days we'll post the constitution and see if they recognize it.
882987227336384519 2017-07-06 15:38:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy They need to get him history for dummies
882987227281838081 2017-07-06 15:38:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews I have not heard one person in America cry out for god.  We have religious freedom stop letting the Christian Right control you
882987227084619776 2017-07-06 15:38:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Disgrace.   Can we #LOCKHIMUP
882987226640076801 2017-07-06 15:38:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy He has no other vocabulary and he doesn't know history
882950483513573377 2017-07-06 13:12:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Please say this quote is a joke. He gives new meaning to narcissist and liar.  It's going to be an angry day I see
882949858549780480 2017-07-06 13:10:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Then pay someone to read it to him
882949845656514561 2017-07-06 13:10:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews So why have you sold us out to corporate America and your rich friends.  Liar.
882785072629395457 2017-07-05 02:15:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix I wouldn't use this crap as cat towels at the rescue.
882784384679649280 2017-07-05 02:12:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix They can keep it. It's ugly. Sorry. All of it.
882784072409501696 2017-07-05 02:11:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @Christie_D22 I actually agree.  I'll go one further. If he's the 2020 nominee we will have another 4 of trump. I have no followers to lose!
882782899367497728 2017-07-05 02:06:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Don't think Russia will just let us do what we want they border them also. This is very complicated. Have fun trump.
882782750910164993 2017-07-05 02:06:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes China can't send troops in to North Korea and they can have us attaching that close to the border.  It's a huge problem.
882782528721104896 2017-07-05 02:05:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes No matter how bad let's say for example Canada behaves .. we would not allow another country to bomb them and send troops that wasn't us.
882781625892950016 2017-07-05 02:01:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @guardiannews Because they can't face the people they are robbing and killing
882781189060382721 2017-07-05 02:00:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Are the likes because he's out of town!
882780988618801152 2017-07-05 01:59:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @peterdaou I was thinking this yesterday when I read an article about it . Well said
882780787304804353 2017-07-05 01:58:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes @gra_design Actually I question if the laws really pass the 2nd amendment sniff test.Try getting a carry permit in NYC..You got a better shot at lotto
882780397528129537 2017-07-05 01:57:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes @gra_design Prohibition didn't work with alcohol and it's not the answer on guns. Nyc has some of the most restrictive laws already.
882777506818011137 2017-07-05 01:45:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JesseBWatters @FoxNews Just stick to being the racist bigot you usually are.  This is just nonsense. So glad you're behind a desk at #lyingfoxnews.
882775119436926978 2017-07-05 01:36:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ACLUofGA @chrislhayes @ACLU What's with the 3 different ballots. That should not be allowed. It should be one ballot all party candidates. No privacy.
882773441887305733 2017-07-05 01:29:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Anytime you fly to Hawaii use Hawaiian airlines they have it figured out.

882415297562640384 2017-07-04 01:46:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes I'm willing to pay more tax for good healthcare and education for all Americans.  Those Americans just insult me. I'm left wondering why?
882413914499239939 2017-07-04 01:40:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes The country will work better if it works together.  People have lost all sight of this.
882413763244195840 2017-07-04 01:40:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes I don't support the policies that he wants that would benefit me because they hurt too many others.
882413332690608130 2017-07-04 01:38:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Not one working class person should be supporting trump. Ironically I would only benefit from trumps policies and I don't support. Go figure
882412959238168576 2017-07-04 01:36:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes I have no idea. I scream everyday on this twitter about it.  Only to get insults from those same people hurled at me.

882307248835502080 2017-07-04 18:36:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely It's funny how you don't realize what you lost until its gone and the replacement doesn't work as good.
882307051548020737 2017-07-04 18:36:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Ditto
882078544280645633 2017-07-03 03:28:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump We have troops and a base there in case you were too busy on twitter.
882078346993127424 2017-07-03 03:27:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Really. Qatar is a disaster now.
882077214178779137 2017-07-03 03:22:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME That's what we all say about you !!!!!
882076948817727488 2017-07-03 03:21:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I feel bad for them quite frankly. To be so intolerant and hateful takes away a persons humanity.
882073854671192069 2017-07-03 03:09:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @APCentralRegion @newschoolhoops Cough on all the food so the customers leave. You'll get sick days
882073730083684352 2017-07-03 03:09:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @APCentralRegion @newschoolhoops When a worker vomits in his bosses desk a few times.  They'll start to accept sick days
882072404272566273 2017-07-03 03:03:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @APCentralRegion @newschoolhoops They were fired for exposing the truth.  The company can fire who it wants. My answer is the same.  Come to work and cough all over.
882068994429116416 2017-07-03 02:50:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews @janw1229 I'll help you. Apparently although not clear from the reply. One trump supporter knows the word petulant. I stand corrected.
882068066011676672 2017-07-03 02:46:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews @janw1229 Reply in English please.
882067813174837253 2017-07-03 02:45:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @APCentralRegion So now the new workers should when sick come in and  diarrhea, vomit and snot and cough right in and on the CEO and all other bosses.
882066752645074944 2017-07-03 02:41:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business Not with trump at the helm
882059030121893890 2017-07-03 02:10:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews They do everyday you and your corrupt president refuse to hear and accept the truth
882058764110704640 2017-07-03 02:09:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews I'm sorry trump doesn't know the word petulant.  So way his base does.
882058280511602689 2017-07-03 02:07:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews She can correct the problem and start telling the truth
882056805500760064 2017-07-03 02:01:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @JesseBWatters @FoxNews How about you abs trump go study climate change in Antarctica for the next few years.
882056439430348801 2017-07-03 02:00:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN Not according to tucker Carlson, trump and the republicans
882055560065146881 2017-07-03 01:56:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Honda What's most disturbing about that video is the age of the kid with a binky
882054099235209216 2017-07-03 01:50:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Yeah it is. Most of them can't read
882052797654597634 2017-07-03 01:45:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews He mind as well say we don't need projects we'll just purge the poor with no housing and no insurance. When it's time get him first
882050820543574016 2017-07-03 01:37:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes That man has been hit with an ugly stick
882049692019945472 2017-07-03 01:33:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost The Federal govts lobbying practices are why drugs are so expensive. Big pharma owns Washington.  Why does America not understand ?
882047520465145857 2017-07-03 01:24:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Not now that the trumps are in town
882047273395507200 2017-07-03 01:23:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews It's wrong to put you transgender onto a newborn just because you didn't identify and switched.  Start as is and let nature take its course
882046992112902145 2017-07-03 01:22:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews This is wrong. Just because the mother is transgender doesn't mean it's ok to do this. I've supported transgender the whole way. Not this.
882046372056354816 2017-07-03 01:20:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Corruption at its finest!
882045567525949440 2017-07-03 01:17:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarackObama @petehoekstra @FoxNews No one cares about these 3
882044432735973376 2017-07-03 01:12:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix Just because you where a bikini top 3 sizes too small doesn't make them big
882044295628410880 2017-07-03 01:12:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix Really with this whining. Those boobs aren't even big. Mine blow those away. Those are mosquito bites.
882044130314072065 2017-07-03 01:11:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix You being naked all the time is hindering your acting career. Nothing's changed Hollywood isn't hiring the girl who's always naked as a lead
882041290615123968 2017-07-03 01:00:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @pewresearch @TheEconomist I'm sorry they are radical and not a reflection of main stream America .
882040078050234370 2017-07-03 00:55:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy @Jmalewitz They don't need to look at data. They'll just issue an alt fact like they always do
882038913782751236 2017-07-03 00:50:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz So his friends can drill for oil, run pipelines, and frack for natural gas. He's such garbage.
882038506322841601 2017-07-03 00:49:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz How could any American support ruining our rivers for money and greed
882038358515605504 2017-07-03 00:48:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz Not long unfortunately
882037980910759937 2017-07-03 00:46:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz @ViewFromWise Trump is soooo corrupt
882037656586027008 2017-07-03 00:45:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz @ViewFromWise Wake up America. Big oil, insurance, banking, big pharma , they already owned America now they have the king at the helm.
882037186689994752 2017-07-03 00:43:47 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz I guess the EPA figures it's ok to pollute them since they are vanishing anyway.
882036621427834880 2017-07-03 00:41:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GaryRayBetz I'm so worried also.
882036143809847296 2017-07-03 00:39:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost That's obvious.
882035447135965184 2017-07-03 00:36:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Thank god for the judiciary
882035078154596356 2017-07-03 00:35:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KatTimpf @FoxNews What a bunch of cowards when they can't agree. They just screw over the American people to save face.
882034942464708612 2017-07-03 00:34:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KatTimpf @FoxNews That's the most cruel thing I've ever heard.  I would vote my senator out just for letting the vote happen.
882034777188159488 2017-07-03 00:34:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KatTimpf @FoxNews What about the lapse and now congress would create a pre existing condition issue.
882034662117449729 2017-07-03 00:33:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KatTimpf @FoxNews The senate would be responsible for 35 million people losing insurance at least.  Corporations will drop that required coverage
881984767293612032 2017-07-03 21:15:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Phrases for your presidency:  vile, corrupt, liar, fake, hypocrite, look them up if you don't have ivanka there to define for you.
881984368759255040 2017-07-03 21:13:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Do you ever say anything without commenting on fake news. You're the worst president this country has ever had.
881984170418941952 2017-07-03 21:13:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump They are waiting to report the massive correction from the inflated over valuation.   Only your rich cronies are led by the stock market
881982295309262848 2017-07-03 21:05:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you answer this? If they put a bill on your desk giving you absolute power would you sign it ?
881980837100744704 2017-07-03 20:59:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump What numbers on jobs. These jobs were already planned before you.  How many black lung jobs did you create? You tell lies
881980397764173827 2017-07-03 20:58:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Don't you have Medicaid and insurance to take away from Americans. Stop thanking your cronies.
881980159036973056 2017-07-03 20:57:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump With all your followers you'd think you'd get more likes. More retweets.  That's right those are fake
881979889099964416 2017-07-03 20:56:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Yeah the fake news
881979644433633280 2017-07-03 20:55:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Hey mr trump did you know the % of people wanting you FIRED(impeached) is now greater than your approval rating. Way to go. Happy 4th
881978923973840898 2017-07-03 20:52:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AndyRichter That's exactly how the GOP rolls

881972292577787904 2017-07-03 20:25:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GovChristie @FoxNews And how much did the helicopter ride cost the state?
881933189249413120 2017-07-03 17:50:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy That says it all
881931372063010817 2017-07-03 17:43:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes We give our small percentage of wealthy people too much control of the country that's why we aren't better off as a rich nation
881931100251185152 2017-07-03 17:42:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Completely not what I meant
881917740218535938 2017-07-03 16:49:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @jerryjamesstone Only 70 percent.
881916958928711681 2017-07-03 16:46:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Can we get this up to 95?
881913458136145920 2017-07-03 16:32:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StopTheSpeaker @Visitkarte I must have been in a good mood yesterday .  You're right
881913152526581762 2017-07-03 16:30:55 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I'm challenging the GOP candidate to an IQ test.  Will he accept
881913014110363648 2017-07-03 16:30:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Pathetic
881879324776951808 2017-07-03 14:16:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @OhNoSheTwitnt I've never felt so unsafe from govt
881879187908374528 2017-07-03 14:15:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @OhNoSheTwitnt I don't trust him.  He's dangerous. Let me tell you buying guns in ny is no easy task.
881878282131603456 2017-07-03 14:12:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You live in a world where you think the above is true.  It's called neverland
881878031941369856 2017-07-03 14:11:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Oh they still speak to you.
881877666567254016 2017-07-03 14:09:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy On the states dime
881877296239583233 2017-07-03 14:08:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Let's face it. He can't run trump org from the White House
881876594100457473 2017-07-03 14:05:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @OhNoSheTwitnt No and if he was offered a bill to sign to make himself a dictator he would. I'm buying guns and getting ready.
881875511374491648 2017-07-03 14:01:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews Isis is not on the run from us.  Of course rich stock market people love him.
881875322626592768 2017-07-03 14:00:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @FoxNews What jobs ? What jobs that weren't already planned by the companies before? Do they provide healthcare? Are they above minimum wage?
881873362569629696 2017-07-03 13:52:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @robreiner @amjoyshow He would like nothing more than to be a dictator. He would sign that bill in a second if it hit his desk.
881872651404414976 2017-07-03 13:49:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Because a very small percentage of the population has all the wealth
881872283333271552 2017-07-03 13:48:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @StopTheSpeaker Paul Ryan is not an independent thinker at all he only knows how to toe the party line.
881705920551690240 2017-07-02 02:47:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Ditto
881701520005312512 2017-07-02 02:29:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Of course this White House doesn't believe in science. Hence Pruitt
881701395392602112 2017-07-02 02:29:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheEconomist Especially his.
881701102856613888 2017-07-02 02:28:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxBusiness @FoxNews While the media is busy with his nonsense.   Congress is jamming shitty legislation through.  He's not wrong. Eyes open media we need it
881700511199756290 2017-07-02 02:25:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy Done forget ... it's huge and great.
881698686333530114 2017-07-02 02:18:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity I can't think of one time I've 100 percent supported all ideas from the party I support.
881698340202795011 2017-07-02 02:17:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity I'm sorry an intellectual person never agrees 100 percent on anything.  He's like a programmed robot or brainwashed.
881698079161888770 2017-07-02 02:16:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @seanhannity I am seriously questioning the mental stability of Sean hannity.  How can you have such blind support. It's impossible unless you're a tool
881697664588500992 2017-07-02 02:14:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei I'm surprised their was this many.
881697259863371778 2017-07-02 02:13:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Of course because they are busy digging up dirt and blackmailing congress
881696835802472448 2017-07-02 02:11:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Of course because their economic model is a failure
881695680485576704 2017-07-02 02:06:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost He put them in the destroy the agencies not run them.
881694924164538368 2017-07-02 02:03:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR I'm going to go with this. If you can't say something nice don't say it at all
881694091083472900 2017-07-02 02:00:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC After they pass this piece of crap and it fails. They will no longer be able to blame obama. Who will they blame  I wonder
881693547501584385 2017-07-02 01:58:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost He can't be an ally for something he doesn't understand

881691127707045889 2017-07-02 01:48:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @IBTimes @BraddJaffy No surprise he's just letting corporate America destroy this country
881690826358870016 2017-07-02 01:47:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy He has his fat ass brought in by helicopter.  I get satisfaction that trump screwed him and made him the loser governor he is
881561404825894913 2017-07-02 17:13:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews True !
881560897386414083 2017-07-02 17:11:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews @betty_dekanchuk Love the 1st amendment!

881557151541547008 2017-07-02 16:56:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I imagine him with a bullet hole in his forehead and it makes me smile

881556504234643456 2017-07-02 16:53:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews The American people tried to stop you but the rigged electoral college had other ideas
881556088189071363 2017-07-02 16:52:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @AynRandPaulRyan @XDaneelOlivaw there are people in this country that use religion in a radicalized way to hide behind it as an excuse to hurt and be hateful.  She's one.
881555677398921218 2017-07-02 16:50:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @AynRandPaulRyan @XDaneelOlivaw I'm a woman but it's simple she considers his agenda "gods agenda" she's a crazy Christian zealot.
881555243263307776 2017-07-02 16:48:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JCTheResistance @funder @AynRandPaulRyan I have a better shot of winning the nys lottery without buying a ticket then we do of getting rid of him
881554897308700673 2017-07-02 16:47:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SarahHuckabee @AynRandPaulRyan She'll have another excuse as to why that's not promoting violence
881554674595360769 2017-07-02 16:46:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Just another example of his total lack of intelligence
881554425327833088 2017-07-02 16:45:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @KellyannePolls @BrandonTXNeely @votevets The crypt keeper.
881553626094862337 2017-07-02 16:42:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost I like kasich but that's just fluff for your party is too radical and not willing to compromise.
881552324757422080 2017-07-02 16:37:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laurenduca But maybe it's a yes because grandchildren are not a close family relationship as defined by his administration
881552155500584961 2017-07-02 16:36:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @laurenduca Ask trump if we let his grandchildren near Amy if these foods or swim in American lakes and rivers. I assume you the answer is no

881543776036061185 2017-07-02 16:03:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You're so pathetic. #MAGA will only happen when you and your disgusting family leave Washington. Then we'll be great again. Term limits rock
881531774219816961 2017-07-02 15:15:27 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy We'd be better off with no EPA than with him at the helm
881345311763038208 2017-07-01 02:54:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Because all these small things are what dictators do
881344813991383043 2017-07-01 02:52:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely You're so lucky !
881344424390918144 2017-07-01 02:51:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @JoyAnnReid Washington has finally solidified what we all knew. They are bought and paid for.  They have there chance to be better but won't

881338528541618176 2017-07-01 02:27:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Try getting them the help they need early on in life. An education, healthcare, good jobs. Not cheap no skill jobs like the president pushes
881338026726739968 2017-07-01 02:25:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME The next president had to deal with the gaudy good thing at the White House too
881337720559284224 2017-07-01 02:24:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @morningmika @FLOTUS @FoxNews He attacks private citizens on twitter all day long You're like the scarecrow without a brain with these comments. Are you really this aloof
881337144857546753 2017-07-01 02:22:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews He has to keep his rhetoric for the fanatical Christian base or he has no supporters
881336826887364608 2017-07-01 02:20:48 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TheEconomist Most of these people are his constituents the rest of his fans are the 1 percent
881336387638898688 2017-07-01 02:19:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski It was making me crazy as I read the excerpts.  Refund the tuition money. He's just not smart at all
881335620492283904 2017-07-01 02:16:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Watch out twitter he'll be back at twitter soon
881335087748571136 2017-07-01 02:13:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews That means you denounce other religions who say otherwise.
881334851013681153 2017-07-01 02:12:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews It's called free speech but you violate that amendment all the time by blocking people
881334619232186368 2017-07-01 02:12:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Really is this speech honoring the veterans or pushing his agenda. Narcissism at its maximum overload
881334343431598085 2017-07-01 02:10:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Again with the religion
881334199189467136 2017-07-01 02:10:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews I'm sorry but what's with all the god stuff
881333913947447296 2017-07-01 02:09:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP_Politics Thankfully one day this law will return to the way it was before. I'll wait patiently

881332617639067652 2017-07-01 02:04:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews So inappropriate at a veterans speech.
881332488450306055 2017-07-01 02:03:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews You are trying on a daily basis
881332366437908480 2017-07-01 02:03:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews You sure havent
881331875956092928 2017-07-01 02:01:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Just another way to take the country back to the dark ages.  Republicans are making me think they are dumb ?
881331347624792064 2017-07-01 01:59:02 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @JesseBWatters @FoxNews The only fake news is Fox News
881330876742852609 2017-07-01 01:57:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Wouldn't it be great if he started his weekend in the South Pole where he could learn about science and global warming.
881330414647902208 2017-07-01 01:55:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews God his vocabulary is so limited.  This is an Ivy League graduate.  They should give his dad his money back

881328761144315904 2017-07-01 01:48:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews I'm surprised anybody even listens to him. He's the only politician with a lower approval than trump
881328504704561153 2017-07-01 01:47:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP_Politics Why doesn't he claim Fox News is biased towards him.
881328282976833537 2017-07-01 01:46:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @Morning_Joe @GovMikeHuckabee @FoxNews And you and your daughter are the infectious  toxin in the bite that makes people itch.
881327858609729537 2017-07-01 01:45:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC Of course that moron at the White House tweeted that because he doesn't give a shit about America only his pathetic agenda.
881326374430134274 2017-07-01 01:39:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski So true but I'm thankful this means his hateful agenda just keeps waiting and waiting
881325768781025281 2017-07-01 01:36:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump A modern day president would believe in science, and equality and all people. You're just a rich unqualified disgrace.
881325095955910656 2017-07-01 01:34:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Seadog14Garren Real dumb we have lots of guns
881324935406395396 2017-07-01 01:33:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MarshaBlackburn @FoxNews Because the White House and republicans killed it on purpose.
881305985192734720 2017-07-01 00:18:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @BrandonTXNeely @TrumpBlockParty He hates his home town because we basically gave him an eviction order at the polls on election night
881305357502619648 2017-07-01 00:15:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost @AndyBCampbell They apparently forgot the confederacy died 150 years ago
881305162278739969 2017-07-01 00:14:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you change your name to #lyingcheatingnarcissist

881220732033925121 2017-07-01 18:39:29 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Because he's used to paying people to kiss his ass.
881220519021989889 2017-07-01 18:38:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @funder And Donald you wouldn't have your job if ...should I say it ...it's mean..I'll let you all fill it in
881220065680662531 2017-07-01 18:36:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy We're safer with him at the golf course than in the White House believe me. Let me keep playing
881219895178002433 2017-07-01 18:36:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews People right to privacy .  I used to just say trump is intolerable. I genuinely detest him

881217325285945344 2017-07-01 18:25:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy I wish he would jump in the Gulf of Mexico now that would be something to tweet.
881216451889295361 2017-07-01 18:22:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @BrandonTXNeely He's never made a sacrifice he's had everything handed to her
881215908307447809 2017-07-01 18:20:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Trumps got money for election commission but no money for healthcare
881214282326827009 2017-07-01 18:13:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Every quote that comes out of his mouth is just so ridiculous.   Seriously can a dr. Please tell me what is wrong with this man
881040902398988288 2017-06-30 06:44:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump That's nice leave tens of millions without insurance immediately. Let sick people get dropped, just give your friends the tax cut. Insane.

881033930517999616 2017-06-30 06:17:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN The trump bill will finish them off
881032336128847872 2017-06-30 06:10:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @co_rapunzel4 One day we'll get our dignity back I swear!
881030543558750208 2017-06-30 06:03:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @funder I can't stand him but mike pence is respected and has friends in Washington he will get an even worse agenda passed.
881029773375483904 2017-06-30 06:00:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Also the best way to get even is to vote and get others for your cause to vote.  Help people get registered and please vote
881027215663796224 2017-06-30 05:50:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS I can't listen I'm sorry not even for twitter
880997325027594240 2017-06-30 03:51:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely It's not that ambiguous the Supreme Court ruling this a stretch by Texas judges.. they are trying to get a redo in front of HON GORSUCH

880994089902145537 2017-06-30 03:38:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely Hm! Didn't the Supreme Court already address this ?
880993716001013761 2017-06-30 03:37:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely As much as I hate him. Mike pence is bad and actually has respect and real friends in Washington. He'll get this bad agenda passed.
880992380257804290 2017-06-30 03:32:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan This is how all dictatorships are started. Many states are already saying no but people should call local reps scream NONONO.
880990306497331201 2017-06-30 03:23:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely It's true and they are never actually readable English
880988374445830144 2017-06-30 03:16:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Hillary I can't speak for the other 48 but ny and Cali already knew he was garbage
880986565027270659 2017-06-30 03:08:59 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @AynRandPaulRyan After I saw his list of lies, I'll go with joe, Mika, shit I'll go with Pinocchio
880983307520966656 2017-06-30 02:56:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes We must figure this out without hurting witches but crippling true small businesses.
880983206111174656 2017-06-30 02:55:38 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Too much.

880979165549387776 2017-06-30 02:39:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Yeah well the founding fathers had real jobs and it was part time. The greed of today's paid for politicians caused this.
880978903854194693 2017-06-30 02:38:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @JaySekulow @FoxNews If I were you I would shut up. Your guy is waste deep in sewage.
880978643975106560 2017-06-30 02:37:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marklevinshow @FoxNews What's so radical about not giving rich people tax cuts and caring for the poor sick and elderly.
880978430472400896 2017-06-30 02:36:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @marklevinshow @FoxNews This is exactly what's wrong with this country.
880974156141080576 2017-06-30 02:19:41 UTC <Brizzicpa> @OutnumberedFNC @morningmika @MeghanMcCain @FoxNews Always trying to deflect from the truth and make excuses for trump
880802118894059520 2017-06-30 14:56:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Remember who pays most of the federal taxes in this country mr trump
880801989541732352 2017-06-30 14:55:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes Hey sanctuary cities let's cut funding to Washington.

880799515015622656 2017-06-30 14:45:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix You're the only one with the nerve to say it. How old is Barron that's the last time
880799298375561219 2017-06-30 14:44:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @deray You better lock up all of Washington .. the NRA owns them.  The govt just said it's ok for mentally disabled people to have weapons
880798822594748417 2017-06-30 14:42:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @GaryRayBetz It is a slow death. If the govt can shorten everyone's lives by a few years with cancers they save billions in ss, mc, and Medicaid
880798363523981312 2017-06-30 14:41:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @Angelize424 Not even a magician can make that happen. Trump is too toxic

880612292005593088 2017-06-29 02:21:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Apparently trump doesn't consider his grand children close family

880607401841393670 2017-06-29 02:02:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes He called up his friends
880606968787992582 2017-06-29 02:00:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @chrislhayes And Melanie knows for a fact one of those claims is true

880604290364080128 2017-06-29 01:49:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews We tried by voting for the other lady but we got beat by the rigged electoral college.
880603469626961922 2017-06-29 01:46:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @drewginsburg @DenWill60 Us liberals in nyc have decided we are moving into every conservative county to turn your state democratic. We'll leave your guns alone !
880602564680613892 2017-06-29 01:43:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FLOTUS @BrandonTXNeely She never had any to begin with. She was divorcing him before he ran. That marriage is a sham
880602153978667008 2017-06-29 01:41:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I don't need a study. As an cpa I will have to admit. The living wage think doesn't work. We offset that by reducing employees
880601578079760384 2017-06-29 01:39:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Just vile. It's runs in that family from her disgusting father to dog murdering brother.
880601248596144132 2017-06-29 01:37:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump In order to do that you would have to permanently leave the country
880601113858379777 2017-06-29 01:37:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GOPChairwoman @FoxNews The GOP chairwoman is a disgrace and a useless tool
880599767620956160 2017-06-29 01:32:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews I mean stranger as non president
880599608480673792 2017-06-29 01:31:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews She's full of shit. She wouldn't let her kids near him if he was some stranger
880598593941458945 2017-06-29 01:27:20 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MajorCBS @CBSNews That's because nobody has the nerve from his own party to anything about it.  He's so disgusting. I'm never referring to him as president
880505048110944257 2017-06-29 19:15:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump Correct sock to sick ... he can't read anyway

880490571823009793 2017-06-29 18:18:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @byamberphillips @washingtonpost How does Melanie get into bed with this disgusting man. Shame on her. I don't care how rich he is
880236820658876417 2017-06-28 01:29:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Yeah because some employers were mandated now they won't be
880234801256693762 2017-06-28 01:21:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You truly are dillusional
880232399690493957 2017-06-28 01:12:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Yes because big oil owns Washington especially the Republican Party but the dems  also. How much wildlife is dead since you took office?
880115625233981442 2017-06-28 17:28:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP Finally !!!
880115259318697986 2017-06-28 17:26:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Wow that's a real intellectual thought ... not
880115086949527552 2017-06-28 17:26:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy What's he going to say he hasn't read the bill and he has only 4 words in his vocabulary
880112727590674436 2017-06-28 17:16:40 UTC <Brizzicpa> @nytimes That country is being run by a psycho
879924211061489664 2017-06-27 04:47:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump you are the biggest joke of a president.  It's beyond embarrassing at this point. Please go golf for the next 4 years.https://twitter.com/brizzicpa/status/879913518463684613
879922065368903680 2017-06-27 04:39:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Why should they be any different than the people in his own country. Same here. No confidence.
879921017958879232 2017-06-27 04:34:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SkyNews Keep the trump boys far away
879920748596518912 2017-06-27 04:33:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Like he has any say. It won't pass as is.
879918804641382400 2017-06-27 04:26:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNN Of course. Cosby obviously has dementia if he thought that was a good idea.
879917100663529477 2017-06-27 04:19:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews John Kasich is who the republicans should have chosen as a candidate.
879916582440378368 2017-06-27 04:17:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I thought he was dead
879916080369741824 2017-06-27 04:15:16 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business I hope it's on twitter or he won't see or read it
879914850562002945 2017-06-27 04:10:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You can't let ins. companies cap coverage, deny or charge too much for preexisting conditions. One day someone close to you may get one.
879913913319653376 2017-06-27 04:06:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I'll have to check the article out its hard to defame her it must be bad
879913518463684613 2017-06-27 04:05:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC No surprise.
879912545632518144 2017-06-27 04:01:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You invited 0 dems to your wh meeting. Troll.
879912309363273728 2017-06-27 04:00:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews He constantly complains about no dems support. Did he invite any dems? No not one.
879911883607871489 2017-06-27 03:58:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BraddJaffy We know he doesn't read anything he signs or releases.
879911487992721409 2017-06-27 03:57:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski Because nobody donates more to govt than insurance. The lobby is one of the biggest.  These are his cronies.
879910940883517440 2017-06-27 03:54:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes No
879910827117215744 2017-06-27 03:54:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski Runs in her family
879910481263251458 2017-06-27 03:53:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I didn't think it was possible for a person to survive without a brain.
879909367931338752 2017-06-27 03:48:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes Of course not. He is busy blocking people on twitter not reading what he is going to eventually sign. Dangerous!
879908861821554692 2017-06-27 03:46:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarackObama @FoxNews Wow they are totally charge after 8 years but they only talk about the election. Who is the fake news?
879908543415164932 2017-06-27 03:45:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Your bill is on delay because it sucks and is mean and kills people. Especially the old and poor and disabled. Not because of dems
879908305359052800 2017-06-27 03:44:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Now own the problem
879908264821084160 2017-06-27 03:44:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You and your Republican Party had to have it all or nothing.  No compromise take no prisoner
879908099225780224 2017-06-27 03:43:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump If you wanted democrats to help your legislature should have asked. They wanted to make some changes you wanted all or nothing.
879907344238432258 2017-06-27 03:40:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenSchumer @BraddJaffy Mitch I can write you an awesome bill.  Reach out.
879904940830969856 2017-06-27 03:31:00 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AP 5 industries already owned the USA .The voters just gave them the golden ticket when they got trump in the drivers seat. Wake up people.
879902073042718720 2017-06-27 03:19:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews This stuff is all about ratings.
879901247993774081 2017-06-27 03:16:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BarackObama @POTUS @FoxNews Shouldn't he be promoting his killer healthcare bill?
879899767010209792 2017-06-27 03:10:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateMajLdr @FoxNews The alternative is just an outright killer.
879897472981716993 2017-06-27 03:01:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business Look at this and ask why you have no affordable healthcare
879897395483561985 2017-06-27 03:01:01 UTC <Brizzicpa> @business Trickle down failed under Reagan and will fail under trump.  Insurance and pharmacy already own the USA so give them more money.
879895675865108480 2017-06-27 02:54:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei There are what 535 lawmakers so you do the math. That's over 1 mil taxpayer funds. The founding fathers are turning in the grave
879532145773092864 2017-06-26 02:49:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump Same old boring whining tweet from you do you have any original thoughts
879531792977596416 2017-06-26 02:48:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton People should not be punished for having a pre existing condition
879531703903170564 2017-06-26 02:47:53 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton They don't count. They collected with no pay outs for all those years and now somebody is sick that's the point of insurance for the in case
879531526647668736 2017-06-26 02:47:11 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton Healthy for 40 years barely a dr visit and one day wakes up with an immune condition. What about the past 40 years of premiums paid ?
879531277040447488 2017-06-26 02:46:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton You can go to sleep on Monday healthy abs wake up on Tuesday with a condition.  Now you have a pre existing. This happened to my  family
879531025658982400 2017-06-26 02:45:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ChelseaClinton He needs to just get out of congress.  I'm sorry I can't believe after he said that one person in WI would ever vote for him.
879416907702689795 2017-06-26 19:11:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump A true leader doesn't need an apology they are honest and strong enough to know they have unwavering integrity impeachable by none.
879192036288729088 2017-06-25 04:18:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Kellyanne do you live in the same country as the rest of us?
879181030716043264 2017-06-25 03:34:26 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC You get my point. I'm mad I want to fire all 535 of you.
879180410659495936 2017-06-25 03:31:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC At least my tirade has less typos!
879179485924470784 2017-06-25 03:28:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Mad New York voter schumer you she read my long winded tirade about you and McConnell.

879172801952972801 2017-06-25 03:01:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ After that let's see what the president does.  No matter what party you are I say FIRE EACH AND EBERY ONE. They are all a failure
879172384166526976 2017-06-25 03:00:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ President most of the stuff going on in congress lies on the backs of 535 people well America we are 300 million strong.  FIRE THEM ALL
879171950500773888 2017-06-25 02:58:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Let's start from scratch and see what happens.   Let's give the American people 535 new members of govt. as critical as I've been of the
879171681914425345 2017-06-25 02:57:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ I say all 535 of you should be fired. We should really drain the swamp.
879171546039898113 2017-06-25 02:56:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ American lives at stake. Shame on all of you. We spent the last 6 years doing nothing but stonewalling. Now we do it again.
879171230263369728 2017-06-25 02:55:30 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Both sides to talk. All the years of behind the scenes deals and now nothing on anything?  Not one important issue with 300 million
879170432246697984 2017-06-25 02:52:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ The entire congress needs to go here's why: 1. Washington is all about deals. 2. Schumer and McConnell both senior members can't get
879163704461414401 2017-06-25 02:25:35 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CNBC @firstsonofmogh Will those jobs they get provide them with insurance? The employer will not be required to provide it? If they make 300 a week can they pay?
879151004989759488 2017-06-25 01:35:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BethStern So amazing.  I got to have this experience on a rescue I did last year. It's so special.

879111385908686848 2017-06-25 22:57:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews @jonbarclay78 The taxes that are being repealed in Obamacare are on people like me. We can and should pay more.  On earnings over 300k and dividends .

879103185432055808 2017-06-25 22:25:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews @jonbarclay78 That explains my desire to pay more taxes so I can help Americans less unfortunate than me. Thanks for clearing that up

879092441906896897 2017-06-25 21:42:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews One big happy family of rich liars all in one place while congress robs the poor, sick and elderly of health care. MAGA
879091735749689344 2017-06-25 21:39:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ Another shot at small business.
879091064849780737 2017-06-25 21:36:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews @jonbarclay78 I was going to reply more to this but I realized I can't stop laughing
879090061307936770 2017-06-25 21:32:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews @jonbarclay78 There's no greater fake news than fox itself.
879083429199056897 2017-06-25 21:06:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @dbongino @ffweekend @FoxNews Fox News spent 8 yrs slamming dems and now they cry fowl after only 5 mos of criticism.  Put on your big boy pants because it's only began
879081609953193985 2017-06-25 20:59:23 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan @SPEAKcipher I can't offer you anything but my willingness to share my good fortune by paying a few more taxes to help fund Medicaid.
879080937283256324 2017-06-25 20:56:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME She'll try to tell you it makes it the States problem. Still a federal funding cut period. She can't really be this dumb can she ?
879078575063920640 2017-06-25 20:47:19 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei Once his presidency is over and we all see his failures. I'm sure he'll still be blaming his predecessor.
879077449362964480 2017-06-25 20:42:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei Oh George I'm so tired !
879077254311145473 2017-06-25 20:42:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TomPerez @EricTrump @FoxNews Wow. The pot calling the kettle black
879064805679693825 2017-06-25 19:52:36 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Don't worry the tax cuts from the new healthcare bill you'll get will reimburse you for the cost of this lavish event
879060669253005312 2017-06-25 19:36:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Today he's busy blocking those who disagree and criticize him and lying to the American public on Fox News
879060175361110017 2017-06-25 19:34:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LaraLeaTrump @FoxNews @DavidAmstutz3 This reply speaks volumes about the intelligence of many Americans.
879058649506820096 2017-06-25 19:28:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Because trump is a biggoted racist hater
879058346879451136 2017-06-25 19:26:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LaraLeaTrump @FoxNews @AGaggleOfWolves The trumps wouldn't know what the truth is.
879057651593879552 2017-06-25 19:24:10 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews You must have been watching the presidents latest interview
879057169278267392 2017-06-25 19:22:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LaraLeaTrump @FoxNews Why do we care what she has to say. Does her being married to a trump somehow make her more relevant ? I think not
879055622729342976 2017-06-25 19:16:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @PageSix A few months ago I would have said impossible but now I'm not so sure
879055324510027776 2017-06-25 19:14:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews When will he do an interview and talk about something of substance. Oh what was I thinking - never because he has no substance
879053925634236416 2017-06-25 19:09:22 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski Trudeau is actually a leader not a narcissist
879053217807704064 2017-06-25 19:06:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realtimhess The problem is pence is legit dangerous. He had such radical beliefs. Trump is just downright dumb
879052874730401795 2017-06-25 19:05:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HuffPost And with no mandate to provide insurance how will they have coverage? How far do you think 7.25 an hour goes. What a rich ignorant woman
879052339021328384 2017-06-25 19:03:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @ABC Yeah but not until they make that bill even crueler.  Have you seen who the holdouts are
879052063270998017 2017-06-25 19:01:58 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski I have to agree. He believes in gay conversion therapy. He's whacko
879050931995906048 2017-06-25 18:57:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski And they still don't believe it. That's an alternative fact
879050473352908801 2017-06-25 18:55:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews Yeah spend 100 mill on protecting you and your family, Discriminate against millions Use twitter all day, golf, take away healthcare
879049576572911616 2017-06-25 18:52:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @HillaryClinton @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends @FoxNews Why is it your so hung up on Hillary? Oh yeah you have no relevant original thoughts
879049187010244608 2017-06-25 18:50:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Brasilmagic @AynRandPaulRyan @owenbernard @lafloran And they are all trumps personal friends.  They are the ones getting the tax breaks while the let sick Americans die and refuse coverage
879048602340995072 2017-06-25 18:48:13 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @KeithOlbermann And whose the nut job ?  Do they all just use alternative facts ?
879048263734874112 2017-06-25 18:46:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DrAlParsons Me too !!!
879047880186765312 2017-06-25 18:45:21 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei He is a disgrace
879047362399875073 2017-06-25 18:43:17 UTC <Brizzicpa> @eugenegu @BrandonTXNeely @TrumpBlocks Of course he's block a doctor they would have something relevant to contribute. He only likes to listen to yes people with no substance
879045964195147778 2017-06-25 18:37:44 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Visitkarte @pewresearch Based on these demographics trump will have no supporters soon. His Medicaid cuts will not pay for all the nursing homes they are headed to
879010400741855232 2017-06-25 16:16:25 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenWarren @POTUS @FoxNews She should block you like you do when people call you names.
879009694999859201 2017-06-25 16:13:37 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan I pay plenty of taxes and I don't mind paying for others healthcare that's what a civil society does.
879008675779792896 2017-06-25 16:09:34 UTC <Brizzicpa> @AynRandPaulRyan Something tells me he doesn't pay a dime of tax. Ask him to post his tax return
879008469889806336 2017-06-25 16:08:45 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS @FoxNews When is he going to question himself on doing nothing
879007962022465536 2017-06-25 16:06:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @MSNBC He's too busy announcing that obama didn't do anything
879007791121395716 2017-06-25 16:06:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You're not going to go anywhere where they challenge or disagree with you
879007592781152259 2017-06-25 16:05:15 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You don't care about Bernie. You just want to defer attention from your own collusion onto somebody else.  That's what criminals do.
879005087695241217 2017-06-25 15:55:18 UTC <Brizzicpa> @DavidALieb @AP It will finally change the Supreme Court has ruled against this
879004316404785152 2017-06-25 15:52:14 UTC <Brizzicpa> @LaraLeaTrump @FoxNews She's relevant how?
879004037336748038 2017-06-25 15:51:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @WSJ And he will finally own the disaster instead of blaming Obamacare.  When it fails he'll have no one to blame
878999906039582720 2017-06-25 15:34:43 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost @friend4more Every day I spend in NYC
878812184570195969 2017-06-24 03:08:46 UTC <Brizzicpa> @CBSNews Even though it was shipped last week some how trump will say this is obamas fault
878806083724333057 2017-06-24 02:44:32 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely @Dani_L_Sage He just went through the contacts in his phone and dialed up his friends
878805835253788674 2017-06-24 02:43:33 UTC <Brizzicpa> @UBS I hate when the phone makes my correct word wrong
878805574544224258 2017-06-24 02:42:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @Forbes I honestly didn't know people gave anything.but.
878805412929310720 2017-06-24 02:41:52 UTC <Brizzicpa> @UBS Get rid of the electorate college.
878804459551326209 2017-06-24 02:38:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BBCNews This is awful. Here in America our president and congress are doing the same thing.
878800700607746048 2017-06-24 02:23:09 UTC <Brizzicpa> What do we really expect his vocabulary consists of huge, amazing, maga and great. My 14 month old has a better vocabulary
878800012427350016 2017-06-24 02:20:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @TIME Tweet this photo to the Vice President and I guarantee you'll be blocked. Or he'll direct you to conversion therapy offices
878796088999903232 2017-06-24 02:04:49 UTC <Brizzicpa> @StephenKing Me too ! I didn't have the courage to admit it until you did.
878795158132842496 2017-06-24 02:01:07 UTC <Brizzicpa> @GeorgeTakei Beautiful! I love NY.
878792838384951296 2017-06-24 01:51:54 UTC <Brizzicpa> @BrandonTXNeely I didn't know that. Please thank American creed for the enlightenment
878790633342816257 2017-06-24 01:43:08 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost Trump says he doesn't drink so what do we think causes his atrophy ?
878790143590756352 2017-06-24 01:41:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @williamlegate How is trump supposed to be trusted with nukes if he can't even accept criticism
878789757085638660 2017-06-24 01:39:39 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump When are you going to stop blaming obama and take responsibility for your own short comings. What are you doing about it now? Nothing.
878788939431251968 2017-06-24 01:36:24 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump You would have just called it fake news
878788450568343553 2017-06-24 01:34:28 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump No now they want us to suffer broken trump care.
878783177866829825 2017-06-24 01:13:31 UTC <Brizzicpa> @realDonaldTrump In order to do that we need to go back before you were elected.  That's the only way to make America great again. Or you could resign.
878779235560771584 2017-06-24 00:57:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> You must be in Huntington ny this is the norm
878779033944809472 2017-06-24 00:57:03 UTC <Brizzicpa> @washingtonpost No. They don't have one original idea. The only idea they have is repeal Obama policies
878778823000690688 2017-06-24 00:56:12 UTC <Brizzicpa> @SenateMajLdr @HeatherWhaley Not surprising you don't think those old ass shriveled up senators can get it up without help
878707288953028608 2017-06-24 20:11:57 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS So try giving them something better not that piece a crap that's being voted on now

878637825729679360 2017-06-24 15:35:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @tonyposnanski @APH005 It's so sad but true.
878637107153121281 2017-06-24 15:33:05 UTC <Brizzicpa> @POTUS So stop giving tax breaks to your friends, on the backs of the poor. Stop attacking women's health, stop kissing the asses of insurance co

878632515963060225 2017-06-24 15:14:50 UTC <Brizzicpa> @FoxNews Waste of money
878506242234241024 2017-06-23 06:53:04 UTC <Brizzicpa> @avast_antivirus Ironic I just googled them today was interested in this from a referral from somebody

878455350869057537 2017-06-23 03:30:51 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes I feel like it needs to be spelled out for some in this country: it's called trying to intimidate a witness

878442580421337088 2017-06-23 02:40:06 UTC <Brizzicpa> @chrislhayes @CBSEveningNews Because it's not a healthcare bill it's a tax cut bill for the rich. It has no mandate to buy insurance or for employers to provide it
878441723105603586 2017-06-23 02:36:42 UTC <Brizzicpa> @meganamram As much as it pains me to admit mike princes wife is into saving the bees.  She just had thousands brought to the vp home
878440524264460288 2017-06-23 02:31:56 UTC <Brizzicpa> @NPR Because he's leading a congress that has no policies of its own
