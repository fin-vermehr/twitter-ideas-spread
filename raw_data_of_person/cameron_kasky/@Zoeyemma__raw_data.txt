964396401311473667 2018-02-15 07:09:54 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @realDonaldTrump If you cared at all about American children, you would do the right thing and take some action. The only thing prayer and condolences will do is take more innocent childrens lives, I dont want my friends to be victims.
960677321366630400 2018-02-05 00:51:36 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @NerdyAndQuirky For most people school is either to hard or not hard enough, there is no in between
960677079791452160 2018-02-05 00:50:38 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @NerdyAndQuirky They dont care about your well being, as a 13 year old, I am already losing hair and have bags under my eyes from stress
960676792699781120 2018-02-05 00:49:30 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @NerdyAndQuirky They make you think that school is the most important thing, even more important then sleep, eating etc. and then give us crapping educations that will mean nothing in the long run.
960676461744041984 2018-02-05 00:48:11 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @NerdyAndQuirky When the teachers treats you like a child then get mad when you act like a child
960676096768225280 2018-02-05 00:46:44 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @NerdyAndQuirky When teachers can grade something months after it was due but we can turn something in just a little bit late

941450987985821696 2017-12-14 23:33:01 UTC <Zoeyemma_> @AjitPaiFCC @SteveScalise When you work for the government, sometimes you need to put the public before your own personal gain. Internet is so needed now days and is a part of our everyday lives. Net neutrality is important and you are to stupid to understand what is good for your country. Read a book.
