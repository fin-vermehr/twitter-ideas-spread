965755111770345473 2018-02-19 01:08:56 UTC <PaigeThimmesch> Comforting to know that if another school shooting happens again (if we dont change these gun laws), adults will give us their thoughts and prayers while secretly shaming our efforts for sensible reform
965754348314808320 2018-02-19 01:05:54 UTC <PaigeThimmesch> THIS is who you actually get when you get past all the thoughts and prayer bshttps://twitter.com/kamvtv/status/965281730176299008
964565733454827520 2018-02-16 18:22:46 UTC <PaigeThimmesch> In an ideal world, I support a 100% ban on guns and gun manufacturing; but I know thats not realistic in the United States. We need justice for the innocent students and teachers who died in #Parkland and that required the bare minimum of stricter gun laws!
964564552095551489 2018-02-16 18:18:04 UTC <PaigeThimmesch> To the conservative kids in my Econ class - thank you. I know we dont see everything similarly, but we all agree on more sensible gun laws that  require bans on extreme, military grade weapons and better background checks
