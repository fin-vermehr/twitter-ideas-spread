If you didn't vote against it, you're for it.

I dont agree that the DNC "rigged" the vote in favor of Hillary. We can go back and forth on what the article/doc says but that would be moot. I would simply ask, what do you really think came out of the doc/DNC that tipped the primary for her?
953473458645565440 2018-01-16 03:46:01 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @thehill @BenEHauna @saralynne65 @atom_cable @ScubaForDogs thanks for the article. I took the time to read it. in it it shares 1. there was an agreement that 1. activities performed under the agreement focused on prep for the general election and NOT the primary 2. similar agreements could be made with ANY candidate including Bernie

Did she not walk back every statement she made after the book was released? Ball is still in your court...

953271881787994112 2018-01-16 14:25:02 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AngryBlackLady @TheRootOf_je @ChrisAndersen Of course it is. That's a good bumper sticker for 2020: Didn't Vote for Iraq War. fuck prison reform, climate change, the Supreme Court and all that, im voting for whoever didn't vote for Iraq. I'm brilliant. Don't you think my single issue focus is visionary?

They get fed the talking points from sunup (Fox & Friends) to sundown (rep talk radio, Hannity). once the mission is accomplished the GOP callously drops the faade, then gives their voters other sticks to fetch (entitlements)

949165872815529984 2018-01-04 06:29:13 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind besides heitkamp and manchin, who? blue dogs are a thing of the past. those 2 don't constitute the "dems". theyre 2 ppl.  I just dont see why we cant put these things on the shoulder of the ppl who propose and lie and advocate for them.
949165063797133312 2018-01-04 06:26:00 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind no I didn't say hes worse than hitler. I said hes the worst example. not as bad as bush is a matter of perspective, but as you said he has time. hes been far more consequential. packing the courts will have a huge, long-ranging impact.
949162772784406528 2018-01-04 06:16:54 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind with hitler being prolly the worst example, you don't have to be competent to be dangerous or impactful. in fact, I would argue he's more dangerous because of his incompetent buffoonery.
949161806924271616 2018-01-04 06:13:04 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind it was the dems? the only absurdity being revealed in the era of trump is the false narrative of the establishment/neoliberal democrat "powers that be". you're saying that while trump is just gave a tax cut to the corporate and super wealthy interests w/out a single dem vote
949160729508286464 2018-01-04 06:08:47 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind I would say a trade off that didnt have to happen and is of too much consequence. federal courts alone were too much to risk. is this one of those blame liberals for shit the GOP does outright blogs? trump is dems fault? how? establishment played the system? in what way?
949149768235667457 2018-01-04 05:25:13 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @thehill theyre trying to stomp out this Mueller investigation as quick as they can
949137787290230784 2018-01-04 04:37:37 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind the scoreboard doesn't roll back to zero when hes out of office. what I would've wanted to see from the blog is how we recover from the trump agenda and move forward.
949137184048799744 2018-01-04 04:35:13 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ProgressOfAKind the impact of his presidency will resonate for decades. it will take decades to erase the damage he will do/has done and all of it wont be undone. if we will sustain all of this and what we get out of the deal is breaking the cycle of establishment liberals? not necessary.
949133193608880128 2018-01-04 04:19:22 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn yeah. that's enough. this is wack. im out.
949131635479412736 2018-01-04 04:13:10 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @_KJKelly @Br3wn good for you. im sure you got everything you wanted out of 2016. enjoy your tax cuts.
949130212192776193 2018-01-04 04:07:31 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn youre trying to score cheap political points on some shit somebody told you was offensive except for the ppl who were supposedly the target of the offense.
949128253599551489 2018-01-04 03:59:44 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn I at least gave you a poll to reference 2009 sentiment or did you miss that? show your work.
949127978876850176 2018-01-04 03:58:38 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @_KJKelly @Br3wn im loving how you take all of the things you want and blame dems for not having it as opposed to the GOP whos working to take/keep it away from you. youre not interested in making change you just want to make arguments.
949127396728475650 2018-01-04 03:56:19 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn Hillary owned slaves? word? thanks for that headsup. I don't give a shit who she was for in the 60s. the super predators line is spun by her enemies as though she said that of all black ppl. its an overblown overhyped line that meant nothing to black ppl then and now. FOH.
949119354293059584 2018-01-04 03:24:22 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn you need to pay attention to what@_KJKelly just wrote. that's how it works. they barely passed that shit. the nation in 2008 was not clamoring for national healthcare. if they could've done it, name the votes. where was the support for it?
949118608281653248 2018-01-04 03:21:24 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn im black. yes in know the system is unjust. no I don't like jeff sessions that's why i voted against the MF that was campaigning around the country with jeff sessions. i voted for the woman that wouldn't hire a jeff sessions. FOH
949117889482719232 2018-01-04 03:18:33 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn yeah, im not going to stay up all night going over this again and again. you're either nave or disingenuous. the same for the most part implies that dems would do everything their doing now. explain party-line votes. where's the bipartisan support on ANYTHING?
949115524134391808 2018-01-04 03:09:09 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn did trump make it more or less corrupt? its simple. its not rocket science. did shit get better or worse? its not about protecting them. its about protecting the country from a fuckin embicile president. real question. how old are you?
949114574254592000 2018-01-04 03:05:22 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn however weak dodd-frank is Hillary wanted to reform it and strengthen it for whatever that's worth. trump wants to destroy it and de-regulate. so instead of watered down you get poisoned water.
949114147513470977 2018-01-04 03:03:41 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn go do your own research, kid. I cant answer everything for you. just know that everything didnt happen the way you outline it. Bush signed TARP. Obama did try to provide relief to homeowners via a tax on the banks, it didn't passhttps://www.thebalance.com/tarp-bailout-program-3305895
949111960360177664 2018-01-04 02:54:59 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn who did she hire/fire? those debate questions changed the course of history? really? DWS shouldve resigned, she was a bum. super delegates pledged to her early in 08. she still lost.
949111296603107328 2018-01-04 02:52:21 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn yes, we have obamacare (for now) and not nationalized care. still not the choice. the choice was improve obamacare vs. destroy obamacare and go back to what we had before and by the way state lines and whatever. it was a clear choice 20M more insured or losing insurance
949110337160261633 2018-01-04 02:48:32 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn yes opposite. the bailout, unlike GOP primaries was a particular event. its not an ongoing question. thats not the choice in ANYONES platform.bailing them out was the right choice. nationalizing them is a dumb one.
949107152458846208 2018-01-04 02:35:53 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn Bernie would disagree as would O'Malley. Hillary ran she won. no one else ran. shes not a mafia don. the dnc acted in her favor how? no one called the primary they showed you the vote totals by state. by general ballot she won. with or without superdelegates she won.
949106364768571392 2018-01-04 02:32:45 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn the 2016 primary was a very particular event. every other GOP winner ran on immigration reform.
949104431374757888 2018-01-04 02:25:04 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn ok, lets say you're right. its not the criminals fault, its the cops fault for not stopping the criminals. fine. what should the dems be doing different despite the fact that theyre essentially the polar opposite of GOP on EVERY policy. what are they missing that makes them fail
949103303064997890 2018-01-04 02:20:35 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn you saying she cheated? she commit voter fraud? machines were rigged? whats hard to understand about ppl voting for her? and what does popularity have to do with anything? im not looking for a tiger beat presidential poster to hang on my wall. I want someone to run the country
949101871410679809 2018-01-04 02:14:54 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn I would say the bottom line is that the nation chose her by 3MIL more votes. the electoral college was decided by fewer than 15K votes in a few key states. those deficits could have been wiped away by a few thousand choosing to not vote.
949100775107629057 2018-01-04 02:10:32 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn I also think ppls perception of the dnc is overblown and is too dismissive of Hillary as though the former 1st lady of Ark/USA, NY senator and secy of state could only garner support thx to the all powerful dnc?
949099457651593216 2018-01-04 02:05:18 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn 2. brazile said what she said to build excitement for her book then walked back everything she said. she said they had a financial agreement w hillarys campaign although they offered the same to Bernie.
949099070651592704 2018-01-04 02:03:46 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn 1. The dems didn't pretend they had warren or booker neither were running for prez. the case you're making sounds like you think every year they hand select their prize heifers for show at the rodeo. its usually up to whoevers running to build support and it goes from there
949097665144459264 2018-01-04 01:58:11 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn considering that republicans control the majority of national, state and local governments, I would think it difficult to dismiss their voters as though they aren't part of the mainstream or reflective of the nation in any way.
949097127812239360 2018-01-04 01:56:03 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn @Michaelschurtz2 that's brilliant analysis. you're right, sir. he's doing a bang-up job. sorry for having wasted your time.
949047922871754759 2018-01-04 22:40:31 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ezraklein I love how catty journalists are to each other
949040531060985856 2018-01-04 22:11:09 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn And don't forget that athough she lost to the most "unpopular candidate of all time" she still beat him by 3MIL and she also beat the "most popular candidate" in the primary by 4MIL. also, DT wiped the floor with 16 other candidates including every "future of the GOP" candidate
949039366827073537 2018-01-04 22:06:32 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @AP @Grey_Obelisk @Br3wn Unless not voting makes you immune to the impact of Trump and his decisions then, yes, they too have some degree of responsibility. Just because your choice isn't a perfect or even terrible choice, it doesn't absolve you from the responsibility to choose.

948282902156017673 2018-01-02 20:00:36 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @thehill I mean they did pass the corporate tax cut of their wet dreams. What was left for them to do? While we're laughing at them for "dropping like flies" they're laughing thinking "mission accomplished".

948269953068814336 2018-01-02 19:09:09 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @HillaryClinton @peterdaou the media does it because her name brings instant eyes and clicks. They use her name to manipulate ppl and push an agenda. Some are obsessed and don't know why. others who would have her dragged into the streets tarred and feathered. They won't stop. We should defend her

Frankly Dems are too f'ing polite. That's why I loved Weiner and Grayson. Know who used to not be a pushover? Debbie Wasserman-Schultz before her DNC days. We need more blunt spokesppl

948188288866816001 2018-01-02 13:44:39 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @ShaunKing Bashing Hillary Clinton still gets views and clicks. Doesn't matter the context. This is a sucker move that is just one micro-smear in a sea of smears that paints a macro-smear that will be a wedge and rallying cry for progressives and DSA in 2018 and 2020

947260601599975429 2017-12-30 00:18:21 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @peterdaou This is so telling. Notice they keep using wrestling memes? That's who they are. Fake tough guys who sell their act as real while they know it's fake. Sad part is their voters are just like wrestling fans. They either don't know it's not real or they do and don't care.

947119559491948544 2017-12-30 14:57:54 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @thedailybeast I talked to Putin and he totally denies it. I asked him and he said it wasn't him. How many times should I ask him. We have to move on. He totally denies it. It's rude to keep asking. He denies it. He said he didn't do it. This is a sad attempt from Dems to distract. They lost.
946958586428755968 2017-12-29 04:18:15 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @maggieNYT @dukewilson Very clear. Like that interview really just put everything we didn't know before into perspective. I didn't understand all of his tweets but hat rambling incoherent interview just made it all plain.
946957997556817920 2017-12-29 04:15:54 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @maggieNYT @chrispanza Right! Like that's the most valuable shit ever. Honestly his tweets are more revealing. What more do you need to know about this man you don't know already?

946446169902845952 2017-12-28 18:22:05 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @nataliesurely Her only appeal being her vagina doesn't stand up considering she lost to Obama and she lost to Trump. If a uterus were a highly prized criterion I would think all women that ran would've done better. But we don't care about the others do we? We only care that she beat Bernie
946444744825233413 2017-12-28 18:16:25 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @nataliesurely This comes off as more of a piece on "Clinton fandom as written by a Bernie Fan who's fandom won't allow me to see her appeal and why she won and all I could come up with is she's a woman".

946232119025717248 2017-12-27 04:11:31 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @MrDane1982 she only did this cuz she knew then she was running for President. A la Biff Tannen she took the delorean and traveled back in time to meet her 5 year old self and convinced herself to do service to puff her resume. Same thing happened with Obama and his fake birth certificate.
946229626258456576 2017-12-27 04:01:37 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @CapehartJ You and Terence Trent D'Arby should make an album and use this pic as the cover

946113754835636224 2017-12-27 20:21:11 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @HillaryWarnedUs More than that they want her tarred and feathered. Locked up. Flogged in the capitol.

945827647904473088 2017-12-26 01:24:18 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @KatyTurNBC No! The Trump voter is a minority. Dems would do better to unite and actually turn out. Too many were willing to stay home or protest vote. Those voters are more "gettable" than Trumpers. Trump got fewer votes than Romney and McCain. Quit remaking this same story over and over.

944581922256248833 2017-12-23 14:54:14 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @insanityreport Well duh. Of course he did. There's a lot of money in it. Jimmy Dore and HA Goodman only recently figured this out. The new hustle is shepherding the #dumbdumbleft to attack Dems, normalize Trump and indict Hillary on murder charges cuz that's what true progressives do

It's a 2-week funding bill. they have better leverage after the break
944286811354025984 2017-12-22 19:21:34 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @_michaelbrooks Naw bruh. Not decades. Round the same time Trump was rec saying he grabs women by the pussy. Assault this is not but the idea that ppl can't or shouldn't be disgusted by it cuz it happened so long ago is kinda wack. Any criticism is fair.
944259632494796801 2017-12-22 17:33:34 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @CandiceAiston I would; however, settle for an apology for the "hey let's knee-cap Kamala Harris way before she declares for 2020 so we can clear the field for Bernie in case he runs" videos
944254607076790272 2017-12-22 17:13:36 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> Fuckin Ahttps://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/944211312472571904
944253781012897792 2017-12-22 17:10:19 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> I opened this thinking he was apologizing for all those "Hillary is a war-mongering neoliberal corporatist Wall Street whore bitch" videos they were running 3-4 times a day during the primaries. My badhttps://twitter.com/candiceaiston/status/944241888109912065
943882675634491392 2017-12-21 16:35:41 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @CandiceAiston the latter. There's several "media" figures who's only angle is Hillary. dozens of YouTube talking heads ONLY talk Hillary cuz that's what gets clicks and likes on the #dumbdumbleft. According to them she should be indicted any day now. And she cut Seth richs throat.

943848944769077249 2017-12-21 14:21:38 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki So...

None of the generalized talking point reimagined shit you're talking about adds up to this tax bill. I'm surprised you didn't throw in the emails and super predators.
943847747559583746 2017-12-21 14:16:53 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki And again what does this have to do with the tax bill? Nothing? Ok then. You're arguing about her not committing to raise SS caps while Trump and the GOP will now slash SS and other programs to fund their tax cuts
943846966366277633 2017-12-21 14:13:47 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki And yet all of these things you're talking about still doesn't even relate to what we're talking about. Would she have proposed this tax legislation or sign it if it came to her desk. I'm talking about the tax plan she ran on and you're talking about tv pundits and Facebook ads

A few things 1. I chose Bernie over her in the primary 2. My info comes from many places. We're on a thread that has TYT and Dore tagged to it. How the fuck you think I got here? Morning Joe?
943844277112770560 2017-12-21 14:03:06 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki Where they really differ is her plan would've increased the AMT (Buffett rule) and would've added to the estate tax. Trump just did the exact opposite yet you argue they would've done the same. That is incredibly disingenuous
943839686035951616 2017-12-21 13:44:51 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki How about the tax plan that she actually ran on instead of "what about the bankruptcy bill?" Which has nothing to do about tax by the way. Her actual tax plan would've kept the current bracket while adding tax to those above 5M on invest
943837717019930625 2017-12-21 13:37:02 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki You just offered "the company she keeps" as facts and evidence and a general "legislation she supported". Were any tif those pieces of legislation tax legislation?
943836758445297665 2017-12-21 13:33:13 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki Again these are all things that are not even tangentially related to implementing or supporting the sweeping tax cuts that Trump and the GOP just signed into law.

943664687715115009 2017-12-20 02:09:28 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @jimmy_dore @johniadarola @thorbxl @ArktinenJenkki Yeah...naw. Not really. There's two sets of $ here. ones that circulate in the US subject to US tax and ones outside the US that arent. Bringing money in onetime for and allocating a portion to an infrastructure bank is not the same as cutting taxes on ppl/ corps in perpetuity

943596381310156801 2017-12-20 21:38:03 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @SenSanders @Jlo_Too @Coach_CoPo You seem more misinformed than anyone. You're simply looking at the tax brackets. You do understand that these are not the only components of what makes up your taxes, right?

942442860737114112 2017-12-17 17:14:22 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @POLITICOMag Im deeply religious & far left. Many on the left and right think these ideals dont intersect. Theyre wrong.

Jones victory flies in the face of everything @cenkuygur said for past couple yrs so they can push progressives only and hobble Dems that dont line up. If Jones lost they'd be saying how DNC so weak they lost to a child molester. Not about policy, it's the people.

940413429143277568 2017-12-11 02:50:08 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @YouTube @majorityfm @WanderRoast There was nothing courageous about standing down while Trump was at the gate

I found that more unacceptable than any speeches at Goldman or fuckin emails. That MF has a fake university, man. C'mon man
940411781729660928 2017-12-11 02:43:35 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @YouTube @majorityfm @WanderRoast What he pushed was that Donald Trump was unacceptable. Period. Nobody was in love with Hillary but if you wanted wholesale change Trump was not only NOT going to give you what you wanted he was going to give you the exact opposite with no grease

940405329107537920 2017-12-11 02:17:57 UTC <NovusNegrimLLG> @YouTube @majorityfm @WanderRoast And he was right for it. It's easy to forget that what repubs are doing has been their mission for decades. when they finally do make wholesale change they're thrown out. It's the only time dems gain power. And the ppl he's been punching deserved to be punched. They're jackasses
