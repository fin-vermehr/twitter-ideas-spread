970573347217117186 2018-03-05 08:14:53 UTC <Suavebones> @JerriSwann21 Exactly right. All the NRA does is deflect. Oh, you cant ban that rifle because assault weapon is the wrong terminology, or Oh, you cant criticize the NRA because our roots were worthy. Screw them.

965450592817737729 2018-02-18 04:58:53 UTC <Suavebones> @sweeper53 @ckn4502 I have no problem with impassioned young people leading change. I am, however, sniffy about persons of any age throwing away votes in the main election on third-party candidates, which I think was the original commenter's point. But OTOH, I'm sleepy and going to take a nap.
965442330248515584 2018-02-18 04:26:03 UTC <Suavebones> @2B_Painfree @tribelaw Nope. Objectivists have horrid beliefs that diminish humanity. Theyve always been awful, whatever protective coloration theyre wearing.

965112333927411713 2018-02-17 06:34:45 UTC <Suavebones> @NYCNavid @landopedia @taylorln_9 So we shouldn't treat gun suicides as a gun problem? Odd idea. As for mass killings, they are done, almost exclusively, by boys or men  with war-like guns. Again, a gun problem.
965052721261891588 2018-02-17 02:37:53 UTC <Suavebones> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson What's happening in society is that angry men (98% of mass shooters are men) are using warlike weapons to destroy random lives. Let's prohibit men from owning guns.

965024121355677696 2018-02-17 00:44:14 UTC <Suavebones> @debst103 @TDPattillo Actually a great idea.
965023285519020032 2018-02-17 00:40:55 UTC <Suavebones> @ClaraJeffery The Trumps breezed through a hospital for photo ops with not-badly-injured teens, while making zero effort to visit with families of the dead. It's just unfathomably disgusting.
965022444644904961 2018-02-17 00:37:34 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Oh, Chris - this is both sad and stupid. It may yet be determined that the outcome of the election was affected - even manipulated - by Rusdia. Please look at Mike Farb's work for how this might be proven. Never say never.
965020962776342528 2018-02-17 00:31:41 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump We know you are lying.
965013359446974469 2018-02-17 00:01:28 UTC <Suavebones> @NYCNavid @landopedia Dealing with gun control should be his first priority. Every country has mental illness. Only the US has this obscene level of gun murders.

964985919869718534 2018-02-17 22:12:26 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Obama met with the families of the Sandy Hook dead - all of them. Trump met with the living - coward.

White collar and political wrongdoers, however, enter into joint defense agreements daily. He blocked me for saying so.

964737159482748928 2018-02-16 05:43:57 UTC <Suavebones> @porpentina2017 Me. Abramson but is *not* a sophisticated DC insider. He wrote earlier this year that joint defense agreements are "rare" in criminal proceedings. But in fact, in cases involving white collar or political issues, they are common. He blocked me for politely pointing out his error.

964324685973458944 2018-02-15 02:24:56 UTC <Suavebones> @markberman Problem is that none of the "red flags" was illegal. The only illegal thing he did was start shooting people. Our gun laws need to change.
964324331944861702 2018-02-15 02:23:31 UTC <Suavebones> @Alyssa_Milano This is such an unhelpful factoid for America. Scotland didn't have a Second Amendment and years' worth of Supreme Court decisions validating and expanding it. Scotland has only a few million citizens, and had, it is estimated, fewer than a half million guns. The US has 300 mill
964319790738403328 2018-02-15 02:05:28 UTC <Suavebones> @EWErickson If it were "killing" to perform an abortion, it would be illegal. Stop with the melodramatics.
964259055748501504 2018-02-15 22:04:08 UTC <Suavebones> @jjmacnab I suspect I'm alone in saying I don't give a crap why this shooter was shooting. There will *always* be a "reason" or "motive." What matters is that guns of war are available to enable anyone in this country to use their "reasons" to commit mass murder. #GunControlNow

963970574908260353 2018-02-14 02:57:49 UTC <Suavebones> @GabbyGiffords Of course it is not safe any longer to send our kids to school.

I doubt it. We all reflect upon our helplessness in these mass shootings, given that we have a gov't bought and paid for by the NRA, and think about our own lives.

962909366922948608 2018-02-11 04:40:57 UTC <Suavebones> @ImGraceBowers And thats what happens when ignoramuses achieve positions of power.

962428852017532929 2018-02-10 20:51:34 UTC <Suavebones> @dbraiman Fine line my ass.
962426513789472768 2018-02-10 20:42:16 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @KristinKarnitz Um, faith and science *are* mutually exclusive. They are, in fact, opposites.
962194141412233216 2018-02-09 05:18:54 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump @graceschroeder She is twenty-frickin-eight. In what world is that so young?
962193794442649600 2018-02-09 05:17:31 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump Um, no. She is a grown woman. She has seen the photos. Stop infantilizing her choices.
962132469142171650 2018-02-09 01:13:50 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid Retired after a long and successful career, thanks. Perhaps try not attacking people who have actual facts behind them.
962107669812137984 2018-02-09 23:35:18 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid This is very tedious. I know the law on this.
962107437221404672 2018-02-09 23:34:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Kat4Obama @JoyAnnReid In the law firm, where male partners stalk the halls ...

962006455200055298 2018-02-09 16:53:06 UTC <Suavebones> @bmaz They are all so horrid.
962002924833529859 2018-02-09 16:39:05 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid Seventeen states had changed their prosecution rules by 1983 to drop the spousal exemption. NY was just the first state to declare such prosecution rules unconstitutional. I was around then, too, working on these issues.
961910850322878464 2018-02-09 10:33:12 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid Trust me, it was not the case in every state. Sorry that yours was one of the bad ones.
961904022356680704 2018-02-09 10:06:04 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid Actually, thats not true.
961903333802848256 2018-02-09 10:03:20 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump What the hell are you talking about?
961883863491497984 2018-02-09 08:45:58 UTC <Suavebones> @Adaripp @VP You support absolutely NO LGBT Americans. We know this because you have a long history and we have long memories.
961753761894068225 2018-02-08 00:09:00 UTC <Suavebones> @jimsciutto Oh, Jim. Dems expand the debt to provide services for those in need. The GOP expands the debt to give gifts to their already-wealthy donors. See a difference here?
961753336654557184 2018-02-08 00:07:18 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Finally, she gets it. Its SUPPOSED to be hurtful, to cause her shame, and to force her to amend her destructive policies.
961753037172891649 2018-02-08 00:06:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Amy_in_Michigan Hope he gets together with a nice gal who likes kicking men in the gonads.

961745428508274688 2018-02-08 23:35:53 UTC <Suavebones> @GOP @RandPaul @LiberalLecter Oh, please. Thats like congratulating the Mayor of Hypocrite City for calling out some hypocrites while nevertheless acting as the biggest hypocrite of them all (voting for huge tax bennies for the rich).
961742053825810432 2018-02-08 23:22:28 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Nothing about being an American requires the involvement of God. Nothing.

961064884028035072 2018-02-06 02:31:38 UTC <Suavebones> @sweeper53 @krassenstein In the federal government, I was expected to read, comprehend, edit, comment on and move forward dozens, even at times hundreds, of pages of legal work per day.

961045453822414849 2018-02-06 01:14:26 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Obviously a joke. Wait, what?
961044908772610053 2018-02-06 01:12:16 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump I like you, but loathe others. Sometimes I want to say my piece to the latter and *deny* the f*ckers the ability to hit back. Not really confusing.

960651758073729024 2018-02-05 23:10:01 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SenJeffMerkley This president is not just a haphazard doofus. He is a monumental threat to this countrys freedoms. I hope Senate Dems are laser-focused on that fact and have some plans for counteracting it.
960647245598248960 2018-02-05 22:52:05 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd Dont be silly. If the market sees that the administration is ditching corporate regulations and investigations (which it has been doing), the market may well go up. If the market sees that the admin is failing under the weight of a crazy dictator, it may well fall.

960313132697743361 2018-02-04 00:44:27 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone I think you may have taken this episode too much to heart. Speaking as a fat person, I am *all* for fat-shaming and everything-else shaming that orange pile of putrescence. You have smart friends here. Dont let the dolts menace you.

960004013994467330 2018-02-03 04:16:07 UTC <Suavebones> @pacelattin Mueller was selected to, and did, deliver the uranium sample to Russia in 2009. But so what? There was nothing squirrelly or underhanded about the transaction.

959998985237823488 2018-02-03 03:56:08 UTC <Suavebones> @czarcastic1 @paulkrugman @mark_woodard You are a hazard to America, Mark Woodard, if you truly believe what you said. Only greedy bigots and the desperately stupid agree with you.
959705660031225858 2018-02-03 08:30:34 UTC <Suavebones> @starincali @aroseblush I thought a kidney stone was likely, too. But other things are possible - heart, flu, etc. Be sure to keep an eye on your temperature and other symptoms. And I hope you feel better!
959644109924438017 2018-02-02 04:25:59 UTC <Suavebones> @DougSides Oh, I see. Your deck is missing a few cards.
959607619269767168 2018-02-02 02:00:59 UTC <Suavebones> @RepMattGaetz Wow. Its amazing to see how much a thunderingly stupid person can get wrong in one Tweet.

959280015023091717 2018-02-01 04:19:12 UTC <Suavebones> @IronStache When I worked in the federal govt, we would argue about whether specific words in our public statements contained too much or too little emphasis, to be sure the public got the right info. The mere notion of suppressing a tidal wave of contrary evidence is just horrifying.
959277661792059392 2018-02-01 04:09:51 UTC <Suavebones> @nytdavidbrooks @JamilSmith Women are not having abortions between 20 and 24 weeks for fun, or out of laziness, or because they changed their minds. In every post-20 week case, something devastating has been discovered about the health/development of the fetus. After 24 weeks, the issue is life of the mom

Can we hear your thoughts?
958792450654588928 2018-01-31 20:01:48 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets Too mild.

958696285191720960 2018-01-31 13:39:40 UTC <Suavebones> @natureofthings7 Its part of Sheriff Joe Arpaios pathology - he has spoken, and acted - often illegally - against immigrants for 30+ years. Arpaio and Trump share the same hatred of brown people.

958516481679134721 2018-01-30 01:45:12 UTC <Suavebones> @moorehn What a tedious way to defend the wholly unnecessary practice of wearing makeup. I think you may have missed the part of the article that was ridiculing you.

958485858704912385 2018-01-30 23:43:31 UTC <Suavebones> I wouldnt watch it if someone had a gun to my head demanding that I do so. And of course, in AZ, that possibility is far from remote.https://twitter.com/funder/status/958334534461935616

958452602886414337 2018-01-30 21:31:22 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Given that DOJ in fact did *not* wait until after 11/8  to release the news, and given the fact that McCabe is now gone, wtf is this IG investigation looking for that could conceivably amount to a hill of beans?
958449842866524160 2018-01-30 21:20:24 UTC <Suavebones> @guardian @SusanDFinSD His church is five miles from my home, and directly under a flight path. I keep hoping that if a plane drops, he is beneath it.
958415124548784128 2018-01-30 19:02:26 UTC <Suavebones> @RepAdamSchiff Why cant you restate the main points of your memo in an Op-Ed?
958411661999792130 2018-01-30 18:48:41 UTC <Suavebones> @SureReality It is all such horse twaddle.
958410459090243591 2018-01-30 18:43:54 UTC <Suavebones> I must be missing something. Isnt the fact that Rosenstein authorized extending FISA surveillance against Carter Page a clear indication that Page was a Russian agent in Trumps midst?
958234365959593984 2018-01-29 07:04:10 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @GenFlynn @mflynnJR Im going to state the even more obvious - your father pleaded guilty to a crime. Nobody will forget that fact.
958222762941796352 2018-01-29 06:18:04 UTC <Suavebones> @jayrosen_nyu If only there were some punishment that could be administered to Toobin and his ilk. Preferably involving hot tongs?

957749851424542720 2018-01-28 22:58:53 UTC <Suavebones> @bryanbehar Self-interest is not empathy. All Rs have is self-interest.
957749213978382336 2018-01-28 22:56:21 UTC <Suavebones> No question about it - were headed for a depression in 18-24 months. https://twitter.com/saveamerica2018/status/954927161474863104
957748258742431744 2018-01-28 22:52:33 UTC <Suavebones> @teddavid Its always been a thing. Guess you just dont have one ...
957746646326104075 2018-01-28 22:46:09 UTC <Suavebones> @HoneyDemForce Do they have *any fucking clue* why women seek abortions between 21-24 weeks? It is always because of a severe anomaly in the fetus (discovered when amniocentesis is done around weeks 18-19), or a severe hazard to the mothers health. Not all abortions can be done by 20 weeks.
957661014044106753 2018-01-28 17:05:52 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport Interviewing the team is not recruiting them. Once again, Bill, your conclusions are too far out ahead of the known facts.
957419553243398145 2018-01-27 01:06:24 UTC <Suavebones> @mattmfm Maxine Waters is, on BET.
957407154679570433 2018-01-27 00:17:08 UTC <Suavebones> @AriMelber I was put on a 24-hour Twitter hold because some creep declared me to be a bot. Most annoying.
957406335842254848 2018-01-27 00:13:52 UTC <Suavebones> @tonyposnanski I dont care if its actually ambrosia, the food of the gods. I would starve to death rather than eat this dreadful mans pizza.
957398907264397312 2018-01-27 23:44:21 UTC <Suavebones> @EdKrassen Note howmisconduct and harm are already presumed in this peckerwoods statement.
957392914543534080 2018-01-27 23:20:32 UTC <Suavebones> @RuthMarcus Now if only you would stop picking at the Hillary scab, I could read you again.
957362022265614336 2018-01-27 21:17:47 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrue Just to note that while I too follow Scott Dworkin, he is often out there ahead of the facts on what we wish were true. This is probably one of those times, though I do hope he turns out to be correct.
957356820510670849 2018-01-27 20:57:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Pulsa48 I know Obama was a natural citizen because of his American mother, regardless of where he was born. Same with Cruz. If you have any law that says otherwise, please cite it or stand down, Mr. You Are Not UVA 2009.
957345198060777472 2018-01-27 20:10:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Pulsa48 Children born of US parents are considered natural, not naturalized, citizens.
957344455782256648 2018-01-27 20:07:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Pulsa48 See this:http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/mar/26/ted-cruz-born-canada-eligible-run-president-update/
957339828504457216 2018-01-27 19:49:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Pulsa48 Not true, as was endlessly discussed with respect to Ted Cruz (born in Canada) when he was running for the Presidential nomination in 2016. Are you a lawyer? I was for 30 years, and know this stuff. Where are you getting your ideas?
957338856650690560 2018-01-27 19:45:44 UTC <Suavebones> @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JonJusth @ReporterPhoenix @Tahoesquaw1 @Rosie @IdahoRoadapple @KgKathryn @jawja100 @tess_tess2 @pinewoodsdojo @RescueFarm1 @JamesEFinch @Catlady628 @njterrie @MarilynT4 @gentlemindmom @tango793_anne It was done for many years in various US states for exactly that reason. Louisiana endorsed castration up until the 1970s. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled it to be a cruel or unusual punishment.
957338231011463170 2018-01-27 19:43:15 UTC <Suavebones> @Pulsa48 Um, no. If one of your parents is a US citizen, it has always been held that the parents child is a US citizen, wherever he/she was born.
957329902918873089 2018-01-27 19:10:09 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @rodneycarreiro This was standard HR protocol 10 years ago. But no accusation against Hillary is too petty to be shouted from the rooftops.
957282243633909760 2018-01-27 16:00:46 UTC <Suavebones> @WilDonnelly And your background in standard HR procedure as of 10 years ago is, um, what? Because if you dont have any, then you are giving opinions (made a mistake) that are woefully uninformed.
957280692919992320 2018-01-27 15:54:37 UTC <Suavebones> @WilDonnelly Yes, facts do matter. This was handled in a textbook HR manner, so saying she made a mistake is wrong and stupid.

957142800893710336 2018-01-26 06:46:41 UTC <Suavebones> @jjz1600 Zogby, seriously ... nobody believes those stats. And Bernie will never be President.
957142220586606592 2018-01-26 06:44:22 UTC <Suavebones> @copperbird7 @VennMultiverse Not entirely sure about that. ICE was hatched by some pretty dark minds.
957091969595035649 2018-01-26 03:24:42 UTC <Suavebones> @Dodge @Chrysler @fiat @amandablount2 Agree with Gordon. Youd do better to criticize meat eaters, who are the reason for all the available leather.
957091122920280064 2018-01-26 03:21:20 UTC <Suavebones> Well, this is interesting.https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/956971746414026753
957089844118867968 2018-01-26 03:16:15 UTC <Suavebones> @MikeLevinCA Eloquent, and to the point.
957083805679984640 2018-01-26 02:52:15 UTC <Suavebones> @DearAuntCrabby Oh, puhleeze. She couldnt care less. Her deal with him was to look good and keep her mouth shut b return for money and a son. Trump has been stepping out on her for two decades.
957082935622062080 2018-01-26 02:48:48 UTC <Suavebones> @YahooNews @wvjoe911 Yeah, a culture involving guns ...
957065075390603266 2018-01-26 01:37:50 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes The word youre looking for is awful.
957013505676402688 2018-01-26 22:12:54 UTC <Suavebones> @HRCpersists K. Thanks.
957013382611243008 2018-01-26 22:12:25 UTC <Suavebones> @WSJ @BlisterPearl No, it was appropriate in the context. I laughed ..
957011567672987653 2018-01-26 22:05:12 UTC <Suavebones> @WSJ @BlisterPearl Yeah, because we all need to die of lung disease to help corporate profits.
957011254157234176 2018-01-26 22:03:58 UTC <Suavebones> @willsommer @SylvanLane Cheer up - some who are angry with you are white.
957008097947594752 2018-01-26 21:51:25 UTC <Suavebones> @StephGrisham45 Oh, you mean like the naked photos with guns, and the girl-on-girl action? That sort of thing?
957007602289913858 2018-01-26 21:49:27 UTC <Suavebones> @HRCpersists Well, yeah, but your next post, unless I missed something, still called it a mistake. It was, in fact, handled in textbook fashion.
957005035568758785 2018-01-26 21:39:15 UTC <Suavebones> @HRCpersists Then how is it a bad mistake?

956582652945096705 2018-01-25 17:40:51 UTC <Suavebones> @magi_jay @21law Lifelong lawyer here, and you are absolutely wrong. Judges -  male judges - have often used stiff and scolding language at sentencing. But *this* is the one you choke on? Misogyny. And her comments provide no basis for appeal, so stop spreading BS.,
956425484463689728 2018-01-24 07:16:19 UTC <Suavebones> @jonathanchait Judges give rough sentencing statements ALL THE TIME. Why did you choose this one to object to? Oh wait ...
956243248242155522 2018-01-24 19:12:11 UTC <Suavebones> @scootser McCabe said he did not vote.
956227579559718912 2018-01-24 18:09:55 UTC <Suavebones> @AstorGoodwin @PalmerReport And once again, you are reporting non-facts. You have zero basis to claim that Bannon (much less Sessions) is cooperating with Mueller. This is sheer speculation on your part. You are the Fox News of the left.

955978385771192320 2018-01-23 01:39:43 UTC <Suavebones> @wvjoe911 Oh, sure. Sophisticated. No doubt the perfect word. Pffftt.
955912860898603010 2018-01-23 21:19:20 UTC <Suavebones> @GovMattBevin You CAN regulate guns so evil doesnt have access to them.
955889781782798341 2018-01-23 19:47:38 UTC <Suavebones> @MetalOllie Massive congratulations! Long road to travel, but fantastic news at the end of it.
955864557762826241 2018-01-23 18:07:24 UTC <Suavebones> @DRUDGE Oh, nonsense. Nobody believes Trump is engaged with anything but Trump.
955623195155030016 2018-01-22 02:08:19 UTC <Suavebones> @windmillcharger Untrue. Schumer got the GOP to stop screwing with CHIP, and Dems are in no worse position today on DACA than they were yesterday.
955622139884982273 2018-01-22 02:04:07 UTC <Suavebones> @CREWcrew Gee. So jealous. If only my Super(wo)man Portfolio contained a multi-billion property failure such as 666 Fifth Ave., or business links that made me look like Im a pawn of the Chinese govt, I could have been lionized in national publications, too.
955609603571638272 2018-01-22 01:14:18 UTC <Suavebones> @DogedogSue Importantly, the Yukon is a *different* country.
955607850423914497 2018-01-22 01:07:20 UTC <Suavebones> @RepTomRice @ashlynbrierre It is neither illegal nor unconstitutional to bar one means of constituent access, such as blocking on Twitter. What Tom Cotton is doing to one constituent, though, probably is both - he is threatening the citizen with legal action if they contact him again *at all.*
955285368844283904 2018-01-21 03:45:54 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @RepSpeier Thank you!!!
955251912319950849 2018-01-21 01:32:58 UTC <Suavebones> @jessesingal @fullerton2817 Nobody is obliged to get citizenship if they have a green card. There is nothing illegal about green card status. You do realize that there are quotas on how many citizens can come from a given country? It can take years, even decades, to clear those lists.
955251208570261504 2018-01-21 01:30:10 UTC <Suavebones> @jessesingal @thefakeTJL @PastryPlate @yourauntemma You seem to think that applying for citizenship is a straightforward and efficient process. Not only can you be deported if the application is denied, but for green card holders from many countries, the wait for available immigration slots from that country can be decades.
955247198442283009 2018-01-21 01:14:14 UTC <Suavebones> @SecNielsen Dreamers are *inadvertent* immigrants who never had a choice, dont know the countries of their origins, dont speak those countries languages, but who in fact contribute to the tax base of *this* country. Some are in the military, or veterans. Stop calling them illegal.
955232446110404608 2018-01-21 00:15:37 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 It is worth mentioning, in tandem with your worthy comments, that the phrase identity politics, as hurled by the GOP, is really just an accusation that Dems take people other than white people into account.
955084389821624320 2018-01-21 14:27:17 UTC <Suavebones> Gotta love this!https://twitter.com/michaelskolnik/status/954836367812513792

955081193489354752 2018-01-21 14:14:35 UTC <Suavebones> @foxmonkey02 @GingerGibson So I guess the deaths of any of the 9 million kids who should have CHIP, but dont, are on Trump. OK.
955074408711892994 2018-01-21 13:47:38 UTC <Suavebones> @GaryTheCynic 404 - reference not found in databank.
955051354732597248 2018-01-21 12:16:01 UTC <Suavebones> @GaryTheCynic I think the insinuation is actually Nikki Haley.
955050781417369600 2018-01-21 12:13:44 UTC <Suavebones> @GaryTheCynic So I accidentally visited Portmeirion, Wales (Prisoner filming location) during an annual Prisoner weekend. Human chess games, strange announcements on the loudspeaker, hordes of people in piped jackets and plimsolls carrying #6 campaign signs, Rover in the bay ... surreal.
955049047605305344 2018-01-21 12:06:51 UTC <Suavebones> Indeed.https://twitter.com/danwlin/status/954716683918331904

The FBI and the FISA court, collectively, are far smarter than Nuness little cadre of Nemo writers. I dont know what info is in this memo, but if it impugns the FISA process, I already know the info is an error or a lie.
954823615941365761 2018-01-20 21:11:04 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Comes down to what you think is essential. I worked in the federal government and things that got shut down in my area included time-sensitive fraud trials and investigations. In other agencies, things shut down are reviews of new medicines, or pesticides, or safety of toys.
954638628852043776 2018-01-20 08:56:00 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Really want men to stop saying nobody likes abortion. Truth is, many, many, many people - women and men - are terribly grateful that its an option.
954637821490466816 2018-01-20 08:52:47 UTC <Suavebones> @NastyClaudia Dad should make her repay it.
954543065452240897 2018-01-19 02:36:16 UTC <Suavebones> @ChrisJZullo No, everybody does *not* want to prevent abortions. Many, many, many of us believe they should be legal, readily obtainable, and without bureaucratic foo-foo. Of course, make birth control widely available. But it also fails ... need to keep abortion available too.
954511327195795457 2018-01-19 00:30:09 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @FoxNews You idiotic pop tart. FOUR PAGES was enough to substantiate multiple and conspiratorial FISA law violations, you say? Four pages is barely adequate to describe the FISA and how it works. This is just a lie, Sean. And you know it.
954510659609419776 2018-01-19 00:27:29 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer Its four pages. I cant describe what I did yesterday in four pages, much less document abuse of a complex law that has ample judicial oversight. But sure ...

954457154144043009 2018-01-19 20:54:53 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport Your rationale for a Trump indictment is by the nature of these things, indictments will be labeled in some kind lockstep, from most impt person to least? Get outta here - they are labeled by whomever gets indicted first. If theres a A, theres zero reason to think its 45.
954455839548628992 2018-01-19 20:49:39 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport Yknow, its just irritating that you are constantly so far out ahead of the known facts. If you want to prognosticate, go ahead and do so under that rubric. But there is something vaguely dishonest about the way you report things as being highly likely, without real facts.
954454655060373506 2018-01-19 20:44:57 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Well, isnt THAT charming? What a loutish oaf.
954450680378548225 2018-01-19 20:29:09 UTC <Suavebones> @GOP @irishgilly @harveybenji Oh, Harvey. Calm down. If your parents had brought you to this country without documentation when you were 1, or 5, or 7, you grew up speaking only English, and lived a hardworking life in America, do you really think it makes sense to deport you when youre 25, 30 or older?
954448599055728640 2018-01-19 20:20:53 UTC <Suavebones> @VAL_MAYNARD @TheRickWilson Get outta here with that both sides shit. This time, the blame is ALL on the GOP.

954185986430439425 2018-01-18 02:57:21 UTC <Suavebones> @SenateMajLdr You lying scumbucket. You know you dont have the R votes.

954184906770468869 2018-01-18 02:53:04 UTC <Suavebones> @MollyJongFast Please give credit where credit is due. Graydon Carter  coined that description.
953719438540492802 2018-01-17 20:03:28 UTC <Suavebones> @funder Since his words dont translate into votes, they are hollow and without vitality.
953716953599889409 2018-01-17 19:53:35 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland @HoffmannRandi @CTwineGirl If its an interview, it is not under oath. But Bannon would still be subject to the laws making it a crime to lie to federal criminal investigators.
953683445644955648 2018-01-17 17:40:26 UTC <Suavebones> @RogueSNRadvisor @sadiesocksjake Um, I do. My blood pressure is fine, even though Im very fat and morbidly sedentary.
953471517005959168 2018-01-16 03:38:18 UTC <Suavebones> @AHamiltonSpirit No. They lied by 100 pounds so that he would not be *morbidly* obese.
953471188059279360 2018-01-16 03:37:00 UTC <Suavebones> 320, minimum.https://twitter.com/edkrassen/status/953387134966263809
953465504408236032 2018-01-16 03:14:25 UTC <Suavebones> @waltshaub @occamsrazor45 @copperbird7 Its just horrifying. I feel the same way I did when I watched the WTC towers fall - only this time its democracy.
953464494994395136 2018-01-16 03:10:24 UTC <Suavebones> @allinwithchris @chrislhayes @Submarine_Guy Let me say this. I am a 58 woman who (unfortunately) weighs well north of 250, so I have a good frame of reference. I call Trumps weight at a bare minimum of 320.
953463796131123201 2018-01-16 03:07:38 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Haiti may well be, in the main, a shithole. Even if true, it only enhances our need to accept Haitians into this country. Poverty and poor infrastructure are NOT disqualifying factors for immigration, nor do they taint - in any way - Haitian citizens who live with those burdens.
953461851626655744 2018-01-16 02:59:54 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @jrbaltmd57 @dbarcon Agreed, in every particular.
953459918824144896 2018-01-16 02:52:13 UTC <Suavebones> @occamsrazor45 @waltshaub @copperbird7 Thing is, he doesnt get to hang around pondering Exec Privilege. Either he invokes it or he doesnt. Except, of course, when you he has a lapdog Congress.
953372112512790528 2018-01-16 21:03:19 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump If he isnt 280 at a minimum, Ill change my voter registration to GOP!
953326573985370114 2018-01-16 18:02:21 UTC <Suavebones> @sadydoyle While youre pondering, ponder this: in what world are we saying that women with agency cant just get up and leave an uncomfortable situation where theres no threat or power issue in play? This whole story reeks because she didnt leave.
953325628572487681 2018-01-16 17:58:36 UTC <Suavebones> @ZerlinaMaxwell And the woman could have stood up and left. This particular charge is just bs. He wasnt holding her captive.
953316383361822720 2018-01-16 17:21:52 UTC <Suavebones> Shithole or shithouse?   Either way, Trump is being a complete asshouse who maybe, just maybe, doesnt belong in the White Hole.  Thank you, Stephen Colbert!
953062679220031491 2018-01-15 00:33:44 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump You are a stone liar. The nation knows this.
953062398927269889 2018-01-15 00:32:37 UTC <Suavebones> @ProgressVoice This guy was slightly too old to be a dreamer. All people his age who were brought to this country as children by undocumented parents are vulnerable.
953061944080195594 2018-01-15 00:30:49 UTC <Suavebones> @ICEgov @TerraMarQue Absolutely no problem is being solved here. It is cruelty for crueltys sake.

952991948847173632 2018-01-15 19:52:40 UTC <Suavebones> @LawyerRogelio This statement is, truly, the essence of the nightmare. What 45 has revealed to us is how many of our fellow citizens are unalloyed, unrepentant racists.

952618779959324672 2018-01-14 19:09:50 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost All liars in power are a grave danger to our nation. Unfortunately, the lying virus seems to have engulfed the GOP.
952543041780412417 2018-01-14 14:08:53 UTC <Suavebones> @_A__Dub A shit show means an organization or government is coming to pieces, and he was being critical not of the country (Libya), but of the U.K., which he said was not doing its part to keep the wheels on. Trump, by contrast, commented on poverty and low SOL to impugn immigrants.
952444339229257728 2018-01-13 07:36:40 UTC <Suavebones> @goodoldcatchy Powervomit - a useful term. Thank you.
952443990724481024 2018-01-13 07:35:17 UTC <Suavebones> Funniest tweet Ive read this year. My only regret from my years of govt service is that I didnt get to work with the smart, hilarious and highly principled Walter Shaub.https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/952312927549259776
952442597439688704 2018-01-13 07:29:45 UTC <Suavebones> @waltshaub As always, I love you, Walter Shaub.

952432776460099584 2018-01-13 06:50:43 UTC <Suavebones> @amandablount2 @nazani14 What a shame. Its so hard to say goodbye to old, dear friends. My sympathies to you both.

952205114818908160 2018-01-13 15:46:05 UTC <Suavebones> @krassenstein Stop looking past the obvious. They are silent because they AGREE with him. They are exactly as deplorable as Hillary said.
952204649377001473 2018-01-13 15:44:14 UTC <Suavebones> @jaydee4673 And as usual, they cant spell, notes this 13th generation American who actually bothered to learn her own language.
951923856704528385 2018-01-12 21:08:27 UTC <Suavebones> Yeah, Cotton and Perdue do not recall. Kind of the way Jeff Sessions could not recall numerous damning things. Must be sumpin in the Senates water ...https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/951878844289609730
951922972712996865 2018-01-12 21:04:57 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh Fucking liars.
951922842584698881 2018-01-12 21:04:26 UTC <Suavebones> @krassenstein Note that NOT ONE OF THEM has *denies* 45 said it. In addition, one (Durbin) has confirmed it directly, and at least one other (Graham) has confirmed it to third parties.
951922373753802758 2018-01-12 21:02:34 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh Um, maybe be even a little less vague?

951917298301927426 2018-01-12 20:42:24 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @Scaramucci The word shithole is not the problem. It is the questioning of why the US would accept people from poor countries (mostly brown/black people) into this country. Emma Lazaruss poem on the Statue of Liberty answers Trumps question. That he even asked it is PURE RACISM.
951861584531476480 2018-01-12 17:01:01 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Arpaio, an impressively stupid man, might actually be smarter than Trump, though thats pretty much a worlds tallest midget contest.
951860558843863040 2018-01-12 16:56:56 UTC <Suavebones> @_A__Dub Yknow, some countries are terribly poor and have awful standards of living. A few might be unkindly characterized as shitholes for that reason. The word is not whats wrong; what is sick is the implication that the people trying to escape do not deserve to live in the US.
951855281083953154 2018-01-12 16:35:58 UTC <Suavebones> @lewru7 You may well be right. I dont doubt any horrifying possibility these days.
951714633508950016 2018-01-11 07:17:05 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @In3ago Never happened.
951710726544125954 2018-01-11 07:01:33 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @kurteichenwald @pwalkerbooks Wrong. Norway is very open.
951709996856872960 2018-01-11 06:58:39 UTC <Suavebones> @ezlusztig Goodnight, Mr. Lusztig. I share your fury and frustration.
951708239497957376 2018-01-11 06:51:40 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @JackPosobiec Is any word out of your mouth worth hearing? Even just a single word? No, I thought not.
951707556308713472 2018-01-11 06:48:57 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @CoreyLMJones Are you high? Do you have any clue how far the USs reputation has fallen in the last year? We are now the laughing stock of the world.
951705866662707200 2018-01-11 06:42:15 UTC <Suavebones> @lewru7 Evidence. Its, you know, science-y, and therefore improper.
951671040928862209 2018-01-11 04:23:52 UTC <Suavebones> @KarenAttiah My mother just could not understand why I took various courses in African politics and societies in college. I told her white people needed to understand as much about Africa as they possibly could, because Africans and their descendants will eventually lead the world.

951668645696081927 2018-01-11 04:14:20 UTC <Suavebones> @johnpavlovitz OVERWHELMINGLY a pigmentation issue ...
951668515697840128 2018-01-11 04:13:49 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 That he did.
951636617147674624 2018-01-11 02:07:04 UTC <Suavebones> Well, exactly.https://twitter.com/jamesmartinsj/status/951587131650117632
951605058046779394 2018-01-11 00:01:40 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @voxdotcom @cjane87 @umanoid Yeah. But hes still pretty churlish about liberalism, despite the fact that he appears to be slipping, perhaps helplessly, in that direction.
951603674652008448 2018-01-11 23:56:10 UTC <Suavebones> @azcentral CNN had the word shithole on its chyron. I think you can spell out the word.

951553379146313728 2018-01-11 20:36:19 UTC <Suavebones> @jaketapper Lord help us. Any deal cooked up by that faction will be horrible.

951540288329273344 2018-01-11 19:44:18 UTC <Suavebones> @embeedub Ahem. May I just roll that same comment back to Boomer feminists, who get very little love from subsequent generations?
951538368848023552 2018-01-11 19:36:40 UTC <Suavebones> @Susan_Hennessey @benjaminwittes He is just unimaginably stupid. I met him (and Fred) in the early 80s in the context of a clients business transaction. I didnt think he was very smart then, and saw nothing that changed my mind in subsequent years. But honestly, I just didnt realize he was/is a blockhead.
951535754026606592 2018-01-11 19:26:17 UTC <Suavebones> @shannonrwatts @MattMurph24 Ouch, really? The right really is just unforgivable, no matter how anti-Trump they are now.
951509161011015680 2018-01-11 17:40:36 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Whats odd in that reaction is that the mudslides happened in uber-wealthy Montecito, a hotbed of Fox enthusiasts.
951488825536237568 2018-01-11 16:19:48 UTC <Suavebones> Why cant MSM launch a daily feature calling out the blatant lies in Trumps tweets? He needs to be called out on every single falsehood he tells, in a systematic, public fashion.
951477319042060288 2018-01-11 15:34:05 UTC <Suavebones> @RepMarkMeadows Why are you lying?
951475466946441216 2018-01-11 15:26:43 UTC <Suavebones> @ananavarro Nonononono ... Arizona *always* knew who he was, and *liked him* for his cruel, bullying and illegal tactics. He was re-elected Sheriff of AZs largest population center time after time. Please, everyone, understand that AZ is very likely to *elect* this jerk.

951341571517157376 2018-01-10 06:34:40 UTC <Suavebones> @cpujudy In fairness, he never said he had an MBA. He has an Undergrad degree from Wharton. Yes, its a thing.
951297679556038658 2018-01-10 03:40:15 UTC <Suavebones> @GaryTheCynic He will never serve a day in prison, sadly. He will litigate and appeal everything until he dies, rage-tweeting, on the golden throne in Trump Tower.
951296116154396674 2018-01-10 03:34:02 UTC <Suavebones> @RealSheriffJoe @CNN @RichVisotcky @thebeadingnana Chances are, hell win. Maricopa County, AZs biggest population center, re-elected him Sheriff repeatedly, despite his proven torture, law-breaking, bigotry and cruelty. They like him here in AZ, sadly.
951295363251625985 2018-01-10 03:31:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Gon_Ride Seth Abrahamson blocked me because I pointed out his legal error in saying that joint defense agreements are rare.
951136625081421826 2018-01-10 17:00:17 UTC <Suavebones> @_ElizabethMay I dunno. Benghazi runs a very close second.
951134853017358336 2018-01-10 16:53:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesPKrehbiel1 Questioned by MSM is appropriate reporting protocol. Enamored of Fusion-GPS testimony? Also appropriate - this is the sworn evidence that supports the legitimacy of the dossier.
951128033196412929 2018-01-10 16:26:08 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Hilarious - you think someone actually *believes* you?

951123818248069123 2018-01-10 16:09:23 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM Now theres some good news. One less convicted felon in power.
951123568737300480 2018-01-10 16:08:24 UTC <Suavebones> @_A__Dub Sadly, his campaign has a good chance of succeeding. I live in AZ and watched in horror as he was re-elected as Sheriff time after time, despite everyones knowing of his cruelty, law-breaking, grandstanding, etc. He is AZs favorite racist uncle.
950980714325073920 2018-01-09 06:40:45 UTC <Suavebones> @aroseblush Hahahaha! Please, please - waste your money and youre filing bogus lawsuits.

950805623880454145 2018-01-09 19:05:00 UTC <Suavebones> @EdKrassen @ron_humphrey Oddly, theres no law barring felons from running for federal office, which is why weve got Darrell Issa, among others.
950779522852491264 2018-01-09 17:21:17 UTC <Suavebones> @RepSinema @kyrstensinema @RedTRaccoon Its so infuriating. Sinema is my Representative, and is a DINO. The idea that my Senate choice will come down to her or Arpaio is literally sickening.

950465608805769217 2018-01-08 20:33:54 UTC <Suavebones> @ReasonVsFear I get the reference. Your prohibition is overly broad.
950464375990648832 2018-01-08 20:29:00 UTC <Suavebones> @DaShanneStokes Dont set the bar so low. Just because Oprah is coherent doesnt mean shes a particularly good candidate. I mean, if it comes down to Trump vs. Oprah, Id vote for Oprah. But I would prefer a more knowledgeable politician. Say, Kamala Harris.
950441056205668352 2018-01-08 18:56:20 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryWarnedUs That would be a vomitacious alternative. Oprah is a talk show celebrity, not a politician, philosopher or the Oracle at Delphi. Her aperus are fine at the GGs, but I really dont want my days filled with her middle-intellect ramblings.
950440028609630208 2018-01-08 18:52:15 UTC <Suavebones> @ReasonVsFear And why cant one say that? Arent some black women more qualified than others to hold office? Wouldnt politician Kamala Harris be a better Presidential choice than media star/political neophyte Oprah Winfrey? Stop treating attempts at distinguishing between people as racism.

949235756614086656 2018-01-05 11:06:54 UTC <Suavebones> @nytmike @1stAmendmentJ Agreed. I know Uttam slightly - despise his politics, but hes a notably bright attorney.
949084207363473409 2018-01-04 01:04:42 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh I went to college with Wolff. Hes a damned sight more trustworthy than Trump.

948232194312495104 2018-01-02 16:39:07 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport @_A__Dub Yeah, but theres a big difference between reporting facts and prognosticating. Just wishing he would work harder at the former.

948149473452032000 2018-01-02 11:10:24 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport @_A__Dub Case in point: this click-bait headline isnt even supported by Palmers own article, much less the available facts.
948148622893367296 2018-01-02 11:07:02 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport @_A__Dub Yknow, the Palmer Report ultimately may wind up being correct, but its speculation is so far ahead of the available factual evidence - every time - that its hard to take seriously. I wish Palmer and his ilk were more factually rigorous.

Of course, many argue that this has been Trumps pathology his whole life - that reality is only what he thinks it is. In which case, its not dementia, but longstanding mental illness.
947580980130299904 2017-12-31 21:31:25 UTC <Suavebones> @PerkinsonForMO There is no war on police. There is a profligate use of guns by everyone in this gun-crazed society, which makes the killing of police by civilians, as well as the wrongful killing of civilians by police, far more likely.  Saldly for all.

947045398157303808 2017-12-30 10:03:12 UTC <Suavebones> @yashar What @Yashar needs to understand is that if interviewers dont confront the lies of an interviewee in person, they are morally obligated to note them in the write-up. Otherwise, the reporter and paper are just conduits for the lies.
947035721486934016 2017-12-30 09:24:45 UTC <Suavebones> @ByronTau Byron, if a reporter is going to let an interview subject lie his head off unchallenged, then the outlet publishing the interview OWES IT TO THE PUBLIC to call out the lies in the article or a companion piece. O/w, the reporter and the paper become willing conduits for the lies.

946550829942579200 2017-12-28 01:17:58 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @MarkRichardWeis Im going to do the same thing youre going to do - die of asphyxiation. Meanwhile, America is far from a clean country, as anyone who studies these things knows.
946550452832759808 2017-12-28 01:16:28 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @MarkRichardWeis The question is not whether the climate changes - its whether human activity contributes so much burden to climate change it actually alters the climate. Scientists have proven - overwhelmingly - that it does so. We must radically reduce emissions.
946549327337607168 2017-12-28 01:12:00 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @BrendaPurington I have people? Thats encouraging. As for sarcasm, the Oaf-in-Chief literally doesnt know the meaning of it, much less how to deploy it to make a point. And you know it, too.
946548815397511168 2017-12-28 01:09:58 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @wmmII88 And your education in this field is - what, exactly?
946548612045053952 2017-12-28 01:09:09 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @inxs555 Gee, really? And do you suppose human activity in the way of pollution might have an affect on climate? Spoilers: endless scientific studies proves it does.
946536147265642501 2017-12-28 00:19:37 UTC <Suavebones> @brianbeutler Oh, please, do not do them the dignity of calling it sophistry when it is better understood as stone lies.

946533462239879168 2017-12-28 00:08:57 UTC <Suavebones> Can you actually be so ignorant, @realDonaldTrump, as to think that this weeks weather has even a single thing to do with overall climate trends?

943165463533469696 2017-12-19 17:05:44 UTC <Suavebones> @Mel_Ankoly @themumzilla @nlmtys His comment was not an effort to provide an accurate representation of her work. It was an observation that, as with all authors, some of her work reflects aspects of her real life. Stop over-egging the pudding.
943161632502329344 2017-12-19 16:50:30 UTC <Suavebones> @Mel_Ankoly @nlmtys @themumzilla Your reading skills could use a brush-up. Mel did not dismiss Austen as a romance writer. He noted, quite correctly, that she has written about romance. That is fact, not an accusation.
943118051150413825 2017-12-19 13:57:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Mel_Ankoly @themumzilla Uh, I think you missed the entire point, Mumz.

There is something wrong with women who cant acknowledge his point - that some sexual misconduct is trivial and doesnt deserve to be treated like rape, showing your dick, or pressuring underlings.
942125752199168000 2017-12-16 20:14:17 UTC <Suavebones> @grandoftwo @charliearchy I blocked her. She is a witless blatherer.
942125527766204416 2017-12-16 20:13:24 UTC <Suavebones> @charliearchy @evenchick @Wilson__Valdez Oh, HELL no. She is the far progressive left that cozies up to Libertarians and the far right.
942124575214546944 2017-12-16 20:09:37 UTC <Suavebones> @vulture @Erinindc No form of sexual harassment or assault is good, but some of it is definitely less harmful and more overlookable than others. Damon knows guys who have assaulted women, though he probably hasnt done it himself. Whats he supposed to do? Never speak to Ben Affleck again?
942122186059300864 2017-12-16 20:00:07 UTC <Suavebones> @WeeeeeSquirrel @RoseResists214 We welcome you here in the resistance. A lot of people have similar stories of gradual awakening to all the poisonous lies we are fed in our lives, and I am grateful for each person, including you, who makes the brave decision to walk away from long-held ideas. Thank you.
942120875888844800 2017-12-16 19:54:55 UTC <Suavebones> Oh, I know. Im just trying to stifle the flames.

941976391242825729 2017-12-16 10:20:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent I agree with Damon. The hysteria that boiled over into calling touching my waist during a photograph a form of sexual harassment is helpful to nobody.

941139078241665024 2017-12-13 02:53:36 UTC <Suavebones> @IngrahamAngle @mmbarricelli Did I miss something? Is there even a *particle* of evidence that Peter Strzok *acted* inappropriately in light of his political views? After all, Ken Starr was a double-dyed conservative investigating a Dem President. Everyone assumed he would be dutiful, not biased.
941138510135705600 2017-12-13 02:51:20 UTC <Suavebones> @IngrahamAngle Aggressively vetting his staff? You mean, to find political eunuchs with no opinions? Theyre like unicorns - they dont exist. What *does* exist are hundreds of thousands of government employees who do their jobs, often *in spite of* their personal opinions.

939265142197383168 2017-12-08 22:47:15 UTC <Suavebones> @NomikiKonst @AfroRumi Now theres two treacherous women I dont want to hear from.
939264896520167424 2017-12-08 22:46:16 UTC <Suavebones> @NomikiKonst You are NOT half of the DNC.
939221938588676096 2017-12-08 19:55:34 UTC <Suavebones> @scjessey And yet, it is not a Christmas movie, which requires at least some degree of Yuletide cheer, some cute kids singing and a happy ending that doesnt invoke grotesque violence or killing Alan Rickman.
939206273408516096 2017-12-08 18:53:19 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 @code_name_v I find money much easier to breathe (the larger the bills, the better).
939205684058497024 2017-12-08 18:50:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Tracydwyer7 @NBCNightlyNews Good riddance.
939205095417290752 2017-12-08 18:48:38 UTC <Suavebones> @scjessey Movies at Christmas do not necessarily  Christmas movies make. (Disagreeing with you here ... .)
939191818721226752 2017-12-08 17:55:53 UTC <Suavebones> @noshamehereforI @SenSanders T is for tepid.
939191569529192448 2017-12-08 17:54:54 UTC <Suavebones> @LindseyGrahamSC You really have no shame at all, do you?
939155157513678848 2017-12-08 15:30:12 UTC <Suavebones> @snorfel1 @DMRDynamics I am not Jewish, but am increasingly frightened on Jews behalf about whats happening in this country.
939154652154626049 2017-12-08 15:28:12 UTC <Suavebones> @ndrew_lawrence W the AF?
939147428711694336 2017-12-08 14:59:30 UTC <Suavebones> @appalledvoter @biannagolodryga Because defrauding customers is what Big Banking is all about.
939117484430344192 2017-12-08 13:00:30 UTC <Suavebones> @rhonda_harbison Wishing you loads of strength for a speedy recovery!
939091292834770944 2017-12-08 11:16:26 UTC <Suavebones> @KimmyMonte @TheStacyWay @darnold64 I keep wondering why, exactly, they are sending these dick pics? Do they really think women are gonna say, yeah, must get me some of that?
938970115537747968 2017-12-07 03:14:55 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @GSarafan And I think it was an absurdly stupid move. Lets hope youre right.
938966300956622848 2017-12-07 02:59:45 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @GSarafan *vote
938966199559323648 2017-12-07 02:59:21 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @GSarafan Sure I can deny politics here. For instance, I loathe Trent Frank, but, based on what weve heard so far, I see no reason for him to resign. Legislators engage in a lot of obnoxious behavior. Its the purview of their constituents to  em out if they get too squiggly.
938962684988375040 2017-12-07 02:45:23 UTC <Suavebones> @grubear23 Its an ageist claim.
938962499579232262 2017-12-07 02:44:39 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @GSarafan But this did *not* happen in the Senate, which would be, I agree, a very different thing. With Franken, the claims arose on USO tours, where, I am here to tell you, everyone is drunk as a skunk. Obnoxious behavior - sure. Worthy of being scuttled from the Senate - no.
938958234676879360 2017-12-07 02:27:42 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @GSarafan Im saying that minor sexual harassment is not a reason to resign from a position to which thousands elected you. Im not kidding - I am old now, as a young lawyer, I endured sexual assaults and other harassment from colleagues, superiors, clients. Grab-ass is trivial in the arc.
938957065048834048 2017-12-07 02:23:03 UTC <Suavebones> @windmillcharger @tonyposnanski Or have never, ever watched Hannity to begin with ... .
938955201498583041 2017-12-07 02:15:39 UTC <Suavebones> @grubear23 Im an old person of Trumps generation who spent a lifetime in a dental chair. My moms generation got dentures. By the time 45 and I came along, the dental philosophy was save every tooth. Unless someone or something actually knocked his teeth out, he d/n have dentures.
938954443403403265 2017-12-07 02:12:38 UTC <Suavebones> I think this sums it up nicely.https://twitter.com/gsarafan/status/938910700709302272
938953993270652928 2017-12-07 02:10:51 UTC <Suavebones> @rgay @TXrunnerSteph And those suffragettes (and many others) neednt have bothered putting their lives in danger, cuz men were going to shower manna from man-heaven anyway ....
938952401448402944 2017-12-07 02:04:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Kat4Obama @TopherSpiro Ask him how the absolute fuck he voted for this scrofulous bill.
938951907858464769 2017-12-07 02:02:34 UTC <Suavebones> @rgay @Leafmalone You made my day!
938951597702365184 2017-12-07 02:01:20 UTC <Suavebones> @rgay @TXrunnerSteph Gave. Like a present. Right.
938951123045511174 2017-12-07 01:59:27 UTC <Suavebones> @Olivianuzzi @jbarro Note that, if you plan to have the AG of NY unload on Flynn with RICO counts, you keep your federal charges simple. And you dont think, even for a nanosecond, that you have thought this through as carefully as Bob Mueller and his stable of prize lawyers?
938949984023601152 2017-12-07 01:54:55 UTC <Suavebones> @grubear23 There is no freakin way Trump has dentures. They belong to a generation older than he. He has implants, veneers, and possibly bridges, but there is simply no chance in hell he has dentures.
938907531027431424 2017-12-07 23:06:14 UTC <Suavebones> @alfranken @SenateMajLdr @a2mech2000_k @DearAuntCrabby You mean it *was* time. Too freakin late now. These Dem female Senators really know how to chop off their noses to spite their faces, dont they?? Grrrrrrrr.
938906477518929921 2017-12-07 23:02:02 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost Oh, sweet day! Please let it be sexual indiscretions so I can confirm my suspicion that he is a flaming hypocrite.
938839152321224704 2017-12-07 18:34:31 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @vickscan @cag113 Agreed. And #MeToo, repeatedly.
938838931474300928 2017-12-07 18:33:38 UTC <Suavebones> @ChrisJansing @ckn4502 How about the woman who said Franken grabbed her waist during a photo shot? Oh, the horror.
938838175740411904 2017-12-07 18:30:38 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @vickscan @cag113 Me too.
938836367991177216 2017-12-07 18:23:27 UTC <Suavebones> @Anti_DJTrump Ive been saying it for days. The COMPLETE INABILITY of Dems to see degrees of behavior is inexplicable to me.
938835739076214784 2017-12-07 18:20:57 UTC <Suavebones> @mcp_pol @RVAwonk OK. I am specifically here to denigrate the woman who complained that he grabbed her around the waist during a photo. If this is the sort of shit we are calling sexual harassment or sexual abuse, Im done with all of you.
938775241391607813 2017-12-07 14:20:33 UTC <Suavebones> @WCVB @SwanWhisperr Abhorrent.
938774325187899392 2017-12-07 14:16:55 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Eggs-ackly.
938773800698634241 2017-12-07 14:14:50 UTC <Suavebones> @PaulWartenberg Funniest thing Ive read this week!
938772257010102272 2017-12-07 14:08:42 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @MsDsSciLeague Agree completely with Ms. Dickerson.
938767575860703232 2017-12-07 13:50:06 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @LHudson @hitchensatheist Gag photo, not touching her, photographer confirmed, read the news already, sheesh.
938661181673283584 2017-12-06 06:47:19 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken @LHudson I spoke from my personal experience, not as an arbiter for all women. You must be some crummy lawyer if you dont understand the difference.
938630506278617088 2017-12-06 04:45:26 UTC <Suavebones> @ezraklein Fuck you, Ezra. Nothing Al Franken has allegedly done warrants resignation. Did he whip out his dick? Molest a child? Rape someone? Abuse a position of piwer to force sex on an underling? No - some wet kisses and grab-ass are obnoxious, not criminal or career-ending.
938580261779804160 2017-12-06 01:25:47 UTC <Suavebones> @scifiction1 @shannonrwatts Kind of like AZ.
938579986151194624 2017-12-06 01:24:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Mikel_Jollett Wrong. I have worked with gropers and forced-kissers all my life. You rebuke them and move on.
938578476407197696 2017-12-06 01:18:41 UTC <Suavebones> @CahnEmily @yashar @danibostick Gee. One.
938575844326350848 2017-12-06 01:08:13 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @alfranken @katgal2 @DearAuntCrabby @NicoletteDalto4 Lets say accusations against Franken are true. At worst, theyre obnoxious and presumptuous, but not criminal, or even uncommon. He did not molest minors, rape anyone, display his genitals or pressure underlings for sex. Cant we separate tuly bad conduct from merely annoying?
938574301153783809 2017-12-06 01:02:05 UTC <Suavebones> @JJManring Lmao
938545826732785676 2017-12-06 23:08:57 UTC <Suavebones> @SenFranken DONT RESIGN!! Im a woman who has been both sexually harassed and assaulted, and I think nothing you are accused of warrants resignation, even if its ALL true. Stay the course - please.
938544951754874881 2017-12-06 23:05:28 UTC <Suavebones> @MtnMD @MO_Outlaw41 Bullshit. Mild, non-criminal harassment should be called out, but not lumped together with crimes, or punished harshly.
938507855136571392 2017-12-06 20:38:03 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Theres a dead man walking.
938507439376285696 2017-12-06 20:36:24 UTC <Suavebones> @NormEisen Whole point of ethics is to distinguish between when behavior shocks the conscience (rape, child molestation, pressuring employees for sex, showing your genitals, e.g.) and when it is troubling but relatively minor (kisses; ass grabbing).
938467012975632384 2017-12-06 17:55:46 UTC <Suavebones> @InSpiteOfTrump Nice of him. Oh, and also the First Amendment ...
938466772369399808 2017-12-06 17:54:49 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Hes my Senator (for now) and makes me grind my teeth to bloody stumps with his faux-righteousness.
938466161032773633 2017-12-06 17:52:23 UTC <Suavebones> @rhonda_harbison @zeynep Abso-freakin-lately agree.
938465749370257408 2017-12-06 17:50:45 UTC <Suavebones> @isteintraum Can we freakin wait until his investigation is done, at least? And can we agree that kissing people and grabbing their butts, while not honorable, is not remotely the same as showing your dick or pressuring underlings for sex or molesting little girls? Proportional response pls.
938462264230756352 2017-12-06 17:36:54 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSanders @BernieSanders @evepeyser @VICE @Maggyw519 @femalep What is unlimited, Alex?
938442293954035712 2017-12-06 16:17:32 UTC <Suavebones> @perlmutations I love you, Ron, but you are stone cold wrong about this one. The opportunities to call out celebrities in public, where they are not surrounded by staff or their claque, are few and far between. Bravo to John Oliver for seeing this rare opportunity and making the most of it.
938260422704054272 2017-12-05 04:14:51 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH @drg9674 Front facing cameras ...
938232316500914176 2017-12-05 02:23:10 UTC <Suavebones> @VaughnHillyard Why should anyone give a f*ck what Brannon thinks or says about Flake?
938231267174182912 2017-12-05 02:19:00 UTC <Suavebones> @InSpiteOfTrump @kylegriffin1 Imagine the GOP response if Dems crafted a bill and crowed about its being death to the GOP.
938225599205670912 2017-12-05 01:56:28 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH @saynepsycho We grocery shop together, agree easily about meals, have a cleaning person to do the toilets, have no kids, and simply get along famously. Nobody meek here, but in fact two very similar people ...
938197554839175168 2017-12-05 00:05:02 UTC <Suavebones> @realBigBalls That, plus hormones ... . Pregnancy and post-pregnancy hormone levels have a huge amount to do with postpartum depression, and those levels can be adjusted by medication after the baby comes. Seek help immediately - I went from crying helplessly to feeling better within two weeks
938195283900370946 2017-12-05 23:56:01 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH @saynepsycho Nope. I just chose the right person. My wife is as smart, feisty and opinionated as I am - but in all the same ways.
938194696744058880 2017-12-05 23:53:41 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH @saynepsycho @OralHatch Wife. And she sure the hell is not.
938192233223790592 2017-12-05 23:43:53 UTC <Suavebones> @BenHowe You dodge the obligations before you.
938191928989847552 2017-12-05 23:42:41 UTC <Suavebones> @BenHowe A complete cop-out. If there are two choices and one of them will definitely win, its a cop-out intellectually, morally and ethically  to refuse to pick a side.
938190841755004928 2017-12-05 23:38:22 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH No worries. But I am serious about the agreement/disagreement thing, at least as it regards politics. I believe ones politics directly reflect ones ethics, morals and intellectual acumen, all of which are called into question if we disagree.
938189865757302784 2017-12-05 23:34:29 UTC <Suavebones> @EdKrassen @JoAnnaKrumbine It means the new indictment supersedes the old one. The new indictment will probably contain the original charges plus some new ones. Sometimes, though, a new charge is substituted for an old one that is being dropped. Or, a new indictment can merely correct errors in the old.
938187705610936320 2017-12-05 23:25:54 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH Wife. And as I said, we never disagree on important stuff.
938186526621548544 2017-12-05 23:21:13 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH Still beg to differ. I *am* polarized, and so is most of the rest of the world. Congratulations on heroic fortitude if you have managed to avoid it.
938185864546369537 2017-12-05 23:18:35 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @jdice03 Why does he keep equating stock market gains to more jobs? There is not even any correlation, much less causal relationship.
938185400287240192 2017-12-05 23:16:44 UTC <Suavebones> @3L3V3NTH Beg to differ. I married the right person, because we never disagree about anything important. Makes life SO much pleasanter.
938182770592948225 2017-12-05 23:06:17 UTC <Suavebones> @RepAdamSchiff @DarylynnM Hillary was right - a basket of deplorables.
938179878808981504 2017-12-05 22:54:48 UTC <Suavebones> @realBigBalls May assume facts not in evidence - that any good people still exist in Alabama.
938179308689899520 2017-12-05 22:52:32 UTC <Suavebones> @GenFlynn @thepoliticalcat A true patriot does not try to plan an extra-judicial kidnapping for $15 million in personal gain, nor lie to the FBI when they asked about his Russia conversations. Oh, by the way, WHY did he lie? Stay tuned to Radio Mueller to see what your true patriot was *really* up to.
938178310315458561 2017-12-05 22:48:34 UTC <Suavebones> @JeffFlake Well, now. If you could just extend this gesture to the HORRIBLE TAX BILL, this AZ constituent could feel good about you again.
938116764134604800 2017-12-05 18:44:00 UTC <Suavebones> @EtonOldBoys And a very Happy Christmas to you, Mr Oldboys, and to all the little, affiliated, and tertiary Oldboyses! Love the guitar.
938086630140739584 2017-12-05 16:44:16 UTC <Suavebones> @SocialPowerOne1 Gee, if only (i) the Deep State existed, and (ii) would do so.
938056566334308352 2017-12-05 14:44:48 UTC <Suavebones> @paleofuture Janet Porter - one of the worlds prime fountainheads of utter bullsh*t.

937472777027706880 2017-12-03 00:05:02 UTC <Suavebones> @GovHowardDean @ImSthrnYall @ellewilson Nope. Ill sit out. Bernie would be as big a catastrophe as Trump, especially if he did not get a Dem Congress.
937472397946511360 2017-12-03 00:03:31 UTC <Suavebones> @GovHowardDean @elsrbrown @ellewilson Oh, hell no. He doesnt give two rat f*cks about women and children, or havent you noticed?
937470965826519040 2017-12-03 23:57:50 UTC <Suavebones> @ngaines13 @plante Same with Boomers. We worked all our lives, putting money towards a Medicare and Social Security, only to see this tax bill depend on funding that can only come from a raid on those sources.
937469951555682304 2017-12-03 23:53:48 UTC <Suavebones> @SteveBellovin @DickKingSmith My cat could swim like blazes.
937464400746655745 2017-12-03 23:31:45 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu No smart-as-a-whip lawyer would go on TV and lie outright for Trump.
937446939813076992 2017-12-03 22:22:22 UTC <Suavebones> @sadydoyle And ... thats exactly why it is giving you agita.
937423950971224064 2017-12-03 20:51:01 UTC <Suavebones> @NatashaBertrand @waltshaub @emills28 If you say it and youre not under duress from the person who drafted the words (i.e., no lawyers gun to your head and no child kidnapped by lawyer threatening torture), then if you say it, you own it.
937397019802398721 2017-12-03 19:04:00 UTC <Suavebones> @stewartbaker @Susan_Hennessey @jacklgoldsmith Oh, ffs. NOBODY has ever been successfully prosecuted under the Logan Act in 219 years. *Please* stop talking about the Logan Act.
937385622246866945 2017-12-03 18:18:42 UTC <Suavebones> @NormOrnstein @MarkSalter55 Um, with no respect whatsoever, your statement is pure, unadulterated bullsh*t.
937385059685765120 2017-12-03 18:16:28 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki Of all the many, many, many disgusting things about 45, I think what he eats barely even makes the list.
937365659796639744 2017-12-03 16:59:23 UTC <Suavebones> @Evan_McMullin @AltHomelandSec Having been, among other things, a defense lawyer, I am fully aware of the optics here.  Just saying that the rush to judgment about the agent - solely because he has a political opinion and not because of his wrongdoing - makes me slightly crazy.
937358298214363141 2017-12-03 16:30:08 UTC <Suavebones> @jonfavs @Ford_Prefection @heybramson In my day (late 70s), we barely had photocopiers.
937358084329967616 2017-12-03 16:29:17 UTC <Suavebones> @jonfavs @danibostick @chicagokristi A font-snob. Got it.
937357429435543553 2017-12-03 16:26:41 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @SLSmith000 Yeah, because no career federal employee has ever had a political opinion that s/he damped down in order to do the job in an impartial way. Pfftt.
937356508093849601 2017-12-03 16:23:01 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 Gentle suggestion: then dont.
937356173551878144 2017-12-03 16:21:41 UTC <Suavebones> @senorrinhatch @jaydee4673 @spunkkee He has said, unofficially, that he wont run again next year. Mitt Romney wants his seat, and is projected to win it.
937354896675807237 2017-12-03 16:16:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Evan_McMullin @AltHomelandSec You may well be right. But it is a travesty that everyone pretends career employees are political castrati. They are not, and never will be. The issue is not what the agent thinks, but whether his views contaminated his investigations. He was fired before that could be determined

937352949969203200 2017-12-03 16:08:53 UTC <Suavebones> @AltHomelandSec @Evan_McMullin Every career federal employee has a political party and political preferences. Nevertheless, they are asked to do their jobs in support of whatever administration is directing their activity, and they do so. My guess is that the FBI agent will fight his ouster, and win.
937351653656690688 2017-12-03 16:03:44 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @FareedZakaria @MaxBoot @CarlosLozadaWP Just a shame he spent so many years supporting the GOPs increasingly successful quest to become a fascist state.
937350663469592577 2017-12-03 15:59:47 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesRHarrisSr Oh, youre a racist, too? Texas resident - should have guessed.

I have also read the doomsday interpretations of the agenda. I stand by my conclusion: only someone batsh*t crazy could twist its interpretation to mean what you said.

937194429735038976 2017-12-02 05:38:58 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesRHarrisSr Mmm ... pathetically ignorant, says the man who thinks, for some baroque reason, that the UN is taking over the US to populate it with Muslims. Sure.

936793186554355712 2017-12-01 03:04:35 UTC <Suavebones> Gee, I wonder how a story about firing Tillerson, complete with who would replace him, wandered out into the public domain? Are you, @realDonaldTrump, trying to *feed* the media fake news??
936792200213544960 2017-12-01 03:00:39 UTC <Suavebones> @MadvilNE @SocialPowerOne1 This is a coup, plain and simple. Our government has been taken over by people who do not want to govern, but who plan solely to enrich themselves.

936621363124514816 2017-12-01 15:41:49 UTC <Suavebones> @_A__Dub Yeah, why, exactly, does the NYT give this fatuous jerk a soft landing?
936545284447805440 2017-12-01 10:39:30 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRynheart Of course. How else can they fund this explosive giveaway to the ultra-wealthy and corporate interests?

I have often thought that a better VP pick might have led to Gores victory, sparing us Bush v. Gore, and all the negatives that followed.

It will rob the poor, the sick, the middle class, and the elderly - all to provide tax bennies to corporations and rich guys in a booming economy.

935313256482185216 2017-11-27 01:03:52 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @51RWR It was in fine shape until Tillerson got there. Sad you dont read the news of how he and 45 stripped positions, removed people from vital functions, and refuses to appoint anyone. If you kneecap someone, they cannot walk. Same idea at State.
935312245915045888 2017-11-27 00:59:51 UTC <Suavebones> @CapehartJ @thehill @melbluespclsts Nothing involuntary about it. He rolled into the position with billions of dollars in personal incentives to ease sanctions against Russia.

935203068731211776 2017-11-27 17:46:01 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @RichPuszczewicz Its a valid position only if access to abortion remains available. Birth control isnt foolproof, kids will be kids, and rapists arent concerned about protection. There will still be unplanned, unwanted pregnancies. But yes - universally-available contraception, by all means.

But I now see by the many articulate comments Ive read during the last days outcry that it needed FAR more - a condemnatory sidebar or counter-piece, links to Arendt and Holocaust, etc.
935191492829650945 2017-11-27 17:00:01 UTC <Suavebones> @Deemoney521 @JoyAnnReid #NoTime
935190529502986241 2017-11-27 16:56:11 UTC <Suavebones> @frodofied #SheWarnedUs indeed. Sigh.
935190252435652608 2017-11-27 16:55:05 UTC <Suavebones> @rhonda_harbison @frodofied @JNMezzo It is literally the tragedy of our times that this woman isnt President.
935173817059573762 2017-11-27 15:49:47 UTC <Suavebones> @isteintraum @lavillac They have always bumped bottoms at the nadir of the political circle.
935173314242256897 2017-11-27 15:47:47 UTC <Suavebones> @rhonda_harbison @frodofied You seem to be referring to a vast right-wing conspiracy. If only someone smart and capable could have recognized it and warned us {cough-cough-in 1998, ffs -cough}.
935171692850159616 2017-11-27 15:41:20 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon @ChadSonger1 Right, that would be the electorate that cast 3 million more votes for her than the now-incumbent?
935163314727936000 2017-11-27 15:08:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Olivianuzzi Serious depression since November 16. Still trying to crawl out of it.
935162407533416449 2017-11-27 15:04:27 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @tedlieu @luci3020 I guess I dont really understand the idea that identifying bad people gives them a platform. And there must be far more people who are nauseated by this guy than consider him a hero. But I appreciate your taking the time to respond.
935153158732398593 2017-11-27 14:27:42 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady Im gonna just put this out there: some of us white ladies are very worried about how other white ladies vote, and spend our time actively registering minority voters to try to overwhelm white Republicans.
934964972165021696 2017-11-26 01:59:54 UTC <Suavebones> @deejay90192 @bravenak As long as we agree youre talking about SARANDON, I absolutely agree. 
934964088332943360 2017-11-26 01:56:24 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @tedlieu @luci3020 Why do you say the NYT normalized the Nazis? To me, they were reporting on a situation in the banality of evil mode - noting that monsters walk among us disguised as ordinary people, which means these people are *already* normalized. Why shouldnt NYT highlight it?
934961775769878529 2017-11-26 01:47:12 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou No, its not. If youre wrong, own it.
934926293954523136 2017-11-26 23:26:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Xtrexx @RWPUSA Important to recall, however, that *all* currently-available birth control has a failure rate, so taking abortion off the table will never be feasible.
934924542861983744 2017-11-26 23:19:15 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon I support the DSWT despite the fact that you support it too.

934923335426699264 2017-11-26 23:14:27 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon Gee, if only wed had a President who valued the environment. Oh, right, you spiked her.
934783278866874368 2017-11-26 13:57:55 UTC <Suavebones> @RepAdamSchiff @Sammysgranny Poor banks, with booming profits and more than the usual customer swindles. How hobbled they have been.

934608031270150144 2017-11-25 02:21:33 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato Um, if the tape was not authentic, you can be sure Billy Bush would have said so to keep his job. He didnt. And he didnt.

934592371584516096 2017-11-25 01:19:19 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon I did not interpret the article as you did. To me, it read as a cautionary banality of evil piece about the nightmares that lurk in ordinary-looking packaging.
934559798061817856 2017-11-25 23:09:53 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer @neeratanden People who champion putting CEOs in political positions have never worked with CEOs.

934556228755189760 2017-11-25 22:55:42 UTC <Suavebones> @AvoBrazOrunMa4 @EdKrassen I would hope all persons of goodwill and conscience, Jewish and otherwise, would share your view, Ed.
934502973119414272 2017-11-25 19:24:05 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @NateSilver538 Dont get the outrage about NYTs printing this piece. It seems to have been reported fairly, and although the subject matter is horrifying, the information it contains - the terrifying creeps next door - is something we should all remain mindful of. IDing /= normalizing.
934497977564934144 2017-11-25 19:04:14 UTC <Suavebones> @IrwinJames327 @GaryLegum French cuffs with a gun says it all.

934434101490098178 2017-11-25 14:50:25 UTC <Suavebones> @T_FisherKing @TheRickWilson This Hill article is spectacular bullshit.
934433709398179840 2017-11-25 14:48:51 UTC <Suavebones> @frodofied Sadly, it already pretty much *is*!bullshit. The veneer is just getting scraped off at an alarming rate.
934433006801973248 2017-11-25 14:46:04 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny So sorry to hear this. Hope everything turns out well for her.
934309444699095040 2017-11-24 06:35:04 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @TomthunkitsMind Just when you think youre numb to his coarseness ...
934307499611533312 2017-11-24 06:27:21 UTC <Suavebones> @monicabyrne13 Will find that show - thanks. And please - my snark was aimed at the show, not you. I thought it was pathetic.
934305622337634304 2017-11-24 06:19:53 UTC <Suavebones> @monicabyrne13 I dont think the show was intended as a fount of religious insights. Catholicism just provides a gaudy background for the Machiavellian misdeeds of its attractive Pope.
934304938993205248 2017-11-24 06:17:10 UTC <Suavebones> @IChotiner @theBodes @johnjdodig Ohh, thank you for that term!
934303054215634944 2017-11-24 06:09:41 UTC <Suavebones> @monicabyrne13 Youll be disappointed. This is just House of Cards: Vatican.
934300918803132422 2017-11-24 06:01:12 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou It was obviously fake. Most of us know lots of Dems, and most of those folks would not back Bernie at the next election. The Hill is not reliable.
934299809212534785 2017-11-24 05:56:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Alex__Katz @Wilson__Valdez So pleased to hear Im not the only one who noticed. I was starting to doubt my sanity.
934299413232488448 2017-11-24 05:55:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Wilson__Valdez @Alex__Katz And people will idolize him as though his every tweet scatters gold nuggets.
934298802118201344 2017-11-24 05:52:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Alex__Katz @Wilson__Valdez He blocked me today for pointing out an obvious error regarding joint defense agreements. He said, and Newsweek quoted him, that such agreements are unusual. They are, in fact as common as sunrise and sunset, something he could not accept.
934278725897564161 2017-11-24 04:33:00 UTC <Suavebones> @deejay90192 @Amy_Siskind Guess it depends what she was smoking, no?
934278489045319680 2017-11-24 04:32:04 UTC <Suavebones> @deejay90192 @Amy_Siskind @CarolGo18658081 I agree. It isnt any knd of deal to me. Just observing why the bigot right might be squirming.
934242311298355200 2017-11-24 02:08:19 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @cousin55 Wait, what - the prince * isnt * sending the check??!?
934232298471399424 2017-11-24 01:28:31 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha Great relief - you are far better choice. 
934231586811154432 2017-11-24 01:25:42 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @ChaosBot5000 Keep smokin what youre smokin, hon. It may save you from the political disappointment headed your way.
934230431087583232 2017-11-24 01:21:06 UTC <Suavebones> @popeyepleune @HoneyDemForce Im old, a lifetime lefty, and even *I* dont want to see Bernie run. Fresh blood, please. Vision, youth and achievement - pick two out of three.
934229631535689728 2017-11-24 01:17:55 UTC <Suavebones> @IrwinJames327 Love it - thank you, and goodnight.
934229374156410880 2017-11-24 01:16:54 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnAusmcvet Just lovely. 
934222601940955136 2017-11-24 00:49:59 UTC <Suavebones> @edgeoforever @RVAwonk Dersh has let his innate political prejudices overcome his good sense.
934222181034102785 2017-11-24 00:48:19 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @homecici @Irish_Pack Thats a cogent analysis. Thanks.
934215683247706112 2017-11-24 00:22:30 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @ChaosBot5000 Now this, for sure, is a fraudulent chart.
934209043450626049 2017-11-24 23:56:07 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Not sure which Democrats you polled, but this is frankly unbelievable. I know lots of Dems - not one supports Bernie for the next election.
934185791357464576 2017-11-24 22:23:43 UTC <Suavebones> @jonfavs @samstein @thepoliticalcat @chillibeanboy Absolutely! A true hero in every way.
934185529574170624 2017-11-24 22:22:41 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer She was kissing her *white* bf. Thats the part these racist trolls hate.
934172717338607616 2017-11-24 21:31:46 UTC <Suavebones> @Deemoney521 @HillaryWarnedUs Congrats!
934163556139802624 2017-11-24 20:55:22 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @TheRickyDavila The guy she kissed is white. Hence the RW hysteria.
934162890692575233 2017-11-24 20:52:43 UTC <Suavebones> @Newsweek @paladine Too bad he oversteps his knowledge sometimes.
934162528237633536 2017-11-24 20:51:17 UTC <Suavebones> @therealAntipho @Newsweek Newsweek, you need better sources than Seth Abramson, who, despite illustrious credentials, apparently lacks a background in high-powered financial and political criminal investigations. He says joint defense agreements are uncommon, but that is dead wrong in matters like Flynns
934160424991318016 2017-11-24 20:42:55 UTC <Suavebones> @jonathanweisman Know Congress will extend them? You call someone disingenuous because their reasonable expectations run counter to your magical vision of the future? Pfftt.
934153617619148800 2017-11-24 20:15:52 UTC <Suavebones> @Delavegalaw @SofiaRGelpi Funny - that wasnt his defense. But oh well ...
934150470720921600 2017-11-24 20:03:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Delavegalaw @SethAbramson Plainly you are inexperienced in the *particular area about which you are speaking.* Among defendants (or investigatees) of the corporate and political classes, joint defense agreements are common.
934144251188752384 2017-11-24 19:38:39 UTC <Suavebones> @Delavegalaw This faux expert was just quoted verbatim in Newsweek saying that joint defense agreements are uncommon. I replied that they are common as house dust in the white collar defense world, at least. Now he wants to litigate the issue of white collar. Sigh.
934143829661200384 2017-11-24 19:36:59 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRickWilson @ericgarland @TrueFactsStated @counterchekist @20committee @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @VAL_MAYNARD @911CORLEBRA777 @SethAbramson And if you dont believe me:pic.twitter.com/aBubbJijt8
934142777788530688 2017-11-24 19:32:48 UTC <Suavebones> @Delavegalaw Puh-leeze come over to the Newsweek or Seth Abramson timeline and say so. He and his coterie are defending his misstatement.
934142482643689473 2017-11-24 19:31:38 UTC <Suavebones> As Ive been trying to tell Seth Abramson, who was caught in a minor incidence of ignorance about the subject. https://twitter.com/delavegalaw/status/934140867505405952
934137205311774720 2017-11-24 19:10:39 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRickWilson @ericgarland @TrueFactsStated @counterchekist @20committee @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @VAL_MAYNARD @911CORLEBRA777 @SethAbramson Seth - this falls under general rubric of white collar crime - rich guys using lies and financial shenanigans to achieve their ends, which often wind up getting charged, among other things, as obstruction, false statements, etc. Just admit you were wrong, OK?
934134818538799105 2017-11-24 19:01:10 UTC <Suavebones> @deejay90192 @Amy_Siskind Ah - but she kissed a *white guy.* In public. Oh, the horror {collapses on handy fainting couch}.
934133415909064704 2017-11-24 18:55:36 UTC <Suavebones> @funder Folks - the supposed big deal is that Malia was kissing a WHITE GUY. Jeez, Louise - yall should know by now that it is racial prejudice that animates these RW clowns.
934130565892075520 2017-11-24 18:44:16 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRickWilson @ericgarland @TrueFactsStated @counterchekist @20committee @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @VAL_MAYNARD @911CORLEBRA777 Seth Abramson is wrong about at least one thing: in sprawling white collar criminal investigations, joint defense agreements are as common as house dust. They are discontinued when a conflict of interest among defense parties arises - often as a result of cooperation or a plea.
934089034443382784 2017-11-24 15:59:15 UTC <Suavebones> @_celia_marie_ This story is BS. The Hill is losing credibility quickly.
934086857775648769 2017-11-24 15:50:36 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @stacykoko @KarenMema @gustavchirps Why is everyone arguing about US politics with a guy who lives in Sweden? Pffft ... go away.
934035750923857921 2017-11-24 12:27:31 UTC <Suavebones> Says it all.https://twitter.com/juliusgoat/status/934028365203374086
934035559726460929 2017-11-24 12:26:45 UTC <Suavebones> @JuliusGoat I dont think Ive seen it put quite like this. Well said.
934034012049260545 2017-11-24 12:20:36 UTC <Suavebones> @girlsreallyrule Sure. Just pointing out that in a joint defense agreement, the people Flynns attorneys fear most are other potential defendants lawyers, who will seek to disbar them if there is a scintilla of evidence that Flynn cooperated while continuing a joint defense.
934032820997054464 2017-11-24 12:15:52 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @FrankKern20 @krassenstein @csedgman Its not clear that 45 has taken or withheld an official act. Sadly.
934031615163973632 2017-11-24 12:11:05 UTC <Suavebones> @girlsreallyrule Doubtful it was an express condition. Its standard operating procedure while cooperating to cancel joint defense agreements, not to mention an absolute ethical obligation imposed on his attorneys.
934030508744351744 2017-11-24 12:06:41 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @BrianPaulStuart Is it just me, or does hs post read as a threat to prosecutors?
933947690282389505 2017-11-23 06:37:35 UTC <Suavebones> @admiralmpj Its beyond disgusting. How do congresspersons, who are supposed to legislate for the public good, sleep at night?
933930829599801344 2017-11-23 05:30:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Isikoff George Washington signed the Constitution, and its still considered valid ...

933891769275580416 2017-11-23 02:55:23 UTC <Suavebones> @summerbrennan Understood. Just trying to encourage women to engage in self-care, rather than pretzel-izing as usual. In the meanwhile, I hope the meal turned out wonderfully.
933888015247687680 2017-11-23 02:40:28 UTC <Suavebones> @jenndangerous @knittedsweater @playground_park It also washes its face with its paws and rolls over. Inadvertently scared the sh*t out of my cleaner.
933887596698091520 2017-11-23 02:38:48 UTC <Suavebones> @jenndangerous @knittedsweater I have one of those auto-kitties. It purrs, and Im not allergic to it.
933876740841029632 2017-11-23 01:55:40 UTC <Suavebones> @summerbrennan Pro tip for next year - get fully cooked breast of turkey from Costco, and gravy from the local French chef. It took me an hour to make stuffing, potatoes and green bean casserole, and the dinner was delicious. Do not conflate love with effort - next time, cut corners. 
933855229547724800 2017-11-23 00:30:11 UTC <Suavebones> @Cycle4 @ddale8 Never has a national leader been so bone-crushingly stupid.

933765975098327040 2017-11-23 18:35:31 UTC <Suavebones> @Olivianuzzi Olivia, this arrant horse twaddle. It embraces - nay, exalts - the false equivalency that each side of the Trump/No Trump divide has sane and valuable things to contribute to a political conversation. This is false. Its the Nazis, bigots & anti-Semites who are the assholes.

933718806110732289 2017-11-23 15:28:05 UTC <Suavebones> @FrommeTami @mcspocky Gonna have to arm-wrestle you on that one - the award goes to *my* wife. Happy Thanksgiving!
933666167796875264 2017-11-23 11:58:55 UTC <Suavebones> @ananavarro @NewDay Or, alternatively, that family values BS was always a fig leaf for bigotry and hypocrisy.
933664797840646144 2017-11-23 11:53:29 UTC <Suavebones> @EdanClay Yes, youre crazy. You want to punish a guy who was having an affair? Not your business. A guy who sent pix to an adult lover? Not your biz. This guy is an ass of a legislator, but he is actually the victim in this instance.
933573773772468224 2017-11-22 05:51:47 UTC <Suavebones> @ClaraJeffery @GraceReiner Worse than not defending her, Joe made the decision not to call two corroborating witnesses who were there and ready to testify. He threw Anita Hill under the bus.

933569415848722433 2017-11-22 05:34:28 UTC <Suavebones> @NewsJunkie60 @GaryTheCynic In what way do you think texting a dick pic to a consenting adult is at all similar to texting a dick pic to an underage girl?
933521758325370880 2017-11-22 02:25:05 UTC <Suavebones> @exoticgamora @CJPatruno @lfkraus @1IronMan2018 @TheSWPrincess @ProudResister @B52Malmet @debbiesideris @LunaLuvgood2017 @Corrina_L525 @Lee_in_Iowa @BeSeriousUSA OK, thanks. That makes sense.

I have a jillion people on my own personal block list. I am not under the illusion that even one of them will hear me.
933506586059739137 2017-11-22 01:24:48 UTC <Suavebones> @pacelattin Right. Fat shaming, always a treat.
933506360741736448 2017-11-22 01:23:54 UTC <Suavebones> @anamariecox And another woman I admired bites the dust.

I dont understand why I should care if a bunch of  people I dont want to hear from anyway have blocked me. I know Im missing something here ...
933492266781442048 2017-11-22 00:27:54 UTC <Suavebones> I got an oddity like this recently, too. Mine said my account was behaving like an automated account, and locked me out, made me change my PW three times, and continued to casually evict me from Twitter for the next week.
933485987518226432 2017-11-22 00:02:57 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 A little charity around the holidays, my friend. Unless this pic was unsolicited, then *hes* the victim here by having this pic released without his permission. People woo differently these days ...
933484399399546880 2017-11-22 23:56:38 UTC <Suavebones> @NateSilver538 @craigbuettell Oh, hon - that ship sailed years ago.

933482726128095232 2017-11-22 23:49:59 UTC <Suavebones> @danibostick Just what Ive been thinking. Hes entitled to send dick pics to willing recipients without getting dragged, body-shamed or threatened.
933453867374620673 2017-11-22 21:55:19 UTC <Suavebones> @stephenhblack What consummate nonsense.
933453032213192704 2017-11-22 21:52:00 UTC <Suavebones> @WCKitchen @chefjoseandres Thank you for making this the best possible Thanksgiving in very difficult circumstances. You are one of the worlds greatest men.
933433703782531073 2017-11-22 20:35:11 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat He could have studied math, or physics, or astronomy to prove the shape of the world, but noooo ... hes going with the brainless option.

933426635302363136 2017-11-22 20:07:06 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos @NuclearPolitico Meanwhile, your ilk is trying to hijack a party and hold it hostage ... thats not inclusiveness, its kidnapping.
933425885104939008 2017-11-22 20:04:07 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Happy Thanksgiving to you, and your human and canine families - hope it is a lovely, peaceful day!
933391910634381312 2017-11-22 17:49:07 UTC <Suavebones> @NormOrnstein Just what Ive been saying. A photo where a man is pretending to grope a Kevlar covered, adult chest is a far cry from fingering young teenaged girls.
933391139176046592 2017-11-22 17:46:03 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Oh, please. No chance a man as flavor-averse as 45 likes pumpkin.
933387978868527105 2017-11-22 17:33:30 UTC <Suavebones> @BusbyKathleen @aravosis True. But not all those power plays involve ones genitals.
933387801218781184 2017-11-22 17:32:47 UTC <Suavebones> @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan @Salems_Thom @ananavarro So they chose the black guy. Sure.
933385853216235521 2017-11-22 17:25:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Shinlogos666 @otraletra Holy shit. That is absolutely repellent.
933362585612697600 2017-11-22 15:52:36 UTC <Suavebones> @NewsJunkie60 @kylegriffin1 How does the President *make* the pool restate something? Are the press his lapdogs?
933361451695095809 2017-11-22 15:48:05 UTC <Suavebones> @LadyBirdMovie Really enjoyed seeing this film in Phoenix last week! Saoirse Ronan is such a powerful actor.
933348776860721153 2017-11-22 14:57:43 UTC <Suavebones> @greta Thats just wrong as a matter of law. There is *no* requirement that settlements corporations pay on behalf of their employees be made public (unless the figure is so gargantuan that it becomes material to the companys bottom line).

933168375978528768 2017-11-21 03:00:52 UTC <Suavebones> @lovetogive2 @RawStory You can drift from 65 to 85 through inattention. But you dont just drift to 119 mph. Most cars wont even *go* 119 mph. So she was in an expensive car and deliberately gunning it. What a desperate liar.

933156467388985350 2017-11-21 02:13:33 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol Maybe you saw the light?
933154001259917312 2017-11-21 02:03:45 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost @FalcoholicMatt Gee, it might have been easier to learn math, astronomy  and physics, which already prove the truth youre seeking, but have fun anyway.
933109366802092032 2017-11-21 23:06:24 UTC <Suavebones> @dbongino Oh, bullshit. And you know it.
933076689482944512 2017-11-21 20:56:33 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos FTR, you were wrong to jump the hysteria bus about Franken. The 1st accuser said she consented to the kiss, though he took it farther than she liked. And the photo is an *obvious* gag shot of a doofus who thinks hes going to grope a woman through 2 of Kevlar. Not touching her.
933028413824147457 2017-11-21 17:44:43 UTC <Suavebones> @LouiseMensch @rgcainmd @AHamiltonSpirit Dont be a chump. If you dont block people, they can harass you. Or does that only happen to women?
933026764204359680 2017-11-21 17:38:10 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @MiltShook Oh, his poor wife. This is just awful in every possible way.

She speaks in full sentences, with gusto, without pauses or teleprompters, and with stirring ideas. Please rethink saying the not known as a great orator thing - I truly believe this perception is sexist, and I want to stop promoting it.

932931329343217664 2017-11-21 11:18:56 UTC <Suavebones> @1LagerthaLothbr @davidfrum The thing about settlements is this - either youre trying to avoid the cost of trial, or your misconduct was such that you fear the higher $$ judgment a jury might impose. A trial would not have cost BillO anywhere near $32 million. Judge him accordingly.
932848298334945281 2017-11-20 05:49:00 UTC <Suavebones> @naretevduorp Um, no. Nobody.
932797166560485376 2017-11-20 02:25:49 UTC <Suavebones> @bravenak I was in the supermarket when Al grabbed me by the arm and yanked me towards him. I just missed being hit by a bunch of falling cans, but seriously ... he TOUCHED me to save from harm?!? Sheesh ...

932715429146935296 2017-11-20 21:01:01 UTC <Suavebones> @OBXHippieChick It is, quite simply, a mental illness on their part. A sickness, and should be discussed as such.
932699633960173568 2017-11-20 19:58:16 UTC <Suavebones> @DStewart541 @mr_pitchfork Vetted the story, eh? Then why was her account of being groped widely reported when she claims to have been asleep and is going solely by a photo? Particularly when said photo does *not* show Franken touching her, and is obviously a staged gag shot? She was not groped.

932693745983565824 2017-11-20 19:34:52 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos @Lawsonbulk Howard is merely pointing out that, by law, an election sanitizes past sins. You can look it up- 18 USC. Something-or-other.
932692334159863808 2017-11-20 19:29:15 UTC <Suavebones> @KBAndersen Nobody with knowledge of Trump thought any such thing. He has been a crass, boorish and ignorant stooge *all his life.*
932690731038228480 2017-11-20 19:22:53 UTC <Suavebones> @lenadunham @lennyletter @windmillcharger @zinziclemmons I read your piece twice. Do you have specific accusation of racism against Dunham personally?
932687502212661248 2017-11-20 19:10:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Marmel @ckn4502 Agreed!
932682670189961216 2017-11-20 18:50:51 UTC <Suavebones> @Marmel @ckn4502 Well, exactly. Some of my long-time friendships are in ruins, and yet my willingness to compromise my beliefs has never been so microscopic.
932682289317781504 2017-11-20 18:49:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Marmel I believe could influence CNN to stop giving these mentally challenged people a platform by *refusing to watch CNN.*
932681559563321345 2017-11-20 18:46:26 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @naretevduorp The NYT, in turn, cannot get over its deep desire to belittle and rebuke the Clintons.
932625662329872387 2017-11-20 15:04:19 UTC <Suavebones> @LolaGirlinIndy @benjaminwittes The remarkably jejeune level of argumentation coming this past week from experienced defense attorneys Ty Cobb and Abbe Lowell (the latter of whom has been a lion of the criminal defense bar for 40 years) speaks volumes about what they have to work with:  just plain nothing.

932622614903734272 2017-11-20 14:52:13 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis I recall all those black identity extremists at Charlottesville, where one of them rammed and killed a young woman. Oh, wait ...

932497822254952448 2017-11-19 06:36:20 UTC <Suavebones> @KatrinaPierson Until 11/8/16, America was fairly characterized as both a republic and a democracy. Last year, it became an oligarchy, a kleptocracy and a kakocracy.

932425685544476672 2017-11-19 01:49:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Faith_Salie So youre a parent who doesnt care if your kids go through their friends parents closets or drawers, find the unsecured, loaded gun, play with it and shoot each other? Good to know.
932377547626762243 2017-11-19 22:38:24 UTC <Suavebones> @TomthunkitsMind What an execrable pair.

932362402519060480 2017-11-19 21:38:13 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer And even that only works if nobody gets sick or loses a job.
932361356044410881 2017-11-19 21:34:04 UTC <Suavebones> @BillOReilly Is that the same freedom of speech you paid tens of millions to suppress from your sexual harassment victims?
932332910899687424 2017-11-19 19:41:02 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @justinbaragona Wow, interesting. They didnt teach us in law school that an election bleached away sexual abuse allegations.
932331377470595072 2017-11-19 19:34:56 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump, you just cannot hide your bigotry, can you?
932330970916667392 2017-11-19 19:33:19 UTC <Suavebones> @McFaul @NamVet14 Sorry, but that is not even the teensiest bit remotely true. Obama was respected worldwide. To the extent he was disliked (Putin), it was for the right reasons. He was honest, principled, and filled his admin with people like him.

932329675740680192 2017-11-19 19:28:11 UTC <Suavebones> @UrsulaV I cannot imagine what someone who claims to commune with nature is doing killing wildlife. Its a sickness.

932309244111593472 2017-11-19 18:06:59 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity Wake me up when you have something of note to report. (Spoiler - I expect a nice, longgg rest).
932308652333047808 2017-11-19 18:04:38 UTC <Suavebones> @dandrezner @Delavegalaw I guess two lawyers will have to disagree.
932296873250930688 2017-11-19 17:17:50 UTC <Suavebones> @TardieuGraveurs I love this!
932295484131065856 2017-11-19 17:12:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Delavegalaw @dandrezner Its not bad lawyering - its just desperation lawyering, when your client is so awful that all you have to work with are the cheesiest of excuses.
932278989174947840 2017-11-19 16:06:46 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland Ive crossed paths with Abbe Lowell. IMO, hes about to have a stroke right now because his client is so unmanageable.
932150693334466560 2017-11-18 07:36:58 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @panamapammie Thanks for the suggestion. I just did. 
932133386751156224 2017-11-18 06:28:12 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Brasilmagic @panamapammie @grouch_ass Neither lying nor slut shaming. Just pointing out what has been reported today. Also, when it comes to interpreting how humiliated she would be by a gag photo where she is not being touched, I think its fair to point out that her humiliation threshold is pretty high.
932098431224496129 2017-11-18 04:09:18 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Brasilmagic @panamapammie @grouch_ass Both the photographer and the military escort say she  was awake and participating in the gag. Plus, she was a semi-nude model, so not sure how humiliated she was by a prank in which she participated. But by all means, keep your outrage evergreen.
932096869341192192 2017-11-18 04:03:05 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer Me too. And me too.

932004380307423232 2017-11-18 21:55:34 UTC <Suavebones> @DanaBeyerMD Gosh. Wonder which friend of Erogan and enemy of Preet encouraged *this* nonsense {cough, cough, Trump}?
932003034854338560 2017-11-18 21:50:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Slate I dunno whats in the water at Slate, but trying to turn AF into a monster isnt going well for you folks.

If you do not support reproductive choice, youre a DINO and not worth electing. Oh, and people without uteri should probably stop trivializing the importance of this issue to women.

931607651628093441 2017-11-17 19:39:07 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @ThatDeborahGirl There is zero evidence of groping. His hands are hovering over her for the gag photo. She herself says she was asleep, so she does not know whether she was groped. Nobody there says she was.

Its a gag shot.
931581769152790529 2017-11-17 17:56:16 UTC <Suavebones> @jaketapper @mslauraz @FSOforHire @turnercampdave Believed he did it? Do you not have eyes? Its clearly a staged gag - hes grinning like an idiot while his hands hover over (but do not touch) her chest. Get it? Hes playing the fool who thinks he can grope a woman through a Kevlar vest. Its a joke.

931414668995846144 2017-11-16 06:52:16 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Brasilmagic @panamapammie @grouch_ass Zero evidence he touched her breasts. Photo was staged as a gag, with his hands hovering over her breasts. Look at it. She had on a Kevlar vest - nobody could see or touch her breasts. Thats the gag - a grinning stooge who thinks he can cop a feel through Kevlar.
931409044790579201 2017-11-16 06:29:55 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Brasilmagic @alf_becker Im assuming that her story is true. She agrees she consented to the kiss, but says he overdid it. So at worst, hes a jerk and a dick.
931408321344454656 2017-11-16 06:27:03 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Brasilmagic @panamapammie @grouch_ass I honestly think he thought it was a joke, not a humiliation. Comedians can get that stuff wrong sometimes. But even if he posed the photo to humiliate her sexually, its terrible judgment and mean-spirited, but still not a crime or an assault.
931407347791962112 2017-11-16 06:23:11 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @lgordonsswc Made to look is a gag, not an assault. I was a lawyer. I know this stuff.

Vitreal is much less serious, though it can make retinal detachment more likely in the future. But again, thank you! You have a kind and generous nature one rarely sees on Twitter. 
931314879943684097 2017-11-16 00:15:45 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SenFranken @jdice03 @WtfAmerica4 @CLIFF_IT_Aero_ @lang51b @persistmom I both read her statement and saw her speak. She consented, grudgingly, to be kissed, and then he vastly overdid it. She was sleeping and only has the photo to suggest she was groped, and the photo looks like a gag, which Franken also suggested in his first statement.
931310056540213249 2017-11-16 23:56:35 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SenFranken @jdice03 @WtfAmerica4 @CLIFF_IT_Aero_ @persistmom @lang51b I think the accusation of Franken was overstated by every media outlet. The woman claims she was groped because there is a gag photo of Franken with his hands hovering over, but not  touching, her Kevlar-vest- covered chest. Bad taste, but not assault.
931308955107655680 2017-11-16 23:52:12 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SenFranken @jdice03 @persistmom What Franken did was wrong, but not to the degree or level of seriousness that both Trump and Moore are accused of.
931306053211267072 2017-11-16 23:40:40 UTC <Suavebones> Sadly true. And brilliantly expressed, as always.https://twitter.com/limericking/status/931305499567501312
931293046431367168 2017-11-16 22:48:59 UTC <Suavebones> @IvankaTrump Oh, shut up, rich girl. Gloating while the rest of us suffer is repulsive.
931292554284343296 2017-11-16 22:47:02 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd @Rosie @auscgirl @Chach616 You do realize that he WAS NOT GROPING HER? Look at the photo - his hands are in front of her but arent on her, and she is wearing a Kevlar vest, through which nothing could be groped anyway. Its a gag photo in very bad taste, but it is not molestation.
931291795056500736 2017-11-16 22:44:01 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd More to the point, Franken kissed a woman who acknowledges she consented to be kissed. Did he overdo it? Yeah, definitely. Did he grope her breasts? Almost certainly not - its a staged gag photo and shes wearing a Kevlar vest, ffs. Was he her boss or was she underage? No.
931289784818974720 2017-11-16 22:36:01 UTC <Suavebones> @SenatorCollins @stopthenutjob I was about to ask what you wanted me to do when I remembered that Sen. Collinss first name is also Susan.

931221419022675968 2017-11-16 18:04:22 UTC <Suavebones> @LeeannTweeden @yashar Actually, she says she did consent to being kissed, and her only evidence of groping is a gag photo where he is not touching her. Bad taste, over the top, aggressive? Yes. Predator-level behavior? No.
931220976838238208 2017-11-16 18:02:36 UTC <Suavebones> @MarisaKabas No - you stop with the false equivalence. What Franken did was *nothing like* what Moore did. Was Franken wrong? Yes. Did he victimize a child? No.

931211355608059904 2017-11-16 17:24:22 UTC <Suavebones> @summerbrennan I got out of college in 1974 at age 21. Unmarried, I got a good job and moved to NYC. I was then denied a credit card (no husband), and excused from jury duty (solely for being a woman). Times have changed.
931209631656919040 2017-11-16 17:17:31 UTC <Suavebones> @pourmecoffee @LJA57 @SusanTCase Thanks. I had a vitreal detachment (age-related) that spawned huge floaters, including one with a black dot in each eye where the vitreous pulled away from the optic nerve. Nothing to be done, and after grieving for mos., I got (fairly) used to them.
931208926258802688 2017-11-16 17:14:43 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk Can we dial back the hysteria *just a bit*? Its a gag photo shot, where he is very clearly *not* touching her with his left hand, and probably not with his right hand, either, though the angle makes it hard to tell. She was asleep and is going entirely by the photo
931195154001575936 2017-11-16 16:20:00 UTC <Suavebones> @pourmecoffee @LJA57 @SusanTCase Lucky you. My floaters are front and center every day, as theyve been for many, many years.
931188142647926789 2017-11-16 15:52:08 UTC <Suavebones> @pourmecoffee @SusanTCase Umm, no. Most floaters dont go away.
931187949500211202 2017-11-16 15:51:22 UTC <Suavebones> @selina3sticks @pourmecoffee @SaraJaneMaki But it was actually vitreal detachment, right?

931187176280170496 2017-11-16 15:48:18 UTC <Suavebones> @alfranken @LeeannTweeden @JamilSmith The photo is certainly in bad taste, but if you look carefully, he seems to be pretending to touch her without actually touching her. As for the kiss, she consented. It may have been more of a kiss than she bargained for, but she agreed he could kiss her.
931185190944227328 2017-11-16 15:40:24 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Nothing. Anywhere.

931042505763708928 2017-11-15 06:13:25 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @HannitysHead This is flatly untrue. The general public has no overarching duty to report a crime theyve witnessed.

930808052088913921 2017-11-15 14:41:47 UTC <Suavebones> @ezraklein @mooray @SuzanneAubin I wanted to scream at his wife for calling Anita out of the blue and suggesting she apologize.
930760930056593409 2017-11-15 11:34:33 UTC <Suavebones> @_A__Dub Another way to look at it is that the automation long foretold in various job sectors has now arrived.
930759254482370560 2017-11-15 11:27:53 UTC <Suavebones> @twicktwit I hate this over-hyping of gotcha. Pence was around a lot of odd activity, but until someone bursts forth with emails/other evidence directly linking him to the activity, he is (sadly) not remotely screwed. Yet, anyway.
930680171002200065 2017-11-14 06:13:38 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Oops -http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/11/the_mountain_of_evidence_against_roy_moore.html
930680095274143744 2017-11-14 06:13:20 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Please read this. If you decide, after reading, that you wouldnt let your 15 year old daughter ride alone with him in a car, then he should be elected. You make these kinds of decisions in your life every day based on available evidence. This one is no different.
930656021009145856 2017-11-14 04:37:40 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Nobody is throwing him in jail. Thats what innocent until proven guilty means. But the accusations, the circumstances, his history of stalking teenagers, multiple accusers - certainly those are things we should be able to consider in deciding whom to vote for?
930644660719988736 2017-11-14 03:52:32 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Again, women do not report most of these issues. Children report even fewer.
930643894395486208 2017-11-14 03:49:29 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard As I said, the number of false accusations is small. The number of unprovable-by-objective-testimony claims is far, far larger. Just because they cannot be proven does not mean they didnt happen.
930608798166691840 2017-11-14 01:30:02 UTC <Suavebones> @TomthunkitsMind Hahahaha!
930595931283529729 2017-11-14 00:38:54 UTC <Suavebones> @ezraklein @SuzanneAubin Thank you. I survived, finished up my career, and am happily retired. But I never hear the name Anita Hill without dying a bit inside at her maltreatment.
930593943183613953 2017-11-14 00:31:00 UTC <Suavebones> @MrFilmkritik Exactly why do you care how he feels about himself? Seriously - are you so intent on making sure everybody fits into a nicely labeled tidy little box that you cant appreciate someone different?
930590622431420416 2017-11-14 00:17:48 UTC <Suavebones> @ezraklein @SuzanneAubin @leavyrdailyhell @RustyPatti The other women harassed by Thomas whom Biden *did not allow to testify.*
930590207186894849 2017-11-14 00:16:09 UTC <Suavebones> @ezraklein @SuzanneAubin To see Anita Hill so abused by Joe Biden et al. during the Thomas hearings nearly broke my spirit. I too was a young female lawyer in DC who had been sexually harassed by colleagues.
930585210122416128 2017-11-14 23:56:18 UTC <Suavebones> @jdice03 @cottage_orchard Hahaha!!

930573357589729280 2017-11-14 23:09:12 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard My mom did not call the police on our moving man/wannabe rapist. Ive probably told more than 30 people about it in my life, but it is not anybody elses job to report it.  Sorry about your mom, though, and the toll on you both.
930572574542651393 2017-11-14 23:06:05 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard Most women will not report sexual abuse because they get comments just like yours, discrediting them.
930571995305074688 2017-11-14 23:03:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Wolfe321 @lillwild1 A lot of fear, and a ton of anger.

930511281550909440 2017-11-14 19:02:32 UTC <Suavebones> @isteintraum Just said the same thing. She was *never* stupid.
930510380090064896 2017-11-14 18:58:57 UTC <Suavebones> @Utleyjacobite I do understand - it is *endlessly* infuriating. Pax.
930509760033460224 2017-11-14 18:56:29 UTC <Suavebones> @PostOrwellian @Utleyjacobite Make tm fund her legal fees.
930509577656795136 2017-11-14 18:55:46 UTC <Suavebones> @Utleyjacobite Exactly. Which is why we should, yknow, resist, rather than encourage, these shenanigans.
930508786946646016 2017-11-14 18:52:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Utleyjacobite Sure - inflict tens of millions of dollars of legal fees on HRC so that the GOP can find *nothing* and the GOP base will continue to accuse her regardless (c.f. Benghazi). How would this help ANYONE?
930503520716931072 2017-11-14 18:31:41 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @Stonekettle Yabbut - they investigated Benghazi eight times, got 11 hours of HRCs public testimony, found NOTHING, and still yammer about her Benghazi crimes. Facts no longer matter, and investigations cost $$. Lets not encourage *more* of this baseless rooting around.

930460640103165953 2017-11-14 15:41:18 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @usarocks_c @GregWest_HALOJM @WendyPriest Youre offended that a white person might think whites are racist? Sure, OK. By the way, PoC is what many non-white persons have *asked* to be called.
930452910453825536 2017-11-14 15:10:35 UTC <Suavebones> @jennycohn1 Gee. And people mocked HRC relentlessly when she spoke of a vast, right-wing conspiracy.

930323388974866432 2017-11-13 06:35:55 UTC <Suavebones> @homeontheranch1 Oh, youre an armchair psychologist. Got it. As for race-baiting, you dont understand the term.

930306973156782080 2017-11-13 05:30:41 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @aucoin_5 A pure statement of conservative ideology - there is no racism, so if PoC fail, its their fault, not ours. How convenient it is for white people to ignore the countrys bitter (and continuing) history of racism and the long-lasting effects for PoC.
930264510107082753 2017-11-13 02:41:57 UTC <Suavebones> @Keurig @HelloFresh @lindajosherrill Well, of course you have that freedom. Its just an inane exercise, but have at it,
930258708004614145 2017-11-13 02:18:54 UTC <Suavebones> @Keurig @HelloFresh @lindajosherrill Keurig rightly pulled its marketing pending further info. Thats their free speech right.

930249719770636288 2017-11-13 01:43:11 UTC <Suavebones> @RhutaBhayga Ive spent the day arguing with white evangelicals (hereafter, Wevang) about a NYTimes opinion piece by a black man pondering whether his kids can truly be friends with white kids in this toxic era. Wevang is stalwart in claiming that they LOVE PoC and that racism us a lie.

Try getting your news from multiple sources. You might be surprised by how badly Fox misrepresents the world. PS - I met Trump 35 years ago. Hes an ass.
930241048437125120 2017-11-13 01:08:43 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd Lets get down to brass tacks. A huge number of men view women solely as sex objects for their own gratification. Lots of other guys are willing to turn a blind eye to vile acts. The web of complicit men is enormous.
930239892046483456 2017-11-13 01:04:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Keurig @HelloFresh @lindajosherrill When several people independently accuse a person of the same wrongdoing, and the accused finds it hard to deny (Did you date teenaged girls who were much you ger than you? Mostly no.), I think its fair to say it taints advertisers to support him.
930236878766325760 2017-11-13 00:52:09 UTC <Suavebones> @Keurig @HelloFresh @lindajosherrill Sean Hannity - with no evidence - defended an accused peophile. Keurig dropped its advertising to dissociate itself from defending pedophilia. And now youre boycotting Keurig for objecting to accused pedophiles and their apologists? Have you thought this through?
930181266808250368 2017-11-13 21:11:10 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @carrieksada @Cathyhaze Maybe its because conservatives are gigantic hypocrites about their panoramic bigotry? Just spitballing here ... .

930176285329915904 2017-11-13 20:51:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Wolfe321 Men who watch child porn are excited by the idea of sex with children. They may or may not act on that idea, but they certainly, IMO, pose a greater risk to kids than men who dont watch that stuff.
930175535778447360 2017-11-13 20:48:24 UTC <Suavebones> @Wolfe321 I was 12 when a 60 year old man who was moving us into our new house tried to rape me in an upstairs bedroom while my mom was outside. I was 13 when a 25 year old guy groped and kissed me. I was 14 & a local druggist made sure to brush my breasts with his arm as he walked past.
930173588556070912 2017-11-13 20:40:39 UTC <Suavebones> @TomthunkitsMind @Pajjr2016 Of course he did. He was a serial sexual predator.

929978505755889664 2017-11-12 07:45:28 UTC <Suavebones> @RansomeRichard You really have no idea what youre talking about. I was nearly raped by a 60 year old man when I was 12; molested by both a doctor and a dentist in my 20s; groped & forcibly kissed by colleagues, clients and others in my 20s and 30s. Ive never reported any of them.
929976130538373122 2017-11-12 07:36:02 UTC <Suavebones> @AynRandPaulRyan Too late; screw her.
929973581441728513 2017-11-12 07:25:54 UTC <Suavebones> @grandoftwo Im with you. Warren had one great idea - to implement the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But she has been poisoning the Dem well in various ways, too. Shes not my gal.
929972724968984576 2017-11-12 07:22:30 UTC <Suavebones> @carlreiner Hell find a way to spin it as a positive for him. The man never admits fault, wrongdoing or defeat.
929968748332662784 2017-11-12 07:06:42 UTC <Suavebones> @nhillery1 @TrueFactsStated How about the next 45.
929968636785127425 2017-11-12 07:06:15 UTC <Suavebones> @rcnal22 Waiting breathlessly for the answer ...
929937867979112448 2017-11-12 05:03:59 UTC <Suavebones> @SenWarren @peterdaou Got caught - is that a polite way of saying she set her shi*ty course and followed it?

929934035375218688 2017-11-12 04:48:46 UTC <Suavebones> @PalmerReport @AdamsFlaFan Palmer Report contains a fairly high proportion of surmise, as opposed to sourced journalism. As long as one keeps this in mind, its entertaining to read. But not a good source of facts.
929933262524260352 2017-11-12 04:45:41 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Love em both.

929923222107070466 2017-11-12 04:05:47 UTC <Suavebones> @cengeland @SallyAlbright Yeah, as though women and PoC are somehow not affected by the economy.

929921209008979968 2017-11-12 03:57:47 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @usarocks_c How many close black friends do you have? How many PoC, especially women, are your peers or superiors in the workplace? How many sit on your city council, your school board, your partys committee, and your church committees? What % of incarcerated are PoC in your state?
929917374345527296 2017-11-12 03:42:33 UTC <Suavebones> @NateSilver538 Fox isnt journalism. Breitbart isnt journalism.

929908450179538944 2017-11-12 03:07:06 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @Ashley14999 I am white, and I have known *many* white racists in my life. If you dont know any white racists, you are impossibly lucky, incredibly naive, lying, or have a different definition of racism.
929907730491437056 2017-11-12 03:04:14 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @HatPeople @MymymyCovfefe So why do you suppose statistics show that blacks are five times more likely to be imprisoned, ten times more likely to be killed by police, and the preponderance of both happens in conservative, white-governed states?
929897292907266048 2017-11-12 02:22:45 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @MrEckert84 You as well.

929896098822361091 2017-11-12 02:18:01 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @HatPeople Love the notion of soft bigotry when hurled by the right wing.
929895648089989120 2017-11-12 02:16:13 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM @carrieksada In what world do you think yours was a clever comment?
929849048508416001 2017-11-12 23:11:03 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM Just because you have a willingness to be friends with PoC does not make you the majority of whites. Nor does it reduce the burdens on PoC imposed by whites. Stop looking at this personally.
929848318682734592 2017-11-12 23:08:09 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @GregWest_HALOJM Or - he might be perceiving that America, as a white-dominant culture, is pretty toxic to PoC, killing, jailing and ignoring vets with problems to a horrifying degree.
929847780536750080 2017-11-12 23:06:01 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @ldnbasespanda @viped Its labeled an opinion. Or cant you read?
929847454035410944 2017-11-12 23:04:43 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes If I were black, I would be asking this question, too. It is a dire time for PoC in this country, and I think its fair to probe relationship questions. D/n understand all the hostility to this opinion piece.
929846733026160640 2017-11-12 23:01:51 UTC <Suavebones> I do not see anything incestuous.
929846299641356288 2017-11-12 23:00:08 UTC <Suavebones> @TheatreChick76 @Eddie69G I kissed my father on the mouth until he died. He was 71, I was 30. No incest, so stop making assumptions.
929824786980601856 2017-11-12 21:34:39 UTC <Suavebones> @wfrolik @JJohnsonLaw Im gonna buck the tide and support @jimjenningsUSA here. I have seen plenty of skimpily dressed, highly flirtatious young teens. Of course they should not be molested, raped or otherwise harmed. But it is important to teach boys to keep their hands off *despite* appearances.

929822131684196352 2017-11-12 21:24:06 UTC <Suavebones> @DJTwypgn45 @TeaPainUSA Well, that chart pretty much puts paid to the you gotta be religious to have morals argument. Some of the religious folk have no morals, and the rest of the religious folk will still support them.
929819792793509888 2017-11-12 21:14:48 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @ClareGibert Im not saying its the same. But I am saying it can be hormonally driven and potentially misread (unlike pre$pubescent girls).
929818071165890560 2017-11-12 21:07:58 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @ClareGibert I respectfully disagree. Pre-pubescent and post-pubescent girls are quite different. The latter actually can (and may want to be) flirtatious in the same way adults are. We have statutory rape laws to protect them from exactly that thing. (Otherwise, it would just be rape.)
929815464833777664 2017-11-12 20:57:36 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer @realHeatherD Mel Gibson, the anti-Semite jerk.

929814655781896192 2017-11-12 20:54:23 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright It is true that underage girls can be flirtatious or look older than their years. Thats why there are LAWS making it illegal to mess with them. Jeez, its not hard ... .
929813464507326464 2017-11-12 20:49:39 UTC <Suavebones> Jeez, I sure hope so.
929813145576603648 2017-11-12 20:48:23 UTC <Suavebones> @krassenstein What is he even talking about with *liar*? Seriously, what?
929812745641345024 2017-11-12 20:46:48 UTC <Suavebones> @ToriRob11 VERY disappointed with how gently you treated @donnabrazile. She attacked HRC, DNC and dems with an outright lie, and has still not fully walked back that lie. For shame, @amjoyshow
929777689656836097 2017-11-12 18:27:30 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump A straight male victim accusing a prominent gay man will believed automatically because other straight men are horribly threatened by the prospect of being touched by a gay man. But no man is viscerally horrified that some guy fondled a woman.
929776656159358976 2017-11-12 18:23:23 UTC <Suavebones> @windmillcharger @4everNeverTrump And if any of said women have made similar allegations against other men, they are promptly branded as liars.

The bf took me to the Stone Pony one afternoon and ran into another pal. We sat drinking beer with this pal, and when the juke box started, I got to dance with Clarence Clemons!

929356667392729090 2017-11-11 14:34:30 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesEFinch Nope. He *signed back up* with the position the next year, and defended McCarthy after his fall. No forgiveness.
929351805795934208 2017-11-11 14:15:11 UTC <Suavebones> @edgeoforever Lieberman - another breathtaking nightmare.

929291317292670976 2017-11-11 10:14:50 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray Understood. My life in the business world involved a fairly high proportion of non-normal and unwanted sexual advances/encounters, though, so experiences differ widely.
929289095406239745 2017-11-11 10:06:00 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray With respect, an astonishing number of men in fact do this stuff. It *does* need highlighting.

929179530371018752 2017-11-10 02:50:38 UTC <Suavebones> Um, no. Not if youre a sentient woman, anyway. He absolutely knew that he was engaging in weirdness and putting women on the spot by making them watch. I neither believe nor accept his apology.

928281317938053120 2017-11-08 15:21:27 UTC <Suavebones> @DemSocialists Oh, no, @cmclymer - I must disagree with you. Lifelong, true-blue Dems are being excoriated by the Bernie-left for being what weve always been. I *will* speak against them.
928280462967037952 2017-11-08 15:18:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Comey @benjaminwittes Yabbut - he follows you, so theres that.

928242617028042753 2017-11-08 12:47:40 UTC <Suavebones> @realHeatherD @_A__Dub @JP1958S Go for it, in all your naivety and tiresome certitude. But it wont happen, and you already know why.

924834655177543680 2017-10-29 03:05:39 UTC <Suavebones> Ty Cobb, 45s lawyer, was so dismayed by 45s Sunday tweets that he had to issue an assurance that they had nothing to do with Mueller.

924807057009549312 2017-10-29 01:15:59 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Not Manafort. His crimes are complex and financial, and are unlikely to have been fully unraveled yet.  Not Stone. Flynn pretty def.

924131540350615552 2017-10-27 04:31:43 UTC <Suavebones> @Kris_Sacrebleu I doubt well see a perp walk - Flynn and Manafort would turn themselves in, and and they are the two most likely to be indicted.

924116867488169985 2017-10-27 03:33:25 UTC <Suavebones> @Susan_Hennessey I think Flynn, because the case against him is the easiest and cleanest - perjury and criminal omissions. The Manafort tentacles go deeper.
924116090392739842 2017-10-27 03:30:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Travis_Brown512 @debimuch No, really, stop, Deb. He is either stupid/delusional or desperate to spread a lie. Either way, you wont persuade him.
924115764453376000 2017-10-27 03:29:02 UTC <Suavebones> @windmillcharger @RedTRaccoon Flynn - the case against him for lies and omissions is straightforward, he will probably plead guilty to it, and has probably rolled on 45.

924110040356732929 2017-10-27 03:06:17 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 Well, I spent 30 years as a lawyer. Do YOU know what a sale is?
924109716598415361 2017-10-27 03:05:00 UTC <Suavebones> I know - sometimes I cant stop myself. Appreciate the advice.
924109455058354176 2017-10-27 03:03:57 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 I knew it. You just dont know what this deal was. You keep saying it was a sale of our uranium to Russia. Wrong, wrong, wrong.
924109030976405504 2017-10-27 03:02:16 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 Meeting with Russians to undermine the election is pretty much the definition of treason. And bribes? Whats your evidence of bribes.
924108661709877249 2017-10-27 03:00:48 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 You honestly think someone sold US uranium to Russia? Please educate yourself about this deal before you say any more ignorant things.
924108296465801217 2017-10-27 02:59:21 UTC <Suavebones> @Travis_Brown512 @JB_Freak1969 True ...
924108090596716544 2017-10-27 02:58:32 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 Russia already has more nuclear bombs than it needs. You really know nothing about the deal, do you? Youre just shouting Hannity-isms.
924107669400469504 2017-10-27 02:56:52 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 Interesting, your use of the phrase no evidence. It seems to overlook a fairly wide array of suspicious meetings with Russians.
924107105170202626 2017-10-27 02:54:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Travis_Brown512 @JoshNoneYaBiz Not a lawyer, are you Josh? Thus, your opinion about what constitutes a crime is about as valuable as used toilet paper.
924106568315969537 2017-10-27 02:52:29 UTC <Suavebones> @JB_Freak1969 @Travis_Brown512 Yes, it *was* cool. He delivered tiny samples.
924105541617467392 2017-10-27 02:48:24 UTC <Suavebones> @grandpoobah13 More like something to cheer about. Mueller filed indictments!
924105149605339136 2017-10-27 02:46:51 UTC <Suavebones> @jjilmary Dont bother. (1) Youre wrong. (2) There is no God.
924104668745052160 2017-10-27 02:44:56 UTC <Suavebones> @ReversingASD Thats my guess, too. The other possibility is Flynn, with respect to his many failures to disclose required information.
924104308030709760 2017-10-27 02:43:30 UTC <Suavebones> Theyre already out and about. Ive squashed two Russian bots and spit on two Fox News persons already.
924103238097412096 2017-10-27 02:39:15 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @ATLUK21 Lol. Bot.
924092799632359425 2017-10-27 01:57:46 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity Mueller JUST FILED THE FIRST CRIMINAL CHARGES. Id say its been a pretty good week for him, but hey, keep up the yammer ...
924091885936828416 2017-10-27 01:54:09 UTC <Suavebones> CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED BY MUELLER!!!
924091703849398272 2017-10-27 01:53:25 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer CRIMINAL CHARGES FILED BY MUELLER!!! Thats the best thing thats happened to me all year!
924006864949452800 2017-10-27 20:16:18 UTC <Suavebones> @JKH2 Basis for saying that about Clinton, please?
923984478002864129 2017-10-27 18:47:21 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm @martin_kj Uranium was not only covered by the media exhaustively four years ago, but was actually investigated. Americans have stunted memories.
923983528898871296 2017-10-27 18:43:34 UTC <Suavebones> @wvjoe911 Was everyone like this prior to the election and I just didnt realize it? I feel as though Ive stepped through the looking glass.
923982261791289344 2017-10-27 18:38:32 UTC <Suavebones> @KagroX You mean men. Men should do their fucking work. The percentage of women sexually harrassing men at work is minute compared to vice versa.
923981530598277120 2017-10-27 18:35:38 UTC <Suavebones> @RhutaBhayga And this was so obvious pre-11/16 that it should have caused every Berniebot to vote for HRC.
923963795600433152 2017-10-27 17:25:09 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @Realjmannarino Speaking of irrelevant, Ive never heard of you.
923954216888016896 2017-10-27 16:47:06 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @PrincessBravato @Mean_Adam Gorka is such a cartoon.
923953620134928385 2017-10-27 16:44:43 UTC <Suavebones> @TheOnlyKAVIN Figures that he volunteered his time to the cause of opposing Terri Schiavos husband. Govt control of personal decisions is his mantra.
923945315979345920 2017-10-27 16:11:44 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @magnificenthack @Michael05663184 Oppo research - done since antiquity in all cultures. Equating oppo to conspiring w/ foreign powers to throw an election is indefensible.
923943744608468992 2017-10-27 16:05:29 UTC <Suavebones> @EnvDefenseFund Theyve been doing it for decades.
923930368809377793 2017-10-27 15:12:20 UTC <Suavebones> @mcp_pol @PeterGleick Disagree. They have always twisted the Constitution for their own ends. It isnt ignorance, but theft of guaranteed rights.
923929402085224448 2017-10-27 15:08:29 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump You are an epic liar.
923928752983236609 2017-10-27 15:05:55 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Agreed, as has been clear for some time.
923926606141276161 2017-10-27 14:57:23 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon Spanish Civil War ll. Good time to stay away from Barcelona.
923926289018265600 2017-10-27 14:56:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Yeah, except one was a lie and the other is true.
923920124033171456 2017-10-27 14:31:37 UTC <Suavebones> @LeChatNoire4 Bwahahahaha!!
923918645247410176 2017-10-27 14:25:45 UTC <Suavebones> @JuddLegum @rowyourbot Well, thanks for an epic example of victim-blaming. Jeez.
923917766913957888 2017-10-27 14:22:15 UTC <Suavebones> @JuddLegum @toaster463 The foundation is a charity - it gets donations from sources worldwide. HRC - unlike 45 - was walled off from the charity while SoS.
923915988747173888 2017-10-27 14:15:11 UTC <Suavebones> @TIME Jon is a bot - ignore.
923911970687823872 2017-10-27 13:59:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Art_Chicken @goodoldcatchy I think that covers it. Well said.
923908937228808197 2017-10-27 13:47:10 UTC <Suavebones> @stellalimelight @latimes Its funny - his favorite word is failing, but Steyer is richer than 45. So wacky is the best he can do.
923809870133866496 2017-10-27 07:13:31 UTC <Suavebones> @PatrickRandall Thank you! I shall do so - Im learning a lot about resistance from you. Well done!
923807314267717632 2017-10-27 07:03:21 UTC <Suavebones> @tragedythyme @PinkCamoTO F*ck em all.
923727767933292544 2017-10-26 01:47:16 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRoot @sulpeno You are closer than you even know. BC chose a medical specialty with (then)  nearly a 100% failure rate. And failed repeatedly.
923727292701974529 2017-10-26 01:45:23 UTC <Suavebones> @LindaLawrey @TheRoot I have seen government leaders with zero experience in the field try to lead. Not pretty.

923726501584842752 2017-10-26 01:42:14 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @Crazyginny @TheEllenShow I just topped up my wine glass in HRCs honor!!
923725809465958400 2017-10-26 01:39:29 UTC <Suavebones> Lets hope to hell that is true.

923724711887908864 2017-10-26 01:35:07 UTC <Suavebones> @CapehartJ What @mooray said. All of it.
923712140762005504 2017-10-26 00:45:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood @MaeveReston I would *really* like it if someone would speak up to note that reporting it is rarely useful, and often not possible (report to whom?).
923709443044282368 2017-10-26 00:34:27 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @BJeanMohr1 He has zero understanding of this and everything else.
923707208889536513 2017-10-26 00:25:34 UTC <Suavebones> @kayleighmcenany Thats a whole lot of BS ideas you strung together there,  Kayleigh. If this is what you got out of your legal training, Im horrified.
923701237261901824 2017-10-26 00:01:51 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @NicPiz My client, a CEO, came up behind me during a Board mtg, reached under my arms and squeezed my breasts. I was the only woman - all laughed.
923698141219627008 2017-10-26 23:49:33 UTC <Suavebones> @suedee714 @Rosie @AltUSPressSec Id never put down the phone if I reached out for help every time 45 and cronies make me doubt the value of living. Its a constant ache.
923697647566729216 2017-10-26 23:47:35 UTC <Suavebones> @LoraBLawrence @Rosie I just have TSD - Im not reliving a trauma, but instead living through it in real time.
923697180908457984 2017-10-26 23:45:44 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesEFinch I may never stop laughing ...!
923695979215200258 2017-10-26 23:40:57 UTC <Suavebones> @TheJWQ looks the same *to them* - sorry
923695629523488768 2017-10-26 23:39:34 UTC <Suavebones> @TheJWQ Gee, paying an investigator to get oppo info looks the same to you as having contacts with a foreign govt to undermine the election? OK.
923694941259173889 2017-10-26 23:36:50 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel @ndrew_lawrence Im pretty sure the Vegas shooter was a Zoroastrian dressed as a pink-striped zebra, which is why nobody shows us photos of the body.
923694416312680449 2017-10-26 23:34:44 UTC <Suavebones> @KellyannePolls Oppo research is legal unless you are paying other countries to find the dirt. That would be treason. Youll need that word soon.
923694044613451781 2017-10-26 23:33:16 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ProudResister @Events4yu Well done!
923693731353583616 2017-10-26 23:32:01 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ProudResister @PamFryer How terrible for your family. My condolences to you all.
923693554832064512 2017-10-26 23:31:19 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @RahDQ98 @ProudResister Thank you for sharing this, and well done on meeting addiction head on, Ryan. May your sails continue to billow with fresh breezes.
923693134931881985 2017-10-26 23:29:39 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Im stunned when a four-star general *isnt* a racist POS.
923692276622094337 2017-10-26 23:26:14 UTC <Suavebones> @CathyWentzel We always laugh when people talk about how *hard* marriage is. Um, no! 
923687922934493190 2017-10-26 23:08:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Slate Speaking as a former airline attorney, sometimes these events *are* race-based. Airlines manage to employ racists, just like everyone else.
923687188734156800 2017-10-26 23:06:01 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @ConnieSchultz Short version: he was always a dick.
923686517658095616 2017-10-26 23:03:21 UTC <Suavebones> @SariHorwitz It is just inconceivable to me what national security interests could possibly remain in play after 55 years.
923686082620751872 2017-10-26 23:01:38 UTC <Suavebones> @CathyWentzel Ive been with the same woman for nearly 42 years. Seconded.
923685678507945984 2017-10-26 23:00:01 UTC <Suavebones> @ACLU Unbelievably odious.
923685174985965568 2017-10-26 22:58:01 UTC <Suavebones> @ianbremmer Guess Im one of the lucky ones - I hated the way opioids made me feel when I was given them after surgery.
923684449434271744 2017-10-26 22:55:08 UTC <Suavebones> @goldengateblond Its not tough to avoid alcohol if youve never been a drinker, just as it isnt tough to avoid smoking if youve never smoked. Jhc
923684028456112128 2017-10-26 22:53:28 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @JustinSteere Voting AGAINST him, ffs. Right?
923670223776911360 2017-10-26 21:58:36 UTC <Suavebones> @BrianPaulStuart Meanwhile, most undocumented immigrants wind up in the US by overstaying legitimate visas. Why dig a tunnel or vault a wall - just buy a tkt
923668669841809408 2017-10-26 21:52:26 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Oh, THIS will be fun.
923666620081364992 2017-10-26 21:44:17 UTC <Suavebones> @jilevin High-flash, low-focus policymaking. Love it.
923665266331992064 2017-10-26 21:38:55 UTC <Suavebones> @ToniC8 @tonyposnanski Remember when the Clintons redecorated and the right wing screeched for years?
923600757105889280 2017-10-26 17:22:34 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland National security experts are not lawyers, so she does not truly know the speed at which the lawyers are moving. Im guessing slower.
923559783617126400 2017-10-26 14:39:45 UTC <Suavebones> @deckape_1 Next stop - very.
923559131964780545 2017-10-26 14:37:10 UTC <Suavebones> @BrentScher @LocPolitics @snozbert 
923557682073579520 2017-10-26 14:31:24 UTC <Suavebones> @NWPinPDX Heartfelt condolences. That is a tough double loss to have to weather.
923556103236984838 2017-10-26 14:25:08 UTC <Suavebones> @BrentScher @LocPolitics @snozbert You misspelled racist, as in publicly recognized racist screed ...
923550660703875073 2017-10-26 14:03:30 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @PeterDawsonUSA Yeah, Im sure self-aggrandizement is the mayors top priority as she and her city swelter in the withering heat with no power or water.
923550081831223297 2017-10-26 14:01:12 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @dadakarma Musk offered his services FOR FREE, and has already re-established power at a couple of important facilities.
923543982251982853 2017-10-26 13:36:58 UTC <Suavebones> @CR @commonsensekev Well, I guess youre on your own, then. I do not recognize that source and can only think it is grossly unreliable.
923542474252939265 2017-10-26 13:30:59 UTC <Suavebones> @commonsensekev I have no idea what a liberty score is, but Im gonna guess its a right wing chop shop.

923539657127706626 2017-10-26 13:19:47 UTC <Suavebones> @commonsensekev Youre really asking what my source is for publicly-recorded votes? GovTrack.us
923536091084238848 2017-10-26 13:05:37 UTC <Suavebones> @commonsensekev I looked at - gasp - his voting record.
923529085950738432 2017-10-26 12:37:47 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @commonsensekev Really? Flake voted hard R 91% of the time. What about that record screams Democrat?
923382965719068672 2017-10-25 02:57:09 UTC <Suavebones> @KaivanShroff She also went to a Seven Sisters college, Wellesley - an Ivy League cognate - where she graduated first in her class.
923372764890664960 2017-10-25 02:16:37 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Zero respect to @maggieNYT, who made a huge to-do over absolutely nothing. Her reputation should be shredded at this point.
923371762787561473 2017-10-25 02:12:38 UTC <Suavebones> @peterbakernyt @MaxBoot @maggieNYT Forget Kelly. We hate you for shivving HRC today in a grossly unprofessional way about an issue of zero import. Crawl back into the slime.
923371348050591744 2017-10-25 02:10:59 UTC <Suavebones> @politicususa @AdamsFlaFan Americans are stone idiots.

923369763434217473 2017-10-25 02:04:41 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato They do indeed.
923369269408043008 2017-10-25 02:02:43 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRickWilson @SilenceExposed John McCain handed the file to the FBI. The info in it is largely confirmed. US Attys d/n use uncorroborated evidence to get FISA warrants.

923342109611921408 2017-10-25 00:14:48 UTC <Suavebones> @teddavid With no respect whatsoever, an enormous number of things men do to women ARE sexual harassment, such as grabbing a womans ass. Hands off!

923328238092353538 2017-10-25 23:19:41 UTC <Suavebones> @leahmcelrath I am going to vomit.
923325362766880768 2017-10-25 23:08:15 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM @RVAwonk @JudyHibel He was an unsuccessful surgeon. He took on the task of separating conjoined twins, which nearly always fails. So when he failed, it was NBD
923323540203376641 2017-10-25 23:01:01 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @DemocryCovenant This is how all small companies get big govt contracts. This method guarantees that the whole thing will cost taxpayers far more than necy
923322767319035905 2017-10-25 22:57:56 UTC <Suavebones> @osullivanauthor I completely agree. I was a government attorney and worked on various crimnal prosecutions with DOJ and the FBI. Nothing happens quickly.
923307732714655745 2017-10-25 21:58:12 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta @JehnetJeh Perhaps plural. He certainly cheated on all of them, and Ivana once claimed he raped her and tore out her hair.
923270834512281600 2017-10-25 19:31:35 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog @cmclymer With respect, the Seven Sisters have always been grouped with Ivy League colleges. And Hillary is a Wellesley grad, 1st in her class.
923265836512567296 2017-10-25 19:11:43 UTC <Suavebones> @moorehn @AngryBlackLady I used to tell my friends the same: if you think hes cheating on you, he probably is.
923262560198995968 2017-10-25 18:58:42 UTC <Suavebones> @mariebuteau35 Your choice, of course. But I would rather wait two weeks with a botched delivery than pay a single nickel to Walmart.
923258943798788097 2017-10-25 18:44:20 UTC <Suavebones> @mitchellvii You are fantasizing.
923257356128960512 2017-10-25 18:38:01 UTC <Suavebones> @Stonekettle Its not. Im thrilled to see him leave.

923249547161120768 2017-10-25 18:06:59 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat Thats an idea, but Im sticking with crazy.

923241689870778368 2017-10-25 17:35:46 UTC <Suavebones> @Alyssa_Milano @joshuamanning23 @BrettPransky @jne7043 @kmlibra @RealityGov @kdpolitics @ThisGroovyMama @Indymom8753 Thats a whole lot of strung-together BS in your statement. Prosecutors do not rely on unverified oppo research to get FISA warrants.
923240900045692928 2017-10-25 17:32:38 UTC <Suavebones> @CapehartJ @bonobobarbie Agreed!
923240397551181824 2017-10-25 17:30:38 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato And Hillary *didnt do it*!
923239693604438016 2017-10-25 17:27:50 UTC <Suavebones> @KPhed This makes me vomit. At best, W is an amiable dunce who let Cheney and other princes of darkness run his govt. At worst, he is stone evil.
923237977769177088 2017-10-25 17:21:01 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta Like the civility he offered to Obama, the Central Park Five, women over the decades, his own spouse, etc? He is what hes always been.
923236422978383872 2017-10-25 17:14:50 UTC <Suavebones> @BenjySarlin What on earth does attending a good college have to do with civility?
923235951912001536 2017-10-25 17:12:58 UTC <Suavebones> @tragedythyme @BBAnimals This is. Terrible freakin idea. Wild animals that are unafraid and overly-friendly are often rabid.
923234339998990336 2017-10-25 17:06:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Wonkette @thepoliticalcat There is something deeply wrong with Maggie. Her Hillary-hate is pathological.
923233631815876608 2017-10-25 17:03:45 UTC <Suavebones> @HHooversGhost Am I missing something? Paying a guy in London to do oppo research is *nothing like* contacting a foreign govt to get help w/ an election.
923232512242892800 2017-10-25 16:59:18 UTC <Suavebones> I imagine Halliburtons no-bid contracts must have driven you up a wall (as they did me).
923213921347018753 2017-10-25 15:45:25 UTC <Suavebones> @Karoli He was always a lying skunk.
923212112649887744 2017-10-25 15:38:14 UTC <Suavebones> @AriFleischer You were the original spokes-liar. A leopard doesnt change its spots.
923211659157450752 2017-10-25 15:36:26 UTC <Suavebones> @JKH2 @JardenWymond Winning a war of personalities? Are you even lightly suggesting that Bernie could have done so, with a personality resembling sandpaper?
923208933166129153 2017-10-25 15:25:36 UTC <Suavebones> @MarisaKabas Its a bot. Ignore.
923153377449590786 2017-10-25 11:44:51 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @_A__Dub Oh, HELL NO. He left the podium and voted to strip consumer rights. He voted agst PR disaster aid 2 weeks ago. Glad to see him go!
923151343115681792 2017-10-25 11:36:46 UTC <Suavebones> @NPR @cmclymer And yet the Bernie coalition keeps demanding Dems fealty. Easy to see from these statistics why that wont happen.
923149791156039681 2017-10-25 11:30:36 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan Flake left the podium, returned to his seat, and voted to strip consumer rights. He also voted against disaster aid for PR. Class A jerk.
923033810924474368 2017-10-24 03:49:44 UTC <Suavebones> @Karoli Even if you read *only* twitter, youd have to be an idiot not to know this info already.
923033191752941569 2017-10-24 03:47:16 UTC <Suavebones> @maggieNYT Lied? LIED? Oh, Maggie, there must be medication that would damp down your Hillary-hatred.
923021211386257408 2017-10-24 02:59:40 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Sure he is - after his speech, he voted with his party to take away consumers ability to sue banks in court.
923019168349171713 2017-10-24 02:51:33 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @windmillcharger @NH92276 You are overly optimistic. He will still be President at this time next year. Dont hope for miracles.
923018326875430912 2017-10-24 02:48:12 UTC <Suavebones> @jaketapper What Democrats did you *think* were involved? Why is this news?
923017727412912128 2017-10-24 02:45:49 UTC <Suavebones> @LaurenWern Just saw the Mark Felt film yesterday, about Watergate. Watching it was a creepy throwback to my youth, but an even eerier look at tomorrow.

923010547800408065 2017-10-24 02:17:17 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump Hes my Senator. His speech today was great, but his actions have *always* been awful.

922907533794205696 2017-10-24 19:27:57 UTC <Suavebones> @DawnMacc Shes my Representative. I cannot concede that she is even a moderate. Ill vote for her over any GOP Senate candidate, but she disappoints.
922904930377129984 2017-10-24 19:17:36 UTC <Suavebones> She is not a centrist or a moderate, by any means.
922904744045056001 2017-10-24 19:16:52 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright A registered Dem who has repeatedly undermined Democratic goals, and actively colluded in pursuing unhealthy GOP goals, is, indeed, a DINO.
922903728331530240 2017-10-24 19:12:50 UTC <Suavebones> @Slate Does the question really need to be asked?

922903087383175168 2017-10-24 19:10:17 UTC <Suavebones> Krysten Sinema has already declared, though sheks a DINO.
922902055982850048 2017-10-24 19:06:11 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @shna23 Hes 85. Lets hope not.
922901911564460032 2017-10-24 19:05:37 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright Kyrsten Sinema has already declared her candidacy. Shes a DINO, but better than the nutcase GOP woman.
922901451541594112 2017-10-24 19:03:47 UTC <Suavebones> @RobinBrenizer Hes also 85 years old.
922899122100637697 2017-10-24 18:54:32 UTC <Suavebones> @samstein Collective sigh of relief from AZ Dems. He may not be a vicious in-fighter, but he still voted to destroy healthcare, agst LGBT tights, etc.

922638410711367680 2017-10-23 01:38:33 UTC <Suavebones> @benjaminwittes She is a very successful self-promoter who holds out breathless promises on which she cannot deliver. Kind of like the Liar-in-Chief.

922552165922619392 2017-10-23 19:55:51 UTC <Suavebones> @mrmcoupe1 You would think someone like you would shut your trap about what a newly-bereaved widow does and does not have time for.
922551463288635394 2017-10-23 19:53:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz Of course, because verbally abusing the good guys is always a spectacularly successful ploy ...

922237592015314945 2017-10-22 23:05:50 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan @thehill You were *an integral part* of the Fox cabal to turn women into sex-bots for viewers delectation, while knowing others had been harassed.
922233253884444672 2017-10-22 22:48:36 UTC <Suavebones> @KaraCalavera Tiresome, unhelpful thread. The WW should shut up and let WOC do all the talking is not productive. We need to work as partners.

921978827508654080 2017-10-21 05:57:36 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon @pinglady727 Not just mine, I see.
921978478102065153 2017-10-21 05:56:13 UTC <Suavebones> @bravenak When you spend 30 years chasing grifters and other financial crooks, you learn to recognize them. So I voted for Hillary, happily.
921928974267064322 2017-10-21 02:39:30 UTC <Suavebones> @RadioFreeTom It is saddening to me.
921928042930323457 2017-10-21 02:35:48 UTC <Suavebones> @robyt13309 @MotherSquid And you! I am pulling for you. Please stay in touch.

921904960798736384 2017-10-21 01:04:05 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia Please find the right outlet for your admirable vigor and enthusiasm. I am not that outlet.
921904480056066048 2017-10-21 01:02:10 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia Sorry - Twitter is not the most effective platform for communicating ideas. Did not mean to bury the lede.
921887283912982529 2017-10-21 23:53:50 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia I have a graduate degree in environmental issues. I have touted nothing - just pointed out that diapers are a vastly larger prob than K cups
921886816671641600 2017-10-21 23:51:59 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia There is very little social value to disposable diapers. Their value is the same as Keurig - time saving selfishness.
921878310342103040 2017-10-21 23:18:11 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia All contribute to pollution - every last one of us.  I am calling out the hypocrisy of trolling one source while contributing to others.
921873783530467328 2017-10-21 23:00:12 UTC <Suavebones> @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump @eileendefreest Just one among many monsters who have taken over our government.  But an awful one, it is true.

921865610144882688 2017-10-21 22:27:43 UTC <Suavebones> @UWantMyVote_Why @RogueSNRadvisor Do the names Captain Queeg and Captain Ahab have some resonance here, perhaps?
921865157071929344 2017-10-21 22:25:55 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @eileendefreest She believes anyone unable to help themselves should rot and die rather than receive any government assistance. It is THIS SIMPLE.
921859789121978368 2017-10-21 22:04:35 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @GenJohnFKelly This is a parody account. Dont waste your breath disputing with it.
921858713895321600 2017-10-21 22:00:19 UTC <Suavebones> @KamalaHarris Happy belated birthday! We are so grateful for your voice and your public service.

921845936141213696 2017-10-21 21:09:32 UTC <Suavebones> @WilDonnelly @Blackbird_write And so f*cking witless ...
921843826343342080 2017-10-21 21:01:09 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Keurig @AmorGaia Guess you didnt use disposable diapers, either?
921843581194665984 2017-10-21 21:00:11 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon Yes. Yes, you are. But I do not judge you. Well, much.
921835167773106176 2017-10-21 20:26:45 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @TheDemCoalition @funder Yo, hon, we old folks pretty much all tweet using the index finger.
921834762141962241 2017-10-21 20:25:08 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @funder @Delaco1Danielle Thumb arthritis - using them is impossible.
921833810823491585 2017-10-21 20:21:22 UTC <Suavebones> @SaraJaneMaki @Kris_Sacrebleu But hey - what about pumpkin pie?
921833142398337024 2017-10-21 20:18:42 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @mooray Exactly. And thanks.
921832571033358336 2017-10-21 20:16:26 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @mooray Sure - with the understanding that this Dem will never, ever support an anti-choice Dem.
921830665267453952 2017-10-21 20:08:52 UTC <Suavebones> @joshuaadamengel Envious. And now hungry.
921829154026274816 2017-10-21 20:02:51 UTC <Suavebones> @democrapssuck Wilson is racist? You meant to say, Wilson is black, and I hate her for that fact alone.
921828619843878912 2017-10-21 20:00:44 UTC <Suavebones> @democrapssuck Race pimp? That would be you, fella, suggesting that a highly educated, successful woman of color should be working at IHOP.
921806208809410560 2017-10-21 18:31:41 UTC <Suavebones> @AHamiltonSpirit Isnt she actually a *physician*?
921714854561320960 2017-10-21 12:28:40 UTC <Suavebones> @ProudResister I am so grateful that my parents didnt live to see Trump in office. It wouldve killed them. 
921713819528740865 2017-10-21 12:24:33 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @faithandfury Im looking for one of the nice ones, with big towers. Is that the sort of thing on offer? 
921592439864881153 2017-10-20 04:22:14 UTC <Suavebones> @shangrilagirl @thehill @BobinHB Not a genuine Time cover, sadly.
921557459948396544 2017-10-20 02:03:14 UTC <Suavebones> @HumanistReport @SeeYunke Misogyny, thy name is Chris Yunke. Ive been following HRC longer than youve been alive, and my admiration for her has only grown.
921552439563640832 2017-10-20 01:43:17 UTC <Suavebones> @HumanistReport @SeeYunke Resist away. It got you 45 last time. Next time, what, nuclear war? Purity progs never get it that they are the problem.
921549162738356224 2017-10-20 01:30:16 UTC <Suavebones> @wpjenna @agearan @bsavid We ask this constantly.
921541564756770821 2017-10-20 01:00:05 UTC <Suavebones> @MalcolmNance @4everNeverTrump @RobinBrenizer USA Today reported that USAF will use this EO to ecall 1000 retired pilots over the next three years, due to combat pilot shortages.

921532617903587328 2017-10-20 00:24:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Kat4Obama @olgaNYC1211 It would take years. We need him to sew up a case *now.*
921529694029103104 2017-10-20 00:12:54 UTC <Suavebones> @TomPerez @clairesandberg Yeah, Brazile told HRC that someone was gonna ask her why the chicken crossed the road. Good thing HRC had time to bone up on the answer ...
921522642091249664 2017-10-20 23:44:53 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @Violetskyye Spot on.
921521830912868352 2017-10-20 23:41:40 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke You wear fake medals, dress like the Village People, and dare to cast stones at Rep. Wilson?
921520929384968192 2017-10-20 23:38:05 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon Not to mention that he is f*cking RETIRED. No longer in the military. Not leading troops.
921520322205048833 2017-10-20 23:35:40 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @faithandfury Say, Ive been thinking about buying a bridge ...
921519732158750720 2017-10-20 23:33:19 UTC <Suavebones> @BrianPaulStuart What can one expect from one whose avatar is an un-ironic Scarlet OHara?
921519156716912641 2017-10-20 23:31:02 UTC <Suavebones> @AprilDRyan @ErinBurnett @SHSanders45 @VABVOX Could you please unpack this tweet a bit?
921516868682203138 2017-10-20 23:21:57 UTC <Suavebones> @HumanistReport @SeeYunke I see youre a janitor. Clean up your attitude.
921514336144605184 2017-10-20 23:11:53 UTC <Suavebones> @stealthygeek I rushed over to dogpile, but he deleted the tweet. Bah, humbug ...
921513709209493505 2017-10-20 23:09:23 UTC <Suavebones> @LiberalLecter @ela33ine Times have changed since that haphazardly-dosed brownie! Read up a bit ... the experience is very different nowadays.
921511247610126336 2017-10-20 22:59:36 UTC <Suavebones> @LiberalLecter @ela33ine Be sure to check out recreational edibles in a legal state near you. 
921510887369797633 2017-10-20 22:58:11 UTC <Suavebones> @LiberalLecter Well, exactly. These grifters only see high as weakness. Kick em in the balls, I say.
921509340875333633 2017-10-20 22:52:02 UTC <Suavebones> @GraceAnne822 @phnel Sorry, I said the same thing, but 40 minutes later. 
921509098570395648 2017-10-20 22:51:04 UTC <Suavebones> @GraceAnne822 Uh, women have intrinsic value as human beings, whether or not they can, will or do bear children.
921478484853010432 2017-10-20 20:49:25 UTC <Suavebones> @Mikel_Jollett @1MikeMorris And a revolting, eight-year campaign of daily monkey and ape slurs against him and his family, which they all bore with immense dignity.
921475495291625472 2017-10-20 20:37:32 UTC <Suavebones> @royaloakie1 @joshtpm Does she have ANY experience in government?
921474699216879616 2017-10-20 20:34:23 UTC <Suavebones> @TimeLordJeff @SarahLerner Full of fucking liars? I think youve underestimated.
921473815476973568 2017-10-20 20:30:52 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady I choose both.
921464582194937856 2017-10-20 19:54:11 UTC <Suavebones> @davidaxelrod @KateEads Kelly lied several times in his comments yesterday.  Lying like a carny barker (45) and lying with dignity (Kelly-does it matter? Both lie.
921463872795508737 2017-10-20 19:51:21 UTC <Suavebones> @matthewjdowd If you are threatening us, gun-humpers, we stand ready to defend.
921463474596622336 2017-10-20 19:49:46 UTC <Suavebones> @davidaxelrod You already have a President who lies constantly. Why would you want a President who lies more eloquently?
921462467045109760 2017-10-20 19:45:46 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke Obama and his family were attacked on a daily basis on spurious, yet outrageous, grounds. He handled it with enormous dignity.
921461858564939776 2017-10-20 19:43:21 UTC <Suavebones> @NormEisen Kelly is RETIRED. He is a civilian. And either way, it is perfectly appropriate to question him when he shows up as a 45 spox.
921432095473377280 2017-10-20 17:45:05 UTC <Suavebones> @pacelattin No need to worry. Its a certainty.
921403393427439616 2017-10-20 15:51:02 UTC <Suavebones> Thank YOU!
921402960332013568 2017-10-20 15:49:19 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCNightlyNews @texasinafrica @MrDavidCarter Cheer up. Most Americans cant even ID the states of their own country on an outline map.
921400255924416512 2017-10-20 15:38:34 UTC <Suavebones> @SheriffClarke @stealthygeek Didnt I see the braying hyenas on FnF yesterday mocking Rep. Wilsons hat? Where are they now?
921367541292843008 2017-10-20 13:28:34 UTC <Suavebones> @PassarelliAllan @RWPUSA Well, that would be a huge, freakin mistake, too, since balancing the budget is a fiction to cut govt services to the poor and needy.
921352197249449984 2017-10-20 12:27:36 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm JJ may be the stupidest and most dishonest woman on earth. No, wait, Michelle Bachman. Oops, no, Sarah Palin. No, Kellyanne. Crap. I give up
921206962120826880 2017-10-19 02:50:29 UTC <Suavebones> @AnnCoulter You are a straight-up racist.
921182388519976960 2017-10-19 01:12:50 UTC <Suavebones> @sunbonnetlee @funder Disagree - he will still be President in the summer of 2018, though I wish it were not so.
921181171274342400 2017-10-19 01:08:00 UTC <Suavebones> @joe_kidder2 @RBReich How hard is it to draft legislation saying Anyone reporting an AGI of more than $X is excluded from this provision?
921180717559660544 2017-10-19 01:06:12 UTC <Suavebones> @ohgodscrewthis @twitersgoodboy Gee, here I am in the eight percent that wishes Bernie would keep withering until he is entirely desiccated,
921172915449503744 2017-10-19 00:35:12 UTC <Suavebones> @WilDonnelly Um, Im embarrassed that this is true, though the coloring is prettier than I suspected ...

921120732016402432 2017-10-19 21:07:50 UTC <Suavebones> @LaurenWern In fact, Kelly is *helping* to politicize Trumps abuse of the families of the fallen. He has no shame and no principles left.
921106534469312512 2017-10-19 20:11:25 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @PrincessBravato @dale_noone Prince - sounds right.
921083475150520320 2017-10-19 18:39:48 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @dale_noone @PrincessBravato The first question that crossed my mind was, WTF were special forces doing in Niger??
921083154185646080 2017-10-19 18:38:31 UTC <Suavebones> @chappie_cat Thank you for reminding me that hope is not stone-cold dead.
921079650452832256 2017-10-19 18:24:36 UTC <Suavebones> @paleofuture The high profile people who were cut were notorious for supporting non-Democrats.
921072926987755520 2017-10-19 17:57:53 UTC <Suavebones> @JenKirkman I think he was vastly out of his depth as President, and knew it, unlike 45. Bush seems far more relaxed now.
920908443287875584 2017-10-19 07:04:17 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer I actually *was* living the dream until Nov 8, 2016. But life now seems weary, stale, flat and unprofitable.
920847104477499392 2017-10-18 03:00:32 UTC <Suavebones> @TomPerez @JKH2 @AlGiordano Good. People who back non-Democrats do *not* belong in the DNC hierarchy.

SCOTUS granted abortion thru 24 weeks in Roe v. Wade. No law has ever extended it.
920790307641237504 2017-10-18 23:14:51 UTC <Suavebones> @goldengateblond @yammerjaw And the unusual eyebrow line is the same ...
920788865954152448 2017-10-18 23:09:07 UTC <Suavebones> @stealthygeek THIS was what you decided to say to the metoo campaign? Maybe rethink.
920788135427981312 2017-10-18 23:06:13 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer It *was* your fault for leaving all those books n the shelves. I hope youve learned your lesson.
920746586509996032 2017-10-18 20:21:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Heritage @realDonaldTrump @AHamiltonSpirit Eleven seems grotesquely low for someone with such an aggressive unwillingness to control his sexual urges.
920744584954576896 2017-10-18 20:13:10 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump Gee, do the Khans and Johnsons have a little sumpin in common besides dead sons, dya think?
920744106296451072 2017-10-18 20:11:16 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA And nuts to Kelly, who is now fully complicit in politicizing his own sons death and calling a Gold Star wife a liar. Zero respect left.

920541619878641664 2017-10-17 06:46:39 UTC <Suavebones> @EdanClay I think we know by now that the Twitterverse can blow holes in our best-intended comments. Keep moving forward. And thank you.

920421337482510337 2017-10-17 22:48:42 UTC <Suavebones> @_chcki Yes, fought back with a baseless point. For the Niger victims who were married, POTUS is contacting their *wives.*
920420458150760448 2017-10-17 22:45:12 UTC <Suavebones> @keithkahn While I understand the thrust of your comment, the sad reality is that sociopathy is either not, or is only barely, treatable.
920420219163516929 2017-10-17 22:44:15 UTC <Suavebones> @lindsey_lulla Even more disturbing, this isnt one of the top ten worst things he has done this WEEK.
920419995347075072 2017-10-17 22:43:22 UTC <Suavebones> @ToriRob11 It is also unconscionable that MSM did not point out POTUS d/n call the parents of *married men* who die. POTUS calls the WIFE.

920362353534758913 2017-10-17 18:54:19 UTC <Suavebones> @abradacabla @nedprice @PragmaticObot @JohnLeyden3 Disagree. Taking the job may have been about honor and preventing disaster, but staying there while his dead son is politicized is on him.

920354696920834048 2017-10-17 18:23:53 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @susanswann99 She seems to have acted as badly as Ann Coulter did, and both over the same thing - a changed seat. Honestly, those two, grow up!
920345836541820929 2017-10-17 17:48:41 UTC <Suavebones> @guardian I not only would, I did.

920345125665902592 2017-10-17 17:45:51 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @susanswann99 I worked for an airline. They dont target passengers, but they *will* kick off mouthy passengers who berate their staff.

920171306942738433 2017-10-16 06:15:10 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @tomwatson Dig her? DIG HER?? Whats the matter with you? She was a fantastic POTUS candidate and you were supposed to vote for, not dig her. Sheesh.
920170712513503232 2017-10-16 06:12:48 UTC <Suavebones> @Piscesboy69 Do you really think most women had anyone to whom they could report HW? Cops will not investigate a grope, a fondle, or a forced kiss.

919994703147175938 2017-10-16 18:33:24 UTC <Suavebones> @bluegal @TheRaDR @TimSEsq @602Erik @Jen_Lamoureux @clapifyoulikeme @_mamadeb I did not invent the term - religious scholars did. It was an efforts to ascrbe certain positive cultural values to two religious streams.
919994351022784512 2017-10-16 18:32:00 UTC <Suavebones> @bluegal @TheRaDR @TimSEsq @_mamadeb @602Erik @clapifyoulikeme @Jen_Lamoureux I believe the effort in the 1940s when the phrase arose among liberal religions was to INCLUDE Jews, who were then marginalized.

919834018811592705 2017-10-16 07:54:54 UTC <Suavebones> @shakesum_99 Sad that you believe this utter BS. Please be smarter than this.
919804197700214784 2017-10-15 05:56:24 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Uh-huh. Meanwhile, I blame you and your code words - centrist, corporatist - for failing to elect the most qualified candidate in history.
919797255397294080 2017-10-15 05:28:49 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT But meanwhile - four years, or eight? - countless people are hurt. Was it worth it to dislike Hillarys stand on TPP so much?
919765905919287297 2017-10-15 03:24:15 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT If only that were true. By executive order, court appointments, and health policy dictates, he is undermining life for millions in the US.
919752000304160768 2017-10-15 02:28:59 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT 2/2 or her incrementalism. People voted for her vision for all Americans health and welfare. Now, we are faced with unremitting horror.
919751040148283392 2017-10-15 02:25:10 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Hillary Clinton was popular with 65 million+ people who didnt believe the lies about her war hawkishness, her dedication to corporatism 1/2
919731101492375552 2017-10-15 01:05:57 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT And I am arguing that, among other things, hawkishness was a lie.
919729659280998400 2017-10-15 01:00:13 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Also, HRC is sane. 45 is not.
919729364614365184 2017-10-15 00:59:02 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT You assume facts not in evidence. Everything I read indicates Trump is trying to provoke Iran on sanctions so he can initiate a war.
919726787143204864 2017-10-15 00:48:48 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT She said we would attack Iran IF IRAN ATTACKED ISRAEL. She was not hawkish - she was doing the governments job of keeping Iran off Israel
919726254172991488 2017-10-15 00:46:41 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Seriously, youre a Bernie bro. Go sell it elsewhere.
919726065123147776 2017-10-15 00:45:56 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Are you aware that Hillary proposed the first single payer health plan 23 years ago?
919725893647450112 2017-10-15 00:45:15 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Are you aware that HRC was, in fact, not particularly pro-Wall St.?
919725711476137984 2017-10-15 00:44:31 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Do you understand that incrementalism is sometimes the only way to get things done?
919725586787921920 2017-10-15 00:44:02 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Do you see value in Trumps efforts to dehumanize gays, transfolk, women, Mexicans, Syrians, refugees?
919725197556461568 2017-10-15 00:42:29 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Do to think HRC would have proposed cutting taxes for the very wealthy?
919725049375891456 2017-10-15 00:41:54 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT The election was never about HRCs views in a vacuum. It was about her views vs. DJTs. Do you really think she wanted war with NK or Iran?

919695221201313792 2017-10-15 22:43:22 UTC <Suavebones> @EBlumberg11 @Karnythia To whom do I complain when the boss backs me into a corner, pinches my breast and kisses me? (Hint - HR was no help)? 2/3
919694949863497728 2017-10-15 22:42:17 UTC <Suavebones> @EBlumberg11 @Karnythia Report TO WHOM? Whom do I tell about the anonymous guy who slipped his hand between my legs on the crowdeed subway? 1/3
919694112294445056 2017-10-15 22:38:58 UTC <Suavebones> @emkayanders Take your medicine or keep lising wasnt snark? Huh. Im out.
919684372428496896 2017-10-15 22:00:15 UTC <Suavebones> @emkayanders Oh, so you just want to be snarky and not actually discuss your points? Got it.
919683159918133248 2017-10-15 21:55:26 UTC <Suavebones> @SarahPalinUSA And every one of them shares the blame.
919682450451599360 2017-10-15 21:52:37 UTC <Suavebones> Very unforgiving, is Twitter!  Drives me crazy every day. 
919682204686467073 2017-10-15 21:51:39 UTC <Suavebones> @emkayanders Are you absolutely sure that it was Dems who failed you? Might it not have been the GOP, determined to block every Dem move over 6 years?
919681506544517120 2017-10-15 21:48:52 UTC <Suavebones> I wasnt being critical. Just adding emphasis to your kind and much-appreciated comment. Thanks for speaking up.
919678855312371712 2017-10-15 21:38:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Alyssa_Milano Me too. As a *very* average-looking young woman, I was sexually assaulted multiple times and harassed more times than I care to recall.
919677385628205056 2017-10-15 21:32:30 UTC <Suavebones> @EricLiptonNYT @wbtphdjd Standing was always the Achilles heel.
919673332965847040 2017-10-15 21:16:23 UTC <Suavebones> *Assaulted* may be just once but I guarantee that harassed involves vastly higher numbers.
919670060888682496 2017-10-15 21:03:23 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @VeeCee30 @sunnyright Um, he wasnt wealthy, but OK.
919669217388982272 2017-10-15 21:00:02 UTC <Suavebones> @techie_too @RhutaBhayga I think @mikefarb1 is trying to make it one.
919668959024070656 2017-10-15 20:59:01 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNPolitics @HarringtonNickT Virtually all the *specific reasons* to dislike Hillary are lies (Benghazi, eg), overblown (speeches to GS), or misogynistic (shrill).
919668409310126080 2017-10-15 20:56:50 UTC <Suavebones> @nebraskaredrose @CNNPolitics Yup. So true.
919666409206030336 2017-10-15 20:48:53 UTC <Suavebones> @faw @jamisonfoser Nettie pots are highly dangerous, and all the other well-meaning advice abt boosting your immune system is woo-woo bunkum. Use @FAWs tips.

919641467097792512 2017-10-15 19:09:46 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 @ericgarland Well, *some* of us believed it ...
919641003371270145 2017-10-15 19:07:55 UTC <Suavebones> No kidding. Find that low-cost clinic for next time. They tend to stock these drugs on-site and provide them at very low cost. Even inhalers
919640206428348416 2017-10-15 19:04:45 UTC <Suavebones> Sounds like the right combo. for success. Hope youre feeling better quickly, and that your cough doesnt last until the next Pres. admin.
919639158884245504 2017-10-15 19:00:36 UTC <Suavebones> @JessicaValenti I was never a beauty, and literally cannot count the number of times I have sexually harassed. I was also sexually assaulted a dozen times.
919638207779586048 2017-10-15 18:56:49 UTC <Suavebones> @EtonOldBoys But I do - hahahaha!!!
919637709869551616 2017-10-15 18:54:50 UTC <Suavebones> So sorry. Find a low-cost clinic, if you can, and get prednisone for the cough.
919617951006842880 2017-10-15 17:36:19 UTC <Suavebones> @StollmeyerEU This is just awful.

919429886929879040 2017-10-14 05:09:01 UTC <Suavebones> @mikefarb1 Spooky? More like criminal.
919418435041345536 2017-10-14 04:23:31 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Gotcha - thanks.

919414148533952512 2017-10-14 04:06:29 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @mar_de_palabras @WilliamPecota @sukatra This piece talks about Waters prior comments as a convention theme, and about her voice, but nowhere is she IDd as an actual speaker.

919391764657553409 2017-10-14 02:37:32 UTC <Suavebones> @BillOReilly @THRMattBelloni @khaylock @Nomawrites Thanks for inserting irrelevant facts into this fact-based discussion.
919390140828565505 2017-10-14 02:31:05 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock As I say, it could turn out that way. But he has tried hard to separate himself from HW for many years, so I think there is room for doubt.
919385496299569154 2017-10-14 02:12:38 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Who *bragged on tape* about gleefully committing multiple sexual assaults.
919384463015948288 2017-10-14 02:08:31 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock Bob was not staff. He worked for the last 12 years far apart from HW and Weinstein Co. Nobody has yet tied Bob to any longstanding HW info
919384083196547072 2017-10-14 02:07:01 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock I used to do internal corp. investigations. Your conclusion may ultimately turn out to be correct, but at the moment, you lack evidence. 1/2
919379010626273287 2017-10-14 01:46:52 UTC <Suavebones> @WomenintheWorld @LyndaKMitsakos @bearingleft Im sorry to hear that the new generation is so pig-ignorant.
919377504896299008 2017-10-14 01:40:53 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon I blame you, Susan Sarandon. You had a powerful voice and abused it in the 2016 election. Nobody decent will ever listen to you again.
919374639540846593 2017-10-14 01:29:29 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock HWs lawyer said the Board was only told about 3 or 4 settlements in 2015, years after the misconduct.
919374393117089792 2017-10-14 01:28:31 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock You have never served on a Board, have you? The Board tends to know jack about corporate affairs. /1
919365597502193666 2017-10-14 00:53:34 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan I had to shake Ken Starrs hand in a professional context a few years ago. My fingers still twitch occasionally.
919358133201338368 2017-10-14 00:23:54 UTC <Suavebones> @Shaker_aphra Bernie said Hillary was not qualified to be President. Isnt that more than enough?http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/06/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-qualified/index.html
919338862110842880 2017-10-14 23:07:19 UTC <Suavebones> @FiyaSturm @attn @ChocnessMonsta At the risk of being accused of not-all-ism, I do not have any family members who believe this swill. But yeah, former friends. Sickening.
919338440566620160 2017-10-14 23:05:39 UTC <Suavebones> @Saintsfan5348 @attn I have a generally-liberal friend who horrified me by expressing these same ideas. How has this utter sh*t infected our society so deeply?
919337676632813568 2017-10-14 23:02:37 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan May he rot in a dark, damp cell.
919337245248598016 2017-10-14 23:00:54 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @Secular_Rose Trump. I do not acknowledge any gods.
919335966262693888 2017-10-14 22:55:49 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @Secular_Rose I was never anything else - not raised in a religious household, and from early childhood, could not reconcile god with how life worked.
919335300156887040 2017-10-14 22:53:10 UTC <Suavebones> @Secular_Rose @LFaraday My sense is that he is utterly detached from actual people. He has no sense of himself as part of a community or society, and lacks empathy.
919334838032674816 2017-10-14 22:51:20 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @Secular_Rose Thanks, Rose. 
919332671221743616 2017-10-14 22:42:43 UTC <Suavebones> @Secular_Rose @LFaraday Ocare saved my life when I got ditched from a job at age 57, couldnt get individ. insurance bec. of pre-xisting condit., & got sick. Grrr.

919331344110333952 2017-10-14 22:37:27 UTC <Suavebones> @Secular_Rose @LFaraday Same here. Looking at different residency options - being gay, female, atheist, & a senior citizen is a pretty large target on my back in US
919330557258952704 2017-10-14 22:34:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Secular_Rose @LFaraday Yes indeed. Religion consumes societies whole. It appears to be on the brink of doing so again, this time in the US.

919330025819668480 2017-10-14 22:32:13 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @Secular_Rose Iran used to be known as Persia. Persia was a center of scientific learning and innovation for 1,000 years or more.

919321691347496961 2017-10-14 21:59:06 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato Now *there* is a program that is physically impossible to watch.
919320388676419584 2017-10-14 21:53:55 UTC <Suavebones> @stealthygeek He describes himself as a political amateur. All comments should be read in light of his self-assessment.
919315970757337088 2017-10-14 21:36:22 UTC <Suavebones> @underchilde @LFaraday Thank you. And thanks too for your affirming tweet. People need to hear validation.
919314068418150400 2017-10-14 21:28:48 UTC <Suavebones> @MapattonMike Id like to introduce you to several gay dads and several single dads I know, wonderful fathers all. You would change your mind.
919312813163606016 2017-10-14 21:23:49 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock When you know the answer to whether Harvey paid settlements *out of his own pocket* or involved the Board in any way, get back to me.
919307175255711744 2017-10-14 21:01:25 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @underchilde I figured this out in my youth, and am damned glad I did. Euphorically happy with my partner/wife of 41 years.
919306820723675136 2017-10-14 21:00:00 UTC <Suavebones> @creynoldsnc Oh, that is CLEARLY what Gorka meant. The whole Trump cult is euphoric at the idea of damaging and restricting a free society.

919302873174786048 2017-10-14 20:44:19 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @TheAcademy @brianstelter The only sad part of this is the sure and certain knowledge that other Hollywood sexual predators voted to expel HW.
919302568810987520 2017-10-14 20:43:06 UTC <Suavebones> @AGSchneiderman Mr. Schneidermann, you and Mr. Mueller are the ones to save us. Thank you, and godspeed to you both.
919301944467906560 2017-10-14 20:40:38 UTC <Suavebones> @Millennial_Dems Lets be even clearer - the percentage of men who casually abuse women sexually is surprisingly large. Those guys exist in EVERY office.
919301169427517440 2017-10-14 20:37:33 UTC <Suavebones> @Cernovich Were electrodes attached to his testicles as he tweeted this?

919300315941236736 2017-10-14 20:34:09 UTC <Suavebones> @Green_Footballs If thats a threat from the right, this Resister will be on the front lines to defend against that threat.
919282986570227712 2017-10-14 19:25:18 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @dannykaea Theres a difference between knowing your brother is a sex hound and knowing he is an abuser/rapist.
919282755191521280 2017-10-14 19:24:22 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @HenryRychlicki Definite bot.
919282593090093056 2017-10-14 19:23:44 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @rubytuesday1985 So? That applies to about a quarter of the men Ive ever met. Why is it Bobs business to keep Harvey from cheating?
919282341859680259 2017-10-14 19:22:44 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @khaylock You have a comprehension problem. Bob knew his brother was a serial cheater. That is worlds different from knowing he was a rapist/abuser.
919281893404581888 2017-10-14 19:20:57 UTC <Suavebones> @THRMattBelloni @ShaghineLZ Did you read the article? Bob worked mostly in a different company on the oppisite coast. It was not under his nose.
919279442681217024 2017-10-14 19:11:13 UTC <Suavebones> @tedcruz Clinton Foundation is a highly ranked CHARITY. Does it matter whether Weinsteins m9bey goes to *this* charity vs. *another* charity?
919276123556478976 2017-10-14 18:58:01 UTC <Suavebones> @ProudResister Nicely said.
919273645834248192 2017-10-14 18:48:11 UTC <Suavebones> Well, lets hope ...

919259071005450240 2017-10-14 17:50:16 UTC <Suavebones> @BCapJe @ambertamblyn Then why is Bernie the only speaker getting HEADLINES? Jhc, Amber - the man is poison.

918871355315044352 2017-10-13 16:09:37 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis The women bosses were emotionally abusive, but not sexual harassers. So theres that.
918870826136485888 2017-10-13 16:07:31 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @JoyAnnReid I agree with Rick Wilson - 45 thinks Puerto Ricans are Sea Mexicans.

918471116733038592 2017-10-12 13:39:13 UTC <Suavebones> @LarrySabato I dont believe it. It would be malpractice-level stupid to let 45 speak to criminal investigators.

918228906544545792 2017-10-11 21:36:45 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland When my mom was a young typist, her boss would come up behind her and slip his hand over her shoulder and into her blouse. This was 1932.

918166574552432640 2017-10-11 17:29:04 UTC <Suavebones> @pacelattin @BridgetPhetasy Yes, thanks. Way too many icky memories. Men dont realize quite how often we get molested and harassed.
918166224361492480 2017-10-11 17:27:41 UTC <Suavebones> @a2mech2000_k @laurenduca Drat, you just reminded me that Cillizza exists. Now I have to spin around three times and spit over my shoulder.
918115473186725888 2017-10-11 14:06:01 UTC <Suavebones> @dickensgirl @NatashaBertrand Fine. Let him waste his time on what is certain to be a fruitless enterprise. Keeps him off the streets and out of the way.
918114344218406913 2017-10-11 14:01:32 UTC <Suavebones> @KatrinaNation Hope he has more success in Russia than he did with Bernie.
918109200034570240 2017-10-11 13:41:05 UTC <Suavebones> @StephMillerShow @ShaunKing Not sure which we youre referring to, but it sure as fuck doesnt include me.
918108683426344960 2017-10-11 13:39:02 UTC <Suavebones> @Greg_Palast @Wade_Turnbull @SallyAlbright @KrisK75USMC @JenBCurly @my_random_name @onekickpony @RosettaDrone @lumpylouise @icyjuicy @sturghall @PJSkinman @Plantsmantx @gabiporter @Bluepurplerain @steveajohnson @Waorguy @Ellahbie @Mellintex @jackisfashtrash I d/n support him because he is the latest in a long line of men with ideas who have no ways of implementing them. Hes a waste of time.
918106125538549762 2017-10-11 13:28:52 UTC <Suavebones> @GovHowardDean @davidfrum Thanks for the necessary injection of deepest sarcasm into my day. Tweets like these are keeping me from drowning in utter BS.
918104163233304576 2017-10-11 13:21:04 UTC <Suavebones> @CillizzaCNN @KikiHavens Im expecting to spontaneously combust from sheer fury any day now.
917942818298933248 2017-10-10 02:39:57 UTC <Suavebones> @pacelattin You *do not have a clue.* From ages 12-45, I was sexually assaulted by a moving man, 3 bosses, a dentist, 2 clients, and Im a solid 5.
917940710073974785 2017-10-10 02:31:34 UTC <Suavebones> @jonfavs @RonanFarrow @thomaslbenfield @ChrJMHoffmann First job, age 21: boss took me on a biz trip, told me to pick him up at his room for dinner. Asked me to step in, assaulted me. No setup.
917921185295319041 2017-10-10 01:13:59 UTC <Suavebones> @JaimiHajzus @MeritLaw Thank you. Of the four million things that outraged me today, Harris arrest was at the top of the list.
917835102733746176 2017-10-10 19:31:55 UTC <Suavebones> @LaurenWern Trump defending a rapist ... of course he did. ARGHHHHHHHH!!!
917769795755323392 2017-10-10 15:12:25 UTC <Suavebones> @ErinBurnett Why does Hillary have any obligation to say something about Harvey? If she does, the hyenas will be shrieking about Bill.
917544811527266304 2017-10-09 00:18:24 UTC <Suavebones> @copperbird7 @mindbodythought Nope. Some animals are just jerks, all by themselves, with nobody helping. Kinda like some people ...
917544499051601920 2017-10-09 00:17:10 UTC <Suavebones> @brooksbarnesNYT @peterbakernyt Excuse me, why must everyone be forced to vomit forth an opinion every time something reprehensible happens? Why is their opinion ur biz?
917543750427013120 2017-10-09 00:14:11 UTC <Suavebones> Excuse me, but if you think youre a patriot, you need a better dictionary.
917542095207804928 2017-10-09 00:07:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Kantrowitz @BuzzFeedBen @fwd Good, because what she was saying is an infamous lie.
917537561521696768 2017-10-09 23:49:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Becky_Brown09 @USA_FANS_CLUB This cheered up my whole day. 
917531277879762944 2017-10-09 23:24:38 UTC <Suavebones> @jemelehill @deray @earthdogelevena Thanks - and may I also say, how freaking infuriating.
917493555072983040 2017-10-09 20:54:44 UTC <Suavebones> @jemelehill @deray @earthdogelevena Not the smaller question (I know why), but the larger question of just wtf does ESPN think it is communicating by this action?
917492781060284416 2017-10-09 20:51:39 UTC <Suavebones> @jemelehill @earthdogelevena @deray Um, why??
917492600575115264 2017-10-09 20:50:56 UTC <Suavebones> @melsil Sure, blame Meryl, who says he never assaulter her. Makes sense. 
917439943206510594 2017-10-09 17:21:42 UTC <Suavebones> @uctelevision @SallyRideSci @Old_Privateer You mean, two brilliant women with Ph.Ds who had more positive impact on the world than you ever will. Mind your manners.
917439576326545408 2017-10-09 17:20:14 UTC <Suavebones> @uctelevision @SallyRideSci What a terrific presentation!
917254089439830017 2017-10-08 05:03:11 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Truly hard to imagine *this much stupidity.*
917232332641206273 2017-10-08 03:36:44 UTC <Suavebones> @bab_tinkerbell Thanks. Im a retired lawyer. But not a liar.
917215556096352259 2017-10-08 02:30:04 UTC <Suavebones> @bab_tinkerbell Wasnt visible on my version of the thread. And if you think I was disgustingly nasty, you are going to face some tough times in life
917209050907000832 2017-10-08 02:04:13 UTC <Suavebones> @bab_tinkerbell Wherever your conversation was occurring, it wasnt in Walt Scaubs thread. You brought it here with you.
917197629066403841 2017-10-08 01:18:50 UTC <Suavebones> Best laugh of the day! Thanks, @waltshaub !
917195655373660160 2017-10-08 01:10:59 UTC <Suavebones> @bab_tinkerbell Bar rules do *not* require disclosure, other than to clients, courts or litigants. And you dragged this unrelated issue into the thread.
917192968477450241 2017-10-08 01:00:18 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @waltshaub @Fly_Sistah @bab_tinkerbell Stalking people, are you? KDs response did not require a law degree, regardless of whether she has one. Piss off and stop harassing her.
917180069692370944 2017-10-08 00:09:03 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier Arent you just the whiniest? If you are so unhappy, go ahead and block me. Not sure why you are awaiting my action.
917174971314593792 2017-10-08 23:48:48 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @fowerli Baloney. Matt never misses a chance to turn an issue into anti-Hillary mudslinging.
917174438176497664 2017-10-08 23:46:40 UTC <Suavebones> @Eykis @AngryBlackLady Matt hates Hillary, and uses any excuse to go after her. Even a moronic excuse like this one.
917173818006704133 2017-10-08 23:44:13 UTC <Suavebones> @jilevin I dont care. Not even a teensy bit.
917171752945324032 2017-10-08 23:36:00 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier No thanks. Not interested in reading more. Your Bernie fellow travelers were noisy last election, and I thought it was BS then, too.
917136933490323456 2017-10-08 21:17:39 UTC <Suavebones> @BirdsGetStarted These felons ...
917135940803371008 2017-10-08 21:13:42 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier You are seriously comparing Bernies accomplishments to those of Mandela and MLK? Look, I cant discuss this with you any more.
917130785492148224 2017-10-08 20:53:13 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier Its more hallucination than vision if he cant get traction. And he cannot, so he is wasting our time.
917125554150588416 2017-10-08 20:32:26 UTC <Suavebones> @nothsarw @ACLU We need you, ACLU, to challenge these nightmare guidelines.
917123086964613120 2017-10-08 20:22:37 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel In Bruges Garda Lone Star Snatch Singin in the Rain
917117716640575488 2017-10-08 20:01:17 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @agentscullygr Costing taxpayer money, all the while pissing on the 1st A. Nice.
917116405077614592 2017-10-08 19:56:04 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady Seems like a very odd reversal ...
917115968274423808 2017-10-08 19:54:20 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier I do not care what Bernie *wants.* I care that, throughout a long career, Bernie has rarely *delivered.* This inability makes him toxic.
917107764735836160 2017-10-08 19:21:44 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @Eykis @AnnaPottier And I cant stand Bernie-bots. So theres that.
917100568706826240 2017-10-08 18:53:09 UTC <Suavebones> @GregCowboys I see your point, but the law makes no mention of statutory rape.
917099576665956352 2017-10-08 18:49:12 UTC <Suavebones> @GregCowboys To ban custody, that law RQs women to *prove,* by clear and convincing evidence that they were raped. Impossible standard, useless law.
917097549642702848 2017-10-08 18:41:09 UTC <Suavebones> @SecondLady @VP You *really* dont get the whole 1st Amenndment thing, do you, @realDonaldTrump, #FakePresident?

917095187758825472 2017-10-08 18:31:46 UTC <Suavebones> @KaraCalavera @GregCowboys Not the judges fault. Its state law. Vote out these craven legislators.
917095033412534272 2017-10-08 18:31:09 UTC <Suavebones> @KaraCalavera TWENTY-EIGHT STATES award custody to rapists, 7 by affirmative law and 21 by RQing a rape *conviction* to deny parental rights.
917094316471812096 2017-10-08 18:28:18 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis @stuartpstevens Money, honey.

917089920094580736 2017-10-08 18:10:50 UTC <Suavebones> @Eykis @AngryBlackLady @AnnaPottier No chance. Bernie isnt a Dem, and I am.
917070418158034944 2017-10-08 16:53:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Fidelity @FortuneMagazine Turfed out on my 57th birthday. Surprisingly (!), nobody was hiring older women. So - retired involuntarily.
917030031024472064 2017-10-08 14:12:51 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos He (mis-) uses quotes for emphasis.
917029468501192704 2017-10-08 14:10:37 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @JHowieJr @dumptrump33 @SharNeal You just keep inventing those little lies, hon. Lazy and ill wrote and promoted a best seller while 45 was golfing.
917028477848584196 2017-10-08 14:06:41 UTC <Suavebones> @JillFilipovic Folks, check your own states laws. 28 states support joint custody for rapists. THIS is what happens when we ignore local elections.
916936239449653248 2017-10-08 08:00:09 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan @JustNelse Agreed. It is nothing less than a blatant effort to subjugate women.
916933798457090048 2017-10-08 07:50:28 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan @JustNelse Tell that to voters of 28 states that either affirmatively grant parental rights to rapists or deny such rights only w/ a conviction.
916931404864172032 2017-10-08 07:40:57 UTC <Suavebones> @itsboyschapter @ZeldaLackner Arenkt they pretty much the same thing?

916928892140580864 2017-10-08 07:30:58 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan Its the law in nearly half the states.

916817452893274112 2017-10-07 00:08:09 UTC <Suavebones> @ProudResister Its likely this was a closed hearing about objections to/refusal to comply with a GJ subpoena. Says zero re imminence of indictments.

916807713740308480 2017-10-07 23:29:27 UTC <Suavebones> Because sexual predators are everywhere, I guarantee you hobnob with sexual predators, @CillizzaCNN - what are YOU going to do about it?

916480963206569984 2017-10-06 01:51:03 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis John, find a woman who hasnt been sexually assaulted, harassed or both. I dare you. This country has a HIGH tolerance for mens misbehavior
916480397029949440 2017-10-06 01:48:48 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Interview 20 women and youll hear a number of stories like this, and worse. Tons of men *feel free* to impose their sexual will on women.

914903252944134144 2017-10-02 17:21:48 UTC <Suavebones> @HowardKurtz Statistics show mass shootings occur almost daily in this country. By your logic, there is literally never a time to discuss gun control.

914844980903997440 2017-10-02 13:30:15 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer No, because there is no amendment guaranteeing the right to drive cars. No parallel.

914256242989703168 2017-09-30 22:30:49 UTC <Suavebones> @KaraCalavera @frodofied @SophieInCT I maintain that a small part of the angst of the #Resistance is that our language does not contain enough words to express the horror of 45.
914252130453659648 2017-09-30 22:14:28 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump And where were you for the last nine days? Every single person in one PR towns ICU *died* due to lack of timely aid. You own those deaths.

914249960555651072 2017-09-30 22:05:51 UTC <Suavebones> Said by Nelson M. Rosarios father, who is currently in PR. This is absolutely horrifying, though not entirely surprising, given Trump.https://twitter.com/nelsonmrosario/status/914220569402281985
914221923420168193 2017-09-30 20:14:26 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Videos are not convincing you that PR is in the midst of a catastrophe?? Whats wrong with you?
914220468902576128 2017-09-30 20:08:39 UTC <Suavebones> @maggieNYT What is wrong with you, Maggie? Trump is THE most profligate politician *in history.* His expenditures on himself/family are mind-boggling.
914218989336780800 2017-09-30 20:02:47 UTC <Suavebones> @VABVOX Is he saying (together with his earlier tweet) that the [white] people of VI are working hard, but the [brown] people of PR are not? Vomit.

912795621924278272 2017-09-26 21:46:49 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias I just cannot believe how far you will run to avoid placing blame on necessary parties for the Clinton email baffle-gas.
912793098295455744 2017-09-26 21:36:48 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @NateSilver538 @DianneInIndiana Exactly the way *you* make *us* sick.

912788221653745664 2017-09-26 21:17:25 UTC <Suavebones> @USMC_DD We had one. It was called Charlottesville.
912750541570113536 2017-09-26 18:47:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Sammysgranny @JesseLehrich The huge, medical COMFORT ship was still at its mainland port yesterday. Why wasnt it deployed immediately??
912749146053918720 2017-09-26 18:42:09 UTC <Suavebones> @davidduchovny @GillianA @holasmitha @Ambithera @BryanDMcNally Apparently you never thought about what you were fighting for. Flag/anthem symbolize our Constitution, which protects the right to protest.
912747015246831616 2017-09-26 18:33:41 UTC <Suavebones> @AndyRichter Trumps response - and lack of timely aid - to PR is overtly racist.
912746509535289344 2017-09-26 18:31:40 UTC <Suavebones> @SamanthaJPower Call this lack of response to the PR apocalypse what it is, MSM - pure RACISM by 45.
912460628295479296 2017-09-25 23:35:41 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @thebradfordfile Apparently you havent read that he did not mean to stand, has apologized for doing so, and is in full sympathy with his black teammates?
912459084560920576 2017-09-25 23:29:33 UTC <Suavebones> @imillhiser Annnddd ... you are not a woman, clearly.
912457943227940865 2017-09-25 23:25:00 UTC <Suavebones> @macmommamary Fine. Be a fool. We dont care.
912445108829560833 2017-09-25 22:34:01 UTC <Suavebones> @TheBradMielke Yeah, and hockey is almost entirely white, so of course the Penguins are going to the White House.

912443522208243712 2017-09-25 22:27:42 UTC <Suavebones> @brianklaas I am still agog that this happened. He is SUCH a danger, not only to the US, but the whole freakin world.

912193986676191232 2017-09-24 05:56:08 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump This would be the flag you and your compatriots have been so willing to sell off to Russia? That flag?
912192238494433280 2017-09-24 05:49:12 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson Due to 45, I started drinking, cannot sleep, gained weight, stopped the gym, and think semi-seriously about suicide every day. Im rotting.

912111003533434880 2017-09-24 00:26:24 UTC <Suavebones> @qjurecic You forget - they simply lie, all the time.
912109082168909824 2017-09-24 00:18:46 UTC <Suavebones> @Breaking911 Its not an anthem protest, nutsack. Its a protest of police killings of POCs. It takes place during the anthem. Big difference.
912108128153485312 2017-09-24 00:14:58 UTC <Suavebones> @SabrinaSiddiqui @ChristineCSE And both are double-dipped theft from the US taxpayer.

912105415608983552 2017-09-24 00:04:11 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump #LoserPresident, you are a stone liar. Arizona would be terribly damaged by this awful Graham-Cassidy bill, and you know it. #LyingPOTUS
912080717416251392 2017-09-24 22:26:03 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @Mikel_Jollett @tribelaw Exactly.
912080072110047233 2017-09-24 22:23:29 UTC <Suavebones> Please help make #LoserPresident trend.
912079876869328896 2017-09-24 22:22:42 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump #LoserPresident fails to understand that protest DOES honor and respect our flag. The flag flies to protect *that very right,* among others.
912077565933715456 2017-09-24 22:13:31 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump @PageV503 Lets hope Mueller can tie it all together.
912076398193291264 2017-09-24 22:08:53 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump @PageV503 Probably a civil violation, not a criminal one, unless someone could prove that he was hiding data involving illegality (such as collusion)
912075932021567492 2017-09-24 22:07:02 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump I forced out a judge advocate general of the Air Force who hid documents from the federal system of records. Kushner better watch it.
912075260903772161 2017-09-24 22:04:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent @superhotnoodles What acting are you talking about? He got a second citizenship, and has not said a word about Brexit.
912074802592079872 2017-09-24 22:02:33 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent Kind of a misleading headline - he now has dual citizenship.

912025230062764032 2017-09-24 18:45:34 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Importantly, the Penguins are almost entirely a *white* team.

912023654124285952 2017-09-24 18:39:18 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @naretevduorp Of course. Practically the whole Penguins line-up is *white.*

911680836050677760 2017-09-23 19:57:04 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 OK. Peace, my friend. We both want the same thing - Trump etc. out of office.
911679704024752128 2017-09-23 19:52:34 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Fine. You dont have to like his politics. But you do have to respect his civil rights. Its really that simple.
911679125353512960 2017-09-23 19:50:16 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 I dont see how undermining Kaepernicks civil rights advances any goal of yours.
911678685224112128 2017-09-23 19:48:31 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Sweetie, Ive been supporting civil rights since before you were born, work actively to register voters and never fail to vote myself.
911678377932623872 2017-09-23 19:47:18 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 By all means, object to what he says. But you have zero basis to critique his manner of protest. Conflating the two is wrong.
911677385048821760 2017-09-23 19:43:21 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 I am anti-Bernie, but I wont try to upend someones civil rights because of their political preferences. You shouldnt either.
911676670922199040 2017-09-23 19:40:31 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Kneeling is his personal protest against racial injustice. If the protest is peaceful, its none of your business how he goes about it.
911675733994463232 2017-09-23 19:36:47 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump An NFL player has the same rights of protest as everyone else. But bums like you never understand civil rights ...

909949969129390080 2017-09-18 01:19:13 UTC <Suavebones> @johnpavlovitz The people I know who voted for Trump believed a ton of lies about Clinton's integrity, while believing none of the facts about Trump's.

909769934531526658 2017-09-18 13:23:49 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @konrad_jeff @RonaldKlain @rhonda_harbison I actually brought down a Judge Advocate General of the Air Force over the 'documents in his safe.' You betcha Mueller is drooling.
909761308077170688 2017-09-18 12:49:33 UTC <Suavebones> And ... you have no sense of humor. The Spicer bit was terrific. He's still an all-time champion liar, but it was funny to see him own up.
909758478666809344 2017-09-18 12:38:18 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat Oh, this makes me sad. I strongly disagree. Why do you think he's a traitor?
909633281427046400 2017-09-17 04:20:49 UTC <Suavebones> @funder No. No we will not. Probably not in 2018, either. You KNOW Mueller will take many more months - stop over-hyping.
909532547868012544 2017-09-17 21:40:32 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @bluedgal Yup. Seth hit my "no view" list with this one.
909527982812758017 2017-09-17 21:22:23 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost Oh, please stop with this nonsense. You are an internationally regarded news organ, not "US" magazine.

909136597379014657 2017-09-16 19:27:10 UTC <Suavebones> @TonyVarona @ReginaA1981 @marshall5912 That Bernie keeps swimming upstream on these issues *does not make the issues viable.* He is unsuccessful bec. the public d/n support them.

909104194585427968 2017-09-16 17:18:24 UTC <Suavebones> In a world of political dragging, this light-hearted rivalry cheered my day.https://twitter.com/independent/status/909100823598075904
909096703948550144 2017-09-16 16:48:39 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray I think we all internalized a lot of this stuff - how else was one to go about daily life?
909095846053941248 2017-09-16 16:45:14 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray Perhaps that's true to some extent. But mostly, I was mad as hell, and decided to go to law school to help find equity for women.
909094826154483713 2017-09-16 16:41:11 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray How well I remember.
908862676029161473 2017-09-15 01:18:42 UTC <Suavebones> @cmclymer I am white, a retired federal lawyer and a person of firm convictions, and I am calling Trump a white supremacist.
908858619906580481 2017-09-15 01:02:35 UTC <Suavebones> @DAVHQ @HanekkoTanaka Oh, is that all? Pfffttt.
908858372589420544 2017-09-15 01:01:36 UTC <Suavebones> @chargrille @NateSilver538 Correct about WI. Wrong about Bernie, who came equipped with supporters who parroted GOP lies about HRC, which hurt her in liberal circles.
908857695620313088 2017-09-15 00:58:55 UTC <Suavebones> @WeeeeeSquirrel @jonfavs Then WTF is she doing in the WH with the title "Senior Advisor to the President"???
908856955099160577 2017-09-15 00:55:58 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Clinton toasted your coconuts in the debates. But don't let me disturb your fantasy.
908826493513379840 2017-09-15 22:54:55 UTC <Suavebones> @noelcourage @cbouzy Contains its own answer - people *didn't* listen to Hillary.
908702540253900800 2017-09-15 14:42:23 UTC <Suavebones> I'm a retired lawyer, and I am calling Trump a white supremacist.
908572406452592640 2017-09-14 06:05:16 UTC <Suavebones> @EleanorRigbyATX @dumptrump33 It's not cuffs - just a spectacularly poor hemming job that left lots of visible stitches.
908570381505544192 2017-09-14 05:57:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JamilesLartey @SafetyPinDaily Untrue. I have no expectations of Ivanka, yet she still manages to disappoint me.
907986350304980994 2017-09-13 15:16:30 UTC <Suavebones> @SafetyPinDaily So sorry ...
907931008305000448 2017-09-13 11:36:35 UTC <Suavebones> @suejohnston56 @brianschatz It's free.
907928621129490432 2017-09-13 11:27:06 UTC <Suavebones> @Shinlogos666 @TeaPainUSA Let's see - Comey is a lawyer and was FBI Director. Would he "leak" documents if he knew it to be illegal? Of course not.
907927761427165185 2017-09-13 11:23:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Tracydwyer7 @sahluwal Um, white *male* supremacy.
907926153146462209 2017-09-13 11:17:18 UTC <Suavebones> @Shinlogos666 @DrDenaGrayson Since when does the CIA Director take political meetings with foreign leaders?!?
907925445764571136 2017-09-13 11:14:29 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone Nope. To heck with America - I'm all amp, all the time!
907785737621315585 2017-09-12 01:59:20 UTC <Suavebones> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Auburngirlx @neesietweets @mrshellwinger @TomIarocci Bullshit, doc. The *only* fetuses aborted at that late stage are those with grievous problems and those that will cause the mother to die.
907785362725937154 2017-09-12 01:57:50 UTC <Suavebones> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Auburngirlx @neesietweets Oh dear god, there is nothing about this tweet that is real. The baby is *premature,* not aborted. Comment attributed to the doctor? A lie.
907785005677502464 2017-09-12 01:56:25 UTC <Suavebones> @DonaldJTrumpJr @nadabakos @neesietweets @PMc276 @Auburngirlx And ... it's a lie.
907763912963088384 2017-09-12 00:32:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Prudential @kalamarides I had occasion to sue Prudential on behalf of S & L clients 30 years ago. Sure hope you're doing better now than you were then.
907763282605248512 2017-09-12 00:30:06 UTC <Suavebones> @VABVOX @WWomenUnited Yes, this.
907710510455390208 2017-09-12 21:00:24 UTC <Suavebones> @nebraskaredrose @CNN Says the spokesperson for a man who refers to her as #Crooked Hillary."

907660535973388288 2017-09-12 17:41:49 UTC <Suavebones> @ckkoch3 @richardosman I don't engage - I block.
907658744258994177 2017-09-12 17:34:42 UTC <Suavebones> @KitterleCathy @thepoliticalcat @ohgodscrewthis Perhaps you can start sending bags of them to politicians? Cruz would be a good start. Everyone loves a bag o' dicks ... .
907658011312656385 2017-09-12 17:31:48 UTC <Suavebones> @KitterleCathy @thepoliticalcat @ohgodscrewthis Asking the musical question, um, "why"? Aw, skip it - I'm sure I don't wanna know.
907657481811222529 2017-09-12 17:29:41 UTC <Suavebones> @RogueSNRadvisor @TobiasBDog Great news! Thanks for brightening the day. 
907481830269493250 2017-09-11 05:51:43 UTC <Suavebones> @TheSamhita Literally never occurred to me that there is porn on Twitter.
907481556393922560 2017-09-11 05:50:37 UTC <Suavebones> @KellyannePolls Well, let's see - who was at the 9/11 site on 9/12? Was it you? No. Was it Hillary? Yes. Why don't you ooze back into the slime?
907479273962799105 2017-09-11 05:41:33 UTC <Suavebones> @BalmyBalmer @Stonekettle @Texastrue11 He's all yours, baby! Trust me, you have *no* competition.

907407177698107392 2017-09-11 00:55:04 UTC <Suavebones> @TheAtlantic @Prudential Dead and gone? One can only hope.
907406974496653312 2017-09-11 00:54:16 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCPolitics @Bad_Woof Slight amendment - fake Ph.D; real Nazi.
907406666114596864 2017-09-11 00:53:02 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCPolitics NBC, why are you even *talking* to this Nazi? Seriously, nobody cares what he thinks. He's no longer in the WH. Stop quoting him, ffs!
907406233073704961 2017-09-11 00:51:19 UTC <Suavebones> @dcexaminer @SecretsBedard Good grief, you really are desperate to slime HRC to have come up with this absurd issue. Learn how bookselling works b4 opening your yap.
907402816196505601 2017-09-11 00:37:44 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray @peterdaou Pardon me while I have a brief tantrum about Cillizza's comment - ARGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I'm done. Thank you.
907393277606879232 2017-09-11 23:59:50 UTC <Suavebones> @CandiceAiston @emigre80 @WaeleArthur They aren't "her" donors. They donated to her foundation, as did other countries and people worldwide. She owes them nothing. Shame on you.
907388781522595840 2017-09-11 23:41:58 UTC <Suavebones> @AlienMarmoset It pissed me off when my BFF, a non-smoker who worked in a bldg a few hundred yards from the WTC site, died of a rare lung cancer, age 60.
907386924540690433 2017-09-11 23:34:35 UTC <Suavebones> @DearAuntCrabby Glad you're safe.
907366999512064005 2017-09-11 22:15:25 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @RAMRANTS I really have no idea who you are, but I already hate you.
907366750932541440 2017-09-11 22:14:26 UTC <Suavebones> @RAMRANTS How is this *possibly* a valid question? There is no intellectually honest analogy - none - between 9/11 memorials and confederate statues.
907365808061288448 2017-09-11 22:10:41 UTC <Suavebones> @RAMRANTS No. No, you cannot. Not without some deeply dishonest intellectual shenanigans.
907364883221553153 2017-09-11 22:07:00 UTC <Suavebones> @ckkoch3 @Putin_Newz What "attempt"? Putin IS a white authoritarian, and the white supremacists in the US revere him.
907364263043391488 2017-09-11 22:04:32 UTC <Suavebones> @CillizzaCNN @CillizaCNN, stop talking. Stop talking now. Your 'insights' into HRC have always been flawed, and are not improving. Find another hobby.
907360452350328833 2017-09-11 21:49:24 UTC <Suavebones> @CillizzaCNN Um, no. If MSM had printed the truth - Hillary used a personal server for non-classified email - nobody would have cared. It's on you.
907225249233510400 2017-09-11 12:52:09 UTC <Suavebones> @dandrezner @teresamccarthy I keep saying this exact thing.
907221851314589701 2017-09-11 12:38:39 UTC <Suavebones> @2B_Painfree @Roxann_Minerals Waiting for human trials - if successful, she will have saved millions of lives.

907025179531927553 2017-09-10 23:37:09 UTC <Suavebones> @guardian Hahahaha! In the US, that is damned near everyone. Can't swing a dead cat without hitting fast food in this country.
907024398724431873 2017-09-10 23:34:03 UTC <Suavebones> @dylanlscott I'm still so pissed off about this Tweet, @mattyglesias , I came back a day later just to tell you so again. Look -HARD - at your misogyny.
907022442287075328 2017-09-10 23:26:16 UTC <Suavebones> @LoveFactsReaL @joseluisfama Shiba inu puppy.
907022367162896385 2017-09-10 23:25:58 UTC <Suavebones> @Hayden_Mack07 @LoveFactsReaL @CAPTGP Think it's a Shiba inu puppy.
907021143059525632 2017-09-10 23:21:06 UTC <Suavebones> @CHamptonGray @AdrianCJax Well worth the time to read, and thx for storifying. You left him bleeding in the gutter.

907018059314900992 2017-09-10 23:08:51 UTC <Suavebones> Feel better, head-let.
907017772239949824 2017-09-10 23:07:43 UTC <Suavebones> @CEAstudyabroad @Caparosa52 What a teeny-weeny, bigoted little world *you* live in. I've been to both London and Paris this last year, and they are glorious.
907011224713388033 2017-09-10 22:41:42 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis @alternageek_ Yeah, my very independent mom was 92 when she fell, broke her hip and FA saved her life. It's always pointless until it's helpful.
907010854700195840 2017-09-10 22:40:13 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis @BabsSCL My mom hated it, but was vacuuming one day, tripped on a blind-pull cord, fell on the vacuum and smashed her hip. Was very glad to have it!
907010172790333440 2017-09-10 22:37:31 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis My mother used First Alert 10 yrs ago (b4 other brands were on the mkt.) She did not want it, but it saved her life when she fell one day
906967492441935872 2017-09-10 19:47:55 UTC <Suavebones> @lmich2010 @KevinMKruse Do those journos all get their bad-batch drugs from the same connection?
906967151285694464 2017-09-10 19:46:34 UTC <Suavebones> @rushlimbaugh @BeSeriousUSA @olgaNYC1211 Dying of boredom? If you're there, @AnnCoulter , feel free to do so.
906966493958594560 2017-09-10 19:43:57 UTC <Suavebones> @TouchofMojoHand @bravenak @EYE_KILL_IT Yes, facts matter. You don't have ANY facts to support that garbage comment. Go away, now.
906923427868454912 2017-09-10 16:52:49 UTC <Suavebones> @TheCut She has terrible dress sense. I'm not surprised.
906921922205687808 2017-09-10 16:46:50 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha @JoyAnnReid @leslieleeiii A man telling a woman how to behave. How novel.
906869926371233792 2017-09-10 13:20:13 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @Lhatseri We're doomed.
906782036702011392 2017-09-10 07:30:59 UTC <Suavebones> @DavidAFrench Or alternatively, the thread is true in every particular, and you're just a frightened white man cleaving to power. Y'know, possibly.
906779736755412992 2017-09-10 07:21:51 UTC <Suavebones> @LeChatNoire4 @EricBoehlert Reality is deeply distorted these days - every other step, there's a wavy mirror ("we're fat, no wait, we're thin!"). Nothing makes sense.
906778573905653761 2017-09-10 07:17:13 UTC <Suavebones> @lizeraly @Millennial_Dems How dare JLaw try to take credit for the hurricanes away from lesbians?
906757176152121344 2017-09-09 05:52:12 UTC <Suavebones> @lizeraly @kharyp My heart breaks for you. I hope you have peace most days.
906755672636661760 2017-09-09 05:46:13 UTC <Suavebones> @ohgodscrewthis Just here to enjoy the repartee.
906681650033000448 2017-09-09 00:52:05 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Oh, great smouldering shitpiles. Are we supposed to be fucking grateful that a man has deemed a book by a brilliant woman ... "quite good"?
906680878318809088 2017-09-09 00:49:01 UTC <Suavebones> @InsanePotus @Amy_Siskind Oh, I'm taking full credit for it.
906680399752945665 2017-09-09 00:47:07 UTC <Suavebones> @VABVOX @CalicoJack1718 I read all kinds of crap on Twitter. Yours, however, CalicoJack, literally made me want to vomit.
906678947932286976 2017-09-09 00:41:21 UTC <Suavebones> @ColeLedford11 Don't be so silly. Many people are gifted their whole lives. There is no developmental stage called "average" thru which we pass.
906673101093474304 2017-09-09 00:18:07 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson I do not agree. I will be damed if I allow Bernie purists to steamroll the Democratic party.
906672513924571136 2017-09-09 00:15:47 UTC <Suavebones> @FraserNelson This is just nonsense.
906671877375979523 2017-09-09 00:13:15 UTC <Suavebones> @SikhProf @TheCadeTucker Um, Sharia is not in the US. Go be afraid of something more important.
906671201241645056 2017-09-09 00:10:34 UTC <Suavebones> @SikhProf Wasn't the first 9/11-provoked US murder of a Sikh business owner? Americans are unbearably, heart-breakingly stupid.
906564109306519552 2017-09-09 17:05:01 UTC <Suavebones> @ShaunKing Talk about vulgar overreach. Trust me, nobody buying tkts to see HRC is doing so bec. they saw HH's name and said, "wow, gotta go!"
906352525225291776 2017-09-08 03:04:15 UTC <Suavebones> @wendyweb47 @joncoopertweets @juadog Exactly.
906351771840266240 2017-09-08 03:01:16 UTC <Suavebones> @Evan_Rosenfeld F*ck. Hoping all can stay safe.
906344681579171841 2017-09-08 02:33:05 UTC <Suavebones> @MaxKennerly I sat next to Bobby Burchfield my entire 1L year (alphabetical seating). He had not one stick of empathy. Doubt ge has changed much.
906327439684509696 2017-09-08 01:24:35 UTC <Suavebones> @Equifax @AGSchneiderman Would now be a good time to reevaluate why all Americans must be subject to the caprices of credit-reporting firms? Let's just ditch them.
906324443806367744 2017-09-08 01:12:40 UTC <Suavebones> @dylanlscott @mattyglesias What is wrong with you? Really - what is wrong? Your Clinton derangement syndrome is off the charts, and reveals you to be a huge misogynist
906323227856605184 2017-09-08 01:07:50 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Then churches should pay taxes, *like everyone else getting FEMA funds.* Churches performing charity do NOT need reimbursement.
906322138017046528 2017-09-08 01:03:31 UTC <Suavebones> @trumpstergirl Ah. You're undereducated. Now I get your support for Trump and hatred of DACA folks.
906294666881990656 2017-09-08 23:14:21 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSanders @DaisyChainsaw99 Peace. I stand down.
906272037269782528 2017-09-08 21:44:26 UTC <Suavebones> @redsteeze Hey, Steve - are apples oranges? No? Then stop comparing them. 2nd statement was NOT about Dreamers, but unaccompanied kids at the border.
906270935417634821 2017-09-08 21:40:03 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos WTF? Hillary Clinton has *always* supported Dreamers. Her second quote was specifically about children arriving alone at the border.
906261090882920449 2017-09-08 21:00:56 UTC <Suavebones> @bethbrookfield @WestWingReport If the SEC doesn't promptly bring a civil case, and DOJ a criminal case, all hope is lost for an America under the rule of law.
906259785829330945 2017-09-08 20:55:45 UTC <Suavebones> @thegutsysleeper @aravosis I wasn't required to review or waive any rights just to check if info was stolen.
906242192804429824 2017-09-08 19:45:50 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook Agreed, all the way.
906241745947693062 2017-09-08 19:44:04 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook Exactly. Cannot be accomplished, at least in my lifetime.
906231572923170816 2017-09-08 19:03:38 UTC <Suavebones> @Alt_Spicerlies @amelie811 Burchfield was the brains behind the winning SCOTUS brief in Bush v. Gore. He hangs in GOP circles. Not surprised that Trump appt'd him.
906231172174233600 2017-09-08 19:02:03 UTC <Suavebones> @maddow @jacksonakyle I sat next to him for a year in law school (forced alpha seating). Not the most charming guy.
906230321552605184 2017-09-08 18:58:40 UTC <Suavebones> @JeffreyGuterman This is called "getting run down by the karma bus." Bobby Burchfield was the laboring oar in the GOP's winning SCOTUS brief in Bush v. Gore.
906179475557146626 2017-09-08 15:36:37 UTC <Suavebones> @SocialPowerOne1 HahahahHa!!!!
906178419850743808 2017-09-08 15:32:25 UTC <Suavebones> @KaraCalavera I want her help in wiping Bernie off the Democratic side of the ledger completely.
906178018212667395 2017-09-08 15:30:50 UTC <Suavebones> @matthew_d_green @el33th4xor Maybe this existential question signals an end to the financial tyranny of credit-reporting agencies? About time.
906175975242608640 2017-09-08 15:22:43 UTC <Suavebones> A fantastic thread about HRC. I love every single piece of it. Take that, Seth Meyers.https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/870591792797843457
906041882622304256 2017-09-07 06:29:52 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @melisheath Oh, yes. Yes, it's true.
906041744621420547 2017-09-07 06:29:20 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @pinky01105 Depends on your definition of "ethics." Bobby wrote the SCOTUS brief that swayed the court to rule for W in Bush v. Gore.
906040971913080832 2017-09-07 06:26:15 UTC <Suavebones> @mummadonna @JoyAnnReid I sat next to (then-future) Trump lawyer Bobby Burchfield in 1L at Geo Wash law school (alphabetical seating). Not a real ladies' man.

906037566410956800 2017-09-07 06:12:43 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw @bitchkitten5 Not out of thin air, they don't. Lawyers brief and argue the cases they decide.
906037203796500480 2017-09-07 06:11:17 UTC <Suavebones> @HiMaui @sweetlilsoul_ Northern NY State is not very different from Kentucky. I know - I grew up there.
906036668083224576 2017-09-07 06:09:09 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSanders @DaisyChainsaw99 Influence the rest of us to - what? Not rape? Complain about DeVos? I didn't need his help on these, thanks. Doubt anyone does.

906033994856226817 2017-09-07 05:58:32 UTC <Suavebones> @politico @RealMuckmaker Another Politico garbage piece designed to fracture the left and allow Bernie bros to become ascendant. Um, no. Uh-uh.
906033667675271168 2017-09-07 05:57:14 UTC <Suavebones> @DaisyChainsaw99 @SenSanders Oh, like you *ever* cared about this issue. Go away.
906032352702246912 2017-09-07 05:52:00 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanSarandon So utterly fucking disgusted with your brand of political purity.
906030033004724225 2017-09-07 05:42:47 UTC <Suavebones> @sahilkapur How, exactly, is it your business to judge what HRC should be saying or who should be listening to her? Please, just stop.

906024962019885059 2017-09-07 05:22:38 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @DavidBCollum I thought HRC was brilliant, committed to public service and a fountainhead of great policies. You sure did change my mind. {snort}
906019876577304576 2017-09-07 05:02:26 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @rali_niko @pnowak For the most part, Dems are NOT 'turned off' by her. It's the regressive Bernie left that hates her. Dems love her and boted for her.
906019496111988736 2017-09-07 05:00:55 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @pnowak The longer men keep saying she is a *major liability,* the more I hope she sticks around.

906009136042713089 2017-09-07 04:19:45 UTC <Suavebones> @politico Try asking actual Democrats, 'K? Think you will find a very different reaction.
906008969377751040 2017-09-07 04:19:05 UTC <Suavebones> @politico No, they f*cking well are NOT. Typical Bernie bros - telling wholesale LIES about Hillary's sold-out book tour.

905906442183389184 2017-09-07 21:31:41 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCNews @SupermanHopkins White woman here. I did *not* vote for this, and neither did 47% of my sisters. Maybe want to tone down the unnecessary racial vibe.

905897604235583488 2017-09-07 20:56:34 UTC <Suavebones> @AnaMardoll @_mamadeb Why should the most knowledgeable and experienced female politician in the country "be quiet"? Female misogyny is the worst.

905883322538221569 2017-09-07 19:59:49 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent I called my father "daddy" until (and after) his death. Give it up already. This is not the Trump criticism to bother with.

905522621239902208 2017-09-06 20:06:31 UTC <Suavebones> From the Washington Post: Facebook told congress it sold ads during the election to a shadowy Russian co. targeting US voters. Thx, FB. 
905521739735547904 2017-09-06 20:03:01 UTC <Suavebones> @coppertime Lying is, sadly, legal. Otherwise, Fox, Breitbart, etc. could not exist.

905254470874836992 2017-09-05 02:20:59 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer Nobody has an attention span any more. We're all tied to a cart whizzing down 45's bumpy highway at warp speed, dodging outrages as we go.
905249699954810880 2017-09-05 02:02:01 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer No worries - the only reason I know is that I watched her destroy the ERA 40 years ago, and was terribly relieved when she departed.
905248970275880960 2017-09-05 01:59:07 UTC <Suavebones> @MEPFuller @gilbertjasono @wabrahamse Best comment of the day.
905247058851803138 2017-09-05 01:51:32 UTC <Suavebones> @HoarseWisperer She died a year ago, in 2016. I took myself out to dinner to celebrate.
905246318951505921 2017-09-05 01:48:35 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Authoritarians love to pretend that the Constitution is their personal protectorate. I doubt most of them have even read it.

905119093623111680 2017-09-05 17:23:02 UTC <Suavebones> @relixs_ @bdiddy601 A 26 year old deported to a country he left at age 4, and whose language he does not speak, is an existential crisis. Show some heart.

905117768424374272 2017-09-05 17:17:46 UTC <Suavebones> @relixs_ We will work very hard to protect your ability to stay in the US. Trump's action is despicable. Sorry you are under this tertible burden.

904562600649752576 2017-09-03 04:31:44 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 So painful. 
904562154983923712 2017-09-03 04:29:58 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 I believe it - horrible wrench.
904561572114075648 2017-09-03 04:27:39 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 That must be rough for you. That's the part I don't miss - having to let go.

904560780372189186 2017-09-03 04:24:30 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Yeah, my cat was a big bruiser. Got him for my 5th b-day. Lived for 20 years.
904560452012621824 2017-09-03 04:23:12 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 My spouse is severely allergic to animals, so no pets for the last 40 years. Miss having one, but would miss my spouse more!
904559371002056704 2017-09-03 04:18:54 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 My cat was 23 pounds &  hunted everything in the neighborhood - birds, squirrels, rabbits. Even chased dogs off the property. Very scrappy.
904558479934763008 2017-09-03 04:15:22 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 
904555307472379904 2017-09-03 04:02:45 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Agreed. A cat can and will fend for itself at need.
904554857721339905 2017-09-03 04:00:58 UTC <Suavebones> @SFPD @libbybrittain So terrifying for you (and probably her). Glad she is back safely. Assume you will be speaking to facility about security for Alz patients?
904553202783109120 2017-09-03 03:54:23 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Cats are very good swimmers. Most aren't fond of the water, but they can swim like sons of guns.

904447335521861632 2017-09-03 20:53:43 UTC <Suavebones> @1stGrumpydude @tribelaw Disagree about Miller.Just because he, as a staff member, drafted a document doesn't implicate him in crimes only his superiors could commit

904421231457320961 2017-09-03 19:09:59 UTC <Suavebones> @esquire @cmarinucci @NowYouSeeMe66 Yes. I am so distraught, every day, that I can barely move.
904416987891212288 2017-09-03 18:53:07 UTC <Suavebones> @CLEpolice @JamilSmith Police unions are a blight on America. They exist to cover up criminality by police.
904399676786352129 2017-09-03 17:44:20 UTC <Suavebones> @ShellyPass @cmclymer But - but - those are the only intentions he *ever* has.
904370539283677184 2017-09-03 15:48:33 UTC <Suavebones> @77CaptainMarvel @kurteichenwald Aw, crap. Must have forgotten to aim our gay-married destructor beam at your marriage. 
904246158721114114 2017-09-03 07:34:18 UTC <Suavebones> @iTunesTV @robinly_ @nate_latham No, it's really good. Far more enjoyable than watching Alicia drink wine.
904245846979502080 2017-09-03 07:33:04 UTC <Suavebones> @iTunesTV @LILDIRECT Seriously, this show is much better than the later seasons of GW.
904245697234427907 2017-09-03 07:32:28 UTC <Suavebones> @iTunesTV @emma_harrang Yes. Being great.
904245607191085056 2017-09-03 07:32:07 UTC <Suavebones> @CBS @iTunesTV @micheleortega_ Your loss. This show is *really* good.
904245459560022016 2017-09-03 07:31:32 UTC <Suavebones> @iTunesTV @Thrills51 @Tigerpug You haven't met me either, but I've watched it (and it's great!).
904235706733576192 2017-09-02 06:52:47 UTC <Suavebones> @BFriedmanDC @PeterCorless Which says exactly what *I said.* Zip code *of birth* has jack shit to do with anything.
904235266403008512 2017-09-02 06:51:02 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @pwberg77 @joseiswriting A graduate of charm school. With honors.
904234997850161152 2017-09-02 06:49:58 UTC <Suavebones> @PeterCorless @BFriedmanDC Oh, piffle. The zip code where you've spent a lot of your life *may* have some bearing on your later circumstances, but your birth zip? Nah.
904232120624627712 2017-09-02 06:38:32 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Try finding stores without it in AZ.
904231982086840322 2017-09-02 06:37:59 UTC <Suavebones> @DaShanneStokes And where?
904156467191627776 2017-09-02 01:37:54 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @noybsk2017 @vgliatti Say, you're a sophisticate.
904155455722631168 2017-09-02 01:33:53 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @DaShanneStokes @Wolfiemann If you're so sure it's sh+t, why don't you disprove him?
904154789264556033 2017-09-02 01:31:14 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha @imillhiser Oh, good luck with that "pre-judged" argument - it would indict every single draft judicial legal decision ...
904147432308482049 2017-09-02 01:02:00 UTC <Suavebones> @RhutaBhayga No. They're still at their net a erage disgraceful low of lying constantly. The fact that each new lie is appalling doesn't make lying new.
904147054439444482 2017-09-02 01:00:30 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @DaShanneStokes Replying, badly it seems, to @Wolfiemann.
904146780509442048 2017-09-02 00:59:25 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @DaShanneStokes Or, if you object to the premise, you could posit your own position and provide support.
904145761172045824 2017-09-02 00:55:22 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm Let's think of him as damaged, stunted and stupid. I think that fills in all the gaps about his utter and complete lack of empathy.
904145017630900224 2017-09-02 00:52:25 UTC <Suavebones> @DaShanneStokes @Wolfiemann If you don't already know the answer, you probably aren't educated enough to understand the explanation.
904144579053494272 2017-09-02 00:50:40 UTC <Suavebones> @starfirst @RWPUSA You could have stopped with "Enemy of America."
904144316980879361 2017-09-02 00:49:38 UTC <Suavebones> @HNTurtledove @Nysteveo2AOLcom @railboss To said young child: the law firm is saying "up your nose with a rubber hose" to Trump, because he is a bad man. Don't say 'f*ck'."
904143877984075776 2017-09-02 00:47:53 UTC <Suavebones> @Nysteveo2AOLcom @WIPjenni Oh, foof. Public vulgarity is *exactly* the right thing to do to shame Trump.
904143209789456384 2017-09-02 00:45:14 UTC <Suavebones> @randyprine @GlennThrush He incapable of human interaction.

903740336228392960 2017-09-01 22:04:21 UTC <Suavebones> @Satur9 @kumailn Sadly, it's an outstanding point.
903739299786440704 2017-09-01 22:00:14 UTC <Suavebones> @muffinboy10 @RealMuckmaker I get the reason why you called it a 'chess match,' but there is no flipping way that Putin's puppet could ever learn a knight's move.
903736790590169088 2017-09-01 21:50:16 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Can someone put some numbers on this media reporting? My sense is that antifa's numbers are tiny compared to KKK/Nazis/white supremacists.
903736070671482881 2017-09-01 21:47:24 UTC <Suavebones> @jtacuff @AdamParkhomenko I laughed. A lot.

903735058569166848 2017-09-01 21:43:23 UTC <Suavebones> @RWPUSA @PreetBharara @4everNeverTrump @tribelaw I don't count as a scholar, but I spent my career as a federal litigator. If what I've read this week are 45's best arguments, he's toast.
903733107437723648 2017-09-01 21:35:38 UTC <Suavebones> @adamputnam What nonsense. All polls have poll watchers of all major parties. All voters must bring proper ID. Nobidy w/out citizenship and an ID votes.
903732168333058048 2017-09-01 21:31:54 UTC <Suavebones> @muffinboy10 @funder My guess is he won't resign.

903720747641724928 2017-09-01 20:46:31 UTC <Suavebones> @MikeStuchbery_ @Vivalavulva2016 Further unaware of Jackson's participation in any biowarfare as part of his savage treatment of Native Americans. Cite?

903365152300441601 2017-08-31 21:13:30 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook Some care about multiple things at once. Wearing "fuck-me" pumps to a catastrophe struck me as being worth a couple minutes of reflection.
903344331267858433 2017-08-31 19:50:46 UTC <Suavebones> @kidcandlelight You need some education. Over 160 people died in Arpaio's jail, many in Tent City. Arpaio bragged that summer tent temps were 142 degrees.
903342495714512896 2017-08-31 19:43:28 UTC <Suavebones> @mattblaze @opendna @silus_2000 Whereas your goal, clearly, is to condemn the left because of one mass shooting. Go peddle this nonsense elsewhere.
903341872508133377 2017-08-31 19:41:00 UTC <Suavebones> @MikeStuchbery_ @Vivalavulva2016 No. It was never true, as has been painstakingly explained by numerous academic sources. Europeans did bring smallpox, but not deliberately.
903341201310363648 2017-08-31 19:38:20 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon @_Orwell @mightbesleeping They are being true to their free-speech charter, which involves them being frequent assholes. Why is this only now occurring to you?

903334015381364736 2017-08-31 19:09:47 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost Of course. The highest paid person in most states is the collegiate sports coach.  We are a sad nation that values nothing worthwhile.
903319819105198081 2017-08-31 18:13:22 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon @_Orwell @mightbesleeping Well, um, yes, it very specifically excuses them in this and all other cases ...
903319196284575744 2017-08-31 18:10:53 UTC <Suavebones> @mystcole @RedTRaccoon You're kind of missing the point of Charlie Hebdo, which is to be as outrageous as possible in defense of free speech.
903284931102515204 2017-08-31 15:54:44 UTC <Suavebones> @MikeStuchbery_ @Vivalavulva2016 That infected blankets thing was never true.

903135433550307333 2017-08-30 06:00:41 UTC <Suavebones> @BrianKarem I'm still furious at Obama for bypassing Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House.

903133751252729856 2017-08-30 05:54:00 UTC <Suavebones> @mattblaze This seems crashingly obvious. And yet MSM is full of "but antifa ..." Makes my head hurt.

903129559272366080 2017-08-30 05:37:20 UTC <Suavebones> @eileendefreest Sadly, there is no bottom to the depths of despisability this man can sink.
903101589598027779 2017-08-30 03:46:12 UTC <Suavebones> Fuck off.
903020438078406656 2017-08-30 22:23:44 UTC <Suavebones> @resisterhood Antifa is such a tiny percentage of the left that I do not plan to waste brain cells on whether they're good or bad. They barely exist.
903018994256404480 2017-08-30 22:18:00 UTC <Suavebones> Yeah. A bad goddamn human being.

902974326177054721 2017-08-30 19:20:30 UTC <Suavebones> @brianklaas Well, yeah. Trump isn't going to do any actual *work* to understand or reform anything. He's too stupid to understand the tax code anyway.
902970837107580928 2017-08-30 19:06:38 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU @Step4Pam @Brad_D80 And ... that didn't happen. Go back to your cave.
902969834714963968 2017-08-30 19:02:39 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @LAPv3 She showed both leadership and definition. She lost due to vicious slurs from the right and misogyny from every direction.
902968767021334528 2017-08-30 18:58:25 UTC <Suavebones> @kidcandlelight I don't care what color the undies are. Putting people in tents to bake in PHX summer heat and freeze on the chill violates the 8th A.

902960726951608320 2017-08-30 18:26:28 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Liar. You saw neither horror nor devastation yesterday. You were on dry ground with a claque and talked to nobody affected by the flood.
902959493092225024 2017-08-30 18:21:33 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump You don't give two figs for America. You want to create profit for yourself and other rich folks - to hell with the rest of us. We see you.
902958069230870528 2017-08-30 18:15:54 UTC <Suavebones> @JoelOsteen @funder Osteen got rich preying on others' fears, and the $$ is tax-free. Why anyone listens to these money-hummers is absolutely beyond me.

902953317403287552 2017-08-30 17:57:01 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood @GroveCityDem Yeah, I get it. Jesus, too, always hung out, buffing his nails, until someone "asked" for guidance.

902686908437766144 2017-08-29 00:18:24 UTC <Suavebones> @chargrille @20committee This man gives Gomert a run for his money as "stupidest representative ever."
902686252779966464 2017-08-29 00:15:48 UTC <Suavebones> I admire your intelligence, insight and effort to get the word out. Please don't be disappointed when *nothing* comes of it in our lifetimes
902685847950000128 2017-08-29 00:14:11 UTC <Suavebones> @ResistanceParty I never thought I would be cheering a military man whose moniker is "Mad Dog." But hey - great work, Mad Dog!! 
902685086067310592 2017-08-29 00:11:10 UTC <Suavebones> @VAL_MAYNARD @brianklaas Could this *be* a bigger FU to Trump?
902684707657203712 2017-08-29 00:09:40 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @olgaNYC1211 @gailbriggs8 Her face is too plasticized to show emotion. If you look carefully, though, her butt cheeks clench at times ...
902684440857427969 2017-08-29 00:08:36 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @olgaNYC1211 @joyceangelos OK, I laughed out loud ...
902671378159026176 2017-08-29 23:16:42 UTC <Suavebones> @RogueSNRadvisor @TobiasBDog So sorry!
902670313493716993 2017-08-29 23:12:28 UTC <Suavebones> Phoenix resident here - I do not support Arpaio's pardon.https://twitter.com/maxinelizette/status/902329686251921408
902669132893523968 2017-08-29 23:07:46 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Transphobic remarks - not welcome. Criticize her comments, brains or lack thereof, or even her personal appearance. But stop w/ transphobia.
902667286028337152 2017-08-29 23:00:26 UTC <Suavebones> @RealSheriffJoe @Goss30Goss Pretty much sums it up ...
902663092324122624 2017-08-29 22:43:46 UTC <Suavebones> @blakehounshell He mistook it for a rally. "What a crowd! What a turnout!" with a fire engine prop. Failed to say anything about human suffering ...
902621778148605952 2017-08-29 19:59:36 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald Notice how *few* of the left are actually involved in or support antifa?
902618147848458240 2017-08-29 19:45:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JoeNBC He is just the worst person.
902617750320832514 2017-08-29 19:43:36 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone Modified rapture. But at least they're safe.
902614918540607488 2017-08-29 19:32:21 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 My favorite and yours might differ - I'm old. If I were younger, I'd go straight to Medellin, a busy, safe city with everything one cld want
902614379639668736 2017-08-29 19:30:12 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 And now you know why I have a megaton about other places to live ... ! DM me if you need specifics. 
902613955314462720 2017-08-29 19:28:31 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 Highly recommended!
902613751056154624 2017-08-29 19:27:42 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel What do you expect from a longtime radio-spouter of hatred?
902613350458171393 2017-08-29 19:26:07 UTC <Suavebones> @RhutaBhayga Stunner - he lied.
902613087181611008 2017-08-29 19:25:04 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 It's not hot in Lake Chapala, Mexico (a lakeside, mountainous microclimate), and is downright springlike in Medellin, Colombia. 
902611272029446145 2017-08-29 19:17:51 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 Don't go north. Go south. Mexico and Colombia have communities that are first-world options, have tons of US expats and cost less than US.
902606238394892288 2017-08-29 18:57:51 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol And *of course* you voted for the authoritarian, racist-backed, inexperienced candidate instead of the highly-experienced woman of color.
902604639572434944 2017-08-29 18:51:30 UTC <Suavebones> @SocialPowerOne1 Imagine if she developed a facial wart every time she told a huge whopper. She would be Jabba the Hutt by now.
902603973567197185 2017-08-29 18:48:51 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis A weird homonym for a flood zone - Float Us (and, impliedly, not you peons).
902596724899725312 2017-08-29 18:20:03 UTC <Suavebones> @KeepMyPowerOrg Sounds like "Float Us," with an implied "and not you." Helluva message for a flood zone ...
902596169573982208 2017-08-29 18:17:50 UTC <Suavebones> @TimeLordJeff It is unfathomable to me that NYT keeps throwing lifelines to the clown-in-chief.
902590981895098368 2017-08-29 17:57:14 UTC <Suavebones> @KFILE @VickyMayne4 Exactly.
902590755612516352 2017-08-29 17:56:20 UTC <Suavebones> @KFILE @wsucpa And consider that Michelle was actually helping people, not just taking a misery tour.
902590361444335616 2017-08-29 17:54:46 UTC <Suavebones> @KFILE Considering that the First Lady has no role in this admin. other than being decorative, her decorations are fair game. It looked absurd.
902570540811960320 2017-08-29 16:36:00 UTC <Suavebones> It's the heels + army jacket, too. Such a bizarre look. Of course, she favors those.
902359953876193280 2017-08-28 02:39:12 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson I think he tried to say that he d/n bury the Arpaio story bec. he knew everyone would be watching news for Harvey coverage.  He still sucks.
902307144724185088 2017-08-28 23:09:22 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton Ratings? RATINGS?? Wtf is he talking about?
902306877865771008 2017-08-28 23:08:18 UTC <Suavebones> @symooneee Very relieved to hear you and the baby are OK!
902305738667606018 2017-08-28 23:03:46 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey I love this. Seriously. To all the people who said, "But they are usually right," NO, they weren't. I could invent more credible "leaks."
901989987473694721 2017-08-27 02:09:05 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright Are people saying this? I would prefer to avoid Texas, personally, but have already donated to relief efforts & think all aid should flow.
901971638756847616 2017-08-27 00:56:11 UTC <Suavebones> @GovernorKasich @EdSkipper @thepoliticalcat @42hopestreetbus Hillary was specific about her positions and traveled the country talking about them. DNC has a specific platform. Wtf are you talking abt?
901969721091751936 2017-08-27 00:48:33 UTC <Suavebones> @3DTruth They might have a Bivens action if they can claim that what happened to them was a constitutional violation.
901953845252636673 2017-08-27 23:45:28 UTC <Suavebones> @lrozen @christinawilkie @jsherman39 Yes!
901953733671530496 2017-08-27 23:45:02 UTC <Suavebones> @christinawilkie @HSlater351 Exactly!
901953628453330944 2017-08-27 23:44:37 UTC <Suavebones> @joe_warmington @christinawilkie @LiseLasalle They are breathlessly excited (i.e., giddy), as though he's taking credit for the size of the storm. His comments are just bizarre.
901953300718686208 2017-08-27 23:43:19 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @christinawilkie @joe_warmington Even you don't think he has a caring muscle in his whole body.
901952962364301312 2017-08-27 23:41:58 UTC <Suavebones> @christinawilkie He either identifies with the storm (bigger! badder! better!), or he's looking forward to the glory (??) of having handled the bigliest one.
901951415131619328 2017-08-27 23:35:49 UTC <Suavebones> @MrJonCryer @longwall26 @WTxNamaste Yeah, not at the conference table ...
901948457195233280 2017-08-27 23:24:04 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @barbaraward235 @cyferPtVila My heart goes out to you. I wish I had anything to offer that might help your situation.
901910214244352000 2017-08-27 20:52:06 UTC <Suavebones> @BurkeLynne Arpaio has done grievous damage in Phoenix. The pardon is a disgrace and I applaud anyone who speaks out against it.
901909611204157440 2017-08-27 20:49:42 UTC <Suavebones> @DisavowTrump16 @WFerrin We all remember that the Governor told Obama to *stay away* until the following week, when he did visit. Piggish Trump muscled in anyway.
901908471284621312 2017-08-27 20:45:10 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Apparently the rescue effort you're referring to is so hopelessly undermanned and under-resourced that the city is calling for private boats
901904709639847936 2017-08-27 20:30:14 UTC <Suavebones> This op-ed focuses on how "cheap" and "easy" all of Trump's nasty efforts are. None requires effort. No policymaking, no consensus.https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/901882037132443648
901902631735508992 2017-08-27 20:21:58 UTC <Suavebones> @USMC_DD1 Thinking? Assumes facts not in evidence.
901899739263770625 2017-08-27 20:10:28 UTC <Suavebones> @obbiecole @owillis Yah, nah, not gonna happen.
901881201887068160 2017-08-27 18:56:49 UTC <Suavebones> @paulkrugman So sorry to hear of your loss.
901824547636224000 2017-08-27 15:11:41 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @DearAuntCrabby Groopspeak is not a reliable info. source. Sadly.
901821886379655173 2017-08-27 15:01:07 UTC <Suavebones> @brianbeutler They still love him in PHX.
901821369675014144 2017-08-27 14:59:04 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey What a miserable thing - so sorry.
901813941176647680 2017-08-27 14:29:33 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @CBLK08 Outstanding point, exquisitely made.
901808824176095233 2017-08-27 14:09:13 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump I live in AZ. The execrable Joe Arpaio made AZ hell for people with brown skin - the very opposite of "safe." He is a racist; so are you.
901807793174282240 2017-08-27 14:05:07 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump NAFTA? Really? Houston is drowning and *this* is what you're tweeting about?
901716491271159808 2017-08-27 08:02:19 UTC <Suavebones> @BigBrain1234 @rob_sheridan Uh, not *quite* everyone ...
901648874737090560 2017-08-26 03:33:38 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat No dispute on that point.
901643775151284224 2017-08-26 03:13:22 UTC <Suavebones> @RogerJStoneJr @joncoopertweets Sad? SAD? It's *about f@cking time!*
901643587808485376 2017-08-26 03:12:37 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @Corvid1031 To be absolutely fair, though she d/n really deserve it, Baio's wife later apologized and the two women got back on tweeting terms.
901641633485135872 2017-08-26 03:04:51 UTC <Suavebones> @CourtneySwans20 @DebMichaelsTwit Close second - transgender military ban.
901641329419075585 2017-08-26 03:03:39 UTC <Suavebones> No. Liberals are compassionate, something the GOP cannot claim.
901641082622025728 2017-08-26 03:02:40 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS This man was epically evil, allowing thousands of gay men to die rather than bringing the power of the gov't to bear on the AIDS crisis.
901638787737858048 2017-08-26 02:53:33 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos @SJGrunewald Identity politics, like political correctness, is lobbed at the left by the right to undermine compassion and concern for the marginalized.
901638275282092032 2017-08-26 02:51:31 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan GAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
901638154247069696 2017-08-26 02:51:02 UTC <Suavebones> @yashar @gkygirl Drink Hint. It's better.
901637945269952513 2017-08-26 02:50:12 UTC <Suavebones> @CourtneySwans20 @JoyAnnReid Isn't OSHA supposed to be *documenting and caring about* worker fatalities, ffs?!
901637419841208320 2017-08-26 02:48:07 UTC <Suavebones> @marcushjohnson The white working class has some soul searching to do. You'd be a lot more sympathetic if you could respect gays, POC and women.
901635944440147970 2017-08-26 02:42:15 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland Old news. She withdrew the complaint.
901633636440563716 2017-08-26 02:33:05 UTC <Suavebones> @Susan_Hennessey @benjaminwittes Made me cry ...
901632805041348609 2017-08-26 02:29:46 UTC <Suavebones> @LHuffmanPowell Love Otis's hurricane priorities - "water, no prob, but a dog's gotta eat."
901632471946608640 2017-08-26 02:28:27 UTC <Suavebones> @DewsNewz Wow, are you a failure at analogies if you think there is any correspondence between these cases.
901631971205365760 2017-08-26 02:26:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Nysteveo2AOLcom I will personally drive every riderless Dem to the Phoenix polls to vote against this dirt bag.
901630356402585600 2017-08-26 02:20:03 UTC <Suavebones> @SymoneDSanders Never thought they were. White women seem to have played a big role in electing 45, despicably enough.
901629667517513728 2017-08-26 02:17:18 UTC <Suavebones> @RickByers10 I made no comment about you at all. I merely suggested that this fight is bigger than Christians, which I believe. Open your ears.
901622327149969409 2017-08-26 01:48:08 UTC <Suavebones> @RickByers10 Um, not all of us non-racists are Christian. Something to keep in mind.
901621585324326912 2017-08-26 01:45:11 UTC <Suavebones> @JulianCastro @Reed8570 Oh, no we do not. Some of us understand that Sheriff Joe is a criminal who deserved to be punished for his extreme mistreatment of Latinos.
901571489601687552 2017-08-26 22:26:08 UTC <Suavebones> @ABC A baseball cap?
901570335274762240 2017-08-26 22:21:32 UTC <Suavebones> @ScottBaio @MrsScottBaio This is a bit dishonest, @yashar. There was a lot of back-and-forth btwn the two women, and they ultimately made peace.
901557317434466304 2017-08-26 21:29:49 UTC <Suavebones> @BillOReilly @ComelyKC @mannreagan The half of the population that thinks it's fake are brain dead.
901557054032101376 2017-08-26 21:28:46 UTC <Suavebones> @BillOReilly What Trump or Arpaio *believe* has zero to do with the rule of law. A GOP appointee judge referred A. for criminal contempt - was convicted.

901555447022227456 2017-08-26 21:22:23 UTC <Suavebones> @VAL_MAYNARD @mmpadellan Thank you!
901538182784663556 2017-08-26 20:13:47 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook Do you think she knew these were fake (it's pretty obvious), or is she really so clueless?
901525892685381632 2017-08-26 19:24:57 UTC <Suavebones> @markos @Mivasair @obbiecole Hahahahahaha!!
901524800790700032 2017-08-26 19:20:36 UTC <Suavebones> @tomwatson @OliverWest100 So obviously you never read a single proposal she had or listened to her hopes for America. I have never been so inspired by a candidate.
901523114831470592 2017-08-26 19:13:54 UTC <Suavebones> @isteintraum And that's not even mentioning the fact that Manning had spent seven years in prison by that point under grievous conditions.
901522101865029632 2017-08-26 19:09:53 UTC <Suavebones> @markos @Mivasair I live in Phoenix. Hillary had nothing to do with cutting the primary polling places. That was entirely a GOP stunt by Maricopa County.
901520303670534144 2017-08-26 19:02:44 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara @Gammiex4 @Booksmartz2006 Nope. The President's pardon power comes from the Constitution and is not constrained by DOJ's procedures.
901519786907062272 2017-08-26 19:00:41 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara @Gammiex4 POTUS is not constrained to follow any particular procedure for issuing proactive pardons. DOJ procedure is geared to those seeking pardons.
901519115755454464 2017-08-26 18:58:01 UTC <Suavebones> @JKH2 Come to Phoenix, where, until the last election, Arpaio had huge support for decades. There's quite an array of stupid people.
901516944792141824 2017-08-26 18:49:23 UTC <Suavebones> @LeChatNoire4 @Maria_Hinojosa Not a *charged* criminal - a *convicted* criminal.
901515890184691712 2017-08-26 18:45:12 UTC <Suavebones> @tweetbrk @nycsouthpaw @kidcandlelight The Constitution does not permit law enforcement to treat either the accused or the convicted like shit. Yet Arpaio did, year after year.
901515415678984196 2017-08-26 18:43:19 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 @nycsouthpaw Yeah, that ship pretty much sailed when Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich.
901514475555110912 2017-08-26 18:39:34 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook @GeorgeTakei Plus, Miller. Get him the heck outta there.
901513085424345088 2017-08-26 18:34:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Maggyw519 @DavidCornDC Not even code. He pretty much said it out loud.
901512193723613184 2017-08-26 18:30:30 UTC <Suavebones> @windmillcharger @WangCecillia Thank you for that. I am so outraged, I don't know where to direct my anger.
901511910079602692 2017-08-26 18:29:23 UTC <Suavebones> @xjpacheco @RVAwonk Imagine, if you will, living in a city where Arpaio and his appalling mistreatment of minorities was a daily occurrence for decades ...
901511228878606336 2017-08-26 18:26:40 UTC <Suavebones> @jonathanvswan But this is not the last time I'll say it -you are 100% wrong. Gorka had a *security clearance.* He spoke as a surrogate. He is a Nazi. Wtf
901509367735832576 2017-08-26 18:19:17 UTC <Suavebones> Sometimes, you just have to say it straight out.https://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/901434518426583041
901508297852829696 2017-08-26 18:15:02 UTC <Suavebones> @jjmacnab @bhart48 Might want to brush up on your law there, fella. Your grasp of it is woefully inadequate.
901437248435965952 2017-08-26 13:32:42 UTC <Suavebones> @BFriedmanDC I threw up a little.
901276409032617984 2017-08-25 02:53:35 UTC <Suavebones> @kushkandy95 @TheRickWilson @FeMaiden13 That sounds exactly right. He had no other reason to rush the pardon with Arpaio.
901262832724869120 2017-08-25 01:59:38 UTC <Suavebones> I wouldn't take that bet. Arpaio is tough enough to live another 20 years.
901257012930953216 2017-08-25 01:36:31 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 I think that's right - attacking the substructure of the judiciary *would* be impeachable.
901255676072124416 2017-08-25 01:31:12 UTC <Suavebones> @tragedythyme @profmusgrave Wish you'd kept that moreau to yourself - too fucking depressing.

901244817933385728 2017-08-25 00:48:03 UTC <Suavebones> @AGSchneiderman @realDonaldTrump @CREWcrew @Honeybee0427 Love the enthusiasm, but ES needs no hints. Fully on board and doung his duty, rigorously.
901243295128469504 2017-08-25 00:42:00 UTC <Suavebones> @JoshuaGrubbsPhD @AnneNewsJunkie NK subduedly fired three rockets today, so I guess it's true.
901240163598073856 2017-08-25 00:29:33 UTC <Suavebones> @Stonekettle @TananariveDue To which I would add "misogynistic," "homophobic" and "xenophobic."
901239667692982272 2017-08-25 00:27:35 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @LAPv3 Guess you didn't listen to or read Hillary's views, eh?
901239350729375744 2017-08-25 00:26:20 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @djbrunetti They've just witnessed the tyranny of Trump and are still "disaffected"? What would it take to reach their "affect" - thermonuclear war?
901238544357773312 2017-08-25 00:23:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Mikel_Jollett Um, 45 just gave law enforcement the go-ahead to act unconstitutionally against brown people. Beyond vile ...
901237693270577152 2017-08-25 00:19:44 UTC <Suavebones> @KPhed The only bright light in this otherwise news-begrimed day.
901236473206251520 2017-08-25 00:14:54 UTC <Suavebones> @HiMaui Please. Some of us AZ-ans are devastated by this news.
901236240808239104 2017-08-25 00:13:58 UTC <Suavebones> @adegrandpre @innerspacegirl I've been out of adjectives and adverbs for a year or more. Every comment I make is "He's just ...," or "It's just ...."
901235742088634368 2017-08-25 00:11:59 UTC <Suavebones> @daveweigel @adegrandpre @inlanddefense Coulda used some of that in my career, too.
901234681248534528 2017-08-25 00:07:46 UTC <Suavebones> He did it. He pardoned Arpaio. Just when you thought your stomach couldn't be wrenched any further.
901229971032514560 2017-08-25 23:49:03 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU @Step4Pam @Brad_D80 The medical profession does not share your view of mental illness. See DSM-5.
901228847848345600 2017-08-25 23:44:36 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ACLU Thank you, as always, ACLU!
901226276672782336 2017-08-25 23:34:22 UTC <Suavebones> @TheLastWord @DebLyftogt It does make sense if 45 once picked up a transwoman and discovered it later - he would be exactly this vindictive towards all transpersons.
901224806732906496 2017-08-25 23:28:32 UTC <Suavebones> @PageV503 @tribelaw Speak for yourself, fella. Women have been busting a gut to advance women's rights, visibility and representation for 100 years. Your turn.
901221361321779201 2017-08-25 23:14:51 UTC <Suavebones> @a2mech2000_k @poncho_nevarez One can only hope. With his combo of empathy deficit and inability to act, he can't even fake an appropriate response.
901220645572190208 2017-08-25 23:12:00 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @PageV503 @LambdaLegal Theory: this ban is so spiteful, it must be personal. Did 45 once pick up a transwoman unknowingly, and this is payback to transpersons?
901218442094690304 2017-08-25 23:03:15 UTC <Suavebones> What's the over/under on the idea that the whole transgender military ban stemmed from 45's inadvertant pickup of a transwoman in the past?
901195236361228288 2017-08-25 21:31:02 UTC <Suavebones> @Houston17David Phantasy Walmart does. But not in all colors ...
901194834362343424 2017-08-25 21:29:26 UTC <Suavebones> @Houston17David Also, hope you and yours stay safe today, with or without scarf.

901142582058655744 2017-08-25 18:01:48 UTC <Suavebones> @leahmcelrath Good luck and stay safe. It looks like a horrendous storm.
901110104031764480 2017-08-25 15:52:45 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol You aren't a woman who might choose an abortion after 20 weeks due to gross fetal abnormalities, are you?
900938408717041666 2017-08-24 04:30:29 UTC <Suavebones> @RoseMarie4Real How lucky to be able to "chat" with you! You were the very first professional woman I ever saw on TV. You opened my eyes to possibilities!
900854616824233984 2017-08-24 22:57:32 UTC <Suavebones> @NaphiSoc ID and arrest this f*cker.
900797195632259072 2017-08-24 19:09:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Oh, stop.
900787063695392768 2017-08-24 18:29:06 UTC <Suavebones> @NaphiSoc @funder Yeah, KA, that's what America is all about - praising Dear Leader.
900786560886390784 2017-08-24 18:27:06 UTC <Suavebones> @mooray Oh, frack off, Axelrod - impeachment is necessary now.
900780260278411264 2017-08-24 18:02:04 UTC <Suavebones> @YesYoureRacist @Eunicegilly @toootiepie Virginia is still grumbling about the "Wah of Nor-than Aggression."
900779692948574208 2017-08-24 17:59:49 UTC <Suavebones> @YesYoureRacist @PinkWyldflower @jenna_valentine Spare a thought for us old liberals who will be dying along with them. As you lose enemies, so you lose allies.
900775993412993024 2017-08-24 17:45:07 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @H_Combs @ron_0540 The left pretty universally condemns violent tactics. But it was the alt-right that was throwing *lighter fluid* on peopke in Cville.
900775181165109252 2017-08-24 17:41:53 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @H_Combs @jodiquilts Shown later to be a hoax.
900775047014473728 2017-08-24 17:41:21 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @fireheather @H_Combs MAGAs were interviewed in the Phoenix paper today about their rally attendance & support of 45. To a person, they were stupid and clueless.
900718285380964354 2017-08-24 13:55:48 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis @EliotHiggins Gotta ask - does any *woman* waste time on 4chan?
900717705858211840 2017-08-24 13:53:30 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent This is the strangest story ...
900716407205134337 2017-08-24 13:48:20 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @Mikel_Jollett @TheatreChick76 A lot of people lead narrow lives.
900715229855666176 2017-08-24 13:43:39 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @Mikel_Jollett A good friend and fervid Sanders supporter believes exactly this. No amount of educating or hectoring by me has budged her.
900379322908684289 2017-08-23 15:28:53 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog @cwarzel Gee, and I got a 12-hour time-out for calling Sheriff Clarke s "moron" ...
900375635322851328 2017-08-23 15:14:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JessicaHuseman @CynthiaLHenson3 Thank you!
900270640891953152 2017-08-23 08:17:01 UTC <Suavebones> @kpak0123 Yeah, I've got too many renters, some of longstanding. Gotta evict them somehow.
900269007500042241 2017-08-23 08:10:32 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @trACEymod @DannyZuker My mom felt the same way about Bush. She died in her sleep, happy, the night after Obama was inaugurated.

900266251691278337 2017-08-23 07:59:35 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent Oh, poppycock.
900265095824986113 2017-08-23 07:54:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta No. No he won't.
900259328602419201 2017-08-23 07:32:04 UTC <Suavebones> @Iceberge13 @ritchiewitha I'm so sorry - are you OK?
900259205608644609 2017-08-23 07:31:35 UTC <Suavebones> @GlennThrush @KaraCalavera Glenn Thrush obviously had an aneurysm.
900258376457703424 2017-08-23 07:28:17 UTC <Suavebones> @politicususa @essenviews It's absolutely unfathomable that this man is our President.
900110513635446785 2017-08-22 21:40:44 UTC <Suavebones> @ZerlinaMaxwell My feeling is that too many white people think "whiteness" is an affirmative identity (KKK, etc.), which I believe it is not.
900071840441221120 2017-08-22 19:07:03 UTC <Suavebones> @KYWeise Oohhh, I've always wanted to pay a lot of money to stay at a replica of a slave-owning enterprise and dine in a machine. 
900070412255612928 2017-08-22 19:01:23 UTC <Suavebones> @CharlesMBlow Crowdsource the research. Whatcha need?
900057865896968192 2017-08-22 18:11:32 UTC <Suavebones> @JoeNBC The Guardian called it "graceless piggery." Love it.

899986283614789634 2017-08-22 13:27:05 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol No.
899860592990617601 2017-08-21 05:07:38 UTC <Suavebones> @stevenmnuchin1 @JamilSmith Appalling woman. And using a gov't trip to advertise brands - the very essence of privilege.
899823407797116928 2017-08-21 02:39:52 UTC <Suavebones> @nycsouthpaw @yashar It's either "let them eat cake," or "aprs moi, le dluge." Maybe both.
899821155946713088 2017-08-21 02:30:56 UTC <Suavebones> @chrisgeidner She could have been briefer with "let them eat cake."
899819447514353664 2017-08-21 02:24:08 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey This is just absolutely disgusting: "We're the rich and entitled, and you are the little people we spit on." #BirkinBag
899819073936150528 2017-08-21 02:22:39 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis This reminds me of Imelda Marcos and all of her shoes. Why is this chick monetizing her accessories?!?
899816431998558208 2017-08-21 02:12:09 UTC <Suavebones> @ReaderAdrift Agreed.
899801915122270208 2017-08-21 01:14:28 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @AynRandPaulRyan Well, that, and the fact that the Secret Service is paying Trump for his golf carts, hotel rooms, etc. ...
899801377026654208 2017-08-21 01:12:20 UTC <Suavebones> @ReaderAdrift I'm sorry. That sounds awful.
899798562426372096 2017-08-21 01:01:09 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @ReaderAdrift The legal briefs in the same sex marriage cases in 2014-15 set out this issue at length as well.
899785066800267264 2017-08-21 00:07:31 UTC <Suavebones> @_celia_marie_ THANK YOU! I just cannot understand the "flawed candidate" stench that follows her around. Show me even *one* un-flawed candidate.
899784245073256448 2017-08-21 00:04:15 UTC <Suavebones> @HarleyResists @exoticgamora @DonnaNoble10th @RulingVenus @turkresisting It was meh even with the solar eclipse, which, at only 67% in my part of AZ, and occurring behind a cloud cover, didn't even happen here.
899754884257284096 2017-08-21 22:07:35 UTC <Suavebones> @maggieNYT @btransatlantic Stop with the "flawed candidate" descriptor. No candidate is without flaws.
899753169277693952 2017-08-21 22:00:46 UTC <Suavebones> @maggieNYT Well, I thought she *did* run a pretty good race, and I *do* believe the press dragged her down with biased reporting. Complicit much?
899752949320044544 2017-08-21 21:59:54 UTC <Suavebones> @4everNeverTrump Well, actually, I thought she *did* run a pretty good race, and I *do* believe the press dragged her down with biased reporting.
899748979046404096 2017-08-21 21:44:07 UTC <Suavebones> @CharlesMBlow Try looking at HRC's website for her campaign platform. Pretty much says it for me.
899744454747107328 2017-08-21 21:26:09 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @puppymnkey @califsassy It was ever thus.
899740161709191168 2017-08-21 21:09:05 UTC <Suavebones> @funder I wish you were right. But you're not.

899627731364716544 2017-08-21 13:42:20 UTC <Suavebones> @GiddyHeyde Could we maybe find ways to insult Nazis without using tired anti-gay tropes like "pansies"? Thanks.
899334390789980160 2017-08-20 18:16:42 UTC <Suavebones> @Saintsfan5348 No. The end days are officially here. This is an insane statement.
899063888909488128 2017-08-19 00:21:49 UTC <Suavebones> @Endoracrat Nonsense, said 40K Bostonians today.

899045598099144705 2017-08-19 23:09:08 UTC <Suavebones> @mcuban @puppymnkey Cuban has often said he's no liberal. This seems to be a semi-serious offer by a conservative guy who wants to work w/ a GOP Congress.
899044128989757441 2017-08-19 23:03:18 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 He's talking about BLM, which he believes (wrongly) is a toxic force equal to Nazis.
899027909377007617 2017-08-19 21:58:51 UTC <Suavebones> @BasedStickman_ @Rambobiggs Yeah, right. Nobody believes that nonsense.
899025794051080192 2017-08-19 21:50:27 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @tribelaw I used to teach law, and trust me, one does *not* grade on spelling.
899025041790124032 2017-08-19 21:47:27 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @tribelaw Um, he is the POTUS. And he misspells *constantly.* Don't make fun of it? The hell you say.
899013535350390784 2017-08-19 21:01:44 UTC <Suavebones> @MerrillLynch So I guess I really do look like the stressed cat my iPad ID'd as an image of me?
899013084521447424 2017-08-19 20:59:56 UTC <Suavebones> @KateEads Nah, it's just Saturday. Javanka aren't around.

899012305140170753 2017-08-19 20:56:51 UTC <Suavebones> @SwanWhisperr @kylegriffin1 A tiny flicker of light in these dark days ...

899010694720348160 2017-08-19 20:50:27 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Oh, nonsense. Nobody believes you mean this. Literally. Not anybody.
899007718848995329 2017-08-19 20:38:37 UTC <Suavebones> @ezlusztig Is there any way to hate 45 more? Asking for a friend ...
899007361997692928 2017-08-19 20:37:12 UTC <Suavebones> @susanswann99 OMFG, there is literally no end to the stupidities he utters.
899003990335045632 2017-08-19 20:23:48 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Love Amazon's own brand of Origami covers - they will hold the iPad upright in various ways.

898701038080872448 2017-08-18 00:19:59 UTC <Suavebones> @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @BillBarrowAP What? WHAT?? It's the DEMS risking a culture war, not the actual Nazis and white supremacists they're protesting??
898696946163957760 2017-08-18 00:03:43 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook AND he clear-cut 400 trees *without a permit* to enable a view from his golf course of the place where nothing happened.
898696008862810112 2017-08-18 00:00:00 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook Sorry, but I'm not clear whether he's "fur" or "agin" Trump??
898603845214814208 2017-08-18 17:53:46 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @TrueFactsStated You forgot "stupid." He is undeniably stupid.
898584368557379585 2017-08-18 16:36:23 UTC <Suavebones> @a2mech2000_k Another Tweeter pointed out that in the resignation letter, the first letters of each paragraph spelled "RESIST." Love it.

898438682251640833 2017-08-17 06:57:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent Where do *you* draw the line? In your own country. Let the US decide where to draw theirs. Your history is not ours.

898405017941454848 2017-08-17 04:43:42 UTC <Suavebones> @maddow @LindaLawrey @xeni Mayor Stanton has been a rare ray of liberal sunshine in fiercely libertarian & right wing Phoenix. 
898375444520550400 2017-08-17 02:46:11 UTC <Suavebones> @BrianPaulStuart There *is* that monument to Benedict Arnold's foot at the Saratoga Battlefield, but it's a small thing ... .
898372592129593344 2017-08-17 02:34:51 UTC <Suavebones> @theblatt @tribelaw Flynn is the ultimate impeachable witness:  "When did you stop beating your country?"
898370978182438912 2017-08-17 02:28:26 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw Abusing morally or legally?
898370260033613824 2017-08-17 02:25:35 UTC <Suavebones> @3DTruth Wish I could offer encouragement, but so many people who could do more eventually wind up enslaved to relative comfort.
898369320371109888 2017-08-17 02:21:51 UTC <Suavebones> @3DTruth As peaceniks of the late 60's learned, most of their friends and fellow travelers from that time grew up to be GOP investment bankers.
898344453546549248 2017-08-17 00:43:02 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos It s not an attack on Spain, per se. The attack is on a Western, Christian country to demonstrate its weakness.
898342664394821632 2017-08-17 00:35:56 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood Another genius who d/n know the difference between correlation and causation.
898341982824562690 2017-08-17 00:33:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Ashley_Grammy It's the wrong question. You want, "Am I a jerk?" Women can have as much sex with as many people as they like. But are they jerks abt it?
898339724791660544 2017-08-17 00:24:15 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @cathyob1 And don't forget plain, old stupid.
898339219382312961 2017-08-17 00:22:14 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @FayRep Trump's victory was an embrace by the voting public of overt know-nothingism, ugly right wing racism/bigotry, and evangelical fervor.
898337585377927168 2017-08-17 00:15:45 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @patriot_arizona Speaking as a liberal Arizonan, I assure you we don't count McCain or Flake in our number. They're not Nazis but they're def also not Dems.

898279833272057856 2017-08-17 20:26:16 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesEFinch @NoFascistLies Begging the question of why it was ever there.

898267484255535104 2017-08-17 19:37:11 UTC <Suavebones> @IntelVets This is called either a "delusion" or a "lie intended to distract." Nobody is trying to "reinstall Obama."
898266469561008128 2017-08-17 19:33:09 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, you are unable o distinguish actual history from urban legend. That is because your (Fox) news sources are so poor.
898266088017772544 2017-08-17 19:31:39 UTC <Suavebones> @sportsrage @bncrrll @Fearonika @xxxPiemanxxx Yes, questioning and challenging tyranny is exactly how one stands up to it.  Not sure that's hard to  understand.
898265325082353664 2017-08-17 19:28:37 UTC <Suavebones> @americablog @aravosis He what? About whom? What the actual f*ckety-f*ck?!?

898221387738787840 2017-08-17 16:34:01 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @stellaaaa The right-wing phrases "identity politics" and "political correctness" are both attempts to belittle and delegitimize human compassion.

898074413089685506 2017-08-16 06:50:00 UTC <Suavebones> @Dim_Whitman @JamilSmith FTW
898061249090437120 2017-08-16 05:57:41 UTC <Suavebones> @NARAL @EA_Joyce Sure. That's why W.E.B. Du Bois was on the board of Sanger's organization.
898059218686623744 2017-08-16 05:49:37 UTC <Suavebones> @NARAL @SpeakOut5810 Oh, horseshit.
898059117800996864 2017-08-16 05:49:13 UTC <Suavebones> @NARAL And anti-LGBTQ evangelical groups, too.
898054313485811713 2017-08-16 05:30:08 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Can I get a refresher course on those "white rights" he is advocating?
898034792792326144 2017-08-16 04:12:33 UTC <Suavebones> @MollyJongFast @PR_twit Execrable.
898034258463252480 2017-08-16 04:10:26 UTC <Suavebones> @MollyJongFast Interested in the idea that "both saved America." What exactly was Lee's role in "saving America"?
897950173317390336 2017-08-16 22:36:19 UTC <Suavebones> @twicktwit @RoseMarie4Real We still love you! Happy belated birthday!!
897948505028706304 2017-08-16 22:29:41 UTC <Suavebones> @dcpoll This is a huge deal. The action was unquestionably taken by Mueller, based on something serious and dmging he just learned about Strzok.
897947975112048640 2017-08-16 22:27:34 UTC <Suavebones> @NatashaBertrand Perhaps his old work on the Hillary email investigation is being questioned, now that a judge has ordered State Dept to produce more?

897901702858158080 2017-08-16 19:23:42 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 The fact that you support and represent a man whose language slimes women, POC, Jews, gays and Muslims, among others, makes you complicit.
897838272335892481 2017-08-16 15:11:39 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA @NeeleyJonea Also, he was back in his seat of power, Trump Tower, for the 1st time in months. It gave him the confidence to speak, unbridled.
897837027684605952 2017-08-16 15:06:43 UTC <Suavebones> @PuestoLoco Without sourcing, this is just fake news. C'mon - you're better than this.

897635097372962817 2017-08-15 01:44:19 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @TheKrain 4/ This is misogyny at its fundament - a woman just couldn't cover all of the 40 million bases she (and no other candidate) was asked to run
897634714068156416 2017-08-15 01:42:47 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @TheKrain 3/. And worst of all, you guys kept taking whacks at the HRC every time you passed by, and then expressed shock that it finally fell over.
897634499302916096 2017-08-15 01:41:56 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @TheKrain 2/. And then claimed she had no message. You belittled her slogan instead of listening to it.
897634109970931717 2017-08-15 01:40:23 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @TheKrain, I don't think you understand just how much you and guys just like you were responsible for Hillary's loss. You did not listen,

897630279451504645 2017-08-15 01:25:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JeffFlake Senator Flake, pls denounce the President's "both-sides-ism" about Cville. We can't survive as a country if the President excuses racism.
897629547490881537 2017-08-15 01:22:15 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta Right, I recall when some lefty drove a car into a group of Nazis, killing one and injuring 19. Oh, wait ...

897577401881735168 2017-08-15 21:55:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Anti_DJTrump It's just breathtaking in its hostility and ignorance.
897559804444499968 2017-08-15 20:45:07 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus Every election involves choosing some issues over others. It is possible to win elections without abandoning core Dem principles.
897558931685294080 2017-08-15 20:41:39 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus Trust me, your point is not opaque. To be clear, I am dis-a-gree-ing with, not failing to understand, it.
897554624525115393 2017-08-15 20:24:32 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus Women and POC are used to hearing "don't rock the boat with your issues" from white men. Imagine if *you* were always asked to step back?
897551227294171136 2017-08-15 20:11:02 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump @AZVotes Oh, cmon. They were pretty active in AZ.
897547584323043328 2017-08-15 19:56:34 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus Another way to say it is that FDR saved a lot of white people's asses by ensuring Jim Crow misery for POC. Dems should never do that again.
897547053596762112 2017-08-15 19:54:27 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus He is suggesting that Dems abandon core issues to win elections. To that, I say, "hell no." Who *wants* Nazi or anti-choice Dems in office??
897545070135529473 2017-08-15 19:46:34 UTC <Suavebones> @voxdotcom @nicasaurus Oh, horse twaddle. What *are* Dems if they are not looking out for the poor, oppressed and "othered"?

897535352734273536 2017-08-15 19:07:58 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha @AdamWeinstein I would argue that leaving statues of Confederate soldiers and battles *is* sanitizing history, by glorifying the horror.
897529673344720897 2017-08-15 18:45:24 UTC <Suavebones> @ejdickson "Identity politics" is a made-up idea, akin to "political correctness," to make leftists' compassion and concern for all people look bad.

897523104422940672 2017-08-15 18:19:17 UTC <Suavebones> @BretStephensNYT Are you under the impression that the left is blaming *all white men* for the acts of a few Nazis? Bec. THAT is the true analogy you make.
897522220712435712 2017-08-15 18:15:47 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone Oh, impatience of youth - you may need to lengthen your timeframe, I fear. I predict 45 will still be in place in 2018, but will go b4 2020.
897520790341525504 2017-08-15 18:10:06 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon @MariaGiner5 She would need a brain that thinks about something other than what she looks like and what others think she looks like. No evidence of one.
897519836686802944 2017-08-15 18:06:18 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone It will ever be thus. Keep your focus on what you want.

897517964383068161 2017-08-15 17:58:52 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone There will never be just one issue, particularly in the face of oppression from many sides. Gotta roll with multiple issues.
897516890611826689 2017-08-15 17:54:36 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Oh, but when Hillary wanted an incremental approach, she was a corporatist stooge? Smdh
897516582938619904 2017-08-15 17:53:23 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone Different time entirely. So many issues rising to the fore at the same time (black equality, women's lib), together w/ anti-war momentum.
897463996017647617 2017-08-15 14:24:25 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Definitely a birther call-out.

897335226443026432 2017-08-14 05:52:44 UTC <Suavebones> @TravisCountyTX @riotwomennn 2/2. Fraud is usually w/holding or misstating facts to persuade ppl to give $$. Here, Creepo has no inside info. My initial thoughts.
897334689454632960 2017-08-14 05:50:36 UTC <Suavebones> @TravisCountyTX @riotwomennn 1/1. I'll think about it, too. But public statements made about matters where the facts are available to everyone are rarely fraudulent.

897135834419220480 2017-08-14 16:40:25 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan Such a disgusting man. The casual racism and sexism in those two words, "shut up," is breathtaking.
897128814156718080 2017-08-14 16:12:31 UTC <Suavebones> @SymoneDSanders @TomarraWagoner Ken Cuccinelli is a disgusting dirt bag and does not speak for white people. Shame on him for his disgraceful treatment of Ms. Sanders.
897127564233265153 2017-08-14 16:07:33 UTC <Suavebones> @SymoneDSanders Ken Cuccinelli is one of the world's worst people. Thank you, Ms. Sanders, for stomping on him hard!
897126864245841920 2017-08-14 16:04:46 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert I would rather see him rot in SuperMax.

897125537491017728 2017-08-14 15:59:30 UTC <Suavebones> @Waorguy @armandodkos @SalterWobchak Exactly.
897125433212153858 2017-08-14 15:59:05 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos @Kelly__Decker Hahaha!
897125298151374850 2017-08-14 15:58:33 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Stoller is right that, just as today, the rich leveraged racism for economic benefit. But *of course* white working class supported it.
897124036668383232 2017-08-14 15:53:32 UTC <Suavebones> As if 45 gives two hoots about drug prices ...

897013056072327168 2017-08-14 08:32:32 UTC <Suavebones> @altNOAA Right you are! The driver who killed Heather in Cville was a military wash-out: could not complete basic training. Bumped at month 4.

897009956020404224 2017-08-14 08:20:13 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland @fostergrantpi Complex question. Generally speaking, the laws governing federal use of the doctrine of posse comitatus would suggest "no."

896549155564175360 2017-08-12 01:49:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JRubinBlogger @McAllisterDen Political correctness does not exist. There are good people and jerks. And you're a jerk.
896547146563862530 2017-08-12 01:41:11 UTC <Suavebones> @WhitfordBradley @Marmel @ljpne He is also a white guy charged with 2nd degree murder, suggesting that the police didn't find the circumstances complicated.
896546771081453568 2017-08-12 01:39:41 UTC <Suavebones> @WhitfordBradley @Marmel @ljpne Oh, puh-leeze. He drove 50 mph straight down a street crowded with pedestrians and never braked. Enough with the wait-and-seeism.
896546461550206977 2017-08-12 01:38:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Marmel He's got the Richard Spencer hair.
896546287981477889 2017-08-12 01:37:46 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Not just blood - brains, viscera and bone as well.
896536384009142272 2017-08-12 00:58:25 UTC <Suavebones> @RoperBilly War of the Roses, pfftt. My ancestors fought at the Conquest, and I'm a 13th generation American. Your world view is horrifying.
896535627474231297 2017-08-12 00:55:25 UTC <Suavebones> @RoperBilly That's not the only stench clinging to you.

896531834040754176 2017-08-12 00:40:20 UTC <Suavebones> @TheGayHumanist @davidfrum It's spelled "NAZI."
896530205652598784 2017-08-12 00:33:52 UTC <Suavebones> @Olivianuzzi Yeah, meant to ask - where do I pick up my pay envelope? 
896526806722924544 2017-08-12 00:20:22 UTC <Suavebones> @kumailn @zacarytaco @fakeDanesh @EllieObservant @domenicserena @BSElOsoBlanco I'm labeling white supremacist jerks like those in Charlottesville as Nazis, because they are.The GOP can decide to reject them.
896526252982403073 2017-08-12 00:18:10 UTC <Suavebones> @kumailn @zacarytaco @domenicserena @Revolution3135 @fakeDanesh @tonia73986 If everyone shows up at a cake-baker's rally wearing chef's toques, toting whisks & signs with cake recipes - they are ALL supporting cake.
896525388079185920 2017-08-12 00:14:43 UTC <Suavebones> @kumailn @zacarytaco @fakeDanesh @domenicserena Um, please identify the right-wing protestors who were *not* Nazis?
896525161381232640 2017-08-12 00:13:49 UTC <Suavebones> @fawfulfan @kumailn What do people need to see to believe they're Nazis? Hateful tattoos (yes); fascist flags (plenty); racist chants (frequent). WHAT ELSE???
896524394054287360 2017-08-12 00:10:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SusanPage @MattMackowiak Slow down, pardner ... defunding programs that largely benefit the poor and POCs looks a lot like those guys in Charlottesville.
896523896114905088 2017-08-12 00:08:48 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan He did.
896523293166940160 2017-08-12 00:06:24 UTC <Suavebones> @mirinblue @puppymnkey @JerritaNona Keep saying what *you* believe, repeatedly. They'll get sick of hearing you and stop talking, or you'll persuade 'em. Sorry about yoyr mom.
896522597701083136 2017-08-12 00:03:38 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey No forgiveness. They knew or should have known what they were voting for.
896516726782803968 2017-08-12 23:40:18 UTC <Suavebones> @ClaraJeffery @Evan_Rosenfeld Against my better judgment, I'm liking McCain better every day.
896515733697331200 2017-08-12 23:36:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Gustyweather Exactly.
896515627803787266 2017-08-12 23:35:56 UTC <Suavebones> @DrummerDayna Proud of *who* you are is a lot different from being proud of what you fortuitously happen to be. Don't confuse the two.
896515108074954752 2017-08-12 23:33:52 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz @jdubya65 Not I. Not yet.

896509482930290688 2017-08-12 23:11:31 UTC <Suavebones> @ManMet80 @kurteichenwald Evil Nazis. It's not hard to say.

896507853887856640 2017-08-12 23:05:03 UTC <Suavebones> @count_01 Into every life, a little drudgery must fall. 
896507409945866240 2017-08-12 23:03:17 UTC <Suavebones> @senorrinhatch Exactly. They are Nazis, and we should call them that at every turn. They tied themselves to the Nazis' odious history. Now they own it.
896506926069985280 2017-08-12 23:01:22 UTC <Suavebones> @count_01 Exciting! Make the most of it.
896506745085755392 2017-08-12 23:00:38 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Uh, not I. I strongly supported HRC and know that those who did not are the true intellectual rubbish of the country.
896492347197751296 2017-08-12 22:03:26 UTC <Suavebones> @LoganStepp No, Ligan - you're an entitled, privileged white Mormon who clearly doesn't give a hoot about the oppression of others by whites.

896474878135619584 2017-08-12 20:54:01 UTC <Suavebones> @adamjohnsonNYC Okay, you're a Nazi too. Got it.
896474262667579392 2017-08-12 20:51:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Nysteveo2AOLcom It was, reportedly, a stolen car. Try not to advance vigilantism.

896463392818339840 2017-08-12 20:08:22 UTC <Suavebones> @BreeNewsome Yeah. Yesterday.
896461361659625472 2017-08-12 20:00:18 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta Oh, boo-hoo. Someone shows up to protest white nationalism and it's got your frilly knickers in a twist?
896460969290813441 2017-08-12 19:58:45 UTC <Suavebones> Now's the time for #TheResistance #Resistance to rise up as one to say "NO NAZIS."
896460452078559233 2017-08-12 19:56:41 UTC <Suavebones> @ChelseaClinton Call them "Nazis," @Acosta. Let's all call them what they are.
896459506804064256 2017-08-12 19:52:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz Oh, that horrid fu*k-monster. How dare he claim that this is a "both sides" issue?
896453196813447168 2017-08-12 19:27:52 UTC <Suavebones> @MichaelRapaport @tdaleball He assumed it was college kids because they were on a college campus. His heart is so sincere, he gets a full pass for minor fact-mangling.
896452191631720448 2017-08-12 19:23:52 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump @Secret_Cheech How tiring for all of us.

896450636236980224 2017-08-12 19:17:41 UTC <Suavebones> @jmartNYT Wait, what? I'm supposed to tune into Fox News, ffs, to hear condemnations of "racist rhetoric"? On which planet will Fix be airing this?
896450054872940544 2017-08-12 19:15:22 UTC <Suavebones> @_Makada_ @pstgame Notice who in the crowd were wearing helmets - Nazis.
896449823477383168 2017-08-12 19:14:27 UTC <Suavebones> @_Makada_ @nawalkowsky Which cities, specifically, were "burned down" by BLM? I haven't noticed any missing cities ... .
896449453309050882 2017-08-12 19:12:59 UTC <Suavebones> @_Makada_ Can you really be so stupid as to believe this?
896448686837743619 2017-08-12 19:09:56 UTC <Suavebones> @funder @Mommygatr Um, no. You don't get to keep your good-guy credentials once you become a bad guy, a fact that Lee was very conscious of.
896448452669788160 2017-08-12 19:09:00 UTC <Suavebones> @PageV503 @funder Today.
896447473756930048 2017-08-12 19:05:07 UTC <Suavebones> @BurnettCynthia @tomperriello Serious question - when, in the history of the US, did white lives in general *not* matter? What are they even talking about?
896447054842429440 2017-08-12 19:03:27 UTC <Suavebones> @mattmfm @Lazizabites You just have to wonder about the women in these hard-right, racist movements.
896446446886465536 2017-08-12 19:01:02 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis @zzzoren Probably.
896445405931503616 2017-08-12 18:56:54 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato @AJentleson Richard Spencer is already calling 45's comment a condemnation of antifa, not Nazis.

896440324578459652 2017-08-12 18:36:43 UTC <Suavebones> @christinawilkie Not much stronger. "The hate" is by Nazis. Let's call them out by name.
896434433590386688 2017-08-12 18:13:18 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton Ffs, post the video or shut up.
896429930002628608 2017-08-12 17:55:24 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton @Ruf_MEN You just keep drinking that white boy juice. "Cities"? Whole CITIES? Delusional.
896429615744294912 2017-08-12 17:54:09 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton @Treacle_A Yeah, I'll believe it when someone other than Faith Goldy reports it.
896426555777339392 2017-08-12 17:42:00 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis It's a carefully coded tweet intended to suggest that the problem, and violence, are all antifa. No condemnation of Nazis, white suprems.
896425712004902912 2017-08-12 17:38:39 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Condemn white supremacists and Nazis, or we'll know you are one of them.
896425356462137344 2017-08-12 17:37:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton What mistake? It is *clearly* intended to avoud rebuke of Nazis.

896424217746460672 2017-08-12 17:32:42 UTC <Suavebones> @UVA @Shakestweetz @NoWeDontAccept Yes - the President of UVa condemned it, as did the Mayor of Charlottesville.
896423922626830336 2017-08-12 17:31:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz We *will* replace them, with persons of all genders, colors, ethnicities and religions fighting for dignity and respect.

896407639365525504 2017-08-12 16:26:50 UTC <Suavebones> @Charlottesville @puppymnkey Link to any credible source? Aside from other folks on Twitter, I've seen no news reports about this.

896215073076662272 2017-08-11 03:41:38 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Tiki torches, ffs?
896214032339746816 2017-08-11 03:37:30 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane WHO is a handsome pup? Is it YOU? Yes, YOU! You are the handsomest pup!!
896213770304749568 2017-08-11 03:36:28 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Easy question to answer - in the US markets, all trading, by law, would stop until society stabilized, in months or years.
896213200110092289 2017-08-11 03:34:12 UTC <Suavebones> @SocialPowerOne1 You first, Rush-bo. Let's see what *you* are made of.
896212783276056578 2017-08-11 03:32:33 UTC <Suavebones> @riotwomennn The judge threw out his claims against her for causing him to lose his job. I haven't seen any ruling on her 'groping' counterclaim.
896210423522787328 2017-08-11 03:23:10 UTC <Suavebones> @funder Even Roger Stone said Bannon looks like a homeless person.
896166671295029248 2017-08-11 00:29:19 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Please. Please secede. And build a wall around yourself.
896159137289052161 2017-08-11 23:59:22 UTC <Suavebones> @KeithOlbermann @BrackinJr Veering towards 100%, I'd say.
896158724892405762 2017-08-11 23:57:44 UTC <Suavebones> @prdickinson Scamper Apple Cider (23 years)
896156432793456641 2017-08-11 23:48:38 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @socsqueez Excellent point ...
896116006426255360 2017-08-11 21:07:59 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey And the far left needs to acknowledge that Bernie will never be President, either.
896114674516635648 2017-08-11 21:02:42 UTC <Suavebones> @prdickinson Hey, wait just a minute ... I've never had a dog (but yes to a cat!) and have zero in common with 45. Wait, right, I'm fat too.
896097524083064832 2017-08-11 19:54:33 UTC <Suavebones> @FindNatureNow @AnneFrankCenter I see - you aren't a US citizen and lack perspective on the astonishing diminution of black lives in the US.
896096775169232900 2017-08-11 19:51:34 UTC <Suavebones> @FindNatureNow @AnneFrankCenter No, let's not. The *whole point* of saying BLM is to draw attention to the fact that Black lives are often treated more cruelly than others.
896096253846601729 2017-08-11 19:49:30 UTC <Suavebones> @Sammysgranny I sure am.
896096147575406592 2017-08-11 19:49:04 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @thehill He's a menace to the world. #OustSebGorka
896095564722458624 2017-08-11 19:46:45 UTC <Suavebones> @UESChristine Would have been more convincing had POTUS bestirred himself to say something about the expulsion, oh, say, TEN DAYS AGO when it happened!
896095019819343872 2017-08-11 19:44:36 UTC <Suavebones> @TheRoot I'm guilty of exhibiting white privilege because I think POTUS is insane terrorist who should be stopped? Not following ...
896092986378813440 2017-08-11 19:36:31 UTC <Suavebones> @1SnoozyQ It links to a memo.
896092176228139009 2017-08-11 19:33:18 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @DTrumpExposed Two. Two mentally ill dictators.
896082016927535104 2017-08-11 18:52:55 UTC <Suavebones> @thenation With a whimper, not a bang?
896081891400441856 2017-08-11 18:52:25 UTC <Suavebones> @riotwomennn You left out "deep confusion" ...
896080188441739264 2017-08-11 18:45:39 UTC <Suavebones> @ezlusztig It has been one for at least two decades.
896073637425324032 2017-08-11 18:19:38 UTC <Suavebones> Priceless. https://twitter.com/hitexecutive/status/895908750636195840
896066673786011648 2017-08-11 17:51:57 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent Here's the thing - the apology is fake; the original words were what the guy reallt thinks.
896065020886360064 2017-08-11 17:45:23 UTC <Suavebones> @suejohnston56 @SonnyUndercover No wonder 45 is such an ugly person: he lives in the ugliest domicile ever.
896064632145625089 2017-08-11 17:43:51 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @lowkell @JWGOP I fear for Irkutsk.
896064397830791168 2017-08-11 17:42:55 UTC <Suavebones> @SallyAlbright @peterdaou I am a lefty, not a "centrist." But I am smarter than the doctrinaire radical left fringe, because I know compromise gets things done.
896063564292567040 2017-08-11 17:39:36 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis You are an inspiration! Congrats -

896041871427878913 2017-08-11 16:13:24 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Agreed, but who cares? Any port in a storm.
896036856835448832 2017-08-11 15:53:28 UTC <Suavebones> @InxsyS Nightmarish. Just horrible. Worst thing I've read today (and the last article I saw was judging the likelihood of nuclear war with NK).
895979756037873664 2017-08-11 12:06:34 UTC <Suavebones> @ekcj1234 Dick Hibey is a dynamite lawyer and principled guy. That's not eye shadow - he is of Lebanese descent and has dark eyes.
895843722780319746 2017-08-10 03:06:02 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Well done!!!
895833263322710016 2017-08-10 02:24:28 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Yes, but they didn't have their paws on such reins of power.
895830815963099137 2017-08-10 02:14:44 UTC <Suavebones> @Eat_Shop_Travel You asked that question, as though there is equivalence between the bodily autonomy of 51% of the nation and the wages people earn. Shame!
895830310352338944 2017-08-10 02:12:44 UTC <Suavebones> @ManMet80 @Eat_Shop_Travel I REALLY object to being called a "centrist Democrat" simply because I think most of Bernie's agenda is incapable of being deployed.
895817849100312576 2017-08-10 01:23:13 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity One huge lie, and you know it.
895784581378392065 2017-08-10 23:11:01 UTC <Suavebones> @CNNMoney Oh, sweet withering lizards. How can CNN even *think* of letting O'Reilly in???
895711710933270529 2017-08-10 18:21:28 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh Because ... why? Eight Congressional committees found that Benghazi wasn't her fault. What more can there be to find?
895711362675916800 2017-08-10 18:20:05 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Do you ever ask yourself what the hell they think they will find in her emails? "I know, let's fake an attack on the Benghazi embassy!" SMDH
895699607065247744 2017-08-10 17:33:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Newsweek @SafetyPinDaily Um - no.
895679079575306241 2017-08-10 16:11:48 UTC <Suavebones> @DeityFree It's satire.
895566215690674177 2017-08-10 08:43:19 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Why this treacherous douche didn't spend his life in prison for Vietnam (and Laos and Cambodia) is beyond me.
895540400152170500 2017-08-10 07:00:44 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM What can we expect next from his fine vocabulary - "sticks and stones"??
895536957022887936 2017-08-09 06:47:03 UTC <Suavebones> @FoxNews My hearing is failing, but I haven't yet reached the point where I could mistake 45 for "an orator," much less "gifted" or "best."
895534978494218240 2017-08-09 06:39:11 UTC <Suavebones> @JaySekulow When did you become a defense adviser?!

895056538506678274 2017-08-08 22:58:02 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat Excellent point!
894931557441339392 2017-08-08 14:41:24 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic My liberal parents were absolutely appalled by the Bakkers, whom they first saw on TV after retiring to Missouri in the mid-'70s.
894930079297355776 2017-08-08 14:35:32 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Exactly.
894925206229180416 2017-08-08 14:16:10 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Increased to $2000/mo. Became uninsured.
894925043087556608 2017-08-08 14:15:31 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis I can tell you my personal experience in PHX. Paid $637 mo. thru xchg for unsubsized indiv. coverage. All but 1 insurer pulled out; cost
894920846090788864 2017-08-08 13:58:51 UTC <Suavebones> @cottage_orchard @MollyMcKew This is how Erik Prince profits from global destabilization.
894919173683331072 2017-08-08 13:52:12 UTC <Suavebones> @LFaraday @CdnFreethinker Time to call them what they are "loser flags."

894850236694183936 2017-08-08 09:18:16 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat Hannity has no standing to challenge the discretionary acts of a senior security official.
894782321655558144 2017-08-07 04:48:24 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat So tragic and unnecessary.
894779953991962625 2017-08-07 04:38:59 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @funder @SueinRockville @Obvi_Dank My theory is that it was deliberately flattering in its likeness in order emphasize the "laziness" message.
894779068595396608 2017-08-07 04:35:28 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @funder @mscheryl58 @fpfromME You poor thing.

894736574570569728 2017-08-07 01:46:37 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 The next person who suggests that Dems who are not far left Dems are perforce "conservative Dems" gets a swift kick.
894685206203875328 2017-08-07 22:22:30 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @GOP This is an arrant lie, and the GOP should be deeply ashamed of tweeting this nonsense. Stop lying.
894587309449912322 2017-08-07 15:53:29 UTC <Suavebones> @BillCorbett @susanorlean The Regeneration Trilogy by Pat Barker, about WW I. Stunning novels.

894437200271613953 2017-08-06 05:57:01 UTC <Suavebones> @PageV503 @Breznican I think this is a pre-emptive strike on Medicaid. Open season on seniors = fewer surviving nursing home seniors to suck down Medicaid.

894433912834752512 2017-08-06 05:43:57 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Rich Republican. Says it all.
894429294193135617 2017-08-06 05:25:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic "News" from the unreliable and crazed Louise Mensch? C'mon. Unless she can link to actual evidence, she cannot be believed.
894345333177671681 2017-08-06 23:51:58 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Sure - kill off the oldsters quicker. Perfectly in keeping with GOP philosophy.
894209392211447811 2017-08-06 14:51:47 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA @jclare5269 Oh. Sorry - I am becoming unable to ID snark in these strange days.
894207836636434432 2017-08-06 14:45:36 UTC <Suavebones> @jclare5269 @TeaPainUSA Beg to disagree. Trump's legal "team" ranges from experienced to mind-numbingly stupid.
894206977626169348 2017-08-06 14:42:11 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon And ... you're a man, right? So what does being pro-life look like for you? The minute you put those words into action, you are anti-choice.
894206404587683841 2017-08-06 14:39:55 UTC <Suavebones> @PolticalAtheist Forcing women to bear children they do not want is a form of tyranny. I hope you are also pro-choice.
894173471055372288 2017-08-06 12:29:03 UTC <Suavebones> @PuestoLoco These newfangled legal devices, sheesh. GJs have only been around since the 12th century - enough with this innovation!

894172251880161281 2017-08-06 12:24:12 UTC <Suavebones> My thought exactly.
894172120283926528 2017-08-06 12:23:41 UTC <Suavebones> @kayleighmcenany @InMedioSitu @_deanhughes Eight GOP Benghazi investigations found no wrongdoing by O or HRC, and you're *still* whining? Sorry - you have zero credibility.
894170717847035909 2017-08-06 12:18:06 UTC <Suavebones> Of course. Didn't you read the handbook? The only financial crimes that count are those that hurt the rich.
894169178457886722 2017-08-06 12:11:59 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @kimbudant Plus, they look like brothers. Ultra-creepy.
894168756498210817 2017-08-06 12:10:19 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @LauzetaVentador Yes, but those are the very reasons 45 should choose him. It will create yet another stain on the presidency.
894168122793508865 2017-08-06 12:07:47 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPain @kjblackhawk @bloodrootholler There's many a slip between impanelling a GJ and issuing indictments. Don't assume that part will go smoothly.

893917309043040256 2017-08-05 19:31:09 UTC <Suavebones> @MichaelGaree What about Managing Director of Phlogiston?
893863739392270336 2017-08-05 15:58:17 UTC <Suavebones> @marcushjohnson The culture of cheating and greed *did* exist in 1977 and Reagan, three years later,  was its apotheosis.
893862978159747073 2017-08-05 15:55:15 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @SabaSmw I do. The alt-left used this argument above all others to taint Hillary as a "corporatist shill." It seems to be successful, albeit wrong.
893858422210215936 2017-08-05 15:37:09 UTC <Suavebones> @EBlumberg11 This pusillanimous little ferret ...
893857087020711936 2017-08-05 15:31:51 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @WilliamOMalley7 He has the correct credentials - white supremacist, anti-Semite, stone cold liar, isolationist ... what more could 45 want in the WH?
893855041584480257 2017-08-05 15:23:43 UTC <Suavebones> @cholt55 @yashar I keep wondering why some men think their dicks are so attractive that women will just naturally want to see them?
893854700910501889 2017-08-05 15:22:22 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady This show is such a terrible idea. How is it "censorship" to admit that a show may be so hurtful and misguided that it should be dumped?
893850453191962625 2017-08-05 15:05:29 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol I read the whole thing and found it utterly unilluminating. Was there some special nugget I missed?
893693868553650177 2017-08-04 04:43:16 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz Totally agree! I don't love every position, but I genuinely like her - whip-smart, very funny, and dedicated to bettering the US
893689451326488577 2017-08-04 04:25:43 UTC <Suavebones> @ActualEPAFacts @ShelleyDeeeeee Congrats on the excellent outcome!! Such relief.
893688513081757696 2017-08-04 04:22:00 UTC <Suavebones> @ActualEPAFacts I bought wedding rings with my dearest love.
893665050929516549 2017-08-04 02:48:46 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara Hardly, if what you have your eye on is 45.
893664858889048065 2017-08-04 02:48:00 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Oh, great thundering mastodons - who needs this person?!
893658582125731840 2017-08-04 02:23:04 UTC <Suavebones> #MartinWingo is my new hero!https://twitter.com/maudelancsaster/status/893493398736338949
893595912706166784 2017-08-04 22:14:02 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Grand juries - sitting since the mid-1100s, but suddenly "unconstitutional."
893588566319575040 2017-08-04 21:44:50 UTC <Suavebones> @amandablount2 I've got a big problem with it. These are not *toys* - no child plays at ironing. They are just mini versions of "women's work."
893588012294066176 2017-08-04 21:42:38 UTC <Suavebones> @StephanieMoaz This is one of the most appalling decisions I have seen in recent years. This will be the GOP's true legacy - poisoning the courts.
893586738790014976 2017-08-04 21:37:35 UTC <Suavebones> @prdickinson I am so sorry, Mr. Dickinson. How the disgusting acts of these defendants could lead to a decision bastardizing the 8th A beggars belief.
893586303261921280 2017-08-04 21:35:51 UTC <Suavebones> @prdickinson @fabucat @Buckleup36 It is a first, I believe, that a federal appellate court has ruled that length of sentence *for an adult* is cruel and unusual. Sickening.
893583897795059712 2017-08-04 21:26:17 UTC <Suavebones> @Dim_Whitman @yashar Will not watch. Too disgusting.
893560313412370432 2017-08-04 19:52:34 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis @KailiJoy Two photos, three jerks.
893559249892028416 2017-08-04 19:48:21 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane Yeah, but - just because a lot of people agree on something doesn't make them right.
893555552843816960 2017-08-04 19:33:39 UTC <Suavebones> @Eugene_Scott @BLH62 Oh, and you know that stuff about her merits and affirmative action - how? Unless you're her mother, this sounds racist af to me.
893554378728030209 2017-08-04 19:28:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Haven't read the opinion yet, but it looks like a perversion of the Constitution to me. The holding is *not* supported by SCOTUS precedent.
893553470820634624 2017-08-04 19:25:23 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 Pharma Bro is saying he beat the Feds 5 counts to 3. He doesn't seem to understand that this isn't the way criminal convictions work.
893552987846565889 2017-08-04 19:23:28 UTC <Suavebones> Blackwater - a 30 yr sentence of adults for manslaughter is "cruel and unusual," says DC Cir. This is a shocking and unprecedented holding.
893547410168750080 2017-08-04 19:01:18 UTC <Suavebones> @UTLaw I have been a lawyer in a corporation. I am here to tell you that this plan seems - um - unreasonable on its face.
893541999709519872 2017-08-04 18:39:48 UTC <Suavebones> @AriMelber @DrDenaGrayson Sadly, the US judiciary does not support the unconstitutionality of jailing reporters to get their sources. Just ask Judith Miller.
893536325437071360 2017-08-04 18:17:15 UTC <Suavebones> @LeChatNoire4 @profevanbennett A dumbfounding comment by a man who set out to find fraud in a real estate deal and found only a thin lie about a blow job.
893529955467837440 2017-08-04 17:51:57 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Sadly, you are incorrect. In the last four decades, there has been precious little judicial protection of US journalists and their sources.
893523218945855488 2017-08-04 17:25:10 UTC <Suavebones> @AngryBlackLady @fjrsally @Jenifa_0_Jenny Different degrees of oppression. See the disparate pay between white women and WoC for confirmation.
893497987338391553 2017-08-04 15:44:55 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @musicaamazigh He isn't "hiding." His husband is not American and cannot get residency, so they live in Brazil.
893496984790683648 2017-08-04 15:40:56 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @dhcammel Thank you for saying this. I feel so let down by GG. Keep wondering if Ed Snowden agrees at this point.
893488221966835712 2017-08-04 15:06:06 UTC <Suavebones> @thedailybeast You're literally saving my life, @TheRickWilson. The searing condemnation, rich wit and peak analysis in this piece made this my *best* week
893482821704007681 2017-08-04 14:44:39 UTC <Suavebones> @JKH2 Don't bother knocking your head against this asshole's wall. He has been a racist creep since before you were born. Block and forget him.
893412646808035328 2017-08-04 10:05:48 UTC <Suavebones> @cottage_orchard Exactly.
893412288148848641 2017-08-04 10:04:22 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @objkshn Au contraire. Most attorneys know that proving obstruction of justice against senior gov't officials is unusual and damned difficult.
893408800077524992 2017-08-04 09:50:31 UTC <Suavebones> @brianklaas Wow - Tribe was making a dark joke about a horrible person. Ease up on the puritanical judgments. Miller NEEDS to be denounced.
893405141340012544 2017-08-04 09:35:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Oh, ffs ...
893344649649111041 2017-08-03 05:35:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic I quote 45's Michael Cohen here: "Sez who?!"

893318720193347585 2017-08-03 03:52:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Oh, nonsense.
893316798988169216 2017-08-03 03:44:56 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Oh, I see. Jorge can't read or interpret emails.
893314328580861953 2017-08-03 03:35:07 UTC <Suavebones> @JYSexton Not exactly hidden ...
893312775946092545 2017-08-03 03:28:57 UTC <Suavebones> @zeitgeistbabe @TeaPainUSA Link please - cannot find it on CNN ...
893311688983797761 2017-08-03 03:24:38 UTC <Suavebones> @CharlesPPierce Gee, and to think GJs have only been around since the mid-12th century. Who needs this newfangled legal gimcrackery?
893310682178797569 2017-08-03 03:20:38 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @Trump1982 Gee, just wondering - where did your family come from that you are so protective of this land?
893309634722672640 2017-08-03 03:16:28 UTC <Suavebones> @MrDane1982 Go away, Jorge. Your group of Bros elected Trump, and Dems are never, ever going to forgive you. Go vote somewhere else.
893309133507645440 2017-08-03 03:14:28 UTC <Suavebones> What a pathetic and deluded person you are. Pick up ANY medical text about gender - there is an arc of gender identity, physical and emotnl.
893308322044039168 2017-08-03 03:11:15 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 He should read medical articles before dying on that "two genders only" hill. Even physically, drs. agree that an arc of genders exists.
893281997283401728 2017-08-03 01:26:39 UTC <Suavebones> @jtacuff It's a thing of beauty ...
893281204522303488 2017-08-03 01:23:30 UTC <Suavebones> @luvman33wife @JoyAnnReid Investigate her - for WHAT? She must be the most investigated person in history. Did someone forget to DNA test a Kleenex or something?
893268887227080704 2017-08-03 00:34:33 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood @wavetossed Oh, PLEASE point out where HRC (or anyone else related to HRC) talks about sex with children in emails. And why so obsessed w/ topic?
893267748310007808 2017-08-03 00:30:01 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @LBonPlanetEarth Confirmed. It has been sitting for several months.
893267636724695041 2017-08-03 00:29:35 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @GershwinForever He can pardon Flynn at any point, regardless of a sitting grand jury, or indictments, etc.
893267396567343106 2017-08-03 00:28:38 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @mmdornconsult If indictments are forthcoming, they are still probably months away. Obtaining financial documents and tracing transactions = slow process.
893266924250963969 2017-08-03 00:26:45 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @ChrisMc33145026 Pardons would not have any effect on (1) impeachment, or (2) state law crimes, such as those NY AG Eric Schneiderman is busily investigating
893120788244516864 2017-08-03 14:46:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent What story? What side? He was and is entirely irrelevant.
893120061354819584 2017-08-03 14:43:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JonathanTurley @AlanDersh @ZeldaLackner Never. Grossly-inflated egos such as theirs never admit error.
893111307267825668 2017-08-03 14:08:23 UTC <Suavebones> @jbouie What a crock of hot BS. Yet another right-winger trying to blame the left for everything.
893075537194700800 2017-08-03 11:46:15 UTC <Suavebones> @hotandhumid Sorry to hear it - hope the new cushion offers some relief.
893074995793977344 2017-08-03 11:44:06 UTC <Suavebones> @MalcolmNance @peterdaou @nebraskaredrose Nope. You Bernie folks are highjacking a party that even Bernie doesn't want to belong to. We don't want you, either.
893074531824287745 2017-08-03 11:42:15 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood @JeffFlake You're going to need to expand the definition of "merit-based" to be able to think both those things at once, Senator.
893070532614135808 2017-08-03 11:26:22 UTC <Suavebones> @jjmacnab We really have reached the end times.
893068120830521344 2017-08-03 11:16:47 UTC <Suavebones> @VABVOX Thank you for taking the time to stand up for female candidates and against the bots/bros. Wishing you better health ...
893005163727683584 2017-08-03 07:06:36 UTC <Suavebones> @ClaraJeffery @Lewisd82Daniel Oh, THAT is definitely true. Never have I seen so many average thinkers who were assured of their own brilliance.
893004587409448961 2017-08-03 07:04:19 UTC <Suavebones> @preferscleanH2O @JoyAnnReid Miller is nothing if not utterly dishonest.
893003994506776576 2017-08-03 07:01:58 UTC <Suavebones> @BretEastonEllis Because you are now, as you always were, a complete peckerwood?
893002123436150784 2017-08-02 06:54:32 UTC <Suavebones> @amikegreen2 Are there sentient white Americans who get these answers wrong?
892967997656096768 2017-08-02 04:38:55 UTC <Suavebones> @chrisgeidner On my parents' bookshelves when I was a child. Read it when I was nine.

892871436221636608 2017-08-02 22:15:13 UTC <Suavebones> @funder "I uncovered these documents" is stretching it - they were publicly available from the outset of his campaign.
892871030728937472 2017-08-02 22:13:37 UTC <Suavebones> @MollyJongFast Your dog is a wise old soul who, I hope, will take the opportunity to piss on Miller's pants' legs at the earliest opportunity. Hugs, pup!
892808441579700224 2017-08-02 18:04:54 UTC <Suavebones> @JKH2 Block that jerk.
892802945388957696 2017-08-02 17:43:04 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol Just like his inauguration crowd size lie - easily disprovable, utterly unnecessary and yet seemingly necessary to his sense of self-worth.
892778583432716289 2017-08-02 16:06:15 UTC <Suavebones> @ACLU DOJ had to circulate its internal recruiting memo because no career staffers would touch this investigation.
892601627734966272 2017-08-01 04:23:06 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @4HollyF Yes. Yes to all of it.
892601491751485441 2017-08-01 04:22:34 UTC <Suavebones> @InxsyS Hilarious, if true.
892600981606719488 2017-08-01 04:20:32 UTC <Suavebones> @sr92637 He would never get my vote in a squillion years. He is currently my Senator and votes reliably with the far-right Freedom Caucus.
892599839308922880 2017-08-01 04:16:00 UTC <Suavebones> @DemocracyValues @jodotcom @whitja @Hektor0 The problem is that he cannot deliver on those ideas. He has *never* delivered on those ideas. He lives in a fantasy world.
892597623248478210 2017-08-01 04:07:11 UTC <Suavebones> @preferscleanH2O @GreatDismal You don't see prepuce on Twitter every day.
892585678931771392 2017-08-01 03:19:43 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson But of course. He never intended to sign it.
892582414534443009 2017-08-01 03:06:45 UTC <Suavebones> @WalshFreedom I will work ceaselessly to make sure you are deprived of that right. Nobody outside LEOs needs to carry a gun on a daily basis.
892433405152862208 2017-08-01 17:14:39 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol There were calls between the plane, Jr. and some attorney (probably Kasowicz).
892399976868917249 2017-08-01 15:01:49 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSanders @jmartNYT @RoseAnnDeMoro You mean "Democrats." Bernie is not a Dem.
892256910765772804 2017-07-31 05:33:19 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Is your White House on the same planet as mine? You hired Mooch, he imploded, you dictated a phony tale for Jr., and it's only Monday ... .
892255036130119680 2017-07-31 05:25:52 UTC <Suavebones> @OccupyDemocrats @grantstern @itzjamie55 "Much less" makeup? You mean "none," right? She does't have a shred of makeup on. Only notable because she is usually heavily made up.
892253144364838912 2017-07-31 05:18:21 UTC <Suavebones> @JaySekulow @tedlieu Key word: knowingly. As far as I can tell, Sekulow knows absolutely nothing.
892252913426468864 2017-07-31 05:17:26 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol It is someone newly free to talk, who also has some axes to grind, and who was there on the plane with Trump. Would Reince or Spicer qualify
892251232898867200 2017-07-31 05:10:45 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol @roslynbraun31 There is a penchant among lawyers in the NY-DC corridor to use the word "fulsome" to mean "full and complete." It's stupid, yet intractable.
892175461631045632 2017-07-31 00:09:40 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump @MrsHobbittoes Um, no need to coin phrases that (continue to) belittle females ...
892174165045911552 2017-07-31 00:04:31 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @DearAuntCrabby Oh, puh-leeze. Jeff Flake *just voted* to take down Ocare. Do not confuse Jeff with someone who gives a shit for the citizenry.
892172777016483842 2017-07-31 23:59:00 UTC <Suavebones> @adamcbest It's also hypocritical af, since he is just 48 hours past his vote to eviscerate Ocare.
891882602818351105 2017-07-30 04:45:57 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Very impressive speed!
891882389315571712 2017-07-30 04:45:06 UTC <Suavebones> @paleofuture This killed me!

891868377228210176 2017-07-30 03:49:25 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh And those two words are only the beginning of the horrid characteristics attributable to him.

891862453683933185 2017-07-30 03:25:53 UTC <Suavebones> @TVietor08 He *seriously* does not understand government staffing.
891861634490171392 2017-07-30 03:22:38 UTC <Suavebones> @yashar Puh-leeze. She has been T-friendly and HRC unfriendly. Those are points of view, not just what she "sees and hears."
891861043588329472 2017-07-30 03:20:17 UTC <Suavebones> @TheBatcave_SS @horsecrazybean @MightyGuin71 @ZTVComedyNews @smart_ass_lynn Your little Fox News world might not have reported them, but EVERYBODY ELSE did.
891796428284198912 2017-07-30 23:03:31 UTC <Suavebones> @ManMet80 Anyone who voted for this monstrosity should be deported to, say, St. Helena. It was good enough for Napoleon.
891794196914462720 2017-07-30 22:54:39 UTC <Suavebones> @MSNBC @FieldingFishly @JenKirkman Why was this woman *ever* given any air time?
891793491365376002 2017-07-30 22:51:51 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @CLewandowski_ @MarieLeff That's not the way the civil service works. For obvious reasons, one party *cannot,* by law, remove all gov't employees of opp. party.
891540586603458560 2017-07-29 06:06:54 UTC <Suavebones> @tmbrown327 Oh, swell - another Trumpian lining his pockets using a gov't position as a staging ground.
891529839500554241 2017-07-29 05:24:12 UTC <Suavebones> @BigBrain1234 @JasonKander If you have a paid job, it is illegal to be on your parents' healthcare. Anyone paying you, Tomi? Yeah, thought so ...
891452674150944773 2017-07-29 00:17:34 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost @Endoracrat What a surprise! (No, not really.)
891040247454220288 2017-07-28 20:58:44 UTC <Suavebones> @lisamurkowski Thank you @LisaMurkowski for your leadership & protecting care for millions in AK & across the US! #IStandWithPPhttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/d70yu/4lc0x

890955854651899909 2017-07-28 15:23:23 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 He's my Senator and I loathe him. But sometimes good things happen for mixed reasons. You don't have to lionize him, but be glad he did it.
890954839160610816 2017-07-28 15:19:21 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald Speak for yourself. It sure isn't *my* fault.
890953701782716416 2017-07-28 15:14:50 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 @kagekini Who cares why he did it? He did it. Not one other male Senator did.
890831540745150464 2017-07-28 07:09:24 UTC <Suavebones> I will keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare, so millions of Americans can afford the quality health care they need.https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54iotyz/4kxp3
890807834035671041 2017-07-27 05:35:12 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @JBEnglish1 Anxiety, often contributing to an upset stomach.
890798562765701122 2017-07-27 04:58:22 UTC <Suavebones> @jpodhoretz And yet the horror is coming 100% from your political fellow travelers. Can you not - just this once - condemn them *directly*?
890798083524542464 2017-07-27 04:56:27 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid Comforted that you're here - thanks. It is such a bitter and ugly night, we need all the kind hearts and loud voices we can muster.
890759409625726976 2017-07-27 02:22:47 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @theshb23 Say, that one *was* suspicious ... oh, wait ...
890744452012138498 2017-07-27 01:23:21 UTC <Suavebones> @Scaramucci You are so clueless, you do not understand how to communicate with reporters - off the record, on background. The fault is entirely yours
890734998629662721 2017-07-27 00:45:47 UTC <Suavebones> @ChadPergram @yeah2low For what? What exactly do you think is the crime that needs to be investigated?
890734430871928832 2017-07-27 00:43:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny He's flaming out so quickly, my guess is by Labor Day.
890701472131727360 2017-07-27 22:32:34 UTC <Suavebones> @ShaunKing @SaysHummingbird Isn't she just execrable??
890701178853392384 2017-07-27 22:31:24 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis Wouldn't it be better if he *stopped* making statements, at least until the 'snow' melts?
890700766482014213 2017-07-27 22:29:45 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 When do we start seeing either of those guys? Practically everything he has done this week is stupid, and he seems hysterical, not tough.
890697161725231105 2017-07-27 22:15:26 UTC <Suavebones> @hesanihilist By all means, do what you need to do. I get it. 
890696753174896644 2017-07-27 22:13:48 UTC <Suavebones> @Scaramucci @anniekarni @terrij68 Exactly. Well, I cursed at my job too, but I wasn't speaking *for POTUS* or talking *to the press* at the time. Mooch is just pathetic.
890696168346230784 2017-07-27 22:11:29 UTC <Suavebones> @Scaramucci @MattMurph24 @anniekarni Yeah, we all know this language and some of us use it daily - but not if we're the fucking voice of POTUS & talking to a reporter.
890695316852355072 2017-07-27 22:08:06 UTC <Suavebones> @BeSeriousUSA Such excellent "communication" skills.
890694876957769728 2017-07-27 22:06:21 UTC <Suavebones> Don't get caught up arguing with assholes like this, @hesanihilist - just block and move on. He's not worth the pixels it takes to deal w/.
890623259586183168 2017-07-27 17:21:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SopanDeb Well, the Oxford comma *is* serious business.
890622909886078982 2017-07-27 17:20:23 UTC <Suavebones> @TimOBrien Not to mention being a lawyer who falsely asserted that this disclosure was a *felony*.
890429120965771264 2017-07-26 04:30:20 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Looking for my micrometer calipers - must see if I detest Carlson fractionally more than I detest 45. It's possible.
890426157765545984 2017-07-26 04:18:33 UTC <Suavebones> @Reince45 @TheJusticeDept @FBI @Scaramucci Take a moment to appreciate that Mr. "I have a Harvard law degree" doesn't know what a felony is.
890424125499392001 2017-07-26 04:10:29 UTC <Suavebones> @TheJusticeDept @FBI @Scaramucci, bellyaching and threatening may be what your boss does, but take a cue from his results: doesn't work. Do better, Harvard boy.
890422910736769024 2017-07-26 04:05:39 UTC <Suavebones> @TheJusticeDept @FBI @Scaramucci @KnowYourObama @annieCdhondt1 @ReneeReneecerny @cjackson65 You really have no clue how DC works, do you?
890422429918547968 2017-07-26 04:03:45 UTC <Suavebones> @3DTruth Go ahead. It is unconstitutional.
890396377875759104 2017-07-26 02:20:13 UTC <Suavebones> @a35362 Oh, I see - a Bernie supporter. Bye.
890393651599167488 2017-07-26 02:09:23 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 @joshrogin It is inconceivable to me how much petty, small-minded hatred this administration embodies.
890392122699808768 2017-07-26 02:03:19 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump My family = in America about ten generations longer than yours, and we do not worship God. Conflating patriotism with religion is moronic.
890391486428094464 2017-07-26 02:00:47 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump I. Have. Zero. Fucks. To. Give. About. Melania.

890388617192914944 2017-07-26 01:49:23 UTC <Suavebones> @Caitlyn_Jenner @eileendefreest Caitlyn Jenner has a stupidity problem. Not uncommon among the idle rich.
890388112861388800 2017-07-26 01:47:23 UTC <Suavebones> @thecitizenpost1 The military is, by all accounts, having a hard time recruiting. And you think it's a "nothing burger" to toss out 15,000 active duty folks?
890387557153816577 2017-07-26 01:45:10 UTC <Suavebones> @Thatonegoalscrr No, it can't affect the battle. A person who is deemed fit to serve in their current position is wholly qualified. Your opinion d/n count.
890386491171520513 2017-07-26 01:40:56 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis These horrible, brainless people at the WH ...
890243941584470016 2017-07-26 16:14:30 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald I expect you to tell the truth. Dems had clear messages in the '16 election. Misogynist men pretended not to hear them. Looking at you, Kurt
890240275028877313 2017-07-26 15:59:56 UTC <Suavebones> Thank you, Josh and ACLU!
890239294199214081 2017-07-26 15:56:02 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 I wish there were whole countries full of you, Chloe!
890239058412265472 2017-07-26 15:55:06 UTC <Suavebones> @KeenanBlogger Not to mention the trans soldiers already serving honorably in the military who are about to be kicked out of their jobs ...
890226268997910528 2017-07-26 15:04:16 UTC <Suavebones> @paleofuture OMG, this flipping imbecile ...
890225477444657154 2017-07-26 15:01:08 UTC <Suavebones> @AthertonKD @paleofuture @geoffbelknap Spot on.
890220624425213953 2017-07-26 14:41:51 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Unseemly? You've heard our President make appalling comments every day, but *this* is "unseemly"? You've lost track of what the word means.
890100866354733056 2017-07-25 06:45:58 UTC <Suavebones> @JamesFourM @yottapoint @liljwells Ah, but he was not *convicted.*
890094343498993670 2017-07-25 06:20:03 UTC <Suavebones> @tinyboo49 @KAmorphous I knew when I was 5 years old that the GOP was full of bad people. How do *they* fail to see it.
890092469895008259 2017-07-25 06:12:36 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @Endoracrat So nice that he was simultaneously introducing his kid to mindless rage-hatred.
890070620964311040 2017-07-25 04:45:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Sativa888 Men. And other men.
890063624215162880 2017-07-25 04:17:59 UTC <Suavebones> @CuevasMarla Exactly right. Even if a thing he says appears, momentarily, to mean something, he bursts the bubble of meaning three seconds later.
890063052661551107 2017-07-25 04:15:42 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @mmpadellan She's blocked. Who needs that shit?
890061838968381440 2017-07-25 04:10:53 UTC <Suavebones> We see you, @Scaramucci and we don't like whar we see. Another lying jerk.
890060846013046785 2017-07-25 04:06:56 UTC <Suavebones> @aravosis @ThorgrimurJohn It's also a pleasantly buzzy restaurant in Phoenix - wouldn't want to tarnish them either.
890060224643649539 2017-07-25 04:04:28 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane Sweet dreams, I hope.
890042390362415105 2017-07-25 02:53:36 UTC <Suavebones> @naretevduorp But that's the essence of all political disagreements that involve human well-being. Where you stand is who you are.
890017526230417410 2017-07-25 01:14:48 UTC <Suavebones> @ThomasBenefield @JoyAnnReid Wait and see ... you may ultimately be right, but the final vote has not yet been taken.
890017222948782080 2017-07-25 01:13:36 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou He hasn't voted on the substantive bill yet. Wait and see ...
890016974725623810 2017-07-25 01:12:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Im_TheAntiTrump Your situation sounds awful - so sorry to hear it. Move heaven and earth to get marijuana edibles or sublingual tinctures for pain mgmt
890015803646595072 2017-07-25 01:07:57 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald But you repeat yourself ...
890013884505051137 2017-07-25 01:00:20 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol Well, yeah, but he also swore an oath to tell the truth to Congress and breezed right past that obligation ... .
890013356979089408 2017-07-25 00:58:14 UTC <Suavebones> @Stonekettle Hasn't quite sold out yet - wait for the final vote.
890013139391188995 2017-07-25 00:57:22 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol We'll see, won't we?
890012322835681280 2017-07-25 00:54:08 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnJHarwood It is worth remembering that the man has an aggressive tumor pressing against his brain ...
890011407361744897 2017-07-25 00:50:29 UTC <Suavebones> @beardyblue @HistoryJosh My bottom line is that I, as a Dem, could never have been friends with the oleaginous McCain, so the hug issue wouldn't have arisen.
889711278306078721 2017-07-24 04:57:53 UTC <Suavebones> @MSNBC @ZeldaLackner @kylegriffin1 Yeah, because that could not have been corrected immediately ...
889701494848708609 2017-07-24 04:19:00 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Guess WaPo is about to drop something HUGE on your head if you're working so hard to discredit tgem.
889515994800160770 2017-07-24 16:01:54 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Hillary has been investigated and exonerated. She is not President, so her Russian dealings, if any, are not an issue. JUST SHUT UP!
889425570739695616 2017-07-24 10:02:35 UTC <Suavebones> @EricLevitz @SafetyPinDaily Exceeding them, actually.
889413418180063232 2017-07-24 09:14:18 UTC <Suavebones> @LeChatNoire4 @yottapoint I'm having Whitwater flashbacks ...
889295317652443136 2017-07-23 01:25:00 UTC <Suavebones> @Spicerlies It's a crime to lie to Congress, regardless of whether one is under oath.
889291183146627073 2017-07-23 01:08:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Hope you're back in the fight tomorrow.
889025429796933633 2017-07-23 07:32:34 UTC <Suavebones> @MxJackMonroe The reason this is an obvious parody is that balloons are nice and friendly, two attributes that Trump is unassociated with.
888883753023557633 2017-07-22 22:09:36 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @connie_rodeconn I figure if child sex trafficking allegations didn't spur Hillary to sue, nothing will.
888883294896443393 2017-07-22 22:07:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @PeterArnottGlas @nearnormal20 @yoopermoose Hey, that's a very good appraisal of the situation. I thank you. Poe thanks you. The Raven, sadly, does not care one way or the other.
888880390210961408 2017-07-22 21:56:14 UTC <Suavebones> @LeahResistance @TeaPainUSA @SusanDoyle1963 Eggs-actly.
888880241594089472 2017-07-22 21:55:38 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA @koester_liz Uh-oh. You're no longer welcome on Planet Earth. Please self-deport to Mars, soonest. 
888879966074490880 2017-07-22 21:54:33 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA @RobertWRaeburn1 Same here. Trump doesn't have the cognitive skills to connect those dots.
888865412217061376 2017-07-22 20:56:43 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Dowd, though hardly a newcomer to the legal fray, just made a rookie error in implying that POTUS *has* committed crimes.
888860830925586432 2017-07-22 20:38:30 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood @RobertRio22 Only one "predicate act" for RICO needs to be w/in the SoLs.
888859974561964036 2017-07-22 20:35:06 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood @Rogue_Element_6 Hahahahaha!!
888859648211566596 2017-07-22 20:33:49 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @Autarkh @JohnJHarwood @Discon1948 Nor can anyone else he immunized. Not that this pack of hyenas would know the truth if it bit their balls off.
888859353138077696 2017-07-22 20:32:38 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood Sure.
888859213891387392 2017-07-22 20:32:05 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood @294thMPCo Gee, I dunno - probably just as soon as we figure out whether this POTUS is selling the USA to Russia.
888858757404401665 2017-07-22 20:30:16 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood @JMBBexar Or ongoing conspiracy.
888858447822831616 2017-07-22 20:29:02 UTC <Suavebones> @AuthorPMBarrett @JohnJHarwood Hahahaha!!  He's already ID'd the crimes and what their SoLs are!
888857969151975424 2017-07-22 20:27:08 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @SethAbramson Arrant BS from the BSer in Chief.
888822830007177217 2017-07-22 18:07:30 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat "Comey crimes"? Wtf?
888680073821208576 2017-07-22 08:40:15 UTC <Suavebones> @MattGertz @milguy23 Assumes facts not in evidence.
888632137355636737 2017-07-21 05:29:46 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump @MrsHobbittoes Fair enough. Thoughts and prayers to Melissa McCarthy, though ...
888630933821169665 2017-07-21 05:24:59 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Jeez, stop engaging with these people, Joan!
888630004673724416 2017-07-21 05:21:17 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump @MrsHobbittoes Screw Spicey. He has been an unabashed serial liar for six months, and deserves no psychological respite or ease of conscience.
888629207265271808 2017-07-21 05:18:07 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Oh, trust me, I'm "raging."
888589639610580992 2017-07-21 02:40:53 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @docrocktex26 Sessions is inflicting lasting damage on large groups of people.
888587402159116290 2017-07-21 02:32:00 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid I helped incorporate a small biz for a friend who never used it. Disclosed on my fed fin form. Threatened with being fired from my agency.
888586186968580096 2017-07-21 02:27:10 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @devinher @billionairther Thank you.

888584938508779521 2017-07-21 02:22:13 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @barbvas With great respect, @SamHarrisOrg, wasn't this fact already obvious?
888584192216383489 2017-07-21 02:19:15 UTC <Suavebones> @scubapuppy @tribelaw @frossiemae Love this theory!
888583918491795457 2017-07-21 02:18:09 UTC <Suavebones> Oh, that's *perfect*!!
888583743622926336 2017-07-21 02:17:28 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos Turley is a smooth-talking hack. I should know - I took a course in Environmental Crimes from him 20 years ago. Self-aggrandizing half-wit.
888582448652537856 2017-07-21 02:12:19 UTC <Suavebones> @BirdsGetStarted Paramount. You meant paramount.
888581457735700481 2017-07-21 02:08:23 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Maggie exceeded her validity a long time ago.
888581141103493120 2017-07-21 02:07:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny A money-grubbing scumbag with his lips sealed to Trump's ass? Just guessing here ...
888580793085251584 2017-07-21 02:05:44 UTC <Suavebones> @Amy_Siskind Shhhh ... don't say things that might raise the dead!!
888577828429545472 2017-07-21 01:53:57 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis Hillary never testified publicly about emails. Regarding Benghazi, she demanded that the testimony be public.
888576993049968641 2017-07-21 01:50:38 UTC <Suavebones> @benjaminwittes Leak was probably the first fruit of the joint US-Russia CyberSecurity Working Group.
888531877568446464 2017-07-21 22:51:22 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem Excellent!
888531116725911552 2017-07-21 22:48:20 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan Gawd no! Keep that leper away from D party politics.
888530158390464512 2017-07-21 22:44:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Scaramucci Liar.
888529492913696768 2017-07-21 22:41:53 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Exactly.
888509302650003457 2017-07-21 21:21:40 UTC <Suavebones> @DanaPerino @SarahHuckabee @jaketapper Somehow, I don't think SHS is a step forward for women.
888491275464261635 2017-07-21 20:10:02 UTC <Suavebones> @amelie811 Are there any unpaid whores? Asking for a friend ...
888490761477472257 2017-07-21 20:07:59 UTC <Suavebones> @owillis Oh, THAT explains it. I thought I'd come unglued.
888490194613264385 2017-07-21 20:05:44 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost Sad for the country to have had a WH spox so willing to lie freely, obviously and with no apparent remorse. Stop feeling sad for Spicer!
888489733973659648 2017-07-21 20:03:54 UTC <Suavebones> @noelcourage This wretched man - he belongs in the Ralph Nader hall of shame.
888489410076975104 2017-07-21 20:02:37 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic I got 99 problems and that ain't one of them.
888487769667903488 2017-07-21 19:56:06 UTC <Suavebones> @hesanihilist And oh those results - criminal indictments, prosecu ... oh, wait
888474771633053696 2017-07-21 19:04:27 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Leave the lying liar alone? Why? Can't think of anyone better to harass.
888470694064930816 2017-07-21 18:48:15 UTC <Suavebones> @StollmeyerEU @1DareDevil2017 @MattAsherS @MrScottLads @gbmnyc @1Jedi_Rey @TheSWPrincess @JynErso_2017 @16061616061c Been in the history books for 40 years. Justice Gorsuch's mom used it to describe a consolation apptmt she got after being sacked from EPA.
888469372343271424 2017-07-21 18:42:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic They say that as though it's a bad thing ...
888468989080256512 2017-07-21 18:41:28 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM MSM - stop booking this inveterate liar.
888468586007633920 2017-07-21 18:39:52 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM @ctbballfan Thank you. I keep thinking Ken is the poster boy for why KC's argument is nonsense.
888467622076923904 2017-07-21 18:36:02 UTC <Suavebones> @MerrillLynch Home equity can disappear very quickly. I know - I watched $175,000 vanish in about four months in 2007-08, and I never recovered it.
888467031481212929 2017-07-21 18:33:41 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Spicer lied daily to serve a despicable master. And you are *sorry* that he was denied a chance to meet the Holiest of Holies? Oh, honestly.
888464974418288640 2017-07-21 18:25:31 UTC <Suavebones> @Limericking Outstanding!
888462364718252032 2017-07-21 18:15:09 UTC <Suavebones> @RogueSNRadvisor Balls? To lie every single day? I'll take ovaries, thanks.
888462108215529474 2017-07-21 18:14:08 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Why care if the *lying Sean Spicer* met - or was denied the chance to meet - the Pope? In some circles, it might be called karma ... .
888384918757056512 2017-07-21 13:07:24 UTC <Suavebones> @waltshaub @catmidnite Jeez, what a depressing thought.
888384721792585729 2017-07-21 13:06:37 UTC <Suavebones> Thank you, @waltshaub, for serving your country so admirably.
888174321264320512 2017-07-20 23:10:34 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald There isn't a single word I need to hear from people so delusional and/or evil as to support Trump. Even if my hair is on fire.
888173426787012608 2017-07-20 23:07:01 UTC <Suavebones> @Spicerlies R'amen!!
888172860644012032 2017-07-20 23:04:46 UTC <Suavebones> @AlanDersh @NormEisen If this were an ordinary politician, I might consider the issue of partisanship. But we have instead an amoral monster - investigate!!
888163304945762304 2017-07-20 22:26:47 UTC <Suavebones> @Dave_Fox Adlai Stevenson lost.
888152565543612416 2017-07-20 21:44:07 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @TheDemCoalition It's like the insurance we paid 25 cents for in grade school that would pay out if you lost one eye and a foot, or one arm and one leg ...
888151714586546176 2017-07-20 21:40:44 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis You guys who sent J and G money are part of the reason we are *in* this hopeless morass.
888151378467577856 2017-07-20 21:39:24 UTC <Suavebones> @hesanihilist How can *anything* be leverage if it is immediately exposed by MSM, as this was?!?
888148544342810625 2017-07-20 21:28:08 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny My thinking as well.
888148230990462981 2017-07-20 21:26:53 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny I have inquired of my mind and whatever essence might comprise a soul, and discovered that I simply don't give a hoot.
888099100805267456 2017-07-20 18:11:40 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes @PaulBegala It is impossible to form a coherent reaction to such random, nonsensical utterances.
888091826980216832 2017-07-20 17:42:46 UTC <Suavebones> @kjblackhawk @thehill Well played, NAACP.
888091296132284416 2017-07-20 17:40:39 UTC <Suavebones> @Shakestweetz @stellalimelight You are. And you can't.
888089687159525376 2017-07-20 17:34:15 UTC <Suavebones> @chappie_cat @TeaPainUSA Absolutely no chance that Jr. will plead the 5th. Manafort, maybe.
888085139200155648 2017-07-20 17:16:11 UTC <Suavebones> @kjblackhawk @joncoopertweets I think the cause/effect is backwards. Isn't it likelier that Mueller has been subpoenaing these documents for months, and 45 was objecting?
888084297478832128 2017-07-20 17:12:50 UTC <Suavebones> @crooksandliars @AdamsFlaFan So incoherent that it is frightening - and I already thought I was maximally frightened ...
888083071592837120 2017-07-20 17:07:58 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem He squandered it.
887934571915878401 2017-07-20 07:17:53 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent Isn't this what Google has been doing for nearly two decades? As news, this is a tad mouldy.
887931289629630465 2017-07-20 07:04:51 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny @JoyAnnReid A cult. It's a cult.
887928885358116864 2017-07-19 06:55:17 UTC <Suavebones> @count_01 I may or may not remember those days, she said, wistfully.
887927820390875136 2017-07-19 06:51:03 UTC <Suavebones> @count_01 I ... I ... I ...
887926791221821440 2017-07-19 06:46:58 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA How could the Steele dossier be Comey's "leverage" against 45 when MSM *already had, and was about to publish, it*???
887924652823134208 2017-07-19 06:38:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Sickening conduct. Hope he serves time.
887924043147468801 2017-07-19 06:36:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Stonekettle Still, it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy ...
887921763417337857 2017-07-19 06:26:59 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Because nobody ever needs an emergency abortion to save the mother's life?
887921407983706112 2017-07-19 06:25:35 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 Choice B - they did it deliberately.
887920244202668032 2017-07-19 06:20:57 UTC <Suavebones> We deserve judges that respect and protect ALL Arizonans. @JeffFlake, oppose Bush's confirmation. #NoHateInCourthttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/cwg03/4jy4l
887787502802616321 2017-07-19 21:33:29 UTC <Suavebones> @vickscan @NateSilver538 What? WHAT??!
887786885111717888 2017-07-19 21:31:02 UTC <Suavebones> @girlsreallyrule AZ has more registered Dems than Reps. The Dems just don't vote.
887786645424005120 2017-07-19 21:30:05 UTC <Suavebones> @housebudgetGOP @RepJasonLewis The mere use of the term "entitlements" tells me everything I need to know about how you plan to nuke and strafe benefits for the elderly.
887784493725044737 2017-07-19 21:21:32 UTC <Suavebones> @pussyrrriot From Arizona - this is horrible. So sorry for your countrymen.
887783380485513217 2017-07-19 21:17:06 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog Yes it is sad. Families - they are ALL crazy. I thought my own was sane until my elderly mother went downhill. BOOM! Family blew apart. 
887778581459353601 2017-07-19 20:58:02 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog So sorry for your struggle. Hard enough to have ailing relatives without being falsely accused of stuff.
887776055154450432 2017-07-19 20:48:00 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog Actually, I think hospice encouraged my mother to do exactly that for my dying father.
887774986143907840 2017-07-19 20:43:45 UTC <Suavebones> @DeityFree @pourmecoffee This freaking nightmare is unconstitutional theft of property.
887771954714820609 2017-07-19 20:31:42 UTC <Suavebones> We deserve judges that respect and protect ALL Arizonans. @JeffFlake, vote NO on Bush & Schiff #NoHateInCourthttps://cards.twitter.com/cards/cwg03/4jy4p

887716423748812802 2017-07-19 16:51:03 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSanders @SwanWhisperr This colossal jerk ...
887639530886406144 2017-07-19 11:45:30 UTC <Suavebones> Lindy West in today's NYT:  "[I]nequality isn't a bug; it's a feature."
887552806978076672 2017-07-18 06:00:53 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid White woman here. Always support female candidates as long as they're Dem. and not DINO like my currect Rep.
887473560347828225 2017-07-18 00:45:59 UTC <Suavebones> @IsaLeeWolf @sarahkendzior @ohgodscrewthis Best laugh of the day ... !
887453438665080833 2017-07-18 23:26:02 UTC <Suavebones> @armandodkos How stomach-evacuating.
887452569592672257 2017-07-18 23:22:35 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 It is unthinkable - every single time - that he uses a fourth grader's terrible logic for losing and seems to think that's covered his ass.
887374357512675328 2017-07-18 18:11:48 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 High-minded political discourse - what this administration is all about.
887292607377821700 2017-07-18 12:46:57 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh Out of prison. Already.
887286938213863424 2017-07-18 12:24:25 UTC <Suavebones> @ReaderAdrift IRC frowns on that sort of "transaction."

887111157441470464 2017-07-17 00:45:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Delta @AnnCoulter And you *really* think you are this important to Delta or anyone else? Smh

887106576128987136 2017-07-17 00:27:44 UTC <Suavebones> @GiddyHeyde It's not PTSD - it's OTSD (ongoing).
887052407246540800 2017-07-17 20:52:29 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Not dumb - just determined to ignore the truth.
887000231430152193 2017-07-17 17:25:09 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @kjblackhawk @john_n_holly A large number live in Prescott, AZ.
886997932594954240 2017-07-17 17:16:01 UTC <Suavebones> @TrumpPrisonDate @TrueFactsStated @MelissaJPeltier @lauferlaw This is also untrue. Prosecutors and their teams investigate. I know. I have worked with them directly.
886997675710730240 2017-07-17 17:15:00 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @TrumpPrisonDate @lauferlaw I simply don't believe this. There are literally thousands of financial paper trails to be pursued, and not yet enough time to do that.
886996605299179520 2017-07-17 17:10:44 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias @HoarseWisperer I gave up on Matt months ago. His anti-HRC stance just annoys me beyond bearing.
886935855939465217 2017-07-17 13:09:21 UTC <Suavebones> @jilevin Seems to me the larger existential threat these days is the lack of any form of intelligence in the uppermost stratum of government.
886934371441168384 2017-07-17 13:03:27 UTC <Suavebones> @jpodhoretz @fawfulfan I am so old that I recall when Podhoretz was a leading liberal light. He veered sharp right and never recovered.
886775764170948608 2017-07-16 02:33:12 UTC <Suavebones> @MVandelay @PaulRieckhoff Did it!

886774787317432320 2017-07-16 02:29:19 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @Crystal1Johnson Congrats to all of you - that took a ton of hard work!
886742031376109570 2017-07-16 00:19:09 UTC <Suavebones> @yashar Some of us never have ...
886741511567679488 2017-07-16 00:17:05 UTC <Suavebones> @CatchaRUSSpy @ladyvictoria8 No. He made everything public. He had nothing to give Russia. Russia granted asylum to piss off the US, not bec. it got something 4 doing so
886741217559560193 2017-07-16 00:15:55 UTC <Suavebones> @CatchaRUSSpy @ladyvictoria8 Ed Snowden was in HK with pursuers hot on his tail. He wanted to get to Quito, but no direct flights. Only nonstop - Moscow.
886740889804062720 2017-07-16 00:14:37 UTC <Suavebones> @CatchaRUSSpy Harboring Ed Snowden is one of the *good* things they do.
886739715763822592 2017-07-16 00:09:57 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem  for sticking with it!
886726927569928192 2017-07-16 23:19:08 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem Hey, that's still a good walking pace!!
886725142692249602 2017-07-16 23:12:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Delta @AnnCoulter You are impugning the woman who got your seat? What are you, four years old?
886723101974708224 2017-07-16 23:03:56 UTC <Suavebones> @ccneat4 Yes to the first, no to the second.

886707021969465344 2017-07-16 22:00:02 UTC <Suavebones> @SpeakerRyan @funder Is there NOBODY who will save us?
886706676354629636 2017-07-16 21:58:40 UTC <Suavebones> You might want to rethink the "plunge my ass" comment ...
886706469688590336 2017-07-16 21:57:51 UTC <Suavebones> @JaySekulow @riotwomennn Every day, some tweet like this is standing between me and utter despair. Thanks, Secret Service!

886645132438548480 2017-07-16 17:54:07 UTC <Suavebones> @chargrille @mikefarb1 And didn't the *seven hour line* at my AZ polling place illustrate it.
886643125677989888 2017-07-16 17:46:08 UTC <Suavebones> @HiMaui @jennycohn1 Um, little causation problem here ...
886631413256044544 2017-07-16 16:59:36 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum Let's consider something: isn't it possible that a large portion of 45's base is just bone stupid or actually evil?
886620027671019520 2017-07-16 16:14:21 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Are you *seriously* spending your days mocking people's looks (the way they keep mocking yours)? Stop. Just stop.
886566672789782528 2017-07-16 12:42:21 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Of course, this is also the primary argument against gov't-by-purple-lizard-religious-belief.

886468067156385792 2017-07-15 06:10:31 UTC <Suavebones> @Independent WaPo had a great analysis today of exactly how high champion throwers can throw. Turns out they can't loft 33 pounds more than ~ 26 feet.
886455190143893504 2017-07-15 05:19:21 UTC <Suavebones> @DustinGiebel Former airline att'y here: There are about ninety-seven reasons why an airline can legitimately give one's seat to someone else.

886437958181462017 2017-07-15 04:10:53 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic How convenient.

886414950880628736 2017-07-15 02:39:27 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 @Krisellyn I almost moved to NC believing the same, but instead moved to AZ knowing better.
886414700795150336 2017-07-15 02:38:28 UTC <Suavebones> @KeepMyPowerOrg I don't know whether to die laughing or crying.
886414157817327616 2017-07-15 02:36:18 UTC <Suavebones> @Delta @AnnCoulter @dismayeddem Agreed on both counts. Posting a photo of a person who did not cause any of this was just the sort of scummy, entitled thing Ann does.
886366348586000385 2017-07-15 23:26:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Delta @AnnCoulter Who besides you actually gives a damn where you sit on the plane? Such a drama queen.
886338919259791361 2017-07-15 21:37:20 UTC <Suavebones> @Or4Now It makes my entire being ache with despair. My solution - outlaw police unions that actively protect police from consequences of actions.
886338049809960960 2017-07-15 21:33:53 UTC <Suavebones> @tmbrown327 Reportedly, failing to report debt is not a crime, though I fail to understand that idea.
886294538930634752 2017-07-15 18:40:59 UTC <Suavebones> @JesusChitChat @AdamsFlaFan What a disgusting man.
886293520205533184 2017-07-15 18:36:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Spicerlies Let's see how well that works out for him.
886292678781960193 2017-07-15 18:33:35 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump Unlike me. I hate Trump voters and detest those who support him.
886291493694038016 2017-07-15 18:28:53 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 @KPMcClave Do tell. Which "weakness," exactly, do we manifest?
886290989505069056 2017-07-15 18:26:53 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Pence = LIAR!!
886290792238596096 2017-07-15 18:26:06 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Forty-five years ago, Iranian women did *not* wear the hijab. However "free" women may feel with it now, it only arrived by oppression.
886267688531533824 2017-07-15 16:54:17 UTC <Suavebones> I actually *remember* this column. Plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose.https://twitter.com/yottapoint/status/886257746173022209
886263763686400000 2017-07-15 16:38:41 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh Ah. Apologies. Inchoate rage makes me a tad quick off the mark these days.
886260763320393729 2017-07-15 16:26:46 UTC <Suavebones> @jonfavs Why doesn't Congress just round us up and shoot us? Much more efficient.
886260111278096384 2017-07-15 16:24:11 UTC <Suavebones> @HistoryJosh No, women always hated this crap. You're only just noticing.

886212308455768064 2017-07-15 13:14:14 UTC <Suavebones> @funder @carlottaclarice It is now. It was the third amendment to Kushner's SF-86.

886195682230517760 2017-07-15 12:08:10 UTC <Suavebones> @NexusMediaNews @SafetyPinDaily Of course. Because renewables are an existential threat to fossil fuel purveyors.
886194798767427585 2017-07-15 12:04:39 UTC <Suavebones> @DennisPrager No, son. You and your fellow travelers are the true threat.
886193652925480960 2017-07-15 12:00:06 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Oh, and - she didn't do it.
886058792298856448 2017-07-14 03:04:12 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @impeach_d_trump Good luck with that. The man was appointed to the position and has conducted himself with maximum propriety.

886040995606872064 2017-07-14 01:53:29 UTC <Suavebones> @MrsHobbittoes Tragically, there is no political will in the GOP-controlled Congress to do so. It would require a 2/3s vote. Never gonna happen.
886040418567114753 2017-07-14 01:51:12 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane The President cannot pardon *state crimes.* Eric Schneiderman, AG of NYS, can cheerfully prosecute state RICO, false statements, etc. crimes

886026808780398593 2017-07-14 00:57:07 UTC <Suavebones> @impeach_d_trump It's early days. Something far worse than the crass Trump may wiggle out of this foetid mire.

886015578665697282 2017-07-14 00:12:29 UTC <Suavebones> Compromise is fine, but in that case, the Bros need to climb down a few rings.

885965244866023425 2017-07-14 20:52:29 UTC <Suavebones> @WeeeeeSquirrel @thehill About time. She is an honest lawyer of excellent reputation who was going to be nothing but slimed by Kushner et al. Wise decision by her.
885964824890400769 2017-07-14 20:50:49 UTC <Suavebones> @mattblaze I think that's the appropriate reaction.
885963912423759872 2017-07-14 20:47:11 UTC <Suavebones> @Shareblue @owillis Yeah, "Fox News" and "tongue-tied" are not natural companions.
885961863418101761 2017-07-14 20:39:03 UTC <Suavebones> @TimAeppel Waitressing in HS and college, I saw a colleague accept a "$3 bill," and a customer who wanted change for a "$10K bill." Idiots abound.
885960954684375040 2017-07-14 20:35:26 UTC <Suavebones> @Tracydwyer7 @robreiner Rob, you know how long it can take to develop and make a movie? Developing prosecutions, sadly, can take even longer. Have patience.
885958257482752000 2017-07-14 20:24:43 UTC <Suavebones> Jamie Gorelick, a principled DC attorney of high reputation, just quit Jared Kushner's legal team. Good call - he was sliming her.
885872207544688640 2017-07-14 14:42:47 UTC <Suavebones> @blakehounshell Oh, please - he has amended it THREE TIMES, and those forms are signed and submitted in *hard copy.* Pathetic lie.

885742062942928896 2017-07-13 06:05:38 UTC <Suavebones> @katelynjoyy @hotandhumid And then a sticker to look at the note and a wristband to interpret the sticker. And then my alarm click doesn't go off ...

885653305665376256 2017-07-13 00:12:57 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @MRKokoski Simple to get them acquitted? Um, Kushner, at least, is flat-out culpable for leaving 100+ foreign contacts off his SF-86, many repeatedly.
885631204891938817 2017-07-13 22:45:08 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic It looked silly then. An $83 million taxpayer-funded imvestigation to catch the President lying about a blow job. It was SO trivial.

885363587023163392 2017-07-12 05:01:43 UTC <Suavebones> @HannitysHead It was a phrase popularized by Justice Gorsuch's mother, Anne Burford, in 1984, referring to a panel she was appointed to. Yes, childish.
885329033935732736 2017-07-12 02:44:24 UTC <Suavebones> @USMCDD1 I have a massive amount of information about living outside the US. Feel free to DM me. Not a business - just a helpful #Resistance member.
885327937825759232 2017-07-12 02:40:03 UTC <Suavebones> @USMCDD1 Seriously, with no snark, I would rather have Trump, who is so hapless that he will get little done. Pence is organized and determined.
885327312077574144 2017-07-12 02:37:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Shareblue @docrocktex26 Makes you wonder, doesn't it, just how many Congresspersons have been consorting with the enemy?
885327070695366656 2017-07-12 02:36:36 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou It's simple. F+ck Bernie Sanders.
885255563885412357 2017-07-12 21:52:28 UTC <Suavebones> @WeeeeeSquirrel @SethAbramson That really isn't what the article said. Clickbait headline by you, Seth.

885198558256701440 2017-07-12 18:05:57 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat Um, hello? PREGNANT zebra ...
885195582943371265 2017-07-12 17:54:07 UTC <Suavebones> @Marmel THAT didn't go down well with me. The words were fine, but that image! The suggestion that Graham is gay and too wispy to fight is awful.
885194866187132929 2017-07-12 17:51:16 UTC <Suavebones> You really have zero idea how the law works, do you?

885193015421157376 2017-07-12 17:43:55 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Agreed. So change the Constitution, which is where that prescription appears.
885190972795006976 2017-07-12 17:35:48 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny Dementia strikes many people under 70, yet lots of people are still ticking strongly in their 8th-10th decades.Evaluate candidate, not age.
885189138047160320 2017-07-12 17:28:31 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Joan, with great respect, please don't go any farther down the rabbit hole of responding to these jerks. There is no point.
885176730452762628 2017-07-12 16:39:12 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny All young people believe this.
885138876158705664 2017-07-12 14:08:47 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @SethAbramson A perfect "Grandma, the cat's on the roof" explanation of burying the lede.
885137302476865536 2017-07-12 14:02:32 UTC <Suavebones> @SheilaBrady16 @tribelaw @SwanWhisperr That would be fun!
885137036071415809 2017-07-12 14:01:29 UTC <Suavebones> @JenKirkman Or Tupperware
884960043602329601 2017-07-11 02:18:10 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @RJSzczerba @AureliaGroup Please don't get your hopes up. Nobody will prosecute Jr. based on the facts we know today. Flynn, yes. Kushner, probably. Any Trumps - no.
884957457432195074 2017-07-11 02:07:54 UTC <Suavebones> @ManMet80 @jkalderash Aw, c'mon. You can haul out the big gun condemnations. ;)
884957156339884032 2017-07-11 02:06:42 UTC <Suavebones> @GayJessegirl @3L3V3NTH @GiddyHeyde Isn't it wonderful??
884957024609419264 2017-07-11 02:06:11 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnDingell I love you, @JohnDDingell - you have a gigantic pile of rubber bands, and shoot them off to zing the GOP, one at a time. Sweet life!
884956250592600065 2017-07-11 02:03:06 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @StephanieMoaz Agreed. But props to you for recognizing it. Not sure I could say the same for myself ...
884955484289089536 2017-07-11 02:00:03 UTC <Suavebones> @preferscleanH2O @DylanByers Seriously, what was there to say? Hey, dude, you kinda confessed to a crime? Yeah, I did.
884954554449580032 2017-07-11 01:56:22 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @StephanieMoaz Thank you for keeping an open mind. So few do.
884952318193487873 2017-07-11 01:47:28 UTC <Suavebones> This is a super-important timeline:https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/884905826653274113
884951130278461440 2017-07-11 01:42:45 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSchumer @ChuckShcumer @lauriedenn23 I paid $673/mo. single plan with $6600 deductible until all the ins. cos pulled out of my marketplace. Then the charge became $2000/mo.
884945190171033600 2017-07-11 01:19:09 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Herbitudinous! You amuse daily.
884918585981779968 2017-07-11 23:33:26 UTC <Suavebones> @riotwomennn Greenwald makes me want to punch his photo.
884871306306506752 2017-07-11 20:25:34 UTC <Suavebones> @KellyannePolls Sorry, toots. Dems learned the hard way from the GOP last administration that obstruction works. Now it's our turn. Suck it up, GOP.
884861604474404864 2017-07-11 19:47:01 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Liar. Liar. Liar, @seanhannity
884860511296176128 2017-07-11 19:42:40 UTC <Suavebones> @KagroX Sputtering incoherently ...
884859631729754113 2017-07-11 19:39:10 UTC <Suavebones> @gabriellahope_ It is *not* treason, but probably *is* several other flavors of criminal act.
884859005071376384 2017-07-11 19:36:41 UTC <Suavebones> @BillOReilly Jr. released emails ahead of NYT story. They incriminate him. Stop being willfully ignorant.
884858264353099776 2017-07-11 19:33:44 UTC <Suavebones> @ScottMcGrew For a reporter, you are embarrassingly ignorant. Mueller could never have hired Preet, whose firing is part of the stuff being investg'd.
884831989655666688 2017-07-11 17:49:20 UTC <Suavebones> @DonaldJTrumpJr @nytimes @cliffordlevy @BasedBrooklynNY 1) this article says nothing about HRC taking "millions" from the Russian gov't, 2) HRC was a private citizen in timeframe being reported
884812903622168577 2017-07-11 16:33:29 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM The NYT has confirmed that it already had the emails and a story ready to go. Credit? Hah.
884762258504433664 2017-07-11 13:12:15 UTC <Suavebones> @LiberalResist "Thinking" was never popular with the GOP.
884755234345570304 2017-07-11 12:44:20 UTC <Suavebones> @womensmarch Um, that's 17.5 miles ...
884754132334067714 2017-07-11 12:39:57 UTC <Suavebones> @rosenbergerlm But it would be SO sweet ...
884752827280523265 2017-07-11 12:34:46 UTC <Suavebones> @MSNBC @SRuhle @mememoreme @toilettweetage Ask him which Russians *he* talked with during the campaign.
884751871109324801 2017-07-11 12:30:58 UTC <Suavebones> @freespeechmarch @astroehlein What? WHAT??
884750041272930304 2017-07-11 12:23:42 UTC <Suavebones> @adamndsmith You're young. It was commonly heard in my youth in NE America.
884742888499814400 2017-07-11 11:55:17 UTC <Suavebones> @C_Stroop @roywlewis You had me at "deli-sliced" ...
884682335353884672 2017-07-11 07:54:40 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @MollyJongFast Cheered nme right up.

884666647633580032 2017-07-10 06:52:19 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @Funk_USMC Irrelevant on treason. The charge will never, never be brought.
884665732675411968 2017-07-10 06:48:41 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @covfefemalt45 @jonrosenberg Nope. Nixon.

884604432985464832 2017-07-10 02:45:06 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 DDBB - a phrase that still makes me ridiculously happy ...
884603801231015936 2017-07-10 02:42:36 UTC <Suavebones> @sadydoyle Well, now, hold on a second - Ivanka was photographed sitting on his knee numerous times. And he knows Barron is "good with the cyber" ...
884600930330476544 2017-07-10 02:31:11 UTC <Suavebones> @ellen_aleshire Do you know/recall that it was Justice Gorsuch's mother who popularized the term in the early 1980's? She said it about a panel she sat on.
884600504038203392 2017-07-10 02:29:29 UTC <Suavebones> @naretevduorp Oh, you just tapped my brain's happy circuit!
884565475094482944 2017-07-10 00:10:18 UTC <Suavebones> @bobcesca_go Justice Neil Gorsuch's mother, Anne Gorsuch, was deposed as EPA Chief and infamously called her next position a "nothingburger." Circa 1984.
884560616614092800 2017-07-10 23:50:59 UTC <Suavebones> @NicolleDWallace @SDRZag Disgusting, yet hilarious!
884548832440102913 2017-07-10 23:04:10 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @brianklaas He will say absolutely anything. No filter and no brain.
884545901800284163 2017-07-10 22:52:31 UTC <Suavebones> @rswfire Your thread was heartbreaking. I am so glad you survived to tell your story, and it *will* help others. Thank you.
884544589218037761 2017-07-10 22:47:18 UTC <Suavebones> @rswfire @amy_nc74 Please tell him he has a vast and wonderful future ahead of him, and that he is and will be loved. Hugs to you too.
884496473328500736 2017-07-10 19:36:07 UTC <Suavebones> @SarahHuckabee @hunterw Look at her genetics - doomed to fail at birth.
884495757763530752 2017-07-10 19:33:16 UTC <Suavebones> @hunterw @pendarvisjh I know you meant "collusion," but I think "collision" is almost a better fit!
884495036641034240 2017-07-10 19:30:24 UTC <Suavebones> @JenKirkman @thegoatsnanny1 @bjones02 @docrocktex26 @jglewis1983 You don't know what neoliberalism is, do you?
884494520938668032 2017-07-10 19:28:21 UTC <Suavebones> @naretevduorp Hahahaha!!
884494353728655360 2017-07-10 19:27:41 UTC <Suavebones> @milesjreed Hey, there's one of these Book's places here in PHX.
884493446873989120 2017-07-10 19:24:05 UTC <Suavebones> @Amy_Siskind @DebraMessing @kurteichenwald @JoyAnnReid @SenSanders @GeoffMiami Thanks for this thread. I follow all those meme folks, but now I know which "progressive" jerks to block. "Progressives" led us to 45.
884492560206516225 2017-07-10 19:20:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic I live blue in yeehaw - your suggestion is kind of mean to us, wouldn't you say? Forced relo.?
884483847831683075 2017-07-10 18:45:56 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @leahmcelrath @Shareblue Terrific!
884471093204877312 2017-07-10 17:55:15 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Yeah, y'know, someone should maybe investigate HRC to get the evidence of her crimes. Oh, wait ...
884468556527673344 2017-07-10 17:45:11 UTC <Suavebones> @sahilkapur I'd phrase that another way: Trump allies try to prop up 45's statements, and then Trump contradicts himself - and them.
884467684707926022 2017-07-10 17:41:43 UTC <Suavebones> @MMFlint Thanks, Michael Moore! You're a lot of the reason that life remains bearable these days.
884452589181386752 2017-07-10 16:41:44 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @RhutaBhayga Yeah, plus it's all BS anyway.
884451885545013248 2017-07-10 16:38:56 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost @EmmaEvaGarcia Rich. White.
884448374698549249 2017-07-10 16:24:59 UTC <Suavebones> @DonaldJTrumpJr Trumplet, you're violating the first rule of holes.
884219984951377920 2017-07-09 01:17:27 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @KaraCalavera Oh, THAT made me laugh! Well said!
884219781179559936 2017-07-09 01:16:38 UTC <Suavebones> @georgesoros @ananavarro @John_blaze80 Ignorant bot.
884218625594318848 2017-07-09 01:12:02 UTC <Suavebones> @MattMurph24 I blocked this asswipe. He is not worth the price of the pixels reflecting his so-called thoughts.
884159071208693761 2017-07-09 21:15:24 UTC <Suavebones> @Ireland0828 @adbridgeforth Nah, it has already been here for a long time. This is just further proof that it's not going anywhere.
884157403846950912 2017-07-09 21:08:46 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @Reince45 None of this happened, and everyone knows it.
884138009750261760 2017-07-09 19:51:42 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @TheLewisBlack @nemocyclops @rswfire Amy Siskind has captured them in her weekly summaries.
884136419081330688 2017-07-09 19:45:23 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan It nauseates me.
884134074067046400 2017-07-09 19:36:04 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamsFlaFan A "public servant family"?!? Is she delusional?
884132794678468608 2017-07-09 19:30:59 UTC <Suavebones> @TheFreedomFan Seriously? You know nothing. Nothing at all.
884129758975479808 2017-07-09 19:18:55 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 HAHAHA! Well said!
884129548329115648 2017-07-09 19:18:05 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Really? Not "asshole"?
884129377235095552 2017-07-09 19:17:24 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw Nope. I was sure Tillerson was lying when he said sanctions were discussed, and now Trump confirms that suspicion.
883945475157524483 2017-07-09 07:06:38 UTC <Suavebones> @wildteenager4u That is not even a human fetus. You really *are* deplorable, and no, that's not a compliment. Blocked.
883944033826951170 2017-07-09 07:00:55 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA @don_drcblc99 Well, see, they haven't been Communists since Gorbachev. They're thieving capitalists like the GOP.
883482573694881792 2017-07-07 00:27:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JuddLegum I am a serious person, too, and I believe it is too soon to know for sure that vote totals were *not* rigged. More investigation needed.
883480253422686208 2017-07-07 00:18:01 UTC <Suavebones> @mmpadellan Geegen has ALWAYS been a spokes-troll.
883479819702247424 2017-07-07 00:16:17 UTC <Suavebones> @hunterbaker @KGman08 They knowingly smuggled into the US artifacts that they knew or should have known were stolen Iraqi items. Tell me how this is not theft.
883479194302160896 2017-07-07 00:13:48 UTC <Suavebones> @hunterbaker Exactly. Finally someone nails it.
883476946927079425 2017-07-07 00:04:53 UTC <Suavebones> @neshoba77 @kurteichenwald She learns her lines from right wing sources - the Saul Alinsky, George Soros stuff. Why not "the 14 words" also?
883475214520078337 2017-07-07 23:57:59 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @naretevduorp You should not have respected David Gergen, a paid shill.
883474267324555264 2017-07-07 23:54:14 UTC <Suavebones> @BeverleeHughes3 @letat_lechat @NetflixMulhouse Nothing in the article references Merkel's reaction, but we all understand what precipitated it.
883471927054000128 2017-07-07 23:44:56 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA I hear foxes are working diligently with henhouses on security too.
883470962452185088 2017-07-07 23:41:06 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane 17 US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled, but 45 accepts Putin's "word"? What the actual f*ck?
883385854701428738 2017-07-07 18:02:54 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @KarylKrug As another retired attorney, I politely disagree. Look at Arthur Anderson (SCt 2005) and see if an ObstJust case agst 45 can stand.
883384882725924865 2017-07-07 17:59:03 UTC <Suavebones> @GraceColasurdo @SethAbramson @LiaSummers5 Because Seth is wrong. ObsJust charges are possible, but not remotely a slam dunk.
883384529053863936 2017-07-07 17:57:38 UTC <Suavebones> @Slate @CathySpence3 @SethAbramson @CherylJ1959 I am a retired lawyer and think Seth is smoking something. SCOTUS in 2005 made clear that ObsJust charges must *prove* a CORRUPT motive.
883383626972266496 2017-07-07 17:54:03 UTC <Suavebones> @zelduh @SethAbramson And you are an attorney who is ignoring the 20-year trend of Supreme Court cases finding reasons to dodge ObJust convictions.
883348544442187777 2017-07-07 15:34:39 UTC <Suavebones> @ava @KendraPayne_ @stinarichard @therealzanetta Delusional.
883346438486347777 2017-07-07 15:26:17 UTC <Suavebones> @jbouie @hannahgais @DavidAHoward Why would you be "proud" of being white?
883344087037890560 2017-07-07 15:16:56 UTC <Suavebones> @riotwomennn This woman just s insane.
883214943671132160 2017-07-06 06:43:46 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Two words: phenomenal stupidity.
883208069219459072 2017-07-06 06:16:27 UTC <Suavebones> @Im_TheAntiTrump @TeaPainUSA Sums it up quite neatly.
883205858632519680 2017-07-06 06:07:40 UTC <Suavebones> @thenation No business that rewards executive management for profits cares about customers. It's a baked-in fact.
883204665579413504 2017-07-06 06:02:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @dancindoti @funder Hell, no, I don't agree. If Twitter cuts off Trump, we will not hear his unvarnished voice. We need to hear it.
883089674545254400 2017-07-06 22:26:00 UTC <Suavebones> @Amy_Siskind Please, I'm begging you. Give it a rest.
883088783557541888 2017-07-06 22:22:27 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnCam05 Oh, my - your ignorance in the face of easily-located facts is either very sad or utterly detestable.  OK, maybe both.
883088075248640001 2017-07-06 22:19:38 UTC <Suavebones> @KellyannePolls @CRBsteve @RealDonalldJTru @ValerieNadalini Interesting - you know this how?? By ignoring the numerous women who came forward during the campaign?
883054300703764485 2017-07-06 20:05:26 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @4everNeverTrump Just disagree. No ody has an obligation to protect outrageous trolls on the web.
883047977190735872 2017-07-06 19:40:18 UTC <Suavebones> @pwberg77 @markmackinnon Nobody except the Senate, much of the House, seventeen intelligence agencies, all MSM, and tens of millions of Americans *and* Russians ...
883047322359287808 2017-07-06 19:37:42 UTC <Suavebones> @mmpadellan @dancindoti @eenkblot My head shake is so constant, I look like I've developed Parkinson's.
883046769218600960 2017-07-06 19:35:30 UTC <Suavebones> @deanofcomedy @Crazyginny Yeah, and it's *all the shoulders' fault*!
883046320163872768 2017-07-06 19:33:43 UTC <Suavebones> @Crazyginny @deanofcomedy Oh, those seductive shoulders ... (!)
883046022003294208 2017-07-06 19:32:32 UTC <Suavebones> I fell in love with the Notorious RBG in college in 1973 when I read her many articles supporting the Equal Rights Amendment.https://twitter.com/disavowtrump16/status/882624124862025728
883045653286330369 2017-07-06 19:31:04 UTC <Suavebones> @thenation Black girls may mature earlier physically. My friend (black), a teacher's aide, deals with 7 and 8 yr olds with breasts & periods.
883041497666338817 2017-07-06 19:14:33 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @OmanReagan Thanks for your role in assuring that we got Trump as President. {infer withering sarcasm font}
883040769480601600 2017-07-06 19:11:40 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCNews @RWPUSA Can anyone explain why this was not a *criminal* prosecution?
883040327543562240 2017-07-06 19:09:54 UTC <Suavebones> Exactly.
883039320801632256 2017-07-06 19:05:54 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @Amy_Siskind @Z3n1a Exactly.
883038420838236161 2017-07-06 19:02:20 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Could not disagree more, @Amy_Siskind - CNN did nothing wrong here, and in saying that they did, you are weirdly aligning w/ RWNJs.
882783355154055168 2017-07-05 02:08:47 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum @GIowing0rb Not I.
882781106382151680 2017-07-05 01:59:51 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum Which is why I post under my real name.
882780083181690880 2017-07-05 01:55:47 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid Says a lot for the morality of his supposed religious beliefs that he is willing to break the law to smuggle "thousands of artifacts."

882365089260609536 2017-07-04 22:26:45 UTC <Suavebones> @nikkihaley I worked in federal gov't many years, including every holiday on the calendar. I didn't make an ass of myself whining. Neither should you.
882364528586915840 2017-07-04 22:24:31 UTC <Suavebones> @LindaLawrey @USMC_DD Not out of touch at all - he hates and deliberately condescends to the poor and the working class.

882334713741836289 2017-07-04 20:26:03 UTC <Suavebones> @JoeNBC Yeah, maybe you could have given this a bit more thought before you cozied up to him and his campaign, and undercut Hillary. Reap/sow.
882326857118384128 2017-07-04 19:54:50 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnWDean Very simple answer: we do *not* have that capacity, reliably.

881670219189506049 2017-07-02 00:25:35 UTC <Suavebones> @abc15 No shooting is "accidental." Someone is responsible for mishandling a deadly weapon, and parents are responsible for leaving kids w/ gun.

881663508248539136 2017-07-02 23:58:55 UTC <Suavebones> @tmbrown327 This news is mixed nuts. She was a corporate type, not a compliance type, and likely hated the job from the start. Hating 45 too d/n=good.

881622037118070784 2017-07-02 21:14:08 UTC <Suavebones> @thinkprogress In other words, he is only objecting to the payment level, not the transaction.

881621195111579648 2017-07-02 21:10:47 UTC <Suavebones> @LindaLawrey @RhutaBhayga I did. Twitter did not care.

881613919990693888 2017-07-02 20:41:52 UTC <Suavebones> @PrincessBravato Fascinating, as the GOP economists usually take the position that trade deficits have *very little* to do with the national debt.

881590781785419780 2017-07-02 19:09:56 UTC <Suavebones> @thinkprogress The solution to this CTE crisis is simple - ban football. Nobody should play it or revel in others' injuring their brains. Barbaric.

881553713487163392 2017-07-02 16:42:38 UTC <Suavebones> @ava @iamkmcollins I did.
881552879001124864 2017-07-02 16:39:19 UTC <Suavebones> @ava @TLTESQ37 I'm white, and I agree with you. What 45 is doing terrifies me for all PoC.

881330589198045184 2017-07-01 01:56:01 UTC <Suavebones> @MalcolmNance @snelsonus Glad to have it, since it isn't gonna happen in my lifetime.

881261909722386432 2017-07-01 21:23:06 UTC <Suavebones> @ToniC8 @mattmanaz Of COURSE they don't want to "fix" O'care. That would mean demanding concessions from Big Insurance, some of their biggest donors.
881244675964719108 2017-07-01 20:14:38 UTC <Suavebones> @milesjreed Hilarious!
881244335353741312 2017-07-01 20:13:16 UTC <Suavebones> @GiddyHeyde @HarryShotton Ghastly.
881227999051251712 2017-07-01 19:08:22 UTC <Suavebones> @DegenRolf This is not news to women.
881218272200335360 2017-07-01 18:29:42 UTC <Suavebones> @MiltShook He is the Commander-in-Freakin'-Chief of the military ...

881213895725035524 2017-07-01 18:12:19 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane Great photo!
881213531286196228 2017-07-01 18:10:52 UTC <Suavebones> @DeityFree That's fine with me.
881211182803148800 2017-07-01 18:01:32 UTC <Suavebones> @DeityFree Most of those things are rejected by Christianity, too. If we start judging others by religion, the whole lot of 'em get rejected.
881209905205583873 2017-07-01 17:56:28 UTC <Suavebones> @DearAuntCrabby It would be so nice, but will never happen ... {sighing wistfully}
881209691002486785 2017-07-01 17:55:37 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid This is non-news. All senior WH folks always make top salary.
881207725551534080 2017-07-01 17:47:48 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @jaketapper @therrera888 @JoshuaGrubbsPhD Seriously? You compare Clinton's boisterous self-love to 45's toxic self-obsession without noting several orders of magnitude of difference?
881206761843171328 2017-07-01 17:43:58 UTC <Suavebones> @ToniC8 @PatrickW Have reached the point where I wish I were Canadian ...
881206162284101632 2017-07-01 17:41:35 UTC <Suavebones> @1stGrumpydude @BeautyBind I don't give a crap about Joe and Mika, both shameless panderers. But you have to admit, Kushner exercised an appalling abuse of power.
881203225294127104 2017-07-01 17:29:55 UTC <Suavebones> @Dave_Fox @kylegriffin1 Can anyone explain to me what this piece adds to what the WSJ already published? Just don't get it ... 
881197491344953344 2017-07-01 17:07:08 UTC <Suavebones> @GaylenKathleen @RyanAFournier Dems were not shown the bill, and nobody would discuss it with them. How can they *perfect* something they are denied access to?
881197019536150528 2017-07-01 17:05:15 UTC <Suavebones> @GaylenKathleen A majority of the states refused to provide *confidential* voter data, and you think they're *hiding* something? Wow, are you deluded.
881183131289530369 2017-07-01 16:10:04 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey He was never much.
880976174528077824 2017-06-30 02:27:42 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane This is so horrible ...
880973964176052224 2017-06-30 02:18:55 UTC <Suavebones> @benjaminwittes I'm already drinking twice as much as I used to. Doctor balked at the Xanax refill. Give it to me quick, or I may not make it ...
880973584755171328 2017-06-30 02:17:24 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 He knows ab-so-lute-ly nothing.
880960470101839876 2017-06-30 01:25:18 UTC <Suavebones> He has never been *out of* insane territory.
880959801689227264 2017-06-30 01:22:38 UTC <Suavebones> @POLITICOMag @politico @PeterDawsonUSA Oh, you wish.
880959499657396225 2017-06-30 01:21:26 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @thehill Absolutely - tweet away. We need to see your unhinged thinking.
880958955165319168 2017-06-30 01:19:16 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey @AlGiordano Oh dear lord, let's hope so. Glenn is getting *right* up my nose.
880957633493991424 2017-06-30 01:14:01 UTC <Suavebones> @rgcainmd @BraddJaffy Ohmigod, Mississippi has balls. I never knew!
880957191615692800 2017-06-30 01:12:16 UTC <Suavebones> @AlanDersh @tribelaw Serious question: how did you STAND Dersh as a colleague all those years? Props for surviving him.
880956065562542080 2017-06-30 01:07:48 UTC <Suavebones> @InvisibleMomma @RonCharles Are you white?
880955882095366144 2017-06-30 01:07:04 UTC <Suavebones> @TheDailyEdge And rank stupidity. You forgot that ...
880954912946794496 2017-06-30 01:03:13 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland @ClaraJeffery I admire your faith that this country will survive him and his ugly plans. But I do not share it.
880954344023015424 2017-06-30 01:00:57 UTC <Suavebones> @sarahkendzior Guys like Chuck kept chipping away at the trunk of Hillary's tree and then expressed amazement that it fell over.
880954016607354880 2017-06-30 00:59:39 UTC <Suavebones> @chucktodd Chuck, guys like you kept walking past the Hillary tree taking random whacks with your axes, and then claimed surprise when it fell over.
880949088778207232 2017-06-30 00:40:04 UTC <Suavebones> @lauferlaw @ellyn_gesell @LouiseMensch Importantly, Louise, I have *never* said it couldn't happen. I'm sure some indictments are coming. It's just premature. Get over yourself.
880899324669943808 2017-06-30 21:22:19 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang I don't think you understand how abortion works, then. It is *always* available to rich/connected folks.
880898387394023424 2017-06-30 21:18:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @lindakelley926 @funder @dismayeddem Exactly my thinking. 45's tweets are the sole unvarnished view we get of him. We need to keep seeing it.
880897881334456320 2017-06-30 21:16:35 UTC <Suavebones> @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @lindakelley926 @funder HELL no! Let him kerp tweeting. It's going to hang him in the end.
880886001522032640 2017-06-30 20:29:23 UTC <Suavebones> @MalcolmNance @tedlieu 18 USC Sec. 872 makes it a crime for government employees to extort or attempt to extort the public.
880884970180431872 2017-06-30 20:25:17 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @bjimd @SethN12 @docrocktex26 @_Doctor_Bill_ I vote Choice Two. By his own account, he has never been any different.
880882525186342913 2017-06-30 20:15:34 UTC <Suavebones> @daveweigel Or a right-wing SCOTUS, all of which was thoroughly predictable ...
880882194557804544 2017-06-30 20:14:15 UTC <Suavebones> @Politicon I'd rather climb down into an active volcano.
880879691208339456 2017-06-30 20:04:18 UTC <Suavebones> @fireheather @ProudResister 18 USC Sec. 872 - "extortion by government employees"
880866474058932224 2017-06-30 19:11:47 UTC <Suavebones> @BraddJaffy HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
880865612213362689 2017-06-30 19:08:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Morning_Joe @BraddJaffy Mika's story kinda cuts against Joe's. Mika and fam. want to stop harassm't by NI, but Joe claims outreach was from POTUS to him.
880862907151425536 2017-06-30 18:57:37 UTC <Suavebones> @paulkrugman And always has been.
880858782380605440 2017-06-30 18:41:13 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @thehill @jtacuff @Tracydwyer7 Seriously, how freakin' stupid do you have to be to put an extortion threat in writing?!
880855731028635648 2017-06-30 18:29:06 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang Couldn't agree more. Joe and Mika earned this.   But I still love it that Kushner extorted them *in writing.*
880855029812314112 2017-06-30 18:26:19 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @Arron008 @SgtTomorrow My polling place in PHX had a nine hour line, closing 12:35 am. I went home w/out voting at 9:30 pm after 3.5 hrs when election was called.
880852669002244096 2017-06-30 18:16:56 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @honestDonJTrump @TXhistorylover And you are among the many reasons we hate Texas.
880849690660679681 2017-06-30 18:05:06 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw @Saintsfan5348 Same, except I have no kids. I worry more about everybody, though.
880847940406751232 2017-06-30 17:58:09 UTC <Suavebones> @KFILE Oh? I don't see why everybody whom Trump attacks - witlessly, falsely - has to scramble around disproving Trump's statements.
880846878337753089 2017-06-30 17:53:55 UTC <Suavebones> @JoeNBC @tomtomorrow @pattyinNY @knatalie2 That 36% will never be convinced.
880615483971588096 2017-06-29 02:34:27 UTC <Suavebones> @earthdogelevena @williamlegate This is not a surprise.
880615233978486784 2017-06-29 02:33:27 UTC <Suavebones> @WSJ @B52Malmet @Amy_Siskind Only if Flynn was really involved. Smith is now dead, so there better be extrinsic evidence tying in Flynn.
880614911235076096 2017-06-29 02:32:10 UTC <Suavebones> @WSJ @Amy_Siskind POSSIBLE collusion - let's not get ahead of ourselves.
880612931754311681 2017-06-29 02:24:18 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Hawaii already sued today over the new and restrictive definition of "close family."
880612548755599361 2017-06-29 02:22:47 UTC <Suavebones> @amelie811 And Pol Pot. And pretty much every dictator ever ...
880612342655995904 2017-06-29 02:21:58 UTC <Suavebones> @politico By "attacked," SHS means "called out on his brazen falsehoods."
880595668103868416 2017-06-29 01:15:42 UTC <Suavebones> @vickscan @Stonekettle He has always been mentally ill. How come you're only just noticing?
880592730220515328 2017-06-29 01:04:02 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @GeneAdrift @riotwomennn Senate healthcare bill is poop, just like the President and every GOP legislator who votes for it and every citizen who voted them in.
880590575933595649 2017-06-29 00:55:28 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @GeneAdrift @riotwomennn Um, Trump *is* the President who sign the eventual healthcare hill. I think that's a pretty close relationship.
880589872699801600 2017-06-29 00:52:40 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Hard not to equate "fundamentalism" with "staggering stupidity."
880586270476390400 2017-06-29 00:38:22 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @SwanWhisperr Same here. Cannot understand animus towards immigrants when they work as landscapers here all summer in the 115+ heat - hardest workers ever
880582013375225856 2017-06-29 00:21:27 UTC <Suavebones> @AngrierWHStaff And it will be fun to watch.
880581681391910912 2017-06-29 00:20:07 UTC <Suavebones> @FoxNews @Amy_Siskind Krauthammer shares the blame for where we are.  Love these conservs who pee on the plate and then say, ohh, something nasty here.
880580899116466176 2017-06-29 00:17:01 UTC <Suavebones> @RaisesQuestions @kurteichenwald So very, very wrong.
880580776177221632 2017-06-29 00:16:32 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald You were a jerk to condemn him. Fox tells lies, constantly. How is it that we cannot condemn *them* for it?
880579406795649024 2017-06-29 00:11:05 UTC <Suavebones> @JamieOGrady @DannyZuker @MikeSzymanski6 Speaking as a huge, flabby person myself, I would rather we focus on the other 467 billion reasons 45 is awful. Weight is not a moral issue.
880578192053948417 2017-06-29 00:06:15 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 I'm still laughing ... ! Bang on the nose!
880576861415161856 2017-06-29 00:00:58 UTC <Suavebones> @artemis1954 @ajplus This wasn't a "lack of judgment" by the cop. It was a full-on, deliberate racist attack that he thought he could justify.
880575766580183040 2017-06-29 23:56:37 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost That's not saying much - they're both so tiny and inconsequential
880574935898267648 2017-06-29 23:53:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Evan_McMullin Or it *would* be refreshing if Krauthammer hadn't been egging on all the policies that led us to this Congress and 45. Actions/consequences.
880574433156452353 2017-06-29 23:51:19 UTC <Suavebones> @CroxfordRc @lauferlaw @hardhouz13 We're a long way from a RICO charge ... don't get your hopes up too high.
880573861112066048 2017-06-29 23:49:03 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @DaShanneStokes Oh, I think they envisioned it clearly. What they did not anticipate was a majority in Congress so craven that it would not drive him out.
880573477702389760 2017-06-29 23:47:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Ireland0828 @JoyAnnReid Joy, I hear there's a slot open at MSNBC ...
880573357795590144 2017-06-29 23:47:03 UTC <Suavebones> @lauferlaw @hardhouz13 RICO would be a fantastic prosecution. But, um, aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?
880571505888731137 2017-06-29 23:39:41 UTC <Suavebones> @3DTruth I shouted with laughter ...
880571281329881088 2017-06-29 23:38:48 UTC <Suavebones> @LindaLawrey @thehill That boy ain't right ...
880571146667675649 2017-06-29 23:38:16 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @JoyAnnReid Matt Lewis is either lying or feeble-minded. There are no other options.
880571020507136000 2017-06-29 23:37:46 UTC <Suavebones> @mattklewis You are either lying or feeble-minded.
880570239049621504 2017-06-29 23:34:39 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamParkhomenko But crummy weather, she says, having lived there for 30 years ...
880569651096240128 2017-06-29 23:32:19 UTC <Suavebones> @guardian Brits always were the coolest kids ...
880569280764403713 2017-06-29 23:30:51 UTC <Suavebones> @LouiseMensch @lauferlaw @ellyn_gesell Perhaps you should wait to see if a RICO indictment *actually emerges* before helping Louise take a victory lap?
880568533775597568 2017-06-29 23:27:53 UTC <Suavebones> @noelcourage Well, yeah ... don't *you* have a money tree in your yard?? They deliver them to the door when you turn 65. Maybe you're not there yet. 
880567632520331264 2017-06-29 23:24:18 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @SwanWhisperr No worries - AC is on 24/7 for about seven months a year!

880566872210407424 2017-06-29 23:21:17 UTC <Suavebones> @NerdyLaura What is wrong with her brain?!
880555575582404608 2017-06-29 22:36:23 UTC <Suavebones> Absolutely appalling.
880555314054955009 2017-06-29 22:35:21 UTC <Suavebones> @nicasaurus Dignity? Does she know what that word means?
880553449598763008 2017-06-29 22:27:56 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem @JoyAnnReid I did. Seven months ago.
880553284024410112 2017-06-29 22:27:17 UTC <Suavebones> @MSNBC @puppymnkey Whereas I hope Greta winds up face down in an oily gutter. She deserves no better after her Fox-spew of so many years.
880552885066506240 2017-06-29 22:25:42 UTC <Suavebones> @DLoesch This is sickness made manifest. You are a dreadful person for doing this ad, and for - if you do - believing these things. Guns are vile.
880552439480336385 2017-06-29 22:23:56 UTC <Suavebones> @UsVsThemBlog @t_pletch @LouiseMensch Ah, crap, I liked all of you, and now the family is fighting.
880551789992460288 2017-06-29 22:21:21 UTC <Suavebones> @AngrierWHStaff Lupus is a wicked disease and I am so sorry that you must struggle against it. But please don't make us take Robin v. Louise sides.
880551344729341953 2017-06-29 22:19:35 UTC <Suavebones> @UsVsThemBlog @t_pletch @LouiseMensch Stop. Just stop pursuing Robin.
880550558255333376 2017-06-29 22:16:27 UTC <Suavebones> @morningmika @brianstelter @meredith_bohen Not missing the point - amplifying the point.
880550214062358529 2017-06-29 22:15:05 UTC <Suavebones> @morningmika @brianstelter Ohmigod, the blood! THE BLOOD!!!
880549769298321408 2017-06-29 22:13:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @Bigguymm She was never worth your admiration, being a chief architect of the Iraq war and all ...
880549420885917696 2017-06-29 22:11:56 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic @BetsyGervasi @Lulugirl2016 Nothing whatsoever happened to Rice. She has a cushy billet at Stanford instead of rotting in prison for her Iraq War lies.
880548785578954754 2017-06-29 22:09:24 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic Does he? Does he really? Values like grabbing pussy, polluting the earth, savaging public education, removing health care from millions ...?
880548320799727616 2017-06-29 22:07:34 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Gee, I was feeling sorry for myself in Phoenix at a mere 119 ...
880548030113488898 2017-06-29 22:06:24 UTC <Suavebones> @JoeNBC @morningmika @MaxineWaters @JESUSEARTHRETUR Mika is responsible for her own marital issues.
880547678710448128 2017-06-29 22:05:01 UTC <Suavebones> @MaxineWaters Rep. Waters, you are insulting swamp creatures by that comparison. 
880527181880766464 2017-06-29 20:43:34 UTC <Suavebones> @AARPadvocates @JesseLehrich Hideous. Just hideous cruelty.
880527036749565952 2017-06-29 20:42:59 UTC <Suavebones> @ferreescotta @Oktimpi Poor Ken failed to understand the not-very-subtle tweet.
880249279440338944 2017-06-28 02:19:17 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Best thoughts for Lily.
880248668351119360 2017-06-28 02:16:51 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw It's pretty obvious: the Senate is now investigating the FBI's investigation.
880140256544272386 2017-06-28 19:06:04 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu Oh, sugar pie - if you're so stupid that you cannot understand the uranium issue, nobody's gonna waste time explaining it to you.
880139762765512704 2017-06-28 19:04:06 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu @KGrwolff There's hacking the election, and then there is actively conspiring with a foreign country to affect the election. Investigating the latter.
880139358765850624 2017-06-28 19:02:29 UTC <Suavebones> @PopularPres2016 @tedlieu @EFlowerCC Trust in Bob Mueller. He is a titan among investigators and the cleverest lawyer out in the wild. He will get us there.
880138707684044800 2017-06-28 18:59:54 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu @harrisonmj86 Alternative pleading.
880138533205295104 2017-06-28 18:59:13 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu @bobhaydensson I KNOW - the press (oops, MSM) just *can't* let it go ... [withering sarcasm]
880138125464317953 2017-06-28 18:57:35 UTC <Suavebones> @Leta_says @tedlieu @SansMerci86 You really don't understand how the Senate works, do you?
880136192020299776 2017-06-28 18:49:54 UTC <Suavebones> Thank you, @Evan_McMullin , for stating it directly. POTUS is now straight-up threatening the media.
880135909408088064 2017-06-28 18:48:47 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey If someone charges her with a crime (cyber-stalking; criminal threats), then she might become an immigrant w/ a crim. record - deportable!
880133435821400064 2017-06-28 18:38:57 UTC <Suavebones> Safe travels to her, and condolences to you.
880132111348285440 2017-06-28 18:33:42 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald Congratulations!
880130932082069504 2017-06-28 18:29:00 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey I spent decades as a real lawyer. Louise is, to put it mildly, so far off track that she can't see the train smoke any more.
880130276243914752 2017-06-28 18:26:24 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost @amazon @realDonaldTrump @UsVsThemBlog @Feebeekiwi Sounds a LOT like extortion.
880129546250461184 2017-06-28 18:23:30 UTC <Suavebones> @JeffBezos @realDonaldTrump @morten @FishPhillet @RcAnderson48, you're kidding, right? This was an in-your-face threat by POTUS to tax Amazon if the Post continues to criticize 45.
880129130234208256 2017-06-28 18:21:51 UTC <Suavebones> @JeffBezos @realDonaldTrump @morten Yes. That is exactly what 45 is doing. It's delegitimization and suppression of the press, pure and simple.
879850274356994048 2017-06-27 23:53:46 UTC <Suavebones> @capitalflowking @Eviljohna @eclecticbrotha Both AZ and NV expanded Medicaid after the ACA was passed.
879849819954528256 2017-06-27 23:51:58 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha @Suavebones @Eviljohna @capitalflowking
879840503197425664 2017-06-27 23:14:57 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump CNN immediately ID'd the fake news, removed it from the web, and fired the staffers responsible. Unlike you, POTUS - you just keep lying.
879811899814100992 2017-06-27 21:21:17 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Crooks hired to represent crooks ...
879809190281138176 2017-06-27 21:10:31 UTC <Suavebones> @hive_us I can do that now *for free* with both my Westinghouse and Nest thermostats. Unnecessary service.
879808451961958400 2017-06-27 21:07:35 UTC <Suavebones> @ZeldaLackner @kylegriffin1 GOP-led states sued to be able to avoid Medicare expansion under ACA and *won,* leaving millions uninsured that the ACA was built to cover.
879796607855738880 2017-06-27 20:20:31 UTC <Suavebones> @eclecticbrotha @capitalflowking @Eviljohna AZ approved expansion, but current governor salivating to roll it back. So sorry for your woes - please go to PP quickly. You need to know.
879795224209375232 2017-06-27 20:15:01 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 @LeelaOfNewYork You are making a central point - never apologize for that! 
879794886244843520 2017-06-27 20:13:41 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 @dannybaptista The key response to "let Trump get elected and burn the place down," was: "Thirty-plus years of right-wing SCOTUS - perfect." 
879794139545468928 2017-06-27 20:10:43 UTC <Suavebones> @docrocktex26 Thank you, PJ, for posting *exactly* the rant that runs through my mind every damned day. I cannot even talk to the Bros any more.
879228756069449728 2017-06-25 06:44:05 UTC <Suavebones> @steph_bello What's the point of freaking out? The 2016 election was ALL ABOUT SCOTUS. With a GOP win, SCOTUS would turn hard right. Too late now.
879155692426280960 2017-06-25 01:53:45 UTC <Suavebones> Nobody can subpona Kislyak in the US. He has diplomatic immunity and no incentive to cooperate. But it does prevent his CIA "rendition."
879150564570836992 2017-06-25 01:33:23 UTC <Suavebones> @CourtneySwans20 @ananavarro Well, it IS murder. The jury just didn't find that way.
879147612711993344 2017-06-25 01:21:39 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey I blocked her weeks ago, but hate it that she is pursuing you viciously, Robin. Love and strength.
878800826004668416 2017-06-24 02:23:38 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence VP Pence, what are you smoking? This bill *removes* healthcare from our neediest citizens, including veterans. How DARE you lie about it?
878799351937499136 2017-06-24 02:17:47 UTC <Suavebones> @zenbuddi It's a pprivilege and a pleasure to block you.
878797867795730433 2017-06-24 02:11:53 UTC <Suavebones> @JuddLegum Free market competition to insure kids' health. That won't have any blowback, I'm sure.
878797577977708546 2017-06-24 02:10:44 UTC <Suavebones> .@JeffFlake we need #healthcare reform not cuts. Vote NO on any bill that doesn't protect quality care in AZ!https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ddo5i/4fnu3
878694426129743872 2017-06-24 19:20:51 UTC <Suavebones> @JenKirkman I've had a fantastically happy childless life. Zero regrets about the absence of kids. Don't doubt yourself.
878439991092756480 2017-06-23 02:29:49 UTC <Suavebones> Of course. They also just defunded the office in charge of monitoring RW hate groups and white supremacists.
878438963735744514 2017-06-23 02:25:44 UTC <Suavebones> @senorrinhatch Who on earth agrees w/ GOP about this terrible healthcare bill that punishes nearly everyone who is not rich, healthy, white and male?
878437531049578496 2017-06-23 02:20:02 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump Obama did a number of things about it, AS YOU KNOW. Stop lying.

878377130672889856 2017-06-23 22:20:02 UTC <Suavebones> @HillaryClinton @TEN_GOP Interested to see how all the folks in TN are going to do without their Medicaid and PP. Is that"winning," in your view?

878370144099024897 2017-06-23 21:52:16 UTC <Suavebones> @sarahkendzior I think women who take birth control (that is, most women) should boycott those employers and landlords. Bring 'em to their economic knees.

878340613581570048 2017-06-23 19:54:55 UTC <Suavebones> @Brasilmagic To which the Senate replies, "Only 74 million? Let's tighten those screws."

878307882726432768 2017-06-23 17:44:52 UTC <Suavebones> @hive_us I can adjust my Honeywell and my Nest tstats at two apts for free. This plan is ridiculous.

878304038328061952 2017-06-23 17:29:35 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @Endoracrat @lsgordon He was never a Dem. It infuriated me that Dems were painted as "centrists" or "RINOs" next to St. Bernie. He doesn't support civil rights.
878075270359429120 2017-06-22 02:20:32 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Thank you for your hard (and no doubt difficult) work. Tanking Medicaid will turn out very badly indeed, as anyone with a brain knows.
878074247188422656 2017-06-22 02:16:29 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 I vote "yes" on that idea.
878072714556088320 2017-06-22 02:10:23 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Ah, got it. I am truly disgusted by Sens & Reps who think 8 hr waits at ER, or being turned away for no funds, is any kind of healthcare.
878071708468498433 2017-06-22 02:06:23 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 I'm not criticizing the people who need whatever healthcare is available, but Cgpersons who think ER is a walk-in clinic and so defund ins.
878070506909454337 2017-06-22 02:01:37 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Exactly. That's what ER is for - urgent medical conditions like COPD crises, not routine health care.
878064369816395776 2017-06-22 01:37:14 UTC <Suavebones> @IStepFunny Stay strong, and THANK YOU!!!
878064214853599233 2017-06-22 01:36:37 UTC <Suavebones> @danmericaCNN So freakin' stupid ...
878061552913367041 2017-06-22 01:26:02 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 Why does the GOP think ER is *free*?!?
878060781882834945 2017-06-22 01:22:58 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid 2/2 I was paying $637/month under O'care with no subsidy. All but one provider pulled out of AZ - remaining co. charged $2000/month.
878060329619439616 2017-06-22 01:21:10 UTC <Suavebones> 1/2 Not quite a lie, @JoyAnnReid. One-third of US counties have a single ins. provider. They whacked up rates to be unaffordable to most.
878059609927200768 2017-06-22 01:18:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Avik Schmuck.
878059273925689344 2017-06-22 01:16:59 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis @tech_52 GOP obstructed penalties on ins. cos. leaving the O'care mkts. Result - 1/3 of counties have only 1 provider. Rates zoomed up accordingly.
878057186751991808 2017-06-22 01:08:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Acosta Hey MSM - How about ignoring, en masse, this wrong-headed Presidential instruction? WHY ARE YOU ABIDING BY IT?!?
878056663214772224 2017-06-22 01:06:36 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey And you have internet at 10K feet - sweet!

877318750659158016 2017-06-20 00:14:24 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes I have no shortage of words. A racist cop got an opportunity to notch the 'kill' of a black man, and did so, in cold blood.
877310894782283776 2017-06-20 23:43:11 UTC <Suavebones> @BraddJaffy Let's see what Mueller's investigation turns up re: the many meetings/convos Flynn had w/ Russians but 'forgot' to report, @RepStevenSmith.
877256534757003264 2017-06-20 20:07:11 UTC <Suavebones> @BraddJaffy @naimeiy Typically actors announce such things so that the industry knows not to pester them for roles. It also sometimes means they are ill.

876837351388880896 2017-06-19 16:21:30 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald , you cannot be serious. The lunatic, violent alt-left is *tiny* compared to the lunatic, violent alt-right. No equivalence.

876792919579017216 2017-06-19 13:24:56 UTC <Suavebones> Shhh ... don't tell him. I love seeing him shoot himself in the foot so many times that he now has foot Swiss cheese.
876792234292551682 2017-06-19 13:22:13 UTC <Suavebones> Imagine being an agent of right-wing social disaffection that has led us to Trump. Looking at you, @jpodhoretz
876790779187937280 2017-06-19 13:16:26 UTC <Suavebones> @TobiasBDog @primalaprincess I can't get my mind around such depravity. This poor girl and her anguished family ...
876789508628398080 2017-06-19 13:11:23 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey @ArthurSchwartz Oh, please *do* point to the professional accomplishments that place these Trump lawyers at the acme of their profession. I'll wait.
876576321626791936 2017-06-18 23:04:15 UTC <Suavebones> @patriothates45 @JohnFugelsang @marino6_marino And in some cases, aiding the chicanery. Last time I looked at Navajo jewelry on the Navajo res. being sold by Navajos, it was Chinese.
876574790441500672 2017-06-18 22:58:10 UTC <Suavebones> @QuakerRabbi @Evan_McMullin @maximirth10 And you were right - I read the transcript!
876539769873813504 2017-06-18 20:39:01 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS44 @realDonaldTrump @DearAuntCrabby @msmelo47 Troll.

876539098483355649 2017-06-18 20:36:21 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS44 @realDonaldTrump @DearAuntCrabby Picture Trump sitting down with each Sandy Hook family, as O did, to listen and offer condolences. Right - I can't picture it either.
876537482380165120 2017-06-18 20:29:55 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @JoyAnnReid No attorney of skill, probity and experience in federal political investigations would represent this toxic stew of an administration.
876535019933532160 2017-06-18 20:20:08 UTC <Suavebones> @neeratanden @TheRealSeanCrib @t_sp1n You are truly pathetic.
876534314409775104 2017-06-18 20:17:20 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Every time you deploy "dirt dumb bigot base," my heart does a little dance. 
876523732663062528 2017-06-18 19:35:17 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @TrumpGirlStrong @DineshDSouza @silverbanglesaz Please, for the love of everything you hold dear, *read the play* before you make more ignorant tweets.
876522823124107264 2017-06-18 19:31:40 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @DineshDSouza @Shulamit1959 Another idiot who does not know what the play is about. Does nobody read any more?!
876522469120655360 2017-06-18 19:30:16 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @DineshDSouza @renealmendra85 You don't follow the news, do you? This play was produced with a *black* Julius Caesar in 2012 in Washington. Where were your bleats then?
876521982887567360 2017-06-18 19:28:20 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @AnonymTipster @DineshDSouza @LorrieNJ50 Yeah, I always take moral instruction from Delta Airlines.
876521167430889472 2017-06-18 19:25:05 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @babysgramma @DineshDSouza @pawnotes Such ignorance - read the play and then tell me that its point is "inciting" assassination. The play is about how BAD assassination is.
876520765805314048 2017-06-18 19:23:30 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer @DineshDSouza @FilsonCooper Because ... why? Have you even *read* Julius Caesar? Do you know that half the play is spent *condemning* Caesar's assassination?
876516701281460224 2017-06-18 19:07:21 UTC <Suavebones> An article about Jamie Gorelick, Kushner's attorney (and a Dem), says she was crying in the interview about how friends had forsaken her.
876513098697285632 2017-06-18 18:53:02 UTC <Suavebones> @moiseschiu Heartbreaking. I do not care if he was a good or bad person - I care that he was executed for being black. Just shattering.
876512253276704768 2017-06-18 18:49:40 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid The entire GOP, and even some 'liberals,' are convinced that social welfare only benefits blacks, and "lazy blacks" at that. Disgusting!
876469970254807040 2017-06-18 16:01:39 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 No chance. He's just trying to smother the investigation flames to keep them from licking his doorstep.
876270862579638272 2017-06-17 02:50:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Nick_Offerman How unbelievably stupid does one have to be to shut down Shakespeare? Oh, wait, I *know* that answer ...
876266365673283584 2017-06-17 02:32:36 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane @Thetiredbroker Fairness to the very government that makes the laws about these things? Uh-huh.
876265832648548352 2017-06-17 02:30:29 UTC <Suavebones> @TheDemocrats @DailyCaller @coultejrr @NotBodhisattva How convenient for the violent haters.
876250443143196673 2017-06-17 01:29:20 UTC <Suavebones> @KattyKayBBC @tribelaw Mueller, if he lasts long enough, will definitely subpoena bank and phone records for Trump and his entities, so this news will be true soon

876228829072707585 2017-06-17 00:03:27 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane @Thetiredbroker Because - why? Some kind of weird symmetry thing?
876228541393682433 2017-06-17 00:02:18 UTC <Suavebones> @PaladinCornelia @JimKilbane @iamsarabourne No, it will probably do that, too.
876215481648074752 2017-06-17 23:10:24 UTC <Suavebones> @RWPUSA @gpg3 A few points: The President cannot directly fire a Special Counsel, per statute; he is *not* the CEO of the US; and he *can* be impeached.
876214621635346432 2017-06-17 23:06:59 UTC <Suavebones> @RWPUSA What conflicts? Name 'em. All attorneys represent clients and donate to charities. If those are "conflicts," nobody can serve as Special Pro

876196618629808128 2017-06-17 21:55:27 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Almost committed the sin of commenting on the headline w/o reading the op-ed. Would've made a huggge mistake. The piece is terrific.
876195008033902592 2017-06-17 21:49:03 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Please don't get your hopes up. No President ot ex-President is going to go to jail for anything less than filmed, pre-meditated murder.
876190210169556992 2017-06-17 21:29:59 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes Two words: oh, horseshit.
876188363304214528 2017-06-17 21:22:39 UTC <Suavebones> @WalshFreedom Glad to know you remain your true, appalling self, Joe.
876164559630815232 2017-06-17 19:48:04 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Sure, it is possible to consciously starve. It just isn't easy, and for 95%, the weight is regained, and then some.

876119710349238272 2017-06-17 16:49:51 UTC <Suavebones> Breathe deeply, @puppymnkey, and don't let these obvious trolls and jerks get to you. Block 'em and keep moving forward.
875890886701232128 2017-06-16 01:40:35 UTC <Suavebones> @thatperson007 I spit on you.
875890126890696705 2017-06-16 01:37:34 UTC <Suavebones> @Sifill_LDF @Snapple2Apple I would have voted to convict the officer, and returned to my neighborhood proudly. This verdict is absolutely outrageous.
875889255989387264 2017-06-16 01:34:06 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland @KamalaHarris I can never thank Jim Obergefell enough - he changed this country for the better.
875888115545546752 2017-06-16 01:29:34 UTC <Suavebones> @politico @rick5258 What happened to our society that women, by and large, go about their business without guns, but men "need" them everywhere?
875887554125471744 2017-06-16 01:27:20 UTC <Suavebones> @politico Hahaha!
875879947029553153 2017-06-16 00:57:07 UTC <Suavebones> @DailyCaller @HaynesParker1 @photognorma @ExpeditionsUSA Cheer up. Distrust goes both ways.
875879504614309888 2017-06-16 00:55:21 UTC <Suavebones> @TheDemocrats @DailyCaller @coultejrr Hate-filled propaganda comes straight out of the mouth of the President himself. Hate crimes are up sharply since his election.
875877861709684736 2017-06-16 00:48:49 UTC <Suavebones> @LindaLawrey @RepAdamSchiff 45 too has donated to Dem candidates, including Hillary. Does he have a conflict with himself?!?
875877259495718912 2017-06-16 00:46:26 UTC <Suavebones> @RedTRaccoon She is wrong. I wouldn't notice.
875877122744528896 2017-06-16 00:45:53 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr There's nobody more to blame than 45 himself for his reckless hiring, bull-in-a-china-shop heedlessness, and inability to close his mouth.
875875789501112320 2017-06-16 00:40:35 UTC <Suavebones> @BraddJaffy @JustNelse Thank you. It's been such a dire seven months - I deeply appreciate the encouragement. 
875874273214160897 2017-06-16 00:34:34 UTC <Suavebones> @BraddJaffy This kind of news is literally saving my life. My will to live has been draining out of me for months.
875870346838032384 2017-06-16 00:18:58 UTC <Suavebones> @EricLiptonNYT @NormEisen Need his BANK RECORDS!
875852528721645568 2017-06-16 23:08:10 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 @ed_kilgore E. Edwards' infamous comment seems apropos:  "The only way I'll be [impeached] is if they find me in bed with a live boy or a dead girl."

875770314617044993 2017-06-16 17:41:28 UTC <Suavebones> @leahmcelrath @TrumpBopBag Brits use the c- word liberally as meaning "jerk" or "idiot." Much less offensive there. Kids hear it online from Brit comedians.
875768425997414400 2017-06-16 17:33:58 UTC <Suavebones> @GeorgeLDuncan Have you listened to the Rhetorician-in-Chief for the last two years? He is a fountainhead of hatred and baseless accusation.
875767909368320000 2017-06-16 17:31:55 UTC <Suavebones> @GeorgeLDuncan Excuse me? Who says Mueller leaked anything? He met with Senate Intell. the day the news leaked.
875767129143820288 2017-06-16 17:28:49 UTC <Suavebones> @KatyTurNBC @BraddJaffy How utterly horrible. Saddest story of the day.
875765509328850945 2017-06-16 17:22:23 UTC <Suavebones> Six syllables:  un-con-sti-tu-tion-al.
875764155780784128 2017-06-16 17:17:00 UTC <Suavebones> @PepperGii @empiricalgirl True!
875762461382647808 2017-06-16 17:10:16 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald I want this letter to be correct but the legal analysis is skimpy.  Cited cases give scant support for Twitter as a designated public forum.
875759929285423104 2017-06-16 17:00:12 UTC <Suavebones> @KatyTurNBC Sez who?
875758585631789056 2017-06-16 16:54:52 UTC <Suavebones> @PepperGii @empiricalgirl Seems like small beer next to Clinton and Carter.
875745853612453889 2017-06-16 16:04:16 UTC <Suavebones> @BruceBourgoine Well, after all, it is unprecedented for a President or other admin. member to be hounded relentlessly ...
875743697043824640 2017-06-16 15:55:42 UTC <Suavebones> @DebraMessing I've seen people fired for *so much less.*
875735508973830145 2017-06-16 15:23:10 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 This awful woman ...
875734501309140993 2017-06-16 15:19:10 UTC <Suavebones> @amelie811 Disgusting woman.
875733338757058560 2017-06-16 15:14:32 UTC <Suavebones> @empiricalgirl @PepperGii Really? George W. Bush is 'devoted" to public service? Is there any evidence of that?
875732448872615936 2017-06-16 15:11:00 UTC <Suavebones> @ChloeAd35418085 @HexAngyl Given that Scalise is a major anti-gay hatemonger, this is strikingly ironic.
875719414443761664 2017-06-16 14:19:13 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ALT_uscis @geralds1 Intriguing, yet opaque. Details?
875715082625335296 2017-06-16 14:02:00 UTC <Suavebones> @LesterHoltNBC @joanwalsh What sense does this even make? The person who is investigating him is Mueller. Is he seriously saying Mueller told him to fire Comey?
875602418876129280 2017-06-15 06:34:19 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Dirtier than dirty, and looking for some payback beyond wifey's billet.
875601715743006720 2017-06-15 06:31:31 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 I'm not sure - it's also possible that Mueller asked him to put out a statement to quiet down speculation.
875246732170350596 2017-06-15 07:00:56 UTC <Suavebones> @BillKristol I am flabbergasted that I am following you, and agreeing with and enjoying your comments. Who knew Trump could be such a unifier?!
875214696885895169 2017-06-14 04:53:39 UTC <Suavebones> @thepoliticalcat @BitchestheCat Is it too soon to mention that Scalise got an A+ rating from the NRA?
875201026843963392 2017-06-14 03:59:19 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec Make no mistake, your party's President has stirred up unprecedented hatred and bile in thus country.
875200730768039938 2017-06-14 03:58:09 UTC <Suavebones> @dancindoti @SethAbramson Gotta applaud Mueller's move today. By making sure his investigation of Trump was made public, he inoculated himself against being fired.
875199761183330308 2017-06-14 03:54:18 UTC <Suavebones> @wdchongjr You have forgotten the evil things right wingers said about Gabby Giffords after she was shot. There are jerks on both sides of the aisle.
875199368051122176 2017-06-14 03:52:44 UTC <Suavebones> @JosephNSanberg @soren_grey @Lucypuff @TenaciousEye @wdchongjr Many poor people get gifts, or barter work for goods and services. Try looking beyond your narrow view of what the poor should own and eat.
875197626005827584 2017-06-14 03:45:49 UTC <Suavebones> @JosephNSanberg @arkreader So sorry to hear it. Nightmare.
875195598500003841 2017-06-14 03:37:45 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @TeaPainUSA @JustNelse Perfect!
875193214386397185 2017-06-14 03:28:17 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @TeaPainUSA Brilliant!!
875192976179208192 2017-06-14 03:27:20 UTC <Suavebones> @MattAsherS @WendyMarcinkie1 Indeed.
875192855211286528 2017-06-14 03:26:51 UTC <Suavebones> @MattAsherS Riddled with non-standard English, these points are a classic White House misfire - they don't clear POTUS, and they look desperate.
875047965798285312 2017-06-14 17:51:07 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @thehill @susanswann99 @bullybelleTN I am far from deranged. But a law that prevents carrying guns in public places might slow down the number of kook killings we're seeing.
875047525706735616 2017-06-14 17:49:22 UTC <Suavebones> @puppymnkey Scalise has an A+ from the NRA. He, and the GOP, get zero sympathy from me when they become the targets of their own misbegotten policies.
875046354480791552 2017-06-14 17:44:43 UTC <Suavebones> @20committee I favor banning the carrying of all guns in public places. Nothing in 2A says the right to "bear arms" means *everywhere.*
875004971703451648 2017-06-14 15:00:16 UTC <Suavebones> @MaxineWaters I do not condone shooting anyone. But I did not like Scalise before this incident, and my views haven't changed. He's still a creep.
875002615574036481 2017-06-14 14:50:54 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu Thank you!
875001411481751554 2017-06-14 14:46:07 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnDingell John Dingell, I flat-out love you!
874843659258257409 2017-06-13 04:19:16 UTC <Suavebones> @NormEisen Sessions is in contempt of Congress. POTUS invoked no privilege before his testimony; there is no standing right to invoke it in the future.
874842877423230976 2017-06-13 04:16:10 UTC <Suavebones> @sacca @NormEisen No it is not. If a client invokes a privilege and his attorney relies on that privilege, the attorney must ID the basis of the privilege.
874842472127631360 2017-06-13 04:14:33 UTC <Suavebones> @NormEisen @stephannie1226 Holder refused to turn over Fast and Furious documents, and the House voted overwhelmingly to hold him in contempt.
874801645191782400 2017-06-13 01:32:19 UTC <Suavebones> @Maggyw519 @WSJ @ropebelt Good to know.
874791633694244864 2017-06-13 00:52:32 UTC <Suavebones> @SenatorDurbin @thepoliticalcat Sen. Elizabeth Warren also called for him to resign.
874786126002700288 2017-06-13 00:30:39 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @brianklaas Them's some numbers right there.
874784571534983168 2017-06-13 00:24:29 UTC <Suavebones> Trump: I am not a liar. Sessions: I am not stonewalling. Kushner: I'm not even visible.
874754185941499905 2017-06-13 22:23:44 UTC <Suavebones> @Alyssafarah You need your hearing aids tuned up. He asserted a privilege that wasn't his to assert because 45 waived it. Also, no commitment on docs.
874750056586297344 2017-06-13 22:07:20 UTC <Suavebones> @rickhasen @ProfBainbridge @BenAdamsO_O @baseballcrank She was direct and non-pandering. Sessions was stalling.
874749544973516800 2017-06-13 22:05:18 UTC <Suavebones> @KarenTookeyCoff @SaysHummingbird Playing dumb? If that means "lying his head off," then I agree.
874725805204529152 2017-06-13 20:30:58 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @DanielleCC1 Not necessarily illegal. States have varying laws on this.
874718473800228864 2017-06-13 20:01:50 UTC <Suavebones> @politico Well, ain't that handy?

874690604575346689 2017-06-13 18:11:05 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @tekaldas @Magnolia0314 Troll.
874687505597054976 2017-06-13 17:58:46 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM @AliceOllstein Every day, I ask myself if it is possible to hate these m@therf@ckers more. Every day, they do something new to justify the answer "yes."
874683868640550912 2017-06-13 17:44:19 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @politico Biased? How?
874683512196022272 2017-06-13 17:42:54 UTC <Suavebones> @GOP @a2mech2000_k @ZemanLynnZ This looked like a pretty clear shot across 45's bows by Rosenstein.
874679654925254656 2017-06-13 17:27:35 UTC <Suavebones> @KarenTookeyCoff And thank you, in return!
874672220361994240 2017-06-13 16:58:02 UTC <Suavebones> @sinnrorsaint @brhodes Can anyone recall another Congress that played hide-the-ball like this with important legislation?

874669062923538433 2017-06-13 16:45:29 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis Which is *why* the Endangered Species Act was passed in the first place - to prevent landowners, mining co's, etc. from killing off species.

874656012640296960 2017-06-13 15:53:38 UTC <Suavebones> @kjblackhawk @ExitPass I doubt it. Rosenstein appointed Mueller. I think his testimony was a clear signal to 45 that he will not be "reversing" that decision.
874648062844469249 2017-06-13 15:22:03 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @dadastrumdrang Asssumes facts not in evidence - that any such conservatives still exist.

874461195331182595 2017-06-12 02:59:30 UTC <Suavebones> @RepAdamSchiff @Bryan_Healey @GDtheIII So? Does that make it right? Does that make 45 innocent (or look as guilty as hell)?

874456723242733569 2017-06-12 02:41:44 UTC <Suavebones> @elongreen @jaymarose Yeah, one which caused a nutjob Jones follower to head to DC, fire shots in a pizza parlor and demand to be shown the child sex slaves.

874338358595534848 2017-06-12 18:51:23 UTC <Suavebones> @politico I see Sean Spicer's legal skills are as finely honed as ever, with the sharp cutting edge of beach ball.

874336061849128960 2017-06-12 18:42:16 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @giants2007 Not challenged - why would it have been? Iran was holding 400+ US hostages, and canceling Iranian visas was to pressure for their release.
874335106080456704 2017-06-12 18:38:28 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @EricBoehlert @SaraKubik Three district courts and two appellate, if I recall correctly.
874334924588818433 2017-06-12 18:37:45 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @EricBoehlert @JustNelse I'll take that bet. I'm pretty sure there are at least four votes on the court to accept the petition.

874118414515585024 2017-06-11 04:17:25 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 @Uofm77 I am still on the point that those who get SSD have *already* paid into the SS system, unlike your claim above. Of course $$ is from SS pot.
874116651653799936 2017-06-11 04:10:24 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 Think you better check your facts, @Uofm77, before you post again on this topic. I did check mine before I posted, and I am right.

874023962233020417 2017-06-11 22:02:05 UTC <Suavebones> @dale_noone Louise Mensch is accusing @SheWhoVotes (Laura) of being a Russian agent for, among other things, criticizing Louise. Laura is objecting.
874011018023780352 2017-06-11 21:10:39 UTC <Suavebones> @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @kurteichenwald I watched him lie his head off in a business transaction with my client 35 years ago. I agree he will lie to anyone, about anything.
874007878809427972 2017-06-11 20:58:11 UTC <Suavebones> @js3things @BrendanNyhan This administration will literally say anything to justify itself, no matter how toxically untrue.
874007259541405696 2017-06-11 20:55:43 UTC <Suavebones> @js3things @culturejedi I'm so sorry ...
874006778878468096 2017-06-11 20:53:49 UTC <Suavebones> @anildash @koalallama Argghhh that anybody needs to ask!!!
874000193120686081 2017-06-11 20:27:38 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @JoyAnnReid "Collusion" will depend on the actions and intent of the Trump team, facts not yet fully developed. Trump Tower- ALFA servers, e.g.

873989449624858624 2017-06-11 19:44:57 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @RWPUSA Who on earth thinks Comey, formerly chief criminal lawyer in the country, did *not* analyze the law of document release before releasing?
873988688677621760 2017-06-11 19:41:55 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @RWPUSA @JewhadiTM @margo94 @smullins3000 @manfromatlan Are you a lawyer? No. Is Comey a lawyer? Yes. In fact, he was among the top US lawyers. I would definitely trust his judgment over yours.
873987908151107584 2017-06-11 19:38:49 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw @RWPUSA @grantstern Turley is hardly an authority.
873987736398680064 2017-06-11 19:38:08 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @RWPUSA Sec. 641 is, essentially, an embezzlement-of-gov't-ptoperty statute. Proof of value is a RQ's element of the crime. D/n apply to memos.
873981847793000448 2017-06-11 19:14:44 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @thehill No former FBI Director would be stupid enough to lie under oath. And Comey is the opposite of stupid.
873980939650584577 2017-06-11 19:11:08 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @amrie @AcKansas That's an optimistic assessment. I think he knows full well what division he is causing, and revels in it. #NoBernie
873958511943614464 2017-06-11 17:42:01 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 @Uofm77 You're uninformed. *Nobody* can get Social Security disability unless  they have paid into the Social Security system already.
873952204033368064 2017-06-11 17:16:57 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump You are engaged in an abuse of power and an obstruction of justice by defaming James Comey.
873951815875706880 2017-06-11 17:15:24 UTC <Suavebones> @MarkCorallo1 SO disingenuous. You were around, Corallo, for the last effort in 2006 to politically pressure US Attorneys. It did not go well. Take heed.
873707130506821633 2017-06-10 01:03:07 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis Thinning the herd ...
873702891944411136 2017-06-10 00:46:16 UTC <Suavebones> @RoseAnnDeMoro @jmartNYT Do they mean "everything BAD"? Because he is the reason we live in this current socio-political hell.
873649014352125952 2017-06-10 21:12:11 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland So exactly who was on the US side of this conspiracy, outside Trump and Flynn?
873635885530529792 2017-06-10 20:20:01 UTC <Suavebones> @AdrianCJax Bingo
873635658694184960 2017-06-10 20:19:07 UTC <Suavebones> @funder BF liar and guilty of espionage
873617874924912640 2017-06-10 19:08:27 UTC <Suavebones> @JackPosobiec No. He was prosecuted for giving *classified* information to his mistress. He should have gone to jail.

873561893717164032 2017-06-10 15:26:00 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw @ehartman1975 @grahamsw All true, but the law does not require every lawyer to accept every client. I do judge lawyers by their clients, for better or worse.
873553923549700096 2017-06-10 14:54:19 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Remarkable woman making strong statements - watch the men duck and cover!
873553639607906304 2017-06-10 14:53:12 UTC <Suavebones> @gbeckyhudson @johnnybluenote OK, so you are a world class prude. Thanks for sharing.

873432675473698817 2017-06-09 06:52:32 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes Is there *anyone* to the left of the far-far right who hasn't said exactly the same thing about 45?
873429524230266881 2017-06-09 06:40:00 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid Speech follows thought, so you're really saying he thinks strangely, and that is absolutely the case.

873401220982915072 2017-06-09 04:47:32 UTC <Suavebones> @TeaPainUSA Oh, sweet baby gumdrops, I am shedding tears of excitement and joy at this most welcome news!!
873372589304946688 2017-06-09 02:53:46 UTC <Suavebones> @clairecmc Senator, you wouldn't have been attacked if your words had not been so incisive on the issue of GOP hypocrisy. Keep up the great work!
873372038177538050 2017-06-09 02:51:35 UTC <Suavebones> Jeez, I just blocked Jeet Heer for this stupid statement, and here it is again, via Joy. @JoyAnnReid, please stop responding to Jeet.
873360397813727232 2017-06-09 02:05:19 UTC <Suavebones> @RogueNASA As Sen. McCaskill pointed out in the chamber, this is outrageous.
873349895951851520 2017-06-09 01:23:35 UTC <Suavebones> @PPFA @SusanGKomen @JoyAnnReid She was the sole reason I gave up on Komen. Her ugliness hurt that charity badly.
873322274484387840 2017-06-09 23:33:50 UTC <Suavebones> @HeerJeet No, he f'ing would not have won because *he did not win the primary.*
873271110636249088 2017-06-09 20:10:32 UTC <Suavebones> @Rosie @basquiatball And not one person in the western world will believe Trump over Comey.

873263136945520640 2017-06-09 19:38:50 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 Agreed - whichever way we got here, we're now here and will get the facts.
873262245551013889 2017-06-09 19:35:18 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes My spouse just said exactly the same thing.
873261791916285953 2017-06-09 19:33:30 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 Sorry abt mis-numbering!
873261680175661056 2017-06-09 19:33:03 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 3/3 I believe Mueller already had the legal basis to investigate the truth of any matters that might be used by Russians to compromise 45.
873261610747387904 2017-06-09 19:32:47 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 2/2  Trump said "hookers," and Trump was at the head of the campaign. In other words, I disagree that Trump opened a door for Mueller;
873261266156048384 2017-06-09 19:31:24 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 1/3 Thx! I understand your point better now, but not the article's: the FBI had already been investigating Trump campaign/Russia before
873257041355091968 2017-06-09 19:14:37 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @susanswann99 Comey testified that the FBI had been investigating the dossier long before that dinner.

873253114844897280 2017-06-09 18:59:01 UTC <Suavebones> @fireheather @MattAsherS @dale_noone As an advertisement for Texas tourism, this nevertheless leaves a bit to be desired. {deadpan}
873252304035618816 2017-06-09 18:55:48 UTC <Suavebones> @MattAsherS @fireheather First cheering thing I've read today. Thanks!
873249141786148864 2017-06-09 18:43:14 UTC <Suavebones> @ZeldaLackner @BraddJaffy Can you *believe* this huge Qatar mess that the hapless, feckless 45 blundered into, and from which Tillerson now has to extricate us?
873245149018570752 2017-06-09 18:27:22 UTC <Suavebones> @Amy_Siskind And in the course of objecting to a snotty comment made to @jk_rowling 's fine thread, a commenter called me a "twat."
873240592876093440 2017-06-09 18:09:16 UTC <Suavebones> @MalcolmNance @Stonekettle @chrisvanka "Practicing," in DC, usually means appearing on behalf of someone before a legislative, judicial or agency body. He's not there yet.
873239084478545920 2017-06-09 18:03:16 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @KarlyJ @LouiseMensch @Ibutterfly34 @ATSNLG Naive, possibly. Experienced in federal court litigation? Highly.
873237864632340484 2017-06-09 17:58:25 UTC <Suavebones> @Ibutterfly34 @greta Some people don't want to "hear" you, @Greta, because you frequently are a stone liar, not just "the other side" of a story.
873237391351234560 2017-06-09 17:56:32 UTC <Suavebones> I don't give a fig about your gender. I stand by my comment - your comment was off-topic and sexist.
873235758093524993 2017-06-09 17:50:03 UTC <Suavebones> @ExtremeLiberal Seriously doubt it.
873233922175279104 2017-06-09 17:42:45 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @KarlyJ @LouiseMensch @dmzhukova @Ibutterfly34 Kas, unless his ego blocks him, will team up quickly with competent counsel. Otherwise, as you say, he will undo himself thru ignorance.
873232795220365312 2017-06-09 17:38:16 UTC <Suavebones> @jk_rowling Really? You can't think of another way to criticize a woman's ideas or behavior except to call them genitalia-related names?
873232001561542657 2017-06-09 17:35:07 UTC <Suavebones> @jk_rowling @obligitoryname Wrong. The quality of being female differs - often greatly - from the social construct of "femininity." And stop mansplaining to women, 'K?
873231668152197121 2017-06-09 17:33:48 UTC <Suavebones> @jk_rowling Wrong thread, fella. You're wanted over on @BrosHateHos.
873228850842394624 2017-06-09 17:22:36 UTC <Suavebones> @TIME @SouthernmostPen @BraddJaffy My mother wouldn't have Time in the house when I was growing up - too conservative and 'Republican.' My, how times change.
873209603642671104 2017-06-09 16:06:07 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @KarlyJ @LouiseMensch @Ibutterfly34 @dmzhukova, you're working too hard at this. Litigators work across jurisdictions constantly using local counsel & pro hac vice admissions.
873207453374046208 2017-06-09 15:57:34 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @KarlyJ @LouiseMensch @Ibutterfly34 @dmzhukova So far, Kas hasn't 'appeared' in federal courts. If and when he does appear, he can bring along local counsel, get waived in pro hac vice.
873206945506775040 2017-06-09 15:55:33 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @KarlyJ @LouiseMensch @dmzhukova @Ibutterfly34 Kasowitz is not registered with local bars around DC. Question is whether he's 'practicing law in DC' at this point. Vexing question.
873201981489258496 2017-06-09 15:35:50 UTC <Suavebones> @NathanLerner Of course they recall the recession, and what led up to it - financial hijinks and mind-numbing bank profits They *yearn* for yesteryear.

872958563139715074 2017-06-08 23:28:34 UTC <Suavebones> Yes. And definitely.
872957857590779904 2017-06-08 23:25:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @code_name_v As was I, back in the day, at American U law school. Also taught classes to the FBI at Quantico. Lawyers disagree all the time, Ken.
872952415401549824 2017-06-08 23:04:09 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @code_name_v Why, Gilbert & Sullivan's "Trial By Jury" of course. ;)
872947884081111041 2017-06-08 22:46:08 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @SethAbramson I can say this - I would rather you be right than me.

872935908365918209 2017-06-08 21:58:33 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @code_name_v Retired lawyer who worked for 30 years in DC, many as a federal enforcement att'y. Lawyers love to wrangle about these pettifogging points!
872934310608740352 2017-06-08 21:52:12 UTC <Suavebones> @FiveThirtyEight Comey has no inside info about why Trump fired him. Like the rest of us, he believes Trump's own words.
872933444010913792 2017-06-08 21:48:46 UTC <Suavebones> @MattZeitlin Just freakin' infuriating. You'd think Dodd-Frank had hindered Wall St profits or something. (Spoiler - no.)
872928173008105472 2017-06-08 21:27:49 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @SethAbramson What is the meaning if "corruptly," then? Clearly it is a word demanding more than general intent? Otherwise, it is surplusage.
872927850575175680 2017-06-08 21:26:32 UTC <Suavebones> @code_name_v @SethAbramson We'll have to agree to disagree then.
872923770859560964 2017-06-08 21:10:19 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @ThomboyD Exactly.
872923130087354368 2017-06-08 21:07:46 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk Comey's perception of why he was fired adds nothing to Trump's own videoed statement that he fired Comey due to "the Russia thing."
872922431626682368 2017-06-08 21:05:00 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @code_name_v Yes. I am explicitly *disagreeing* with Seth Abramson, who has wrongly stated that specific intent is not needed for an obstruction charge
872920360580071424 2017-06-08 20:56:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @code_name_v If anyone is going to mount an obstruction case at some point, a jury will have to be persuaded of corrupt intent beyond reasonable doubt.

872910621011869696 2017-06-08 20:18:04 UTC <Suavebones> @ybbkaren Consensus of legal opinion is that Mueller *can* indict, but not prosecute until 45 leaves office. In any event, only Congress impeaches.

872895878289215488 2017-06-08 19:19:29 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 And the fact that he looks like a melting wax dummy?
872895510327078912 2017-06-08 19:18:01 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 Yeah, he was a real firecracker at the Benghazi hearing. Scored so many points against Hillary, leading to indictment, prosec ... oh wait ..

872865997518127104 2017-06-08 17:20:45 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @robwithanh @JennEFir @wiwa1953 @JasonInWA @nomohomo Nope. Proof of corrupt intent depends on the surrounding circumstances/context of the statements.
872865138574974976 2017-06-08 17:17:20 UTC <Suavebones> @RVAwonk @robwithanh @JennEFir @JasonInWA And that is untrue. Not just intent, but "corrupt intent," needs to be proven.

872813475545862144 2017-06-08 13:52:03 UTC <Suavebones> @POLITICOMag @politico @rich_marie Not necessarily about the parents. Do you not read?

872809486192304129 2017-06-08 13:36:12 UTC <Suavebones> @POLITICOMag @politico @rich_marie @mikup941 So what if parents knew? You think kids should be ripped from the only reality they've known because their parents cheated? That's just sick

872799250190553089 2017-06-08 12:55:31 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu @sevenbowie It's a ratcheting up of what is required to prove corrupt intent.
872798916391059456 2017-06-08 12:54:12 UTC <Suavebones> @TheBrofucius @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies @SvantesKatt The jury instructions were about what intent is sufficient to meet corrupt intent RQ for obstruction. Directly relevant, esp. as it was 9-0.

872794820078559232 2017-06-08 12:37:55 UTC <Suavebones> @starfirst @tedlieu @OMETA16 Constitution says otherwise.

872794340522774530 2017-06-08 12:36:01 UTC <Suavebones> @tedlieu @sevenbowie I'd argue you're wrong. Arthur Andersen v US, 544 U.S. 696 (2005).
872793696919404549 2017-06-08 12:33:27 UTC <Suavebones> @Etomi @tedlieu @JBartHenthorn SCOTUS ruled a Pres could be sued for *private* conduct. Bar on prosecuting a Pres for conduct related to his official actions still stands.

872788319981027328 2017-06-08 12:12:05 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @nodak2nova @Svinhuvud Flynn being compromised does not mean Flynn actually sold US out, or that 45 had knowledge of such.
872786810765623296 2017-06-08 12:06:05 UTC <Suavebones> @TheBrofucius @TrueFactsStated @Alt_Spicerlies 'Knowing what he was doing' is intent, but is *not* corrupt intent as required by law. Arthur Andersen v US, SCOTUS 2005.
872785355207868416 2017-06-08 12:00:18 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 Well, let's hope so.

872703176952004608 2017-06-07 06:33:46 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @nodak2nova @Svinhuvud Let's posit that Trump knew nothing about hijinks going on between his staff and Russia. In that case, all his comments about ending the 1/2

872686874480922624 2017-06-07 05:28:59 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson Alan *is* wrong here. But you're wrong too about proof of intent in obstruction cases.

872681491683188736 2017-06-07 05:07:35 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson, please read Arthur Andersen v. US, 544 U.S. 696 (2005) regarding "corrupt intent" in obstruction cases.
872680518101237760 2017-06-07 05:03:43 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @jessicadroeger Seth isn't answering this one because he is stone cold wrong about it. Corrupt intent - a higher level than general intent - must be proven
872678935166763008 2017-06-07 04:57:26 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @MichaelFischba1 Why would he be in contempt?
872677989904916480 2017-06-07 04:53:41 UTC <Suavebones> @Bros4America Thanks, bros!
872677707372298240 2017-06-07 04:52:33 UTC <Suavebones> @amelie811 Oh, I *hope* this is true!!!
872676783346262016 2017-06-07 04:48:53 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson He has to have a "corrupt" intent to obstruct; we don't have those facts yet. If those facts do show up, success or lack of it won't matter
872676322660593664 2017-06-07 04:47:03 UTC <Suavebones> @cdub77 No, @SethAbramson is wrong. Under Arthur Andersen v. US, law is clear that intent to obstruct is different from *corrupt intent.*
872666270230904832 2017-06-07 04:07:06 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @liamstack Disgraceful.
872641445538152448 2017-06-07 02:28:28 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @robinriesa Agreed it is wildly suspicious. But consciousness of secrecy is still not "corrupt motive." Again, I regret thinking this.
872591518976032769 2017-06-07 23:10:04 UTC <Suavebones> @ThePlumLineGS @Rashona No argument. I am just pointing out, contrary to many tweets today, that Comey's statement does not prove obstruction without more facts
872590981878521856 2017-06-07 23:07:56 UTC <Suavebones> @SenatorBurr @KamalaHarris @ShaunKing @ladyziggyloo1 @kim Men don't let themselves get talked over. So, good for Kamala!
872590392956301312 2017-06-07 23:05:36 UTC <Suavebones> @Rashona @ThePlumLineGS No disagreement there. My point is that Comey doesn't get us all the way to obstruction, as many (many) are claimed no.
872590012516253696 2017-06-07 23:04:05 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM It isn't enough to meet the "corrupt intent" requirement for proving obstruction.
872589370078908416 2017-06-07 23:01:32 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @JeffreyToobin @WhoShouldIVote4 @WeemsinCo Even if he said, "Damnit, Comey, bag the  investigation," the law requires proof of corrupt intent. Comey's statement is not enough.
872588098168791040 2017-06-07 22:56:29 UTC <Suavebones> @ThePlumLineGS @Rashona We were not in any doubt that Trump tried to spike the investigation. But Comey provides little grist for proving Trump's intent was corrupt
872585653082406912 2017-06-07 22:46:46 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff Whether POTUS sought to interfere *with corrupt intent.* That intent provision is the toughie.
872584777676619776 2017-06-07 22:43:17 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @robinriesa Nope. Intent to stop the investigation is not, by itself, corrupt intent.
872584564782137344 2017-06-07 22:42:26 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @Svinhuvud Comey's statement does not reveal corruption by Trump, unless you take a broad view of "I expect loyalty."
872584022467072000 2017-06-07 22:40:17 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @robinriesa Facts showing that Trump *knew* the Russia investigation was likely to harm him would, I think, suffice, but we don't have those facts yet.
872583640575688705 2017-06-07 22:38:46 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @robinriesa SCOTUS said "corrupt intent," in an obstruction case, requires a consciousness of wrongdoing rather than just a questionable result.
872581254759055361 2017-06-07 22:29:17 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @nodak2nova @Svinhuvud Doesn't show "corrupt intent," as required by law.
872547555363569664 2017-06-07 20:15:23 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @ALT_MyName Not corrupt per se.
872540952837079040 2017-06-07 19:49:08 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @Svinhuvud And what "corrupt intent" do they reveal?
872540795366068224 2017-06-07 19:48:31 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @robinriesa Intent to stop the inquiry is not the same as the "corrupt intent" that must be proven.
872538051741859840 2017-06-07 19:37:37 UTC <Suavebones> @SethAbramson @Jankowski60 @SportyDawn Requires proof of "corrupt intent" to get to obstruction. We don't have those facts about Trump - yet.
872537704801619968 2017-06-07 19:36:14 UTC <Suavebones> Horse hockey, @SethAbramson. The obstruction statute requires proof of corrupt intent. Where is that proof right now?
872537064381661184 2017-06-07 19:33:41 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @419Brownhornet We need further evidence of what Trump knew and when he knew it before the "corrupt intent" element of corruption can be proven. 2/2
872536538302697472 2017-06-07 19:31:36 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @419Brownhornet Comey's statement contains very little that would suggest pressure, other than the "loyalty" thing. He was not threatened or bribed. 1/2
872536156365242368 2017-06-07 19:30:05 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated Comey's statement is silent on the issue of Trump's intent, except for the "loyalty" comment. "Corrupt intent" is nec'y for obstruction.

871902994085822465 2017-06-05 01:34:07 UTC <Suavebones> @KhaledBeydoun @RNPJHP They do speak up. Constantly. They condemn terrorists, raise money for victims, hold vigils for peace. You just don't want to see it.
871901943047741444 2017-06-05 01:29:57 UTC <Suavebones> @ananavarro I may never stop laughing!!
871901389949030401 2017-06-05 01:27:45 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang @MajorPayne320 @dancindoti I think you're on the right track. I do think he has some kind of brain deterioration, as Reagan did, and handlers are taking full advntg
871893862293266432 2017-06-05 00:57:50 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang @MajorPayne320 @dancindoti I understand that part. Unfortunately, most of them don't seem to know how crazy they actually are.
871893125987422208 2017-06-05 00:54:54 UTC <Suavebones> @Rosie @Newsweek Thanks, Robert 'BernieBro' Reich, for putting *so much effort* into undermining Hillary that we have now reached this insane pass.
871890055312285696 2017-06-05 00:42:42 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang @MajorPayne320 You are a serious hazard to humanity. Why are so many vets stark staring crazy??
871888996204388352 2017-06-05 00:38:30 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias Speaking as a former member of airline management, you were told a "polite lie." Something was going on, but they never misplaced a plane.
871871060357947392 2017-06-05 23:27:14 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @TheDemCoalition @funder Nearly a quarter of this country is Catholic. Is he insane?
871865430821945345 2017-06-05 23:04:51 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ALT_uscis Thing is, he was likely to *win* until he opened his fat Twitter trap today. SCOTUS had a clear path to distinguish candidate T from Pres T
871864653911015424 2017-06-05 23:01:46 UTC <Suavebones> @markos @GottaLaff Richly deserved. Two toots from the Schadenfreude train.
871863818711744512 2017-06-05 22:58:27 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane Very pretty chapel - thx for the pix.
871861221246488576 2017-06-05 22:48:08 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert That awful *squelch* I heard?
871860172255150080 2017-06-05 22:43:58 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid I think the harder question would be this: How do we know whether Trump is off the rails or not?
871859914594934784 2017-06-05 22:42:56 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch Oh man, do I wish I were on that investigative team ...
871850914465824769 2017-06-05 22:07:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JimKilbane Where?
871847057622941696 2017-06-05 21:51:51 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland Outrage is an uncontrollable tic for some these days. The legitimate bases for it are endless, and sometimes, the innocent get splatted.
871840796810502144 2017-06-05 21:26:58 UTC <Suavebones> @benjaminwittes @jacklgoldsmith @SE25A Thanks, UK and Europe. Sane citizens of the US *really do* need your support and understanding as we try to oust this demi-dictator.
871839845580013568 2017-06-05 21:23:11 UTC <Suavebones> @AltDIA @worldonalert @Antihypocrite22 Um, that was what I was saying ...
871836380971782144 2017-06-05 21:09:25 UTC <Suavebones> @DanteB4u @RWPUSA @BoiGal2 Not yet. But watch what happens after today.
871836088624529408 2017-06-05 21:08:16 UTC <Suavebones> @RWPUSA @steven_huyck @ZeldaLackner of the Pres. After today, nobody can make that argument in good faith.
871835984400310273 2017-06-05 21:07:51 UTC <Suavebones> @RWPUSA @steven_huyck @ZeldaLackner Until today, Trump's lawyers had a defensible position that the things candidate Trump said about the EOs were not the official position 1/2
871835391103565824 2017-06-05 21:05:29 UTC <Suavebones> @AltDIA @worldonalert Yeah, killing civilians will certainly help weed out Daesh. [epic eye-roll] This is just disgusting news.
871834732882837504 2017-06-05 21:02:52 UTC <Suavebones> @KellyannePolls @Hooligans_R_Us @dumptrump33 They don't get to have it both ways. Either we listen to what the President says, or we ignore him. Which is it, Kellyanne?
871791337237913601 2017-06-05 18:10:26 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis What problem is privatizing ATC supposed to solve again?
871790690040127488 2017-06-05 18:07:52 UTC <Suavebones> @politico @TessDeco @OtisLift Sure, because the odiousness of fat people is worse than everything else, so thx for bringing that up.
871771221586624512 2017-06-05 16:50:30 UTC <Suavebones> @thenation The piece was overtaken by this morning's tweetle-wave of comments by Pres. (not candidate) Trump abt what the EO means.
871768854443077632 2017-06-05 16:41:06 UTC <Suavebones> @DavidCornDC Only if we can also kill all the suspected white supremacist terrorists ...
871768602566836224 2017-06-05 16:40:06 UTC <Suavebones> @gjlos24 @activist360 @BetsyGervasi Truly glad that works for you. But of no help to me - atheist here, and my dead mother would be even more rage-filled than I. Thx tho 
871754741209944065 2017-06-05 15:45:01 UTC <Suavebones> @JillSorbie @MonicaGoldberg My point, I guess, is that the people you mentioned lack principles, or at least the gumption to act on them regardless of their own stake.
871751153523974144 2017-06-05 15:30:46 UTC <Suavebones> @AndrewBeatty @IsaacDovere @pwgolfer @ssgsteveh @kylesnooze Confusing? Only if you read too quickly, are looking to pick a fight, or cannot follow simple logic.
871750194651582464 2017-06-05 15:26:57 UTC <Suavebones> @JillSorbie In that case, @MonicaGoldberg, it is important to define "we." I always thought 529 funds were a crock.
871744023622438917 2017-06-05 15:02:26 UTC <Suavebones> @gjlos24 @activist360 @BetsyGervasi Please - how do you put it away? I cannot find space large enough to hold it, and it is consuming me.
871743740045516800 2017-06-05 15:01:18 UTC <Suavebones> @activist360 And you wrote that *before* this morning's new and  unfathomable tweets against London's Mayor.

871612544833667072 2017-06-04 06:19:59 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Sure, nothing says "citizen well-being" like state controlled media.
871528326849896448 2017-06-04 00:45:19 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @JoyAnnReid My Xtra SuperBlaster Radically Accurate Translator App tells me that "European" means "white."
871485519439339520 2017-06-04 21:55:13 UTC <Suavebones> @dismayeddem As a person who paid off college and grad school debt for 19 years, I believe you are entitled to avail yourself of what good comes your way
871483789322575873 2017-06-04 21:48:21 UTC <Suavebones> @leahmcelrath By FAR the best thing to do about Megyn Kelly is to ignore her utterly. She is not a journalist, but a fake news provider. Cut her off.
871478831449812993 2017-06-04 21:28:39 UTC <Suavebones> @DonnaStGeorge @washingtonpost @jerlockholmes @DebraMcnally01 The article violated the first rule of journalism, which is to make sure *all* adult readers can understand what the story is about.
871474848840667137 2017-06-04 21:12:49 UTC <Suavebones> @MaxineWaters @JoyAnnReid @kelheath Yes.
871472941166321665 2017-06-04 21:05:15 UTC <Suavebones> @ericgarland Yeah, no. Snowden is not a Kremlin asset.
871471916917194752 2017-06-04 21:01:10 UTC <Suavebones> @MaxineWaters @JoyAnnReid This article says TYT is "progressive"?? Is there a new definition of progressive?
871440860881100800 2017-06-04 18:57:46 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald This article is a steaming heap of manure. In my experience, the most tireless workers for economic equality occupy the upper 20% of income.
871439955616079872 2017-06-04 18:54:10 UTC <Suavebones> @JillSorbie @MonicaGoldberg Those of us with principles have always agreed with fairer policies, even if they are at our personal expense.
871437642314809344 2017-06-04 18:44:59 UTC <Suavebones> @MarkWarner @jaketapper Funny how she jumped to a conclusion that EVERY OTHER THINKING AMERICAN has jumped to as well ...
871431919421882368 2017-06-04 18:22:14 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum @gravyfilm @Standrd_Deviant Well put.
871429175445409792 2017-06-04 18:11:20 UTC <Suavebones> I used to read "nothing from Frum" - too conservative for my taste. But my, how times have changed. Thanks, @davidfrum , for your principles
871377444577583105 2017-06-04 14:45:46 UTC <Suavebones> @jbouie And very upsetting.
871371333132623872 2017-06-04 14:21:29 UTC <Suavebones> @AndrewBeatty @IsaacDovere @pwgolfer @ssgsteveh You finally got there. Now apologize to the nice man, Stevie, for pissing on his shoe.
871300463294988288 2017-06-04 09:39:53 UTC <Suavebones> @ActualEPAFacts Who cares what this utter vacuum thinks?
871276059580289024 2017-06-04 08:02:54 UTC <Suavebones> @washingtonpost Utter Ka-thunking Stupidity? Did I get it right? Do I win a prize?
871167781927919616 2017-06-03 00:52:39 UTC <Suavebones> @mtracey By "erratic" and "intemperate," you mean she schooled your ass. Got it.
871128587402752000 2017-06-03 22:16:54 UTC <Suavebones> @joncoopertweets @pollymichel1 I saw the opposite message on a CNN chyron at the gym an hour ago, saying Trump *would* invoke executive privilege ... .
871127656334467073 2017-06-03 22:13:12 UTC <Suavebones> Love and strength to the UK - again - for this latest attack on freedom.
871126232644976640 2017-06-03 22:07:33 UTC <Suavebones> @AynRandPaulRyan @MollyJongFast Consider it a badge of honor.
871047444942934016 2017-06-03 16:54:28 UTC <Suavebones> @POLITICOMag @politico I's pronounced miss-ogh-in-ee.
871038679803768832 2017-06-03 16:19:39 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias @dismayeddem I still don't get it. Please share before I unfollow Matt for suspected assholery.
871008207291928576 2017-06-03 14:18:33 UTC <Suavebones> @KeithOlbermann @Eliza1Lana I'm tired of people blaming HRC for anything and everything.
871007977301352452 2017-06-03 14:17:38 UTC <Suavebones> @KeithOlbermann @iskandrah Thinking individuals are justifiably furious at the know-nothings like Jill Stein who helped tank HRC and elevate the orange horror.
870876631673454593 2017-06-02 05:35:43 UTC <Suavebones> @th3j35t3r You don't understand one single thing about science or biology or you wouldn't be spouting this horseshit.
870874422986526720 2017-06-02 05:26:57 UTC <Suavebones> @AltUSDOJ This is outstanding news. Andy Weissman is incredibly smart.
870873909469388800 2017-06-02 05:24:54 UTC <Suavebones> @anusha_srini @activist360 "Dirt dumb bigot base" is an outstanding distillation.
870872826319749121 2017-06-02 05:20:36 UTC <Suavebones> @TheGayHumanist @aravosis The key difference between Kathy Griffin and Ted Nugent - gender. Men get away with threatening behavior, and women do not.
870847608230629383 2017-06-02 03:40:24 UTC <Suavebones> @AltHomelandSec Trump can *try* to blick Comey's testimony, but it is far from a sure thing that he can succeed.
870807998523777026 2017-06-02 01:03:00 UTC <Suavebones> @Fahrenthold @washingtonpost @MikeLindblom The First Amendment guarantees the right to believe anything you want, but that fails to explain why evangs don't believe climate change.
870509792804052992 2017-06-01 05:18:02 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @peterdaou Chris Cillizza has his misogynist specs on again.

870431917581058049 2017-06-01 00:08:35 UTC <Suavebones> @FBI @johnson_carrie This is SUCH GREAT NEWS! Andy Weissman is a no-bullshit top talent.
870387289813209088 2017-06-01 21:11:15 UTC <Suavebones> @politico Wtf is he talking about? I mean, seriously - does this resonate on *any* level with things in the real (i.e., non-Trumpian) world?
870324228112777216 2017-06-01 17:00:40 UTC <Suavebones> @SmithsonianMag @amjoyshow Just appalling.
870162748386050048 2017-05-31 06:19:00 UTC <Suavebones> Knock it off, @Amy_Siskind. It was a clever, hilarious and much deserved response. Good for Hillary!
870158686869573632 2017-05-31 06:02:52 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnWDean Every day, it's like waking up to a new nightmare.
870006561929797632 2017-05-31 19:58:22 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 I think Paige turns full-on traitor.

869657771410456576 2017-05-30 20:52:24 UTC <Suavebones> @MEPFuller Every insurer but one pulled out of the Phoenix market in 2017. Remaining provider offered me a plan for $2000/mo, an increase of $1325/mo.

869621370870611968 2017-05-30 18:27:46 UTC <Suavebones> @sahilkapur Sure. Sure that's what he meant.
869619278231650304 2017-05-30 18:19:27 UTC <Suavebones> Never really thought I would be turning to you for words of comfort, @davidfrum , yet here I am ...
869618675635994624 2017-05-30 18:17:03 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill What possible reason is there to watch her show?
869616516156735488 2017-05-30 18:08:28 UTC <Suavebones> @politico THIS is what he cares about? Whether RUSSIA laughs at us, never mind the rest of the world that is thrashing about in paroxyms of laughter?
869614629605003264 2017-05-30 18:00:59 UTC <Suavebones> @politico @DurrDenier @MorganSweat104 Oh, right. Where did you pull that gem of information from?
869612669292040192 2017-05-30 17:53:11 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM POTUS tweeted the same thing today. Delusional.
869612339896631296 2017-05-30 17:51:53 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @ThePlumLineGS @paulwaldman1 @Proud_of_Obama I read it the same way.
869520915461095424 2017-05-30 11:48:35 UTC <Suavebones> @sahilkapur He is insane and an existential threat to us all.
869520182544187392 2017-05-30 11:45:41 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @JD_2020 Not really an economist, are you?
869411537601024000 2017-05-29 04:33:58 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis @fadiapierre Please, please improve your education before spewing nonsense like this again.
869410355956523008 2017-05-29 04:29:16 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid @Jeff_in_RI Deep breaths. Take deep breaths. And get back in the saddle tomorrow and keep resisting. We need you.
869281683878551552 2017-05-29 19:57:58 UTC <Suavebones> @Rosie Who the fuck are you, Benton Roosevelt, and why are you here? Go away, tiny man.
869279982471622657 2017-05-29 19:51:12 UTC <Suavebones> @POLITICOMag @sbg1 @politico No. Freakin. Way.
869278506957455361 2017-05-29 19:45:21 UTC <Suavebones> @Politics_PR @harleyrobyn @Rosie @PMc276 We are incredibly frightened too, watching this silent coup and knowing the family now controls the largest military in the world.
869274155924967424 2017-05-29 19:28:03 UTC <Suavebones> @Politics_PR @harleyrobyn @Rosie @PMc276 Seemingly it boggles the mind and sickens the stomach of every civilized person that Trump has such power.
869273221115162624 2017-05-29 19:24:20 UTC <Suavebones> @FBIPortland Thank you, @FBI Portland- it helps us all to hear that.
869272688044326913 2017-05-29 19:22:13 UTC <Suavebones> @Politics_PR @harleyrobyn @Rosie @PMc276 Oh dear God, Trump is upsetting your elderly mother in Ireland?! I don't know whether to weep or explode ...

869268351465340929 2017-05-29 19:04:59 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald Speak for yourself.
869267362519724032 2017-05-29 19:01:04 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @rogue_writer_1 Considering that Kislyak looks like Jabba the Hutt, it's definitely a puzzler how he evades memory.
869263309802840064 2017-05-29 18:44:57 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN I detest sports, but even I enjoyed listening to Frank Deford. Thank you, good sir.
869225824955674624 2017-05-29 16:16:00 UTC <Suavebones> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @ybbkaren @SqueezyTheCat Plus, it was in coherent English - dead giveaway that 45's tiny thumbs never touched that tweet.
868954598555344896 2017-05-28 22:18:15 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Suspend it pending investigation.
868669935941070848 2017-05-27 03:27:06 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou Ari Fleischer forfeited his credibility years ago.

868548261677735936 2017-05-27 19:23:37 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm Whole lotta Raqqa goin' on
868547195535896576 2017-05-27 19:19:22 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis And ... this is how fadcism takes hold. Terrify the populace, constrain their rights and privileges, and consolidate power at the top.

868545893561024512 2017-05-27 19:14:12 UTC <Suavebones> @POTUS @OneVoiceUS @thehill @Sobczaksusan *Eight* federal Benghazi investigations found no wrongdoing on Hillary's part and you are *still* talking about "her crimes"? For shame.
868543102557933568 2017-05-27 19:03:07 UTC <Suavebones> @resisterhood @Resisterhood, no worries whatsoever. It comes at one thick and fast these days.
868540336171122688 2017-05-27 18:52:07 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Yeah, and 'Goodnight, Moon' told me all I need to know about astronomy ...
868515219349266432 2017-05-27 17:12:19 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamParkhomenko Misogyny, thy name is @PatrickRuffini.
868514569819308032 2017-05-27 17:09:44 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @RegilioMichael No, no - I'm pretty sure I read on the Interwebs that the Earth is only 6000 years old and that dino bones are fake. Pls try to keep up.
868514102284386306 2017-05-27 17:07:52 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @TamalDas8 You know nothing. Seriously.
868513802441998340 2017-05-27 17:06:41 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum Dumb would be better - at least that's not espionage.
868508731738275841 2017-05-27 16:46:32 UTC <Suavebones> @resisterhood I was agreeing with you.
868508415496134656 2017-05-27 16:45:17 UTC <Suavebones> @ludacristiano @politico I have no recollection of gaining 40 pounds. And yet ...

868369968152297472 2017-05-27 07:35:08 UTC <Suavebones> @EricLiptonNYT Dear lord, this *in no way* sounds "legitimate." It sounds like "money-laundering" and "espionage."
868369522608164865 2017-05-27 07:33:22 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamParkhomenko The 14 hour plane trip to Riyadh wasn't enough time for him to read up? Smdh ...
868365993160069121 2017-05-27 07:19:20 UTC <Suavebones> @AriFleischer @Amy_Siskind Ari Fleischer *never* had any credibility.
868363522689781760 2017-05-27 07:09:31 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_uscis And they say the rich have no charm.
868360158975361025 2017-05-26 06:56:09 UTC <Suavebones> @AdamParkhomenko Jamie is a smart, experienced lawyer. This statement, though, is so freakin' lame that the only inference to be drawn is "guilty as hell."

868358409061515264 2017-05-26 06:49:12 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @jugie67 Exactly. Drumph is trying my patience, but Bernie-bots will wind up causing a stroke.

There are simply kind people and jerks.
868332710514671617 2017-05-26 05:07:05 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @Alabastyr Didn't start out that way, but I'm glad to hear it corrected course.

868289008870203392 2017-05-26 02:13:26 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Jamie has always been a gun for hire. Her Dem roots are not that deep.
868286030830460928 2017-05-26 02:01:36 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Gee, thanks, Joan, for opening up yet another Twitter stream where people can shit on HRC. They're so rare ...
868265598836289536 2017-05-26 00:40:25 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 But her emails ... 
868237073190232064 2017-05-26 22:47:03 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @WeeeeeSquirrel Perfect!
868235159048404992 2017-05-26 22:39:27 UTC <Suavebones> @TheGayHumanist @KaivanShroff Ivanka did not meet twice with Gorkov, as Jared is said to have done.
868233855299313664 2017-05-26 22:34:16 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @WeeeeeSquirrel Well, *we* know that, but they haven't openly admitted it yet. Give them another day or two.
868232559439654912 2017-05-26 22:29:07 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @WeeeeeSquirrel Guess it depends on whether the "war room" is being assembled to 'manage' the response to the investigation or to 'thwart' it.
868227031846211584 2017-05-26 22:07:09 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Duck and cover ...
868226866129256448 2017-05-26 22:06:30 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill @waterspryt Oh, honestly. A terrorist attack *will* happen in the US, but nervously "watching" for it will just give you a stiff neck. Go enjoy life.

868215671095574528 2017-05-26 21:22:01 UTC <Suavebones> @davidfrum Between failing to support Article 5 and shoving the Montenegrin PM, he looked like Putin's third-tier bully, sent to cause pain and dismay.
868194840500092928 2017-05-26 19:59:14 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @ChaoticK9s @jennyjonsin Smarter. We're smarter.
868193664341753856 2017-05-26 19:54:34 UTC <Suavebones> @AltHomelandSec Her campaign speeches were great. What part of misogyny do you not yet get?
868011016436633601 2017-05-26 07:48:47 UTC <Suavebones> @USATODAY Seems like the right outcome ...
867949205637050369 2017-05-25 03:43:10 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 I know our current standards for Presidential fodder are awfully low, but a candidate - James - with just a high school education? C'mon.

867819936642514944 2017-05-25 19:09:30 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias My view - it's leftist and good. Police unions insulate police from the repercussions of over-zealousness and outright thuggery.
867819081381982208 2017-05-25 19:06:06 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Of course they care. They care that the poor are always with us, and want badly for them to go away, die, or conveniently disappear.
867818395953020928 2017-05-25 19:03:23 UTC <Suavebones> @Fahrenthold @kenvogel Sure. I would be "admitting" my "lack of awareness" about now, too.

867812195869970432 2017-05-25 18:38:45 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Creepy white woman gets obnoxiously light sentence ...
867807484576120832 2017-05-25 18:20:02 UTC <Suavebones> @amelie811 @ACLU Congratulations, and thank you for serving our country better than the current administration does!
867806994630967296 2017-05-25 18:18:05 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou @cherokeesher2 @SailingCarol I'll put it this way: I would have said the same thing about Jared and Ivanka if they had been omitted from the visit to Jerusalem's Wall.
867804741480230913 2017-05-25 18:09:08 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Hell no, and particularly not with people holding guns.

867783509812822018 2017-05-25 16:44:46 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 Exactly.
867783306909163520 2017-05-25 16:43:57 UTC <Suavebones> @jaketapper Really? We ALL make mistakes at the level of criminal assault? Picture Hillary doing it, and then see if you can say the same, Steve.

867623455440502784 2017-05-24 06:08:46 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @Hitman1094 Son, that is *not* a "liberal judge." Liberal judges respect women and treat rape as an ACTUAL CRIME.
867622831713955840 2017-05-24 06:06:17 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN @EricaLindholdt Plainly we have skidded right off the fucking rails.
867574031209209856 2017-05-24 02:52:22 UTC <Suavebones> @anniekarni @politico It was a government-funded trip, ffs - why should anyone care if Spicer's personal religious views are catered to?
867573486100725760 2017-05-24 02:50:12 UTC <Suavebones> @paulwaldman1 Don't even sip from the poisonous Dobbsian well.
867572868988542976 2017-05-24 02:47:45 UTC <Suavebones> @tribelaw Gotta say that I do not give one hoot whether Spicer's personal religious desires were gratified on a *government funded trip.*
867554141073100802 2017-05-24 01:33:20 UTC <Suavebones> @JohnFugelsang I don't own a dog, but the smart people I know are pretty low maintenance. Maybe *you* are high maintenance and everyone near follows suit?
867553497243308032 2017-05-24 01:30:46 UTC <Suavebones> @peterdaou He thinks the Pyramids are 'grain silos,' too. Very low on brain power.

867473092544679936 2017-05-24 20:11:16 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM @AliceOllstein @DaeguDave So what's your point? Lying as a serving top member of IC means they will inevitably lie outside the job?
867466033455484928 2017-05-24 19:43:13 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM @AliceOllstein @DaeguDave Right. Clapper lied. This week's testimony was Brennan's.

866905335138615296 2017-05-22 06:35:12 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes This really cannot be hard to figure out. The names of government employees are a matter of public record. Cross-ref w/ lobbyist lists.

866099078261743616 2017-05-20 01:11:26 UTC <Suavebones> @amjoyshow Trump wouldn't dare fire Special Counsel at this point. An Independent Commission would clutter up the works.

865003596504473603 2017-05-17 00:38:23 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @BklynMichael42 Mueller is untouchable. It's a beautiful thing.
865003264277831681 2017-05-17 00:37:03 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @troublingtome He cannot fire Mueller. Special Counsel are outside POTUS's reach - that's kinda the point of them.
865002974128480256 2017-05-17 00:35:54 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes @ClarissaSchreed Nope. That's the point of a Special Counsel - they are outside the President's reach, while still controlling Exec. Dep't resources. Fun!
864967342924513284 2017-05-17 22:14:19 UTC <Suavebones> @MorganOrtagus @ThisWeekABC @OldSchoolGymRat Did we hear you complaining during the first official Benghazi investigation of Hillary? Or during the 2nd through 8th? No? Then shut up.
864729779097829376 2017-05-16 06:30:19 UTC <Suavebones> @StCollinson @CNN This is even a question?
864726176694009856 2017-05-16 06:16:01 UTC <Suavebones> @seanhannity @ALT_uscis Lying liars.
864665791911743488 2017-05-16 02:16:04 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid Wait, what? Money talks? Hit me with a stick ...
864605062454063104 2017-05-16 22:14:45 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Quit already, you horrid person.
864596971872333825 2017-05-16 21:42:36 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald @KnowbodyUSA @sewimperfect What good can he do? He cannot stop 45 from divulging confidences and squandered his credibility w/ the public. When asked to lie, resign.
864594113223577600 2017-05-16 21:31:14 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald @KnowbodyUSA @sewimperfect And wouldn't any decent person with a functioning moral compass, faced with that choice, retire?
864593801007964161 2017-05-16 21:30:00 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald @scdaylaw Nobody is forcing decent people to lie for Trump. That people *are* lying begs the question of whether they were ever decent.
864593443065962496 2017-05-16 21:28:34 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald McMaster has destroyed his cred defending DJT, so he can *never again* be called "a good man."
864591775515660288 2017-05-16 21:21:57 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill I thought it was a pretty accurate portrayal.
864591506547515392 2017-05-16 21:20:53 UTC <Suavebones> @mattyglesias At what point in this devastation do we die? Asking for a friend ...
864542406963679232 2017-05-16 18:05:46 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara Congratulations, and well-deserved!
864541268780527616 2017-05-16 18:01:15 UTC <Suavebones> @PressSec @ALT_uscis I'm sure Cruella de Vil was a nice little girl, too. Your point?
864540780446105600 2017-05-16 17:59:19 UTC <Suavebones> @JoyAnnReid You mean "former credibility." He now has zero credibility.
864539229631557632 2017-05-16 17:53:09 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm Will I meet a tall dark stranger?
864538604915245056 2017-05-16 17:50:40 UTC <Suavebones> @JuddLegum He has zero credibility left. He could make his biggest impact right now by resigning in disgust.
864160952593272832 2017-05-15 16:50:01 UTC <Suavebones> @politico The DC area has many private scools offering academic excellence. St. Andrews/Maryland is not among them.
864152587850850304 2017-05-15 16:16:46 UTC <Suavebones> @bartongellman @Barton Gellman, frankly, I expect better of you. Why not take a wait-and-see instead of being all pissy? EDVA may well have some big news.
864151904552501248 2017-05-15 16:14:03 UTC <Suavebones> @_Almaqah @bartongellman @mommalaurie101 That was private conduct, not public conduct. Key difference, legally.
864148301066551296 2017-05-15 15:59:44 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara As a former US gov't lawyer, I applaud your point, though expect no change. I watched hiring attorneys ditch resumes for those very things.
864008763732180992 2017-05-14 06:45:16 UTC <Suavebones> @thehill Probably more links between bulls and shit than between Clinton and Russia.
864008225187700737 2017-05-14 06:43:08 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @20committee Hey, Snowden's a *nice* guy, not jealous like those other gits.
863579900229304322 2017-05-13 02:21:07 UTC <Suavebones> @TrueFactsStated @LouiseMensch If they cannot prosecute, I don't see how the indictment will become unsealed. ??
863578474614673408 2017-05-13 02:15:27 UTC <Suavebones> @TPM Yeah, and he also said he was not in a position to know. Which kinda changes the message COMPLETELY, no?
862438969832685569 2017-05-10 22:47:28 UTC <Suavebones> @Snowden Ed, you are still a beacon of moral rectitude. Thank you.
862436947620265984 2017-05-10 22:39:26 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara Troubled? TROUBLED? I'm *apolpectic.* Why isn't everyone else???
861375523368296448 2017-05-07 00:21:43 UTC <Suavebones> @alt_labor I am elderly and speak that language fluently. No apologies nec'y.
861041230406270976 2017-05-06 02:13:21 UTC <Suavebones> @StephenAtHome @AltHomelandSec Retired lawyer here, wondering wtf jurisdiction the FCC has over Colbert's studio audience? Nobody else *heard the bleeped words.*
861040612501463044 2017-05-06 02:10:54 UTC <Suavebones> @AshLeeStrong What part of *deliberate cruelty* is the 'tolerant left' supposed to be tolerating? Please be specific.
861039336870952960 2017-05-06 02:05:49 UTC <Suavebones> @PaulBegala @DWTheOriginal My life is dull. What can I say?
860688374348234752 2017-05-05 02:51:13 UTC <Suavebones> @PaulBegala @DWTheOriginal No. In my view, we're all dead in a year.
860688119971983360 2017-05-05 02:50:13 UTC <Suavebones> @joshtpm @PaulBegala Agreed - optimistic.
860684477286068225 2017-05-05 02:35:44 UTC <Suavebones> @KeithOlbermann Keith, as a retired gov't lawyer who regularly worked with DOJ, FBI and USAs, my sense is that your explanation is bang on target.
860676788669661185 2017-05-05 02:05:11 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_DOJ @Silentman0 Yabbut ... he was BLEEPED and his mouth was blurred. So he did *not* say "cock" to anyone but his studio audience -outside FCC jurisdiction
860675812663582721 2017-05-05 02:01:18 UTC <Suavebones> @ALT_DOJ An *investigation*? What facts are missing here? Such BS ...
860548046425276416 2017-05-05 17:33:37 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @PolyticalAnimal Awful lot of young peopke voted for Trump too ...
860547502008709124 2017-05-05 17:31:27 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @margowill77 And hatred for women.
860547412779192320 2017-05-05 17:31:06 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh Women take note - white men are *gleeful* to take away your health care.
860196954705321984 2017-05-04 18:18:30 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Journos - pls stop saying "Aetna (etc.) withdraws from exchanges because they *lost $X million? Hell no - just *making less profit.*

859669899408310272 2017-05-03 07:24:10 UTC <Suavebones> @EricBoehlert @rhiannonjosette @MrBlifil Been that way since it fawned on Reagan.
854139966477058048 2017-04-17 01:10:11 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN Didn't Kellyanne's husband already persuade SCOTUS that this isn't true in the Paula Jones case?
852963184507985920 2017-04-14 19:14:05 UTC <Suavebones> @Snowden @AngelaKrebs444 Oh, @Amy_Siskind, that is untrue. Stop cutting and pasting issues to fit your notion of "enemy."
851514180876226561 2017-04-10 19:16:15 UTC <Suavebones> @Fahrenthold, congratulations on winning a Pulitzer! Fantastico!!
851181661186281472 2017-04-09 21:14:56 UTC <Suavebones> @kylegriffin1 What makes you think he hasn't already?
850474540329082880 2017-04-07 22:25:06 UTC <Suavebones> @kurteichenwald Really? The right thing? I doubt that any good whatsoever will come of this.
850133176928280576 2017-04-06 23:48:38 UTC <Suavebones> @alt_labor Good luck, godspeed, and hire a fine lawyer.
850128945278091264 2017-04-06 23:31:49 UTC <Suavebones> @AngelaKrebs444 @kylegriffin1 We already know 45 can't count. Every statistic he cites is off by large percentages, and sometimes by orders of magnitude.
849081828459859968 2017-04-03 02:10:57 UTC <Suavebones> @mitchellreports @JoyAnnReid Bill Coleman hitchhiked from Middleburg to DC law firm during Pres Day storm of '79, only 1 of 2 at work that day. My spouse was the other.
848658140761530368 2017-04-02 22:07:22 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes Isn't that big of them? Women make up 51% of lawyers.
848362256022634496 2017-04-01 02:31:38 UTC <Suavebones> @joanwalsh @resisterhood Fuck Susan Sarandon. She is partly responsible for the great evil that has befallen us.
843553444669542400 2017-03-19 20:03:08 UTC <Suavebones> @CNN If I want veggies, I'll eat veggies. But I want my damned cake to be CAKE.
842506755888177152 2017-03-16 22:43:58 UTC <Suavebones> @chrislhayes Why would *anyone* need to listen covertly to 45? He is a walking bullhorn of his every idiot thought ...
841023586429157376 2017-03-12 20:30:23 UTC <Suavebones> @TWNGhesquiere @LouisVuitton With that thing, you're ready to climb the scaffolding and get to work on the girders. #ugliestthingeverever
840728071024005121 2017-03-11 00:56:06 UTC <Suavebones> @PreetBharara Thank you for your service to law and justice. There are few harder jobs than USASDNY. But srsly, be glad u escaped.
837738212864897024 2017-03-03 18:55:29 UTC <Suavebones> @NBCNews @VP @alt_labor REPEAL?!? Hell no.
837733002075500545 2017-03-03 18:34:46 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes No it didn't "echo" Clinton's use of a privare server. She set up *her own* server. Pence used AOL, ffs.
836768764137893888 2017-02-28 02:43:14 UTC <Suavebones> @molly_knight , I went one better. I never tuned in.
833758306602676225 2017-02-20 19:20:45 UTC <Suavebones> @nytimes , Thanks for the information. Many of us will use it. Ignore the deplorables.
833493571575517185 2017-02-19 01:48:47 UTC <Suavebones> Either Trump *knew* there was no terror attack, or he, as leader of the free world, didn't give a crap. Which was it?
833493464113311744 2017-02-19 01:48:22 UTC <Suavebones> Trump *thought* Sweden was attacked, but sent no condolences/denunciations/aid, and sought no facts from diplomats/intelligence sources.
