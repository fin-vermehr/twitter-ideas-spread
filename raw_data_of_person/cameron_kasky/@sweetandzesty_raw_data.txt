965640187849003008 2018-02-19 17:32:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @alexandraerin Yes! They need to be able to be kids and adults need to step up where weve failed previously. We cannot expect these kids to lead. They need to be able to grieve. Im grateful to those who are speaking out and want to continue the work for them
965367007049695232 2018-02-18 23:26:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sesmith Thank you for speaking the truth.

965013580331405312 2018-02-17 00:02:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Im proud of these kids for stepping up and telling truth. I am also ashamed of us as a country because at 16 I was worried about making varsity volleyball, not worrying about changing laws to be protected at school. Adults, WE NEED TO DO BETTER.

961713315700383744 2018-02-08 21:28:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife Preach. I hate cooked carrots.
960983038480982017 2018-02-06 21:06:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> I had a dream last night that a friend introduced me to his family (cousins and stuff) and they were all little  people and they weren't called little people but instead magical people.
960935209091842048 2018-02-06 17:56:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am at the dentist office. Im so tired from moving I want to lie down on the floor and go to sleep.
960529340936024070 2018-02-05 15:03:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Probably because Im moving today and Im stressed
960248664219250688 2018-02-04 20:28:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> The thing about this date...after that conversation I know I absolutely will have to make the first move-enthusiastic consent and all that.  Im accustomed to holding the key. Im not used to holding the key out and asking a man to take it.
960220304986456064 2018-02-04 18:35:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> Was on a date last night and we were talking about consent and #metoo and he said the aziz story made him realize that he had most likely crossed the line of enthusiastic consent twice. It was an interesting convo.
960203572519452672 2018-02-04 17:29:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BabyFaceMckie He is a gaslighting piece of crap.

953156517229768704 2018-01-15 06:46:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> There was this time a guy dropped hot wax on my butt during sex. I was pissed, told him so, and told him not to do that again. He did. Did I leave? Not right away. I had to wait until I could, safely.

952759502423511040 2018-01-14 04:29:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ive had sex when my no was taken as a keep trying. In every case I made a choice to trade sex for safety. Id rather be called a slut than be beaten and that was absolutely my two choices in some cases.

952347261471633409 2018-01-13 01:10:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Gonna make this my phone wallpaper
952306501170823168 2018-01-13 22:28:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have no words for the text conversation I having right now.
952084344734019585 2018-01-12 07:46:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Just come to California we will get that issue solved.
952016355221385216 2018-01-12 03:16:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> Men, stop doing this. Just stop.
952016353539403776 2018-01-12 03:16:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I guess my point is, all women have their own shitty man list and we all warn each other away.
952016352021159937 2018-01-12 03:16:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I also remember the most recent time I was warned away from a man. I cannot tell details as I have signed an NDA. But it was recently.
952016350284673024 2018-01-12 03:16:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> Dr C was fired for impropriety some years later.
952016347138990080 2018-01-12 03:15:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> I did have to see him once when he was on call. I took my husband into the exam room. (I was young, maybe 21). When my husband left the room Dr C put his hand on my knee.
952015515735638016 2018-01-12 03:12:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I remember the first time I was warned away from a man. My mom told me never to go to Dr C who was a partner the family practice group we went to. If I *had* to see Dr C, make sure someone went with me.
952013830745292800 2018-01-12 03:05:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @LifeAsKing I could rant for hours.
952013494232100864 2018-01-12 03:04:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @LifeAsKing I was married to a doctor. They are the WORST.
952013290544115713 2018-01-12 03:03:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Its funny how sometimes you dont talk to someone for a long time but you still just know whats going on with them.
951886479793336320 2018-01-12 18:39:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wow Ann coulter is vile
951837126819069953 2018-01-12 15:23:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> I had a dream. Then I had a dream I was describing my dream to someone.
951684774153699328 2018-01-11 05:18:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> @JennaJ55 Yes!! I also think the original is creepy too. As a kid I was enthralled AND terrified watching it. That boat scene?! Hands that come out of the wall and grab your coat?! Ack!!!
951684260171104256 2018-01-11 05:16:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @jmzcustomz Yes!!
951682501138817024 2018-01-11 05:09:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is wonderful and also mildly creepy.
951604851309395969 2018-01-11 00:00:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> If you live in a small town where everyone knows each other and is related and helps each other, how is that better than living anywhere else?
951602362589720576 2018-01-11 23:50:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Im curious as to why the middle of the country is always touted as hard working down to earth.
951580665077641216 2018-01-11 22:24:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair Yessss!!
951575344175136769 2018-01-11 22:03:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair Fifty shades of Grey. But yeah, I cant tear a book. Thats just wrong. So wrong. SO WRONG
951573301108752384 2018-01-11 21:55:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair It is so beyond my comprehension.
951571722733461504 2018-01-11 21:49:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.
951172407485591552 2018-01-10 19:22:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> .@angela_rye is the BEST. Thank you for speaking the truth.
950817982053314566 2018-01-09 19:54:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have three appointments today including a dentist appointment!!!
950815495762075648 2018-01-09 19:44:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> All three cats are on the bed at once.   Oops, now they arent.
950561826265120768 2018-01-08 02:56:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Whats its name? Henry? Amelia? Mr. Krabs?
950488443909373952 2018-01-08 22:04:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> Someone should buy me a pair of shoes. #yesyou
950488329304252416 2018-01-08 22:04:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am extremely irritable today.
950151773569744897 2018-01-07 23:46:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Seeing yet another man mansplain the wage gap just made me wanna punch him. I need to take some lessons so I can punch well.
950151201034616832 2018-01-07 23:44:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Hoorayforfoxes Gross.
950148285007736832 2018-01-07 23:32:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> I live in LA where the crime has gone down. But I keep getting slaughtered anyway.https://twitter.com/alt_uscis/status/950110400678375426
950140228781596674 2018-01-07 23:00:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut When I asked for nerdy guys, I got nerdy guys. Luckily they are cute too.
950137190406696960 2018-01-07 22:48:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut Im seeing The Last Jedi for the second time in 24 hours.
950133502141382656 2018-01-07 22:34:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> A side effect of assembling a male harem is seeing movies multiple times. I actually enjoy this side effect a lot!!
950128488761012224 2018-01-07 22:14:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane Fascinating. I guess I am in my own liberal bubble in California so I dont see it as much.
950127408308412416 2018-01-07 22:10:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I think you nailed it.   I do understand how it could be hard to be centered for an entire life (generations even) and then be told that your actions are crappy. Mature people do some introspection and change. Tantrums wont stop progress. Join or be left behind.
950126205633572864 2018-01-07 22:05:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane Exactly!! And what spoiled brat actually writes a story about it and what kind of privileged newspaper actually publishes it!!!
950125584171937792 2018-01-07 22:02:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am happy to provide a list of acceptable topics of conversation and also actions for party goers. Please DM for pricing.
950125301203288064 2018-01-07 22:01:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> Like do men REALLY think that they cannot go to a party and behave like a normal functioning adult? Who are these privileged POS whiny baby men who cannot socialize without making someone uncomfortable. Get a GRIP.
950122685543079936 2018-01-07 21:51:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ummm. If men cant control themselves in ANY social situation they can go fuck off. This is so fucking ridiculous. As women we should be resigned to getting groped and propositioned at any and all functions? Fuck this SHIT.pic.twitter.com/lvFkulkbsd
950121574245449728 2018-01-07 21:46:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing Straight rich white men I would think.
950120351861587968 2018-01-07 21:41:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing Im in love with the coat. The only thing so far in that issue I like

948744925079732225 2018-01-03 02:36:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I honestly would like to know if a trans man has the same issue. Or a trans woman.
948744638608818178 2018-01-03 02:35:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @blueholly @Seattle_JC Hmm. Do you think it is love and not a penis that breaks your eyesight? I like that theory.
948744330990137344 2018-01-03 02:34:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Having a penis fucks with your eyesight I guess?
948743866794029056 2018-01-03 02:32:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Please note all these things are in the correct places. And he was looking IN those places.
948743861190340608 2018-01-03 02:32:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> Add tape measure in the sewing kit to things the bf cannot find today.
948742478584209409 2018-01-03 02:26:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> Why cant men find things? My bf so far today has been unable to find the eggnog in the fridge, a bracelet in the jewelry box, and a t shirt in the dryer. FFS
948719218421149696 2018-01-03 00:54:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Stop allowing targeted harassment of women and POC.https://twitter.com/jack/status/943965890588106754

947363921739915264 2017-12-30 07:08:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> @KosherSoul I believed her then. I was pretty young but already knew about creeper men. We learn young.

922246629792423936 2017-10-22 23:41:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I thought it was a pretty lie but it happened to me. Twitter magically unfollowed people I follow.

920654131873714177 2017-10-18 14:13:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> The most unbelievable part of Hamilton is that a man could write so many letters to a woman without sexting.
920647568513568768 2017-10-18 13:47:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages He is so amazed I dont need a man. He is still talking about it

918189687272906752 2017-10-11 19:00:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @POTUS @jaydeflix Its frankly disgusting that the president has no concept of the constitution
917974952619446273 2017-10-10 04:47:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> Is someone running the country or are we just gonna argue about which wife and IQ and nfl until DJT bombs NK?
917953391535407104 2017-10-10 03:21:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Right? I thought it was kinda funny but then he said feminists were just sad and blah blah and that was it for me.
917950100994891776 2017-10-10 03:08:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> I stopped following shatner. He has a problem with feminism.
917950005431828480 2017-10-10 03:08:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> Who recommended The Tick to me? @mizellw I think. I  it!!

917253458385788929 2017-10-08 05:00:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I almost passed out when I met Jason Momoa. So much hotness.
917253179896586240 2017-10-08 04:59:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Mikes_Brother So if that is true they must believe that trump will not get us killed right?
917252505062404097 2017-10-08 04:56:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> If all the gop know trump is a walking dotard, why dont they do anything? Is being in power worth dying in a  war started by an idiot?
917248267062206464 2017-10-08 04:40:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill YASSS! Giant Freddy Mercury!
917247835052974082 2017-10-08 04:38:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill One thing I thought rang false is the way the world was so het norm. Gay men would have the most amazing giant sex hologram ads
917247146302226432 2017-10-08 04:35:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Horror on one side and monetizing it on the other. It really was amazing in some respects.
917246913291870209 2017-10-08 04:34:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Wait. What I mean...it hinted of that. The next one could take things new places and be amazing.
917246664544419842 2017-10-08 04:33:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill If the next one lives up to the promise that it I
917245783153418240 2017-10-08 04:30:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill For her?!
917245750857187328 2017-10-08 04:30:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill It was definitely good. Did you find  JOI the more apt name ever for herb
917245342902403073 2017-10-08 04:28:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Maybe you are deeper than I am. Im going to see it again next week after watching the first one. I will think about that.
917244596672851968 2017-10-08 04:25:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill RGs acting though...so stoic, then when he discovered things...I thought he might break in half. Amazing.
917244383774126080 2017-10-08 04:24:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Really? I will need to think about that. It seemed to me that no woman had agency. They all worked/performed for men. Except 2 of course
917237020585373697 2017-10-08 03:55:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Eh...Get Out was amazing. BR2049...so male centric it took me out of the movie considering the whole premise was female centered.
917228452738088961 2017-10-08 03:21:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> You always know the right things to say!!!
917228353345560576 2017-10-08 03:20:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> I want to go on a rant. But let me just say this- the so called liberal Hollywood elites have better morals than the GOP
917226549882978304 2017-10-08 03:13:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> Not very holiday-ish
917226477946470400 2017-10-08 03:13:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Maybe? I havent really looked. Im gonna spend the day unpacking shit.
917216134918676480 2017-10-08 02:32:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Cool! That sounds adventurous and also buggy.
917215731871133696 2017-10-08 02:30:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> Where are you going?
917215272842309632 2017-10-08 02:28:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> Aufweidershen, goodnight? (Sorry for spelling like crap)
917214878615474176 2017-10-08 02:27:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am very excited that tomorrow is Indigenous People day here in LA. Its just cool.
917214145031716864 2017-10-08 02:24:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Apparently our cowardly VP who is offended by black people protesting but not by actual Nazis, is in town. #kneel

916902154647908355 2017-10-07 05:44:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> Omg. Im sorta tempted.
916901624596926464 2017-10-07 05:42:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> A friend on FB just posted how its time to go full Lysistrata. The idea has legs.
916901503687729152 2017-10-07 05:42:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis @msbellows Thats gotta be one of those unpopular opinions :)
916899386172440576 2017-10-07 05:33:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> I WANT TO BELIEVE
916899085663141889 2017-10-07 05:32:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis @liliana_leigh Ive never seen that! Amazing. And oddly satisfying.
916897418922176512 2017-10-07 05:25:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> I would but again, 53% of white women voted for that oozing pus pocket and so I dont know if it would work.
916897243701026816 2017-10-07 05:25:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis @msbellows Yes! And there was an episode of The Whistler- a radio show- where a woman was the villain and wasnt punished. Also big news then. #nerd
916896769648189446 2017-10-07 05:23:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis Intention, tho. Potters intent is to harm and Billys isnt.
916894524990877696 2017-10-07 05:14:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Men need to realize cutting women rights impacts THEM. Immediately. And yeah it wouldnt work in your sitch.
916894349950050304 2017-10-07 05:13:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes exactly that but even more. Stop managing the household. Stop reminding of appointments. Stop preparing food.
916894069669847041 2017-10-07 05:12:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hold please, looking up something totally unrelated* to this tweet on google.  *not totally unrelated actually
916893765847023616 2017-10-07 05:11:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis Apparently it was a big deal back in the day. Maybe that is common knowledge.
916893674750877696 2017-10-07 05:11:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis I will have to think about that. You have blown my perception. Did you know it was the 1st movie where the villain wasnt punished?
916892064985399296 2017-10-07 05:04:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @owillis Not Potter? He is also villainous.
916891747539591168 2017-10-07 05:03:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Of course, since 53% of WW voted for the pos, it may be just a dream.
916891593176522758 2017-10-07 05:02:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> If women stopped sex, emotional labor and household chores until this shit was cleaned up, maybe men would do something.
916877669135822848 2017-10-07 04:07:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> I dont know if it is live action or animated. I guess I assume animated?
916874811053285376 2017-10-07 03:56:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @moneymenmeals Yeah I dont want to share I just want to reserve the right to date whomever I want.
916873609133547520 2017-10-07 03:51:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> Question: is the MLP movie going to be good? Because I was invited to it tonight. (I said no, cuz Im busy isolating myself)
916810500318445568 2017-10-07 23:40:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @smhbrb I am sure karma paid him back.
916723917108125696 2017-10-07 17:56:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Exactly. Gotta time it perfectly!! Then I can get on with the Saturday agenda of total relaxation.
916723438860906496 2017-10-07 17:54:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Im sitting here drinking coffee and contemplating a nap. I will join you in the texting
916713000639197184 2017-10-07 17:13:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap Oh crumb. I conveniently forgot the whole thing. Thats ok, there is still lots of murder I can do.
916700948461903872 2017-10-07 16:25:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> If we now get to live by our religion, Im gonna go wild with the eye for an eye thing.
916691994792955904 2017-10-07 15:49:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Because I am a Christian I hereby refuse to interact with anyone taking away the rights of others.  Racists, GOP,  99% of men
916689721455079424 2017-10-07 15:40:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @smhbrb He also refused to recommend me for a college scholarship because I should stay home , support my husband and volunteer in my church
916517696417685504 2017-10-06 04:17:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes. Usually the arc of justice is much more slow.
916517576523448320 2017-10-06 04:16:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> At least he is older than the teen he killed for carrying skittles.
916516494959304704 2017-10-06 04:12:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Lin_Manuel @emigre80 Im ready to start this campaign!!
916515316322123777 2017-10-06 04:07:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Lin_Manuel @emigre80 Exactly. And the best part is we would learn about history and geopolitics!!
916514820765097984 2017-10-06 04:05:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> What if @Lin_Manuel was president? We would have music and arts and caring and love and intelligence.
916513779512254464 2017-10-06 04:01:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @tokidokizenzen maybe its coming...https://twitter.com/nbcla/status/916508145043853312
916512362135355393 2017-10-06 03:55:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just weep for us most days. The world suck so much right now
916511864309170176 2017-10-06 03:53:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are a fucking genius.
916509323538309121 2017-10-06 03:43:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> 19. Christian Boss asked us to have a wet t shirt contest at work.https://twitter.com/annetdonahue/status/916013055107928064
916508948491935745 2017-10-06 03:42:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Right? It goes everywhere.
916508219601592321 2017-10-06 03:39:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well I dont get out to the valley much thank dog.
916507592733499397 2017-10-06 03:36:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Real blood sucking vampires? Or the ones that suck your soul.
916507446180380672 2017-10-06 03:36:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> Tomorrow I get to sleep in with a clear mind and easy conscience. I really hope we dont get bombed.
916507022937415681 2017-10-06 03:34:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh really? Wow. That explains a lot.
916505778600550400 2017-10-06 03:29:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> There is only ONE hellmouth in California. #sunnydale. Gosh.
916497454253588480 2017-10-06 02:56:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane This is true. To handle the news of the day I have to start drinking early and often!!
916496423247425536 2017-10-06 02:52:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> I live in California. That word does not exist here.
916495812342947841 2017-10-06 02:50:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> So you will use rein in all places? At least it makes sense!!
916495252847869952 2017-10-06 02:47:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> YES. Omg. Please learn rein from reign and WHY one is used over the other.
916494964720144384 2017-10-06 02:46:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin In all seriousness, eyeliner on men is kinda hot in a goth way.
916494751846694912 2017-10-06 02:45:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin A little eyeliner can do you wonders honey...
916494387147718656 2017-10-06 02:44:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> I was drinking wine and switched to vodka. The night feels very very good
916494223876091905 2017-10-06 02:43:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> As an HR person I have given many a talk about sexual harassment and I have never met a woman/girl who has not been harassed at work.
916493916794363904 2017-10-06 02:42:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> Its terrible and I see it FAIRLY OFTEN
916493731414474753 2017-10-06 02:41:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> Gotta at least be respectful of what people want right?
916493303553470464 2017-10-06 02:40:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well, I would definitely accede to whatever the people felt was best for themselves.
916492685417922562 2017-10-06 02:37:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also to the MANNER born. Or BORNE. AUGGGGGHHHH
916492508242239488 2017-10-06 02:36:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hmmm. I need to think about how I feel about that. Because you are singling out NB
916492189080854528 2017-10-06 02:35:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Plus seventy BAZILLION for using that correctly. Omg I just read a book and it was here, here.
916491606705946624 2017-10-06 02:33:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ooh was that your word you thought you made up? Its a good one!!
916491437847453696 2017-10-06 02:32:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also, contentment is maturity. Acceptance. And zen. I dont have that but I so strive for it.
916491238265602049 2017-10-06 02:31:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just read an article today that was using Latinx for all. It flowed ok. I understand the uncomfortableness though
916491099488653313 2017-10-06 02:31:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Yeah those kind of people need to look at themselves. Contentment and peace start from within.
916490918537998336 2017-10-06 02:30:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Peace and absence of conflict is such a huge thing. I am so so so so much more content.
916490791605878787 2017-10-06 02:30:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also, I so very often flash upon the fact I am a little more poor than I was, living in a very small apartment and SO MUCH MORE CONTENT.
916490594079272960 2017-10-06 02:29:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Peace. I always think about peace which I think is contentment. Happiness is great, but fleeting. Peace and contentment...forever. I think.
916490372896788481 2017-10-06 02:28:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think so
916490332287541248 2017-10-06 02:28:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis ALONE....!!!!!
916490183175835648 2017-10-06 02:27:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Wellllll...some people are having aneurisms about things like our birth control and rights being taken away.
916489841986101248 2017-10-06 02:26:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh gosh. This. This.https://twitter.com/maryamhasnaa/status/916489218280452096

916461815483179008 2017-10-06 00:34:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> I will. But you are already like 5th On the list. Hopefully it is a pregnant female....
916460292099293184 2017-10-06 00:28:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Lololol
916459818138734592 2017-10-06 00:27:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well...I will accept that answer.
916458793768071168 2017-10-06 00:22:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> That author is putting on pretentions.
916455454040932352 2017-10-06 00:09:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> They used to...Ive read Agatha Christie books that used that.
916452788112023552 2017-10-06 23:59:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> Where can I get a cat that will take care of problems like this?https://twitter.com/vincentvangato/status/916390906156085248
916445783875919873 2017-10-06 23:31:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Hmm. Youll have to record something for us all. And Im sure you are fine.
916444768330059776 2017-10-06 23:27:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Are you gonna tell us your insecurity?
916444535290335232 2017-10-06 23:26:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ Trying to get the bf to move that way but every time we are up there its rainy and cold lolol

916441344784003072 2017-10-06 23:13:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ There are no sand dollars on the LA beaches
916439683361521665 2017-10-06 23:07:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ Oh my gosh!! How adorable!!

916353331638890496 2017-10-06 17:23:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> Blade Runner 2049 was pretty amazing even though I havent seen the original or any of the interim shorts
916352944697630720 2017-10-06 17:22:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Why does so much of America hate women?

915233053793910784 2017-10-03 15:12:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing This was the greatest disappointment of my childhood.
915230549186195458 2017-10-03 15:02:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Lol best spoiler everhttps://twitter.com/mountainbetween/status/915054622766546944
915018369081806849 2017-10-02 00:59:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ Oh I will. No matter what the book is about there will be chickens on the cover. Maybe giant chickens
915013766667833344 2017-10-02 00:40:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ Ok. These last two books you posted give me faith I can get published.

914925113149079553 2017-10-02 18:48:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 YESSSSSSSS

914739777131364353 2017-10-01 06:32:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dramamusic2 It was AMAZING. It was different actors than on broadway (Im in LA). But it was still amazing, moving, funny...better than the soundtrack.
914696293192105989 2017-10-01 03:39:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> So Im at Hamilton (its intermission) and I cannot but compare the leaders of the revolution to the coward that is the president now
914349533450035200 2017-09-30 04:41:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Evan_McMullin So start doing so please. PLEASE.
914338514359140353 2017-09-30 03:57:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @tycoonsgp Maybe we do stuff for ourselves and not to get a man.
914187230721196032 2017-09-30 17:56:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I am so full of despair. Why isnt someone doing something?
914186749911343104 2017-09-30 17:54:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> So our president shamed himself again.
914175597579952128 2017-09-30 17:10:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> I thought the headline was a parody. Who could sink so low?
914174220929687553 2017-09-30 17:04:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin *California.
914173962333995008 2017-09-30 17:03:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yay!!

913571190827999237 2017-09-28 01:08:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> Even if I don't write a novel, what if I write a story a day? An article a day?
913571090722467840 2017-09-28 01:08:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm kinda excited to think about it.
913570785075249153 2017-09-28 01:07:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> That is true. Are you gonna do it?
913570291028082688 2017-09-28 01:05:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> But I also need to craft a life where I am not working 9-5
913570229220917248 2017-09-28 01:04:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm scared

912847448057380864 2017-09-26 01:12:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Wait wait wait. That isn't from anyone associated with the show is it?
912823029801000960 2017-09-26 23:35:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> My only hope is that some Rachel somewhere is having a really good life.
912822887068794881 2017-09-26 23:35:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> is fast approaching a point of no return...and on and on...and on...it feels like we are living in that horrible parallel universe.
912822602980237312 2017-09-26 23:34:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> Our government cares nothing for our citizens devastated by hurricanes, that our president is truly an evil man, that the climate
912822279066619909 2017-09-26 23:32:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> Because with the news today saying an EMP could kill 90% of Americans within a year, that California is preparing for nuclear war, that
912822080550297600 2017-09-26 23:31:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> But in these parallel universes, the thing that convinced them is that the world was SO EFFING HOPELESS. You see what I am getting at, right
912821881199194112 2017-09-26 23:31:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> In The Wish, Giles eventually believed Cordelia that their universe is not the "right" one. I'm Stargate I think it was Samantha.
912821483906273280 2017-09-26 23:29:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> Y'all that have watched sci fi know that there is a tried and true formula of parallel universes. Buffy (the wish) and stargate come to mind
912816176924835840 2017-09-26 23:08:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CaptMurica I actually laughed out loud you dork :)
912815833922994177 2017-09-26 23:07:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CaptMurica Dating is lame!! Maybe she was spooked by your literacy
912814460250632192 2017-09-26 23:01:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CaptMurica Didja write back with "let's fuck?"  I've gotten that quite a bit.
912813893742759936 2017-09-26 22:59:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 It's the truth though.
912811503014707200 2017-09-26 22:49:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen I think they only watch Fox.
912808797038510080 2017-09-26 22:39:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> Gotta agree that I'd rather have the bots taken away from twitter than given more characters. @jack
912808029048811520 2017-09-26 22:36:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen I did. I try not to use that but I just couldn't deal with the "my family is all cops and there are no racist cops"
912806155025399809 2017-09-26 22:28:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Pulled out the "my friend is a former LA cop" card while arguing about racism today. Ugh.
912778725606883328 2017-09-26 20:39:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> God I'm so ashamed of this country. I guess NK bombing us will take care of a lot of things.
912774741320015872 2017-09-26 20:23:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing @crosberg That picture is EVERYTHING
912774147381407744 2017-09-26 20:21:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> OMFG I'm being run over by racists on Facebook.
912753017421565952 2017-09-26 18:57:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BreneBrown @philthethrill Sooo.. any ideas of what you are gonna do? My mom protests every weekend. She is amazing and I will be happy to bail her out when needed :)
912704749425664000 2017-09-26 15:45:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BreneBrown @philthethrill Aauuuughhhh!!!
912703000715464704 2017-09-26 15:38:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Well if you had submitted properly you would still be married. Ugh. I hate that shit. I can't even.
912702727272009728 2017-09-26 15:37:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill You got to hear @BreneBrown speak?! I'm jelly!!
912570518120701952 2017-09-25 06:52:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> Gawd DJT is stupid. The issue of kneeling has everything to do with race. How do I know? The guy that started it told me so. @Kaepernick7
912562051477680128 2017-09-25 06:18:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> They will need to sage and salt the WH after this shithole family finally leaves.
912559732358967296 2017-09-25 06:09:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> "Have you no decency?" No. He does not.
912559311389204481 2017-09-25 06:07:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut That is odd.
912555557487124480 2017-09-25 05:52:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I've done that. It gets boring. Feel free to clog our TL. We you and support you.
912554398252916736 2017-09-25 05:48:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> My very young trophy bf is not worried about being black in America. I worry for him.
912551360335192064 2017-09-25 05:36:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @JPCornelius @anthoknees Thank you for this whole thread. Xoxoxox
912545417912451072 2017-09-25 05:12:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> I drank the whole fucking giant glass of wine
912544022391955456 2017-09-25 05:07:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am utterly ashamed of our administration.
912541304369717248 2017-09-25 04:56:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 RIGHT??? I get Christian women sometimes who wanna show me how to be a good obedient wife. 
912540565618565121 2017-09-25 04:53:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Ok phew!! Then we can still go ahead with the devirginizing plan.
912540272428425216 2017-09-25 04:52:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Wait. I'm food? Is there something about you we don't know?
912537428874764288 2017-09-25 04:40:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm re-reading books right now. New books are too scary for me at the moment
912535923685916672 2017-09-25 04:34:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages @PaganVixen YES!!!
912533298852671493 2017-09-25 04:24:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys I have kinda given up on Facebook. It is full of asshole racists who I am socially acquainted with and it fills me with dread.
912532938184564736 2017-09-25 04:23:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> And I have to go to the store tomorrow and I need to buy more wine
912532398075559936 2017-09-25 04:20:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> I didn't want this big of a glass but I can't waste it.
912532030616768514 2017-09-25 04:19:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Like I wanted a glass of wine but the bottle felt almost empty so I just kept pouring and pouring
912531822768144385 2017-09-25 04:18:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> PRETTY MUCH YES https://twitter.com/tokidokizenzen/status/912531720037048320

912530765484662784 2017-09-25 04:14:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> I poured a giant glass of wine.

912524792216956933 2017-09-25 03:50:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill @manicsocratic The flaw is that only one load can be clean at a time.
912472061884297216 2017-09-25 00:21:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Oh fuck that shit. Someone suggests that to me and they get punched.
912414728470773760 2017-09-25 20:33:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SteveKopack @Mikes_Brother The Russian bots say lots of nice things about him
912411363644866563 2017-09-25 20:19:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SteveKopack @Mikes_Brother I honestly wonder if he knows.
912407621088329728 2017-09-25 20:05:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Thisssss....I just can't imagine Trump ignoring a white state....https://twitter.com/irisrimon/status/912407149921406976

912194226623995904 2017-09-24 05:57:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Trade the carrots for grapes and I'm in
912193792395980801 2017-09-24 05:55:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Virgins don't do sex well...I think you should be bidding for me to take your virginity...cuz I do sex WELL.
912193454175797248 2017-09-24 05:54:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> Fuck I'm gonna have to unfriend another racist midwesterner. Ugh.
912158608862846977 2017-09-24 03:35:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just really fucking love wine
912118104817262592 2017-09-24 00:54:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> I don't think it was related but I'm gonna pretend it was.
912117409892282368 2017-09-24 00:51:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> Tell me that certain people like me (black guys cuz I have a big butt) and fussing about kneeling football players.
912115661630926850 2017-09-24 00:44:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> The when you figure out your soon to be sister in law is racist and then your brother breaks up with her. 
912106069438087168 2017-09-24 00:06:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vexedmuddler Bless you!
912076935957643264 2017-09-24 22:11:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @davekellett Thank dog for that right? Gotta have some compensation for time travel.
912076096631300096 2017-09-24 22:07:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Does anyone else feel it is up to us private citizens to help PR because our government isn't? My heart breaks for PR
912069851274870785 2017-09-24 21:42:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @blazedd0nut I love pineapple. I knew there was a reason I love you!!!
912069013634670592 2017-09-24 21:39:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> This president is going to kill us all
911780654433443840 2017-09-23 02:33:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> Another chilly 65 degree night in SoCal. I'm cozy inside though with my hot chocolate.
911780211556982784 2017-09-23 02:31:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @tokidokizenzenhttps://twitter.com/piersatpenn/status/911779743644749824
911714492739870720 2017-09-23 22:10:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen Yup. Exactly. And I don't mind waiting for people to ride. I just get upset when they try to force me to ride.
911624138350981120 2017-09-23 16:11:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> We went to Jamaica! It was fun. And the spider crawled away on the plane. I think he got cold feet!!!!
911474413169606657 2017-09-22 06:16:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am so jet lagged still 
911467283951738880 2017-09-22 05:48:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> #IStandWithKap
911466845655334912 2017-09-22 05:46:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ummmm...new pet peeve. People who try to force you onto super scary rides when you just ate.
911445109115195392 2017-09-22 04:20:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mikemchargue The privilege  of calling  65 degrees cold is why I moved here! Love it!!!
911443546992893953 2017-09-22 04:14:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> I fuckin love California.
911443487370833923 2017-09-22 04:13:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also I am so spoiled. It's 65 degrees and I'm freezing
911442269525307394 2017-09-22 04:09:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also magic mountain smells like weed.
911441328860389376 2017-09-22 04:05:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just FYI, I'm at magic mountain. Why didn't you fuckers tell me it was all upside down roller coaster rides? 
911435237464219654 2017-09-22 03:41:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm gonna have to find my bible and look that up!!
911414105667334144 2017-09-22 02:17:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh really? I just don't remember it. Cool thanks!!
911407097949982721 2017-09-22 01:49:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys, am I right in stating that the catholic bible doesn't have Revelations?
911397455551279104 2017-09-22 01:11:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> I fucking hate this administration.
911395876362317824 2017-09-22 01:04:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Yeah I'm gonna pass. Don't wanna watch the wife beater in any movies.
911250452754317312 2017-09-22 15:26:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Dotard.
911250027284070400 2017-09-22 15:25:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Sure they do. Santa brings gifts 
911088934808993792 2017-09-21 04:45:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> We adopted my handicapped sister at birth. 4 surgeries later plus physical therapy and she was healthy. Health care saved her
911051800140115968 2017-09-21 02:17:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 So ironic....
911046225952096256 2017-09-21 01:55:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Thank you. Me too. 
911045969713651712 2017-09-21 01:54:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I'm having a tough day. I guess this thread is the positive thing in my day.
910724627340627968 2017-09-20 04:37:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> I drive very little these days but I don't mind subsidizing roads.
910653781955751941 2017-09-20 23:55:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Spider update: as we were boarding the plane the spider crawled out of backpack...but it was too late we were on the plane!!
910652084957179905 2017-09-20 23:49:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> I hope he or she makes it big!!
910651938731171846 2017-09-20 23:48:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @fijiwriter Yeah but the poor wife is home with a billion kids now and she is pissed
910651810112778240 2017-09-20 23:48:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @fijiwriter What if he is lonely????
910651494881546245 2017-09-20 23:46:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @fijiwriter What if his wife is like "what happened to you?"
910650054515527680 2017-09-20 23:41:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> Maybe the spider wants to come to LA.
910649879743090688 2017-09-20 23:40:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just saw a tiny spider crawl into my carry on bag. Now I am sad imagining this spider crawling out in LA and being upset.
910639955818532864 2017-09-20 23:00:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> YESSSSS
909324915861540865 2017-09-17 07:55:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Pfredp Well. Men are already animals without women, right?

909189090339426304 2017-09-16 22:55:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ayetunes Yes if they have to be alone they need to be properly secured as to not get into trouble
909188319057186817 2017-09-16 22:52:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> The world would be a better place if unattended men were not allowed.
909188197573386240 2017-09-16 22:52:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> Moms, wives, and sisters-we need to attend our men. They haven't been doing a good job of attending to themselves. #rapeculture #sexism
909187918006235136 2017-09-16 22:51:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> At a resort and there are many areas with signs that read "unattended men not allowed". And this is my new life mantra.

907808818955878400 2017-09-12 03:31:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> The only iPhone feature I really want is for them to take "ducking" out of the dictionary.

906739597136162818 2017-09-09 04:42:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Rogue One was good
906739441254805504 2017-09-09 04:41:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ooh yes
906739392282112000 2017-09-09 04:41:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @yrfatfriend Oh my gosh. Those are so horrible. I am so sorry
906738750767603713 2017-09-09 04:38:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> I enjoy the new movies but I am so upset they fucked with the timeline.
906738648690835457 2017-09-09 04:38:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> True. I forgot!
906738042794209280 2017-09-09 04:36:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yeah they would be like "wtf old lady?"
906737828767219712 2017-09-09 04:35:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh god right?! Like Wash or something!!
906737755140497408 2017-09-09 04:35:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> This just makes me so happyhttps://twitter.com/neeratanden/status/906502503554011136
906737375815942144 2017-09-09 04:33:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm guessing they wouldn't even get it. Which is even worse.
906736639195594753 2017-09-09 04:30:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> I didn't catch which guy. I just wanna yell "Han shot first!" at them
906736505330081792 2017-09-09 04:30:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @anne_theriault Omg you too?!  I guess those words are magic.
906735835633954816 2017-09-09 04:27:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> My neighbors are arguing whether "that actor guy" is from Star Trek or Star Wars and I'm so embarrassed for them.
906687436700360705 2017-09-09 01:15:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> I truly don't know what kind of cognitive dissonance they must have in order to justify this shit. They seem soulless and heartless.
906686716731199488 2017-09-09 01:12:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> God justifies it.
906685912842567680 2017-09-09 01:09:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> I want to be the female equivalent of him.https://twitter.com/politikmasfina/status/906684640177606656
906684982160105472 2017-09-09 01:05:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis I keep granola bars around for that exact reason.
906684867303301123 2017-09-09 01:04:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Because they are hypocrites
906656226364186624 2017-09-09 23:11:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wow. That's something to think about
906652218903773184 2017-09-09 22:55:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Dunno if I've seen it. *ducks*
906651960144568320 2017-09-09 22:54:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Is this the spice must flow Dune?
906642207343468544 2017-09-09 22:15:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm ok with Taylor taking the victim stance of "Look What You Made Me Do". I've heard that shit from many a man w/no one objecting.
906639390167908352 2017-09-09 22:04:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages Not you, L'Otter!
906616065932660736 2017-09-09 20:31:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Swear to god some people are really freaking touchy
906381253103968256 2017-09-08 04:58:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat snoring is so super adorable
906359178448351234 2017-09-08 03:30:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages We are soulmates
906355987665231872 2017-09-08 03:18:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am in bed, snuggled up and ready to sleep. Guys, the line is on the left.
906258361863200768 2017-09-08 20:50:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @LokiLoptr Omg what a dumbshit
906174398578569216 2017-09-08 15:16:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Men. Fucking assholes.
906172681900269568 2017-09-08 15:09:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 "Sure!! Yes!! Come on over!!" 
906172401934786560 2017-09-08 15:08:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages All my speeches are gonna start: good morning everyotter
906020081091600384 2017-09-07 05:03:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @tokidokizenzen And I was just texting with a group of trans girls and said "hey guys we gotta do...". Ugh.
906018119180619776 2017-09-07 04:55:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mizellw Yes but that graph looked VERY official
906012526676029444 2017-09-07 04:33:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages I keep thinking about everyotter and it keeps making me giggle.
906011305982566400 2017-09-07 04:28:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> So really, we all just RT into a cloud of people that agree with us.https://twitter.com/g_s_bhogal/status/905487144160038912
905999721222643712 2017-09-07 03:42:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> For a moment I lost my wine corker and I thought I was gonna get to drink the entire bottle
905996743006797824 2017-09-07 03:30:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Yay!!! 
905996577306681344 2017-09-07 03:29:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I don't have kids though and I hear you wanna be an instant daddy.
905996333281976321 2017-09-07 03:28:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Oh!! I'm older...
905996123877212160 2017-09-07 03:28:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Maybe she's still growin up
905992267118153728 2017-09-07 03:12:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @cameronesposito New hair, piercings in weird places, and lots of comfort food.
905991839676735488 2017-09-07 03:11:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Yes. This is very true.
905991747892690944 2017-09-07 03:10:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> Fucking DJT just appoints total idiots, dipshits, assholes, racists and general pieces of shit to positions of power.
905990653951086592 2017-09-07 03:06:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Saw a white southern dude use the n-word on FB today when referring to an inanimate object and I just fucking hate people.
905971613836836864 2017-09-07 01:50:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages EVERYCAT checking in here!!
905971272554647553 2017-09-07 01:49:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> Incorrect species identification seems somehow worse than mis-gendering.
905968904240898049 2017-09-07 01:39:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hmmmm @tokidokizenzenhttps://twitter.com/iowbooks/status/905967816083374080
905968137211854848 2017-09-07 01:36:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes we do. Unless you are from the south, then you use y'all
905925870560223232 2017-09-07 22:48:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill do you watch Portlandia?
905709308620320768 2017-09-07 08:28:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta Wow @delta. I'm ashamed of you.https://twitter.com/the_unsilent_/status/905686407875883008
905681914576617473 2017-09-06 06:39:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> LA is amazing and wonderful. And I think I'm done here.
905681271296163840 2017-09-06 06:36:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm thinking of moving. If you could live anywhere in the US, where would you live and why?
905680156144033792 2017-09-06 06:32:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @manicsocratic Hmm. Now that you mention it, I think you are right!!
905679855039197184 2017-09-06 06:31:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> Is there a job I can get where I can stay home and be surrounded by my cats and my books?
905577692426256384 2017-09-06 23:45:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis @pjeisenberg Me too!!! Good to know I'm not the only one
905458434203557888 2017-09-06 15:51:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis Every cheese
905197650126954496 2017-09-05 22:35:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mckellogs @sarameghansen I had resources and privilege. I was very lucky that way. Many don't  and I understand why people stay.
905112894844452864 2017-09-05 16:58:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis My mom is staying inside but my nephews have mild asthma and it must be bad for them. This is super awful. Xoxo.
905107546452639744 2017-09-05 16:37:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis Ugh. That sounds miserable.
905105474457964544 2017-09-05 16:28:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis My mom is in Vancouver WA and has the same thing.
904889936993689601 2017-09-04 02:12:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mckellogs I am so proud I left my abusive husband, got a divorce and am across the country now.
904841903019102219 2017-09-04 23:01:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @blazedd0nut Well! That is a LIST! I'm excited to watch some of these!!
904820421819736064 2017-09-04 21:36:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Like you'll be so sore and pissed maybe it will help make the first couple weeks go faster?
904820308724506624 2017-09-04 21:35:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I think it will be extremely hard, but I wonder if you do pop (the correct name), smoking and exercise all at once, if the misery will help.
904794880458633216 2017-09-04 19:54:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Woot!!
904781962950303744 2017-09-04 19:03:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> One cat is bored of the videos. One cat looked behind the tv for the birds and the third is just staring, mesmerized. #birdvideosforcats
904781351890456576 2017-09-04 19:00:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap Yep. It looks like they've stopped evacuating people for right now. Hopefully the cooler weather and the little bit of rain we got helps
904769344474824706 2017-09-04 18:13:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> I need to get a bird feeder to attract more birds to my balcony.
904769121048444933 2017-09-04 18:12:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Look how intently she is watching the birds in the screen.pic.twitter.com/Oxt8CcGcYc
904768877074071552 2017-09-04 18:11:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Putting on YouTube videos of birds for my cats has made them so happy.
904758284787138560 2017-09-04 17:29:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 It's totally ok.
904758243100057600 2017-09-04 17:29:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Nope. You just aren't ready to quit.
904754985417687040 2017-09-04 17:16:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Oh yeah? Exercising and quitting at the same time? You are a monster!!
904754431484321792 2017-09-04 17:14:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> These people are supposedly in the minority? Yet bad shit is happening everywhere.
904754179209543680 2017-09-04 17:13:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> If those who disapprove of DJT are in the majority, why are the bad things happening so much more? The racial incidents, Nazis, etc.
904605246550269952 2017-09-04 07:21:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat and I are watching bird videos and I feel MUCH BETTER
904577073456357376 2017-09-03 05:29:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> I was gonna go to be early. Instead I got scared and pissed and ranted on twitter. Yay?
904576825539432449 2017-09-03 05:28:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut I have a present for your birthday!! I will send it this week. It's a little piece of the UP.
904576679141507072 2017-09-03 05:27:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut I showed Paul that it's your fb background pic and he is just laughing.
904576299485630464 2017-09-03 05:26:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut Well you need to if you are gonna own the Hurley Hotel. I guess I'm mostly upset because they hide it so well.
904575486705098753 2017-09-03 05:22:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut Yah. I just...I will miss her and I feel shitty about that too.
904573553588109313 2017-09-03 05:15:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Done :)
904571869138886656 2017-09-03 05:08:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm just fucking pissed. Sorry to tweetstorm everything. I guess I'll go work on my evacuation bag and order iodine pills.
904571662636421121 2017-09-03 05:07:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I could tell you stories of kindness and compassion and also cruelty. Small towns and the Midwest is not some kind of fucking magical place
904571341575036928 2017-09-03 05:06:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> The tow company owner had SEVEN YES SEVEN DUIs and he lost his license. But he drove. We just all winked.
904571097512689664 2017-09-03 05:05:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> We had little crime in the small town...but a whole shit ton of domestic violence and DUI's.
904570921821773824 2017-09-03 05:04:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> One year the priest dressed as a homeless man on CHRISTMAS EVE and sat on the church steps. The good midwesterners called the cops.
904570756478115840 2017-09-03 05:04:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> FUCK the 'Midwest real american' story. I am a goddamn transplant from the "real" USA and they are RACIST ASSHOLES.
904570454949498880 2017-09-03 05:02:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> All I know is now that I am in LA I have lots of POC friends and  lots of LGBTQI friends and their fear is heartbreaking.
904570008444928000 2017-09-03 05:01:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> 4. Maybe I should have kept her as a friend "hold your enemies closer.."  My aa BF does-he says he wants to see the racists coming.
904569468881313794 2017-09-03 04:59:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> We used to play poker and one of the games was "Gary Colman". You needed a spade to win...we changed the game upon my request- but GAWD.
904569158607618049 2017-09-03 04:57:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> However 3. I cannot be that white woman who does not stand strong. Who lets racism happen. I am ashamed of some of the things I've let go.
904568910195769344 2017-09-03 04:56:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> But what if I was wrong? I've known her 15 years and I love her dearly.
904568754624794624 2017-09-03 04:56:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> Because she asked me what news I watched, I assumed she is already too deep into the "fake news" narrative & couldn't change.
904568493051322369 2017-09-03 04:55:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> That's not important tho.  2. I wonder if I should have tried to talk to her-engage a little more about her misinformed ideas.
904568272602857472 2017-09-03 04:54:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> He used to comment on my FB posts EVEN THOUGH HE DOESNT HAVE FACEBOOK. He would text me his comments. So he will find out.
904568077106372609 2017-09-03 04:53:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> 1. This woman is my ex husbands nurse (he's an MD). So he is gonna find out. It's a town of 1800.
904567788274032640 2017-09-03 04:52:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> And she said she still love loves him anyway. So I unfriended and blocked her. And I have so many feelings about it & im gonna vent them.
904567605670756352 2017-09-03 04:51:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> She asked me what channel I saw that on. I said I saw it on the White House website since I don't watch Fox News.
904567438037065728 2017-09-03 04:50:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> And I said he isn't going to give that right now, the WH announced that they aren't sure of the details.
904567330679558144 2017-09-03 04:50:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> The other day a FB friend told me she loved DJT for his million dollar donation.
904567185036632064 2017-09-03 04:49:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> See...no more iPhone  (ok maybe I'm exaggerating but gawd I'm just pissed)https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/904322640654897152
904566604272345088 2017-09-03 04:47:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> I guess I need to go to D.C.  I need to do SOMETHING besides call my MoC.https://twitter.com/beauwillimon/status/904534469713031169
904566197009526784 2017-09-03 04:46:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I'm ashamed. And I'm also fucking scared. I'm scared of war and I'm scared that people I know are being hurt.

904565357637115905 2017-09-03 04:42:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Watching a show we couldn't laugh loud unless my dad laughed. I learned to laugh inside.https://twitter.com/poetickate/status/904473465238937601
904563585250074624 2017-09-03 04:35:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> Fucking dying and it is not ok.
904563532896677888 2017-09-03 04:35:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> Omg I hate this shit. If we are in the majority why can't we effect change??? I know--gerrymandering, bots, EMAILS. But FUCK people are ....
904563135469633536 2017-09-03 04:33:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @emigre80 You are so right!! My ex has supplied me with YT videos of how I am wrong, I'm happy to share if you want 
904562550540443649 2017-09-03 04:31:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @emigre80 We can only vote for her because we are libtards, feminazi's in lockstep, and also low information voters.
904562073119612928 2017-09-03 04:29:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> So now I am going to listen to scary Charles Manson podcasts and watch Twin Peaks. Hmm. I may need a volunteer to come snuggle with me.
904561726011523072 2017-09-03 04:28:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 To end my mini thread....fuuuuuuucccckkkkk
904561544914100224 2017-09-03 04:27:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I know a guy who hates California because of the doggy birthday parties. That's one of the reasons I love it here.
904561368644194304 2017-09-03 04:26:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 And let me tell you, if California is fucked, the rest of the country won't be happy either. California, like it or not, leads the way.
904561158723584000 2017-09-03 04:26:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Besides the fact that DJT is trying to oust immigrants who run the economy. California will be fucked, our tech industry, just everything
904560675246051329 2017-09-03 04:24:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Since I am in California where NK might feel like tossing a bomb or two, I definitely agree with this sentiment.
904560535936446464 2017-09-03 04:23:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> So my friend @ButtyHolly1 told me:   "I just wish the GOP would put the safety of the citizens over the fear of not getting re-elected"
904560103474454528 2017-09-03 04:21:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> What?? He truly said he was gonna end DACA? What a piece of shit. I know someone who will be deported. She's lived here her entire lifehttps://twitter.com/brhodes/status/904525416769220612
904559844002152448 2017-09-03 04:20:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Do I need to start at the very beginning?
904559792173203460 2017-09-03 04:20:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Hmm. Some tough choices there.
904559427470057472 2017-09-03 04:19:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Scared to be alone.
904559087521693696 2017-09-03 04:17:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill So I get the feeling I should watch this series.
904534547915608064 2017-09-03 02:40:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap I am far from the fires, I hope I don't need to evacuate.
904533675122888704 2017-09-03 02:36:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap I think I'm good then. Full tank, go- bag for cats, I've got emergency cash.
904533384747073537 2017-09-03 02:35:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 NOPE. I like them!!
904533223182450689 2017-09-03 02:35:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap I don't know what to do for an evacuation. Pick up my cats and go I guess?
904533144841273344 2017-09-03 02:34:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap Well yes I have an earthquake kit and such. But the FD is talking about in the next couple days cuz of the fires here.
904476238923759616 2017-09-03 22:48:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> The fire department says that everyone in LA needs an evacuation plan.
904423942873432065 2017-09-03 19:20:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> I kinda am thinking I don't need to buy anything new for clothes any more. There is so much good stuff here so cheap.
904423407214723072 2017-09-03 19:18:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> He looks so sharp!!
904422227709386752 2017-09-03 19:13:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Will you adopt me? 
904414440493219840 2017-09-03 18:43:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I love thrift shopping and LA has some awesome ones!!
904388566175715328 2017-09-03 17:00:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> Does anyone know if the pissed swimming cat is safe?
904375570934317057 2017-09-03 16:08:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> If you end up here we can go thrift shopping together! I was just thinking how fun that would be
904245525645373440 2017-09-03 07:31:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PushaTease Thank you for this!!
904245089043603462 2017-09-03 07:30:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Welllll, this guy killed his wife because she slapped him. So I'm a bit conflicted about his rights being violated.
904243902202339328 2017-09-03 07:25:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> Listening to "Dragnet" from 1949. They just oh so casually violate people's rights constantly.
904241601563656193 2017-09-03 07:16:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> Great. NK pushing our fucking crazy president.
904166317439074304 2017-09-02 02:17:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Also I dictate texts for him to send to my friends while I am driving and vice versa :)
904165933924597761 2017-09-02 02:15:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've been craving a cupcake or a donut for a week now. I need to go get one (or both) tomorrow!
904165661454123008 2017-09-02 02:14:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> My BF and I have each other's fingerprint on our phones. So if one of us dies the other can erase things as needed :)https://twitter.com/nellychillin/status/904164537913442304
904163097497133057 2017-09-02 02:04:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ The only sad thing about my post-divorce life is losing my space for books.
904160871265386496 2017-09-02 01:55:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_Luna1_ That sounds like HEAVEN
904159469671550976 2017-09-02 01:49:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Having popcorn and red wine for dinner. Feeling v Olivia Pope.
904141253813477376 2017-09-02 00:37:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's a really gorgeous photo. You did great!
904117813262016512 2017-09-02 23:04:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder And @SylvesterTurner, mayor of Houston. He is pretty awesome.
904115770254213120 2017-09-02 22:56:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> 3 plus one in the pic?
904050225400000512 2017-09-02 18:35:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill MBA and soon an MS in strategic management. I make shit. (Looking for a new job though)

904022937572843525 2017-09-02 16:47:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ZackBornstein I do not know if I've ever finished a pen. I feel oddly proud when I finish a dental floss. "Look at me, I flossed a whole lot!!"
903852199951794176 2017-09-01 05:28:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wine has made me feel a lot better about blocking my trump supporting friend.
903844351540789252 2017-09-01 04:57:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill Truly lol'ed. But I have had a buncha wine
903843417477623808 2017-09-01 04:53:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill Ok so when I wake up in the middle of the night screaming I will be tweeting you in all caps!!!
903843134156677120 2017-09-01 04:52:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill But the book Helter Skelter gave me nightmares as a kid. Am I old enough for the podcast?
903842738499575808 2017-09-01 04:51:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill I've been listening to stuff while I unpack lately. I put it on the list!!! :)
903842453500772354 2017-09-01 04:50:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill I knew about blacklisting but I didn't KNOW, ya know?
903842083563126784 2017-09-01 04:48:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Hmm. I am not seeing our relationship lasting long 
903841912330739712 2017-09-01 04:47:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RememberThisPod @philthethrill Prematurely anti fascist. I like that. It's going in the word bank.
903841381520629760 2017-09-01 04:45:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I think I would just yell anyway. :)
903841175630618624 2017-09-01 04:45:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis @sarah_fondelier Oh gosh. On the Beach gave me nightmares for a year. I forgot about that one!!!!
903839836330639361 2017-09-01 04:39:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well. Two here in California.
903838569235488770 2017-09-01 04:34:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing Yes, using them for reference is a good plan!! :)
903837230203944960 2017-09-01 04:29:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vandroidhelsing Read some PG Wodehouse to get in the right frame of mind
903832297551519745 2017-09-01 04:09:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @likethewolfe @paulidin Yep. Growing up in Washington we didn't have AC either but my mom does now cuz it gets to 100 on the reg.
903831694834143232 2017-09-01 04:07:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @likethewolfe @paulidin I was so surprised when I moved here and found out that so many places did not have AC.
903821069684924416 2017-09-01 03:25:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just blocked one of my older friends on FB for saying she loves Trump. I am sad.
903813605891596289 2017-09-01 02:55:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> To top off my lazy day, I am having oatmeal for dinner. #yum
903795342537318401 2017-09-01 01:42:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> Sounds great!  It's been hot and I've been so lazy.
903793134382964738 2017-09-01 01:34:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> So I'll be able to be more productive?
903791144667987968 2017-09-01 01:26:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Have had the LAZIEST two days.

903757381984714752 2017-09-01 23:12:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> DJT has to keep doing things over because he fucks them up the 1st time. Houston visit, ACA repeal attempt, C-ville talk, immigrant ban etc
903756549079699457 2017-09-01 23:08:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Mikes_Brother But generally only the south gets hit with hurricanes. So I don't understand at all. The pastor said!!
903751714364211201 2017-09-01 22:49:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> Funny how sexual perversion is only in the south??? https://twitter.com/tinyhandedman/status/903730641983770624

903660623505928192 2017-09-01 16:47:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair Do it
903660087356473345 2017-09-01 16:45:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis @SarahWritesEtc @bookslover I'm not a parent. And this book was way too advanced for me at 9. And I hope I would never do such a thing.
903653635237613568 2017-09-01 16:19:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @smaychel @Ioveglows @ambrotypes I had no idea about any of this. History rocks
903641531227160576 2017-09-01 15:31:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis @SarahWritesEtc @bookslover Really! It is still being passed around by kids? I'm so impressed. I read it at 9. Maybe I should talk to my 12 yr old niece.
903491938879287296 2017-08-31 05:37:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @anthoknees I'm making it. I'm living.  And I passed my class. Two more to go until graduation!

903432074110963712 2017-08-31 01:39:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis We had to watch the movie and read the book in school. That was THE WORST.
903390255448866816 2017-08-31 22:53:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis At 11 I asked to buy a Nancy Drew book & my mom thought it was too old for me, not knowing I had read all her inappropriate books already.
903376121730699264 2017-08-31 21:57:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'll believe it when I see it. He prolly means letting the SS stay for free in his hotels.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/903374871194939392

903373673305751552 2017-08-31 21:47:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder That's true.
903372632120205312 2017-08-31 21:43:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder And people need bug spray and sunscreen and the total basics. It's crazy
903372516126687232 2017-08-31 21:42:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Wow. Of course the people who help need stuff too and there is a shortage and yeah. This kind of stuff makes you think. Like TP?!
903371703929118720 2017-08-31 21:39:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder That is amazing. I had never though about that. The logistics of gas.
903371138599854080 2017-08-31 21:37:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Wow....
903346140644388864 2017-08-31 19:57:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> My brother, who lives near Dallas says multiple gas stations near him are closed because they are out of gas and can't get more.

903117930606411776 2017-08-30 04:51:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @meghantonjes I have no motivation to do anything. Except lie here and drink wine
903114150091530240 2017-08-30 04:36:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @RevJDubya I love that!! Might have to get it myself :)
903113871409332225 2017-08-30 04:35:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think the one prayer that might be listened to is "thank you". Or maybe "please hold this soul close to You".
903113537282727936 2017-08-30 04:33:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just was tagged in a prayer chain for Houston. If God exists, she is just watching us. I don't think prayers will help.
903080575090565121 2017-08-30 02:22:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> Passed my class. Phew. Two more to go. #onward!
903078553377320960 2017-08-30 02:14:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin SVU freaks me out I love it so much!!
903060372948566016 2017-08-30 01:02:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Travis_Waldron First time I saw The Natural I thought it was a true story. I love that movie :)
903059597098754048 2017-08-30 00:59:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Probably. It is really hard for me to get up when my cat lays on me.
903057421341310977 2017-08-30 00:50:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder I found your sleep problem #bees 
903056027238580225 2017-08-30 00:45:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder I do too. I stay up way too late.
903055641035411456 2017-08-30 00:43:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Sleep is so important. I am becoming a sleep miser.
903052574806257664 2017-08-30 00:31:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> @fyeahmfabello @blanquitayaneth Seriously. They need help.
903051941634129920 2017-08-30 00:28:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Yay you will sleep well!!
903045367003979777 2017-08-30 00:02:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @monicaisliberal What about delivery?
903041929482444801 2017-08-30 23:49:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> I bought beet juice for the name "vampire blend" and it was really good.
903022364228648960 2017-08-30 22:31:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @FeministaJones 7, 79, 39, 51
902994022607626241 2017-08-30 20:38:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane Ugh. But we are both free! I feel like I might be older but I am definitely more gorgeous and much more fun now. Moving forward, right?
902991851011022848 2017-08-30 20:30:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I definitely think about him less. But there were good times before he became controlling & abusive-it's an on going process of moving on
902991288332460033 2017-08-30 20:27:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mersipan It's heartbreaking.
902991172838162432 2017-08-30 20:27:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mizellw Do you have onewest out there? They don't charge
902990821711945733 2017-08-30 20:26:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today I was thinking of my ex husband and was so happy when I realized I don't ever need to talk to that abusive creep again.
902959278692040704 2017-08-30 18:20:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I couldn't do it. It made me gag thinking about it
902955188402585600 2017-08-30 18:04:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill wow I found it.pic.twitter.com/3xt334l7bC
902929695510978560 2017-08-30 16:23:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Ricochet @broomeman After watching a dog get rescued during the flooding I have my fill of sad pets for the week.
902929411795595264 2017-08-30 16:22:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> My TL filled with heartbreaking pics and I gave some $$ but still feel so helpless. Stupid hurricane.
902928878414438400 2017-08-30 16:19:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> BAG O MYSTERY   @tokidokizenzen sounds like something you would like (word wise, not food wise)https://twitter.com/haggardhawks/status/902630206330077184
902928304377696261 2017-08-30 16:17:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Ricochet @broomeman Nope. Looks like something that will make me cry.
902905365725036545 2017-08-30 14:46:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I think I do too.
902748949898985476 2017-08-29 04:24:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> So lazyhttps://twitter.com/brasilmagic/status/902742989595955207
902745848647487488 2017-08-29 04:12:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I think I just worry about it all.
902744469602050048 2017-08-29 04:07:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1  I read that as "a huge" and it changed the meaning. I didn't get it. Still don't.https://twitter.com/yenniwhite/status/898017316893536256
902742315285921793 2017-08-29 03:58:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I just don't see how the fries can be good.
902739392359407616 2017-08-29 03:46:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> That man did good.
902736926540668928 2017-08-29 03:37:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> Supposedly this is true...pic.twitter.com/ME2oY67mmu
902733640571822080 2017-08-29 03:24:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> That is smart. I really need to rethink my exposure to this stuff.
902728444651290624 2017-08-29 03:03:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @TGStoneButch You are the only one who will make it today!!!
902728168431271938 2017-08-29 03:02:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> @IniquitousFish Oh god that sounds exactly like my mirror.
902727687914962945 2017-08-29 03:00:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Right? A female cat a president?? It's gotta be the boy.
902727478044528640 2017-08-29 02:59:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @IniquitousFish Samesies. Can we have a secret handshake or something so we can recognize one another?
902726857103089665 2017-08-29 02:57:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are right. I need to think about it. My coping skills are taking a beating when every day is a new shit show.
902726378788855808 2017-08-29 02:55:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Pretty much the only reason I do anything is the hope I become v famous on tv.https://twitter.com/buzzfeednews/status/902583839335358464
902725339490566144 2017-08-29 02:51:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> Or even google a fact. Easier for those who don't do reading gud.https://twitter.com/vabvox/status/902723276836929537
902724878402326528 2017-08-29 02:49:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> That is smart. I waver at the edge of despair constantly and shit like this has a lot to do with it.
902724211906510848 2017-08-29 02:46:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> RIGHT?! The thing is I betcha anything my stupid aunt will post something like this on FB. I cannot wait.
902724026031783936 2017-08-29 02:45:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> Apparently Russian bots are trying to stir up more anti Obama feeling...
902723822851260416 2017-08-29 02:45:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> And this...pic.twitter.com/b5tyXjVvvQ
902723409418715136 2017-08-29 02:43:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well...this has been going aroundpic.twitter.com/u4DZ85W2ol
902722255825854466 2017-08-29 02:38:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> The replies are https://twitter.com/tonyposnanski/status/902638150681595904
902720875488731136 2017-08-29 02:33:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat could be a better president. The male one of course since we couldn't dare elect competent women.
902625229008076800 2017-08-29 20:13:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Ste_Collins My ex used to tell me car names are dumb so I have super awesome ridiculous car names now.
902621487730802688 2017-08-29 19:58:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Update: I have been more productive in the past few days than usual and I attribute it to #fancyplanners. :)
902616873509851138 2017-08-29 19:40:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis I'm battling with lube, yelling "I thought you were there"
902613123927949312 2017-08-29 19:25:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well that explains a lot.
902612357838278656 2017-08-29 19:22:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> I thought it was a puppy.
902403181488947200 2017-08-28 05:30:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> I like old radio programs. It's my favorite geek hobby.
902403057593364480 2017-08-28 05:30:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> They ended by saying our freedom is worth fighting for, it is worth voting for.
902402945441873920 2017-08-28 05:30:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> Then they did a PSA saying the Japanese and Germans are trying to take away our vote, so get out and vote.
902402204950175744 2017-08-28 05:27:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> Now the man is shamed into voting and he's picking up all his neighbors using his ration gas so they all can vote. #happyending
902401557865545728 2017-08-28 05:24:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> Now an immigrant is talking about how this is his first time voting as he got his citizenship papers 8 months ago and how excited he is
902401215518064640 2017-08-28 05:23:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> They are shaming him into voting.
902401096647286785 2017-08-28 05:22:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Listening to a radio program from the 1940's. The white guy doesn't vote cuz it's raining. The black maid and Asian laundry guy do.
902374336740311040 2017-08-28 03:36:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am super amazing!!! I put together the cart with only minimal help from @dadstronaut by text.
902365965962289152 2017-08-28 03:03:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> I do not know if I can put together this thing.
902322467091263488 2017-08-28 00:10:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @belleofva When I lived in Michigan a greenhouse was my dream. I miss having a big garden.
902322123733065728 2017-08-28 00:08:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I hung up my diplomas today and left space for one more :)

902317438984785920 2017-08-28 23:50:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @elonjames Two!!
902315397839339520 2017-08-28 23:42:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @belleofva Hmm I can try Amazon fresh. I need to buy a basil plant to go on my deck
902312829360816128 2017-08-28 23:31:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @belleofva I have fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and cannot find fresh basil anywhere right now. I've checked grocery stores and farmers mkts!!!

902276282104217601 2017-08-28 21:06:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've listened to Hamilton a dozens of times and I ugly cry at the same spots every single time.

901991744836780033 2017-08-27 02:16:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I used to have a sauna in my house when I was married. It would be awful.
901947149637763076 2017-08-27 23:18:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mizellw It's got a cat. I like cats. I bought it at a craft fair 20 years ago. Wow.
901945565646266368 2017-08-27 23:12:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> From now on I'm calling it "conservative fanfic". Lovehttps://twitter.com/owillis/status/901944824240144385

901944183409086464 2017-08-27 23:07:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @belleofva That is such a great philosophy. I tend to be a hoarder. I am working hard to break that!!!
901944048734179328 2017-08-27 23:06:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes!  Are you still planning to move here??

901943088855244801 2017-08-27 23:02:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> Not at the moment. Still considering my options. But it is self care to actually feel like my home is homey.
901942715771887616 2017-08-27 23:01:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> 25 months after moving to California, today I put up my first picture. #babysteps

901929459749601280 2017-08-27 22:08:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just woke up my cat by singing 'Sweet Child O Mine' to him. He is not amused.pic.twitter.com/5I7lvlC3ra

901865213892247552 2017-08-27 17:53:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> I bought flowers. Enjoy my chicken and a card from @tokidokizenzen too.pic.twitter.com/LszPrUNOQV
901863591690645504 2017-08-27 17:46:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yeah I had to borrow a sword to kill a very bad person. But it worked!!
901860030248402945 2017-08-27 17:32:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm trying but it doesn't seem as amazing in the writing.pic.twitter.com/BEKHBnBtvy
901857824459735040 2017-08-27 17:23:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> That sounds funny though. Yeah this dream was so adventurous. And I came up with a theory about swords that is already fading but was great!
901856244373356545 2017-08-27 17:17:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> What does it mean? I'm choosing to believe it means I am going to succeed even through all my doubts. To keep fighting
901856052437594112 2017-08-27 17:16:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> The dream started with me wanting to go to Hollywood and make sure the kkk hat was still on DJT's star.
901855800313839619 2017-08-27 17:15:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> I spoke the words for the exorcism and the demons left. I piloted the spaceship and began repairs.
901855566464663552 2017-08-27 17:14:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Even though I had doubts all my actions were successful. I chopped off the demons head. I borrowed a sword after mine proved cursed.
901855264671842304 2017-08-27 17:13:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I had an exciting dream. I was exorcising demons, protecting kids, killing evil, flying a spaceship, wielding a sword.

901660404975206400 2017-08-26 04:19:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I might 'accidentally' hand you my panties too.

901653072782299136 2017-08-26 03:50:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Townsend_S_W My gut says drink more wine!! 
901652760751247362 2017-08-26 03:49:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Townsend_S_W Someone said I should watch The Tick instead. Any opinion on that?

901647103822184448 2017-08-26 03:26:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> I was invited out tonight but I'm gonna stay home and watch Brooklyn 99 and drink wine. Maybe eat popcorn.
901639828483203073 2017-08-26 02:57:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Why can't life be like this? https://twitter.com/sarajbenincasa/status/901621946198224896

901549020379664385 2017-08-26 20:56:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Cute!!! Did it hurt?
901335905775919106 2017-08-25 06:50:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Mikes_Brother It's a perfect arrangement.
901335316690214912 2017-08-25 06:47:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Mikes_Brother It really doesn't take much to have a strong twitter relationship like ours.
901332480736632833 2017-08-25 06:36:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Some of you are my rocks. Thank you
901305401697685504 2017-08-25 04:48:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are amazing! We are both amazing!! 
901305162555314176 2017-08-25 04:47:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes. It is super sad. I now see what was hidden before.
901304624438628355 2017-08-25 04:45:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> This is exactly right. And I just start despairing and spiral.
901303747090931714 2017-08-25 04:42:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> I totally understand. I keep taking breaks and then being sucked back into the news. It is really hard on my heart.
901297927565393920 2017-08-25 04:19:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yeah but I missed you
901296666778648580 2017-08-25 04:14:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @erikaheidewald And her lips. And her muscles!!
901274764924211200 2017-08-25 02:47:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> The hits keep coming. It seems there is nothing that DJT can do that will cause GOP to act. How shameful.
901252941448855553 2017-08-25 01:20:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Of course not all men are trash but all of us have had men cat call and harass. When the good ones show themselves we appreciate them!!!
901250295937638400 2017-08-25 01:09:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ChickSpinster His name is Barney. He used to be my barn cat before I moved to California. He adjusted so well! He is amazing.
901247809369759745 2017-08-25 00:59:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ChickSpinster That must be it.
901246584519655424 2017-08-25 00:55:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ChickSpinster He is so cute he makes my heart hurt sometimes
901245066777210881 2017-08-25 00:49:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> Here is my cat sharing my pillow isn't he adorable?pic.twitter.com/LwpQPN6lxD
901243850374529024 2017-08-25 00:44:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> It keeps getting worse. Someone needs to do something. Fucking cowards run our country.
901179130762350592 2017-08-25 20:27:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> The house cleaners came and I also got my hair done. Today is 
901126225426432000 2017-08-25 16:56:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wait. Can Stephen King really block DJT from seeing IT? Because that is AWESOME.
901125327094661120 2017-08-25 16:53:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> Basically, I have a life written down on paper so there is no need to do anything. #fancyplanners
901125222354399234 2017-08-25 16:52:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> I spent hours last night planning things
901125178448412672 2017-08-25 16:52:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> I spent 94 dollars on fancy planners.
901116246325829632 2017-08-25 16:17:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Oh my god
900916661741469696 2017-08-24 03:04:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Foo fighterS
900916566107185154 2017-08-24 03:03:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin But. The Foo Fighter > both of them
900916444530999296 2017-08-24 03:03:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have learned from living in California that everything is a thing. So yeah I would think so.
900630513362190337 2017-08-24 08:07:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Um I started crying in the grocery store bc I miss my chickens so badly. (Had to leave my chickens when I left the ex)
900624283927322624 2017-08-24 07:42:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Hoorayforfoxes Well, donuts. I mean yeah.
900554326753411072 2017-08-23 03:04:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am so tired of this presidential bullshit. Fuck this shit.
900525157218791424 2017-08-23 01:08:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are right. The positive stories are super important. Thankfully I've had nothing but good experiences when hanging with my friends.
900508833616875524 2017-08-23 00:03:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @geeoharee Truest words EVER
900454048960094208 2017-08-23 20:25:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill I'm in. I don't even need to get paid that much, the job satisfaction would be so high.
900453202176335872 2017-08-23 20:22:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill Can I get paid for that?
900435210952626176 2017-08-23 19:10:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill Whoop!!! I'm finishing soon but then what do I do with my life?
900435050507808768 2017-08-23 19:10:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> As you know I hang out with a lot of trans women and I am always going to the bathroom with them & have not received any crap at all. 
900236707030851586 2017-08-22 06:02:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think it is awesome how many times @pattonoswalt shows up in tv shows I watch.
900231226312806400 2017-08-22 05:40:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> This cannot be real. Or it cannot be 1999. Twitter tell me so I don't have to do work. https://twitter.com/nazi_catcher/status/900230248608006144
900229667558486018 2017-08-22 05:34:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> I can!!!
900223245688983556 2017-08-22 05:08:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Paul is sorry now...I told so called BF to save me next time and he agreed lolololol
900218026414534656 2017-08-22 04:47:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Right?? But paul has scared me.
900214345094836229 2017-08-22 04:33:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> I wanna blame Paul cuz he told me they are all black widows and other poisonous crap.
900212466520657920 2017-08-22 04:25:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> It was really sucky and I'm embarrassed how much it bugs me
900212376598974464 2017-08-22 04:25:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> I caught the damn thing and put it outside and I am now drinking wine. I wanted to drink straight from the bottle but I got a glass.
900205221548355584 2017-08-22 03:57:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> Got the fucking spider out of the apartment but damn I'm gonna be useless in the zombie apocalypse
900204615081361408 2017-08-22 03:54:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> I ducking goddam dropped the ducking spider
900203310988349441 2017-08-22 03:49:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed The *nytimes* article I read (read that in a snob voice please) said 12 hr & 1:4 ratio. But I'll trust the former SB employee :)
900202942250307585 2017-08-22 03:48:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> And because my friend tells me there are lots of poisonous spiders in CA I am sure this one is poisonous.
900202452250767360 2017-08-22 03:46:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed But I am a fanatic about perfecting it.
900202370935738368 2017-08-22 03:45:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed It's not as good as store bought.....
900201952105160705 2017-08-22 03:44:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys I caught this giant spider and I am now paralyzed I am being such a girl I'm sorry helppic.twitter.com/40tE4hbIkG
900200690013884416 2017-08-22 03:39:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Hhhmmmmm. I'm doing it all wrong lol
900199364055969792 2017-08-22 03:33:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Wait... I thought 12 hours is the brewing time? Also what's your coffee to water ratio?
900165413438332928 2017-08-22 01:18:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'll be sure to live tweet it if we do get together!! 
900164190165377024 2017-08-22 01:14:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> He travels a lot for work and I am really flaky. We may actually get together this week for a drink.
900161176385896448 2017-08-22 01:02:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes he is awesome. At least via text... he is also my trophy so called BF as he is 28.
900134528634699776 2017-08-22 23:16:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today we are talking about chaos vs destiny.
900134462243061760 2017-08-22 23:15:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> But we pretend we are going to get together for a date and even get married someday. He and I have the deepest text conversations.
900134287575465984 2017-08-22 23:15:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have this so called boyfriend. So-called because we haven't seen each other in 18 months and we just text back and forth.
900132882202583040 2017-08-22 23:09:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @THESagerbomb "That's a crock of shit"
900096514722193408 2017-08-22 20:45:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane Mine is so much more petty than that. I do salute you.
900095481270763521 2017-08-22 20:41:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I can't figure my best one.https://twitter.com/nicole_cliffe/status/900073515348484096
900079947561095168 2017-08-22 19:39:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ReasJack Super awesome.
900054110988193792 2017-08-22 17:56:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PearlsFromMyrna Were they there for the eclipse? I heard traffic was awful.
900052901002792962 2017-08-22 17:51:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Yeah he read the tele prompter. My bar is low.
900049870718775296 2017-08-22 17:39:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> So tonight DJT wrecks whatever positivity he earned last night right?
900049597153689600 2017-08-22 17:38:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vincefalconi I'm always oddly proud my religion has enough crazy that it inspires movies.
900047745532084224 2017-08-22 17:31:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vincefalconi Actually, now that I think about it I remember going to confession as a child and having sins ...lying, hating.
900047492129079296 2017-08-22 17:30:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vincefalconi Also what sins does a child have???
899881495778648064 2017-08-21 06:30:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat just fell off the bed.
899855074964324352 2017-08-21 04:45:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis I'm in for that kickstarter!!
899854622768091136 2017-08-21 04:43:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis  have you seen this one? For your collection.https://twitter.com/smashmouth267/status/899775468559228929
899776607363059712 2017-08-21 23:33:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also I really like threading ridiculous tweets this way.
899776393294135296 2017-08-21 23:33:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Note: I have a litter box in both bathrooms and one out on the deck. I like them to have options.
899776173135208448 2017-08-21 23:32:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> I thought maybe he wanted to go outside but no he just wanted me to watch him walk to the other bathroom to poop in the litter box
899775880376991744 2017-08-21 23:31:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat was meowing at me to get out of the shower this morning so I hurried and I have a huge swath of unshaved leg. Oops.
899705932837289984 2017-08-21 18:53:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I hate the distrust that is still there.
899694073002344448 2017-08-21 18:05:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @requin Probably wanted to protect her eyes. Cats are smart.
899693227191656452 2017-08-21 18:02:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> Eclipse update. One cat acting weird. Others don't care about it.

899691631317721088 2017-08-21 17:56:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages You'll need to wait for the next one to test the theory. Hope you feel better soon.
899683621216206848 2017-08-21 17:24:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sesmith They are gorgeous!! And smart!!
899679233366147072 2017-08-21 17:06:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sesmith I always imagine my chickens are doing physics equations in their heads so I am certain that these chickens are also eclipse geniuses.
899674554972254208 2017-08-21 16:48:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @broomeman @CerezaNica It actually works really well!!

899423361284980736 2017-08-20 00:10:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CerezaNica @broomeman Yep. I have vague memories of doing this at school for an eclipse.
899423038147411968 2017-08-20 00:08:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @broomeman @CerezaNica I'm gonna make the cereal box eclipse viewer so I can go FULL NERD.
899419100073533440 2017-08-20 23:53:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis I left a similar situation after many many years of marriage. Sending strength. Xoxox
899122611652771840 2017-08-19 04:15:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> Interesting
899118859340267521 2017-08-19 04:00:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have never heard of that. Wow
899117347427860480 2017-08-19 03:54:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wait, is that like 17 days different?
899053828112121858 2017-08-19 23:41:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill @manicsocratic Last time it took me 2 days to get back to normal.
899042733880360960 2017-08-19 22:57:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes it would be fun!!
899041781769097216 2017-08-19 22:53:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> I mean we could make a couple calendars just for fun!!
899041415132454913 2017-08-19 22:52:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> A star fruit in a tutu
899041330772361216 2017-08-19 22:52:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hahahaha yes.
899040092358008832 2017-08-19 22:47:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yay!!!
899038733780959234 2017-08-19 22:41:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Now I feel a calendar coming on!!!
899038671571083265 2017-08-19 22:41:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> In the stroller etc etc
899038605783441408 2017-08-19 22:41:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> DRAGON FRUIT WITH GOOGLY EYES
899038458416476160 2017-08-19 22:40:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes!! I was thinking baby chicks.  Or...just fruit maybe. Like dragon fruit.
899037628296605696 2017-08-19 22:37:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Better than me. I'm actually back in bed.
899037205481443328 2017-08-19 22:35:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm not sure if it can top it. You need something cute + something odd. And vegetables aren't cute. He's got the odd part down.
898996638106099712 2017-08-19 19:54:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just realized I have to bake cookies.
898780742477430784 2017-08-18 05:36:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @jonrosenberg There are very fine people in both those tweets.
898775049561227264 2017-08-18 05:14:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @paulidin It bugs me when the running away people know exactly when to jump for the explosion.

898620218943066113 2017-08-18 18:58:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Why are people saying there is something mentally wrong with Trump? He is just a product of his environment. An old white man. An asshole.
898412279871320064 2017-08-17 05:12:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> Turned in my paper !!! Thanks for the support!! Two classes to go for my masters in strategic management.
898389305634168832 2017-08-17 03:41:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> On the paper home stretch. Send me more positivity!!
898328903869018112 2017-08-17 23:41:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Since I don't follow DJT on twitter, I had no idea he actually tweets this much. Wow.https://apple.news/AMWD3FPzoT4aXcQ2RUnSmKA
898278473088749568 2017-08-17 20:20:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nyhcmaven84 I wish they were my neighbors.
898278142112014336 2017-08-17 20:19:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nyhcmaven84 Bob's Burgers is really the best. I am jealous of your t shirt.
898277792739057664 2017-08-17 20:18:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Like WSJ seems more conservative to me...I tend to get mad at the articles frequently. The economist seems more...neutral?  I dunno.
898277614359527425 2017-08-17 20:17:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I read it frequently. I was surprised when I first heard it was conservative. I wonder if it is just 'conservative' in the fiscal sense.
898275735772602368 2017-08-17 20:09:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> As if DJT or his supporters ever look at The Economist.https://twitter.com/economistlake/status/898140599441928192
898271041201479681 2017-08-17 19:51:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @blazedd0nut The open relationship one I get that all the time. "So we can meet to fuck?"  Nooooooooooooooooo

898261897136414720 2017-08-17 19:14:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> Spent 81 dollars on coffee chocolate and snack food to make it through this last day writing this paper. only two classes to go after this.
898223088570990596 2017-08-17 16:40:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin I'm right here baby

897898462544515077 2017-08-16 19:10:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaraMurray @yashar @john_sipher Oooh! I'm in LA, but can I be an east coast liberal?
897873643576803328 2017-08-16 17:32:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @elonjames Even evil can bake.
897871776453017600 2017-08-16 17:24:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages Of course now I'm freaking out about school because I procrastinated and have to write a huge paper in 3 days
897870075071348736 2017-08-16 17:18:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes. I got in several online arguments about this yesterday. BLM is not a hate group!!https://twitter.com/ismashfizzle/status/897784205928738816

897574026666622976 2017-08-15 21:41:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> I need to know what wine is made out of DJT's winery so I can be sure to not buy it.
897572840047747073 2017-08-15 21:36:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill @yer_grrl @SaltedJosh Oh I love that visual!!

897563843290726400 2017-08-15 21:01:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @AJ I feel he gave white supremacists the go ahead to continue. I fear for the people I care about and myself as a woman.
897563410568683520 2017-08-15 20:59:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Shouldn't everyone on every council resign in protest? There are many councils, right? Everyone needs to stand up against this racism of DJT
897560427156062208 2017-08-15 20:47:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well. DJT just gave the white supremacists free rein. Please be careful, my friends.
897557748862275584 2017-08-15 20:36:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BoiJuanda @thebutterknife I never really learned this at home--  I just drip onto the bath mat. Does that count?
897557331952549888 2017-08-15 20:35:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis We will start a captive breeding program to save them.
897556988942405633 2017-08-15 20:33:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis I think I would litter box train mine and build little stairs to my bed so it could sleep with me. His name is Archie.
897555324227407872 2017-08-15 20:27:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Embarrassment of the racist white supremacist DJT yeah.https://twitter.com/ap/status/897551090488557568

897534768648146944 2017-08-15 19:05:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> DJT's only true policy seems to be to dismantle anything good Pres Obama created.
897507523271327744 2017-08-15 17:17:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ScottPaulAAM Thank you for standing against hate.
897288171624448000 2017-08-14 02:45:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaraJBenincasa Great idea!! I'll contribute tortillas from socal.
897253021888925696 2017-08-14 00:26:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> All I've done today is fight with white supremacists and pro trump people online. I need a shower and to move into my mothers basement, obv.
897248183817981952 2017-08-14 00:06:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> PSA: remember to never follow your  actor heros as many of them are pieces of shit IRL.
897247645936140289 2017-08-14 00:04:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder I fucking love you
897247181639266304 2017-08-14 00:02:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> But it was an uncomfortable moment to be attacked online. It made me wonder if I could take what many women go through on SM daily.
897246828294320128 2017-08-14 00:01:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> So yes, insult away. I own that I will continue to speak against the people who want to eradicate POC and the disabled and anyone else.
897246615575998464 2017-08-14 00:00:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today I was insulted-- it started out "I found the Hillary voter!!"  Went on to call me out for speaking against white supremacists.
897245382219972608 2017-08-14 23:55:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I could start a business
897201756962148352 2017-08-14 21:02:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill @philthethrill That's a good point. We need someone who is independently wealthy.

896924066484858880 2017-08-13 02:38:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill Good point. We need to have no tolerance for that shit. Do we all flood the boards? Do some infiltrate and then report to the rest of us?

894396623136071680 2017-08-06 03:15:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife Ooh I'll try! Thanks!!!
894392272736800768 2017-08-06 02:58:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I sincerely love trash. Poetry is hit and miss for me. I'm too literal. I admire people who can read it,  "get it",  and/or write it.
894391575811211264 2017-08-06 02:55:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife Trash is relaxing.
894391498585677824 2017-08-06 02:55:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife That makes sense. The few times I have tried to write (fiction) I see the influence of my favorite authors.
894390743543930880 2017-08-06 02:52:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I am sure your voracious reading also feeds your writing talent, cuz you write SO AMAZINGLY
894390513238908928 2017-08-06 02:51:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I spend entirely too much time stewing about it all.
894389864573026304 2017-08-06 02:48:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife That alone is anxiety producing.
894389077625020416 2017-08-06 02:45:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I stopped reading so much the past couple years and am now finally able to read again. I have missed it. It soothes me.
894388744056262656 2017-08-06 02:44:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Paper update: I have decide the field I am writing about. Now to decide the exact situation.
894388362382950400 2017-08-06 02:42:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife That seems like a plus somehow.
894386901699895296 2017-08-06 02:37:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @thebutterknife I gave into the inevitable and am on season 5. Sundays are fraught for me and I can't stay away from twitter.

894284904141172736 2017-08-06 19:51:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Women should just go start their own country and leave the men their bullshit.
894282538570600448 2017-08-06 19:42:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> No matter how many times I see this I cringe at the typo. Argh.https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/894198078353309698

892482331142873088 2017-08-01 20:29:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @showupforthis Fucked him for expediency's sake.
892453383122034688 2017-08-01 18:34:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> He prolly told her to smilehttps://twitter.com/thesinnerusa/status/890594243030503424

892429705915138048 2017-08-01 16:59:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> And that's my Tuesday Rant (tm)
892429563354951680 2017-08-01 16:59:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> Attitude starts at the top of the chain. And our top is a rusted piece of shit who is enabling other shits to act without consequence
892429381821358080 2017-08-01 16:58:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> And related--it amazes me to see how the tone of the country has changed in response to who occupies the presidency.
892429018976223232 2017-08-01 16:57:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> All other presidents just agreed to follow these guidelines/laws.
892428857571123200 2017-08-01 16:56:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> if people stopped doing those things. For example people are fussing about DJT profiting from the presidency yet no one does anything.
892428601160642560 2017-08-01 16:55:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> I didn't realize how much of government was people agreeing to do things a certain way, and I didn't know the anxiety it would cause
892428444381859840 2017-08-01 16:54:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> I want our societal and governmental norms respected again.
892428360369938432 2017-08-01 16:54:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> I spend a lot of time wondering if our next presidential administration will bring back civility.
892203541749682177 2017-07-31 02:01:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Pretty much wanna get a feminist avacado tat in solidarity now.
892197034370805761 2017-07-31 01:35:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Wow
892194383767797763 2017-07-31 01:24:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> I wish the "reclaiming my time" gospel video was longer.
892188068941152257 2017-07-31 00:59:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes!! I'm starting my campaign to become WH comm director now!!!https://twitter.com/badgirl_loony/status/892134278150189056
892187326306172928 2017-07-31 00:56:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today I'm sitting here thinking about that day when the country was mad Obama likes Dijon mustard.
892186586850316292 2017-07-31 00:53:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaraJBenincasa I have been wondering all day how this affects your relationship!

892184543616053248 2017-07-31 00:45:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> With so many lawyers lawyering about the presidency, why isn't DJT gone yet? #everyoneisalawyer
892177910722830338 2017-07-31 00:19:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> I could totally be the WH communications director. My answers would be all   "Yeah it's totes crazy but what can we do?" and a shrug
892173520863543296 2017-07-31 00:01:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I want to knit baby clothes.

890420223743893504 2017-07-26 03:54:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> The fact that the nice kid from Vicious is Ramsey Snow just pisses me off.

890271250592940032 2017-07-26 18:03:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's tough to exist on a higher plane when our government is such a horror show. #goddessproblems
889899833435185153 2017-07-25 17:27:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder It would make life easier
889852355935522817 2017-07-25 14:18:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ragbonehair Oooh! Let's write that!!
889849910153011200 2017-07-25 14:08:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> @smhbrb Ok that actually made me LOL and my cat is startled!
889849415019618305 2017-07-25 14:06:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've got 500 followers and only 3/4 of them are bots/spam.
889747486025236480 2017-07-25 07:21:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> I drank too much wine tonight. It cured my cramps though
889686445144682497 2017-07-24 03:19:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh They also sent an email about Riverdale and god help me I  that show.
889685554287190016 2017-07-24 03:15:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Well...it's pretty important.
889616461127327745 2017-07-24 22:41:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> "For me, divorce was like having my bones broken very, very slowly, one limb after the next, and then each rib-" #whitehottruth
889596019305979904 2017-07-24 21:19:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today on my walk I saw a guy walking 9 well behaved dogs from mini size to big size. Happy happy joy joy
889462705983168512 2017-07-24 12:30:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> @bethanyrutter I am so excited for you! I cannot wait to read it!! Congrats!!
889378600025071617 2017-07-23 06:55:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> I forgot to have a glass of wine tonight
889305557491998728 2017-07-23 02:05:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vexedmuddler This isn't under sea. This is a muppets set.
889192350227980289 2017-07-23 18:35:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> Perfect!!
889188382269612032 2017-07-23 18:20:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm a little blunt when I have my period you see.
889188307011239936 2017-07-23 18:19:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> You know the saying "in vino veritas"? I need to know how to say "in blood there is truth". In hemo veritas?
889018611217555456 2017-07-23 07:05:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes I love love love that movie!! 
888628968600985600 2017-07-21 05:17:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I need someone who wants to text only and send me presents too.
888625897065938944 2017-07-21 05:04:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @gingeriffic_knh That is awesome!! We should totally get together sometime, braids or no braids!
888609463204065280 2017-07-21 03:59:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wow!! Thank you
888595369591881728 2017-07-21 03:03:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hmm.
888594872642424833 2017-07-21 03:01:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Right? I need to find them. What exactly do I search? "Dudes braiding women's hair?"
888594513135976449 2017-07-21 03:00:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Someone teach my boyfriend how to braid my hair.
888556372270305281 2017-07-21 00:28:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just thinking again how I did not like how The Fall ended.
888445596654157824 2017-07-21 17:08:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @fijiwriter I live in California now. I have decided not to go because the crowds are insane and it's a big costumed sweat fest according to my friends

888120656142843905 2017-07-20 19:37:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I'll have to look it up!!
888110175818629121 2017-07-20 18:55:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Agreed. And more mysticism and magic in everyday life
888109408470814721 2017-07-20 18:52:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> What if matriarchal society was the norm, not an oddityhttps://twitter.com/hoodacademic/status/887894919603466240
888109304238166017 2017-07-20 18:52:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> What if Christianity didn't take hold and we were all pagan?https://twitter.com/hoodacademic/status/887894919603466240
888109058238042113 2017-07-20 18:51:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> What if indigenous people became the dominant people in North Americahttps://twitter.com/hoodacademic/status/887894919603466240
887877575162253313 2017-07-19 03:31:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Why do I keep watching Game of Thrones? People are killed every single episode. In horrible ways.
887457754578694144 2017-07-18 23:43:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> @egg_dog SCORE!!!
887457572814336000 2017-07-18 23:42:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @steenfox Sounds like something safe to do. I would never get in a guys car on a first date.
887451928363384832 2017-07-18 23:20:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> @twoscooters @silicondomme I need a Tony. I love this.
887420786671181824 2017-07-18 21:16:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> Cuz it gets people insured and it's better than nothing.https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/887390324213125122
887386401993400320 2017-07-18 18:59:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> "Being an adult is like trying to fold a fitted sheet". That just came across my phone and is soooo true.
887356324119420928 2017-07-18 17:00:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> Loyal. DJT keeps using the word loyal to praise people. No. Loyal is for my dog, not a politician elected to represent me.
887352614416859136 2017-07-18 16:45:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wow. That is a weird thing
887349186831671300 2017-07-18 16:31:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> And I read that as Chablis
887349073409265664 2017-07-18 16:31:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> No I think you can read it and feel the magic. I need to re-read it as I barely remember anything about it.
887132280178622464 2017-07-17 02:09:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I have a headache.
887094302668541952 2017-07-17 23:38:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also the forced isolation from their families speaks more to abuse than consenting D/s relationships.https://twitter.com/hauteviolence/status/887047384479350784
887091299324526592 2017-07-17 23:27:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Fran_Kilinski @FlawedPlane I dont know, but what about Chappaquiddick?
887089868685287424 2017-07-17 23:21:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> Needle  2/?
887073918795759616 2017-07-17 22:17:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @bulikowski Congratulations on being brave and strong enough to do the work to recover. I love your words today.
887014142447542273 2017-07-17 18:20:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> This seems important.   Thread:
887005933083123712 2017-07-17 17:47:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta *10,000 dollars
887005741445373952 2017-07-17 17:47:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta She also said it took 10,000 worth of her time to book those seats. She must be going broke with all the time she is complaining about it
887005543373561857 2017-07-17 17:46:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta Ann Coulter posted pics of an innocent person online. It would be awesome if @delta banned her from their airline for that privacy violation
886918736447275008 2017-07-17 12:01:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages Exactly
886838245560012800 2017-07-16 06:41:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat seems to be having a bad dream. What do cats have nightmares about? Huge mice?
886815926221275136 2017-07-16 05:12:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> Tiny fucking hats on cats you guys.
886814906229571584 2017-07-16 05:08:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm legit shocked that people are anti-breakfast for dinner.
886735906505236480 2017-07-16 23:54:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PushaTease That makes sense. So many women have that fixing urge.
886734394156761088 2017-07-16 23:48:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PushaTease Both really. I'm pretty loyal. Afraid of moving on too soon. But also afraid of speaking up. Working on it.
886730855976062976 2017-07-16 23:34:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PushaTease Honestly, that is the best advice. It truly is. Why is it so hard for me to follow?
886696188979814404 2017-07-16 21:17:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> Aaaauugh. The idiocyhttps://twitter.com/evanmcmurry/status/886677047971520512
886649852641202176 2017-07-16 18:12:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've seen enough Scandal to know the secret service doesn't judge what goes on or keep it from happening if it's illegal or immoral.
886473518619033601 2017-07-15 06:32:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane After moving from a tiny town in bfn, I finally got to experience TJ's. Life changing. I want to have Trader Joe's baby.
886472155482869762 2017-07-15 06:26:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane Lately I've been buying this ridiculously $$$ cheese at the farmers market and putting a drop of ridiculously $$$ truffle honey on it. 
886471034324439040 2017-07-15 06:22:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Every cheese MIT. I say this every time. I cannot choose between cheeses. Just give them all to me.https://twitter.com/thetastingboard/status/883421801547612160
886470006971572224 2017-07-15 06:18:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> I loved the Wrinkle on Time series. I'm excited for the movie.
886465750789087232 2017-07-15 06:01:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @anthoknees Of course Jason Momoa does. He is the real deal. At least in my dreams.

886437810047143936 2017-07-15 04:10:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are right. I really need to focus on the present. My blessings and gratefulness. Thank you for the reminder xoxoxoxo
886437227378507776 2017-07-15 04:07:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> That means so much to me that you say that I still want to make a lasting change on the world...
886436468276592641 2017-07-15 04:04:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh that is really fascinating to hear. So working on myself and being happy might mean I am on the right track?
886434445640650752 2017-07-15 03:56:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> This character on tv is like "I built a rocket out of cardboard".  Didn't we all do that?
886432718820487173 2017-07-15 03:50:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> Now I WANT to be a service person who "helps" Ann Coulter.   #nairinhershampoo #specialsauceonherfood
886432203399282688 2017-07-15 03:48:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta @smhbrb It would so be worth losing a job for that!!
886432073891708928 2017-07-15 03:47:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Awesome. We need a special hashtag for that. #civiliansubtweet?
886431682508673024 2017-07-15 03:45:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am putting this out there: this is no way to act.   Does it count as a subtweet if the person is not on twitter?
886431199786278913 2017-07-15 03:44:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Delta I love @delta for moving her. In my head it was a liberal who did the whole thinghttps://twitter.com/bettybowers/status/886389936215257088
886429482109648897 2017-07-15 03:37:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Kissieyes It's not fair! What part of me is missing? I am smart and a hard worker. I just don't have that spark.
886409325966540801 2017-07-15 02:17:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> No matter what the explanation is, I am painfully average. And that's ok.
886409056289644550 2017-07-15 02:16:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> The other option is reincarnation. Perhaps I was a blade of grass for many lives while they evolved
886408781394886656 2017-07-15 02:14:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm talking about the people who have truly changed things. Steve Jobs. Bill Gates. Oprah. Beyonc. Tupac for sure.
886408549932212224 2017-07-15 02:14:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> So my theory is that time travel exists and these wildly successful people went back in time (became younger too) and kept their knowledge.
886408361796706304 2017-07-15 02:13:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> While I am struggling still with what I want my life to be. What I want to do. Who I am.
886408214589329408 2017-07-15 02:12:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am such a child in life. And I am not a child chronologically. Not at all. I see people my age and much younger succeeding wildly
886408008464347138 2017-07-15 02:11:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> I have a theory
886255681745018880 2017-07-15 16:06:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> This is so true!!! It is fun to think about adventures!
886245310757863426 2017-07-15 15:25:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Washington would be great for you! So many artists.
886078458358452224 2017-07-14 04:22:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> Seattle is an amazing city too. I don't think Seattle really has seasons either though. Spring summer and fall. No winter. And lots of rain
886067166973272064 2017-07-14 03:37:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> I can't move until after you move here so we can hang out!!
886049540465336320 2017-07-14 02:27:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @_peech Maybe you can see lots of things in an airport. For 300 I can go from LAX to see PDX.!! (Not inc luggage of course).
885933756619538432 2017-07-14 18:47:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen I love it there so so much. I've wanted to live there since I was a kid. If I could find a job, I could move there
885931086823342080 2017-07-14 18:36:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen YES!
885911674376429569 2017-07-14 17:19:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ummm...I want to do social media for dennys.
885904014159749120 2017-07-14 16:49:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> LA is a really cool city to live in. I think I've done it long enough. I am ready for roots and I cannot afford roots in LA.
885903145523478528 2017-07-14 16:45:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @whitesky60 I've been trying for the past 10 years to get back there. Michigan has brutal winters-150 inches of snow. CA is too CA. I'm ready to go home
885902269153071104 2017-07-14 16:42:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @whitesky60 I grew up in Bellingham --I'm used to moss and rust.
885899885760831488 2017-07-14 16:32:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> Oh my gosh. I just thought about moving to Friday Harbor WA and got so happy.
885897930095316993 2017-07-14 16:25:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think I've lived in socal long enough. I think I'll move to the PNW
885896447358414848 2017-07-14 16:19:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Weird conspiracy theories are fun. It's interesting how smart people can believe wacky stuff.
885896229992906752 2017-07-14 16:18:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh That seems like too much work.
885895756296605696 2017-07-14 16:16:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Ha! yes!!
885895610317983749 2017-07-14 16:15:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I want to know more about this. Did they have kids in Argentina? Did they work?
885895482764963840 2017-07-14 16:15:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I met a guy that said the second president of the us was a black guy but the history books erased his existence.
885894879661834240 2017-07-14 16:12:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Did Eva survive him? What did she do then?
885889321428893696 2017-07-14 15:50:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @melstonemusic I saw a very cute squirrel while I was walking to the coffee shop this morning
885777759825518593 2017-07-14 08:27:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> This not sleeping thing sucks
885720699129745408 2017-07-13 04:40:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> Ummm. I think I'm 20 years too old to like Riverdale as much as I do.
885678230430031872 2017-07-13 01:51:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> Okay....this made me watch. And laugh...https://twitter.com/delta/status/885593718048403456
885677185339502592 2017-07-13 01:47:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder It's nice know that someone else has the crazy too!! :)
885676813900423168 2017-07-13 01:46:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder Omg you know me!!!!
885676187359494144 2017-07-13 01:43:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder I took a nap instead and I feel somewhat better. I don't know why but I am resistant to xanax. Maybe because I like it SO MUCH
885676022158336000 2017-07-13 01:43:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've tried and tried to like cooked carrots and I just don't. Eggplant I like.
885622807228370944 2017-07-13 22:11:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I should not need to take a xanax today. Yet I think I need to take a xanax
885621992132497408 2017-07-13 22:08:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @nellychillin Today I am organizing my life.
885610173804433408 2017-07-13 21:21:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's a very overwhelming day

885604564950319104 2017-07-13 20:59:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wait. This is a joke right? Parody?https://twitter.com/jonrog1/status/885591097925189632
885604339011551232 2017-07-13 20:58:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 I fall asleep when I'm procrastinating.
885568357843349504 2017-07-13 18:35:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> Obviously he has never listened to the Hamilton soundtrack.https://twitter.com/charlesmblow/status/885547221332221952
885568125093068800 2017-07-13 18:34:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> I feel like Olivia's dad would have already taken steps to preserve the republic.
885556827768762368 2017-07-13 17:49:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> GROSSSSSSSShttps://twitter.com/igorvolsky/status/885555735219888137
885537713004335104 2017-07-13 16:33:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Carrots are the only veggie I can't eat cooked or mashed or boiled or anything.
885537516299837440 2017-07-13 16:32:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen I got Johnson. And I just wanted to make dick jokes all day long
885398099245408256 2017-07-13 07:18:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> And now I cannot sleep.
885364867837730817 2017-07-12 05:06:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> So. That's my manifesto for this Wednesday night.
885364777064611840 2017-07-12 05:06:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just need to step back and focus on me. Be selfish and be all ME ME ME. And I am going to do in unapologetically.
885364537452503040 2017-07-12 05:05:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> I need a partner. Not a drain.
885364422016815104 2017-07-12 05:05:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am tired. Exhausted. Mentally worn out from having to care for myself. For having to shoulder my burdens and someone else's burdens.
885364066335600640 2017-07-12 05:03:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> I miss someone having joy in my little things.
885363953630498816 2017-07-12 05:03:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> However I do want someone I can talk to about things the way I could talk to him during the good 10 years of our marriage.
885363802648100864 2017-07-12 05:02:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> And I do not want to be married to him again.
885363749183299584 2017-07-12 05:02:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> The characters were coming back!! Now, husband hadn't read the book. And yet he was excited for me. He always honored my passions.
885363514700845056 2017-07-12 05:01:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> I remember this time when I read a blurb of a book sequel coming out and I ran home to tell my husband about it. I was so excited
885350733217792002 2017-07-12 04:10:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> God I'm tired of the idiocracy of this country
885306982646689792 2017-07-12 01:16:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> My new night guard should protect me from nightmares and monsters right?
885234209979117568 2017-07-12 20:27:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Is Idris Elba the perfect man?
885231885877526528 2017-07-12 20:18:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Thile My coffee is sweet. Like my heart. I can't even type that without laughing. Ok sweet like a dogs heart.
885231384591192065 2017-07-12 20:16:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Thile It's cold brew with vanilla sweet cream. I'm basically a barista now.
885231016893218816 2017-07-12 20:14:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Now that I have made vanilla sweet cream at home I have had enough coffee to basically fly. (@Thile note glass)pic.twitter.com/BNGzsghCpG
885214315371823104 2017-07-12 19:08:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> But I am realizing that it doesn't work that way. No one is putting country above party. That's only in movies.
885214127899131904 2017-07-12 19:07:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> Remember in "A Few Good Men" where JN confesses on the stand and is immediately arrested? I feel like that should happen re:DTjr's emails.
885207876905582592 2017-07-12 18:42:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @bad_dominicana I just read some stuff about her and you are right! So awesome!! She needs her own movie.
885197328918892548 2017-07-12 18:01:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh Well now that you have put that thought into my head I'm sure it will happen. I better not sleep.
885196943231561728 2017-07-12 17:59:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh I dreamt about my ex. So relieved to wake.
885051830828453888 2017-07-12 08:22:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just finished game of thrones season one. Well done!
885051106644172800 2017-07-12 08:20:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ScottJKyle1 Good morning! Have a wonderful day!
885012902494785536 2017-07-11 05:48:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> I need to make some decisions.
885012728708046849 2017-07-11 05:47:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Congrats!!

884876591062433792 2017-07-11 20:46:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> Basically I cry throughout the whole second half of the Hamilton soundtrack.
884875372579377153 2017-07-11 20:41:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm erasing myself from the narrative ....
884291615681953792 2017-07-09 06:02:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys.
884171933163560960 2017-07-09 22:06:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> Is "I have to advocate diabolically" the new "well actually? ". Gawd.
884171329556979712 2017-07-09 22:04:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @veryann0yed Had to stop at "advocate diabolically". #ass
884167723311177728 2017-07-09 21:49:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MagsVisaggs It is definitely not ok. And it sucks and I am ashamed when I happens for myself and when others do it. :(
884167456532475905 2017-07-09 21:48:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MagsVisaggs As someone who hangs w a lot of ts and nb people and still occasionally makes mistakes, I am sorry it happened to you. I hate when I do it.
884133254537691137 2017-07-09 19:32:48 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh No. I told him he was nuts and I walked away. And I did not let him give me his number.
884132264468070400 2017-07-09 19:28:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill Ha! This I agree with!!
884131784006422528 2017-07-09 19:26:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill That was my knee jerk reaction and then I was wondering if I was being a knee jerk liberal.
884131411287920640 2017-07-09 19:25:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill He said the economy is doing better because trump. I don't believe that. But honestly the jobs report was good.
884130500750606336 2017-07-09 19:21:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Last night I met a man who said trump is great for the economy.
884130358270148609 2017-07-09 19:21:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Oh seriously. I need that too!!
884124623876444161 2017-07-09 18:58:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 But the spelling. Do you want someone who can't spell?
884124553982525440 2017-07-09 18:58:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Because we are trained to.
883925219873669121 2017-07-08 05:46:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> I know right?? I went through a bunch of names before I settled on this one. I can't believe it's been six years.
883917044491501568 2017-07-08 05:13:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Going to a party tonight and I look hot. Considering trading in the current model BF I have.
883916367090417664 2017-07-08 05:10:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> They are lying on my shirt but I can't bear to move thempic.twitter.com/ytHiRzaUUx
883890390205464577 2017-07-08 03:27:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I paid tuition for the first time since being single. Ouch. Being wealthy sure was nice. #freedom #worthit
883888592761700354 2017-07-08 03:20:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Seattle_JC I live by the water and am loving it. It's so much cooler here.

883732255063015424 2017-07-08 16:59:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Nativemanley Just figuring out this single life!!!
883731586948014080 2017-07-08 16:56:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Nativemanley Yay! I miss the northwest. Maybe next year I'll move up there again.
883727906421096448 2017-07-08 16:42:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Nativemanley I'm pretty good. Enjoying the California weather!! How are you?
883727455164391425 2017-07-08 16:40:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> So bonus--I still have a soul.
883727400755904512 2017-07-08 16:40:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> I used to joke I gave away my ethics when I started my MBA program. But I am still astounded by the unethical behavior of the president.
883725496755699713 2017-07-08 16:32:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> Good god our nations leaders are a disgrace. The daughter at the meetings?? How is this happening? How are people accepting it?
883586722528772096 2017-07-08 07:21:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm going to figure it out. I have unshakeable faith in my ability to create a life of happiness and contentment.
883586379476750336 2017-07-08 07:19:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm still figuring out what I want out of my life. I'm working hard to create my life.
883585489269161984 2017-07-08 07:16:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> It hasn't been easy. And it is still hard. And it is MY story for the first time in my life.
883585279944138752 2017-07-08 07:15:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> I can draw a line from joining twitter to how I ended up in California.
883585131868442625 2017-07-08 07:14:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> I joined twitter (with this username) 6 years ago today.
883570438739120129 2017-07-07 06:16:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> I would like more wine please.
883524797803536384 2017-07-07 03:15:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm feeling better. I slept most of the day. No family reunion. I feel guilty but oh well.
883374353357746176 2017-07-07 17:17:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages Thanks. I'm a silly mess
883216835813949445 2017-07-06 06:51:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think I should definitively say no trip. Since I'm tweeting from the bathroom floor.
883187442064306176 2017-07-06 04:54:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> Or maybe I gave myself food poisoning. This I would believe
883187340583227392 2017-07-06 04:54:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> Which is funny because I have little stress right now
883187240137969664 2017-07-06 04:53:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I also think I probably have made myself sick from stress.
883187147234172928 2017-07-06 04:53:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am supposed to fly to my family reunion tomorrow and I think I am too sick.
883158660641202176 2017-07-06 03:00:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> Started watching Game of Thrones. Yes I am way behind but I bet I can be very annoying about it.
883125881455104000 2017-07-06 00:49:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Spider update: it died before BF got around to re-homing it.
883121747259609090 2017-07-06 00:33:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BradReason Add "feminazi" to the list....

883075075229982720 2017-07-06 21:27:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages Why does adulting have to be so hard? Also ilu too thank you 
883073977488351232 2017-07-06 21:23:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just ugh.

882474853248319488 2017-07-04 05:42:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Omfg someone drew a swastika in the vr world
882473100834512896 2017-07-04 05:35:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Someone is talking to Bf through the vr system and I am freaked out.
882470743010758656 2017-07-04 05:26:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> I feel like I have been transported to the future. I have not seen VR until now and it's amazing
882465216314785793 2017-07-04 05:04:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> I mean !!!
882465183783714816 2017-07-04 05:04:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> OH MY GOSH YOU GUYS VR IS SO DANG AMAZING??
882455411541983233 2017-07-04 04:25:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> He is calmer now but still feels a bit wtf about it
882455323482574848 2017-07-04 04:25:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> I know at first Bf was totally appalled and then calmed down a bit. I thought it was extreme tanning myself. Didn't realize it was makeup
882449181192802304 2017-07-04 04:00:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> Bf is setting up VR so soon I will be in the matrix.

882387153350647808 2017-07-04 23:54:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> Joy does not come from a checklist #whitehottruth
882315754825109504 2017-07-04 19:10:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen They were. It just seemed very inauthentic and more goth. It was kinda yawn really
882300235006918659 2017-07-04 18:09:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 That sounds like an awesome plan!!
882299342400311296 2017-07-04 18:05:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 That is great! The commute won't be too much?
882288418511650816 2017-07-04 17:22:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Wait you are moving and staying in your same job?
882288062004314112 2017-07-04 17:20:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen We were invited and put on the guest list to get in free so why not?
882129798633476096 2017-07-03 06:51:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> So I'm at Bondage Ball in DTLA and it is fucking ridiculous. Fucking pretentious
882012251057668096 2017-07-03 23:04:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> There is a spider in the tub. BF's only chore today is to re-home the spider. Will report back if it gets done or not. #menaretrash
882010106325483522 2017-07-03 22:56:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> The one thing I truly am addicted to is oreos. Don't give me Oreos unless you want me to eat the entire package. #buttheyarevegan
882006579897188352 2017-07-03 22:42:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> Dropped a piece of pesto covered pasta and my barn cat jumped on that as if it was tuna. He's got good taste, this one.
882001994910584833 2017-07-03 22:23:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well. I made simple syrup and now I am making hibiscus tea. #adulting
881906048591777792 2017-07-03 16:02:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh The series. I haven't watched the movie yet. Apparently the series picks up where the movie ended. It's good.
881901374190960640 2017-07-03 15:44:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> Started watching Dear White People. It's good.

881644032987865088 2017-07-02 22:41:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm at a sex shop buying a costume for a party and I overheard a girl tell another "don't tell anyone you saw me here". Lololol

881003655888908289 2017-06-30 04:16:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> I told the bf I felt angsty so he took me to target and bought me some glitter eyeliner.
881003348253491201 2017-06-30 04:15:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I did all the things I've been procrastinating about and then I felt terrible because I had nothing to worry about.

867205341716430848 2017-05-23 02:27:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ButtyHolly1 Most men are trash. You just need to decide what trash you are willing to have in your space.

867177370427441152 2017-05-23 00:36:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> I remember the excitement of standing outside waiting to go into a concert. My heart hurts for these kids. 
867176766762242048 2017-05-23 00:33:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @BaronessMartha @sea_murder You are still surviving. That honestly makes me happy.

860725034939105284 2017-05-05 05:16:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> VEEP IS HILARIOUS
860723367086768128 2017-05-05 05:10:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I also bought a hybrid car so I'm all LA and smug.
860723286295982080 2017-05-05 05:09:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Pizza would be the hardest for me too. I've been eating mostly fish for protein lately (except for pizza ofc) and I'm feeling smug about it
860722781628973057 2017-05-05 05:07:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill How is this dietary change going? Any cravings?
860722456310370304 2017-05-05 05:06:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Um...Olivia Pope is my dietary idol. Red wine and popcorn 24/7
860722006735466497 2017-05-05 05:04:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Red or white wine?
860721291992506368 2017-05-05 05:02:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I'm giggling so hard about Meat Whiskey
860721063918936064 2017-05-05 05:01:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill Wait. Whiskey is made from meat?
860720455203799040 2017-05-05 04:58:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hugs. You are enough. I promise.
860719910594387969 2017-05-05 04:56:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yep. No one binges on raw veggies.
860719712082083840 2017-05-05 04:55:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> Barney also pounces on my feet randomly at night. And he sleeps snuggled up against my back
860719524592590848 2017-05-05 04:55:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> Barney the barn cat also has discovered his tail and chases it around everyday. It's hilarious.
860719124229443584 2017-05-05 04:53:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> So my barn cat is adjusting to indoor life. He watches TV.
860718797572890624 2017-05-05 04:52:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> If I had chips here I would strap on that feed bag.
860718386577162240 2017-05-05 04:50:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> So that's my story tonight. Now someone come rub my back
860718238849671168 2017-05-05 04:49:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> So I had popcorn and grapes. A LOT OF POPCORN AND GRAPES
860718035493048321 2017-05-05 04:49:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> The bad part about wanting to eat ALL THE JUNK FOOD is I don't really keep junk food around.
860717641064792064 2017-05-05 04:47:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> Tomorrow I can eat healthy. Today it's all starch and sugar
860716678723780608 2017-05-05 04:43:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill It's not normal. But you know that so you are ok.
860715538070200320 2017-05-05 04:39:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's that time of the month where I ate my body weight in food.

860530189855412224 2017-05-05 16:22:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> This morning I saw an LAPD guy be nice to a woman and child and it was so sweet it almost made me cry.
860381263177293824 2017-05-04 06:30:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Every so often it hits me that I am divorced from that man and my joy knows no bounds.

856698559076356096 2017-04-24 02:37:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I think "orgasm" is a patriarchal word. I "worgasm"

855986469403410432 2017-04-22 03:27:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> Watching Westworld thanks to @dadstronaut
855855253530460160 2017-04-22 18:46:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio As a white man your opinion holds no merit with me :)
855848069719498752 2017-04-22 18:17:35 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio Really. The men were kidnapped and the women were stolen. Because women are simply possessions.
855666261132402688 2017-04-21 06:15:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> Listening to a radio show from 1947. A kidnapped girl is referred to as "this girl is stolen". A thing? A possession?
855639586608787456 2017-04-21 04:29:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> He is real :)

830214753540673537 2017-02-10 00:39:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages it was supposed to be moved for construction yesterday and today I needed it and I couldn't find it and we looked EVERYWHERE
830214332646436864 2017-02-10 00:38:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages it went missing for a long time!! It was the weirdest thing. We found it in the gamma camera room.
830213871004635137 2017-02-10 00:36:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> So. Today at work we lost a chest freezer.
830173052503625728 2017-02-10 21:54:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ppppolls @jpshaddai @MicheleelehciM in Michigan we say "youse" ---
830164207098228736 2017-02-10 21:19:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> There is a urine test to test for a genetic mutation that leads to canine transitional cell carcinoma. (80,000 + cases a year).  Huh.
830126217516888064 2017-02-10 18:48:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> Twitter: where someone has said it better, funnier and more succinctly a few hours ago.

829565733256310787 2017-02-08 05:40:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's fascinating. And wow our fucking country is full of assholes now
829565555531067392 2017-02-08 05:40:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Popular programming was full of subtle and not subtle anti nazi messages. There would be no debate over punching a nazi.
829565321358880768 2017-02-08 05:39:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm listening to radio broadcasts from the 1930's-40's. Those people HATED the nazis and the fascists
829552068838912001 2017-02-08 04:46:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Fucking oblivious. Lies. Lieshttps://twitter.com/abc/status/829180971962372097

829156824968417280 2017-02-07 02:36:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages I had ALREADY made teabag tea though.
829156762238357504 2017-02-07 02:35:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages I was concerned.
829156215913533441 2017-02-07 02:33:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> I found it!!
829155680892248064 2017-02-07 02:31:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> I can't find my tea strainer.
829150742673895424 2017-02-07 02:11:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> @vexedmuddler @j_muddles this is the weirdest thing ever.

827018914768883712 2017-02-01 05:00:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> it was absolutely totally amazing and I needed that. Thank you so so so much
827018508634517506 2017-02-01 04:59:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also I had the absolute sweetest card from @tokidokizenzen in my mailbox. My eyes have been leaking since
827017167283445760 2017-02-01 04:53:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today 2 employees -white woman, Latino guy- told me there is no white privilege because BET has a channel but there isn't a white channel
826970197034557440 2017-02-01 01:47:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys I'm so stuck on Uncharted. I can't get past the crumbling bridge
826807664877277184 2017-02-01 15:01:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill that is exactly the advice I give to new hires.

825941780675719168 2017-01-29 05:40:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> Well. My friend who works in video games gave me a PS4 and I am flailing my way through Uncharted.
825882159172849664 2017-01-29 01:43:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> I wonder what it will take to get middle America mobilized. Those 1-issue voters, what will it take?
825804935870636032 2017-01-29 20:36:54 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane exactly. It's concerning!!!
825781916783620096 2017-01-29 19:05:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> Who is in charge when our leaders won't follow the constitution?
825763806735265792 2017-01-29 17:53:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Also DJT couldn't help but tweet out any imminent threat. https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/825754888021929984
825763612710969344 2017-01-29 17:52:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> Bwahaha--but DJT is too smart for intel briefings...so how would he know? https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/825754888021929984
825749333685346304 2017-01-29 16:55:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Besides, lyft requires nicer cars.
825564276320411648 2017-01-28 04:40:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I suppose. I'm down for the WH janitor right now.
825563952889237505 2017-01-28 04:39:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill what about the D's who are spineless cowards and not standing up???
825403041511677952 2017-01-28 17:59:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> Three amazing people who do so much good for a poor rural county of 20,000 can no longer visit their families.
825402882664980480 2017-01-28 17:59:17 UTC <sweetandzesty> The retinal specialist in my home town cannot go home to see his family.
825402790264463360 2017-01-28 17:58:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> The oncologist in my town (again only 1). Can no longer go home to see his family.
825402664271745024 2017-01-28 17:58:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> The ob gyn in my home town in Michigan (yes there is only 1 in my small town) cannot go visit his family now. He's is Muslim.
825204696495202304 2017-01-27 04:51:45 UTC <sweetandzesty> it's like the plot to a movie or a book.
824868502230097921 2017-01-26 06:35:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut yep. Got the offishul notification and all.
824865453931532289 2017-01-26 06:23:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> Had to go underground, y'all. I'm now alt.
824838202091466753 2017-01-26 04:35:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> Sharing this because DJT stopped running ads for ACA. Still time to sign up in all states.https://twitter.com/coveredca/status/815981007270658049

824071461417558016 2017-01-24 01:48:41 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Seattle_JC I don't understand why there hasn't been revolt from the politicians themselves. I thought they believed in our constitution
824066122924167168 2017-01-24 01:27:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Seattle_JC I'm very scared. I don't understand how this happens. Not allowing freedom of the press?? This is insanity.
824061482396553216 2017-01-24 01:09:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill isn't it good if you call out racist caricatures?
823939794476503040 2017-01-24 17:05:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> The news. I can't. #selfcareday
823715902348660736 2017-01-23 02:15:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> Honestly how do we stop this now? The lying and the hurting of women and children and people of color? Voting isn't enough. This is awful.
823389934220283904 2017-01-22 04:40:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @paulidin big hugs to your friend!!!

820700271282032640 2017-01-15 18:32:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo would you start by asking everyone to tell you who they remember as far back as they can?
820682381749161984 2017-01-15 17:21:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo yes!! But it would be so cool to see them all in one place

820396817623830529 2017-01-14 22:26:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @j_muddles my coffee maker grinds the beans. Should I add it to the beans or in the coffee?
820396414588989440 2017-01-14 22:25:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @j_muddles cinnamon. I could try that.

819453146300760065 2017-01-11 07:57:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am so sad for America.
819446845734723584 2017-01-11 07:32:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think VP Biden probably says "love you, mean it" when saying bye to people.
819429495442505728 2017-01-11 06:23:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> The email was not very funny. It was not even funny. It described the cats meeting and was at most, amusing.
819429312667340800 2017-01-11 06:22:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> My mom has a new cat. Sends me an email titled: Cats-very funny

818599519013085184 2017-01-09 23:25:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I absolutely agree. I'm still a bit shocked at this one.
818598577949659136 2017-01-09 23:21:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I'm sort of at a loss. She is so sweet and supportive. But I guess she must be pro-trump and therefore racist/sexist.
818588431844392961 2017-01-09 22:41:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> One of my fb acquaintances called Meryl Streep a "nasty liberal bitch". And she had only seen one MS movie. Poor taste all around.

817935626032926722 2017-01-07 03:27:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> The main problem I've had the past week is that I keep toasting my happiness and I've drinking A LOT

812775518734991360 2016-12-24 21:42:38 UTC <sweetandzesty> it isn't mine.  But it totally makes sense. It makes me more scared of what Trump will bring.
812775202081779712 2016-12-24 21:41:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> yes. Because 2016 is the result of too many time travelers coming back and trying to stop trump.

812763616042590208 2016-12-24 20:55:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> her family assumes my friend is lesbian and last year told her to stop denying it to them and accept that they accept her.

803423193125908480 2016-11-28 02:19:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Reading a Fox News op-ed is almost as bad as reading the comments on any other news site
802997796097773568 2016-11-27 22:09:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> I wonder if he is trying to sway the electoral college to vote against him. Prolly scared of how big the job really is.
802926256232636416 2016-11-27 17:25:11 UTC <sweetandzesty> @mizellw I feel better thanks for the advice!!

802635134818140161 2016-11-26 22:08:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> You are irritating and you are irritating and you are irritating....#toomuchcoffee
802634669506240513 2016-11-26 22:06:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> I had so much coffee this morning the very air is irritating me.
801857662740615169 2016-11-24 18:38:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio noooooooo. I just started drinking Diet Coke again after 11 months of none
801510841589764096 2016-11-23 19:40:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> Hey guy being a dick to the flight attendant....this never ends well...
801502597374877697 2016-11-23 19:08:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio of course he will probably appeal. But at least I will be divorced. Free.
801501512752996352 2016-11-23 19:03:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio not yet but close!!!!
801500913500229633 2016-11-23 19:01:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> Haven't even left LA and my feet are cold.

801090648749260804 2016-11-22 15:51:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @LocksleyHall yes he is. You are correct!!
801088611181469696 2016-11-22 15:43:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> I don't see whining. I see concern, worry, fear and anger. I see resistance. I don't see whining.
800914898968453120 2016-11-21 04:12:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> My grandpa fought in WWll. He would be appalled at what is happening.
800900948046422016 2016-11-21 03:17:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> I just keep being surprised by the vitriol.
800812623604236288 2016-11-21 21:26:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Older white male at a leadership conference telling a room full of poc women how he is glad trump won....
800568687296024576 2016-11-20 05:17:03 UTC <sweetandzesty> It's raining here in LA.
800553630487093248 2016-11-20 04:17:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill lucky!
800522503818919938 2016-11-20 02:13:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio both of those got put on my list last night. My miles long list of shows I haven't seen ;)
800520806191091712 2016-11-20 02:06:47 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio agreed and I did too for the longest time.
800518841377824768 2016-11-20 01:58:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio yeah the sequels aren't all in Netflix right now
800518720388886528 2016-11-20 01:58:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SkipTerrio Even I could see a serious subtext so I had to watch  like 20 YouTube videos explaining things about it.
800515806761140224 2016-11-20 01:46:55 UTC <sweetandzesty> I watched Ghost in the Shell last night and am mildly obsessed.
800095899414208512 2016-11-19 21:58:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm just disgusted daily by what's happening in this country.
798955110852239360 2016-11-16 18:25:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> I saw an orca whale while I was walking along the beach today
798947589253054464 2016-11-16 17:55:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill it's call Furiously Happy and it's a movement.....
797701999382798336 2016-11-12 07:25:51 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think I'm most upset by the fact I grossly overestimated the common decency of people
797637905011216384 2016-11-12 03:11:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill I honestly have been looking to take something. That is a great idea.
797637659933876226 2016-11-12 03:10:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @GKM77X @emotionalpedant oh good god I'm so happy at this minute
797257605458444288 2016-11-11 02:00:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> I am thoroughly sad and thoroughly angered so I will be signing off again. Be strong.
797253906648571904 2016-11-11 01:45:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> Those white sexist racists who have ruined my country
797253804844421120 2016-11-11 01:44:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> LRT-  yes. My old town of 1800 with no black people is way more of a bubble than LA where I live now
797253207353278465 2016-11-11 01:42:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages it's an ok job. I just don't know if I'll be able to keep the job after Voldemort ruins the economy.
797251119684546560 2016-11-11 01:34:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages I work in a luxury sector. I need to look for a new job. I am definitely staying on the west coast though.
797249874727038976 2016-11-11 01:29:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages I just have no words
797249217076920321 2016-11-11 01:26:40 UTC <sweetandzesty> I've needed time off from all media. But I'm in an Apple Store waiting for my phone to be fixed. I'm bored so I might as well be angry/sad
796204822668021762 2016-11-08 04:16:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Seattle_JC me neither. I am so sad and despairing
796195328638603265 2016-11-08 03:38:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> I'm coming with you.

796166977035218944 2016-11-08 01:46:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen I feel you.
796166582082768896 2016-11-08 01:44:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen it is less negative than it could be? Sane is a really good plan. Is it working for you?
796162912259690496 2016-11-08 01:30:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen really "we all need less awful" is an awesome mantra except for it isn't very positive.
796161762890387456 2016-11-08 01:25:30 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PaganVixen oh that would be awesome!!! Hopefully by the new year my life won't be so awful.

794783354893668352 2016-11-04 06:08:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill I liked it!!!
794737310797479936 2016-11-04 03:05:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> @PhilthePill I'm at the theater to see it right now. I hope I'm not disappointed!!
794717843547824128 2016-11-04 01:47:53 UTC <sweetandzesty> @SaltedJosh it's a bit salty.

794689766755221508 2016-11-04 23:56:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today didn't suck. I'm hesitant to call it a good day. But it didn't suck.

794347795578617856 2016-11-03 01:17:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @MissElaMap I'm gonna become a stripper. (Looking for high dollar low stress)
794330354861518848 2016-11-03 00:08:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> I will say that California is full of disordered eating.
794268260766056448 2016-11-03 20:01:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @rey_z #whoisgerri let's make it a movement

794228546021359616 2016-11-03 17:23:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> You guys are awfully supportive about this potential career change :)
794203346185793536 2016-11-03 15:43:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> Realized I can't be a stripper cuz I can't walk in heels.

794023418928582656 2016-11-02 03:48:29 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo are you watching The Fall?? Stella is still amazing and her outfitsssss
794008075145383936 2016-11-02 02:47:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I was in therapy long before I left and still am and I'm so spooked by so much. It's tough. We can get through!!!
793997740845899776 2016-11-02 02:06:27 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane omg exactly!! And people think that once you are free it should be easy to build a new life. It's so hard
793994592295104512 2016-11-02 01:53:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane yes. My ex husband. So I am overly sensitive to any type of cue like that
793991466896850944 2016-11-02 01:41:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages wait but I don't know any not overly entitled men!!
793991338781863940 2016-11-02 01:41:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder right?
793990874904477696 2016-11-02 01:39:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder see I don't hear that. I hear a lot of trump because apparently emails are the devil
793990761100382209 2016-11-02 01:38:43 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder oh that's weird!!!
793990159607828480 2016-11-02 01:36:20 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder right?? And I'm freaked out about the election!!
793989325742448644 2016-11-02 01:33:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages man haters unite hahaha at least I am one...
793988851492474880 2016-11-02 01:31:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Faith_Manages my actual text was almost that word for word.
793988728058327040 2016-11-02 01:30:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane I went on one coffee date with him and he's already being possessive. Obviously does not know me. #incharge
793987298136178689 2016-11-02 01:24:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> Every Wednesday an exciting food truck comes to my apartment complex. It was cancelled tonight. 2016 just keeps getting worse and worse.
793980575681908736 2016-11-02 00:58:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Needless to say he is no longer welcome to contact me at all.
793980284475580416 2016-11-02 00:57:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> Some guy was over texting me and I ignored him. He said "you will need to explain why you have been silent".   LOLOLOLOLOLOL
793940566132211712 2016-11-02 22:19:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder yup. Asshole.
793928015742791680 2016-11-02 21:29:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder gotta get out of this place!!
793927546815463424 2016-11-02 21:27:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sea_murder one is my boss and the other a doc.
793919577860153344 2016-11-02 20:55:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ReasJack thanks. It's been tough.
793919465272397824 2016-11-02 20:55:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> @NaboCane yes. That is the exact word to use
793910988349153280 2016-11-02 20:21:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> The two men in my office are not voting because they can't condone trump but can't vote for a woman.
793836311824048128 2016-11-02 15:25:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> @seanpaulmahoney when?

785913852764401668 2016-10-11 18:43:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> @dadstronaut why did it make me think of you?
785719949524250624 2016-10-10 05:53:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> I tossed and turned so much last night I literally took off one of my pillowcases.
785716147836432384 2016-10-10 05:38:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> Thank you for making that plea for help all about you.
785693399668011008 2016-10-10 04:07:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> Xanax and cereal for dinner. I'm adulting so hard.
785690212462497792 2016-10-10 03:55:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> Me: mom I have an MBA with a concentration in finance. I could literally teach that class.  Mom: oh yes, I forget you went to college
785690012901789696 2016-10-10 03:54:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> My mom is telling me to go to a money management class at the community center.
785686119832694784 2016-10-10 03:39:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> I met a man from Sweden who moved here 2 mo ago. I have to keep apologizing for our crazy country.
785685737991606272 2016-10-10 03:37:31 UTC <sweetandzesty> GO!!
785681546275463169 2016-10-10 03:20:52 UTC <sweetandzesty> thank you. Xanax makes me smarter .Plus I have always wanted to be worshiped. (Gonna stick that in the religion somewhere)
785680639303389184 2016-10-10 03:17:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> also donuts maybe. GF for you ;)
785680087588810752 2016-10-10 03:15:04 UTC <sweetandzesty> she seems to be. She made a really weird choking noise and now she is just mad at food.
785679857057275904 2016-10-10 03:14:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> wait we need to build a better religion. People are sainted according to how many coffees they buy us.
785678553497022464 2016-10-10 03:08:59 UTC <sweetandzesty> My cat is having a sneeze attack and tried to eat and choked and it was scary.
785678415068172288 2016-10-10 03:08:26 UTC <sweetandzesty> ok that works for me. She can be a lesser saint in the church.
785677647611211776 2016-10-10 03:05:23 UTC <sweetandzesty> Yes. Twitter is like crackle.https://twitter.com/almostshawn/status/785676947175211008

785353700650856450 2016-10-09 05:38:08 UTC <sweetandzesty> I get flashbacks to my marriage when I hear trump speak. My husband is an abuser. A gas lighter.
785353240674041856 2016-10-09 05:36:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> Clinton seemed to stumble a bit more tonight. However she still did an outstanding job standing up to #americasabuser
785339096042319873 2016-10-09 04:40:06 UTC <sweetandzesty> This is a good thread.https://twitter.com/craigdaitch/status/785324232972513280
785310774839226368 2016-10-09 02:47:33 UTC <sweetandzesty> I think HRC should have just pivoted every question into asking DT about sexual assault and misogyny.
785309705790902272 2016-10-09 02:43:18 UTC <sweetandzesty> I want more questions about gun reform, racial divisiveness and how to solve that. And honestly, I want DT to admit he is a pussy grabber.
785307555161518080 2016-10-09 02:34:46 UTC <sweetandzesty> That's a horrible stupid question.
785307427646210048 2016-10-09 02:34:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> Clinton really knows what she is talking about on this energy thing.
785306062681276416 2016-10-09 02:28:50 UTC <sweetandzesty> @pubchick he is a gross abuser.
785305505153507328 2016-10-09 02:26:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> He is such a liar. He is such a clear abuser.
785305121697566722 2016-10-09 02:25:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> @pubchick yes. Sigh.
785304653781045249 2016-10-09 02:23:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @pubchick she may be an assclown but she is a better one.
785303607893569537 2016-10-09 02:19:05 UTC <sweetandzesty> My neighbors are black. We live 3 blocks from the beach in playa Del Rey. #innercity
785301558002987008 2016-10-09 02:10:56 UTC <sweetandzesty> He cannot answer the question on Aleppo because he has no grasp on foreign policy.
785300713710559232 2016-10-09 02:07:34 UTC <sweetandzesty> "She doesn't know who the rebels are"
785300271567998977 2016-10-09 02:05:49 UTC <sweetandzesty> I like these moderators.
785297084912066560 2016-10-09 01:53:09 UTC <sweetandzesty> Wait what?
785296857102548992 2016-10-09 01:52:15 UTC <sweetandzesty> This Russia answer....

785291066048065538 2016-10-09 01:29:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> Trump starting to melt.
785288532189257728 2016-10-09 01:19:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> He can't even attack coherently.
785286972352770048 2016-10-09 01:12:58 UTC <sweetandzesty> Go Anderson Cooper

780787317749329920 2016-09-27 15:12:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> Just heard on the radio an immigrant that is leaning to DT because he is so angry and cares so much. Good FUCKING lord.
780756434166255616 2016-09-27 13:10:14 UTC <sweetandzesty> @smhbrb @msbshoshani bigly is the betterest.

771141151889817600 2016-08-31 00:22:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> Is it bad I was not sad to tell a little entitled brat she is not rehire able when she asked?

770423171111460864 2016-08-29 00:49:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @rickisiouxan I looked curly.
770361182574120960 2016-08-29 20:43:13 UTC <sweetandzesty> @rickisiouxan I got perms throughout the 80's.

769711687804915714 2016-08-27 01:42:21 UTC <sweetandzesty> nope. But still a surprise
769702199320453120 2016-08-27 01:04:39 UTC <sweetandzesty> I heard from someone who apologized for being a jerk.
769691015510945793 2016-08-27 00:20:12 UTC <sweetandzesty> yes you are
769666706235092992 2016-08-27 22:43:37 UTC <sweetandzesty> I love dogs like I love kids. Don't want them, but will play with them forever
769660806594199552 2016-08-27 22:20:10 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo I agree they should be the one embarrassed. You are funny and awesome and amazing and stand up for what's right.
769639717591625728 2016-08-27 20:56:22 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo don't worry about it. We all have racist uncles and we've all done the same thing.

768137077938491392 2016-08-23 17:25:25 UTC <sweetandzesty> @EffiMai also if one of us is being loud we say "cheese" as the calm down word.
768136963266269185 2016-08-23 17:24:57 UTC <sweetandzesty> @EffiMai when some is in need of rescuing from an overly talkative family member we say "go give them cheese"

765357561105096704 2016-08-15 01:20:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> @sarahjeong I took my two cats on a plane and did not consider that. I feel like I failed my pre flight worrying.
765356771078569984 2016-08-15 01:17:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> Today I welcomed my new corporate overlords and I did it gracefully, if I do say so myself.

727685684870283265 2016-05-03 02:26:01 UTC <sweetandzesty> I was called a sadist today because I was describing ingrown toenail treatments.

727296614805725184 2016-05-02 00:40:00 UTC <sweetandzesty> Getting my smog checked. Totally panicked about this.
727296514293403648 2016-05-02 00:39:36 UTC <sweetandzesty> A cop was stopped at a light texting. Light turned green. Cop didn't move. Not one person honked ....a full minute passed before cop moved.

709272125710860288 2016-03-13 06:57:07 UTC <sweetandzesty> Everything is a subtweet. Everything.
709271676362444800 2016-03-13 06:55:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ayetunes be very very careful.
709270437784453121 2016-03-13 06:50:24 UTC <sweetandzesty> @ayetunes are you made of fries? Or chips in your language?

707398930342895620 2016-03-08 02:53:42 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CerezaNica exactly. I think they are vampires.
707391283526938624 2016-03-08 02:23:19 UTC <sweetandzesty> @CerezaNica I always wondered that. Cuz they must smell bad. And how are they shaving their legs, arms, and faces ?
706671720577380353 2016-03-06 02:44:02 UTC <sweetandzesty> The debate is on and I still don't know how big Bernie's dick is.
706570229900443648 2016-03-06 20:00:44 UTC <sweetandzesty> My life is so weird and I love it.
706410609332490240 2016-03-06 09:26:28 UTC <sweetandzesty> I accidentally drank too much tonight and now I am the passenger in a car on an adventure I don't want to have.
706266108295131136 2016-03-05 23:52:16 UTC <sweetandzesty> @philthethrill "accidentally"
706259127207485440 2016-03-05 23:24:32 UTC <sweetandzesty> @Scaraboo I used to smear the paper when writing. But yeah, the dreaded "are you left handed?" question is pretty much the worst
