971875668412780547 2018-03-08 22:29:50 UTC <MHHmeyer> A shocker from CMS and Verma, apparently shooting down Idaho's state-based plans. https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2018-Press-releases-items/2018-03-08.html?platform=hootsuite

971862431227138054 2018-03-08 21:37:14 UTC <MHHmeyer> @SpeakerRyan @mattyglesias @jdawsey1 @GameEnders_ The gradual increase to "full" benefits at 67 instead of 65 was passed in the 1980s, no other changes have been made since then. Given widespread retirement insecurity, I have a hard time seeing the age moved up further.
971849335536308224 2018-03-08 20:45:12 UTC <MHHmeyer> @mattyglesias @jdawsey1 Here's what's on Speaker Ryan's radar screen: .@SpeakerRyan, at Home Depot in Atlanta, suggests creating a commission to "fix" Social Security.
971847769563582470 2018-03-08 20:38:58 UTC <MHHmeyer> @ASlavitt The reality is that insurers allowed to turn down customers and risk rate them are not going to automatically renew people who develop costly conditions. So renewability is an illusion in the non-compliant market.
971847359079550977 2018-03-08 20:37:21 UTC <MHHmeyer> @aaronecarroll Aaron, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought Republicans in Arizona and Wisconsin were talking about a duration limit on Medicaid benefits (5 years is being proposed in Arizona), not a dollar limit. Who knows, maybe some state is proposing both types of limits.

971472437828292608 2018-03-07 19:47:32 UTC <MHHmeyer> @politico @RobertLehrer Healthier people aren't going to be attracted if the premiums are set high. No, I suspect plans will continue to underwrite even if given the opportunity not to do so.
971470342467268608 2018-03-07 19:39:13 UTC <MHHmeyer> One thing I don't get is why insurers offering non-compliant plans would be willing to renew subscribers without medical underwriting.

Just because the Obama admin allowed that as well as year-long short-term plans doesn't make it legal under the ACA, according to legal experts.

959490029843296256 2018-02-02 18:13:44 UTC <MHHmeyer> @philipaklein Philip, exactly, there's no context in that memo whatsoever about what else Justice and the FBI had to justify the FISA warrant, which probably was a lot.
959484225358573568 2018-02-02 17:50:40 UTC <MHHmeyer> Could this be true? This runs against what a lot of experts have said, that Justice wouldn't rely on one source in seeking a FISA warrant.pic.twitter.com/L13iUka4JN

946045313101500416 2017-12-27 15:49:13 UTC <MHHmeyer> @pauldemko As I wrote in early December, it's Ryan versus strong public opinion against cutting Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaidhttp://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171208/NEWS/171209855
946044822300905472 2017-12-27 15:47:16 UTC <MHHmeyer> @jflier The progressive/single payer version of global budgeting would apply to total healthcare spending, as in Germany and other countries, not just to Medicaid and poor people. Big difference.
946044297337626625 2017-12-27 15:45:11 UTC <MHHmeyer> @jflier @amitabhchandra2 @jrovner @haroldpollack Under Medicare premium support, setting the contribution level would still be a federal decision, and states wouldn't play any role unlike with block granting.

946040436648488960 2017-12-27 15:29:51 UTC <MHHmeyer> Yes, also see my early December piece on GOP's political perils in pushing Ryan's Medicare/entitlement cuts in the 2018 election year http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171208/NEWS/171209855 http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20171208/NEWS/171209855http://cnb.cx/2C7VIlr
946039146765848577 2017-12-27 15:24:43 UTC <MHHmeyer> @davidfrum @Rossiniman Nope, Churchill was prime minister again in the early 50s when the elected president was overthrown by a U.S.-backed coup. Read All the Shah's Men. That led directly to Iranian revolution of 1979.
945808866918436864 2017-12-26 00:09:40 UTC <MHHmeyer> The key to us having a chance was to detribalize the politics of the state. And in a weird way, the (sexual molestation) allegations created tribalism again. You either believe the charges or you don't believe the charges.  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/26/16810116/doug-jones-alabama-polls-roy-moore?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter via @voxdotcom
945801966072074241 2017-12-26 23:42:15 UTC <MHHmeyer> @davidfrum Churchill's also the guy who pushed to overthrow the elected Iranian president and re-install the Shah, leading to the current theocratic Iranian regime.

Spoke briefly with Kevin Spacey, who was quite surly, on heels of his Bobby Darin movie flop. But Leonardo DiCaprio was very amiable.
