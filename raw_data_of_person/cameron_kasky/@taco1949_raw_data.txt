931951209635819520 2017-11-18 18:24:17 UTC <taco1949> @JoyAnnReid English punctuation seems to be a challenge for some of the Trumpers- along with human decency.

931531279681642496 2017-11-17 14:35:38 UTC <taco1949> @BuzzFeed Where can we buy that sticker????
931523284377759744 2017-11-17 14:03:52 UTC <taco1949> @rickygervais Trump is pure evil. A different person with a heart could have been a leader for the rights of animals. We need that leader.

931266113069043713 2017-11-16 21:01:58 UTC <taco1949> @JeffFlake And presumably there will also be an investigation of Trump- we do have his taped testimony of "pussy grabbing."
931237978466381824 2017-11-16 19:10:10 UTC <taco1949> @marcorubio WHY is Tillerson dismantling the State Dept? Look into that!!!!

931236389613654022 2017-11-16 19:03:51 UTC <taco1949> @eugenegu As does Trump. After all we have him on tape admitting he can "grab pussys." Case closed
931234266167554048 2017-11-16 18:55:25 UTC <taco1949> @funder @DebraMessing Doesn't excuse Trump either. Men have to do better. Until then let's let women run the world. It might save humanity.
931231444617310208 2017-11-16 18:44:12 UTC <taco1949> @clairecmc @jaketapper And Donald Trump? What about his accusers? How can we muster words to investigate a Senator when POTUS did far worse

926171588034166784 2017-11-02 19:38:08 UTC <taco1949> @KeithOlbermann Compare Trumps conversations from years ago to now. His struggle with cohesive thoughts/words- suggests Alzheimer's

926163008111431680 2017-11-02 19:04:03 UTC <taco1949> @tedlieu "Ah don't recall..." maybe the possibility of a few years in jail for collusion will jolt Sessions memory.

920741705724452866 2017-10-18 20:01:43 UTC <taco1949> @SenSasse As a concerned citizen my take is that Sessions is either clueless or in Trump's pocket. There is no protection from Russia.
920739187963416576 2017-10-18 19:51:43 UTC <taco1949> @SpeakerRyan Who wouldn't want to leave- this country is in shambles thanks to Trump, his lap dogs & the deplorables who voted for him.

919564721434628096 2017-10-15 14:04:48 UTC <taco1949> @politico @tedcruz Why do you support Trump, known for & admitted to, "grabbing women by the pussy." And now destroying the country.
919563262315958272 2017-10-15 13:59:01 UTC <taco1949> @CillizzaCNN Failing my ass. Without the press we would be going down a deep uninformed hole. Thank you NYT & WASH POST

919257065532592129 2017-10-14 17:42:18 UTC <taco1949> @politico @tedcruz A. Why do YOU support a sexual predator & B. Why do YOU watch porn & blame it on a staffer?
919200108859752448 2017-10-14 13:55:58 UTC <taco1949> @marcorubio And those who support POTUS are complicit.
919182577512087552 2017-10-14 12:46:18 UTC <taco1949> @NateSilver538 @selectedwisdom There was a giant shift when Palin came on the scene. She was the undoing of the GOP.
919176391056396289 2017-10-14 12:21:43 UTC <taco1949> @thinkprogress So sexual assault doesn't fall into the category of value. That's what deplorables voted for.
919175886309675009 2017-10-14 12:19:43 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump And now thousands if not millions of people will lose their coverage
919018149911126017 2017-10-13 01:52:56 UTC <taco1949> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump And only a certified racist MORON would want a compliment from Dobbs.

918932267321393152 2017-10-13 20:11:40 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP You should simply hang your head in shame & do nothing else.

918876814499512320 2017-10-13 16:31:19 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Only a MORON wouldn't know that subscriptions are up at NY Times, WaPost, & more watching MSNBC, CNN than ever! Real news!!

911948689081556993 2017-09-24 13:41:25 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @RepAdamSchiff This escalation with N Korea needs to be addressed immediately by Senators. Impeachment NOW!!!!

911720451822489601 2017-09-23 22:34:29 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Sounds like you don't want to talk about Russia today?
911719681366593537 2017-09-23 22:31:25 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump My friends and I are still laughing that you blast McCain, a true hero, when you copped out with heel spurs!
911706806925365248 2017-09-23 21:40:16 UTC <taco1949> @BuzzFeed No one gives a damn about celebrities having babies when babies are dying from earthquakes & hurricanes & GOP healthcare.

911702678539038720 2017-09-23 21:23:51 UTC <taco1949> @TheLastWord And Congress should impeach a traitor. We're waiting.
911662248518717440 2017-09-23 18:43:12 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Or launder money, cheat on taxes, insult women & people of color, take on a job for which they are unqualified, etc,etc
911640168687423488 2017-09-23 17:15:28 UTC <taco1949> @kobebryant @zachbraff And given what we know POTUS won illegally. By all rights Hillary should be President.
911629175643140096 2017-09-23 16:31:47 UTC <taco1949> @amjoyshow @tedlieu @RepTedLieu No doubt this was a stolen Presidency. If so, Hillary is our true President. It felt so wrong from Day 1.
911575593136902144 2017-09-23 12:58:52 UTC <taco1949> @RobGeorge @donnabrazile Thank you for saying that. Most of us see that the highest office in the US should have dignity. So embarrassing.

911574230172610560 2017-09-23 12:53:27 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump @DonnaWR8 Only 17% of the country like your bill & NONE of the major medical associations.
911351436235157505 2017-09-22 22:08:09 UTC <taco1949> @McFaul I disagree. When on FB my Trump voting relatives kept sending obvious propaganda type blurbs- even the English was slightly off.
911342432196988931 2017-09-22 21:32:22 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Your words ring hollow to the majority. You & Russia STOLE the election from Hillary. It wasn't legitimate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
911341862677618693 2017-09-22 21:30:06 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP You support a bill that only 17% of the country supports. You work for us- get it?
911331933619150848 2017-09-22 20:50:39 UTC <taco1949> @BuzzFeed Typical gross TMI Hollywood trash talk.
911331179659513856 2017-09-22 20:47:39 UTC <taco1949> @VP Don't you get it? 17% of the country wants it. The rest of us think you're cruel and evil!
911330234145890304 2017-09-22 20:43:54 UTC <taco1949> @VP But to the detriment of millions according to a multitude of medical associations. Why not a CBO score? Why not a bipartisan discussion?
911290872788111361 2017-09-22 18:07:29 UTC <taco1949> @jaketapper Making what we already knew true-this Presidency is a sham.
911290429760524290 2017-09-22 18:05:44 UTC <taco1949> @WhiteHouse @VP And Mr VP I assume you've read the response to the bill from countless medical associations & experts?
911282854436524033 2017-09-22 17:35:37 UTC <taco1949> @theodorekupfer @jimmykimmel @NRO Why won't a carnival barker stay on reality tv instead of colluding with Russians? Kimmel read the bill.
911279749519101952 2017-09-22 17:23:17 UTC <taco1949> @SenatorCollins @Alyssa_Milano Senator Collins please hold strong & vote NO! The medical community will stand with you!
911271642676043777 2017-09-22 16:51:04 UTC <taco1949> @lisamurkowski Senator please don't vote yes to the bill. We trust the medical associations that are against it. Please vote no
911269990518722560 2017-09-22 16:44:30 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @Governor_LePage @VP Apparently you people haven't heard that all of the medical associations are against this bill.
911202555119702016 2017-09-22 12:16:33 UTC <taco1949> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Then try reading legitimate news sources. Any fool can understand how Russia influenced the Trump campaign.
911201518967287808 2017-09-22 12:12:26 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Your voters might buy your lies but the majority don't. Hillary's book on the best seller list & she won popular vote. Done
911200354733363200 2017-09-22 12:07:48 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Hmm yet you & yours are heading to jail for collusion, $ laundering & obstruction of justice. Now that's news to bank on!
910902433957793793 2017-09-21 16:23:58 UTC <taco1949> @VP @POTUS @CBSThisMorning EVEN Christie is smarter & less selfish than you greedy men.
910901426175569920 2017-09-21 16:19:58 UTC <taco1949> @FLOTUS @POTUS But sweetie your husband thought it was funny to send a golf ball to Hillary's head and "grab women by the pussy."
910858092631478273 2017-09-21 13:27:46 UTC <taco1949> @ABC @nikkihaley You aren't speaking for the majority of Americans. There is anxiety, mistrust & embarrassment with this President.
910660781628362757 2017-09-20 00:23:44 UTC <taco1949> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson At least they aren't tweeting the President swatting golf balls at Hillary. Oh wait- that was the President
910621637334192128 2017-09-20 21:48:11 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @FoxNews You're not smart enough to be President let's face it. Add lack of class and Russian collusion. SAD
910620808212566022 2017-09-20 21:44:53 UTC <taco1949> @bishopk0s @TuckerCarlson Could you be any more crass and insulting Tucker? You lack such intelligence and decency. Unbelievable
910597763066458115 2017-09-20 20:13:19 UTC <taco1949> @matthewamiller Mueller holds the key and the more aggressive he is the more we should worry, what is Trump/Putin doing we can't see?
910489741040259072 2017-09-20 13:04:05 UTC <taco1949> @DrOz @IvankaTrump No thanks. Too busy reading about Trump/Russian collusion & money laundering.
910462795455574016 2017-09-20 11:17:00 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump @Alyssa_Milano The world is saddened daily to know Trump's win was a fu sham bought by RUSSIA!!!!
910461741624119296 2017-09-20 11:12:49 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump No actually the country rejoiced! SNL won because they MADE FUN of YOU!!!!
910461441676840967 2017-09-20 11:11:37 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump The world is dismayed that we have a carnival barker for President. Your rating is 34% the lowest ever.
910460409760673792 2017-09-20 11:07:31 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump OBAMA was our real President. He won legally with no Russian help.
910460055773962240 2017-09-20 11:06:07 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP So VP- does POTUS always make you refer to him in your tweets?
910459789041381376 2017-09-20 11:05:03 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump So that's why you shoot golf balls at her? You won illegally. Everyone knows Hillary would have won except for Russia SAD
910237314512752640 2017-09-19 20:21:01 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Who wrote this?
910211113446526976 2017-09-19 18:36:55 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @IvankaTrump Alec Baldwin's was sooooo much better.
910173722732056576 2017-09-19 16:08:20 UTC <taco1949> @MittRomney Trump read a speech that his caregivers wrote. He re tweeted himself hitting HRC with a golf ball. We unfortunately know him.
909492783232241664 2017-09-17 19:02:31 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP Why does the most wonderful country in the world have to put up with your shit. GOP you should be ashamed
909491986188705792 2017-09-17 18:59:21 UTC <taco1949> @GlennThrush @JoyAnnReid As disturbing as it gets.

909482182636433409 2017-09-17 18:20:24 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP Your tenure soon will be over. Your words hollow. Your jail cell awaits as does the 60% + of this country. Pack your bags.
909478630002176000 2017-09-17 18:06:17 UTC <taco1949> @morgfair @ananavarro A shameful embarrassment Trump is. And the GOP no guts to speak truth. Who will be our hope?
909438887751307265 2017-09-17 15:28:22 UTC <taco1949> @ananavarro Trump is beyond embarrassing and lacking in judgment. Worse yet is this symptomatic of a mental disorder?
909422185109958657 2017-09-17 14:21:59 UTC <taco1949> @McFaul Worse than that. Not of sound mind.

905519176667803648 2017-09-06 19:52:50 UTC <taco1949> @davereichert @SpeakerRyan Ryan, you are no longer valid as a speaker or spokesperson. You are in Trump world forevermore.
905518565419352066 2017-09-06 19:50:24 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Americans are with all those in the path of this horrific storm. As for Trump his words are no longer valid. Lame duck.
905512315956670464 2017-09-06 19:25:34 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump I don't get why you freaking lie all the time. Speaking for myself and many others I miss Obama's class and intelligence.

901848972641402880 2017-08-27 16:48:45 UTC <taco1949> @BillKristol Americans are tired of people parsing words. Call Trump by name & tell the truth. The GOP has let their country down.

900014309144657920 2017-08-22 15:18:27 UTC <taco1949> @SpeakerRyan Then don't offer huge tax cuts to the wealthy.
900014010841657345 2017-08-22 15:17:16 UTC <taco1949> @VP What we saw was someone who can read. When a member of his family signs up for the military then we'll listen.
899982817114894336 2017-08-22 13:13:19 UTC <taco1949> @JoeNBC Trump can read a TelePrompTer. Please don't suggest otherwise.

899076674335248385 2017-08-19 01:12:37 UTC <taco1949> @IvankaTrump You are so sweet for that. The concern at the moment is those, "fine people" who hate Jews and blacks. Will they unite with us?

898295854569631744 2017-08-17 21:29:55 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump You can't change history. Morons voted for you and Clinton would never had let this debacle happen.
898295516907225089 2017-08-17 21:28:35 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Do you support the right for Planned Parenthood to protect women's health? Or just your free Viagra?

898294101879246849 2017-08-17 21:22:58 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you can read up on the Constitution when you're in jail for money laundering and collusion?
898293431864356864 2017-08-17 21:20:18 UTC <taco1949> @mnstatefair @SenFranken Senator, we want the inept president OUT!

898287602230476800 2017-08-17 20:57:08 UTC <taco1949> @VP Your words are worthless base on your inability to stand up to an inept president. No one hears you anymore.
898287179440541696 2017-08-17 20:55:27 UTC <taco1949> @VP No one hears you. We only see you in bed with a Putin nazi loving president. Better to just stop talking.
898284873982652416 2017-08-17 20:46:17 UTC <taco1949> @VP Pence, no one cares anymore what you say. You are a lame duck vp who sold his soul. SAD.

898280297896316929 2017-08-17 20:28:06 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP Oops sorry but we're watching a nazi supporting president and a Putin lover man. Nothing else on the radar.
898275136784224256 2017-08-17 20:07:36 UTC <taco1949> @VP Worthless words
898275034044739586 2017-08-17 20:07:11 UTC <taco1949> @VP Worthless words from the vp
898274881338580992 2017-08-17 20:06:35 UTC <taco1949> @VP Who cares. You aren't man enough to stand up to an obvious unhinged nazi supporting president. Nothing you say matters. Worthless.
898273928006598656 2017-08-17 20:02:48 UTC <taco1949> @peterdaou @DebraMessing @realDonaldTrump Then they are enablers and their words useless.
898273571956432896 2017-08-17 20:01:23 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP Your words are useless.
898273436723589120 2017-08-17 20:00:51 UTC <taco1949> @VP Pence, your God is judging you. You sold your soul for your own selfish aspirations. Shameful.
898272869620121600 2017-08-17 19:58:35 UTC <taco1949> @POTUS @VP Will you condemn this president? You should be ashamed.
898272297668050947 2017-08-17 19:56:19 UTC <taco1949> @VP Dude, yes please help our friends. And don't forget women in the US who need birth control and health care.
898214168477806592 2017-08-17 16:05:20 UTC <taco1949> @CoryBooker @GenJohnKelly General you might want to add " I worked for a racist president" to your resume.

898181653180370949 2017-08-17 13:56:08 UTC <taco1949> @realDonaldTrump No, sad is when a president has the backing of the KKK.

898014812994756608 2017-08-16 02:53:10 UTC <taco1949> @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Biden has class and intelligence. Also he isn't a lying bigot. He would have easily beat Trump.
898010229127880704 2017-08-16 02:34:57 UTC <taco1949> @GenJohnKelly I thought marines had honor. All the ones I've known did. Until now.

897808763067015172 2017-08-16 13:14:24 UTC <taco1949> @GenJohnKelly Technically you were supposed to get a grip on the WH. Yesterday you failed America
897807565689683968 2017-08-16 13:09:38 UTC <taco1949> @GenJohnKelly What will help is for you to walk away and stand up as an American with dignity.
897797737571393537 2017-08-16 12:30:35 UTC <taco1949> @VP No more so than an unhinged failed presidency here
897657113610268674 2017-08-15 03:11:48 UTC <taco1949> @VP Democracy? Be a man and denounce the president. Religion doesn't make you a man. Truth does.
