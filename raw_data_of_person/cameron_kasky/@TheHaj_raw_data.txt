962780087769743360 2018-02-11 20:07:15 UTC <TheHaj> @freedomsupport Oh. I went into one of your stores yesterday and they told me this plan was for the US only and definitely didn't include Jamaica.

813762742951747584 2016-12-27 15:05:31 UTC <TheHaj> @askmadewell your sale prices disappear when I get to the checkout, see pic. (and BIGSALE code also doesn't work).pic.twitter.com/C10ZOuHDjj
809574249140809728 2016-12-15 01:41:56 UTC <TheHaj> 6/ I need to find an alternative to @StaplesCanada for my business orders.
809572673990905860 2016-12-15 01:35:41 UTC <TheHaj> 5/ If @StaplesCanada had just given me info, like I asked, I would have either said leave as is, or EXCHANGED $19 item for something else...
809572420147355649 2016-12-15 01:34:40 UTC <TheHaj> 4/ That's right. @StaplesCanada just gave me a refund that ended up costing me MORE than when I started. Well done! What service!...
809572158129180672 2016-12-15 01:33:38 UTC <TheHaj> 3/ Sounds great, except, refund put my order under $100 and so my $20 off coupon was negated and @StaplesCanada and charged back $20...
809571730327011329 2016-12-15 01:31:56 UTC <TheHaj> 2/ So I emailed and asked how I could return it to @StaplesCanada. Instead of telling me, they refunded my $19 and said keep it...
809571379565789184 2016-12-15 01:30:32 UTC <TheHaj> 1/ Just had THE most ridiculous interaction with @StaplesCanada customer service. I received an order with an item that was not packaged...
807393673969303552 2016-12-09 01:17:07 UTC <TheHaj> Holy hell @RogersHelps. You need to educate your chat associates on features/services. Just wasted 1.5 hours adding voicemail to my plan!!
806879961814548480 2016-12-08 15:15:48 UTC <TheHaj> Was excited at 1st but "survey" is a dud. So obviously vague and misleading. We need clear, direct Qs about election reform! @JustinTrudeauhttps://twitter.com/cdndemocracy/status/806244765826068480

804119341285380097 2016-11-30 00:26:05 UTC <TheHaj> @Mattel maybe indicate on website which outfits fit which dolls? Also, make more outfits.
804066929442979844 2016-11-30 20:57:49 UTC <TheHaj> @Mattel It's great that you sell @Barbie dolls with different body shapes now BUT why don't you sell any clothes for them!
803057049886072832 2016-11-27 02:04:55 UTC <TheHaj> @realDonaldTrump WOW! This must mean you'll be requesting recounts in those states in the interest of democracy, right?

764934912482930688 2016-08-14 21:21:09 UTC <TheHaj> @realDonaldTrump but it's okay for you to say Obama founded ISIS? Looks like you can dish it, but not so good at the take it part.
757638247652679680 2016-07-25 18:06:49 UTC <TheHaj> @askmadewell thanks!!!!
756862449182093313 2016-07-23 14:44:04 UTC <TheHaj> @askmadewell your reply last night said the opposite (no more Billie). Which is correct?
