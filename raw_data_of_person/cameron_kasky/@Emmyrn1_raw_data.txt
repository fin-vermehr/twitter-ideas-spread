959979010481516544 2018-02-03 02:36:46 UTC <Emmyrn1> @paulkrugman So, Paul Ryan GOP received 500k from Koch after passing the tax bill.  How much did he get for releasing the memo?  Maybe more than $1.50? Is this country for sale?

And total firearm related Aus. 1. U.S. 10.  2016 U. S. 3.8.  Increased ownership, eventual saturation, then the outcome. As in nursing we see symptoms then the disease is discovered.

Good article...still trying to figure out what is difficult or unconstitutional.  Attempting gun safety is not taking away guns.  Maybe check out Australia's gun related deaths.

Our congress and presidency is the same.  Realistic expectations are for her to keep upholding California values and not give up!

938651568617832448 2017-12-06 06:09:07 UTC <Emmyrn1> @clairecmc We need to be careful to define and distinguish between harassment and assault.  I've been victim to both.  Both are wrong.  Attacking the victims, Trump/Moore doesn't vindicate them! They need to be punished!
