944748719945154566 2017-12-23 01:57:02 UTC <denali_sam> Brilliant point of view @JohnDingell . I'm very grateful for your presence.https://twitter.com/JohnDingell/status/944704139677831169
944452295110152192 2017-12-22 06:19:08 UTC <denali_sam> @thehill @KevinVoldness Exactly. It's the underhandedness, no public hearings, no bipartisan feedback and discussion - no due and fair process. They painted themselves by their actions to be self-serving and totally untrustworthy to uphold their oath of office. Plus, owned by big donor $$$.
944450513998897153 2017-12-22 06:12:04 UTC <denali_sam> Oh I so hope he's correct. That said, this man (no caps) is capable of taking every low, partisan tactic to try to avoid it. He has no sense of shame, ethics, conscience, personal civil responsibility, morality or all the other qualities of character. He's all power + control + $https://twitter.com/thehill/status/944445239619719168

944446879839944704 2017-12-22 05:57:37 UTC <denali_sam> @TheLastWord Based on a lot of current media reporting, it sounds like every one of those sycophants, including Mitch (& Lindsay especially,) are having their arms twisted.

944251513785942016 2017-12-22 17:01:18 UTC <denali_sam> Say goodby to your Senate seat @SenDeanHeller . A lot of us will grassroots campaign to defeat you. Your seat, of all Sens. facing re-election, is denoted the most at risk - & that was before you voted yes for the bill that will deprive average Americans of decent healthcare.

Investigate your state laws concerning a recall, start petitions, start a movement. It gets this ON THE TABLE NOW. DO IT!

He's bailing from the heat of trump toxicity so he can run for President in '24 when the toxic fumes cleared & he wasn't there to take heat.https://twitter.com/justinhendrix/status/941360928066547713

If we can browbeat Susan Collins R-Maine to vote no, the R's may just collapse upon themselves. But still, Doug Jones should be seated asap.

It's hard to say if he'll be there to vote next week. Maybe, but they can't presume he will. Rubio has driven a line in the sand to get his vote, Corker has said he's a Nay vote.

941520047771652096 2017-12-14 04:07:26 UTC <denali_sam> @SenatorCollins the operative word in your post is WOULD, not will. You are holding onto a pipe dream that your 'guaranteed agreements' will actually happen. Please reconsider your vote. For evidence, look at Ryan's plan to bail in '18. He won't take on the bill fallout = COWARD.

938611679885217792 2017-12-06 03:30:37 UTC <denali_sam> Franken @alfranken  should ONLY resign after a senate investigation that follows the senate investigations of Roy Moore and Donald Trump,  senate investigations for potentially more explicitly more egregious crimes in their era.

937140035236843521 2017-12-02 02:02:50 UTC <denali_sam> Wow it appears R. Sen Bob Heller, who voted for the odious tax bill, is very nervous about midterm elections.

936919459540869122 2017-12-02 11:26:20 UTC <denali_sam> @realDonaldTrump Sir, with all due respect, you are delusional if you think this bill is great. Oh, yes, yes it is - for your billionaire donors. ONLY.
936918944513789952 2017-12-02 11:24:18 UTC <denali_sam> @realDonaldTrump Tick tick tick tick...mr. president. Yesterday was mostly not merry for you, was it? Mr. Flynn might be your grinch this season.
936917713997279232 2017-12-02 11:19:24 UTC <denali_sam> @BV @RWPUSA @Anon_OMouse Oh yes, there will be repercussions AND Consequences.
936916741883543555 2017-12-02 11:15:32 UTC <denali_sam> @lisamurkowski So you drank the Koolaid. It is a shame you chose to blight your legacy with your YES vote.
936916376031133698 2017-12-02 11:14:05 UTC <denali_sam> Senator @lisamurkowski you have sold out. You have handed over Arctic Natl. Refuge for pillage and assigned impoverishment and lack of health care to Americans nationwide. Your true colours show. You will get hammered out of office next election.
936915378197774337 2017-12-02 11:10:07 UTC <denali_sam> @tribelaw Might this represent clear Taxation Without Representation? No Regular Order, law written by lobbyists at the last minute, no Senatorial review before forced vote? Can we the people sue over this? If not what legal recourse? Thank you for thoughts.

936907379421020160 2017-12-02 10:38:20 UTC <denali_sam> @Demonkatz I'm plowing ahead to investigate if this bill is a legal violation of citizen constitutional rights for Taxation Without Representation. If you want, please pm any advocacy groups you follow that might take up this issue. Sue the congressional fuckers over this bill!

936869361746186241 2017-12-02 08:07:16 UTC <denali_sam> @SenatorTester Thank you for your on camera outrage last evening. I think your frustration & outrage spoke for a majority of Americans who have witnessed regular order in Congress up until this corrupted 'leadership' took office. I'm looking at you @SenateMajLdr.
936867990896746496 2017-12-02 08:01:49 UTC <denali_sam> @SenateMajLdr @SenatorCollins you were played. Your vote in support of this bill will sully your legacy.
936866891255095296 2017-12-01 07:57:27 UTC <denali_sam> Thanks for the suggestions @carlreiner but I plan to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show instead - all five seasons, 158 episodes - this weekend. It always lifts my spirits.
936761882576412673 2017-12-01 01:00:11 UTC <denali_sam> With all due respect @SenatorCollins , who or what made you swallow the Koolaid? You take these assurances from demonstrated liars at face value? You are a Maine resident & demonstrated character regarding all affected by your vote - why this lapse now?
936760471717318658 2017-12-01 00:54:35 UTC <denali_sam> @SenBobCorker @ClareWHarris @aliasvaughn YES!!! Thank You @SenatorCorker for making the humane & civically responsible choice to vote no on this appalling bill.
936758350183895042 2017-12-01 00:46:09 UTC <denali_sam> @SenJohnMcCain @Mikel_Jollett @ZeldaLackner Exactly. Susan Collins @SenatorCollins previously showed sense and humanity. Now she's betraying her record and being played. @SenatorCollins did your Draconian Governor threaten repercussions or something if you vote no? Inquiring minds need to know.
936757193583579137 2017-12-01 00:41:33 UTC <denali_sam> @SenJohnMcCain @MalcolmNance @Mikel_Jollett I've called every R Senator about this bill.  I cannot WAIT to call each of McCain's offices again to ask why a man receiving chemo for cancer wants to sign a bill removing chemo drugs from healthcare coverage for average and poor Americans under this bill. HYPOCRITE.
936755344851783680 2017-12-01 00:34:12 UTC <denali_sam> @Demonkatz Of course that quote was lifted from DL! (an anonymous poster) My 'Ol' Truculence & Tears' was inspired by James Thurber's description of Alexander Woollcott as "Old Vitriol & Violets." I hope I'll be able to alter it to 'Ol Tears & Truculence' soon.
936660917273718784 2017-12-01 18:18:59 UTC <denali_sam> I saw this great description of Flynn's comments today " His statement was a mashup of truculence mixed with tears." Henceforth I will refer to Flynn as Ol' Truculence & Tears.

900188221023416320 2017-08-22 02:49:31 UTC <denali_sam> This is an exercise in watching trump decompensate as he speaks. His disordered mind flails for solid ground. His wrecking ball ego at work.https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/900185951904944128
900185795688005633 2017-08-22 02:39:52 UTC <denali_sam> @RWPUSA @INash The only one who gets along with trump is himself. Those two agree that he's the greatest everything ever and NEVER wrong.
