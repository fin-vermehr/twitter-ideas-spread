898167247922880512 2017-08-17 12:58:53 UTC <fanoftravel17> @realDonaldTrump So much of a "non factor" that YOU NEED his vote to help get your agenda passed
897928866206949376 2017-08-16 21:11:39 UTC <fanoftravel17> @GOP And yet you have DJT as your choice for president. Sad!
897806081073659909 2017-08-16 13:03:44 UTC <fanoftravel17> @POTUS @AnneFrankCenter Unfortunately not a single one

897142654055534592 2017-08-14 17:07:31 UTC <fanoftravel17> @AltHomelandSec And I bet it hurt him to say those words.
897091123188948992 2017-08-14 13:42:45 UTC <fanoftravel17> @realDonaldTrump No comment as to the reason he stepped down?
896515264543547393 2017-08-12 23:34:30 UTC <fanoftravel17> @realDonaldTrump You all know he loves the attention these ppl are giving him, stoking his ego.
896513901457678336 2017-08-12 23:29:05 UTC <fanoftravel17> @realDonaldTrump So sad that you will not condemn White supremacists or Nazi Nationalists.

884576790798192640 2017-07-10 00:55:16 UTC <fanoftravel17> @WhiteHouse Your party @GOP holds the WH and Congress. How is this the Dems fault?
884409530200629248 2017-07-10 13:50:38 UTC <fanoftravel17> @realDonaldTrump So are you admitting YOU are/we're giving away our country?

880448922950541312 2017-06-29 15:32:35 UTC <fanoftravel17> Soooo much better than USA
875713968039264256 2017-06-16 13:57:34 UTC <fanoftravel17> @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP 45 only looks out for himself. He doesn't care about US or U. Realize that soon!
875712935229669376 2017-06-16 13:53:28 UTC <fanoftravel17> @jeffsessions How does it feel being thrown under the bus? & 2 think you lied for 45.

873263175420063744 2017-06-09 19:39:00 UTC <fanoftravel17> @AP This guy will still lie under oath. He'll get away with it just like everything else.

872651033863901185 2017-06-07 03:06:34 UTC <fanoftravel17> @MSNBC @aseitzwald This would NOT fly w/ur everyday person! We'd be charged already.
