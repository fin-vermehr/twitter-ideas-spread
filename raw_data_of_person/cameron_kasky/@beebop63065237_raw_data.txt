So if you check, then you arent reckless.
971872902147690497 2018-03-08 22:18:51 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @dmcmxb @ihavenoidea_x @LordClanricarde You know if someone is kissing you back. And if they seem hesitant, then yes, you should ask. And if you are very drunk such that you might not be picking up cues so well... you should ask.
971870696308641792 2018-03-08 22:10:05 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @dmcmxb @ihavenoidea_x @LordClanricarde If she aint leaning in, man, you gotta check.
971869398402256896 2018-03-08 22:04:55 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @dmcmxb @ihavenoidea_x @LordClanricarde Youll be delighted to hear that false rape claims are extraordinarily rare. Hardly ever happen. So, once you make sure your partner is consenting, theres no need to worry your head about getting arrested at all. Happy days.
971867734718996480 2018-03-08 21:58:19 UTC <beebop63065237> @WellHeyHeather @Declan_Murphy82 Unless, of course, Declan, she was gang-raped after a night out. Which, I think youll find, is criminal behaviour.
971866654652198912 2018-03-08 21:54:01 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Ah yes, jokes. Of course. Of course. Well, if the defendants said it, it must be true.
971865828533702656 2018-03-08 21:50:44 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Assault by penetration, actually. Do try keep up, good man.
971865634748485633 2018-03-08 21:49:58 UTC <beebop63065237> @Gee_McK You, mate. All that name calling and exclamation marks... Youre spitting chips.
971862532846694400 2018-03-08 21:37:38 UTC <beebop63065237> @WellHeyHeather @Declan_Murphy82 Promiscuous behaviour?
971859697178435586 2018-03-08 21:26:22 UTC <beebop63065237> @Gee_McK You should read some literature about sexual assault, it might help you to understand.  And then maybe read something on anger management. It appears that you need it. Peace out, dude.
971859285239062528 2018-03-08 21:24:44 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK You like to think of it as fellatio, but the complainant says it wasnt consensual, and the defendants keep tripping over their stories... Again, WHAT to believe...
971858922129776640 2018-03-08 21:23:17 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Shame they described themselves at top shaggers who pumped brasses and sluts, isnt it? WHAT to believe...
971843823155412992 2018-03-08 20:23:18 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK The evidence said friends of friends, but you like to cherry-pick, so I can see how you missed it.
971843582503026688 2018-03-08 20:22:20 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Yes, I feel certain that all rape victims look their rapists directly in the eye while they are being assaulted. Makes sense. Unless they are literally trying to pretend they are anywhere else on earth so they dont have to think about what is actually happening to them.
971843014103625729 2018-03-08 20:20:05 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Where is the evidence that it didnt?
971842842787270656 2018-03-08 20:19:24 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Where is the evidence that there was no vaginal sex?   With regard to the alleged oral assault, as you well know (since many people have already told you this), fractured memories are extremely common after trauma. So, not so much changing her story as being highly traumatised.
971841805082906624 2018-03-08 20:15:16 UTC <beebop63065237> @WellHeyHeather @Declan_Murphy82 Declan. Sluts, spit-roasting, merry-go-round, brasses, pumped birds, more flutes than July 12...  - none of this sounds untoward to you??!?
971840102023487488 2018-03-08 20:08:30 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK You dont actually know that. I know you want to believe it, but you dont know it.
971839922893148162 2018-03-08 20:07:48 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Yeah, imagine going to a party. With friends of friends. I mean, young people these days, whah??
971839622950146049 2018-03-08 20:06:36 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK None *say* they had vagina sex with her.  If you believe their evidence, but not hers, you have a bias.  Also, you simply cannot believe all the defendants are telling the truth, because they contradict each other.
971839143914426368 2018-03-08 20:04:42 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Where is the evidence that she wasnt?
971838974376497152 2018-03-08 20:04:02 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Gosh, imagine going to... to... a PARTY???!! What was she thinking??!!!  Going to someones bedroom isnt consent.  Asking someone who is raping you to please at least use a condom isnt consent.  You are assuming that it was fellatio and not sexual assault by penetration.
971837912181542914 2018-03-08 19:59:48 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Tell me when you think she lied.
971837715439407105 2018-03-08 19:59:01 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK As opposed to the top shaggers who said they spit-roasted her but then said they never actually had sex with her at all?? 
971837125825056768 2018-03-08 19:56:41 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Mine is based on the actual evidence. Unlike yours.
971836823231229952 2018-03-08 19:55:29 UTC <beebop63065237> @LouMathews @therealdavecurt @AaronWalshh Hi, Aaron!  1. Studies have shown that the most common response to sexual assault is to freeze, not fight.  2. She went upstairs to get her bag.  3. The girl who walked in was only there for seconds, couldnt see the complainants face & didnt speak to her.  Hope that helps!
971834447103344640 2018-03-08 19:46:02 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @StevieC @Gee_McK Glad youve got it now. 
971834115115945984 2018-03-08 19:44:43 UTC <beebop63065237> @WellHeyHeather @Declan_Murphy82 Were the defendants speaking from the heart in their text messages or on the stand? Such a puzzle.
971833706980761600 2018-03-08 19:43:06 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @StevieC @Gee_McK The defendants stories dont match, they contradict each other in several key ways. So if you believe one, you cant believe the others. End of.
971833427669504000 2018-03-08 19:41:59 UTC <beebop63065237> @StevieC @Gee_McK Ive read it. They dont.
971833231338360832 2018-03-08 19:41:12 UTC <beebop63065237> @WellHeyHeather @ScienceSpinning She knows who she is, and she had to go through it. And if she was also gang-raped, can you imagine what an ordeal that cross-examination must have been??
971832294918049794 2018-03-08 19:37:29 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @Gee_McK @StevieC And Im saying that if you believe Olding, that means you think Jackson is lying.
971831946828484608 2018-03-08 19:36:06 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @StevieC @Gee_McK None of the defendants stories tally. Like, at all. So *at least* one of them is deeply mistaken about what went on that night.
971831671585730560 2018-03-08 19:35:00 UTC <beebop63065237> @CaoimhGaga Almost the entire media, throughout this trial, have chosen whatever narrative most favours the defendants, every day. The lack of balance is really striking.
971830771156684805 2018-03-08 19:31:26 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @StevieC @Gee_McK Ah, sure lets just make up stories so. Evidence schmevidence.
971828649761628161 2018-03-08 19:23:00 UTC <beebop63065237> @Beeeethx @cletus_Mc I think were all hoping for justice, Joe.
971827411879948288 2018-03-08 19:18:05 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @mypennysworth @BallyshonogNz And in relation to your how dare you... We both know that even if theyre found guilty, youre still going to think theyre innocent. Lets not kid ourselves.
971827109080510464 2018-03-08 19:16:53 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @mypennysworth @BallyshonogNz If we are talking in hypotheticals, I would say that a woman regretting sex to such an extent that she would put herself (and her family & friends) through the trauma of this process is HIGHLY unlikely.
971825407572967424 2018-03-08 19:10:07 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @mypennysworth @BallyshonogNz In the vast majority of rapes, the man gets away with it.  People have had enough. Thats why they are so interested.
971824296850087939 2018-03-08 19:05:42 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @mypennysworth @BallyshonogNz Yeah, coz getting probes stuck into your privates, having your vagina filmed, getting cross-examined for 8 days, having your knickers shown around a court, and being slagged off in whatsapp groups the length & breadth of the country is way nicer than anyone thinking you had sex.
971823405136793606 2018-03-08 19:02:10 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @mypennysworth @BallyshonogNz I think people are sick of men getting away with raping women.
971822276965552128 2018-03-08 18:57:41 UTC <beebop63065237> @TomWrynne Ched Evans is a shite example, mate.
971820096451735557 2018-03-08 18:49:01 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @BallyshonogNz @mypennysworth Only 37% of sexual assaults are reported, and only a fraction of those get to court.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre received over 12,000 calls in 2016. In Dublin alone.  We have a huge problem with sexual assault in this country, and the lack of support for victims is outrageous.
971818253818490880 2018-03-08 18:41:41 UTC <beebop63065237> @Better_Call_Gub @johnston_evo3 In what way did her underwear contradict her story?
971817595065298944 2018-03-08 18:39:04 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @pmbairrins @StevieC Olding (who had a pickled liver) says she beckoned him over; Jackson says *he* waved at Olding. One of them is wrong.
971816797216366593 2018-03-08 18:35:54 UTC <beebop63065237> @RosannaCooney Thanks, Rosanna. Excellent reporting, youve got way more detail than any other journalist in court, makes it very clear for those of us who arent there!

971797994847825920 2018-03-08 17:21:11 UTC <beebop63065237> @FrankGreaney @TammyLeeMahoney @irelandadvokate @markkelly19831 Actually, youre right, Kate. You can think one of the boys is telling the truth, but you cant think they all are.  So the jury needs to decide which one of them is lying, and therefore didnt have consent.

The complainants is different. Anyone arguing the toss for something they never actually witnessed needs to ask themselves why.
