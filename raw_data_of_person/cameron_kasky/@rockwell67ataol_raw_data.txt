971812784919887872 2018-03-08 18:19:57 UTC <rockwell67ataol> @WhiteHouse @SRuhle I'm glad this 2018 GOP had the guts to pushback- maybe there is hope.
971485408872751104 2018-03-07 20:39:05 UTC <rockwell67ataol> @MSNBC @SenWarren @SRuhle We did, Trump and sycophants did not. He just wants to cash in and let the next admin, assuming we still have a country, clean up after him.
970438236232286210 2018-03-04 23:18:00 UTC <rockwell67ataol> @OrrinHatch @JoyAnnReid He's LDS, so am I, I'm extremely shocked.  I have not done the research but if what you're saying is true then I guess he's not worried about dying in sin.
962033285118361601 2018-02-09 18:39:43 UTC <rockwell67ataol> @SRuhle Sure may confirm my suspicions. The WH is out of hand so I wonder, can we put the horses back in the barn?
