971552941554348032 2018-03-07 01:07:26 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA why do you say so?
971545033353576448 2018-03-07 00:36:01 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat let's hope her passion stays and she continues to grow in football. And that there is a scene for her to grow into in future :)

971357230124605441 2018-03-07 12:09:45 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner @KarlreMarks also interesting to see if there's a link between how people reply to this and whether they're from ex-colonies :)

970860285916364800 2018-03-05 03:15:04 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath I saw that somewhere else when you retweeted it, I think. Yeah, representation is important, but bullying sucks.
970855402697994240 2018-03-05 02:55:40 UTC <icedwater> @kolatubosun I'd like to see this, I hope the Nigerian public are willing to make bestsellers before writers go to foreign publishers :)

970664593004507137 2018-03-05 14:17:27 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @RitaPanahi repeated refutation doesn't make it false.
970583878183211008 2018-03-05 08:56:43 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @Education4Libs it's funny you should say that. Especially since the last mass sex change attack by a 8 year old at a club.
970221950504022017 2018-03-04 08:58:33 UTC <icedwater> @sin_alvin so @wpsg should have abstained or voted yes instead?

969361877946937344 2018-03-01 00:00:56 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon looks like more than half of it is available as frozen veg, which most supermarkets provide.

969105121979191296 2018-02-28 07:00:40 UTC <icedwater> @AMMOakley I find it unlikely that senators would have responded in that vein, or for the governor to change his "inflammatory" approach.
969012602687770625 2018-02-28 00:53:02 UTC <icedwater> @AMMOakley both these issues can be handled, but one of them is more timely than the other.

968500467452923904 2018-02-27 14:57:59 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule is it good faith if you're conflating the two?
968498004465369089 2018-02-27 14:48:12 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule I think there is a difference between perpetrating an act of violence and allowing one to take place, don't you?
968497749787262976 2018-02-27 14:47:12 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule I agreed with the "good guy with a gun" myth. Not the critique of police inaction. Don't make things up.
968484661272850432 2018-02-27 13:55:11 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule and you, equating murder from "scared" cops to neglect of duty from a"scared" guard, are coming from a place of good faith?
968476809653137408 2018-02-27 13:23:59 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule that's because you have nothing to justify yourself with.
968476404479217665 2018-02-27 13:22:22 UTC <icedwater> @40ounceandamule only that much? You're underestimating then.
968367333285748736 2018-02-26 06:08:58 UTC <icedwater> @IPM_Tweets @InternetHippo @40ounceandamule and what have you done to help apart from scoring internet points by bullying a guard?

968291760928579585 2018-02-26 01:08:40 UTC <icedwater> @IPM_Tweets @InternetHippo @40ounceandamule and attacking the guard for incompetence and cowardice is totally going to prevent gun violence?
968291575901036545 2018-02-26 01:07:56 UTC <icedwater> @IPM_Tweets @InternetHippo @40ounceandamule again, false dichotomy. But, whatever.

967760373456584704 2018-02-25 13:57:07 UTC <icedwater> @ciccmaher @dustinreed2 this looks a lot like a shrug to me.pic.twitter.com/0xgfVEoQ0H
967759734508994560 2018-02-25 13:54:35 UTC <icedwater> @ciccmaher @dustinreed2 well, did they?
967755266514042880 2018-02-25 13:36:50 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie lol.
967754998988730370 2018-02-25 13:35:46 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @AudiKhalid a lot of us even know the AR-15 quite well..
967740295973498880 2018-02-25 12:37:20 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards ah, yes. Maybe we need to update the metaphors in use.
967739836827226112 2018-02-25 12:35:31 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hehe 
967738748317282306 2018-02-25 12:31:11 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards what I want is a distributed filesystem that tracks on which system I left which version of which file.
967718168616579073 2018-02-25 11:09:25 UTC <icedwater> @robertsky_ oh, that means today! What was/is it? Break a ... Windpipe? :P
967717647038087169 2018-02-25 11:07:21 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards the contention was that this is self-imposed fluff, though. How do you answer that charge?
967714543920021505 2018-02-25 10:55:01 UTC <icedwater> Thanks for the reminder @guanyinmiao - I couldn't even seek out a guy to try hosting hellofrmsg earlier :(https://twitter.com/guanyinmiao/status/966830717102587904
967713188648071168 2018-02-25 10:49:38 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake yeah, we need to change that first sentence. Unfortunately our appreciation for the arts is in the shadows these days.
967712494465634304 2018-02-25 10:46:52 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie science and the humanities should have more of a symbiotic than a competing relationship, and we should ascribe value to both.
967712063438045185 2018-02-25 10:45:09 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie it used to be "hey they can think, let's hire them" and now it's just "they have been trained for this job"
967710166073294849 2018-02-25 10:37:37 UTC <icedwater> @fortelabs I do this. I agree lol.
967695832353882113 2018-02-25 09:40:40 UTC <icedwater> Another weekend when I should be doing homework but I'm borrowing more books than I can read #fb #nerdlife

967690265694646272 2018-02-25 09:18:32 UTC <icedwater> @yanoak because Burmania is right next to Tanzanitown and Nambia?
967689999805071360 2018-02-25 09:17:29 UTC <icedwater> @DatHurdler_Theo @jfranklin2678 you're right, white people would get away with a lot worse. Also, you went there? Seriously...
967689426036903936 2018-02-25 09:15:12 UTC <icedwater> "today", dammit. If I get a moment to talk to the docent (Hafiz?) to ask him to host @hellofrmSG for a week, I think we'd learn a lot #fb
967681249316823040 2018-02-25 08:42:43 UTC <icedwater> "of", actually. And now I want to watch Singapura di-Langgar Today (1961) LOL #fbpic.twitter.com/stMWizW54S
967680276116602880 2018-02-25 08:38:51 UTC <icedwater> Tales from the Malay world - glad I made it to this exhibition at @NLB on the last day, at least. #fbpic.twitter.com/09A157wfXN
967662538899910657 2018-02-24 07:28:22 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie I think the rigour involved in understanding either is comparable.
967658402007597057 2018-02-24 07:11:55 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie then I think the concept of a "degree" is in sore need of redefinition. It looks like paper for "okay, you can do a job now".
967658069411823617 2018-02-24 07:10:36 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie are there? Whose needs are you referring to?
967657702099845121 2018-02-24 07:09:09 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie they're less valued, have less obvious relevance, and have lower employability in the current landscape. That's not the same.
967657383286644736 2018-02-24 07:07:53 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie or asking a civil engineering graduate to understand why 18th century novels still have value now.
967657054809702400 2018-02-24 07:06:34 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie the assertion that "sciencey" stuff enriches your mind implies that "artsy" stuff doesn't. Or am I missing something?
967656811078680579 2018-02-24 07:05:36 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie it looks that way because science competency is easier to quantify. If you can't build a bridge, you can't build a bridge.
967656199972732928 2018-02-24 07:03:10 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie that's if you only have a short term perspective.
967656049397219329 2018-02-24 07:02:35 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie sure, a lack of historical understanding may not collapse bridges. But you might wind up building bridges that aren't needed.
967653876475183104 2018-02-24 06:53:56 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie does that make them less important? Just because the consequences are not as immediately dire, or keenly felt?
967653631896911873 2018-02-24 06:52:58 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie science courses are more rigorous because they can be: you can benchmark and disprove and grade empirically. Arts, not so much.
967653129549316097 2018-02-24 06:50:58 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie sorry, I drifted. But world-changing tech also needs to work for all humans, be well advertised, and run right as a business.
967652564090085376 2018-02-24 06:48:44 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie as important as tech is in the current climate, it cannot be allowed to grow without its users. Or you get Gattaca.
967652219645341697 2018-02-24 06:47:21 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie lopsided tech focus leads to problems: the Google Gorilla, Kodak(?) not seeing black faces, offices too cold for women...
967651184365285376 2018-02-24 06:43:15 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie so I'm glad other people are doing that for me. As for history, literature, theatre, gender studies, etc, they do inform tech.
967649574860017664 2018-02-24 06:36:51 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie and rightly so. For all the times I casually crap on MBAs I do think of it as a skill set I don't have, nor want to have.
967649106314149888 2018-02-24 06:34:59 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie sure, my engineering undergrad we had classes for business idea development, HR concepts, sociology. But those weren't a focus.
967647616866516992 2018-02-24 06:29:04 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie sure, without technology we would be doing things quite differently. But how many tech folk can/want to do the non-tech stuff?
967647319767236609 2018-02-24 06:27:53 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie arts work requires thought and analysis not easily replaced by simulations and formulae. No mechanical option is able to help.
967645963744460805 2018-02-24 06:22:30 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie okay, fine. I'm sorry I made that statement. Let me re-read your thread objectively.
967645166956761088 2018-02-24 06:19:20 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi heh what's the penguin for?
967642767739334657 2018-02-24 06:09:48 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz heh what questions might you still have? :P
967642192750657536 2018-02-24 06:07:31 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie logic is the domain of sciences alone, and not the arts? Okay.
967642037771104257 2018-02-24 06:06:54 UTC <icedwater> @jd83552473 sure, but then they have the right to object too. That's how free speech works. @KenTremendous @kumailn
967641656857059328 2018-02-24 06:05:23 UTC <icedwater> @TheDailyShow @JMRodri92 it's not a necessary consequence, sure, but now it's up for discussion because the president brought it up.
967641045918892032 2018-02-24 06:02:57 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie Wow. I suppose this @basicnewbie opinion stems from a complete lack of exposure to human thought and experience.https://twitter.com/BasicNewbie/status/966595715693625345
967638514622906370 2018-02-24 05:52:54 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog this is as insensitive and senseless for stray cats as it is for homeless people...

967293853572022273 2018-02-23 07:03:20 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv so poly diploma = uneducated?
967256013177896961 2018-02-23 04:32:58 UTC <icedwater> @CodyHam6 "you're", and yes, I only stay in condos where I'm included. Public conversation, on the other hand...
966938670937747457 2018-02-22 07:31:58 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @amichetti uhm... Context doesn't matter at all in any of your conversations, does it?
966938545486102530 2018-02-22 07:31:28 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @FOXHOUNDER1014 I am not arguing its foundational principles nor disagreeing with them. I am just saying there were fewer guns.
966930947378577408 2018-02-22 07:01:17 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @FOXHOUNDER1014 women and children always had access to guns in their handbags and backpacks?
966929373998727169 2018-02-22 06:55:02 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @FOXHOUNDER1014 as widespread as this? I don't think so.
966929283166826496 2018-02-22 06:54:40 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @amichetti most of the time it's the last.
966929212266364928 2018-02-22 06:54:23 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @amichetti "found" is not the same as "founded".
966903613770498048 2018-02-22 05:12:40 UTC <icedwater> @FOXHOUNDER1014 you think the children of today aren't capable of these thoughts themselves?
966903277374750720 2018-02-22 05:11:20 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @FOXHOUNDER1014 widespread gun ownership may be the status quo, but there was a time before it and it can end.
966902801904185346 2018-02-22 05:09:26 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @amichetti the colonization led directly to the "founding", so I'm not sure where the ignoring part comes in.
966893356700778498 2018-02-22 04:31:54 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @amichetti but pretending that the version of Singapore we're in right now wasn't due in a large part to the British is misleading.
966892508587282432 2018-02-22 04:28:32 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi if my mum made about 15k a month, I'd be asking her for a grant, not the government.
966889768872128512 2018-02-22 04:17:39 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily @mintea hi, may I know how this works? Is it just orange peel or is there more to it?
966888412308389889 2018-02-22 04:12:16 UTC <icedwater> @CodyHam6 well, thanks for describing yourself. :)
966888244452384769 2018-02-22 04:11:36 UTC <icedwater> @darth_punjabi @rickwillams76 yup, history repeats itself. What a pity. We never learn.
966886504587915264 2018-02-22 04:04:41 UTC <icedwater> @johnnyconquest !
966846268810043392 2018-02-22 01:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @darth_punjabi @rickwillams76 built at the expense of the rest of the world and then resold to its inhabitants.
966843430100910080 2018-02-22 01:13:31 UTC <icedwater> More stuff from @fortelabs worth thinking about regarding the evolution of "projects". Will read again later.https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/966036758428184576
966842666469048320 2018-02-22 01:10:29 UTC <icedwater> @darth_punjabi @rickwillams76 I wonder whether the size of the Christian landmass justifies its obsession with Muslims.
966719811894919169 2018-02-22 17:02:18 UTC <icedwater> @AttipoeThywill why do you ask? @eisen
966718073444052992 2018-02-22 16:55:24 UTC <icedwater> @matthiyass an outstanding editor? @AudiKhalid
966717603312889856 2018-02-22 16:53:32 UTC <icedwater> @eisen as the Aussies used to say, "wle I also not from there one you call me up go there mati. siao ah." Now shortened to "go die, meh?"
966716662664671232 2018-02-22 16:49:47 UTC <icedwater> @justinjtlim must have been a terrible vacation... @YusofLatiff1 @eisen @1Obefiend
966716158333169664 2018-02-22 16:47:47 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @MG92_2 I suppose this is to be held up as an example of how progressive Islam can be if Muslims try? Dunno.
966677140665090048 2018-02-22 14:12:44 UTC <icedwater> @longadin then again, by that time GST had already been raised three times...
966676814696398849 2018-02-22 14:11:27 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid still I'll bet the majority of people don't know who he is.

963568670189404165 2018-02-13 00:20:47 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus no, that's not what he said at all. Read it again.
963567105525166080 2018-02-13 00:14:34 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus Bullying others just because you don't agree that "nerds are not bullied" is ridiculous, because that's not even what they said, @diachanyus
963566689718693888 2018-02-13 00:12:55 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus ....again, your ability to read leaves much to be desired.
963566617371160576 2018-02-13 00:12:38 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus #bullying
963563867786813440 2018-02-13 00:01:42 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus also, did you read all 46 tweets he split across two threads?
963563721086844928 2018-02-13 00:01:07 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus he acknowledges later on that bullying does occur, as it is happening here :)
963560645353381888 2018-02-13 23:48:54 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid sure but what's wrong with just learning the language because?
963559195655127042 2018-02-13 23:43:08 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty #PetGiey
963558470552203264 2018-02-13 23:40:16 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus show me the tweet where he says that.
963555572963422209 2018-02-13 23:28:45 UTC <icedwater> @5828888 are profits from shares taxed? Should they be?
963554849831845889 2018-02-13 23:25:52 UTC <icedwater> @GSpellchecker @fiascopithecus hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.... Ha. @danarel what's a government that doesn't run itself...? Oh right.
963554165677899776 2018-02-13 23:23:09 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako stop breaking please  we're already broken 
963551824455262208 2018-02-13 23:13:51 UTC <icedwater> @Gizmodo @MikeMcc55 so nobody ever died trying to fly like Superman, is what you're saying
963550214295453697 2018-02-13 23:07:27 UTC <icedwater> @Diachanyus douchebaggery is not a good look, stop it before it's too late.
963547972045701120 2018-02-13 22:58:33 UTC <icedwater> @Gizmodo @RedCarConspiraC tired: white people one second out of the spotlight
963547872678440960 2018-02-13 22:58:09 UTC <icedwater> @Gizmodo @MikeMcc55 neither are the other superhero movies, and you probably had no issues there
963546985037889536 2018-02-13 22:54:37 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim @mdnoorhadi @yazbanz @dazhan14 that said, of course, we keep letting people watch for free in other stadia, so we're all out.
963262735688482816 2018-02-12 04:05:07 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim @yazbanz @dazhan14 should be, since apparently @mdnoorhadi was the only one to actually check :p
963071350595239936 2018-02-12 15:24:37 UTC <icedwater> @tanwumeng it seems these days due to our success we dare not... - as a matter of survival. @PAPSingapore @our_sg

963043814754537472 2018-02-12 13:35:12 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA nothing wrong! Those are the two countries Trump likes ;)
963038467813818370 2018-02-12 13:13:57 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim @dazhan14 and Tampines could have helped get theirs ready...
963037473331822593 2018-02-12 13:10:00 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I still haven't learned a reliable double tie.... :P
963031591776694274 2018-02-12 12:46:38 UTC <icedwater> @downey @hrheingold but bots provide utility as well. How do you legislate for that?
962958193830674432 2018-02-11 07:54:58 UTC <icedwater> @remusdevinkoh :( just add one. Jacket already included. #lightitupmaaaaaaaannnn
962917411446927361 2018-02-11 05:12:55 UTC <icedwater> @zeynep @woolypixel yeah, also if you aren't on Facebook you probably have friends who put your photos there anyway...
962898543101947904 2018-02-11 03:57:57 UTC <icedwater> @carrotoh @endorphynn @ofmeowandbake @tanhuiyi well it does depend on the layout. Sometimes the king size bed costs 12" cupboard space.

962748952876531712 2018-02-11 18:03:32 UTC <icedwater> @mentalmillenni1 what about supporting the role models fiction can create instead of  continuing to shit on non-whites?
962707085937983488 2018-02-11 15:17:10 UTC <icedwater> @CarlMinzner @yun_aus this looks really messy...
962705432455168000 2018-02-11 15:10:35 UTC <icedwater> @CarlMinzner @yun_aus what was Gui Minhai's crime in the first place? #googles
962705247645851649 2018-02-11 15:09:51 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I think this is quite a different claim at face value, right. Just like how we get to prosecute drug traffickers.
962702472367063040 2018-02-11 14:58:50 UTC <icedwater> @mintea tweetup for yusheng? :P
962701183696625664 2018-02-11 14:53:42 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz here we go again.
962700784675651586 2018-02-11 14:52:07 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz still true nonetheless.
962700672406704128 2018-02-11 14:51:41 UTC <icedwater> @DubsterCali oh, let's build a wall around Hollywood and blame those there then. @NBCBLK
962699058081972229 2018-02-11 14:45:16 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @fariskassim @dazhan14 why is this FAS' fault when Tampines also knew they would be playing in AFC since November?
962615818503639040 2018-02-11 09:14:30 UTC <icedwater> @Ms_Wire yup that's where I'd ask :p admittedly I'm spoiled by cheap quick broadband access so I would wiki the menu too :p
962539842545438721 2018-02-10 04:12:36 UTC <icedwater> @Ms_Wire For me, exotic ingredients are interesting and I'd try unless I was allergic to them. I suppose it'd frustrate hungry folks though?
962538150433181696 2018-02-10 04:05:52 UTC <icedwater> @MarvinPolitics is it hard to pay women and men working the same job the same? Is gender distribution by sector relevant here? @miraxpath
962529886727389184 2018-02-10 03:33:02 UTC <icedwater> @ericJrOmg you need to realise that not all hacking is for criminal purposes. @fail0verflow
962525350059155456 2018-02-10 03:15:00 UTC <icedwater> @qzafrica @kolatubosun @YinkaWrites wow, if this estimate is correct, about 40% of the languages in the world are in Africa!

962013924026548225 2018-02-09 17:22:47 UTC <icedwater> @eisen if you think it's so 2 years ago, it probably is. Might just have taken that long for budget approvals to go through ;)

961620033074995201 2018-02-08 15:17:36 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @tanhuiyi @omgitsjn excuse you. #BBBuddy is for Bukit Batok OK.
961616506533523457 2018-02-08 15:03:35 UTC <icedwater> @WWE @TheGoalFather10 it can surely "make history" and still be as destructive and feared as it was before. It's up to @wwe to sell it.
961058527497273344 2018-02-06 02:06:23 UTC <icedwater> @zup4girl that is a start. Could you explain why you think he's not the answer, please? @anupartanen
961057750481494016 2018-02-06 02:03:17 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv that first part is difficult to eliminate, I think.
961018388028903424 2018-02-06 23:26:53 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath @MG92_2 hmm, so "voluntary" in this case is really internalised coercion, then?
960793823218552833 2018-02-06 08:34:32 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 that's where you and I differ. I don't think anything justifies that demeaning feature.

960739804806656000 2018-02-05 04:59:53 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 I'm pretty sure that's an overly broad generalisation. Nothing justifies those designs on public facilities.

960518274487238656 2018-02-05 14:19:36 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA I thought it was just "cannot make it"... Haha looks like maybe I'm missing something ;)

960508904089124864 2018-02-05 13:42:22 UTC <icedwater> @eisen don't try the tide pod challenge please.
960508573192089600 2018-02-05 13:41:03 UTC <icedwater> @engineersftw hmm is right.
960432078721499136 2018-02-05 08:37:06 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 all I see is you name calling. One can complain that something is unjust without being able to personally solve it.
960375963845517312 2018-02-04 04:54:07 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 "anti-homeless architecture sucks" "you should house all the homeless" is a more logical response?
960375807611777024 2018-02-04 04:53:30 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA what, that's Thailand what :p
960374222705999872 2018-02-04 04:47:12 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 I'm done letting your straw man stand. I don't have to house any myself.
960329725116755969 2018-02-04 01:50:23 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 I could have asked you the same :)
960297706227777536 2018-02-04 23:43:09 UTC <icedwater> @mrbrown @jasminechoe_ indeed. Timbre+ started tray deposits over a year ago at one-north. Within days people had figured out a workaround 
960277220898979840 2018-02-04 22:21:45 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 do you not know what a queue is?
960178771784421377 2018-02-04 15:50:33 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @dcatdemon next time tweet in Singlish no need scared one. It doesn't exclude one from using Singapore English either.
960074033592115200 2018-02-04 08:54:21 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty yup. I wonder if there will be time to develop more women talent to make the next #RoyalRumble less about returns...
960073537443647488 2018-02-04 08:52:23 UTC <icedwater> @chezevo @tanhuiyi @omgitsjn I dunno.... Maybe  #obscuresleaguereferences #anyhowlysay
960068778473095169 2018-02-04 08:33:28 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv are you arguing with yourself, or realizing a mistake?
960063990276620288 2018-02-04 08:14:27 UTC <icedwater> @ChessIsFun143 I'm sure people with access to toilets will not use them.
960026599025344513 2018-02-03 05:45:52 UTC <icedwater> @alvations I was going to say no, but I realised that would have been backprop ;)
960016821481951232 2018-02-03 05:07:01 UTC <icedwater> I do hope she gets a better job that doesn't require a trade-off of her dignity...https://twitter.com/LiarMPs/status/959199636052361216
960014596936314880 2018-02-03 04:58:10 UTC <icedwater> @PangurBanC thanks for the recommendation, but it's still irrelevant. @SimonParkin @joshtpm
959832134021103617 2018-02-03 16:53:08 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan btw, Hindi "kanoon" is from Arabic " (qnn)", from Ancient Greek " (cann)" which via Latin gave English "canon".
959828564009918464 2018-02-03 16:38:57 UTC <icedwater> @chezevo @omgitsjn @tanhuiyi please use Queenstown English.
959757474340388864 2018-02-03 11:56:27 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog @SirAfiqah I'd support that, I suppose. But if we went for the intersection of everything we'd wind up just drinking water.
959708575747653632 2018-02-03 08:42:09 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi orh. I didn't look at the admission ticket at all. But then $40 for that package includes admission with the travel cost too?
959685323780321281 2018-02-02 07:09:45 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hmm I must be missing something then, because it looks like kid pays $35; adult caregiver must go + pay $40. So it's $75 or $0?
959684765472321537 2018-02-02 07:07:32 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn ah OK. WordPress is different, depends on what the theme you're using allows you to do. Ad hoc hacking is fine but gets messy.
959681115291230208 2018-02-02 06:53:02 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi haha well then $75 if you'd gone with that sort of package vs whatever your taxi would have cost :p But yeah friends is a plus.
959641120622854144 2018-02-02 04:14:07 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi it says at least one adult caregiver must go, not only one leh.
959635233602617344 2018-02-02 03:50:43 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi but if you take the offer and both of you go with Beng, you'd have to pay $115 for transport.
959634779053350912 2018-02-02 03:48:55 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn please don't use inline CSS if you can help it; add a class and throw the styles into an external file. Can you upload new files?
959633143689969666 2018-02-02 03:42:25 UTC <icedwater> I searched for intercultural meetups after asking @SirAfiqah if they knew, and I came across this. I don't even... https://www.interact-experts.com/en/intercultural-communication/intercultural-communication-asia/intercultural-communication-singapore/
959631928373624832 2018-02-02 03:37:35 UTC <icedwater> @SirAfiqah thanks for sharing. I wonder if you happen to know of any intercultural events along these lines? I'm an atheist.  @crapstacular
959631511770185728 2018-02-02 03:35:56 UTC <icedwater> @SirAfiqah @Inbarajs on a similar note, I guess it's strange we don't see Hindus objecting to the beef sold at Subway or McDonald's.
959630743990255616 2018-02-02 03:32:53 UTC <icedwater> @SirAfiqah I'm in the majority, but I'm not certain that series of implications is valid. I could object to halal food (I don't) without objecting to Muslims or low- to middle-class people. I guess intersecting examples exist which support you, but to generalise that...
959628713104060416 2018-02-02 03:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn did you solve this?
959547992100319232 2018-02-02 22:04:03 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo hey!!! r u talking bout me???!?!!!
959443767991218177 2018-02-02 15:09:54 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi you can say you're Tay Huiyu and some actress stole your name to become famous.

958306104139640833 2018-01-30 11:49:14 UTC <icedwater> @melster1969 it means @JulianAssange is deliberately being cryptic to create distracting drama. @SeanHannity__ @seanhannity

956439799740551168 2018-01-25 08:13:12 UTC <icedwater> @CynthiaLIVE hello! To what do I owe this honour?
956293760048029696 2018-01-24 22:32:54 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue Yup true :)
956192126412382210 2018-01-24 15:49:02 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo I suppose. With banks if you have enough money something can be worked out. But for books, 
956191699960672257 2018-01-24 15:47:21 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo yeah that's a framing I can live with I suppose. Yet it does assume Singaporeans are less likely to  (true for now)
956189989406035968 2018-01-24 15:40:33 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo Agreed, but the library fee is a valid point, I think, regardless of who raised it and why.
956189599625129989 2018-01-24 15:39:00 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo Also compared to utilities/HDB subsidy, free/token library membership is quite an insignificant thing to quibble about. I wouldn't equate them. Just wondering if there needs to be a fee at all for tax residents.
956188934958022656 2018-01-24 15:36:21 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo No, I mean, I agree entitlement = you feel you deserve x and y or more than what you're getting, but I'm asking in general, how to align "deserves" and "paid" if this is possible or desirable. Not putting words in anyone's mouth.
956184415398330368 2018-01-24 15:18:24 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue but it's like in Germany when Japanese restaurants are run by Vietnamese. You still want sushi/ramen as authentic as possible?
956182928790179840 2018-01-24 15:12:29 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I would say this is a normal relationship; my hunch for languages is consumption is easier to master than production.
956182420608315392 2018-01-24 15:10:28 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo Not friend per se, just chatted a few times before. I'm more curious about how/where to draw the line with attitudes to "what I deserve" for "what I paid". Or the answer is "got any also good enough already, don't complain"?
956181362100264960 2018-01-24 15:06:16 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo I suppose. But then how would you know what is deserved or not if you pay tax as a foreigner here?
956180838969847809 2018-01-24 15:04:11 UTC <icedwater> @LUFC bit early for April Fool's...
956151833646440448 2018-01-24 13:08:56 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo in Germany you get some benefits, like unemployment. Also library access is a small thing either way.
956146940676198400 2018-01-24 12:49:29 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @whyvo I suppose it's not that it's not affordable, it's the barrier that is the problem? I suppose she's a tax resident.
956127802591404032 2018-01-24 11:33:26 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish Hehe yeah but it's quite versatile and expressive. Keeps improving also. :)
956122833716785154 2018-01-24 11:13:42 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish voice, improvisation, writing?
956121334907482117 2018-01-24 11:07:44 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn nope. That reads the thoughts, but the thoughts have to be made in the first place. Although over time generation is possible :p

954659129485770752 2018-01-20 10:17:27 UTC <icedwater> @virginangelic I guess it is, but it's easier to recommend within the bubble that social media creates. You get an impression that your reach is amplified but where it is amplified to is seldom checked.

953978329501085696 2018-01-18 13:12:12 UTC <icedwater> @shappers_uk I can't believe you think that settles the debate. Like there is only one acceptable definition of merit. @DVATW @neiljhk

953826056728756224 2018-01-17 03:07:07 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW @neiljhk @LibbyRafferty that's absurd. You should quit while you're behind.

953774404051202048 2018-01-17 23:41:52 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW @neiljhk I seriously doubt there are such "parasites" in sufficient number to cause a problem.

952595553606516736 2018-01-14 17:37:33 UTC <icedwater> @jalbertbowdenii Should we avoid Amazon, Facebook, and Google, then?

950925157903695872 2018-01-09 02:59:59 UTC <icedwater> @ohnips take care of yourself, either way :)
950875692991889408 2018-01-09 23:43:26 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname rubbish! Though of course I'm not going to force you if you don't want it.

950749152215891968 2018-01-09 15:20:36 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako thanks! I wonder if we'll hear anything from @FASingapore. From @officialdpmmfc, I won't hold my breath, the account seems dead.

950256384045494274 2018-01-07 06:42:31 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if @hellofrmSG can help get more responses here.https://twitter.com/JuriaTRM/status/949536556263469057

950231754052288512 2018-01-07 05:04:39 UTC <icedwater> @firkas @JoseRaymond @coachkhairul Maybe :) so I gather you feel the same way about Mirko?
950221679354982400 2018-01-07 04:24:37 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH one of our prolonged ills has been looking for immediate cures. #sgfootball

950185619354865664 2018-01-07 02:01:19 UTC <icedwater> @BroPug @necropants True, though that's quite different from D&D and it's definitely my own preference :)

950171822741336064 2018-01-07 01:06:30 UTC <icedwater> @firkas @JoseRaymond Yes, that doesn't make it right. The instances you mentioned are not just either, but what do they have to do with Mirko applying for a job and getting hired?
950170687859290112 2018-01-07 01:01:59 UTC <icedwater> @firkas @JoseRaymond so he should not be allowed to get a job because he decided to stop being a Singaporean?
950168110299885568 2018-01-07 00:51:45 UTC <icedwater> @JoseRaymond do you support, for instance, @firkas getting a job in the Thai League? How is that different?https://twitter.com/tocsg/status/949172627373019136
950167230129487872 2018-01-07 00:48:15 UTC <icedwater> @necropants @BroPug actually, if I had miniatures I wanted to move around, I'd have gone with painted boards rather than 3D shrubbery.

949999700173758464 2018-01-07 13:42:33 UTC <icedwater> @SingPost Nah don't worry about it. I haven't had problems. Just being glib. Keep addressing your other issues please :)
949998497486356480 2018-01-07 13:37:46 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao Maybe, or shamelessly glossing over errors. LOL never mind :p
949974190697758721 2018-01-07 12:01:11 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @firkas @coachkhairul @yazbanz I don't like rushing results too, but for fans, parents, players, wins are easier to accept?
949968659979489281 2018-01-07 11:39:12 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @firkas @coachkhairul To be sure, I don't like lopsided games, but neither am I expecting coaches to field 12s in a U14 league. I want to avoid teams of only 12-year-olds, 13-, etc who will not have much to learn from each other vs e.g. 14-16 in one team. Core can stay on 1 year to pass on club style.
949967048913821697 2018-01-07 11:32:48 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @firkas @coachkhairul I think there is merit to having players of different age groups and levels of experience play together as a team which year-by-year leagues will eliminate. It might "halve" the pool but get better players.
949965034163118081 2018-01-07 11:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao "Heh".
949964105862995968 2018-01-07 11:21:06 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul @firkas sure, so maybe have two-year bands for leagues to let players stay together longer?
949963426918318080 2018-01-07 11:18:25 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @colinctc when @SingPost has converted its centre into a shopping mall, maybe we need to worry. :P
949962840814755840 2018-01-07 11:16:05 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao that's how new words are coined tbh
949962659868241921 2018-01-07 11:15:22 UTC <icedwater> @baconbkk @nontgor damn it. I knew mud wrestling was more interesting than it looked!
949894740744351744 2018-01-06 06:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul hello it's me again. Just realised - is school or sports education the better model to adopt here? @SazaliAbdulAziz
949855716172472325 2018-01-06 04:10:24 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid Thankfully you are safe! I bet that's a mistake you won't be repeating any time soon :P

949703184703897600 2018-01-06 18:04:18 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul Ah, I neglected your last sentence. But let me see if I can find something tomorrow :) There are other issues with our conveyor belt schools anyway.
949702883972272129 2018-01-06 18:03:06 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul Go to a poly or a university :)
949700500240269313 2018-01-06 17:53:38 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul I'll continue thinking about this in the morning. Maybe we can meet for coffee sometime? :)
949700182169370624 2018-01-06 17:52:22 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul Thanks for your time. I'd love to be able to observe more. And I agree, the balance needs to be struck.
949698923966287872 2018-01-06 17:47:22 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul I'm just not sure splitting age groups down to each year will give the best pool, or larger = better.
949698017493319680 2018-01-06 17:43:46 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul I know where you're coming from, but do you need U12 and U13 leagues when you can field eg U13 sides that are mostly 11?
949697156851515392 2018-01-06 17:40:21 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul FIFA doesn't develop players. But they organise the competitions that age groups take part in, so aligning them makes sense to me.
949693731602497536 2018-01-06 17:26:44 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul I don't know for sure. But I think two- or three-year bands is a good compromise, say U13, U16, U19, U22? Or just in line with FIFA?
949692584921784321 2018-01-06 17:22:11 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn lol oh wait
949690937847922688 2018-01-06 17:15:38 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul of course, but how often are kids ahead of the curve?
949690756565950465 2018-01-06 17:14:55 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv tweets appearing randomly on your screen, four days late and completely out of context. ;)
949688893225365506 2018-01-06 17:07:31 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul It's related: if you have age group pools per year, then you don't have senior/junior on the field. All are 11, 12, 13, etc.
949685610482053120 2018-01-06 16:54:28 UTC <icedwater> @SazaliAbdulAziz @coachkhairul what guidance can 10 year olds give other 10 year olds on the pitch? How much must coaches shout?
949322564593053701 2018-01-05 16:51:51 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn @eisen indeed. My answer would have been "who cares?" But then that could well cause problems end Jan. ;)
949103006070423553 2018-01-04 02:19:24 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I see. While we shouldn't write off any attempt to participate, I think you'd have seen that not all participation is equal.
949095907466756096 2018-01-04 01:51:12 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty get Earl Hebner in!
949095499902083073 2018-01-04 01:49:35 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn because it's not bigger. Good morning.

948955936873328640 2018-01-04 16:35:00 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @AlastairJT not mutually exclusive. How insecure do you have to be to keep banging away at Corbyn?
948955323481534465 2018-01-04 16:32:34 UTC <icedwater> @fortelabs what makes you think others reading the same books as you will glean the same insights?
948951193006481411 2018-01-04 16:16:09 UTC <icedwater> @JamesDelingpole would you rather the West have to fight to restore civilization too? It's not far away, you know. @neiljhk
948877898944925698 2018-01-04 11:24:55 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @spikedonline this is like watching snow fall and saying global warming is untrue. False equivalence.
948844708079452160 2018-01-04 09:13:01 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if there is a way to make a to-do list out of such tweets... I mean, I know there can be, but is there? #fbhttps://twitter.com/icedwater/status/947842112501956608
948764450965745664 2018-01-03 03:54:06 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I wonder if the one who replied to the tweet you quoted is a bot. Singapore-ish interests but 24/48 follows are US-related :)
948725842741374976 2018-01-03 01:20:42 UTC <icedwater> @sarahbennetto you should so have stopped and thought twice.

948581725851893760 2018-01-03 15:48:01 UTC <icedwater> @diebestimmerin hmm. That reply was weird. You seem to have deleted the tweet about resolving not to speak German for as long as possible.

948344876868935680 2018-01-02 00:06:52 UTC <icedwater> @A_Liberty_Rebel @neiljhk Where are the latter group, though? And does wearing the hijab have the same connotations in either society?
948340192812843008 2018-01-02 23:48:15 UTC <icedwater> @A_Liberty_Rebel @neiljhk That sounds like a reasonable definition, but I don't see where any of us gets to pronounce who is a "real" feminist and who isn't.

947848386849337344 2018-01-01 15:14:00 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon Yep. I'm asking about this year. :P
947847947437223936 2018-01-01 15:12:15 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon hope it's starting to get a little warmer out :) -4 is OK, how's the wind?
947845261102952448 2018-01-01 15:01:35 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul I wonder if the draft model that the US uses might come in handy too? Alongside youth pipelines, pull from schools directly.
947842112501956608 2018-01-01 14:49:04 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily @whyvo good point, but now I feel like I should start on a Singlish corpus with word usage frequency in popular culture. Thanks!
947836194347393024 2018-01-01 14:25:33 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily @whyvo Yeah there's a confusion between Singlish and Hokkien+English, probably due to #ChinesePrivilege ;)
947807610945748993 2018-01-01 12:31:58 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily okay, but what about Singlish?
947799960312881157 2018-01-01 12:01:34 UTC <icedwater> @kingkongfrog correct. Trump became president because not enough people cared. @wilfredchan @nytimes
947799100677808129 2018-01-01 11:58:09 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @ChaseAdam17 okay, but is this an edge case that is hard to replicate elsewhere?
947798740328374272 2018-01-01 11:56:43 UTC <icedwater> @m4riannelee @dcatdemon my desk is always neat. I cannot say the same for the things on it, though... :P
947798362765406208 2018-01-01 11:55:13 UTC <icedwater> @ajcdeane professionals aren't entitled to personal and sometimes even irrational comment. Okay, noted. @neiljhk @MarksSimon
947796681873006592 2018-01-01 11:48:32 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv then again, "best" is subject to the same issues as meritocracy in other fields; first movers and large companies have privilege.

946731702440706048 2017-12-29 13:16:41 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice I don't know, I guess @kosherjellyfish is right.
946598685990731776 2017-12-28 04:28:08 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice but how appropriate is appropriate at work? What habits should we be allowing and what not?

946245755383062528 2017-12-27 05:05:43 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai @bargeboards I've always wanted to go but it never really made sense to order steamed fish alone. When do we eat?

946177398612959232 2017-12-27 00:34:05 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @pakhead is it really a colour obsession, or is that a neatly-manufactured straw man?
946176536431833088 2017-12-27 00:30:40 UTC <icedwater> @cameo good on you for thinking out with the box :)
946035755473780737 2017-12-27 15:11:15 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Hehe. Your prerogative. So many other people and things I'd rather talk about. :P
946031680069951488 2017-12-27 14:55:03 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Yup, agreed. I just try to steer the conversation to another topic.
946031098429022208 2017-12-27 14:52:44 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Yup which is why I agreed with you but I'm also talking more about it, though I sense it may be a good time to stop.
946030469644087296 2017-12-27 14:50:15 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity I don't like to hear from him either, but reporting him to the police isn't what I would do.
946030329101410305 2017-12-27 14:49:41 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Well, it *was* edited in. I suppose he should have lopped off the rest of the blob of words then, to be more consistent.
946029472595062784 2017-12-27 14:46:17 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Lol yeah OK I didn't like that either but I guess his point was that caterpillars need to be given time to grow, if there was one?
946029221079429120 2017-12-27 14:45:17 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity yup. It's just thinking out loud, isn't it. I don't see where he claims that was cogent or coherent.
946028837376110593 2017-12-27 14:43:45 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity Besides, he does hedge with the admission he's circling around the (some) point, and "I think" "almost necessarily" repeatedly signals uncertainty. You're also jumping at "99%" and "necessarily".
946027800242282496 2017-12-27 14:39:38 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity That's okay. But I like that he's actually writing it out for feedback.
946027132672655361 2017-12-27 14:36:59 UTC <icedwater> @chezevo we have not met. But "Friends in high places" is such an appropriate username for responding to that picture. @omgitsjn @tanhuiyi
946024381167239168 2017-12-27 14:26:03 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity you're right. But why?
945944143171223552 2017-12-27 09:07:13 UTC <icedwater> @tiellover aren't you asking for free contributions to your article? You could be a little more polite, in my opinion.
945919286903586816 2017-12-26 07:28:26 UTC <icedwater> Does anyone have photos of their birds eating wheatgrass which I may use in an article on wheatgrass? Thanks! #fixed https://twitter.com/tiellover/status/945838992905269248
945918640544559104 2017-12-26 07:25:52 UTC <icedwater> OK, from http://www.indigo.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Public_AY2018-Timetable_20171221.pdf and 7am classes are only for JC2 GP (RI, Sat) & JC1 GP (HCI, Sun) so it's not that bad; still not good. #fb
945909390556532736 2017-12-26 06:49:07 UTC <icedwater> @_shalomc does it do polls and 280 characters?
945850981786329089 2017-12-26 02:57:01 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I don't doubt that they've done their research or are responding to demand. I checked their schedules for 2018 and found only GP classes held at RI/HCI for those time slots. More questions to be answered, mostly "why", but yeah it is sad.
945817836672266240 2017-12-26 00:45:19 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao thanks!
945815787243106304 2017-12-26 00:37:10 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Manish_05Singh for starters, is it a family of 7 or do they have 7 children? What was the estate like when they moved in in 2002?
945814093805510657 2017-12-26 00:30:26 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao Could you please ask why, maybe?
945813043438432256 2017-12-26 00:26:16 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Manish_05Singh Then again, if they only earn 7 an hour, that's probably all they can afford. Many questions here.
945810146973773824 2017-12-26 00:14:45 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Manish_05Singh but then the refugee family would be out on the streets, I suppose. Though 15 years is a long time.

945568436632956928 2017-12-26 08:14:17 UTC <icedwater> thanks for bearing with us in your mentions too!
945568218340397056 2017-12-26 08:13:25 UTC <icedwater> @cheeaun got place for one more at tonight's kopi/Ruby? Did anyone pull out?
945514450345279494 2017-12-25 04:39:46 UTC <icedwater> @KarlreMarks @ARCRooksmoor that's terrible. We need to counter these edits if they are true.
945513942456999942 2017-12-25 04:37:45 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @RedDot_Oz that's also a problematic response...
945513785405538304 2017-12-25 04:37:07 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi that's terrible. Let's help to spread humility and enjoyment of our home :)
945512097894490112 2017-12-25 04:30:25 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz Not defending paratroopers, but "some consultants suggesting" is not the same as "the worst case is".
945475397654683648 2017-12-25 02:04:35 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @JackPosobiec so all elections that Russia could have interfered in must have been meddled with?
945474614796328960 2017-12-25 02:01:28 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline No no, you didn't spoil it for me. Already watched twice, hence the agreement. Admittedly I forgot/ignored the hashtag & warning. But your thread was not possible to mute since there was no hashtag in it., I think.
945473125424046080 2017-12-25 01:55:33 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian however,  it's easy to trust those who posture, and trust is problematic because it reduces the urge to verify.
945458301776510976 2017-12-25 00:56:39 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian I'm sorry for responding the way I did, and I'm glad we had these discussions. Thanks for your patience.
945457431907201024 2017-12-25 00:53:12 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian At least in my readings up till now. I'd completely misread what your "it" resolved to, which was why I read your tweet as rubbish.
945456957724401664 2017-12-25 00:51:19 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Which is ... Nothing like what you asserted initially.
945455484651192320 2017-12-25 00:45:27 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Such as attempting to make you re-read your initial statement, which I personally find no sense in. Which Israel lobby would be pleased that someone affirms the UN resolution asserting that they don't get to call the shots about Jerusalem?
945453523159756800 2017-12-25 00:37:40 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian "I'm better than you confused folk because I can handle complexity," crowed he who was absolutely not posturing, "I'm unsure of that because everybody knows certainty is a sign of a feeble mind."
945452611381051392 2017-12-25 00:34:02 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Then maybe it's time we voted who we can trust instead of those who posture best.
945450974608424960 2017-12-25 00:27:32 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Besides the distraction we've been having on the side, your original utterance makes no sense.
945450362579722240 2017-12-25 00:25:06 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian And why not?
945448729888178176 2017-12-25 00:18:37 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian And yet you are sufficiently sure of your opinion that these are illusions, or you wouldn't have posted it publicly.
945447142037995520 2017-12-25 00:12:18 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Again, I already asserted that you were unsure, and obviously I don't trust you either, so I'm not sure what your posturing is supposed to be for.
945446137254764544 2017-12-25 00:08:19 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian really? Are you sure anyone who is sure of anything is "feeble-minded"? And why should you be trusted in that case?
945442689922711552 2017-12-25 23:54:37 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian So you are prepared to blather on about something which you are unsure of. Interesting.
945436993340579840 2017-12-25 23:31:59 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian And yet you were yourself sure of your point.
945434885749010432 2017-12-25 23:23:36 UTC <icedwater> @JamieGlazov They are, actually.
945434220419096576 2017-12-25 23:20:58 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian Still applies. How can you be sure you're not making something up that nobody else can verify?
945432569780232192 2017-12-25 23:14:24 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian I'm pretty sure not everybody knows that.
945418316037865472 2017-12-25 22:17:46 UTC <icedwater> @grayhatter completely unlike what you're doing now, that riding actually produces something of value.
945417961380052992 2017-12-25 22:16:21 UTC <icedwater> @BhairavAcharya Thanks @bhairavacharya @skchinmayi - it's time to prepare for this on Twitter. I'm sure johnchan42826215 works.https://twitter.com/BhairavAcharya/status/944608371503611905

945297988590518272 2017-12-25 14:19:37 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline agreed with some. But clearly you don't care enough to give spoiler warnings :p Or should people mute you after the hashtag?
945296285627596800 2017-12-25 14:12:51 UTC <icedwater> @fzz87 no problem! Next time then :)

943751071821733890 2017-12-20 07:52:44 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo @singnoname I think it will suffer in the short run. I hope the fixed time makes it easier for people to attend in future.
943470400083595264 2017-12-20 13:17:26 UTC <icedwater> @mahbubani_k also clickbait. Sigh. @RedDot_Oz

943334567175319553 2017-12-19 04:17:41 UTC <icedwater> @zephyraine @mintea well, because not enough people do things that they are interested in, interesting things can't put food on the table :p
943330069509849088 2017-12-19 03:59:49 UTC <icedwater> @zephyraine @mintea we should encourage more people to follow their interests :)

943068477731905536 2017-12-19 10:40:21 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya eh, it's criticising the content being cosplayed, I would think :p
943043002162802690 2017-12-19 08:59:07 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya ...no, but the act of cosplay itself isn't the problem, is it?
943039216400793600 2017-12-19 08:44:04 UTC <icedwater> @KellynnWee @guanyinmiao yeah me too! And "closed" BTO FB groups that let in the odd contractor or designer.
943032205189701632 2017-12-19 08:16:13 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya also, I am probably wrong about blondeness (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HairColorInJapan) but Euros came in the 16th c.
943030354021040128 2017-12-19 08:08:51 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya when I said "unfortunately", I meant you were wrong that cosplay couldn't be Euro-centric.
943021764795232257 2017-12-18 07:34:43 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya anime is filled with Euro-centric content, there are many blonde protagonists, for instance.
943013383678214144 2017-12-18 07:01:25 UTC <icedwater> @ShinySilver3 @TheSafestSpace @DuneSlaya it is, unfortunately, since when Japan opened itself to the world, Europe called first and loudest.
943001846053928960 2017-12-18 06:15:34 UTC <icedwater> Would it have been warranted, necessary, feasible, or even done? #counterfactuals https://twitter.com/StirringTrouble/status/942541384480722945

942768611898228737 2017-12-18 14:48:47 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @iealondon maybe the magnitude of those benefits was imagined...
942767667491909633 2017-12-18 14:45:02 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH I think for some football is just a shell game.

942766709429084161 2017-12-18 14:41:13 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako out of the way? It's near Jurong East interchange and a Madhu Mohana throw in can probably hit the platform from the stadium 
942765806613495808 2017-12-18 14:37:38 UTC <icedwater> @AlaskaFiscal you'll notice they've been together for 49 years since. I'd charitably assume he's learned since then.
942726182738395136 2017-12-18 12:00:11 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA LOL!
942707040345927682 2017-12-18 10:44:07 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I wonder if it would be fair to LiveJournal if we called it "livejournalism" :p
942575203963375616 2017-12-17 02:00:15 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk interesting. Would "home-made" have had a different connotation? Or does that form not exist, hmm.

942350054651674624 2017-12-17 11:05:35 UTC <icedwater> @hirojin perhaps I'm privileged enough not to have to deal with this, as I haven't delved into the internals yet.
942326158460297217 2017-12-17 09:30:38 UTC <icedwater> @hirojin just wondering, why does Torvalds and/or Poettering mean you have to give up on Linux?

941479051532779521 2017-12-14 01:24:32 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH how much is poor planning and how much is Singaporeans rushing things because they are kan chiong?
941460707131846656 2017-12-14 00:11:38 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname well, at least we are not France. Wait a minute...
941082723724038144 2017-12-13 23:09:40 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH is it a rush? Compared to what? Are we generally rushing in all aspects of life in Singapore?

940938119729225728 2017-12-13 13:35:04 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @omgitsjn wait. I have a sneaking suspicion I am double-booking myself :/

940888436851982336 2017-12-13 10:17:38 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz you are an enemy of the state! What propaganda do you have stashed in a corner of your house?!

940826721842028544 2017-12-12 06:12:24 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @yazbanz not under that name, no.
940741051991523328 2017-12-12 00:31:59 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @GaryKLH tried to add me on Facebook, apparently.

937271890321616897 2017-12-03 10:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @elmyra if they were to precisely define cold, that's another absurdity to dispute, though. But please carry on, this is interesting.
937270542146486273 2017-12-03 10:41:25 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @annispice if @Nigel_Farage can benefit from the same system he's criticizing, why not?
937270289817149440 2017-12-03 10:40:25 UTC <icedwater> I'm not sure there is substance behind these allegations... But let's wait and see where @PeoplesPowerSG is going.https://twitter.com/PeoplesPowerSG/status/937268428313907200
937266818665791488 2017-12-03 10:26:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG the product placement is getting more and more blatant too.
937266485373779968 2017-12-03 10:25:18 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I didn't know this when I told you about it either... It just evoked more drool than shock to me :p
937264378746826752 2017-12-03 10:16:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG First few times the movies were good to watch. But why keep with a ReJack if nothing is improving?
937174699762630656 2017-12-02 04:20:34 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet two wrongs don't make a right, but they seem to be okay for the right.
937174439359234048 2017-12-02 04:19:32 UTC <icedwater> @SheriffClarke @kentuckylady717 do you really think every President hires a completely new set of White House staff?
937174254583291904 2017-12-02 04:18:48 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @SheriffClarke that you think those are the only ones to have lied, and that the names are correct as-is, is another huge problem.
937171865021308929 2017-12-02 04:09:19 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @johncardillo so @MMFlint can't be part of the 1% and criticize measures meant to keep him wealthy at the expense of the nation?
937001453830287361 2017-12-02 16:52:09 UTC <icedwater> there's a reason why it's "hijack" and not "hijill" ;) but seriously, isn't @tomgara citation and link of @jilliancyork enough?
936999797201895426 2017-12-02 16:45:34 UTC <icedwater> Slightly delayed welcome to @hellofrmSG for @zarethtweets, and thanks @RedDot_Oz for the past week of polls (among other content.) #rocur
936999374369931264 2017-12-02 16:43:54 UTC <icedwater> I'm not following all the details of this #Brexit thing, I don't think anyone can, but some of the exchanges are sadly entertaining.
936998693177237504 2017-12-02 16:41:11 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv yeah I agree with that
936997703443025920 2017-12-02 16:37:15 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv do you mean the prose or the layout ;)
936995139200860160 2017-12-02 16:27:04 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @coachkhairul @Fadzli13 @GaryKLH @abearfromSEA the LCC worked fine before as a club competition, I don't think that's critical.
936994559669628928 2017-12-02 16:24:46 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily lol!
936992596789944321 2017-12-02 16:16:58 UTC <icedwater> @Bazza_68 isn't the outrage over the sharing of these videos precisely because of the content though? @neiljhk @DPJHodges
936985298537345024 2017-12-02 15:47:58 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA let's see how it compares!

936799427443879937 2017-12-01 03:29:23 UTC <icedwater> @coursera @DukeU @elextrify I can see it as getting used to making computers do what you say, but I don't like it being called programming.
936764001886683137 2017-12-01 01:08:36 UTC <icedwater> @coursera @DukeU @elextrify ugh. I have issues with claiming HTML/CSS is an intro to programming. Is highlighting an intro to writing?
936595677206822913 2017-12-01 13:59:45 UTC <icedwater> Cool! Another language that isn't English gets a TTS. Thanks @kolatubosun and team!https://twitter.com/kolatubosun/status/935948078171017216

936558876127666176 2017-12-01 11:33:31 UTC <icedwater> @eisen there was to be no world cup till 1950, and they won in 1954, so I don't think they missed much.
936553386526121986 2017-12-01 11:11:42 UTC <icedwater> @b0rk @kelseyhightower but what is built that isn't worth criticism?

936547662714757120 2017-12-01 10:48:57 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul @yazbanz it's time we stopped depending on gambling money to fund things that can be affected by gambling...
936409705680846849 2017-11-30 01:40:46 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT @theafcdotcom what am I missing here...
936408570760798208 2017-11-30 01:36:15 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo @Singapore_HDB 1. account kosong. 2. face o gao. 3. work until dai. 4. room walls poh. 5. homeowner sua. But at least got house.
936406614776487936 2017-11-30 01:28:29 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn @dcatdemon I want to work on a #singlishtextbook to rival whatever @sgBritish may have for their English :p

936393942785957889 2017-11-30 00:38:07 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @iyad_elbaghdadi I suppose that makes DJT a hero...
936389493740859392 2017-11-30 00:20:27 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn @whyvo @RedDot_Oz @ofmeowandbake @kuekj @bargeboards @singnoname the only KJ worth talking about ;)
936283558498279424 2017-11-30 17:19:30 UTC <icedwater> @SenSanders that sounds bad. But how much tax do they each pay after the credit, may I know please? #genuinelycurious
936280336484384768 2017-11-30 17:06:42 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM I have to say I don't know all the technical details... But shouldn't Bitcoin already be done mining by now?
936279782655848448 2017-11-30 17:04:30 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify I feel like someone should already have written Der Kapitalist.
936278462943203328 2017-11-30 16:59:15 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv wait... Is that a slum in Northern Singapore?!
936277922574352384 2017-11-30 16:57:06 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake one might say this is embarrassing.
936270368255352833 2017-11-30 16:27:05 UTC <icedwater> "wrecking", "compilation", but now I want to watch. Thanks anyway @KaizerT8_ and @yazbanz for the RT.https://twitter.com/KaizerT8_/status/935653346781806594
936267556658102272 2017-11-30 16:15:55 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio just because Labour are complicit in keeping criminals safe does not mean they cannot fight injustice on other fronts.
936265545380372480 2017-11-30 16:07:55 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio Hypocrisy is not binary, we're never 100% consistent. But that doesn't invalidate truth. A murderer can say don't smoke.
936262952096636928 2017-11-30 15:57:37 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @whyvo @bargeboards @ofmeowandbake you forgot the nameless one.
936262751432753152 2017-11-30 15:56:49 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio no, those are different issues.
936255745699352576 2017-11-30 15:28:59 UTC <icedwater> @nytimes LOL @bargeboards @whyvo @ofmeowandbake @RedDot_Oz good thing we're not exclusively @NYtimes readers ehhttps://twitter.com/Ebonyteach/status/935572027469070336
936228995317641216 2017-11-30 13:42:41 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio it's a fact that Labour are involved in that issue, but it's not something that needs to be mentioned here.
936227694856912896 2017-11-30 13:37:31 UTC <icedwater> @thekuehdiaries then you've had a pretty good life :)
936219951794237441 2017-11-30 13:06:45 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio I don't agree there.
936211757143547905 2017-11-30 12:34:11 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio that's awful. But still not relevant to this issue.
936194392125095942 2017-11-30 11:25:11 UTC <icedwater> @MadeinCalcio what about you raise this somewhere else and acknowledge that outrage about this issue is also valid?
936193365380497408 2017-11-30 11:21:06 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @ofmeowandbake @bargeboards @whyvo same for me please :( at Queenstown on the EWL.
936193200716255232 2017-11-30 11:20:27 UTC <icedwater> @WWEAsuka @RingsideC funny. From the preview I thought this was @RealPaigeWWE.
936192011769491456 2017-11-30 11:15:43 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @zeligdhilee oh, I thought you meant more open to debate or something :p
936186768814043136 2017-11-30 10:54:53 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @whyvo @ofmeowandbake @bargeboards by the way, https://burpple.com/the-betterfield exists. Not sure if it's up to date.
936186260976107520 2017-11-30 10:52:52 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @whyvo @ofmeowandbake @bargeboards yeah well... That's your first clue it'll be a pain in the ass ;)
936182409309036550 2017-11-30 10:37:34 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @whyvo @bargeboards @ofmeowandbake got it, thanks.

936127566242443264 2017-11-29 06:59:38 UTC <icedwater> @jxtpse @furryphotos just a quick sketch.

936112952251260929 2017-11-29 06:01:34 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn I had a related idea once about voice recognition assistants for office software or web design :) Not sure where to start though.
936043049892724736 2017-11-29 01:23:48 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @whyvo @bargeboards @ofmeowandbake hehe sure!
936037381857198080 2017-11-29 01:01:17 UTC <icedwater> @Jean_Tortank you should probably find something better to do than bully someone else on Twitter.
935900344529203200 2017-11-29 15:56:44 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @pwcdanica! You could change your handle to PWNdanica because this thread just did that. #forthepeoplehttps://twitter.com/pwcdanica/status/935168630639218688
935898583995375616 2017-11-29 15:49:45 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify well the CS Bachelors might have been just as useful :p just go code and teach yourself stuff. Paper quals later.
935894752116928512 2017-11-29 15:34:31 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify what do you mean "instead"?
935883224995184641 2017-11-29 14:48:43 UTC <icedwater> @damevintage so that makes it better? Acceptable? Forgiveable? What was your point in bringing this up?
935879043731283968 2017-11-29 14:32:06 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon not really. Once the offending fertiliser pile is identified, it can be disposed of without delay.
935876539295588352 2017-11-29 14:22:09 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon why is this either or? We can have more respect in discourse and still clean up our shit.
935875566057615360 2017-11-29 14:18:17 UTC <icedwater> @Xiaxue preachy and self-righteous should be easy for you to identify...

935785854638759936 2017-11-29 08:21:48 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz irony considering we're one of the great copycats of all time
935781415739723776 2017-11-29 08:04:10 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale hmm what's the context here?

935541350463766530 2017-11-28 16:10:14 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @AMike4761 just wondering, wouldn't a "no deal" Brexit hurt the UK more than it would the EU?
935538495065432064 2017-11-28 15:58:53 UTC <icedwater> Hmm maybe this explains someone we talked about, @t1racyjacks?https://twitter.com/saladinahmed/status/932976653843795968
935536655842209792 2017-11-28 15:51:34 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA basket. 280 means no need to edit meh? Proofread your tweets lah.
935170742349471745 2017-11-27 15:37:34 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA you don't want what they want?!
935168173451517952 2017-11-27 15:27:21 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH yah it should have been presented neutrally with both blue/orange and yellow/black. Shall we learn why? @FootballSLEAGUE @ALB_S_FC
935162977006764032 2017-11-27 15:06:42 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH well. If you let @ALB_S_FC plan the home game, that's what you'll get. Who knows what horse trading was done behind the scenes?
935159859250466817 2017-11-27 14:54:19 UTC <icedwater> @colinctc actually, I've heard a lot of bad vibes about QR codes but haven't read articles yet.. @hellofrmSG @dcatdemon
935120761303351298 2017-11-27 12:18:57 UTC <icedwater> @AMDWaters @neiljhk the sad thing is syariah law won't be enforced, and the radicals - as always - will claim credit.

934037275805040641 2017-11-24 12:33:34 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA isn't that every Friday? Or even every day? Gotta be more specific...
934016435403112449 2017-11-24 11:10:46 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv please call me out if I ever look like I'm doing this!
933868974021869568 2017-11-23 01:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn @singnoname Talking Cock 2 will be performed in front of a live audience at Jalan Besar, around the same time #ALBGLO #sgfootball
933868398383046656 2017-11-23 01:22:31 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards more people should think like you, then we'd raise the bar of busking. Opera belongs in the street, not in some fancy halls ;)
933845187540824064 2017-11-23 23:50:17 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake haha yup thanks for the reminder and the admin :) see you then!
933838006598770688 2017-11-23 23:21:45 UTC <icedwater> hm. Worth looking into more closely.
933827366240972800 2017-11-23 22:39:28 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @abearfromSEA for the detailed discourse on ASEAN football in the AFC Cup.
933826783757004800 2017-11-23 22:37:09 UTC <icedwater> Is it possibly time to leave the AFC Cup? Does this calculus apply to Singaporean teams as well?https://twitter.com/abearfromSEA/status/932969183540682752
933590189523451904 2017-11-22 06:57:01 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA is this in response to the Global pay issue?
933589973764227072 2017-11-22 06:56:09 UTC <icedwater> @ChrisRG1962 I think you meant COE with that last one, and while we have no NHS, there are polyclinics and public hospitals. @OwenPaterson
933589387551506432 2017-11-22 06:53:49 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StrictlySid ah, OK. I've found the Guardian article https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/19/school-inspectors-to-question-primary-school-girls-who-wear-hijab, but do primary schools begin at four or five?
933588682329616384 2017-11-22 06:51:01 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StrictlySid was a 4-year-old ever mentioned?

933366729773690880 2017-11-22 16:09:04 UTC <icedwater> @eisen sure bo. Like going Clarke Quay to find Clarks shoes...
933362731532533760 2017-11-22 15:53:10 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @miraxpath true, but just in scale alone the GRC was always going to be a challenge.

932993274721091585 2017-11-21 15:25:05 UTC <icedwater> @nele_lenze @JenAshleyWright I agree. But all the same I wonder where to find out if there were women who became stars after coming forward.
932991831557550080 2017-11-21 15:19:21 UTC <icedwater> @sarahwollaston @neiljhk @andywigmore so if that's all the MPs are then why do you folks continue to vote at all?
932989971111149568 2017-11-21 15:11:57 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany Germans seem to love to ask this of people who learn German. I sometimes answer, "I already know Chinese, so..."
932989406415167489 2017-11-21 15:09:43 UTC <icedwater> Absurdity upon absurdity. @dlacalle_IA @neiljhkhttps://twitter.com/dlacalle_IA/status/932291278355566597
932989270532354049 2017-11-21 15:09:10 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @dlacalle_IA lol what? Millionaires can hire top tax experts so they hate paying less tax? OK.
932989000230436865 2017-11-21 15:08:06 UTC <icedwater> @Randy_Boss_ I'm assuming you have concrete evidence of illegal voting at that scale. Or is it so horrific it has to be covered up?
932986625272856576 2017-11-21 14:58:40 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao @jennyteo err.. if you think social studies is , it might have succeeded in its actual goal ;) #sorryimlate

932615721804107776 2017-11-20 14:24:49 UTC <icedwater> @KTHopkins so the way they dress and act is to blame?
932519320604704768 2017-11-20 08:01:46 UTC <icedwater> @hdevreij @astroehlein @Superkongen I suppose.
932479594086535168 2017-11-19 05:23:54 UTC <icedwater> Wow. Much Conspiracy. Obviously Nazi-haters cannot be right-wing delusionals, right?
932402580650467329 2017-11-19 00:17:53 UTC <icedwater> @hdevreij @astroehlein @Superkongen fair point I suppose. But do they all go to see a doctor for this kind of treatment?
932269510106562560 2017-11-19 15:29:06 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail unless it's outside an enclosed space. Then it's only good for salad. #metaphorbreakdown

932156591402401792 2017-11-19 08:00:24 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail I don't know if you noticed, but I regularly RT and/or jump into conversation about three days late. "It's not you, it's me."
932156263042920448 2017-11-18 07:59:06 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail by their tweet volume and whether I have time or I constantly feel behind. I don't have many lines to read between at 140 :p
932142333860069378 2017-11-18 07:03:45 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @basilyeo I suppose
932141104748568576 2017-11-18 06:58:52 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @shimmertje8 hehe why are you drooling
932140975161466880 2017-11-18 06:58:21 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @basilyeo fear and hopelessness might cause you to be an asshole too... Some things needn't have been brought up.
932114911307563009 2017-11-18 05:14:47 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake yet. LOL just kidding.
932114814385586176 2017-11-18 05:14:24 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @basilyeo got leh this version has more emphasis on the rich asshole tech genius aspect of Bruce Wayne. Came across very starkly.
932047358602252288 2017-11-18 00:46:21 UTC <icedwater> Gonna unfollow a bunch of people I haven't had the time to talk with/read from. Thanks folks, it was fun while I did. See you again maybe :)
932041342657601536 2017-11-18 00:22:27 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @basilyeo but when they model Batman as an Iron Man and Flash as a Quicksilver Spiderman, can you blame audiences?
932040985428627458 2017-11-18 00:21:02 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @JohnWilko10 I guess at least that is better than the 2.4 if we have to cede something to the test freaks?

931691266160525312 2017-11-17 01:11:22 UTC <icedwater> @m4riannelee which spices do you prefer? I'm partial to cinnamon and ginger. Maybe star anise, sparingly...
931690927285923840 2017-11-17 01:10:01 UTC <icedwater> @mintea @lackadaisygirl hahahaha
931690786298634240 2017-11-17 01:09:28 UTC <icedwater> @mintea @lackadaisygirl as in Jurong Point? Cool. If I get any I will check it out hehe
931689582738907141 2017-11-17 01:04:41 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn yes, but journalists have to thread a coherent statement from available facts, while PR is defensive writing, proactive or not.
931688524260057088 2017-11-17 01:00:28 UTC <icedwater> @mintea @lackadaisygirl yup. But that's us. Cars are just transport tools but we can find status markers in anything and exploit them.
931687971673088000 2017-11-17 00:58:17 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl @omgitsjn good! Why should it end? We need more discussion in our society, whether it be about technology or anything else.
931687620345655296 2017-11-17 00:56:53 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn the business shouldn't be about cultivating relationships with journalists. Nor should journalists reach out to PR folks, I feel.
931686880567070720 2017-11-17 00:53:56 UTC <icedwater> @mintea @lackadaisygirl probably more about our human tendency to bandwagon and how we are easily misled...
931684145775878144 2017-11-17 00:43:04 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn thanks for the post! "churning out a press releases and sending it" needs to be fixed. Also, PR is Public Relations, not Press.
931682287090929665 2017-11-17 00:35:41 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn lol yeah actually, when you have "seasoned veterans" getting pissed off, you know you are a disruptor. Of what is another matter.
931677290844397568 2017-11-17 00:15:50 UTC <icedwater> @avalon if I had seen this on time I'd have sprung in with "you called?" :P
931676838488768512 2017-11-17 00:14:02 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl @omgitsjn I see AI as an enabler. My initial issue was with the adversarial or dismissive tone often taken with AI / ML.
931676466462449664 2017-11-17 00:12:33 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn that's another issue altogether. I saw your rant but not the article that prompted it. A lot of the startup churn is fluff anyway.
931674420526985216 2017-11-17 00:04:26 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn it will always be about human-human relationship. Also, an AI producing pitches in microseconds greatly helps the practitioner?
931673550615756802 2017-11-17 00:00:58 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl somebody must have used an AI to find adjectives for durian ;)
931673113728770048 2017-11-17 23:59:14 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl @omgitsjn a trained human mind can also twist dodgy data to persuade people to buy toxic products.
931671914241593344 2017-11-17 23:54:28 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn I don't understand the language of fear being used to discuss AI. Why are we afraid robots will supplant us?
931596340366155776 2017-11-17 18:54:10 UTC <icedwater> @alvations somehow the first thing that came to mind was the Ricola advertisement... You know which one ;)
931584750606626816 2017-11-17 18:08:07 UTC <icedwater> @mintea hope the workshops were well-attended! @lackadaisygirl I'm a bit more cynical about it as far as investment tools are concerned.

930680072020922368 2017-11-14 06:13:15 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @ileksua @GaryKLH to put it in perspective, what's the win-loss record for all-local teams vs FTS-boosted teams?
930621908902486016 2017-11-14 02:22:07 UTC <icedwater> @TeamSinga l es solo uno de los problemas. Tenemos que reiniciar el sistema completamente. Cuando habemos un equipo que jugan sin miedo, podemos ganar.
930620450324881408 2017-11-14 02:16:20 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao even 18 pints of water within 82 minutes would have been a problem.
930620264328527872 2017-11-14 02:15:35 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Shy_Society are they really mutually exclusive, though?
930603955628863488 2017-11-14 01:10:47 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz probably, but whatever teka-teka is we've definitely moved on from long balls to the target man.
930553366509322240 2017-11-14 21:49:46 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon is that Norwegian? It means donkey in German and is pronounced like hazel without the "h".

930249411170516992 2017-11-13 01:41:57 UTC <icedwater> @DrJenGunter your answer was in the first word of that tweet, unfortunately. I'm sorry that such dudes exist.

930247270880047104 2017-11-13 01:33:27 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid the bugger with the nerves will also reply as you suggest, but may have to go through a breakdown first...
930234361802252288 2017-11-13 00:42:09 UTC <icedwater> Still behind on tweets. But missing the @hellofrmSG goodness. Anyone want to try making new friends for a week? #rocur
930232514441920512 2017-11-13 00:34:48 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul but that's why it needs more effort. Just as one Pennant doesn't save a club, one scuffle (I know...) shouldn't kill a league.

929933518263554049 2017-11-12 04:46:42 UTC <icedwater> @ianbremmer for some reason I'm very skeptical of such narratives these days, but given the way China does things it somehow fits! @eisen

929747999734951936 2017-11-12 16:29:31 UTC <icedwater> @Myminimine part of me thinks retribution is the only way, but I really want to not do that. Can we expect @Twitter to do the right thing?
929747381230305280 2017-11-12 16:27:04 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz never too early if you're signalling... something yourself
929717044773208064 2017-11-12 14:26:31 UTC <icedwater> @Myminimine I can't stop you; do it if you think it's effective. I just don't like doxxing. Getting POSobiec suspended is okay though.
929713824323604480 2017-11-12 14:13:43 UTC <icedwater> @Myminimine I concur, but I still don't think eye for an eye is a good strategy.
929692012755918849 2017-11-12 12:47:03 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @My_MGAG we just weren't thinking far enough into the future. You know why they once said Malaysia is "Truly Asia"? ;)

929628293849952256 2017-11-12 08:33:51 UTC <icedwater> @Twitter @LucianTenebrae if @twitter had done something, would it have persuaded you to stay?
929628041587724288 2017-11-12 08:32:51 UTC <icedwater> @oneunderscore__ @Myminimine that's the last thing we need to do...
929580232176054273 2017-11-11 05:22:52 UTC <icedwater> @danidotx so in this hypothetical the gap would only be because of the time off, and actual monthly pay is the same?
929550162950701056 2017-11-11 03:23:23 UTC <icedwater> @byron_auguste @DamnManly it's an excellent response to the overconsumption problem, reusing resources. If not startups, community spaces!
929549787224928256 2017-11-11 03:21:54 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH 
929376479023996928 2017-11-11 15:53:14 UTC <icedwater> in some cases this is called creativity and insight. Not here; this is just poor derailing.

929371568483983360 2017-11-11 15:33:43 UTC <icedwater> @danidotx are you earning less just because of that time off work, or is your pay already less than a man's for the same job?
929370310654042112 2017-11-11 15:28:43 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz why do you say so?
929370258099408896 2017-11-11 15:28:31 UTC <icedwater> @ben_roads is anyone though
929370113714790400 2017-11-11 15:27:56 UTC <icedwater> @carmelosg1 so you expect to be praised for what should be done? Great job pressing send on that reply then.

929264439248928769 2017-11-11 08:28:01 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH so it's OK to avenge historic embarrassments but not to cling to successes?

929007166035451904 2017-11-10 15:25:43 UTC <icedwater> @STcom @guanyinmiao I don't know, does @stcom still report news? To my friends working there... Keep trying to raise the bar please!
929006592321667072 2017-11-10 15:23:26 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily the assumption that exam grades are a reliable indicator of intelligence needs to go :)
928825945695252480 2017-11-09 03:25:36 UTC <icedwater> @jinda_bisran 
928692282466770944 2017-11-09 18:34:29 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW Seems true so far. Anyone able to verify that the Bundeskriminalamt's had 800+ islamist terror cases in 2017? @dvatwhttps://twitter.com/DVATW/status/928657763177201664
928683320778506240 2017-11-09 17:58:52 UTC <icedwater> @DrJenGunter @bethanyshondark *only within certain bounds.
928682826513256448 2017-11-09 17:56:54 UTC <icedwater> So @EmmericGabanaa corrected me: Bennett was 36 about three years ago. Thanks! 39 makes me worry more though https://twitter.com/icedwater/status/928597547110645760
928681890516582400 2017-11-09 17:53:11 UTC <icedwater> @lyeemoon with only one lion here instead of three, sure ;)
928676025210302464 2017-11-09 17:29:53 UTC <icedwater> @lyeemoon thanks, but I lack the time for more than a drive by on most things, sadly.
928673206931677184 2017-11-09 17:18:41 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon it is. Apparently it was satisfactory for the coach too (Sundram) so we shall see what Tuesday brings.
928644772557754368 2017-11-09 15:25:41 UTC <icedwater> @lyeemoon I'll believe it when I manage to dig up evidence of that support. And that second charge that it outweighs far right... LOL
928634183705968640 2017-11-09 14:43:37 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon yup! 2-1 away; 2-0 home. Aleksandr Duric and Fazrul Nawaz scored at home while John Wilkinson scored after 1 own goal each. 2008
928631384146558976 2017-11-09 14:32:29 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @Conflicts huh. Oh dear.
928630406261309440 2017-11-09 14:28:36 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon hmm I'll have to verify that. Even if it were true, it would likely have been with more of our imported talent around.
928629798162722816 2017-11-09 14:26:11 UTC <icedwater> #SINLEB attendance was apparently 3050 (5). Not too bad. Hope for a better crowd come Tuesday! #fb
928625239562448896 2017-11-09 14:08:04 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @FraserNelson also how the population under the poverty line was distributed globally
928624129384767489 2017-11-09 14:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @FraserNelson I wonder how much a piece of bread and a cup of tea costs in 2011 using 1985 dollars.
928620216937955328 2017-11-09 13:48:07 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @abearfromSEA probably 2nd gear. Just lost steering wheel...

928613073576910848 2017-11-09 13:19:44 UTC <icedwater> 88' Bennett doing enough to usher the ball out for a goal kick. His experience and Hariss' composure will be key in defence. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb
928612645829091328 2017-11-09 13:18:02 UTC <icedwater> 86' I preferred Shawal's industry and creativity over Nazrul's passive touchline hugging. But the latter's produced a bit more. #SINLEB 0-1
928612165308768258 2017-11-09 13:16:07 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz hehe they only opened one side as usual. Kallang venue, Jalan Besar mindset. Maybe 4K or fewer here?

928610867662307330 2017-11-09 13:10:58 UTC <icedwater> 79' Tahan scores off a pass across goal. Hassan stranded, as was Bennett. But the flag is up and the goal won't count. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb
928609885041725440 2017-11-09 13:07:03 UTC <icedwater> 75' Yellow card for Chaaban whose challenge toppled an outstretched Hassan. Goalie is down for treatment. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb

928608121315983361 2017-11-09 13:00:03 UTC <icedwater> 68' Lebanom change: Mansour on for Jounaidi. Singapore taking a more direct approach now. Not much better. #SINLEB 0-1

928607475514748928 2017-11-09 12:57:29 UTC <icedwater> 66' Ayass replaced by A. Haidar for Lebanon. Hariss' composed clearance matched by Irfan's efficiency. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb

928603188474691585 2017-11-09 12:40:27 UTC <icedwater> 47' Both subs combine well on the right but Bennett shows them the door. Singapore brought Irfan on for Faris. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb

928598433371271169 2017-11-09 12:21:33 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz nice to see Selangor has a Champions League.. how many champions do they have though?
928597921787887616 2017-11-09 12:19:31 UTC <icedwater> 45+2' Hassan grabs the corner he made after a brilliant stop from Ayass. That should see the half out. #SINLEB 0-1 #fb

928596443761295360 2017-11-09 12:13:39 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz complaining is easy. Attending is hard. :)

928594464846757888 2017-11-09 12:05:47 UTC <icedwater> 33' Having said that, it's heartening to see Singapore track back and close down despite the obvious disadvantage. #SINLEB 0-1
928594087308967936 2017-11-09 12:04:17 UTC <icedwater> 31' Bennett lunges in for a crucial challenge on Matar. Penalty denied, referee waves play on. Bennett waves "get up"  #SINLEB 0-1 #fb

928590310862594048 2017-11-09 11:49:17 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon tweet URLs *are* per tweet. Until a change log is implemented upstream, chaining the tweets is the best I can think of.
928589906879823873 2017-11-09 11:47:40 UTC <icedwater> 15' Shawal tracks back, concedes a free kick, but this is saved easily by #Keeperkatmane Hassan Sunny. #SINLEB 0-0
928589587726811136 2017-11-09 11:46:24 UTC <icedwater> Sorry, that is of course Shawal Anuar, not Shahdan Sulaiman in the protective headgear. #SINLEB 15' 0-0
928589288962326529 2017-11-09 11:45:13 UTC <icedwater> 13' Shahdan tries to get to a Lebanese clearance off a free kick on the left but concedes one of his own. #SINLEB 0-0
928588995813974018 2017-11-09 11:44:03 UTC <icedwater> @Thandlings I shall try. Thanks :)

928588177664647168 2017-11-09 11:40:48 UTC <icedwater> 7' First 2 set-pieces from the hosts cleared by the Lebanese in white. But the sense of adventure is there. Promising start. #fb #SINLEB 0-0
928587618387861504 2017-11-09 11:38:35 UTC <icedwater> 6' Instead of the 4-2-3-1 we seem to have Bennett, Hariss, Madhu at the back; Faritz and Hafiz on either side. Looks like 3-4-3. #SINLEB 0-0
928586808157290496 2017-11-09 11:35:22 UTC <icedwater> 2' Singapore goalkeeper Hassan Sunny is first to the corner. Lebanon seem to have the upper hand, but it's early still. #SINLEB #fb 0-0
928583656897048577 2017-11-09 11:22:50 UTC <icedwater> I guess I don't mind video highlights of ancient history since that kind of is where we are stuck right now in #sgfootball #SINLEB

928549239633743872 2017-11-09 09:06:04 UTC <icedwater> @jinda_bisran meh. I'm not taking it that seriously... Is that #chineseprivilege, I wonder?
928477298105335808 2017-11-08 04:20:12 UTC <icedwater> @HarrietSergeant @neiljhk this being raising pay, that is, independent of any impending shortage of EU personnel.
928477099505041408 2017-11-08 04:19:25 UTC <icedwater> @HarrietSergeant @neiljhk well, fair enough. But shouldn't employers have considered this even without Brexit?

928217195326222337 2017-11-08 11:06:39 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith or the number of guns in Hawaii being very very low compared to other states.
928033061274394625 2017-11-07 22:54:58 UTC <icedwater> Looks like it's #gunsovermeds for the US. @WFKARS, have you heard this from people in other states too?https://twitter.com/WFKARS/status/927556386141163521

927682822671818752 2017-11-06 23:43:15 UTC <icedwater> @JackPosobiec @neiljhk it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Guns and mental health issues must both be treated.
927491865602957312 2017-11-06 11:04:27 UTC <icedwater> @JackPosobiec @neiljhk sure. But limiting their access to guns & vehicles would help too, if we're taking the mental health tack.
927418489668698112 2017-11-05 06:12:53 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo And every year after they made sure we remember, because only the USA matters it seems
927418358621913088 2017-11-05 06:12:21 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo remember remember, eleventh September, the towers and jets and the melted steel beams
927417276810149888 2017-11-05 06:08:04 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon *google* 2fa authentication?
927416651804319744 2017-11-05 06:05:35 UTC <icedwater> @JackPosobiec @neiljhk so test/licence/tax guns, since it won't have any effect on crime?
927345796286050304 2017-11-05 01:24:01 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon but I do enjoy searching for the shoe sizes of star-crossed lovers to add to my password's special characters every 87 days!
927337668387553280 2017-11-05 00:51:43 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz you mean disrupted too?
927333233477300229 2017-11-05 00:34:06 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi we're not far away from that.. the ingredients are already there.
927330704567894016 2017-11-05 00:24:03 UTC <icedwater> @TheSafestSpace @Broadfall it's just part of the concert though? I feel like the request is OK but it shouldn't've had those consequences.
927231240113070080 2017-11-05 17:48:49 UTC <icedwater> @ali_alyousuf are you saying all men are animals? Because that's what it sounds like to me.
927225850285637632 2017-11-05 17:27:24 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao I wonder if I should get back to training at Grapple Max just for fun... #sgprowrestling
927216347934687232 2017-11-05 16:49:38 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya "super well paid journos"? Now I know you're trolling :p
927205018893131777 2017-11-05 16:04:37 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao yeah Oliver does better because he has a week for his team and he's British. They know all about insular ;)
927203017178226688 2017-11-05 15:56:40 UTC <icedwater> @guanyinmiao either a) it's comedy b) it's #Colbert's true colours c) both d) something more
927201112213430277 2017-11-05 15:49:06 UTC <icedwater> @thetrudz enjoy! It's a fun ride :)

926492093903601664 2017-11-03 16:51:43 UTC <icedwater> @telethonkids @amichetti @FutureProof_TV what does the app do with the scanned images, and how was training data obtained?
926490406597967873 2017-11-03 16:45:00 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet but "Allahu Akbar" does mean "God is great" in Arabic, doesn't it?
926286890356981760 2017-11-02 03:16:18 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice @RedDot_Oz population minority doesn't always equal less power, cf. South Africa :p
926274967204851712 2017-11-02 02:28:56 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice @RedDot_Oz there is that, but I suppose the British contribution was to change the growth trajectory of Singapore.
926221429170872320 2017-11-02 22:56:11 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname obviously we need to clean out that lair. :P
926221171602755584 2017-11-02 22:55:10 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale ???
926214784965419008 2017-11-02 22:29:47 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I'm not sure there wasn't trade before the British.
926213531048935424 2017-11-02 22:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @JackPosobiec because they should have been talking about truck bans instead, obviously
926209447650717697 2017-11-02 22:08:35 UTC <icedwater> @attnre some mass murderers also commit suicide after, you want to subtract those also?
926208886448693249 2017-11-02 22:06:21 UTC <icedwater> On tech neutrality and how people had been thinking about this a long time. Thanks @LMSacasas @sebadetoma.https://twitter.com/sebadetoma/status/925919309670551552

926202546644860928 2017-11-02 21:41:09 UTC <icedwater> Love it! Thanks @MeilinNeo for sharing your passion with us. #giantclam #fbhttps://twitter.com/MeilinNeo/status/925910712026845184
926128186273886208 2017-11-02 16:45:40 UTC <icedwater> @Sabrina0527 take care ;(
926127032462819328 2017-11-02 16:41:05 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 they have to break up to provide data for these articles.
926126663745683456 2017-11-02 16:39:37 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti and how reliable can they be? Also, what would have to be given up to make them more reliable?

926052445507108864 2017-11-02 11:44:42 UTC <icedwater> @RobinKwong @yanoak why play the rankings game in the first place?
926051343235551232 2017-11-02 11:40:20 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname well, he's buying time and I'm willing to buy in. If they manage to win and hold a few GRCs a few times, prospects seem better.
925980022933921792 2017-11-01 06:56:56 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty I suppose this would render some invisible ;)
925979517872570368 2017-11-01 06:54:55 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner just curious, if he'd said "all Americans" would he have been read as saying "lgbtq, etc are not American"?
925969832863924225 2017-11-01 06:16:26 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk so just the ABC, then. @FatNeckDonald @PrisonPlanet
925896143254331392 2017-11-01 01:23:37 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid lol! Yeah!
925893474653634560 2017-11-01 01:13:01 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily send them to an animal doctor via bungee cord.
925854244447465472 2017-11-01 22:37:08 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet I'm sure as usual there won't be any concrete proof from your end. Typical.

925675092813651968 2017-11-01 10:45:14 UTC <icedwater> @nomoresoundbyte indeed. The "left" are the remaining humans, it seems. @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet
925674827960107008 2017-11-01 10:44:11 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet @neiljhk ugh. Sorry. My fault for replying to two tweets at once. Let me get back to you.
925674586015858689 2017-11-01 10:43:14 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet @neiljhk you said "the left" allowed him to "get away with it". Neither headlines nor journalists were brought into it.
925645617619070976 2017-11-01 08:48:07 UTC <icedwater> @yglions @HomeUtdFC @GaryKLH certainly not the norm for a very long time... /digs in archives

925642406342533120 2017-11-01 08:35:21 UTC <icedwater> @yuejie1994 that is cool! But we should test it one day I guess. I think with escalators up and down plus traffic lights the margin drops.
925615400892510208 2017-10-31 06:48:03 UTC <icedwater> @yuejie1994 but doesn't it take longer to walk from Rochor to Jalan Besar than for the train to pass those stations?
925602530007982080 2017-10-31 05:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @avarenity yeah but Instagram has so much hashtag spam. Ugh. Good thing it didn't last long on (my) Facebook.
925602280077893632 2017-10-31 05:55:55 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity @hellofrmSG yup! Exactly.
925592052514959360 2017-10-31 05:15:16 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity yeah organic is best, I feel. But @hellofrmSG how many hashtags do you typically use? About 0 I noticed?
925578466300276736 2017-10-31 04:21:17 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai I see. But would you sign up on those lists with that particular name? @omgitsjn @dhr_xo
925562824121651201 2017-10-31 03:19:08 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn just wondering, maybe one of @x_ai's friends gave the referral with that informal name? Though the agent should say right. @dhr_xo

925499714635677698 2017-10-31 23:08:21 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet @neiljhk but just look around on Twitter maybe?pic.twitter.com/92y4QNzeGK

925495539856154625 2017-10-31 22:51:46 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet has "the left" allowed him to "get away with it" though?

923509982636621824 2017-10-26 11:21:52 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn @singnoname I'm sorry. That pun won't fry.

923314641320550400 2017-10-25 22:25:39 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith really? As long as there is more than one person, there is a power relationship.
923170185837551617 2017-10-25 12:51:38 UTC <icedwater> @johnsu01 @downey slides into my DMs, please ;)
923150281952477185 2017-10-25 11:32:33 UTC <icedwater> @mjasay @downey hmm. Is it true that Black Duck is anti GPL? Or is it just a smear that disappointed you?
923061972756656128 2017-10-24 05:41:38 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi because it is. For me, Chinese refers to the languages spoken in China. Just like you cannot speak Indian but you have Tamil, etc.
923006272596611073 2017-10-24 02:00:18 UTC <icedwater> @KenTremendous That sting in the tail of the story... Thanks @kentremendous!https://twitter.com/KenTremendous/status/922467678140342279
922986397908180992 2017-10-24 00:41:20 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi yup that's why I made the point to differentiate "Mandarin" vs "Chinese". Because "Singapore Hokkien" is also "Chinese".
922982419598155776 2017-10-24 00:25:31 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi Mandarin, you mean. Not "Chinese".
922980265902858240 2017-10-24 00:16:58 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua aw.
922972432025059329 2017-10-24 23:45:50 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul yup but it's a pity that the bulk are moving on together. How many veterans are left in the squad?
922969677826887680 2017-10-24 23:34:53 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul any clue why?
922965502850248704 2017-10-24 23:18:18 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi Ang Deng Kee is the phrase for pink IC I thought?

922934493987594240 2017-10-24 21:15:05 UTC <icedwater> @BrexiteerGB the UK wants everything its way and it's the EU that's greedy? I get that it's not mutually exclusive, but...
922928567444422656 2017-10-24 20:51:32 UTC <icedwater> @furryphotos too many words. @frhn @omgitsjn @RedDot_Oz  "Don't @LinkedIn."

922829642045599746 2017-10-24 14:18:26 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple eh. I thought you meant for lunch or hangout only. No role yet leh.

922804112621572096 2017-10-24 12:36:59 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple maybe something near one-north, if you don't mind? Can get more people also good.

921136513303367680 2017-10-19 22:10:33 UTC <icedwater> @Barnzie614 @JesseFrisinger cattle is the plural of...?
921134496816271365 2017-10-19 22:02:32 UTC <icedwater> @Barnzie614 @JesseFrisinger let me repeat that so you can't misread.   What type of animal is the cow a female of?  woman:human :: cow:___?
921130415947243520 2017-10-19 21:46:19 UTC <icedwater> @Barnzie614 @JesseFrisinger a cow is a female... what?
921128036606644224 2017-10-19 21:36:52 UTC <icedwater> @Barnzie614 @JesseFrisinger a bull is a cow. Just like a man is a human.
921127756863295489 2017-10-19 21:35:45 UTC <icedwater> @MelvinTorad so a MALE HUMAN, also known as a MAN, is no longer a HUMAN? #fragile

919932463337615360 2017-10-16 14:26:05 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith "military is tolerant". I said it's only apparent tolerance - as long as orders given are followed, nobody cares.
919379596516130816 2017-10-14 01:49:11 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith looks great coming from the military. But why would they care who is what as long as orders are being followed?
919274592119742469 2017-10-14 18:51:56 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith the military has only one ideology - follow instructions. It doesn't matter what you think.

918575536498266117 2017-10-12 20:34:08 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk then the problem seems to be the inability of UK roasters to compete with the region... @BrexitCentral @Jacob_Rees_Mogg
918451774905896960 2017-10-12 12:22:21 UTC <icedwater> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BrexitCentral @neiljhk still not answering my question, guess I'll have to find out on my own as always :)
918444582140088320 2017-10-12 11:53:46 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG how does sustainable growth look for a volunteer org vs for a company? What is similar and what's different?
918442175129677824 2017-10-12 11:44:13 UTC <icedwater> @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BrexitCentral @neiljhk the coffee beans example seems odd to me. Surely UK roasters were protected under the EU too?

918164147178758150 2017-10-11 17:19:26 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock when you have a certain budget to spend on particular things in your travel, that can happen. Try travelling to, eg, Norway.
917977362486169600 2017-10-10 04:57:13 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock not everyone can afford it right...
917789190791757825 2017-10-10 16:29:29 UTC <icedwater> @SevaUT heh interesting. I wonder how this would compare to a map of Africa and Asia had Western colonization not happened.
917789103726440449 2017-10-10 16:29:08 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @JackPosobiec that would have been a gross misuse of his authority. Why not let his team take care of the smaller threats?

915873259249213440 2017-10-05 09:36:15 UTC <icedwater> Richardson/Hemenway paper that the @chrispbbailey graph comes from uses 2003 WHO data, while the graph from @evans1371 uses 2008 UNODC data.
915806651545878528 2017-10-04 05:11:35 UTC <icedwater> Sounds like the start of an excellent story!https://twitter.com/booksmugglers/status/915246001463660544
915803604535066626 2017-10-04 04:59:28 UTC <icedwater> @hfuhcncjxjsushx is it necessary to have smartphones?
915661757435150336 2017-10-04 19:35:49 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith but the pedant in me says "tenets", not "tenants", at 3.35am :p
915661439095914496 2017-10-04 19:34:33 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith thanks for the thread. I'll read it again later :)
915423820764266496 2017-10-03 03:50:21 UTC <icedwater> @DeanDeankevin4 that's the problem. Everything I said was in English.
915403797882593280 2017-10-03 02:30:47 UTC <icedwater> @DeanDeankevin4 if you're making comments that subtly reference skin colour, you're probably not affected. So I inferred you're white.
915258402237906946 2017-10-03 16:53:02 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH lol
915252151982497792 2017-10-03 16:28:12 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH with this kind of standards... Who wants to import our players?
915250348603744256 2017-10-03 16:21:02 UTC <icedwater> @DeanDeankevin4 how white do you want to look?
915245194877976581 2017-10-03 16:00:33 UTC <icedwater> @realJamesAllsup birth control fails from time to time, but it's still used...
915211978171236352 2017-10-03 13:48:34 UTC <icedwater> @donaeldunready sorry, reported for spam by mistake. Muscle memory. Was just gonna mute for a while to catch up on the rest.
915211372505341953 2017-10-03 13:46:09 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn run an #sleague club for 2018!

914968727854080000 2017-10-02 21:41:58 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith probably only among this vocal fringe that you speak of? Squeaky wheel, etc
914967228289708032 2017-10-02 21:36:01 UTC <icedwater> @bookwormengr I'm sorry, but these are not equivalent. I doubt the Catalonians have issues with, e.g. Galician immigrants. @sunnysingh_n6
914872041848717312 2017-10-02 15:17:46 UTC <icedwater> @DoubleEph fine, if you want to create a new England in Singapore's image out of the cultural ruins of Nigeria...
914871081357283328 2017-10-02 15:13:57 UTC <icedwater> @thealphamaleno1 you must not have caught @KarlreMarks comment about, say, Africa.
914865984992768000 2017-10-02 14:53:42 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG oh hi! I thought it was LadyBoss back. But you're a different kind of back and that's great too 
914865705253662720 2017-10-02 14:52:36 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith "only the right will embrace those ideas". Is that not what you said?
914864971049078785 2017-10-02 14:49:41 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi wow! What does sports school provide for $1k a month?
914862526512324608 2017-10-02 14:39:58 UTC <icedwater> Meh, it automatically goes to a toolong service.
914862354902294528 2017-10-02 14:39:17 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if I can tweet above 140 even though the app I am using does not permit it. Or do I have to log (cont) http://tl.gd/n_1sq7o13

914663225576136704 2017-10-01 01:28:01 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 ugh. How to mitigate?
914663099482857472 2017-10-01 01:27:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG eh you're back ah. Welcome back :p

914615951995236353 2017-10-01 22:20:10 UTC <icedwater> self care is important dude. The brand will only be stronger after that. :)
914490674262589441 2017-10-01 14:02:21 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith why do you think it's about pleasure?
914490483346350080 2017-10-01 14:01:36 UTC <icedwater> @EngageTheRebels nah if you were you wouldn't say that.
914489849880633345 2017-10-01 13:59:05 UTC <icedwater> @paulwestonlibgb It's sad when you have to found a party based on opposing another religion...
914489334581018624 2017-10-01 13:57:02 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood nah it's ridiculous hyperbole is what it is. I'm doing neither.
914489028291866626 2017-10-01 13:55:49 UTC <icedwater> @PeterSweden7 what a pity. Fascism must be stopped.
914487086975131650 2017-10-01 13:48:06 UTC <icedwater> @Bellagia44 go away, bot.
914484307099451392 2017-10-01 13:37:03 UTC <icedwater> @santinoregilme @NewYorker lol just noticed the conveyor belt cogs for the first time! Genius!
914147146705727488 2017-09-30 15:17:18 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam @dcatdemon well... If the alternative is @kenjeyaretnam then sleep is just fine :)

914105919008473089 2017-09-30 12:33:29 UTC <icedwater> At half-time, Home trail Albirex 2-3 on aggregate and Hougang/Global is finely poised at 3-3. #HOMALB #HOUGLO #sgcup

914053832765612032 2017-09-30 09:06:30 UTC <icedwater> @avalon dare I suggest... Football watching at Bishan stadium? Or would that be too stressful?
914052780855140352 2017-09-30 09:02:19 UTC <icedwater> Anyone up for #SGfootball? Cup semis tonight featuring two of the best Singaporean teams, one off the field, the other on it #HOUGLO #HOMALB
914051744639807488 2017-09-30 08:58:12 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter based on your rule this is 1-0 to the Palace?
913981958178222080 2017-09-29 04:20:54 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith the right is anti-war? That's new. Besides, how can you be mostly anti-war? Just a little skirmish on the side is fine?
913786591163723776 2017-09-29 15:24:35 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith you speak as if the party doesn't consist of views supported by its constituents. What do you mean, politicians don't listen? ;)
913786397969965056 2017-09-29 15:23:49 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith right.
913785246549602304 2017-09-29 15:19:14 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith government assistance isn't incompatible with self-reliance. I mean, gonna wear a headlamp to not rely on streetlights?
913784733221490691 2017-09-29 15:17:12 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith ha, maybe!
913717787658354688 2017-09-29 10:51:11 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith again, bookmarking for reference. :)
913717002413383680 2017-09-29 10:48:04 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith bookmarked this to research a reply. Unless you have stats handy ;)
913715984048963584 2017-09-29 10:44:01 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith I've been tweeting a wannabe Hatemonger all along!https://twitter.com/SuperSpacedad/status/912829021406289921
913612343786872832 2017-09-28 03:52:11 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith obviously your personal experience is worth something. But power corrupts.
913550219748323328 2017-09-28 23:45:19 UTC <icedwater> @kenchengcomedy also more tying action than Spain.
913544836506017792 2017-09-28 23:23:56 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith although who knows, what's left of Iraq might be stable, so you could be on to something.
913544676199645184 2017-09-28 23:23:18 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith so put an ethnic minority seeking to secede in charge of a military force. Sounds like a great idea.
913431304238018560 2017-09-28 15:52:48 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet if it were: 16 unarmed white men killed by cops; 2400 white men killed by other white men a year.  Would you #TakeAKnee?
913415625933938689 2017-09-28 14:50:30 UTC <icedwater> @KellynnWee @visakanv who knows. Apparently Glenn Fang is on to something.
913404471278936066 2017-09-28 14:06:10 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards @ofmeowandbake lol totes forgot about it. Was at science cafe tonight

913377040874614785 2017-09-28 12:17:10 UTC <icedwater> A Singaporean FB post: political centre of gravity in the West has shifted so left, traditional right-wing conservatism now 'extreme right'.
913371643929489408 2017-09-28 11:55:44 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards sure, why not?
913225970856878080 2017-09-27 02:16:53 UTC <icedwater> This just means we're going to get it, right... #sigh https://twitter.com/cpmcgonagle/status/912791183847550976
913211948396720128 2017-09-27 01:21:09 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty Yes, has someone already done it? :D
913061179534086144 2017-09-27 15:22:03 UTC <icedwater> @MightyStags with Singapore-only coaching staff?
913057411786620933 2017-09-27 15:07:05 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren he who controls the means of production production... #metacapitalist
912845535366627328 2017-09-26 01:05:10 UTC <icedwater> @koopa_kinte do you have PayPal? I can't http://cash.you from outside the US.
912845319976579074 2017-09-26 01:04:18 UTC <icedwater> Certainly not flagging is @koopa_kinte. Thanks for the threads!https://twitter.com/koopa_kinte/status/911921668506963968
912842135447027712 2017-09-26 00:51:39 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @koopa_kinte for highlighting the hypocrisy here. Hope this goes some way towards resolving it.https://twitter.com/koopa_kinte/status/911721957955129345
912838352138727424 2017-09-26 00:36:37 UTC <icedwater> Hmm that's one perspective.https://twitter.com/silvesterldn/status/911681832369844224
912836271134842880 2017-09-26 00:28:21 UTC <icedwater> @caseyjohnston I don't think that's the paper though, I couldn't find the word "worrisome" in it. @gusfriedman
912832815560921088 2017-09-26 00:14:37 UTC <icedwater> @AndriErlingsson @NO_BOOT_DEVICE hahaha nice work from the "Aryan State"; a term that has shifted so much in location and meaning.
912687921932537856 2017-09-26 14:38:52 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I can understand TMZ reporting this, but CNN... Well, par for the course these days I guess.
912668017971965952 2017-09-26 13:19:46 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA expectation too high also not healthy
912667878284914688 2017-09-26 13:19:13 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA spend money already just let him do his job lah. Long-term project who take also no difference what...
912667673208643585 2017-09-26 13:18:24 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen ...where is that?
912667145330319360 2017-09-26 13:16:18 UTC <icedwater> @docherself Dawneld Trump might disaggre
912504172460744705 2017-09-25 02:28:42 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith also I hope you don't mean that the US model of democracy is the one that should be followed.
912503216251707392 2017-09-25 02:24:54 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith uh. Is it impossible for "white people" to be drunks, criminals, and welfare leeches? How does that detract from "whiteness"?
912502598036369408 2017-09-25 02:22:27 UTC <icedwater> @cheeaun thanks @ongmin!
912502010817142784 2017-09-25 02:20:07 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith about the same as in the US, isn't it?
912355306486693888 2017-09-25 16:37:10 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith oh, are they not?
912355054966816770 2017-09-25 16:36:10 UTC <icedwater> @KassyDillon @suzukeith that is your hubris right there.
912354949278793730 2017-09-25 16:35:45 UTC <icedwater> @KassyDillon @suzukeith because the forceful option worked wonders in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan?
912351365539569665 2017-09-25 16:21:30 UTC <icedwater> LOLOLOLOL @markantro @neiljhkhttps://twitter.com/markantro/status/911262303252766720
912350524304846848 2017-09-25 16:18:10 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith we shall see ;)
912350395351023616 2017-09-25 16:17:39 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith yup I agree with the loop premise. It seems an accurate description.
912350134146547712 2017-09-25 16:16:37 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith paraphrased, "why is there a divide between /white/ and /non-white/?" Or "why was /of colour/ even definable in the first place?"
912349507311906816 2017-09-25 16:14:07 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith has anyone with the ability to change this acknowledged it yet? Bills come close to signing, or speeches, petitions made?
912348919803256832 2017-09-25 16:11:47 UTC <icedwater> @KassyDillon @suzukeith nothing will change on either side. Let the randoms spew rubbish. Who on here can rescue the North Koreans?
912343339562811392 2017-09-25 15:49:37 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith @KassyDillon it's not like random criticism on the internet can stop the North Korean from doing what he wants. Unlike Trump.
912334124756516866 2017-09-25 15:13:00 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith because of centuries-old oppression that hasn't ended yet, just been disguised.
912333845797539840 2017-09-25 15:11:53 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith white supremacists and racial purists long for the power balance to tip back in their favour. Why is "white" not a "colour"?
912333204526317568 2017-09-25 15:09:20 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith may be true now. But colonisers already laid the groundwork centuries ago and the white/non-white dichotomy has sunk in deep.
912276354166530050 2017-09-25 11:23:26 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith what kind of privilege do Spanish people have over the rest you'd mentioned in this case? Deliberate confusion.
912274226253406209 2017-09-25 11:14:59 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith so... Brown isn't a colour?
912267932398321664 2017-09-25 10:49:58 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @blackadlerqueen ugh, in light of what happened... This tweet is weird. #latereplies
912266896585539584 2017-09-25 10:45:51 UTC <icedwater> @JeeSayTan sorry, you didn't finish your thought...
912265448875376640 2017-09-25 10:40:06 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG why should we race to go cashless in the first place? Just because others have it?
912264362919784448 2017-09-25 10:35:47 UTC <icedwater> @LividEye @hellofrmSG @mintea ...uh ...the Milo tower... Got pork one a not?! #oldpranks

911990004754161665 2017-09-24 16:25:35 UTC <icedwater> @shhvjbhu but advocating peacefully for it is perfectly fine, because you're not carrying out the actual violent act, others are.
911929995030798337 2017-09-24 12:27:08 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Michael_Heaver they're not mutually incompatible statements and have both to be evaluated for factual content...
911929553349599232 2017-09-24 12:25:23 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PeterSweden7 love it! But when was this said in the first place?
911926266097315840 2017-09-24 12:12:19 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @goddersbloom curious: what tariff reliefs does Germany enjoy compared to the Netherlands that their food prices differ so much?
911596633418170368 2017-09-23 14:22:28 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch for you the question is how much of the time. :P

911192548936368128 2017-09-22 11:36:47 UTC <icedwater> @ssag_de @iampinch yup or I wouldn't have asked :)
911072963826393088 2017-09-21 03:41:36 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith it's clear you have no standards and don't care about reputation, yes :p
910888688132907008 2017-09-21 15:29:21 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch got plans for early October? Maybe hang out with some Singaporeans at an @ssag_de event? #Kennenlernwochenende
910888196166238208 2017-09-21 15:27:24 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith for  one who just used "world's loneliest angriest virgin" on someone else, it's pretty rich to hit @VICE for this. Or revealing.
910851282751037440 2017-09-21 13:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I'm not considering Trump's egregious emission "art" as King's novels are. @benshapiro
910812926742634496 2017-09-21 10:28:18 UTC <icedwater> @KellynnWee About that earlier screenshot @kellynnwee shared. Know anyone who can help?https://twitter.com/KellynnWee/status/909690815210856454
910812494595112961 2017-09-21 10:26:35 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk *sigh* of course not. But this kind of "funny video" is pretty unbecoming of a President. @benshapiro

910808905797664768 2017-09-21 10:12:19 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk really, that's how you choose to read it? Okay. @benshapiro

910547044049199106 2017-09-20 16:51:47 UTC <icedwater> @mintea @EricRWeinstein The one making the assertion backed by rigorous study.
910545853294665728 2017-09-20 16:47:03 UTC <icedwater> @Ifrit357 Islam doesn't have a "war on non-Muslims". Do you read religious texts literally? Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
910545446510018560 2017-09-20 16:45:26 UTC <icedwater> @PeterSweden7 that's not feminism. That's just utter dishonesty and manipulation. Just like your claim here.
910487752755470336 2017-09-20 12:56:10 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith why is that relevant at all?

910309242959126528 2017-09-19 01:06:50 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin @AUSPlClOUS the issue is not with her. It's with the process.
910199781137330177 2017-09-19 17:51:53 UTC <icedwater> Read this, but also the replies. @lildumbhyna via @ClandestineYeo https://twitter.com/lildumbhyna/status/909065506635653120
910198312954761217 2017-09-19 17:46:03 UTC <icedwater> @BarbarianEd hmm. So grad students may no longer have to teach. Where will the future potential teachers be trained, YouTube?
910182498683912192 2017-09-19 16:43:12 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice The thing is, to counter the example I introduced, one is not expected to appreciate all parts of another culture... so #itscomplicated.
910181522145030144 2017-09-19 16:39:19 UTC <icedwater> @evolvedpsyche The primary discussion was about Google's spin. You're trying to shoehorn a valid but irrelevant fact into the discussion. Why?
910179731949084672 2017-09-19 16:32:13 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH You'll need to elaborate if you want anyone to agree with you... I'm listening.
910169118753546240 2017-09-19 15:50:02 UTC <icedwater> Typoed an address and got a pleasant? surprise... #throwbacktuesday It looks like the domain has been auto-renewed since 2003?! #fbpic.twitter.com/FxPj1bXt1q
910091404587655170 2017-09-19 10:41:14 UTC <icedwater> @evolvedpsyche the derailing is obvious.
910090773621702657 2017-09-19 10:38:43 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice yes it is a thing. Can't remember where I read, but e.g. "look at this kimmono I found! ew only cats eat raw fish amirite"

909816321973510144 2017-09-18 16:28:09 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH why are you expecting someone else to parrot your viewpoint?
909808122775998464 2017-09-18 15:55:34 UTC <icedwater> @AndriErlingsson ...but how are you saussure?

909790965547675649 2017-09-18 14:47:23 UTC <icedwater> @AndriErlingsson Hmm, looks like Iceland will be preparing for the polls when I visit. Thanks for the thread, @andrierlingsson.https://twitter.com/AndriErlingsson/status/908512372968574977
909785977194921985 2017-09-18 14:27:34 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ "wins" is pretty generous. But I guess she will do a good job.
909599731264847872 2017-09-17 02:07:30 UTC <icedwater> nah they aren't interested in fact.
909371285360205825 2017-09-17 10:59:44 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Telegraph that's how you make future Trumps...

908703813158047746 2017-09-15 14:47:26 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv I got you. But it's technically disqualified from this survey, not from generational consciousness, so uninteresting to me.
908697356995936256 2017-09-15 14:21:47 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv nope. The question was explicitly "in your lifetime", so not surprising at all.
908642878435364864 2017-09-15 10:45:18 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv well... Aren't all the other generations after WW2 by definition?
908642311680139264 2017-09-15 10:43:03 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo ominous. @x_ai it's the end. Do do do do do dooooo-
908506465232498688 2017-09-14 01:43:15 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @polNewsInfinity so we always thought you had to be an adult to be in politics... Apparently not!
908381146278273024 2017-09-14 17:25:16 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith you did in the previous tweet, but the one I replied to had mixed messages.
908363024309690368 2017-09-14 16:13:16 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith because training to lift a random weight is so much more useful.
908361303869210624 2017-09-14 16:06:26 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @ladystormhold probably just me being optimistic about their intentions. Never mind. We shall see.
908281641377849344 2017-09-14 10:49:53 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang you think that's grim for you! I'm already married!
908281065856368640 2017-09-14 10:47:35 UTC <icedwater> @kixes @seanjgleeson maybe someone somewhere had a beebee see what's going on...
908266388996767744 2017-09-14 09:49:16 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold granted, and I'm not asking for opposition which opposes just to fulfil a role. But debate under the shadow of the Whip?
908242513542111232 2017-09-14 08:14:24 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold I agree it's unexpected, but it's something that can go unchallenged because of the composition of Parliament, I suppose?
908168021985726464 2017-09-13 03:18:24 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb bye

907999038745698304 2017-09-13 16:06:55 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya KPI is facilitation. If it doesn't happen, at least he tried...
907998367904493568 2017-09-13 16:04:15 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname wrong. I doubt that the English have a tea party that's been going on for centuries.
907955897732698113 2017-09-13 13:15:29 UTC <icedwater> @KellynnWee at first I thought 3/4 was a new river in the city. :P

907400536093102080 2017-09-11 00:28:41 UTC <icedwater> Hmm, how do we verify this? I agree #1 is absurd, but it feels more like laziness than 350M-a-week malice.https://twitter.com/3XT1/status/907243114091356160

905701015495688192 2017-09-07 07:55:23 UTC <icedwater> @alvations we may be. But we also don't reason in Unicode points. :P
905700126076706817 2017-09-07 07:51:51 UTC <icedwater> And more @ColinKahl - the Cold War was won once. It can be done again. However, is @POTUS as adept as the one then?https://twitter.com/ColinKahl/status/905115066143473666
905694972682223616 2017-09-07 07:31:23 UTC <icedwater> Thread on consistency and reassurance - two things missing from @POTUS right now. Thanks @ColinKahl. #fbhttps://twitter.com/ColinKahl/status/904466218194796544
905691518236672000 2017-09-07 07:17:39 UTC <icedwater> @alvations hmm. If we can't even map translations reliably within languages, why shouldn't we at least be sure the language pair is correct?
905691049980338176 2017-09-07 07:15:47 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale but then if you don't give newbies a chance, where will the development come from? Silos like Young Lions?
905615032045600768 2017-09-06 02:13:43 UTC <icedwater> @OnebadbeochCook there aren't enough eyes to roll for the likes of @charliekirk11 ...
905608486020571136 2017-09-06 01:47:43 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh Can get $70 from ATM. But make sure you got $140 for me. #betterlatethannever
905608123070668800 2017-09-06 01:46:16 UTC <icedwater> @charliekirk11 @OnebadbeochCook he was there, obviously.

905030367052161024 2017-09-05 11:30:28 UTC <icedwater> Kick-off! And I'm stuck outside the stadium... #SINTKM
905030187045199872 2017-09-05 11:29:45 UTC <icedwater> @therisingtithes I thought it was a metaphor for USA, but I was also wondering if there was such a literal city.
904886203723374592 2017-09-04 01:57:37 UTC <icedwater> @therisingtithes thanks for the thread. Intriguing game - was there any literal city built on this, by the way?
904885988408737792 2017-09-04 01:56:46 UTC <icedwater> Read this through, tweet by tweet, and thank @therisingtithes for it later. Also, how's the situation in your land?https://twitter.com/therisingtithes/status/903673879792582656
904884442379968512 2017-09-04 01:50:37 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @RightlyNews I'd be suspicious of anything Fox News reveals, but this is a little disturbing.
904881383155220480 2017-09-04 01:38:28 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @cathythemango! Appreciate, don't appropriate.https://twitter.com/cathythemango/status/903243523809529856

904708513850523649 2017-09-04 14:11:33 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM eww. That sucks.
904511923030450176 2017-09-03 01:10:22 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv intravenous thesaurus infusion for that natural high.

904382725049655301 2017-09-03 16:36:58 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya and they will wonder why the result went the way it did..
904381676842713088 2017-09-03 16:32:49 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith it'd be in my queue behind the Koran. I've had quite enough of Christian-dominated discourse, another perspective would help.
904325390696513537 2017-09-03 12:49:09 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith ugh, missed an apostrophe.
904325336329945088 2017-09-03 12:48:56 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith sure you can. I'll bet your an expert on Islam and Judaism, too.
904311310589976577 2017-09-03 11:53:12 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @singnoname what is midfielders/forwards? 4-06/4-6-0?
904305543396732928 2017-09-03 11:30:17 UTC <icedwater> ooh thanks for the tipoff... Tempting indeed to be able to use data passport at last.
904303440448299008 2017-09-03 11:21:56 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos hey there, been a while. Did Min talk to you or Chi-Loong regarding EngineersSG streaming?
904150093485318144 2017-09-02 01:12:35 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT I wonder when they will also realise what we did, that papering over the cracks isn't a long-term fix...

903232510275887105 2017-08-31 12:26:26 UTC <icedwater> Singapore 1-0 down at half-time thanks to an early Chan Siu Ki stunner off the bar. Lions doing well otherwise #bringbacktheroar #SINHKG #fb

903161897872007168 2017-08-31 07:45:51 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA extra "letter" please. Also, reminds me of "Curry Gardenn" @yazbanz @RainforestSHub
903161492278673408 2017-08-31 07:44:14 UTC <icedwater> @eisen try 1967 and 2067? More likely...
903161240821743616 2017-08-31 07:43:14 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname ooo I used to do that at Karaoke :)
903157180450226183 2017-08-31 07:27:06 UTC <icedwater> @pohui Thought that might be the case. It's OK, thanks for replying :)
903156458031783937 2017-08-31 07:24:14 UTC <icedwater> @pohui ooh. I like the clear bottle. Can I trouble you to buy some back to add to my collection?pic.twitter.com/QGxWemM69y

903135820344729601 2017-08-30 06:02:13 UTC <icedwater> I was told about an @ALB_S_FC press conference yesterday. More of this in #sgfootball, please, #sleague! http://www.footballpodcast.sg/2017/08/young-singaporeans-stretching-wings.html #fb
903058782074265600 2017-08-30 00:56:06 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog @ChannelNewsAsia so... It wasn't possible before the ethnic reservation?!

903042282097541120 2017-08-30 23:50:32 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well yes, but you still haven't proven your wild assertion at the beginning.
902941855481872384 2017-08-30 17:11:28 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith again not something I can disagree with, but you're not proving your initial point either.
902941556583284736 2017-08-30 17:10:17 UTC <icedwater> @sailorhg @wilkieii @ThatAndromeda did you have to force push this one though...
902939687404265472 2017-08-30 17:02:51 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @RJMcGirr is there an "all there is" though? I agree, 2 years is too short to consider yourself done. But is even 10 enough?
902938194676662272 2017-08-30 16:56:56 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith yes, but putting up statues of fascists is sensationalist rubbish as far as I know. Why would you do that?
902933057774075905 2017-08-30 16:36:31 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @That_IjebuBadoo so ... A white icon in a field that black people made great :p
902872887949803520 2017-08-30 12:37:25 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith is there any evidence of this "context", though?
902713132979597312 2017-08-29 02:02:37 UTC <icedwater> @FrankConniff because transgender people don't exist and that's just an excuse to dodge the draft...
902697434798735360 2017-08-29 01:00:14 UTC <icedwater> @jaspar @DoctorShimapan because boys don't wear pink shoes.
902695988174786560 2017-08-29 00:54:29 UTC <icedwater> @tocsg worth a re-read, thanks! But what if the Government required that all e-payment providers use a common national API for consistency?
902428135085314048 2017-08-29 07:10:08 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz what BS. LOL.
902393140237107200 2017-08-28 04:51:04 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz @GaryKLH the amount of money, time and talent for coaching Schooling can get Eunos Crescent into SLeague top 3.
902316496747061248 2017-08-28 23:46:31 UTC <icedwater> @NeilHumphreys @FourFourTwoSG not sure what the argument is. Weren't they already going to leave after NS?

901708758379724800 2017-08-27 07:31:35 UTC <icedwater> @BrianBlues yup! It wasn't a big deal, personal preference, though there seems to be more explicit curator code of conduct since :p
901708085793701888 2017-08-27 07:28:55 UTC <icedwater> Yep. Thanks @tomhpollock for this thread. But I guess trial and error is the best way to learn for some...https://twitter.com/tomhpollock/status/900659090699014145

901653228860743680 2017-08-26 03:50:56 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang hi! Just wondering, how did you like Bodacious? I am thinking of getting the next @teteatetesg there in October :)
901512491640934400 2017-08-26 18:31:41 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid @nicshields this also, but 33 lah.
901508527226617856 2017-08-26 18:15:56 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @quacko_quack for the past week as @hellofrmSG, and for keeping your word :) Also welcome @havesomepatty for this shift!

901474352520085504 2017-08-26 16:00:08 UTC <icedwater> @PinkDotSG @vanguardshep @AudiKhalid @Xiaxue meh. You're more likely to change the pronoun here than the jail term there.
901472413774266368 2017-08-26 15:52:26 UTC <icedwater> @BasedMonitored @neiljhk if they have a smartphone, sure.
901386616954003456 2017-08-26 10:11:31 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @WeRWorld! Let's see what happens here when I play this. Should be a useful idea for all #rocur too I think!pic.twitter.com/Hk2xcyL92R

901385748573585408 2017-08-26 10:08:04 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz oh dear. What was it this time...?
901384061314138115 2017-08-26 10:01:21 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @BasedMonitored smartphones prevent fear and hunger? Who knew!
901383671420043265 2017-08-26 09:59:48 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA you missed out D for Dog.
901379890972213248 2017-08-26 09:44:47 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers @jaudrius wow. If my @xiaomi phone had that I'd save a ton of space, but gotta reinstall apps I stop using for over a day.
901379459533504512 2017-08-26 09:43:04 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid wah. Cynical max...

901346576303403012 2017-08-26 07:32:24 UTC <icedwater> @noellemartine mm yeah. Oh well. Not sure if there is an explicit code of conduct for curators :p
901328583376871424 2017-08-25 06:20:54 UTC <icedwater> @noellemartine I don't know if authority is needed, but it's a Twitter account too, and hosts have that prerogative. Why should we limit it?
901270232055988225 2017-08-25 02:29:02 UTC <icedwater> @abanghazrul lol. Neural lace.  "Alamak headache. I forgot to update Windows Brain 2020, cannot think properly..."
901116299136294912 2017-08-25 16:17:22 UTC <icedwater> @Thfakehipster oh hi!
901107121181179904 2017-08-25 15:40:54 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 ah right, apparently I'd remembered Islam as beginning in 6 AD, instead of 6th century AD. My bad.
901081492838768640 2017-08-25 13:59:03 UTC <icedwater> @eisen I don't know. I typed like 3 paras and they got eaten, so I tried to repeat it in the replies.
901081317109923842 2017-08-25 13:58:21 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 do you know when Islam began?
901050742173089792 2017-08-25 11:56:52 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 and what religion do you suppose those Arabs were practicing...?
901050293055389696 2017-08-25 11:55:05 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 I haven't seen this point on the page, but wouldn't 500 years after Christ's death be 900 years before Columbus?
901050042760306689 2017-08-25 11:54:05 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 that wasn't my point, and you know it. Don't be ridiculous.
901049904021127169 2017-08-25 11:53:32 UTC <icedwater> @pjpersson92 I'm not sure you're reading right. Let me verify.
901049775964827649 2017-08-25 11:53:01 UTC <icedwater> @pjpersson92 nope. If your style is poor, people need to take more effort to understand you.
900979903893458944 2017-08-25 07:15:23 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 well, good style isn't everything, but poor style affects understanding.
900979736213569537 2017-08-25 07:14:43 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 did you read that page I sent? It's a starting point. I'm learning as I go along, too.
900975919581376512 2017-08-24 06:59:33 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai aiyah be Elsa la. #letitgo
900967113145294848 2017-08-24 06:24:33 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @heysayfey it's "for my sake" so that I "don't get triggered" by smallcaps that HE is blocking ME. Not sure about the logic there.
900966858899181569 2017-08-24 06:23:32 UTC <icedwater> I will end with this: if you're in the habit of insinuating things, you'll read between the lines every time. Grow some skin, @quacko_quack.
900966322552545281 2017-08-24 06:21:25 UTC <icedwater> I'm surprised that I was apparently insinuating something, but whatever. Just remember to unblock me @/hellofrmsg.pic.twitter.com/kYQa5yn0j0
900965479707156480 2017-08-24 06:18:04 UTC <icedwater> I wrote a nice long reply DM. It was eaten since I can't DM those who aren't following me. So that, above all else, annoys me. @/hellofrmsg
900964977909026816 2017-08-24 06:16:04 UTC <icedwater> @drdelusional the second one, apparently. It's OK. People have limits :)
900962538690560001 2017-08-24 06:06:22 UTC <icedwater> I sometimes offend on Twitter, but usually it's targeted at people who deserve it. People who've met me offline know. Sorry @/hellofrmsg.
900961647631532032 2017-08-24 06:02:50 UTC <icedwater> I'm not going to give a "sorry if you're offended" non-apology, I'm not preparing for Parliament. @/hellofrmsg, thanks for the DM.
900961191261913088 2017-08-24 06:01:01 UTC <icedwater> So @/hellofrmsg took issue to with my jibes, and has blocked me. Well, I suppose I crossed a line this time. I couldn't DM back, obviously.
900933086023634948 2017-08-24 04:09:20 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG probably before you master punctuation ;)
900890774002221056 2017-08-24 01:21:12 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 I didn't know either, but look: http://www.raceandhistory.com/historicalviews/ancientamerica.htm and Ivan Van Sertima's 1975 book "They Came Before Columbus".
900889077876011008 2017-08-24 01:14:28 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @pjpersson92 nobody has to spell perfectly, but it helps getting a point across if you have one. You know a truth? Good for you.

900755905645494274 2017-08-24 16:25:17 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid they probably do, but are constrained by several bottom lines... Public sector responsibility too maybe?
900755563281211392 2017-08-24 16:23:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG this is your personal choice, but I strongly believe it is a terrible one. Nonetheless, good on you for doing it your way.
900751126529572864 2017-08-24 16:06:18 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid another profession that can't stop thinking of work.. or is that just us being Singaporean :p

900626423114735617 2017-08-24 07:50:46 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG at some point we'll need a power bank in case we need to park somewhere...
900622802708975616 2017-08-24 07:36:23 UTC <icedwater> @meganne121 have you spoken to a Muslim recently?
900613044627062785 2017-08-23 06:57:37 UTC <icedwater> @meganne121 uh huh. Okay.

900535279353712640 2017-08-23 01:48:36 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin @gabrielquak7 again???? Is the question I would have asked :p
900535121815769088 2017-08-23 01:47:58 UTC <icedwater> @xychelsea their logic: using a name that's no longer valid will shrivel up all courage in the deadnamed person and ward them off. #facepalm
900534399044771840 2017-08-23 01:45:06 UTC <icedwater> @xychelsea he's right you know. They haven't watered down racism one bit.

900530811711045632 2017-08-23 01:30:51 UTC <icedwater> @RealJamesWoods #BlueLivesMatter is a pathetic response to an actual cause. Don't equate that to #BlackLivesMatter.

899913978490437632 2017-08-22 08:39:46 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @bobby we think it's a misspelling... Maybe it was a Freudian slip
899904323613741057 2017-08-22 08:01:24 UTC <icedwater> Having fond memories of @RainforestSHub eh @YZD24? ;)
899903722280566785 2017-08-22 07:59:01 UTC <icedwater> thinking process requires input, yes, but it takes concepts already perceived. I consider that the next level. :P
899901298400571392 2017-08-22 07:49:23 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold yeah... I'd think a lot of subtweets happen because context is missing, right?
899899865752158208 2017-08-22 07:43:41 UTC <icedwater> umm... Nope? Thoughts are generated from perception... Which is input?
899850087731404800 2017-08-21 04:25:53 UTC <icedwater> @Snaxx44 thought so. :)
899814706193367041 2017-08-21 02:05:18 UTC <icedwater> @Snaxx44 I guess you meant Prince of the Streets, and "thug" as a compliment. :)
899658186042494976 2017-08-21 15:43:21 UTC <icedwater> @alwaystheself I guess it's not one with a trivial answer...
899643305918464000 2017-08-21 14:44:13 UTC <icedwater> @laudermusic I was referring to you, actually. :)
899482705368195073 2017-08-20 04:06:03 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail hmm?

899121916371378177 2017-08-19 04:12:24 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue that somehow sounds German.
899113896052523008 2017-08-19 03:40:32 UTC <icedwater> @bethshoraya who says appropriation must be between cultures?
899047175300055040 2017-08-19 23:15:24 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @OurEyeOnIslam pity they're not the same. Every child lost is a tragedy, but circumstances matter and they're completely different.
898855867059130368 2017-08-19 10:35:13 UTC <icedwater> @alwaystheself #IfWhiteSupremacyEnded the power vacuum would invite many warring factions in to claim their stake... Would States secede?
898741584342032384 2017-08-18 03:01:06 UTC <icedwater> @DVetZer0 didn't see that coming at all, white boy :)
898724456025030656 2017-08-18 01:53:02 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz that one separate issue... I also agree but I know even less there, how @sgolympics
898680401144627200 2017-08-18 22:57:58 UTC <icedwater> @alwaystheself what a Fermat :p
898679531367579648 2017-08-18 22:54:31 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid to what end? To state that despite having no oil reserves we're doing fairly well, or...?
898678616656977920 2017-08-18 22:50:53 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @DanAmira @yoloswagginns http://prn.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell-prn?a=d&d=PRN19800701.2.10&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN------ and https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/realestate/fifth-avenue-bonwit-teller-opulence-lost.html?referer=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/ points to a 1980 NYT piece I've not found
898675184164421632 2017-08-18 22:37:15 UTC <icedwater> @sgolympics @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH the key of course is how development takes place outside these tournaments. Not do development there.
898674698132664322 2017-08-18 22:35:19 UTC <icedwater> @sgolympics @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH besides, other countries continued to send water polo teams for 26 years. Philippines still does netball.
898674364102483972 2017-08-18 22:33:59 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH no, @sgolympics may try, but it will be appealed. I'd rather also send the women's and futsal teams.
898671005169704960 2017-08-18 22:20:38 UTC <icedwater> Lovely statuette, @libshipwreck. Thanks to @halleluyang and @pnh for the RT.https://twitter.com/libshipwreck/status/898235281429680130
898667096703238144 2017-08-18 22:05:06 UTC <icedwater> @baba_Omoloro it's Papua New Guinea. It takes up half an island to the north of Australia. Quite large, really...pic.twitter.com/jOa5UAkSzB
898665032174542848 2017-08-18 21:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @kolatubosun apparently quite a few do on Twitter. But the "silent" majority probably don't.
898663925574582272 2017-08-18 21:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @stephhegarty you also live in Lagos, according to your Twitter profile. May I know your thoughts please?
898663165298262016 2017-08-18 21:49:29 UTC <icedwater> @baba_Omoloro you do know that several things may have the same acronym, right?

898507095883919360 2017-08-18 11:29:19 UTC <icedwater> @WUjvari and yes. You can only pay attention to it by looking behind, not forward.
898490476696813570 2017-08-18 10:23:17 UTC <icedwater> @WUjvari keep ignoring history. That way each time it runs you over it's a novel challenge you don't know what to do with.
898490189818978304 2017-08-18 10:22:09 UTC <icedwater> @DVetZer0 maybe help to fix the English on that graphic you're so proud of first?

898419103857205248 2017-08-17 05:39:40 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @GaryKLH @dazhan14 that said, I would like for there to be simplicity in personalised designs. That jersey just fatigues me.
898416889419898882 2017-08-17 05:30:52 UTC <icedwater> Read this long thread from @alwaystheself about inherent racism and collective memory. What is relevant here?https://twitter.com/alwaystheself/status/897935593660919808
898400485412978688 2017-08-17 04:25:41 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @commonlynoun oh the kopipass is back? Cool!
898399708648849412 2017-08-17 04:22:36 UTC <icedwater> @Tat_Loo are you capable of properly finishing an argument, or do you just skim Wikipedia for retorts? That's a separate issue.
898399417706860545 2017-08-17 04:21:27 UTC <icedwater> @JennLi123 lol!
898398899622223872 2017-08-17 04:19:23 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo also going to http://www.24k.com.sg you get this lovely widescreen-first autoscroll... "systen". See for yourself.
898390168528330753 2017-08-17 03:44:42 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake if you ask me, the fact that it's based on Java is already the biggest minus. But I'm kinda biased.
898387869009494017 2017-08-17 03:35:33 UTC <icedwater> @Tat_Loo we do. It's just got its consequences. Why would you spit on the road?
898384686807867392 2017-08-17 03:22:55 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz lol. 2 matches in 2 hours is not back-to-back. It's simultaneous. 90 minutes plus half-time and injury time  2h 
898382502955335680 2017-08-17 03:14:14 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA "we had to play two matches in two hours. our boys tried their best"

898269873779777536 2017-08-17 19:46:41 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale people in sales can be very good at pretending they don't understand the kind of things people in engineering have to do ;)
898263740528828416 2017-08-17 19:22:19 UTC <icedwater> @NarratedPOTUS but wait... Does RT  endorsement have to be explicitly stated now, or is it just because it's POTUS?

897533229392994305 2017-08-15 18:59:31 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv we can't be the first generation to realise this. Are we just getting more comfy with hypocrisy? Or are we closer to solving it?

897475652001054720 2017-08-15 15:10:44 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith darn your house privilege. For us basements, if at all, are garages for the whole block of high-rise housing. ;)
897475301009006592 2017-08-15 15:09:20 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai thanks for doing my job for me. The beat goes on. And on... #notsponsoredbythem @ofmeowandbake

896870389254463489 2017-08-13 23:05:38 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith just because it hasn't worked for you doesn't mean it can't work for anyone.
896870192139063297 2017-08-13 23:04:51 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith how much more likely does having "insufficient real life company" make you to accuse others of "virtue signalling"?
896869284860710912 2017-08-13 23:01:15 UTC <icedwater> @literacyisgood lol
896641747442221057 2017-08-13 07:57:06 UTC <icedwater> probably why they are not keen on having that happen to them...

896375354822086656 2017-08-12 14:18:33 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname yeah this was 7.20 till 9.50 I think, a song or two shorter than one would expect?
896375011497263104 2017-08-12 14:17:11 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA nah. https://hairforhope.org.sg though the website won't have my name as I didn't register in time, just walked in.

896371950666227712 2017-08-12 14:05:01 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname it was about 2h 30 with the encores, not too bad I'd say.
896365179440553985 2017-08-12 13:38:07 UTC <icedwater> Although it would be nice if we could get rid of Ann Khor. "On-core", ladies and gentlemen! #ModulesNUSNeverHad #GEM20xx #fb

896278980658999296 2017-08-12 07:55:35 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld @loddlaen someone should totally make a Russian translation though!
896068750528598016 2017-08-11 18:00:12 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith wait, wasn't this one of the "moderates" you mentioned? Or is that view "informed by religion"?
896068180283543552 2017-08-11 17:57:56 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 wahahahaha

896065425057792001 2017-08-11 17:47:00 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname no, but the competition to which you submitted the questions is.
896062764862513152 2017-08-11 17:36:25 UTC <icedwater> @itsbalamano you can already arrive at @ChangiAirport via T1-3. Why would you need a T4?
896062428210806784 2017-08-11 17:35:05 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname two days later, you would add: "trivia questions based on" to that thought.
896055735045443585 2017-08-11 17:08:29 UTC <icedwater> What is a forward-looking memorialhttps://twitter.com/eisen/status/895138866029445120

896033912958238721 2017-08-11 15:41:47 UTC <icedwater> @Mfhaseeb "now a days"? It's always been this way. @Snowden
896005433042677762 2017-08-11 13:48:36 UTC <icedwater> @eisen does Singapore want to take over as the "regional hub for tropical depressions"?

895998516933218309 2017-08-11 13:21:07 UTC <icedwater> Deyto slides out of the box, almost carrying the ball out with him. He hasn't shown the safer pair of hands tonight. 90+' 1-2 #GLOBOE #sgcup

895997678240256001 2017-08-11 13:17:47 UTC <icedwater> Global seem now more intent to hold up play even on the counter than to find security in a fourth goal. 89' 1-2 #GLOBOE #sgcup
895997183496822784 2017-08-11 13:15:50 UTC <icedwater> On the plus side, Global are finally closing down where Boeung Ket were given tons of time and space before. 85' 1-2 #GLOBOE #sgcup

895996573569757184 2017-08-11 13:13:24 UTC <icedwater> Sorry. I've been remiss. Global now trail 2-1 thanks to a 65th-minute goal from Omogba, heading in at the far post. 85' 1-2 #GLOBOE #sgcup

895973995987599360 2017-08-11 11:43:41 UTC <icedwater> Apparently not! Boeung Ket level the scores in short order, Ajayi Samuel setting up Khuon Laboravy for a tap-in. 1-1 10' #GLOBOE #sgcup
895972833817313280 2017-08-11 11:39:04 UTC <icedwater> Global have picked up their first goal of the evening and all but shut up shop. 1-0 tonight, 4-1 on aggregate. 5' #GLOBOE #sgcup
895971163976777728 2017-08-11 11:32:26 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake tried it before. Need to download the app to do it I think? At least not available on the website. Have you managed to do it?
895970789622595584 2017-08-11 11:30:57 UTC <icedwater> Gonna miss kickoff at #GLOBOE tonight. Global Cebu, helmed by former @MightyStags coach Akbar Nawas, leads Boeung Ket 3-1. #sgcup #fb

895624853654454274 2017-08-10 12:36:19 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well with the left the government will be big enough that these can be simultaneously true. And the latter can fix the former.

895463865726582785 2017-08-09 01:56:37 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue if it is, it's nothing more than that - a signal of intent. Things have happened.

894513778863226880 2017-08-07 11:01:18 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith might well have been. But summarising science is pretty tricky.
894513037041778688 2017-08-07 10:58:21 UTC <icedwater> Heh. I prefer reply @yazbanz ;)https://twitter.com/yazbanz/status/894010671112667136
894512902375317504 2017-08-07 10:57:49 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz why leh?
894512228568662017 2017-08-07 10:55:09 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith does not invalidate the actual headline though. More diversity isn't always enough diversity.
894512041368576000 2017-08-07 10:54:24 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well, suggest follow-up research :)
894510607877062656 2017-08-07 10:48:42 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 maybe it's not a coincidence :p

894371860619509761 2017-08-06 01:37:22 UTC <icedwater> @cjwerleman @rd10393 better unjust reality in one context than absurd fantasy in a completely different one? Okay, I suppose.

894369997547491330 2017-08-06 01:29:58 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith something happening over 60 years isn't enough of a trend?
894369802550075392 2017-08-06 01:29:12 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith now to 60 years ago isn't enough for an average?
894042248538603520 2017-08-05 03:47:37 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @bargeboards no, the only way to find out is to go in and have a session. :)

893882901669879808 2017-08-05 17:14:25 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith are you saying random sampling isn't a thing, or all movies are equally significant in cultural impact...

893635870502277122 2017-08-04 00:52:49 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith apparently the Clintons were in Frozen all along... Or should we let it go...

893485443051692033 2017-08-04 14:55:04 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter funny how when people see football $ like this they know it's an exception. But when they see this in biz, "I can do it too" :p
893480446557773825 2017-08-04 14:35:13 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice @eisen YOU need a website. Dunno if that or the Karlie Kloss thing is worse...
893476432235552768 2017-08-04 14:19:16 UTC <icedwater> @tsion @premie45 that's plainly untrue.
893476374354075648 2017-08-04 14:19:02 UTC <icedwater> @atomicthumbs some people only accept their version of the world. @premie45 @tsion

893285440945442820 2017-08-03 01:40:20 UTC <icedwater> @darakerr hi! Just read your 2014 piece https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-cell-phone-battery-explodes-in-mans-pocket/ a friend talked about a Samsung explosion in 2016. Did you ever get a reply?
893283509753663489 2017-08-03 01:32:39 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh what

893279556148142080 2017-08-03 01:16:57 UTC <icedwater> @Ali_Pettitt that's because of where you are. Just saying...
893178195771506688 2017-08-03 18:34:10 UTC <icedwater> @mdnoorhadi the code doesn't work for me. Is the league full? :P
893069368975736833 2017-08-03 11:21:44 UTC <icedwater> @skinnylatte love that mindset and I don't think I've ever left. I'll buy boots and balls but always be ready to go with crushed-up paper.
893068262702960640 2017-08-03 11:17:20 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld 0 is Indian, I think, the rest were probably Arabic?

892620993335705600 2017-08-01 05:40:03 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline also see the replies :p
892576368948527105 2017-08-01 02:42:44 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline @AdamFlinter apparently, if you meant British Cockney
892574678975303680 2017-08-01 02:36:01 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline I know and agree. But Uber sounds more like the original lyric. That's all there was to it :)
892573166530248705 2017-08-01 02:30:00 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline Grab's toxic, I'm taking Uber

892547756132147200 2017-08-01 00:49:02 UTC <icedwater> @miyagi wah classic. Who was commentator at the time? Certainly not Brian Richmond, or was he already active? @eisen
892543711812308993 2017-08-01 00:32:58 UTC <icedwater> @danlevene indeed. Let's see if we can also ditch this part of the legacy.
892527925785894914 2017-08-01 23:30:14 UTC <icedwater> @danlevene do you know where we inherited 377a from though?
892500638185041920 2017-08-01 21:41:48 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith maybe you think you're just a vector, but I'm a real person not a collection of data points.
892496388356952064 2017-08-01 21:24:55 UTC <icedwater> @Raiyanskop his main talent seems to be getting injured.
892495064638775297 2017-08-01 21:19:39 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail all that's left is to attack
892494943628935168 2017-08-01 21:19:10 UTC <icedwater> She knows this song all too well, it seems. Thanks @KellynnWee for the insight on TS.https://twitter.com/KellynnWee/status/891767819896971264
892483304510767104 2017-08-01 20:32:55 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith and sweep all the bigotry that's been revealed back under the carpet? Nah. Let's begin the healing process.
892252881935519745 2017-07-31 05:17:18 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @ladystormhold I do :)
892227514680070144 2017-07-31 03:36:30 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake lol.
892214822229598208 2017-07-31 02:46:04 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c ah. Apple lives on controversy, I'm sometimes given to thinking. But yes, those are two different things... Thanks.
892208514340225024 2017-07-31 02:21:00 UTC <icedwater> @avalon yup that's fair. Hope you're coping a little better at least.
892202199752753152 2017-07-31 01:55:55 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c which is it? That Apple by closing the VPN is contradicting its pro-privacy stance?
892200170368020480 2017-07-31 01:47:51 UTC <icedwater> @SelaNehanda I'm not sure those two things are correlated though. Publicly-available typefaces are used by non-designers too.
892198111958794240 2017-07-31 01:39:40 UTC <icedwater> @avalon can Sayang help?
892193786515701760 2017-07-31 01:22:29 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith it is real life. We just think otherwise.
892188058266632193 2017-07-31 00:59:43 UTC <icedwater> You know, @SteveWilton88 you realise Christ wasn't a white person?
892187759082786816 2017-07-31 00:58:32 UTC <icedwater> @funkshin @ladystormhold @hellofrmSG @AdamFlinter curriculum is just a starting point. All content goes obsolete. Attitude is important.
892187168780632064 2017-07-31 00:56:11 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @ladystormhold no, I hit the quota too. Never mind, ignore me :p
892056553037086720 2017-07-31 16:17:10 UTC <icedwater> @wrathofgnon he may have thought some of it out, but he can't have been involved in the implementation details. He had good help.
892055970515345408 2017-07-31 16:14:51 UTC <icedwater> @jongaunt @JackPosobiec @RoyMiddleton10 oh, good. MS Paint users have learned to Photoshop.
892055480855445504 2017-07-31 16:12:54 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @ladystormhold but seriously, a running track in the library? Next they'll build tuition centres in the steeplechase pits.
892055100209766401 2017-07-31 16:11:24 UTC <icedwater> @STcom @ladystormhold thanks for copying it for us! I just prefer my news from non-@STCom sources ;) dunno about @ofmeowandbake
892052120580407296 2017-07-31 15:59:33 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter you still do that on Sundays right?
892050958712135681 2017-07-31 15:54:56 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish The test must be passed. For the sake of KPI We will soon forget.
892050345123233792 2017-07-31 15:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @funkshin @ladystormhold @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG is it really the curriculum's job to prepare a student for the market?
892050192463036416 2017-07-31 15:51:54 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake ya because we are both too cheap to pay :p
892049139420192768 2017-07-31 15:47:42 UTC <icedwater> @sutdsg @techreview would have been cheaper to keep the bumblebees alive in the first place...

892001778262200321 2017-07-31 12:39:31 UTC <icedwater> @wrathofgnon I wonder what you might think of how Singapore has done its "social housing"...
891927077674295297 2017-07-31 07:42:41 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake congratulations, I suppose?
891848756739559425 2017-07-30 02:31:28 UTC <icedwater> @Molitics hahahahaha
891835147649138688 2017-07-30 01:37:23 UTC <icedwater> @noellemartine yup, I left her out for dramatic effect :p @hellofrmSG
891833234325094400 2017-07-30 01:29:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG got recommendation? Or was it just kopitiam standard?
891828609014407169 2017-07-30 01:11:24 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling @hellofrmSG don't give @heelstatement ideas! I'm almost afraid to attend their next event now... when was it again? ;)
891826536159911937 2017-07-30 01:03:10 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG violence is good when we know it's not meant. (cc: @SgProWrestling @heelstatement)
891826238775377920 2017-07-30 01:01:59 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname oh! I hadn't known Asia Bagus ran 92-2000 and was part Japanese. #OneNightInBeijing #GreaterEastAsiaCoCelebritySphere
891825180535803904 2017-07-30 00:57:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG coffee might help :)  but I know Emoji Coffee is as good a coffee as Emoji Movie is a Movie, so do get some of the real stuff!
891824566124675072 2017-07-30 00:55:20 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname this was also the time after Talentime had just been superseded by Asia Bagus, right?
891822942660640768 2017-07-30 00:48:53 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname most wouldn't care, we were quite biased towards English at the time - I'm just curious. @hellofrmSG @Medizin_Wookiee
891822601072287744 2017-07-30 00:47:32 UTC <icedwater> To continue the thread, though, @singnoname - which non-English songs would you have mentioned for that era?https://twitter.com/hellofrmSG/status/891821126526976000
891822076713029632 2017-07-30 00:45:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG fair enough. But don't take it personally; as a trained debater @singnoname is very focused on objective fact, never the person.
891821586906464256 2017-07-30 00:43:30 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG nah, you weren't the only one naming songs at the time of @singnoname's observation.
891821241643880448 2017-07-30 00:42:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I wonder if the golden era @singnoname meant also applied to, e.g., Malay, Tamil, Indonesian, Tagalog, Lao...
891820434315853824 2017-07-30 00:38:55 UTC <icedwater> I see where you're coming from and I agree, but national radio wasn't just in English. @hellofrmSG @singnoname

891683799297253378 2017-07-30 15:35:59 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG back then "Fergie" only meant one thing #TheresOnlyOneUnited
891683221666021376 2017-07-30 15:33:41 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG well, sorry, miscounted. Off by a few years :p
891682983194656768 2017-07-30 15:32:44 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hmm. They would have named Baa Baa Black Sheep or Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, I guess ;)
891682450182594560 2017-07-30 15:30:37 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname yeah the other day I walked past some thyme in the supermarket and almost said hi to @basilyeo
891681870001324033 2017-07-30 15:28:19 UTC <icedwater> @DFB_3Liga keine Sorge... Wir starten sonst immer zu stark und halten nicht durch. Mal die Saison umgedreht zu haben ist auch gut!

890944635748601860 2017-07-28 14:38:48 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz yeah many places for that, we found.
890936215645544450 2017-07-28 14:05:21 UTC <icedwater> Fans started going after @dwu00 complained about them. Nice. #TampinesIsASlum #SlumsHaveEarspic.twitter.com/zQyh0DTzT3

890889368193323008 2017-07-28 10:59:11 UTC <icedwater> Half an hour to #sleague kickoff #TAMDPM and I'm nowhere near the ground. Typical. I'd blame #TampinesIsASlum but I'm not wholly innocent :)
890888897701355520 2017-07-28 10:57:19 UTC <icedwater> @danlevene hello! @peterhone said you were in town for the ICC this week. How has it been so far, other than for the pints being expensive?
890887021081673728 2017-07-28 10:49:52 UTC <icedwater> If every tenth person here went to #TAMDPM or any other #sleague game, there would always be a capacity crowd. #FBpic.twitter.com/SQSMxGE5PT
890886672375726080 2017-07-28 10:48:29 UTC <icedwater> It seems these things are happening more frequently now. Button redesign needed? Or scenario review to reduce emergencies? #smrt

890456898385747969 2017-07-26 06:20:43 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv not bad, but how much should we want "watch me search" and "watch me email"?
890428195920502784 2017-07-26 04:26:39 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith "healthcare is a right" seems a different kind of misunderstanding from "right to bear arms"... right?
890427801102188544 2017-07-26 04:25:05 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith LOL! I'm glad that some colour has got in since they were last checked. But still... not even representative, right?

890101668553121792 2017-07-25 06:49:09 UTC <icedwater> @JohnSobieski3 @Alpman2000 I suppose the point here was the spin Obama put on that fact. But I'm yet to properly read the article.

889865204565106690 2017-07-25 15:09:32 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @ladystormhold a day late, sorry. But "most jobs that require degrees pay better" is different from "most jobs require degrees".
889864263996547074 2017-07-25 15:05:48 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @ladystormhold I actually think "most" is off here... I'd wager the majority of jobs in Singapore still don't require a degree.

889786876755820544 2017-07-25 09:58:17 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname what's wrong with a well-coloured disciple? :P
889786200600399872 2017-07-25 09:55:36 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @JPY_Kurdish oh dear. What an unprecedented act that no non-Muslim has ever done before.
889785889676644353 2017-07-25 09:54:22 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue lol I mean...
889776528468328453 2017-07-25 09:17:10 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter I can understand for lengthy qualification processes. But none of those were targets for the LionsXII. Rather @yglions.
889776277846020097 2017-07-25 09:16:10 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter OK, sounds logical. But LionsXII? Different story. Half the squad ineligible for SEA Games. No express AFC aims either.
889773918445215745 2017-07-25 09:06:48 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter show me where: just Olympics? I'll check http://FIFA.com. In any case, I don't think those rules apply.
889773166242832384 2017-07-25 09:03:48 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter the Lions pre-1994 represented @FASingapore in Malaysia, but that name has since been inherited by the national team.
889771616418144257 2017-07-25 08:57:39 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter the LionsXII had many overage players who played a significant role throughout the season, so you can't call them a U23.
889771428593057793 2017-07-25 08:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter 2nd is false because if just one 19-year-old plays every game for a U15 team, the fact ten others are U15 is irrelevant.
889770765314281472 2017-07-25 08:54:16 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter the parochial malaise has been around regardless of age level. Therefore distinguishing U-23 and full is irrelevant.
889770345506291712 2017-07-25 08:52:36 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter 1st irrelevant because we were satisfied by Causeway Derbies and LionsXII all these years despite poor performances.
889770026546352129 2017-07-25 08:51:20 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 @AdamFlinter 1st statement yes but irrelevant. 2nd statement no. LionsXII were no Lions and certainly not U23. Do not conflate them.
889490954570276865 2017-07-24 14:22:24 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @orbigood hmm. I was looking at tueetor earlier but haven't read the T&Cs. Might you have used it before?

889463183429087232 2017-07-24 12:32:03 UTC <icedwater> In the league, beat Malaysia enough. In youth, beat Brunei enough. Somehow still #international standard lah #sgfootball... @YZD24
889462661334814720 2017-07-24 12:29:58 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish ya. Why would anyone celebrate being cooped up like this? Sure, it may be a feat of engineering...

888924143520841733 2017-07-22 00:50:05 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue imponiert, oder?
888923448407236608 2017-07-22 00:47:20 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya I'm sorry. You have to say that in Chinese to be understood ;)

888698566457176064 2017-07-22 09:53:44 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter it's been a standard Muslim greeting since I was young. Don't know about Arabisation. Or MAS. But I am not surprised.
888661101868601344 2017-07-22 07:24:51 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart and you're to blame #givingawayage
888586638862897152 2017-07-21 02:28:58 UTC <icedwater> @KellynnWee no problem, I did the easy job. Thanks for the thread :)
888586550715367425 2017-07-21 02:28:37 UTC <icedwater> lol what @abearfromSEA
888567072598315008 2017-07-21 01:11:13 UTC <icedwater> @HomeUtdFC may I know the circumstances under which he was forced to adapt to a new position?
888565171328659456 2017-07-21 01:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA because rumours are fun. Who needs fact when you can make fiction :)
888444750872707073 2017-07-21 17:05:09 UTC <icedwater> Class formulation in Singapore: what role does how we see PRC migrants play? @KellynnWee tweets off an #icas10 talk.https://twitter.com/KellynnWee/status/888269283255476224
888404516877488128 2017-07-21 14:25:17 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk that's all right. You've earned it this time. You don't often get things right anyway :)
888394540733693954 2017-07-21 13:45:38 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk so I replied to the wrong tweet. Big deal. Does that make you feel more intelligent?
888300295809150976 2017-07-21 07:31:08 UTC <icedwater> @OffencePolice @neiljhk I agree, but the headline frames the way the article will be read. Even if facts are properly presented later.
888274602203336705 2017-07-20 05:49:03 UTC <icedwater> fair, I suppose. She might even be happier outside. To be honest I think they were only keeping her because of the movie.
888261579594121217 2017-07-20 04:57:18 UTC <icedwater> nah. What she did is no grounds for release when compared with other folks. Probably some other punishment?
888230322067746816 2017-07-20 02:53:05 UTC <icedwater> @OffencePolice @neiljhk so it's a standard abuse of the language committed by British headline writers. OK.
888209756376006657 2017-07-20 01:31:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG happy birthday! :)
888205989882679296 2017-07-20 01:16:24 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith also, nice work derailing their efforts onto drone strike opposition... I'm starting to think your tweets are dron(ing) strikes.
888205536499453953 2017-07-20 01:14:36 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith drone strike targets are identified by the phones they use? Really puts a cooling on the secondhand market...
888205268005171201 2017-07-20 01:13:32 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith what's this "trading phones" bit about?
888204896478019584 2017-07-20 01:12:04 UTC <icedwater> @forgottenleaves @hammerqos why does it have to be a dichotomy though? There can be social considerations in capitalist economies.
888204531921633280 2017-07-20 01:10:37 UTC <icedwater> @PrisonPlanet @JodieElfwick @EagleReturns @neiljhk @TracyK199 also, not all Muslims can "go back to Iraq" as most didn't come from there.
888204039845957632 2017-07-20 01:08:39 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @OffencePolice it does look like those 4 alone owe 700m in taxes, doesn't it? Headlines are tricky.
888202583961067520 2017-07-20 01:02:52 UTC <icedwater> @fortelabs why would you disagree with this? It's a 101.
888188264154185728 2017-07-20 00:05:58 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @GaryKLH either a mine, or a field... I'm assuming you meant to say minefield but I'm not quite figuring why :p

888047601878130689 2017-07-20 14:47:02 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if there are tweeps enough for a laser tag game at Dhoby Ghaut MRT... @hellofrmSG could you help me signal boost please? :)
888044611674923009 2017-07-20 14:35:09 UTC <icedwater> @eisen I'd guess Ave 6 and 8 too if -if- they'd had to narrow the roads to make space for buildings. Depends on how long ago "before" was.

887894716292808704 2017-07-19 04:39:31 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @lizzlaw_ also, this happened last year. I wonder what the result of the investigation is...
887840395027111936 2017-07-19 01:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish later can. Don't worry.
887827770536935425 2017-07-19 00:13:30 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @divroyalty heh to be fair I didn't read the article; but they're a power couple only in the industry. Editor played it safe?
887823720374345729 2017-07-19 23:57:24 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname especially for an Eastern US newspaper...
887822702764998656 2017-07-19 23:53:21 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA wah. Nice to watch except for the long balls. Well, we do have talent, and youths hate to defend...

887729660020244480 2017-07-19 17:43:38 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz actually given the exchange rate... USD 450k is probably about right for 1 peanut.
887684767193288704 2017-07-19 14:45:15 UTC <icedwater> @eisen fight fire with liar :p
887683877661163522 2017-07-19 14:41:43 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith then one follow-up worth researching would be how prolific the black market is vs the legit shops.
887679286718550016 2017-07-19 14:23:28 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith I don't know enough to dispute that yet, but it feels deplorable in some sense. And how can you be sure only the sick get shot?
887673488772800512 2017-07-19 14:00:26 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith because probably the predators are also being overhunted? :P
887673185797144576 2017-07-19 13:59:14 UTC <icedwater> and you know @MarkDiStef didn't already express that elsewhere because Twitter is his only medium.
887662580117811201 2017-07-19 13:17:05 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I suppose that might be a bystander and the original person was behind the camera. @theJeremyVine

887661353095225344 2017-07-19 13:12:13 UTC <icedwater> Are you perhaps asking to be sued, then, @thewargarurumon?https://twitter.com/thewargarurumon/status/887442857887510533

887471732688273408 2017-07-18 00:38:44 UTC <icedwater> human implementation is imperfect, but blindly following either ideal is also a problem. A pragmatic middle ground is needed.
887355641349627904 2017-07-18 16:57:25 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty what really would have ruined Angle's career was that the whole Benoit thing these past ten years was a hoax he perpetrated :(

887319066171457536 2017-07-18 14:32:05 UTC <icedwater> @kennyhjh Heh, OK. I'll stop the thread at six. But those are the technical issues. I don't really like listicles, though they seem trendy.
887318483234570240 2017-07-18 14:29:46 UTC <icedwater> 6/ @kennyhjh "another faction" when talking about the Ultras Eagles implies Hools also support Geylang.
887317835092865024 2017-07-18 14:27:12 UTC <icedwater> 5/ @kennyhjh "free will" is two words.
887317713340649472 2017-07-18 14:26:43 UTC <icedwater> 4/ @kennyhjh "without first" because you're not enumerating, you're ordering.
887316891210928128 2017-07-18 14:23:27 UTC <icedwater> 3/ @kennyhjh the plural of "scarf" is "scarves".
887316716895649792 2017-07-18 14:22:45 UTC <icedwater> 2/ @kennyhjh I don't know that shenanigans is uncountable, I suppose it might be "less" or "fewer". OK, I've never seen one "shenanigan".
887316295586201600 2017-07-18 14:21:05 UTC <icedwater> 1/ @kennyhjh "gets delayed till 8.30 due to ..." is arguably a style thing. But I'd say LWS is a devil after 8.30 too.

887087260956467200 2017-07-17 23:10:58 UTC <icedwater> @RoguePOTUSStaff wait. How is Pelosi even involved in this?
887085327524941824 2017-07-17 23:03:17 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz wah. #RainforestV2
886976310504849408 2017-07-17 15:50:06 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan totally making use of the fact that people don't read articles any more.
886975968178454528 2017-07-17 15:48:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname  @pohui @joannadong @NathanHartono
886842357517131777 2017-07-16 06:57:49 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid guess who's bored :p
886822363668533248 2017-07-16 05:38:22 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid just saying. "steady steady bom pi pi" seems to be better in terms of rhythm. Clearly we aren't paying enough taxes to fund you.
886809262021726209 2017-07-16 04:46:18 UTC <icedwater> @eisen so the nasi lemak burger therapy works?!
886751296799219712 2017-07-16 00:55:58 UTC <icedwater> @hj_chen @DavidM2000AD wonder how long it would take to make a RGB palette with those colours.
886750918049280002 2017-07-16 00:54:28 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @eisen perhaps. But an identity that sacrifices all for the "pragmatic" cause is #notmyidentity
886724029255565312 2017-07-16 23:07:37 UTC <icedwater> @icc_sg @FASingapore @JunpiterFutbol I sure hope so!
886622141990313984 2017-07-16 16:22:45 UTC <icedwater> @JunpiterFutbol sorry but what's a Singapore Football Week doing around an ICC where millionaire teams are coming for vacation?
886484226832351232 2017-07-16 07:14:44 UTC <icedwater> Welcome @tbricey to @hellofrmSG and thanks to the previous curator for @anameizing week! #latetransitions
886476464501145600 2017-07-15 06:43:53 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith two wrongs don't make a right - I guess even with Twitter the principle of don't read the comments applies. Ugh, those replies.
886474865812750340 2017-07-15 06:37:32 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith I wonder whether there's a difference between minorities. Meanwhile the gap between white Trump and Hillary voters..
886467125489025025 2017-07-15 06:06:47 UTC <icedwater> @RubyNXT yup. Or we could be Tweetbots vs The World :) I was there for a small party recently, team of 6.
886385821892222976 2017-07-15 00:43:42 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ #hacked #networks allow #threats to know if #elderly are at home, before they make that home visit.. good security is needed :)
886384837803638784 2017-07-15 00:39:48 UTC <icedwater> @NarratedPOTUS @AnnotatedPOTUS they used fiverr during the campaign apparently.http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/tech-savvy-sporean-teen-played-part-trump-campaign
886376767480410112 2017-07-15 00:07:44 UTC <icedwater> @Evan_McMullin @GlennThrush that's not testing the thesis at all.
886265929687891968 2017-07-15 16:47:18 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue no, hence the word choice. I used soap and water to clean it before realising that was a bad thing to do. Now on a 4c which is OK.
886263242703618049 2017-07-15 16:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @RubyNXT cool! I wonder if we could get a tweetup going.
886261005163966464 2017-07-15 16:27:44 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue hmm. I've not used that model before. In my experience xiaomi has been short-lived but fairly robust. I drowned my Redmi Note 2.
886195122899009537 2017-07-15 12:05:56 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @abearfromSEA I suppose...
886184993990430720 2017-07-15 11:25:41 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH unless they painted the back of the net gold, I don't see how that's going to help.
886180345414000640 2017-07-15 11:07:13 UTC <icedwater> @TheRebelTV @TRobinsonNewEra @neiljhk @JohnShyguy I haven't seen anyone sharing the good that TR does. Just complaints that it's not shown.
886179043736932354 2017-07-15 11:02:03 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue what phone model is that?
886178396249534464 2017-07-15 10:59:28 UTC <icedwater> Because spending millions of dollars on cars going round a track a few times is such a commoner activity.https://twitter.com/tdysports/status/886103040478105600
886177900172460032 2017-07-15 10:57:30 UTC <icedwater> @TRobinsonNewEra this has, unfortunately, probably more to do with regional culture than religion.
886177702801166336 2017-07-15 10:56:43 UTC <icedwater> @TRobinsonNewEra Is this one of the "good things" @trobinsonnewera is doing?https://twitter.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/885949157164412928
886176914305458176 2017-07-15 10:53:35 UTC <icedwater> @TRobinsonNewEra @neiljhk @JohnShyguy why are there constant complaints about the lack of reporting, but no actual reporting?
886099814223564802 2017-07-14 05:47:13 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice in front of the stairs?
886075495778996225 2017-07-14 04:10:35 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith conduction corruption condescension concoction combobulation (only dis- exists!)
886075282276237312 2017-07-14 04:09:44 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith who are you to give orders?
886055990352687104 2017-07-14 02:53:04 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards also the queue at Buona Vista is terrible because it gets in the way of both staircases/escalators.
886054077972398081 2017-07-14 02:45:28 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter lol. Well, trains should just be doors then.
886052990137671680 2017-07-14 02:41:09 UTC <icedwater> @xychelsea 
886052063834021889 2017-07-14 02:37:28 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards the two-lane ones? I suppose. But I wonder why we're not able to see the problem and have to wait for external conditioning...
886051878261227522 2017-07-14 02:36:44 UTC <icedwater> @gazettenewsdesk @WeRWorld I'd thought about it too. Still bothers me. I guess the intrusion level of a mobile feels higher than an email.
885938905068916736 2017-07-14 19:07:49 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well... It is his Right.
885938751179849729 2017-07-14 19:07:12 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @singnoname I was outside the train. :p
885935624213020676 2017-07-14 18:54:47 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith "Trump was supposed to ________. That didn't happen" applies to any number of things, you realise.
885934448042049536 2017-07-14 18:50:06 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @singnoname nope. It was between the doors. I wasn't going to stand in front of the doors for that photo :)
885931596372627456 2017-07-14 18:38:47 UTC <icedwater> https://www.facebook.com/icedwater/posts/832861936891315:22 long post, should blog about it at some point. But right now #sgfootball takes a back seat to sleep :)
885877180839874561 2017-07-14 15:02:33 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith let me see if I can pull up something. I have been working on old assumptions too :)
885877059267973121 2017-07-14 15:02:04 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith that is a mess! But can it be solved by regional agreement? Say, a consortium (cartel?) of private providers across states...
885874399852744704 2017-07-14 14:51:30 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith must the solution be on either extreme?
885874093462966273 2017-07-14 14:50:17 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith mobile phone broadband connections are kind of like that, right? How has competition helped there...
885872593743433729 2017-07-14 14:44:19 UTC <icedwater> #bliss
885872405020778498 2017-07-14 14:43:34 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith of course it's complicated. But why not start tackling the problem instead of dancing around the fire?
885872140200714240 2017-07-14 14:42:31 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith do you have figures that indicate 20% more is necessary?
885871866849579009 2017-07-14 14:41:26 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith because private insurers have done such a great job.
885866461985558528 2017-07-14 14:19:57 UTC <icedwater> so I guess you left, right? Left right. #check1bang @hellofrmSG
885856605820002304 2017-07-14 13:40:47 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith I don't think it's a surprise. It's still something that has to be stopped is more the point I guess @KatWithSword
885847642277724160 2017-07-14 13:05:10 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG @m4riannelee agreed. But then final implementation needs to be ethically sound and legally correct. Hopefully not much is lost.
885845997225521152 2017-07-14 12:58:38 UTC <icedwater> @VfL_1899 knnen wir Trikots fr 1 kaufen bitte? :P
885843453216673792 2017-07-14 12:48:32 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG @m4riannelee but I like it.
885842910742069248 2017-07-14 12:46:22 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG @m4riannelee if it is organised by government, with top down selection, however open, then it might have the same outcome?
885807402175442944 2017-07-14 10:25:16 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay when they invent the 26-hour day, I just might :) @piawaugh @GovTechSG
885807135694573568 2017-07-14 10:24:13 UTC <icedwater> How do we solve this obstruction/dead space problem at Bishan and other MRT stations? #fbpic.twitter.com/o5HMJHvuqR
885806244178444288 2017-07-14 10:20:40 UTC <icedwater> I haven't watched @piawaugh #GovtAsAnAPI talks but I want to soon, and this might be useful for us. @GovTechSG
885805870419918848 2017-07-14 10:19:11 UTC <icedwater> Social media provides a decent channel, but open platforms are easily abused (trolls, spam) whereas exclusion preselects views @GovTechSG
885805527170596864 2017-07-14 10:17:49 UTC <icedwater> How do we get quick iterations of feedback, evaluation, reflection, and execution? How can big ideas translate to solid growth? @GovTechSG
885805086542188544 2017-07-14 10:16:04 UTC <icedwater> The trade-off is views from the ground may not be adequately informed or expressed and high-level plans don't always convert well @GovTechSG
885804371702800384 2017-07-14 10:13:14 UTC <icedwater> If it's dangerous for the average citizen to be in a bubble, more so for those in executive roles. But rank respect is strong. @GovTechSG
885803811750555648 2017-07-14 10:11:00 UTC <icedwater> It's tricky because top-down culture has worked pretty well thus far, and bottom-up is quite risky. How do we weigh both sides? @GovTechSG
885802900785569792 2017-07-14 10:07:23 UTC <icedwater> .@GovTechSG also tricky: A: "how do we shed our slow rule-bound image?" B: "dunno let us leaders have a closed door dialogue"
885802396701474816 2017-07-14 10:05:23 UTC <icedwater> @GovTechSG should it be a competition?
885771495582171136 2017-07-14 08:02:36 UTC <icedwater> @hiroosa It's a pity I won't be available for this year's HAI... Hope it goes well in the city that doesn't exist! #Bielefeld
885725203761737728 2017-07-13 04:58:39 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz it's always hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. But mocking the chaff makes it easy to mock the wheat too.
885719724025303040 2017-07-13 04:36:52 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz the only nonsense I see is misrepresentation of the comic. :p
885717945896153088 2017-07-13 04:29:48 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter fresh mcspicy will do, I think.
885701128985300992 2017-07-13 03:22:59 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith I suppose it's easy to lump the ones you don't like with the botted ones
885695479748546560 2017-07-13 03:00:32 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith lol when was this
885694955364024320 2017-07-13 02:58:27 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith you realise there is a whole world out there that doesn't coincide with trending topics in the US unless we're Trumped right?

885692401423065089 2017-07-13 02:48:18 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well it may not be racism, but it probably was due to results of experiments that didn't involve lactose-intolerant folks.
885691727582871552 2017-07-13 02:45:37 UTC <icedwater> @liangkaixin ugh
885691655671619584 2017-07-13 02:45:20 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld is that a mobile number of the reporter? I'm not sure that's a good idea, though I don't know if email is better. @gazettenewsdesk
885516415725322241 2017-07-13 15:09:00 UTC <icedwater> @eisen some trivia indeed.
885516218093916162 2017-07-13 15:08:13 UTC <icedwater> @dukope @RubyNXT 20 endings! For immigration officers?! Now I'm curious...
885515868779667457 2017-07-13 15:06:49 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @aadeshgoyal and then they culture it. #futureofpiracy
885515717910478849 2017-07-13 15:06:13 UTC <icedwater> @kixes it's actually not bad leh. Had both heated and chilled versions growing up.
885515028417265666 2017-07-13 15:03:29 UTC <icedwater> @cheeaun you mean most of the time.

885317927259389954 2017-07-12 02:00:16 UTC <icedwater> Today I remember the German word for curiosity is #Neugier - greed for new things. And boy, am I overeating.
885317214634508288 2017-07-12 01:57:27 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname why worry even if it were real? :P
885301805692854272 2017-07-12 00:56:13 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz ugh

885146414182842368 2017-07-12 14:38:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG sorry lol. Completely ignored the time difference while thinking I'd accounted for it by flipping breakfast/supper :p
885145356853325824 2017-07-12 14:34:32 UTC <icedwater> Left, right, centre: how abuse from trolls on either side works. @helenlewis shares her personal experience. https://twitter.com/helenlewis/status/885135133833121792
885143325635862528 2017-07-12 14:26:28 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG on the way, usually. What's for supper out there?
885131285227651072 2017-07-12 13:38:37 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz but pools shouldn't be the main sponsors.
885087712822341636 2017-07-12 10:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith so if you use them enough and fold them the right way first, they're good...
885086604687269888 2017-07-12 10:41:05 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith well, deficit can go up and down. But what was the money used to accomplish?
885071975709847554 2017-07-12 09:42:57 UTC <icedwater> @Steelinho @FASingapore @yazbanz change will not come within a term. Small improvements yes. But the effects of real change take longer.
885057963630747649 2017-07-12 08:47:16 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz what to do. Can petition @FASingapore meh? @Steelinho
885052033321054211 2017-07-12 08:23:42 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @Steelinho yeah. The FTS was just a few buckets pouring out water, but the problems were there all along...

885020835802730496 2017-07-11 06:19:44 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @patcondell it's a bit on the lengthy side but it certainly didn't deserve that remark. I'd have just gone with others earlier.
885016464562024450 2017-07-11 06:02:22 UTC <icedwater> @RazifAriff @Fadzli13 2 briyani before each match :p
885016330373656576 2017-07-11 06:01:50 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @ileksua ActiveSG, apparently.
885016165709381632 2017-07-11 06:01:11 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith lol whaaaaaat
884989240047792128 2017-07-11 04:14:11 UTC <icedwater> @RazifAriff what level is this, by the way?
884989032282951680 2017-07-11 04:13:22 UTC <icedwater> @gaqzi oh is it election season already?
884988561602351104 2017-07-11 04:11:30 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith to be fair, you probably wouldn't have been deployed to where it was peaceful, right?
884988381545025536 2017-07-11 04:10:47 UTC <icedwater> @suzukeith it's pretty complex, indeed. Also definitely a personal decision. Both images should be fact-checked though, I agree.

880311375238541313 2017-06-28 06:26:01 UTC <icedwater> @hyperren nonscientific translation of kmeans - you define k, and see if you can divide all the things into those k groups, right? #rusty
880295311645605888 2017-06-28 05:22:12 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG let's see if we can coordinate pair or trio curation, or look for org accounts as curators :)
880234614412922881 2017-06-28 01:21:00 UTC <icedwater> @eisen I wonder how much it has changed 99 years on..
880230116697055232 2017-06-28 01:03:08 UTC <icedwater> @hyperren it definitely helps in some ways.
880218281105211392 2017-06-28 00:16:06 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname don't worry. No hurry. You know I'll probably wind up reading it 3 days after the fact, as usual... @RedDot_Oz @AudiKhalid
880096500562317312 2017-06-28 16:12:11 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom even worse than a Liverpool fan. @neiljhk
880096270131396609 2017-06-28 16:11:16 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk odd - would Labour view homes as assets for investment and not objects fulfilling a basic human need?
880095650032918529 2017-06-28 16:08:49 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz slowly trying to build. Everyone is inspired by the @HougangHOOLs efforts. Good to see more popping up.
879981189108449280 2017-06-28 08:33:59 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger racism is something nobody plays with. I'm glad you don't either. Benefit of the doubt is a rare commodity, not mine to give.
879978811307114497 2017-06-28 08:24:32 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger nope :) I knew it was a possibility, so I had to rule it out. You did mention it first, so I asked why. :)
879975644724985856 2017-06-28 08:11:57 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger ...And also my answer, is why did jail come as the first response, because he's a black man?
879975331892912128 2017-06-28 08:10:42 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger no you haven't. I've accepted the premise that someone who's never seen a cell phone before would be curious. My question...
879937302021132288 2017-06-27 05:39:35 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger I wonder what caused you to lead with "just got out of jail" as a reason why he hadn't seen a cell phone in years?
879933730759913472 2017-06-27 05:25:24 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger same here. :)
879924691275726848 2017-06-27 04:49:29 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez nope. When I get it I pass you all.
879921262788661249 2017-06-27 04:35:51 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez I dunno, mebbe...
879918706721038337 2017-06-27 04:25:42 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold some kind of protest move, I suppose...
879918224485171200 2017-06-27 04:23:47 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez it's a sign you need a good ad blocker.
879918149361049600 2017-06-27 04:23:29 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname hmm. Elaborate. @RedDot_Oz @AudiKhalid
879915008833998848 2017-06-27 04:11:00 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger if you don't want to answer my question, why should I bother with yours?
879856667483029504 2017-06-27 00:19:11 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi oh right. Lol. I scrolled past "last year" #readfail
879856395058675712 2017-06-27 00:18:06 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi "...she intends to hold her *second daughter's first-year birthday party next month*..." How does that work? Adoption or #biofreak
879854820139479041 2017-06-27 00:11:50 UTC <icedwater> @SwiftOnSecurity Good read from @negrosubversive on healthcare and rights. Thanks @sonictempest @swiftonsecurity for the RTs.https://twitter.com/negrosubversive/status/878682332030488577
879851172793794561 2017-06-27 23:57:21 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger why not? We should always have our assumptions questioned. It's like a trip to the dentist. :P
879666586751188992 2017-06-27 11:43:52 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk definitely there are some who'd love to make this not so... @LabModeration @Nicthegreek1979 @TheWelshPatriot @danidotx

879609491565690880 2017-06-27 07:56:59 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger I questioned your assumption about jail being the reason he'd never seen a cell phone before, is all.
879576583605899264 2017-06-26 05:46:13 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger then you didn't have to include the first clause, "just got out of jail", and you meant "alluding".
879552946786025472 2017-06-26 04:12:18 UTC <icedwater> @heysayfey @keeweeeee @hai_ren @lackadaisygirl Who needs that when we can save even more money by doing it on Twitter?
879550218080931840 2017-06-26 04:01:27 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @singh_a84 What's the context for this rally, though?
879549631239036929 2017-06-26 03:59:07 UTC <icedwater> @MonicaRanger What do I mean? Where did the jail idea come from?

879486028926418944 2017-06-26 23:46:24 UTC <icedwater> Bit of a wild charge... I wonder about its veracity.https://twitter.com/TRobinsonNewEra/status/878510007716782080

875394306856570880 2017-06-15 16:47:21 UTC <icedwater> @Myhiddenmadness I would assert that you do, though. I think artistic license does allow adapting such plays to current characters.
875342713859719168 2017-06-15 13:22:20 UTC <icedwater> @Myhiddenmadness it was done with the likenesses of several other Presidents. Did you also question it then?
875337272421306369 2017-06-15 13:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @Myhiddenmadness the play wasn't in Latin. Knowledge of Latin isn't needed, nor was interpretation or license. Have fun.
875334979584106496 2017-06-15 12:51:36 UTC <icedwater> @Myhiddenmadness fair enough. Good thing they didn't dignify your response then.

875302488752087041 2017-06-15 10:42:30 UTC <icedwater> @Myhiddenmadness there's reading and then there's reading. I don't think the play was in Latin either. Read it again.
875301937939271680 2017-06-15 10:40:18 UTC <icedwater> @Baranosky it's possible to learn to "code" in under an hour, but a CS degree is so much more. We should be clear about that @garybernhardt
875244941487644672 2017-06-14 06:53:49 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl it's complicated...
875244283418206208 2017-06-14 06:51:13 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews no, what's not? Raids against Al-Qaeda and ISIS? And targeting vetted refugees is a waste of energy. @neiljhk @ABC
875227398890897409 2017-06-14 05:44:07 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews as it's probably already being done, I suppose so. But I don't think that's the only way. @neiljhk @ABC
875214954202243072 2017-06-14 04:54:40 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews stop them from corrupting the youth and keep them outside your borders? @neiljhk @ABC
875213227239415809 2017-06-14 04:47:48 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews heh. Again, as you said, it's irrelevant to their motives, so it shouldn't matter whether it works or not @neiljhk @ABC
875210070560088065 2017-06-14 04:35:16 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews well... then we don't totally agree. Killing terrorists has been done so many times. That just makes more. @neiljhk @ABC
875208221299953664 2017-06-14 04:27:55 UTC <icedwater> @ginger6516 oh so trade with country X means you get to control them? Sure.
875207980198772736 2017-06-14 04:26:57 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews that's odd, that's how I read your argument. So maybe we do agree after all. @neiljhk @ABC
875205388387233792 2017-06-14 04:16:39 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews of course. That's just fact-checking. @neiljhk @ABC
875193362457870337 2017-06-14 03:28:52 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews also let's see how many terror attacks happened in tolerant, diverse places vs their opposites. @neiljhk @ABC
875192908441198593 2017-06-14 03:27:04 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews which points to other methods to stop terrorism. @neiljhk @ABC
875190897931018242 2017-06-14 03:19:04 UTC <icedwater> @ginger6516 of course you read it that way :) what "path" has Germany and France gone down that the UK should avoid? Strength and stability?
875190703705300992 2017-06-14 03:18:18 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews Since they are irrelevant, nothing's stopping us from being tolerant and diverse, right? @neiljhk @ABC
875164707144876032 2017-06-14 01:35:00 UTC <icedwater> Lol. https://twitter.com/ginger6516/status/873749600426917888
875164632586928128 2017-06-14 01:34:42 UTC <icedwater> @ResistFakeNews so ISIS is just the latest excuse for intolerance or resisting diversity, I suppose? ;) @neiljhk @ABC
875164400692285440 2017-06-14 01:33:47 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Tombx7M so now that Comey has managed to get DJT into office he should be discarded like the tool he is? :)

872981075256983552 2017-06-08 00:58:02 UTC <icedwater> @alvations to be fair though, it was woebot vs ebook - I know I'd prefer interaction any time.
872980587346141185 2017-06-08 00:56:05 UTC <icedwater> @yoavgo somehow I am doubtful that this can't be applied to other cases of depression..
872795088568504322 2017-06-08 12:38:59 UTC <icedwater> @verkur but if it leads to the kind of response like in the iPhone 7 case it's worth it ;)

872500154800025602 2017-06-07 17:07:01 UTC <icedwater> @Stephanenny On the new Irish PM. @stephanenny points out some important facts.lhttps://twitter.com/Stephanenny/status/870698686547767296
872497231655452672 2017-06-07 16:55:24 UTC <icedwater> @Calvinn_Hobbes @CaptHat211 you're right about this though, zoos do do some good. But it's far from enough. It's not even the bear minimum.
872497095604875270 2017-06-07 16:54:52 UTC <icedwater> @Calvinn_Hobbes @CaptHat211 those are only some problems. There's pollution and overpopulation as well, if not others.

870326468907155456 2017-06-01 17:09:34 UTC <icedwater> @xspeak4me meh, I think SJWs are all right. Bit strident sometimes, but mostly good intentions. @kosherjellyfish @shoe0nhead @ChrisRGun
870316273002979330 2017-06-01 16:29:03 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch fair enough. I was thinking about Beijing alone, just a direct verification of that statement.
870314638512013312 2017-06-01 16:22:34 UTC <icedwater> I'm not sure about the Han subgroup in what we consider ethnic Chinese today... Any stats?https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/869649120805306369

870253616359129088 2017-06-01 12:20:05 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG also, when one person criticizes the bazaar, their whole ethnic group doesn't need to be held responsible :)
870095420797591552 2017-05-31 01:51:28 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi yup. Cause and effect. Thanks for the info.
870086476582670336 2017-05-31 01:15:56 UTC <icedwater> Rant from @spacetwinks about safe spaces and comedy. Thanks for the thread.https://twitter.com/spacetwinks/status/869135830014734336
869987298347069440 2017-05-31 18:41:50 UTC <icedwater> Also unacceptable since you're paying for a "discount" and you won't know what you're getting, eh @hellofrmSG?https://twitter.com/jimpjorps/status/869318583074963457
869986653938491392 2017-05-31 18:39:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG don't apologise. Variety is good and topics that matter make for more compelling tweeting.
869986297376497665 2017-05-31 18:37:51 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG and may this be a small step towards a healthy distrust of certification throughout Singaporean culture :)
869977203907284992 2017-05-31 18:01:43 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @bangorballetboy a suggestion that an ability to do research is impractical?

869969741988806657 2017-05-31 17:32:04 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hmm. Doesn't expressed milk count too though?
869949167065473024 2017-05-31 16:10:18 UTC <icedwater> .@RabonaMike it's worse to know that Warriors are ahead of the rest of the #sleague table and close to the teams playing actual football.
869945791472779264 2017-05-31 15:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @psy_lsh yes, though you have to cross the line or see it being crossed to know that it's there to begin with.
869942701470261248 2017-05-31 15:44:37 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish well, the state of knowledge has changed since then, I guess, as it tends to.
869836761840496644 2017-05-31 08:43:39 UTC <icedwater> @driftsojourn that's my religion. Netflix and chilies.
869787949709262848 2017-05-30 05:29:41 UTC <icedwater> .@hellofrmSG I suppose in that case it would be forbidden to buy the Entertainer, since you make a one-time payment for an unknown discount?

869552120491417602 2017-05-30 13:52:35 UTC <icedwater> @shadybrowngirl I wonder if this could get crowdfunded. I'd try to watch this at the projector :) @kosherjellyfish
869547054929895424 2017-05-30 13:32:27 UTC <icedwater> @FirstKnivesClub wow. That sucks. What can you do against it though?

867024717747675136 2017-05-23 14:29:35 UTC <icedwater> [CW] A thread filled with death, despair, and the DWP. @arjan____ wants you to help fix this problem at its root.https://twitter.com/arjan____/status/866419001500602369
867021347100123136 2017-05-23 14:16:12 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @STsportsdesk makes me wonder what happened in 09 and 13.

866967734520696832 2017-05-23 10:43:10 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter there are those on the island who would ridicule the call for love and unity, though.
866967232265412608 2017-05-23 10:41:10 UTC <icedwater> @PublicLibrarySG eclectic, apparently.
866965306001965057 2017-05-23 10:33:31 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay I hope it uses a good sanitizer.
866885445971353600 2017-05-22 05:16:10 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi I'll write some markdown in a git repo so you can see the diffs and you won't have to take my word for where the changes are :p
866863114825773056 2017-05-22 03:47:26 UTC <icedwater> @serenelooys it's called social media working as intended.
866862974585024513 2017-05-22 03:46:53 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi if I knew I'd tell you. Maybe you should start writing articles in GitHub :p
866861789283090432 2017-05-22 03:42:10 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @m8urnett for uncovering some weird stuff going on in Windows 10. Verification welcome.https://twitter.com/m8urnett/status/866360774263844864

866845191168184320 2017-05-22 02:36:13 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet how much of Twitter can effectively stop terror attacks? And how many are able to stop the spread of Islamophobia?
866831861456044033 2017-05-22 01:43:15 UTC <icedwater> @danidictates wow, is there a basis for this attack?

866813524088995841 2017-05-22 00:30:23 UTC <icedwater> @diandujour I agree, but we won't know how she's processing it either. I suppose it's more about how she reads and questions she asks?
866812398987902978 2017-05-22 00:25:55 UTC <icedwater> @diandujour sometimes these do go hand in hand though. Reading can help to feed the curiosity and nurture it.

866691635433754624 2017-05-22 16:26:02 UTC <icedwater> @MobikeSG @yazbanz fair. But @eisen, I think @OBikeInc and @MobikeSg are different companies right :p
866665306655256576 2017-05-22 14:41:25 UTC <icedwater> @MobikeSG @eisen does @OBikeInc have designated stops? I've just been leaving them near bus stops since that's where I usually find them. @MobikeSg
866664659675258880 2017-05-22 14:38:51 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG we should go to Annalakshmi near Clarke Quay sometime. 
866650659818541060 2017-05-22 13:43:13 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake so it's @omgitsjn, @whyvo, @psy_lsh, @ClandestineYeo, @bruce_boner, @bargeboards, and me?
866632904608145409 2017-05-22 12:32:40 UTC <icedwater> @KopTalk28 @marktudball obviously they didn't want to do their jobs either.

866346086293688321 2017-05-21 17:32:57 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard again, neither the Saudi state department nor the US one was really the focus here...

866295820114575360 2017-05-21 14:13:13 UTC <icedwater> @miraxpath most notorious book of the 20th c. is "The Art of the Deal", now :p But seriously, it's sad that MK is popular with non-Aryans.

866292260744216577 2017-05-21 13:59:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @AlexGavriel_ in that sense it's OK, of course. That's what I meant by donations.
866288350533042176 2017-05-21 13:43:32 UTC <icedwater> @aral if only we could build an AI that is running on your own computer.
866288034072870912 2017-05-21 13:42:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @AlexGavriel_ should a party's funds come from the members of the government, though? I'm okay with *donations*, but...

866216510716469249 2017-05-21 08:58:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @omgitsjn @shimmertje8 aspire what. Lucky I was born in the right family and got support all the way. Trying to give back lor.
866213351008763904 2017-05-21 08:45:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @omgitsjn hallo. Elite means what. Can eat or not.
866185740408848385 2017-05-20 06:55:48 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren sure, I agree. But why is your example from the US? We have had a chewing gum restriction here and it worked fine.
866184311564664833 2017-05-20 06:50:07 UTC <icedwater> need an ear?
866183980646780929 2017-05-20 06:48:48 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity go ahead lol @hellofrmSG
866167629983039488 2017-05-20 05:43:50 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren that's a lot more radical than what would pass here. Good start. But how would you handle the consequences of imported drugs?
866162799977746432 2017-05-20 05:24:38 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @kosherjellyfish @psy_lsh old habits die hard, too.

866137039418163201 2017-05-20 03:42:16 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake thanks for the legwork! Let's win this. I think @omgitsjn is in. @whyvo @ClandestineYeo @bruce_boner @bargeboards @psy_lsh
866136367402635264 2017-05-20 03:39:36 UTC <icedwater> Nice article @STcom. Thanks for RT @betelbox. @leehsienloong sir, I disagree with 1965 as the start point. Our history is longer than that.
866133589053669377 2017-05-20 03:28:34 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG none same.  Catholic High (Pre-Primary to P3) ACS Barker (GEP, P4 to P6) RI RJ NUS (BEng) Uni Osnabrck (MSc) ...Still planning.
866128828543811584 2017-05-20 03:09:39 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname only if you don't consider vertices as valid contacts... heh @omgitsjn
866126342751899649 2017-05-20 02:59:46 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard sure, and he will be accommodated. But I think the focus was on Mr. Trump's personal habits though.
866125822536499202 2017-05-20 02:57:42 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai make time. It shall be done. Just have faith and plan something.
866125686871736321 2017-05-20 02:57:10 UTC <icedwater> @dav_hamill yup that's what we all think, and I kinda believe it, but we should have a way to verify that. Packet sniffers, or something.
865980427521073152 2017-05-20 17:19:57 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren agreed in that sense, but is the death penalty necessary?
865980135878438912 2017-05-20 17:18:48 UTC <icedwater> Thank you @judacris for your turn as @hellofrmSG, welcome @orbigood :)

865963155792347136 2017-05-20 16:11:19 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PrisonPlanet ha.
865961779762831360 2017-05-20 16:05:51 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz upgrades often overwrite the original software, I think.
865960333579395072 2017-05-20 16:00:06 UTC <icedwater> @aral don't give them ideas :p
865959496849412096 2017-05-20 15:56:47 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 of course not. He can't pass something that doesn't exist. @mdnoorhadi @dfordeeps @afa
865959184331714561 2017-05-20 15:55:32 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart hasn't happened yet, but they asked what it meant :p @ladystormhold
865958655342006273 2017-05-20 15:53:26 UTC <icedwater> @tocsg need help proofreading? "local non-government" and "does not distinguishes", among others...
865956070467837952 2017-05-20 15:43:10 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold it's probably for safety, to avoid trouble from whatever rabid home support there might be. Watching Palace? It's yellow.
865955378978185217 2017-05-20 15:40:25 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold I had to explain this to a few guests for my wedding lol.
865954050277203968 2017-05-20 15:35:08 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn yeah. Hope Honey Creme prepared for the drought...
865953730142781440 2017-05-20 15:33:52 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity (o,0)
865953183134212096 2017-05-20 15:31:42 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard besides, she only features in one paragraph of that article which mentions Mr. Trump's reluctance to visit her home country.
865952783710642178 2017-05-20 15:30:06 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard maybe I wasn't clear. I was referring to the steak that Mr. Trump has to have. Mrs. Trump was never the topic.
865939177359024128 2017-05-20 14:36:02 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard no, they're not expected to. But they have to accept weird looks and mockery for it. Same here for Trump.
865903255800356864 2017-05-20 12:13:18 UTC <icedwater> @godwizard that doesn't have anything to do with willingness or ability to travel.
865881629952065536 2017-05-20 10:47:22 UTC <icedwater> @mariatta hope you can inspire more ladies to join Python core team, or if not, just use Python in general :)
865875815950503937 2017-05-20 10:24:16 UTC <icedwater> @dav_hamill to be fair, to fit on the device, the wake word recogniser treats all non-wake words as garbage. Audio can be deleted, I guess.
865874514839691264 2017-05-20 10:19:06 UTC <icedwater> @dav_hamill oh, that's interesting. Is there evidence for that? I wonder if Google Home does that too, then.
865865830088622080 2017-05-20 09:44:35 UTC <icedwater> @dav_hamill yes, but I'm referring to the recorded sound that isn't wake words. Is that ever sent to Google? @zachleat @codepo8 @Android
865764801774968833 2017-05-19 03:03:08 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn thanks for the translation! @play_nate thanks for sharing! I got the gist from Mandarin, just wondering about certain phrases :)
865757952774295552 2017-05-19 02:35:55 UTC <icedwater> nope @WWEAsuka @RubyRiotWWE @NikkiCrossWWE
865756444888514560 2017-05-19 02:29:56 UTC <icedwater> @RVAwonk I'd normally agree, but he seems to have demonstrated his immunity to common sense... Keeping my fingers crossed, though!
865746300603465728 2017-05-19 01:49:37 UTC <icedwater> @Andy9375 you're absolutely right. Come back when you are making some sort of sense outside your own mind.
865746051147350016 2017-05-19 01:48:38 UTC <icedwater> @Andy9375 you're reading whatever you want into anything I say, so there's no point talking with you :)
865716086016049152 2017-05-19 23:49:33 UTC <icedwater> @Andy9375 ridiculous response. And I haven't even read @samswey's thread.
865715353053151232 2017-05-19 23:46:39 UTC <icedwater> I do fairly often, and when I forget I check `dirs`. Thanks for the question @climagic, the replies are interesting.https://twitter.com/climagic/status/865634798353526785

865709654931759104 2017-05-19 23:24:00 UTC <icedwater> @dav_hamill still need to be sure if, then where and how, the data is stored. @zachleat @codepo8 @Android
865608544917233664 2017-05-19 16:42:13 UTC <icedwater> who did this research? I don't have the bandwidth now to follow up, but I'd bookmark it for future reference.
865597379877027840 2017-05-19 15:57:52 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if there were a way to move beyond "I suspect", though.
865591186483945472 2017-05-19 15:33:15 UTC <icedwater> valid point. Is there any place where whites are a minority? However, why should opinion differ so strongly by race?
865588686691237888 2017-05-19 15:23:19 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @abearfromSEA got meh. I only remember Penny Black during the Euros because it burned down after that. #stopthebear

865377184545775621 2017-05-18 01:22:53 UTC <icedwater> @aral it does look better at least. I'm still not keen on Apple's walled garden despite the competitive advantage. Probably because of cost.

865242887511883776 2017-05-18 16:29:14 UTC <icedwater> @eisen well. Some people are just cheap :p
865242316868427776 2017-05-18 16:26:58 UTC <icedwater> @Farnaby but only on Twitter, because that would have real life consequences otherwise, and we can't deal with those now, can we. @WeRWorld

865189549445586944 2017-05-18 12:57:17 UTC <icedwater> @eisen I'm surprised "election coming" was only the second best comment on that article. We're becoming more idealistic maybe? #notabadthing

865185152623755265 2017-05-18 12:39:49 UTC <icedwater> @Watdahel_Marcel question their attitude maybe, but they made a mistake here. Doesn't invalidate the good they did elsewhere. @Seb_Castro
865168066564337664 2017-05-18 11:31:55 UTC <icedwater> @avalon great!
865159244558942209 2017-05-18 10:56:52 UTC <icedwater> @avalon was it tasty?
865158455652368390 2017-05-18 10:53:44 UTC <icedwater> @andyysplash they have a phobia - a fear of something right. @Solid_ShepardN7 @0kbps @tonitonirocca
865157257922621441 2017-05-18 10:48:58 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv actually given this lens it would be interesting to read "art of the deal".

865070962462515202 2017-05-17 05:06:04 UTC <icedwater> @econundertow wonder where the ants came from though... @_danilo @ananelson
865064013872287745 2017-05-17 04:38:27 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya unfortunately the plumbing was oversold, and lots of his byproduct is floating around.
865021566798581760 2017-05-17 01:49:47 UTC <icedwater> ugh. Thanks for the reference, at least.
865006599802204161 2017-05-17 00:50:19 UTC <icedwater> are sample sizes of each sector the same between 87 and 07, though? And how many families remained in the same sector? @omgitsjn
865005747309912064 2017-05-17 00:46:55 UTC <icedwater> I would guess it applies here too, explaining the success of the tuition industry. But how far to stream, if we do? @omgitsjn
865004899657949184 2017-05-17 00:43:33 UTC <icedwater> @tjhorner good to know that the @telegram VoIP library is OSS. When the whole application is, we'll know how exactly the library is used.
865003094261747713 2017-05-17 00:36:23 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish that nobody can deny. But I feel a bit sad that my initial reaction stopped there.

864903383718572032 2017-05-17 18:00:10 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice I can think of any number of responses, doesn't matter; if it happened I would probably just have walked away regardless.
864902225339891712 2017-05-17 17:55:34 UTC <icedwater> @AdaApaDgnCikTeh side question, I thought it was supposed to be the same God?

864900754284335104 2017-05-17 17:49:43 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv what are those things? I vaguely recall seeing mason jars and of course done some cafe hopping but <_< millennial pink is new >_>

864895001783750656 2017-05-17 17:26:52 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn good. That's what I want to hear. The next question is, how many people do you think think like you?
864894559410454528 2017-05-17 17:25:06 UTC <icedwater> I grew up with several Filipina live-in domestic helpers too, and I hope they were decently paid. If I ever hire one, she will be.

864881444623007744 2017-05-17 16:32:59 UTC <icedwater> @shhai @ofmeowandbake @mintea but to be clear, A*STAR has many institutes doing science and engineering research in different fields.

864873969580556288 2017-05-17 16:03:17 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @SubMedina on the other hand, if you ever can't find a job, you can probably make one up. Like, say, YouTube influencers.

864479188249591808 2017-05-16 13:54:34 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo YOU NEED A WEBSITE
864478912692105217 2017-05-16 13:53:28 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA no idea...
864473881712640000 2017-05-16 13:33:29 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I don't think so. What the hell would I do with so many camels?! @ofmeowandbake @frhn
864436559923118080 2017-05-16 11:05:10 UTC <icedwater> @khalidkarim except that outside centre is a bit misleading... There aren't really any apartments in the centre of Singapore.
864287198316601344 2017-05-15 01:11:40 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld magandang umaga! That's in Tagalog, right? Do you know it in other regional or local languages too? :)
864195991838146560 2017-05-15 19:09:15 UTC <icedwater> @WWEAsuka @Shinmaru is first and second, who's third?
864106547948929025 2017-05-15 13:13:50 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi #thingstosayafteryouleave
864025695462211584 2017-05-15 07:52:33 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv who needs that many followers when you have a 1/12 chance of being betrayed by them?
864023903877832704 2017-05-15 07:45:26 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren no idea lol I never approached any such person.
864010096610754560 2017-05-14 06:50:34 UTC <icedwater> Beware folks. Got messaged out of the blue. I don't think I'm the first but let me be one of the last. #fbpic.twitter.com/rkUov6gpIG
863710497341816832 2017-05-14 11:00:04 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo we might get some points with this ;)
863639806026276864 2017-05-13 06:19:10 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon lol! When I met my girlfriend we were 57-59. Now I have the lead at 58-54 :p @ofmeowandbake @frhn
863581607839399936 2017-05-13 02:27:54 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @lenagoh I see. Well it may work with startups, but governments have to deal with long-term projects that may "fail" at first.
863452100922966016 2017-05-13 17:53:17 UTC <icedwater> @GreenSkyOverMe I suppose it was invented to represent the nausea of the G20 delegates at having to deal with Ivanka.
863451044189163520 2017-05-13 17:49:05 UTC <icedwater> @internetofshit @aikii I dunno. I work at a place that develops similar tech, I have to figure out how to stay sane...
863446616908234752 2017-05-13 17:31:30 UTC <icedwater> @lenagoh hmm, is it really a startup-like approach, though? @harishpillay
863446202389454848 2017-05-13 17:29:51 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake let's try this at Stuttgart S-Cafe. I heard the waiter say something similar but it didn't register till now. @ladystormhold
863444318266064900 2017-05-13 17:22:22 UTC <icedwater> @girlswithtoys @jackdouglass127 yeah, I mentally replaced "based on" with "because" and couldn't be arsed to fix that.
863443354666754048 2017-05-13 17:18:32 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold gotta read that again.
863442894832582656 2017-05-13 17:16:42 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold Wild Swans is the Jung Chang one is it? Sounds familiar..
863441767688884224 2017-05-13 17:12:14 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter Craig Shakespeare?
863441357292978176 2017-05-13 17:10:36 UTC <icedwater> LOL https://twitter.com/CelebrateTheWin/status/863428301762834432
863441319993032704 2017-05-13 17:10:27 UTC <icedwater> LOLhttps://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/862510004242268160
863440952601346048 2017-05-13 17:08:59 UTC <icedwater> @jackdouglass127 are you sure that second clause is the reason why black people make "racist" comments? @girlswithtoys
863440498886705152 2017-05-13 17:07:11 UTC <icedwater> @GreenSkyOverMe ah, thanks for explaining the G in the middle. Ich glaube es ist das Gefhl von der Delegierung wegen der Ex...tochter?
863433753112137728 2017-05-13 16:40:23 UTC <icedwater> @STopinion no way. Let the children pursue it on their own at their own pace.
863071318924591104 2017-05-12 16:40:12 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @ND_nanodesu core strength and thighs are impressive.
863069379268714496 2017-05-12 16:32:29 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue hmm... Does that work? You've still earned that cash though. Isn't that already taxable?
862989059123159040 2017-05-12 11:13:19 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @yazbanz is this the 3-6 #kenekicap kit? #SaintsOverDevils
862983668410621953 2017-05-12 10:51:54 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue nice. Do it while you have liquid assets :)
862840512662822916 2017-05-11 01:23:03 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake OK can, count me in! @omgitsjn @psy_lsh @bruce_boner @bargeboards
862742293484232704 2017-05-11 18:52:46 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz "Islamist" countries? As opposed to "Muslim" ones...?
862634437774684161 2017-05-11 11:44:11 UTC <icedwater> @lonelytiefling I literally followed you just because of your username! Tieflings are *excellent*.
862631104817143808 2017-05-11 11:30:56 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @JosephScrimshaw I wonder why "no evidence" is in scare quotes ;)
862536395734134784 2017-05-10 05:14:36 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz yes.
862506857360900096 2017-05-10 03:17:14 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @kwilli1046 guess which correlation is spurious?
862506215779090432 2017-05-10 03:14:41 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld probably the second time this tweet was stolen and outdid the original :p
862353137180356608 2017-05-10 17:06:24 UTC <icedwater> well then. Get better ;)
862351114070409220 2017-05-10 16:58:21 UTC <icedwater> @TenaciousTubbs apparently alt-right has just become clickbait. @jesslynnrose @katebevan
862350908084047873 2017-05-10 16:57:32 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose indeed. Also, even if you buy that excuse, where is the alt-right influence in the case?
862349953800077312 2017-05-10 16:53:45 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA when they turn 23 and are no longer young, they would be...  SEA Lions.
862348273914306560 2017-05-10 16:47:04 UTC <icedwater> @kolatubosun if I explain something to you and it gets leaked to the media, should the blame be on you or me? #facepalm
862294736924585985 2017-05-10 13:14:20 UTC <icedwater> I spend far too long looking at code instead of making it work. I don't dare call myself a dev. :P
862284278586949638 2017-05-10 12:32:47 UTC <icedwater> sure, but look at where you put "because".
862284115264983040 2017-05-10 12:32:08 UTC <icedwater> that's because nothing formal has actually taken place yet.
862283981537943552 2017-05-10 12:31:36 UTC <icedwater> well if you weren't trolling, there was no other reason for tagging them in every reply.
862212082011222017 2017-05-10 07:45:54 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm not sure the thumbs are the only parts of the hand that move there... ;)
862211385303777281 2017-05-10 07:43:08 UTC <icedwater> does your trolling get through to @/Google?
862211039458230272 2017-05-10 07:41:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG good enough for me!
862210937591222273 2017-05-10 07:41:21 UTC <icedwater> not sure what Farage is supposed to have won that Le Pen and Wilders lost...
862210846784577536 2017-05-10 07:40:59 UTC <icedwater> @Nakidape wait, Farage won what?
862210479040544768 2017-05-10 07:39:31 UTC <icedwater> they're not saying it's standard because few people fit it. Come on.
862195110435356672 2017-05-09 06:38:27 UTC <icedwater> Btw @PM_Haze @HacksHackersSG we need to make sure data is trustworthy ;)https://twitter.com/thebeijinger/status/861470805733068800
862193324366508032 2017-05-09 06:31:21 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter interesting to see if this will have any implications on FAS funding for the next 4 years. :)
862038282405675008 2017-05-09 20:15:17 UTC <icedwater> @drdelusional I believe that's how it should be translated, yes. As opposed to "ich bin langweilig" which is "I am boring."
862031087945474048 2017-05-09 19:46:41 UTC <icedwater> @lonelytiefling actually they would probably just be ... in sync. OK, I'll show myself out now...Bye.
862023935679844352 2017-05-09 19:18:16 UTC <icedwater> @MakdaGCBC @harishpillay congratulations to her. Now if I could only spell her name and hometown without autocorrect...
862002330501226497 2017-05-09 17:52:25 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish they should just set aside 10m zones in any reconstruction area before the demolition takes place. Let us pay to work ;)
861989995933868032 2017-05-09 17:03:24 UTC <icedwater> @drdelusional that would be you talking about your personality, not your situation. You're not the subject.
861986322109550592 2017-05-09 16:48:48 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjn fair enough, and I liked @infernoxv's point before, but it's unfortunate we took this off the China edition and not the US one.
861924570994950145 2017-05-09 12:43:26 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog @yokey017 eh don't bring my future home into it. :P
861924448877780992 2017-05-09 12:42:57 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake yeah busy but tempted lol @psy_lsh @ClandestineYeo
861916175466233856 2017-05-09 12:10:04 UTC <icedwater> @jayhalia one more reason to watch it... As if I needed anything but time to do so :p
861915214874263552 2017-05-09 12:06:15 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog #cynic :p
861913880246632448 2017-05-09 12:00:57 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo I agree on both counts, though I'm pretty sure any higher power shouldn't be offended by what you're wearing or not wearing.
861912656160018432 2017-05-09 11:56:05 UTC <icedwater> I'm going to the picnic, and I'm bringing my family to join the escape game tonight at Bugis Junction firsthttps://twitter.com/WrrrdNrrrdGrrrl/status/861032079907315713
861912239657197569 2017-05-09 11:54:26 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake thanks. Erm count me in. Will update when venue is comnfirmed. @psy_lsh @ClandestineYeo
861910775018823680 2017-05-09 11:48:36 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo but isn't the "place of worship" argument just a bullshit cover for the "weak men" reason?
861830507075559424 2017-05-08 06:29:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG on a more serious note, yeah. I wonder if they can break this down and prevent further exploitation.
861830373361065985 2017-05-08 06:29:07 UTC <icedwater> @jerricklim I suppose this is Yishun passing the torch to Sengkang ;)
861783883557158912 2017-05-08 03:24:23 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo @yazbanz found and fixed. http://enwp.org/Selangor_FA#Rivalries clean and impartial, I hope? :P
861773960232304641 2017-05-08 02:44:57 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo @yazbanz Wikipedia edits are serious business. Many students and reporters depend on it :)
861749610892677121 2017-05-08 01:08:12 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo have you fixed it? If not, I will. :P
861746334109270016 2017-05-08 00:55:11 UTC <icedwater> @yinkanubi irrelevant. One gender could walk around nude in public and stay safe. Another walks around fully clothed but still gets raped.
861743433051811841 2017-05-08 00:43:39 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM I'm responding to this 3 days late. Sorry for encouraging @Twitter :p
861627414966697985 2017-05-08 17:02:38 UTC <icedwater> @IntEdToday @kolatubosun yes, I wonder if the transition generation gritted their teeth through ineffective teaching for our sake.
861612263999815681 2017-05-08 16:02:26 UTC <icedwater> @DaveHong7 Could you re-read your first response to @TODAYonline's and tell me what it says?
861609062038781952 2017-05-08 15:49:42 UTC <icedwater> @DaveHong7 so bicycle riders should ride through crossings, is what I am reading... @TODAYonline
861607915924242432 2017-05-08 15:45:09 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname ofo courso noto
861606835358322689 2017-05-08 15:40:52 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname how much for the banner?
861606748095881216 2017-05-08 15:40:31 UTC <icedwater> @kolatubosun @IntEdToday interesting, I wonder if Singapore's case agrees with this evidence. Maybe we forced English into a mother tongue?
861578398144937984 2017-05-08 13:47:52 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz all the same, what difference does it make if it's posthumously awarded? He won't have any use for it.
861510669895581696 2017-05-08 09:18:44 UTC <icedwater> @PeoplesPowerSG I'd like to hear Mr Goh's response to these thoughts. Surely he's not forwarding them without comment.
861252090181566464 2017-05-07 16:11:14 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @elonmusk Bore-at.
861251880537645056 2017-05-07 16:10:24 UTC <icedwater> @phatfreemiguel what are brands for, then? I wonder if there's a recording of that talk somewhere...
861193694023532548 2017-05-07 12:19:11 UTC <icedwater> just a bit of a problem for the world at large, is all ;)
860473064345161728 2017-05-05 12:35:40 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepodcast simple, just deny them entry. Anyway numbers mean nothing when they are "silent majority".
860153689738051584 2017-05-04 15:26:35 UTC <icedwater> Guess this is modern warfare after all.https://twitter.com/thenewpaper/status/859274849625096193
859907984259915785 2017-05-03 23:10:14 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @dazhan14 I suppose we should be glad there is interest at all ;)
859793326156816384 2017-05-03 15:34:37 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA semi-retired from that arena already right? Was my impression ;)
859785615079899137 2017-05-03 15:03:59 UTC <icedwater> Extended musings on the FAS election results by a "retired legend", @singnoname.https://twitter.com/singnoname/status/858755748972474368
859760967202160640 2017-05-03 13:26:02 UTC <icedwater> @ZeeKoTCF @singnoname @abearfromSEA ooh. Didn't catch that coincidence! Or is it one... #sleaguefeedsgunners
859555663248105472 2017-05-02 23:50:14 UTC <icedwater> @betelbox @goseasia check it out once, then walk over to Maxwell hawker centre for cheaper options ;)
859380741108416514 2017-05-02 12:15:09 UTC <icedwater> @NICKIMINAJ @yazbanz @5828888 @abearfromSEA this one is different. Adopted brother to @nickiminaj.
859373989944115203 2017-05-02 11:48:20 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb why not?
858893842774343680 2017-04-30 04:00:24 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz well, the line is hard to draw. Would you allow headscarves and turbans but not veils? I suppose the key is a visible face?
858869021097172993 2017-04-30 02:21:46 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz lol what
858860295820722180 2017-04-30 01:47:06 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh we should, actually :)
858545086262460416 2017-04-29 04:54:34 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold does that mean it's safe to use a Kindle in public now? #reversehipster
858504625212628992 2017-04-29 02:13:47 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter I can foresee they will have issues around the centre of Singapore, and in the MCE area too.
858502812384153600 2017-04-29 02:06:35 UTC <icedwater> @JonErlichman @parth2eets yeah, I know Amazon is better organized for scale and stuff but I've never asked Barnes & Noble to deliver lamps.
858501841956384769 2017-04-29 02:02:43 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo @tanhuiyi we Chinese eat anything.
858165931381370880 2017-04-28 03:47:56 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz Milovan. It's marvellous what he can do for you.
858142607712571393 2017-04-28 02:15:15 UTC <icedwater> simple. Drive-by trolling does not require the use of logic.
858129863059709952 2017-04-28 01:24:37 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh chaos ensues.
857933018702372864 2017-04-28 12:22:25 UTC <icedwater> @LiberalLogic123 you know those two aren't mutually exclusive, right?
857929135116529665 2017-04-28 12:07:00 UTC <icedwater> Yay, another text I don't have time to read.https://twitter.com/corkmork/status/856916476233568257
857773447341948928 2017-04-27 01:48:21 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline what does that say about Twitter though ;)
857773048216276993 2017-04-27 01:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @STsportsdesk rather overlooking that TBFC did, and they managed to get decent returns from their jackpot room in the first place.
857612091514953729 2017-04-27 15:07:10 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @bargeboards @singnoname @whyvo @ofmeowandbake I thought you could have worked something out with the envelope ;)
857602264793362432 2017-04-27 14:28:08 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake congratulations! Did you collect the prize as is our custom? @whyvo @singnoname @bargeboards @psy_lsh
857544761971843072 2017-04-27 10:39:38 UTC <icedwater> @marcoagutier I was wondering if you'd be reachable on any platform
857405277653446656 2017-04-26 01:25:22 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity oops heh. Can happen yeah. I've been trained against this by dumping stuff into an IRC channel repeatedly :p
857402096991129600 2017-04-26 01:12:44 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld (#latereply @kolatubosun) when the algorithms are tweaked by humans and collect data from humans, how different is it?
857384997572853760 2017-04-26 00:04:47 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter lol well
857233150639878148 2017-04-26 14:01:24 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @j_hotz wear makeup still can fight leh.
857206055415144449 2017-04-26 12:13:44 UTC <icedwater> @gautam_anand25 that said, it does sound like something @hackerspacesg could try to implement. Blockchain governance.
857205494586396672 2017-04-26 12:11:30 UTC <icedwater> @gautam_anand25 fascinating. But as long as humans get to decide who they vote for in a DAO, you're back to square one.
857204579179479040 2017-04-26 12:07:52 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @TNPSports I'm not certain postponement will do any good. The stench and taint will just resurface then. Let's all move forward.
857203727484178433 2017-04-26 12:04:29 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang oooh wooo @fictograph
857203447401136128 2017-04-26 12:03:22 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake jiayou! Where else are you applying?
857042993424908288 2017-04-25 01:25:47 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold wasn't the SDP trying to fill that gap? But I think we are still on survival mode. We can start to think more about others.
857027022878457856 2017-04-25 00:22:19 UTC <icedwater> @Arthur_Jefarson which you're trying to close. :) @neiljhk @EnglishTommy1
857026956788867072 2017-04-25 00:22:03 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 @neiljhk @Arthur_Jefarson I'm not denying that. But it's looking more and more like a statement of fact on my part :)
857011643271663617 2017-04-25 23:21:12 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 @neiljhk @Arthur_Jefarson yay, personal attacks :) fun road to go down :)
857010544330522624 2017-04-25 23:16:50 UTC <icedwater> @Arthur_Jefarson that is at least as deplorable as you are. @neiljhk @EnglishTommy1 see where hyperbole gets you?
857009224395530240 2017-04-25 23:11:36 UTC <icedwater> @Arthur_Jefarson how much would you eager? Because you could donate that to a Muslim charity. @neiljhk @EnglishTommy1
856879878804709377 2017-04-25 14:37:37 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez bueh lotti can. Jiak lotti must drink water also hor.

856824454101454848 2017-04-25 10:57:23 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StirringTrouble better to elect an old-looking leader who runs as an outsider, hmm?
856771344406528000 2017-04-25 07:26:21 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold totally, I agree. Not would I. But how do you know this isn't a ploy to catch bots and block/report them :p @shimmertje8
856762726378381313 2017-04-24 06:52:06 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld @PeopleOfUK Perhaps @peopleofuk could help me out here? Or @werworld? I wanted a straw poll about *British* Muslims' attitude towards gays. #fb
856762346043195396 2017-04-24 06:50:35 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @ladystormhold ran out of space for hashtags, didn't feel like editing more at the time. Thanks for the reminder.
856680225207234561 2017-04-24 01:24:16 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I think you're referring to reports like these on an ICM study? https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law @EnglishTommy1
856668658218672128 2017-04-24 00:38:18 UTC <icedwater> @madibotak @abearfromSEA ya. Extra flavour ;)
856668400461922304 2017-04-24 00:37:17 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 @neiljhk again, I'd love to see hard statistics for that.
856666368107618304 2017-04-24 00:29:12 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepodcast independent of whatever politics is going on, that's already 50 more spectators than the average #NFL match used to get.
856548882871746561 2017-04-24 16:42:22 UTC <icedwater> @necropants @magetrash how about "assplain"?
856548572220620801 2017-04-24 16:41:08 UTC <icedwater> @necropants OMG dogsplaining.
856548297342730241 2017-04-24 16:40:02 UTC <icedwater> Please help get this RTed so British Muslims can follow me and I can follow them back? I just want to ask a quick question. Thanks :) #fb
856547781946728449 2017-04-24 16:37:59 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay or in strings :p @GeorgeTakei
856547709242585088 2017-04-24 16:37:42 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 @neiljhk first off, I doubt that question has been asked. Second, even if they did believe it, how would they get it passed?
856508305916559362 2017-04-24 14:01:07 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 @neiljhk I'm anti-exaggeration.
856486184737939456 2017-04-24 12:33:13 UTC <icedwater> @alfiedotwtf @terrantjabocs I suppose that says something about adhering to human interface devices standards...
856484934927515649 2017-04-24 12:28:15 UTC <icedwater> @LeagueACS @shimmertje8 @eduardo_LACS RTed for what it's worth. Let's hope this awareness leads to actual action. Who can we petition?
856483566712111104 2017-04-24 12:22:49 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @jongaunt are those 2 and 2 to be put together in the first place?
856483356350885890 2017-04-24 12:21:59 UTC <icedwater> @EnglishTommy1 I don't particularly care for what you're saying but you should be allowed to say it. @neiljhk
856481963284152320 2017-04-24 12:16:27 UTC <icedwater> @GeorgeTakei 0/10 is halfway there, right? @harishpillay
856477274140323842 2017-04-24 11:57:49 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue not actual quotes so much as invented likely sayings. Not from Temasek either.
856466616095129600 2017-04-24 11:15:28 UTC <icedwater> @cdivakaruni @vc60000 beauty is, has been, and always will be there. Its definition just evolves, usually faster than we do.
856464985832144896 2017-04-24 11:08:59 UTC <icedwater> @jayhalia like across Singapore? I thought they were just getting set up at Hillv2!
856354986111807488 2017-04-23 03:51:53 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH you mean "adapt ... to" or "acquit ... in", probably. But yes, probably only him, Sakurada, Inui, and Nakajima? @abearfromSEA
856310083612925953 2017-04-23 00:53:28 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake thanks for taking over planning for this round!
856303442012160000 2017-04-23 00:27:04 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake sorry, didn't see the #sgtipsytrivia tweets this time. Can't make it this month, have fun!
856303099517976576 2017-04-23 00:25:42 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue "History doesn't matter, only progress."  "For some reason, Singaporeans don't feel attached to their home country."
856192548678782976 2017-04-23 17:06:25 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter you *could* use the A as a 4 or a B as an 8 ... Just saying :p
856192266368569344 2017-04-23 17:05:18 UTC <icedwater> @thekuehdiaries if I had to read that kind of proofreading in my seven extra hours I'd probably die sooner.
856191472168689664 2017-04-23 17:02:08 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I'm for the scheduling points but the LionsXII has shown nostalgia doesn't have staying power. @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH @yazbanz
856191050557169664 2017-04-23 17:00:28 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH good read, though I disagree with quite a bit. Hougang are no world beaters but well worth support. @yazbanz @singnoname
856190640148824064 2017-04-23 16:58:50 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo I think Albirex is a shining example off the pitch if not always on it, and Home/Warriors aren't uniformed clubs @ChannelNewsAsia
856188964083974144 2017-04-23 16:52:10 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ @Jay7t I'd be very happy with less physical space - make me work from home or a cafe! - and more leeway to make mistakes.
856095722252390402 2017-04-23 10:41:40 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter are you doing Airbus anytime soon?
856075511889510402 2017-04-23 09:21:21 UTC <icedwater> @avalon hmm. Nothing from e.g. Sim Lim Tower?
856074893447675904 2017-04-23 09:18:54 UTC <icedwater> @avalon @ladystormhold besides, the amount of effort that goes into these could also help discourage meetings where email would suffice.
856074627138764800 2017-04-23 09:17:50 UTC <icedwater> @avalon @ladystormhold I think many are small tweaks that can be worked into the meeting style. Also, attention drifts; guidance helps.
856071309184311296 2017-04-23 09:04:39 UTC <icedwater> @NOH8ER I'm sure they do. Doesn't make this less relevant though.

855680451918286848 2017-04-22 07:11:32 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz both need to be checked. The pot and the kettle both have cracks.
855438152571338752 2017-04-21 15:08:43 UTC <icedwater> @matchdaySG @DilDilly let me try to remember the password first, then I'll make the change. Check your DMs please :)

855283731317141504 2017-04-20 04:55:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Or the 2nd floor hawker centre at Smith Street would do too, and it's a nearer alternative to Chinatown "Foo(le)d $treet".

854668844702367745 2017-04-19 12:11:46 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld applies to Singapore too. And most other countries I'd bet :p On the other hand, "Singaporean" "kiasuism" is also everywhere.

852357810683731968 2017-04-12 03:08:32 UTC <icedwater> @thepatrickryan_ @MuslimIQ @donaldtrump1010 no, that's fair. I hadn't seen the link because I was replying to another thread :)
852356653110280193 2017-04-12 03:03:56 UTC <icedwater> @thepatrickryan_ @MuslimIQ @donaldtrump1010 fair enough, I hadn't seen this link when I replied to the other tweet.
852356229628284928 2017-04-12 03:02:15 UTC <icedwater> @GregLand33 that's quite an assumption given that innocent people can also bear arms. Were the 950 all black?
852355908227153920 2017-04-12 03:00:59 UTC <icedwater> @thepatrickryan_ @MuslimIQ @donaldtrump1010 nope. You introduced the statement, the onus is on you to back it up.
852353858177126402 2017-04-12 02:52:50 UTC <icedwater> @GregLand33 right. Sure. You know for a fact that 99% of black people deserve the shootings they got? Not 98% or 97%? OK. Citations please.
852353459944693761 2017-04-12 02:51:15 UTC <icedwater> @thepatrickryan_ @MuslimIQ @donaldtrump1010 uh huh.
852351945566167040 2017-04-12 02:45:14 UTC <icedwater> @GregLand33 irrelevant.
852341481587081216 2017-04-12 02:03:39 UTC <icedwater> @GregLand33 lol. You speak as if black people are only held accountable for their own actions and choices.
852319793482874880 2017-04-12 00:37:28 UTC <icedwater> @GregLand33 said every black person, ever.
852170392185716736 2017-04-12 14:43:48 UTC <icedwater> @kixes you spelled "mall island state" wrong... #typos
852169216895590400 2017-04-12 14:39:08 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname at least Chicago Fire might be able to win the World Cup then...
852101938988457984 2017-04-12 10:11:48 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch the fact that similar phrases used to be used on the African-American population encourages me ;)
852101425291083776 2017-04-12 10:09:45 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch as is enforcing arbitrary rules on a growing minority without regard for their concerns.
852101252594843648 2017-04-12 10:09:04 UTC <icedwater> @VIPatriarch it's one thing to be able to express a thought well in a single tweet; entirely another to discuss over a whole thread.
852084012579307520 2017-04-12 09:00:34 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch this isn't relevant, though, until you're hiring one of those Muslim women as staff and they apply those norms.
852083808576851968 2017-04-12 08:59:45 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch it's not a problem. When wearing the state employee hat, personal beliefs should be kept out as far as possible.
852083521468235776 2017-04-12 08:58:37 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch you can treat individuals in a neutral manner without forcing staff to eschew accessories like a pendant or headscarf
852083082140065794 2017-04-12 08:56:52 UTC <icedwater> @VIPatriarch then they need to learn to use Twitter better ;)
852079498325508097 2017-04-12 08:42:37 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch I see your point, but I think we should allow more of those to make it a non-issue. If that is ever possible.
852031054353375233 2017-04-11 05:30:07 UTC <icedwater> @DanielMiessler I agree. This is a crazy idea.
851981810955239424 2017-04-11 02:14:27 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch can a state be secular without allowing its members to openly practice the religion they choose to believe in?
851981542410772480 2017-04-11 02:13:23 UTC <icedwater> @VIPatriarch there are ways to elaborate if you want, like threading. Unfortunately this encourages those who like to quote out of context.
851610402374918144 2017-04-10 01:38:36 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch I prefer conversation like this too, but many seem to like drive-by trolling.
851610248276197376 2017-04-10 01:37:59 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch giving Muslims a place to pray and to wear what they need to doesn't affect others, right?
851610046022656000 2017-04-10 01:37:11 UTC <icedwater> @STcom @AdamFlinter @STCom also doing well on the Twitter front I'd say
851609700722331653 2017-04-10 01:35:49 UTC <icedwater> @avalon @nicshields also, get off the train to let people inside exit, and if you're waiting to board, give way to those giving way.
851608289980723200 2017-04-10 01:30:13 UTC <icedwater> @STEEZUSxCHRIST special kind of sense of humour eh.
851604325654708224 2017-04-10 01:14:27 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch again, not arguing with you there - that's why I asked for clarification.
851604210370002944 2017-04-10 01:14:00 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch yes, but they should have room to practice their religion too. Do we ban crucifix necklaces and rosary bracelets?
851603717790941184 2017-04-10 01:12:03 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch sorry, I think catering to minorities is right. If it had been expressed as a preference, would it have been OK?
851601318716219392 2017-04-10 01:02:31 UTC <icedwater> @VIPatriarch just wondering, which "intrusive 'religious freedoms'" do you see in "state institutions"? @MuslimIQ
851600997285679104 2017-04-10 01:01:14 UTC <icedwater> @VIPatriarch what about @MuslimIQ's claim is hilarious? The white supremacy statement? I suppose, though I doubt it was meant as humour.
851596952089239552 2017-04-10 00:45:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG now you know why ;)pic.twitter.com/KPDFImLSy4
851595807513952256 2017-04-10 00:40:37 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch ## < Original topic < > Your point >            | |
851595484791570433 2017-04-10 00:39:20 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch you brought that in. I didn't. I'm saying abuse tends to happen with people in power, regardless of race or religion.
851584464547225601 2017-04-10 23:55:32 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @businessinsider good for the high priority areas, will need to be adapted for everywhere else though.
851579732965466112 2017-04-10 23:36:44 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ @VIPatriarch par for the course. Same with the Japanese here during WWII and by whites almost everywhere else.
851431606606626816 2017-04-10 13:48:08 UTC <icedwater> One way to restructure the education system: switch from the conveyor belt to the composable unit. @vgrhttps://twitter.com/vgr/status/851220270299754496
851428050000420868 2017-04-10 13:34:00 UTC <icedwater> it's not officially published any more... We just can't stop people from collecting and sharing the data themselves.
851383641242337280 2017-04-10 10:37:32 UTC <icedwater> @donaldtrump1010 you're going to have to back that up. "Lose lives to Islam"? @MuslimIQ @thepatrickryan_
851381281103331329 2017-04-10 10:28:09 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ I like the thread, but was white supremacy a thing at the time?
851380481039810561 2017-04-10 10:24:59 UTC <icedwater> @MuslimIQ Thanks @muslimIQ for the thread refuting the links between violence and the Qur'an. Reading now.https://twitter.com/MuslimIQ/status/850454659408044032
851049023570026496 2017-04-09 12:27:53 UTC <icedwater> @RichardBSpencer more intelligent than you then. @dazhan14
851026121399218177 2017-04-09 10:56:53 UTC <icedwater> @eisen go check out Mehringdamm's Mustafa Kebab and Curry 36 if you haven't already. And there should be time for Mauerpark today :)
850877888337371137 2017-04-08 01:07:51 UTC <icedwater> I doubt the ones on the right will do the same though ;)
850776555710160896 2017-04-08 18:25:12 UTC <icedwater> @AssassinTurkyJT I think we'll need better data for that.
850773491175407617 2017-04-08 18:13:01 UTC <icedwater> Because I'm inspired by your work and your quirks. Also, we met once. Keep on writing, please...https://twitter.com/halleluyang/status/850743634781552640
850771326214127616 2017-04-08 18:04:25 UTC <icedwater> @TulsiGabbard @Evan_McMullin is there concrete proof that Assad's regime was responsible for the attacks, though?
850769476790267905 2017-04-08 17:57:04 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz "oh no, we can't beat their plan and resources...how do we win?" or "they're so hated we just need to turn up and we'll win"?
850768552185311232 2017-04-08 17:53:24 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif heh, I don't suppose C.R. got where he did without hard work either... Unless you're saying he has no talent ;)
850617177816223745 2017-04-08 07:51:53 UTC <icedwater> @eisen no fixed plans yet. How many more days do you have in the area?
850614461337542656 2017-04-08 07:41:05 UTC <icedwater> @SethAbramson @TomFlowers could you provide us all this evidence, then?
850596208133394433 2017-04-07 06:28:33 UTC <icedwater> @AssassinTurkyJT And? I'm saying it's not exclusive to Muslims.
850591771276922880 2017-04-07 06:10:56 UTC <icedwater> @AMDWaters @neiljhk Nope, but when was the last terrorist attack in Indonesia and Malaysia you heard of?
850556403718602753 2017-04-07 03:50:23 UTC <icedwater> @eisen oh is this the cafe in the basement? Or something along the street?
850556236839788545 2017-04-07 03:49:44 UTC <icedwater> @avalon is the pain at least milder now?
850554229471059969 2017-04-07 03:41:45 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @weknowwhatsbest Trump exceeds her corruption.
850553577600831488 2017-04-07 03:39:10 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk wow, there's an alarming amount of hyperbole on both sides.
850550219255160832 2017-04-07 03:25:49 UTC <icedwater> @AssassinTurkyJT see also, the Crusades, the Thirty Year War, and slavery.
850550061222084608 2017-04-07 03:25:11 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @AMDWaters I don't feel that's the right lesson to take away. It's not like the Muslims here are doing the same.
850387809550467072 2017-04-07 16:40:27 UTC <icedwater> @avalon if I asked you to rest well, would the eye roll be enough to knock you out? :P
850386959759310852 2017-04-07 16:37:05 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I'm glad that at least you didn't accuse me of bottling it.
850372828117352450 2017-04-07 15:40:56 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I suppose any further attempt to pun could become too contrived.
850370140340236288 2017-04-07 15:30:15 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname you're a barrel of laughs aren't you.
850366393165815808 2017-04-07 15:15:21 UTC <icedwater> I got progressive. But it's odd that so many possible paths can be clustered onto two outcomes. Are there others?
850364567309791238 2017-04-07 15:08:06 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish you forgot your hashtag #lianleav
850333832565751808 2017-04-07 13:05:58 UTC <icedwater> @RSoxDude can you provide proof @ShaunKing is lying about a tweet he quoted?
850254209249230850 2017-04-07 07:49:35 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv trying to get streaming to increase volume just by predicting it :)
850147893096742913 2017-04-06 00:47:07 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv especially since we are still in the valley before it actually goes up. I wonder if it's meant to be a self-fulfilling prophecy?
849936112327970816 2017-04-06 10:45:34 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz so I should believe you just because you told me this? :P
849817731780067328 2017-04-05 02:55:10 UTC <icedwater> Easy to promise, hard to deliver. Let's see how it goes.https://twitter.com/PM_Haze/status/849797937861238784
849791597948551169 2017-04-05 01:11:19 UTC <icedwater> @omgubuntu I'm sure there will be enough Unity fans out there who'll fork and build their own if it isn't already done...
849790302403428352 2017-04-05 01:06:11 UTC <icedwater> @eisen it is a pretty sight, and thought-provoking too. I'll see this next trip. Thanks! :)
849659441485979648 2017-04-05 16:26:11 UTC <icedwater> Am I the only one who thinks hiding "logout" in a menu is a dark pattern? I would prefer it as a top-level button...
849652093249961984 2017-04-05 15:56:59 UTC <icedwater> @Molitics I wonder about the quality of the citations, especially the IQ-lowering bit...
849650509711409153 2017-04-05 15:50:41 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I Got: 26% Monica, 21% Chandler, 18% Ross, 15% Phoebe, 11% Joey, and 9% Rachel! But for the best friends Qs I anyhow.
849645334452084738 2017-04-05 15:30:08 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @AudiKhalid let me vote for a MP to represent me who will stay in Australia and attend Parliament via Skype #whynot
849599933648732160 2017-04-05 12:29:43 UTC <icedwater> I'd like to hear about that. But it wouldn't technically be too much @hellofrmSG. Help relieve @ladystormhold :)https://twitter.com/ladystormhold/status/849528018028638210
849598493735833600 2017-04-05 12:24:00 UTC <icedwater> What is photography? Thanks @hellofrmSG for the thread.https://twitter.com/hellofrmSG/status/849515026549542913
849431347605250049 2017-04-04 01:19:49 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG that's y i shun Twitter sometimes
849288775112851458 2017-04-04 15:53:17 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz even so, Formula 1 manages to progress...
849167912195702784 2017-04-04 07:53:01 UTC <icedwater> @cheeaun ugh.
849167702899867648 2017-04-04 07:52:11 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako I mean maybe people "up there" are more open now that Schooling has shown what is possible. But team sport  individual sport.
849136692493598720 2017-04-03 05:48:58 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako probably the door was opened by Schooling.
849062318319181824 2017-04-03 00:53:26 UTC <icedwater> Hmm @dwu00 was this the colour you meant?https://twitter.com/gullevek/status/848677645055270912

848894281393684482 2017-04-03 13:45:43 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya as big as the issue may be, I don't want to read any more about the Yee.
848701577762177026 2017-04-02 00:59:58 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I see the source of your confusion. 2 thoughts in a tweet, sorry. I was replying to my 1st sentence, @GaryKLH to the 2nd.
848688321207214081 2017-04-02 00:07:18 UTC <icedwater> Lol!https://twitter.com/sgelection/status/848316600809902080
848590881602977793 2017-04-02 17:40:06 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname I'm assuming he kept on my subject, replying to my tweet. May not be if he'd made several replies to one. #threadfin
848589608350662656 2017-04-02 17:35:03 UTC <icedwater> @mikebutcher @Arch_StantonGBU ha!
848547304181071872 2017-04-02 14:46:57 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya it's also why I still want to go see North Korea for myself before it opens up and becomes a "global" destination...
848546872054530048 2017-04-02 14:45:14 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter what specifically do you mean?
848546611038830592 2017-04-02 14:44:11 UTC <icedwater> @eisen indeed! Gotta love the Germans. :)
848546289784569858 2017-04-02 14:42:55 UTC <icedwater> @eisen oh dear! Welcome to Germany :p hope it's resolved now?
848544361881018368 2017-04-02 14:35:15 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid Belated welcome to @audikhalid for @hellofrmSG and thanks @sunflowerscent for the good week that passed :)
848543780147822592 2017-04-02 14:32:57 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH on the grounds that official league or not, they actually have fans who want to attend games and are willing to travel, not whine.
848538986129772544 2017-04-02 14:13:54 UTC <icedwater> @SavageTruthsSG lol @ "Tan Ah Pow" @AudiKhalid
848537947250884609 2017-04-02 14:09:46 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @eisen also like JE, the intersection of the east-west line with another more useful line that goes in a loop :p
848535155576684546 2017-04-02 13:58:40 UTC <icedwater> @thekuehdiaries yeah the fireflies certainly added an odd dimension to the wristband lights...
848393986221916160 2017-04-01 04:37:43 UTC <icedwater> @joulisians eww, I wouldn't suggest that of anybody, tempting as it may be in this case :( @kosherjellyfish

848071811208167424 2017-04-01 07:17:30 UTC <icedwater> Singapore's public transport system is like quicksand. The more last-minute transfers you make to try to fix a mistake...
848007789960019969 2017-03-31 03:03:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm assisting with language technology research - building systems and testing them. Don't ask me about Siri :p

847980538493153280 2017-03-31 01:14:49 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I would be biased, being in A*, but I think there's enough prospect for development as long as funds are properly allocated.
847858687074902019 2017-03-31 17:10:38 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter from Bras Basah Complex and Rochor Centre, we have come reaaaally far.

843161020751208448 2017-03-18 18:03:47 UTC <icedwater> I agree on this point (plus belatedly realise I should have threaded my replies too.) Singlish, too, can one lor be broken.
843160804115402753 2017-03-18 18:02:55 UTC <icedwater> it used to, though, until our drive to "Speak Good English" succeeded. As with Mandarin, I believe a backpedal will come.
843160260051271681 2017-03-18 18:00:45 UTC <icedwater> I don't know, maybe I'm in denial, but I think broken English and Singlish and Singapore English are distinct beasts.
843159994480578561 2017-03-18 17:59:42 UTC <icedwater> I agree about code-switching. It's an essential skill to have. I'm in favour of training that skill and preserving Singlish

839617339108667393 2017-03-08 23:22:27 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk no, those are cultural norms being practiced in their native places when codified as law. Can't be applied in the UK.

839114565228998656 2017-03-07 14:04:37 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW @neiljhk legally, sure. But where norms are concerned, some leeway should be afforded, right?
839103993829720066 2017-03-07 13:22:36 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi western bias!!! :P
839083277818290176 2017-03-07 12:00:17 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW @neiljhk OK, on a more mature note. How much of the host country's norms should be imposed on migrants for "successful integration"?
839082342631145472 2017-03-07 11:56:34 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW @neiljhk of course it is. Because the only right culture is what you deem it to be.
838954954031153153 2017-03-06 03:30:22 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh oh hmm which organizations would those be? If they work with preteens too that would be interesting.

838391273010544641 2017-03-05 14:10:30 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren eeeeeeee
838355399187156993 2017-03-05 11:47:57 UTC <icedwater> That's a different proposition. @KenJeyaretnam
838255131502108674 2017-03-04 05:09:32 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid lmgtfy is a fun site to use if it's still up :)
838254980087738368 2017-03-04 05:08:55 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam brutally honest or just salty, I can't tell any more.
838045164710961152 2017-03-04 15:15:12 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog they might contain 0.00006% lost doll though.
838011709390381056 2017-03-04 13:02:15 UTC <icedwater> @docherself @singnoname @hellofrmSG we may need to pre-emptively mute @frhn. #bananafritter
838010762576572416 2017-03-04 12:58:29 UTC <icedwater> @AnechoicMedia14 that's just racism. Pity it's so institutionalised.
838010070042464258 2017-03-04 12:55:44 UTC <icedwater> before they're even up? OK, sure.
838009861975597056 2017-03-04 12:54:55 UTC <icedwater> @ShaunKing @willwilkinson pretty sure that one is already counted in.
838008287891070976 2017-03-04 12:48:39 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo do you even stay near Yishun?
837893009299521536 2017-03-03 05:10:35 UTC <icedwater> Hi @whyvopic.twitter.com/REQH8J395N
837873001592827904 2017-03-03 03:51:05 UTC <icedwater> @AprilTrubody honest question. Where do I find a list of these possible genders?
837872551674028032 2017-03-03 03:49:17 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon @singnoname #singoffside due to 3 days' delayed reaction ;)
837869405698600964 2017-03-03 03:36:47 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling I guess Sami Zayn doesn't count?
837869294515970049 2017-03-03 03:36:21 UTC <icedwater> @necropants @hellofrmSG no wonder you had to emphasize men first. Tsk, fragile much ;)
837864856971694081 2017-03-03 03:18:43 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling @ProWrestlingMag but if crowds have been encouraged to express themselves all along, this was an inevitable outcome.
837664397174550529 2017-03-03 14:02:09 UTC <icedwater> Thank YOU @jemmawei for the longest thread. Indeed, "what about NS?"https://twitter.com/jemmawei/status/836535387451318272
837661841039876096 2017-03-03 13:52:00 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname they are just as random. Just much more sensible to pick from the region where talent is ignored than to scout from far away.
837640644986208257 2017-03-03 12:27:47 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi what is marriage? As in the fact that you both agreed to commit to a life together? If so I agree.
837621287568596992 2017-03-03 11:10:51 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi not your kids first?
837345763910787072 2017-03-02 16:56:01 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA at least you didn't #ownselfquoteownself like #SuperJunior.
837345435907862528 2017-03-02 16:54:43 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @joeyayoub hmm you'd have to debate @sahouraxo on that I suppose...
837342840564785152 2017-03-02 16:44:24 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Icelandic to travel there, or Vietnamese to chat with my colleagues...
837309652509442048 2017-03-02 14:32:32 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh lame stock hacker picture of someone displaying an exe file on command line :)
837307031052701696 2017-03-02 14:22:07 UTC <icedwater> @kosamari apparently Linus Torvalds claims git hashes are still OK, PDF is more vulnerable to this method of collision?
837264251458727936 2017-03-02 11:32:07 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho you might find more sleep solves the problem.
837185351680589824 2017-03-01 06:18:36 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @AdamFlinter @psy_lsh they definitely need help coping with academics :p
837119298917154816 2017-03-01 01:56:08 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy @I_amGermany does that mean the Iceland street was just renamed, or did they recently replace the sign?
837117986343272448 2017-03-01 01:50:55 UTC <icedwater> @sahouraxo his point exactly?
837109546392825856 2017-03-01 01:17:23 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I suppose social media personas, as with pro wrestling, magnify what's already there. In this case, complain and compare.
837109185015787520 2017-03-01 01:15:57 UTC <icedwater> @necropants @hellofrmSG but if you'd stop to think how the "spanking new" brains were got... Hello darkness, my old friend.
837100984660733953 2017-03-01 00:43:21 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thanks for opening up. Have you gone for your pre-enlistment check up? That might be a good time to get a referral.
836925432263892993 2017-03-01 13:05:47 UTC <icedwater> Go down this tunnel, it's fun and reminds you programmers are human too :) #fbhttps://twitter.com/simonw/status/836193024497483776

836917228368875520 2017-03-01 12:33:11 UTC <icedwater> I don't see how what @SaraBareilles wore is at all relevant to the situation, @hellogiggles.https://twitter.com/hellogiggles/status/836102338490339328
836911988626223104 2017-03-01 12:12:21 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice even if your intention is not to exotify your culture, can you control how others see it? I vote don't worry, just share.
836887258087186432 2017-03-01 10:34:05 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH I'm not going to persuade you on this, I know you won't budge.
836834432971649024 2017-02-28 07:04:11 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH violence seems to be your answer to any number of issues. I promise you it is not a useful one.
836586128908009475 2017-02-28 14:37:30 UTC <icedwater> @DevilRays9 lame excuse want to recycle for how long @singnoname
836521817380528128 2017-02-28 10:21:57 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk right way around is your opinion, that's fine. @flexdream @RedHotSquirrel
836376774065844225 2017-02-27 00:45:36 UTC <icedwater> @lilyallen sorry to hear about your loss.
836369338865086468 2017-02-27 00:16:04 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon what else am I missing that's happening at the same time...
836210624061296640 2017-02-27 13:45:23 UTC <icedwater> I bet @Goldberg is next, right @WWEAsuka? #whosnext

836209147779506176 2017-02-27 13:39:31 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany I'd say the same of labskaus from Hamburg :D
836206454331756544 2017-02-27 13:28:49 UTC <icedwater> @RedHotSquirrel @neiljhk @flexdream and these are mutually exclusive.
836202444409352192 2017-02-27 13:12:53 UTC <icedwater> if you have to put in effort for your own orgasm, why are you in bed with a partner at all?
836190856763719680 2017-02-27 12:26:50 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz you're thinking of Dumbo, the flying elephant...
836187185367797764 2017-02-27 12:12:15 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA anyhow.
836187068204142592 2017-02-27 12:11:47 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon why, are people releasing bad patches to SSL or something?
836186567081246720 2017-02-27 12:09:47 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @ofmeowandbake seconded. Currywurst is a travesty to two cultures. But pretty tasty. Ha! I've never been to the bunker tour...
836186271236009984 2017-02-27 12:08:37 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity good to know you're OK with it. The terminal is pretty scary to many but at least the GUI side is already competitive.
835862572029005826 2017-02-26 14:42:21 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz nice! Wonder how much further he will go.
835846271717920770 2017-02-26 13:37:35 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren wait, why?
835845324153335808 2017-02-26 13:33:49 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @abearfromSEA this Nakatake is the one from Admiralty or Eunos who went to Hougang is it?
835836401400721408 2017-02-26 12:58:21 UTC <icedwater> @honcheng wut
835716891804999681 2017-02-25 05:03:28 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity yup, fair enough. Do you like the Unity interface?
835699365347893248 2017-02-25 03:53:49 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @yingers11 for your week as @hellofrmSG, and welcome, @kish_kebab!
835670462604533760 2017-02-25 01:58:58 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity hmm. They're both Debian-based distros. Which do you prefer? I'm still too used to Ubuntu but have tried SuSE, CentOS, Fedora.
835509874108719104 2017-02-25 15:20:51 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG think so but a long time ago, thanks for reminding me! Didn't fully understand it but I felt it quite a bit.
835506179371487232 2017-02-25 15:06:10 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG something always brings me back to her. It never takes too long, no matter what I say or do.
835504658084847616 2017-02-25 15:00:08 UTC <icedwater> Oh dear. Just realised Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple spells #MAGA. It's a conspiracy y'all.
835502672031571969 2017-02-25 14:52:14 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity which distribution do you prefer?
835499603201929217 2017-02-25 14:40:02 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin how was your reservist meeting yesterday pakcik?
835497551113539584 2017-02-25 14:31:53 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen heh, OK.
835494731131965442 2017-02-25 14:20:41 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Sweet As Whole - Sara Bareilles. It's a nice intro to her body of work :)
835494048676773889 2017-02-25 14:17:58 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen my guess would be the canal one.
835493568458338304 2017-02-25 14:16:04 UTC <icedwater> @eisen planned your complete Berlin itinerary already?
835134383451320320 2017-02-24 14:28:47 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv I don't stir it in. But then again, I also love to drink off the bottom part afterwards lol #fml

835123735371776001 2017-02-24 13:46:29 UTC <icedwater> @AdrianChen it's still confusing, we don't know what the intersection is. I use both FB and Twitter, for instance... Is there a paper?
835119244379488256 2017-02-24 13:28:38 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice I bet you will swear blind this was intentional ;)pic.twitter.com/Acjj9tlllj

834982406113243136 2017-02-23 04:24:53 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG practiced a bit more nia.
834942389949091840 2017-02-23 01:45:52 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG skill and experience ;)
834936315183443968 2017-02-23 01:21:44 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily @ofmeowandbake yeah you don't notice it until you listen to the content closely. Lol :p
834932842740121601 2017-02-23 01:07:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I hope this lasts longer than the cardboard one!
834932227230224384 2017-02-23 01:05:29 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA in other news, he also managed to stop sleeping by waking up in the morning.
834796041522122754 2017-02-23 16:04:20 UTC <icedwater> @divinegarbage hello there :)
834556766453067776 2017-02-22 00:13:33 UTC <icedwater> and yet this "hounding" is also a political opinion, isn't it? @neiljhk @piersmorgan
834552528247197696 2017-02-22 23:56:42 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh congratulations :) keep chasing your dreams, no matter what they say.
834551785595432960 2017-02-22 23:53:45 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice "work" is overrated. As long as you can sustain yourself, keep on learning and growing. Don't follow the false dichotomy.
834381053074747392 2017-02-22 12:35:19 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat hey would you be free on June 3? I'd like to invite you to a Rainforest table at my wedding dinner.

833676931254018048 2017-02-20 13:57:24 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH perhaps the reason and logic must be questioned to begin with.
833542980392751104 2017-02-19 05:05:07 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen I thought you'd have pulled the article a little longer.

833104475552243713 2017-02-18 00:02:39 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon why leh? Different groups do get assigned different access to resources what.
833095407408328705 2017-02-18 23:26:37 UTC <icedwater> @TheMonitorSG @JoseRaymond as far as this goes, it's heartening to see what @HougangUnited are up to, and maybe that will open the door...
833092950213095425 2017-02-18 23:16:52 UTC <icedwater> @TheMonitorSG @JoseRaymond that's the structural side of the issue. Whether that is enough to persuade players to make a career, who knows.
832975091885432833 2017-02-18 15:28:32 UTC <icedwater> @JoseRaymond @TheMonitorSG this has been the case for Singapore football for the longest time. The question is how to encourage turning pro?

832466830329421824 2017-02-16 05:48:53 UTC <icedwater> @TwitterSafety @DAccampoFamily I suppose. But I'd think Twitter employs a panel for this who might not be all atheist/liberal.
832254973312266241 2017-02-16 15:47:02 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk uh huh.
832252486895284225 2017-02-16 15:37:10 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz wait till the Un comes to Yishun.
832140801924665344 2017-02-16 08:13:22 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk that's what you say when you can't substantiate a claim. :)
832016158077263872 2017-02-15 23:58:04 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ the best security is not to get connected. Do you really need to tweet your lights to turn on before you arrive?
832015252921257984 2017-02-15 23:54:29 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM totally believable given the bak kwa sagas. Lol. Did you find out for sure though? +@RedDot_Oz @frhn
832014946439303169 2017-02-15 23:53:15 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz if you're not set back $100 on entry, why not save $10 a month to try to win $50?
832014667962687488 2017-02-15 23:52:09 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo the problem is, this poop can come back to stink up your life...
832013479405957120 2017-02-15 23:47:26 UTC <icedwater> @thenwblkdrphil ah, right, OK.
832001467116511232 2017-02-15 22:59:42 UTC <icedwater> @thenwblkdrphil I don't know, you said the four pictures were bad choices for a real nigga, so I was wondering what you meant...
832001310190772228 2017-02-15 22:59:04 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk and so? Which part of the regime do you have proof of them influencing?
831892419050213377 2017-02-15 15:46:23 UTC <icedwater> @thenwblkdrphil what would be a good choice though :p
831890999169347584 2017-02-15 15:40:44 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG they have to take time to explain. Even "meritocracy" had to be explained at first, and "cul-de-sac" and "knuckleduster"...
831880705089036289 2017-02-15 14:59:50 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @RedDot_Oz I'd reply with something witty but I'd hate to make SMRT look punctual ;)
831879173622804480 2017-02-15 14:53:45 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I'm not convinced Saudi Arabia has a barely functioning government, though... They seem pretty stable to me, let me read.
831869918312230912 2017-02-15 14:16:58 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk "$bn nuclear deals": did @POTUS44 give Iran money to build nuclear facilities? @JohnKerry's daughter didn't marry "into the regime"
831846303650811904 2017-02-15 12:43:08 UTC <icedwater> @frhn @charliekirk11 should we recreate the situations of 1944 then? We're not that far away >_<
831845209784807426 2017-02-15 12:38:47 UTC <icedwater> @nursegalmom why would you be embarrassed? All three branches should be equal and Miller's statement is against this.
831508097688408066 2017-02-14 14:19:13 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch omg avocadoes in winter! I suppose it's summer where they usually grow... Yeah the rest is quite the bargain.
831460555533668352 2017-02-14 11:10:18 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj no, you can just show up. Registration is free and at the door. Come and go as you need to.
831459176576540672 2017-02-14 11:04:50 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho #protip: we all make it to the end.
831420986461351936 2017-02-14 08:33:04 UTC <icedwater> @TayLindSiol he's all right but I'm quite sick of big brooding bruisers. Jericho/Benoit or American Alpha more my type.
831410832726585344 2017-02-13 07:52:44 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj I'll drop by if I can. Will you be going for the first time?
831181349230751744 2017-02-13 16:40:50 UTC <icedwater> @pohui I'd reject it out of hand. More labelling and packaging instead of organic growth is not going to solve the problem.
831180889291792385 2017-02-13 16:39:01 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah I can't even manage tweets... Lol
831180658139500544 2017-02-13 16:38:06 UTC <icedwater> @Nigel_Farage @1jamiefoster @neiljhk it's possible to signal one's virtue despite being unpopular, isn't it?
831175134660603909 2017-02-13 16:16:09 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @PeterSweden7 so, should they have showed no attempt to respect the culture of another nation?
831170955250511872 2017-02-13 15:59:32 UTC <icedwater> @jimjefferies @neiljhk Jetties Morning doesn't really deserve any more attention... Yet he'll always get some somehow :)
831169914001977344 2017-02-13 15:55:24 UTC <icedwater> And straight back into denial.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/830988578033373184
831169314380058624 2017-02-13 15:53:01 UTC <icedwater> @piersmorgan of course. Yours is beneath the ground on which they walk.
831111730252034048 2017-02-13 12:04:12 UTC <icedwater> @nigelfarage @neiljhk @1jamiefoster so when @NigelFarage was "saying the right things" that wasn't "virtue signalling"?
831039987525095424 2017-02-12 07:19:07 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren obviously it was leftover jetfuel from the WTC towers.
830930702233264128 2017-02-12 00:04:52 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch found this article after a Google search for "russische Supermarkt Berlin": https://www.berlin.de/kultur-und-tickets/tipps/multikulti/russisches-berlin/2222382-3039789-russische-spezialitaeten.html
830930192897937408 2017-02-12 00:02:50 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch I don't know of any specific one, but if tiny Osnabrck had a large enough Russian community for it, I guess Berlin has one too.
830835644649787392 2017-02-12 17:47:08 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily @nizambakeri wats ur pt
830796227386028035 2017-02-12 15:10:30 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch how does it compare with the Russian market?
830776861311410177 2017-02-12 13:53:33 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @lackadaisygirl nice pun though
830709377115971584 2017-02-12 09:25:23 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo @singnoname as though the main point of contact were thighs...
830696346319400960 2017-02-12 08:33:37 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo sorry, napping in the rainy weather.
830696246733987840 2017-02-12 08:33:13 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @whyvo Count me in!
830621732771749888 2017-02-11 03:37:07 UTC <icedwater> @furryphotos sometimes we're just fluff and that's fine too.
830621602534416384 2017-02-11 03:36:36 UTC <icedwater> About parents and gender roles. Good reading.https://twitter.com/hormiga/status/829837586961010688
830621189651329024 2017-02-11 03:34:58 UTC <icedwater> @redsports if you call it Katong Laksa, do people from Katong automatically eat it more often?
830597412993396736 2017-02-11 02:00:29 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname well, I'm two days behind as usual, so I didn't see what @whyvo did. Let me catch up :)
830409111594426369 2017-02-11 13:32:15 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 iGroaned
830400669794263040 2017-02-11 12:58:42 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify you don't need that to go on your CV! It shows in your aura. :)
830399617288204289 2017-02-11 12:54:31 UTC <icedwater> @Pablo_Pelo qu es eso, un metodo para cocinar arroz de latinoamerica?
830399029011902466 2017-02-11 12:52:11 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @nerdyasians no! Rice cooker is for people who are lazy. Cook it lo-fi :) just without salt... I mean wtf
830392258188828673 2017-02-11 12:25:16 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @nianymue different venues and undecided people, I guess :)
830386854776025089 2017-02-11 12:03:48 UTC <icedwater> #chopchopkalipok roll call! This month, @SGTipsyTrivia goes East. Feb 23. Who's in? https://www.facebook.com/events/1398049003615752/?ti=clpic.twitter.com/gP6ILzzzbT
830386199508381696 2017-02-11 12:01:12 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh how did you resolve it? :P
830380631347453953 2017-02-11 11:39:04 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @JuriaTRM whenever you tweet, I'll be two days behind you; whatever you're seeing, I tried my best to reply true...
830364912127860736 2017-02-11 10:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz eh you better check your minority privilege ah! Always #ownselfquoteownself!
830324550885707776 2017-02-10 07:56:14 UTC <icedwater> @SingaporeAir @AdamFlinter for show. If only they'd put all expiring unrenewed miles to this charity initiative.
830324241983643648 2017-02-10 07:55:00 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz are you still on the bus?
830215679554920449 2017-02-10 00:43:37 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter did you expect the actual replies to that tweet though? #cynic
830211885895028738 2017-02-10 00:28:32 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @nerissaClarice you should ask old master Lee. He reveals dragons.
830190255584079873 2017-02-10 23:02:35 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @eisen @ileksua @frhn but 2 years+? And the way it works inside? A lot of time is wasted...
830098926774603777 2017-02-10 16:59:41 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @nerissaClarice I suppose it's a tie between you two. The rubber set will have to wait; this series is already overstretched.
830080657929822208 2017-02-10 15:47:05 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @piersmorgan so much for proofreading, ugh.
830080216143794176 2017-02-10 15:45:20 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @nerissaClarice you see lah you make her puncit
829852425477513217 2017-02-09 00:40:10 UTC <icedwater> @mdnoorhadi ask the 80s kids' kids lor :p
829847467894071298 2017-02-09 00:20:28 UTC <icedwater> I agree, but still not the point. :)
829847175093972992 2017-02-09 00:19:19 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter perhaps. But let's see how it works out. Feels counterintuitive.
829839936043962368 2017-02-09 23:50:33 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter have fun. But when you put "business" together with "altruism" something doesn't smell right to me...
829839076450668545 2017-02-09 23:47:08 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 I agree, the club looks weak, but at least the player looks like a good negotiator :)
829838868723535872 2017-02-09 23:46:18 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 looks like a form of fallback in case the overseas deals don't work out...
829838627320369153 2017-02-09 23:45:21 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @mintea do it. Whether you pay for the course or not, the idea is to run through the content once and then keep practicing...
829838000456503296 2017-02-09 23:42:51 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb @GaryKLH wow, where did you hear that from?
829720475089596417 2017-02-09 15:55:51 UTC <icedwater> @medialens and now a poorly insulated orange fork is stuck into the socket, waiting for US to pull out.
829715786344198145 2017-02-09 15:37:13 UTC <icedwater> @sahouraxo @Cernovich I'd like to believe you, but how would we know who is telling the truth?
829713745861488640 2017-02-09 15:29:07 UTC <icedwater> way to derail, dude.
829712142416744449 2017-02-09 15:22:44 UTC <icedwater> @TwitterSafety who defines what is "Sensitive Content"?
829711903626649600 2017-02-09 15:21:47 UTC <icedwater> It's movie time! @internetofshit presents IoT: Days Of Future Past.  Wait, did someone already take that title? #fbpic.twitter.com/GbHheHvtdr
829708601706942465 2017-02-09 15:08:40 UTC <icedwater> @FreedomofPress is it a 120-day ban on emails from servers based in Democratic states, with an indefinite ban on Californian email servers?
829707362629873664 2017-02-09 15:03:45 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos nice work, but it looks like preparing the ground for the 10% GST to come... :P
829682034909995009 2017-02-09 13:23:06 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon @thelocalbigot it's a feedback loop, right...
829487892082814976 2017-02-08 00:31:39 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily difficult line to cross. if they intervene to "help", some things may become justifiable over the years once context is gone.
829348973529796608 2017-02-08 15:19:38 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz nah, why should we pay more than lip service to minority representation? ;)
829344865011904512 2017-02-08 15:03:18 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang also, at least you could use the basic function...
829338761142030338 2017-02-08 14:39:03 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @piersmorgan we shall. When the President of China Congress across as more reasonable...

829289588917149697 2017-02-08 11:23:40 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @JustinTWJ I'm guilty of that. Probably addicted to attention on some level. :)
829289358540861440 2017-02-08 11:22:45 UTC <icedwater> why are you, a foreigner, whining about other foreigners in a country full of descendants of immigrants that you aren't even in?
829288870663553025 2017-02-08 11:20:48 UTC <icedwater> It's a good thing I didn't read this article pre Twitter. @servicedapartment wouldn't have fit most username limits.https://twitter.com/STcom/status/828599748609265664
829216144414355457 2017-02-07 06:31:49 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice let's not call names any more... Sigh
829192157961535488 2017-02-07 04:56:30 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo learn, sure. Don't auto retweet stuff :p @ofmeowandbake
829139918723043328 2017-02-07 01:28:55 UTC <icedwater> @hos_oufi don't let them divide us. Religion is everyone's personal decision. Let's respect each other.
829139633933996034 2017-02-07 01:27:48 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga because non-white countries banning white people was so successful in the fight against colonization... XD
829130554595373056 2017-02-07 00:51:43 UTC <icedwater> From @openexchange: of you don't want your data to end up with the FBI, use @mailbox_org rather than #gmail.https://twitter.com/openexchange/status/828535358178619392
829129183443906560 2017-02-07 00:46:16 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake you, since @whyvo just got a new job :p
829128924844036096 2017-02-07 00:45:14 UTC <icedwater> @A_Goode_Man indeed!
829122876003348480 2017-02-07 00:21:12 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz well they had to pick a date anyway :p
829000004056461312 2017-02-07 16:12:57 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon to be fair, it does look like a regular question :p
828999753442529280 2017-02-07 16:11:57 UTC <icedwater> Oh.https://twitter.com/nerissaClarice/status/828511468068810752
828996840083197952 2017-02-07 16:00:23 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon have you... not heard of rhetorical questions? :P
828994676183044096 2017-02-07 15:51:47 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo also please don't use your new skills for bots like the one that RTed me and is now blocked/muted/reported for spam :P
828992773680308224 2017-02-07 15:44:13 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo if you can afford 3 months off, maybe adding a data science or data analytics cert from general assembly will help...
828987520109064193 2017-02-07 15:23:21 UTC <icedwater> @Irukafishy @hellofrmSG ah welcome back @irukafishy! Hope your first days were fine. I'm about to find out. And thanks @bittymacbeth for the past week.
828986576147357696 2017-02-07 15:19:36 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo happy belated birthday! I'm a day late... hope you had a good one.
828986030669770752 2017-02-07 15:17:26 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess @djpain oh, crap.
828985287304892416 2017-02-07 15:14:28 UTC <icedwater> On how the pig up artists helped influence the current alt-right as well. Hmm.https://twitter.com/morganmpage/status/827905082998009857
828984802015481857 2017-02-07 15:12:33 UTC <icedwater> On how gamer gate and geek culture helped birth the current alt-right movement.. hmmhttps://twitter.com/morganmpage/status/827736361998364673
828982522197336064 2017-02-07 15:03:29 UTC <icedwater> @A_Goode_Man hi troll, why are you accusing others of doing what you do?
828957663773937665 2017-02-07 13:24:42 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon no, I didn't mean it was your quote :) Definitions draw lines around concepts, so inclusion and exclusion is inevitable. Lol
828956760706670592 2017-02-07 13:21:07 UTC <icedwater> OK, but what about wasted energy?pic.twitter.com/5K51Qkkwzo

828933354422611969 2017-02-07 11:48:07 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon don't definitions necessarily include and exclude by drawing boundaries?
828931477328924672 2017-02-07 11:40:39 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch why, may I ask? Avoiding tracking?
828771953632702464 2017-02-06 01:06:46 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose and did it?
828771008840503297 2017-02-06 01:03:00 UTC <icedwater> @AJDinovo put humanity back in the marketplace!
828753658921652224 2017-02-06 23:54:04 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon heh I'll give you a break then :) especially since I'm 2 days behind ;)
828753248710381568 2017-02-06 23:52:26 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon ah right. Just caught it lol. Yellow card for inciting dissent!
828667062910283777 2017-02-06 18:09:58 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon those with privilege may be oblivious, e.g. Marie Antoinette? Still don't see "pretender" relevance. Maybe DMs allow more detail?
828665604500369408 2017-02-06 18:04:10 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon and having labels is not the same as labelling. It's how the labels are used that matters.
828665377521496064 2017-02-06 18:03:16 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon labels are needed to identify problems. "Privilege" is objective, e.g. resume under male name gets reply but female name doesn't.
828664595132805133 2017-02-06 18:00:09 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon what is there to take personally... What is this "footballer pretending" you speak of, though?
828664397727883264 2017-02-06 17:59:22 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon not really. It's a kind of capital accumulation. Like speaking English, Mandarin, looking Chinese are privilege in a job search.
828663933229690880 2017-02-06 17:57:32 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk fascinating. Will see if I can listen in on the commute.
828663690123636737 2017-02-06 17:56:34 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk indeed.
828662617262600192 2017-02-06 17:52:18 UTC <icedwater> @BigCanadianTuna all of it. We fight all of the stupidity. :)
828661224996876288 2017-02-06 17:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I agree that whining gets little accomplished. But who gets to say what is "playing the victim"?
828660544773042176 2017-02-06 17:44:04 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon if you don't like "privilege", you might have it...
828659903489142784 2017-02-06 17:41:31 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon you mean rebels don't have opinions? Or that opinions need not be taken seriously? :P
828602189740257281 2017-02-06 13:52:11 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi so you still got 120GB+ free? :P
828600171793510400 2017-02-06 13:44:10 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily what's your favourite part of the yusheng? I like the fish but have cleaned up excess golden crackers...
828598125405147136 2017-02-06 13:36:02 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk on what basis? :/
828597985378394113 2017-02-06 13:35:28 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk heh, putting stability at risk by provoking the threat 
828594882285445121 2017-02-06 13:23:09 UTC <icedwater> @CidSephtis by the left-behind, you mean?
828564992651780096 2017-02-06 11:24:22 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ @techreview "phone users are about to get much more useful" fixed it ;)
828409817668521984 2017-02-05 01:07:46 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz EY you! Check your minority privilege! #lol
828396273984114688 2017-02-05 00:13:57 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily what a souvenir he'll bring home...
828389697411915776 2017-02-05 23:47:49 UTC <icedwater> antifascism dot org is a honeypot attempting to gather information on #antifa comrades. Dont visit, dont sign up. Copy/paste, do not share.
828220025332903941 2017-02-05 12:33:36 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 possibly 13 for now. But yes.
828182251888185344 2017-02-05 10:03:30 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 but have a good rest, I'm surprised you're up this early. Enjoy your Sunday. :)
828182066999107585 2017-02-05 10:02:46 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769 it's a suspension of the programme for all refugees + any non-resident traveller from those 7 is denied.
828174478802767872 2017-02-05 09:32:37 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 crime was shorthand for violent crime, which includes terrorism... Such as mass shootings by the likes of Dylann Roof?
828174039478734851 2017-02-05 09:30:52 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 most of the recent large attacks have come from long-time residents and not recently-admitted refugees, right?
828173787405299712 2017-02-05 09:29:52 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it's not similar at all...
828173330775633920 2017-02-05 09:28:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it's actually two things, the 7-country thing and the refugee stop... Wait, let me verify.
828173129105104896 2017-02-05 09:27:15 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 you're not comparing the same thing. 120 days is the period of time this 36-month process will be delayed by, isn't it?
828169951416430592 2017-02-05 09:14:37 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 which shouldn't be an issue because it's probably a lower crime rate than any given resident population.
828160484700364801 2017-02-05 08:37:00 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'm saying it has always been done right and doesn't need to be explicitly banned to be fixed.
828160388696903681 2017-02-05 08:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 not suggesting that anywhere - regular screening and admission can continue.
828158950012903424 2017-02-05 08:30:54 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'll read that, thanks...
828158684442218501 2017-02-05 08:29:51 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 even if it had been 200k vs 300m I'd say that's pretty much equivalent to a handful per community. 0.7 refugees per 1000 people?
828145056246755328 2017-02-04 07:35:42 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 https://www.rescue.org/financial-information read this and tell me nothing was spent on refugees...
828141696131035136 2017-02-04 07:22:21 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 https://www.rescue.org/article/how-us-refugee-vetting-and-resettlement-process-really-works
828141582175985664 2017-02-04 07:21:53 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I don't think you can even find the 4-5 attacks in the past few months that you mentioned.
828141029261914112 2017-02-04 07:19:42 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 https://www.ft.com/content/11150514-7e78-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4 though I can't find any proof of the pay to leave scheme you're suggesting yet.
828140289281781761 2017-02-04 07:16:45 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 did he have to, considering refugees were already coming in for years?
828139956602167296 2017-02-04 07:15:26 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 from Financial Times, Sep 19 2016: "Ms Merkel denied that it had been a mistake to offer such a warm welcome to refugees"
828139356762234881 2017-02-04 07:13:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it goes back to why the terrorists exist in the first place - the US is simply enjoying the fruits of its labour over the years.
828139192559423488 2017-02-04 07:12:24 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I see. Well, terrorism and refugees are two different issues which should not be conflated.
828139008513306628 2017-02-04 07:11:40 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 been to Germany to see the situation for yourself? The times I walked the cities there was nothing unusual except a few tents.
828138772873113601 2017-02-04 07:10:44 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I refuse to believe that, given refugees have been steadily entering the US for ages.http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/05/u-s-admits-record-number-of-muslim-refugees-in-2016/
828138215810871296 2017-02-04 07:08:31 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 the thing is, the US were already accepting refugees before. It's not like the systems and accommodation weren't in place.
828136855530921984 2017-02-04 07:03:07 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 not the Germans I've been speaking with every other day...
828129416878305281 2017-02-04 06:33:33 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 have you been?
828129394589732864 2017-02-04 06:33:28 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 they have to follow the laws. People responsible for taking care of them need to make sure they learn. As with other immigrants.
828128887502565376 2017-02-04 06:31:27 UTC <icedwater> @gaqzi yeah indeed.
828128843038724097 2017-02-04 06:31:16 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it's already been settled a long time ago, nothing is being rushed, is it?
828128720980303872 2017-02-04 06:30:47 UTC <icedwater> @gaqzi sure :)
828128653640806400 2017-02-04 06:30:31 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 yep but you don't have to ban people from entering the house until it's set up.
828128543137689600 2017-02-04 06:30:05 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 per year? That's a lot. But we could probably spare that much for 5000 refugees. Where do you get that figure from by the way?
828128290116284416 2017-02-04 06:29:04 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 vastly different situations, mind.
828128068841594884 2017-02-04 06:28:12 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 did I say that?
828127958174806020 2017-02-04 06:27:45 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 why don't you ask the Germans? They have had considerable success with their refugees. Very few incidents given their numbers.
828061479278514176 2017-02-04 02:03:35 UTC <icedwater> @gaqzi depth vs breadth eh? Which did you pick in the end?
828061258339360771 2017-02-04 02:02:43 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @Hopeily for the perspective on polygamy in Muslim culture. As always, theory and practice differ :phttps://twitter.com/Hopeily/status/827525542593171458
828050658032918528 2017-02-04 01:20:35 UTC <icedwater> @mitchellvii that's quite a large straw man you have there. Or a sense of humour. Can't decide which. @neiljhk
828047034556911618 2017-02-04 01:06:12 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 again, phrasing matters. Checking again is fine. But why ban?
828046857414668290 2017-02-04 01:05:29 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 that's a messy generalization; also, it's not possible to educate refugees on all the laws of that country before letting them in
828046575842652161 2017-02-04 01:04:22 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 yes. And the nonsense would stop. Plus 5k is a manageable number, I think. Although we should have helped Rohingya first.
828046241078534146 2017-02-04 01:03:02 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 then there doesn't need to be a ban. Just advise those whose cases are under review that they have to wait a little longer.
828046079329394689 2017-02-04 01:02:24 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 there shouldn't be a ban, temporary or otherwise.
828045726173138944 2017-02-04 01:01:00 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 no, of course not. Checks can and must be performed.
828042312433274880 2017-02-04 00:47:26 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @ezlusztig "rampaging bull damaging the diplomatic china" is pretty much already accomplished by @realdonaldTrump regardless of any leaks.
828041682935361536 2017-02-04 00:44:56 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 similarly, I wouldn't expect you to defend the US' official stance either, but you're free to have an opinion on it, right?
828041332480307200 2017-02-04 00:43:32 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 sure, every country has the right to deny. It just looks a lot less justifiable for the US than for Singapore.
828040884268593153 2017-02-04 00:41:45 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 you definitely have room. Even we have room. I don't like my government's decision, we can probably handle say, 5k refugees.
828040377768697856 2017-02-04 00:39:44 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'm not representative of Singapore's official stance in any way. If I had the means to help a refugee personally? I would.
827904833218686976 2017-02-04 15:41:08 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump CC @realdonaldtrumphttps://twitter.com/warriorfema6/status/827871284415647744
827896956697448448 2017-02-04 15:09:50 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz rofl
827896543785086977 2017-02-04 15:08:12 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon eh, if we're on pedantic pledge analysis mode, happiness and prosperity are the fruits of the democratic society, not its roots.
827895058565197824 2017-02-04 15:02:18 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon this isn't a preference a minority can afford to have, though. A lot of the "seeing as" gets done for them. @ladystormhold
827892575939891201 2017-02-04 14:52:26 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon @ladystormhold I think we're agreeing that vegetables are important but debating on broccoli vs cauliflower...
827892274402975746 2017-02-04 14:51:14 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @dcatdemon prerequisite for a democratic society as per the pledge. But that phrasing  doesn't preclude it being a right.
827891759854215168 2017-02-04 14:49:11 UTC <icedwater> @sgelection @KenJeyaretnam yes, as I'm no rocket scientist. Also, I don't handle self-contradiction well.
827879296190406656 2017-02-04 13:59:40 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon most of the time, statements of endured inequity in a whispered tone or on other channels can sound like whining :)
827877317099737089 2017-02-04 13:51:48 UTC <icedwater> It is our business to deal with racists. :)https://twitter.com/joelynalexandra/status/827464316064456704
827876739229421569 2017-02-04 13:49:30 UTC <icedwater> Oddly enough, the British made a lazy jump to that conclusion...https://twitter.com/nerissaClarice/status/827470394131050496
827876266208481281 2017-02-04 13:47:37 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon yes, but when you grow up with "regardless of race, language or religion", then there are certain expectations.
827874542387240960 2017-02-04 13:40:46 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk looks like we should be donating to @snopes instead of discrediting it :)
827873689844609024 2017-02-04 13:37:23 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon isn't the "whiner" typically already a minority??
827859021633687552 2017-02-04 12:39:06 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @iamthekang well it's not up to us to say "that's the good kind of minority" and I'm sure @mdzulkar9 isn't asking us for it
827858366961577985 2017-02-04 12:36:30 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 besides, the world has long operated on "do as I say, not as I do" ;)
827858255401594880 2017-02-04 12:36:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it's been our stand for a long time. As much as I hate it, it seems justifiable.
827857598778994691 2017-02-04 12:33:27 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I think you ought to know how large Singapore is in comparison to, say, Kansas City, Boulder, or San Francisco.
827820635342508033 2017-02-04 10:06:34 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 so intervention has had no positive effect.
827820481264775169 2017-02-04 10:05:57 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname maybe. I'm not too fond of conspiracy theories though.
827820203329204228 2017-02-04 10:04:51 UTC <icedwater> @BreitbartNews @Doctor_Damocles @neiljhk nope. I meant that the objection to his speaking at Berkeley was based on his past speeches.
827729736977702912 2017-02-03 04:05:22 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 it stops when people pull out and don't interfere any more.
827722922613633024 2017-02-03 03:38:17 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 meh. Intervention will stop this threat but give rise to the next. That's why there was Al-Qaeda after the 80s...
827722654459179009 2017-02-03 03:37:13 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 that's a bit simplistic I suppose, but to be expected given the polarization of politics there.
827722471465889794 2017-02-03 03:36:30 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 damned if you do, damned if you don't, I guess...
827722167836041217 2017-02-03 03:35:17 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'm not saying it's useless. I'm saying I don't like it. :P
827713055085563904 2017-02-03 02:59:05 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @Hopeily was it the first script that Malay used?
827712482156253184 2017-02-03 02:56:48 UTC <icedwater> @BreitbartNews @Doctor_Damocles @neiljhk Milo has had free speech. This is the reaction to what he'd said.
827705997800071168 2017-02-03 02:31:02 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 was it, really?
827705760838594560 2017-02-03 02:30:06 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 "under Obama"? I think you're a few Presidents too late for that..
827705665858572288 2017-02-03 02:29:43 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 that's because you've positioned yourselves that way for decades. Without, might I add, solving your own problems first ;)
827705449814200321 2017-02-03 02:28:51 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 for sure. I've been up to the bar once or twice, it was an excellent view :)
827705289742839808 2017-02-03 02:28:13 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I've never liked it here. Don't understand that sport... And it closes public roads for weeks too :p But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
827705090802724864 2017-02-03 02:27:26 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi yep. But room service was unlimited when I went. My brother kept ordering the steak sandwich like 3 times a day 
827695971001733120 2017-02-03 01:51:11 UTC <icedwater> @avalon you all right? Man. I'm always so lagging on Twitter..
827690094072991744 2017-02-03 01:27:50 UTC <icedwater> @ianpaulwright everyone has the right to say what they want. They just have to be aware not everyone wants to listen.
827689623895699462 2017-02-03 01:25:58 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @ArvinTunas 5th is last day. I'm going to check out the rest of the hawker centre...
827688400274673664 2017-02-03 01:21:06 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @IQuitSugar do that after you buy it, right, not at the supermarket where you'll be flicking off everybody's avocados to buy one?
827687954487267328 2017-02-03 01:19:20 UTC <icedwater> @TODAYonline why does this even need to be asked?
827687769962995712 2017-02-03 01:18:36 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter it could be Spinelli's.
827686523508125696 2017-02-03 01:13:39 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi meh. I'm late. But I like cruises. Just not when they're some expensive :p
827686326463975424 2017-02-03 01:12:52 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz wut
827685907960524800 2017-02-03 01:11:12 UTC <icedwater> @BreitbartNews @neiljhk @Doctor_Damocles oh, should public schools receive less funding then?
827684809644216321 2017-02-03 01:06:50 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya oh, for some reason I read your tweet as "rising Dem star, but look at what she just did." :P
827681201037021185 2017-02-03 00:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @brocklesnarWWE @sleaguepipebomb that means he's twice as good as the ONE in 21-1... @brocklesnarwwe
827679841767940096 2017-02-03 00:47:06 UTC <icedwater> @sgelection I don't understand @KenJeyaretnam complaining about MPs "outing" B and the auntie, then doing it again himself.
827678720471097344 2017-02-03 00:42:39 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 yeah though it shouldn't be the case.
827678602502119424 2017-02-03 00:42:11 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 where and when, though?
827678481437691904 2017-02-03 00:41:42 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 the US is not the world, and I don't think either of these statements is justified...
827674796372615168 2017-02-03 00:27:03 UTC <icedwater> Incredible.https://twitter.com/jason_howerton/status/827283446749761536
827528338663055364 2017-02-03 14:45:05 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I remember watching Killer Lifts as a kid and sometimes I still have one hand on the rails in case the floor opens up :p
827474779678482433 2017-02-03 11:12:15 UTC <icedwater> @DVATW so much for tolerance eh.
827449396241457152 2017-02-03 09:31:23 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane I read that as rainbow bangles and wondered why you would be wearing sugary stuff :p
827444491242004481 2017-02-03 09:11:54 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue @lackadaisygirl Mittag/essen is lunch and Abend/essen dinner. Nach/tisch is dessert and Danke is thanks :) / marks word joints.
827433880567238656 2017-02-03 08:29:44 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'm pretty sure Trump is not a perfect nut, but I do feel the US might become less safe because of what he's doing.
827433457517105152 2017-02-03 08:28:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 headlines are short and can be misleading. It's not 100% above board, but I see your point.
827433203031871488 2017-02-03 08:27:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 they should have vetted Trump. He might yet get thousands killed...
827432997846605824 2017-02-03 08:26:14 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I use the word report loosely, as it seems to be a sort of official statement from the IATA, not a news article. Still checking.
827431015836639233 2017-02-03 08:18:21 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 the article needs further verification, but I'm inclined to believe it because I couldn't find any executive orders for the case.
827395812485328896 2017-02-02 05:58:28 UTC <icedwater> @JeeSayTan interesting... Let's find out more about the methodology as well :)
827391065233592320 2017-02-02 05:39:36 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I am trying to find out if it was official policy or if individual travellers had been refused, and if possible, why.
827390928960655360 2017-02-02 05:39:04 UTC <icedwater> .@daveaps39 OK I've found it: on Wikipedia it's http://enwp.org/Visa_policy_of_Singapore, added a year ago, based on a report from https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?Fulltext=1&COUNTRY=SG&SECTION=PA&SUBSECTION=00&USER=KLMB2C&subuser=KLMB2C
827384568181198849 2017-02-02 05:13:47 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 uh huh, OK... I don't know about that, but it's an article I found. @USATODAY
827384412828426240 2017-02-02 05:13:10 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 this is an arrest made *after* the ban was put in place. I suppose that shows some kind of foresight, if the case is legitimate.
827381931671056386 2017-02-02 05:03:19 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 that's why I need the source to verify if that actually happened and the details on the so-called ban...
827381755778736128 2017-02-02 05:02:37 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I was looking at the current immigration authority website, so I would trust that over Wikipedia.
827381546688483331 2017-02-02 05:01:47 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 thanks. Also, here's something about the comparison to Obama's 2011 action:http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/30/fact-check-trump-refugee-policy-comparison-obama/97247418/
827379783075901442 2017-02-02 04:54:46 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 still searching, still haven't found it. I need to confirm the source for those lines.
827364805673562112 2017-02-02 03:55:16 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 Iraq and Kosovo are in the Category II section, though.
827363919765217283 2017-02-02 03:51:44 UTC <icedwater> @ezlusztig but what about the Roma, the homosexuals, and the political prisoners who were also thrown there? Can't recall the proportions...
827361132713160704 2017-02-02 03:40:40 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 I'm still trying to verify the screenshot you showed, actually. Do you have the link?
827357799415820288 2017-02-02 03:27:25 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 removing them from a visa waiver program is not the same as revoking entry or ordering them back. They just have to apply.
827354472338780161 2017-02-02 03:14:12 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 also, why do you think I'm reading news online (and therefore have more access to US news?)
827351901993791488 2017-02-02 03:03:59 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 don't worry about us, we are working on it :) that doesn't mean we can't interfere like the US always does anyway :)
827326858903433218 2017-02-02 01:24:28 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 rubbish. Everyone has a right to question everything.
827326607446519808 2017-02-02 01:23:28 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 well played. My fault for not clicking through. Doesn't validate the rest of your scattershot claims though :)
827324785059192832 2017-02-02 01:16:14 UTC <icedwater> @ezlusztig @clamatoes I'd like to know too.
827310123890593792 2017-02-02 00:17:58 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 have fun trolling though :)
827309979426136064 2017-02-02 00:17:24 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 simply untrue. https://www.ica.gov.sg/services_centre_overview.aspx?pageid=252 do you need English lessons? @MrAyeDee
827154000625569792 2017-02-02 13:57:36 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG how far is the dorm from the classrooms and stuff? It's on campus, right?
827132375054241792 2017-02-02 12:31:40 UTC <icedwater> Does anyone know the significance of this? I don't quite understand.https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/826989984288800770
827129432036892672 2017-02-02 12:19:58 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya don't get it. How does this contradict?
827125688989675526 2017-02-02 12:05:06 UTC <icedwater> @daveaps39 a temp ban is a ban. And I was asking @MrAyeDee about their eligibility for said ban.
827036371667726337 2017-02-01 06:10:11 UTC <icedwater> @MrAyeDee just curious, are you from one of the states covered in the #MuslimBan, or a green card holder?
827035237364281344 2017-02-01 06:05:40 UTC <icedwater> @Reality_hurts51 sad that you think black people, if selected, have no merits of their own and are only there to fulfill a quota.
826956869566488576 2017-02-01 00:54:16 UTC <icedwater> @Nigel_Farage @neiljhk the EU member states have, I'm pretty sure.
826948140280393728 2017-02-01 00:19:35 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Nigel_Farage perhaps this might be why? "President Trumps actions are unacceptable for a liberal, open democracy, like America"
826839616024043522 2017-02-01 17:08:21 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose thanks for the reminder. I'll just use those to charge my power bank from now on :p
826837144219979776 2017-02-01 16:58:31 UTC <icedwater> @NishyChubss I find it a lot better than dying in Yishun tbh
826820016280526850 2017-02-01 15:50:28 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi you think?! :P @ClandestineYeo
826722720847060993 2017-02-01 09:23:51 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog @joanna_jane I was mildly concerned about others when you first replied. But trolls will take it literally anyway.
826722258991280132 2017-02-01 09:22:00 UTC <icedwater> Hope this makes it in time for the end of today!https://twitter.com/VictoriaMahoney/status/826457431366590472
826700061924958208 2017-01-31 07:53:48 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane @theyishusblog it's OK. Same phenomenon with homophones across languages. Bo pian.
826699110610644993 2017-01-31 07:50:01 UTC <icedwater> @jk_rowling already burning. Thanks for the entertainment! (Via @mdzulkar9)
826698747182665728 2017-01-31 07:48:35 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy I agree, but engaging helps to understand their train of thought or hear their anger, sometimes...
826698168314126336 2017-01-31 07:46:17 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane thanks @theyishusblog. I am not emoji literate. :P  is an angry face on Android Twitter but cheesy grin on WhatsApp...
826697642482601984 2017-01-31 07:44:11 UTC <icedwater> We have to stop the zoom before the US goes boom. Thanks @sarahkendzior. What can we non-USers do?https://twitter.com/sarahkendzior/status/826279776805670912
826696866708365312 2017-01-31 07:41:06 UTC <icedwater> @k_dani12 and a*
826691214686642177 2017-01-31 07:18:39 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane @marceldirsus indeed. It's been destroyed by the Muslims. ;\
826687638505611265 2017-01-31 07:04:26 UTC <icedwater> @RedHotSquirrel good point, but how much of these nations' GDP is thanks to trade with the single market? @neiljhk
826686685836480512 2017-01-31 07:00:39 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA good thing! They managed to #stopthebear.
826675489909600257 2017-01-31 06:16:10 UTC <icedwater> @ViveCharlieMag that's a terrible allegation. Has the investigation concluded? @neiljhk
826611245730050048 2017-01-31 02:00:53 UTC <icedwater> Interesting.https://twitter.com/very_grem/status/826435655068585984
826609406305382400 2017-01-31 01:53:34 UTC <icedwater> @JeeSayTan can high growth rates really be sustained even in developed countries?
826606318488215552 2017-01-31 01:41:18 UTC <icedwater> Looking forward to this! Gotta be careful not to condescend as well when making cultural assumptions, even jokingly.https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose/status/826346758267629568
826597809654673409 2017-01-31 01:07:29 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart @blackadlerqueen @theyishusblog Yishun G.
826578251963183104 2017-01-31 23:49:47 UTC <icedwater> @_Makada_ @neiljhk *whose* establishment's MSM? Not much condemnation here in Singapore.
826577993518575617 2017-01-31 23:48:45 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic don't worry, he'll about those down soon enough.
826428700346376196 2017-01-31 13:55:31 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @_Makada_ *whose* MSM?
826428289979801601 2017-01-31 13:53:53 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail @hahaHariz omg that apostrophe though! It's a pain!
826426754222809088 2017-01-31 13:47:47 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter is that why Forbes covered the #royalrumble? Lol!
826426027639320576 2017-01-31 13:44:53 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @ofmeowandbake that's fine. I'll try to go on the weekend heh
826408960743714816 2017-01-31 12:37:04 UTC <icedwater> @akokitamura @dwu00 are you already following @AkoKitamura for Japanese tips and quizzes? :)
826407982363664386 2017-01-31 12:33:11 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily Sally Yates.
826406620213022720 2017-01-31 12:27:46 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @JuriaTRM that's OK, I just want to go to the place. I haven't tried HBB either :p
826402579206639616 2017-01-31 12:11:43 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @ofmeowandbake let's go on Thursday?
826402479206076416 2017-01-31 12:11:19 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM thanks. :(
826368521164640257 2017-01-31 09:56:23 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM the mall's bought over, but did they confirm the hawker centre is closing?
826232013778620416 2017-01-30 00:53:57 UTC <icedwater> @wselak didn't understand that. Could you clarify please? Who's best in the middle East?
826231899819421696 2017-01-30 00:53:30 UTC <icedwater> @wselak they called terrorists Ali Baba? Cute :p
826228128578048000 2017-01-30 00:38:31 UTC <icedwater> @wselak we should probably be a little more concerned, to be honest.
826225097446871040 2017-01-30 00:26:28 UTC <icedwater> @wselak familiarity and trust among neighbours.
826222276257292291 2017-01-30 00:15:15 UTC <icedwater> @wselak Iraq in 2005 was far less stable than the US is in 2017... So far.
826222147508908032 2017-01-30 00:14:45 UTC <icedwater> @wselak this can be avoided.
826222106245337088 2017-01-30 00:14:35 UTC <icedwater> @wselak this should be the norm.
826221945695805440 2017-01-30 00:13:56 UTC <icedwater> sure.
826220272323698688 2017-01-30 00:07:18 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @piersmorgan because debating @realDonaldTrump with fact and logic worked so well already.
826218509981986816 2017-01-30 00:00:17 UTC <icedwater> @ro3041 if they can't change their own governments, wouldn't any campaigning for change overseas be impotent? @neiljhk @NCPoliticsUK
826218214367469568 2017-01-30 23:59:07 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @NCPoliticsUK isn't this only for Westminster? Is either of those petitions online, though?
826215907382812672 2017-01-30 23:49:57 UTC <icedwater> @wselak again, points for a vivid imagination.
826212087714115584 2017-01-30 23:34:46 UTC <icedwater> get rid of bigotry 2017.
826211951625646085 2017-01-30 23:34:14 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 we still have time :)
826211792800002048 2017-01-30 23:33:36 UTC <icedwater> @solarpapst @wselak but will you bring up irrelevant emotive points?
826211203303084032 2017-01-30 23:31:15 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz how does that not affect science though?
826209949839601664 2017-01-30 23:26:16 UTC <icedwater> @GourmetHipster won't deny he said what he said, and he was a wise man, but that doesn't make everything he said right. @neiljhk @katiezez
826067756470525952 2017-01-30 14:01:15 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @FastCoExist so there's this tweet from @girlposts. pic.twitter.com/OYOmNVnx6t On the other hand: https://youtu.be/E2evC2xTNWg
826067320514637824 2017-01-30 13:59:31 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake US I guess? Wherever he's giving talks xD
826067114129633281 2017-01-30 13:58:42 UTC <icedwater> @washingtonpost @katiezez @neiljhk @GourmetHipster also untrue, and we've been a few generations. Thanks for your condescension :)
826062062954483712 2017-01-30 13:38:37 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl congradulations
826061004966465536 2017-01-30 13:34:25 UTC <icedwater> Unfortunately beyond my means to verify, but it's an excessive, scary screening. Let's hope it's reversed #fbhttps://twitter.com/afterwords_wine/status/826015136833875968
826059638202257415 2017-01-30 13:28:59 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake aiyoh. Thought you can go autograph hunting.
826057706079297537 2017-01-30 13:21:19 UTC <icedwater> and what about Europe? They're not banning immigrants.
826057559253479426 2017-01-30 13:20:44 UTC <icedwater> Terror attacks on US soil since 9/11 have been carried out by US citizens/legal residents, not visa holders/refugeeshttps://twitter.com/danWorthington/status/826003447967207425

826055487254777856 2017-01-30 13:12:30 UTC <icedwater> @AriffO2 I was going to check how much support Kirsten Tan got, but it looks like @ariffO2 needs recognition... Persistence!pic.twitter.com/ogII0I6qaF
826053497791524866 2017-01-30 13:04:35 UTC <icedwater> @ChicagoBlaze1 statistically, that should be the case. But that doesn't make @maryedozie14's statement invalid.
826052870910783488 2017-01-30 13:02:06 UTC <icedwater> @Starbucks @neiljhk won't know until they try.
826044837648404480 2017-01-30 12:30:11 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk doing the right thing may be virtue signalling, but at least the right thing is done. Hope it's a step towards a real solution.
826044505233072128 2017-01-30 12:28:51 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I agree, but if @Starbucks really does hire them, isn't that a good thing?
826044365873176576 2017-01-30 12:28:18 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk uh huh.
826043653319598081 2017-01-30 12:25:28 UTC <icedwater> I wanted to tweet the speeches of the guest of honour, Minister K. Shanmugam, and others. But I had a good conversation instead. #CNY2017
826041517068279808 2017-01-30 12:16:59 UTC <icedwater> Thanks for the long thread, @nktpnd. Hope this nightmare passes soon. Thanks also to @singnoname for the RT.https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/825468986817142784
826038141303676928 2017-01-30 12:03:34 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @MyBookJacket I think it's just adding a language to the GBoard in settings? Toggle the switch.pic.twitter.com/4SW11raHv6
826036172124086272 2017-01-30 11:55:45 UTC <icedwater> @yrrabb2 lol.
826035544119324672 2017-01-30 11:53:15 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz exactly. Even if the admission rate might be low, it's not an outright ban...
826034502355058688 2017-01-30 11:49:06 UTC <icedwater> @washingtonpost @katiezez @neiljhk @GourmetHipster come look at Singapore, we're "destroyed" by our Muslim population.
826034187123568640 2017-01-30 11:47:51 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I'm pretty sure @Starbucks can find more than that number of employable refugees.
826024589138341888 2017-01-30 11:09:43 UTC <icedwater> There were traditional crafts on display: paper cuttings, mini clogs, calligraphy, and ding ding tang. #CNY2017pic.twitter.com/R9uFzq2kWp
826011869416599552 2017-01-30 10:19:10 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz but it still isn't a ban, right.
826011613018722304 2017-01-30 10:18:09 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah ooh it's on my to read list. Just jumped up a few ranks. I agree it's not easy but I think it's very possible with effort.
825942688377626624 2017-01-29 05:44:16 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue and so it is
825942140307992576 2017-01-29 05:42:06 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 or as and when you feel fit :p
825941841346383872 2017-01-29 05:40:54 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty completely forgot about this and overslept half the PPV anyway... Whee!
825940584627990528 2017-01-29 05:35:55 UTC <icedwater> @RitaPanahi have you tried to enter recently, though? I hope you're not affected by the #MuslimBan
825907737745698816 2017-01-29 03:25:23 UTC <icedwater> Here at the SFCCA Spring Reception. Registration done soon. #CNY2017pic.twitter.com/sAhv2CZmlk
825890861095407617 2017-01-29 02:18:20 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I am guessing @pwnage314 means birth control.
825888850803200000 2017-01-29 02:10:20 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue is that a pretty old film with... Ewan McGregor and Clive Owen and I think Natalie Portman?
825769120851390464 2017-01-29 18:14:35 UTC <icedwater> @wselak well, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Let me see what you have there...
825768839845552128 2017-01-29 18:13:28 UTC <icedwater> sorry to have bothered you. I was looking for an absurdity to fight and should have replied to that egg alone.
825768243298119680 2017-01-29 18:11:05 UTC <icedwater> which German suburb might this be, and which sites have called it "no-go"?
825765428261588992 2017-01-29 17:59:54 UTC <icedwater> @EducatedVoter_ @wselak what in the world is even "cultural Marxism"?
825764477664690176 2017-01-29 17:56:08 UTC <icedwater> @wselak that was hardly my point :)
825735376757141504 2017-01-29 16:00:29 UTC <icedwater> .@wselak @DalekkggsRoll @AntonWSJ hahahahaha white people from "no go zones"
825710613858881536 2017-01-29 14:22:05 UTC <icedwater> @madmilker gotta make sure there's no ugly stains on it, eh ;)
825709815947161600 2017-01-29 14:18:55 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz OK lah :p
825708464538165250 2017-01-29 14:13:33 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz #ownselfpromoteownself
825698558045065217 2017-01-29 13:34:11 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA wah. Then congrats on making the finals in the first place wor :p
825697625047339008 2017-01-29 13:30:29 UTC <icedwater> @madmilker but courtesy dictates I thank you for at least the census link which I might find handy at some point.
825697024708259841 2017-01-29 13:28:06 UTC <icedwater> @madmilker your previous irrelevant statement remains incomplete. Link dumping is not an argument. But here, have my internet points.
825693235699814401 2017-01-29 13:13:02 UTC <icedwater> @madmilker apparently so, in your mind. I'll leave it at that. Good day.
825690813631860737 2017-01-29 13:03:25 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA when is your cup final? What about open top bus tour with the trophy?
825690593053470721 2017-01-29 13:02:32 UTC <icedwater> "destroyed"
825690420218720256 2017-01-29 13:01:51 UTC <icedwater> @NoobieNewb it's not your fault you don't speak @MrMHines dialect :)
825689984006909952 2017-01-29 13:00:07 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner cny?
825680842882060288 2017-01-29 12:23:48 UTC <icedwater> peace loving subtweeter.
825678792744005632 2017-01-29 12:15:39 UTC <icedwater> nope. There is no excusing @Pericles216.
825652132011335681 2017-01-29 10:29:42 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon lol probably ah!
825646823456903172 2017-01-29 10:08:37 UTC <icedwater> Twitter fights.
825642592847081473 2017-01-29 09:51:48 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 thanks for your time.
825627828343304192 2017-01-29 08:53:08 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline maybe next time you can make SPW a family thing :)
825627715231289344 2017-01-29 08:52:41 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 I'm looking for data to back up the Hillary claim, I'm not disputing these consequences yet.
825620793358905344 2017-01-29 08:25:11 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo oops heh
825620531374284801 2017-01-29 08:24:08 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 I'm also not sure Trump isn't about to do the same...
825620357134458881 2017-01-29 08:23:27 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane of course it is, we're all evolved from sea bacteria.
825619863133581313 2017-01-29 08:21:29 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane @abcdpple @RedDot_Oz @ladystormhold not saying the article is the best. But it is an alternative view posing longer term issues
825619521582964741 2017-01-29 08:20:07 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 he's not about to make it better, I think...
825618021813063680 2017-01-29 08:14:10 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah could be because supply chain cost went up also, since the farmers and workers are on holiday...
825617361617113088 2017-01-29 08:11:32 UTC <icedwater> well I think if we ever got round to solving that problem, yelling would become like 95% less necessary...
825616207642447872 2017-01-29 08:06:57 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane wah. This one lagi best.
825615772823089152 2017-01-29 08:05:14 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @dk that makes it 198 years since we were a Raffles Institution. *folds arms*
825614791947345921 2017-01-29 08:01:20 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @kixes omg the malls
825614562372128768 2017-01-29 08:00:25 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline do you also watch WWE, or just your kid? :P
825614394784575488 2017-01-28 07:59:45 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @kixes I wonder what would happen if construction firms could be persuaded that refugees are much cheaper and more exploitable
825612903566880768 2017-01-28 07:53:50 UTC <icedwater> @SheriffClarke uh. He was shoved aside. Much like a phone zombie on a busy sidewalk... Would that be assault too?
825611530032996356 2017-01-28 07:48:22 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 that's a huge range, though.
825611477767720964 2017-01-28 07:48:10 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 I meant some form of contract where the assimilated refugee repays society.
825611364655779841 2017-01-28 07:47:43 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 I'm not asking you personally to fork out all that money. Nobody is. That high tax rate sucks, though.
825610957892186112 2017-01-28 07:46:06 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 you coming to my house is different from refugee status that takes two years to be approved... And yes. Not much, but I would.
825610629717204992 2017-01-28 07:44:47 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 if they're accepted refugees. But it's not up to me to say how many should be accepted. Some form of repayment must be made.
825609944414052352 2017-01-28 07:42:04 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi need to discuss lah. As long as everyone involved can keep it civil, discussion is good. Hiding under the carpet also no point.
825606702921715713 2017-01-28 07:29:11 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz damn it. I'm already caught up to same day on the time line and still I'm behind you :p @abcdpple @joanna_jane
825606514698170370 2017-01-28 07:28:26 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple I suppose temporary container dorms could be built, but again, that article above does point out the other evolving aspects.
825600987033276416 2017-01-28 07:06:28 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 deliver and care for the mother and child, I meant.
825598405934141440 2017-01-28 06:56:13 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo they are pro-life. They just feel they also get to choose pro-whose life.
825597878471053313 2017-01-28 06:54:07 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 you deserve help too, but they shouldn't be denied... I'm sorry you have to go through this.
825597640335200257 2017-01-28 06:53:10 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 let me try to verify that... It's hard to believe. Does it cost 50,000 to deliver for a baby?
825597193222393856 2017-01-28 06:51:24 UTC <icedwater> @madmilker complete your thought, please?
825593009630650369 2017-01-28 06:34:46 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 also, that's good to know. They'll need all the help they can get until they can get jobs to contribute.
825592872678223872 2017-01-28 06:34:14 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 I see. Thanks for the information.
825475439464374273 2017-01-28 22:47:36 UTC <icedwater> @nytimes @madmilker @amichetti your friendly neighbourhood white co-worker can become a racist at any time. Ask Twitter.
825473356862418944 2017-01-28 22:39:19 UTC <icedwater> @Didiseverns2 what free stuff are they getting, may I ask?
825472664080773121 2017-01-28 22:36:34 UTC <icedwater> @ProPublica Refugees already go through rigorous vetting. It's been enough so far; banning is unnecessary. Thanks @propublica.https://twitter.com/ProPublica/status/824763552363839490
825361212011532288 2017-01-28 15:13:42 UTC <icedwater> @kwontrollable :p she's already admitted to exaggerating for effect, oh well... Let's not minimise discrimination though :)
825349338557657090 2017-01-28 14:26:31 UTC <icedwater> @kwontrollable ya lah. That one also a bit irresponsible but we as majority need to remain mindful also.
825347186296647682 2017-01-28 14:17:58 UTC <icedwater> @kwontrollable you know it's not 95% - yet - and this isn't the time to exaggerate for effect.
825347030067224576 2017-01-28 14:17:20 UTC <icedwater> @kwontrollable you can't plan for everything in advance. Be reasonable.
825346095114919937 2017-01-28 14:13:37 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh @sarahcoldheart she also beat Thaibarian and some other guy, I think maybe Sergeant Nyc, in a triple threat match a long time ago.
825198685134876672 2017-01-27 04:27:52 UTC <icedwater> @RetractionWatch "big science" has a buzzword problem, too...
825168310329233409 2017-01-27 02:27:10 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname obviously.
825008760661827586 2017-01-27 15:53:11 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon you'd typically be ahead of me, I'm almost always two days behind. No prizes for guessing why I'm up to date now... :P

824911298060120064 2017-01-27 09:25:54 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz it matters who uses it laaaa.

824901458147422208 2017-01-27 08:46:48 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline @BeirutiBrit best part is he's using the POTUS account to retweet the RDT one. Just ignore as far as possible lah.
824901320666607616 2017-01-27 08:46:15 UTC <icedwater> @SrimathiCeline who cares? Let him have his fun before he gets impeached..
824900780553445377 2017-01-27 08:44:06 UTC <icedwater> @StacyOnTheRight @neiljhk nope, it's easier to prod sanctimonious know-it-alls who will Google for you. "Got proof?" Was more efficient.
824898396959879168 2017-01-27 08:34:38 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StacyOnTheRight got proof?
824861653745348613 2017-01-26 06:08:38 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @smiffy think I need to shut down this Twitter thing that I just logged in to. @realdonaldTrump
824860491172323331 2017-01-26 06:04:00 UTC <icedwater> good, that sounds like it's not a serious problem. Hope it doesn't recur.

824253847388332032 2017-01-25 13:53:25 UTC <icedwater> I wonder why these #climate tweets were deleted and how far these RTs can go :)pic.twitter.com/rJKRjxOR1R
824205767699939328 2017-01-25 10:42:22 UTC <icedwater> @SarahPalinUSA that's terrible. Aren't native American rights also human rights?
824199989999964160 2017-01-25 10:19:25 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump Sign of what will be happening bigly over the next 4 years. @POTUS retweets petty @realdonaldtrump tweets #fbhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/823937981115486208

824107104369680384 2017-01-24 04:10:19 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad I will never understand why you had to ask if the OP was a trans woman. You're right. Enjoy the rest of your life.
824106085455831040 2017-01-24 04:06:16 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi sleped = slept. Only one is correct. Same with slapped = slapt 
824066757060988929 2017-01-24 01:29:59 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad I am a human. Trans status does not matter for the OP's comment.
824061468702167040 2017-01-24 01:08:59 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @heysayfey @kosherjellyfish ooo then never mind. That's for this semester only?
824052896643698688 2017-01-24 00:34:55 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl heh only one non-Chinese was interviewed...
824051770917687298 2017-01-24 00:30:26 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi yes. Don't use iPhone.

824048067854729216 2017-01-24 00:15:44 UTC <icedwater> #TIL "median multiple" - wonder if that metric can be further refined across housing classes. https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/823758156073271296
824046316053405696 2017-01-24 00:08:46 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl that's a crepe joke. You should say sari.

823915952521678848 2017-01-24 15:30:45 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake wah I where got. Only that time kaypoh US election nia. @singnoname @heysayfey @kosherjellyfish @bargeboards
823915679711535104 2017-01-24 15:29:40 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @ofmeowandbake nope. Assembling second team.
823913081126277120 2017-01-24 15:19:20 UTC <icedwater> @PhrenicFox we're not discussing anything, you're just copying and pasting your stump speech here.
823912837126889473 2017-01-24 15:18:22 UTC <icedwater> @heysayfey @singnoname @kosherjellyfish that's what they always say. You confirm can find something to contribute one.
823910956157673472 2017-01-24 15:10:54 UTC <icedwater> @PhrenicFox meh. Which ideas can't be abused politically?

823897050731319296 2017-01-24 14:15:38 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG purposely use pineapple-shaped Chinese characters some more :p
823885073904566273 2017-01-24 13:28:03 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad what does OP being trans or not have to do with their comment? That is and has been my main point.
823838844524974080 2017-01-24 10:24:21 UTC <icedwater> @frhn Roger.
823822981210128384 2017-01-24 09:21:19 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad one good turn deserves another. You only need to be human to know that their being trans or not has no beaing on human decency
823778477664915457 2017-01-23 06:24:28 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 you won't be obliged to. The trivia and the fun are the main thing.
823770002289328129 2017-01-23 05:50:48 UTC <icedwater> @PhrenicFox sure. Why not get a tech guy and lawyers give advice though?
823768475260723200 2017-01-23 05:44:44 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue might you be interested in #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday?
823768426183200768 2017-01-23 05:44:32 UTC <icedwater> @frhn hi, might you be interested in #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday?
823768361557340160 2017-01-23 05:44:16 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 might you be interested in #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday?
823735807059972096 2017-01-23 03:34:55 UTC <icedwater> @yuejie1994 would you like to check out #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday? I've set up a second team just in case.
823735626281328642 2017-01-23 03:34:12 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay no pressure, I'm just asking. :)
823734442791342083 2017-01-23 03:29:30 UTC <icedwater> @mrs_wee hello! Would you like to try #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday evening? @singnoname suggested you might be interested.
823715612283154432 2017-01-23 02:14:40 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay would you like to join #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday?
823712905015140352 2017-01-23 02:03:55 UTC <icedwater> thanks :)
823712838040457216 2017-01-23 02:03:39 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay I agree. Let's see.
823696246191759360 2017-01-23 00:57:43 UTC <icedwater> @petermansbridge @PhrenicFox will need a deep hole to hide from the carpet bombing of lies, yes.
823695213050806272 2017-01-23 00:53:36 UTC <icedwater> @HalfOnionInABag cute, I suppose, and it would probably annoy @realDonaldTrump to no end? As long as @POTUS doesn't care, it's OK I guess.
823692429828112388 2017-01-23 00:42:33 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 I like the vector art :)
823687049781780480 2017-01-23 00:21:10 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay we've observed that no WP MPs this far have become advisors. Yes. But of the two titles, one of them is the more neutral.
823686351887290368 2017-01-23 00:18:24 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad you seem to be talking about yourself :)
823610847817658368 2017-01-23 19:18:22 UTC <icedwater> The current situation in the US isn't new. Thanks @halleluyang (et al) for the RT, @creatrixtiara for thread.https://twitter.com/creatrixtiara/status/822997020939939840
823608658361618432 2017-01-23 19:09:40 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay they often have dual roles, to be fair, so I guess the real question is why they are allowed that role in the first place?
823607538838949888 2017-01-23 19:05:13 UTC <icedwater> @smod_abroad does that matter?
823607120712974336 2017-01-23 19:03:34 UTC <icedwater> @HougangHOOLs was there a United in the name...
823604611806208000 2017-01-23 18:53:35 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz why this small red dot kaypoh about other bigger patches? 
823604076323573760 2017-01-23 18:51:28 UTC <icedwater> the real question is: @mrbrown took a 70-30 MCQ and reposted it as a 80-cig open-ended. Is this innovation or plagiarism? :P
823602765637136384 2017-01-23 18:46:15 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz why what's wrong :p
823552070649135105 2017-01-23 15:24:49 UTC <icedwater> @Yair_Rosenberg does abortion being illegal in Palestine detract from others' desire to see it freed?
823329081613660160 2017-01-22 00:38:44 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake thanks for getting back to me :) see you next time, and welcome back to pondingland ;)
823326006391881728 2017-01-22 00:26:31 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah, @Medizin_Wookiee, @mrs_wee, @ofmeowandbake, @yuejie1994, I'll get back to you as soon as I can about a potential second team.
823325408791666688 2017-01-22 00:24:08 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH, @psy_lsh, @RedDot_Oz, @whyvo, we'll be six people on the team for #chopchopkalipok. I'm asking if they can fit a second team of 5.
823321551214739457 2017-01-22 00:08:49 UTC <icedwater> sorry, main team filled up fast; let me know if you still want in so I can roster out two teams :)
823320519181115392 2017-01-22 00:04:42 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG two bloody days behind TL as usual. But welcome back, @audreyleong13, and thanks @iUnspoken for the past week!
823221529211064320 2017-01-22 17:31:21 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake forgot to ask you, are you available for #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday?

823205786843115520 2017-01-22 16:28:48 UTC <icedwater> @dwu00 @singnoname not going to watch it before bed :)
823205645209899008 2017-01-22 16:28:14 UTC <icedwater> @yuejie1994 the regular team is packed but you can come by to watch. It's a SG-themed trivia quiz.
823205364954894336 2017-01-22 16:27:08 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo cool, thanks!
823205202681438209 2017-01-22 16:26:29 UTC <icedwater> @blameyourself16 I'm pretty sure conservatives were never concerned about being excluded. :) About the LGBTQ and ethnic minorities though...
823139932377972736 2017-01-22 12:07:07 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @garyklh Oh ya. Want to go #SGTipsyTrivia this Thursday? Paulaner Millenia Walk.

823126623088054272 2017-01-22 11:14:14 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk don't think NATO had to threaten to move troops on the US though...
823126233986703360 2017-01-22 11:12:41 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Holbornlolz because when the left do get their way, the right are allowed to protest in safety? :P
823124032832741378 2017-01-22 11:03:56 UTC <icedwater> @Jezebel @blameyourself16 probably doesn't doubt he will succeed. The question is, succeed in what.
823117346306830336 2017-01-22 10:37:22 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily a sea of what people #fixeditforyou

822837128467861504 2017-01-21 16:03:53 UTC <icedwater> @verkur let's work to make sure your 29th will not have that problem. Hopefully the systems to fix the issue still exist...
822780028274425857 2017-01-21 12:16:59 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice @ClandestineYeo @whyvo @kiampah @bargeboards @RedDot_Oz @nerissaclarice are we going for #chopchopkalipok next Thursday?

822480129695715329 2017-01-20 16:25:18 UTC <icedwater> @skinnylatte does it have to do with "bringing up the kids right"?
822446827488190465 2017-01-20 14:12:58 UTC <icedwater> confirm can.
822283980435165184 2017-01-19 03:25:52 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @phil_payne so Vanessa Kerry and Brian Nahed were married in 2009. Negotiations were 11/2013 to 07/2015. Let's see where the $ was.
822282146798702592 2017-01-19 03:18:35 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @phil_payne interesting, I hope that's just a spurious correlation. Though I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't...
822242604007837696 2017-01-19 00:41:27 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga love the reply tweets. Justifies her stance. :)

822119269102010368 2017-01-19 16:31:22 UTC <icedwater> @shamsensei sham on you!
822118527859494912 2017-01-19 16:28:25 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold sorry. Bit lazy to expand there. But yeah, since Brexiteers didn't want freedom of movement, that package option was out.
822114149941395456 2017-01-19 16:11:02 UTC <icedwater> @nushackers by the way. Can we talk about Apache mirrors?
822113048592719872 2017-01-19 16:06:39 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold yes, but that's not what Brexit was offered, if I recall correctly. They weren't interested in freedom of movement, right?
822112815406161920 2017-01-19 16:05:43 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay ouch. That's evil.
822112282666680320 2017-01-19 16:03:36 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua @rafie88 which UEFA qualifying group is China in?
822108935343710208 2017-01-19 15:50:18 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold didn't the EU make it clear that Brexit means no single market though? That's the sense I got...
822102419777540096 2017-01-19 15:24:25 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay ugh. Is there any source to verify this though... Which news agencies are you reading?
822102123806498816 2017-01-19 15:23:14 UTC <icedwater> I'm likely to be going tomorrow #planwhatplan
822099405280931841 2017-01-19 15:12:26 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl does @tanhuiyi like to peel you? That will confirm your identity.
822099005588926464 2017-01-19 15:10:51 UTC <icedwater> their offer is only valid for Jan though. 2 people $30 one session ;)
822042758395269120 2017-01-19 11:27:21 UTC <icedwater> come check out Grapple Max with me!
822042272376098819 2017-01-19 11:25:25 UTC <icedwater> Good work... But the comic sans and three different typefaces at the end ruined it :phttps://twitter.com/SgProWrestling/status/821567296871264257

821919458843164673 2017-01-18 03:17:24 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty maybe they're entering their teens :p
821858061279080448 2017-01-18 23:13:25 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice @hellofrmSG good, because I'm pretty sick of Apple addicts everywhere :p
821716157505777665 2017-01-18 13:49:33 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv would they though?
821715346897805313 2017-01-18 13:46:20 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG does any "self-respecting" editor NOT use Apple products?
821715083906560000 2017-01-18 13:45:17 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Death Star tech is so 1977.
821714842356629504 2017-01-18 13:44:19 UTC <icedwater> @akiestar ist Josh Limme the British spelling of Josh Lim? 
821709755743752194 2017-01-18 13:24:07 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl just hope this isn't because the US is going to shit faster than the UK is :p
821709339928850434 2017-01-18 13:22:27 UTC <icedwater> @barfluer the shit of the world are probably already in, let immigration fix that.
821564245187829761 2017-01-17 03:45:54 UTC <icedwater> @alexanderhanff @aral @siemvaessen to companies, who can be forced to surrender data if need be...
821519017064050688 2017-01-17 00:46:11 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers good work, nice article. Looking forward to the follow-up on data viz! But I'm not convinced we should publicize old tweets
821516827700248576 2017-01-17 00:37:29 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl I have. It's sometimes interesting to see phrasing of headlines and to try to guess why that particular article was listed.
821512593294491648 2017-01-17 00:20:39 UTC <icedwater> @JohnnyDuerden @BenitoWill where is the line correlating population, resources, and footballing development that China is "so far behind"?

821389869368766464 2017-01-17 16:13:00 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz you don't have to. It's her stance.
821388890825105409 2017-01-17 16:09:06 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM it's actually the second last to go. The food court closes on the 27th; Fusionopolis One retail areas under renovation till 2018.
821387077753315328 2017-01-17 16:01:54 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @singnoname of course. Nor do we need a random lady standing outside a building calling herself the carqueen...
821372734038867968 2017-01-17 15:04:54 UTC <icedwater> @Lrihendry if you only read two books a week and have no time for any other thought, you're in trouble... I know I am :p

818722145811341312 2017-01-09 07:32:25 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it was shorter than "decide in favour of" but I suppose "decide on" was the better one :p
818721142814830592 2017-01-09 07:28:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @lackadaisygirl I agree with @RedDot_Oz, I think we shouldn't exclude the "whites". Inclusion and critical analysis is key.

818433292177285121 2017-01-09 12:24:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG might I ask what helped you decide for Germany, and how long it took you to learn the language? My answer to both is MOELC.
818418920881164288 2017-01-09 11:27:30 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl I don't accept this.
818346032169816064 2017-01-08 06:37:52 UTC <icedwater> @LZealand @aral sure, if it is really just on your phone, and not on iCloud, other connected devices, or on any number of servers for backup

818266815117729793 2017-01-08 01:23:06 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname you can bring the person to the place, you can't force them to see the thing.
818236618960031744 2017-01-08 23:23:06 UTC <icedwater> @aral @LZealand also, this looks interesting:http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2017/01/05/your-iphone-is-tracking-you-heres-how-to-stop-it/

818055710705496065 2017-01-08 11:24:14 UTC <icedwater> well that, but we must not let rumour go unchecked, nor believe nothing... Cynicism isn't the answer to misinformation.

818046803597627393 2017-01-08 10:48:51 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill it's also the Anglicised term often seen for "oceanic demons", "yang guizi", if I recall correctly. :P

817607213858422784 2017-01-06 05:42:04 UTC <icedwater> @avalon maybe I'm too lenient. Probably could be divided into two paragraphs? Origin of the prize and white-dominated landscape?
817592827227951104 2017-01-06 04:44:54 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi that said, Coffee Bandits is surviving. I won't say going strong, but at least they're still here.

817570296072847362 2017-01-06 03:15:22 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren so it's a package deal? I can ask around. PhD need not do research afterwards, but to get there you need to do some ;)
817558247364128769 2017-01-06 02:27:30 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren maybe try just the undergraduate scholarship first?
817553000046563328 2017-01-06 02:06:39 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren lol. What guru. Are you interested in research?

817526602426761216 2017-01-06 00:21:45 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl come @aardmud :)
817525825859829760 2017-01-06 00:18:40 UTC <icedwater> @avalon two commas and a 'to' instead of 'the' should fix it.
817523336854933505 2017-01-06 00:08:47 UTC <icedwater> @zeligdhilee hi! Just wondering. Is it important to you that people follow back? What reasons would justify not following back for you?

817383578099027968 2017-01-06 14:53:25 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay also true. But totem/vlc are already Swiss army knives, so why not?
817383361438097410 2017-01-06 14:52:34 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail @mbtifacts1 got a source for this? :P

817318051854942209 2017-01-06 10:33:03 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM I like how your two profile pics almost blend into each other. It's like you have cat mode and person modepic.twitter.com/8el6xF57EN

817314537229537281 2017-01-06 10:19:05 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 also, maybe he got forwarded the photo. Maybe there was a conversation and the uncle rejected her kind offer. Judging is easy :p
817313721533927424 2017-01-06 10:15:50 UTC <icedwater> @joulisians or at least for @supercoderhari saying something about @mdzulkar9's "teach humanity" argument..
817313282360913920 2017-01-06 10:14:06 UTC <icedwater> @joulisians I don't think @mdzulkar9 disagrees, though. It looked like he was complaining that @supercoderhari was kind of victim blaming?
817282312312233986 2017-01-06 08:11:02 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon well yes. But sometimes the weather is cold :p

816919849481818112 2017-01-05 08:10:44 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @bluehand007 indeed! They should all be praying in the correct direction.

816828044065157120 2017-01-04 02:05:56 UTC <icedwater> @supercoderhari OK, but isn't that what @mdzulkar9 has been saying...

816701365216899073 2017-01-04 17:42:33 UTC <icedwater> Harsh words by STR, but at least a little more coherent. CPA ensures the EP is not a second centre of power, right?https://twitter.com/sgelection/status/816232665322057728
816697135248748548 2017-01-04 17:25:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @lackadaisygirl well I don't know which is which! I think the repercussions of one are more prevalent than of the other 
816693842409721856 2017-01-04 17:12:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG is it odd that I'm more interested in menstruation than Overwatch...

816605970230951936 2017-01-04 11:23:29 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo do you have to buy one when you don't have a notebook and pen on hand?
816604689512808448 2017-01-04 11:18:24 UTC <icedwater> @mintea I'm gonna track alcohol consumption. Expenses I've been doing quasi-daily for the past eight years or so... But never checked 
816602964341100545 2017-01-04 11:11:33 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna @shannonrwatts I'd like to see this chart, normalised by guns owned rather than 100k citizens... Is it possible? And why :)

816442132982419457 2017-01-03 00:32:27 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv yeah well. I try to start with the Dear but if they drop, I drop. I don't insist. Whether we should, I don't know.
816428818172784640 2017-01-03 23:39:33 UTC <icedwater> @spinningarrow_ didn't know they'd decoupled that far.
816320153751199745 2017-01-03 16:27:45 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 I guess it's a single school of thought...
816319358251085825 2017-01-03 16:24:36 UTC <icedwater> .@HougangUnited just curious, why is he signed on a one-year contract if you share a long-term vision?
816318273927069696 2017-01-03 16:20:17 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang welcome back! And all the best for the @epigrambooks job :)

816314083255255040 2017-01-03 16:03:38 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @cnni slow news week? Nothing to report on, like transfer fee madness or Christmas breaks and injuries...
816311267321229313 2017-01-03 15:52:27 UTC <icedwater> @mrbrown @lackadaisygirl @AdibJalal but only on the side, because they were too cut-and-dried when she wanted something more saucy...
816138303179063297 2017-01-02 04:25:09 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi then again it's easy to answer either way now. Until one is ultimately faced with that choice, it is hard to say.
815946578431119360 2017-01-02 15:43:18 UTC <icedwater> you already ownself tag me, how many servings you want @lackadaisygirl
815942393484570624 2017-01-02 15:26:40 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl lol. Practicing on random tweeps lah. Not that you were trolling. Yeah that's the only way I'm cool ;)
815942010666303488 2017-01-02 15:25:09 UTC <icedwater> @alexsandr_1956 ah, it's "(these places) clearly should be 'guarded' -- from whom exactly remains a secret for the police (to know)"
815941275945824257 2017-01-02 15:22:14 UTC <icedwater> @alexsandr_1956 fair enough.
815941196212105217 2017-01-02 15:21:55 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl I know, I was just practicing trolling to fight fire with fire :p

815934308053434368 2017-01-02 14:54:33 UTC <icedwater> @chrisvtaylor @jeffmcneill sure, but you can't say there's no humour.
815934034161188864 2017-01-02 14:53:27 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl I'm helping with the tech side of things :)

815814631226646529 2017-01-01 06:58:59 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill @chrisvtaylor there may be official regulation and stuff, but the ground is pretty cool and subversive, all things considered.
815812906621116416 2017-01-01 06:52:08 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill @chrisvtaylor just because you don't understand Chinese...

815811391516909568 2017-01-01 06:46:07 UTC <icedwater> That's how progressive the UK is? Excellent! @bluehand007 @davis_blackwood #fbhttps://twitter.com/Rollo54/status/815614371636318208
815810997793325057 2017-01-01 06:44:33 UTC <icedwater> @MailOnline .@PrisonPlanet @davis_blackwood I mean, if @mailonline uses a bunch of Sun Page 3s in a story and calls itself news, @snopes is OK by me.
815807656145211392 2017-01-01 06:31:16 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun that's the real story here!
815799256221028354 2017-01-01 05:57:54 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv still not burned at the stake :p
815791592745279488 2017-01-01 05:27:27 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I don't know, it seems a little excessive. Shouldn't excommunication suffice?
815781975340433408 2017-01-01 04:49:14 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv wah. Burned at the stake?!
815781223733657600 2017-01-01 04:46:14 UTC <icedwater> @aral I don't get it.. I still see your tweets though?
815780670911827968 2017-01-01 04:44:03 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill @JeromeTaylor doesn't this happen every weekend, or something, though...?
815778938697826304 2017-01-01 04:37:10 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill how is he wrong? There's many vague areas to define in that statement... Who's "us", and what's "consequential"...
815777522600144896 2017-01-01 04:31:32 UTC <icedwater> @chrisvtaylor @jeffmcneill said stuff like what...
815776876836683776 2017-01-01 04:28:58 UTC <icedwater> @alexsandr_1956 sad that peaceful celebrations in Dorstfeld are newsworthy. Were there issues due to migrants, or radical right?
815774950673956864 2017-01-01 04:21:19 UTC <icedwater> @dooryodhan how are its opponents punished by the state? What did I miss?
815768645607428097 2017-01-01 03:56:16 UTC <icedwater> @diebestimmerin @hanvoi nur so leicht ironisch, dass eine Schwarzer so denkt :p
815767956730703872 2017-01-01 03:53:31 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill @chrisvtaylor what core values might you be referring to? Is China wrong for trying to keep up with the Rest?
815767074899230720 2017-01-01 03:50:01 UTC <icedwater> @aral yeti droppings become knowledge crystals at high pressure, according to Hippipedia. :P I suppose the point was to acknowledge bias...
815764743973519360 2017-01-01 03:40:45 UTC <icedwater> @EminAksehirli thanks! Are you in Istanbul now? Is it more tolerant of Christmas than the smaller towns around it, or...
815764436937867264 2017-01-01 03:39:32 UTC <icedwater> OK call me a skeptic, but I suspect the running did more to help...
815760463338225664 2017-01-01 03:23:45 UTC <icedwater> did it work the last time you tried? Seems like criminal deprivation to me...
815753066108436480 2017-01-01 02:54:21 UTC <icedwater> Looks like "everywhere in Istanbul" needs to be verified, according to one of the responses...https://twitter.com/mediaforeign/status/815354141144924161

815424649513156608 2016-12-31 05:09:20 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol @ps1525 just like Hitler did :) Was Hitler a Muslim?

815416893464903680 2016-12-31 04:38:31 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @TheDIYHacks sure, but sometimes your complaint can change someone else's life for the better too :)
815412783244152832 2016-12-31 04:22:11 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol cite me the laws that you think exist, please.
815246188114915336 2016-12-31 17:20:12 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol none of my replies has been hate filled :) Some absurd, sure.
815245990789726208 2016-12-31 17:19:25 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol obvious that you miss deliberate absurdity due to the prevalent atmosphere. OK :)
815245718789058560 2016-12-31 17:18:20 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol my point from the beginning has been don't (cont) http://tl.gd/n_1spg69g

815232504122601472 2016-12-31 16:25:49 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol you mean equality and freedom of expression, OK
815232419640942592 2016-12-31 16:25:29 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol huh?
815129621486108672 2016-12-31 09:37:00 UTC <icedwater> @mark24823687 @mikandynothem @kingster2424 uh huh. Let's see.
815129238063890432 2016-12-31 09:35:29 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol we actually have hundreds of thousands of Muslims here :) Sit down and shut up.
815128733275172865 2016-12-31 09:33:29 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz wah lau eh. Damn salty leh.
814925605015695360 2016-12-30 20:06:19 UTC <icedwater> @mark24823687 @mikandynothem @paulhallbj so do I, but I also know many Muslims who don't teach such utter rubbish.
814924326663168000 2016-12-30 20:01:14 UTC <icedwater> @mark24823687 @mikandynothem @kingster2424 wrong, radicals are the cancer of the world. Please show yourselves the door.

814923864958377984 2016-12-30 19:59:24 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice you mean thanks to right-wing idiots who think out of their rear ends.
814923682518679552 2016-12-30 19:58:41 UTC <icedwater> @mark24823687 @mikandynothem @CoreyMark15 they were doing fine without their own "land" before.
814923260877946880 2016-12-30 19:57:00 UTC <icedwater> @TaylorEdwards99 that also, but more the former.
814922340970528768 2016-12-30 19:53:21 UTC <icedwater> @mark24823687 @mikandynothem @paulhallbj if someone else built another room in your house for unwanted guests, you'd like the tenants?
814829674740072449 2016-12-30 13:45:07 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah oh I forgot to even check that the L-Theanine is gone. Oh well. Tasted the same to me on Thursday. At least no more mad queues!
814825680634417152 2016-12-30 13:29:15 UTC <icedwater> Also, it's wrong to generalize in either case. @Dzenolol @TaylorEdwards99 @OnlineMagazin
814825633750491136 2016-12-30 13:29:04 UTC <icedwater> To a lot of people who are born into the ideology, it's the same thing. No conceivable way out. @Dzenolol @TaylorEdwards99 @OnlineMagazin
814825322688352256 2016-12-30 13:27:50 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @hj_chen for doing this! Good resource to have. I need to get around to doing something similar for Singlish :)https://twitter.com/hj_chen/status/814824934446809089
814825019121336320 2016-12-30 13:26:37 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah at least they didn't stop it halfway to play GXGX :P
814823915469971456 2016-12-30 13:22:14 UTC <icedwater> If an unwanted guest is "occupying" 0.05% of your house, that's also too much. Is that not a valid complaint? @mikandynothem @mark24823687
814823593389408256 2016-12-30 13:20:58 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @mark24823687 and @davis_blackwood for the RT, but remember the point is to decry lazy reasoning:https://twitter.com/icedwater/status/814794526296391680
814821934319796224 2016-12-30 13:14:22 UTC <icedwater> Again, lazy and misleading. Plus, the statistics are from 2011. Refugee numbers were also far lower then @davis_blackwood @tgp7777777
814819338876129280 2016-12-30 13:04:03 UTC <icedwater> "23% of being raped at least once in her life from 16-79" is NOT "Over 1 in 4 Swedish women will be raped" @davis_blackwood @tgp7777777
814817545228152833 2016-12-30 12:56:56 UTC <icedwater> So it seems the fallacy was commited by friatider.se in 2012, and revived repeatedly: http://web.archive.org/web/20131114170401/http://www.friatider.se/chocksiffror-mer-an-var-tredje-svenska-kommer-att-valdtas @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood
814816306117492737 2016-12-30 12:52:00 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol much like I've given you the benefit of the doubt that you can think. Apparently not.
814814167785799681 2016-12-30 12:43:30 UTC <icedwater> In https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/shocking-predictive-muslim-rape-numbers-one-in-fou-swedes-will-be-raped/: @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood "a Swedish woman... runs around 23% risk of being raped at least once" (from 16-79)
814810343742414848 2016-12-30 12:28:19 UTC <icedwater> I agree with the hiccup example per se, but those are two different probabilities that shouldn't be conflated, right?
814809922302984192 2016-12-30 12:26:38 UTC <icedwater> This early 2013 article https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/shocking-predictive-muslim-rape-numbers-one-in-fou-swedes-will-be-raped/ extrapolates from a 2011 survey and is used in a 2014 article tweeted in 2016 @WeirdWeb
814809471952121856 2016-12-30 12:24:51 UTC <icedwater> But cumulative lifetime odds of 1 in 4 is not "odds right now are 1 in 4" and shouldn't be equated @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood for drama.
814808668285718530 2016-12-30 12:21:39 UTC <icedwater> I agree: the odds that one hiccups in a year far exceed the odds for any given hour, though, ditto for rape. @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood
814807766594244608 2016-12-30 12:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice I'm trying to find the Wikipedia article with that text, could you help? "20%, ... is 80%" is weird and wrong.
814806724892717056 2016-12-30 12:13:56 UTC <icedwater> See here: https://twitter.com/icedwater/status/814806079859134464 By the way, @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood, 80% * 80% is 64%. "The longer the period..." is plain false.
814806176449712128 2016-12-30 12:11:45 UTC <icedwater> Taken from https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/shocking-predictive-muslim-rape-numbers-one-in-fou-swedes-will-be-raped/https://twitter.com/icedwater/status/814806079859134464
814806079859134464 2016-12-30 12:11:22 UTC <icedwater> Mathematical genius.pic.twitter.com/8JdR6NQRkZ
814805884790415361 2016-12-30 12:10:35 UTC <icedwater> In its references: @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood "Fact: How Probability and Statistics Work" suggests a 20% probability is a 80% probability?
814803632025538561 2016-12-30 12:01:38 UTC <icedwater> So don't take the extreme Muslim issues and tar all Muslims with the same brush. @Dzenolol @TaylorEdwards99 @OnlineMagazin
814803306698534913 2016-12-30 12:00:21 UTC <icedwater> Then, @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood, "...the risk of being raped at least once in a life, as much as 1 in 4 women are raped at least once..."
814802324459700225 2016-12-30 11:56:27 UTC <icedwater> This cites a 2011 survey (13000 people) from which 29000 rapes are estimated, giving odds 4/1000 = 0.4%... @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood
814802050659684353 2016-12-30 11:55:21 UTC <icedwater> .@Dzenolol @TaylorEdwards99 @OnlineMagazin it's a similar generalization you're making. Obviously my example is deliberately absurd.
814800302062698496 2016-12-30 11:48:24 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol in a similar vein, Adolf Hitler was a white man. All white men must be homicidal maniacs?
814799695264350208 2016-12-30 11:46:00 UTC <icedwater> The "proof" was from Jan 29 2013, nearly 2 years back. Again, ignore the date. @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood Now see: https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/shocking-predictive-muslim-rape-numbers-one-in-fou-swedes-will-be-raped/
814799059370143744 2016-12-30 11:43:28 UTC <icedwater> Sure, @tgp7777777 @davis_blackwood. Never mind that the article is from 2014. Look first at the "one out of four": http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/1-in-4-swedish-women-will-be-raped-as-sexual-assaults-increase-500/
814795513341976576 2016-12-30 11:29:23 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @tgp7777777 they're pretty different problems to solve, you know. And they can be tackled in parallel.
814794526296391680 2016-12-30 11:25:27 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @tgp7777777 it's lazy and wrong statistical reasoning.
814794409195671553 2016-12-30 11:24:59 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @latinaafortrump alarming, yes, but maybe read @ciccmaher in context? So much, even in academia, is clickbait...
814793819891724289 2016-12-30 11:22:39 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood this is a horrible event, almost as bad as the logic underlying the statistical reasoning applied.
814789704902029314 2016-12-30 11:06:18 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @TarekFatah I think it's more an Asian thing than a Muslim thing per se, to be completely honest.
814789043846164480 2016-12-30 11:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @LeaveEUOfficial heh, let's see :)
814743425190793217 2016-12-30 08:02:24 UTC <icedwater> @AyrshireBog @davis_blackwood @incongru it's not an emerging trend, though it's got easier to do so, I think.
814743187323375617 2016-12-30 08:01:27 UTC <icedwater> Any other sources to verify this with?https://twitter.com/BreitbartLondon/status/814572582167072768
814742594433392640 2016-12-29 07:59:06 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @69mib why don't you normalize that for cost of living too, though?
814740550746157057 2016-12-29 07:50:59 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood any sources other than @MailOnline with this story?
814740454705012736 2016-12-29 07:50:36 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood , @MailOnline

814739169264009217 2016-12-29 07:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @nafjodor @sweden @joseaglesnation employers need to be able to train new hires too, but yes, short term some skill should already be there.
814737041002885120 2016-12-29 07:37:02 UTC <icedwater> @BruRyder @FredrikJN who's this he you refer to, @sweden? Just trying to catch context.
814734809779929088 2016-12-29 07:28:10 UTC <icedwater> @emilp @sweden @AndyLeandy from context, I gather SD is kind of the equivalent of alt-right? Or what...
814734407672045568 2016-12-29 07:26:34 UTC <icedwater> @sweden definitely better this way sometimes. I like PC, but having to second-guess all the time also sucks ass.
814734210191671296 2016-12-29 07:25:47 UTC <icedwater> @M_Cederstrom @BruRyder @sweden as long as the sun is shining it's not night. :P
814733675463966720 2016-12-29 07:23:39 UTC <icedwater> @sweden unicorns do shit rainbows, unfortunately. If you go to the end of a rainbow you'll find a really relieved unicorn...
814732806303531009 2016-12-29 07:20:12 UTC <icedwater> @davis_blackwood @TheFoundingSon I would rather #banassholes.
814732522730844160 2016-12-29 07:19:05 UTC <icedwater> @sweden that's fair, but I suppose NPR research can be replicated in Sweden for a better idea than that. And questioned, too.
814729186317242368 2016-12-29 07:05:49 UTC <icedwater> @nafjodor @sweden @joseaglesnation that's an employer problem, not a minimum wage problem...
814722477460836352 2016-12-29 06:39:10 UTC <icedwater> @zynks @sweden that's interesting, it's the perspective our government has held for a while, but we do have some social protection.
814721488825630721 2016-12-29 06:35:14 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake lol! @dcatdemon @kiampah @omgitsjy @m4riannelee
814719835833647104 2016-12-29 06:28:40 UTC <icedwater> @nafjodor @sweden how does minimum wage hinder young people from entering the job market though?
814719061615513600 2016-12-29 06:25:35 UTC <icedwater> don't invite me for midnight mahjong then... @ladystormhold @m4riannelee
814718715971260416 2016-12-29 06:24:13 UTC <icedwater> thing is, some people are bombarded by others' opinions and yet continue uninterrupted on their trollish way...
814718221282484224 2016-12-29 06:22:15 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold 16th was my last workday this year :p
814717960614858752 2016-12-29 06:21:13 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho you'll find it again. Sometimes you just need to take time off to recover.
814717447760547841 2016-12-29 06:19:10 UTC <icedwater> the command line is also easy to use if you use it every day :p
814716892040437760 2016-12-29 06:16:58 UTC <icedwater> @OnlineMagazin @TaylorEdwards99 @Dzenolol ridiculous to shut out all Muslims because of a few. All white men should be banned from clubs?
814716523092676608 2016-12-29 06:15:30 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany nobody called you "curator" before?!
814716035815223298 2016-12-29 06:13:34 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz sorry to hear this. Take some time off to grieve with your family.
814704874667458560 2016-12-29 05:29:13 UTC <icedwater> This @tanhuiyi also sings well.
814689710454894592 2016-12-29 04:28:57 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah ouch.
814683509377765376 2016-12-29 04:04:19 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hASHbrownLEY @tanhuiyi got @YouTube meh. Neh tell me.
814661158544162816 2016-12-29 02:35:30 UTC <icedwater> Gonna check this out today. #happycat KTV time!pic.twitter.com/wnJkbmCvte
814634913076871168 2016-12-29 00:51:13 UTC <icedwater> also.... YOU JUST MADE THE LIST!!!
814631768833691648 2016-12-29 00:38:43 UTC <icedwater> excellent suggestion. Which do you suggest, Chanel, Hugo Boss, Lancome, or Yves-Saint Laurent? #deplorable
814628929810022400 2016-12-29 00:27:26 UTC <icedwater> @TheAlPitcher @sweden looks like the Independent are just out to stir the pot...pic.twitter.com/ytK0wGl2hF
814624355216830464 2016-12-29 00:09:15 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter lol I was just going to RT this onto your timeline after the proofreading thing 
814501428316160000 2016-12-29 16:00:47 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz suspected only...?
814500073912475648 2016-12-29 15:55:24 UTC <icedwater> My friends who will be in Melbourne on 3 Jan, please lend your support to this cause. At least read the thread.https://twitter.com/OmarjSakr/status/814331231315881984
814498235548958720 2016-12-29 15:48:06 UTC <icedwater> child porn! Really now. #PEOTUS doesn't need much tarnishing :)
814496765688750081 2016-12-29 15:42:16 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter pretty sloppy proofreading in that article too, I wonder if there is no one cares any more...
814421037223800832 2016-12-29 10:41:21 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice pretty sure that's worse than trolls or spambots.
814408351450677249 2016-12-29 09:50:56 UTC <icedwater> Interesting headline especially for the @washingtonpost owned by Mr. Bezos... Thanks for RT @ofmeowandbake :)
814406787956817920 2016-12-29 09:44:43 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake the question should be: how much is the salon paying them for this?
814386151771385856 2016-12-29 08:22:43 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @JuriaTRM because it means I regularly encounter people who insist on having it their way :p
814385994044575745 2016-12-29 08:22:06 UTC <icedwater> Am I the only one who gets nervous when eggs with no tweets follow them...
814385837559250944 2016-12-29 08:21:28 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi see, if you hadn't upgraded to 128GB you wouldn't have had this problem :p
814385592565841920 2016-12-29 08:20:30 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @ofmeowandbake eh that's more Hokkien than Singlish right... don't hear it often also. (But I guess that's a good thing.)
814349758923870209 2016-12-28 05:58:07 UTC <icedwater> @staciemb23 @sweden @citynightcap so this dictator is better because he was installed by his own people? OK...
814347710367170560 2016-12-28 05:49:58 UTC <icedwater> @sweden if they're @Sweden_AR I'd assume they are in SE and therefore have some? @AbuNawafNet
814315492840120321 2016-12-28 03:41:57 UTC <icedwater> @FunkyFairy22 why?
814273536369905664 2016-12-28 00:55:14 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany if it's the length of 1.5 Sptzle that's hardly a remarkable lead.
814272702877863936 2016-12-28 00:51:55 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz [citation needed] @ladystormhold
814268275697647616 2016-12-28 00:34:19 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi what's going on out there?
814266070093545472 2016-12-28 00:25:34 UTC <icedwater> that's lovely and we should keep it, eh @realDonaldTrump?
814261969419005952 2016-12-28 00:09:16 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish eh don lidat lah, i am jus *strum* trying my bes *strum* to do funny things *strum strum*
814261478559653890 2016-12-28 00:07:19 UTC <icedwater> Wasn't Stepney.
814260606266056704 2016-12-28 00:03:51 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch solche Tage hat ja jeder. Setzt dich doch vorm Fenster mit einer Tasse Tee und schau einfach raus?
814258752136179712 2016-12-28 23:56:29 UTC <icedwater> @washingtonpost @nytimes well that's a starting point for me to read up then...
814169689613942784 2016-12-28 18:02:35 UTC <icedwater> also, the problem is exacerbated no doubt by our fondness for sound bites and summaries...
814169152562696192 2016-12-28 18:00:27 UTC <icedwater> good point, how about population size and internal spread though? Means tell a simple story... Is it too simple?
814165636767092736 2016-12-28 17:46:28 UTC <icedwater> also, what "close data" are you referring to?
814160722867286020 2016-12-28 17:26:57 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane I don't use Instagram, but how is the follow-back convention there?
814157679711043584 2016-12-28 17:14:51 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @RedDot_Oz @ofmeowandbake I think "far" is typically efficient Singaporean shorthand for "inconvenient"...  And it's relative.
814156826673455104 2016-12-28 17:11:28 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I think yes. Options are good to have.
814155489051168768 2016-12-28 17:06:09 UTC <icedwater> don't know enough yet so I'll take that at face value, we need to investigate that.
814155236512133120 2016-12-28 17:05:09 UTC <icedwater> would be interesting to read up on the sources that generated this 77 cents to the dollar differential in the first place.
814154688392085504 2016-12-28 17:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue nope not right now, but I'm sure it will bubble up at some point.
814005174658158592 2016-12-27 07:08:51 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon haha. We were psyched out by the causeway camera photos and didn't go in the end.
813985280013152256 2016-12-27 05:49:48 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I see. I thought the jam was going in. I'm on my way in, anything you forgot to buy? :P
813980024604758016 2016-12-27 05:28:55 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon still stuck in there now?
813957591634100224 2016-12-27 03:59:47 UTC <icedwater> @DMHMiami305 yeah. Not necessary to reply to that tweet, then...
813951586435088384 2016-12-27 03:35:55 UTC <icedwater> Interesting. Does #edsg agree? https://twitter.com/ChrisMcD123/status/813918150211178496
813948963325820928 2016-12-27 03:25:29 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @tanhuiyi dunno, cleaning is cleaning. Maybe the guilt of spending $3K on a cleaner makes them use it more?
813947675011710976 2016-12-27 03:20:22 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue no it didn't seem like I was replying to that... Can't find the tweet any more.
813945867308670976 2016-12-27 03:13:11 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @adamkanzen heh

813941920980353024 2016-12-27 02:57:30 UTC <icedwater> @DMHMiami305 no, she is. Show some respect.
813941221081026560 2016-12-27 02:54:44 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Sheepy812 because when evil is already established, less needs to be said and more done; the first cut is the deepest.
813940355842195456 2016-12-27 02:51:17 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice responds* :p
813774253124292608 2016-12-27 15:51:15 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname why should they do anything? They would keep it like Home's dragon...
813761359489875969 2016-12-27 15:00:01 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue are they mutually exclusive?
813702505670393856 2016-12-27 11:06:09 UTC <icedwater> @lackadaisygirl @tanhuiyi can I chup in plz?
813695698176618496 2016-12-27 10:39:06 UTC <icedwater> @mcclure111 @hj_chen sorry.  Meant to ask, why would you create an AI in JavaScript, but the references were messed up 
813649234054348800 2016-12-26 07:34:28 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose when will you gamify gamification?
813648825449492480 2016-12-26 07:32:51 UTC <icedwater> @hj_chen @mcclure111 why would you function() an Object in JavaScript?
813593320366620672 2016-12-26 03:52:18 UTC <icedwater> @colinctc please elaborate. Do you mean the different environments a HC vs FC are in? @ladystormhold @joleeqh @singnoname @frhn @hellofrmSG
813581192423317504 2016-12-26 03:04:06 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane me too :) all boxed out from Boxing Day?
813464313658687489 2016-12-26 19:19:40 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul or face, whichever f you meant in mfw :p
813425010937204736 2016-12-26 16:43:29 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez actually probably more dmc.
813421273711710209 2016-12-26 16:28:38 UTC <icedwater> @Petra_Kvitova hope you have a speedy recovery!
813419901075365888 2016-12-26 16:23:11 UTC <icedwater> Anyone in the SF tech scene I know who'd have ideas?https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose/status/813419608048803841
813418929175416832 2016-12-26 16:19:19 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz obviously it is, it exists. All words are invented.
813411101224402944 2016-12-26 15:48:13 UTC <icedwater> @Singtel_Sahgiel it just struck me like SingTel was diversifying too fast, too furious. @internetofshit is about funny (or sad) IOT fails.
813410407549267969 2016-12-26 15:45:28 UTC <icedwater> @Singtel_Sahgiel thanks for your quick response :) There was brief signal loss that was restored fast (thanks!). I was commenting on IOT.
813400094540075013 2016-12-26 15:04:29 UTC <icedwater> @Singtel Not yet able to ensure reliable TV services, @SingTel wants to help you network and control your home and its devices. Yay, @internetofshit.
813389444287868929 2016-12-26 14:22:10 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA license for what?
813389320279076864 2016-12-26 14:21:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG If I could pay the better hawkers more I would, but sometimes I just want cheap food to fill my stomach. A bit undecided.
813388684791681029 2016-12-26 14:19:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG can one. Choral singing is pretty but different from pop singing. No fear, just go have fun :D How was the one in Tokyo?
813387105137086466 2016-12-26 14:12:52 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thanks for the RT :) Have you done karaoke in the UK? They're less particular about singing ability there I think. More for fun.
813385061965758465 2016-12-26 14:04:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I suppose being in the UK will make it harder for @hellofrmsg to coordinate, but would anyone else be interested in a karaoke outing?
813382682788831232 2016-12-26 13:55:18 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon well, I'd forgotten when I posted the tweet that womenfolk have one piece that is easier to clean than ours is. :p
813369161569083392 2016-12-26 13:01:34 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter damn, congratulations. I can only hope Holebas scores :p
813356395642818560 2016-12-26 12:10:50 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul what *are* your feels, do tell
813356092667244544 2016-12-26 12:09:38 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter all the best. But I'm sorry, I have Holebas in the centre of my FPL defence :p

813305363571167232 2016-12-26 08:48:03 UTC <icedwater> not sure where you're reading this just from the graph, but this is a bias I can live with. Favours improvement.
813302231147507713 2016-12-26 08:35:36 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I didn't see anyone else mention it, but now that you brought it up...
813245855922671616 2016-12-25 04:51:36 UTC <icedwater> it could already have been factored in, though.
813216055371800576 2016-12-25 02:53:11 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @abearfromSEA season's greenteas from the North Pole! If you ever lose your way, just follow the red star... 
813203965131112448 2016-12-25 02:05:08 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname as a fellow non-native and almost non-speaker, I can point out c'est doesn't have the  ...
813203077587091456 2016-12-25 02:01:36 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas @channingwalton that's an entire other level to "blue screen of death" :p
813202375661862912 2016-12-25 01:58:49 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hehe a slight problem is Brandenburg Gate in Berlin is also  as I recall... @singnoname @keeweeeee
813199646369513472 2016-12-25 01:47:58 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon actually, why is this not a thing? Hmm.
813198721974308864 2016-12-25 01:44:18 UTC <icedwater> this graph doesn't show rate of change of convergence, though.
813192311664316417 2016-12-25 01:18:50 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon hmm. Is that the reason for us being that way most of the year? 
813189499320602624 2016-12-25 01:07:39 UTC <icedwater> @MegaLucarioX pretty sure we already knew they would win the Star Wars :p
813016187185479680 2016-12-25 13:38:58 UTC <icedwater> is there data that shows this to be a non-problem though? Confirmation bias can burn both ways.
812964234787057664 2016-12-25 10:12:32 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose snobs* But isn't that what growth is about? Learning about <marquee><blink>new features! try now!</blink> wheeeee~~</marquee>
812952590505766912 2016-12-25 09:26:16 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 ah that. Heh. @NsK94
812658121558528004 2016-12-24 13:56:09 UTC <icedwater> @Nigel_Farage @neiljhk @Jez_57 lol, OK.
812580613857288193 2016-12-24 08:48:10 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue 122?
812580393924710401 2016-12-24 08:47:17 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @Tad690 I got to meet a group of wonderful people in a rainforest ;)
812467022197948416 2016-12-23 01:16:47 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @AdamFlinter I think A/B testing exists in other fields too though ;)
812466518650810369 2016-12-23 01:14:47 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue so you've aged 9 years in one? :P
812465621564735488 2016-12-23 01:11:13 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay given the response I think @woohuiren was well aware of that :p
812465245381722112 2016-12-23 01:09:44 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz my question would be what does the blank mean? Didn't even attend the vote?
812463142714281984 2016-12-23 01:01:22 UTC <icedwater> @bob_owens @neiljhk programs already exist that can troll on Twitter and trade algorithmically, though :)
812334633761140736 2016-12-23 16:30:43 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @bob_owens when all you can do can be replaced by a robot, it's time to learn to do some other things...
812329632586297344 2016-12-23 16:10:51 UTC <icedwater> @nerdyasians LOVE the replies. It's a coincidence that frogs make for good porridge in POC cuisine, right?
812328736213209088 2016-12-23 16:07:17 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz wait lol was this before or after Thursday night? :P
812327522121621504 2016-12-23 16:02:28 UTC <icedwater> @andreeani_ could be, or maybe @AlabedBana is just relieved to get out of Aleppo... Either way it doesn't help whoever is still inside.
812325326441234438 2016-12-23 15:53:44 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid all the best for the holidays, and take care :)
812323866714353664 2016-12-23 15:47:56 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi won't say here, but thanks :)
812322593499791360 2016-12-23 15:42:53 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi in theory. But I have the carcasses of all my failed experiments in minimalism still around, minimally cleaned up 
812321275775328256 2016-12-23 15:37:39 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi wait long long. To be precise, about 10 months...
812299310259781633 2016-12-23 14:10:22 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hopefully I can set a high bar for you in 3Q 2017 ;)
812295294230507520 2016-12-23 13:54:24 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi apparently people are renewing these things more often now...
812153425920028672 2016-12-22 04:30:40 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon gluttonous rice balls ROFL
812150608341831681 2016-12-22 04:19:28 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @RedDot_Oz look for my FB group, Singaporean Left-Handers Overseas...
812146206251941888 2016-12-22 04:01:59 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM perhaps. But I shouldn't have provoked him further either :)
812143920050098176 2016-12-22 03:52:54 UTC <icedwater> don't you dare! Be sour! Clap for your longest stable parliamentary democracy and feeeeeeeeeelllllllll the po- hmm. Autocorrect.
811989954830053376 2016-12-22 17:41:05 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @kuekj @singnoname @whyvo the written round was. That was OK. The picture round might have worked better with video ;)
811985350973210624 2016-12-22 17:22:48 UTC <icedwater> because.. new! Day rocks!

811982342319280128 2016-12-22 17:10:50 UTC <icedwater> @Ms_Wire @anne_theriault snow, cooler weather, staying in, and tasty hot drinks... I like a bit about winter.
811974541656223744 2016-12-22 16:39:51 UTC <icedwater> @gershonmarx I think they can be developed in parallel with, or as, public transport: Singapore can't be the first with driverless trains.
811974006383329280 2016-12-22 16:37:43 UTC <icedwater> @gershonmarx sorry too, I guess it's easy to be snarky, sour and defensive as a reflex given the waves of trolls out here.
811973593697382400 2016-12-22 16:36:05 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling dunno, I thought they looked all right and thematically agreed with the Smackdown ones.
811972244393996288 2016-12-22 16:30:43 UTC <icedwater> @gershonmarx less facetiously, I use public transport too and I live in a snowless country where autonomous vehicle research is done.
811971064225939456 2016-12-22 16:26:02 UTC <icedwater> @gershonmarx it was as solicited as yours? :)
811970827990093824 2016-12-22 16:25:05 UTC <icedwater> @jpbrammer oops, didn't realise Faith Spotted Eagle was a person. My mistake, didn't Google. Hope she will be taken more seriously.
811969360528973824 2016-12-22 16:19:15 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay @gershonmarx so use it in places where it doesn't snow... I don't see a problem :p
811969023961276417 2016-12-22 16:17:55 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats have you solved your sianz po problem?
811968328298172416 2016-12-22 16:15:09 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname not bad, we won even without the terrible picture round. What a relief!

811966430698606592 2016-12-22 16:07:37 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 haha how does it remind you of me? @NsK94

811892825155457024 2016-12-22 11:15:08 UTC <icedwater> @nerissaClarice don't worry, I had to leave my spoiled jetpack in the recycling bin at Somerset. I know how you feel. See you later!

811883968526041088 2016-12-22 10:39:56 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname no, unfortunately. Tried with D & D folks too.
811883740725026816 2016-12-22 10:39:02 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah got it. See you next time!
811879269404020736 2016-12-22 10:21:16 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo no problem. Hope it's not a serious issue :) let's catch up soon!

811851844397842432 2016-12-22 08:32:17 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if I should do this once a week for exercise. It helps to pass the time...pic.twitter.com/vqo4Cbuebw
811850226071805952 2016-12-22 08:25:52 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg I hope you got some exercise out of this thread, because I'm done wasting time with you :)
811849125473832960 2016-12-22 08:21:29 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg lol. Sure. So you've actually bothered to click once on my profile to insult me. That took lots of skills.
811847617525075968 2016-12-22 08:15:30 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg as opposed to calling other people on the Internet racist morons, which demonstrates an IQ of above 0.
811841335707607040 2016-12-21 07:50:32 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg also, congratulations on your acquisition of a thesaurus.
811841052898271232 2016-12-21 07:49:24 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg your wisdom is boundless :)
811814923164495872 2016-12-21 06:05:35 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo no problem, keep me updated.
811814807217152000 2016-12-21 06:05:07 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg I suppose the suggestion of violence is the best way for real men like you to teach others lessons. :)
811792973851566081 2016-12-21 04:38:22 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg all you've been saying so far is unfounded and demeaning, so if that's all your boldness is capable of, I'll pass. :)
811790951328849920 2016-12-21 04:30:19 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg "any" is a bold claim, as is "objective". I doubt you know the meaning of either, but I'll smile and let it pass. :)
811770803985317888 2016-12-21 03:10:16 UTC <icedwater> @PW4Enrg perhaps, in your estimation. We all have our blind spots, it's all right :)
811770414498070528 2016-12-21 03:08:43 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake lol when you come back for trivia you can form a second team and call it #qiuqiukalibao 
811614210614362112 2016-12-21 16:48:01 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I never said you did, and yes, I know you never said I said you did :P @leannalikescats @ladystormhold
811613369413185536 2016-12-21 16:44:40 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @leannalikescats @singnoname that's a dangerous attitude to have. It means you have no weekends.
811610391813898240 2016-12-21 16:32:51 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname in which manner of speaking, because there is no earthly time zone that has hit Friday yet :p @ladystormhold
811605583132430337 2016-12-21 16:13:44 UTC <icedwater> @aral sure, I agree in principle, but where are the distributed social networks that allow privacy to be maintained?

811391705979064321 2016-12-20 02:03:52 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards @kiampah @RedDot_Oz @singnoname @whyvo remember that #chopchopkalipok is meeting at Draft and Craft tomorrow at 7! See you!
811390064689152000 2016-12-20 01:57:20 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch "ich wei, aber was kann ich tun, wenn die andere Person nicht mehr mitkommen will?"
811388640525832192 2016-12-20 01:51:41 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling @RudoReels she and Charlotte Flair have traded the title every pay-per-view since 2016.
811245646560698368 2016-12-20 16:23:29 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling @psy_lsh he's wearing @foodpandasg colours. Coincidence? I think not!!
811245416108806148 2016-12-20 16:22:34 UTC <icedwater> @SPWMighty2 @SgProWrestling @psy_lsh retained the titles. Not won. More important :) @heelstatement
811245091390005248 2016-12-20 16:21:16 UTC <icedwater> @TODAYonline literally drawing attention to a car wreck. Why?
811236907841560579 2016-12-20 15:48:45 UTC <icedwater> That's a lot to fact-check... Any references @peta?https://twitter.com/peta/status/810698691577159680
811229243573030912 2016-12-20 15:18:18 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah congratulations!

811204146866982913 2016-12-20 13:38:34 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon @singnoname this reminds me of when I flew with Finnair and on transit in Helsinki the SG crew conversed in #Singlish off-duty <3
811203807199707136 2016-12-20 13:37:13 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen stained by the blood of kids who ask such questions, you should reply. :P
811159863799578624 2016-12-20 10:42:36 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv wah.
811051608117153792 2016-12-19 03:32:26 UTC <icedwater> can't say it's worse lol
811051500210241536 2016-12-19 03:32:00 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv so you also act-atas? Or you're the only one that's real-atas ;) @kiampah @RedDot_Oz

811042136447561728 2016-12-19 02:54:48 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @kiampah not there from what I remember. Shall we meet first and walk there? The rest have been before, so I didn't ask.
811039800052490240 2016-12-19 02:45:31 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @RedDot_Oz have you been to draft n craft before?
810882596087308288 2016-12-19 16:20:51 UTC <icedwater> I'll do it. @singnoname @kiampah @whyvo @bargeboards @RedDot_Oz and me is six right?
810880669052112897 2016-12-19 16:13:11 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA must make the stormy sea first. Then got chance to have five stars arising...

810712882526552064 2016-12-18 05:06:28 UTC <icedwater> @raagaven83 nope, but maybe this week when I'm on holiday.
810511631830523905 2016-12-18 15:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @eisen we have a vision for tomorrow - just believe! :)

810175489394417664 2016-12-17 17:31:03 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog I have just the antidote, CNY music.
810160527208914944 2016-12-17 16:31:36 UTC <icedwater> oof. Didn't notice that while skimming the article for the address.
810152661467025408 2016-12-17 16:00:21 UTC <icedwater> @FourFourTwoSG typo in the poster month. But someone probably already pointed this out...

809793307651907584 2016-12-16 16:12:24 UTC <icedwater> @raagaven83 hehe apparently it was in the article, 451A Queensway. So the scope is narrowed by quite a bit. :P
809793028890062849 2016-12-16 16:11:17 UTC <icedwater> @esti_d not that simple. True, but politicking over the scraps of investment that fall out also hurts the ambition.
809788164097216512 2016-12-16 15:51:58 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling to be fair, though, I guess you'd hardly want wrestling talent you hire once a month to waste time being an authority figure
809719458960809984 2016-12-16 11:18:57 UTC <icedwater> @raagaven83 oh dear. I'll take a walk on Sunday to see if I can find it then.
809689028521885696 2016-12-16 09:18:02 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling yeah. As King Ross would say, hip-hop-hip-hip-hopo-hypocrite!
809682402083622913 2016-12-16 08:51:42 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling you mean the Adams? :P
809584518533246976 2016-12-15 02:22:45 UTC <icedwater> @raagaven83 do you know where it is, can you show me?
809574304501284864 2016-12-15 01:42:10 UTC <icedwater> @seewolfDE oh NOW you shouldn't interfere?
809573992289841152 2016-12-15 01:40:55 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling what do you think of what WCPW is doing?
809564243720736768 2016-12-15 01:02:11 UTC <icedwater> @missokistic @Charles20ah24s I don't know. Why are you bringing it up two years after their death?
809359181161467905 2016-12-15 11:27:20 UTC <icedwater> @KurtSchlichter @JoeBlow75774439 @neiljhk let's see how far he gets first. And minorities mustn't be overlooked either.
809266249255395328 2016-12-14 05:18:03 UTC <icedwater> Any news on currency obsoletion measures in Malaysia? I'm hearing rumours about enforcing the hibiscus notes only... #fb
809257129102061568 2016-12-14 04:41:49 UTC <icedwater> @KurtSchlichter @JoeBlow75774439 @neiljhk also a good point. But they want Trump to run the country like his businesses?
809206631074439168 2016-12-14 01:21:09 UTC <icedwater> @KurtSchlichter @neiljhk @JoeBlow75774439 because paying for a campaign is the same as making business losses, OK...
809204287322456064 2016-12-14 01:11:51 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk jobs are jobs, yes. But it remains to be seen if you can still attract external investment as well as before. Hope so.
809200284169711616 2016-12-14 00:55:56 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk congratulations on attracting a British brand to open in Britain...
808947225715818496 2016-12-14 08:10:22 UTC <icedwater> @zimmermann_st @zimmermann_St @ALPHAHOUSE551 @bungeetags429 good riddance :)
808928414279303168 2016-12-13 06:55:37 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 San Francisco, Kansas City, Orlando, Houston. And yes.
808666836443152384 2016-12-13 13:36:12 UTC <icedwater> Tang has no alcohol in it :) I liked the orange flavour.
808666481697226752 2016-12-13 13:34:48 UTC <icedwater> lab thermometers have alcohol inside #AntiTipsyTrivia

808665828770004997 2016-12-13 13:32:12 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 visited, yes. Not had to live there, yet.
808663078610997248 2016-12-13 13:21:16 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 I suppose you're not fishing these off some random website or Wikipedia?
808662863254433792 2016-12-13 13:20:25 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 not disagreeing there.
808662569904848898 2016-12-13 13:19:15 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 for them, sure.
808662364941750272 2016-12-13 13:18:26 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 also, that first picture was not relevant at all to the point you were making. None of your pictures were :)
808661425094676480 2016-12-13 13:14:42 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 you assume too much, e.g. complaint and involvement are mutually exclusive
808659631014744064 2016-12-13 13:07:34 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 and probably a couple of others too, if not all those you attached in our conversation.
808659267343421440 2016-12-13 13:06:08 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 you've been unblocked because I thought better of it :) you're a troll not for an opinion, but for your first picture :)
808642922648195072 2016-12-13 12:01:11 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 @arttillery1980 probably you will understand being blocked, then :)
808642710085058560 2016-12-13 12:00:20 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 that's ridiculous, and you don't seem to be interested in any sort of intelligent discussion. Good day.
808642507529539584 2016-12-13 11:59:32 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 teachers can be trolls too, I am sorry you do not understand how humans work.
808642345943957504 2016-12-13 11:58:53 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 ah, OK. So after re-reading the article I agree with you, the FAS don't seem to think experience at Chainat Hornbill is enough...
808641866631479298 2016-12-13 11:56:59 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 there is the home association endorsement requirement, unfortunately, and I think their rejection is justified...
808641625865846784 2016-12-13 11:56:02 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 how Twitter works is it allows people open discussions. Unfortunately this also invites trolls who ought to be blocked :)
808640846014783489 2016-12-13 11:52:56 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 also, my opinion on my home has nothing whatsoever to do with you or the discussion before this.
808640455755739146 2016-12-13 11:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 the reason for the denial seems legitimate, though. Is any club here willing to hire him to fulfill that requirement?
808618645676920832 2016-12-13 10:24:43 UTC <icedwater> "OMG. This guy clearly knows nothing, I'm a published author so all my bullshit is automatically correct." Stop me if I ever do this. #fb
808618174706917376 2016-12-13 10:22:50 UTC <icedwater> @voxvot I'll give you that if you like, but this talk of fallacies makes none of yours or pmclauth's assertions in the thread logical/valid.
808616885419769856 2016-12-13 10:17:43 UTC <icedwater> @voxvot it doesn't matter what the fallacies are called if you keep piling them up, you know.
808616743199350785 2016-12-13 10:17:09 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ @voxvot you've still not pointed to any "one book" that you claim my "authority" "rests on". And now, ad hominem?
808615165209890816 2016-12-13 10:10:53 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ @voxvot actually, I have never heard of Nizkor till today. But feel free to build more illusory attacks. :)
808610859115155456 2016-12-13 09:53:46 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ @voxvot so on top of appeal to authority, you make straw men. Nice.
808610074176331776 2016-12-13 09:50:39 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 again, read it in context. I'm not going to repeat myself :)
808609917238026241 2016-12-13 09:50:02 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 nope. I am happy with it, but I think it can be more open :)
808608629880279040 2016-12-13 09:44:55 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 where did that ever come into the picture? Another one who doesn't know how to read :)
808608439240916992 2016-12-13 09:44:09 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ @voxvot no, it seems we rely on "have you read anything? or written anything? then shut up." appeals to authority
808608295522947072 2016-12-13 09:43:35 UTC <icedwater> .@twooor @_Allah_________ @pmclauth that's excellent, what was I saying about tarring people with a brush earlier...
808607747184832512 2016-12-13 09:41:24 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth oh, I thought you didn't care any more? You made a mistake, and you know it. I don't appeal to authority.
808607135844044800 2016-12-13 09:38:59 UTC <icedwater> @_Allah_________ I don't care how much @pmclauth has read or written compared to me; he can still speak rubbish, and we have to call it out.
808606821736775680 2016-12-13 09:37:44 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ as is your pic on "The more you speak against Islam and against all Muslims, the more terrorists will it create."
808605984713154560 2016-12-13 09:34:24 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ because "How dare she pretend to talk to Boko Haram? Muslims in her own country tried to murder her!" is rubbish.
808600947395989504 2016-12-13 09:14:23 UTC <icedwater> @_Allah_________ @pmclauth you care enough to respond repeatedly. Also, having done reading doesn't mean everything you say is true.
808596669843447808 2016-12-13 08:57:23 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth none yet, but what's your point? @sheilafla345 @_Allah_________
808570518643220480 2016-12-12 07:13:28 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling have you considered DVD releases of your events we can buy, or live online streams? I wouldn't mind (working on) either :)
808548766731014145 2016-12-12 05:47:02 UTC <icedwater> @_Allah_________ who, by the way, I agree with: if you continue to say "Muslims are bad", hate and terrorism will live on.
808548549029806080 2016-12-12 05:46:10 UTC <icedwater> I was referring to my clarification with you about "England not evolving". Didn't know @_Allah_________ meant Malala Yousafzai
808540152637243392 2016-12-12 05:12:48 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ ah, you meant Malala Yousafzai, not @sheilafla345.
808539922789339136 2016-12-12 05:11:54 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ wait, I think you need to read what I said more carefully. I called her out on her bullshit.
808534813774725120 2016-12-12 04:51:36 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ no, I'm saying traditions change. Languages, like customs, evolve.
808519901753135104 2016-12-12 03:52:20 UTC <icedwater> @_Allah_________ @pmclauth so great, your ancestors had to share its greatness with the rest of the world. Who's knocking you?
808519047046275073 2016-12-12 03:48:57 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv good job asking for permission first :)
808505744848863232 2016-12-12 02:56:05 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if this study can be replicated in other fields... #soundscutebutimhonesthttps://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/808503361343471616
808504527913500673 2016-12-12 02:51:15 UTC <icedwater> @TheShehzeenist obviously you know nothing about Islam, you need a White Person who has "objectively" researched it to tell you about it ;)
808500921084702724 2016-12-12 02:36:55 UTC <icedwater> Because my case is the only case that matters and other anecdotes or facts are irrelevant. #publishedauthor https://twitter.com/pmclauth/status/808495986238693376
808500386277388288 2016-12-12 02:34:47 UTC <icedwater> It's amazing what people think of themselves just because some company decided to publish a book they wrote eh @pmclauth?
808500131855101953 2016-12-12 02:33:47 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth keep on living in a world where only your perspective matters, see how many people you can "educate".
808499130775400451 2016-12-12 02:29:48 UTC <icedwater> @_Allah_________ @pmclauth sure, because traditions never change. That's why English has remained the same since Shakespeare.
808498148284854272 2016-12-12 02:25:54 UTC <icedwater> @JennLi123 @TheLoganTrent #killennials
808497861197328386 2016-12-12 02:24:45 UTC <icedwater> @pmclauth @_Allah_________ that's a ridiculous reading of her statement. Nobody likes to be tarred with any brush.
808496677195653120 2016-12-12 02:20:03 UTC <icedwater> @bluehand007 lol why should pork offend Muslims if it's not in their food? What are you offended by?
808247639883923456 2016-12-12 09:50:28 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren read through dota.sh to see where the default came about? Let's talk on IRC?
808246695335063552 2016-12-12 09:46:43 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren I'm no expert, but I usually try to find issues by starting the same command in a terminal first...
808123345254219776 2016-12-11 01:36:34 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz gotta wonder who this guy is and why his comment was sought or published in the first place...
807892782824075266 2016-12-11 10:20:24 UTC <icedwater> @Hopeily not introduced by any host nation yet I suppose... Wait for Indonesia to host :)
807891444291682304 2016-12-11 10:15:04 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty and it's reunion dinner time... so I'll be out :)
807771878035075072 2016-12-10 02:19:58 UTC <icedwater> @betelbox @SgHeritage_Soc cool, but can we please make sure the real rainforest remains too?
807750977042268160 2016-12-10 00:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it was a special on Cervantes I think. The outgoing US ambassador was there too.
807664309513793538 2016-12-10 19:12:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG ah that's nice! My colleague introduced me to him at that performance in Black Box. The venue was perfect I think.

806429979776983040 2016-12-07 09:27:44 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay meaning? Do we already have a meetup group for Internet stuff? Because I don't want to make another just for RFCs...
806106233161674752 2016-12-06 12:01:17 UTC <icedwater> @nele_lenze that other state should rename to higher Saxony.
805977487008112640 2016-12-05 03:29:41 UTC <icedwater> @internetsociety @harishpillay @Seoul_Tech would not this call for a RFC for dummies kind of session?

805421371664666624 2016-12-04 14:39:53 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 @psy_lsh also bring some cash for t-shirts. The merch $ helps support the wrestlers and for this event, charity too.

805417567409975296 2016-12-04 14:24:46 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch I hear that's a singular error that you haven't got enough of.
805414522659872768 2016-12-04 14:12:40 UTC <icedwater> @fivetwosix thanks. Got the latter, but even then the smallest states are several times the size of Singapore. Which principles do you mean?
805361580212776960 2016-12-04 10:42:18 UTC <icedwater> @avalon good to hear that! That suggests you have the strength of will to be active offline :)
805360345208352768 2016-12-04 10:37:23 UTC <icedwater> can teach me Cham? Let's write a textbook together lol
805357869675651072 2016-12-04 10:27:33 UTC <icedwater> Come join me for #WrestleTheOddsII ! The card is shaping up nicely. #fbhttps://twitter.com/SgProWrestling/status/804860309814984704
805357103980298241 2016-12-04 10:24:31 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @EveKeneinan I'd rather we stop making any changes to either of those numbers, but that's even less likely...
805356689247510529 2016-12-04 10:22:52 UTC <icedwater> What if this was all part of a plan? asks @HeerJeet. Ugh. #NewWorldOrder coming...https://twitter.com/HeerJeet/status/804873893697581056
805354349379469316 2016-12-04 10:13:34 UTC <icedwater> Via @JohnnyQubit. Some entertainment for our dark times.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs
805352783213756416 2016-12-04 10:07:20 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv maybe he has fathered thousands of children around the world...
805352586098290688 2016-12-04 10:06:33 UTC <icedwater> @fivetwosix really? I'm not sure it can be done at the same scale... the details are going to be tough to replicate, I think.
805064192155758593 2016-12-03 15:00:35 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin what was the score!?
804976345121898497 2016-12-03 09:11:31 UTC <icedwater> @hwsoh more huater soon. Next year Fusion no police also close food court. Dunno the temp one how big.
804971207086850048 2016-12-03 08:51:06 UTC <icedwater> lol. Milo is not a "humorist-provocateur" if he threatens offense "by breathing". The threats, if real, are regrettable, though.
804966337525100544 2016-12-03 08:31:45 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga not everyone is capable of going through all that, though.
804930339604828160 2016-12-02 06:08:42 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill thanks but no thanks :)
804922467898662912 2016-12-02 05:37:25 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail 156m very tall liao. I don't think I can reach 2m...
804922307797925888 2016-12-02 05:36:47 UTC <icedwater> @AdrianChen amazing how much difference can be made by shifting an "even", eh?
804921733773856769 2016-12-02 05:34:30 UTC <icedwater> @linode @jeffmcneill does sound good and I'd try it, but I don't need more than what @digitalocean offers right now :) $ a consideration too
804918992561262593 2016-12-02 05:23:37 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon majuleh. majulor. majumeh? majuhor. MAJULAH. majuliao. maju sumore
804914741822881792 2016-12-02 05:06:43 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill OK so @linode is half the price of @digitalocean too?
804909574176194560 2016-12-02 04:46:11 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG definitely not the first time, but it's always cool! :) Guess this guy will have to update his video. https://youtu.be/yJYFC7J9zYY
804869828603351045 2016-12-02 02:08:15 UTC <icedwater> @eisen yes, but who supplied Google Earth with the old satellite pictures?
804869422837964801 2016-12-02 02:06:38 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon hmm this one can. But when ang moh do it we kpkb. pic.twitter.com/tAPApZ7rIp
804725082736107520 2016-12-02 16:33:05 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti wah. ICQ! What did @FriedEnglish101 do to prompt that?
804647294318493696 2016-12-02 11:23:59 UTC <icedwater> @gweezilla I thought that time you say you sian people always ask you about Singlish and not poetry, or something...
804647027892064257 2016-12-02 11:22:55 UTC <icedwater> .@steve_steglitz uh huh. Okay, sure.
804646670994542592 2016-12-02 11:21:30 UTC <icedwater> Especially 20th century Latin carols, or something like that https://twitter.com/infernoxv/status/804158880234147840
804561242002112512 2016-12-01 05:42:02 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah https://youtu.be/WwfVaehcdfE
804517364863639552 2016-12-01 02:47:41 UTC <icedwater> @OReillyMedia @harishpillay @humble h-emacs it look good though
804498192171732992 2016-12-01 01:31:30 UTC <icedwater> I feel like @kolatubosun should know about this for some reason https://twitter.com/TeleFootball/status/804065065750016000
804497652414967808 2016-12-01 01:29:21 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga lol at steve_steglitz including jk_rowling in that tweet :p
804497247324909568 2016-12-01 01:27:45 UTC <icedwater> @steve_steglitz so?
804362351130472448 2016-12-01 16:31:43 UTC <icedwater> @LanguageCrawler although @gweezilla seems maybe quite reluctant to take up the mantle of #SinglishAmbassador these days #fb
804342605739741184 2016-12-01 15:13:15 UTC <icedwater> @esti_d probably the first @hellofrmSG with something to give away at all 
804341903722328064 2016-12-01 15:10:28 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @redlightvoices for the thread on Geert Wilders' convenient ignorance of tolerance.https://twitter.com/redlightvoices/status/803888249714393088
804340165829214209 2016-12-01 15:03:34 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose that's today then. Happy birthday JB!
804133937937166336 2016-11-30 01:24:05 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz why?
804000030080176128 2016-11-30 16:31:59 UTC <icedwater> because older people exercising their democratic right are ruining the lives of the young? 
803991447854718976 2016-11-30 15:57:53 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 not qualified to comment on last, but I guess some will pass your test. Tampines Changkat CC 6pm, $25/$45. http://www.spw.com.sg/tickets.htm
803987039242682368 2016-11-30 15:40:22 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @mindyfinn @antodav does not accept the results. He thinks he should have won by more.
803985787683414016 2016-11-30 15:35:23 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 eh. Did I ask you about watching SPW already? Dec 10 is #WrestleTheOddsII.
803985517956108288 2016-11-30 15:34:19 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @antodav I don't think @mindyfinn is fighting the election as much as @realdonaldtrump is, though...https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664
803984814869090305 2016-11-30 15:31:31 UTC <icedwater> @charlescwcooke I'll check article history at some point, but I'll take it for now. So she was wrong before. Does that make it right now?
803972355345117184 2016-11-30 14:42:01 UTC <icedwater> Ugh, what a picture. But the question is crucial too: what will get you into trouble with the State?https://twitter.com/ezlusztig/status/803715035180584961
803971338167721984 2016-11-30 14:37:58 UTC <icedwater> @ezlusztig I wonder if the endgame was Pence after all...
803971031878680576 2016-11-30 14:36:45 UTC <icedwater> @mindyfinn @antodav *is* trying to bring you together. Please let there still be a US of A for my friends there.
803968970361434112 2016-11-30 14:28:34 UTC <icedwater> @charlescwcooke I'll buy that as soon as you have proof :)
803967379038273537 2016-11-30 14:22:14 UTC <icedwater> @ezlusztig @MrDane1982 it's quite despicable to question the sanity of people you don't agree with, unfortunately.
803965726092464128 2016-11-30 14:15:40 UTC <icedwater> @Twitter .@ezlusztig and leave @twitter to the racists? No, I've enjoyed the rest of it too much. We must campaign for the blue bird to take action.
803962528053104640 2016-11-30 14:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @ezlusztig it does seem uneven, but should GDP and political power correspond?
803958540570267649 2016-11-30 13:47:07 UTC <icedwater> @TPM oh dear. That suggests the site would be thrown open for someone who would vote for Donald Trump to step in and take his place.
803892368592093184 2016-11-30 09:24:10 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @singnoname @abearfromSEA the crown prince wishing the king eh

803559491870433280 2016-11-29 11:21:26 UTC <icedwater> I guess UKIP did have a better gauge of sentiment on the ground, or were they better at stirring it up?
803558942374641664 2016-11-29 11:19:15 UTC <icedwater> @TheDailyShow is she having meetings with Hillary Clinton in that cabin in the woods? :P
803557923146190848 2016-11-29 11:15:12 UTC <icedwater> hmm, so "privatised NHS" is a known problem that UKIP-leaning Lab voters are sick of hearing, and not why they're leaning to UKIP?
803519575409049600 2016-11-29 08:42:50 UTC <icedwater> @footysg so turn off tracking when you go swimming lor...
803442859009392641 2016-11-28 03:37:59 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon that would be someone who doesn't identify as either male or female.

803296364088016896 2016-11-28 17:55:52 UTC <icedwater> @PeoplesPowerSG and how would you have handled it?
803281834855407616 2016-11-28 16:58:08 UTC <icedwater> TW: violence. Think this is Malaysia, but if it happens here, what can we do @TWC2? I was alerted by @andreeani_ #fbhttps://twitter.com/UncleAhBoon/status/803075985641848832
803250993982910466 2016-11-28 14:55:35 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake ah. OK!
803249335433449472 2016-11-28 14:48:59 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake you watch Westworld?! I only see trailers before YouTube ads. 
803207254086299652 2016-11-28 12:01:46 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual who knows, maybe the ban helped...
803018841647259648 2016-11-27 23:33:05 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez you don't say - I sold Sanchez for zil lor.
803016294127706112 2016-11-27 23:22:58 UTC <icedwater> @Jack1234589 then we owe it to ourselves to not just admire the broad strokes, but also appreciate the finer details.
803012140617461760 2016-11-27 23:06:28 UTC <icedwater> @Jack1234589 that's one reason to justify overseas intervention, I suppose. The decision has always been inconsistent.
803006870491279364 2016-11-27 22:45:31 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers no, not free as in $0, free as in we users have control of our own software. Bit radical but worth it in my opinion.
803006146839650304 2016-11-27 22:42:39 UTC <icedwater> @Jack1234589 "democracy" and "freedoms" (sic) are not maintained outside your own shores.
802906594472136704 2016-11-27 16:07:04 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers well.... GovTech is trying and I do like the new http://data.gov.sg, so I would say 6.5? Haha #divinediscontent
802906262027370496 2016-11-27 16:05:44 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers yeah agreed. Software patents are a bit dated and hard to enforce. We also need free software, though that may be tough.
802904419897479168 2016-11-27 15:58:25 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats hehehe
802903847261769728 2016-11-27 15:56:09 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats 20% suspicion is not a suspicion because it's even odds given that there were 5 people in the picture:p
802903479987539968 2016-11-27 15:54:41 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yeah. Good to watch but rubbish for fantasy league 
802903227301662720 2016-11-27 15:53:41 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers apart from software, data, IT and the associated mindsets, I would like Singapore to be more open to alternative choices.
802902433768742912 2016-11-27 15:50:32 UTC <icedwater> @spinningarrow_ a git?
802902132575735808 2016-11-27 15:49:20 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Sanchez is more than OK. The problem is that I sold him off and gave zil a chance  Gabriel I dunno. Needs more game time?
802901874923839490 2016-11-27 15:48:18 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers then there's open data, for company and government transparency, as well as utility to us citizens.
802900984657649664 2016-11-27 15:44:46 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers well, for me it's more software-based; I'm a massive open source fan. Not sure about free software. Paradigm shifts needed.
802900647947354112 2016-11-27 15:43:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG watching for my fantasy league picks haha. Mixed, dropped Sanchez and picked zil but at least I have Monreal. Also Cook :(
802848280879108096 2016-11-27 12:15:21 UTC <icedwater> @pangy333 when will you do the real thing 
802847302511493121 2016-11-27 12:11:27 UTC <icedwater> Thread by @NoraMulready about the arrogance of the Left. Don't always agree, but worth thinking about. via @WeirdWebhttps://twitter.com/NoraMulready/status/802841920884064257
802833171733618688 2016-11-27 11:15:18 UTC <icedwater> I prefer @newstarsoccer for this. Less snazzy and more old-school :)
802827977713012736 2016-11-27 10:54:40 UTC <icedwater> @ibz @gregorylent good to bear in mind. We all have points we will staunchly defend, but we must keep listening.
802796403638431744 2016-11-27 08:49:12 UTC <icedwater> @debbiediscovers thanks :) it's pretty abstract though. What would you do about it on your end?
802754037871476736 2016-11-26 06:00:51 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo wah sibei clandestine leh

802750414919606275 2016-11-26 05:46:27 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo I agree with the first statement. But 4 hours ago was morning right
802641856869777408 2016-11-26 22:35:05 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv heh
802524653684019200 2016-11-26 14:49:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hmm. Quite different leh... don't think they're comparable at all. But I'll sleep on it and maybe I'll think different tomorrow.
802523655104143366 2016-11-26 14:45:24 UTC <icedwater> eh, laptop also can wake on LAN one ah.

802513757985349632 2016-11-26 14:06:04 UTC <icedwater> Any clients for Group DMs? I don't want @Twitter's "while you were gone", ads and suggested follows just for the odd group chat.

802503609451585540 2016-11-26 13:25:44 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple whatever it is... hope you recover soon.
802423166211497984 2016-11-26 08:06:05 UTC <icedwater> @HernandezTony what is your point?

802415749172051968 2016-11-25 07:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH only at SG level, I guess. He seems to have done well enough for himself at club level?
802415322565222400 2016-11-25 07:34:55 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Mr Wolly and Mr Yakky, anyone?
802339470771032064 2016-11-25 02:33:31 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium definitely the latter. Maybe a bit of both.
802187710911823873 2016-11-25 16:30:28 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi haha I don't know. I just try random things to see if they're funny sometimes. Based on how you keep calling Orchard Road OR...
802184421184937984 2016-11-25 16:17:24 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake see DM lol

802182322250354688 2016-11-25 16:09:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I can't speak for other schools but when I went to AC we were told "you're used to free 80s and 90s, that won't happen here" 
802180751156342784 2016-11-25 16:02:49 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA lol like that also can ah
802177326322630656 2016-11-25 15:49:12 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue by any chance would you be interested in watching SG Pro Wrestling in Dec 10?
802176537977987072 2016-11-25 15:46:05 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul wah lau. I had to scroll through 30% of those comments before I found the word "prompt", though context did help a bit.
802172800077205504 2016-11-25 15:31:13 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold that is fair, I suppose. I'm knee-jerk defensive of anything Singlish :)
802172267304087552 2016-11-25 15:29:06 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @saysayingsyed I think it's just that Lulu is just opening and there's hype, plus you can't watch two movies at the same time...
802171988047380480 2016-11-25 15:28:00 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold why leh... good stuff written in Singlish is damn rare OK

802165185150480385 2016-11-25 15:00:58 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG class size and subject matter, plus approach to failure I guess?
802162302065643520 2016-11-25 14:49:30 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @singnoname if he had stolen three he would have been a sanja?

802154636538822657 2016-11-25 14:19:03 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Germany, naturally. Because I'm most familiar with that system among all outside of SG.
802154357277921280 2016-11-25 14:17:56 UTC <icedwater> @voxdotcom lol. OK.
802147552556519424 2016-11-25 13:50:54 UTC <icedwater> oh dear. What got you so pissed?
802147047205785600 2016-11-25 13:48:53 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz how so? Even if everyone had voted for, it would still have been up to individual cultures and societies to decide.
802143441215889408 2016-11-25 13:34:34 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo fffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuu
802140472617537536 2016-11-25 13:22:46 UTC <icedwater> oh my god! he's broken in half!
802139219715989504 2016-11-25 13:17:47 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga would this be it?
802138651467517953 2016-11-25 13:15:32 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz omg you killed kenny
802138322810245121 2016-11-25 13:14:13 UTC <icedwater> Would be instructive to find out how @Forbes does its ranking. @pohui

802088148679282688 2016-11-25 09:54:51 UTC <icedwater> @FuzzyLeapfrog @MaxCRoser I wonder what the data from outside North America and Europe are...
801958042161975296 2016-11-24 01:17:51 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter wait till they become the new bubble tea. Then every fifth HDB estate will have a co-working space.
801957827405193216 2016-11-24 01:17:00 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter would you say that was a successful launch?
801957329767800833 2016-11-24 01:15:01 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjy obviously the solution is more Circuit Training.
801955021034115072 2016-11-24 01:05:51 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM thanks! :)

801809516098523136 2016-11-24 15:27:40 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM do you have a copy of @mynahmag I can borrow? Want to read it to get a feel of the content.
801809329015820288 2016-11-24 15:26:55 UTC <icedwater> @gubyrayle hi! I still want to pitch SPW to you but I dunno if there's still time :) How many articles have you got for the next issue?

801752085913948160 2016-11-24 11:39:27 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards @singnoname and me from the regulars, and 2 surprise guests!
801600680276279300 2016-11-23 01:37:49 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @shimmertje8 for RTing the piece by @bobaubreyNEWS. It seems @LinkedIn commenters are more civil than most places on the Web. :)
801565604729630720 2016-11-23 23:18:27 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold what's the difference between letting agents there and real estate agents here?
801565398348877826 2016-11-23 23:17:37 UTC <icedwater> @GabrielJR also by the way, how have the ((( worked for you?

801208396309360640 2016-11-22 23:39:02 UTC <icedwater> @observer @bpub well then, if there are, we have to #CallThemNazis :)
801207207966576640 2016-11-22 23:34:18 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay lol  #hugs
801106499799957504 2016-11-22 16:54:08 UTC <icedwater> as long as people like you are not distracted, who are able to act, then good will be done :)
801106327254618112 2016-11-22 16:53:26 UTC <icedwater> I can afford to be distracted, I have no way to conduct my own investigations so sideline commentary is all I got.
801105995879460864 2016-11-22 16:52:07 UTC <icedwater> that's OK. I won't applaud any denouncements by Trump, even if by some chance they would somehow come along.
801105699707027456 2016-11-22 16:50:57 UTC <icedwater> lol. Thanks, but I intend to stay where I am already valued - and safe - for the time being.
801099415905648640 2016-11-22 16:25:59 UTC <icedwater> I am certain the publicity would have helped, but they were already mobilising at rallies, I should think.
801098847237783552 2016-11-22 16:23:43 UTC <icedwater> by what, I'd love to know:)
801097635192934400 2016-11-22 16:18:54 UTC <icedwater> yes, does that disqualify me from commenting? Especially because we depend so much on the rest of the world, it matters.
801097161119186944 2016-11-22 16:17:01 UTC <icedwater> I wish I could agree with you, but why are they more prominent now than before the campaign? Our choice? I doubt it.

801091652467032064 2016-11-22 15:55:08 UTC <icedwater> I'm not convinced this will work in the long run...

799071521339744256 2016-11-16 02:07:51 UTC <icedwater> .@ladystormhold also, new words are being added to the language all the time. We can't cheer "kiasu" and reject "allyship". @kyleriiiil
799032480917430272 2016-11-16 23:32:43 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @yokey017 but in the East 
798913479193133056 2016-11-16 15:39:51 UTC <icedwater> Racists and extremists don't look any different from the "good". Until they act. Thanks for sharing @salenagodden.https://twitter.com/salenagodden/status/798871569116385280
798912553543876608 2016-11-16 15:36:10 UTC <icedwater> @elmyra hmm. Is there a source for this?
798912402175578112 2016-11-16 15:35:34 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual enjoy. Can't make the trip now.
798867405137014784 2016-11-16 12:36:46 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane darn, four weeks, but still. 
798867250107158528 2016-11-16 12:36:09 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane heh why did the judge say it should be upwards of 4 months if he was gonna give just 10 days? #givein
798865519973543940 2016-11-16 12:29:16 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv they will know better now 
798858730066448385 2016-11-16 12:02:17 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @ofmeowandbake tentative, @ClandestineYeo @singnoname @kuekj out, @omgitsjy @bargeboards @kiampah  and me in for this round is it?
798827277538603008 2016-11-16 09:57:19 UTC <icedwater> Gotta remember this sometimes...https://twitter.com/khalids/status/798669867712794624
798776565861466117 2016-11-15 06:35:48 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @kiampah @bargeboards @singnoname @ClandestineYeo @whyvo @ofmeowandbake oooo yeah sure!
798742445848543232 2016-11-15 04:20:13 UTC <icedwater> .@hellofrmSG if we treat property as investment, then this is a necessary side effect. I "need" a house to live in and another for income.
798742071926398976 2016-11-15 04:18:44 UTC <icedwater> @deciduity @hellofrmSG it is convention, but I don't know how rich I would feel with massive debt. This leveraging comes at a cost...
798696566563295233 2016-11-15 01:17:55 UTC <icedwater> @PeopleOfUK heh, I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt 
798629600708345856 2016-11-15 20:51:49 UTC <icedwater> @PeopleOfUK definitely 1. Neo-nazis can be nice enough people to drink with, unfortunately. Extremists can appear sociable too.
798625630103314432 2016-11-15 20:36:02 UTC <icedwater> @McFlyCahill90 Thanks @mcflycahill90! Take care of yourself too :)https://twitter.com/McFlyCahill90/status/796822981704089601
798622419170643968 2016-11-15 20:23:17 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA copy/paste fail 
798622014315474944 2016-11-15 20:21:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I agree with @deciduity. We can think more about passive income with less debt; owing more to earn more is a bit odd for me.
798621469009817600 2016-11-15 20:19:30 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG just not keen on getting property as investment in such a packed place. There needs to be more public space and nature.
798620282118225920 2016-11-15 20:14:47 UTC <icedwater> @asuna88 @ladystormhold @hellofrmSG not over-protective, but protective at all, I suppose. I don't buy into the asset mentality.
798618839751589888 2016-11-15 20:09:03 UTC <icedwater> @YeoshinLourdes how pathetic that the other guy proved you right by just replacing one word in your quote.. sigh...
798615685840531456 2016-11-15 19:56:31 UTC <icedwater> not really, since you can be interested in politics and not want to vote. What I'd ask is how these figures were obtained...
798524068471324672 2016-11-15 13:52:28 UTC <icedwater> @howserv lol what @ArtTillery1980
798389600548950020 2016-11-14 04:58:08 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 yes, you were replying to Okwonga with a Nation of Islam reference. I did not see the relevance at all.
798370379362242561 2016-11-14 03:41:46 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 yeah.. so what was the point of bringing that up?
798364757073854464 2016-11-14 03:19:25 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 wait, how is this relevant? Are you comparing Islam activists in the US with Black Lives Matter?
798364009812541442 2016-11-14 03:16:27 UTC <icedwater> @ArtTillery1980 is that official US police policy, then?
798339499541397504 2016-11-14 01:39:03 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren @BBCEarth surely they've just found the last five minutes of a Snorlax spawn.
798339079549030400 2016-11-14 01:37:23 UTC <icedwater> @tiakhui does that mean it gives different colours depending on the angle? Or it projects something :p
798338460792688641 2016-11-14 01:34:56 UTC <icedwater> @howserv @ArtTillery1980 that was 70 years ago. Don't pretend that it's still needed now.
798317661687988224 2016-11-14 00:12:17 UTC <icedwater> .@howserv @ArtTillery1980 you've never asked why, with wars and military bases all over the world, you might have some enemies?
798225776730513409 2016-11-14 18:07:10 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld rest well and enjoy the slower timeline :)
798217932165640192 2016-11-14 17:35:59 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname ya lor. All go together talk shit only.
798216724399067136 2016-11-14 17:31:11 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @singnoname I cannot. Not hipster enough. Need to train AI for that.
798215825769385984 2016-11-14 17:27:37 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake bought a Redmi Note 2 from a shop in Far East Plaza in Dec last year. I'm OK with it but it does a few mysterious things.
798213516503023616 2016-11-14 17:18:27 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh so anyway, here are the ticket details. It's at Tampines Changkat CC. Shall we meet for dinner first? http://www.spw.com.sg/tickets.htm
798212454949928960 2016-11-14 17:14:13 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG missed the handover, but did you already disclose your conflict of interest here? @ladystormhold @asuna88
798209278922211329 2016-11-14 17:01:36 UTC <icedwater> @psy_lsh yeah I tried to group DM with my client and it failed. LOL. Sorry. Can yours do it?
798207151269216256 2016-11-14 16:53:09 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany ich kenne nur Silbermond

798196600912814080 2016-11-14 16:11:14 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti haven't managed to do so. Concat(url1,url2) gets them in the same cell but hyperlink goes to url1url2 which almost never works.
798193805346238464 2016-11-14 16:00:07 UTC <icedwater> @pwafork ha!
798174195699970048 2016-11-14 14:42:12 UTC <icedwater> Anyone on @hellofrmSG interested in heading to the next @SgProWrestling event on Dec 10? #WrestleTheOddsII #fb

797963839534833664 2016-11-13 00:46:19 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam because your rebellion has been so successful?
797875827157237760 2016-11-13 18:56:35 UTC <icedwater> @nsp_sg even if they might be out of touch, you're in no position to take advantage...
797712133181947904 2016-11-13 08:06:07 UTC <icedwater> The one thing that matters: it has been going on too long.https://twitter.com/tocsg/status/797468766095323136

797464900213743616 2016-11-12 15:43:43 UTC <icedwater> @lizzette were you there? I just feel it was a missed opportunity for cheap laughs and good irony, the way he ended.
797409006679506945 2016-11-12 12:01:36 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @TheeNerdwriter for the session! #swf #nerdwriter You should have ended with "we should try to make America great again"
797408560317485057 2016-11-12 11:59:50 UTC <icedwater> Q: how did T get support from the minorities he trod on? A: he played to fears. Was progress too fast? #swf #nerdwriter
797407880689291264 2016-11-12 11:57:08 UTC <icedwater> Q: Personal narratives eventually collapse; do national narratives? A: Trauma scales. Coherence needs effort. Don't give up #nerdwriter #swf
797406993547825152 2016-11-12 11:53:37 UTC <icedwater> Q: how does the left recover from the coherent 8-year obstruction campaign; empathy is counterproductive? A: we have to try #swf #nerdwriter
797406365610147842 2016-11-12 11:51:07 UTC <icedwater> A: how can some issues still be 50-50 all this while? Some things should be more obvious. Emotive narrative works. #swf #nerdwriter
797405776465666048 2016-11-12 11:48:46 UTC <icedwater> Q: how do you create narratives without oversimplifying? A: someone special who can present truth but emote it? #nerdwriter #swf
797404887071850500 2016-11-12 11:45:14 UTC <icedwater> A: Maybe Donald Trump courses in journalism school? How do you pin an afactual person down? How to take a stand centrally? #nerdwriter #swf
797404154448605184 2016-11-12 11:42:20 UTC <icedwater> Q: how will this trauma affect journalists? A: how do you handle allergy to fact and accommodate objectivity? #nerdwriter #swf
797403031960588288 2016-11-12 11:37:52 UTC <icedwater> Q1/: how do left activists bring working class back? A1/: probably a good idea to start with listening outside your bubble #nerdwriter #swf
797401988258414592 2016-11-12 11:33:43 UTC <icedwater> Q: where does the American narrative go from here? A: no idea. Can the left regroup with a coherent narrative? #swf #nerdwriter
797401650382008320 2016-11-12 11:32:23 UTC <icedwater> Q: amazing that Trump got this far on white working class despite his history. A: simple stories appeal more. #nerdwriter #swf
797401013305024513 2016-11-12 11:29:51 UTC <icedwater> Trauma is the breakdown of existing narrative and the relentless search for new ones #nerdwriter #swf

797256330926903296 2016-11-11 01:54:56 UTC <icedwater> @MarkAClarkson lol, what?
797253444012650496 2016-11-11 01:43:27 UTC <icedwater> @edb87 @EvilWrangler sure. You may mean it, but can you stop everyone with a "musket" from doing otherwise?
797252868763840512 2016-11-11 01:41:10 UTC <icedwater> Sorry, I thanked @elmyra earlier, but it was @DybbukStay who RTed this onto my timeline...
797252616560381954 2016-11-11 01:40:10 UTC <icedwater> Read this thread please. What if the Holocaust was just people being proactive? Thanks @elmyra for RT of @hoedassah https://twitter.com/hoedassah/status/797200613603823617
797120436211326976 2016-11-11 16:54:56 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh nope. It's not a miracle. It's just a hard-earned, well-played campaign.
797116246399459328 2016-11-11 16:38:17 UTC <icedwater> it is coded into the system, though, as is popular majority not being enough to win...
796912175251980288 2016-11-10 03:07:23 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld why do birds suddenly appear *shudder*
796898063038038016 2016-11-10 02:11:18 UTC <icedwater> Hmm. Have to figure out how this is a problem... more to read...https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/796555216674025472
796896214444740608 2016-11-10 02:03:57 UTC <icedwater> This particular tweet in the thread... I wonder if it is a sign?https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/796336247379726336
796892804773384192 2016-11-10 01:50:24 UTC <icedwater> @pwthornton @DinoStraciatela I suppose the polls should have accounted for the ECs rather than the popular vote...
796886426319077376 2016-11-10 01:25:04 UTC <icedwater> @WIRED any follow-up with Sam now?
796855047925571585 2016-11-10 23:20:22 UTC <icedwater> @ParisEscape_ @charlielindlar @Icantwait_SA guess what happens to Trump :)

796644890931130368 2016-11-10 09:25:17 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 unveil what?
796644744902295552 2016-11-10 09:24:42 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @kosherjellyfish is that when Sim Ann supports Halimah Yacob in 2017?!
796644510524547072 2016-11-10 09:23:46 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv interesting.
796566976533381120 2016-11-09 04:15:41 UTC <icedwater> ah forgot the first word! #StillABetterLoveStoryThanTwilight
796566838540832768 2016-11-09 04:15:08 UTC <icedwater> @theydidthemath also that 27% is probably a good tradeoff for being able to separate doughnuts in the box better :p
796563823196942336 2016-11-09 04:03:09 UTC <icedwater> declare yourself as obsolete! 
796554403486408704 2016-11-09 03:25:43 UTC <icedwater> @Aresendez01 I suppose what @ShaunKing meant is that it's happening on Day 1 when we know Trump will be President...
796552076260036608 2016-11-09 03:16:28 UTC <icedwater> We have to act together and harness our anger productively. Thanks @OmarjSakr for the thread and @Okwonga for RT.https://twitter.com/OmarjSakr/status/796540553592717312
796550998332313600 2016-11-09 03:12:11 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @davidLeeTNP so we need to lose/draw two more to win this #SuzukiCup lol

796550000293482497 2016-11-09 03:08:13 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv feel free to eat somewhere else first, and just get a drink there :p
796545149769658368 2016-11-09 02:48:57 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I only had a cocktail but yes I like the ambience. You could almost forget you're next to a casino...
796524279898640384 2016-11-09 01:26:01 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @ladyxtel the tools are here to listen to diverse views. But it's possible to build a worse echo chamber on Twitter. Let's remember.
796522707495944192 2016-11-09 01:19:46 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IrishCrimson @IRadovanovich the inability of "experts" to read the situation "on the ground".
796520325324226560 2016-11-09 01:10:18 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IrishCrimson @IRadovanovich sadly, I think academic interest in process over outcome might have helped cause the problem.
796519648741072896 2016-11-09 01:07:37 UTC <icedwater> @danibobanny I hope you're not seriously asking for one...
796518696550166528 2016-11-09 01:03:50 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual didn't plan. Are tickets still available?
796515056116584448 2016-11-09 00:49:22 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IrishCrimson @IRadovanovich do what you're comfortable with. I'm not from the US, but the anger with the system seems international
796506196437913600 2016-11-09 00:14:10 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga good club mission. Have a great time on the pitch and all the best off it! Wer sind die Sponsoren? #krass
796504375363411969 2016-11-09 00:06:56 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo sometimes you just don't want to vote, that's OK too. But you have to live with the consequences...
796494353707376640 2016-11-09 23:27:06 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale for me, yes. But we're not ready for it.
796492890331488256 2016-11-09 23:21:17 UTC <icedwater> Please read this entire thread on how privileged communities should act. We all have something to do.https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/796470317204078592
796490631228964864 2016-11-09 23:12:19 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen thanks. Got it from @kosherjellyfish. But I saw it later anyway. Geez... some of us are just so insulated...
796490294149533696 2016-11-09 23:10:58 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IrishCrimson @IRadovanovich so are you going to actually question it, or just sit there and proclaim your doubt?
796490029207994368 2016-11-09 23:09:55 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IRadovanovich of course you should question. But at some point you have to act on information you have. Don't get stuck in analysis
796488858565165056 2016-11-09 23:05:16 UTC <icedwater> @marcmaron so if say 25.9% had voted, e.g. Bernie Sanders, as a write-in, the media would have picked it up and asked about it?
796392432917065728 2016-11-09 16:42:06 UTC <icedwater> Already seeing riots breaking out in the US. Please protest peacefully, if you must at all, @HillaryClinton supporters... stay safe, all #fb
796391055440506880 2016-11-09 16:36:38 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IRadovanovich so can scientific theory. But until disproven, they're what we have.
796390429289639936 2016-11-09 16:34:09 UTC <icedwater> @Okwonga off topic, but what's the team whose jerseys are in your Twitter header?
796390014611427329 2016-11-09 16:32:30 UTC <icedwater> @FirEicia you would have said the same about Hillary Clinton if she had won #justsaying

796372994234851328 2016-11-09 15:24:52 UTC <icedwater> @EByard @IRadovanovich I think it's from polling :)
796372488959574016 2016-11-09 15:22:51 UTC <icedwater> @FuzzyLeapfrog nor was #meritocracy, I think we'd better check for other -crazies now...

796368231111868417 2016-11-09 15:05:56 UTC <icedwater> @eisen actually, three-cornered fights also cost Trump another 31* votes (*2-2 in Maine) as far as I understand. See http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27442881/fptp-usa.xlsx
796358877612687365 2016-11-09 14:28:46 UTC <icedwater> @skinnylatte somehow I don't think you'll be getting that question anytime soon...
796355987590385668 2016-11-09 14:17:17 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @blackadlerqueen did you manage to screenshot the thing? I missed it completely...
796351494861647873 2016-11-09 13:59:26 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi @bcrypt the problem is that the Trump win *is* a git revert.
796351088278417408 2016-11-09 13:57:49 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose @pimterry it is an unfortunately funny acronym :)
796348262261223424 2016-11-09 13:46:35 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner if you want to use the third party fallacy, Stein got way less than Johnson...
796345204361949184 2016-11-09 13:34:26 UTC <icedwater> @kaity_nichole not every German was a Nazi, but guess how they got painted for decades...
796339045429186566 2016-11-09 13:09:58 UTC <icedwater> @eisen that's hillarious.
796337982693179392 2016-11-09 13:05:44 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya hmm
796336718848802817 2016-11-09 13:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @eisen is probably just gonna be a Treign of error...
796334224060006400 2016-11-09 12:50:48 UTC <icedwater> @amasad @EdgarArout cross-border bubbles that reflect the growing irrelevance of nation-states, apparently...
796326992115138561 2016-11-09 12:22:04 UTC <icedwater> @JayJazzi where did you find this information by the way? I want to know more...
796323828674592768 2016-11-09 12:09:30 UTC <icedwater> why? Justin Bieber is from Canada and he managed to get as famous :p
796266050270601216 2016-11-09 08:19:54 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish that's remarkable self-awareness haha. But you forgot that he has prevailed over all the madness before...
796265710414499841 2016-11-09 08:18:33 UTC <icedwater> @verkur same case as in Singapore leh...
796229255956865024 2016-11-08 05:53:42 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi jy?
796227827553009664 2016-11-08 05:48:01 UTC <icedwater> @eisen all this talk about streaks. Surely WWE and EPL have taught you better
796219005329547264 2016-11-08 05:12:58 UTC <icedwater> @eisen probably going to buy a few thousand when it hits 1.1, but I don't know if I can hold it for 6 years :p
796217090721988608 2016-11-08 05:05:22 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @RachelleLefevre that's untrue, and you know it.
796212029589635072 2016-11-08 04:45:15 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @BrianBlues still too early to call. Bit irresponsible, some of these projections ;)
796211505708400640 2016-11-08 04:43:10 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @BrianBlues thanks for the confirmation. But even in the cities, most of the precinct results haven't even been processed.
796210048389156865 2016-11-08 04:37:23 UTC <icedwater> @eisen also, how are they calling California blue when so much of it is still up in the air?pic.twitter.com/5DUl1MoZFg
796208596484648960 2016-11-08 04:31:36 UTC <icedwater> @eisen indeed. similar results can be seen all over the US.
796206670967771136 2016-11-08 04:23:57 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos btw your Twitter bio is "Interective Graphics". I was just going to point out the typo "This is unchartered territory" on 538 :p
796206011270860800 2016-11-08 04:21:20 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos haha thanks for replying despite the craziness that must be going on in Toa Payoh right now! :D
796205899974967296 2016-11-08 04:20:54 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos obviously everyone has their own take on matters... let's see what happens in the end @STcom @ajplus @nytimes @joanna_jane
796203236281565184 2016-11-08 04:10:18 UTC <icedwater> Wow, @STcom. Completely different from @ajplus and @nytimes. Really have to wonder what's going on here @joanna_jane. Comments, @vivi_pazos?
796202129266393088 2016-11-08 04:05:54 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul looks that way, to be fair. Maybe 2/3 or something.
796201939406962688 2016-11-08 04:05:09 UTC <icedwater> Lol. @nytimes now has 168-172 for @realDonaldTrump while @ajplus has 131-197... is it an agenda thing, or factual discrepancy? #what
796200587469549569 2016-11-08 03:59:47 UTC <icedwater> @JoergHenning Virginia only has 13 electoral votes though, not the gap of 22 that I pointed out. I'm just confused, @nytimes.
796200047926906880 2016-11-08 03:57:38 UTC <icedwater> Wait, what? 49.2% beats 50.8%?pic.twitter.com/olI3yJ0hN9
796199348052762624 2016-11-08 03:54:51 UTC <icedwater> Reminder: @nytimes "Were offering live estimates ... of what the results will be at the end of the night, based on the votes ... so far."
796197482040410114 2016-11-08 03:47:27 UTC <icedwater> Interesting. It seems @nytimes (109-168) is slightly behind @ajplus who have @HillaryClinton 131-168 vs @realDonaldTrump. Same votes cast?!
796188883926982657 2016-11-08 03:13:17 UTC <icedwater> @serenelooys ~education~ is no guarantee against habits and human nature :p
796188466618908672 2016-11-08 03:11:37 UTC <icedwater> Sneaky way to ensure attention! May not be the best for heartrate though :p @HacksHackersSGhttps://twitter.com/atoker/status/796176641600974851
796187752056270848 2016-11-08 03:08:47 UTC <icedwater> @serenelooys not true. *This* country also has some :)
796185825654362113 2016-11-08 03:01:07 UTC <icedwater> True true :) So why not find out more? http://www.parliament.gov.sg/whos-my-mphttps://twitter.com/haicurll/status/795991258099421184

796181299606077440 2016-11-08 02:43:08 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti might you know why Wyoming is marked as red even though @nytimes has them as 0% reporting so far? @avalon
796179229947797505 2016-11-08 02:34:55 UTC <icedwater> @avalon just results at http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-abc-region&region=span-abc-region&WT.nav=span-abc-region and some commentary on http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2016-election-results-coverage/. http://www.aljazeera.com/ has front page video
796178622583189504 2016-11-08 02:32:30 UTC <icedwater> Hmm, does anyone know why Gary Johnson is listed as an Independent in some states and Libertarian in others? Looking at @nytimes coverage.
796177743897448448 2016-11-08 02:29:01 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale not new, it seems a lot of @BarackObama's promises went unfulfilled too. Governing isn't simple. Intention and drive are key.
796175505179348992 2016-11-08 02:20:07 UTC <icedwater> Why are exit polls "rather" bogus?https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/796120327109623809
796175172969459712 2016-11-08 02:18:48 UTC <icedwater> That's unfortunate. I hope this #VoterFraud allegation is untrue and it's simply a mechanical fault. https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/796053302693822465
796159045094674432 2016-11-08 01:14:42 UTC <icedwater> @downey heh. Hope your preferred candidate gets over 5%. I'd like to see a better contest next round :)

795014199483068416 2016-11-05 21:25:30 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c how did you calculate this?
794932255181242368 2016-11-05 15:59:53 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I actually don't use my LinkedIn profile... heh. Oh well... I suppose I should fix my about.me :p @omgitsjy
794930493628133376 2016-11-05 15:52:53 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon the thing that triggered me, heh, is that you don't know how you got signed up for it. I'd check again...
794930161858658304 2016-11-05 15:51:34 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon yes, that's it. As long as you have control over the info you put out and you're aware of what you're sharing...
794928957531373570 2016-11-05 15:46:47 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon that's good, but giving your info away to a third party company is kind of different, right? Maybe I'm just too German.
794924918357901312 2016-11-05 15:30:44 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG welcome @jwlltn, and thanks again, @RoosDeBaas! Hope we all enjoy the week ahead :)
794921473739657218 2016-11-05 15:17:02 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon don't give away your info la... at least read t&c first
794920788465885184 2016-11-05 15:14:19 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon you don't recall signing up for an account but you're going to give your info anyway? I have this bridge on Carousell..
794919937517101057 2016-11-05 15:10:56 UTC <icedwater> @Equateall lolololololol
794911577338060801 2016-11-05 14:37:43 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hope you and your visitors have a great time, welcome them to Singapore for me, and may we meet soon!
794900220521779201 2016-11-05 13:52:35 UTC <icedwater> @wef @kiampah @ladystormhold I think so! I'd expect some of it to cancel out somehow, right...
794899792904101888 2016-11-05 13:50:53 UTC <icedwater> @Equateall #WhatWouldTrumpDo to fix this?
794858864088739840 2016-11-05 11:08:15 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti well 2bad im sorry 4 u. i feel u but it is what it is #tq
794858451516043264 2016-11-05 11:06:37 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ keystroke biometrics, that's interesting... I wonder if my phone (aka Xiaomi, Google, et al) know if it's me typing :p
794790792648736768 2016-11-04 06:37:46 UTC <icedwater> @FastPokeMapCom @NoblePhoenix let them quit :) no crowds = more fun.
794758749973979136 2016-11-04 04:30:26 UTC <icedwater> @Google @KathleenNdongmo uses statistical translation as far as I know, probably what @baroka is referring to...
794556044512874497 2016-11-04 15:04:57 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake yup!
794494180223434752 2016-11-04 10:59:08 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG https://mobile.twitter.com/icedwater/status/660231557299486720
794478537126252545 2016-11-04 09:56:58 UTC <icedwater> @bearybernie what course is that?
794456614572953600 2016-11-04 08:29:51 UTC <icedwater> @TNPSports lol. I may forget Algarve CF but I'll remember the Laguna Bintan at the bottom for how random it is...
794455867781365760 2016-11-04 08:26:53 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG #RoKurOuttanowhere!
794438998915575808 2016-11-04 07:19:51 UTC <icedwater> why let facts get in the way of a good story eh @redpillinvestor?
794376379269681152 2016-11-03 03:11:02 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @BasicNewbie wait. So if they were offering free WiFi at stations...
794353444895133696 2016-11-03 01:39:54 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @tengkiat for the good read! Wish @ALB_S_FC the best in 2017. #defence #fighting http://m.todayonline.com/sports/champions-albirex-uncertain-future-beyond-2017
794351213709930496 2016-11-03 01:31:02 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo just wondering, why are Christmas carols weeks in advance OK when there's such outrage at CNY music being too early :p
794340649747156992 2016-11-03 00:49:03 UTC <icedwater> Of course, that was promptly followed by no service at Farrer Road and Holland Village, then the train was delayed "due to an incident" #bus
794340184020029440 2016-11-03 00:47:12 UTC <icedwater> They're not testing at Botanic Gardens now, thankfully.https://twitter.com/SMRT_Singapore/status/794314292031930369
794326667674062849 2016-11-03 23:53:30 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname there is a risk, of course, that we limit ourselves or that the situations that made those ideas work are gone. @hellofrmSG
794326372806070272 2016-11-03 23:52:19 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname drinks on you, then?  @hellofrmSG
794235642859298816 2016-11-03 17:51:48 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @singnoname talking a good game on the sidelines hardly means anything else 
794206591247450112 2016-11-03 15:56:21 UTC <icedwater> Excellent work. Good use of irony here. I approve. #fb https://twitter.com/IcureitWMyBrain/status/794203565493395456pic.twitter.com/GxvRyIJzn6
794205328703262720 2016-11-03 15:51:20 UTC <icedwater> @PeoplesPowerSG maybe a word or two went missing... do you want people to vote opposition, or not?
794204314960961537 2016-11-03 15:47:18 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @greyskies dunno, I guess it has its uses... but I still think it's a little extravagant.
794187841202884608 2016-11-03 14:41:51 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin @GaryKLH well, I wouldn't assume that, but she was being professional and performing her job...
794187272652406785 2016-11-03 14:39:35 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH and I have these discussions now and then, it's OK. But let's take it offline :)
794187124769599488 2016-11-03 14:39:00 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH it's implied in "should be".
794186841352065024 2016-11-03 14:37:52 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin @GaryKLH that was the one I saw, I think. :)
794186258612264961 2016-11-03 14:35:33 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH may I just point out this is typical right-wing extremist "make x correct as it should be" vocabulary :p
794185374155182081 2016-11-03 14:32:03 UTC <icedwater> @TheRealSDSS he's not called @spinningarrow_ for nothing! 
794184645705244672 2016-11-03 14:29:09 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld @hellofrmSG I don't watch enough NXT any more to have a favourite, but OMG the graduates.
794184170696126464 2016-11-03 14:27:16 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH ey. Don't try to radicalize @omgitsjy ah. 
794184010373050369 2016-11-03 14:26:37 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin I saw a Chinese ad earlier advertising the derby coverage on Eleven Sports / Toggle! #2stepsforward3stepsback
794183687491317760 2016-11-03 14:25:20 UTC <icedwater> that's a positive framing of the situation :p
794183347979239428 2016-11-03 14:24:00 UTC <icedwater> wah. Heng I only took for one stop, didn't get affected by this. I wonder if the cost of breakneck progress is revealing itself?
794182885716541440 2016-11-03 14:22:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG heh, I'm not convinced they are the right choice, to be honest.
794182727259942912 2016-11-03 14:21:32 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG as with the LionsXII,  appeal to nostalgia is bad; let sleeping clubs lie. Build upon what we have, open new doors #freshstart
794180411496669184 2016-11-03 14:12:19 UTC <icedwater> @elmyra selbst das ist ziemlich Deutsch. 
794180226326491137 2016-11-03 14:11:35 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats oh oops. Thought it was like a uni thing. Looks like gumtree is our Craigslist eh?
794177326430883840 2016-11-03 14:00:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @OvRobinLi actually I think @ALB_S_FC is doing pretty well even with locals.
794176374793641984 2016-11-03 13:56:17 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats might be a psych experiment. Where did you sign up for the focus group? :P
794175123100053504 2016-11-03 13:51:19 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @hellofrmSG sure it might, but who do we know who can fill up the void? And do we as Singaporeans have patience to let them learn?
794174525051015169 2016-11-03 13:48:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG case in point, a 5-0 rout of the admittedly weakened defending champions Brunei DPMM FC:https://youtu.be/4AWsVxE6pvE
794173659749326848 2016-11-03 13:45:30 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual @GaryKLH no, I agree, but it's nice to wonder anyway. :)
794169768055959552 2016-11-03 13:30:02 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual would be good to see, but I don't know if our local pros are as pliable... or if #sleague club admins are willing.
794166914385723392 2016-11-03 13:18:41 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter Siri plus autocorrect... "no, no, transfer 3000 to brother from another mother, not udder under other"
794166161516548096 2016-11-03 13:15:42 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld aligning with @hellofrmSG. Nice :) I wonder what other #rocur around the world are wrestling fans. Do they have local promotions?
794164937740296192 2016-11-03 13:10:50 UTC <icedwater> @PeopleOfUK im jelly
794164387057500160 2016-11-03 13:08:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG they did worse than I'd expected, but when they were on form they were pretty intimidating.
794152127442497537 2016-11-03 12:19:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I think this is one of the few good things about multi-purpose and centrally-owned stadia that needs to be pointed out more.
794151407590850560 2016-11-03 12:17:04 UTC <icedwater> @tocsg please find some time to proofread articles before they are released... you're doing good work but the errors are jarring.
794147658457698304 2016-11-03 12:02:10 UTC <icedwater> @StyleDragoon @hellofrmSG @AdamFlinter it's a chicken and egg issue. But long term planning and disciplined execution are needed.
794146671911276544 2016-11-03 11:58:15 UTC <icedwater> @zomgitsashok @hellofrmSG @frhn @esti_d I think that's a red herring though, EPL used to be shown live on free TV in the 90s, as I recall...
794146387944345600 2016-11-03 11:57:08 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I don't remember actually supporting Gombak United when they were near me. But now I'm leaning to Home for various reasons.
794145957969477632 2016-11-03 11:55:25 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG keep your fingers lightly crossed, they might somehow find enough funding to come back...
794145371337261056 2016-11-03 11:53:05 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm the same, but I am back with English football for a bit so that I could play fantasy premier league to see what works
794144944449409024 2016-11-03 11:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG actually it would be like retweeting #JFT96 because all the other Liverpool fans are doing it
794143351444381696 2016-11-03 11:45:04 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 wah why
794118238028210177 2016-11-03 10:05:16 UTC <icedwater> Hopefully #sgfootball doesn't have to wait that long https://twitter.com/tabletmag/status/793967204186390528
794117926303383553 2016-11-03 10:04:02 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG what to do? We are encouraged to see ourselves as second-rate and to always learn from foreign experts.
794072639249780736 2016-11-03 07:04:05 UTC <icedwater> @PeopleOfUK test test are you OK
794071632268689408 2016-11-03 07:00:04 UTC <icedwater> Sometimes I wonder, "what makes us human?"  Then the tap works, and I wash my hands of the matter.
794055875589795840 2016-11-02 05:57:28 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG about-turn. I'd say tweener 
794049850111356929 2016-11-02 05:33:31 UTC <icedwater> true, Tory education would have cost enough to get this right and never allowed Greeks in in the first place @GreekGeordie
794048399196700672 2016-11-02 05:27:45 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname good, then you're ready for a turn as @hellofrmSG 
794014324293386241 2016-11-02 03:12:21 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv are they called filibustards?
793982256448700416 2016-11-02 01:04:56 UTC <icedwater> @erikrjoh I don't know why you'd extrapolate that much -- nobody said it wasn't important for anybody else @bmastenbrook @Andrea_Joh
793981248758759428 2016-11-02 01:00:55 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @hellofrmSG steady lah! #SpeakGoodSinglish
793980306789466116 2016-11-02 00:57:11 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @hellofrmSG then we got to hurry up and learn lor. Singlish also.
793978721191546880 2016-11-02 00:50:53 UTC <icedwater> @CurateZar .@EmmaJBengtsson @sweden also, @twt_malaysia, @CurateZAR, @CurateZim, @We_Japan as far as I know. Pretty sure there was a Thai one too...
793975541372256261 2016-11-02 00:38:15 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling many debutants have been known to fade out after becoming a... Curt Hawkins!!! #FaceTheFacts
793793094579658752 2016-11-02 12:33:16 UTC <icedwater> @avalon unfortunately a receptionist is probably the most obvious use of Q&A system you can find. Folliwed by a tour guide or a concierge.
793790013255233536 2016-11-02 12:21:01 UTC <icedwater> @eisen no good pun can go unpunished.
793783535924486145 2016-11-02 11:55:17 UTC <icedwater> @joelynalexandra I was only there a few times, I remember the eubiq power bars but otherwise nothing much... did you hang out there a lot?
793781490790178817 2016-11-02 11:47:09 UTC <icedwater> @eisen lol
793623811736219648 2016-11-01 01:20:36 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify were you getting those before?
793623176924114944 2016-11-01 01:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @PeopleOfUK who sold the idea of home as investment? It seems to have caught on here too.
793522104415035392 2016-11-01 18:36:27 UTC <icedwater> This klpudding thing sounds interesting. Wonder what was used before soy sauce got there? Thanks @sweden, @lemterbyhttps://twitter.com/lemterby/status/793452293119176704
793521123891646464 2016-11-01 18:32:33 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM go to the Southern Islands. It'll tide you over.
793517774635008001 2016-11-01 18:19:14 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @dcatdemon @joleeqh I suspect that's only a thing because that mall is empty enough not to smell of humans...
793498856059133952 2016-11-01 17:04:04 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz which coach will lose their job with Hougang next season them?
793498064551948289 2016-11-01 17:00:55 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I liked Osnabrck and Mnster, but I lived in the former so I'm biased. Nrnberg has the legendary market apparently. Berlin?
793496207737835520 2016-11-01 16:53:33 UTC <icedwater> yup! He was pinned by Eurasian Dragon (TED is easier to write) for the #SGChamp title. :(
793494475834138624 2016-11-01 16:46:40 UTC <icedwater> zzz dunbelif is tru
793493981636157442 2016-11-01 16:44:42 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold I didn't know Capitaland Malls had a smell...
793472439942471680 2016-11-01 15:19:06 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT too awsome for words.
793472099960492032 2016-11-01 15:17:45 UTC <icedwater> Dick in a couple days and then you will have a good day please see the attachment for your time to time but it was https://twitter.com/swapoutsus/status/793128087798022145
793469841239715841 2016-11-01 15:08:46 UTC <icedwater> @thenewsminute you won't believe no. 3.
793461373950754816 2016-11-01 14:35:08 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan @avalon yeah. Don't know. Reviving traditions that we never otherwise bothered with? It's like the bell bottoms of linguistics.
793457233044484097 2016-11-01 14:18:40 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 oh the clan association. Quite bizarre, eh? Completely changes the cheena vibe of the place.
793455194184921089 2016-11-01 14:10:34 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 hmm Kg Ubi CC? I like that place, but the queue going in is terrible...
793401091215937536 2016-11-01 10:35:35 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 it's done! I think all that @heelstatement support has reduced you to a whimpering whelp. You ought to learn from Abang Footnote.
793397436781727744 2016-11-01 10:21:04 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 awww thanks, but we should meet at an SPW show 
793396502781579264 2016-11-01 10:17:21 UTC <icedwater> @heelstatement @hellofrmSG @mdzulkar9 i trie evrytim
793396364587651072 2016-11-01 10:16:48 UTC <icedwater> @mdzulkar9 what are you, six years old? Or Donald Trump? Looks like I need to change my webhost. :/
793393641922322432 2016-11-01 10:05:59 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter aaaaaaaaaaagghhhgghhhhhhhhhhkkkkkk @mdzulkar9 @hellofrmSG @heelstatement
793389083779215360 2016-11-01 09:47:52 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @mdzulkar9 this is exactly the kind of STOOPIDITY that a @heelstatement fan would stoop to, stop trying to disTrexxus.
793388709479493632 2016-11-01 09:46:23 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay although security researchers would be more credible, and they happen to be computer scientists who work in security...
793365103865241601 2016-11-01 08:12:35 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay my main objection is that the term "Computer Scientists" was used. Not "security researchers" or something?
793364592470536192 2016-11-01 08:10:33 UTC <icedwater> @stjepansejic (hugs)
793253194734247936 2016-10-31 00:47:54 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yeah it's probably a better site than http://www.spw.com.sg let's be honest  @SgProWrestling gotta up your game! 
793252954560077825 2016-10-31 00:46:56 UTC <icedwater> @heelstatement @hellofrmSG @mdzulkar9 that's because your STOOPID!
793252856086274048 2016-10-31 00:46:33 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hate to break it to you, but Ladykiller left the building a while ago... I think he's based in MYPW these days?
793252602339176448 2016-10-31 00:45:32 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @elmyra @interchris for the RT and @Sonic_Screwup for the thread. Something for conservatives to think about.https://twitter.com/Sonic_Screwup/status/793111395156058113
793103704995930113 2016-10-31 14:53:53 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I'm not sure she needs to fit your expectations :p
793099698093502464 2016-10-31 14:37:57 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH don't forget there were fewer games this season. Small anomalies like the Pennant effect will drive the average up a lot.
793097808203046912 2016-10-31 14:30:27 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @GaryKLH #gojerdontscared
793097418690572288 2016-10-31 14:28:54 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon alias fwin also, it's shorter :p
793095622341439488 2016-10-31 14:21:46 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner age catching up with you eh?
793090517059895297 2016-10-31 14:01:28 UTC <icedwater> @MalmstrmJonas @sweden @FruJonsson it's a quality that comes in handy in the game as well, as a DM or a player! :)
793089126375395328 2016-10-31 13:55:57 UTC <icedwater> @sweden which other systems have you tried? I only know 5e for DnD. I've been mudding years on @aardmud though!
793050490900664320 2016-10-31 11:22:25 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan no, I mean if you tap in for others without going in yourself. I suppose nobody has done that, anyway.
793038198045745152 2016-10-31 10:33:35 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan what happens on the train pass if you don't tap out ah?
793036880539295745 2016-10-31 10:28:20 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA woi. #sleague not hot enough for you ah.
793002450487681024 2016-10-31 08:11:32 UTC <icedwater> @liangkaixin @AppleSupport because deciphering visible messages is not hard enough.
792936851979902976 2016-10-30 03:50:52 UTC <icedwater> @khalinotcharlie hello! I've seen you before. Were you WeRWorld at some point...?
792894223779442688 2016-10-30 01:01:28 UTC <icedwater> On Comey's releases, here's @joshtpm:https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/792753623553966080
792772457316831232 2016-10-30 16:57:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofromsg @bearybernie @iampinch after so many quay I like go Havelock food centre eat pi dan porridge first. Then take bus 51 until JE 
792771407134330880 2016-10-30 16:53:27 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA meh meh! nana nana nana nana nana nana nana nana MEH MEH!
792771247448829953 2016-10-30 16:52:49 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic nah, just an extrapolation from our conversation till now :)
792769541868654592 2016-10-30 16:46:02 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @iampinch @bearybernie Lim Chu Kang farms, Science Centre, MBS (to watch pokemon hunters), Southern Ridges, Fullerton, Stadium..
792768651552169984 2016-10-30 16:42:30 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic despite your best efforts to educate by throwing random news and views together, I suppose.
792767497984499716 2016-10-30 16:37:55 UTC <icedwater> Also, as @WeRWorld shifts mid-week, I only got one weekend, whereas @hellofrmSG hands over on Saturday night. Different moods, I suppose.
792766520996696064 2016-10-30 16:34:02 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo that's why the asterisk... hahaha 
792766055969988608 2016-10-30 16:32:11 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic the burden of your insight is too much for me to bear. I'm having trouble verifying all your charges :)
792765002478256128 2016-10-30 16:28:00 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Johor Bahru. We used to visit on weekends fairly often growing up. These days, pretty much only during Chinese New Year.
792764603629350913 2016-10-30 16:26:25 UTC <icedwater> @eisen I'm seldom this direct but especially since your name is a German word, I had to check if you remember what "das Lied" means... ;)
792764189517361152 2016-10-30 16:24:46 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld well, topics had to differ, @hellofrmSG allowed more local context. Different interaction for sure, down to the trolling I think?
792742322396024832 2016-10-30 14:57:52 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA also can #stopthebear
792742039129509888 2016-10-30 14:56:45 UTC <icedwater> twice as @hellofrmSG, once as @WeRWorld, had fun every time. Learned a lot about interaction and ignoring (some) subtweets :)
792741467332579329 2016-10-30 14:54:28 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG my mum was a Malaysian Chinese, my dad a Singaporean Chinese. Does that count? 
792741185039192065 2016-10-30 14:53:21 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA you only cover penguins I thought
792740750697992193 2016-10-30 14:51:38 UTC <icedwater> @yasminzaini @hellofrmSG those places still have older buildings (1920s-1930s) I like Outram too... Jurong? The biggest change of 'e mall.
792740425123540992 2016-10-30 14:50:20 UTC <icedwater> @Ryaihanny @leonkohj how about 26th December CNY music?
792740121082671104 2016-10-30 14:49:07 UTC <icedwater> @kaliandkalki have to agree with this tweet. We have been historically a Malay country.
792739260642111488 2016-10-30 14:45:42 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Everymonthmustgotholi Day. 3rd Monday of July.
792738664237322241 2016-10-30 14:43:20 UTC <icedwater> @GodlovesU2016 @envanligtrist @sweden that's upholding freedom of speech right there :p
792738531571490816 2016-10-30 14:42:48 UTC <icedwater> @sweden there are quite a few Christians in Egypt too, though... 13/85 apparently. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria#Demographics
792736702871638016 2016-10-30 14:35:32 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi @cstross ah hmm. May also explain "das Mdchen". I wonder what it is the diminutive of...
792736406955143168 2016-10-30 14:34:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @yasminzaini Don't go Orchard and Boat Quay still got lots to see. Geylang, Bugis, Little India, Chinatown, Botanic Gardens...
792735818427138049 2016-10-30 14:32:02 UTC <icedwater> @bearybernie @hellofrmSG I think we don't think much of our own cool places eh... is that a Singaporean thing? Somehow I think not...
792734899044098050 2016-10-30 14:28:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG let's organise a tweetup at the next @SgProWrestling event! Were you at #SPWTropicalStorm?
792731268551024641 2016-10-30 14:13:57 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake dunno why this was in the YA section at Kino Bugis. https://goo.gl/images/SGTyYC
792730413592481792 2016-10-30 14:10:33 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @JihadiJew which society, what young people, and numbing how...
792730141222801412 2016-10-30 14:09:28 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock oops forgot my friends already just came back from Bangkok  paiseh.
792710986184597505 2016-10-30 12:53:21 UTC <icedwater> @FoluOyefeso iDunno
792710668210188289 2016-10-30 12:52:05 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock better don't buy. Wait everybody also want to fly your aeroplane...
792706694522429440 2016-10-30 12:36:18 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim aka balik kampung siapa?
792706074260365312 2016-10-30 12:33:50 UTC <icedwater> @nayanikaaa @adamliaw @Vishycr then you're missing out on all the tempura goodness. Mmm... batter.
792692653083152384 2016-10-30 11:40:30 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz maybe this is the Real Escape Game...
792665323765760001 2016-10-30 09:51:54 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock got your help yet?
792661532102365184 2016-10-30 09:36:50 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic by the way, what *did* Bush get away with?
792661244155080704 2016-10-30 09:35:42 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic I see lots of straw lying around from the straw men you've been beating.
792580172767645696 2016-10-29 04:13:33 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic maybe. Is your tinfoil helmet snug?
792579766033326080 2016-10-29 04:11:56 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic I didn't whine and I won't. Why should I?
792575455983316992 2016-10-29 03:54:48 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic yes, but that doesn't make your actions not terrorism.
792573557804892160 2016-10-29 03:47:16 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH it's also the reporter's or editor's choice to include the quotes, let's be honest.
792573373574361088 2016-10-29 03:46:32 UTC <icedwater> @pennant83 tough last game. Did you ever feel like the club knew how to value you?
792572852629147649 2016-10-29 03:44:28 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch glad you knew how to protect yourself... shame that special occasions bring out the worst in some.
792572111625871360 2016-10-29 03:41:31 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic this is terrorism and you know it. You're your own nation's worst enemy.
792571425651470337 2016-10-29 03:38:47 UTC <icedwater> @UnixToolTip @mattblaze they didn't have to pay. They just threatened to rename to E.
792570844840988673 2016-10-29 03:36:29 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic speaking out doesn't require abuse first and content later; it doesn't require abuse at all.
792570446541488130 2016-10-29 03:34:54 UTC <icedwater> @amaditalks sorry, fell for the distraction. Let me read more...
792569154763051008 2016-10-29 03:29:46 UTC <icedwater> @JayQPublic what do you gain from this anonymous abuse of  @JoyAnnReid?
792567578384142337 2016-10-29 03:23:30 UTC <icedwater> Looking forward to more @JoyAnnReid tomorrow, but for now this will have to do. Thanks @heathercorinna for the RT.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/792438686784823296
792566271761985537 2016-10-29 03:18:19 UTC <icedwater> @amaditalks @TriciaWegmann77 it is primarily a security issue, but it was greatly helped by underlying gender and race issues.
792402110411186177 2016-10-29 16:25:59 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH if they had returned to the league as a single team, this would have been a valid comparison...
792401714208878593 2016-10-29 16:24:25 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA sold their soul? Nah, @ALB_S_FC are showing the way for #sgfootball. No clubs are following though.
792400464763457539 2016-10-29 16:19:27 UTC <icedwater> @elmyra do you have a Mr. Mime already? I might just continue playing until I get them all...
792396926100512768 2016-10-29 16:05:23 UTC <icedwater> you keep using that word. I don't think you really know what it means.
792395727850778626 2016-10-29 16:00:38 UTC <icedwater> @sweden well, I'm only doing so to see whether I should block you before I go to bed. Enjoy your weekend :)
792394445555535872 2016-10-29 15:55:32 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH so he should have started and injured himself on his final game in Singapore?
792393981141233664 2016-10-29 15:53:41 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti gongxi gongxi 
792392183189876736 2016-10-29 15:46:33 UTC <icedwater> hi, are you stalking @sweden to jump in at random points with insults? You must have long commutes...
792390935275462657 2016-10-29 15:41:35 UTC <icedwater> @nigelchin @dazhan14 we have to remember that #sleageu clubs are independent entities and have their own circumstances to work out.
792390509100531712 2016-10-29 15:39:53 UTC <icedwater> Loved #SPWTropicalStorm. But @SgProWrestling please try not to pick a hashtag that could mess up emergency rescue :phttps://twitter.com/SgProWrestling/status/792309428695408640
792356028801126400 2016-10-29 13:22:53 UTC <icedwater> he's not my buddy and you're not my bro, goodbye :)
792336820570693632 2016-10-29 12:06:33 UTC <icedwater> @Anglo_Von_Trapp I knew it :)
792336121174724612 2016-10-29 12:03:46 UTC <icedwater> I hereby award you 10 Smackdown! Points. Please claim your prize at the counter. @no_genius
792335039090393089 2016-10-29 11:59:28 UTC <icedwater> .@Anglo_Von_Trapp that speaks poorly of your education system, or my ability to spot satire, or both 
792326513223802881 2016-10-29 11:25:36 UTC <icedwater> it was apparent to me from the outset :)
792308890671026176 2016-10-29 10:15:34 UTC <icedwater> was*, ugh. Hate typos.
792308216810004480 2016-10-29 10:12:53 UTC <icedwater> at the very least, it wad a conversation. Still irrelevant.
792308017974824960 2016-10-29 10:12:06 UTC <icedwater> The local daily said this was equivalent to an estimated three meals a day for 11 million people.https://twitter.com/TODAYonline/status/792289879627411456
792306347966541824 2016-10-29 10:05:28 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti performing or just kiasu rehearsal?
792305945699164161 2016-10-29 10:03:52 UTC <icedwater> this is relevant to the discussion how?
792305537920622592 2016-10-29 10:02:15 UTC <icedwater> @Craicerjack also, just re-read your tweet. Yes, @trytradesmart may have misrepresented @sweden, but two wrongs don't make a right.
792305154825478144 2016-10-29 10:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @Craicerjack nope, @Jolick said @trytradesmart disliked a smart @sweden. You can be smug and superior without being smart...
792286513899843584 2016-10-29 08:46:39 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake ah, on your way back already?
792286355334148097 2016-10-29 08:46:01 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @eisen would you rather watch the musical, Anne Lied?
792279938455842816 2016-10-29 08:20:31 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane @DMC1982Nice duck rice is OK too *chickens out*
792279786399764480 2016-10-29 08:19:55 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi need to add more explosions and car chases :p
792277917371731969 2016-10-29 08:12:29 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I'm disappointed you thought that was an error 
792265718372773888 2016-10-29 07:24:01 UTC <icedwater> @Jolick don't misrepresent @trytradesmart. I too liked @sweden run by @vantasvart too! But Katrin is all right :)
792264748335194112 2016-10-29 07:20:10 UTC <icedwater> @eisen #autocrattech
792264297955024897 2016-10-29 07:18:22 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake there I was thinking"xiao mei lemon" is some new drink...
792261121784807424 2016-10-29 07:05:45 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv argh, #poofreading: "During its seventy-first session in 2016 theGeneral Assembly will elected 14 members..."
792258834316292096 2016-10-28 06:56:40 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv apparently it's due to lack of competition. Maybe Singapore can run next year? 
792258262536159232 2016-10-28 06:54:23 UTC <icedwater> @TallahForTrump lol!
792257966401523712 2016-10-28 06:53:13 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 nah, they care about the fans, that's why they don't want to bore them on a public holiday...
792256367838924800 2016-10-28 06:46:52 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty one likes "STUPID" and the other likes Cola, so..
792250123614945280 2016-10-28 06:22:03 UTC <icedwater> @WWEDanielBryan @DrJillStein as though the banks and ratings agencies don't already have more power than certain nations.
792240113237368832 2016-10-28 05:42:16 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling #HIAC
792055024989900800 2016-10-28 17:26:48 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren neither language is my preferred or working one  maaaybe Zipkin if it helps for Android
792052853191827456 2016-10-28 17:18:10 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren need to figure out microservices and logging, myself. 
792031821965824000 2016-10-28 15:54:36 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz why not traditional 2-3-5 hehe
792014817607299072 2016-10-28 14:47:02 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @gubyrayle I'll come up with something soon, I hope. Let me see if I can buy the first issue first!
792011982400475136 2016-10-28 14:35:46 UTC <icedwater> Frois promises two events soon, in early Dec and late Jan... #SPWTropicalStorm what's this about a bigger arena?!pic.twitter.com/qNOZbi2rWr
792011164880293888 2016-10-28 14:32:31 UTC <icedwater> CIMA promises to return with Big R "Raichu" early next year. Because "I AM CIMA!" #StupidCola #SPWTropicalStorm
792010912269946880 2016-10-28 14:31:30 UTC <icedwater> Big R swung Statement into a low dropkick by CIMA, which was followed by a powerbomb into a boston crab  #StupidCola #SPWTropicalStorm
792010435008401412 2016-10-28 14:29:37 UTC <icedwater> But the few minutes before that were a flurry of innovative and frankly horrifying offence. #StupidCola #SPWTropicalStorm
792010098923012097 2016-10-28 14:28:17 UTC <icedwater> Finally, all it took for CIMA and Big R to pick up the win was a top rope splash on Statement. #SPWTropicalStorm #StupidCola
792009646978412544 2016-10-28 14:26:29 UTC <icedwater> Jaw-dropping exchange! Main event stuff #SPWTropicalStorm #StupidCola
792008905328996352 2016-10-28 14:23:32 UTC <icedwater> How does Statement still have ribs after that double knee drop from CIMA, and a top rope double knee from R? #StupidCola #SPWTropicalStorm

792004311257522178 2016-10-28 14:05:17 UTC <icedwater> CIMA and Statement open the match #StupidCola #SPWTropicalStorm. Duel of speed and strength!
792003904682590208 2016-10-28 14:03:40 UTC <icedwater> Assertive referee is assertive. Sodiq sends Destroyer Dharma to the back to make this #SPWvDDT #StupidCola match 2 vs 2! #SPWTropicalStorm

792002183717715972 2016-10-28 13:56:49 UTC <icedwater> A spear only gets two, but Alexis has won the crowd over tonight! ...before the inevitable Matsumoto win. #AlexisMatsu #SPWTropicalStorm

791985994698330112 2016-10-28 12:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter too much of it was outside the ring. There was only a short duel with Dragon in the ring, that was OK
791985720575393792 2016-10-28 12:51:24 UTC <icedwater> Both participants get #Deepavali chants, but that quickly turns to boos as Dharma tosses Ranga aside. #SPWTropicalStorm #GMChoice
791985360423137280 2016-10-28 12:49:58 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter a little bit
791985257511686144 2016-10-28 12:49:34 UTC <icedwater> Statement doing the honours to introduce Destroyer Dharma while Rowdy Ranga looks on. #SPWTropicalStorm #GMChoicepic.twitter.com/qEkF9H7lBU

791984484551757824 2016-10-28 12:46:30 UTC <icedwater> Too short for a #SGChamp match at 8 minutes, but kudos for improving so much, Dragon! #SPWTropicalStormpic.twitter.com/2QM3Rh7k5m

791977245883535360 2016-10-28 12:17:44 UTC <icedwater> A high-octane opening sees Aiden and Cuevo the only ones standing, until Sayn tries to sneak a quick pinfall! #Fatal5Way #SPWTropicalStorm

791970358056263681 2016-10-28 11:50:22 UTC <icedwater> Apparently it's Mr. Sodiq's birthday today? Missed taking a picture though. Room almost full now, about 30 seats left? #SPWTropicalStorm
791969854597193728 2016-10-28 11:48:22 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling @dazhan14 come to the next one! 
791967745373908992 2016-10-28 11:39:59 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM are you in Toa Payoh now? There might still be tickets  I have a $25 back row seat  @SgProWrestling
791967106875035651 2016-10-28 11:37:26 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling @JuriaTRM next issue of @mynahmag maybe? ;)
791966439016062979 2016-10-28 11:34:47 UTC <icedwater> Probably gonna shift #TropicalStorm  to #SPWTropicalStorm. Don't want to  mess up critical updates. @SgProWrestlingpic.twitter.com/xQAEWaZQTP
791965922869129216 2016-10-28 11:32:44 UTC <icedwater> It'll be better once they sort out ticket collection, but I'm happy to be in after just 5 minutes. Go @SgProWrestling! #TropicalStorm
791965198097592320 2016-10-28 11:29:51 UTC <icedwater> So @SgProWrestling are trying a new entry method, opening the side doors at #TropicalStorm. Two queues means everyone gets in faster, right?
791964355256459264 2016-10-28 11:26:30 UTC <icedwater> The usual pre-entry queue is here at @SgProWrestling #TropicalStorm. How many title changes will we see tonight? #fbpic.twitter.com/oXoUz5ObGD
791946129894027267 2016-10-28 10:14:05 UTC <icedwater> @avalon both I suppose, but I see tolak on doors :p
791945368262971392 2016-10-28 10:11:04 UTC <icedwater> @avalon push I think?
791882417606758400 2016-10-27 06:00:55 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @dazhan14 I was referring to - hmm. Season opener also count ah
791813538247352320 2016-10-27 01:27:13 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter yup. I'd be glad to chat with you about your experience at grassroots level sometime :)
791813316897144832 2016-10-27 01:26:20 UTC <icedwater> That frees up tonight to support another "unprofitable venture", @SgProWrestling #TropicalStorm, 7.30pm at Toa Payoh (venue: sfcca.sg) #fb
791812542293155840 2016-10-27 01:23:15 UTC <icedwater> Also, I've just been reminded that the #RHBSingaporeCup final is tomorrow instead. Whoops 
791812056433373184 2016-10-27 01:21:20 UTC <icedwater> That's something the FAS are yet to achieve, since our society has no patience for "unprofitable" careers. Mindsets need to change.
791811259792371712 2016-10-27 01:18:10 UTC <icedwater> Of course, @ALB_S_FC draw trialists from a technically sound Japanese population, the likes of which we are yet to emulate on that scale.
791810248029769728 2016-10-27 01:14:08 UTC <icedwater> To be fair, unlike Etoile, @ALB_S_FC have been building up to this since 2003. Exemplary development on limited funds. #sleague must learn.
791809507898687488 2016-10-27 01:11:12 UTC <icedwater> With @FootballSLEAGUE offices in direct view of the #RHBSingaporeCup final between @ALB_S_FC and @MightyStags, this could be a vital spark.
791808980628627456 2016-10-27 01:09:06 UTC <icedwater> @ALB_S_FC Tonight could mark a new #sleague low: from an Etoile double in 2010 to a potential treble for @alb_s_fc over strongest rivals @MightyStags.
791667809092669440 2016-10-27 15:48:08 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose end-of-term Obama.
791667635310071808 2016-10-27 15:47:27 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @j_benect @herr_skoog ooh also check out @We_Love_Aural for music #rocur :)
791652917530857472 2016-10-27 14:48:58 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ keep guessing :)
791585896294342656 2016-10-27 10:22:39 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards also, they don't have to start playing CNY music that early! In general, I mean... @k_santhi @kiampah @tanhuiyi
791585731470700544 2016-10-27 10:21:59 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi @kiampah @k_santhi @bargeboards @x_ai but Centrepoint was awesome in the 90s and before too.
791585405216837633 2016-10-27 10:20:42 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi if we start decor at the beginning of Dec as @bargeboards suggests, maybe setup can be early Nov? Curious about turnaround time.
791584759390625793 2016-10-27 10:18:08 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai agreed. But @k_santhi has a point too. Btw @tanhuiyi, how long does it take to tear down?
791577783155630080 2016-10-27 09:50:24 UTC <icedwater> @ALB_S_FC Wow @MightyStags, with that 5-1 win over @alb_s_fc, you really made the goal difference look competitive... @Sleagueofficial
791576657081405442 2016-10-27 09:45:56 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring @jkhr_ if that labour were shared, both could grow, and contribute to household income.
791568705062744065 2016-10-27 09:14:20 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi with the tech advances we have now, can implementation and testing be carried out faster? Or have modular decorations...
791564313634803712 2016-10-27 08:56:53 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi they don't bother with Deepavali plus Christmas is more like CNY for us. It's not early, but not right...
791446100817293312 2016-10-26 01:07:09 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede @JoeDayspring @LeoToAquarius again, I'm yet to see it enforced.
791445726878322690 2016-10-26 01:05:40 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede an actual right would be as defined by the UN? Sure, women have them. I'm not sure about in practice though.
791444588636442625 2016-10-26 01:01:08 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede @JoeDayspring @LeoToAquarius probably, yeah. Snogging is fine, I'd think - haven't heard of any arrests or warnings for that.
791444308092067840 2016-10-26 01:00:02 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede @JoeDayspring I see you have trouble reading :) That's fine.
791441439360098304 2016-10-26 00:48:38 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede don't flatter yourselves. I'm only bothering to engage now because I have nothing to do on the commute.
791441191732596736 2016-10-26 00:47:39 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede @JoeDayspring don't be silly. We have many gay people here and it's absolutely safe. You're welcome any time :)
791440763351511041 2016-10-26 00:45:56 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede because nobody is fighting with me on Twitter about the other things :)
791439643413655552 2016-10-26 00:41:29 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede so one video in NYC is supposed to prove that all men everywhere are liable to being catcalled?
791437667770638336 2016-10-26 00:33:38 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede to go down streets without unwanted compliment from a stranger?
791322581571776512 2016-10-26 16:56:20 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @mynahmag @eisen and I quote, "TGVNOT SUCCULENT".
791321414758338560 2016-10-26 16:51:41 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld definitely go on a Battle Box tour with @eisen and tell me if I should check it out myself ;)
791320956731928576 2016-10-26 16:49:52 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld ...or you could spend a day in the city centre and Fort Canning Park wondering where the view in my Twitter header has gone ;)
791320696265723904 2016-10-26 16:48:50 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld ...which is not far from the Botanic Gardens. If nature is your thing, there's forest reserves and island life to soak in too...
791320112401821696 2016-10-26 16:46:31 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld ...then past the Central Library up to the New Asia Bar on level 69 for a free panorama. Or Ion Sky in the shopping district...
791319406433271808 2016-10-26 16:43:43 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld from the Stadium to Old Airport Road for hawker food, then down to the Malay cultural area in Kampong Glam and Sultan Mosque...
791318046954622976 2016-10-26 16:38:19 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld well, within *this* week there's Deepavali, festival of lights, so Little India. Fire-walking festival just done. WTA Finals on.
791315247176876033 2016-10-26 16:27:11 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM congrats, but.. succulent!  @whyvo
791314764907487232 2016-10-26 16:25:16 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @JuriaTRM how is that possible:(:(
791312649820581888 2016-10-26 16:16:52 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld Singapore! There's so much to see and do here. How long would you have?
791234852385280000 2016-10-26 11:07:43 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ the thing is, it's not just the big battles that matter. Chipping away at mindsets is an important fight too, just less glamorous.
791219413655486464 2016-10-26 10:06:23 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling yeah it doesn't look good eh. But the mic/in-ring duel would be great.
791218738804568064 2016-10-26 10:03:42 UTC <icedwater> @bearybernie I have akismet and it works great for spam. Been paying a subscription for a while now, but my blog is low traffic so...
791214815867830272 2016-10-26 09:48:06 UTC <icedwater> @AlexaBliss_WWE @pplofwrestling and @RealPaigeWWE feud please :):)
791175940252446720 2016-10-26 07:13:38 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring oh, I see, this is a classic "You're the puppet" gambit.
791141354109829120 2016-10-25 04:56:12 UTC <icedwater> @JoeDayspring @SqueakySwede sure, feel free.
791140818564308992 2016-10-25 04:54:04 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring feel free to generalise from your specific case to the world :)
791111787240235008 2016-10-25 02:58:42 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring I'd take that if we can help to break the patriarchy. :)
791111475259592704 2016-10-25 02:57:28 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring yup, we men have time to advance our careers because of women's unpaid work.
791110687497920512 2016-10-25 02:54:20 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede enjoy your imaginary alpha benefits. :)
791097724040908800 2016-10-25 02:02:49 UTC <icedwater> @mmozuras signed up for your talk tonight but won't be able to make it now. Sorry! I'll try to unsubscribe. Hope it's recorded.
791095561927602176 2016-10-25 01:54:14 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede you're entitled to your opinion. It's clear this isn't going any further. If you want Internet points, you can have mine.
791095362496765953 2016-10-25 01:53:26 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring sigh. I'm beginning to appreciate why some women call us men stupid...
791095144271314949 2016-10-25 01:52:34 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring you're forgetting the part where two people make a baby. If both work, who cares for it?
791094856009392128 2016-10-25 01:51:26 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring I've seen women working in construction in China, by the way.
791092390492672000 2016-10-25 01:41:38 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring @TheQubvo you should be. Didn't your dad pay you for it?
791092205427404800 2016-10-25 01:40:54 UTC <icedwater> @JDefiant9 @caeruleusV and you've spoken with every one of them to verify this?
791092035633549312 2016-10-25 01:40:13 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring "controlling" is a choice some households choose to make, and not all do.
791091753994506240 2016-10-25 01:39:06 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring raising children + housework is a choice women take only because someone has to.
791091151356821504 2016-10-25 01:36:42 UTC <icedwater> @EmergencyBattle sorry for the spam. I'll try to remember to untag you :p
791090791988858880 2016-10-25 01:35:17 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid lol I don't even know what that means. Rematch unification whuttttt
791090538657124352 2016-10-25 01:34:16 UTC <icedwater> we should all be decent human beings. Regardless of recognition.
791089509957939200 2016-10-25 01:30:11 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring sure, everything that doesn't agree with your world view is a puff piece.
791088896859738112 2016-10-25 01:27:45 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede "womansplaining" is baseless and sexist. "Mansplaining" is a new term for something that's been going on for decades.
791088737295802368 2016-10-25 01:27:07 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede of course you would ignore evidence that isn't in your favour.
791088554956816384 2016-10-25 01:26:23 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring have we tried to pay them for that labour, then?
791088027753820162 2016-10-25 01:24:18 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring nobody has to force women to do jobs they don't want. Do we let women do jobs they want?
791087775642624000 2016-10-25 01:23:18 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-27/women-hit-glass-ceiling-early-as-men-get-manager-roles-faster
791087254902976512 2016-10-25 01:21:13 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede sure, anecdotes are not data, but you can't even find anecdotes supporting "womansplaining".
791086057072660480 2016-10-25 01:16:28 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring also, control for historical, cultural, and biological factors leading to this imbalance.
791083226911518721 2016-10-25 01:05:13 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @James_May_Not @JoeDayspring since you like averages, why not compute an average hourly wage for the average man/woman?
791082899592183808 2016-10-25 01:03:55 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede "give me something concrete, maybe" is a call for evidence, no?
791082668582580230 2016-10-25 01:03:00 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede conversations have been changed forever. They're no longer just reserved for men with the loudest voices. Learn to listen.
791082473727733760 2016-10-25 01:02:13 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede lol
791080255066738688 2016-10-25 00:53:25 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring @James_May_Not no, oversimplifying facts is silly :)
791079688294637568 2016-10-25 00:51:09 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring lol! Indeed.
791079406693339136 2016-10-25 00:50:02 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede it wasn't cited as a coherent argument. You wanted real-life examples, I linked you to some. You're in denial.
791079254540767232 2016-10-25 00:49:26 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede more like our world has started sequestering itself into bubbles more obviously. Have a nice life!
791078722799415296 2016-10-25 00:47:19 UTC <icedwater> @anhilden @sweden @ullamiettunen well, we have a national sauna, "Outdoors", which everyone avoids by getting into air-conditioned places 
791078258217365504 2016-10-25 00:45:28 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon is that like a PPAP of Sanchez and the Ox?
791077842582773761 2016-10-25 00:43:49 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @JoeDayspring lol stats please
791077353069830144 2016-10-25 00:41:53 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede likewise, you're entitled to your opinion. But feel free to ask actual women around you about it :) @EmergencyBattle
791076962093502464 2016-10-25 00:40:19 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia Jurong Lake is more subtle, it's an urban tech testbed. But there's Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, and Science Centre nearby too.
791076546056302593 2016-10-25 00:38:40 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia no problem! I guess I named areas that are more interesting for long-term residents here though. Let me know if I can show you :)
791075955297034240 2016-10-25 00:36:19 UTC <icedwater> @SqueakySwede feel free to find more examples like http://mansplaining.tumblr.com just by googling "mansplaining examples".
791075215019159552 2016-10-25 00:33:23 UTC <icedwater> @EmergencyBattle @SqueakySwede mansplaining does exist, unfortunately.
791067538809507840 2016-10-25 00:02:53 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia Lavender is a little further out, a mix of new and old with hipster cafes near traditional restorans. I like hackerspace.sg there.
791066806634942464 2016-10-25 23:59:58 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia Haji Lane is just a chill-out area close to town with cafes and pubs, maybe a live musician around the corner. Change of pace.
791065729848123392 2016-10-25 23:55:41 UTC <icedwater> @EmergencyBattle @SqueakySwede nobody would say that because it isn't a thing.
791065579352272896 2016-10-25 23:55:06 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ nope, women are also doing stuff about their situation. They just don't get any respect, which is kind of what prompted this thread.
791065322035945472 2016-10-25 23:54:04 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ that's not a crown you're wearing. It's just a really thick skull.
791064926622101504 2016-10-25 23:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ nope. You're wrong. They're first and foremost women who just happen to share a common trait - they cannot identify as white.
790966476345716736 2016-10-25 17:21:18 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ so... sporting legends are generally insane for still wanting to improve despite being the best?
790966275128176644 2016-10-25 17:20:30 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ I'm sorry, is there something you're trying to hide or deny? Have you spoken with women of colour about this recently?
790961710479716353 2016-10-25 17:02:21 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ well, too much chlorine can be a bad thing too. If a situation needs fixing, it needs fixing, regardless of how things are elsewhere.
790961226146656256 2016-10-25 17:00:26 UTC <icedwater> @jkhr_ you mean white women with a certain social status, right?
790960901943730176 2016-10-25 16:59:09 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia have you been walking around Haji Lane, Lavender, or the Jurong Lake District? Or even just Holland Village...
790947435581276161 2016-10-25 16:05:38 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat happy birthday! Tried to send you a DM but it failed silently or I missed the popup alert. Keep on writing :)
790946984282566656 2016-10-25 16:03:50 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill also, I still paste URLs minimally, removing the other arguments passed when I can. That keeps shares off the radar.
790946335012728832 2016-10-25 16:01:15 UTC <icedwater> @KirstenPowers @KSoltisAnderson @accessana66 until then...
790933708404510721 2016-10-25 15:11:05 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple app idea: tweet a bot our problems, like secret. They get RTed onto our timeline 2 days later by "someone else". Any egg account.
790932419608096769 2016-10-25 15:05:58 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan I think same breed one leh.
790918574193844224 2016-10-25 14:10:57 UTC <icedwater> @HacksHackersSG @alansoon haha thanks. Felt like it should be done.
790904341498515456 2016-10-25 13:14:23 UTC <icedwater> Running theme tonight was "all this tech is nice, but how does it help us make sense of things?" @HacksHackersSG
790904114892840961 2016-10-25 13:13:29 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple OK, sorry!
790903601107312640 2016-10-25 13:11:27 UTC <icedwater> Finally, (Trump Warning) http://bit.ly/2aaDnEa is another interesting application of data but it feels really experimental @HacksHackersSG
790901441997045763 2016-10-25 13:02:52 UTC <icedwater> On the other hand, @VslashR is a lot less impressed by http://multimedia.scmp.com/news/world/AsianAmerican/ What to do with this? @HacksHackersSGpic.twitter.com/wnUED5ErED

790898887259066369 2016-10-25 12:52:43 UTC <icedwater> Thomson Reuters' White House Run game (iOS only) allows you to create your own candidate http://reut.rs/1T4mOfA @HacksHackersSG
790898444034453505 2016-10-25 12:50:57 UTC <icedwater> Next thing: should we be making a news app? @VslashR says native functionality is the key reason to not just use websites. @HacksHackersSG
790897930685210624 2016-10-25 12:48:55 UTC <icedwater> @VslashR Also @vslashr is impressed by the detail that went into http://google.com/trends/story/election2016 totally engrossed  @HacksHackersSGpic.twitter.com/qPPDGp2wzn

790894132004728833 2016-10-25 12:33:49 UTC <icedwater> Panel wonders how so many journalists could work on this effort but @alansoon thinks it's worth it @HacksHackersSGpic.twitter.com/dSKDSuIpjK
790892797960138752 2016-10-25 12:28:31 UTC <icedwater> Not to mention fact-checking by journalists like http://n.pr/2e0aLRx who had a team working live @HacksHackersSGpic.twitter.com/vuRTtjPAwu
790891569788268545 2016-10-25 12:23:38 UTC <icedwater> Adding on such aspects as interruption timelines http://bit.ly/2eGGtBZ and scorecards http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-third-presidential-debate-scorecard/ is good too @HacksHackersSG
790890900758999041 2016-10-25 12:20:59 UTC <icedwater> Lie detectors are not legally admissible as evidence. But tech can be developed into useful tools later @HacksHackersSG #Debates2016
790888667539800064 2016-10-25 12:12:06 UTC <icedwater> Question from the audience about using emotion analysis as lie detector technology, since the panel agrees there is little editorial point.
790887630170836992 2016-10-25 12:07:59 UTC <icedwater> Here's @vivi_pazos of @HacksHackersSG on a panel discussion about #Debates2016 visualization http://qz.com/810092pic.twitter.com/bNgU28wvBY
790885123457626112 2016-10-25 11:58:02 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @jkhr_ that's what you think, but it's really polluted for some sectors. Others are just used to it.
790870396257996801 2016-10-25 10:59:30 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake the Emporium Strikes Back.
790869948839055360 2016-10-25 10:57:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname it's an adverb in this case, however. This is a case of good Singlish grammar. See also "play finish". 
790868474331484160 2016-10-25 10:51:52 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @jkhr_ even if you know of a country with no running water, you can complain if your water supply is polluted.
790867936676241408 2016-10-25 10:49:44 UTC <icedwater> @sweden that guy is just a troll, I'm sure. Or a Cave Man. I don't know. Humans help each other. What's wrong with needing help?
790867636133335040 2016-10-25 10:48:32 UTC <icedwater> you're not much of a man if you're offended by help offered. Reject, sure, but get offended? @envanligtrist @sweden
790865454071853056 2016-10-25 10:39:52 UTC <icedwater> @sweden @realmutttastic @EmergencyBattle @SqueakySwede no, I believe it only applies when men override a more or equally valid view.
790732450791948288 2016-10-24 01:51:22 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess I think ours do, though I'm not sure they're strictly software engineers. I see royalty challenge emails pass through sometimes
790727176555339776 2016-10-24 01:30:24 UTC <icedwater> @mavalia there might be something good at the ArtScience museum, too. Have you been here too often already? :)
790724462958157824 2016-10-24 01:19:37 UTC <icedwater> @WolfNilsson , counterexample for you thanks to @cosmic_latte___  @sweden @Victbarraz
790612610483793920 2016-10-24 17:55:09 UTC <icedwater> @sweden I got one "svenskrokurrmiracelworking". It means "being asked to translate the untranslatable by a demanding twitter fan" 
790611357427126272 2016-10-24 17:50:11 UTC <icedwater> Hmm related to what we were talking about earlier @woohuirenhttps://twitter.com/UnixToolTip/status/790593853342580736
790610814357024768 2016-10-24 17:48:01 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz what about finally playing football after waiting for so long 
790609746009010176 2016-10-24 17:43:46 UTC <icedwater> While this case is appalling, let's not get carried away and *expect* medals from the Olympics, import or otherwise.https://twitter.com/tocsg/status/790560236213985284
790608336928378880 2016-10-24 17:38:10 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz yeah UCL is better  #getwellsoon
790604911935299584 2016-10-24 17:24:34 UTC <icedwater> @sweden are the formal pronouns and attendant declinations still around though?
790603671654367232 2016-10-24 17:19:38 UTC <icedwater> @cloudywind @eisen dragonite has been known to appear around the area. But that tweet was more like dragodusk.
790603276131508224 2016-10-24 17:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG just by reading this tweet lol
790602850950754305 2016-10-24 17:16:23 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA maybe it's your bloody penguins 
790602281733410818 2016-10-24 17:14:07 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @thaifussballde sounds like a familiar situation eh!
790601466792730624 2016-10-24 17:10:53 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez after coming back from where you were, everything is busy lahhhh
790601332675579904 2016-10-24 17:10:21 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi tech++
790600978584055808 2016-10-24 17:08:56 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple don't think it's what I want either. Maybe old and tired, maybe sensible and careful, maybe conservative, maybe lazy. Who knows...
790587252652912641 2016-10-24 16:14:24 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold yep! Also, I still haven't learned to find context before jumping in. I'm glad we had this conversation though :p #mansplain
790573707156611073 2016-10-24 15:20:34 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold true, no point, but all changes will be seen by someone as non-improvements. Stupidity must persist before innovation comes.
790553759893983232 2016-10-24 14:01:18 UTC <icedwater> @queenintnorth let it be! It'd not last more than a week, right? @sweden @ireland
790553120866611200 2016-10-24 13:58:46 UTC <icedwater> Gotta remind myself sometimes. But running against the current is one way to make change, right? @ladystormholdhttps://twitter.com/ladystormhold/status/790496450140577792
790509776669057025 2016-10-24 11:06:32 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c yeah lol. I got this when I tried to load the gitlab site to show someone what it was. 
790507862170624000 2016-10-24 10:58:55 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale that's not magic. That's illusion. Which is already being done at FAS, when they bother.
790507651968839680 2016-10-24 10:58:05 UTC <icedwater> @LTAsg looking forward to it!
790507169955258368 2016-10-24 10:56:10 UTC <icedwater> @zombapocal those attitudes also exist within the British population, right?
790363369479950336 2016-10-23 01:24:46 UTC <icedwater> @zombapocal people make choices and they make mistakes. What if one of those British kids grows up to be an ax murderer one day?
790362947386126336 2016-10-23 01:23:05 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @jongaunt so women and children jihadis are fine to let through?
790362145334571008 2016-10-23 01:19:54 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren I guess with CI they could do a daily brew
790334830349127680 2016-10-23 23:31:21 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @JuliaAngwin! Here's activity control on mobile (http://myactivity.google.com) #fb https://twitter.com/ericuman/status/789466720197042177pic.twitter.com/dJa2TJ9trs
790329536403472384 2016-10-23 23:10:19 UTC <icedwater> Fascinating article about WikiLeaks. Pity it deadnames Chelsea Manning, though.https://twitter.com/AlGiordano/status/790243679428497409
790326862236876800 2016-10-23 22:59:42 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @leannalikescats @benjapoh maybe here it is...
790326387097817088 2016-10-23 22:57:48 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy yup! I know! 
790220680792903680 2016-10-23 15:57:46 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @RedDot_Oz it's not supposed to be Asian anyway...
790210551854997504 2016-10-23 15:17:31 UTC <icedwater> Please read this thread about tiering refugees and how it ties into our biases. Thanks @judeinlondon. https://twitter.com/judeinlondon/status/790138313336352768
790204179339882497 2016-10-23 14:52:12 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy have a good start on your fiftieth, please. Cheers :)

790065285294206976 2016-10-22 05:40:17 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG sorry no pic ;) but 6 foot skinny guy, tweety bird boxers, draped in toilet roll, standing on the pool table: quite memorable 
790064581297049600 2016-10-22 05:37:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG so one day one of the Turkish dudes celebrated his wedding at the bar... he got stripped down to boxers, dressed in toilet paper
790062243580739584 2016-10-22 05:28:12 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG wah... buried  got one scary drunk fight though. 2 Russian girls. One ripped down the (OK, old) bar door on the way out...
790061608601083904 2016-10-22 05:25:40 UTC <icedwater> @cmbsweden @sweden @JeSuisEnFlicka yes, but isn't that also their freedom...
790059002038280192 2016-10-22 05:15:19 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yup! Volunteered at a pub. Dealing with drunk students is extra fun :)
789899581500694529 2016-10-22 18:41:50 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA OMG where did the penguins go?!
789898890124234752 2016-10-22 18:39:05 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane is strong, too strong. Even clearer, the prophecy is unstoppable!!!11!1!!!1!1!
789866591546507264 2016-10-22 16:30:45 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren whut even
789866270409707520 2016-10-22 16:29:28 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice it's odd that I find myself having to agree with Captain Morgan!
789736534958149633 2016-10-22 07:53:57 UTC <icedwater> @0x00string ooo, OK. Thanks, I'll read up
789727577736749056 2016-10-22 07:18:21 UTC <icedwater> @JPY_Kurdish obviously Sweden should execute them instead, be like the strong Vikings they once were. Why not perpetuate the cycle of hate?

789712935895519232 2016-10-21 06:20:10 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I want life to be simpler too, but if everything else is progressing, our damn #sgfootball better keep up! ;)

789665252249964544 2016-10-21 03:10:42 UTC <icedwater> Excuse you, @munchies @mattymatheson whatever this is, stop it. *Our* food was never meant to "capture *your* imagination". Find your own.
789663386086756352 2016-10-21 03:03:17 UTC <icedwater> nothing is delicious unless it's been whitefied. Fusionised. Then it is tremendous. Gotta believe me. Yuge. Best in the world.
789652006721818624 2016-10-21 02:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @tiakhui @eisen yes. Because it makes more sense for a Demon Overlord to order a bulk ail.
789647697712074753 2016-10-21 02:00:56 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @kosherjellyfish shall we pizza/KTV?
789647491259969536 2016-10-21 02:00:07 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez necessary to get to a working toilet in less than two hours sometimes. Believe me. It's tremendous.
789647281129529344 2016-10-21 01:59:17 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun the plan is to rebuild from the bottom up. Is @AdamFlinter's team planning on joining the NFL? 
789645766696378368 2016-10-21 01:53:16 UTC <icedwater> .@Snowden so what I'm hearing is there is a write-in option, and it's still technically possible for Bernie Sanders, for instance, to win...
789644005843750912 2016-10-21 01:46:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG apparently it was just half the Internet. Not your fault. But let's all blame SMRT, just because! :)
789509919380692993 2016-10-21 16:53:27 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo you should read my book. The Art of the Deal. It's tremendous, I tell you.
789496858125094912 2016-10-21 16:01:33 UTC <icedwater> lol. @jaythenerdkid doesn't need my defence, and you wouldn't appreciate her anyway :) I will stop here.
789495443046535168 2016-10-21 15:55:56 UTC <icedwater> I would totally employ @jaythenerdkid if I could afford to fly her here and provide housing. You have no idea of her value.
789458532311502849 2016-10-21 13:29:16 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual @RichardBarrow so basically bring S.League there...

789390058327449600 2016-10-21 08:57:10 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm not sure I'd like that, it seems to imply getting into the uni is enough, not the actual content or learning ability...
789384178668216320 2016-10-21 08:33:48 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH I don't think that @FootballSLEAGUE is the only one... poofreading is a dieing arrt.
789333333675081729 2016-10-20 05:11:46 UTC <icedwater> @CarmenPrincest whatever.
789331068977426432 2016-10-20 05:02:46 UTC <icedwater> @CarmenPrincest if you mean overly pedantic, then say overly pedantic. Autism is a disorder that needs to be diagnosed.
789291941338845184 2016-10-20 02:27:17 UTC <icedwater> @CarmenPrincest sorry, how is this an autistic response?
789285642584719360 2016-10-20 02:02:16 UTC <icedwater> @BurgerKiang @tanhuiyi both might have been possible. But I know my other tweets around the same time. Just not this one. #reflex
789285116241600513 2016-10-20 02:00:10 UTC <icedwater> @lwkon1 @thaqifharxn how do you answer questions without asking another in return?
789284126104821760 2016-10-20 01:56:14 UTC <icedwater> @BurgerKiang @tanhuiyi sorry. I do like KTV and I would like to go with you three, but I do not recall posting this tweet. #reflex

789059420734967808 2016-10-20 11:03:20 UTC <icedwater> @GreenPartyUS @DrJillStein @DeanMiller1978 oof. Can that be true? In what context was this said? #pleaseexplain

788902104987422720 2016-10-19 00:38:13 UTC <icedwater> @sweden context always helps. Try e.g. a Third Reich flag on the door of a Jewish memorial. We can't avoid offending all but we can try.
788896567067414528 2016-10-19 00:16:13 UTC <icedwater> @BigNastyReigns is in the middle of a weird threesome, @HeerenJoe. Best leave them alone.
788794908769259520 2016-10-19 17:32:16 UTC <icedwater> @sweden cute examples, but it's comedy after all. Not all offence is taken for frivolous reasons. But sometimes it's overblown, that's true.
788792057724702720 2016-10-19 17:20:56 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo @singnoname huh, scrolled past this in the effort to keep up to date. What happened?
788791771236929536 2016-10-19 17:19:47 UTC <icedwater> @PeoplesPowerSG I have vested interest in this, of course, developing dialogue systems for a living... but machines are not all bad.
788789278406877184 2016-10-19 17:09:53 UTC <icedwater> well, that's your reading. Systemic problems must be addressed, acute ones get priority I hope. @robertrich @RandyOrton
788788302421778432 2016-10-19 17:06:00 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi but do you support PPAP? @omgitsjy @x_ai @dirtdynamics

788784805634715648 2016-10-19 16:52:07 UTC <icedwater> @BigNastyReigns great, I hope you can find pants that hold them in well.
788784658880180224 2016-10-19 16:51:32 UTC <icedwater> please quote the tweet where @robertrich said this. I can't find it. Thanks!
788783744043798528 2016-10-19 16:47:54 UTC <icedwater> @RandyOrton @robertrich other bones are being broken as well. But not all fractures are the same. Some require more help.
788783298705100800 2016-10-19 16:46:07 UTC <icedwater> @BigNastyReigns what kind of bravery would it take to send you a DM?
788782067106521088 2016-10-19 16:41:14 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz @coachkhairul don't think the Italian _families_ will be too happy to hear that...
788781406788780033 2016-10-19 16:38:36 UTC <icedwater> .@yazbanz @GaryKLH thought they had a jackpot room at Corporation Road, near the old SAFFC home ground...
788780451620016128 2016-10-19 16:34:49 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I believe @sweden is still a #ProudBeardo...
788779114995920896 2016-10-19 16:29:30 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz @coachkhairul it's certainly tempting to think so. I guess yes, but we'll have to check for sure.
788775800011051009 2016-10-19 16:16:20 UTC <icedwater> .@hellofrmSG come to @teteatetesg this Sunday, 3pm-6pm at Fume Millennia Walk! You can practice Japanese there :) https://www.facebook.com/events/1291142700950007/?ti=cl
788774686997917697 2016-10-19 16:11:54 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz I thought I saw Gombak United at Farrer Park one night... near scissors cut curry rice.
788772152161935360 2016-10-19 16:01:50 UTC <icedwater> @1KarenWyld also, these events tend to inspire short bursts of energy. You're providing a reason for activity to continue after events.
788750136583131138 2016-10-19 14:34:21 UTC <icedwater> @RandyOrton so... it's different when whites or non-whites say that. Yes, #alllivesareprecious, but not all lives are as precious. Sorry.
788551807429586946 2016-10-18 01:26:16 UTC <icedwater> @TheNextBestMove @thenextbestmove so you're suggesting their team hasn't already considered all this and more in preparing for the debate?
788550560693628928 2016-10-18 01:21:18 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @karmasquirrely basically just about never :)
788524130672910336 2016-10-18 23:36:17 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose @davidschneider that was probably the only way they could recover 35 million pounds a day from the EU, making it worth less?
788519649453367296 2016-10-18 23:18:29 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld hands down the Sara Bareilles concert at the Esplanade in Singapore. Because she is a wonderful person.
788425446966775813 2016-10-18 17:04:09 UTC <icedwater> @diebestimmerin *whistles* but does it greet you every morning though?

788393752167526401 2016-10-18 14:58:12 UTC <icedwater> .@YamKeng support is possible, necessary; but Govt resources limited, as you said. We as community must be aware our contributions matter.
788392599467896837 2016-10-18 14:53:37 UTC <icedwater> .@YamKeng I believe a ground-up approach to cultural preservation and integration is essential; Government can't do everything for everyone.
788391819943870465 2016-10-18 14:50:32 UTC <icedwater> Thanks again @YamKeng for highlighting the complexity of the issues and taking time to address all cultural concerns at SFCCA earlier.

787872513422340097 2016-10-16 04:26:59 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld just curious... wouldn't it be easier to alter the existing pair?
787870742754975744 2016-10-16 04:19:57 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats @ladystormhold 20ish euro is about the expected price for a dorm room, though there definitely are cheaper beds.
787863218903318528 2016-10-16 03:50:03 UTC <icedwater> I think we have 4 confirmed: @ClandestineYeo, @bruce_boner, @bargeboards, me; 2 uncertain: @singnoname, @whyvo. Any update? @kuekj
787792598396133376 2016-10-16 23:09:26 UTC <icedwater> @brithume @ashbylaw @ChuckN_SJ2 also, a quick scan suggests the UT cases occurred in GOP votes. I suppose it's why Dems aren't bothered?
787791452830961664 2016-10-16 23:04:53 UTC <icedwater> @brithume @ashbylaw @ChuckN_SJ2 if the race is won by 1, yes, 14 is crucial. But errors occur, and this isn't a municipal election.
787682958987583488 2016-10-16 15:53:46 UTC <icedwater> @tomsan106 here in Singapore it's different. Parents have much incentive to promote schoolwork over outside "distraction".
787682351622991872 2016-10-16 15:51:21 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I have added lah to the end of some German sentences before, didn't catch the locals' reaction though 
787603604639129600 2016-10-16 10:38:26 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @shimmertje8 well, @LockdownSG isn't @REG_Singapore so they have less experience outside room escapes I think?
787603346680979456 2016-10-16 10:37:25 UTC <icedwater> @tomsan106 isn't the culture of a society formed by its members, which includes parents?

787363339730952192 2016-10-15 18:43:43 UTC <icedwater> @yokey017 wow, what a coincidence! I wonder if anyone followed up on this...

787198312390594560 2016-10-15 07:47:57 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 hope it was fun! Couldn't make it this time.
786986588517588992 2016-10-14 17:46:38 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname you missed an obvious one.

786480591537483777 2016-10-13 08:15:59 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv don't be silly. Feminism is not about "women are blameless".
786479944910069761 2016-10-13 08:13:25 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter maybe it's time for a rebalance so that housing becomes more (yes, more) affordable? Is this the market correcting itself?
786475706192502784 2016-10-13 07:56:35 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter think there's a worse problem. We only want cookie cutter malls. No room for error. The commercial variant of monoculture...
786439692396789760 2016-10-12 05:33:28 UTC <icedwater> Um.
786427899255459840 2016-10-12 04:46:36 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv it's okay. Trying out a laundry joke but I guess it was a washout.

786340177639727104 2016-10-12 22:58:02 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 ugh. Maybe they're used to only giving useful instructions when you press a walkie-talkie for help.

785934742076088320 2016-10-11 20:06:59 UTC <icedwater> @DanScavino I'm missing some of that context. Which focus group would that be?
785931769077833728 2016-10-11 19:55:10 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH such bold predictions have been made before. Keep your words sweet, you may have to eat them...

785799914701803521 2016-10-11 11:11:13 UTC <icedwater> .@PeoplesPowerSG so sub judice principles apply to individual cases, right... this is more like contempt of the entire legal framework?
785798972854022144 2016-10-11 11:07:29 UTC <icedwater> maybe it is to stir as much as possible so that otherwise controversial news in other sections goes unnoticed #tinfoilhat

784749519879622656 2016-10-08 13:37:20 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya thanks for the QT. I wonder if I'll get a response from that Chief Minister or his team...
784748969364557824 2016-10-08 13:35:08 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @dhume for the RT. @VasundharaBJP sir: please let me know how you think Singapore is not western?

784675855603687424 2016-10-08 08:44:37 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi so no WhatsApp or Telegram? Signal or Threema, though?
784617212623683584 2016-10-07 04:51:35 UTC <icedwater> Just saw a Raffles ODAC T-shirt! It must be batch 33 by now... and I was in 17. Good to see they kept the logo! #odacians
783977705427435520 2016-10-06 10:30:25 UTC <icedwater> And of course another one liked this tweet. Sorry, I don't believe in SEO, good content should rise to the top. That's the only "strategy".
783914682620874752 2016-10-05 06:19:59 UTC <icedwater> .@singnoname actually we're trying to overcome that at #hai2016 Let's not Make Agents Grate Again. Work for better Human-Agent Interaction.
783914082449489920 2016-10-05 06:17:36 UTC <icedwater> @HokuLabs Thanks again @hokulabs for the inspiring and fascinating #hai2016 keynote! Question time :)pic.twitter.com/ac4AMFwDON

783911817986793472 2016-10-05 06:08:36 UTC <icedwater> Annoying SEO twitter account liked the tweet just because it had "social media strategy" in it. Just blocked it and reported it for spam 
783911423885709312 2016-10-05 06:07:02 UTC <icedwater> @HokuLabs So yeah. @hokulabs just confirmed Shelbot in the @bigbangtheory is technology she'd worked with before. #TBBT didn't invent that. #hai2016
783910384386252800 2016-10-05 06:02:54 UTC <icedwater> Telepresence robots can build social interaction even if co-workers are not physically there. Sounds like a plan... #hai2016
783909898450939904 2016-10-05 06:00:58 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon nawww I meant weaponised crap is his calling card.
783909517989863424 2016-10-05 05:59:28 UTC <icedwater> @hiroosa thanks! Maybe we should plan a better social media strategy for #hai2017.
783908761983258624 2016-10-05 05:56:27 UTC <icedwater> How do robots request for help, and what effect does that have? Cute #ttmtweenbots vs poor HitchBOT... #hai2016pic.twitter.com/DUPy2mcUEe
783907151395688448 2016-10-05 05:50:03 UTC <icedwater> Have your robots respond to success or failure. Showing shame at failure increases preceived competence. #hai2016pic.twitter.com/KUpFejKO3M
783906447310540800 2016-10-05 05:47:15 UTC <icedwater> Better to under- or actual- promise what robots can do. Don't poison the well; manage expectations. #hai2016
783905927812423681 2016-10-05 05:45:12 UTC <icedwater> @HokuLabs This is a fascinating #hai2016 keynote: agents and how we interact with them. Thanks @hokulabs Leila Takayama!pic.twitter.com/yXFi0Wpc8W
783866418634694656 2016-10-05 03:08:12 UTC <icedwater> Would it be interesting for conversational robots to have their own values/opinions? It seems less likely. #hai2016pic.twitter.com/26dVMefW6f

783828526281613312 2016-10-05 00:37:38 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv do the majority know it is a religious name? And does that affect business?
783825862403600384 2016-10-05 00:27:03 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon @kosherjellyfish @chezevo he was hung. What makes you think he did it to himself? 
783818022033104896 2016-10-05 23:55:53 UTC <icedwater> @knockoffshow people were eating frogs.
783806472505262080 2016-10-05 23:10:00 UTC <icedwater> @skroteu didn't say you said that. It is as practical as we want it to be. We all need guidance. Help build, don't just crap on "IT nerds".
783517879216009217 2016-10-04 04:03:14 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity lucky you didn't pour bubble tea into it

783506212524478465 2016-10-04 03:16:52 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv is it locally-sourced artisanal herbage though? @sexybull26 @shimmertje8

783440982507302912 2016-10-04 22:57:40 UTC <icedwater> Good news indeed! But ... would people know what it is even if we hadn't called it Dengvaxia? I mean..https://twitter.com/ChannelNewsAsia/status/783299912670646272
783440740336578560 2016-10-04 22:56:42 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo hehe nice. I should bother learning them at some point; I only remember schwa.
783439551008079872 2016-10-04 22:51:59 UTC <icedwater> @jengolbeck @recordtronic that is an interesting perspective :)

783427241547923456 2016-10-04 22:03:04 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname yup. He's had an okay record, honestly. But definitely good that his contributions are honoured.
783424690500927488 2016-10-04 21:52:56 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv they do, in Mandarin.

783325588161302528 2016-10-04 15:19:08 UTC <icedwater> it's always worth paying attention to #sgfootball. But if it makes you comfortable, I suppose I should be grateful..

783277152103870464 2016-10-04 12:06:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG define "Sinkie". Are we dividing Singaporeans into stereotypical and nonconformist, or what...?
783268588337586177 2016-10-04 11:32:38 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay lol! "he was adamant wit being hands on with the little details" well played 
783263849604485120 2016-10-04 11:13:48 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @ofmeowandbake it's difficult unless there is sufficient training data :)
783110061077913600 2016-10-03 01:02:42 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi well... we used to trust people not to jump onto tracks :p But yeah the underground station doors worked better.
783102210972327936 2016-10-03 00:31:31 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi I think at some point they were rushing work to meet the deadline after the original developer went bankrupt right? :P
783089507339939840 2016-10-03 23:41:02 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren haha well
783086738767872001 2016-10-03 23:30:02 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton @DavidBu90934404 yes, and it can be hit, but only by those who are punching up, not down. And maybe only for comedy.
782966990323326980 2016-10-03 15:34:11 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ oh, I see. Don't do enough electronics for that to matter yet.
782962273950150657 2016-10-03 15:15:27 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton @devgrupon then again, we tend not to be aware of our own flaws :)
782959528081887233 2016-10-03 15:04:32 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton chances are I'll rehash the same arguments due to lack of sleep and shot short-term memory. Cf jumping randomly into threads 
782958786591940608 2016-10-03 15:01:36 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I don't think he can make Real change without first making back $915 million.
782958007235686400 2016-10-03 14:58:30 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton thanks for walking with me down this road, I'll see if I can find some time to reflect on this soon. 
782957717145006081 2016-10-03 14:57:21 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton @devgrupon "I can generalise about everyone else as long as they don't generalise about me"
782957503638151169 2016-10-03 14:56:30 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton perhaps that's my weakness. Tapering off a strong start. Well, I got a good round of tweets out of it.
782954858764574721 2016-10-03 14:45:59 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton the poll you made a screenshot of, which I'm assuming was in response to the mockery of that one privileged black MP?
782954447940882433 2016-10-03 14:44:21 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton "the way I see it" was, of course, conveniently omitted. :)
782954209624809472 2016-10-03 14:43:24 UTC <icedwater> @devgrupon @DavidDPaxton must there be an "end game"? I guess it's the ability to retain respect while punching up for entertainment?
782952725390630913 2016-10-03 14:37:30 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton it's my attempt to understand for myself what is going on. Nobody can decide this for others, I suppose.
782951606249660417 2016-10-03 14:33:04 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton maybe. But for me, I think the black MP being mocked is fine. The problem is more of the Labour MP generalising in response?
782950457358422016 2016-10-03 14:28:30 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton because of accumulated injustice, I suppose? But that only serves as a weak excuse and not a justification.
782949669886308353 2016-10-03 14:25:22 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton not at all. Privilege is, regardless of how it is accumulated.
782949046382043136 2016-10-03 14:22:53 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton this is where I'm puzzled. I haven't implied this at all, where are you extrapolating from?
782948752134766592 2016-10-03 14:21:43 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton which I suppose brings me back to where I started: is current "protection" is a reaction to historical abuse? Hmm. Circles.
782947686165065728 2016-10-03 14:17:29 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton those are aspects that shouldn't be ignored, nor treated as the only criteria for everything.
782947424448851968 2016-10-03 14:16:27 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton you only think it is. You've already pointed out race and privilege may intersect differently in individuals.
782947155153604608 2016-10-03 14:15:22 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton you're making these up. I don't think what I have said so far implies this.
782946887577894912 2016-10-03 14:14:19 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton who knows? It's good to examine one's thought from time to time.  About privilege and equality I suppose?
782945213589303298 2016-10-03 14:07:39 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton MPs have power and responsibilities, so a little punching up is OK, regardless of race and background.
782944489950162945 2016-10-03 14:04:47 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton no, no, I'm just saying that it shouldn't just be professional comedians who can punch up, and no one should punch down.
782943918740471808 2016-10-03 14:02:31 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton I wasn't out to set a date, but if an individual has some power they are liable to be mocked, regardless of hue they are.
782943376156917760 2016-10-03 14:00:21 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton ...there were (past) abuses of Brits of African descent as well, so the protection would have applied there too at some point.
782942699297001472 2016-10-03 13:57:40 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton ...generation, I made that comment blindly assuming that the context was black Americans being abused. Though I'd imagine...
782940485522378752 2016-10-03 13:48:52 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton well, MPs have enough privilege that we can mock them for it, regardless of colour. Or is that comics' privilege? As for...
782939126144184321 2016-10-03 13:43:28 UTC <icedwater> @vivi_pazos just wait till Siri has a full voice/vocab profile and starts tweeting on your behalf 
782938883986038784 2016-10-03 13:42:30 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton it'd be a very privileged person who could claim that today the injustices have been addressed and no longer exist.
782938590749663232 2016-10-03 13:41:20 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton I'm sure it applies to this generation. Of course, they're not just "an ethnicity". But it does seem to inform reactions.
782936418041507840 2016-10-03 13:32:42 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj ah so who was @hellofrmSG  admin when @eisen started? Thanks btw. Can't remember. Maybe it's on the blog. @ladystormhold @frhn
782934838697275393 2016-10-03 13:26:26 UTC <icedwater> @DavidDPaxton the way I see it, "unfair protection" now is a way to remedy past discrimination against these minorities.
782927198147661825 2016-10-03 12:56:04 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @hellofrmSG I wonder if @eisen, @frhn, and @kuekj will want to do a week each as "where are they now" of former admins :)

782922850902487040 2016-10-03 12:38:48 UTC <icedwater> @jplaman @amichetti conditional formatting do the trick for you?
782901822331625473 2016-10-03 11:15:14 UTC <icedwater> @hwsoh that seems like an easy hypothesis to confirm. But I would say it depends on the number of apps crunching stuff in the background.

782606415210778624 2016-10-02 15:41:24 UTC <icedwater> @dfordeeps @KennerveT @dazhan14 drink it in, maaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn
782598413384716289 2016-10-02 15:09:36 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @abearfromSEA why has no one #stopthebear yet? And then @WWEDanielBryan wants to #ReleaseTheBear...
782597470832381952 2016-10-02 15:05:51 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA I don't care about you @singnoname @GaryKLH
782597425357660161 2016-10-02 15:05:40 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname heh. Talk and visions have been around for ages. Reason all you want, it has to translate.
782597192271798272 2016-10-02 15:04:45 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname as external viewers, we don't do much to improve the situation.
782596691023110145 2016-10-02 15:02:45 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GaryKLH I don't deny that. But if you're an excellent boardroom type, you still need to make things work on the ground...
782582813140750345 2016-10-02 14:07:36 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @MoAmali Jose surpassed David Luiz a long time ago... wait
782579359156609025 2016-10-02 13:53:53 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen I think it's just the tech term that sounds most like Chink?
782578989479006209 2016-10-02 13:52:25 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname when you can't even get the ground fundamentals of the sport right, why bother with political and economic projections?
782576873763053568 2016-10-02 13:44:00 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic at least I had an excuse to fly to London for a weekend in 2011!
782541956568068096 2016-10-02 11:25:16 UTC <icedwater> @PillayVijayan thanks. I do what I can, and I'm flattered that I have something you can learn from :) See you around!
782416207848673280 2016-10-01 03:05:35 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG and thanks for the past week @PillayVijayan! (Sorry, had to hunt down your twitter handle first.)
782415092008624128 2016-10-01 03:01:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG welcome back @zsiti!
782262166967595008 2016-10-01 16:53:28 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @GaryKLH well, maybe I can #linkedinhaolian now
782199042440695808 2016-10-01 12:42:38 UTC <icedwater> As long as @MightyStags are at Jurong West, live reaction fan cams mounted in this HDB block might be fun. #sleaguepic.twitter.com/caR4tl4aVN
782176070355210240 2016-10-01 11:11:21 UTC <icedwater> @furryphotos @frhn @shimmertje8 @joanna_jane we should find out what's in "Flavouring"...
782051944147791872 2016-09-30 02:58:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm staying indoors until it rains, then I will go out and complain about the weather.
781962864294670336 2016-09-30 21:04:09 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter I woke up randomly. How is it going so far?
781884461629575168 2016-09-30 15:52:37 UTC <icedwater> @eisen would have to be a really inexperienced barber, then.
781851687396835329 2016-09-30 13:42:23 UTC <icedwater> The #sleague title race is still on. @ALB_S_FC lose 2-0 to @WarriorsFCSG: goals from Muhd Ridhuan and Jonathan Behe. Relieved @MightyStags?
781848937015541760 2016-09-30 13:31:27 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale A-A tomorrow? 
781841176060059648 2016-09-30 13:00:36 UTC <icedwater> 55' Almost an equalizer for @ALB_S_FC as Atsushi Kawata nods a cross from the left just wide. @WarriorsFCSG still lead 1-0. #WARALB #sleague
781834582614118401 2016-09-30 12:34:24 UTC <icedwater> One half ends, another begins. @HomeUtdFC lead @yglions 2-1; at Jalan Besar, @WarriorsFCSG lead @ALB_S_FC 1-0 at the break. #sleague
781832162416787456 2016-09-30 12:24:47 UTC <icedwater> 37' Nagasaki's lob catches the @WarriorsFCSG defence out of position, but is too close to @YZD24. Easy catch. Still 1-0. #WARALB #sleague
781830332454608897 2016-09-30 12:17:31 UTC <icedwater> @muitee haha someone said the stadium announcer sounded like you :p
781822887653027841 2016-09-30 11:47:56 UTC <icedwater> @muitee heard you might have a new section added to your job scope?
781818358937169920 2016-09-30 11:29:56 UTC <icedwater> @ALB_S_FC #sleague double header tonight. @HomeUtdFC and @yglions, Bishan, 7.30pm; @WarriorsFCSG and @alb_s_fc, Jalan Besar, 7.45pm (live on Okto) #fb
781815946864230400 2016-09-30 11:20:21 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yup so not contradicting his own stance then :)
781793682617802752 2016-09-30 09:51:53 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon I don't think it's funny, but you'd sing it anyway...
781786381290840064 2016-09-30 09:22:52 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo next step would be to get you into one 
781781792416108544 2016-09-30 09:04:38 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo that's what Obama said too!
781781615634636800 2016-09-30 09:03:56 UTC <icedwater> @TheAtlantic @edyong209 @DungeonFacts it's no accident that probiotics is "pi" into "robotics"!
781779142194831360 2016-09-30 08:54:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Duterte? He said he was against crime, but did he talk about courts? I don't recall...
781703543191285760 2016-09-29 03:53:42 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim hmm? Are they bringing back the fine?
781703390094954496 2016-09-29 03:53:06 UTC <icedwater> Regarding some oral history transcripts from a former leader, and an article I haven't read...https://twitter.com/PeoplesPowerSG/status/781694333695168512
781701787916959744 2016-09-29 03:46:44 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale hmm adopted how?
781701127746129920 2016-09-29 03:44:06 UTC <icedwater> @malikofori sure, debunk a funny story... leave Brexit lies hanging :)
781523430696902656 2016-09-29 15:58:00 UTC <icedwater> @tanhuiyi hi there! What a coincidence.
781522595136974849 2016-09-29 15:54:41 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname you had the correct answers to questions that haven't yet appeared. Plus you confirmed quite a few others 
781518839116734464 2016-09-29 15:39:45 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname simi makeweight 9. You can Lam Ching Ying lor. Piyapong Morgan lor. D for Dunanyhowsay.

781513335359496192 2016-09-29 15:17:53 UTC <icedwater> @SGTipsyTrivia hi, thanks for the entertaining evening! How many teams have signed up for next month's edition and which Paulaner is it?
781513054236315648 2016-09-29 15:16:46 UTC <icedwater> I hope there's room too! @kuekj @SGTipsyTrivia
781508493605953536 2016-09-29 14:58:39 UTC <icedwater> hi! I was in @kuekj team tonight. Yes, @SGTipsyTrivia is usually on the last Thursday each month. Next month is 20th Oct.
781446651428810753 2016-09-29 10:52:54 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj zzz I'm gonna be late, do they allow subs? I can come off the bench  @SGTipsyTrivia
781432440489320448 2016-09-29 09:56:26 UTC <icedwater> Good ending, but please read this whole thread. Thanks @blackadlerqueen for passing it onhttps://twitter.com/nikeshshukla/status/781246215375712256
781406929570504704 2016-09-29 08:15:04 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay are you sure you want them to 3E the thing?
781406530243469312 2016-09-29 08:13:29 UTC <icedwater> @ChickenMacabre I'm still on my Redmi Note 2. I have to use the cleaner (memory fills up quickly) a lot, but that's my only gripe with it.
781378695789285376 2016-09-28 06:22:53 UTC <icedwater> @eisenhttps://twitter.com/Molitics/status/781360472331345920

781343663502659584 2016-09-28 04:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @bruce_boner @bargeboards @kuekj @singnoname @ClandestineYeo @whyvo lol in the end everyone pull out the team only got 4 
781343402889588736 2016-09-28 04:02:38 UTC <icedwater> @bruce_boner you wanna go tonight Tipsy Trivia is it? You take my place also can :)
781342589874163712 2016-09-28 03:59:24 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards @kuekj @singnoname @ClandestineYeo @whyvo maybe let @bruce_boner sub me and I'll come next month? @eisen
781323857596526592 2016-09-28 02:44:58 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @infernoxv true, but it's what you spend that money on that counts. Certain things are far less necessary than others.
781322820357730305 2016-09-28 02:40:51 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @infernoxv the school badge* is an unnecessary expense, when the pool is obviously already within the premises. 
781317617726263296 2016-09-28 02:20:10 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @shimmertje8 we were brought on a tour of ACSI. The school crest in the bottom of the pool was the main thing 
781316388849713152 2016-09-28 02:15:17 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @infernoxv Exclusive Prism Programme from P4-P6. Went to the light side because I was disgusted by o$tentation 
781315602929463296 2016-09-28 02:12:10 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @shimmertje8 I was there for 3 years. #GreenBlackWhite4Life
781313628112691200 2016-09-28 02:04:19 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv ACJC? I'd say ACS in general! And the Mandarin inside Chinese class rooms was an abomination too! 
781313115669475328 2016-09-28 02:02:17 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen so basically we have no right to complain about Trump
781306799794159616 2016-09-28 01:37:11 UTC <icedwater> @MrCDHamilton @infernoxv well you're entitled to believe that ;)
781306557149569024 2016-09-28 01:36:13 UTC <icedwater> @MrCDHamilton @infernoxv well you're entitled to believe that :)
781305814740979714 2016-09-28 01:33:16 UTC <icedwater> @MrCDHamilton @infernoxv that's a Eurocentric view, isn't it. Or a Sinocentric one ;)
781305632070651904 2016-09-28 01:32:33 UTC <icedwater> @MrCDHamilton @infernoxv I suppose, though we ought to be preparing people for the world to come as well, right?
781296171411132417 2016-09-28 00:54:57 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @MrCDHamilton I wonder if there isn't an implied inferiority of schools of thought from outside of Europe, though?
781294958896525312 2016-09-28 00:50:08 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @MrCDHamilton it's also instructive that most affirmative replies are, or appear to be, from white people.
781130188096610309 2016-09-28 13:55:24 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic @eisen you bet!
781090869281628160 2016-09-28 11:19:09 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren oh, this is the Changi Village one right? 
781080151639543808 2016-09-28 10:36:34 UTC <icedwater> http://youtu.be/Y08LddJHVpQ ask a question, then never answer it... nice work, Milo! #NeverGiveUp
781048046301831168 2016-09-28 08:29:00 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen nope, never heard of them. Sorry :p also, Bert and Ernie, Ivy and Harley, The Rock and Sock... too many more iconic pairs.
781046792657915904 2016-09-28 08:24:01 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen who are those two in the first picture, anyway...
780988936831238144 2016-09-27 04:34:07 UTC <icedwater> @DervDt what is English???
780934348744732673 2016-09-27 00:57:12 UTC <icedwater> @tocsg please proofread your articles. "the" and "a" are missing in this tweet, and "degrading" is not the same as "degraded".
780933341511950336 2016-09-27 00:53:12 UTC <icedwater> @FuzzyLeapfrog that is sheer Audacity.
780784332352872448 2016-09-27 15:01:05 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic @eisen you bet!
780718988326150144 2016-09-27 10:41:26 UTC <icedwater> @DervDt what are you talking about??
780717493262299136 2016-09-27 10:35:30 UTC <icedwater> @wpsg @DervDt where were @PAPSingapore when this started long time back???
780653741267570689 2016-09-26 06:22:10 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna @sarahkliff that's probably true of anyone debating Donald Trump, to be honest. I wonder if previous debate counts hold up.
780581287010500608 2016-09-26 01:34:15 UTC <icedwater> For Hillary Clinton to have fought ISIS her entire adult life, @realDonaldTrump, she can't possibly be over 30, could she? #debatenight
780572662158405636 2016-09-26 00:59:59 UTC <icedwater> @akiestar thousands just got cut off when one YouTube pirate stream was halted 
780564470628093952 2016-09-26 00:27:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it's true.
780563645935685632 2016-09-26 00:24:10 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG also, adults need fewer reasons to break rules. If we're constantly rushing for whatever reason, we won't give way.
780563322437378048 2016-09-26 00:22:52 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG for me, it's no point drumming anything in in schools if the adults constantly justify bending/breaking the rules.
780562328592916480 2016-09-26 00:18:55 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG ditto the multiple stairways and three doors. Worth trying at least, though.
780561378243260416 2016-09-26 00:15:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm not convinced of that, if bag down Benny and whatever she was called ain't working...
780561192980840449 2016-09-26 00:14:25 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I suppose cash payments would be in the front only, and card entry at the back? Or ticket machines in the middle.
780555756433092608 2016-09-26 23:52:49 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I think it would be easier to reuse current bus designs and encourage boarding from the back and giving way to alighting folk.
780555139123847168 2016-09-26 23:50:21 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold let's either start calling construction workers expats or Raffles Place types foreign workers 
780540262934196224 2016-09-26 22:51:15 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day is that not official policy though?
780428055567183872 2016-09-26 15:25:22 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren @MothershipSG I don't understand what these people see in a massive hunk of metal and glass over a casino. They want, build lah.
780427386793791488 2016-09-26 15:22:43 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day I feel the same, I just wish people making claims would provide more evidence.
780422325426544640 2016-09-26 15:02:36 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day to be sure, you said "sponsor", but I thought the sentiment was there.
780421312565039104 2016-09-26 14:58:35 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day getting donations from media channels is still a long way from "provoking Russia for her evil master George Soros".
780412994962399233 2016-09-26 14:25:32 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day nope, not a conspiracy theory at all...
780399737975345152 2016-09-26 13:32:51 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day maybe those crimes don't really count for much when weighed against her experience and calmness? Trump is hardly presidential.
780399128115187714 2016-09-26 13:30:25 UTC <icedwater> @rich41day and what are you doing for others here?
780397533407301632 2016-09-26 13:24:05 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM the murderer could be the help too 
780396931247804417 2016-09-26 13:21:42 UTC <icedwater> oh well. 
780368677245849600 2016-09-26 11:29:25 UTC <icedwater> wait lol you really lost your phone? Or was it a buggy email that you received
780294150683922432 2016-09-25 06:33:17 UTC <icedwater> so you're in NY now ??!!??!!
780293307591077888 2016-09-25 06:29:56 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname think we want to sexit, maybe?
780256985958588416 2016-09-25 04:05:36 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold I thought it was a Halloween thing, to be honest...
780253204021809152 2016-09-25 03:50:34 UTC <icedwater> So PPP agrees: "first world" FTs who know how to behave are welcome, but "third world" mindsets aren't welcome here?https://twitter.com/PeoplesPowerSG/status/780040171865636864
780243710541910016 2016-09-25 03:12:51 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren lol!
780240355992088576 2016-09-25 02:59:31 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish yup because of the "correct food" line I guess. Although @singnoname might have explained my current suffering too...
780207003348021248 2016-09-25 00:46:59 UTC <icedwater> yup count me in!
780143072214523904 2016-09-25 20:32:57 UTC <icedwater> isn't the writer throwing the same kind of hissy fit he's accusing Yassmin A.M. of though?
780140574368079872 2016-09-25 20:23:01 UTC <icedwater> oops. So was it there?!
780095119085023232 2016-09-25 17:22:24 UTC <icedwater> @avalon haiz. At least you have your kid with you again :)
780094315330547712 2016-09-25 17:19:12 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @itzwikipedia doesn't that mean you fall asleep on the phone..?

779570488569757697 2016-09-23 06:37:42 UTC <icedwater> nobody deserves to have to expect abuse.
779530747866525696 2016-09-23 03:59:47 UTC <icedwater> of course. Individuals are not collectives. One can be gay, queer, genderfluid, lesbian, straight, bisexual, etc but not LGBTQIA+.
779526728859291649 2016-09-23 03:43:49 UTC <icedwater> don't wonder, ask. Also, that is a blanket term for all those other genders and orientations. Each has their own name.
779526429381840896 2016-09-23 03:42:38 UTC <icedwater> if I reject those voices, who hears mine? There's a paradox. If those deciding are stronger, at least their views are accepted?
779521007639900161 2016-09-23 03:21:05 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname that stinks.
779520852412895232 2016-09-23 03:20:28 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish #WhatICanBuyWith28K 1.5 years of living and studying in Germany, with occasional holidays.
779520567485489152 2016-09-23 03:19:20 UTC <icedwater> e.g. I am of Chinese descent. Since I'm not "white", I'm a "person of colour". I'm not a "yellow person" or a "yellow".
779520243530027008 2016-09-23 03:18:03 UTC <icedwater> heh, I have never heard of this either.
779520159979479040 2016-09-23 03:17:43 UTC <icedwater> oh this was a reply to that. I don't know. I suppose it's OK because their other identity as a person is still acknowledged?
779520017599647744 2016-09-23 03:17:09 UTC <icedwater> by necessity, since it appears behind a noun, the subject is made more prominent, I suppose? I'm guessing too.
779519806177357824 2016-09-23 03:16:19 UTC <icedwater> also, obviously norms differ from place to place. If it's acceptable somewhere it need not be so everywhere, and vice versa.
779519560915439616 2016-09-23 03:15:20 UTC <icedwater> I don't know about that. But I'm assuming they've done studies and talked to black Americans at least.
779519414467112960 2016-09-23 03:14:45 UTC <icedwater> also, it's probably got to do with the fact that "coloured" sweeps everyone into a common bin that isn't "white".
779516910182346752 2016-09-23 03:04:48 UTC <icedwater> this in particular is not up to us.
779516723196145664 2016-09-23 03:04:04 UTC <icedwater> because it prioritises the people and puts the colour second, whereas terms like black, brown, or coloured erase the people.
779482474569084928 2016-09-23 00:47:58 UTC <icedwater> yes, it's arbitrary. But no less offensive. "Coloured" was traditionally used as a less pejorative term for "black" I believe?
779260927745011712 2016-09-23 10:07:37 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj that one you would be too busy laughing to go back to sleep right... 
779246122657165312 2016-09-23 09:08:47 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj new idea. Make an exciting event as boring as possible to help cases like yours.
779242694707060736 2016-09-23 08:55:10 UTC <icedwater> @Snowden hmm, what settings would we need to change on Telegram to make it safer, though?
779188342013370368 2016-09-22 05:19:12 UTC <icedwater> @sutdsg when will we make the trend rather than catching one...

778259776572567553 2016-09-20 15:49:24 UTC <icedwater> Hm @fenix_app, it's inconsistent, sometimes it's Twitter for Web, or Android, or iPhone. And only.. "empty" tweets?pic.twitter.com/3WbH676scF
778257660642676741 2016-09-20 15:41:00 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill I don't know, some tweets and poetry are pretty smart despite being far further compressed.
778255907633278976 2016-09-20 15:34:02 UTC <icedwater> Is it just Fenix for Android 1.8, or are Web Twitter tweets all quoting themselves today? It's pretty annoying... @fenix_app any idea?
778253753103192064 2016-09-20 15:25:28 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan @kuekj might it have something to do with the Pearl's Centre apartment design? It's also kind of a spiral, if I am not mistaken.

777875219767623681 2016-09-19 14:21:19 UTC <icedwater> @hxtan_ we don't know who discovered America, but it probably wasn't Columbus
777874784025579520 2016-09-19 14:19:35 UTC <icedwater> @coachkhairul I'm sure you can name many CBs 
777872884265918464 2016-09-19 14:12:02 UTC <icedwater> @NianticLabs hi! I and a few others haven't been able to sign up for #ViaLux in Singapore since the reset. The common load-out is bugged.
777847220078948352 2016-09-19 12:30:03 UTC <icedwater> @dan_abramov @ScribblingOn @Canenald well, we have to make it so :)
777827605017825280 2016-09-19 11:12:07 UTC <icedwater> @dan_abramov @ScribblingOn @Canenald we hope this can be done. But how many discouraged developers will toxic environments cause first?
777826850445795328 2016-09-19 11:09:07 UTC <icedwater> @baroka painful side of relentless #progress. We in Singapore have already lost, among others, a landmark library to a road tunnel.
777757000021094401 2016-09-18 06:31:33 UTC <icedwater> @CheeSoonJuan thanks Dr. Chee. Are there links to the research you're citing though? Is one of them http://www.bis.org/publ/work490.pdf?
777742683619983360 2016-09-18 05:34:40 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen hmmm OK
777742469421084672 2016-09-18 05:33:49 UTC <icedwater> looks like you've been waiting for the right @hellofrmSG to ask these questions eh :p
777741698877132800 2016-09-18 05:30:45 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen wouldn't Credit be Cash's spiffy-yet-slimy boss who sends him out on errands to hang pig's heads at 4am?
777681048402399233 2016-09-18 01:29:45 UTC <icedwater> @footysg it appeared three times in that image lol
777656239656308736 2016-09-18 23:51:10 UTC <icedwater> @deutscheposts I know. You used a capital S for Success and it was an opening for me 
777561172862115840 2016-09-18 17:33:24 UTC <icedwater> @deutscheposts wait so Guardiola is manager at Watford, or what...? Did Isaac the wrong manager?
777560606685536256 2016-09-18 17:31:09 UTC <icedwater> @footysg @JTalkPod that's actually a hat trick...
777559834266783744 2016-09-18 17:28:05 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @NeilHumphreys nah it has to be after the always-play clause on Rooney's contract extension
777467470776983553 2016-09-18 11:21:04 UTC <icedwater> @AHumanCrisis is this a bot? I'm not sure what your filters are for refugees. But it's a welcome correction.
777465057374408704 2016-09-18 11:11:28 UTC <icedwater> @QuisSeparabit that's a bold claim, that refugees would destroy their own IDs. Have some been reported as doing so?
777460401919266816 2016-09-18 10:52:58 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG don't forget your #gorengpisang
777449681915748352 2016-09-18 10:10:23 UTC <icedwater> @QuisSeparabit nice try, but neither of these places is where the bulk of the refugees are coming from. And Britain is better, but how much?
777433795574140928 2016-09-18 09:07:15 UTC <icedwater> @QuisSeparabit no, just pointing out that the moral high ground you occupy hasn't been higher for all that long, so don't go wagging fingers
777433340232159232 2016-09-18 09:05:26 UTC <icedwater> @ThinkTrumpsFeel lol, you're right. I'm not going to give you any more words to twist around. Bye ;)
777418379531472898 2016-09-18 08:06:00 UTC <icedwater> @ThinkTrumpsFeel uhm, try 2010s Europe. As if it's not just recently that those referenda were passed.
777416686651662336 2016-09-18 07:59:16 UTC <icedwater> @ThinkTrumpsFeel how is that remotely close to anything I have said? It might be the argument in your mind... but only in yours.
777397049671032833 2016-09-17 06:41:14 UTC <icedwater> So... what's the venue for @SGTipsyTrivia this month? And is there a team I might be able to join? 29 September right?
777395738699411456 2016-09-17 06:36:02 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen it's Shanmugam. Probably those racial constructs are working too well 
777395430317449218 2016-09-17 06:34:48 UTC <icedwater> @furryphotos @hellofrmSG good, that means the park remains peaceful
777395208736473089 2016-09-17 06:33:55 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter looks like it's only for those who wish to stand for election. That'd make it easier to dismantle I suppose...
777394597089583104 2016-09-17 06:31:29 UTC <icedwater> @ajithharish37 while I can't offer you lodging, I'd love to meet you for a coffee at some point :) Welcome to Singapore!
777394154393382913 2016-09-17 06:29:44 UTC <icedwater> @kixes doesn't that sound like "we will only allow Christian refugees into the country"?
777393138952351744 2016-09-17 06:25:42 UTC <icedwater> @direcow animals and children tell the truth, they never lie 
777392813633777664 2016-09-17 06:24:24 UTC <icedwater> @Zoejade77 I'm not sure what to make of your statement given that you're using the three brackets in your Twitter handle...
777392531331911680 2016-09-17 06:23:17 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @ScotForLiberty it's not like the women, gays and trans folk were always accepted in the places where refugees arrive, either.
777391660149858305 2016-09-17 06:19:49 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue isn't that just question-words? Not sure because we don't use that term often, but there's often the "5/6 Ws" too...
777390943917842432 2016-09-17 06:16:58 UTC <icedwater> @judacris XJP, in a few decades
777302605231828992 2016-09-17 00:25:57 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin too direct and impatient eh?

777110995076395008 2016-09-17 11:44:33 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna so... sugar syrup sieved twice through last week's dirty socks and left to ferment for a month...?
776887258225926144 2016-09-16 20:55:30 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh it would have been a reasonable decision anyway right? Unless I missed some injury news...
776886763558014976 2016-09-16 20:53:32 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna guh. Saw the idiots. I feel sorry you have to go through this.
776744958887809024 2016-09-16 11:30:04 UTC <icedwater> @TODAYonline @bolasepako it was on @todayonline so it must have popped up from somewhere.
776720059200774144 2016-09-16 09:51:07 UTC <icedwater> .@bolasepako so is it correct to say that there will be 46 votes altogether for the @FASingapore election? #sgfootball

776690994766950401 2016-09-16 07:55:38 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice rather, how does it make him a deluded lunatic? Of course even statements of facts can be divisive.
776690563655438336 2016-09-16 07:53:55 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice so how can it be divisive if it is merely a statement of fact?
776646886073655296 2016-09-15 05:00:21 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj right now, ahead of the elections? America is indeed somewhere between R and L... 
776611980979294208 2016-09-15 02:41:39 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk why? It is true.

776049740509171713 2016-09-14 13:27:31 UTC <icedwater> oops heh thanks.
776048510399492101 2016-09-14 13:22:37 UTC <icedwater> Thanks Dr. Farish Ahmad Noor from NTU for tonight's episode of #SovereignForest. Wish I'd seen this earlier. #fbpic.twitter.com/Z2Spi7TAAL

776045602702360576 2016-09-14 13:11:04 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold that's what I'm trying to say, it's not an alternative like "yes/no". "she/her" is just a short form for "(she, her)".
776045149734395904 2016-09-14 13:09:16 UTC <icedwater> orh. For work email lah I presume. On Twitter you usually get flippant replies as the norm...
776044082267246592 2016-09-14 13:05:02 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold I think "/" was easier to use than (she, her) so they went with that? Not as a statement that "she" is different from "her".
776043038661488642 2016-09-14 13:00:53 UTC <icedwater> why leh.

775899119843803136 2016-09-13 03:29:00 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk why would you say something like this?
775847806690922497 2016-09-13 00:05:06 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @AMDWaters eh, because the rest already are?
775701130013650945 2016-09-13 14:22:15 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM when are you going to @objectifscentre?
775700177151590400 2016-09-13 14:18:28 UTC <icedwater> @jackmatt81 are you seriously trying to reason with a "deplorable"?
775692978815762432 2016-09-13 13:49:52 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb so you're tweeting in your sleep?
775561201010868224 2016-09-12 05:06:14 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter it's that Pokmon, Pudgey, or something like that.
775544804050481152 2016-09-12 04:01:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @CSExodus sure, but hashing (to hex) actually leads to a lower search space for brute force since it goes from 62^8 to 16^8?
775524203239878656 2016-09-12 02:39:13 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @CSExodus I think the similarity check is before the hash.
775523647641432064 2016-09-12 02:37:00 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG still allows for almost 2^56 possibilities in theory. Depending on what is "similar".
775486924681117696 2016-09-12 00:11:05 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual congratulations! Not 2-1 at last. Worth a drink I suppose?
775486163633119232 2016-09-12 00:08:03 UTC <icedwater> @febricious but I think that's why we love @SaraBareilles, isn't it?
775358130796453888 2016-09-12 15:39:18 UTC <icedwater> .@jesslynnrose pity you aren't based in or visiting Singapore, or @webuildsg might have a spot for you! Also we could try to fix the former.
775352654260080642 2016-09-12 15:17:32 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis ha! Well. Let's see... the ship is already sinking, might as well get some laughs out of it eh?
775201718984249344 2016-09-11 05:17:47 UTC <icedwater> @Diggrich_ I 'believe so'.
775200293873000449 2016-09-11 05:12:07 UTC <icedwater> bluck
775198320968949763 2016-09-11 05:04:16 UTC <icedwater> Disgusting how people are piling onto #HillarysHealth with such snark and condemnation. Sigh. We humans suck.
775197762736394241 2016-09-11 05:02:03 UTC <icedwater> @gautam_anand25 why would you tweet a github link via LinkedIn? Seriously.
775197428894969856 2016-09-11 05:00:44 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I feel for those people. I've seen the Pokzombies...
775197112610848769 2016-09-11 04:59:28 UTC <icedwater> @Unusualfactpage also, cheer up, sing a song! It works for me! 
775197016527740928 2016-09-11 04:59:05 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @Unusualfactpage that's an oversimplification by minds that gloss over problems which initially weren't noticed.
775195986884857856 2016-09-11 04:55:00 UTC <icedwater> @kixes yeah. Seriously. There's so much more effort we don't acknowledge when we dismiss Paralympians because of smaller fields.
775195078268563456 2016-09-11 04:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan interesting read and opinion. I'm firmly on the heritage side though. But I'm quite keen on all sorts of languages too.
775182854699356162 2016-09-11 04:02:49 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis it's not till November.
775182778488893441 2016-09-11 04:02:31 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis lol. That's how you use Twitter? What a pity. 
775044656035880961 2016-09-11 18:53:40 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis also, Dragonite told me to tell you, kwitcherbitchin', maggot :)pic.twitter.com/B8Ckwh4BR5
775043069896830976 2016-09-11 18:47:22 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis oh OK. So my country is important enough to be blamed but nobody gives a shit about it? ;)
774880018354675712 2016-09-11 07:59:27 UTC <icedwater> @dcatdemon you were asking about local comics? Just saw this today :)pic.twitter.com/NpsFmdabvm
774877793758826500 2016-09-11 07:50:37 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld boo! It wasn't at all useless! Thanks for opening up! :)
774876227182006272 2016-09-11 07:44:23 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter no shit!
774866702639042560 2016-09-11 07:06:32 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz one more session!
774814817144057856 2016-09-10 03:40:22 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty yeah you think he's going underground so soon? I wonder if he'll get to 1-1.
774810993385803776 2016-09-10 03:25:10 UTC <icedwater> Half of one round was all it took. 2:14. Congratulations @mickeygall. The rift in experience shows. Better luck next time @CMPunk! #UFC203
774809417707429888 2016-09-10 03:18:55 UTC <icedwater> @mickeygall And now... the debuting Cult of Personality @CMPunk strolls into the arena where 2-0 @MickeyGall is already waiting. #welterweight #UFC203
774805613918302208 2016-09-10 03:03:48 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty sympathy points! 
774805360758489089 2016-09-10 03:02:47 UTC <icedwater> Congratulations @JimmieRivera135 on the unanimous decision after 3 rounds against @UrijahFaber to go 20-1! #bantamweight #UFC203
774802136139898880 2016-09-10 02:49:59 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @TheFactsBook [citation needed]
774801469065207808 2016-09-10 02:47:19 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty didn't recognize that song. Who is it by?
774799197690142720 2016-09-10 02:38:18 UTC <icedwater> And now it's @JimmieRivera135 entering the octagon ahead of California Kid, @UrijahFaber. Rivera has an 18-win streak. #bantamweight #UFC203
774797377043439616 2016-09-10 02:31:04 UTC <icedwater> @jessicammapro That was not a close fight. Well done though @DRkneevil on defence. Congratulations @JessicaMMApro on being that lion. 1st round submission!
774795493989769216 2016-09-10 02:23:35 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis lol! Learn some geography.
774793410053943301 2016-09-10 02:15:18 UTC <icedwater> @jessicammapro @DRkneevil Enter @DrKneevil, Joanne Calderwood. And her opponent @JessicaMMAPro, Jessica Andrade. This should be fun! #strawweight #UFC203
774792782321885184 2016-09-10 02:12:48 UTC <icedwater> yup take care :)
774732997983559680 2016-09-10 22:15:15 UTC <icedwater> coffee at 11?
774732259077218304 2016-09-10 22:12:19 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify nobody does. That's why it's the unknown. Every experience is unique :) Just keep being you. If I can be of help, let me know!
774714243929079808 2016-09-10 21:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis you've made your point over and over. I'm aware you can't cope with games not going your way.
774713807641784320 2016-09-10 20:58:59 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis sure, because where I come from is completely relevant to your whining about virtual dragons :)
774616375796957184 2016-09-10 14:31:50 UTC <icedwater> @k_santhi time for #northsuckstories?
774615876817465344 2016-09-10 14:29:51 UTC <icedwater> Welcome @phunkiefresh as this week's @hellofrmSG! Just enjoy your time with the #RoCur :)
774615160627486721 2016-09-10 14:27:00 UTC <icedwater> Many thanks @dcatdemon for your week as @hellofrmSG! Glad I finally got the chance to interact somewhat punctually... right @whyvo? 
774610905745137666 2016-09-10 14:10:06 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @itzwikipedia ....uh what
774550657432825857 2016-09-10 10:10:41 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @ahontwi on a side note, it'd be nice if they used different chimes for closing doors and passenger announcements. #sgtransit
774462997372604416 2016-09-09 04:22:22 UTC <icedwater> @BasicNewbie she's still the best in the world and a record breaker in her field.
774357500472676352 2016-09-09 21:23:09 UTC <icedwater> @noahi @ASmallFiction @AdamVero technically, it'd be "The Pedants' Rev"- oh, wait 
774351754854924288 2016-09-09 21:00:19 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis I'm sure you're not the only ones complaining, but you're damn sure also not the only players.
774351598000627713 2016-09-09 20:59:42 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG pfffft
774351236325703680 2016-09-09 20:58:16 UTC <icedwater> @VfL_1899 VFL Osnabrck ole ole!!!
774350078743937024 2016-09-09 20:53:40 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis boo hoo. One less player worldwide.
774349962775670784 2016-09-09 20:53:12 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis uh huh, making Pokmon not run away after you toss things at them is certainly more challenging.
774266012141101056 2016-09-09 15:19:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG the Corrs probably covered it too:p
774264232955084800 2016-09-09 15:12:32 UTC <icedwater> @VfL_1899 alles Gute Jungs! #zeigtsuns
774262809550917632 2016-09-09 15:06:53 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I first heard the Corrs/Bono rendition of this. Here are the Corrs alone:https://youtu.be/rqUuJvHypo0
774261614736465921 2016-09-09 15:02:08 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG isn't rewrite from the ... uh ... FMA soundtrack?
774245551550320640 2016-09-09 13:58:18 UTC <icedwater> I've been told it was actually an #SGCup game. #sleague returns tomorrow; Home United vs Tampines Rovers. Bishan Stadium, 7.30pm. $6/adult.
774244149046280192 2016-09-09 13:52:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname oops! Hahaha was it now! I'm out of touch.
774241011950243842 2016-09-09 13:40:16 UTC <icedwater> By the way, for those who might not have noticed, there was an #sleague match this evening and Albirex Niigata beat Balestier Khalsa 1-0.
774240594524725249 2016-09-09 13:38:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG REPENT!!!!!
774240051160948736 2016-09-09 13:36:27 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @whyvo that one is particles. Is good to know lah. But we should be able to code-switch.
774238958574120960 2016-09-09 13:32:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG also, it is utterly adorable to hear expat kids picking up Singlish from local schoolmates. Muhahaha
774238697587822596 2016-09-09 13:31:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG is national treasure hor.
774238432977571840 2016-09-09 13:30:01 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling are they gonna have Butterbean too?
774237903488638976 2016-09-09 13:27:55 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus zzzzz
774237725373239296 2016-09-09 13:27:13 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG oi! Singlish got own grammar one OK.
774222550259728384 2016-09-09 12:26:54 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yup. It's still a work in progress, our identity. Artefacts like this rocur contribute in small ways :)
774218120458231808 2016-09-09 12:09:18 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG why should we have a nationalist culture? We just need to know how to appreciate what we have. No need for "pride" :)
774214810778996736 2016-09-09 11:56:09 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah please tell me that was just a random number! $82... what's the multiplier?!
774211724312317952 2016-09-09 11:43:53 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld you could call your show... the MParader! Let me just quickly reserve the Twitter account for you...
774210999284961281 2016-09-09 11:41:01 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld where was this? Sounds fun.
774210477752590336 2016-09-09 11:38:56 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld milo, music, make-up and ... quick, find another few Ms!
774204811835084800 2016-09-09 11:16:25 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @JuriaTRM I was looking for a cute pikachure or GIF but I found a creepy one :( this is the best I have!pic.twitter.com/azDwwV5Wwn
774188729288183808 2016-09-09 10:12:31 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM I think there's a autocorrect thing there, or am I missing something? Could @kiampah explain please...
774159601000259584 2016-09-09 08:16:46 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I wouldn't have known about acidity, body, et al, to be sure, if we'd stuck with only kopi. That's the vocabulary I meant.
774157082866049024 2016-09-09 08:06:46 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish yup! It's easy to use and get started designing stuff :)
774092936896053248 2016-09-08 03:51:52 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish inserts a lot of fat code though. <div></div> zzzz
774032509759664129 2016-09-08 23:51:45 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I'm not sure what diversity of opinion you mean. the vocabulary wasn't there, I suppose? Definitely not that "kopi" isn't "good".
774031484441145345 2016-09-08 23:47:41 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti yes, that seems to have become quite an important part of cafe culture here though.
773915073983025153 2016-09-08 16:05:06 UTC <icedwater> @avalon I don't claim to know know you, but you getting through life daily is already much to learn from. Start with that.
773914652489035777 2016-09-08 16:03:26 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna I happen to like Irish coffee. Oh? Not that ire?
773914460142473217 2016-09-08 16:02:40 UTC <icedwater> @SaraBareilles @WaitressMusical @koreykuhl obviously with sugar, butter, and flour.
773913541996707840 2016-09-08 15:59:01 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane so that's who bought up everything from the Guardians 
773913264505823232 2016-09-08 15:57:55 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 @willoftheatheis I don't like it either, but if they're giving in to every whine, where'd the challenge be?
773912176130011136 2016-09-08 15:53:36 UTC <icedwater> @CharlotteHase is the EU failing to catch on, or already ahead of the curve? :P
773911762043146240 2016-09-08 15:51:57 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld given that you're on this RoCur, you might want to define whether it's football or handegg, too. Mascot standards differ :p
773849544391962624 2016-09-08 11:44:43 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I appreciate that, but the term "good" prompted an eyeroll. Of course, it's your opinion.
773849128468041729 2016-09-08 11:43:04 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti well, to differentiate themselves some cafes are trying things like printing selfies on coffee, or adding clouds (cotton candy)..
773848014888669184 2016-09-08 11:38:38 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @ladystormhold but the government is also people. Plus when it's such a large employer as it is here...
773847707429380097 2016-09-08 11:37:25 UTC <icedwater> Heh.https://twitter.com/hellofrmSG/status/773833249445535744
773847537845358594 2016-09-08 11:36:45 UTC <icedwater> Indeed. And the condensed milk had to be ice-cold, fresh from the fridge. <3https://twitter.com/azyintl/status/773831041073020928
773847041143214080 2016-09-08 11:34:46 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti "good" coffee. I mean, I like the novelty and probably the free Wi-Fi, but I'm still a kopi o boy at heart.
773843641093599232 2016-09-08 11:21:16 UTC <icedwater> Online trial in @StadtOsnabrueck to practice for local election voting. Something we can implement @sgelection?https://twitter.com/StadtOsnabrueck/status/773773634439700480
773842396383551491 2016-09-08 11:16:19 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG in German yesterday was Mittwoch, middle of the week. No romance there :p
773842186618023936 2016-09-08 11:15:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG in German it's Donnerstag, the day of thunder. Who's the derivative now eh
773841375099916289 2016-09-08 11:12:15 UTC <icedwater> @eleventhphoto @tboake2000 tough. It's part of the game.
773841133021433856 2016-09-08 11:11:18 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity @PokemonGoApp so now your route past Pokstops can be tracked without your opening the app? Hope it only applies to this device.
773837984072294400 2016-09-08 10:58:47 UTC <icedwater> you still get 25 xp as consolation when they run away. But yeah it's super frustrating :/
773837793231450112 2016-09-08 10:58:01 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG we can chat more in private or on IRC. I'm on #hackerspacesg in freenode :)
773837328808759296 2016-09-08 10:56:11 UTC <icedwater> @avalon hmm. How about the content though? I'll check it out at some point, thanks.
773823679037747201 2016-09-08 10:01:56 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo got my second one. It was more fun "photographing" the dude.pic.twitter.com/Ar9CoXzAQb
773818335532154880 2016-09-08 09:40:42 UTC <icedwater> I'm on leave. But what's your excuse for coming out before 6? #PokemonGoSG #fbpic.twitter.com/NCeSn3GL4P
773792540516417536 2016-09-08 07:58:12 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG but yeah I just use dpkg -l | grep for those cases.
773792348304056320 2016-09-08 07:57:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG sorry, I'm apt to get a little smug about my preferred package manager.
773785815990218752 2016-09-08 07:31:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Linux is gamey, that much I'll give you  this game is on Android / iOS anyhow, so...
773785618685976576 2016-09-08 07:30:42 UTC <icedwater> .@hellofrmSG sure, until you realise you need that oven to bake you a flask to measure how much flour to use in your cake :)
773784565189976065 2016-09-08 07:26:31 UTC <icedwater> @wilfredphua @frhn @shimmertje8 @jerricklim odd to hear that, I'd have thought Apple's stricter guidelines gave them the upper hand there.
773783876334346240 2016-09-08 07:23:46 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG dunno nehmind  it's from the game that provided fundamentals for the PoGo craze.
773783386099884032 2016-09-08 07:21:50 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hmm. Never really touched Gentoo, I helped to perpetuate the emergent Gentoo-mocking culture ;) Poked around a bit with openSuSE
773776570984964096 2016-09-07 06:54:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it is justifiable as these systems have been well-established for a while now.
773765931201724417 2016-09-07 06:12:28 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay ugh. Thanks for the synopsis. It seems like an awful mess that should end yesterday.
773713564821442560 2016-09-07 02:44:23 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG on a related note, are you #ENL or #RES?
773706679867158532 2016-09-07 02:17:01 UTC <icedwater> @sgelection @ChannelNewsAsia I don't see the conflict between being nonpartisan and challenging the government of the day.
773703150926651392 2016-09-07 02:03:00 UTC <icedwater> Please read this @jaythenerdkid thread about mental illness. Let's learn to give MI sufferers the respect they need.https://twitter.com/jaythenerdkid/status/773519588499738624
773696141233795072 2016-09-07 01:35:09 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay I thought it was something used to flag people as targets to abuse? Were people using them on themselves as defense?
773694384093003776 2016-09-07 01:28:10 UTC <icedwater> @avalon why do you think it's better?
773694214441799680 2016-09-07 01:27:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yep. Except when I have to run work stuff on Windows.
773693422163025920 2016-09-07 01:24:21 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG still using Ubuntu since 2005. Dabbled a bit with Fedora/Debian, but not enough to switch.
773691754063114240 2016-09-07 01:17:43 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it's definitely a lot better than it was before, but I'm not quite sure it is ready to replace Win/OS X.
773553046672388097 2016-09-07 16:06:32 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @blackadlerqueen let me show you more at the next tweetup :p
773552681499566080 2016-09-07 16:05:05 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @hellofrmSG same here, though I prefer to use the command line where possible I'm still fairly comfortable with Ubuntu et al.
773525969881530368 2016-09-07 14:18:57 UTC <icedwater> @SaiGonSeamus Two @saigonseamus threads that @eisen RTed onto my timeline. Both eye-opening reading. #fb https://twitter.com/SaiGonSeamus/status/773311499011956737 https://twitter.com/SaiGonSeamus/status/773311522927816704
773480355407855616 2016-09-07 11:17:41 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname isn't that only for maki players.
773477780944064512 2016-09-07 11:07:28 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname yup! Has been for a while now. Almost 3 regular #SLeague contracts ago.
773477523271192577 2016-09-07 11:06:26 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale lol thanks
773351509744496640 2016-09-06 02:45:42 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose MUD-themed? Hmm. Tell me more...
773111991896465409 2016-09-06 10:53:57 UTC <icedwater> @BinCentreNAC 116.15.61.89 expected anonymous edit from dunno what kind of IP 
773110480898449409 2016-09-06 10:47:57 UTC <icedwater> @BinCentreNAC lol congratulations. Let me see who put it there and go scold the fella.
773107755200552960 2016-09-06 10:37:07 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @TheFactsBook no fact has "may" as a modal verb. The sun "will" rise in the east.
773061240805478400 2016-09-06 07:32:17 UTC <icedwater> @USChamber nobody is anti-energy. You might say they're pro-life.
773060463311458304 2016-09-06 07:29:11 UTC <icedwater> I have that objection too. My friend replied "you're catching them to fight" and "why does transferring Pokmon give candy?"
773016171368943617 2016-09-05 04:33:11 UTC <icedwater> fascinating article. Have you seen what's in this "discovery math" syllabus?
772949344924205057 2016-09-05 00:07:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG can I have your IC number to enter a lucky draw for $10 please?
772813554567163904 2016-09-05 15:08:04 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple at the end of the day you've another day's odour.
772757816943579138 2016-09-05 11:26:35 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch besides. I pasted and added to their tweeted headline in my tweet and still had room to mention you. They have little excuse.
772757561711800320 2016-09-05 11:25:34 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch the fuss about the headline doesn't ignore her health, in fact that was kind of the point. But yes, hope she gets well soon.
772750519760596993 2016-09-05 10:57:35 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch no, I added to the headline to show that there was plenty of space...
772735524658262020 2016-09-05 09:58:00 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv are congratulations in order? :)
772735362091278336 2016-09-05 09:57:21 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch "Jrue Holiday will miss season start to care for pregnant footballer wife Lauren, who has a brain tumor http://ble.ac/2bWlsQP"
772730973939044352 2016-09-05 09:39:55 UTC <icedwater> Oofhttps://twitter.com/plaetzchen/status/772725399465975808
772730625258237952 2016-09-05 09:38:32 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch just the ones mentioned by headline in the Guardian piece...
772722182635921408 2016-09-05 09:04:59 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch you certainly know how to cherry-pick. The NBA one wasn't the only problem.
772722081188372480 2016-09-05 09:04:35 UTC <icedwater> @u_switch sure, but what about the other outlets?
772637259384311808 2016-09-04 03:27:32 UTC <icedwater> Point to note. "Don't work too hard. Nobody notices anyway." #fbhttps://twitter.com/SlowSlownews/status/772631617659514880
772636980454633473 2016-09-04 03:26:25 UTC <icedwater> @daphnemaia rest well! You'll beat the virus. Then you will have immunity already. Thankfully the microcephaly link hasn't been confirmed...
772595011401584641 2016-09-04 00:39:39 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid anything gonna make its way to SoundCloud? :P
772591580444184576 2016-09-04 00:26:01 UTC <icedwater> @tom_lutz @guardian_sport @u_switch because we're all human and would like to be seen that way?
772577133793193985 2016-09-04 23:28:37 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @m4riannelee ah, you're right. I'd never considered those. Pity we don't have similar things for Malay and Tamil myths.
772479320526696449 2016-09-04 16:59:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG nothing on the scale and depth of Haw Par Villa for the minority cultures as far as I know...
772475672069414912 2016-09-04 16:45:26 UTC <icedwater> @verkur lol.
772096630094868480 2016-09-03 15:39:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG gonna have to ask you more about that next time :)
772096252292894721 2016-09-03 15:37:46 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG OK blocking you now #sleague till I die 
772095941528518656 2016-09-03 15:36:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG did you take leave to curate? That's dedication! :P
772095644928315392 2016-09-03 15:35:21 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG finally able to welcome the new curator somewhat on time. Thanks @patrickpang for the past week, and hello @dcatdemon!
771920879844528128 2016-09-02 04:00:54 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv no, not the deciding factor. But one of the factors.
771920616576344064 2016-09-02 03:59:51 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I'm happy for you, but I don't know that the vowels in coincidence needed any more separation than convention allows for:p
771920108830601216 2016-09-02 03:57:50 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv that doesn't mean it never is.
771913659928850432 2016-09-02 03:32:12 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv that's fair. I did pick the first prominent example that came to mind though.
771913480509149184 2016-09-02 03:31:29 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv why shouldn't they? And did Jewish actors choose not to play those roles? If so, it's quite a different situation.
771912557321789441 2016-09-02 03:27:49 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv well, these aren't quite roles that exist these days, unlike transgender people.
771911363404849152 2016-09-02 03:23:05 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv also, I agree, but if you wanted to cast say, an Indian drag queen stand-up comedian, wouldn't Kumar be first choice?
771910794166415360 2016-09-02 03:20:49 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv feel free to take it up with the original poster :p why, though?
771910391865626624 2016-09-02 03:19:13 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish depends on which way you lie down lah.
771905423284862976 2016-09-02 02:59:28 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv yes, that's true, but it isn't relevant here is it?
771904922367299584 2016-09-02 02:57:29 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv not as common as they used to be, for sure. That's kind of more of the point.
771897238779932673 2016-09-02 02:26:57 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv well that may be true, but subtweeting about it isn't all that cool either.
771774648669220864 2016-09-02 18:19:49 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA which account?
771763667788365825 2016-09-02 17:36:11 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats lucifer, morning star, venus, evening star?
771748935626928128 2016-09-02 16:37:39 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats lucifer is the evening star?
771748603186417665 2016-09-02 16:36:20 UTC <icedwater> @iamthekai was that a stock joke? Because that was... standard and poor.
771748350357975040 2016-09-02 16:35:19 UTC <icedwater> @MicroSFF "No! What have you done..." the father choked back tears of his own. "Proud now, dad?" "No, silly. We're out of glass left eyes."
771738572638396416 2016-09-02 15:56:28 UTC <icedwater> Hopefully anonymised enough, but too funny to pass up. No offence meant guys! #Synchronicitypic.twitter.com/Aelqq30jsd
771736165590274048 2016-09-02 15:46:54 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I'll be working on different things but there's time for a jaunt in the gardens and a Jay Chou concert on Saturday :)
771600956718927872 2016-09-01 06:49:38 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @kuekj if (read(joke)) {     overexplain(joke);     // laugh(); }
771600349069127680 2016-09-01 06:47:13 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname @abearfromSEA not the one with Rooney and Smalling meh
771597780548628480 2016-09-01 06:37:01 UTC <icedwater> @gaileyfrey hope you never have to deal with him again.
771378712591802368 2016-09-01 16:06:31 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj goodyfeed article #47281: how to talk to women on the phone in an uberpool, by KJ Hua
771337569648807936 2016-09-01 13:23:02 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv .... sigh
771280886482423808 2016-09-01 09:37:47 UTC <icedwater> @wahyudiwahid89 look at their funding.. if the #sleague had more money, would you prefer to be paid better or find better marquee players?
771278908792504321 2016-09-01 09:29:56 UTC <icedwater> of course, you're deliberately ignoring my other point about at least trying first :)
771231454080532480 2016-08-31 06:21:22 UTC <icedwater> eh? Nope. Nobody's denying minorities playing a majority role. Majorities shouldn't presume to take those roles.
771230969097392128 2016-08-31 06:19:26 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @x_ai let it come and go...  You come and go- oooooo Life would be easy if your colours were like my dream. Red gold and green...
771217965802938368 2016-08-31 05:27:46 UTC <icedwater> I don't think that's the same. What is "acting trans" or "acting straight"? Stereotypes are preventing them from getting jobs.
771195793164292103 2016-08-31 03:59:39 UTC <icedwater> if they auditioned and failed, nobody could be said they were forbidden. Each approach has problems. We need a trade-off.
771195587077079040 2016-08-31 03:58:50 UTC <icedwater> sure, but if they'd said they tried and failed to get trans actors, I'd be OK. See also white Dragonball, Avatar, etc.
771181220583448576 2016-08-31 03:01:45 UTC <icedwater> sure, take the most absurd possible example and run with it. We have live transgender actors, let them play those roles.
771171237796024320 2016-08-31 02:22:05 UTC <icedwater> do we still have male actors playing women's roles?
771154872041246721 2016-08-31 01:17:03 UTC <icedwater> @SIGILUX that's OK, we're not here to entertain you. You're doing a pretty good job entertaining yourself though :)
771141197649747968 2016-08-31 00:22:43 UTC <icedwater> @SIGILUX @mentalsorcerer just looking at Wikipedia I can find a handful currently active. And those are just the ones who had a page made.
771136485818896384 2016-08-31 00:03:59 UTC <icedwater> @climagic @sameyaahmad @AstroSpanner Helsinki Habit
771135825601896448 2016-08-31 00:01:22 UTC <icedwater> @heathercorinna that's OK, it is hogging your attention after all. :( Get well soon!
771128004684591104 2016-08-31 23:30:17 UTC <icedwater> @SIGILUX no, because clinically diagnosed psychopaths are not always killers.
771127766213287936 2016-08-31 23:29:20 UTC <icedwater> @SIGILUX @mentalsorcerer did they try hard enough?
771033612829339648 2016-08-31 17:15:13 UTC <icedwater> @SIGILUX it may not always be "better", but having someone who lives the role should increase the odds of a more accurate performance.
771033201749790721 2016-08-31 17:13:35 UTC <icedwater> Entire thread. Not just art, but humanity and dignity are protected when we let trans people play trans characters.https://twitter.com/SmartAssJen/status/771020826602647552
771031326069706753 2016-08-31 17:06:07 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA if you don't agree with the initial premise, the conclusion is less of a contradiction :p
771028326974525440 2016-08-31 16:54:12 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah probably the correct full form of sperm in some context. The plural form I know is spermatozoa.
770950233379319808 2016-08-31 11:43:53 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale NASL?
770850457983922176 2016-08-30 05:07:25 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo sorry that you even have to make this disclaimer! This time I was too caught up and I think you deleted it before my client cached it
770841571700768768 2016-08-30 04:32:06 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo heh oops OK
770794938443321345 2016-08-30 01:26:48 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards @AudiKhalid anti-Snorlax? anti-Sinitic? anti-Stupidity? We'll never know now...
770590398058106880 2016-08-30 11:54:02 UTC <icedwater> Well @hellofrmSG, I don't have the details too. But on http://groundupinitiative.org or @GUIkampung we could find out more. My friend works there.
770567249996288004 2016-08-30 10:22:03 UTC <icedwater> @mrbrown @singnoname I work with AI and I approve this statement. For now. 
770563196432166912 2016-08-30 10:05:57 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose the Singapore model seems to work fine for attracting short/medium term migrants though. Let me see what that article says...
770560867238686720 2016-08-30 09:56:41 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish sorry, didn't check Twitter. Feel free!
770524343394676736 2016-08-30 07:31:33 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM Souls regenerated from fragments found on old toothbrushes are worth double. That explains what you've been telling @eisen.
770500604443627520 2016-08-29 05:57:13 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish not me but just ask? I can pass them on.
770500278915334144 2016-08-29 05:55:56 UTC <icedwater> I still don't think it makes sense that queues stretch across entire platforms. There are two lanes. Use them.https://twitter.com/TODAYonline/status/770490760361709568
770272605005762560 2016-08-29 14:51:14 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane definitely feeling this after my driving lesson just ended 
770234124841783298 2016-08-29 12:18:20 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats ah well. Just gonna buy the refills.
770231959264124928 2016-08-29 12:09:43 UTC <icedwater> Hmm. Interesting. /reminds self to look into this. Thanks @kellabyte!https://twitter.com/kellabyte/status/770125596730986497
770231021530779648 2016-08-29 12:06:00 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @kevincollier I think there are other links between the services, but I don't know for sure. Is this sufficient?
770227810786955265 2016-08-29 11:53:14 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez stay that way 
770172668494557184 2016-08-29 08:14:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG have you heard of the Ground-Up Initiative? Might be good for weekend fun!
770121607805333507 2016-08-28 04:51:14 UTC <icedwater> @abcdpple it's easy to attack people online if you don't know much about them eh?
770117996853559296 2016-08-28 04:36:53 UTC <icedwater> @padangbolasepak eh. http://Wordpress.com is using IIS?!
769699549115887616 2016-08-27 00:54:07 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid @pot7atorainbow agreed! I'm very much in the rest of the world camp.

769338630011617280 2016-08-26 00:59:57 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual @WhatTheFFacts OK, which?
769337577216221186 2016-08-26 00:55:46 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane yeah and hot soupy stuff! No wraps or salads in that weather for me.
769323428683788289 2016-08-26 23:59:33 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren yeah it's called pokemongo and the password is greatball 
769202883766079488 2016-08-26 16:00:33 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname I literally can't tell. Maybe that should be a feature in a new app...
769199822502977536 2016-08-26 15:48:23 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I use Fenix on Android. I think deleting tweets doesn't affect those already downloaded. I am still reading Wed evening. :/
769198078578483200 2016-08-26 15:41:27 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren free for kopi and chill tomorrow afternoon?
769197400057491456 2016-08-26 15:38:45 UTC <icedwater> @keeweeeee @kiampah @ladystormhold heh. I didn't know it was called "travelling deep" but I've long preferred that to checkpoint photography
769178870016684032 2016-08-26 14:25:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG indeed.
769175999577661441 2016-08-26 14:13:43 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo no, sorry. I'm literally 3 days behind on tweets. It was already loaded on my timeline and I replied before I knew it was deleted.
769165076716621824 2016-08-26 13:30:19 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yeah... some keep a 383cp Pikachu, others keep a 384cp Raichu... *sips #chuncuihemilktea*
769164083635425280 2016-08-26 13:26:22 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @whyvo yeah. I did preface my tweet with a disclaimer 
769162530572820480 2016-08-26 13:20:12 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname is right, but I suppose @whyvo deleted the tweet? My reply seems to be the head of the thread :p
769123994674929664 2016-08-26 10:47:04 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo ah yeah. See. 3 days backlog.
769123522132127745 2016-08-26 10:45:11 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas @SwiftOnSecurity was there proof of this, and could that have been turned off? No less bad, mind, just wondering.
769123268745834496 2016-08-26 10:44:11 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo a bit late as I'm catching up on tweets, but didn't SR Nathan's 2 terms mean a total of 12 years?
769008618226135040 2016-08-25 03:08:36 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty I hope @FinnBalor will come back with a new non-awful design for the belt he never lost. Maybe the Demon King's Championship.
768652607879380993 2016-08-24 03:33:57 UTC <icedwater> @avalon would you be ready by then though? Sorry for not keeping in touch since the visit :(
768627165583642629 2016-08-24 01:52:51 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I didn't see it as an attack, but maybe I should read between the lines more often. I agree that it was a bit exaggerated though.
768243181313937408 2016-08-23 00:27:02 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale he needs to stay there as long as it's the PM's ward. What if he goes elsewhere and gets into Parliament? 
767924476847591424 2016-08-22 03:20:37 UTC <icedwater> @aisyahgala some people don't know what it takes for a career in full-time sports, or are just bitter. #stayabove
767896402672295936 2016-08-22 01:29:03 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify good that you're in a better environment now!
766997683261157376 2016-08-20 13:57:52 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya a gold medal, because Singaporeans are used to being first at everything.
766973699295547392 2016-08-20 12:22:34 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang @WWE life imitates art, eh.
766816948369752064 2016-08-19 01:59:41 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I agree, but somehow I read your tweet as "they will vote ruling party".
766703741386895361 2016-08-19 18:29:51 UTC <icedwater> @furryphotos JavaScript so popular ah
766583827900698624 2016-08-19 10:33:21 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo non partisan means they will take sides?
766430254332121088 2016-08-18 00:23:06 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz just allow him to eat a piece!
766429999633043456 2016-08-18 00:22:06 UTC <icedwater> @nurasirah I'm sure it recharges them when they get a response from someone...
766429309737197568 2016-08-18 00:19:21 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I think it's easier for almost anyone else to protest in the streets than people of Arab descent in the US... #justsaying
766428617869885440 2016-08-18 00:16:36 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale that commentator wasn't.
766427888912478208 2016-08-18 00:13:42 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale Xinjiapo? Singkapor? Singkaypoh? @singnoname?
766311149700653056 2016-08-18 16:29:50 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname who will help me form a Singlish Justice League... lah?
766310510128009217 2016-08-18 16:27:17 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale I am also SJW. Spelling Justice Warrior.
766309559753248769 2016-08-18 16:23:31 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake have you seen some 18yo Europeans... :p
766309288708968448 2016-08-18 16:22:26 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats I shall if I ever pass a breadtalk and am awake enough to remember.
766309088619696128 2016-08-18 16:21:38 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai well... who actually needs Twitter or Facebook, right... 
766308889658658817 2016-08-18 16:20:51 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname disassociate or dissociate...? Hmm
766267160477835265 2016-08-18 13:35:02 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale wahahahahhahahaa
766267119075856384 2016-08-18 13:34:52 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale pick*
766266919980707840 2016-08-18 13:34:04 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @GaryKLH is that next to Sengkang and after Houkang?
766135599484895232 2016-08-17 04:52:15 UTC <icedwater> @RealPaigeWWE happy birthday! Heard from some YouTube channel that you were injured. Hope you get better soon!
766135196869537792 2016-08-17 04:50:39 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH @rennardho hey, being able to defend your views in the face of opposing views is how you get balance...
766134269815033856 2016-08-17 04:46:58 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @rennardho @abearfromSEA ya lor. You might be wincriminated instead ;) But seriously why would you?
766133864930484224 2016-08-17 04:45:22 UTC <icedwater> eh I thought nasi pattaya is when you wrap the rice with the omelette? This is different, or is Al-Ameen wrong?
766098122032320512 2016-08-17 02:23:20 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld we used to have. I'm sure there still are some! But the first thing I think of now when I hear Bugis is a shopping area... :p
766093159742836736 2016-08-17 02:03:37 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld do you speak a local language in addition to Bahasa Indonesia and English? What are the Makassar dialects like?
766090909695954944 2016-08-17 01:54:40 UTC <icedwater> @baroka but what about all the bloggers who don't blog?!?! 
766089628789067776 2016-08-17 01:49:35 UTC <icedwater> @OleAlexander oh look! One step closer to a literal @internetofshit!
765776923435929600 2016-08-16 05:07:00 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GaryKLH "her Chinese kind" is "our Chinese kind", just a few generations apart.
765776375429169153 2016-08-16 05:04:49 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter 
765776257875320832 2016-08-16 05:04:21 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale I'm not well articulated either, I need to hit the gym more often. And not a Pokgym.
765776123653451776 2016-08-16 05:03:49 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale careful, you're so negative we might have to bury you. 
765775500551872513 2016-08-16 05:01:21 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale "can put more alphabets" => "write more". Saved you quite a few already :p
765719496501760001 2016-08-16 01:18:49 UTC <icedwater> @sophiaphotos tempeh is delicious! Enjoy :)
765610416793726977 2016-08-16 18:05:22 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho the good news is you don't have to die! Just keep believing and trying out new things!
765586159003136000 2016-08-16 16:28:58 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho many people are so afraid to screw things up that they stick to the tried and tested and wonder why they are never happy.
765582415813156864 2016-08-16 16:14:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @singnoname I'm not so keen on reading the comments though...
765498170021285888 2016-08-16 10:39:20 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish so a bit less :p
765467463056134144 2016-08-16 08:37:19 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish no, because if you didn't say it out loud that would also be quite passive-aggressive :p
765433513470341120 2016-08-15 06:22:25 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish lol. Did you say that? Because...
765380429356503040 2016-08-15 02:51:29 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty Cech Holding Chambers, the Can Ibe of 2016 
765218157619400704 2016-08-15 16:06:40 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname that would be @kosherjellyfish as @hellofrmSG who is the cupping fan, if I remember correctly.
765217709894139904 2016-08-15 16:04:53 UTC <icedwater> @hwsoh with which hand?!
765196740907589632 2016-08-15 14:41:34 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim watched a few games, both days. Maybe my colour temperature setting was off? Some bits were glaring. Logo invisible at replays.
765194879521607680 2016-08-15 14:34:10 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim it's cleaner but I don't really like it somehow. Don't know if it's the colour combination, the sliding, or something else.
765193260998340608 2016-08-15 14:27:44 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail yup!
765154200980369408 2016-08-15 11:52:32 UTC <icedwater> Good troll https://twitter.com/sidin/status/764269467249545216
765153174827118597 2016-08-15 11:48:27 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic do you remember the date and the answer?
765152710962188288 2016-08-15 11:46:36 UTC <icedwater> Wah. https://twitter.com/HarambeTho/status/764353962577453056
765152264478523392 2016-08-15 11:44:50 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM you can wait a while, I think. Bulbapedia (#TIL) shows it as entry 222 in the Pokdex! http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Corsola_(Pokmon)
765139359234260992 2016-08-15 10:53:33 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail you know why there wasn't a holiday today? Because Schooling can't be stopped. #shades
765137993422123008 2016-08-15 10:48:07 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen when do you want to watch? Let me know :) We have exported some good talent to Malaysia too :)
764854221610979328 2016-08-14 16:00:31 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic @kuekj @eisen yeah. So it got trimmed out of Tg Pagar while LKY was still around.
764811375935787008 2016-08-14 13:10:16 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling just joined. Good luck!
764788592430292992 2016-08-14 11:39:44 UTC <icedwater> @eisen liar. Where is the airplane in front
764782205985927169 2016-08-14 11:14:21 UTC <icedwater> @kixes sigh.
764782018307555328 2016-08-14 11:13:36 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @stressaholic @kuekj it seems to be part of the GRC. How do we question why ;)
764757619504402432 2016-08-14 09:36:39 UTC <icedwater> I wonder why Jalan Besar Town Council was involved in a project at Indus Road... worth looking into #fbpic.twitter.com/xP6CaF5zUU
764726847548428289 2016-08-14 07:34:23 UTC <icedwater> @annispice because the only other person who could have loved you was your father?
764648275420905475 2016-08-13 02:22:09 UTC <icedwater> Oh yeah. Got a missed call from 999 this morning, the voicemail was a poorly-cut Chinese recording. Who's trying to DDoS the police... #fb
764646295101321216 2016-08-13 02:14:17 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz and yet the precision available to academics is difficult to project into street language...
764645629725290496 2016-08-13 02:11:39 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch are you in SG now?!
764645263218618368 2016-08-13 02:10:11 UTC <icedwater> @enghuachua are you listening to yourself? Are we still in 1916?
764640336538841089 2016-08-13 01:50:37 UTC <icedwater> @STcom @nickppt surely that's a technicality... the point is that someone in Parliament recognizes this at least?
764637048405827584 2016-08-13 01:37:33 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @annispice that doesn't mean there aren't people close to her who might not have wanted her to die...
764473356062121986 2016-08-13 14:47:05 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld it's +56 for me as you can see 
764169254551756800 2016-08-12 18:38:42 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess work confidential I suppose.
764168984556023808 2016-08-12 18:37:38 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG no can see poll. But I thought if you don't say @kuekj is your favourite you will kena ban from curation 
764168627033559040 2016-08-12 18:36:12 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill sorry, did I miss your initial point?
764143117519822849 2016-08-12 16:54:50 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim #thestruggleisreal
764016836195160065 2016-08-12 08:33:03 UTC <icedwater> Yes, @MightyStags! That's the spirit! Looking forward to a white-hot end to the #SLeague season with@ALB_S_FC
763902588433551360 2016-08-11 00:59:04 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake there's one world record I know Singapore will never try to break!
763901756623290368 2016-08-11 00:55:46 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG eh, did he reach it before Schooling did?
763898598094364672 2016-08-11 00:43:12 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld lol!
763825051099537408 2016-08-11 19:50:58 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz much better for the refugees there who use the system to mutual benefit than for mutual loss in the Australian case?
763695156293832705 2016-08-11 11:14:48 UTC <icedwater> Don't install iOS 10 until you've read this: let's see if this petition can slow down planned obsolescence. http://d.shpg.org/221683520t
763639454061830144 2016-08-11 07:33:28 UTC <icedwater> it's the same thing, just that now sets of people's properties are intersecting rather than abstract concepts...
763537958544691200 2016-08-10 00:50:09 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname 
763430298226860036 2016-08-10 17:42:21 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai hahaha why didn't you tell me. Cos about girls there's something I should have known...
763429842599616512 2016-08-10 17:40:32 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GaryKLH if comebacks can happen within matches, who's to say they won't happen between them?
763422726375641088 2016-08-10 17:12:16 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname has certainly mellowed with age  @GaryKLH
763422392571957248 2016-08-10 17:10:56 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul remind me to parse this tomorrow
763411922309947400 2016-08-10 16:29:20 UTC <icedwater> @FuzzyLeapfrog in the same way you save money by not using it at all...
763411757708685312 2016-08-10 16:28:41 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump @DMC1982Nice is obviously an Illuminatiberal plant to destroy the unity of the One True Party of the Republic of the USA.
763410883607277569 2016-08-10 16:25:12 UTC <icedwater> @aisyahgala you're doing us proud already! Keep going! 
763408345495588864 2016-08-10 16:15:07 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH that our water-based Pokmon are the strongest!
763407017507553280 2016-08-10 16:09:51 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG I've stopped questioning the FT who choose to represent us in sports. I question the system that keeps wanting them.
763405985050353664 2016-08-10 16:05:44 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM wow that's a real-life Lure. Nice.
763402559344173056 2016-08-10 15:52:08 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen ah OK. I didn't watch it yesterday :p Ploughing through tweets now. #betterthantoggle
763399089543262208 2016-08-10 15:38:20 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen at the parade or in general? There were quite a few lady battery commanders when I was in NS.
763397889930375169 2016-08-10 15:33:34 UTC <icedwater> @astar_research @divroyalty I hope it's an @ASTAR_RESEARCH thing...
763397533242499072 2016-08-10 15:32:09 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM sorry. It was a reference to the Pokmon game, do you play it?
763396961143697409 2016-08-10 15:29:53 UTC <icedwater> @Thfakehipster how many people's trust were lost at the first ad?
763395810469916673 2016-08-10 15:25:19 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM that's a level 21 Blackmail with a CP of 302...
763394399275356162 2016-08-10 15:19:42 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill you think all Buddhists are peaceful...
763378927465209856 2016-08-10 14:18:13 UTC <icedwater> @rsilvers @avarenity does it really make a difference though?
763211461413875712 2016-08-09 03:12:46 UTC <icedwater> nicely dodged. Heh I went to google the rest. Marg Bar Amrika is scary though.
762966743622950912 2016-08-09 11:00:21 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH @singnoname level 7: ask why there are levels in the first place ;)
762932923787939840 2016-08-09 08:45:58 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH it's a sign of his privileged access to training and resources. Population size is a red herring.
762853816391782402 2016-08-08 03:31:37 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH I couldn't miss it, you've been on it for a while. I was referring to @abearfromSEA questioning the validity of the comparison.
762853410081124352 2016-08-08 03:30:00 UTC <icedwater> ugh like*
762853377638215681 2016-08-08 03:29:53 UTC <icedwater> I lile Japo. Haha where are you coming up with these names 
762853081679749120 2016-08-08 03:28:42 UTC <icedwater> yeah. The referendum was only on how we should leave, not if...
762851093705392128 2016-08-08 03:20:48 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @ileksua which would have meant better exchange between Thai and Singapore players?
762850668000403460 2016-08-08 03:19:06 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA why, when it's valid to compare Olympic juniors with World Cup seniors?
762846281119129601 2016-08-08 03:01:41 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai woah. Freaky shit. 0/10 going Pokmon is safer.
762843989439500288 2016-08-08 02:52:34 UTC <icedwater> @avalon ugh. That is the suck. When did it start? Is it a nutrition issue...
762842765029801984 2016-08-08 02:47:42 UTC <icedwater> @tiakhui @eisen @teenicholas hmm, it worked on a bus too if I counted correctly....

762834813480873984 2016-08-08 02:16:06 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess in fairness it has to be said I seldom use Windows if I can, so the updating comes rarely.
762736587092336640 2016-08-08 19:45:47 UTC <icedwater> Finally got Ubuntu *on* Windows. Just CLI, no GUI, exactly how I like it. Here's my blog post on the experience: http://www.icedwater.com/dont-bash-it-until-youve-tried-it/ #fb
762701184578625536 2016-08-08 17:25:07 UTC <icedwater> I'd like to believe that there are enough adherents who are moderate (in either religion) to cause an inward drift.
762700555760181248 2016-08-08 17:22:37 UTC <icedwater> @PitchInvAsian boon* I haven't heard your podcast yet but if it lets more Singapore players join Hassan there, it's a plus. If they do join.
762695472049901568 2016-08-08 17:02:25 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake so fast ah. Only 10+... heh jiayou!
762695238464843776 2016-08-08 17:01:29 UTC <icedwater> hmm, but there are "moderate Muslims" also right? Or are they "not true Muslims"?
762692975541432320 2016-08-08 16:52:30 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @hellofrmSG got leh.
762692889415593985 2016-08-08 16:52:09 UTC <icedwater> hmm. OK.
762679787131314177 2016-08-08 16:00:05 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess I'll be updating a live blog at http://www.icedwater.com/dont-bash-it-until-youve-tried-it/ as I go along :)
762679078247890944 2016-08-08 15:57:16 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany @darkhorse166 Germans are protective of their personal data, so they need less mobile data anyway? 
762579835600252928 2016-08-08 09:22:55 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess I might try it tonight.
762573634116263936 2016-08-08 08:58:16 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH wah sure not.
762546201459777538 2016-08-08 07:09:16 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM also if you forget history, how do you know you're not just repeating the mistakes of the past?
762469342218858496 2016-08-07 02:03:51 UTC <icedwater> @MatthewACherry @Timothy_Garland so there is a mobile phone there... what about it?
762468486601859073 2016-08-07 02:00:27 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling @colinscassady nah, they're practicing trash talk promos for the real thing. They'll switch to wrestling when they tire ;)
762467602035642372 2016-08-07 01:56:56 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz OK, so Japan had to solve their manpower issues earlier... then?
762335176231747585 2016-08-07 17:10:44 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany @whereisemil at some point there shall be Koffing bei Rathausplatz and Weezing am Offenbad too 
762334538827649025 2016-08-07 17:08:12 UTC <icedwater> lolwut. #meddlingreligioustypes
762334170173452290 2016-08-07 17:06:44 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @neverknownfacts facts and opinions are two different things...
762333788709924865 2016-08-07 17:05:13 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @kuekj I don't know if it still is, but I was talking about channel 5 heh
762279822512918528 2016-08-07 13:30:46 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG now you can't even get free #SLeague on channel 5..
762272154436067329 2016-08-07 13:00:18 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I think Rashomon might have come first... or gnomon
762271892854018048 2016-08-07 12:59:16 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @SamsungPay anybody thinking where all this iris ID info is going and what can be done with it? #GalaxyNo
762270587867713536 2016-08-07 12:54:05 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus no, just a Langgar. Or a .
762270361173975041 2016-08-07 12:53:11 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen I thought it would be Fukienese though, because Fuzhou is another dialect. Where did this appear?
762269940548186112 2016-08-07 12:51:30 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @WimpyLion it is racist and redundant. How many Chinese prata men do you know (outside Parliament)?
762268923098050560 2016-08-07 12:47:28 UTC <icedwater> @nico_velez34 the sponsors will probably not stay more than one season though... 
762268723642105856 2016-08-07 12:46:40 UTC <icedwater> @Footy_Jokes because football fans don't need to read and thus won't be annoyed by semi-visible subtitles...
762267555838910464 2016-08-07 12:42:02 UTC <icedwater> don't give me a heart attack... we have a first gold?! 
762265527943213056 2016-08-07 12:33:58 UTC <icedwater> @GodfreyElfwick sarcasm doesn't become you.
762265242780839936 2016-08-07 12:32:50 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StirringTrouble I suppose it fits a certain narrative to portray country X as being under threat from Japan, etc
762254060044980224 2016-08-07 11:48:24 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @Pulotutui if not then, when would HCs brief their players?
762248286367420417 2016-08-07 11:25:28 UTC <icedwater> I wonder what sporting excellence we shall observe at #Rio2016.
762246803534209025 2016-08-07 11:19:34 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA waiting for Pokmon hunters to wander onto the floor during said exercise 
762228717745602560 2016-08-07 10:07:42 UTC <icedwater> @Hurricanesrugby @Pulotutui @notabilia I love Twitter.pic.twitter.com/Ek82hSr32n

762209979805818880 2016-08-07 08:53:15 UTC <icedwater> Hmm I wonder if this works for Ingress too. Feels like that's why the "force reload" option was there. https://twitter.com/sherminmin/status/761814290525327360

762208089684664320 2016-08-07 08:45:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA katakana is used for non-native words. Which is pretty much what names of foreign countries are.
762202063300206592 2016-08-07 08:21:47 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @RealTimers then again, they might lead to enhanced mosquito performance...
762201233343979525 2016-08-07 08:18:29 UTC <icedwater> @joanna_jane they should differ slightly on the last vowel. But neither is commonly available in Singapore...

762176806476591104 2016-08-06 06:41:25 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid @shimmertje8 I'm not saying don't report, I think it's not such a clear-cut decision. Plus I was just observing a trend.
762175510189264897 2016-08-06 06:36:16 UTC <icedwater> @Markrichmond71 lol. tudo bem?
762173566389325824 2016-08-06 06:28:33 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid This is a thread about @audikhalid's experience with a radical in Singapore. How would you react?https://twitter.com/AudiKhalid/status/761562477662396416
762173174033231872 2016-08-06 06:26:59 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid I like how almost all those urging you to report are of the majority ethnicity...
762162899468943362 2016-08-06 05:46:10 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA did you mean "barista"? It looks like you're trying to start a coffee shop. Do you need help?pic.twitter.com/89nsTJrR48

761754402478710788 2016-08-05 02:42:56 UTC <icedwater> you mean recording songs onto cassettes from the radio 
761752934061268992 2016-08-05 02:37:06 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @nickbilton was there an article that went with this? Because I kind of miss the point here...
761751069282009088 2016-08-05 02:29:42 UTC <icedwater> @ConradKaz @sonictempest @BecketAdams it's a legitimate mistake. Don't you see there was plenty of orange in the crowd?
761749281409597441 2016-08-05 02:22:35 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz true, yet I don't go around quoting from any holy book or use religious symbols that I don't personally believe in. It's decency.
761746046514900992 2016-08-05 02:09:44 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth just breaking even isn't bankruptcy; also not success. He might be successful, but the metric doesn't show.
761740764174954497 2016-08-05 01:48:45 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth nope. If you lead a company of 500 people and only 7 of them resign that isn't success either. That's OK.
761740170563428352 2016-08-05 01:46:23 UTC <icedwater> @wpsg it's not easy to quantify how bad food has gone when left in the open for a day. Flies? Smell? Taste? But we still prevent it.
761738189862088706 2016-08-05 01:38:31 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth oh, come now. We're just going around in circles. Not going bankrupt is not success. It's the bare minimum.
761587653707837440 2016-08-05 15:40:20 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen @pewpewpowah oof. Some people only hear about their privilege if it's shouted out loud. Which in itself is a privilege.
761586823420260352 2016-08-05 15:37:02 UTC <icedwater> @marcoagutier haha thanks a lot! If only I had the funding to reproduce this study... ;)
761563639593570305 2016-08-05 14:04:55 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth which was my initial issue - the metric posted in the picture didn't seem to show success.
761538466005913600 2016-08-05 12:24:53 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth I wasn't talking about those people. It was a comment on the low bar for "success". :)
761526486314590208 2016-08-05 11:37:17 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth I'm not interested in starting a business. But I believe you need credit to start one :)
761524626228858880 2016-08-05 11:29:53 UTC <icedwater> @Conservative_VW @NelsonForTruth expert apostrophe trolling, or am I giving you too much credit :)
761523941110185984 2016-08-05 11:27:10 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname tong xin ru yi steamboat, 68 boat quay. Would recommend. Their set for two is really for 3.5 ...

761492447004286976 2016-08-05 09:22:01 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @pohui but I agree that mandating frequent changes causes patterns to arise.
761491862779682816 2016-08-05 09:19:42 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @pohui the idea is for a second layer of authentication that only you can access. Give away your house keys, robbers will come.

761474028749987841 2016-08-05 08:08:50 UTC <icedwater> @NelsonForTruth @Conservative_VW um. If your definition of success is to not go bankrupt...
761426535064571905 2016-08-04 05:00:07 UTC <icedwater> if there was a need to pay to cover up some things, then they should have been reported.
761417382950637568 2016-08-04 04:23:45 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH ah, I thought there might be something like that. Thanks!
761346710421381120 2016-08-04 23:42:55 UTC <icedwater> @KatrinaPierson what is this, a horse race? A dog show? Seriously.
761346191728582656 2016-08-04 23:40:51 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA Pahang could still finish above Selangor if each get 18 and 0 out of their remaining 18 respectively
761341357117931520 2016-08-04 23:21:39 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA come to think of it, how is Anders Aplin still eligible? Did he start a Masters?
761341101538091008 2016-08-04 23:20:38 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA the odd thing is that there don't seem to be any *actual* allegations of cheating, but #TLS do seem to be hiding something.
761340448614920192 2016-08-04 23:18:02 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA valid questions raised by @GaryKLH; wonder if we'll ever know the truth. Investigation > speculation. Yet #TLS is far away...

761012802416816128 2016-08-03 01:36:05 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA someone is trying to #StopTheBear. But that button only works when the bear has already come to a complete stop.

760987735045791745 2016-08-03 23:56:29 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @eisen probably no loss, but just like a 90-minute time limit at buffets, it's the restrictions that hurt.

760642904368885760 2016-08-02 01:06:15 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh sure. But the concept of telemarketing in general is kind of annoying. I know it's a job, but nobody wants those calls either.
760642412096032768 2016-08-02 01:04:17 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz my guess is it encourages treating women as faceless tools for producing children for the nation?
760503756601511940 2016-08-02 15:53:19 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv hmm. The line between style and error is tough to cleanly draw.
760501072808976384 2016-08-02 15:42:39 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh thank goodness, I don't. I'm not saying you don't do any good, but I wonder why this model is still valid in this day and age.
760496221425315844 2016-08-02 15:23:23 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh let me know the contact details so I can block  You meant email/sms blast right?
760495179379777536 2016-08-02 15:19:14 UTC <icedwater> @cvndyfloss @ali41911468 it's an irrelevant distinction as the headline also ignores it...
760494894695669760 2016-08-02 15:18:06 UTC <icedwater> @LitChick79 @cvndyfloss @SRK1970R lol. Headlines, like tweets, contain little nuance. This allows plenty of deliberate misinterpretations.
760442457733541888 2016-08-02 11:49:44 UTC <icedwater> I think you meant "piqued".
760441423879479296 2016-08-02 11:45:38 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh got. It reminds you that even revolutionaries disagree and can still work together.
760440402889482240 2016-08-02 11:41:35 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh knowing how and where to look up information; to what level you can to trust it and why or why not, that is a skill.
760438888636657665 2016-08-02 11:35:33 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh but basically accumulating information is only a small part of education.
760438741580165120 2016-08-02 11:34:58 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh some people take longer :)
760419519244316672 2016-08-02 10:18:35 UTC <icedwater> @virginangelic @mintea @shimmertje8 @infernoxv then you should have said "were", unless it's still relevant today...
760418463567405057 2016-08-02 10:14:24 UTC <icedwater> @alexmiller73 @abearfromSEA @sportingintel almost all, when you consider that banks and insurance are pretty much gambling :p
760412795024224256 2016-08-02 09:51:52 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock I haven't seen any problems with that station, but maybe I always pass through at non-peak hours. It seems there's enough space.
760399348458860544 2016-08-02 08:58:26 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh education is learning to learn and think so that when you forget something you know how and where to look it up again :p
760273089259188224 2016-08-01 00:36:44 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @shimmertje8 l agree, but the same applies for social aptitude. Then again, bluster might Trump both.
760272431936212992 2016-08-01 00:34:07 UTC <icedwater> @sonictempest I think it's a simpler measure of preference when the choice is (more than?) binary. Will need to read more about it.
760268980506415104 2016-08-01 00:20:24 UTC <icedwater> @FirstLookAsia we all must can #SpeakGoodSinglish because it's local culture OK? Now Jetstar lidat I damn happy. Got more then lagi better.
760113409329238016 2016-08-01 14:02:13 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @shimmertje8 yah lol the rest got more EQ 
760112628857319425 2016-08-01 13:59:07 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah  what a waste of egg yolk..
760109630584258560 2016-08-01 13:47:12 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv she'd still be representing the traditionally oppressed. It's a landmark for a political minority (in the US).
760107124336697344 2016-08-01 13:37:15 UTC <icedwater> @SumitaPahwa @RyanJSuto @infernoxv @KarlreMarks I wonder Singapore stands on this chart 
760106847990788097 2016-08-01 13:36:09 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @PhillyCustoms it's still not OK to hit a woman.. but this was almost subhuman aggression, and it would have been self-defence.
760094278450196480 2016-08-01 12:46:12 UTC <icedwater> @sonictempest I liked it, but I was a little puzzled by the metric. I wonder if this is common to use most fav x/least fav y?
760092178768990208 2016-08-01 12:37:51 UTC <icedwater> @Enopoletus I'm not sure I follow this line of reasoning. Please explain?
760090894519283712 2016-08-01 12:32:45 UTC <icedwater> @notabilia @STcom actually they should have launched it at the @sgwritersfest Opening...
760083855969705989 2016-08-01 12:04:47 UTC <icedwater> ??!!?!https://twitter.com/FastCompany/status/759402363094376448
760082137261367297 2016-08-01 11:57:57 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren I have always enjoyed SatU 
759988582148808704 2016-07-31 05:46:12 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock it's just that one station... every other interchange is connected internally.
759985214579875840 2016-07-31 05:32:49 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb there will be fatigue for sure. But better that than lack of match fitness? Dunno
759957013967216640 2016-07-31 03:40:46 UTC <icedwater> @UncleCav4 use your large head to think. Don't be silly.
759956721129312260 2016-07-31 03:39:36 UTC <icedwater> .@realDonaldTrump looks more and more like the parody account I wish it were @neiljhk
759928847261237249 2016-07-31 01:48:50 UTC <icedwater> I read this somehow as something like"I've rolled myself into a paper bag"
759928017971847168 2016-07-31 01:45:32 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @neverknownfacts if you go deaf enough nothing can stress you out :)
759924511181381635 2016-07-31 01:31:36 UTC <icedwater> This short thread needs to be read. Thanks @iyad_elbaghdadi; and @eisen for RTing.https://twitter.com/iyad_elbaghdadi/status/759158116260777984
759915636239642624 2016-07-31 00:56:20 UTC <icedwater> @Jan4USA you do?
759804346531840001 2016-07-31 17:34:07 UTC <icedwater> @Euroclassica meh I'd buy that from anyone but "I have a double MA" @infernoxv ;)
759803380176859139 2016-07-31 17:30:16 UTC <icedwater> @DarkStream @ToddHuffRadio @Jan4USA surely you jest
759802975497826306 2016-07-31 17:28:40 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz aiyoh. I'd forgotten his existence.
759776107780386816 2016-07-31 15:41:54 UTC <icedwater> @hsiao_yun @ashley it's a little simplistic to assume ignorance is the only reason people vote for Trump though. He runs a strong campaign.
759574969751736320 2016-07-30 02:22:39 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium it's true some things can only be done top-down. But we don't have the numbers to justify top-down action also.
759574118261850112 2016-07-30 02:19:16 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium not enough people have supported the S.League, let's be honest. And supporting matches is one thing; supporting careers?
759571519911571456 2016-07-30 02:08:57 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium nope. We need people, not gods. ;) We need to support our sports more. Not wait for intervention from the top down.
759561915400003584 2016-07-30 01:30:47 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium it's the same structural problems. The women's team only started *getting attention* recently, but even then, ugh
759557957793091584 2016-07-30 01:15:03 UTC <icedwater> @indoorstadium women's team getting smashed also. We're finally performing at our level. The system's flaws are showing.
759438483236675584 2016-07-30 17:20:18 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM are any of them on the mainland? I'm guessing not...
759438057988730880 2016-07-30 17:18:37 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb eh they got odds for friendly one meh.
759421967850024960 2016-07-30 16:14:41 UTC <icedwater> @ZeeKoTCF just saw this when @abearfromSEA complained I'd ignored him; actually he'd just been muted. Happy belated birthday! #StopTheBear
759419209910673414 2016-07-30 16:03:43 UTC <icedwater> Psst @abearfromSEA @GaryKLH it was this one lor.https://twitter.com/STcom/status/759419065492344832

759208005204410369 2016-07-29 02:04:28 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv oh dear!!!
759207715797364736 2016-07-29 02:03:19 UTC <icedwater> @mhdsymil what colour would a plain white T be if it faded? 
759050519025360898 2016-07-29 15:38:40 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c what do you want from an outlet that can't spell spaghetti?
759050177621528580 2016-07-29 15:37:19 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM I think @notabilia can tell you?
759047848902008832 2016-07-29 15:28:04 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid before my birthday ends, let me send some encouragement your way. Go out and conquer!
758989371869499395 2016-07-29 11:35:42 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen good job, thanks for sharing :)
758984986309472257 2016-07-29 11:18:16 UTC <icedwater> @cricantrail thanks man!
758858005337116672 2016-07-28 02:53:42 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter isn't it true though?
758850781160218625 2016-07-28 02:24:59 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv one stems from the other, though, and we should probably try to deal with the problem before it becomes one...
758678104999010304 2016-07-28 14:58:50 UTC <icedwater> I can't wait for Pokmon Go to hit Singapore. Free walkways, cleaner walls in pedestrian tunnels...https://twitter.com/tokyotimes/status/758181112757661698
758677788756811776 2016-07-28 14:57:35 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv "come back now! I ask abunehneh come and catch you ah!", "Mandarin-speaking only", etc...
758674632756953088 2016-07-28 14:45:02 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv thinkable? You think it's not already a reality?
758674409317998592 2016-07-28 14:44:09 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv fair, I suppose, but the problem is really tiny and suggests no causal link between profiling and those acts.
758673468959240193 2016-07-28 14:40:25 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @TNPSports is the League Cup a new paper cup? I suppose the Singapore Cup is made of styrofoam at least...
758660751372324864 2016-07-28 13:49:53 UTC <icedwater> @thetrudz lol. Linux users would read this as "send the output from trees into humans" which, mmm, fruity.
758656680095653888 2016-07-28 13:33:42 UTC <icedwater> @KartierKush I suppose this means all girls have killed more than 5 people in their lifetime...
758550829838307328 2016-07-27 06:33:05 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch Splatwurst
758452210032181248 2016-07-27 00:01:12 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @aticusyap on what basis?
758451567796236288 2016-07-27 23:58:39 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv hmm, the article was updated then
758442282026532864 2016-07-27 23:21:45 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv just sloppy journalism? Your initial link didn't mention Daesh, it was the BBC article that did...
758441248394928128 2016-07-27 23:17:39 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv does the affiliation matter if it was "in the name of ISIS"? It's an act of terror, even if they were Buddhist or Zen.
758323268289900545 2016-07-27 15:28:50 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah ...
758322841557213185 2016-07-27 15:27:09 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling the Liontamer, THAT was painful!
758322041313341440 2016-07-27 15:23:58 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen happy belated birthday :)
758319407261032449 2016-07-27 15:13:30 UTC <icedwater> @theyishusblog sponsors have nothing to do with it, I think... do we have their updated sponsorship criteria?
758318767709401088 2016-07-27 15:10:57 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen for UK it can be that kid that @iamjohnoliver found :)
758318140438622209 2016-07-27 15:08:28 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart @blackadlerqueen OMG they plagiarised this story for POPEYE! Spinach is totally puke right?!
758317637818429440 2016-07-27 15:06:28 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart that time where got Malaysia...

758316071644303360 2016-07-27 15:00:14 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 that escalated quickly. @iam_somewhere @LividEye @x_ai
758312009842569216 2016-07-27 14:44:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG eh. Got no Malay cartoonist to draw Badang meh...
758311674528923648 2016-07-27 14:42:46 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @hellofrmSG people will think what they think lah. Just enjoy.
758302243720339456 2016-07-27 14:05:18 UTC <icedwater> you think they wouldn't? Unless we're them or a source, we wouldn't know...
758300838750064640 2016-07-27 13:59:43 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo hear hear!
758214080280731649 2016-07-27 08:14:58 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy you might actually need it, I don't know which thermodynamics course it is. Maybe they've simplified some stuff?
758118608845230080 2016-07-26 01:55:36 UTC <icedwater> @skinnylatte nice pun :p
758118250773217280 2016-07-26 01:54:10 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @LividEye or even don't go clubbing in the first place :p
757979929480790016 2016-07-26 16:44:32 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv that's fair. It's your choice.
757979514953609216 2016-07-26 16:42:53 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah Singapore not grey enough yet mah.
757978946088513536 2016-07-26 16:40:37 UTC <icedwater> @wilfredphua @AdamFlinter @commonlynoun I'm not sure I like the idea of paying alnost S$100 for a jersey with a name on it. But others do.
757978343035641856 2016-07-26 16:38:14 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @mrs_wee I think it's something we can avoid becoming. Definitely hope we don't reach Macanese levels of inequality.
757976278209224704 2016-07-26 16:30:01 UTC <icedwater> @kixes isn't it the same sound at the end of "running"?
757975958888386561 2016-07-26 16:28:45 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb want to go KL to watch GST run riot in MYPW?
757975461309784064 2016-07-26 16:26:47 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I'm fine with it for one-to-one conversations but in a group meeting with a non-speaker, please switch to English.
757975013299335170 2016-07-26 16:25:00 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah hahaha actually I don't know what the fuss is about that poster. Not clear that it was public transport, is it?
757974708839067648 2016-07-26 16:23:47 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @frhn even a taxi, I think.. but I have never crunched the numbers.
757974305061736448 2016-07-26 16:22:11 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo if you reduced car ownership the patterns would matter less, right?
757973884331102208 2016-07-26 16:20:31 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo who wan do Singapore version? I cannot rap though lol
757973056203526144 2016-07-26 16:17:13 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay I just feel it would be  a good idea.
757972271671631874 2016-07-26 16:14:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG if they'd tried it before and vouch for it personally, maybe. But I'd just consider either way. Tastes are individual.
757970867364036608 2016-07-26 16:08:31 UTC <icedwater> @DybbukStay I'd like to meet @thetrudz, @jaythenerdkid, and @dybbukstay if I could.https://twitter.com/kuekj/status/757382135770587136
757969822978158592 2016-07-26 16:04:22 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk sorry, I'm not buying the convenient cut. They could have aired the quote if they wanted.
757963231872753671 2016-07-26 15:38:11 UTC <icedwater> @sarabfans the pokemon go theme song!
757955067932585984 2016-07-26 15:05:44 UTC <icedwater> @RealPaigeWWE whut. Suplexes banned... are we going full MMA 
757953885277270017 2016-07-26 15:01:03 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @dcatdemon you would need to be a user in the sudoers file of course, which if you're dealing with your own computer you would be.
757868815334055937 2016-07-26 09:23:00 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy @1KarenWyld something that a certain Trump is aware of.
757637205477117952 2016-07-25 18:02:40 UTC <icedwater> @TelegraphNews @infernoxv @M_S_Fontaine "a.s.o.", "f.e.", "t.i." don't have the same ring to them.
757636672745934851 2016-07-25 18:00:33 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @HandofGOD7 in context, when everything is attributed at first glance to ISIS or radical Islam, I think this distinction is needed.
757631718677291009 2016-07-25 17:40:52 UTC <icedwater> @baroka @thefaloye for some value of "help". I'm started with C/C++, I like Python and JavaScript for immediate feedback. Java's out for me.
757541869442043904 2016-07-25 11:43:50 UTC <icedwater> @pennant83 what you need to do is take us through a week of training with @MightyStags as @hellofrmSG ;)
757449308769652737 2016-07-24 05:36:02 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk @6thofjun that's my point, it wasn't linked to Islam. The others, though, I don't know...
757400067732930560 2016-07-24 02:20:22 UTC <icedwater> @6thofjun I suppose so. It was similar enough for me, anyway.
757388479961505793 2016-07-24 01:34:19 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk @6thofjun I'm not sure what we disagree on here. I never asserted that.
757372473818112000 2016-07-24 00:30:43 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk @6thofjun have you seen evidence, not speculation, that the shooter shouted "Allahu Akbar"?
757372187443466241 2016-07-24 00:29:35 UTC <icedwater> @6thofjun there are several fatwas, but these are issued by imams and religious councils of their own accord. These aren't legally binding.
757265444755480576 2016-07-24 17:25:25 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk @6thofjun I haven't heard proof from the Germans that any trace of religion was invoked here...
757263338761916416 2016-07-24 17:17:03 UTC <icedwater> @gm_oneill sorry, I'm missing how this is supposed to be offensive to Jewish leaders...
757249338867232769 2016-07-24 16:21:26 UTC <icedwater> @pohui @neverknownfacts except that it's true. No matter how many days you live, you still only live once.
757236657691107328 2016-07-24 15:31:02 UTC <icedwater> @JamesDelingpole I see the abuse hasn't been confined to racial differences.
757235429724725252 2016-07-24 15:26:09 UTC <icedwater> @eisen that panel, top right, reminds me of...pic.twitter.com/aXmvxEBptT
757020164483186688 2016-07-23 01:10:46 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo that applies to almost every recommendation in Singapore.. "go bedok 85? set! springleaf? set! adam road? set!"
756756376475447300 2016-07-23 07:42:34 UTC <icedwater> @ShaulaEvans Please read this thread about verification and its risks. Don't chase that blue tick blindly! Thanks @shaulaevans. https://twitter.com/ShaulaEvans/status/755827874590928897
756753834018418688 2016-07-23 07:32:28 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM ugh. Late to reply. Is this the salad thing?
756558035183468544 2016-07-22 18:34:26 UTC <icedwater> @LoveMadness good for you, but I still don't think in the middle of a breaking story is the right time to flood a hashtag with pictures.
756556819762450432 2016-07-22 18:29:36 UTC <icedwater> @LoveMadness the love is appreciated, but the cat pictures can probably wait for another time, maybe after the case is closed...
756551662114791425 2016-07-22 18:09:06 UTC <icedwater> Hope the #OEZ #Schieerei is resolved without much further ado. All the best @PolizeiMuenchen in stopping the killers. RIP poor victims. #fb
756449283620995072 2016-07-22 11:22:18 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG what journal club was this, if I may?
756449157796077568 2016-07-22 11:21:48 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG as it happens I'm only reading this on Friday evening
756294699917258753 2016-07-21 01:08:02 UTC <icedwater> @Lesdoggg @jack @neiljhk @FuckHarambe probably he passes on the hate to others, that's a real sustainable strategy :)
756294320051716097 2016-07-21 01:06:31 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb why do you think year after year Albirex does decently with new university players?
756285177098153986 2016-07-21 00:30:11 UTC <icedwater> @kixes ugh, it could be worse, maybe even up to 212?! https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/21/an-airstrike-in-syria-killed-entire-families-instead-of-isis-fighters/
756163166757728260 2016-07-21 16:25:22 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname well, it was a defeat to be sure. Though surrender can come after a fight, too, I point out. #petulantpedant
756079161538555904 2016-07-21 10:51:34 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz this feels similar to Christian condemnation of Harry Potter way back when, no?
755767872849186816 2016-07-20 14:14:37 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM what's that? Broth made from fish soaked in vodka for two weeks?
755767381750755328 2016-07-20 14:12:39 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas dude. You have to hunt down all the illegal mirrors of your life and either make them stop or make them rsync better.
755766879336083456 2016-07-20 14:10:40 UTC <icedwater> @notblackphilip I like how that's rude and completely irrelevant. What does foreign policy knowledge have to do with gun usage?
755764763234177024 2016-07-20 14:02:15 UTC <icedwater> @ShakespeareSong thou wouldst like to meet? @divroyalty
755760176485937152 2016-07-20 13:44:02 UTC <icedwater> @hwsoh @BruceVH I thought it tended to be the other way around these days...
755758585699676162 2016-07-20 13:37:42 UTC <icedwater> @Toryboy1960 the same person invited you to their conversation:)
755726937503309825 2016-07-20 11:31:57 UTC <icedwater> @robbiewinters @neiljhk @Toryboy1960 also has the right to get upset that you butted in, of course :p
755435371895230464 2016-07-19 16:13:22 UTC <icedwater> @basilyeo @ileksua if so, that's another Mac's that kena tangKAP 
755433189263368194 2016-07-19 16:04:42 UTC <icedwater> me too. But I wind up with too little cash quite often 
755432375807389696 2016-07-19 16:01:28 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @Diane_7A obviously Trump is a Democrat plant trolling the Republicans. 
755428146137014272 2016-07-19 15:44:39 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty you know, you can't teach that...
755427132944158720 2016-07-19 15:40:38 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I remember mine. Hardly anyone I know uses it though...
755426751937781761 2016-07-19 15:39:07 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti oops, is the RNC flooding your timeline?
755401029903015938 2016-07-19 13:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM thanks! To be fair, I came across it while at work and didn't want to search for cached copies and swirl around FB longer :p
755375331544961024 2016-07-19 12:14:47 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM the article was removed :(
755276040906301440 2016-07-18 05:40:15 UTC <icedwater> @NihongoSOS so I feel it's a good time to talk about scheduled tweets...
755259066641883137 2016-07-18 04:32:48 UTC <icedwater> @hodefoting @SwiftOnSecurity edit the link into a Wikipedia page and see if they send Wikipedia the same letter?
755040078561366016 2016-07-18 14:02:37 UTC <icedwater> @WhatTheFFacts I recently heard a gazelle that sounded a lot like her...
755039438787321856 2016-07-18 14:00:04 UTC <icedwater> yeah I read the article afterward. So this would be more like the HK model?
755038904214917120 2016-07-18 13:57:57 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho yeah I forgot they played Albirex again. That's true.
755038153413578752 2016-07-18 13:54:58 UTC <icedwater> wait, isn't private the opposite of govt owned...?
755035864426618880 2016-07-18 13:45:52 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho ah. You mean the loss to Albirex early in the season? Well firstly, it's Albirex. Secondly, I think Home've sorted their defence.
755023349361762308 2016-07-18 12:56:08 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho are you at Bedok now?
754990672323629056 2016-07-18 10:46:17 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk @6thofjun what might that difference be?
754873501194997765 2016-07-17 03:00:42 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk Christian mass murderers may not be murdering in the name of the religion, but that doesn't make them less of either.
754845875898191873 2016-07-17 01:10:55 UTC <icedwater> @avalon pets in the lab rejoice. Maybe some rats will start plotting an escape.
754844740768505856 2016-07-17 01:06:25 UTC <icedwater> @tocsg critical viewpoints are always welcome, but this article struck me as a little strange in parts, e.g. would investors want losses?
754818803679109120 2016-07-17 23:23:21 UTC <icedwater> @asaikana @Mkirka @micrsolo people without a sense of humour, mostly.
754722613524504576 2016-07-17 17:01:07 UTC <icedwater> Ugh. I'm sure if the victims had guns, this could have been avoided. Erm..https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/754707556120027136
754720886662438912 2016-07-17 16:54:16 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity eek. You were in covered shoes at least, I hope? :/
754719004254547970 2016-07-17 16:46:47 UTC <icedwater> @asaikana @Mkirka we Chinese all know kung-fu.
754694681984835585 2016-07-17 15:10:08 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity how come?
754692140412743683 2016-07-17 15:00:02 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv isn't Ebonics the informal name for AAVE? How is it not a creole, or even a pidgin?
754687330133299200 2016-07-17 14:40:55 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv as is Singlish?
754686317246558208 2016-07-17 14:36:54 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv getting all snobbish just because you don't like some parts of others' culture is your choice. Following that culture is others'.
754685827502837761 2016-07-17 14:34:57 UTC <icedwater> maybe people are just rewatching really old Simpsons episodes and trying to invent stuff from there ;)
754685493015490560 2016-07-17 14:33:37 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv yaaaaaaaaassssssss
754682578058092544 2016-07-17 14:22:02 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom @neiljhk must the religion be invoked for caricatures to be valid?
754658704549564416 2016-07-17 12:47:10 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @goddersbloom and yet when Christian mass murderers are characterized as such, no similar comment is made. :)
754486415698767872 2016-07-16 01:22:33 UTC <icedwater> @TrevorIsGood that was a pretty cold play on words.
754344833645318144 2016-07-16 15:59:58 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @RedDot_Oz tys
754292410314690562 2016-07-16 12:31:39 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv lol
754277679507968000 2016-07-16 11:33:07 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv come on, black American cuisine is special too. :P
754277018770956290 2016-07-16 11:30:29 UTC <icedwater> @eisen that depends. I might run out of cookie cutters at some point.
754217744522842112 2016-07-16 07:34:57 UTC <icedwater> @ArunSha98726064 individual destabilizing assaults are the new military conquest?
754216377989279744 2016-07-16 07:29:31 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice hope it ended well for your friend. I saw reports that the attempted coup was foiled, but don't know the damage..
754215001976479745 2016-07-16 07:24:03 UTC <icedwater> @ArunSha98726064 no, they aren't, but the fact that they are also Muslims is surely incidental.
754214815510372356 2016-07-16 07:23:19 UTC <icedwater> @eisen yup I seem to specialise in being irrelevant ;)
754212618315767808 2016-07-16 07:14:35 UTC <icedwater> @ArunSha98726064 that's ridiculous, really. It's regrettable you got some backlash from this, of course, but still.
754209070278594560 2016-07-16 07:00:29 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz Singaporeans are better gamers than Koreans ;)
754208708700147712 2016-07-15 06:59:03 UTC <icedwater> @sonictempest thanks for bringing this up.
754208104355475456 2016-07-15 06:56:39 UTC <icedwater> @hsiao_yun @ashley hmm. Where would the research be made a priority then?
754206939689525248 2016-07-15 06:52:01 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic what specifically do you think is worth learning?
754206500298428416 2016-07-15 06:50:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG they're in good company, many people have done this including a former German minister ;)
754205570354196480 2016-07-15 06:46:35 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG ooh. What does it do?
754205161078202368 2016-07-15 06:44:57 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats @gloveattacker I feel your pain. Comp Sci/Eng people have been getting it for years. Now people have heard of linguistics 
754193852714524673 2016-07-15 06:00:01 UTC <icedwater> @MightyStags @dazhan14 @basilyeo @GaryKLH @sleaguepipebomb I think you got too many words there. "ppl stupid will not pay" is usually enough
754193009982386176 2016-07-15 05:56:40 UTC <icedwater> @mrs_wee that's true too. @kiampah
754192899718262784 2016-07-15 05:56:14 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah sad truth. We'll need to change it...
754147039089340416 2016-07-15 02:54:00 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @LTAsg "cautious". We've seen how a central ownership of shared facilities has really helped Singapore football blossom..
753974859860811777 2016-07-15 15:29:49 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch vielleicht Tagalog
753974504125108224 2016-07-15 15:28:24 UTC <icedwater> @astar_research @ashleydfarley hmm, scientists still need to pay for the privilege of sharing their research in journals or at conferences.
753973569059631105 2016-07-15 15:24:41 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @Holbornlolz I hope you will be proven wrong, but in this day and age...
753970996902699009 2016-07-15 15:14:28 UTC <icedwater> @eisen let's make CCU Class of '16 T-shirts. On bo?!

753876013755412480 2016-07-15 08:57:02 UTC <icedwater> @StirringTrouble @neiljhk did we establish your knowledge in the area, though?
753837936395694081 2016-07-14 06:25:44 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @StirringTrouble also known as accepting refugees and being humane?
753837688919199744 2016-07-14 06:24:45 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun hmm is it original source? I... don't really like it. It reminds me somehow of visits to the doctor.

753552737225232384 2016-07-14 11:32:27 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay obviously yes.
753464945438707712 2016-07-13 05:43:36 UTC <icedwater> @baroka @smiffy we use revert when we mean reply. I'm wondering if it's some archaic usage that the British left behind.
753410158689083392 2016-07-13 02:05:54 UTC <icedwater> @baroka oh, it's not unique to Singapore? Hmm.
753407277915176963 2016-07-13 01:54:27 UTC <icedwater> @stefanjdecker I'm convinced Theresa May is an excellent troll. First Boris Johnson, now this.
753405585664552960 2016-07-13 01:47:43 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify does "unconditional" mean "regardless of what #BoJo does as foreign affairs minister"? #BerlinTime

753034447348375552 2016-07-12 01:12:57 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren United dollars cannot be used on Delta or JetBlue... confirm SQ cannot also.
753026210309865473 2016-07-12 00:40:13 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter this is reprehensible behaviour from an online mob, no less. Again, people who don't dare to do this in real life... #sigh
753025916050083840 2016-07-12 00:39:03 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter also, this separation between Internet and real life bothers me. That's really so last generation.
753025209175683072 2016-07-12 00:36:15 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 what better time to blood the next generation in? ;)
753019059617181697 2016-07-12 00:11:48 UTC <icedwater> OK, so... about our Opposition...https://twitter.com/PeoplesPowerSG/status/752766691315159040
752924993814532096 2016-07-12 17:58:01 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren yup that's more important because people like to use big words without being sure what they mean...
752832152077676544 2016-07-12 11:49:06 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen see you around online next time perhaps!
752808848302366720 2016-07-12 10:16:30 UTC <icedwater> @tzudohnymh @Oddly_Normal "huh?"
752716255564484609 2016-07-11 04:08:34 UTC <icedwater> @kixes @jnaina I think http://data.gov.sg is improving, but only now. Accessible data also has to be timely and usable.
752713788042776577 2016-07-11 03:58:46 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo be a little wild. Use Linux ;)
752711070091845632 2016-07-11 03:47:58 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho @wilw ugh. The case would have happened with or without gun control though, so #FucktheNRA isn't that appropriate here.
752669196316610561 2016-07-11 01:01:34 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify Go go Berlin PhD! ;)
752549808326340608 2016-07-11 17:07:10 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @dcatdemon OK considerately I agree. #driftlife
752549515018719232 2016-07-11 17:06:00 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo too bad! Weekdays are enough of a hurry. I'm #driftlife
752517286112538624 2016-07-11 14:57:56 UTC <icedwater> @Steelinho that should be the way, except this ought to have been for WCQ or ACQ rather than AFF...
752360925152194560 2016-07-10 04:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @ketsugi @cheeaun @agrahul or hack some pronunciations out with Webspeech API. "Tay o seeyou d'ai"
752358857788170240 2016-07-10 04:28:24 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter it gave us the Iceland dream and the eventual winner was a third-placed team, though. Good for stories, if not football.
752185873769213952 2016-07-10 17:01:01 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 how it works is you pass a lot of gas, so your friends stop inviting you out for beers. You cry and starve. #sideeffects
752128244506169344 2016-07-10 13:12:02 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv oh, I was talking about hawker centres and food courts...
752075206781333504 2016-07-10 09:41:16 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I mean, UK elects the government which then selects the PM. How is that different from other EU governments selecting their rep?
752074526200983552 2016-07-10 09:38:34 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG well, if you want Pokemon, go!
752073744579911680 2016-07-10 09:35:28 UTC <icedwater> @eisen would probably break the news, that.
752073444120858625 2016-07-10 09:34:16 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo mm.
752071387955630080 2016-07-10 09:26:06 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity only with 1.103.0 I believe :)
752070890276294656 2016-07-10 09:24:07 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua eh how was Punk's debut?
752070335525105664 2016-07-10 09:21:55 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity ikr I wonder what prompted @ingress to add that warning.
752070221595156480 2016-07-10 09:21:28 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I hope I haven't done that to you! I know some who are like that...
752069528025051136 2016-07-10 09:18:42 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv on the other hand, nothing is stopping you from pouring your perfectly halal nasi lemak onto a plate with pork on it if you must.
752056909880893440 2016-07-10 08:28:34 UTC <icedwater> @eisen @ianbremmer I thought that was more #BoJo though.
752011079228600320 2016-07-09 05:26:27 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz that seven-year-old is really precocious
751999894970200064 2016-07-09 04:42:01 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I think for Singapore it's both though:p
751996139432349696 2016-07-09 04:27:05 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats @singnoname oops yeah true... lol
751991637937573888 2016-07-09 04:09:12 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @infernoxv this is also true, I just wasn't sure that nasi lemak predates Islam.
751990582847770624 2016-07-09 04:05:00 UTC <icedwater> @Sobban phew, what a relief.
751989307154370561 2016-07-09 03:59:56 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @shimmertje8 that's the question :) I think as long as we recognize nasi lemak was not designed with pork in mind it's enough?
751988938034733056 2016-07-09 03:58:28 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats it's a temple, a palace () on earth for the heavenly empress (),  from right to left. Singapore's is Thiam Hock Keng.
751983432557662208 2016-07-09 03:36:36 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv ... ditto for whatever reason pizza being commonly sold as a halal dish. So it isn't really privilege per se but business sense?
751982810571747328 2016-07-09 03:34:07 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv well, I suppose if a large population which enjoys nasi lemak also enjoys pork, nasi lemak with pork might become more common...
751981849568681984 2016-07-09 03:30:18 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law just one question: what are the gun death rates by state with respect to strictness of gun control laws?
751981527727239169 2016-07-09 03:29:02 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I don't think they are comparable, though.
751969842958217216 2016-07-09 02:42:36 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz until you have to deal with Singaporean drivers ;)
751969518407196672 2016-07-09 02:41:18 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv pizza is not a traditionally halal dish though, so it's quite a different argument...
751954577541337088 2016-07-09 01:41:56 UTC <icedwater> I'm mildly amused that #Brexit pulled UK away from "unelected" EU officials, only to possibly replace their own PM with an "unelected" one.
751948585910972416 2016-07-09 01:18:08 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law how many assault rifle murders take place in CA?
751948514121297920 2016-07-09 01:17:50 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law laws are step one. Enforcement is key. Start with weapons only for "self-defense", then work on making crime less frequent.
751941017612406784 2016-07-09 00:48:03 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law yes, but limiting access to assault rifles means I'd have to stuff my pockets with magazines and find time to reload to kill 49.
751820773115912196 2016-07-09 16:50:15 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch I can't get the expected response myself. Graaaagh
751752207754670080 2016-07-09 12:17:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG enjoy!
751721727298711552 2016-07-09 10:16:40 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law I didn't know those involved rice cookers. Why are you bringing another weapon into a gun control discussion?
751607989585326080 2016-07-08 02:44:43 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv because two wrongs always made a right :p
751586828780613632 2016-07-08 01:20:38 UTC <icedwater> @jensen4law I find it difficult to even consider killing 49 people in a night club with a rice cooker, unless they use poison too...
751586067661238273 2016-07-08 01:17:36 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH this was just one week after Singapore held them to a 0-0 draw at half-time to "close" Old Kallang...
751460073436684289 2016-07-08 16:56:57 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz if they say it it's OK. Something to do with reclaiming the term or irony or both, depending on context?
751458841582120960 2016-07-08 16:52:03 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale how are we more targeted than before?
751377172003229698 2016-07-08 11:27:32 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay yes but this is a separate point. @kixes should not have been suspended by FB.
751271119643041792 2016-07-07 04:26:07 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname looks like they have had enough of experts after all...
751223797252927488 2016-07-07 01:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @Raiyanskop but sir, if you transfer us $20 at this Paypal account you will receive your DHL package within the next 48 hours!
751213549280636928 2016-07-07 00:37:21 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill yes, but how is that disillusionment? With their current government, you mean? I think you might be reading a bit too deep.
751210610373701632 2016-07-07 00:25:40 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @AdamFlinter 15 officers in "five or six" police cars :p
751209913624326144 2016-07-07 00:22:54 UTC <icedwater> @avarenity I guess it will pull the cheats away from Ingress for a bit...
751208422998106112 2016-07-07 00:16:59 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz don't insult the mentally handicapped...
751093328758788096 2016-07-07 16:39:38 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen welcome back, I think. Take care.
751091039062986754 2016-07-07 16:30:32 UTC <icedwater> @jeffmcneill wait, least disillusioned? Please enlighten me...
751020981842575360 2016-07-07 11:52:10 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv lol. Same one as always? You seem to be saddled with many of these...
750976280871391232 2016-07-07 08:54:32 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv also, Bata is a Czech brand, not a Malaysian one...
750843628369489920 2016-07-06 00:07:25 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish So, to search for questions about some topic and compile them into 1 page? Different worksheets for students by ability?
750842839383236609 2016-07-06 00:04:17 UTC <icedwater> @tzudohnymh if that's what you would like to think, I'm afraid I cannot agree.
750723230281797632 2016-07-06 16:09:00 UTC <icedwater> @tzudohnymh "information should be free" doesn't sound like she was being narcissistic.
750722410865790976 2016-07-06 16:05:45 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish something like a mail merge? You'll have to give me more details...
750719373568937984 2016-07-06 15:53:41 UTC <icedwater> @tzudohnymh she is a people's hero who chose the greater good over some endangered lives and paid with her freedom.
750719186356178944 2016-07-06 15:52:56 UTC <icedwater> @hersecretslave no, I do indeed mean "her".
750718797539995648 2016-07-06 15:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish why leh
750717380062359552 2016-07-06 15:45:45 UTC <icedwater> @tzudohnymh don't be rude. She is way stronger than you can ever hope to be.
750716997764210689 2016-07-06 15:44:14 UTC <icedwater> @hersecretslave a little bit less shitty than you are being to her, maybe.
750716648122834945 2016-07-06 15:42:51 UTC <icedwater> Fingers crossed @xychelsea makes it back alive. If only I could give back some of the hope you gave us. https://twitter.com/evacide/status/750697111486754820
750517803925401601 2016-07-05 02:32:43 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG hope you had a good session out there! I was too lazy to join you folks this time.
750350426839486469 2016-07-05 15:27:37 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose @thenausner that's the party representing the 1.8%. Of Bundestag seats, last I checked. I don't expect it's much higher now.
750330463865057282 2016-07-05 14:08:17 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya does anyone take these things seriously until they actually happen?
750244271106600960 2016-07-05 08:25:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG it's OK, just two weeks ago it might have happened too (eh @avarenity?) :P
750243222794805248 2016-07-05 08:21:37 UTC <icedwater> @avalon why not on the rocks :p
750242327130615808 2016-07-05 08:18:04 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom next year, you mean, unless you're still in the past...
750140301713432576 2016-07-04 01:32:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG what about tomorrow, in that case?
750138988200013825 2016-07-04 01:27:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG is the NEA tide table reliable then? It still seems to have an awfully high/early low tide.
750135520945016832 2016-07-04 01:13:39 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas @madmanweb also see AngaarTV :) https://youtu.be/5VsBvyPvqSE
750123531430531073 2016-07-04 00:26:01 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom that's always possible but it'd frankly be quite a leap of the imagination.
749995838202531840 2016-07-04 15:58:36 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti have a safe trip to wherever, and enjoy your break :)
749987994715643904 2016-07-04 15:27:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I, too, have memories of my visit ten years ago... I wonder where that Singapore's gone now! 
749980396939423745 2016-07-04 14:57:15 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I know someone who went voting once. Suddenly the lights all turned off! Then on again!!
749978626037125122 2016-07-04 14:50:13 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish so cuuuuute
749908630120521728 2016-07-04 10:12:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG #thingsyourarelysayinreallife
749908366814654464 2016-07-04 10:11:01 UTC <icedwater> @goddersbloom you may not have, but the actions of the past week against Polish immigrants were surely not fabrications... @neiljhk
749908084563128321 2016-07-04 10:09:54 UTC <icedwater> @SShorland ever wonder why most of the world speaks English now?
749770280856281088 2016-07-03 01:02:19 UTC <icedwater> @philshapiro @downey ah. Sigh. That's heartening on the one hand (cf. Singapore sports) but millions is indeed excessive.
749766036539396096 2016-07-03 00:45:27 UTC <icedwater> @downey @philshapiro do the cities really spend millions, or is it indiscriminate spending by the sports clubs?
749763210673131520 2016-07-03 00:34:14 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch maybe next time can try "sollte ich dort dann wie Ihnen schlafen?" Lol. #espritdescalier
749675316918956032 2016-07-03 18:44:58 UTC <icedwater> @jesslynnrose don't forget your daily blessings :)
749671891506376705 2016-07-03 18:31:21 UTC <icedwater> @daoyang nice photo, but at some point the -fie suffix has to break down lol
749447361777197057 2016-07-02 03:39:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG which timezone are you in? :p #stillinbedgang
749445688514125824 2016-07-02 03:32:30 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue @interchris lolwut.
749442969820770304 2016-07-02 03:21:42 UTC <icedwater> @smashalidis no, I am saying it would have offended Hillary supporters as well without triggering Jews as much.
749440904981716994 2016-07-02 03:13:30 UTC <icedwater> @smashalidis I would not really call it reasonable doubt. They could have gone with the circle from the start and still been offensive.
749439659185352704 2016-07-02 03:08:33 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld all the best with your spinning plates! Hope you have people around you who can fix the smashed ones.
749438044642562048 2016-07-02 03:02:08 UTC <icedwater> @LittleNonsuch for now, I suppose. If Tesla had had the funding to pilot this to the average man...
749437393984368640 2016-07-02 02:59:33 UTC <icedwater> @avalon which provider does that? Used to have to deal with it in Germany, but I didn't know it was here too. Theoretically unlimited data.
749436583204360192 2016-07-02 02:56:19 UTC <icedwater> @talk2meradiouk sounds interesting. I hope it's not just a thinly-veiled excuse for being assholes on air.
749434979457699841 2016-07-02 02:49:57 UTC <icedwater> @smashalidis speaking of context, I think these were filled hexagrams. Please stop trying to justify absurdity.pic.twitter.com/BtcVc4fZWq
749433254118248449 2016-07-02 02:43:06 UTC <icedwater> @smashalidis indeed, context is important. Nobody has stuck that logo next to a picture of a political figure yet.
749371402369638400 2016-07-02 22:37:19 UTC <icedwater> @smashalidis the swastika, reflected, also has a different meaning in Buddhism. Yet you don't see that being used anywhere.
749194327671222272 2016-07-02 10:53:41 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling except it involves Miz getting near the world title again. Ugh. I also hope they're not thinking of unifying the belts!
749192857659944962 2016-07-02 10:47:51 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho @singnoname come come try Linux :p
749124786953957376 2016-07-01 06:17:21 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @YZD24 @yazbanz I believe in that coach. I don't think he would have said what he did without good reason.
749065334473183233 2016-07-01 02:21:07 UTC <icedwater> @fariskassim @ballsdotie which means, of course, that Portugal will win 1-0 from a 2nd-minute deflection that beats Hennessey.
749064372513755137 2016-07-01 02:17:18 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo teehee
748913007648919552 2016-07-01 16:15:49 UTC <icedwater> I'd like to see a Muslim protagonist pray for a good outcome in a Hollywood movie. Just once. Would be yuge for social media 
748912268901879808 2016-07-01 16:12:53 UTC <icedwater> @PeoplesPowerSG thanks for the long article, Nazryn, but I'd like to fix a few things in the grammar that popped out while I was skimming.
748902725291692032 2016-07-01 15:34:58 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz why did you steal two sides of my McDonald's breakfast?! #eggmuffin
748899101819842562 2016-07-01 15:20:34 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako @GeniusFootball still less than Rooney, if I recall correctly...
748885068441989120 2016-07-01 14:24:48 UTC <icedwater> @NEUtdFC @NEUFCFans beware! At this rate it's 1 more season before @nico_velez34 leaves @neutdfc and comes back to the #SLeague with @WarriorsSAF ;)
748811375028285440 2016-07-01 09:31:58 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @eisen oi. #CheckYourPrivilege.
748811155137654784 2016-07-01 09:31:06 UTC <icedwater> Unfortunately this was the last of this #seriouslyscience season, but there'll be more in a festival this August... http://www.onenorthfestival.sg
748803362213113856 2016-07-01 09:00:08 UTC <icedwater> Thanks Dr. Sandhya Sriram from @astar_research and @biotechinasia for "Can an orange a day keep the doctor away?" #seriouslyscience #fb
748565497092857856 2016-06-30 17:14:56 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas @nirbheek @meson10 it is very scalable, actually. It's the new trend, inward scaling. Saves resources too.
748529262458605568 2016-06-30 14:50:57 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz which SLeague team is shorter? Hmm
748529181512732672 2016-06-30 14:50:38 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale that means we need 1600 professionals leh.
748472029624434689 2016-06-30 11:03:32 UTC <icedwater> @teenicholas how would you have improved on it? The backroom drama can not be easily condensed into this format, nor keep the hopeful tone.
748471153916678145 2016-06-30 11:00:03 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I know now how to address you if I require your services in future ;)
748195375161323520 2016-06-29 16:44:12 UTC <icedwater> @avalon #hugs
748194925074751490 2016-06-29 16:42:25 UTC <icedwater> @shujiokishima @yazbanz wah Germany dunno how to choose jersey leh
748194591724048384 2016-06-29 16:41:06 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling whoever has a fever, I reckon.
748194243206733824 2016-06-29 16:39:43 UTC <icedwater> seywhut
748193358560952320 2016-06-29 16:36:12 UTC <icedwater> @marcoagutier @AdamFlinter thanks!
748177855666741250 2016-06-29 15:34:35 UTC <icedwater> @marcoagutier gotta go find this. Just because. @AdamFlinter where is it?https://twitter.com/AdamFlinter/status/748117567126966272
748176563368165376 2016-06-29 15:29:27 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen or trolling. I bit because bored.
748176395516284930 2016-06-29 15:28:47 UTC <icedwater> @TheFerfles maybe because there are 335 other days "for" straight people?
748176097431302146 2016-06-29 15:27:36 UTC <icedwater> @pplofwrestling I'd rather the feud, then... @DCMatthewsNAI
748099362597703680 2016-06-29 10:22:41 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @whyvo looks good. Surely got things everyone can learn
748099010825592832 2016-06-29 10:21:17 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale we also have what. Espzen alone should be more than that.
748078242402271232 2016-06-29 08:58:46 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay based on the exit polls Britain is kind of done for though
748024414218887169 2016-06-28 05:24:52 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay #opensource
747947973305262080 2016-06-28 00:21:07 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz no wonder he wanted to retire heh
747832146358853632 2016-06-28 16:40:52 UTC <icedwater> @FirEicia lol. Set up like Italy, concede early like Iceland, lose with same scoreline as Spain. Really Euro-inspired :p
747782532247126016 2016-06-28 13:23:43 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin sorry need to specify #faswpl2016 I ne
747782405512007681 2016-06-28 13:23:13 UTC <icedwater> @andreiarshabin you know H-Two-O Dream Team? Centreback no. 1, keeper I think no. 13 
747774332445679616 2016-06-28 12:51:08 UTC <icedwater> @gifcsg is it inspired by Italy? :) Full marks for defying the national syllabus!  #geylangboleh
747773306476986368 2016-06-28 12:47:03 UTC <icedwater> @viewsfromme in any other case I would agree. But for @Nigel_Farage...
747772691856297989 2016-06-28 12:44:37 UTC <icedwater> it probably was applied to a live chicken before they took the photo.
747771326031499264 2016-06-28 12:39:11 UTC <icedwater> Sorry, but @SgProWrestling Alexis is gonna put a Lyd on @MYProWrestling. #WRESTLINGCITYASIA
747770557400133632 2016-06-28 12:36:08 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz as long as the ideas and not the people are attacked, that's safe enough for most; however, even this can not be guaranteed.
747770186816622593 2016-06-28 12:34:40 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo delete that LinkedIn account. Another step towards retirement
747769689602875393 2016-06-28 12:32:41 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv lol.
747680431898791936 2016-06-27 06:38:00 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen @AdamFlinter my score in the last probably cancels out my negatives for the first three... but then I don't drive a taxi :p
747661518225940481 2016-06-27 05:22:51 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname but he is, when he taps the mic @iamthekai flips sideways...
747626123245170688 2016-06-27 03:02:12 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo 
747622034260135936 2016-06-27 02:45:57 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo 
747621865275809792 2016-06-27 02:45:17 UTC <icedwater> @RussellMaJimmie just because you've never seen it in your life doesn't mean it's made up... I hope you're not religious:)
747600517849767936 2016-06-27 01:20:27 UTC <icedwater> @RussellMaJimmie I would be careful when making that second assertion.
747596624990347265 2016-06-27 01:04:59 UTC <icedwater> @RussellMaJimmie the difference is that Twitter wasn't around back then and they didn't know about the crimes...
747491131823259649 2016-06-27 18:05:48 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz goreng pisang or pisang goreng?
747476678499151873 2016-06-27 17:08:22 UTC <icedwater> @spiritz I always just use a bookmark to davidshims' codepen, http://codepen.io/davidshimjs/pen/rJgjv, but onelink.to seems like a better idea.
747351641507041280 2016-06-27 08:51:31 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo so that averages out to 1km a day for a fortnight or less than 500m for a month, right? :P
747287658829778945 2016-06-26 04:37:16 UTC <icedwater> @cheeaun cool! Now will people buy domain names spelled out with emoji...
747237441375875072 2016-06-26 01:17:43 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch at least it's not a long commute;)
747088058919464961 2016-06-26 15:24:08 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue they're so good they bent logic for you :p
747082505577070593 2016-06-26 15:02:04 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @born_in_august_ it's good to be able to find the positives now, but it must have been terrible living through it.
747070091200630785 2016-06-26 14:12:44 UTC <icedwater> lol. Where got. We don't flip the whole plate to cover it one lor.
747061298475610112 2016-06-26 13:37:47 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo what about yours?
747061199217426433 2016-06-26 13:37:24 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo not at all. Maybe casual racism? I wasn't around many foreigners at the time I suppose. There's always been Malaysia bashing though.
747019836622921729 2016-06-26 10:53:02 UTC <icedwater> @BurgerKiang @hellofrmSG @singnoname if they are apartments under three years old they might be infested by yau gwee.
747016938421837824 2016-06-26 10:41:31 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas tmux?
747016727163133952 2016-06-26 10:40:41 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @born_in_august_ sorry you had to go through that. Thanks for helping us lift the veil.
747016580454711296 2016-06-26 10:40:06 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo probably this.
747016071803109376 2016-06-26 10:38:05 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale mud baths can be quite glorious.
746932733901836288 2016-06-25 05:06:55 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish it reveals problems so that we can deal with them :) Singapore's own racism is still hiding under a shiny veneer of wealth.
746908176499412992 2016-06-25 03:29:20 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG that was a bit of a cockle-up...
746895240229855232 2016-06-25 02:37:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG dammit. Clan* sneaky dictionary.
746894532030013448 2016-06-25 02:35:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG feeling young at a clam association brunch party. A little bit of heritage on the weekend.pic.twitter.com/n9x7gfVLlS
746866566877184000 2016-06-25 00:44:00 UTC <icedwater> @MUISingapore @spiritz @govsingapore I am assuming yes, or all Muslims working in kitchens would have to take a month of night shifts...
746853830042619905 2016-06-25 23:53:23 UTC <icedwater> @SaraBareilles sorry I missed the tweet, what was it about? It seems to have been deleted...
746852099497951232 2016-06-25 23:46:31 UTC <icedwater> @NomarClintons stay classy :)
746850457125949440 2016-06-25 23:39:59 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz anything is possible if you just have 52%...
746849936247926784 2016-06-25 23:37:55 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic did I miss a public response somewhere...
746725070811201536 2016-06-25 15:21:45 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez Arion FA can just rename to Kena Tiang FC. Could have wrapped up the game 5-0... almost 1-1...
746724674613084160 2016-06-25 15:20:10 UTC <icedwater> @iainmartin1 except apparently @Nigel_Farage himself wanted a revote if Remain didn't have a clear win...
746702866862071808 2016-06-25 13:53:31 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez I was asking the same of Arion just now.
746702687199072256 2016-06-25 13:52:48 UTC <icedwater> It ends 1-0. HTwoO almost levelled the scores hitting the crossbar on 75', but would have lost a crossbar challenge 4-1. #faswpl2016 #AFAH2O
746701856877879296 2016-06-25 13:49:30 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @hellofrmSG I've been a few times, I meant in the context of eating at Fish & Co before it closes.
746686951185518593 2016-06-25 12:50:16 UTC <icedwater> Second half to start here at Queenstown in a few minutes. Arion leads HTwoO Dream team 1-0. #faswpl2016 #AFAH2O
746686566429405184 2016-06-25 12:48:44 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @kuekj ugh and I still haven't been to Glass House!
746686191148236802 2016-06-25 12:47:15 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I enjoyed what I saw of it! Don't be sad, the first curation is always tough :p
746551426667601921 2016-06-24 03:51:45 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz who is Nazrul Nawaz?
746549920195174400 2016-06-24 03:45:45 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya @shadihamid what would you have him do, then?
746549177786609664 2016-06-24 03:42:48 UTC <icedwater> @researcher00000 lol
746517194289217545 2016-06-24 01:35:43 UTC <icedwater> @JeeSayTan hope wins over fear? Let's see what happens in the next few months...
746516171935997953 2016-06-24 01:31:39 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh ooh OK! Hi @kittensarepink hope you're doing fine too. SPW is @SgProWrestling :)
746375222417199108 2016-06-24 16:11:34 UTC <icedwater> @benjapoh shall we have a tweetup July 15 at the next SPW event?
746372781277741056 2016-06-24 16:01:52 UTC <icedwater> @LotharHS ugh took me too long, well played. @ClandestineYeo thanks for RTing 
746325088388026368 2016-06-24 12:52:21 UTC <icedwater> Via @hai_ren. Please be careful, @aisyahgala!https://twitter.com/cracked/status/746302365322489858
746287451245686785 2016-06-24 10:22:48 UTC <icedwater> @sillynotabsurd if it were a responsible informed vote, sure... and the best part is the actual #Brexit hasn't happened yet.
746286949720170496 2016-06-24 10:20:48 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess why else would one apply?
746267595859361792 2016-06-24 09:03:54 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter I would be happy with Colonel Sanders...
746267461234790400 2016-06-24 09:03:22 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz lol. Now it's LKY who decided to vote out of Malaysia huh. #sigh
746267185471881217 2016-06-24 09:02:16 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz because if they had "real" titles offline they wouldn't have to be activists, would they...
746266873843449858 2016-06-24 09:01:02 UTC <icedwater> @pennant83 did Russia vote to merge with Japan?! 
746266613247254529 2016-06-24 09:00:00 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter I suppose, but President Trump is less than six months away...
746263661199556609 2016-06-24 08:48:16 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I'm not disagreeing, I just didn't have anything I necessarily want to say at the time.
746256877701341184 2016-06-24 08:21:19 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti it depends on the actual action. I know there can be some action taken, but not all tweeting on #Brexit is useful.
746254881514610688 2016-06-24 08:13:23 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti it does, but I've said my piece. What is my complaining going to solve now? What concrete action can we take?
746237557168443392 2016-06-24 07:04:32 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 on the plus side, Rooney is now a lot more affordable for an #sleague club...
746236099605913600 2016-06-23 06:58:45 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti it is important, but why should I add to the spam?
746206815495413761 2016-06-23 05:02:23 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah most likely not. I think they're a lot more sophisticated than that, maybe they will just form a new GB and leave England alone. :P
746197451388837894 2016-06-23 04:25:10 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah they probably would have stayed in the EU though, but it does look a little counter-intuitive. I don't know..
746196585978048512 2016-06-23 04:21:44 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti that too, I thought you were anticipating some kind of ridiculous regulation.
746196214589251586 2016-06-23 04:20:15 UTC <icedwater> @DMC1982Nice @bargeboards which is why he wants to make it "as hard" for everyone else to get what he's already got?
746195263329472513 2016-06-23 04:16:29 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti just curious - what are your reasons for considering closing?
745985663007236096 2016-06-23 14:23:36 UTC <icedwater> @pratley_adam @eisen we had unelected and unaccountable Britons making our decisions for us for decades and turned out fine...
745801470872739840 2016-06-22 02:11:41 UTC <icedwater> @Brian_Casserly being neutral doesn't preclude me from expressing disbelief at a seemingly irrational statement. I'm reading, don't worry.
745799010552713216 2016-06-22 02:01:55 UTC <icedwater> @Brian_Casserly I'm not qualified to debate this yet. But text is one thing, interpretation is another very important point.
745792244175626241 2016-06-22 01:35:01 UTC <icedwater> Welp, completely forgot @pyconsg was on. I'll just have to hope for some good streams.
745791944882688000 2016-06-22 01:33:50 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren @coderkungfu oh it's at Biopolis this time?
745789779644555266 2016-06-22 01:25:14 UTC <icedwater> @Brian_Casserly would you read the bible as literally?
745760781505953792 2016-06-22 23:30:00 UTC <icedwater> @Brian_Casserly surely you can't be serious.
745756009713438721 2016-06-22 23:11:02 UTC <icedwater> @huinandez what happened?
745649970045292545 2016-06-22 16:09:41 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen @smiffy I agree in principle. Except I used a social login for Stackoverflow. Sometimes laziness wins.
745649077283495936 2016-06-22 16:06:08 UTC <icedwater> @agrahul you're close to a regular terrorbyte.
745646141404917761 2016-06-22 15:54:28 UTC <icedwater> @avalon ah. OK. Thank goodness. Have a good few hours of sleep please :)
745626855969951744 2016-06-22 14:37:50 UTC <icedwater> @eisen it's a good thing they're mostly already underground then!
745626410627145728 2016-06-22 14:36:04 UTC <icedwater> @avalon discharged today?!
745293115590729728 2016-06-21 16:31:40 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA I don't understand people calling teams without the ball 'defensive' ... as though they're supposed to let opponents run free.
745284515409498112 2016-06-21 15:57:29 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH any field on which an international has been allowed to take place is at international standards. :p
745283981705306112 2016-06-21 15:55:22 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname lol. Ownself complain ownself.
745283049131171841 2016-06-21 15:51:40 UTC <icedwater> @the_anke scheinbar gibt's ja so was. @TheBrownswood hat geantwortet. Alles Gute und viel Spa! Forza Alemania! :P
745263364297809920 2016-06-21 14:33:27 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk I've done so several times.
745259952868986880 2016-06-21 14:19:53 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @DVATW no such arrests would occur if Britain left the EU????
745259808157143045 2016-06-21 14:19:19 UTC <icedwater> Ugh, removed the tweet which I meant to reply to. It was about Europe's economy growing slowest among continents being a reason to #Brexit.
745258881308196869 2016-06-21 14:15:38 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv that's a fair judgment based on what you've had to go on, I suppose. Haven't spoken to too many myself but that's my own fault.
745258127679848451 2016-06-21 14:12:38 UTC <icedwater> I wonder what's behind the higher growth rates everywhere else. Might it be that there are more countries there?
745256839235829760 2016-06-21 14:07:31 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv sorry, "you may have had" should have been "you've had"

745255983669096448 2016-06-21 14:04:07 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv by and large, they may not have had the classical training you may have had, but that doesn't make them any less intelligent.
745238562107383808 2016-06-21 12:54:53 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @ladystormhold that's true. I may have done that in the past. But I really can't do group tours anymore, I need space and no rush.
745236881529442305 2016-06-21 12:48:13 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I'm surprised you think your opinion on a footballer's opinion is of any importance :p are they incapable of nuanced insight?
745236436857716736 2016-06-21 12:46:27 UTC <icedwater> @avalon hope at least the med student appreciated your defence...

745029257412239361 2016-06-20 23:03:11 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah oops. Just realised I'd asked this before :p
745029050603704320 2016-06-20 23:02:22 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah by the way, are you going on to the next course for data structures?
745024389255598080 2016-06-20 22:43:50 UTC <icedwater> @SmithsonianMag that wasn't the best headline... "Longer mid-day naps could be a sign of bad health" is clearer.

744231980703719425 2016-06-18 18:15:06 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang hmm. #AUT I think? Now Portugal has 1 point, Austria 0; it needs to be a 0-0 draw tomorrow for #ISL to end this round 2nd.
744169632974671872 2016-06-18 14:07:21 UTC <icedwater> At this rate, AOS will have to stand for Albirex-Only Scorelines. #ALBHOM #sleague #fb
744169352669200384 2016-06-18 14:06:14 UTC <icedwater> It ends Albirex 5, Home United 2. A Ken Ils penalty and a Khairul Nizam flick cut the deficit to one, but to no avail. #ALBHOM #sleague #fb

743259665287380992 2016-06-15 01:51:27 UTC <icedwater> @RationalWiki @CuresCancer lol. OK. Never mind that the incidence of murder with guns is much lower when there are no guns :)
743258550734991360 2016-06-15 01:47:02 UTC <icedwater> Hahaha this thread. Sorry most women have to deal with this crap,  @ohnoNOTFEMINISM.https://twitter.com/ohnoNOTFEMINISM/status/742798619368169472

743223614393094144 2016-06-15 23:28:12 UTC <icedwater> @RationalWiki @CuresCancer when, again? The fewer people have a gun, the fewer such cases at all. Whoever heard of a mass stabbing?
743089164963348480 2016-06-15 14:33:57 UTC <icedwater> @Mparader sir, it wasn't "purportedly targeted at the LGBT community". When a mass shooting takes place in a gay club, the targets are LGBT.
742948084079022081 2016-06-14 05:13:21 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus lol also can.
742946385029398528 2016-06-14 05:06:36 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus did you report and block the SG number already? The Indian number doesn't matter, they're probably just contracted to send spam.

742923946740191232 2016-06-14 03:37:26 UTC <icedwater> @RationalWiki @CuresCancer so the casualty rate would have been lower if everyone had just started shooting in self-defense instead.
742916007954550785 2016-06-14 03:05:53 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah such as civilserpentspeak. "synergize" and "catalyze" and "servitization"... gah.

740166450581639168 2016-06-07 13:00:08 UTC <icedwater> @towertransitSG @hellofrmSG was this a @towertransitsg decision, or did @SBS_Transit decide to drop your bus information off-screen?pic.twitter.com/xd8DlUSTA3
740139585858981892 2016-06-07 11:13:23 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah the rain of falling blossoms makes it far more bearable #feihua
740095489589149696 2016-06-07 08:18:09 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo wah.
740061784451649536 2016-06-06 06:04:13 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren @edyong209 ugh
739847464660832256 2016-06-06 15:52:35 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @singnoname I was going to correct it, but why not both? :p
739836377596973056 2016-06-06 15:08:32 UTC <icedwater> if can find more is good. I'm checking interest now, also pulling some more in lol
739835282325790721 2016-06-06 15:04:11 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale eh. Don't even think we've reached the age of intellect yet. and why should we use the strength of religion to measure anything?
739831667968200704 2016-06-06 14:49:49 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish are you using M1? The data passport seems like a fuss-free idea. But I was there for four days across months; super bo hua.
739830995927502850 2016-06-06 14:47:09 UTC <icedwater> and Sat completely sold out haha. Gotta hurry.
739830519911710721 2016-06-06 14:45:15 UTC <icedwater> Friday. 8pm. But group of 6 sold out for Friday already.
739830217728876544 2016-06-06 14:44:03 UTC <icedwater> @yokey017 @kiampah @ladystormhold @joleeqh yeah.. they haven't got past the semifinals of either Euro or World Cup otherwise.
739827520850137090 2016-06-06 14:33:20 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi anyone you know can join us for escape game? I am trying to get a second team, got 1.5 so far...
739800284692516864 2016-06-06 12:45:07 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @MrTCHarris hmm. That is an interesting point.
739795039597912065 2016-06-06 12:24:16 UTC <icedwater> @thehuntinground @mldauber at that rate, 50-year-old mass murderers should probably go free as long as they spent under a minute killing.
739793620698468352 2016-06-06 12:18:38 UTC <icedwater> @aisyahgala time for a tweetup perhaps? :D
739793242305105921 2016-06-06 12:17:08 UTC <icedwater> http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/results-votes-june-5th-2016-in-switzerland/42153620 were the issues also voted upon at the referendum. Not "bundled", though.https://twitter.com/icedwater/status/739792678817124352
739792678817124352 2016-06-06 12:14:53 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany @nytimes interesting that only 46% bothered to show up, though. I wonder what the other bundled issues were...
739791177231126530 2016-06-06 12:08:55 UTC <icedwater> @noahtanyw I'd agree with you, but I don't know if any #sleague clubs are listening.
739691897589891072 2016-06-05 05:34:25 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname yup! I wanted to keep names intact at first, then I decided to translate to show a difference, and then I wasn't sure later.
739656382496968708 2016-06-05 03:13:18 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname tried to translate them into simplified Chinese:p
739632623748685824 2016-06-05 01:38:53 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname 
739630744255889409 2016-06-05 01:31:25 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname 
739629029460840448 2016-06-05 01:24:36 UTC <icedwater> 
739619827954810880 2016-06-05 00:48:03 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo its* :p
739497339312709633 2016-06-05 16:41:19 UTC <icedwater> @eisen looking back at the merger one we had, it was pretty clear those politicians knew what they were doing.
739496849996800001 2016-06-05 16:39:22 UTC <icedwater> @TheEconomist I suppose it would be more interesting to see if/why voters feel less alienated when it comes to Eurovision than other votes.
739491807583571969 2016-06-05 16:19:20 UTC <icedwater> @BradChacos @kuekj @shimmertje8 but still, if that message were to appear in my inbox without my logging in anywhere, I'd ignore it.
739491478762708992 2016-06-05 16:18:02 UTC <icedwater> @BradChacos @kuekj @shimmertje8 oh right. "If you didn't sign in from this location..."
739491253117558784 2016-06-05 16:17:08 UTC <icedwater> @BradChacos @kuekj @shimmertje8 hmm, but you only need to confirm if you've initiated some login process somewhere. If not, alarm bells.
739464739596574720 2016-06-05 14:31:47 UTC <icedwater> @femmekeyt @DybbukStay ugh. What in the world...
739426855015440385 2016-06-05 12:01:14 UTC <icedwater> @thelocalrebel that's good, but I was wondering about the need for an entire range of labels, since the site already explained MOGAI.
739394928963248130 2016-06-05 09:54:23 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah is it better now? I suppose if it's cleaned enough it shouldn't be an issue... but maybe go see a doctor tomorrow.
739386196434911232 2016-06-05 09:19:41 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @RedDot_Oz that's because you think most people in tumblr are young girls...
739384847064399873 2016-06-05 09:14:19 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @singnoname I don't think his speechwriter got to attend, though..
739384264492343296 2016-06-05 09:12:00 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya I don't know which Singaporeans you've talked to, but I haven't pinned any hopes on #toomuchattention to bring about change.
739381868760432640 2016-06-05 09:02:29 UTC <icedwater> @BradChacos @kuekj @shimmertje8 would you not already know if you didn't trigger the verification code in the first place, though?
739379025328541697 2016-06-05 08:51:11 UTC <icedwater> @thelocalrebel just went to find out what MOGAI means. There seems to have been a not-so-positive response to this: http://noyourenotmogai.tumblr.com/post/145319217428/what-the-flying-fuck
739359506342125573 2016-06-05 07:33:37 UTC <icedwater> @notessensei @harishpillay yes, but people still use Windows, as much as you'd like to deny it :p
739321634922725376 2016-06-04 05:03:08 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @notessensei on Windows too?
739321525703053313 2016-06-04 05:02:42 UTC <icedwater> @my_scio @harishpillay @steveleonardSG A: "what's wrong? food poisoning?" B: "no, I think I forgot to update my colon sensor"
739320214739779585 2016-06-04 04:57:29 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @BoschFawstin lol.
739317977556754432 2016-06-04 04:48:36 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk sure, but it doesn't always entail giving up your prior religious beliefs and convictions.
739317636173942784 2016-06-04 04:47:14 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk I sometimes ask myself the same thing. We all know Twitter isn't the best medium for debate. Yet we do it to feel good.
739317462152282112 2016-06-04 04:46:33 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk accepting of immigrants in general, obviously. You seem to like straw men a lot :)
739317219868303360 2016-06-04 04:45:35 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk I see a German university offering a course on Islam and I think "that's brilliant" rather than "oh dear".
739316898249072640 2016-06-04 04:44:19 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk growing up in Singapore has shown me intolerance goes on even with accommodating measures. Cities evolve. What's wrong?
739316239269404674 2016-06-04 04:41:41 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk I will have to take your word for it; 15 years ago I hadn't the means to travel to Brussels, Marseille, or Birmingham.
739315879502979074 2016-06-04 04:40:16 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk German university cafeterias label food as containing pork, garlic, or vegetarian. We don't speak of "veganisation".
739315425662504960 2016-06-04 04:38:27 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk does syariah override local law? Do halal kitchens harm non-Muslims? Does m/f segregation apply everywhere?
739315055754256384 2016-06-04 04:36:59 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk refusal to integrate is the immigrants' fault, but by no means theirs alone. Are people on the street accepting?
739314169661382656 2016-06-04 04:33:28 UTC <icedwater> @avalon good to see you again! Jiayou :)
738935210415263744 2016-06-03 03:27:37 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM thanks for the hard work! See you on the mainland sometime :) @jayhalia @whyvo
738684688361918465 2016-06-03 10:52:08 UTC <icedwater> @luczian you should be!!! 
738682829928701953 2016-06-03 10:44:45 UTC <icedwater> @luczian if not for you I'd not have remembered I had a MySpace account :p
738665777490845696 2016-06-03 09:36:59 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo no no we're joining your group mostly :p 8.45 at the terminal, right?
738633050666369024 2016-06-03 07:26:57 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo yup! I'm bringing a handful of other visitors to Ubin :)
738632674122682369 2016-06-03 07:25:27 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @saintinc not sure yet, but I'll have an eye on my Twitter feed tonight as two Singapore teams are involved in friendlies, though.
738632303514025984 2016-06-03 07:23:58 UTC <icedwater> @HandofGOD7 @neiljhk not any more, but don't be silly. It's far from Islamification. What's that even mean, there weren't Muslims before?
738612844028006401 2016-06-02 06:06:39 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @HandofGOD7 lol at "Islamification".
738540532427677696 2016-06-02 01:19:19 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname did they expect anything else? Facebook is a media company... ;)
738534230615941122 2016-06-02 00:54:16 UTC <icedwater> @mhdsymil come to Singapore next weekend for http://reg-classroom.peatix.com :p
738531066483380227 2016-06-02 00:41:42 UTC <icedwater> #SgFootball tonight: the Lions face Myanmar in the AYA Cup in Yangon, 7.30pm, while Singapore U21 plays Malaysia U21 in Malacca, 8.45pm. #fb
738408060306104320 2016-06-02 16:32:55 UTC <icedwater> @neiljhk @SSludgeworth lol.
738407146648276992 2016-06-02 16:29:17 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz dismissive as you may be, it's the norm for local celebrities to make it overseas before getting mainstream attention here...
738405306368036865 2016-06-02 16:21:58 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM thanks! I was looking at the site in the 4th June section thinking it was a one-day thing. Looking forward to it :)
738346965499416578 2016-06-02 12:30:09 UTC <icedwater> @JuriaTRM @juriatrm hi! May I know which works of yours will be exhibited on Ubin this Saturday?
738332288962813954 2016-06-02 11:31:49 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual in the Suzuki Cup.
738275984068071424 2016-06-02 07:48:05 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @Holbornlolz lol.
738275195169841152 2016-06-02 07:44:57 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG You forgot "Others" coffee chains have the most expensive coffee ;)
738237228996911104 2016-06-01 05:14:05 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname 62410241... wait, wrong number.
738236707548454912 2016-06-01 05:12:01 UTC <icedwater> @ResilienceGirl that data-gathering software the vulnerabilities research firm uses looks fresh out of Android 2.2 :p
738194096280330240 2016-06-01 02:22:42 UTC <icedwater> @astar_research nice try, Friday is still a ways away :p
738032840688816129 2016-06-01 15:41:55 UTC <icedwater> Jialat. 20 more minutes to spend the 3GB of data before the month is up. How?! 
738032332796370945 2016-06-01 15:39:54 UTC <icedwater> @serenelooys real life is more risky than wrestling. There people fly through tables but no blood is involved...
738029113345085443 2016-06-01 15:27:07 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @heyifeellike isn't that Donald Trump's hair?!
738021697459093504 2016-06-01 14:57:39 UTC <icedwater> @LividEye @x_ai @whyvo you prefer before 11.30 or after 1.30? :p
738020123588452353 2016-06-01 14:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah because someone else is driving, so you can daydream?
738019692955078656 2016-06-01 14:49:41 UTC <icedwater> @LividEye @x_ai @whyvo come timbre+ :p
737947131252609024 2016-06-01 10:01:21 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats @hrhgwenana welcome to my hood. Even the people who work here don't necessarily know the building names :P

737913404636205056 2016-06-01 07:47:20 UTC <icedwater> @Brannon1066 "Religion isn't real but Christians need to stop other religions." :P
737911836373340160 2016-06-01 07:41:06 UTC <icedwater> @TassiaGrover @LueYee @derekmhopper "may be", huh.
737839864679256064 2016-05-31 02:55:06 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 there is someone called scam, probably;)
737667352007868416 2016-05-31 15:29:36 UTC <icedwater> @elextrify in Singapore we go on grad trips also, isn't that usually the same thing unless the students had savings from part-time work?
737645608207454208 2016-05-31 14:03:12 UTC <icedwater> @eisen certain others were arrested for indecent exposure???
737639602761039872 2016-05-31 13:39:20 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua boring. If the victim had turned heel instead, that would be news:p
737435154088484864 2016-05-30 00:06:56 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv interesting. I am pretty sure the exchange of ideas helped, but "no such thing" is a strong claim.
737276821125791744 2016-05-30 13:37:46 UTC <icedwater> @bolasepako I know a "WM". Wouldn't mind a revival of "WM" for #SgFootball 
737271009229692929 2016-05-30 13:14:41 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @GreatDealsSG there are? I got a call from a random China number, voice message from "DHL". I hung up; hadn't ordered anything.
737251087959265280 2016-05-30 11:55:31 UTC <icedwater> @sgelection @singapolitics the alternative? "@wpsg chief Low Thia Khiang remains in power; unopposed at ceremonial party meeting"? Geez.
737250405092974592 2016-05-30 11:52:48 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I can't make tomorrow any more :( maybe Wednesday.
737246892904448000 2016-05-30 11:38:51 UTC <icedwater> @sarabfans same, the one in the Singapore Esplanade for the Little Black Dress tour on 2014-10-01, because it's the only one I've been to.
737089245236498432 2016-05-29 01:12:25 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan compare this with https://youtu.be/q9Php-bBsiA - I wonder if there was a fine for that!
736950310099243009 2016-05-29 16:00:20 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun @Amandajeyanam education by parents' merits, I suppose, so it's a meritocracy all right :p
736949404930703361 2016-05-29 15:56:44 UTC <icedwater> @outreachy @sarahsharp thanks for doing this and for the quick response as well :)
736947458308083713 2016-05-29 15:49:00 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 heh DTL too new eh?

736937679921643521 2016-05-29 15:10:09 UTC <icedwater> yes please hehe
736937585679818756 2016-05-29 15:09:46 UTC <icedwater> @sarahsharp , @outreachy sounds like a good idea but would it not be even better if a POC could perform that role instead?
736936302273138688 2016-05-29 15:04:40 UTC <icedwater> Still looking for 1 person to complete the team. If we have more, then both teams can win ;) #fbhttps://twitter.com/REG_Singapore/status/736753939568152578
736928761661136896 2016-05-29 14:34:42 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I won't be at CommunicAsia all the time but I plan to drop by on Tues. Where's your booth?
736928508891398144 2016-05-29 14:33:42 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 omg spoiler much
736913668370104320 2016-05-29 13:34:44 UTC <icedwater> @eisen futuresplaining history. Lol.
736891722521681920 2016-05-29 12:07:32 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @yazbanz indeed, I just thought of it.
736869075524014081 2016-05-29 10:37:32 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @singnoname @garyklh let's start a football satire site called bola-tak-negatif except that it reports real sgfootball news :P
736812054233767936 2016-05-28 06:50:57 UTC <icedwater> @nakasiv @STsportsdesk rookie coach, you mean...?
736777142927687680 2016-05-28 04:32:14 UTC <icedwater> Kinda odd to see an SBS bus plying this route, but at least the livery on this one looks better :) Baby steps.pic.twitter.com/Y7E1xrDjPe
736775754323755008 2016-05-28 04:26:43 UTC <icedwater> @towertransitSG Spotted a transition bus, nice new typeface on the sign but livery still unchanged. @towertransitsgpic.twitter.com/a3zB6xbgXj

736592896103571456 2016-05-28 16:20:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @RedDot_Oz @CSExodus don't forget "Be Yourself Day". Only one in 365.25.

736488589551230980 2016-05-28 09:25:37 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo hmm. It seems I only have a dinner at 7. What time are you folks staying on Ubin till?

736373674840719360 2016-05-27 01:48:59 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv umm... so they expect the fridge to be turned on and unused, or just sitting in the corner unplugged, or what...
736364283806650370 2016-05-27 01:11:40 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo yup. Confirmed. I'm out for 4th. Sorry! Maybe I'll go on the 5th instead.
736240350998630401 2016-05-27 16:59:13 UTC <icedwater> @jayhalia @whyvo haha yeah la I appreciate why we have to be there early. Eh wait. 4th? Hmm... looks like I do have something on 
736238429051047937 2016-05-27 16:51:34 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I'm going to camp on Ubin at that rate #westielife
736206071069478912 2016-05-27 14:43:00 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo count me in, I think
735990675473207297 2016-05-26 00:27:05 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv not disputing that.
735878341257887749 2016-05-26 17:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv "became CEO of a major company" isn't quite the same as "built the tech", though.
735701204848676865 2016-05-25 05:16:50 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @dwu00 and I am part of the 'we', am I not ;)
735631652395745280 2016-05-25 00:40:27 UTC <icedwater> @ResilienceGirl is it too bulky or general-purpose for these devices?
735495508202905603 2016-05-25 15:39:28 UTC <icedwater> @dwu00 @singnoname and, as it turns out, buy tickets...
735494101278171136 2016-05-25 15:33:53 UTC <icedwater> @ResilienceGirl when you think Windows don't you think POS pretty quickly?
735492965762633732 2016-05-25 15:29:22 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @Virtuous_Queen_ for the whole (long!) thread and @in__flux for RTing it on my timeline. Needs time to digest https://twitter.com/Virtuous_Queen_/status/734898207071703041
735492039677120512 2016-05-25 15:25:41 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish true. But I wish schools could encourage more learning, not just focus on competition.
735378837203234816 2016-05-25 07:55:52 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname it was the concert hall. Probably she was referring to the Esplanade itself and needed a segue to her cover of Sia's Chandelier.

734717662484303875 2016-05-23 12:08:35 UTC <icedwater> @guardian @DTguardian @moejoe1983 true, but maybe only the "strikers" were told to do this, he might have left the midfielders alone. #shrug
734716837682782208 2016-05-23 12:05:19 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat @DTguardian if those orders to take a touch are true, then it's quite a slap in the face that a first-time volley won him the Cup.
734665044902842369 2016-05-23 08:39:30 UTC <icedwater> @marcoagutier you meant this I suppose? http://solnic.eu/2016/05/22/my-time-with-rails-is-up.html
734558605505138689 2016-05-22 01:36:33 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold don't be too bothered by it. I've stopped figuring those out myself. :p
734554920163115014 2016-05-22 01:21:54 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz bit of self-interested mockery there by the NYT eh :p
734553547128360960 2016-05-22 01:16:27 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG everyone is. Don't worry. What's the worst that could happen? People mute or unfollow... you're likely not to ever meet anyway.
734553052120764418 2016-05-22 01:14:29 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual thanks for the math puzzle :)
734551501046091776 2016-05-22 01:08:19 UTC <icedwater> @engrg1 everyone knows that but a minister had to point it out :p

734189231178817536 2016-05-21 01:08:47 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @mintea for the past week, and welcome @Sarah_Jello_Pie as @hellofrmSG :)
734188572295581697 2016-05-21 01:06:10 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I wonder how Adrian Pang would do in the role...
733858924315578370 2016-05-20 03:16:16 UTC <icedwater> @Thfakehipster that's a relief at least I suppose.
733849913008611329 2016-05-20 02:40:28 UTC <icedwater> @Thfakehipster what happened to you, actually? You seem to be tweeting as usual but you keep mentioning hospital stuff... you OK?
733627498735357952 2016-05-20 11:56:40 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif where else will you be going and how long you have in Switzerland? Can take day trip from Zurich to mountainside.
733627202680422401 2016-05-20 11:55:29 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif ahaha oops. OK then let's see what we can do here...
733616604525666304 2016-05-20 11:13:23 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif I can't find you on WhatsApp, are you still in the Rainforest chat?
733615324617023488 2016-05-20 11:08:17 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif then I recommend this small town called Googlestreetview :P
733614238011285504 2016-05-20 11:03:58 UTC <icedwater> @FirdausKhalif what are you looking for?
733612777680474112 2016-05-20 10:58:10 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake that is to be expected because @sarahcoldheart is a winner :p
733524875814428672 2016-05-19 05:08:53 UTC <icedwater> are you sure that is the... correct analysis?
733511179977400321 2016-05-19 04:14:27 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai do you know the difference between "gerai" and "kedai"? Is it a pronunciation thing?
733505683207815169 2016-05-19 03:52:37 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo lol why you anyhowly kope... @hellofrmSG
733505133003186176 2016-05-19 03:50:26 UTC <icedwater> Yep, context is always important. Make sure you're trying to solve a problem, rather than throwing code around.https://twitter.com/ofmeowandbake/status/733494982284218368
733473621851525120 2016-05-19 01:45:13 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname I think I can only remember Louise.
733448781526491137 2016-05-19 00:06:30 UTC <icedwater> lol.
733448723112435713 2016-05-19 00:06:17 UTC <icedwater> @zvljoe yet they drew Hougang 1-1...
733448261873238018 2016-05-19 00:04:27 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname ah.
733444963048939520 2016-05-19 23:51:20 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname hmm. Was it Adams, Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, Halliwell?
733441285596418048 2016-05-19 23:36:43 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname they might, but I had to choose between forcing protector in there and mentioning defending champs :p
733440907471527937 2016-05-19 23:35:13 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus hmm. When were they added? I always thought it was July and August that came later due to imperial vanity.
733297891364610048 2016-05-19 14:06:55 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty I always tell you to go chope seats for SPW first what.
733292819222167552 2016-05-19 13:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I suppose it's a newer addition to the reasons why long drop is favoured?
733291746981879808 2016-05-19 13:42:31 UTC <icedwater> @Amandajeyanam I don't think he would have had anything to do with it. Which Google expert blocked you, anyway?
733291581684355073 2016-05-19 13:41:51 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz agreed.
733290365843734528 2016-05-19 13:37:01 UTC <icedwater> Defending champs shut out by champion defenders. Home United smash five past DPMM FC of Brunei at Bishan. #sleague #HOMDPM #fb

733176099811659776 2016-05-18 06:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale he's high anyway.. If Tampines can shrug off their financial problems, they're going to dig another hole they can Crouch in?!
732963424842350592 2016-05-18 15:57:52 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren indeed. I wouldn't mind either, but let's look harder for others as well first. Maybe organisations? @halalSG maybe, or @smrtsg ;)
732962961623408640 2016-05-18 15:56:02 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold yeah mostly just convenience I'd say. Did just fine without. @whyvo @hellofrmSG
732849140196118528 2016-05-18 08:23:45 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv maybe the HR is... A negotiator.
732758909518155776 2016-05-17 02:25:12 UTC <icedwater> @sophiaphotos hope this helps.pic.twitter.com/HxQg4bykL9

732728988318076928 2016-05-17 00:26:18 UTC <icedwater> @gnoserif @whyvo @AdamFlinter I'm sure those who've stuck at it for some time have already figured that out if they didn't know it at first.
732586569891094528 2016-05-17 15:00:23 UTC <icedwater> @1KarenWyld not sure how sustainable that is, though. Good to hear at any rate.
732582962353438724 2016-05-17 14:46:03 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb I like how you censor cocks but not c*nt ;)
732581137982181380 2016-05-17 14:38:48 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual ouch. That hurts.
732567211512991744 2016-05-17 13:43:28 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz maybe it's another step in separating @HomeUtdFC from its Police history and establishing a new identity. Or a pointless waste? :p
732559570720055296 2016-05-17 13:13:06 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I suppose they want to keep Police out of it? You could say it's a Fusion, no Police... @HomeUtdFC
732553039509250048 2016-05-17 12:47:09 UTC <icedwater> @ClaytonGoh you're the one following me, lol.
732543866759303168 2016-05-17 12:10:42 UTC <icedwater> @ClaytonGoh ha, no thanks.
732543728187932672 2016-05-17 12:10:09 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess ouch. I don't know much about .NET, what are the possible leaks? Is garbage collection not as reliable as they claim?
732543207356043264 2016-05-17 12:08:05 UTC <icedwater> @ClaytonGoh ridiculously irrelevant comment. Maybe you are really a supporter of who you claim to decry, making the opposition look stupid.
732408649029554176 2016-05-16 03:13:24 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thaali is awesome food for lazy folk. No need to think, just order, enjoy, and coma. #oec
732391089567498240 2016-05-16 02:03:37 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti that's okay. But the nice thing about shell commands is you can learn one step at a time and piece them together with |.
732390070359973888 2016-05-16 01:59:34 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti yeah, since media is already filtered out of the others category. I'd then | grep -v ".mp*" or something to just filter them out.
732234438269014016 2016-05-16 15:41:08 UTC <icedwater> except this time. All of North London is going to remember the runners up, for two opposite reasons. :P
732234248422363136 2016-05-16 15:40:23 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname nah, that would just be me throwing shade. @whyvo

732232169108570114 2016-05-16 15:32:07 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo maybe you just need to use the right kind of markers @singnoname
732231869912121346 2016-05-16 15:30:56 UTC <icedwater> I'm lazy to actually do the stats, but I think only the champions are remembered, so that probably narrows it down a bit...
732231567897026562 2016-05-16 15:29:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname dude. Just let it slide. @whyvo
732231399810437120 2016-05-16 15:29:04 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo now you know what the PAP folks have been going on about. "My words were taken out of context..."
732230211429797888 2016-05-16 15:24:21 UTC <icedwater> Is it just two, though?
732230079665872897 2016-05-16 15:23:49 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo except you wanted to delete that embarrassing thread ... ;)
732227980194287616 2016-05-16 15:15:29 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo on hindsight I could have done it more discreetly, but I was already late so I wanted to point it out asap :p
732227386742177793 2016-05-16 15:13:07 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA your case is different. We need to #stopthebear.
732226550439940096 2016-05-16 15:09:48 UTC <icedwater> This is awful. I wouldn't be surprised if we already had a variant of this in Singapore... https://twitter.com/alielmg88/status/732179863516274691
732226070238265344 2016-05-16 15:07:53 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo yeah, that's the job of the editorial team... play up certain angles, play down certain others. Live is best if you can get it.
732225275568652289 2016-05-16 15:04:44 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo oh, it was an edited version. Oops, heh.
732224888203706368 2016-05-16 15:03:12 UTC <icedwater> Do these studies really take more than 1 year to compile, though...https://twitter.com/intlspectator/status/731967433766887424
732218432247070720 2016-05-16 14:37:32 UTC <icedwater> @amichetti I don't know how it is on BSD, but on Linux I use du . --si -d1 -a | sort -hr to sort files in the current directory by size.
732206077765242880 2016-05-16 13:48:27 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah time to read Python course? :P

732205338275930112 2016-05-16 13:45:31 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @AdamFlinter did point this out earlier...
732204992954650624 2016-05-16 13:44:08 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen I'll check it out, thanks!
732204665731829760 2016-05-16 13:42:50 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @whyvo eh wait! Those look like BH's own views... "This is me - mistress of the wall - talking"...
732204179494600704 2016-05-16 13:40:54 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen looks great. Where was it? :D
732203649766543360 2016-05-16 13:38:48 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo lololol the RGS version of Rafflesians Unite was LOWER than the RI version can?! Goosebumps only.
732203249290223616 2016-05-16 13:37:12 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname "is not. Is my Facebook admin write one."
732203037368803328 2016-05-16 13:36:22 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I felt studying overseas helped me a lot more. NS lets you assert and make a stand if your rank bars opposition.
732202204723970048 2016-05-16 13:33:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang no matter how sour your grapes are, they're still consistent top 4...
732149893305786369 2016-05-16 10:05:11 UTC <icedwater> @YZD24 I tried it before. I think not bad leh. You?
732139263165259776 2016-05-16 09:22:57 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter yes, but I think the motivation was to study tonal + non-tonal bilinguals first.
732135612451454976 2016-05-16 09:08:27 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @whyvo "well, I am here now..."
732062205697384448 2016-05-15 04:16:45 UTC <icedwater> @tokyo_0 fully-qualified domain names, of course not literally, but you know, System.out.println vs print is a pain.
732010120540884992 2016-05-15 00:49:47 UTC <icedwater> because she's a painting, not a person, right.
731886717691527168 2016-05-15 16:39:25 UTC <icedwater> @tokyo_0 ugh. I suppose. Never been able to appreciate the FQDNs you need to type in Java. Feels too crufty to me.
731816264109187072 2016-05-15 11:59:28 UTC <icedwater> @tokyo_0 I agree. But it would make rules easier to enforce and learn for prescriptivist grammar types. Then again, JSLint/JSHint.
731797237894811648 2016-05-15 10:43:52 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish lol nope. As long as I can find and eat, GP or PG is immaterial.
731796885346779136 2016-05-15 10:42:28 UTC <icedwater> @chonburi_fc @JakartaCasual @krisnawani point. But let's see what he can do. He's just deputy CEO. Not even Obama could do all he wanted.
731796624498778112 2016-05-15 10:41:26 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG eeps. Good to know.
731796619641815040 2016-05-15 10:41:24 UTC <icedwater> @tokyo_0 yeah, but one good thing about natural language is its flexibility. I wonder what happens if we actually build and test one though.
731735518128439297 2016-05-14 06:38:37 UTC <icedwater> @kidviolente @hellofrmSG thanks @Kidviolente and welcome back, @mintea!
731703738985893888 2016-05-14 04:32:20 UTC <icedwater> they're no longer called Sengkang Punggol. Though I hardly think it matters to you :)
731495286191710213 2016-05-14 14:44:01 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz hehe the answer is no. I was hoping the Ladies' FA Cup final would be available here somehow. Anyway I've got TNA Impact instead.
731493210657193984 2016-05-14 14:35:46 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz is it on @ElevenSportsSG? :p
731487897824591875 2016-05-14 14:14:39 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 I'm reading this right now, but I was going to call bullshit on your statement anyway...https://www.quora.com/Tennis-Why-dont-grand-slams-introduce-best-of-five-sets-matches-for-women-too
731487004282654720 2016-05-14 14:11:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @furryphotos ain't no worries bout love when you got game
731486009003626500 2016-05-14 14:07:09 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake NO, BUT WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR THE REPAINTING OF THE FENCE BETWEEN BLOCKS 12 AND 15 WHEN YOU KNEW OUR BUDGET WAS LOW?
731472407186169857 2016-05-14 13:13:06 UTC <icedwater> That's almost a tonne a day... Astounding.https://twitter.com/BBCOurWorld/status/731452170164260864
731472405185449985 2016-05-14 13:13:06 UTC <icedwater> (Clubs) doing the same things  looking at sponsorship, then looking at more sponsorship.. 'Wheres the innovation?'https://twitter.com/SilverEllin/status/731238435126714374
731466289416282112 2016-05-14 12:48:48 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake oh cool. Then it's like ours. I attended in my parents' stead. So much arguing, and belabouring of points.
731465610358480896 2016-05-14 12:46:06 UTC <icedwater> @avelokiteshvara I have always used it to mean chill out somewhere, if at all. I kinda see your point though...
731460306551984128 2016-05-14 12:25:01 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake it's in BKK? Wouldn't you have to know Thai though...
731458791569379328 2016-05-14 12:19:00 UTC <icedwater> @gsf822 it's also typically a fully-enclosed section that no one can look into.
731421116892225536 2016-05-14 09:49:18 UTC <icedwater> @TikiTactic @giggs_boson @addey1983 @markk3nney I'm not sure what you were trying to prove with that, except that clubs market well in Asia.
731410449686634496 2016-05-14 09:06:54 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 who set the rules for women to play fewer sets in the first place?
731406187669815297 2016-05-14 08:49:58 UTC <icedwater> @TikiTactic @giggs_boson @addey1983 @markk3nney actually, it's just because the British Empire hasn't entirely been removed from Asian minds
731367635871399936 2016-05-13 06:16:47 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual Jorg Steinbrunner to take over at Leicester; Man U sign Claudio Ranieri?!
731367371923816448 2016-05-13 06:15:44 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah I think you'll find a few problems if you put the whites together with the coloureds there, though...
731366122625228801 2016-05-13 06:10:46 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 if you want to use endeavour and entertainment value as a benchmark, feel free. But even that gap isn't as ridiculous.
731365876532809728 2016-05-13 06:09:47 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 much higher standard how again?https://youtu.be/-tCHxXuY5IE
731357739536896000 2016-05-13 05:37:27 UTC <icedwater> @gsf822 is your house a bathroom?!
731354831550484480 2016-05-13 05:25:54 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GLAiV_Gale @rennardho @abearfromSEA intensity +100. It's not bitter at all ;)
731354251494981632 2016-05-13 05:23:36 UTC <icedwater> @TikiTactic @giggs_boson @addey1983 you wish you were :)
731354050172583936 2016-05-13 05:22:48 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 just as relevant though. Why should inequity in one sport justify the same in another?
731350164103794689 2016-05-13 05:07:21 UTC <icedwater> @TikiTactic @giggs_boson and that's why the English are doing so well worldwide.
731345264661778433 2016-05-13 04:47:53 UTC <icedwater> you don't suppose Python was written in hot air, do you...
731334115853668352 2016-05-13 04:03:35 UTC <icedwater> @TheCWW @addey1983 and in cooking Chinese food is as tasty as Indian food. What?
731127261525512192 2016-05-13 14:21:37 UTC <icedwater> @SaraBareilles is this your next album, Playdoh Peglegs?
731121442381668352 2016-05-13 13:58:30 UTC <icedwater> @MightyStags @madibotak dunno leh. Apparently that's only about 3K because 8K paid...?
731101951195127808 2016-05-13 12:41:03 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale you lucky they never charge you $2 and call it americano
730986114782126080 2016-05-12 05:00:45 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua @yazbanz @singnoname #finallygotthejoke
730978090080292864 2016-05-12 04:28:52 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch it's possible ... In a pinch
730790004121686016 2016-05-12 16:01:29 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @frhn you have a problem with xe/ze but not xie/zie?! Or just couldn't be bothered to type all :p
730789485621841921 2016-05-12 15:59:25 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter do you really want to look like a gaudy version of Spurs though?!
730786459360235521 2016-05-12 15:47:23 UTC <icedwater> @MicroSFF hmm, I thought it was 9-9-5-5-9. Fair enough either way.
730786162856452096 2016-05-12 15:46:13 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah you think so? The current one has dealt with worse...
730786002608869376 2016-05-12 15:45:35 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @dk #wahsey
730785399954530304 2016-05-12 15:43:11 UTC <icedwater> @MicroSFF not at all :) I know what you mean :)
730785057422475264 2016-05-12 15:41:49 UTC <icedwater> @MicroSFF the four-syllable middle lines kinda bother me though, to be honest... But hey, poetic licence. Keep going :)
730782726077321217 2016-05-12 15:32:33 UTC <icedwater> @MicroSFF then "Venus" would have to be pronounced the non-German way to rhyme, though...
730774361536266241 2016-05-12 14:59:19 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz indeed.
730770999675748353 2016-05-12 14:45:58 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz it may be, but who are you to criticize a family for wanting a baby?
730721340949307392 2016-05-12 11:28:38 UTC <icedwater> @nurasirah @hellofrmSG roti canai, even :p
730643773038821377 2016-05-11 06:20:24 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @patio11 it used to happen between firms of similar stature, though. They're just bringing patterns over. We need to stop it.
730371416189599744 2016-05-11 12:18:09 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo heh you were in the area? What talk was it?
730358366447374336 2016-05-11 11:26:18 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @singnoname @hellofrmSG yes, but did you feel something inside yourself?!
730246560311738369 2016-05-10 04:02:01 UTC <icedwater> @STcom not sure about the relevance of the last paragraph though. Was it to enable old friends to identify her?
730198045443268608 2016-05-10 00:49:15 UTC <icedwater> Anyone else using @fenix_app here?

730078205915205633 2016-05-10 16:53:03 UTC <icedwater> Oh dear. Bad omen for the Friday 13th #sleague clash? Or are they just using up their bad luck quota first? xDhttps://twitter.com/HomeUtdFC/status/729634528155865089
730071507213295616 2016-05-10 16:26:26 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun @AdamFlinter have a great time! May #CPFC teach van Gaal's United how to attack. I grew up loving Ferguson's United. Miss it.
730070398574862336 2016-05-10 16:22:01 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 Maybe the Hassan Sunny connection and poor management of the Thai league might induce some to journey south... Who am I kidding :p
730049191745966081 2016-05-10 14:57:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'd love to hear what you learned! I suppose @scapeinvasion isn't open to the public...
730026828392366082 2016-05-10 13:28:53 UTC <icedwater> @hhpapazian democracy is perfectly fine. I don't know about the voters, though...
730025794978734080 2016-05-10 13:24:47 UTC <icedwater> @omgthatspunny @huinandez wouldn't have happened in the Marvel Universe, so it would really have to be an AU-Thor...
730025571892101120 2016-05-10 13:23:54 UTC <icedwater> @athenastars pity. Balestier were losing 3-0 last I checked. Well at least Tampines got through.
730024240204800000 2016-05-10 13:18:36 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany folks need to invent an Ebatte to make #Spargeldebatte a thing :P
730001071540592642 2016-05-10 11:46:32 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen hmm. Looks like Cash Studio is most popular. I am happy with Teo Heng. Somewhere in Pasir Panjang there's a steamboat + ktv
729992774594891776 2016-05-10 11:13:34 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I'll only make it in at around half-time.
729940939389554688 2016-05-10 07:47:36 UTC <icedwater> @athenastars best case scenario: Tampines fails to qualify, but Balestier goes through :D
729940730815217664 2016-05-10 07:46:46 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I will! Going to check it out with a friend. Super amused other clubs got free tickets. Each club got ten, might as well don't give
729847634739892224 2016-05-09 01:36:50 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz hahaha where will you be at 7pm today?
729659363070124032 2016-05-09 13:08:43 UTC <icedwater> @HUAIMIN17 I would have answered, but you should have googled why for yourself first.
729659063496138753 2016-05-09 13:07:31 UTC <icedwater> @notessensei was sei denn Notessen? ...oh

729601876715429889 2016-05-09 09:20:17 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG did they say what was particularly surprising? I think that might just be my holiday this year...
729539990653296640 2016-05-08 05:14:22 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @kiampah @grubbypea of course it's of no benefit. But aren't you curious about North Korea at all?
729492103625990144 2016-05-08 02:04:05 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname lol thanks. It was primarily a very late response to that other piece. I felt that I might have been more coherent.
729417895877312512 2016-05-08 21:09:12 UTC <icedwater> Drifty piece about #sgfootball here. Feedback appreciated. Probably should sleep now... http://www.icedwater.com/raising-singapores-football-standards/
729284551390863360 2016-05-08 12:19:21 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua ha
729280428184457216 2016-05-08 12:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @FirEicia as a former counting agent volunteer, it would be really nice if you could just get your vote done simply...
729253980694405120 2016-05-08 10:17:52 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo @NostalgiComplex heh thought so ;)
729251344922476544 2016-05-08 10:07:24 UTC <icedwater> @ClandestineYeo yours are the pink stacks and @nostalgicomplex had the white ones?
729166548103892992 2016-05-07 04:30:26 UTC <icedwater> @flatbreads not only that, they'll never have a coach that says "let me adapt our system to what you can play best as"
729165878906920961 2016-05-07 04:27:47 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang I also dunno. What matters is she chose to fly the Singapore flag. She has Korean/Singaporean parentage apparently.
728987984976973825 2016-05-07 16:40:54 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya @commonlynoun it's not "apathy", it's pragmatism. Why should we vote against promised upgrades, right?
728970732948983808 2016-05-07 15:32:21 UTC <icedwater> @CoconutsSG oops 62.9 even...
728970345164591104 2016-05-07 15:30:48 UTC <icedwater> @In_infinitum @in_infinitum maybe I'm taking you too literally, but "every" election was not won by the PAP...
728970038737141760 2016-05-07 15:29:35 UTC <icedwater> Hmmm @CoconutsSG 69.2% to 39.8% .... What? #SGByElection
728969672767340544 2016-05-07 15:28:08 UTC <icedwater> @ajishmorris based on my volunteer stint at a counting centre, there could be just a lot of disputed votes. We can only wait, anyway.
728967545395380225 2016-05-07 15:19:41 UTC <icedwater> @In_infinitum @in_infinitum so how does one explain their past by-election losses?
728955935905882112 2016-05-07 14:33:33 UTC <icedwater> @HaseenahKoya is it really his home turf though?
728954766282252288 2016-05-07 14:28:54 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @kiampah now SG can get mah. But surcharge gao gao. If you coming down often I can see if my contacts can bring back some.
728953746512695297 2016-05-07 14:24:51 UTC <icedwater> @Gambariste huh?
728953342869667843 2016-05-07 14:23:14 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale actually @huinandez  can be quite CB but he's more exciting as LB or RB.
728942630151725057 2016-05-07 13:40:40 UTC <icedwater> @thenewpaper you forgot Bt Gombak Stadium exists?
728938527992385536 2016-05-07 13:24:22 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas it's important that everyone agre- hmm...
728933853721559040 2016-05-07 13:05:48 UTC <icedwater> Ironic that this is being tweeted five times by a bot called Vote WP Out. Totally irrelevant. https://twitter.com/votewpout/status/728717536225697796
728927211642757121 2016-05-07 12:39:24 UTC <icedwater> I suppose this is a sane compromise @hai_ren...
728922971461455873 2016-05-07 12:22:33 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname well, well...
728789885427974144 2016-05-06 03:33:43 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale @singnoname ?
728788865104760836 2016-05-06 03:29:40 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake let's ban white rice! Give farmers and construction workers less energy to work! Food and infrastructure grows by itself!
728788233924935680 2016-05-06 03:27:09 UTC <icedwater> @vijayashankara @shimmertje8 well it's a worthy cause, but I'm glad at least it's not a technical issue. Just put 931 on an iPad for work.
728775075407634432 2016-05-06 02:34:52 UTC <icedwater> @POZboySG damn! Always thought she was from Sweden. Ignore last :p
728774361465790465 2016-05-06 02:32:02 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I don't mind it myself, but if it's "to go", you're probably going to wreck the artwork or not even see it; just get a flat white.
728758568606785537 2016-05-06 01:29:17 UTC <icedwater> @POZboySG wrong! It's bjrk bjrk bjrk :p
728757189163114497 2016-05-06 01:23:48 UTC <icedwater> @Languagebandit is this related to "hleb" in some way? Thanks @POZboySG for the RT.
728752594768650240 2016-05-06 01:05:32 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname waiting for your character to join the fray ;)

728518815286317056 2016-05-06 09:36:35 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT @HougangUnited in good company! Manchester United's M. Rashford also has school commitments holding him back ;)
728518520531615745 2016-05-06 09:35:25 UTC <icedwater> @PyLadiesSG @kiampah also, you might want to meet with @pyladiessg if they have study groups. Learning together is always better.
728518058378076160 2016-05-06 09:33:34 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah I'm getting a small group of beginner programmers going. Want to meet up?
728515538012364800 2016-05-06 09:23:34 UTC <icedwater> @woohuiren time to look for a new job ;)
728467884377149440 2016-05-05 06:14:12 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual it's hard for the lei-man to tell the difference.
728394094108545024 2016-05-05 01:20:59 UTC <icedwater> Please help @ireland!https://twitter.com/doglab/status/727951267226595328
728370565002584064 2016-05-05 23:47:29 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz I don't care either way, but that video is as specific as it needs to be. We need people who can verify those statements.
728254278943449088 2016-05-05 16:05:25 UTC <icedwater> @ileksua I know from the grapevine that some companies might be sunsetting soon...
728247656720388097 2016-05-05 15:39:06 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @whyvo @nicshields "we" are just two members. I'm not sure if we should go for comedy or correctness when translating...
728247337584300034 2016-05-05 15:37:50 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @kiampah oh. Wrong number. You all don't prank call can.
728247032033378305 2016-05-05 15:36:37 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @ladystormhold it's changing for sure. We need to at least document it before it goes completely to a Chinese pidgin
728243961542811648 2016-05-05 15:24:25 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan only skimmed it, gotta re-read, but the comments are cute
728228354357268480 2016-05-05 14:22:24 UTC <icedwater> @BernieSanders @downey that's amazing, but what does it mean to "keep up with productivity"?
728228098181713921 2016-05-05 14:21:23 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah I just update a textfile on Dropbox actually...
728227114147667968 2016-05-05 14:17:28 UTC <icedwater> @datagovsg sorry I didn't get around to playing more with your datasets, but thanks for all the good work you're doing!
728039507493146624 2016-05-04 01:51:59 UTC <icedwater> I don't think lab coats are free size, are they? Looking to borrow one for a friend... #fb
728020685256196096 2016-05-04 00:37:11 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname heh
727891026703056896 2016-05-04 16:01:58 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @singnoname why no Ruel Fox. Oh, there's Alicia Fox from WWE too :p
727889729681641472 2016-05-04 15:56:49 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname actually this blue is more SunkFirst blue right...
727889381848031232 2016-05-04 15:55:26 UTC <icedwater> This Human Of meme has gone too far! LOL @HomeUtdFC
727854467752722432 2016-05-04 13:36:42 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA no. Only #LionsXII are world champions.
727801934309003264 2016-05-04 10:07:57 UTC <icedwater> There are ways to be transparent and yet protect people who need to protected. @KenJeyaretnam
727792509280079872 2016-05-04 09:30:30 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @whyvo @nicshields it's still evolving. I started a Singlish translation group for Ubuntu years ago but we've done nothing yet.
727783156196106240 2016-05-04 08:53:20 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @nicshields you win already lor.
727783056736591872 2016-05-04 08:52:56 UTC <icedwater> @nicshields @whyvo not in this thread, no, but I've heard it too often to ignore. It's a thing...
727781938354741248 2016-05-04 08:48:30 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo @nicshields it's too easy to assume it's just adding a lah at the end of the sentence lah
727742014998102017 2016-05-03 06:09:51 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam it's possible to produce evidence and reveal the truth without circulating pictures on social media.
727731204871622656 2016-05-03 05:26:54 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid lol no sympathy at all eh
727690068781989889 2016-05-03 02:43:26 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb of course, fixture arrangement right?
727652492670984192 2016-05-03 00:14:08 UTC <icedwater> .@eleybourn @harishpillay not bad, though I have to insist the particle 'lah' is not meaningless.
727645436786266112 2016-05-03 23:46:05 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb well, are you going to sponsor @officialdpmmfc flights and hotels for away #sleague games?
727501115474890752 2016-05-03 14:12:36 UTC <icedwater> @nasrul_ekky lol!
727499646067560448 2016-05-03 14:06:46 UTC <icedwater> @dfordeeps @mdnoorhadi for you, maybe. Not for me. But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
727499305653694465 2016-05-03 14:05:25 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi @razvancaliman good question, I actually haven't even tried that browser. :p
727498490025144320 2016-05-03 14:02:10 UTC <icedwater> @dfordeeps @mdnoorhadi a moment of silence for those who slept through the Chelsea-Spurs match and thus had a good night's rest ;)
727497621418307585 2016-05-03 13:58:43 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang lol. Bad bet?
727311102082580482 2016-05-02 01:37:34 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @whyvo the facades at least are still enjoyable, and since we can't have more to hold on to we should cherish that.
727309814842290177 2016-05-02 01:32:27 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam and circulate photos out of schadenfreude? Saving evidence is one thing, I see no point in sharing for public consumption.
727013626888904704 2016-05-01 05:55:30 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue that's a transition many stars have made. I suppose I'd have to go watch/read to see how this was managed better as you say..
727013120359583744 2016-05-01 05:53:29 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I didn't even check the capacity, I just assumed it was compensated for in height. Sigh.
726977067313569792 2016-05-01 03:30:14 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue what transition? I've been ignoring Swift...
726794441663508481 2016-05-01 15:24:32 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake @singnoname and LSFC is "like she f'n cares..."
726794055502295040 2016-05-01 15:23:00 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan I know right? This bus driver uncle would have killed opponents ten years ago.
726793819484618752 2016-05-01 15:22:04 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake grass turn blue still cannot win. Jialat.
726778348077088770 2016-05-01 14:20:35 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname huh got meh darn should have watched the live stream at least
726765332723961857 2016-05-01 13:28:52 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang why you push party girls one. Tsk
726763800720867329 2016-05-01 13:22:47 UTC <icedwater> @SwedishCanary @shimmertje8 ooooooooo
726735992036585472 2016-05-01 11:32:17 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam well maybe they have sufficient evidence to prove it. But we don't. So, all we can do is guess. Or you could ask for proof?
726720383664066564 2016-05-01 10:30:15 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter what was the next in line?
726716682857664512 2016-05-01 10:15:33 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam everything is conjecture until you can prove it. Do you have evidence of anything?
726716140689362945 2016-05-01 10:13:24 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty that makes you a Man Utd fan ;)
726636490327912448 2016-04-30 04:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter lol Surrey, Singapore, and Bangkok
726630302097887232 2016-04-30 04:32:18 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas @matthew_d_green hmm. That is scary indeed.
726615947901997057 2016-04-30 03:35:16 UTC <icedwater> @ariffin_sha I think so too, but the act of bringing family out could be interpreted as a demonstration "I'm not David". CSJ should know.
726614775602405376 2016-04-30 03:30:37 UTC <icedwater> Hmm. Whose words are those in quotes...https://twitter.com/ChanLuoErCNA/status/726598163340005376
726614095311446016 2016-04-30 03:27:54 UTC <icedwater> @whyvo I'm fine with Orchard Rd staying, it has been around for a long time...
726597382280880129 2016-04-30 02:21:30 UTC <icedwater> @matthew_d_green what are your sources for this though? @kushaldas
726591568375730176 2016-04-30 01:58:23 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 I don't have a fingerprint sensor. I know the rationale behind covering these, but how do you personally rate the risk levels?
726590946440179717 2016-04-30 01:55:55 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I had no idea you were Orthodox, or are you just aware of the difference?
726447682143707136 2016-04-30 16:26:38 UTC <icedwater> @TheAwesomeYan catch you at the next event, when they come back from KL, maybe?
726444947654610945 2016-04-30 16:15:46 UTC <icedwater> @ariffin_sha sure thing. Hang on.
726444878394056704 2016-04-30 16:15:30 UTC <icedwater> @TheAwesomeYan ahaha OK brainfart. I saw "Season 2016". Sorry for being lame! Still wondering though. But hope you enjoyed the 2-1 win.
726442939166007296 2016-04-30 16:07:48 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz but only track record matters, for surely one cannot prevent a person of unflawed character from tarnish forever. How to predict?
726442155372240897 2016-04-30 16:04:41 UTC <icedwater> @ariffin_sha one sec. Let me pull up the article again to catch the obvious ones.
726441890925568002 2016-04-30 16:03:38 UTC <icedwater> @TheAwesomeYan good job for flying over! Just curious, where did you buy DPMM season ticket in Singapore?
726408412414660609 2016-04-30 13:50:36 UTC <icedwater> @ariffin_sha thanks for the piece, but it looks like you need proofreading help at @tocsg... May I be of service?
726397550626893826 2016-04-30 13:07:26 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards I've missed it too, I think. But what good would that do?
726391772109111296 2016-04-30 12:44:28 UTC <icedwater> Of course, until this is proven, it is still conjecture. @KenJeyaretnam
726391537613963264 2016-04-30 12:43:32 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz nope :( YY got a red.
726390905125494785 2016-04-30 12:41:02 UTC <icedwater> Poor @YZD24. Tough luck I guess! #TAMWAR
726270982999019520 2016-04-29 04:44:30 UTC <icedwater> @x_ai @ofmeowandbake @joleeqh @Popiahskin68 @jayhalia I want to watch it again! I have the DVD :D
726266001180905472 2016-04-29 04:24:42 UTC <icedwater> @SCDF @kuekj they arrived on the scene by 5.50, or at least that's when I first saw them. In any case that is quick response time. Thanks!
726261495915405312 2016-04-29 04:06:48 UTC <icedwater> @KenJeyaretnam let's also not forget that this is a personal indiscretion.
726261135591112704 2016-04-29 04:05:22 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 in the local branch office I suppose. That's what they were saying.
726260853217988609 2016-04-29 04:04:15 UTC <icedwater> @kixes @notabilia you'll have to forgive these PAP Associates if they come across as a little PAternalistic sometimes.
726260436870434818 2016-04-29 04:02:36 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi #ktvbojio
726176581270433792 2016-04-29 22:29:23 UTC <icedwater> Fire still burning in the hall. I can only judge from the silence that people are safe, at least. #HillviewFire #fbpic.twitter.com/e7YhXlLTjE
726174908019961856 2016-04-29 22:22:44 UTC <icedwater> Police on the ground checking that residents of Blk 69 are safe; #HillviewFire seems to be out. Crowd dispersing #fbpic.twitter.com/l5Eb3lEd6n
726173538193825793 2016-04-29 22:17:17 UTC <icedwater> Flames no longer visible from ground level. People and rescuers at balcony on level 7. Smoke still heavy. #HillviewFire #fb
726172169126846466 2016-04-29 22:11:51 UTC <icedwater> Smoke is subsiding. #HillviewFire is not completely out yet. It seems mother and child have been rescued from the room. #fb
726168911872315392 2016-04-29 21:58:54 UTC <icedwater> Sounds of fire being put out. Hope everyone is safe as possible now and receiving treatment if needed #fb #HillviewFire
726168048353202176 2016-04-29 21:55:28 UTC <icedwater> Fire brigade and police are on the scene. Not sure what the delay is. #fb #HillviewFire
726167035298750468 2016-04-29 21:51:27 UTC <icedwater> Blk 69 fire at Hillview Green. Please leave the block for safety if you haven't. #fb
726096724742168576 2016-04-29 17:12:04 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname that depends. Is it a neutrally-funded light bulb?
726096514058047492 2016-04-29 17:11:13 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv damn it, I was just trying to paste " " because I'd never seen  "" or "" in Cyrillic before.
726095338256228353 2016-04-29 17:06:33 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv that's my point :) @shimmertje8 @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG
726095117921095681 2016-04-29 17:05:40 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 just because you can Singlish I can Singlish doesn't mean I will Singlish when you talk to me what...
726085885200998400 2016-04-29 16:28:59 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG when was the insistence on Mother Tongue started?
726085348158119936 2016-04-29 16:26:51 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG yeah, implementation.. Not all Chinese identify Mandarin as their mother tongue, that's the problem
726084821328392192 2016-04-29 16:24:46 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname CSJ, or MP?
726068266544680960 2016-04-29 15:18:59 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter have a safe flight @commonlynoun :)
726067566846693376 2016-04-29 15:16:12 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan which beer?
726067385766010880 2016-04-29 15:15:29 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @shimmertje8 @hellofrmSG so it's the implementation that's an issue? If e.g. Hakka, Javanese, Thai were valid mother tongues...
726066557906907136 2016-04-29 15:12:11 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @shimmertje8 @hellofrmSG I suppose framing them as mother tongues rather than local languages and the imposition is the problem
726066207531528192 2016-04-29 15:10:48 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @shimmertje8 @hellofrmSG maybe, though I was just trying hard to see what could be wrong about it. Mother tongue per se is OK.
726062865451376640 2016-04-29 14:57:31 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG I don't think that's a problem. I suppose it could be better if we chose which local language to learn
726058755465433088 2016-04-29 14:41:11 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi no guarantee but I'm working on something that will be there.
726042536104488960 2016-04-29 13:36:44 UTC <icedwater> Regardless of which party wins this #BBByElection, the upgrading plans will be carried out. I wonder if that applied to all other wards..
726039331396177920 2016-04-29 13:24:00 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen nope. Couldn't snap any cookies, too dark and he was in black. That was more attention than he deserved.
726037233426268161 2016-04-29 13:15:40 UTC <icedwater> Lol. Minor celebrity spotted at the SDP rally. Yeeeeeeah, it's the Famous Amos getting all the attention he deserves...
726035451295854595 2016-04-29 13:08:35 UTC <icedwater> Jumped to the @yourSDP rally to get a sense of what is going on. But let's see if @PAPSingapore gets the vote in the end... #BBByElection
726023400741736448 2016-04-29 12:20:42 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan he's gonna speak soon apparently. After this Josephus chap is done MC-ing.pic.twitter.com/nlpsY8dJLc
726021019157159936 2016-04-29 12:11:14 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter is that statistically significant? Fewer than 20 instances...
726002479997939712 2016-04-29 10:57:34 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi oh you too
725999058758696961 2016-04-29 10:43:58 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards something bothering you that bad? Need a listening ear?
725997372338114560 2016-04-29 10:37:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG are they all dressed in donated costumes though
725997219757756416 2016-04-29 10:36:40 UTC <icedwater> @notabilia @kixes @hai_ren of course, and if you disagree, you can't be a true Singaporean...
725996995966472196 2016-04-29 10:35:46 UTC <icedwater> @HillaryClinton @stressaholic quite obviously, the #TrumpCard.
725990128179519488 2016-04-29 10:08:29 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter y u maek poopy joke.
725989349397946368 2016-04-29 10:05:23 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter which way then?
725928705608949760 2016-04-28 06:04:25 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv apparently it was worth enough of your time to snark and share an article with :p
725928541078978560 2016-04-28 06:03:45 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter idiots on the left and right frame it as zero sum, because to them issues are binary. Right/wrong.
725928057555410944 2016-04-28 06:01:50 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv you have to accept that people have different circumstances and opinions. But what she did was wrong, of course.

725925135308312576 2016-04-28 05:50:13 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @sgbreakingnews. What he's saying is, SingPass is secure enough for income tax collection and buying a HDB but not for @sgelection?
725924525796298753 2016-04-28 05:47:48 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj sorry, not Woodlands. Brainfart. So which buses went over from Seletar side?
725923714332651521 2016-04-28 05:44:35 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj yeah when 176/361/365/367 swapped from red to yellow. What was in Woodlands?
725857740963205120 2016-04-28 01:22:25 UTC <icedwater> @joannerock clearly it didn't bother you enough to actually tell him about it :p
725849993312006144 2016-04-28 00:51:38 UTC <icedwater> @FirEicia probably our technical level is not enough to give him the service he needs
725846137735798784 2016-04-28 00:36:19 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @HXXIV @hellofrmSG I suppose it might be that we're taught too well that only authority effects change and others suck it up.
725845275323977729 2016-04-28 00:32:53 UTC <icedwater> @HXXIV @hellofrmSG if only those with less privilege would respond...
725725472781307904 2016-04-28 16:36:50 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty what is the salakkau!?
725725133508206592 2016-04-28 16:35:29 UTC <icedwater> @IAmJericho d, u, m, b, a, s, s. Which is more than they could manage, probably.
725724578543071232 2016-04-28 16:33:17 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv a popular tuition centre chain. Have you never noticed it? You're fortunate, or you have good #gold90filters.
725705058520715266 2016-04-28 15:15:43 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv the miracle called mindstretchers?

725690942716399616 2016-04-28 14:19:38 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @kingsclassics let's leave it at that, then :)
725675439071449089 2016-04-28 13:18:01 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv @kingsclassics then you have to pick it up yourself. It's the delivery that encourages thinking. Content is secondary.
725664654735736833 2016-04-28 12:35:10 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG we have to start with those who can be mobilised then...
725642437188677632 2016-04-28 11:06:53 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @hellofrmSG I don't care and it doesn't matter anyway... Oh, right ;)
725642200881590272 2016-04-28 11:05:57 UTC <icedwater> @kingsclassics @infernoxv any degree can be training for tech success, provided you learn to think.
725640515882901504 2016-04-28 10:59:15 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus I knew a SAT that had 1600 max, then I think they scaled up at some point. Is it back to 1600?
725640182834176000 2016-04-28 10:57:55 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG of course. There are many ways to raise awareness.
725620275912404992 2016-04-28 09:38:49 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG probably not. We're too top-down. But the point of activism is to get results, or at least raise awareness right? Latter can.
725475826842521600 2016-04-27 00:04:50 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld ah I see! So it's been long enough that you don't feel like you're missing anything, I suppose. Thanks. Have you seen mock meat?
725471966195384320 2016-04-27 23:49:30 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld nice! When are you non-vegan vegetarian? And did you ever eat meat?
725469568676679680 2016-04-27 23:39:58 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch then how?!
725469345367752704 2016-04-27 23:39:05 UTC <icedwater> @jaythenerdkid hope you're all right :) keep on being you!
725466370264027136 2016-04-27 23:27:15 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid that should be followed by the disappearance of all such closets :)
725347560366305281 2016-04-27 15:35:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thanks for the border otaku pics and that frugal frolicker site! Sleep well :)
725226390371459073 2016-04-27 07:33:40 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay @woohuiren I'm pretty sure his main aim is to go farther, maybe 350km a day with 30 uber fares after these publicity stunts.
725217206338899968 2016-04-26 06:57:10 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay yep, took me a few re-reads to notice what you meant in the original tweet.

724965682689921025 2016-04-26 14:17:42 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish @omgitsjy I know. I wanted to give these poor guys a chance but my old favourite sup kambing is no more. Last visit I guess
724963779063083011 2016-04-26 14:10:08 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish I am snacking at Al-Ameen on the way home after football :)

724855356053180416 2016-04-25 06:59:18 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang only we can choose to believe them. MRT is MRT, PAP is PAP. Why bring opposition into it? Sky not blue must be black meh?
724851165310099456 2016-04-25 06:42:39 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang that's the problem. PAP is PAP. MRT is MRT. Credit where credit is due, no more no less.
724837322932539392 2016-04-25 05:47:39 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb lol what
724805668843089925 2016-04-25 03:41:52 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter just because you're going to wemberley doesn't entitle you to a whole bunch of other delusions!!!
724805421312004098 2016-04-25 03:40:53 UTC <icedwater> @in__flux @hellofrmSG we don't even have space for ourselves! How are we going to build more malls and golf courses?!
724804935519375360 2016-04-25 03:38:57 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah @hellofrmSG the boycott is a little difficult to pull off but there is plenty of other stuff we can do in Singapore. If MRT works.
724765484713840641 2016-04-25 01:02:11 UTC <icedwater> @FacileTalk @TheBudgieTweets @cornblow nah, it should go to a panel who will vote via SMS if the goal was worth the win :)
724602968218030080 2016-04-25 14:16:24 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @ivory_app @hellofrmSG and you think we don't already know that, right...
724598956819247104 2016-04-25 14:00:28 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @ivory_app @hellofrmSG easy to say. How to persuade the voting majority?
724591579462168576 2016-04-25 13:31:09 UTC <icedwater> @eisen still wishing right :p
724584288050548736 2016-04-25 13:02:11 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG East-West      Normal  \_ ()_/ North-South  Normal  \_ ()_/ Circle              Normal  \_ ()_/ LRT Normal \_ ()_/
724579778548781056 2016-04-25 12:44:15 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if the afternoon's heavy rain messed up power for all the lines. It seems like only #DTL didn't get it.
724577878067675136 2016-04-25 12:36:42 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Circle Line failure also. I left the train at Holland Village. Boarded one-north. No reports about that line yet though
724577175555317760 2016-04-25 12:33:55 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats circle line also. Left from Holland Village...
724576608154079232 2016-04-25 12:31:40 UTC <icedwater> @sgelection "return"?

724546045288439808 2016-04-25 10:30:13 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @colinctc @kiampah @hellofrmSG not sure either, thinking out loud. Also, I think people only resign for personal mistakes.
724545575438295040 2016-04-25 10:28:21 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz and still no answer from @TeleFooty about their ranking methods!
724545182058729472 2016-04-25 10:26:47 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @colinctc @kiampah @hellofrmSG sure, but the departing member has to stay on to clean up the mess at reduced wages.
724544886733590528 2016-04-25 10:25:37 UTC <icedwater> @cornblow @TheBudgieTweets there's winning football and there's entertaining football. Ideally they're the same. Anything else isn't needed.
724544429604802560 2016-04-25 10:23:48 UTC <icedwater> I think we can pepper English with terms from the old languages to keep them alive. @WeRWorld @WeAreAustralia
724543284148768768 2016-04-25 10:19:14 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah with enough torchlights into darkness we might yet work something out.
724542704454004736 2016-04-25 10:16:56 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @colinctc @kiampah @hellofrmSG I approve if resignation means serving on till the problem was solved and replacement appointed.
724541903765557248 2016-04-25 10:13:45 UTC <icedwater> @Sabrina0527  @Codecademy 
724509206728962048 2016-04-25 08:03:50 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I wonder if we could exploit that for political change... As long as no innocent lives are lost ;)
724508513754484736 2016-04-25 08:01:05 UTC <icedwater> Wow @aisyahgala are congratulations in order?! The real work begins now! #RowRowRowYourBoat
724410103445655552 2016-04-24 01:30:02 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay I don't think pinkdot is anywhere near a solution, though it might have helped the govt not do silly things...
724392847336595456 2016-04-24 00:21:28 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 it shrinks. But then if you iron it hard enough it stretches back to almost where it was before. I guess that's deja vu?
724281730941636608 2016-04-24 16:59:55 UTC <icedwater> Congratulations @AdamFlinter and @commonlynoun :) It must have been a nervy five added minutes for you!
724245511046189060 2016-04-24 14:36:00 UTC <icedwater> Another evening of watching Arsenal struggle to score. Reminds me of Man Utd, only with better approach play :p

724199545672884224 2016-04-24 11:33:21 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen so I was just thinking out loud. Went to look it up :) http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=its+on+like+donkey+kong
724199112363532292 2016-04-24 11:31:38 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen I get that, I was hoping you knew where it came from :p wait out...
724179928850128897 2016-04-24 10:15:24 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen why is donkey kong on though...
724179487840034817 2016-04-24 10:13:39 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah sounds interesting, where can I get it?
724179017977339904 2016-04-24 10:11:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG apathy about discrimination against migrant workers?
724175569542225920 2016-04-24 09:58:04 UTC <icedwater> @ijneo sorry to have to burst your bubble. It doesn't matter after a while.
724174725585342464 2016-04-24 09:54:43 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen heh. So many levels.
724172040412880898 2016-04-24 09:44:03 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen @SeanMElliott hrm. I found it googling Nathan Walker 1968 Newcastle. There must be a view limit based on the ID in the URL.
724170772902633472 2016-04-24 09:39:01 UTC <icedwater> @SeanMElliott @blackadlerqueen damn. Here's what I found. https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=RuNiCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT143&lpg=PT143&dq=nathan+walker+1968+newcastle

723942995762933761 2016-04-23 18:33:55 UTC <icedwater> @why_vo @hellofrmSG @gnoserif that's fair I suppose. Just remembering the authentic flavour of a closed fish stall at a wet market :)
723881157268381697 2016-04-23 14:28:11 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thanks @abcdpple for the week, and welcome, @RedDot_Oz!
723878852141813760 2016-04-23 14:19:02 UTC <icedwater> @olliMD achso. Ja, hier in Singapur kommt es auch ganz oft vor, dass man Freikarten bekommt oder verlangt. Es kommen sowieso wenig. Schade.
723873366852038656 2016-04-23 13:57:14 UTC <icedwater> Schade! Kopf hoch, VfL!https://twitter.com/VfL_1899/status/723873090049048576

723872246926725120 2016-04-23 13:52:47 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @gnoserif hmm... I wonder how the seafood + meat section in the air-conditioned wet market would smell...
723871936128782336 2016-04-23 13:51:33 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz you will never get it right. And you will always get it right. Just do it :)
723871747376701440 2016-04-23 13:50:48 UTC <icedwater> @gnoserif @hellofrmSG would we see a "Wet Market 3.0" though? Like how hawker centres are supposedly being reinvented...
723870910621437952 2016-04-23 13:47:28 UTC <icedwater> @ComradeTovarich @eisen Like, say, Hirohito, Yamashita, or Syonan-to?

723813328066240512 2016-04-23 09:58:39 UTC <icedwater> @RedDot_Oz @ofmeowandbake @hellofrmSG ahaha is that the phonetic spelling? Cool, always thought of it as "woombedil" from the announcements.
723808122452602884 2016-04-23 09:37:58 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan I've only seen that brand for beer. What else do they do?

723546458037710848 2016-04-22 16:18:13 UTC <icedwater> @IAmJericho high praise but a moron like that wouldn't be able to tell even if it came served to him in cursive in a golden speech balloon.

723369296701739008 2016-04-21 04:34:14 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG not too helpful... But at least no office hours for me tomorrow
723319170104872960 2016-04-21 01:15:03 UTC <icedwater> @shoshofancy @sg_now the alternative would have been to let street stalls continue to run as they were, e.g. Thailand, Vietnam, Macau?
723167432420937730 2016-04-21 15:12:06 UTC <icedwater> @teenicholas I'm not gonna gloat or complain... But #facepalm
723078899920343040 2016-04-21 09:20:18 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname uhm...
722939053776117761 2016-04-20 00:04:36 UTC <icedwater> @TroyEdwards so would I! @SaraBareilles thanks! I'd love to use this as my new ring tone :)
722936689375580160 2016-04-20 23:55:12 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld what would we do without YouTube :)
722935658017267712 2016-04-20 23:51:07 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname morning! Another glass of what? :)
722816769925062657 2016-04-20 15:58:41 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld not really, we sit between speech recognition and speech synthesis. Just the thinking part. But I want to work on synthesis too.
722808385045827584 2016-04-20 15:25:22 UTC <icedwater> @avalon sigh. #hugs

722804291715502084 2016-04-20 15:09:06 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG sometimes too much prep can be a bad thing, as I learned on my first run :p But to each their own :p
722803665422057472 2016-04-20 15:06:37 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I'm a research engineer from Singapore working on dialogue engines. I make computers talk back. Also did this #rocur 3 weeks ago.
722801180020056064 2016-04-20 14:56:44 UTC <icedwater> @PhnomPenhCrown @abearfromSEA maybe @AntoAymard will have a chance to wow Jalan Besar again with bone-crunching tackles ;)
722797159637123072 2016-04-20 14:40:46 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter I think that was the intention behind the final + sign, to be honest.
722795659460390913 2016-04-20 14:34:48 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter it's not about being reputable, Mr. Academic. I wouldn't cite that in most essays either, but just read it.
722795478283214848 2016-04-20 14:34:05 UTC <icedwater> Definite must read for @kopi_js. Cc: @HacksHackersSGhttps://twitter.com/woohuiren/status/722717542368866304
722794476779888640 2016-04-20 14:30:06 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter because I'm lazy, I'm only going to paste this: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LGBTQIA
722794059194982400 2016-04-20 14:28:27 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter and you don't feel your identity?
722793966932926465 2016-04-20 14:28:05 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter I'm not adding anything. I'm legit quoting it. Let me see if I can find a source for you. I've also seen QUILTBAG.
722791878723182592 2016-04-20 14:19:47 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter and what of English speakers in the LGBTQIA+ spectrum? They have to pick one and stick with it?
722789723983327232 2016-04-20 14:11:13 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter sure, so Indians of a third gender don't exist if they speak English.
722761856264175616 2016-04-20 12:20:29 UTC <icedwater> @OffensiveBanter two genders in English, three in German...
722679553013989376 2016-04-19 06:53:26 UTC <icedwater> @ijneo Bernie has eaten more salt than you have rice though, so his supporters must be allowed some :p
722661265731162113 2016-04-19 05:40:46 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism I misread your "add weight to his actions" as "will make future charges more credible".
722660694932471808 2016-04-19 05:38:30 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism yeah.. what I meant was, not all kinds of assault are the same.
722660506314661888 2016-04-19 05:37:45 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism because we already have better access and don't need those laws to help?
722660330233602048 2016-04-19 05:37:03 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism that's the problem.
722660258263482368 2016-04-19 05:36:46 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism yes, it's sexist for example to assume that mothers are always better carers than fathers. But that's unrelated.
722653692579704833 2016-04-19 05:10:41 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism that is irrelevant. There are other power structures unfavourable to men that are not sexism.
722653226928103425 2016-04-19 05:08:50 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism I've never been assaulted in a way that warrants reporting. Fights between classmates at school happen.
722649849431252992 2016-04-19 04:55:24 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism don't conflate rape, molest, sexual harassment as "assault". It's not all the same thing.
722646978883137536 2016-04-19 04:44:00 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism that's the theory, and even then he'd have to accumulate several strikes to be taken seriously.
722646603086094337 2016-04-19 04:42:30 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism obviously I haven't tried it because I'm not a woman. So I said ask a lady. And yes, this *is* fixing in progress.
722646337754423296 2016-04-19 04:41:27 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx visually, yes. Chemically, no.
722645902893125633 2016-04-19 04:39:44 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx actually, if we were to be literal about it, what you see when oil evaporates isn't "smoke".
722645574558883840 2016-04-19 04:38:25 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism ha ha, literally true but completely irrelevant :)
722645082462142464 2016-04-19 04:36:28 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism maybe you should ask a lady who is "part of the problem" what happens if they try to report it.
722644952602320896 2016-04-19 04:35:57 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism I agree that the muslims and oil prices thing is unrelated. But there's no smoke without fire.
722644596904353795 2016-04-19 04:34:32 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism the one that says "you're not going to report me no matter what I do and anyway it would be your word against mine"
722643023511871488 2016-04-19 04:28:17 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism well then it's your prerogative to report it or not.
722642914770362368 2016-04-19 04:27:51 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism that would have been evidence of possible mental deviance, perhaps. But that's not what happened here.
722642763624357889 2016-04-19 04:27:15 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism no, I'm not justifying anything. If men would stop raping, I'm pretty sure you'd see fewer false rape allegations too
722642457134022657 2016-04-19 04:26:02 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism it may not even have been nudity, but sexual harassment is in most cases enabled by a power structure, right...
722641723747409920 2016-04-19 04:23:07 UTC <icedwater> @avalon like this one?
722641406213373957 2016-04-19 04:21:51 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism there wouldn't be any believable false rape allegations if there weren't that many attempts in the first place...
722641181562257408 2016-04-19 04:20:58 UTC <icedwater> @omgitsjy #TYL "knowledge" is not a countable term :p
722639862151700487 2016-04-19 04:15:43 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism alsohttps://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/722426458526732289
722639024364630016 2016-04-19 04:12:24 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism if the two genders had equal perceived power, do you think that that would be as common?
722629543064776705 2016-04-19 03:34:43 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism of course it is. Doesn't mean you can write it off as such. It's creepy regardless of who does it.
722619486763790336 2016-04-19 02:54:45 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG indeed.
722618474556575745 2016-04-19 02:50:44 UTC <icedwater> @Asheswillfall1 do you have to actually borrow a book to treat a library like a library?
722614834664054784 2016-04-19 02:36:16 UTC <icedwater> @Asheswillfall1 if someone looked you in the eyes and masturbated in a bookstore, I would say it is.
722613238953693184 2016-04-19 02:29:56 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism it is discrimination because when it's done, it's consistently done in one direction, man against woman.
722612512772861952 2016-04-19 02:27:03 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx @EverydaySexism "public" sex object? And it's rude/lazy to mental illness sufferers to associate that with potential mental illness.
722611824659566592 2016-04-19 02:24:19 UTC <icedwater> @Asheswillfall1 in her next tweet it was mentioned the man was masturbating while looking her in the eyes. I would consider that interaction
722586766910226432 2016-04-19 00:44:44 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj best to ask them directly for sources.
722586103862013952 2016-04-19 00:42:06 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen eww. Sorry to hear that. In SG?
722585964967649281 2016-04-19 00:41:33 UTC <icedwater> @mawnx I think it is @EverydaySexism when men treat women as public sex objects. You wouldn't do that to your wife, right?

722579412013621248 2016-04-19 00:15:31 UTC <icedwater> @mrbrown I wonder what would happen if people brought up The Slap...
722576253962706944 2016-04-19 00:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah ya also drop most :p Need to download more discipline.
722575510807556096 2016-04-19 00:00:01 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi yup. Hope you slept well :)
722575388019298304 2016-04-19 23:59:31 UTC <icedwater> @ivory_app @sarahcoldheart @lynnylchan #notallsinglish is the same. They're using it like racists use the "one of my best friends is black".
722443136429985794 2016-04-19 15:14:00 UTC <icedwater> @eisen uhm but it hasn't been proven yet ... :p
722442901343461376 2016-04-19 15:13:04 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi that's what we have been brought up to believe..
722441793262866433 2016-04-19 15:08:40 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus I mean, imagine a boy band called 37 degrees. They'd probably only get a lukewarm response...
722440225885061121 2016-04-19 15:02:26 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter *hears russelling of leaves*
722440040316448769 2016-04-19 15:01:42 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish if the objectives are set right it might even be useful... You know how we game systems for KPIs? Agile is KPIs for APIs.
722439397715521536 2016-04-19 14:59:09 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake wah. Then those army boys who had to sing while jogging, that is considered not even moderate ah.
722437828471181313 2016-04-19 14:52:55 UTC <icedwater> @therealeatwood @ohnoNOTFEMINISM well, act-  ...damn, sorry.
722429794520961024 2016-04-19 14:20:59 UTC <icedwater> @ringratonline nice to be able to know who to block even without interacting with them first. Bye :)
722426854020239360 2016-04-19 14:09:18 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart @lynnylchan that's what I believe too, though I don't know if @ivory_app agrees :)
722424574739001344 2016-04-19 14:00:15 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan @sarahcoldheart hmm @ivory_app, I thought based on your profile, anyone who can answer that captcha should be rejected ;)
722416792132423681 2016-04-19 13:29:19 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @singnoname @eisen Dollah Salleh was mentioned there, though, not Dollah Kassim... @FourFourTwoSG know if DK did play there?
722415712564699137 2016-04-19 13:25:02 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @singnoname @eisen from the ST articles I've found in the NLB archives, Dollah played for Burnley United, based in Farrer Park.
722399130207850497 2016-04-19 12:19:08 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @eisen it looks like Dollah was always with Geylang, though.
722387268443344896 2016-04-19 11:32:00 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj I see, so ideally before May 7 la :p
722367281825615872 2016-04-19 10:12:35 UTC <icedwater> @kuekj @eisen I'll let you know if I can find any. What's the project?
722335646673539072 2016-04-19 08:06:53 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA aiyoh, I was thinking of another LTK leh. But this one is also cool.
722335513407922176 2016-04-19 08:06:21 UTC <icedwater> @AusGovGunFacts OK, sorry about the tweets before. I shouldn't assume anything of ranges I hadn't seen. But closing a park is ridiculous.
722333879059632128 2016-04-19 07:59:51 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld rest well! Hope you get better soon. Tweeting can be done later. :)
722325742286016512 2016-04-19 07:27:31 UTC <icedwater> @AusGovGunFacts well, actually, no. But I guess I'm just one of those special snowflakes :)
722314681335975936 2016-04-18 06:43:34 UTC <icedwater> @AusGovGunFacts definitely! We have a military training area that is clearly demarcated so little or no incidents happen. You should learn.
722278209702666240 2016-04-18 04:18:39 UTC <icedwater> @AusGovGunFacts @ShoebridgeMLC which is a designated National Park, right?
722260715025907712 2016-04-18 03:09:08 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah OK. Never stopped to ask them about it myself.
722260336733106176 2016-04-18 03:07:37 UTC <icedwater> @ijneo ....
722259681851224064 2016-04-18 03:05:01 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah hmm but why should active aging be interpreted that way?
722218352618250241 2016-04-18 00:20:48 UTC <icedwater> @ShoebridgeMLC also I like how "you" are "saying" tons of things by just quoting somebody else's article. Typical.
722217988028370945 2016-04-18 00:19:21 UTC <icedwater> @AusGovGunFacts @ShoebridgeMLC it's a park. If it were unguarded forest set aside as buffer for range safety, that'd be another matter.

722209256007569409 2016-04-18 23:44:39 UTC <icedwater> @thelocalrebel thanks also for tweeting in the first place; I didn't want to come off like an ass, but I wasn't sure if quoting was enough.
722107634162098176 2016-04-18 17:00:50 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @yazbanz @abearfromSEA and yet a tactically sound Arion FA beat Warriors 3-2 in a tense battle at Serangoon. Waiting for round two.

722103144457457664 2016-04-18 16:43:00 UTC <icedwater> Good thread folks. Thanks @hellofrmSG for retweeting it. Never really thought about sex ed back then to be honest...https://twitter.com/thelocalrebel/status/720498149647888384
722059069645717505 2016-04-18 13:47:52 UTC <icedwater> OMG. I missed the chance to take a video. But whoever it is who did #ch8drama subtitles just referred to extreme sex as "cosplay" #fb
722058552458682368 2016-04-18 13:45:48 UTC <icedwater> It was indeed, @AdamFlinter. That's great news! Looks like I have more reasons to visit Queenstown Stadium.
721960073220612096 2016-04-18 07:14:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG exactly, so this should only remain relevant until you get in a job, or HR folk focus more on the interview than the resume.
721898418008756224 2016-04-17 03:09:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I agree, but it's mostly the attention of hiring agencies we're trying to catch, right? Or "recognition" wouldn't be a thing.
721877279110877184 2016-04-17 01:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG why are these important factors?

721356176051441665 2016-04-16 15:14:49 UTC <icedwater> @SaraBareilles I love her too. I wonder if she will be coming back to Chandelier City soon #Esplanade
721254179319078913 2016-04-16 08:29:31 UTC <icedwater> @avalon I think we are socialised to ignore or not display emotion so as a natural side effect, men are assholes. Gotta work on that.
721212842641207297 2016-04-15 05:45:15 UTC <icedwater> Something to think about, surely. Is "free-market libertarianism" the only alternative to what we have now?https://twitter.com/SGinDE/status/721009575730655232
721204239742013440 2016-04-15 05:11:04 UTC <icedwater> Let's avoid this Hollywood remake of Ghost in the Shell. I know it's difficult to not watch Scarlet Johansson, but #whitewashing has to end.
721203278063607808 2016-04-15 05:07:15 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv I wonder if it justifies piracy ;) two wrongs don't make a right though.
721201118802419712 2016-04-15 04:58:40 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 @nigelchin @gifcsg I know you're the Eagles... But damn you gotta be really high to say that! ;)
721199447426772992 2016-04-15 04:52:02 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv then let's avoid this film and limit its earnings as far as we can.
721199203154731008 2016-04-15 04:51:03 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv I don't know the full career implications, but from my point of view I would easily say yes. It seems the right thing to do.
721197798494851073 2016-04-15 04:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @avalon I didn't want to use that as an excuse, because what he said is hurtful, but I think it does happen with guys a lot more often.
721183298190315520 2016-04-15 03:47:51 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv sure, the end$ alway$ ju$tify the means.
721181590278119424 2016-04-15 03:41:04 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @abearfromSEA Juventus counted?
721171846394040321 2016-04-15 03:02:21 UTC <icedwater> Thanks @amichetti for RTing this thread. Important to take note of, and I'd wondered similar things myself.https://twitter.com/tauriqmoosa/status/720962004765138948
721171176546893824 2016-04-15 02:59:41 UTC <icedwater> @FakeUnicode @kushaldas oooo. But the last one is a little scary :p
721165804968906754 2016-04-15 02:38:21 UTC <icedwater> @kushaldas find the unicode glyph closest to the twitter bird :p
721162028430151680 2016-04-15 02:23:20 UTC <icedwater> @eisen those who don't learn from (librarians how to reserve books on) history are doomed to repeat it.
721160696092733440 2016-04-15 02:18:03 UTC <icedwater> @avalon sigh. OK. I'm sure he didn't think it through enough.
721154377541496832 2016-04-15 01:52:56 UTC <icedwater> Brilliant news! Vendor equipment is always best. Who needs third-party stuff? Let's lock us into power companies toohttps://twitter.com/newsycombinator/status/720920006830211072
721152884121817088 2016-04-15 01:47:00 UTC <icedwater> @avalon hey what happened? You OK? Sorry, so late... Too far behind on tweets.

721138944797069312 2016-04-15 00:51:37 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv wouldn't it have cost a lot more too? Than, say, to get Rinko Kikuchi to play the lead?
721002326492708864 2016-04-15 15:48:44 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH that's a really mild eulogy you have there, all things considered...
720999459040014336 2016-04-15 15:37:21 UTC <icedwater> @gitlab thanks loads!
720948665225842688 2016-04-15 12:15:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yesterday croiffin commentary already quite #afterdark leh
720937946547761153 2016-04-15 11:32:55 UTC <icedwater> @JaysTheGoat I think that's a separate issue from F&B/service staff not making $15/hour..
720931637123371009 2016-04-15 11:07:51 UTC <icedwater> @leannalikescats so finding nemo is actually the search for forests? Guess it doesn't work that way...
720930666116812800 2016-04-15 11:03:59 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty just have a spinning beach ball belt buckle. Oh ... the *other* kind of safari!
720918059913904128 2016-04-15 10:13:54 UTC <icedwater> @iampinch since you've been gone....
720917110046613504 2016-04-15 10:10:07 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv given the circumstances, ours would be about why do foodcourts have so few halal food stalls
720899898078416896 2016-04-15 09:01:44 UTC <icedwater> @agquarx no
720881659365564416 2016-04-15 07:49:15 UTC <icedwater> @avalon eh I thought FAST should be free what. Let me read again...
720780900967915520 2016-04-14 01:08:52 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c if it can be done during a war, it should be possible in peacetime, right....
720778328278310912 2016-04-14 00:58:39 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy @WeRWorld let's set a date, have regional gatherings and do a Google Hangout or something :) Say... 1st October?
720766758647246848 2016-04-14 00:12:41 UTC <icedwater> Damn. Forgot about the @gitlab CI webinar last night at midnight. Oh well.
720620510367748096 2016-04-14 14:31:32 UTC <icedwater> @AudiKhalid Grammatically correct Singlish is fine too, I prefer that! @audikhalid @avalon
720620122696593408 2016-04-14 14:30:00 UTC <icedwater> It's only size 4 so it isn't quite the real thing, but at least the logo is right? :) #sleaguepic.twitter.com/qnmU47lTK3
720617197005983746 2016-04-14 14:18:22 UTC <icedwater> I wonder if we can ever arrange a @WeRWorld tweetup :)

720439179323117568 2016-04-13 02:31:00 UTC <icedwater> @DCMatthewsNAI @pplofwrestling @NewAgeInsiders crowd reactions. It would be nice to see coherent storylines and stars growing, but hey ;)
720438183507283968 2016-04-13 02:27:02 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @GaryKLH it's always important with rankings to know what in a rank is relevant
720414670083895296 2016-04-13 00:53:36 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen rest well! See you next time maybe :)
720412457403953153 2016-04-13 00:44:49 UTC <icedwater> @stefanikola yup, I was just wondering which would work better for the whole thread. Thanks though :)
720299766031130625 2016-04-13 17:17:01 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname either way, definitely not bearable ones @abearfromSEA
720299453400285185 2016-04-13 17:15:46 UTC <icedwater> @stefanikola hmm. I've been doing that with the last tweet instead, usually...
720298654637002752 2016-04-13 17:12:36 UTC <icedwater> @BoingBoing hope I get around to properly reading that paper! Thanks @hai_ren for RTing.

720297359230443520 2016-04-13 17:07:27 UTC <icedwater> @whufc_official @ManUtd probably never left London, they got stuck on the way out... Maybe they're still at White Hart Lane?
720295006615896064 2016-04-13 16:58:06 UTC <icedwater> @kiampah wah damn hard to vote in the poll. And tough choice also. Anyway I'm 17%.
720291472919044096 2016-04-13 16:44:04 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter ha.
720289301389389825 2016-04-13 16:35:26 UTC <icedwater> @SGfootball only the positives will do eh? #burythenegative
720288151378341888 2016-04-13 16:30:52 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG right now it would be singing lessons from Sara Bareilles... Though I suppose wrestling class from CM Punk would be cool too!
720287663861858305 2016-04-13 16:28:56 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @singnoname I've got nothing against it if it's spontaneous and ground-up. It's labellers trying to confuse that's a problem.
720286923940503552 2016-04-13 16:25:59 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld eh I thought you would claim @hellofrmSG as number 16 ;)

720285230586667009 2016-04-13 16:19:15 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I'm from Singapore, it's about 10 years in the future ;)

719955224970924032 2016-04-12 18:27:56 UTC <icedwater> @avalon does milk or something help? Hope you get better soon. Maybe feline therapy will do the trick...
719935129393635328 2016-04-12 17:08:05 UTC <icedwater> @RealPaigeWWE you do you, miss. We'll support you through and through :)

719911955939495937 2016-04-12 15:36:00 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter imagine if that happens. And then the government bans use of technology after 22.30 :p

719847787500711937 2016-04-12 11:21:01 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan I wonder what happens in Berlin then where the closure period is much shorter.. Are tracks not maintained at all?

719552766725591040 2016-04-11 15:48:42 UTC <icedwater> @prachatai_en is there a missing hyphen? Or is that supposed to be left out of headlines?
719547356690034688 2016-04-11 15:27:13 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname probably the only line I will recognise :p
719545942991446018 2016-04-11 15:21:35 UTC <icedwater> @jakachuuu @hellofrmSG we are trained to be "self-sufficient" and that doesn't help either...
719545529156304896 2016-04-11 15:19:57 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I think I can make it...
719501689187733504 2016-04-11 12:25:45 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan both can :)
719498190517448704 2016-04-11 12:11:50 UTC <icedwater> @lynnylchan can't decide. They're all sugar water to me. :(
719488183604355073 2016-04-11 11:32:05 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue @hellofrmSG I'm just imagining every mixed marriage does it. Singapore would be "100% Chinese", but super diverse. #haxx #ynvrpost
719486801925185537 2016-04-11 11:26:35 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG running is just about the only thing you can do, since barbed wire bats and exploding tables won't stop him...
719485531420135424 2016-04-11 11:21:32 UTC <icedwater> @mryitch reading tweets in Botanic Gardens MRT, sharing unnecessary info on the way home. Using Fenix for Twitter.
719173760520048640 2016-04-10 14:42:40 UTC <icedwater> I think @engrg1 was referring to sec sch admissions, but I think this applies - and is impossible - at all levelshttps://twitter.com/engrg1/status/719162322426535936
719152505720942595 2016-04-10 13:18:13 UTC <icedwater> @engrg1 eww. More points.
719152345016217600 2016-04-10 13:17:34 UTC <icedwater> @avalon go go! #OpSplashIt
719150898941792256 2016-04-10 13:11:50 UTC <icedwater> .@engrg1 indeed. That was my first reaction too. We are already sending kids for all sorts of enrichment programmes...
719149634065543168 2016-04-10 13:06:48 UTC <icedwater> I wonder what #edsg thinks about the planned removal of PSLE T-scores. Do you think parents will just game other admission criteria more?
719148226209718272 2016-04-10 13:01:12 UTC <icedwater> Listening in to #edsg live for the first time... in ages.
719147144700014592 2016-04-10 12:56:55 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG that's because you feel the knead to rise to the challenge.
719144549386354688 2016-04-10 12:46:36 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG of course mah. Few people would post the mess-ups.

719047829222662144 2016-04-09 06:22:16 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'd love to be there too, bakes or no bakes :)

718664700616019968 2016-04-08 04:59:51 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH on the other hand, if you don't promise anything, you always deliver above expectation... Is it wrong to promise too much?
718664375775531009 2016-04-08 04:58:33 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz patience... The Football League is almost 2 centuries old :p
718655033567346688 2016-04-08 04:21:26 UTC <icedwater> @hai_ren groupers...in froyo. Hnnngh
718654802767380480 2016-04-08 04:20:31 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay well then. It's time to... Move swiftly on
718653919962865664 2016-04-08 04:17:01 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay BDFL, yeah. But Python, Linux, and GNU have those too, right?
718517460454866944 2016-04-08 19:14:46 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I think VLC can adjust subtitle delay...
718516075080450048 2016-04-08 19:09:16 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I honestly don't think that fence would trump towers...
718515885535723522 2016-04-08 19:08:31 UTC <icedwater> @kittensarepink it's a good choice of alarm song!

718511877018361856 2016-04-08 18:52:35 UTC <icedwater> @GaryKLH @abearfromSEA you want the title, you have to grind. Attack wins matches, defence wins tournaments.
718509877019037696 2016-04-08 18:44:38 UTC <icedwater> @skchinmayi lol. When are you coming back for Antonio?
718509568704163840 2016-04-08 18:43:25 UTC <icedwater> @ResilienceGirl I'm not convinced either. Abstraction is nice, but something's gotta run all that abstraction...
718507356678586368 2016-04-08 18:34:37 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I suppose this was in response to the Speaker making some gesture to remind him of the time, though he did open with it...
718506242734338049 2016-04-08 18:30:12 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I swear I read Yuki first...
718498375104987136 2016-04-08 17:58:56 UTC <icedwater> @UncleMarty73 @ofmeowandbake there is no excuse, my friend!
718498161359085568 2016-04-08 17:58:05 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen it happens, let's move on, she didn't mean to say what she did, it was her speechwriter, the bigger picture is important...
718496953680592896 2016-04-08 17:53:17 UTC <icedwater> @harishpillay you have BFDLs though.
718496347205214208 2016-04-08 17:50:52 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards commodification of men and "don't let pressure dictate your future"?
718494047422124032 2016-04-08 17:41:44 UTC <icedwater> @urbanexperiment @shimmertje8 I have a DVD of Banting which I bought from Poh Kim, but not every outlet has that. Still worth a try I guess?
718373062379442177 2016-04-08 09:40:59 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy yes or it needs to be trained on that domain.
718369745012174851 2016-04-08 09:27:48 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart I know our dreams will never dieeeee
718369500471693312 2016-04-08 09:26:50 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy did Google Translate not help at all?
718361528353845248 2016-04-08 08:55:09 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter perhaps.
718265858439688192 2016-04-07 02:35:00 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter slightly unrelated, but would it be possible to pay locals enough to get back into construction, though?
718260438186725376 2016-04-07 02:13:27 UTC <icedwater> @ResilienceGirl is this always the case though?
718109909515022336 2016-04-07 16:15:18 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany which means ... You could be the Zodiac Killer!
718101810326573056 2016-04-07 15:43:07 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi what if your future GF works with social media? You'll ditch twitter but watch her use it all day and all night?
717933162815311874 2016-04-06 04:32:59 UTC <icedwater> Retweeting just for the picture ;) time to read the article, thanks @LanguageCrawler!https://twitter.com/LanguageCrawler/status/717715422976548864
717932386466410496 2016-04-06 04:29:54 UTC <icedwater> @davegeographic1 @LanguageCrawler interesting, I haven't learned Esperanto. Could it be, just paying attention to grammar structures helps?
717930120569225217 2016-04-06 04:20:53 UTC <icedwater> Flicker, flicker. I wonder if this Papercast display saves more energy in the long run?pic.twitter.com/o4jEKpWH54

717896559191404545 2016-04-06 02:07:32 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @kuekj "this is why China's Weibo requires just 100 characters for a complete article; Twitter only fits a headline and a link."
717881711720148994 2016-04-06 01:08:32 UTC <icedwater> @WeirdWeb do they, now? That's nice to hear, I suppose.
717776221644263425 2016-04-06 18:09:21 UTC <icedwater> @serenelooys it's a good workout going up, I'd imagine...
717739210266927105 2016-04-06 15:42:17 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards I saw someone that reminded me of you.
717727910887489537 2016-04-06 14:57:23 UTC <icedwater> @bargeboards did you come back from somewhere on a delayed flight?
717718282292187136 2016-04-06 14:19:07 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 not very well, from what I'm hearing...

716427967690190848 2016-04-02 00:51:52 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 damn. It didn't reply to the right tweet. The one with Wolf of Wall Street and 1MDB
716304171150888960 2016-04-02 16:39:57 UTC <icedwater> @MarlboroGoi @kiampah I wonder if we can rebrand Singlish as Singaporean one day though.

716301396023181312 2016-04-02 16:28:55 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld meh. I just lost another army knife at airport security today. It passed one airport fine.
716282525899821056 2016-04-02 15:13:56 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname that would be nice. I'd probably have to go see it on Broadway though.
716253584669577216 2016-04-02 13:18:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG Sara Bareilles at the Esplanade, 1 October 2014. 2015. 2016. Whatever. Never gets old! Waiting for her to return.
716252067279413248 2016-04-02 13:12:54 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy Thanks! I enjoyed myself. Hope @WeRWorld grows steadily :) Haven't seen lots of @1KarenWyld yet, wifi is bad on holiday.
715313537611014144 2016-03-30 23:03:31 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA not me. It was always clear ;)
715085055031255040 2016-03-30 07:55:37 UTC <icedwater> @why_vo thanks. Got NTU postdoc friend project cut, looking for a way to stay in SG

715069295907119104 2016-03-29 06:53:00 UTC <icedwater> Anyone know something about fluid dynamics? What companies might have use for its applications? #askingforafriend
715042669567852544 2016-03-29 05:07:11 UTC <icedwater> @Nero don't see anything wrong with that..
714982384513339392 2016-03-29 01:07:38 UTC <icedwater> @infernoxv I like Clarke Kueh.
714498889663950848 2016-03-28 17:06:24 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c I prefer kiampahbin. Concise.
714497585239576576 2016-03-28 17:01:13 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany how's the rent situation in Bremen? I popped by a few times from Osnabrck but only to walk around a little.
714495234009223169 2016-03-28 16:51:53 UTC <icedwater> @Smark_Twain fair enough. Don't think there will be a more similar pair of cases though, probably close as you can get that's tweeted.
714495187230203904 2016-03-28 16:51:41 UTC <icedwater> @commonlynoun haha just late night lameness setting in. Do what you want, it's your blog :p

714486442823520257 2016-03-28 16:16:57 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz I wonder if we can get that on demand...
714486155970883584 2016-03-28 16:15:48 UTC <icedwater> @Smark_Twain so teachers can't be underwear models? We have nothing to learn from them but what underwear to buy, I suppose...

713942049641209856 2016-03-26 04:13:43 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG that sounds pretty militant hipster to me. Approved.

713891130715168768 2016-03-26 00:51:23 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany enjoy what you have! We don't even have #sleague  fans enough to observe any emotion. So much angst when #BPL teams lose though
713879865926111234 2016-03-26 00:06:37 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 nevertheless that did look like an interesting exhibition. Small importers' congress, or what :p

713734708845088770 2016-03-26 14:29:49 UTC <icedwater> @ohnoNOTFEMINISM I wonder if we can get them to make the name stick #voteyboaty
713725853234892800 2016-03-26 13:54:38 UTC <icedwater> @samhuangxi na, lernst noch Deutsch?
713638166083674112 2016-03-26 08:06:12 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish it's fine, I just don't like it ;) I prefer python. But yeah since php_mysqli came in the old interface will kena downvote.
713519989211287552 2016-03-25 00:16:36 UTC <icedwater> @mary_impraise hmm thanks for sharing. I'm not convinced there will be a precipitous drop though. Maintainers are always needed. @WeRWorld
713519065009008640 2016-03-25 00:12:56 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT I did, twice, and I'm thinking about a PhD so I can teach in college.
713518786599460864 2016-03-25 00:11:49 UTC <icedwater> @hgfiz take a polaroid, snap them, and ask them to autograph it. :p
713507062999683073 2016-03-25 23:25:14 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT just because it hadn't been done doesn't mean it's impossible.
713506884905349121 2016-03-25 23:24:32 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT college needn't cost that much. Not for the students anyway, if the state helps...
713506716692779008 2016-03-25 23:23:52 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT I believe it can be partly achieved. Germany does free college well. Insurance is expensive(?) but medicine is fairly cheap.
713414189654511617 2016-03-25 17:16:12 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish probably for using PHP at all ;)
713408604729008129 2016-03-25 16:54:00 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @nele_lenze @SGmiddleground I suspect the former.
713408474999181312 2016-03-25 16:53:29 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 @hackerspacesg come by again sometime :)
713318599981551616 2016-03-25 10:56:21 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish found you, by the way, nothing much to edit... Why you kena downvote?
713318001328521217 2016-03-25 10:53:58 UTC <icedwater> @GLAiV_Gale it's for a good cause, to promote Boaty McBoatface :) http://www.independent.co.uk/news/a6942551.html
713300141755596801 2016-03-25 09:43:00 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA why is it fait accompli? Didn't Cendol United draw 2-2 or lose narrowly 3-2, or something?
713299925669273600 2016-03-25 09:42:09 UTC <icedwater> @notabilia that's a nice headline. Fittingly cleans up the real Singapore ;)

713272803261153280 2016-03-25 07:54:22 UTC <icedwater> @POZboySG nice. Do you use ad blockers? I am annoyed that songs can be interrupted by ads.
713270680603656192 2016-03-25 07:45:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I just learned of a new song last night when a live band covered it at the bar. Otherwise TV singing competitions.
713270160564457473 2016-03-25 07:43:52 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish hehe we are all noobs. :)

713071828730646528 2016-03-24 18:35:46 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT I'm not informed enough but I think a change would do US good. Can he really do worse than Clinton, Cruz, Kasich, or Trump?
712874616008679428 2016-03-23 05:32:07 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch mach's doch direkt im Balkon
712862347983982593 2016-03-23 04:43:22 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy lol. That's why you started. Ouch. But I was tempted to set up postfix and friends at some point. Where do you even host, MX, etc?
712861383256371202 2016-03-23 04:39:32 UTC <icedwater> @smiffy I'd like to talk about Owncloud and email with you at some point... How did you get started?
712654771019063296 2016-03-23 14:58:32 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA since when you learn Tagalog?

712555884619149313 2016-03-23 08:25:36 UTC <icedwater> By the way, I'll be taking over at @WeRWorld in a few hours. Any requests for topics? @hellofrmSG thanks for the help earlier.
712555445936730112 2016-03-23 08:23:51 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT that's perhaps true. But I suppose he'll just have to do better.
712520065141358593 2016-03-22 06:03:16 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT yes, but that's hardly related to the election issue.
712486904231555072 2016-03-22 03:51:29 UTC <icedwater> @mamajonesT I'm sorry for your loss, but what were they waiting in line for? I'm just trying to understand the relevance here.
712445120843362305 2016-03-22 01:05:28 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG can #asktweeps for me if you weren't planning this for later? "What stereotypes about SG have you heard? How accurate are they?"

712417986024308736 2016-03-22 23:17:38 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold maybe they need someone richer to colonize them first, is what they're really saying ;) @LeaveEUOfficial
712417013092601856 2016-03-22 23:13:46 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany privacy concerns bothered me a lot more than before, and I have a *little* more patience for legalese/long letters.

712415182647988225 2016-03-22 23:06:30 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA yup. Also because the same announcement plays whether you are almost at the platform or three levels up, near the street :p
712312664051941377 2016-03-22 16:19:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG when does it stop being "mispronounced" and start being "local"?
712308303523516416 2016-03-22 16:01:48 UTC <icedwater> Whee. "Last train has departed" announcements begin while the train is there and doors are open. Pragmatic, I guess. Reduces accidents. #dtl

708651721493352448 2016-03-12 13:51:51 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter lol. Don't get hurt watching rugby, you have a stage performance tomorrow!
708650992347131906 2016-03-12 13:48:57 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz @sphererer @KennerveT when is @RainforestSHub next round? April kick-off onz?
708650760771272704 2016-03-12 13:48:02 UTC <icedwater> @BCEmporium @I_amGermany #umettbro
708650167268823043 2016-03-12 13:45:40 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany German Sashimi FTW!!!1!1!!1!
708650007038074883 2016-03-12 13:45:02 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany gonna make a beeline for that next time I'm in town!
708649031585497089 2016-03-12 13:41:09 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake lol
708648388938436608 2016-03-12 13:38:36 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG and how many of those can understand what they're singing? ;) Singing is easier because it's a small set of sounds.
708648056527331329 2016-03-12 13:37:17 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG at least three I dare to claim, English, Chinese, German, though I'm working on the rest. Though only English is in daily use.
708647437422858240 2016-03-12 13:34:49 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG honestly, what about just breaking the line in two, either side of the reserve? Since we've lived without a full Circle so far.
708646759728197633 2016-03-12 13:32:08 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter yup, the best way to limit the damage to the reserve is not to go through it, right....? Let's see the costs for skirting too.
708646438641623040 2016-03-12 13:30:51 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @iamleonwei the assumptions have to be presented. Engineering, nature, finance, all concerns should balance. Fingers crossed.
708645611231248388 2016-03-12 13:27:34 UTC <icedwater> Well @AdamFlinter I'd expect MSM to ask. Whether it gets published in @STcom, @TODAYonline, @ChannelNewsAsia, or not at all, I don't know...
708644971465678853 2016-03-12 13:25:01 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter yup. You have been here for a while, indeed! ;)
708644734479114240 2016-03-12 13:24:05 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG isn't that how life is anyway? You just have to find a balance... And not all "danger" is "life-threatening".
708644435244920832 2016-03-12 13:22:53 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG please do share why it's not a problem!
708644124593750016 2016-03-12 13:21:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @iamleonwei I suspect every time we try to quantify these things, the money wins. Because you can't put a number on nature.
708643873245962240 2016-03-12 13:20:40 UTC <icedwater> @iamleonwei I wholeheartedly agree. @hellofrmSG please find a way to share the concerns with us without breaking confidentiality.
708641357120712706 2016-03-12 13:10:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG rule #2: no matter what you do, someone will be offended. Just do what you have to.
708641126949871616 2016-03-12 13:09:45 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany I'm sure they ship it out here for desperate expats. But it's no weather for Spargel I think.
708620822928175105 2016-03-12 11:49:04 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG why did you sign up to curate?
708619982779723777 2016-03-12 11:45:44 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG welcome @iam_somewhere! Thanks @nicshields for the past week :)
708619056325074945 2016-03-12 11:42:03 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang yup so let's try not to worship the speedometer and get our guys to work on technique first :)
708618455289757696 2016-03-12 11:39:39 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany it's yummy, but I can't be bothered to hunt it down in Singapore :p
708614587818446848 2016-03-12 11:24:17 UTC <icedwater> @visakanv my first reaction was, "is doxxing still always a bad thing?" ... I'm tending to yes, but I'm not so sure.
708608653658443777 2016-03-12 11:00:43 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang speed over elegance. Smart teams counter speed, even if individual players look rubbish. Do BPL successes do well outside?
708475718053679104 2016-03-11 02:12:28 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang please take care of yourself first, there will be other things you can do when you get better. *waves and smiles*
708470109816238081 2016-03-11 01:50:11 UTC <icedwater> @WarriorsSAF @WarriorsFCSG why not just rename?
708323713305870336 2016-03-11 16:08:27 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish hmm not relevant enough leh. If that ad hadn't been about World Cup we would not have been featured either
708323213986500608 2016-03-11 16:06:28 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA that would be Albirex, I think, with their "false-five" defence
708322939662237697 2016-03-11 16:05:23 UTC <icedwater> @SgProWrestling #itubukanandruew
708322797437583360 2016-03-11 16:04:49 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT at the beginning of the season @yglions were unexpected top! Make up your mind! ;)
708322544940482561 2016-03-11 16:03:49 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish no more Germany gambling already leh.
708317054542041090 2016-03-11 15:42:00 UTC <icedwater> @AkiraSakura2 @beingtokyo @atautline now now don't go taking the piss here...
708316085104222208 2016-03-11 15:38:09 UTC <icedwater> Another enjoyable evening with @SgProWrestling. Congratulations Takanashi Masa on picking up the SEA strap from @heelstatement! #fb
708170014642155521 2016-03-10 05:57:43 UTC <icedwater> @blackadlerqueen pity it's hard to convince those with enough purchasing power to afford the flights here and back in the first place...
708128619264999424 2016-03-10 03:13:13 UTC <icedwater> @notabilia @kixes @derekcaiyw not quite foreshadowing, but "mass of data ... conveys much useful information" is quite fitting, I think!
708118137565093888 2016-03-10 02:31:34 UTC <icedwater> @SpongeBob @ofmeowandbake math is nature. Nature is math!
708091839291662336 2016-03-10 00:47:04 UTC <icedwater> @divroyalty 7% agreed.pic.twitter.com/xXYq1RADs7
708086057196068865 2016-03-10 00:24:06 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @ofmeowandbake indeed. But whatever, as long as an @I_W_M reporter gets paid eh? :)
708085881454788610 2016-03-10 00:23:24 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake agreed. The most Asian thing about it was Russia I guess??
708085787036749824 2016-03-10 00:23:01 UTC <icedwater> @I_W_M I think you mean Europe+ almost Asia...
707963596223815680 2016-03-10 16:17:29 UTC <icedwater> @KennerveT also 2nd consecutive 0-0 for Albirex, right?
707962916230668289 2016-03-10 16:14:47 UTC <icedwater> @eisen probably why 2 starts from there too...
707961369698521089 2016-03-10 16:08:38 UTC <icedwater> @FootballSLEAGUE oops...
707814873821003776 2016-03-09 06:26:31 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld it's something I see across all the curations I'm following, a constant search for new curators.
707777040120811521 2016-03-09 03:56:10 UTC <icedwater> @FuzzyLeapfrog muss man die als Pauschal kaufen? Ich wohne ausserhalb DE und brauche Zeit zu planen, aber Interesse habe ich schon.
707733644077457408 2016-03-09 01:03:44 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake if you write such articles, you must have Eu/US privilege ;)
707714874919354368 2016-03-09 23:49:09 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch lern doch was in Sumatra!
707713728955813888 2016-03-09 23:44:36 UTC <icedwater> @SantiMateo thanks for sharing your week!
707712356843806721 2016-03-09 23:39:09 UTC <icedwater> How appropriate. White man in a red background. And the acronym, well, read it as you like ;)https://twitter.com/GlendaChongCNA/status/707514427122196481
707564519501869057 2016-03-09 13:51:42 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch OK, just hot carnivore then, as in you like eating meat hot :p
707564220708028417 2016-03-09 13:50:30 UTC <icedwater> @TODAYonline hmm shouldn't it be 'humourous' though?
707563730469453826 2016-03-09 13:48:33 UTC <icedwater> @renaufdeutsch you should be on the sanely hot carnivore list instead? ;)
707552432381775873 2016-03-09 13:03:40 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake then again I'm sure the kopi o kosong at 7pm must have played a part too :p
707539313530044416 2016-03-09 12:11:32 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake 2 panadol last night, but I seldom take any med so I don't notice if there's a trend
707526613877923840 2016-03-09 11:21:04 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake hmm. That might explain the strange dream I had as well... Not scary, just odd.
707519844879441920 2016-03-09 10:54:10 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue stayed super bright for me, I guess I should have watched it from ground level hmm.
707223239261446144 2016-03-08 15:15:34 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @yazbanz @abearfromSEA whose line is it anyway?
707222591761567744 2016-03-08 15:13:00 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho #supportinconsiderateneighbours #
707222004991066112 2016-03-08 15:10:40 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I didn't think about it much, but I bet if I dig deep enough there will be interesting stories to uncover.
707220712071651329 2016-03-08 15:05:31 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus well then I'd like to read what the other guy said, but obviously there are women who are LGBTQ is my point.
707216613443940353 2016-03-08 14:49:14 UTC <icedwater> @shimmertje8 don't queue. Pack in closer to the doors but give way sensibly. Let those closest the door go in first once alighting is done.
707212649147183104 2016-03-08 14:33:29 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus eh. You mean women cannot be LGBTQ and LGBTQ cannot be women meh. Please.
707210523486498816 2016-03-08 14:25:02 UTC <icedwater> @daveatgeylang should have asked what's up with BPL that makes people who do so well elsewhere look like rubbish.
707160658610036736 2016-03-08 11:06:54 UTC <icedwater> @ZymPrincess o zap.
707155034971066368 2016-03-08 10:44:33 UTC <icedwater> It's not sensible to stand in a straight line if it goes past the middle of the platform and blocks escalators. #fbpic.twitter.com/4zpE4sEEzt
706743947578593280 2016-03-06 07:31:02 UTC <icedwater> @halalSG where would we buy halal meat if we wanted to?https://twitter.com/ofmeowandbake/status/706685923354804224
706743615343579138 2016-03-06 07:29:43 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake I think it's just something we don't notice enough, like "every food court sure got halal food right?" I hope so though.
706659883966312448 2016-03-06 01:57:00 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG willingness to engage and impervious to subtweets? I'm thinking about it myself ahead of my stint at @WeRWorld soon...
706659421162569729 2016-03-06 01:55:09 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theentertainerme.entertainer think there should be one for iOS too :)
706658938377236480 2016-03-06 01:53:14 UTC <icedwater> @theregos absolute no-no. You have to bankrupt yourself on the first date to impress. #modernlife
706540003728297986 2016-03-06 18:00:38 UTC <icedwater> @gweezilla @hellofrmSG eh, crazy is that word one meh..
706539229367537664 2016-03-06 17:57:33 UTC <icedwater> @kerstinhammes @I_amGermany fill in some forms twice and wait in line at the wrong office to submit them...

705755385446051840 2016-03-04 14:02:50 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname I'm out then, next time!
705754896096587776 2016-03-04 14:00:54 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG might turn up then maybe. What time is it again?
705753506838261762 2016-03-04 13:55:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG #hugs could have gone to the tweetup I guess?

705648138665603073 2016-03-03 06:56:41 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname not like you'd be voting for anyone anyway... :p
705437767744925696 2016-03-03 17:00:44 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @abearfromSEA just new boreders, as in where bears are past tense :)
705367752727355392 2016-03-03 12:22:32 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb not yours, did you link one?
705358931820851200 2016-03-03 11:47:28 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb uh, so 15 minutes of diving alone, huh. Putting the ball out of play and arguing over freekick distances are acceptable?!
705287332182667264 2016-03-02 07:02:58 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb 70 is a lot you know. I thought the average in Asia was 52. http://sport-asia.com/football-afc-launches-60-minutes-campaign-to-reduce-time-wasting/
705216611297267712 2016-03-02 02:21:57 UTC <icedwater> @HomeUtdFC the last guy to say something like that was Madhu Mohana... :p
705195526262644737 2016-03-02 00:58:10 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld y por que no? :p
705193007671185408 2016-03-02 00:48:09 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld beef, football, and tango, off the top of my head... I'd like to visit! Apparently there's a community with Italian ancestry?
705057965926055936 2016-03-02 15:51:33 UTC <icedwater> @WeirdWeb I'll check.
705057298964549632 2016-03-02 15:48:54 UTC <icedwater> @halleluyang enjoy the snow, it's one thing I've missed about Germany. I believe you're in the same latitude I was; does it snow often?
705047598181158913 2016-03-02 15:10:21 UTC <icedwater> @nianymue at least match point!
705047502857203713 2016-03-02 15:09:58 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm out of space for books, hoarding too much stuff :p
705047322875461632 2016-03-02 15:09:15 UTC <icedwater> @WeirdWeb have you got it yet? I can ask around... Which book and which library?
705047026979876864 2016-03-02 15:08:05 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I'm going to get Sara Bareilles' Sounds Like Me. But from the library first, if I can...
705015454222290944 2016-03-02 13:02:37 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname world wall lll then...

705010738998308864 2016-03-02 12:43:53 UTC <icedwater> @C64Tone yup also @SgProWrestling ;)
705008072276611073 2016-03-02 12:33:17 UTC <icedwater> @flatbreads also, to be quite honest, I don't think I know >2500 glyphs, after using the language for over 30 years. I'll try to enumerate?!
704998212369666048 2016-03-02 11:54:06 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter what about long walks on the beach and Singapore Pro Wrestling? ;)
704997565888991232 2016-03-02 11:51:32 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter @ladystormhold I suppose so...
704997153890906112 2016-03-02 11:49:54 UTC <icedwater> @necropants @kosherjellyfish oops, forgot the quotes.
704993944556285952 2016-03-02 11:37:09 UTC <icedwater> @flatbreads you memorise a few until you realise there is a system. Yeah, my first language is English too, but I started memory work early.
704993528716242944 2016-03-02 11:35:30 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname hmm. If Trump's States of America (TSA, ha) launch WW3, they might actually win...
704900343835041793 2016-03-01 05:25:13 UTC <icedwater> @kixes @notabilia i hope the bid stops at one, no Trump!
704891367336615936 2016-03-01 04:49:32 UTC <icedwater> @rennardho what are you basing this claim on? Certainly not the Super Tuesday results...
704832610447466496 2016-03-01 00:56:04 UTC <icedwater> @halfwrittentale you have the best words!
704828203416727552 2016-03-01 00:38:33 UTC <icedwater> @realDonaldTrump nobody plays minesweeper and expects squares around a mine to provide clues about how many are in the vicinity.
704814622755323904 2016-03-01 23:44:35 UTC <icedwater> @flatbreads @I_amGermany @deutschbitte hey! Chinese is easy... OK, maybe I'm biased. ;) But learning all languages starts with memorization.
704812915170226176 2016-03-01 23:37:48 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany @renaufdeutsch then again, he is German, isn't he? Native speakers get used to the rules a lot faster.
704697724638089216 2016-03-01 16:00:04 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany I think it is difficult, what with scary combinedalmostasentencewords, but if you deal with them in bits it helps.
704697107467210752 2016-03-01 15:57:37 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany looking forward to more responses when I wake up :)
704696928068456449 2016-03-01 15:56:54 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany oops :p
704692317177839616 2016-03-01 15:38:35 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany I've found being able to speak relatively fluent German helps them not look at you funny. Warded off "chingchong" treatment.

703872437063036929 2016-02-28 09:20:40 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld I've not used it that much, to be honest! Sometimes I suspect I'm not Singaporean myself :p Do you visit often?

703801785773748224 2016-02-27 04:39:56 UTC <icedwater> @HougangUnited I wish people would stop using 'GUSTY' rather than 'GUTSY'. One is a lot of gas, the other courage. Not always the same.
703798430355759104 2016-02-27 04:26:36 UTC <icedwater> @nisa9 agreed, but Penang is SO. FAR. NORTH. *flies to Japan instead* lol @WeRWorld
703798265611886592 2016-02-27 04:25:57 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld only a day? That's how we know you're not Singaporean ;) Sounds like you had quite a good local spread!

703569542950170625 2016-02-27 13:17:05 UTC <icedwater> @ALB_S_FC Looks like @FCBalestier are the first side to take points off the @alb_s_fc White Swans this season... #sleaguehttps://twitter.com/FootballSLEAGUE/status/703568967823036416
703568070250377216 2016-02-27 13:11:14 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld indeed. When I brought friends from Sydney round recently, most of our day together was eating and walking. What did you eat here?
703567529294204928 2016-02-27 13:09:05 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld these days from my account, but I used to do it for a news site. The global kind. I grew up a Man Utd fan, cooled off somewhat.
703566233837277185 2016-02-27 13:03:56 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG thanks for the week! Hope to see you again on the rocur :)
703563060288446465 2016-02-27 12:51:19 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld ah, tone and content then. Yeah some people are just letting their inner snark out. I do like the odd "don't do it nooo" though.

703554250014482432 2016-02-27 12:16:19 UTC <icedwater> @singnoname @hellofrmSG which of course doesn't preclude the government from creating a strawberry-conducive environment.
703406004860428288 2016-02-26 02:27:14 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld is it the spam of live tweeting that you don't like, or the subject matter? I'm curious because I live-tweet football matches.
703405230407323648 2016-02-26 02:24:10 UTC <icedwater> @WeRWorld it's from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity where being plastic refers to the ability to be moulded.
703368811269873664 2016-02-26 23:59:27 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual wouldn't some Americans genetically be the same as English, though?
703257917684723712 2016-02-26 16:38:48 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA still English, I'm assuming.

703032909519724544 2016-02-25 01:44:42 UTC <icedwater> The soft click of the lock spelled freedom. She slipped into old clothes, then out into the sunlight. She'd been home for too long. #LogiVSS
703031680722796544 2016-02-25 01:39:49 UTC <icedwater> The last tumbler clicked into place. It had taken her whole sentence. "Trying to break out, eh?  Another year for you." She sighed. #LogiVSS
702889165365489664 2016-02-25 16:13:30 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus wish I could help there but I'm quite bad at that too. Gotta try anyway. :)
702880110295134208 2016-02-25 15:37:31 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I've got 12GB, though I wonder if 3G is good enough for a reliable audio stream.
702878909356855298 2016-02-25 15:32:45 UTC <icedwater> @yazbanz it's actually me in both, mirror image with some filters, you know :'D
702876912260001792 2016-02-25 15:24:49 UTC <icedwater> @CSExodus hugs. It's tough to give  out so many, especially when you get so few in return. Keep some for yourself, does that work?
702872149560655873 2016-02-25 15:05:53 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yup! Toa Payoh, Hougang, Choa Chu Kang, Bishan, Jurong East, Jurong West, Bedok, and Jalan Besar.

702824849383641088 2016-02-25 11:57:56 UTC <icedwater> @kosherjellyfish don't do it. Cloud storage is just someone else letting you use their hard disk. I use Dropbox and GDrive minimally.
702824490946801664 2016-02-25 11:56:31 UTC <icedwater> @dazhan14 I don't see that this has anything to do with the fans...

702677005607653376 2016-02-24 02:10:27 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold @hellofrmSG clear conscience, yes, you could be talking about puppies and mooncakes, but why does anyone else need to see?
702676796517384192 2016-02-24 02:09:38 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG @shimmertje8 @ladystormhold I think Singaporeans are used to not having privacy. Want my NRIC? HP/email? OK. My 5% discount pls.
702673491837865984 2016-02-24 01:56:30 UTC <icedwater> @abearfromSEA @yazbanz @padangbolasepak he meant "you're tired" but there was autocorrect

702520398492008452 2016-02-24 15:48:09 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG have to check what my first tweets were, back in Feb 2009, but they were not about breakfast or shoelaces, I'm pretty sure...
702520006819459072 2016-02-24 15:46:36 UTC <icedwater> @wpsg it's ETPL, by the way, and using patents as a metric is counterproductive I feel: more is good but not all innovation can be patented.
702519128301568000 2016-02-24 15:43:07 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG yeah it was pretty good when it did work, though!
702518689573154818 2016-02-24 15:41:22 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG #riskybus was a fun trivia channel, and then there were the class and school channels...
702518511046791168 2016-02-24 15:40:39 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG IRC can be pretty important to me at work sometimes. No more galaxynet stuff though :(
702517895297826817 2016-02-24 15:38:13 UTC <icedwater> @JakartaCasual guess that means Warriors are up the creek with a coach that couldn't pick Geylang off the floor...

702340141604425729 2016-02-23 03:51:53 UTC <icedwater> @ladystormhold actually I wonder how much that cost will go up by if we added 3 stations in those 5km. And the construction impact too..
702310079580639232 2016-02-23 01:52:25 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG I remember scraping chalk off rocks at Catholic High's new location in 1992 to run my shoe-cleaning business. #schoolyardfun

702293233322192898 2016-02-23 00:45:29 UTC <icedwater> @stressaholic I agree, and I see no need for a gun myself, but that's a separate issue. @TheBriefing2016
702176654563540994 2016-02-23 17:02:14 UTC <icedwater> @ShunfuMart that was true up to last season :p It seems the thousands are thronging back, though I'm yet to see firsthand. @ofmeowandbake
702172841802756096 2016-02-23 16:47:05 UTC <icedwater> @TheBriefing2016 @stressaholic uhm. Why should gun makers be in any trouble for making the guns? It's the shooter who is responsible.
702168591630602240 2016-02-23 16:30:12 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG did you read all the Xanth stuff from Piers Anthony? That was fun, though I do want to read Adept again... And Incarnations too.

701934866288418816 2016-02-22 01:01:28 UTC <icedwater> @sleaguepipebomb well, they do play cricket at Old Trafford...
701934560137728001 2016-02-22 01:00:15 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG however, when critical thinking is needed at Uni, template learning at JC is hardly the best preparation.
701934328377282560 2016-02-22 00:59:19 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter eww. I'm sorry to hear that.

701931809467011073 2016-02-22 00:49:19 UTC <icedwater> @hellofrmSG that's odd. I found out about my friend's passing via a Chinese newspaper.
701927325433106432 2016-02-22 00:31:30 UTC <icedwater> @ofmeowandbake anything would benefit from becoming more interactive and involving the learner better, I suppose. Gonna try those cases?

701261789808361472 2016-02-20 04:26:54 UTC <icedwater> @kixes why not make Singapore families desperately poor instead? It's better for the bottom line and probably already half done ;)

692385080736505856 2016-01-27 16:34:01 UTC <icedwater> @climagic darn me and my 3-day backlog :p
692384264625786880 2016-01-27 16:30:47 UTC <icedwater> @climagic does it not just do 3000-3004, 3010-3014, ..., 3444, etc?

691183557419487232 2016-01-24 08:59:36 UTC <icedwater> @liangkaixin but yeah, $7.50 is pretty steep. Though I'm also not sure how much the filling costs...
691183319107526658 2016-01-24 08:58:39 UTC <icedwater> @liangkaixin maybe we make it more popular and the prices might drop when competition comes in :p Disclosure: my friend owns Flavour Flings.
691156823915638784 2016-01-23 07:13:22 UTC <icedwater> @FastCompany @debsho22 so it is. Well done Mr. Scalin :)
691156471854149632 2016-01-23 07:11:58 UTC <icedwater> @FastCompany @debsho22 I wonder if it's intentional that there is no brain...

691119200014721024 2016-01-23 04:43:52 UTC <icedwater> @AdamFlinter I'm surprised we haven't more West Ham fans here, given that we're forever blowing bubbles...
691118952391389184 2016-01-23 04:42:53 UTC <icedwater> @ejames_c hmm, aren't they complementary goals though? Is the difference in approach the issue?
691118541534289920 2016-01-23 04:41:15 UTC <icedwater> @sarahcoldheart @x_ai yeah it's not mind blowing unless a white person comes up with it ;)
691114867722301440 2016-01-23 04:26:39 UTC <icedwater> @pennant83 love the emojis. When will they see that it's a horribly inappropriate fitness test for football...

691112527732682752 2016-01-23 04:17:21 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat yeah true.
691101187903369216 2016-01-23 03:32:17 UTC <icedwater> @tengkiat was it a big business? I think it's just cost management. Plus the communication / publicity channels are built in. I guess.
691100737653223424 2016-01-23 03:30:30 UTC <icedwater> @I_amGermany ooh, I thought it was a new feature the Americans brought over when they occupied, but that makes more sense :)
