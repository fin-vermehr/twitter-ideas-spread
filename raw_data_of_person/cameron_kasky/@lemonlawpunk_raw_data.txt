972151693524783104 2018-03-09 16:46:40 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @fema @RepTenney @ABrindisiNY ^ man, these bots dont even try to hide it anymore do they?
971793909826379777 2018-03-08 17:04:57 UTC <lemonlawpunk> Gears of War 4 is a lot like Godfather 3. Just when you thought you were out, they pull you right back in. #StupidAchievements
971790163734089728 2018-03-08 16:50:04 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney There should be 10,000 women commenting on this Affirmative Action - ya know, = pay for = work, but where are they? Being a gop woman is like saying youre a FemNazi. NOT pro choice, NOT for = pay. NOT for Gov FHP. Talk about giving all old white men $ & power. Youre a joke.
971788671350341632 2018-03-08 16:44:08 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney Good women dont let bad men physically assault innocent women, and then protect said man, without listening to assaulted women.

971073403695304704 2018-03-06 17:21:55 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney - You actually called fake news on something you clearly said on the radio. https://www.yahoo.com/news/apos-apos-fake-news-apos-222116211.html Youve taken a deep step into batshit crazy lady. Youre the next Sam Nunberg

969002356632416257 2018-02-28 00:12:19 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 - You guys are awesome. We wrote this one 12 years ago before the VA tech shootings. Heartbreaking every time. You kids are finally making a difference. #Proudhttps://lemonlaw.bandcamp.com/track/trigger-happy
969001229719351297 2018-02-28 00:07:50 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @Emma4Change Man, these crooks never want to admit that guns are the problem. Doesnt matter how many facts you throw at them. Their precious donations matter more.
968935904726437889 2018-02-28 19:48:16 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @NRA @DICKS The same wackos that do this shit, go to gun shows, ya know - the place where 13 year olds can buy assault weapons, without any question or receipt.
968921395160928257 2018-02-28 18:50:36 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney Robin Hood in reverse. Get your god out of politics. Separation of church and state! #onetermtenney

966695373497622528 2018-02-22 15:25:12 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @realDonaldTrump Remember, its not a gun problem, its an ammo problem.https://lemonlaw.bandcamp.com/track/trigger-happy
966689672431796224 2018-02-22 15:02:32 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @Twitter So out of the 700 on here, how many of you are really dirty Russians? @twitter that should be a new feature on all social platforms. 500 followers 200 DRs (dirty Russians)
966686384974127104 2018-02-22 14:49:28 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney Meanwhile the rich just got a whole lot richer $$      you dont give a shit about this area. Youre a disgrace to women. Youre a disgrace to CNYers. You could have been a powerful voice in a time of turmoil, and you chose the wrong side of history lady. #OneTermTenney
966680895435485184 2018-02-22 14:27:40 UTC <lemonlawpunk> @RepTenney - Brindisi is going to beat you baaaaadddddd come this November. Why defend the NRA when they barely gave you $50k? Rubio got $3 Mil. Also you look haggard now, one year in office has aged you 10 years. #ugly #sad
