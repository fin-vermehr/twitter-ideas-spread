883060707192967168 2017-07-06 20:30:53 UTC <blakebenson42> @YouFoundSam_RBX @ioozi_ Then there's people who treat others as in equal and who think that they are superior due to their color or even gender. That's wrong.
883060480469872640 2017-07-06 20:29:59 UTC <blakebenson42> @YouFoundSam_RBX @ioozi_ Like your against same sex marriage which is whatever that's your belief which I dont understand but that's okay.

808899827207733248 2016-12-13 05:02:02 UTC <blakebenson42> @CoFemale Where is your evidence? If Trump had high approval ratings you would be in full support.
808899426794213378 2016-12-13 05:00:26 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale I get my news from a wide range. Just avoid FOX news and you should be fine.
808898917828067328 2016-12-13 04:58:25 UTC <blakebenson42> @CoFemale I think people just realized how progress he made.

808897733683802112 2016-12-13 04:53:42 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale There are multiple polls taken though. That's why I included a range.

808896830473981956 2016-12-13 04:50:07 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Obama's Approval rate is at 52-56%.

808896075545407490 2016-12-13 04:47:07 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale There is also no debate over our economy being healthier than what it was in 09'.
808895896868024320 2016-12-13 04:46:25 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Agree. However we have made tremendous progress compared to what America was in 09'.
808895734040973312 2016-12-13 04:45:46 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Trump has been to nowhere near the countries that Obama and Hillary has. No debate there.
808895535453237248 2016-12-13 04:44:58 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Look up American approval rating before and after obama. No delusions, just fact!
808895374735900673 2016-12-13 04:44:20 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale We have made a lot of progress compared to losing 800k jobs a month in 09', don't you agree?
808894878230908929 2016-12-13 04:42:22 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale @callofwild I agree he had too. It's the fact that Putin has personally given him awards.

808894348070973440 2016-12-13 04:40:15 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale That is correct. I agree with you there, however politicians travel more
808894037579145217 2016-12-13 04:39:01 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale I don't consider that to be true. Economy runs better under democrats. Democrats are forward thinkers.

808893291815124992 2016-12-13 04:36:03 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale He has mentioned draining the swamp however he has been appointing people that make me skeptical.
808892944560390144 2016-12-13 04:34:41 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Democrats aren't the problem in government. Both sides need to start coming together more.
808892507551625217 2016-12-13 04:32:56 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale For a short while we were actually neutral with Russia back in 2012-2013. Before Crimea.

808891330680258560 2016-12-13 04:28:16 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale He made it clear that he meant lobbyists, special interests, and Wall Street.
808891126384050183 2016-12-13 04:27:27 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale What exact connections are you talking about with Obama? If he had connections why wouldn't relations be better?
808890973279440901 2016-12-13 04:26:51 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Putin has personally given him awards such as one of friendship.
808890681641017344 2016-12-13 04:25:41 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale (2) Trump sure is doing a great job building up the swamp he wanted to get rid of.
808890571796398080 2016-12-13 04:25:15 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale Obama is out of office in one month and Hillary won't be in office. They are Irrelevant. (1)
808888514540666884 2016-12-13 04:17:04 UTC <blakebenson42> @seanhannity @CoFemale so his connections with Russia don't set off any alarms?

805455858117263360 2016-12-04 16:56:55 UTC <blakebenson42> @BernieSanders @jussfroggie wrong.
805300080278437888 2016-12-03 06:37:55 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 I was asking for clarification.

805299564324458496 2016-12-03 06:35:52 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 Do you mean illegal Mexicans or Illegals and Mexicans?
805299257183965184 2016-12-03 06:34:39 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 did I ever say "Trump's not my president"?
805298392230481920 2016-12-03 06:31:13 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 Calling humans animals isn't something you should go around doing.
805297449829023744 2016-12-03 06:27:28 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 democratic socialism is social programs and more for the working class while having that capitalist style economy.
805297272170876928 2016-12-03 06:26:46 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 I don't think you get what democratic socialism is but that's okay!
805296555175579648 2016-12-03 06:23:55 UTC <blakebenson42> @MuellerChef1 well being a Democracy has really nothing to do with the economy. Have a democracy means you have a democratic government.

803382573116354561 2016-11-28 23:38:26 UTC <blakebenson42> @DimitriNosarev You think he is a full on socialist. That's the problem.

803349917590781952 2016-11-28 21:28:40 UTC <blakebenson42> @DimitriNosarev You clearly don't know what Bernie stands for if you call him a full socialist. Do some research.
