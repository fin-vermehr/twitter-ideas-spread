971133203233886208 2018-03-06 21:19:33 UTC <karen_grand1> @thehill @Katie_Kate81
971101474943008768 2018-03-06 19:13:28 UTC <karen_grand1> @chelseahandler You couldn't be more correct with that statement. That's about how twisted this administration operates.
971100637713846273 2018-03-06 19:10:08 UTC <karen_grand1> #FireConway better late than never. It needs done.

He wants to be one so bad but he was barely a D list celebrity. He will be know as the President with the lowest ratings although Im sure he will claim #FakeNews
970914602820268032 2018-03-05 06:50:54 UTC <karen_grand1> @TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber Great interview. But..... wow, unbelievable!

967099992967086081 2018-02-23 18:13:00 UTC <karen_grand1> @Katie_Kate81 Although #damnDana left before I became an official member

965447939001810945 2018-02-18 04:48:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Are you watching tv and eating cheeseburgers in bed again?
965288768478605312 2018-02-18 18:15:51 UTC <karen_grand1> Is that fu%#*^ still tweeting?? @realDonaldTrump   Dont you have something better to do, a porn star to screw, something....... ?
965233842834608128 2018-02-18 14:37:35 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Youre talking about self control?
965233638865502208 2018-02-18 14:36:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump You said Putin told you he didnt do it and you believed him
964662063544127488 2018-02-16 00:45:33 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe we can talk about the porn stars he screwed while he was married instead. 
964543395761975297 2018-02-16 16:54:00 UTC <karen_grand1> @TheWeirdWorld 
963996604486307841 2018-02-14 04:41:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @enews I dont believe it for a minute. He would have told this story before. They hated each other on that show. No way this happened.

963928563605962752 2018-02-14 00:10:53 UTC <karen_grand1> @Acosta @MarkMs126511 They can say something. They usually say they dont know all the facts to avoid answering questions.
963884097738330114 2018-02-14 21:14:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @Acosta Why not have a briefing about the shooting? Wtf!!! Probably because those people know absolutely nothing about answering a question. They only answer what they have rehearsed.
963603846877597697 2018-02-13 02:40:34 UTC <karen_grand1> @Katie_Kate81 Im going with no

963595868288020480 2018-02-13 02:08:52 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe he mentioned him to mother
963143470868193280 2018-02-12 20:11:12 UTC <karen_grand1> @FoxNews Im also glad it was nothing serious.
963143341306195968 2018-02-12 20:10:41 UTC <karen_grand1> @FoxNews Unfortunately, I wouldnt be surprised if somebody associated with them sent it just to be dramatic and blame democrats..... Because thats absolutely something they would do

Instagram for the memes, pics of my dogs. I do follow a lot of political/news pages and I find people are more ruthless on IG.

951825484802871301 2018-01-12 14:37:34 UTC <karen_grand1> @JuddLegum Of course he will claim fake news and his followers will believe him.
951825268418727937 2018-01-12 14:36:42 UTC <karen_grand1> @AliVelshi Either he is straight up lying and knows hes lying. Or he has dementia. 
951822640355905537 2018-01-12 14:26:16 UTC <karen_grand1> @piersmorgan One thing that makes you different than most of his supporters. You dont blindly follow whatever he says. @realDonaldTrump needs to called out when he goes this far off the rails.
951816910622085125 2018-01-12 14:03:30 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Took you all night to think of that response?   Yes, absolutely record all meetings. That way when you claim fake news there will be evidence.

935157109108498432 2017-11-27 14:43:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Youre right. He probably says hes working every day but hes really on Twitter. Reminds me of a Seinfeld episode.  Kramer carries a briefcase to work and the only thing inside is crackers...
935154899314147328 2017-11-27 14:34:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump The fact that a lot of these comments are people actually debating CNN vs FOX news is unbelievable...how about the fact that your President is even tweeting about it

910316783550201862 2017-09-19 01:36:48 UTC <karen_grand1> @AshleyFetters Sounds so familiar. Hey maybe they have "personal problems" we don't know about 
910192498311680000 2017-09-19 17:22:56 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Big speech..oohhh can barely contain my excitement.....you are the worst of the worst. An embarrassment to our country.
909754612143575041 2017-09-18 12:22:56 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics @dbdppl Yeah. That was my point....you missed it. He tries to get HER fired but he can be a gross pig and say/do what he wants.
909609387492245504 2017-09-17 02:45:52 UTC <karen_grand1> @thehill I'll be there! Wine it is!!
909592679637487616 2017-09-17 01:39:28 UTC <karen_grand1> Love that!!
909536114662416384 2017-09-17 21:54:42 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Wow. Maybe he should be fired....wish it was that easy....he needs to go....
909481511627444225 2017-09-17 18:17:44 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @IvankaTrump @RVAwonk @SRuhle But heaven forbid an ESPN newscaster call poor little Trump a name!!
909030487599075329 2017-09-16 12:25:31 UTC <karen_grand1> @Travon @JuliusGoat @EatYourCandy @Scherlis Not necessarily.
908871823386923008 2017-09-15 01:55:03 UTC <karen_grand1> @Travon @JuliusGoat Or whatever it was...not an awards show watcher...
908871659498672128 2017-09-15 01:54:24 UTC <karen_grand1> @Travon @JuliusGoat I agree with you if your argument was black vs white. Just didn't understand why the Emmy had any bearing on the situation.
908868322325909505 2017-09-15 01:41:08 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @CaitrionaPerry 
908868022504497152 2017-09-15 01:39:57 UTC <karen_grand1> @CaitrionaPerry I'm sure you mean @realDonaldTrump ? He's very strange indeed. Awkward, strange, annoying....
908867742861860865 2017-09-15 01:38:50 UTC <karen_grand1> @JuliusGoat @Travon Why does it matter that you're carrying an award? That make you special?
908867082615427072 2017-09-15 01:36:13 UTC <karen_grand1> @CaitrionaPerry I'm more affectionate than him...and you know me!!! I hate hugging people. But seriously 
908866459530612736 2017-09-15 01:33:44 UTC <karen_grand1> @CaitrionaPerry You're right..so awkward.
906583724711694336 2017-09-09 18:22:58 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Maybe he can follow you to prison. Maybe you want to sign to the guy in the next cell....
905771886235312133 2017-09-07 12:37:00 UTC <karen_grand1> 
904400476397080577 2017-09-03 17:47:31 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump How about you discuss this somewhere else other than twitter? 
903822699612516356 2017-09-01 03:31:38 UTC <karen_grand1> @Beyonce @HITEXECUTIVE @KathrynCiviello
903822117686435840 2017-09-01 03:29:19 UTC <karen_grand1> @thehill I definitely believe he won't donate either.
903785020690755589 2017-09-01 01:01:55 UTC <karen_grand1> Can you even imagine? She was doing what was right for her pt...that's her job. It's her duty to protect her patients. So unreal.
903781576965808128 2017-09-01 00:48:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @timothycsimons I need to watch this. I know you keep telling me how awesome it is.
903645572049100801 2017-09-01 15:47:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @NBCNews Unfortunately people think it's ok to treat health care professionals this way. Family members and patients are abusive now law enforcement?
902974617215782913 2017-08-30 19:21:39 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @PickelGeuse Well,I hope this boosted his sales...  Unreal....
902914211138949121 2017-08-30 15:21:37 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Don't forget your MAGA hat for the photo op....
900198525513998338 2017-08-22 03:30:28 UTC <karen_grand1> @ChelseaClinton @FLOTUS Instead bully adults like @POTUS does every day.
900198389819867136 2017-08-22 03:29:55 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics @POTUS you are not building a damn wall.
900198155442159616 2017-08-22 03:28:59 UTC <karen_grand1> @PhilipRucker They are too stupid to know he's lying.
900197473825828865 2017-08-22 03:26:17 UTC <karen_grand1> @AnnCoulter You are queen of the swamp...where is your crown?
900151235751399424 2017-08-22 00:22:33 UTC <karen_grand1> @scottbarkley_24 I WAS at the Honda shop today....but hell no I wouldn't dive that piece of crap 
900112379836551172 2017-08-22 21:48:09 UTC <karen_grand1> @TheWeirdWorld @KathrynCiviello sounds like your kids...
900110464612433922 2017-08-22 21:40:32 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine Where's your boyfriend @realDonaldTrump
898691529232982016 2017-08-18 23:42:12 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNN @seanhannity Tell us how you really feel...you mad
898691007805390848 2017-08-18 23:40:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @weeklystandard @realDonaldTrump @JoyAnnReid Nope. He does not.
898690790762872832 2017-08-18 23:39:16 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Your point?
898616170185506816 2017-08-18 18:42:45 UTC <karen_grand1> @IvankaTrump I'll be praying your father gets the hint and resigns as President.
896474330791596033 2017-08-12 20:51:50 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke If it was a victory why are you crying? #snowflake.
896474174109208576 2017-08-12 20:51:13 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke Free speech is one thing. You were all about violence today. Don't get it twisted #snowflake
896473681261735937 2017-08-12 20:49:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke #snowflake.
896473571425361921 2017-08-12 20:48:49 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke You mean more extreme than the violence from today?? Are you f'n serious? Put down the pipe ...get back to reality.
896473216075665408 2017-08-12 20:47:25 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke #snowflake. You sad?
896473060185911296 2017-08-12 20:46:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @DrDavidDuke You got played...he just wanted your vote. He too much of a chicken to admit it though.
896469001026637824 2017-08-12 20:30:40 UTC <karen_grand1> @BillOReilly You are a part of it.
896411484259057665 2017-08-12 16:42:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan Well there you have it. Racist Trump supporters. They will follow him to the end. It's sickening.
896395777819455488 2017-08-12 15:39:42 UTC <karen_grand1> @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr is a liar too. They all need to go.
896395681128222721 2017-08-12 15:39:19 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @RealJamesWoods I'll be too busy listening to the liar in chief....@POTUS
895796662932840451 2017-08-10 23:59:02 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @KathrynCiviello union homes?  I think not.
895795881672400897 2017-08-10 23:55:55 UTC <karen_grand1> @seanhannity Are you living under a rock? If so, please stay there and go away.
895789400227033088 2017-08-10 23:30:10 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan @KathrynCiviello is this real life?
895331864331771912 2017-08-09 17:12:05 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine #snowflake. Keep crying about it
895331758949847041 2017-08-09 17:11:40 UTC <karen_grand1> @FoxNews Fox News has so many snowflakes working for them.
895060113471533056 2017-08-08 23:12:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @olgaNYC1211 @ProudResister These redneck losers probably think it's great. Feel sorry for all of us. He needs removed from office.
895059623144804352 2017-08-08 23:10:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan @KathrynCiviello he's crazy. No other way to describe him.
894314935097937921 2017-08-06 21:51:10 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Let's worry about @POTUS first. Stop trying to divert attention from him.
892860343931867140 2017-08-02 21:31:09 UTC <karen_grand1> @ScrubsandPearls Nothing.
892786575955959808 2017-08-02 16:38:01 UTC <karen_grand1> @jstines3 Seriously,  it's a twitter poll. Quit whining about it. You act like he's colluding with Russia...oh wait,  that's @POTUS.
892769253593677825 2017-08-02 15:29:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @BillOReilly That's the problem...he is not wise when it comes to anything Presidential.
892476855244251136 2017-08-01 20:07:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @TIME When he's in the White House he is weighing in as the President..not as a father.His whole family is involved he can't use that as an excuse
892475906618478593 2017-08-01 20:03:32 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNN @SarahHuckabee you are sounding delusional.  @POTUS is going to bring you all down.
892184797526863872 2017-07-31 00:46:46 UTC <karen_grand1> @JoyAnnReid #coverup

891737266065993728 2017-07-30 19:08:26 UTC <karen_grand1> @piersmorgan Sounds like you're a little obsessed with her. @POTUS tweets false info daily..where is your outrage with him?
891354485884420096 2017-07-29 17:47:24 UTC <karen_grand1> @JLMarchese111 @Scaramuicci Hey,  if @POTUS can go back on his word...then....what's the problem?
891352523092758529 2017-07-29 17:39:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @washingtonpost @nytimes @politico @seanspicer Now you have something to say? Couldn't get anything from you before.
891323079850438658 2017-07-29 15:42:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @Scaramucci You have no class.
891055457791553538 2017-07-28 21:59:10 UTC <karen_grand1> @Scaramucci @SarahHuckabee @KellyO Can't believe a single thing that woman says
891044585220255746 2017-07-28 21:15:58 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Please give us five examples of what you have accomplished.
891041536229748736 2017-07-28 21:03:51 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @FoxNews @shash1026 I'm quite aware of that.I don't need to you to tell me what's happening in the news. Still doesn't mean it's going to happen...pay attention
891005953482641410 2017-07-28 18:42:28 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @FoxNews You're not building a wall.....you can't even accomplish that. The only thing you follow through with is your golf swing.
891004142839377920 2017-07-28 18:35:16 UTC <karen_grand1> @MattGertz That's my opinion when I saw you Republicans celebrating @realDonaldTrump win. How's that working out for you.....Where's the wall?
890984252220813312 2017-07-28 17:16:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @Scaramucci Yes it will...
890969281122447360 2017-07-28 16:16:44 UTC <karen_grand1> @NBCNews Then get @POTUS the hell out of there. Tired of his lies...and that damn lying family of his.
890929057042444288 2017-07-28 13:36:54 UTC <karen_grand1> @MarkRuffalo @AdamParkhomenko "He is the swamp" such a true statement.
890701361934979072 2017-07-27 22:32:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine No one cares...
890582259916562432 2017-07-27 14:38:51 UTC <karen_grand1> @ananavarro One good thing about being a night shifter...easier to keep up with the deranged @POTUS and his late night tweeting.
890581684684566530 2017-07-27 14:36:34 UTC <karen_grand1> @MikeGibbonsOH Well the problem is @POTUS sets a bad example. He's the worst of the worst.
890467796534136832 2017-07-27 07:04:01 UTC <karen_grand1> @Andy @pamelahornbeck He has just as much of a right to voice his opinion as anyone. So because he's famous he can't express his views? As Trump would say..WRONG
890466984609054720 2017-07-27 07:00:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @theyearofelan Wow...
890305678337822722 2017-07-26 20:19:49 UTC <karen_grand1> @mviser They can't answer a single question. They have no answers....none!  We are all Fu*$&@!!
890175838594924544 2017-07-26 11:43:53 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump I'm happy to see you are concerned with   something that is troubling our country..crowd size...I can rest easy knowing this....
890175086774419456 2017-07-26 11:40:53 UTC <karen_grand1> @Scaramucci @FoxNews You people can never stop talking about Obama. Take some responsibility for once.  Just one time..try it.
890174679171969028 2017-07-26 11:39:16 UTC <karen_grand1> @WhiteHouse @Scaramucci @FoxNews We deserve better than @POTUS
890173979692081152 2017-07-26 11:36:30 UTC <karen_grand1> @lisamurkowski @realDonaldTrump I'm surprised you even know Alaska is a state...sadly I don't view you as smart enough to know that....

890030887840210945 2017-07-25 02:07:54 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan Take a trip to Canton Ohio @POTUS ..a lot of people know who he was...visit the museum...learn something.pic.twitter.com/1kgqjpiohe
890003071715221504 2017-07-25 00:17:22 UTC <karen_grand1> @NBCNews He's all about the sound bite...no clear message. All for applause.  In his warped mind , applause=success as a President. #sad
890000025698304000 2017-07-25 00:05:16 UTC <karen_grand1> @HITEXECUTIVE I hate knowing that orange blob is in my state
889810539970539520 2017-07-25 11:32:19 UTC <karen_grand1> @BraddJaffy Unbelievable. Sounds like a campaign speech. He's a disgrace.
889613739649060869 2017-07-24 22:30:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @IvankaTrump #maga will happen once your crooked family ..gets the hell out of the white House.
889604535458689024 2017-07-24 21:53:43 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @davidaxelrod You are so right. His hatred of Obama is so obvious.
889579672245334019 2017-07-24 20:14:56 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics @POTUS there's been enough tweeting and no action. #walkthetalk

889563298886299650 2017-07-24 19:09:52 UTC <karen_grand1> @chelseahandler When are these people going to take responsibility? It's sickening.
889445810512986112 2017-07-24 11:23:00 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump What's your point? You talk an awful lot about it for nothing being found. We know you're afraid it's written all over your tweets.Good day.

888860876975034369 2017-07-22 20:38:41 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Because they are too busy looking into your corrupt family.
888820375727067136 2017-07-22 17:57:45 UTC <karen_grand1> @Scaramucci Deleting tweets just like @POTUS you 2 deserve each other. I hope you both sink.

872196078661140480 2017-06-06 20:58:44 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics I think he's mentally unstable
872195657804783616 2017-06-06 20:57:04 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump thought your press secretary said that we were not supposed to take everything you said seriously. now you're getting the message out?
872183240106364929 2017-06-06 20:07:43 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr You don't even know if it's true you are putting fake news out there yourself.
872182904025214976 2017-06-06 20:06:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @foxandfriends @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump Crybaby
872182767353724928 2017-06-06 20:05:50 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @PressSec Yea because it's all about winning. This isn't a golf game.
872148352561012736 2017-06-06 17:49:05 UTC <karen_grand1> @JessicaHuseman @KathrynCiviello
871707693282717696 2017-06-05 12:38:04 UTC <karen_grand1> @impeach_d_trump @KathrynCiviello we need to find a way to watch this.
871707232722878465 2017-06-05 12:36:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Go play golf somewhere...you are useless to us.
870821794084769792 2017-06-02 01:57:49 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kathygriffin is one of the funniest comedians around. Guarantee she would make a better president than @realDonaldTrump.
870816498918543360 2017-06-02 01:36:46 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @kathygriffin @FoxNews Good. That's her job she's allowed to make fun of the president. We all are allowed to make fun of the president. I do it daily.
870692608112119814 2017-06-02 17:24:29 UTC <karen_grand1> @AnnCoulter You are part of the problem.
870365800489779200 2017-06-01 19:45:52 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Because @POTUS won't admit it. But I bet you would have no problem with it. Because you are a mature adult.
870365665118625792 2017-06-01 19:45:19 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Did you make that typo on purpose?  And will you admit to it or are you going to say that's the new way of speaking. 
870357773955026945 2017-06-01 19:13:58 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Exactly!! he made a typo..seriously...what kind of grown adult can't admit to it.  Sad..very sad.... and yes @KathrynCiviello I feel great.
870102435280424968 2017-05-31 02:19:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump You're still calling HER crooked? That describes you, your family, your cabinet and your friends. #lockhimup
870101240956440576 2017-05-31 02:14:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr And your father is not trying hard enough. Less golf more work
870048518022590464 2017-05-31 22:45:06 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan This. Is. Awesome. Sad. But awesome.
870048318470197249 2017-05-31 22:44:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @LetzBrealistic I know he did not vote for Trump .. can you not read? Stop acting like a #covfefe
869997677525774341 2017-05-31 19:23:04 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics For the love of #covfefe just admit he made a mistake!
869996536528158721 2017-05-31 19:18:32 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics @KathrynCiviello seriously 
869990340459061248 2017-05-31 18:53:55 UTC <karen_grand1> @kathygriffin @DonaldJTrumpJr @Liz_Wheeler @Rosie @13sjwWalker She didn't say he was a Trump supporter. She merely stated that hatred towards Muslims was a tone that Trump set for this country.
869989452898340865 2017-05-31 18:50:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @kathygriffin @Liz_Wheeler He's 11 years old I'm sure he did not really think that was his dad.Just trying to get sympathy..move on. He didn't care about Obama's kids.
869886732774387712 2017-05-31 12:02:13 UTC <karen_grand1> @DavidHMandel @VeepHBO @ABTargov This is great!!
869732776119070721 2017-05-30 01:50:27 UTC <karen_grand1> @AnnCoulter She is funny. You....are sad, very sad.
869257447055249408 2017-05-29 18:21:40 UTC <karen_grand1> @goldengateblond I can't deal with that man today.  
868834371939311616 2017-05-28 14:20:31 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Whenever you see,  @POTUS said......you know it's dumb, not true, unintelligible.
868833600044752897 2017-05-28 14:17:27 UTC <karen_grand1> @davidaxelrod @KathrynCiviello well that didn't last long. He can't help himself. @realDonaldTrump just because it's negative doesn't mean it's fake
868833090315194370 2017-05-28 14:15:25 UTC <karen_grand1> @WattersWorld @JesseBWatters @POTUS @TheDemocrats @EricTrump @FoxNews Not true at all.
868647589566185472 2017-05-27 01:58:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @FoxNews Damn. He came back...I'm so disappointed.
868592909045698560 2017-05-27 22:21:01 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr @slashsplat Absolutely they require evidence just waiting for it.  Do you Trump supporters actually have any other argument other than "fake news "
868583740125179904 2017-05-27 21:44:35 UTC <karen_grand1> @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you going to visit your brother in law in jail?
868510941347971072 2017-05-27 16:55:19 UTC <karen_grand1> @AynRandPaulRyan @KathrynCiviello wow.
868508803817459713 2017-05-27 16:46:49 UTC <karen_grand1> @MSNBC Can you say....guilty AF
868444840715063296 2017-05-27 12:32:39 UTC <karen_grand1> @Bencjacobs @JordynPhelps He's afraid they will reveal how ignorant he really is.
868209916359606272 2017-05-26 20:59:09 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends He needs a padded room.
868208674262667264 2017-05-26 20:54:13 UTC <karen_grand1> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump How many people did you push out of the way to get that picture?
868208389641383936 2017-05-26 20:53:05 UTC <karen_grand1> @RVAwonk Sad when there's more effort involved in covering up their lies than running the country.
867569809575333889 2017-05-24 02:35:35 UTC <karen_grand1> @LawyerRogelio Well, when the leader of the country has no morals...it's inevitable.  To quote Trump..."sad, very sad" ..."losers"
867342208646696960 2017-05-24 11:31:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MichaelCohen212 I wake up every morning and think damn....that idiot is still the President....sad, very sad....
867224423480340480 2017-05-23 03:43:09 UTC <karen_grand1> @williamlegate @KathrynCiviello he was so close.....rejected again.....
867212205825118210 2017-05-23 02:54:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @seanhannity Ooohhhhh the suspense....'yawning'
867033907635642369 2017-05-23 15:06:06 UTC <karen_grand1> @VP Are you really believing what you are saying? Leadership?  He shows his ignorance every time he opens his mouth.
867032654373408768 2017-05-23 15:01:08 UTC <karen_grand1> @bannerite @peterdaou @KathrynCiviello our 'favorite' person at it again.
867031897746157570 2017-05-23 14:58:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @bannerite @peterdaou He thinks he's the smartest one in the room.
866722303811489794 2017-05-22 18:27:54 UTC <karen_grand1> @IvankaTrump You are so fake. There's no way you can support @realDonaldTrump and then talk about your faith.
866663470632226819 2017-05-22 14:34:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @FoxNews I bet he's thinking ....just get the picture so I can be done with this...
866339080036118530 2017-05-21 17:05:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @FoxNews I seriously have to read what Trump says because I cannot stand to listen to him talk.  He is a smarmy little man.
866292168310353922 2017-05-21 13:58:42 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump @Rosie @AmandiOnAir That was very interesting. Now I see why Mueller is so respected.
866286458855972865 2017-05-21 13:36:01 UTC <karen_grand1> @jeffzeleny @CNNPolitics He is a very powerful speaker.So eloquent and poised...I wish that described our President.He's a fumbling idiot.He will talk about himself
866281578602930176 2017-05-21 13:16:37 UTC <karen_grand1> @NBCTheVoice Not even watching it anymore now that @gwenstefani team is out...
866276123520401408 2017-05-21 12:54:57 UTC <karen_grand1> @NBCNews Radical Islamic terrorist.Come on @realDonaldTrump you know it's going to slip out.act like a big man over here when you say it.Go on say it
866267698447216640 2017-05-21 12:21:28 UTC <karen_grand1> @JimYongKim @IvankaTrump Well, at least that kept you and your traitor husband busy....while the FBI is gathering evidence against Trumps team.
866124007216746496 2017-05-20 02:50:29 UTC <karen_grand1> @IMPL0RABLE A lot of racist Trump supporters...not all but they are definitely extreme in their hatred.
866116883032010752 2017-05-20 02:22:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @ShaunKing Let me guess...he voted for Trump
865749589105704960 2017-05-19 02:02:41 UTC <karen_grand1> @RealSkipBayless Such a hater...always have been when it comes to #LeBronJames #Cavs
865728334428332034 2017-05-19 00:38:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @Reganonymous  I love @andersoncooper
865724816904658945 2017-05-19 00:24:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @thehill Wow it's going to be a snowball effect.....#snowflakes. How you like us now??!!!
865723536631103488 2017-05-19 00:19:10 UTC <karen_grand1> @thehill No!! I'll read it now.
865719477874434052 2017-05-19 00:03:02 UTC <karen_grand1> @4everNeverTrump Can we leave him there and forget about him...?
865718189623267328 2017-05-19 23:57:55 UTC <karen_grand1> @washingtonpost @nytimes @newtgingrich @FoxNews @POTUS doesn't need help from anybody else he's doing a good job himself.
865712670493814785 2017-05-19 23:35:59 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics I. Can. Not. Wait.
865712498128932866 2017-05-19 23:35:18 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Maybe she should have been carrying a golf club
865704683163316224 2017-05-19 23:04:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics She walks like a robot her movements are not natural.
865704571989086209 2017-05-19 23:03:48 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Absolutely!!! I will be there. Have the wine ready.
865662211548602370 2017-05-19 20:15:29 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics I agree. They seem odd/awkward together.
865652976160972803 2017-05-19 19:38:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @Bre_payton @FoxNews He's a really tv personality trying to act presidential. He's not doing a very good job of it.
865191071617347585 2017-05-18 13:03:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @Bre_payton @foxandfriends Everybody else is tweeting about his #impeachment ....get on board.
865179038859579395 2017-05-18 12:15:31 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Do you mean this was bigger than you trying to prove Obama was not an American?
865178564160880640 2017-05-18 12:13:38 UTC <karen_grand1> @AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump Did you mean counsel?

864998053266247680 2017-05-17 00:16:21 UTC <karen_grand1> Haven't heard much from @realDonaldTrump family lately...where's @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @jaredkushner 
864963982595174403 2017-05-17 22:00:58 UTC <karen_grand1> @IMPL0RABLE It's always about him. He's a disgrace.
864960373182652417 2017-05-17 21:46:37 UTC <karen_grand1> @LouiseMensch @KathrynCiviello wow this is unreal.  Disgusting to think he's our president.
864623700410331136 2017-05-16 23:28:48 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump How about first we find out about all the shady dealings you've been doing and then we will worry about the leakers
864437107904962562 2017-05-16 11:07:21 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump If you did nothing wrong quit tweeting about it. Don't you have a job to do? Like...run the country? .......or golf...
864305646967152640 2017-05-15 02:24:58 UTC <karen_grand1> I guess we could always ask the media if Trump gave away secrets to Russia ...oh wait, that's right.. they weren't allowed in the room.
863967019699511296 2017-05-14 03:59:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump You forgot to say you wanted to grab them by the p%%
863254567907151873 2017-05-12 04:48:22 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics First smart thing they've done since the election.
863038605891166212 2017-05-12 14:30:12 UTC <karen_grand1> @GeraldoRivera @foxandfriends You are right we should not compare it Trump is worse
863020518013902848 2017-05-12 13:18:20 UTC <karen_grand1> people that are defending @POTUS need to stop using the line 'we all need to get over Hillary'       This. Has. Nothing. To. Do. With. Her.
863019528653070336 2017-05-12 13:14:24 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump You need to get it through that thick ugly head of yours that that is just not true.
863019411724275712 2017-05-12 13:13:56 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Glad to see somebody's working today
863017275015745536 2017-05-12 13:05:27 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Active president? Seriously! you play golf and rant on Twitter. My pug is more active than you and he sleeps 15 hours a day.
863017007394041856 2017-05-12 13:04:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump You're like a little kid... let me change that you are like a bratty little kid...was it written in crayon?
863014188544864261 2017-05-12 12:53:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Wow! now you are threatening him? You definitely have something to hide. This would make a great reality show..oh wait. This IS reality..sad
862858163372134400 2017-05-11 02:33:11 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics That's her way of saying she has no idea....
862857373312069632 2017-05-11 02:30:03 UTC <karen_grand1> @sweebabypeach Sounds wonderful 
862804570065559553 2017-05-11 23:00:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @ddale8 @PhilipRucker @realDonaldTrump so it's not about the emails? You need to get your story straight you change it more than you change your wives..almost
862776104918147073 2017-05-11 21:07:07 UTC <karen_grand1> @TIME @realDonaldTrump I think you are secretly in love with @Rosie ...come on...admit it. You are definitely obsessed with her.
862775152597241856 2017-05-11 21:03:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics Yeah because that's all we need. The investigation needs to continue that's the problem... they are trying to make it go away. #shadyAF
862774689818660864 2017-05-11 21:01:30 UTC <karen_grand1> @ddale8 He's all about ...do what I say not what I do...hypocrite

862771487383707649 2017-05-11 20:48:46 UTC <karen_grand1> @TheDailyShow And most of us are laughing at your poor attempt to be President. Actually though , it's quite sad..
862771036907065346 2017-05-11 20:46:59 UTC <karen_grand1> @glamour_fashion Of course it is...
862370712748785675 2017-05-10 18:16:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @Acosta Right!!!! Because that pig @realDonaldTrump is so fair. He just wanted to give him a chance.  THAT is laughable.
862359139728715776 2017-05-10 17:30:15 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Now, we need someone who will 'do a far better job' as President....are there any 2 year olds available?
862033933831110656 2017-05-09 19:58:00 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics You want to move on?  Similar to republicans and especially @realDonaldTrump moving on from Hillary Clintons emails? ...noted

860643364651380738 2017-05-05 23:52:22 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Are you sure you're not smoking something before you get on Twitter
860643116101099521 2017-05-05 23:51:23 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump Can't even click on it because I can't stand to listen to the sound of your voice.
860642822592004096 2017-05-05 23:50:13 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump I can't even take you seriously.

859843950970109961 2017-05-03 18:55:47 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics I'm pretty sure @POTUS is still talking about the election. You want her to get over it...tell the 'President' to get over it.

859130109986516992 2017-05-01 19:39:14 UTC <karen_grand1> @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews You consider democrats 'snowflakes' so are you implying democrats are not American workers?

857927636257050628 2017-04-28 12:01:02 UTC <karen_grand1> I wake up every morning and check twitter to make sure @realDonaldTrump hasn't tweeted the start of a war.
857699535128334337 2017-04-27 20:54:39 UTC <karen_grand1> @CNNPolitics He blames the Obama White House...for everything.....pick a new excuse.

845347567097581569 2017-03-24 18:52:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @PressSec right...and I'm going to be the new President. Just because you say it doesn't make it true.
844897276975820800 2017-03-23 13:03:02 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS just say NO to #Trumpcare
844896150767460354 2017-03-23 12:58:34 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump you need to be medicated.
844274623621619714 2017-03-21 19:48:50 UTC <karen_grand1> @ABC maybe she can start a fragrance line called WestWing...that's not unrealistic with the Trump crew...
844242880294281219 2017-03-21 17:42:42 UTC <karen_grand1> Has @POTUS tweeted anything dumb today?
844191600414724101 2017-03-21 14:18:56 UTC <karen_grand1> @TIME he such a delusional clown. A tweet from @POTUS means absolutely nothing when he tweets about everything...
844176809281404928 2017-03-21 13:20:10 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC @foxandfriends I think your facelift pulled your skin too tight and you can't think straight.

844175448179441664 2017-03-21 13:14:45 UTC <karen_grand1> @realDonaldTrump don't change the slogan. You will need to print new hats.
844174994301173760 2017-03-21 13:12:57 UTC <karen_grand1> @foxandfriends Really Newt? They are still gathering information...maybe go cry to Trump and Putin I'm sure they are FaceTimeing daily.

843920698385096705 2017-03-20 20:22:28 UTC <karen_grand1> @PressSec you are so narrowminded
843920414107668480 2017-03-20 20:21:20 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS @PressSec I thought the fight was going to be over in the first 30 days? Where is his #SecretPlan
843904878984527873 2017-03-20 19:19:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC you only care about the leaks you don't care about Russia
843904372530712576 2017-03-20 19:17:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC you are talking about hearsay but Trump makes his opinion based on Fox news reports seriously talk to your president
843904201046593536 2017-03-20 19:16:55 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC don't talk about respect when you will never admit Trump is a liar because he's a Republican.
843904114677506048 2017-03-20 19:16:34 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC don't talk about respect when you have Trump as our president!!!
843900097461190657 2017-03-20 19:00:36 UTC <karen_grand1> @RepDennyHeck way to go @POTUS deserved that. He's guilty. No doubt about it.

843871776442585090 2017-03-20 17:08:04 UTC <karen_grand1> @POTUS I knew that's the only thing you would take from that exchange. You know you are guilty. We all know it #ImpeachTrump

843846214177165312 2017-03-20 15:26:30 UTC <karen_grand1> @TGowdySC you need to ask about what @realDonaldTrump did!!!  You are worried about the wrong thing.

842091405262635008 2017-03-15 19:13:30 UTC <karen_grand1> @ABC when @POTUS says "believe me" you should definitely NOT believe him.
842041125368143872 2017-03-15 15:53:43 UTC <karen_grand1> @seanhannity @foxandfriends you will never admit Trump is an embarrassment as President. He could shoot your dog and you would kiss his feet
