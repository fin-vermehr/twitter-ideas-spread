970892430756208640 2018-03-05 05:22:48 UTC <trealace> Just brought out some new toys for the kitties & all 3 of them are running around being goofy & having a blast. Im so happy!!!
970709710042206208 2018-03-05 17:16:44 UTC <trealace> My manager just told me to take my nose ring out  get with the times, dweeb.
970381926401040385 2018-03-04 19:34:14 UTC <trealace> Honestly.. Sage is kind of a dick. I know well get past it & one day well be cool but right now shes a total dickhead cat.
970035325128052736 2018-03-03 20:36:58 UTC <trealace> Some guy really had the nerve to say this to me!pic.twitter.com/W1VeAiKiXv

970023724262023168 2018-03-03 19:50:52 UTC <trealace> Green Bean is home! My neighbor found him!!!
969993143813894145 2018-03-03 17:49:21 UTC <trealace> @kelseynooj Im about to go knock on doors. Im hoping someone in the building saw him before he went outside & maybe let him stay at their place for the night. I put signs up to let them know Im looking for him.
969944061846216708 2018-03-03 14:34:19 UTC <trealace> @Cosmokelso0o Im freaking out! Hell probably turn up tonight & he might just be laying low somewhere since hes never been outside around here. Its a big complex with a courtyard that has a bunch of bushes & trees. I left some food out by the sliding door, idk what else to do!
969942959385989121 2018-03-03 14:29:56 UTC <trealace> @jalanejonas Im just scared someones gonna take him or he wont be able to safely find his way back..
969931317986185216 2018-03-03 13:43:41 UTC <trealace> @jalanejonas Hell probably turn up in 24 hours unless someone stole him. Hes a really sweet boy. He probably just wanted to explore, they usually stay within a close range but Im so fucking scared!!!
969930176644689920 2018-03-03 13:39:09 UTC <trealace> @jalanejonas I slept with the bedroom door closed last night & he usually scratches on the door to wake me up to let him in. I thought he was just behaving for me 
969924299246198784 2018-03-03 13:15:47 UTC <trealace> @jalanejonas Maybe if one of the neighbors took him in. He just got his hair cut. I really think he really might have followed someone else out of the building
969920551795019776 2018-03-03 13:00:54 UTC <trealace> He is definitely not in my apartment. He snuck out
969919600656830464 2018-03-03 12:57:07 UTC <trealace> Ive been letting him follow me around the apartment building & I think he must have snuck out when I left to get food last night around 8PM because he is not here & Im fucking panicking
969919060245975040 2018-03-03 12:54:58 UTC <trealace> Green Bean is MISSING! I think he snuck out

969460464399810560 2018-03-01 06:32:41 UTC <trealace> Shes literally like begging the boys to have sex with her & its AWKWARD...
969460229627940864 2018-03-01 06:31:45 UTC <trealace> Made Sage an appt. to get fixed & March 24 cant come soon enough. First off I have to shut her out of my room while I sleep cause she cries all night. Yesterday she gets on my bed & Im like awe she wants to snuggle in my blankets but no she starts pissing on my comforter
969429283738439680 2018-03-01 04:28:47 UTC <trealace> I switched from a volunteer to a participant because.. when am I ever gonna get the opportunity to legitimately jello wrestle again?! & its for a good cause!pic.twitter.com/zEQgmUKoEU

968143827356848128 2018-02-26 15:20:50 UTC <trealace> I had a very strange, creepy dream last night about someone I dislike but havent had to see or run into in awhile & this morning I saw him driving.
967210661016162304 2018-02-23 01:32:46 UTC <trealace> I was supposed to take my nephew to the movies tonight but he forgot & went to do something else 
967210540039917568 2018-02-23 01:32:17 UTC <trealace> I wanna be social but Im sooo tired. Someone come sit around with me.
966559945150881794 2018-02-21 06:27:03 UTC <trealace> Got to check out the SNL exhibit at the Chicago museum of Broadcast Communications. It was pretty awesome & informative! Its always been a dream of mine to be a part of the show one day & seeing this inspired me to keep pursuing comedy through Second City.pic.twitter.com/oTgn5GVkTE
966169811926638597 2018-02-20 04:36:48 UTC <trealace> Would you guys be interested in going to a jello wrestling fundraiser event?
966145592543076353 2018-02-20 03:00:34 UTC <trealace> Even though I was pretty ready for it & excited to get to experience that & it would have been easy enough to find the kittens homes.
966145296538497025 2018-02-20 02:59:23 UTC <trealace> I guess she just looked chubby  Cats have a natural pooch to store food in the wild & the 2 ladies that helped me catch her said they were pretty sure she was. I even have pictures where she looks super pregnant. But it is better for the cat population anyway
966144644936617985 2018-02-20 02:56:48 UTC <trealace> Ive known this for awhile but realized that I havent shared the news.. turns out Sage is NOT pregnant.. but shes in heat & shes been humping the boys, (both fixed) howling at night, waking me up
966138415665307654 2018-02-20 02:32:02 UTC <trealace> @kelseynooj Thats what I thought too! I looked it up cause I was like wait is he younger than me..?
966134840822288384 2018-02-20 02:17:50 UTC <trealace> I just found out Chadwick Boseman is FOURTY years old & I am what the kids call shook!pic.twitter.com/A94qQ6Tm63

963111223242969091 2018-02-12 18:03:04 UTC <trealace> Im 100% not living up to my true potential & I fucking hate myself for it.
963107634554507264 2018-02-12 17:48:48 UTC <trealace> Today is one of those days at work where Im like I CANNOT work here anymore. I NEED to start doing something else. Im better than this. Ive only been here for 45 minutes & I was having a panic attack in the first 10.

956729647336738816 2018-01-25 03:24:57 UTC <trealace> So earlier today @_kevcolon & I were randomly walking around New Orleans bc we just wanted to check out the scene near our hotel. We got some drinks/food & we kept saying how cool would it be to run into one of the celebrity cruise guests..

955183623430377474 2018-01-21 21:01:36 UTC <trealace> @nicholasbane Its just interesting to me that the church-goers are pretty much always the rudest & least generous people to wait on. They run you all over the place asking for this & that then leave you $2 & a Jesus pamphlet 
955167331533148160 2018-01-21 19:56:52 UTC <trealace> Im working an open to close, I was hoping to get a break in between shifts but were busy so doesnt look like thats gonna happen & my third table pissed me off & sucked the soul out of me already.

954136729786748928 2018-01-18 23:41:38 UTC <trealace> We became good friends almost instantly & now we fill each others DMs with shit posts. Youre one of the most witty & clever dudes Ive ever met & you can come back with a joke so quick it makes my head spin. You & your goddess gf are the cutest
953842032472150016 2018-01-17 04:10:36 UTC <trealace> @alsncthrn Yes maam it is! 
953768372885434369 2018-01-17 23:17:54 UTC <trealace> @HOSS_REDD You can come over but only if its anonymously. I wanna not be sure if its really you.
953764736075747328 2018-01-17 23:03:27 UTC <trealace> I hate going out after practice but the teams having a pizza party so i guess ima go do that
953757418772746242 2018-01-17 22:34:23 UTC <trealace> Theyre transferring me from a 2 bedroom to a 1 bedroom in the same building! Literally downstairs, I dont even have to pack anything into my car. Moving day is Feb 1st 
953749014280835072 2018-01-17 22:00:59 UTC <trealace> @rilue My sister is going to. I know they can handle it in the wild but if theres any complications I wanna be there! Id hate to miss it. hopefully shes not quite there yet. I dont have a good timeline bc shes never let me really examine her & theyre only pregnant for like 65 days
953736044171624448 2018-01-17 21:09:27 UTC <trealace> @baz00per Ive never wanted to delete someone elses tweet so badly 
953724241987493888 2018-01-17 20:22:33 UTC <trealace> You not only pull off but completely SLAY any look or hair color. Youre insanely good at makeup looks & have excellent aesthetic & artistic taste. Everyone who meets you loves you. A lil goddess 
953724064228610048 2018-01-17 20:21:50 UTC <trealace> You have such intense artistic vision! Your work is seriously beautiful. Youre really gonna go places with your photography & you deserve it. A really sweet person who wants whats best for the planet. Youve taught me a thing or two about girl power
953684598285848577 2018-01-17 17:45:01 UTC <trealace> ! Ive never seen her this friendly with any of us before! Baby girl is coming around & making progress. & look at dat lil pregnant belly!pic.twitter.com/mhLZtaBZRG
953568012690513920 2018-01-17 10:01:45 UTC <trealace> Seriously such a natural beauty inside & out & everybody knows it. I feel like Ive watched you grow up & youre such a lovely & impressive young woman. Its absolutely BADASS that you coach cheerleading. One of the most accepting & good-natured girls I know & so fun to talk to.
953563906999496705 2018-01-17 09:45:26 UTC <trealace> You once posted a status on Facebook about environmental consciousness & it inspired me to chase down & yell at some punks I caught littering. You & I both struggle with mental health & self image, youre so supportive & kind. Youve lifted me up & let me know that Im not alone
953562543649419264 2018-01-17 09:40:01 UTC <trealace> You love your dogs as much as I love my cats. Such a genuine soul & all around great guy. Someone so understanding & easy to talk to. I dated one of your good friends & even though things werent always great, I never once felt judged or disliked by you, I really appreciate that
953523280262123521 2018-01-16 07:04:00 UTC <trealace> Im drinking wine cause I dont have any weed

953496384044445696 2018-01-16 05:17:07 UTC <trealace> Woke bae! A true ally. Someone I know I can trust. Selfless, caring, big-hearted. Youve always had it rough but truly deserve the best things in life! You inspire the fuck out of me! Creative as hell. Excellent taste in pretty much everything.
953495433237745664 2018-01-16 05:13:21 UTC <trealace> Ive known you since elementary school & youve grown into (& have really always been) such a rad dude! You can do anything you set your mind to & have such great insight
953494600563519489 2018-01-16 05:10:02 UTC <trealace> I feel like I havent given you enough credit- youre probably the most supportive friend Ive ever had in my life & youve really been there for me lately, it means so much. Im eternally grateful for your positive influences that made me more socially active & self-aware 
953493478595538950 2018-01-16 05:05:35 UTC <trealace> Gorgeous mama! Ive been loving that were becoming better friends through shared views. Your family is beautiful & you have cute freckles & awesome fashion sense.
953493199863066625 2018-01-16 05:04:28 UTC <trealace> I love that weve been talking more lately. I always forget how fucking hilarious & sarcastic you are. Youve grown into such a great woman & a great mother & you & ya manz are cute as hell. Im happy for you!
953493109362610176 2018-01-16 05:04:06 UTC <trealace> A scarlet haired queen! So beautiful & with great taste in music, movies, literature, & fashion.
953397249417121793 2018-01-16 22:43:12 UTC <trealace> @nessskiii He was the other bald white guy, he got hired around the same time as Creeper Mike
953373493411926016 2018-01-16 21:08:48 UTC <trealace> I just accidentally spilled a little bit of this ladies drink on her (it happens, the glass tipped when I set it down because its one of our flights) a little splash got on the table & seriously only a few drops got on her lap & she flipped out. Bitch is wearing SWEATPANTS.
953372060146913280 2018-01-16 21:03:06 UTC <trealace> @nessskiii Also they thought that he had gotten drunk here, we hadnt given him any alcohol at all. We gave him water, he came in like that. & he had walked here. We let him have some bread & chill for a bit but we were like I mean you cant stay here all day.. he kept asking them for rides
953371708156792834 2018-01-16 21:01:42 UTC <trealace> @nessskiii We had the situation under control & were trying to help him get a ride home. He kept tryin to leave & fell every time he got up. They thought we were letting him leave in his condition & called the cops (we were about to anyway) they kept saying we were trying to kill him
953371053027360769 2018-01-16 20:59:06 UTC <trealace> @nessskiii That guy Dave that used to work here & then stopped showing up came in piss drunk to beg for his job back. He was so wasted he couldnt stand. My table in the bar wanted to be heroes so they got involved & they really shouldnt have. They started cussing us out & screaming.
953336742295277568 2018-01-16 18:42:46 UTC <trealace> Victim blaming is a really fucking bad look for yall.
953334846092447744 2018-01-16 18:35:14 UTC <trealace> I kept doing this when I wore contacts last weekend, just poking myself in the bridge of my nose pushing up my invisible glasses https://twitter.com/levinejonathan/status/953310521775788032
953320750315864065 2018-01-16 17:39:13 UTC <trealace> If youre out here calling the Aziz story Buyers remorse I dont think I wanna be friends.. something similar happened to me in October (it STARTED consensual but that changed) & Ive been going to counseling for it. He tried to tell me I was just having regrets too
953319739211894785 2018-01-16 17:35:12 UTC <trealace> We had a very strange & annoying incident at work with some margarita regulars last week (the cops came) & Im anxious that these bitches are boldly gonna come back in today & try to sit in my section.. Cause Im not gonna NOT say something..

952734496989868034 2018-01-14 02:49:39 UTC <trealace> Ive been so emotional lately! I feel like Im ready to cry at any moment. Over anything. Or nothing. Maybe I should have a weep-athon soon & let out whatevers apparently been hurting me 
952708461644713986 2018-01-14 01:06:12 UTC <trealace> So pretty much you should only follow me on Snapchat if you LOVE cats. Or else youre just gonna think everything I post is really annoying.
952666752244121600 2018-01-14 22:20:28 UTC <trealace> Just a few of the cruise activities Im excited for - hangin out in the pool with @justanactor?! Bingo with @RossMarquand?! Less than 14 days until @WSCruise!!!pic.twitter.com/HF1kdQYWXi

952370128229937154 2018-01-13 02:41:47 UTC <trealace> Customers annoy me so much at work sometimes it actually makes me feel depressed that people are so dumb & also that I have so little patience. I wish I was a nicer person - but the ignorance I see on the daily!!! It hurts!!!
952321340996030464 2018-01-13 23:27:55 UTC <trealace> There was snow covering the ground when I parked.. Ive been out to my car several times this afternoon to load/unload a few things & I didnt even notice I was such a jackass until around 5 pm when I left for work.. pic.twitter.com/m88DuedzOP

949151011129606144 2018-01-04 05:30:10 UTC <trealace> @FlavaInYaEar23 Im happy that I dont have to live with him but he was someone I knew pretty well & it was shocking to find out hes such a fucking trash bag. I really think he just couldnt afford it & wanted to make it seem like I did something to get out of paying up.
949149122694561792 2018-01-04 05:22:39 UTC <trealace> It was so cringey to read! Im like you would have gotten more out of this by just shoving it up your fucking ass instead.
949148778908364801 2018-01-04 05:21:17 UTC <trealace> The crassly volatile behavior came AFTER being called a cunt repeatedly & being maniacally laughed at when I started crying & also told that I need to get laid or something We got in ONE argument AFTER he moved out while I was at work.
949147961744699399 2018-01-04 05:18:03 UTC <trealace> Fuckhead ex roomie Alan dropped this off today..

948752866612797440 2018-01-03 03:08:05 UTC <trealace> My ex-roomie was supposed to pay me back the $575 he owes me today & he uhhh.. DIDNT. So I guess Ill never get it. Cant say Im suprised but I did not deserve this shit. Fucking scumbag.

948267661787574277 2018-01-02 19:00:03 UTC <trealace> Whats up with the name Nolan getting so popular in the last few years? It sounds like an old white dude name to me but its the new we wanted something original name (even though Ive seen like 6 people name their son that recently?)
948057456600641537 2018-01-01 05:04:46 UTC <trealace> I never wear hats cuz Ive got a tiny child-sized head but maybe this ones not SO badpic.twitter.com/kPctwcxYrN
948048647811485697 2018-01-01 04:29:46 UTC <trealace> Okay honestly I know on like social media it probably seems like Im pretty into derby but I actually didnt enjoy last season at all, I think my mental health struggles kinda blew it for me & Im really gonna try hard to stay positive & have a better attitude about it this year.

946576820895436800 2017-12-28 03:01:15 UTC <trealace> I hate when people make little comments about my germophobia. Sorry people are gross! Im aware of how neurotic I am & its challenging & i dont think its funny. Respect my boundaries & get the fuck out of my face about it.
946485245251112965 2017-12-28 20:57:21 UTC <trealace> @luuckylizz This was on her post so its like you dont care about the feedback of a girl youre tryin to get with? Were just like dude stop coming off so desperate. Hes constantly advertising how sexually frustrated he is to where its concerning but it MUST BE the friend zones fault.

946161075032076289 2017-12-27 23:29:13 UTC <trealace> If i feel extremely depressed or suicidal I cant say that or let them know how dark it gets because then Ill get flagged & forced into programs that i dont wanna go through & thats just not what I need.
946159289948884999 2017-12-27 23:22:08 UTC <trealace> Ive been getting counseling through the military which has been nice but I feel like I cant really open up about anything or fully express my anxiety. I def caught myself mildly lying a few times because its easier than the follow up process if I come off too emotional.
946155045963300865 2017-12-27 23:05:16 UTC <trealace> @earthb0dy Thats the plan & shes super pregnant so I was gonna try to get her through that & find homes for the kittens when theyre ready but shes really pissed & I still havent been able to let her out of the trap because shes too scared & i cant stress her out too much

945063927234383872 2017-12-24 22:49:33 UTC <trealace> I saw Sage today! I went to check on her before I went to work. They plowed the parking lot around the crate she lives under so she wont get snowed in & she meowed to me when I called her name to let me know where she was. Looks like shes still pregnant & doin okay

945030748758773760 2017-12-24 20:37:42 UTC <trealace> Redhead appreciation tweet. Im sorry you guys dont even get to have an emoji, thats some bs.
945014916913795072 2017-12-24 19:34:48 UTC <trealace> I just bought a new little cheapy grinder on Wish & the total with shipping was $4.20
944845055457681408 2017-12-24 08:19:50 UTC <trealace> Well really I got my brothers a bunch of stuff & like one thing for everyone else so now I gotta even it out
944844661377699840 2017-12-24 08:18:16 UTC <trealace> I got a jump on holiday shopping so I thought I could chill but now Im finishing last minute & I still have to hit up another store tomorrow
944844316668780544 2017-12-24 08:16:54 UTC <trealace> Simpsons, Walking Dead, & Harry Potter versions of my fave board game Clue are out & I just have the original
944764304342921217 2017-12-23 02:58:57 UTC <trealace> I cant wait to get my nails done but theyre a holiday color (which I didnt do on purpose) soo I just let it go a few more days
944735602750185472 2017-12-23 01:04:54 UTC <trealace> Im sitting in my car where I usually see her but theres no sign. Hopefully shes just hiding out somewhere warm because if she has them this weekend, theyll most likely freeze to death.. theres no way she can keep them warm enough 
944732333281865728 2017-12-23 00:51:55 UTC <trealace> Sage, the stray cat Ive been trying to catch since Aug, has been missing for the last 2 days. She knows my voice & comes right out to greet me. This means that.. shes probably off somewhere having her babies. Which means that even if i can catch her now, I cant take her 
944425039142817792 2017-12-22 04:30:50 UTC <trealace> @nicholasbane Lauren Cohan(Maggie) had to drop out for a movie so they got Khary Payton(Ezekiel) to step in as well & Im super stoked for him cause I had wished he was on the original lineup. As long as my main man doesnt back out! Theres like 40 days left!
944422585609195521 2017-12-22 04:21:05 UTC <trealace> My roommate is about to be off work for a week, he better get some shit done around here
944398120548556800 2017-12-22 02:43:52 UTC <trealace> I was really excited to meet Greg Nicotero on the cruise but he had to cancel.. but they got Jon Bernthal on board in his place!pic.twitter.com/sU5M7tZ64T

943691547173949440 2017-12-20 03:56:12 UTC <trealace> I hate how pathetic cig smokers get about NEEDING a cig
942960060740919301 2017-12-18 03:29:32 UTC <trealace> I trapped a pregnant cat today around like 5:30 & the people Ive been working with to trap have already found her a home!
942531828736495616 2017-12-17 23:07:54 UTC <trealace> I just dont know how to tell my roommate that hes sloppy & lazy
942531758142246912 2017-12-17 23:07:37 UTC <trealace> I just wrote & deleted a long complainy tweet but Im like okay 1. No one cares & 2. Were not gonna be like that on twitter today
942259104868978688 2017-12-16 05:04:11 UTC <trealace> Since Cookie was found by people working with Neuter Scooter, I got to talk to the doctor about where I found her & told her about the colony out there & she got a Trap, Neuter, Return  team on the case 
942254044822802433 2017-12-16 04:44:05 UTC <trealace> So as much as we all loved & will miss Cookie around here, my sister has decided to take her in. Kaleb told Santa he wanted her for Christmas. Im very happy that I havent seen the last of her & that shell be G & Bs kitty cousin

941484648542167040 2017-12-14 01:46:46 UTC <trealace> @oddschaub Before I saw your tweet I was actually gonna tweet about how playing Pets is nice having the animals running around town but its a pain playing as the animal & keeping them happy so i usually put pets in households I dont normally play

Hope the ratings were worth it but I really doubt that. Shit was whack.
941380659100160000 2017-12-14 18:53:33 UTC <trealace> I had to ask my roommate to stop washing the dishes because hes so bad at it that I always have to end up washing them again anyway so Im like fucking just leave it dude dont bother

940477653320126466 2017-12-11 07:05:20 UTC <trealace> No because there are still comics coming out of what some of our fave survivors are up to years AFTER this war & with a major arc beginning in next months issue so they have plenty of material to cover

940459628026126336 2017-12-11 05:53:42 UTC <trealace> & since it happened when I was gone I had to bring each cat individually over to the mess & say What is this, this is naughty blah blah blah & spank them even though Im pretty sure it was 100% the work of Butters
940459189075365888 2017-12-11 05:51:58 UTC <trealace> Came home from work to find ALL my plants (one small evergreen tree, 4 succulents) out of their pots with a big mess of dirt on the carpet & overturned planters so I had to spank some kitty butt & Im not happy about it.
940453517361340417 2017-12-11 05:29:25 UTC <trealace> My roommate does a lot of messy shit that you would expect a grown man to know better than to do but then I have to remember straight men are fucking clueless.
939661219383914497 2017-12-09 01:01:07 UTC <trealace> Its still early but Im pretty sure I aint doin shit tonight but playing #TheSims
939547456131485696 2017-12-09 17:29:04 UTC <trealace> Butters is still warming up to Miss Kitty, he was mean to her last night & bopping her on the head. Gs curious & excited to have something going on.

939333031780868096 2017-12-08 03:17:01 UTC <trealace> @Cosmokelso0o It was easy too! I had a big box with food in it & she just walked right in, I closed it up & took her to my car. & now I see shes been taken to Neuter Scooter before so she was more trusting. That silver tabby Ive been stalking is pregnant  so still plan to go back for her

936325694405206016 2017-11-30 20:06:56 UTC <trealace> Snuggled me in bed this morning & wouldnt let me get up.. probably because he wanted to stall me from seeing that he knocked the tree over & scattered some ornaments around. Had to give him a spankin but were cool.pic.twitter.com/ryB5gV2ocH

935744500785434624 2017-11-28 05:37:28 UTC <trealace> @Jennuhtals Raelynn Lace.. obviously love that they wanted to use my middle name but Im like.. we can do better.
935726456394649600 2017-11-28 04:25:46 UTC <trealace> The name they had picked out for a girl was some straight HILLBILLY ASS SHIT
935725243821420544 2017-11-28 04:20:57 UTC <trealace> My sisters having a baby boy & his dad wants his name to be something common like a straight up (boring) American name. Ive been giving them suggestions but they hate all my weird names that I pick out..
935695622849597441 2017-11-28 02:23:15 UTC <trealace> That being said, FUCK Johnny Depp. Yeah you were hot in the 80s. Yeah you did iconic shit. You had your time. Now move the fuck over & let someone less problematic shine. Im not gonna forget you beat the shit out of your wife cause I think youre cute & love Tim Burton movies
935693905236054017 2017-11-28 02:16:26 UTC <trealace> But if he was accused of something shady like sexual assault or domestic abuse its over. I LOVED Louis CK. He inspired me as well as a young comedian but my integrity as a feminist is more important to me & no one gets a pass for exploiting the power fans gave them.
935692053043929088 2017-11-28 02:09:04 UTC <trealace> You guys KNOW how much I love Jeffrey Dean Morgan. I own movie merchandise in his likeness, posters, copies of his films. He is my fucking IDOL. Not just cause hes hot. Hes inspires the fuck out of me as a young actress & human person. I want to model my career after his
935691287482728450 2017-11-28 02:06:01 UTC <trealace> You CANNOT separate the art from the artist. This is who they are. If youre a shitbag who has been found out to abuse his/her power that WE as fans gave to you, youre done. You are replaceable. There is always someone else willing to do the work you do minus the bullshit.
935650515219775488 2017-11-28 23:24:01 UTC <trealace> Im gettin ready to get off work & of course get a table in my section. I asked them not to throw peanut shells on the floor cause I just swept, they were like Well can we sit somewhere else? Thats why we came here. You REALLY feel like you need to throw trash on the floor???
935373893161963520 2017-11-27 05:04:49 UTC <trealace> I got the other side of my nose pierced like 2 weeks ago & I took it out to clean it (i know ur not supposed to mess with it yet but whatever) & I noticed that the hole doesnt match up with the other side & now I have to go get it redone or its gonna bother me forever 
935371491176341505 2017-11-27 04:55:16 UTC <trealace> Kitty knows it wants to come home with me. Its getting used to my voice also comes closer to me than ever before but still skittish, hopefully tomorrow I can try out a new trap.pic.twitter.com/eR17K0pTRt
935234905008730117 2017-11-27 19:52:31 UTC <trealace> @nicholasbane I mean his wife & son are dead in both shows by this point so it would just be him meeting up with the Fear cast I guess? & then explain how he got to Rick which we already kind of know.
935037101191639040 2017-11-26 06:46:31 UTC <trealace> @nicholasbane Okay so the reveal was anti-climatic. Its a completely random TWD character who weve already seen a ton of their backstory, I guess is supposed to join the cast of Fear & hangout on that show for awhile.. Im sure itll still be good but feels like they kinda blew it..
934946611972669440 2017-11-26 00:46:57 UTC <trealace> @nicholasbane Maybe if they wanted to really get into what happened to his family but I think the time for that has passed & would be missing an opportunity to move the story forward. He was a cool guy though, I cant believe he came back.
934932035457740800 2017-11-26 23:49:02 UTC <trealace> This could be so huge & there are so many awesome possibilities with this! I really hope its Madison coming to TWD or Negans backstory in FearTWD. A lot of people are saying they think its Abraham for some reason which.. I just dont think that would be as interesting pic.twitter.com/tmWgtXM3Px

934199267140472833 2017-11-24 23:17:16 UTC <trealace> The bottom line is - you CAN STILL get a girl pregnant from pre-ejaculate even if you dont bust inside her. So yall can stop acting like youve never heard about that happening before.
934198290962436101 2017-11-24 23:13:23 UTC <trealace> Ive had to explain to TOO MANY grown ass dudes over the years what pre-cum is & they act like Im telling them a myth or like theyve never heard about it before..

Youve probably been using the bathroom with this person for awhile & have had no problems until all of a sudden. So what are you worried about her actually doing thats got you so shook?
