971361728008245248 2018-03-07 12:27:37 UTC <DarthPeestains> @KyleKashuv If you don't want to be decisive then stop retweeting right-wing conspiracy theorists, stop parroting the same divisive talking points conservatives have been saying for 40 years and stop pretending this is about taking all guns or that you desparatly need assault rifles to live.

What if one of those countries you listed got the tax break by allowing us to place a strategic military base? Did you think about that? There is a lot of possible scenarios that could have created these deals.
969590204679049217 2018-03-02 15:08:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump But what was the reason they got the lower tax to begin with? You need to consider that before doing anything stupid.   Think, could they possibly be supplying us with something else of value? Like say, Strategic positioning, access to resources?

That's fine, its was called having an opinion and practicing the 1st amendment before our nations political discussion was hijacked by trolls.

961178556247265280 2018-02-07 10:03:20 UTC <DarthPeestains> @JacobAWohl The best thing about this meme is the fact that you have no clue how racist it is.

960928650618195969 2018-02-06 17:30:18 UTC <DarthPeestains> @chondram I feel sorry for you. This means there will be people on TV telling the truth about Trump's crimes.

960927505237659649 2018-02-06 17:25:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AG8791 Trumps already use that cheesy name little multiple times the only difference is that Adam Schiff really isn't that small. At least not compared to the last two people Trump has used this on. It's a sign that he's just a foggy old man, can't come up with new material.

960575056500977664 2018-02-05 18:05:14 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FinancialTimes @pontus1948 @l_lorianna @Kmast66 Yeah the people who are really focused on sending everyone's kid to college can't read.
960574962036854785 2018-02-05 18:04:52 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FinancialTimes @pontus1948 @l_lorianna If you really meant that then you would have never specifically called out CNN in your earlier tweet. I'm quite certain you get your news from some shady ass website that feeds you what you want to hear. Also it was Reagan first deregulated the news media just before Fox appeared
960574117182410753 2018-02-05 18:01:30 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FinancialTimes @Afterseven @tomjd @JANETCANARY Janet, we both know that everything you tweeted was a lie that you tell yourself simply because to you politics is a team sport.
960573966980182017 2018-02-05 18:00:54 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FinancialTimes @Afterseven @tomjd @JANETCANARY Wrong, your own tweets prove that you don't want the Constitution you simply want a place where you can force everyone to think and be the way you want them to be.

960549231642726400 2018-02-05 16:22:37 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FinancialTimes @Afterseven @JANETCANARY @tomjd You mean you want a safe space where conservatives can tell everybody what to do, what God to believe in and how much money it will take to get to heaven.

960548028619939841 2018-02-05 16:17:50 UTC <DarthPeestains> @thehill @SandyBeach727 The reason is Trump has lived his whole life with the expectation that he can do anything he wants and is completely above the law. That mentality, along with serveral other issues, has led to his many sexual assaults.

960539811068153857 2018-02-05 15:45:11 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Honestly, at this point it's probably not a good idea for us to follow through with any of your plans.

960519583160569856 2018-02-05 14:24:48 UTC <DarthPeestains> @axios @literide Collusion is another word for conspiracy, Trump committed a conspiracy against the United States. So when you say collusion didn't happen you're kind of right but he still going to jail.

960517825667522561 2018-02-05 14:17:49 UTC <DarthPeestains> @StephenMilIer @literide I will answer this for you. If law enforcement is critical of Trump they are bad, if they mindlessly accept anything that Trump & the GOP serve them they are ok.
960517454366691329 2018-02-05 14:16:21 UTC <DarthPeestains> @DineshDSouza @literide Your memo failed in the fact that you're trying to keep it alive makes me giggle.
960517257133744130 2018-02-05 14:15:34 UTC <DarthPeestains> @axios @WeThePeopleWon @literide It's not partisan.

959495361978163200 2018-02-02 18:34:55 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump How much to you pay to have them write this pile of garbage for you?
959494336252665856 2018-02-02 18:30:50 UTC <DarthPeestains> @mrilliano13 They were followed and it wouldn't have mattered what the memo says you're just going to claim this kind of crap anyway. The investigation into page was legal and before the campaign. Trump committed treason, your party is complicit.
959493477707993093 2018-02-02 18:27:26 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Doug625 @krisp__y You're right, once we get everyone involved with Trump's conspiracy against America prosecuted and jailed hopefully the country can move forward.
959493324162981890 2018-02-02 18:26:49 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 @Doug625 It's not in mindlessly denying it is not going to save your party. The memos show nothing but legal actions by the intelligence community investigating a conspiracy against the United States and Trump's in the center of it. You got nothing Doug.
959492962525876224 2018-02-02 18:25:23 UTC <DarthPeestains> @WendyPriest And the right is disregarding the fact that Trump committed treason.

959492230594678785 2018-02-02 18:22:28 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Doug625 @WendyPriest The memo proves there was enough evidence to warrant a fisa investigation multiple times on Carter page and all started long before Trump's campaign. That makes surveillance of him legal. Trump should have hired better people.
959491884237361154 2018-02-02 18:21:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Doug625 @jordie_ray Except that it doesn't in any way prove anything other than the investigation into Page was legal.
959491521660751872 2018-02-02 18:19:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @NancyPelosi @Doug625 @RealCandaceO Actually that's not true and you're incredibly bitter and vindictive. I feel bad for your family.
959491123457744900 2018-02-02 18:18:04 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 @Doug625 Except that it doesn't in any way shape or form and only shows that the investigation into Carter page was 100% legal and warranted. You won't believe that because you don't want it to be true but it is.
959490035740487680 2018-02-02 18:13:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @StephenAtHome @KalishJantzen Congratulations, with all of the stupid ideas on this planet that people try to fool others with you fell for the most ridiculous ones. That's a talent not many have.
959489220040589313 2018-02-02 18:10:31 UTC <DarthPeestains> @RepMattGaetz Matt, you are a traitor and now everybody knows it. The evidence of Donald Trump's long life of crime and connections to Russia won't just disappear. Everyone who is part of this conspiracy is going to jail.

959488324040843264 2018-02-02 18:06:57 UTC <DarthPeestains> @GOP @Jim_Jordan @justridelow @mrilliano13 The fact is Carter page was under a fisa warrant since 2013.
959488154846814208 2018-02-02 18:06:17 UTC <DarthPeestains> @mrilliano13 You're deliberately misleading people about the memo. I guess that's not surprising because the memo itself it's just propaganda.
959487925045153793 2018-02-02 18:05:22 UTC <DarthPeestains> @DonaldJTrumpJr @jaimemaga45 @retiredarnp13 There's plenty of reason comrade
959487748582379520 2018-02-02 18:04:40 UTC <DarthPeestains> @khholbrook @jaimemaga45 A cherry picked memo of half facts written in part by the president himself is not proof of anything except the GOPs corruption.
959487164475158528 2018-02-02 18:02:21 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 You are saying lock them up but you're retweeting someone whose father pled guilty as part of the conspiracy in which the Mueller investigation is focusing on. Hope that works out for you.
959486871964352512 2018-02-02 18:01:11 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 The memo only shows that the fisa warrant was legal and it began long before Trump's campaign.
959486709237997568 2018-02-02 18:00:32 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 Mueller plans on it.
959486647627902976 2018-02-02 18:00:17 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jaimemaga45 They did. They were conspiring with Nunes this entire time. The memo was written to push a specific narrative that is not true but beneficial to Trump. Sadly this will not erase his many years of money laundering
959486377846104064 2018-02-02 17:59:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Scribd @Jim_Jordan @HappyChichester @jaimemaga45 Its a fact that Russia attacked our election and are actively misleading American citizens on social media right now.
959485876194742273 2018-02-02 17:57:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Jim_Jordan Jim, this idiotic plan failed. Your party looks ridiculous right now. Just give it a rest. #RemoveNunes #TheResistance #ReleaseTheMemo #MemoDay
959482587650674688 2018-02-02 17:44:09 UTC <DarthPeestains> What we know about the memo so far:  - Carter Page was under surveillance long before the campaign started  - His activity gave the FISA court cause to renew the warrant multiple times  - Devin Nunes is incredibly stupid  #ReleaseTheMemo #RemoveNunes

959463122435297280 2018-02-02 16:26:49 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Every1s_Mama @chuckwoolery The only worthwhile information in the memo is that they were able to renew the fisa warrant against Carter Page multiple times which means he was definitely up to no good. Sorry Chuckles.

I have no doubt that in the end DACA will be protected and the wall will just be a fading idea in the mind of a very sad and demented man. /E
956153917804511233 2018-01-24 13:17:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> This deal was also made to McConnell's caucus which makes it a lot harder for him to go back on. Keep in mind the GOP set the scenario up so Democrats would have to choose between DACA and CHIP allowing the GOP to sell a narrative that the Dems had neglected whichever one...
956153916068171776 2018-01-24 13:17:12 UTC <DarthPeestains> I am aware you already know this about him but the people who need to see this are the people in the middle who did not go out to vote in November of 2016. The other factor about this deal most people don't understand is that it wasn't just between McConnell and Schumer...
956153914478465026 2018-01-24 13:17:12 UTC <DarthPeestains> Republicans had two things they could use as leverage in these negotiations. They just lost one and have to renegotiate in two weeks. During those two weeks McConnell has to bring up this vote or admit that he is a crooked bastard who doesn't care about DREAMERS...
956153911949348865 2018-01-24 13:17:11 UTC <DarthPeestains> Democrats need to stop pushing the Republican narrative about this shutdown deal.

952145331004768256 2018-01-13 11:48:31 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChillliePenguin @WGmantra You are only trying to validate your fear and confusion. Do everyone a favor, grow up, turn off Fox News and start thinking for yourself.
952145146652581888 2018-01-13 11:47:47 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Turnbullovls10 @WGmantra There is no ongoing white genocide except in the fantasy land of your mind. Your inability to denounce groups like the KKK who are vocally white supremacist shows your bias. You are just trying to validate your own fear and confusion.
952144825549316096 2018-01-13 11:46:31 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChillliePenguin @WGmantra You need to seek professional help. Right-wing spin masters have misled you by manipulating your fear. You are no longer able to think for yourself.
952144487614222336 2018-01-13 11:45:10 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Turnbullovls10 @WGmantra Nobody is anti-white. You don't even know what skin color I am yet you've already claimed I am out to get you. This is a form of psychosis.
952144039209467905 2018-01-13 11:43:23 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChillliePenguin @WGmantra This is a lie. You are only saying it because you are scared. Listen to me, no one is out to get you and the people telling you there is are deliberately trying to misinform you.
952143799098249216 2018-01-13 11:42:26 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Turnbullovls10 @WGmantra You are simply repeating the same defeated arguments the right has been making for decades.
952143265159053312 2018-01-13 11:40:19 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChillliePenguin @WGmantra After rich white Southerners were told they can no longer own people and get free labor they started coming up with lies to discredit the ideology that defeated them. You are just repeating those fabrications. Relax, no one is out to get you.
952142068293529600 2018-01-13 11:35:33 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChillliePenguin @WGmantra No, we push for a non-racist society in our country because 200 years ago a few rich white people convinced a lot of poor white people that it was morally acceptable to own brown people. What you posted is an excuse so you don't have to face that fact.

951058279811207168 2018-01-10 11:48:58 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TexasStrongVET The travel ban can't work. It doesn't ban anyone from countries that actually attack America. And it allows anyone to come in from countries that Trump does business with. All it does is force would be terrorists to buy one extra plane ticket. Pathetic.
951058037250371584 2018-01-10 11:48:00 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TexasStrongVET Only if you're still in middle school.

951057731036897280 2018-01-10 11:46:47 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TexasStrongVET Except he will because he is a weakling. That's also how I know that you are just a kid. Every adult watched Trump act like a scumbag through the 70s 80s 90s 2000s and 2010s, only spoiled, angry children support him.
951057292593688578 2018-01-10 11:45:03 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TexasStrongVET Right next to Donald Trump.

951045466413780994 2018-01-10 10:58:03 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FLGovScott @SecretaryZinke Ryan Zinke excluded Florida from offshore drilling because its a red state and home to one if Trumps lackluster golf clubs.  It also helped that Governor Scott is not only a Trump bootlicker but one of the most depraved and sick individuals in the GOP.

949598262977318914 2018-01-06 11:07:23 UTC <DarthPeestains> @CandiceAiston I don't support @SenGillibrand because she can be too easily manipulated by GOP operatives. In calling for his resignation and avoiding the ethics investigation she did an injustice to him and his possible victims while providing a road map to avoid punishment for other offenders
949591431445991424 2018-01-06 10:40:14 UTC <DarthPeestains> @USUN @nikkihaley Hey Nikki, Yemen and Puerto Rico wanted to let you know that they think you're two-faced partisan hack who is politicizing human rights while working for a regime that steps on them.
949589941130063872 2018-01-06 10:34:19 UTC <DarthPeestains> This tweet proves something I've been trying to convince people of for decades, the @GOP are traitors to America. Thanks guys, I couldn't have done it without you.
949563820913102848 2018-01-06 08:50:31 UTC <DarthPeestains> @HillaryClinton @stevlucas It's okay to make assumptions about Trump supporters, they already made asses of themselves when they voted for a fraud and a traitor.

Trump was a terrible student according to his professors at Wharton. You have no proof that he is successful businessman without seeing his taxes.

949553680512110595 2018-01-06 08:10:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> @RealJamesWoods If Trump had even a shred of dignity, decency or intelligence inside of his pea brain he would go to prove them wrong.

949353869141856256 2018-01-05 18:56:15 UTC <DarthPeestains> @dylanlscott This is the political equivalent of the GOP lighting a stick of dynamite but forgetting to throw it.

949340779763392512 2018-01-05 18:04:14 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChuckGrassley Considering they'll be moving to impeach our traitor president I think it's safe to assume you won't be very helpful at all.
949340526897229825 2018-01-05 18:03:14 UTC <DarthPeestains> @ChuckGrassley Chuck Grassley allows Donald J Trump to live above the law simply because he has decided to call himself a Republican this year. Do not listen to anything this hypocrite has to say.

The vast majority of wealth gained from the welfare for the wealthy tax cut will spend eternity in an upper 1% bank account gaining interest.

Fact: You can't admit this even though you its true. Fact: All evidence points to Trump sharing many of Jefferies desires. Fact: You define your personality with hate towards Clintons. That makes you the villain.
947522568306790400 2017-12-31 17:39:19 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump @thedivuh Yep, and for the first time in a generation locusts haven't swarmed my village at harvest time. To no surprise there is literally zero liberal media coverage.
947521948006998017 2017-12-31 17:36:51 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jayne2048 Its perfectly ok when the subject not only fat shames people themselves but considers themselves to be the perfect example of fitness as well as superior to everyone else on Earth.

947519165312598016 2017-12-31 17:25:47 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Its December 31st, tomorrow is New years day and your the most infamous human on Earth just like you always wanted. How about you try not posting anymore inflammatory propaganda for 24 hours and show us you appreciate your good fortune.
947511746293653506 2017-12-31 16:56:18 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Also, not a single shark attack in Kansas since Trumps been in office, just another accomplishment those whacky libs refuse to acknowledge.
947495888729071616 2017-12-31 15:53:18 UTC <DarthPeestains> @SheriffClarke @_Lisah @MLeanus You just had to lie to yourself to explain why Trump is less popular than Hillary.   Think about that, you have never once seen a single shred of proof of those claims yet you repeated them.

947493384851247105 2017-12-31 15:43:21 UTC <DarthPeestains> @SheriffClarke Yea, there's nothing more terrifying than than a washed up old fart with delusions of being a cowboy who wears medals of honor he bought from Amazon.

947490931720249344 2017-12-31 15:33:36 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump @ripskull Only angry privlaged white 13 year old boys tweeting from mom & dad's house accuse everyone of not having jobs. I hope you find better things to do once Christmas vacation is over.   Also, its a fact Trumps made a lot if money from the office, nice try but you failed.
947476700740321280 2017-12-31 14:37:03 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Everything you listed is complete bullshit.

947454299285712896 2017-12-31 13:08:02 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Is this serious?   DONALD TRUMP AND THE GOP ARE STEALING AMERICAN  MONEY WHILE TRYING TO CRUSH DISSENT AND PROTEST!

947451499000598528 2017-12-31 12:56:54 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Now that Trump is giving our money to himself and his donors we are all free to get 2nd, 3rd and 4th JOBS JOBS JOBS to survive.
947450672710148097 2017-12-31 12:53:37 UTC <DarthPeestains> @SheriffClarke I like how in this meme and the inncident on the plane you need help from someone else to solve a problem a real cop could solve on their own.
947189774384861184 2017-12-30 19:36:54 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump If you were going for the world's most outrageously hypocritical tweet then I have to say, good show my man.
947188963000901633 2017-12-30 19:33:41 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump I see someone's moved on to the next distraction. It's been a busy week, USPS, Democrats, Amazon, now Iran. I wonder who he's going to attack next, maybe the Girl Scouts, or leprechauns! Who knows!

But I agree with the two comments that it will take a comprehensive hybrid of both to succeed.
947140131621830656 2017-12-30 16:19:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @POTUS @cvpayne @FoxNews Everything he has done in office has been negative which leaves only one question. What bogus entertainment news channel that specializes in bashing Obama is this positive 1/3 coming from?pic.twitter.com/WdVtvSl2fH

947120619480600576 2017-12-30 15:02:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman States rights is just a term rich plantation owners used to excuse their practice of kidnapping people and forcing them to work for free.
947120419290648576 2017-12-30 15:01:19 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @TimberGhost7 @LeonidasBowman If socialism hasn't been successful than capitalism hasn't been either.
947120120173879297 2017-12-30 15:00:07 UTC <DarthPeestains> @Cernovich @stweetnsour @phlubup @PostOrwellian @LeonidasBowman They didn't stand for their homes. A tiny percentage of rich Plantation holders fooled poor white workers into believing that allowing plantation owners to get rich off of free labor would somehow help with those white people. It was brainwashing of stupid people.
947119919581286401 2017-12-30 14:59:20 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman They tried to destroy the union because they were told they can't get rich off of kidnapping and murder. There is nothing closer to trying to overthrow the government than that.
947119458279190528 2017-12-30 14:57:30 UTC <DarthPeestains> @WilliamHGTaylo1 @phlubup @LeonidasBowman The term participation trophy was actually made by the right as an insult to schools that don't focus on competitiveness. The irony is those statues are actual participation trophies because they didn't win.
947118939905110018 2017-12-30 14:55:26 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @pres_zaphod @LeonidasBowman We knew that middle part already.
947118779758149633 2017-12-30 14:54:48 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman No, they started a war with our country because they didn't like the fact they were being told they couldn't use free labor anymore. States rights was only about the right to own other people.
947118247140298753 2017-12-30 14:52:41 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman In your next tweet you accuse the person of being a baby murderer, how is not that not exactly the same as what you're complaining about here?
947118054537879555 2017-12-30 14:51:55 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @bend_time @LeonidasBowman Abortion was only added to the conservative agenda in the 70s because they don't actually have any political stance besides taking all the money for themselves. They just needed a way to fool religious zealots into voting for them.
947117743144304640 2017-12-30 14:50:41 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman The entire conservative agenda is the destruction of Liberty. Liberals think all religions should be allowed, you think only Christianity should be. But please keep running your mouth, you make your agenda look as foolish as your comments.
947117437329211392 2017-12-30 14:49:28 UTC <DarthPeestains> @phlubup @LeonidasBowman You wouldn't walk by a statue of someone who started a war with America to enslave white people so please don't expect black people to do the same.

947116945307992064 2017-12-30 14:47:31 UTC <DarthPeestains> @LeonidasBowman BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  If there is one thing this tweet tells us it's that you know it's true.
947116782384484358 2017-12-30 14:46:52 UTC <DarthPeestains> @LeonidasBowman The resistance isn't fighting the US government. They're fighting a conspiracy started by Trump and the GOP to turn the country into a dictatorship. Stop spreading lies and propaganda.
947116474736500737 2017-12-30 14:45:38 UTC <DarthPeestains> @LeonidasBowman Considering the amount of time you spend complaining about a capitalist government you pretend to be part of, one could accuse you of being a socialist as well.
947115242756112385 2017-12-30 14:40:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @RepDeSantis @RuffusMD Barack Obama doesn't use his middle name in daily life. Neither do you. But you cannot mention Obama without bringing up the H which stands for Hussain. You think by attaching it to him you will fool us into believing he is a Muslim. You do this because you are racist.
947109709626204161 2017-12-30 14:18:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @mmfa @Shareblue @LeonidasBowman You're as pathetic as the freaky end times church you belong to.
947109061849468928 2017-12-30 14:16:11 UTC <DarthPeestains> @LeonidasBowman You just throw out stupid accusations because you have nothing to back up any of your arguments. You're about as American as the Russian money that Trump laundered.
947108632965107714 2017-12-30 14:14:29 UTC <DarthPeestains> @LeonidasBowman You're just reflecting what you know to be true about yourself onto others to deflect blame. You support a man who is guilty of conspiring against Americans, you know its true.
947072545718767617 2017-12-30 11:51:05 UTC <DarthPeestains> @veteranhank Nope, you sound like every other conservative who's too afraid to admit that he's wrong. We've come across your type many times before. Don't worry though, we don't judge you harshly, we just feel pity for you.

946814739207933955 2017-12-29 18:46:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FoxBusiness @mattgaetz is just trying to cover for the fact that his political party is involved in a conspiracy against the United States. No one is taking him seriously and he will be voted out of office in his next election.

944364011109404673 2017-12-22 00:28:20 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump The individual mandate is a conservative idea right out of the Heritage Foundation. The only reason it was included was to get Republican politicians on board and it is hilarious that it is been they're only real subject of contention. You guys can't govern for shit.

Also, Trump would never sue anyone over that allegation because the discovery part of the trial would expose all of the evidence in the dossier. You backed the wrong horse pal.
943863220984573952 2017-12-21 15:18:22 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Because Obama saved us from a yet another horrible republican economy given to us by Bush. And your petty game of doing the opposite just because he's a better man is going to lead us to another recession.
943862920877887488 2017-12-21 15:17:11 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Considering you're a liar, coward, and a traitor with a hostile attitude towards most Americans it's really not a bad idea.

943835314476474368 2017-12-21 13:27:29 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump If they've been able to give out raises this entire time but have been holding them back as leverage to get a tax break because their shareholders don't get to buy a fifth home this year they're actually just greedy scumbags.

Between gerrymandering, voter suppression and Russian interference the Republicans don't need to worry about blatantly stealing from the public. Thanks for letting Trump trample the constitution Susan! 
943834123759648770 2017-12-21 13:22:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @SenatorCollins Or you could take the windfall you just handed yourself and buy an orphanage then force the children to watch a bulldozer plow it down with the few toys they own still inside. In fact that would make a great campaign event, your donors would love it!

Because having money first makes them better than you in the eyes of conservatives. They are making an aristocracy of the dollar where only those who worship money can live in dignity
943491933820858369 2017-12-20 14:43:00 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is the biggest liar in America.

943150878793625600 2017-12-19 16:07:47 UTC <DarthPeestains> @SpeakerRyan Ayn Rand was a terrible author and the worst possible hero a teenage Paul Ryan could have ever come across. The legacy you two have been trying to build on the backs of working Americans will be destroyed and all of history will remember the both of you as our worst villains.

940577770958217221 2017-12-12 13:43:10 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Do you understand how disingenuous it is to call her disloyal to people you insulted in the same sentence?  What am I saying of course you don't.  Disingenuous; adj - not candid or sincere, typically by pretending that one knows less about something than one really does.

I suggest adding deep fried bacon butter sticks to the menu for cardiovascular health. And don't worry about exercise, that's a myth, fake news.

939923026300325888 2017-12-10 18:21:27 UTC <DarthPeestains> Trump put out a phony everything. Persona, life, campaign, finances, all fake.

939916647879593991 2017-12-10 17:56:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> So the report is that Trump drinks gallons of Coke a day. I've seen people seriously mess up their digestive tract by only drinking Coca-Cola so all I can really say to this is...  Drink up Mr President, cheers!  In fact, I heard Obama drinks twice as much Coca-Cola as you. 
939865747475632129 2017-12-10 14:33:50 UTC <DarthPeestains> @davidmweissman The large majority of trump supporters in America hate Jewish people and spread conspiracy theories that you controlled media the money and the globe. The fact that you would align yourself with people like that makes us believe that what you say might not be true.
939864964977823745 2017-12-10 14:30:44 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @MakowskiPete @larryelder Larry knows that Obama's original plan was to put in single-payer and he also knows that the Republicans dug their heels into the ground until he changed it to the mandate because that idea was created by the GOP and instituted in Massachusetts. Stop distorting the truth.

938429853472354305 2017-12-06 15:28:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TrumpRealty @Trump @Briinthesprings If you really were a forensic psychologist you would understand that Mueller has other charges he can hit Flynn with if there is a pardon. And no Mueller is running a Flawless investigation, you are just upset that it's against Trump.

938428923548962816 2017-12-06 15:24:25 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TrumpRealty @Trump @Briinthesprings Also Mueller didn't hit Flynn with all of the charges in case there is a pardon. They can get him afterward and the family at a state level and avoid pardons all together.
938427772963303424 2017-12-06 15:19:50 UTC <DarthPeestains> @TrumpRealty @Trump @Briinthesprings Trump cannot use his pardon power to impede an investigation. If you actually were a forensic investigator you would most likely know this already.

935229097390768128 2017-11-27 19:29:27 UTC <DarthPeestains> Fun fact: When aquiring kompromat on a target, you learn their darkest desires while gaining their friendship then exploit both. Often this allows for the mark to be led in directions far more sinister than they may have gone without your influence.  #TrumpRussia

933321233336332288 2017-11-22 13:08:16 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump The idea that you think we believe you're doing any work other than conspiring with your accomplices is more indicative of your growing mental illness than this morning's unhinged Twitter tantrum. #TrumpRussia

931264336940503041 2017-11-16 20:54:54 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @_rebase @rezionet @Depauw07054111 @CaptainFlyboi I love hearing Trophy Hunters excuses for the fact that they are literally sociopaths. Ted Bundy used to like to kill an innocent animals as well. There is no difference between you.
931261686425833472 2017-11-16 20:44:22 UTC <DarthPeestains> @KassandraSeven @loria_dawson Thank you for pointing that out I was wondering why Trump won't stop babbling.

931256166419755008 2017-11-16 20:22:26 UTC <DarthPeestains> @StevenTDennis Or better yet imagine if that picture showed any actual wrongdoing other than a sad attempt at being funny.

931237648248733696 2017-11-16 19:08:51 UTC <DarthPeestains> @papicek HAHAHAHA and the troll exposes himself. Way to lose all credibility asshole.
931236838366433280 2017-11-16 19:05:38 UTC <DarthPeestains> @papicek Also with a shiny attitude like that I don't think I want to be in a big tent with you either.
931236675484901382 2017-11-16 19:04:59 UTC <DarthPeestains> @papicek I'm forced to assume you are a troll that's feeding into the distractions so that they could get everyone to focus on Franken and not the tax cuts.
931236164425670657 2017-11-16 19:02:57 UTC <DarthPeestains> @papicek You played right into their hands.
931236086315208705 2017-11-16 19:02:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @papicek They just passed the tax bill while you were throwing Franken under the bus, good job.
931235664389165056 2017-11-16 19:00:58 UTC <DarthPeestains> Hey, while everyone fell into the Franken trap that the conservative set for you they were able to pass the tax bill. #whoopsie
931232650194509824 2017-11-16 18:48:59 UTC <DarthPeestains> There's a better link out there, 1 sec.
931231619922518017 2017-11-16 18:44:54 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jerweber @TheGreatCarnac @AltNatSecAgency ... so please don't try to turn what I say into some type of Defense of molesters and sexist assholes because it isn't. It's a critique of the left's ability to bend in whichever direction the right wants them to. Now go back to your other account.
931231413650771969 2017-11-16 18:44:05 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jerweber @TheGreatCarnac @AltNatSecAgency I never said what he did was right I said that Democrats immediately jumping at the very first drop of blood in the water and giving in to what the Republicans want is the issue. Franken called for an investigation into himself. Exactly what I expected from him...
931227706741743617 2017-11-16 18:29:21 UTC <DarthPeestains> Look what we handed Roy Moore, a free pass! https://twitter.com/MooreSenate/status/931222390821941248

931223739659931654 2017-11-16 18:13:35 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep You are helping the Republicans make a false equivalence between their behavior and the Democrats to distract from the Moore controversy and the massive tax cuts. Great job.
931223326193864704 2017-11-16 18:11:56 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep She might be right, he might be right, but there is literally nothing here but he said she said there being too much tongue in a scripted kiss. A scripted kiss. I'm going to repeat that one more time for you a scripted kiss. Explain to me right now the rules of a scripted kiss?
931222692702900226 2017-11-16 18:09:25 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep I see what you're trying to do, its not working.
931222151738417154 2017-11-16 18:07:16 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep Would The Washington Post have run the Moore story with testimony from only one witness and no corroboration?
931221478040920065 2017-11-16 18:04:36 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep Only if you are using that story as a way to get someone to quit their job. At that point I might ask for something to back it up. But I would ask the same thing if they made the accusation against you.
931221090726277122 2017-11-16 18:03:03 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep No, I'm not. I wouldn't believe a liberal TV pundit making an accusation against a Republican with no real proof and suspicious timing. Why would I go ahead and believe a republican pundit in the same situation it makes no sense.
931220444950204416 2017-11-16 18:00:29 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec But we shouldn't argue about it because the Republicans already got what they want, the Democrats are now completely equivalent to the Republicans as far as sexual behavior and we did it for them because an ex SNL cast member took an extremely distasteful photo, yay us.
931219875678294016 2017-11-16 17:58:14 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec You throwing the guy under the bus after the very first accusation and the only proof is a photo that shows no touching but a disturbing attempt at a joke. You wanna say that sexist humor is horrible, go for it. But saying he is a sexual preditor is a bit too early.
931218174556635138 2017-11-16 17:51:28 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec @roguebarkeep In a situation where a Fox news pundit was kissed during a scripted kiss and her evidence is a photo that doesn't show a crime I am forced to wait for more evidence because that shit stinks.
931217621357342720 2017-11-16 17:49:16 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec If the accusation comes from the left it needs a team of professional investigators to cover very single detail & even then it won't be taken seriously, if it comes from the right it merely needs to be written down for the left to concede. That's exploited by the right daily.
931216126364831749 2017-11-16 17:43:20 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AltHomelandSec Any particular reason?

931212587928301573 2017-11-16 17:29:16 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jerweber @texasfed @TheGreatCarnac The fake liberal accounts are out in force this morning. Its almost like they knew ahead of time that a Pundit from fox had a shady story to drop.
931211013705359361 2017-11-16 17:23:01 UTC <DarthPeestains> @jerweber @TheGreatCarnac Using too much tongue in a scripted kiss versus trolling malls to pick up children. You're not a liberal and there is no equivalency.
931208595122814977 2017-11-16 17:13:24 UTC <DarthPeestains> To everyone who is ready to throw Franken under the bus to prove how bipartisan you can be before any type of corroborating evidence comes out I'd like you to know that you could save yourself a lot of time by simply donating straight to the Trump campaign. Please send cash.

931205411776221186 2017-11-16 17:00:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> @B52Malmet Photo shows no contact, just a horribly sexist attempt at humor.  The kiss was in a script that they both were in.  The Roy Moore story came out after deep corroboration of the accusations, I'm giving Al at very least the same chance Roy had before placing him under the bus.
931198589379973121 2017-11-16 16:33:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @morepeace2017 @LeeannTweeden @AWGecko But also, no contact.

Time to forget about the Donalds well documented admitted history of sexual assault and pretend we are warriors for women's rights!

Clearly this is your alt troll account. Blocked too. 2. That story provides zero evidence or corroboration. 3. Moore's story had 30 people on record before it broke, there is a major difference. 4. He's not groping her in that picture, there's no contact.
931191847506063360 2017-11-16 16:06:51 UTC <DarthPeestains> Looks like Franken might be a threat to the GOP in 2020. Read this full story.https://twitter.com/LeeannTweeden/status/931176738586890241

Your timeline has lots of Moore defense and that's a highly corroborated story. This one, while still deserving to be taken seriously, is extremely under corroborated at this time. You are obviously overcompensating for Trump & Moore.

930505547157266432 2017-11-14 18:39:45 UTC <DarthPeestains> GOP questions, "How evil is Hillary? How softly do you like your ass kissed?"  DEM questions, "Why did you commit obvious perury? Why refuse to answer questions?"  Sessions testimony, "I'm an elderly white Southern gentleman that speaks politely so perjury doesn't apply to me."
930478682778619904 2017-11-14 16:53:00 UTC <DarthPeestains> Today's hearing with Jeff Sessions has been a shining example that the GOP has given up on all American values at the slight glimmer of hope that they can take full control the country and model us after Russia.

Just as many people needlessly died at the hands of Christianity and Catholicism as they did Islam. Admit it, it doesn't make them evil, just the people who misuse them to deceive others, like you do.

927866440442671104 2017-11-07 11:52:52 UTC <DarthPeestains> @DonaldJTrumpJr The grease in your hair is finally seeping into your brain and it's making you think you know something about the Gods you've been ignoring.
927866130915524608 2017-11-07 11:51:39 UTC <DarthPeestains> @DonaldJTrumpJr Actually many Democrats are hard-working God-fearing Americans and you're mocking them so maybe you should stop being an instigator.

927850562552557568 2017-11-07 10:49:47 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump It sounds like you know that they are following Kushners plans that he made with them last week on his secret trip to Saudi Arabia

927849301031686145 2017-11-07 10:44:46 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump You are a liar and a fraud. Your tax cuts will only benefit you and your wealthy friends. Stop trying to lie we know the facts...
927849124149497857 2017-11-07 10:44:04 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Your Administration has passed zero legislation that would affect it so you get to claim zero credit.
927662594315444230 2017-11-06 22:22:52 UTC <DarthPeestains> @NexusProxy It sounds like youre saying its not controlled enough, point well taken.

927506173494026240 2017-11-06 12:01:18 UTC <DarthPeestains> @realDonaldTrump Mental illness is lusting power, wealth & revenge to such a point that you think of ways to spin a tragedy to fit your political narrative.
927493364223750145 2017-11-06 11:10:24 UTC <DarthPeestains> @AbbeyRivers @davidfrum Crazier thought: The NRA\GOP doesn't care what happens as long as they are making profit & will fight any common sense legislation.

927338015239954434 2017-11-05 00:53:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> @FredFlyOver Its a reference to the fact that Trump watched underage prostitutes urinate on a bed in Russia. You voted for him so its your sick problem.

887455499263889408 2017-07-18 23:34:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> 47) To summarize: Greedy people used racism & fake news to confuse  then used nepotism to pass secret bills to steal healthcare from poor
887455210519633922 2017-07-18 23:33:04 UTC <DarthPeestains> 46) Secret health Legislation:  Dr. Woodward was also deeply concerned that the bill had been written over 2 years in total secrecy.

887454538973753344 2017-07-18 23:30:24 UTC <DarthPeestains> 40) Healthcare:  This story would not be complete without the element of poor people losing their most accessible medicine.
887454462482296832 2017-07-18 23:30:06 UTC <DarthPeestains> 39) The chairman of Ways and Means at the time, Robert Doughton, was to no surprise a friend of the Dupont corp & sent the bill to Congress.
887454393318215680 2017-07-18 23:29:50 UTC <DarthPeestains> 38) They are so blatantly racist and false you wonder why we would even keep a law in place created by such a madman.
887454336015577088 2017-07-18 23:29:36 UTC <DarthPeestains> 37) ...garbage that Hurst had been printing as evidence. These articles were fiction at best without any fact checking or integrity.

887453769444855809 2017-07-18 23:27:21 UTC <DarthPeestains> 33) Industrialists like Hurst, DuPont didn't like competition. So they tasked their inside man  Anslinger with getting hemp out of the way.
887453607561498625 2017-07-18 23:26:42 UTC <DarthPeestains> 31) Hemp outproduces trees 4 to 1 in a 20 year period, makes cleaner fuels & plastics and is over 50% of prescribed medicines at the time.
887453542579097601 2017-07-18 23:26:27 UTC <DarthPeestains> 30) In the coming decades to now, products made from these patents & their rail shipments would create the vast majority of Duponts wealth.
887453323288354817 2017-07-18 23:25:35 UTC <DarthPeestains> 29) In 1937 DuPont was set to receive patents for using oil to make plastics and for a process to convert wood pulp to paper.
887453263431421953 2017-07-18 23:25:20 UTC <DarthPeestains> 28) Greed:  Andrew Mellon, DuPont & Harry Anslinger -  A match made in heaven... ...if heaven is all about corruption, money & manipulating
887453120237903873 2017-07-18 23:24:46 UTC <DarthPeestains> 27) To summarize:  A company whose profits would be greatly affected by the booming hemp industry had its men placed in positions of power.
887452982949924864 2017-07-18 23:24:13 UTC <DarthPeestains> 26) *Note that Andrew Mellon was appointed by Harding & is also the major shareholder in one of only 2 banks that DuPont works with.
887452770172887040 2017-07-18 23:23:23 UTC <DarthPeestains> 25) Calculated fake news repeated often has been making people ignorant to the truth since before we were born.
887452714535399424 2017-07-18 23:23:09 UTC <DarthPeestains> 24) ...that almost all of his testimony before congress hearings was racist fake news from tabloids that would literally print anything.

880432154106376192 2017-06-29 14:25:57 UTC <DarthPeestains> @PoliticsOTM The Russian investigation leads to their complete control. Complete control means Democrats can't push legislation through anyway
