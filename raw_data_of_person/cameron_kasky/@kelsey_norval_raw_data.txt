964953388126318592 2018-02-17 20:03:10 UTC <kelsey_norval> Its sad that I have to hide my anxiety and depression medicine from my roommates mom, since she doesnt believe in taking pills, and I dont want her to change her views on me.
964418148404404224 2018-02-16 08:36:19 UTC <kelsey_norval> Also if you didnt know me in high school personally, you will definitely not understand the true meaning of Miss Moody.

954653049460482048 2018-01-20 09:53:18 UTC <kelsey_norval> The extrovert in me is mad for not socializing, but the introvert side is grateful for the solitude of my room.
954554542565158912 2018-01-19 03:21:52 UTC <kelsey_norval> Pretty soon Im going to have to pack and Im not looking forward to that

879881774087548928 2017-06-27 01:58:57 UTC <kelsey_norval> I love how I rationalize smoking as a reward for actually being concerned for my both my physical and mental health
879836084724580352 2017-06-27 22:57:23 UTC <kelsey_norval> Also, I had to get a Pap smear AND a shot. I deserve to smoke after dealing with that

863093711646871552 2017-05-12 18:09:11 UTC <kelsey_norval> Computers on campus take so long to load 
863064164826193920 2017-05-12 16:11:46 UTC <kelsey_norval> Prioritizing sleep over going to class. 2 hours of sleep is not enough to function
862898002477723648 2017-05-11 05:11:30 UTC <kelsey_norval> I just need to let this out, but I seriously haven't felt so alone before until now
862895384179351552 2017-05-11 05:01:06 UTC <kelsey_norval> You ever just start crying because of how much you're failing at life?   No? Just me?

862836166306877440 2017-05-11 01:05:47 UTC <kelsey_norval> Since my friends broke up, one of them have been talking to me more and more.

779119373084528640 2016-09-22 00:45:08 UTC <kelsey_norval> @Knightwolf75 murdering me isn't allowed in this friendship fyi
779119297478000640 2016-09-22 00:44:50 UTC <kelsey_norval> @Knightwolf75 does that mean coming to see me tomorrow when Sydney and I get there? 
779112740744859648 2016-09-22 00:18:47 UTC <kelsey_norval> I think it's because I'm actually moving into a place instead of just living in the dorms...
779112612382412800 2016-09-22 00:18:16 UTC <kelsey_norval> The fact that I'm heading back to school still hasn't hit me really

779047185795026944 2016-09-22 19:58:17 UTC <kelsey_norval> @Knightwolf75 the answer to that would be "most definitely do I miss that sassy guy" if you didn't already know that :P
779046980873953280 2016-09-22 19:57:28 UTC <kelsey_norval> I had a dream @Knightwolf75 was trying to murder me through tweets. Does this mean that I miss him?

775569101884317696 2016-09-12 05:37:37 UTC <kelsey_norval> My anxiety makes me feel like "I need to do everything and please everyone" whereas my depression's like "stop. Let's just ruin everything"
775113452314501120 2016-09-11 23:27:02 UTC <kelsey_norval> In two weeks I'll be back in Ashland and I can't wait tbh
774048447162744832 2016-09-08 00:55:05 UTC <kelsey_norval> Yes, I understand that you love them, but if you can't see it going longer into the future, why?
774048273145344000 2016-09-08 00:54:24 UTC <kelsey_norval> When people say they don't see it working out with someone in the long run, why are you still with them?
773593650294992896 2016-09-07 18:47:53 UTC <kelsey_norval> I miss Ashland. And the people. I just want to see the people I care about

763209358347862016 2016-08-09 03:04:25 UTC <kelsey_norval> I hate those moments where you like someone and you're mad at them but yet you still want to be around them. 
758726303667277824 2016-07-28 18:10:21 UTC <kelsey_norval> Well shit, this was not what I wanted for the summer...
715385182279196673 2016-03-30 03:48:13 UTC <kelsey_norval> So done with people just shitting on everyone. You are not high and mighty.
