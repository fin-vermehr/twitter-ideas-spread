(Forgot to lock door) stood in the doorway to my B.R. & tried to rape me.  He had a gun, but I kept screaming and fighting until I had the gun pointed at him.  That is when he got up & ran.

A boss, a father, a politician, a teacher, etc.  They use that to scare & threaten their victims into not telling. The result is PTSD.

936773534948323328 2017-12-01 01:46:29 UTC <sparks_randi> If it were true then this would be a bill about taxes.  Instead there's a clause saying a fetus is a life at conception.

936418340385558529 2017-11-30 02:15:04 UTC <sparks_randi> @TheRickyDavila @SenateDems time to enact legislation to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches holding political events and trying to pass them off as Church Services!
936412234267463680 2017-11-30 01:50:49 UTC <sparks_randi> @Potomacbeat Better @jimmykimmel than the Pastor where @MooreSenate spoke at last night that held a political event in their church & should be stripped of their tax-exempt status.
936403543875051520 2017-11-30 01:16:17 UTC <sparks_randi> So I suggest that we investigate these fellaas too!  Are they pedophiles too?https://twitter.com/DMW_JD2014/status/936402593189957632
936402443482656768 2017-11-30 01:11:54 UTC <sparks_randi> @SenBobCorker Why not just make churches taxable. They are actively participating in politics which violates their tax-exempt status.  That will help the deficit!!!

935499579184869377 2017-11-28 13:24:15 UTC <sparks_randi> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen @Jamesuwakwe The ACA is a very necessary step in the right direction.  The only reason they are trying to repeal it is because it has Obama's name on it.  They instead should be working with the democrates to fix the problems w/ACA or replace it with medicare for all or better yet Medicaid!
935485884576813056 2017-11-28 12:29:50 UTC <sparks_randi> I just called @senrobportman and told him to Vote NO on Tax Bill.

935482962178723842 2017-11-28 12:18:13 UTC <sparks_randi> I say cut back the tax cut on the wealthy.  Put in a clause that says the bill is PAYGO exempt.

People under $30,000. will end up paying more like they can afford it!  The poor get a 2% tax break while the rich get 35%?  Plus alot of tax breaks for College interest, home deductions...gone!

898769754776780800 2017-08-18 04:53:02 UTC <sparks_randi> @mcspocky And because @realDonaldTrump is card carrying KKK racist that isn't smart enough to shine @POTUS44 boots, so he decided to trash him instead
898768651536523266 2017-08-18 04:48:39 UTC <sparks_randi> @mcspocky Because @POTUS44  publicly humiliated @realDonaldTrump At the WH Press Conf. Dinner in 2009 by making jokes about his weak run against him.

898596755016527874 2017-08-18 17:25:36 UTC <sparks_randi> According to reports Bannon resigned just after Kelly stepped in.  So Trump is just using this to deflect the heat of #Charlottesville

743903090441601025 2016-06-17 20:28:12 UTC <sparks_randi> #TheVoice #RIPChristina Grimmie's Memorial Svc today. I think we should all buy her music and try to make her #1 on I-Tunes.  I did it.

742536336238870528 2016-06-13 01:57:12 UTC <sparks_randi> #Orlando  Media, please stop posting photos & the names of these killers. Infamy is their goal. Take it away! Just call them he or killer.
742531836799258624 2016-06-13 01:39:20 UTC <sparks_randi> @1SteveBurton Thanks for sharing. What beautiful work she does.
742531322795692032 2016-06-13 01:37:17 UTC <sparks_randi> @KatesHighTea @KATELINDER @MakeupPatti Beautiful work I'd love to have it in my home if I could afford it!
741863222660243456 2016-06-11 05:22:30 UTC <sparks_randi> @TheRealGrimmie @NBCTheVoice My heart broke this morning. Such a horrible loss. Prayers to all of her family and her Voice family.
734929250881527808 2016-05-23 02:09:22 UTC <sparks_randi> @BarbraStreisand @alisanporter @NBCTheVoice When I suggested Whitney Last week I never expected to be brought to tears. That was brilliant.
734922204190756864 2016-05-23 01:41:22 UTC <sparks_randi> @LaithAlSaadi @NBCTheVoice Come on all you Baby Boomers show them there is strength in numbers.  Still love that old time Rock N Roll!
734910215766839297 2016-05-23 00:53:44 UTC <sparks_randi> @LaithAlSaadi @adamlevine @NBCTheVoice Best Voice Performance Ever!!!  Way to rock it.
732741727497424896 2016-05-17 01:16:56 UTC <sparks_randi> @haley_pullos Sorry for your loss!
732741311959293956 2016-05-17 01:15:17 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice @alisanporter @nbcthevoice  Make sure your final song is something fierce that everyone knows. Whitney or Carly Simon or Heart.
732738648458833921 2016-05-17 01:04:42 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice @ShalyahFearing Keep doing what you do. You have a beautiful voice.
732738217561231362 2016-05-17 01:02:59 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice @LaithAlSaadi @nbcthevoice I am so happy there are tears. You are awesome! Congrats. Sometimes us older fans let our Voices be heard.

732405389799657474 2016-05-16 03:00:27 UTC <sparks_randi> @NathanFillion ABC just does not get it.  First AMC & OLTL, now Castle.  May have to swear them off 4-ever.
732388932831330304 2016-05-16 01:55:03 UTC <sparks_randi> #TeamBlake  Blake, Mary Sarah should be on your next tour.  You shol producing some of these artists on your own.  Pharrel can help.
732386135217983488 2016-05-16 01:43:56 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice @adamwakefield Such a great job!
732385614029594624 2016-05-16 01:41:52 UTC <sparks_randi> @ShalyahFearing @NBCTheVoice You have a big voice and need to dial it down in duos so you don't overpower the other person like U just did.
732383910877859841 2016-05-16 01:35:06 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice  It's impossible to widdle down to 4, let alone 1.  At least 6 on tonite deserve record contracts right now.  Eyes open Pharrel
732378436082208768 2016-05-16 01:13:20 UTC <sparks_randi> @1SteveBurton Miss you on GH!  I have seen you in your new part and they are not using you to your full potential.  They should.
732376554311954433 2016-05-16 01:05:52 UTC <sparks_randi> @alisanporter @NBCTheVoice Dynamic performance of a really tough song to sing!!  Do some Witney for the Finale!  Give us ultimate Mom power
732373727711772672 2016-05-16 00:54:38 UTC <sparks_randi> @WilliamdeVry1 Sure Baby!  Any special requests?
732372353792024577 2016-05-16 00:49:10 UTC <sparks_randi> @WilliamdeVry1 @latimes @williamdevry1 Such a waste!  Why didn't they contact some ranches and find it a safe home.
732369892352086017 2016-05-16 00:39:23 UTC <sparks_randi> @LaithAlSaadi @Adele @NBCTheVoice I'd buy tickets to see Laith!

727306459168514048 2016-05-02 01:19:07 UTC <sparks_randi> @NBCTheVoice  This season is awesome!  You have at least 6 performers in this top 10 that deserve recording contracts,
