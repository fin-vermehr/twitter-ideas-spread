The Fox News polling team has proven its methods to be as unbiased and thorough as any respected pollster. In other words, completely unlike its namesake news network.

905863037164322818 2017-09-07 18:39:12 UTC <dammit_joe> Man, they sure did a great job sounding as racist as possible in a letter saying they aren't racist.https://twitter.com/jonbernhardt/status/905856895969320963
905857290896633856 2017-09-07 18:16:22 UTC <dammit_joe> @NateSilver538 I totally think like that and I love it, but daaamn does it make life hard in a world where everyone wants 100% assurances about everything.
905825873999355908 2017-09-07 16:11:32 UTC <dammit_joe> @SheaSerrano I never Got It until I read Coates.  Holy fuck was I naive.

903632378047934464 2017-09-01 14:55:22 UTC <dammit_joe> @dwil @HollyAnderson You call him a very good editor, then immediately say he removed all of your owl puns. The cognitive dissonance makes my head spin.
