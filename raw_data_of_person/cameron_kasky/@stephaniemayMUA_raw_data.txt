969768883807817728 2018-03-02 02:58:13 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @DavidCornDC I got one too. And earlier in the week I got a check from Pence written to the RNC to "match" a minimum donation. I filled out one can survey to give them a piece of my mind and now they won't let me alone.
969768215546138624 2018-03-02 02:55:34 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @DavidCornDC @DianaMiller5 I got one too..it's a fundraising email I'm sure..I did a survey once and now they email nonstop. Last week I got a "check" from the VP to match a donation to the RNC in the mail.
962337295809568773 2018-02-10 14:47:45 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @johannhari101 I don't understand why a harm reduction stance is so taboo in so many places. It's the same in the US with proposed safe injection sites.

He was in the FBIs radar since 2013...and the dossier was not the only source for the initial warrant. That is not how FISA applications work. And ultimately several judges approved it.
958536952210477056 2018-01-30 03:06:32 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @TheRickWilson I can't bring myself to watch...I'm following along via Twitter thru gems like this one.

953082092568633345 2018-01-15 01:50:52 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @danieljpowell @Blainejo @SecretlyPrivate I believe you mean Hope Hicks
953081134744788993 2018-01-15 01:47:04 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> And she announced to the world she has a Wi-Fi connected device with a microphone in her home. They really are that stupid...https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/952633833693810688
947244223501406208 2017-12-30 23:13:16 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @FatherWithTwins @FallenJane03 Mine make them just wet enough with saliva that they break off or ruin anything you attempt to erase.
940027608519061504 2017-12-10 01:17:01 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @realDonaldTrump @glamourizes The wall hasn't and won't be funded..the prototypes haven't even been paid for or funded.
940026671960227840 2017-12-10 01:13:18 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @realDonaldTrump @glamourizes What ''real issues" that affect your daily life has he put first?  This tax plan is a joke. There is benefit if you have a private jet but not if you need help paying for childcare.  He has ICE detaining sick children on their way to surgery.
916116514130071552 2017-10-05 01:42:52 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @PressSec @CBSNews @byproxxy As a pro makeup artist,  her makeup literally PAINS me..those faux lashes don't help her lazy eye!
916107824127791106 2017-10-05 01:08:20 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @HillaryClinton @stringfellowfr4 That's bullshit and you know it. Guns HAVE changed since the writing of 2A.

893527002770178048 2017-08-04 17:40:13 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @tarapalmeri @jaketapper @PilotChrisD And even the heroin up here comes from the Middle East.. Not Mexico.
893526715699429377 2017-08-04 17:39:04 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @tarapalmeri @jaketapper @PilotChrisD Exactly. The drugs affecting the Northeast are coming from a lab in China via the mail not Mexico.
893307855964655616 2017-08-03 03:09:24 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenatorHassan @MarcyWalsh It's also coming from China via the mail in the form of fentynal.
884560754711687168 2017-07-10 23:51:32 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @SenBlumenthal @MSNBC @hardball @carolmoson Success? The US is no longer being taken seriously as a world leader.  We are being left behind thanks to 45...

829160401002696704 2017-02-07 02:50:19 UTC <stephaniemayMUA> @SenFranken Any chance you can convince Sen Toomey to come out from under his desk to do this with his PA constituents?
