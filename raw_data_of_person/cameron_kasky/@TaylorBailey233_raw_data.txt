971447943059427328 2018-03-07 18:10:12 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Im honestly at a breaking point and I feel like no one understands.
971406823076040704 2018-03-07 15:26:49 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Why does the education building smell like sewer??
970855924356263936 2018-03-05 02:57:44 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I had a meltdown tonight and completely reorganized my room. Life is good.
970800693484441600 2018-03-05 23:18:16 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Yay for parents who dont watch their kids. Yay for kids who run out in front of vehicles and force drivers to drive onto the curbing and pop their tires.

970182221456953344 2018-03-03 06:20:41 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @sarrahallie Rent in general is too much lol.
970181561143394305 2018-03-03 06:18:03 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @sarrahallie Were probably moving to Riverside when my lease is up.
970055259287621632 2018-03-03 21:56:11 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Fuck Blanding Boulevard. I cant wait to move out of Orange Park.
969447068258525187 2018-03-01 05:39:27 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @marissa_dye Just have lots of tissue readily available.
969444625349005312 2018-03-01 05:29:44 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Elementary school Randall from #ThisisUs is the cutest kid ever! 
969442027359391745 2018-03-01 05:19:25 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @itscsmiddy Meanwhile were like when it comes to babies.pic.twitter.com/Ze9GlXVUoq
969441823948263424 2018-03-01 05:18:36 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @marissa_dye I cried so much. But not as much as I thought I would.
968738066604097538 2018-02-27 06:42:08 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brooke_Hinton This was the cutest thing Ive ever seen 
965821224126468096 2018-02-19 05:31:38 UTC <TaylorBailey233> James and I are, without a doubt, Jack and Rebecca Pearson. Hes so perfect and Im flawed and anxiety ridden, but mean well.
965116646041051137 2018-02-17 06:51:54 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Its basically like Im already a mom because Mousse and James never let me use the bathroom alone.
964773659272413190 2018-02-17 08:08:59 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brooke_Hinton @freedrewsh @sarahintonn What teacher was this????
963049003981078528 2018-02-12 13:55:49 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Welcome to the Elementary Education program. Have the flu, gotta have surgery? We dont care, we still wont excuse your absences and youll still fail no matter what you do.
962471460680949760 2018-02-10 23:40:52 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Im so in love with this man. From the surgery, to the flu, to just every day, hes always here for me taking care of me. 
961283918505938944 2018-02-07 17:02:00 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I feel like death and because of unaccommodating attendance policies, Im probably gonna fail my classes this semester.
960513662095122434 2018-02-05 14:01:17 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I cant wait for my nap between class and work this afternoonpic.twitter.com/EPkuVa635Q
958804715835359232 2018-01-31 20:50:32 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Some times these elementary ed classes really make me wanna drop out.
956735860749213696 2018-01-25 03:49:39 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Finally ordered my tickets to see Lion King 
956203550979383296 2018-01-24 16:34:26 UTC <TaylorBailey233> This first day back to classes after surgery is killing me. Its only 11:30 and I have classes until 7:15 
955647016557834240 2018-01-22 03:42:58 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @n_niltiak_k When is it? James and I can go maybe?

954528732433219584 2018-01-19 01:39:18 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I hate not being able to do anything but lay in bed. 
954527762194358273 2018-01-19 01:35:27 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @HannahSilene Take me!

953416374302453760 2018-01-16 23:59:11 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Trying not to panic about my surgery tomorrow.
952429639972073472 2018-01-13 06:38:16 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @sarahintonn I literally just made a status on Facebook about it lol
952429358865580032 2018-01-13 06:37:09 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @sarahintonn I feel you.
952404992010473472 2018-01-13 05:00:19 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Doing my homework while Im listening to the love of my life snore in the background. I love my life 
951494672471461889 2018-01-11 16:43:02 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I had to pay $800 for my surgery and now I dint have money for my billshttps://twitter.com/carolinemaariee/status/951494405336305664
951077928217075713 2018-01-10 13:07:02 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Baptist South is a gorgeous hospital.
951075431444307968 2018-01-10 12:57:07 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Everyone should go check out the Songs to Sing in the Shower playlist on Spotify because they are all jams.
950900388714172416 2018-01-09 01:21:34 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Dreamers are people and should NOT be a point of leverage.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/950884128379035650
950810492913713152 2018-01-09 19:24:21 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Grateful for this new job, so all the money Ive worked hard for can go toward this damn surgery #goodbyesavings
950799207056756736 2018-01-09 18:39:30 UTC <TaylorBailey233> This doctors appointment with my surgeon is probably the scariest thing Ive ever done.
950264180464025600 2018-01-07 07:13:30 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Such a beautiful and powerful speech by the amazing Oprah Winfrey.https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/950256703173464064
950261252961591296 2018-01-07 07:01:52 UTC <TaylorBailey233> It must be the night before classes start because Im 2 am and Im wide awake 
949727641875173378 2018-01-06 19:41:29 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Beyond excited that I will *probably* be at the most magical place in the world with my very own Prince Charming for my 21st birthday  @Jingles004
949144098421682176 2018-01-04 05:02:41 UTC <TaylorBailey233> My man made me a delicious dinner tonight and now were cuddling while he plays his PS4. But I definitely think hes husband material because of that dinner.
948440310853652481 2018-01-02 06:26:05 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Females are strong as hell #unbreakable
947275284868411392 2017-12-30 01:16:42 UTC <TaylorBailey233> James consistently knows how to make me feel loved and important, even when hes super sick. @Jingles004
947182869499310081 2017-12-30 19:09:28 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Yall keep my love in your thoughts. Poor boy probably has bronchitis. Were at the ER now. We were at the ER yesterday for me and now were back. Very eventful couple of days.
946485943309094920 2017-12-28 21:00:08 UTC <TaylorBailey233> When I go to get out of bed, James reaches over and wraps me up in his arms. Its all really cute, until Im getting up to go to the bathroom.
946217816495190024 2017-12-27 03:14:41 UTC <TaylorBailey233> The fact that I get to come home from work tonight to you waiting in my apartment makes me the happiest. I cant wait to always be able to come home to you.  @Jingles004
945466606670548992 2017-12-25 01:29:39 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Honestly, the best part of my Christmas was waking up by your side, @Jingles004
943345836230103040 2017-12-19 05:02:28 UTC <TaylorBailey233> The anxiety is strong with this one.

942846370393845760 2017-12-18 19:57:46 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I love that no matter what I do Im always portrayed as the shitty daughter/sister.
942060873098629120 2017-12-16 15:56:29 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I wanna be a hard worker, but I also wanna be a house wife. @Jingles004 help a girl out.
940795980852670465 2017-12-12 04:10:15 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @n_niltiak_k I got you, best friend!
940603324742504449 2017-12-12 15:24:42 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I passed all of my classes this semester and I honestly didnt think that would happen! Someone celebrate with me tonight!
939977090862116864 2017-12-10 21:56:17 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I cannot wait until Thursday. The Last Jedi with the love of my life.  @Jingles004

935821571234713600 2017-11-29 10:43:43 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @n_niltiak_k Im always here if you need to talk. 
935821495980511232 2017-11-29 10:43:26 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Falling asleep next to him will always be my favorite thing. 
935665123255111680 2017-11-28 00:22:03 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @MisterWindex I swear that he is. Its so sad that hes representing our nation, honestly.
935664963389132800 2017-11-28 00:21:25 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Next Thursday after 3 pm will be my favorite part of this semester.
935664790676045824 2017-11-28 00:20:44 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @MisterWindex I didnt even notice that!

933720248976592896 2017-11-23 15:33:49 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 Oh wow. People suck.
933719758054313990 2017-11-23 15:31:52 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 Idk why some professors at UNF feel so entitled.
933712273146892289 2017-11-23 15:02:08 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 What happened?

932468624698339328 2017-11-19 04:40:19 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @HannahSilene Me
930911204029198338 2017-11-15 21:31:41 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I've been listening to Taylor Swift's album nonstop. It's the perfect amount of sweet and salty.
930458621095313409 2017-11-14 15:33:17 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Wow. I need a nap.

929849651129352192 2017-11-12 23:13:27 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Update: I took the nap. I regret it. Going to fail classes.
929702533588815875 2017-11-12 13:28:51 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I can't wait to take a nap after I get off work.
929447993346023424 2017-11-11 20:37:24 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I love Saturdays because I always have nap time between my shifts. 
929145786176360448 2017-11-10 00:36:32 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Life is weird. I used to despise Live Oak, but now I look forward to venturing back every week or so. Life really shows you that family is really the only ones that are there for you no matter what.
929096116108517376 2017-11-10 21:19:10 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I miss him so much

925354214016077825 2017-10-31 13:30:11 UTC <TaylorBailey233> If I'm the only one dressed up on campus I'm gonna be hurt.
924671322789203968 2017-10-29 16:16:37 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I would get a sinus infection right before I have to teach 
924281783029587968 2017-10-28 14:28:44 UTC <TaylorBailey233> The people who are majoring in education and don't know the difference between than and then worry me.
923918815863410699 2017-10-27 14:26:25 UTC <TaylorBailey233> There's a chance that I can graduate on time still and I'm crying.
923749322734391296 2017-10-26 03:12:55 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I'm pretty sure I'm more excited for my boyfriend's birthday than he is.
923018341341716481 2017-10-24 02:48:16 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I get to see my boyfriend in like two hours and after the week I've had, I couldn't be more hyped.
923017288219054080 2017-10-24 02:44:05 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Jordan_Fisher Jacksonville!!!
923016716535455745 2017-10-24 02:41:48 UTC <TaylorBailey233> My sister is alway watching Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chippedwrecked and I don't know how I feel about that.
922629229598167040 2017-10-23 01:02:04 UTC <TaylorBailey233> The best part of my job is that they play @KeithUrban regularly. #crackerbarrel
922528304967626753 2017-10-23 18:21:02 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @MisterWindex But it's so good! And yeah, I was the youngest person at their concert this past summer lol
922480568880783360 2017-10-23 15:11:21 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Never again will I try to balance 14 credit hours, and internship, and 30 hours a week at work. #alwaysexhausted #ifeeldead

921925652370116609 2017-10-21 02:26:18 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 Come over! We can do homework together!
921569499190562816 2017-10-20 02:51:05 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @n_niltiak_k Girl, me too, so much. We're gonna have so much fun!
921566774902120448 2017-10-20 02:40:15 UTC <TaylorBailey233> The fact that my best friend might be transferring to UNF next fall literally has me on cloud nine. @n_niltiak_k
920274222127173633 2017-10-17 13:04:07 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 That just ruined my day.
920271456050741248 2017-10-17 12:53:07 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I curse way too much to be an elementary education major. 
920270505789227009 2017-10-17 12:49:21 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 Unless it's Jordan Fisher and Lin-Manuel's cover, because that's way better than the original.
920270285819006976 2017-10-17 12:48:28 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I have no idea how I got so lucky with James. He's literally the best. 
920002502447325184 2017-10-16 19:04:24 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Honestly, what is wrong with him?https://twitter.com/joshgroban/status/919996152321363968
919952884367839233 2017-10-16 15:47:14 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I honestly cannot stand sorority girls. 
919816976540864512 2017-10-15 06:47:11 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @n_niltiak_k I love you, best friend 
919271101330546688 2017-10-14 18:38:04 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Anxiety is wonderful

898781051488567296 2017-08-18 05:37:55 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Wow. Being stabbed in the back sucks.
896889106067738624 2017-08-13 00:20:00 UTC <TaylorBailey233> If Chris Pratt and Anna Farris couldn't last, I don't know why I ever believed we could...

892809260266074112 2017-08-02 18:08:09 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I just want my anxiety to go away.
891143485495160832 2017-07-28 03:48:58 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Is anyone else having issues with their instagram app randomly closing out on them?
891128964143566848 2017-07-28 02:51:16 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Love when someone gets caught in a lie and tries to blame you for them getting caught.
888973584663752704 2017-07-22 04:06:33 UTC <TaylorBailey233> It continually freaks me out that a good percentage of the people I graduated/went to school with are either pregnant or married.

885260178530107392 2017-07-12 22:10:48 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Probably the best most emotional (at least for me) part of the show.https://twitter.com/timgodcharles/status/885206741344038914
885258343178264577 2017-07-12 22:03:30 UTC <TaylorBailey233> My kitty, Mousse, is losing her kitten face and it's making me so sad.

882792942670360577 2017-07-05 02:46:53 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brooke_Hinton What class?
882222168934887424 2017-07-04 12:58:50 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I love holidays and I work all day. Lee hates holidays and he's off. Hahaha. I hate this.
881942680212836352 2017-07-03 18:28:15 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Don't tell me that you miss me when you won't come see me bc you 'can't afford it' but can afford to make regular trips to NC. 
881288761451180032 2017-07-01 23:09:48 UTC <TaylorBailey233> We're meeting #Chicago after the show!

880079025200218112 2017-06-28 15:02:45 UTC <TaylorBailey233> When you're sick af, but you're also too poor to call out of work.
879602337593118720 2017-06-27 07:28:34 UTC <TaylorBailey233> This cold isn't playing man. I feel like I'm dying.
878733489654431744 2017-06-24 21:56:04 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Lee just told my kitty not to be a bad bitch, haha.
877232405634924544 2017-06-20 18:31:18 UTC <TaylorBailey233> @Brittany__Ann13 Same.

870793689660104705 2017-06-02 00:06:08 UTC <TaylorBailey233> High school graduation ceremonies are probably the most ghetto/redneck things ever.
865340446561763329 2017-05-18 22:56:54 UTC <TaylorBailey233> "Take summer classes to get ahead. You'll be proud of yourself" I said. Y'all this class is 4 hours long. 
865339345129099264 2017-05-18 22:52:31 UTC <TaylorBailey233> Noooooo.  @Brittany__Ann13https://twitter.com/gma/status/865331222322573312

863893671262998529 2017-05-14 23:07:56 UTC <TaylorBailey233> This would probably be how I get arrested.https://twitter.com/fox29philly/status/863474311599980544
863893310837936128 2017-05-14 23:06:30 UTC <TaylorBailey233> I'm pretty sure that I could eat Zaxby's every day.

862738306714435585 2017-05-11 18:36:55 UTC <TaylorBailey233> They were all lies, she thought to herself while picking up the pieces of her own heart.
861670024896970753 2017-05-08 19:51:57 UTC <TaylorBailey233> And you were a nightmare wrapped in something beautiful a disaster presented as a gift.
