970174414833758208 2018-03-03 05:49:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today I attended the Lyon county @MinnesotaDFL convention and learned what all goes on. I had a good time. Didn't get elected as a delecate but the ones who were far more experienced and involved than me. My hope in the future is to be more involved than now   #DFL #Democrats

969423758841778176 2018-03-01 04:06:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today the Minnesota republicans blocked some gun prevention legislation.

969287993952493569 2018-03-01 19:07:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill That doesn't stop from churches getting shot up. Your beliefs isn't gonna prevent things like a shooting from happening. These kids are out there making a positive change in the world and a difference. Get out and vote for people who will bring about that change.
969130378911940609 2018-03-01 08:41:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thank you @RepTimWalz for coming out against the nra and for stronger gun laws. I may not being supporting him right now as he runs for governor but I will not be attacking him. This November we the @MinnesotaDFL @TheDemocrats must come together. Let's not year each other down

967126646116569090 2018-02-23 19:58:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> How could a event full of pro gun people who want guns everywhere be a gun free zone. I thought guns made us safer   #CPAC2018

966145735480823810 2018-02-20 03:01:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today the @TheFLGOP showed their true colors by standing with the nra and not with dead kids who lost their lives because of another mass shooting. Republicans are not pro life. They are pro death and their thoughts and prayers mean nothing   #VoteThemOut #GunReformNow

965829574742376449 2018-02-19 06:04:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you defend guns after a shooting and death of kids then you're a f'n asshole   #GunReformNow

964560814643601409 2018-02-16 18:03:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> I have no respect for @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan And anyone who takes the blood money of the nra. They will protect guns over dead kids. These are the same people who claim to be pro life   #BloodMoney #GunReformNow
964416755866075138 2018-02-16 08:30:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> @SpeakerRyan doesn't care about your kids getting killed by a mentally ill shooter with a #AR15. He cares about the blood money check he gets from the terrorist group nra.   #GunReformNow
964345582415380480 2018-02-15 03:47:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Got a copy of the new @12Stones album. My favorite band since I was 13. Have every album.  #12stones #music

964224509707542530 2018-02-15 19:46:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Don't forget that @realDonaldTrump made it easier for mentally ill people to buy guns. He has taken the blood money of the nra and the blood is on his hands too   #GunReformNow #GunControl
964220798063038464 2018-02-15 19:32:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill You mean passed bills that allows mentally ill people to be able to buy guns

964170164760731649 2018-02-15 16:10:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> These gun massacres are on the hands of @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump who has taken the blood money of the nra. The blood money is more important than people's lives it seems to people who claim to be pro life   #EnoughIsEnough #GunControlNow #fackthenra
964169193867313152 2018-02-15 16:07:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill How does he know when alot of those victims are dead. He is one who has taken blood money of the nra. It's on his hands too
963985232994164741 2018-02-14 03:56:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> The pro life @GOP will send their thoughts and prayers during a #MassShooting but take the blood money of the #NRA. They Don't give a damn about these victims even if they are kids   #GunControlNow #NRABloodMoney #NotOneMore
963970753229148160 2018-02-14 02:58:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you see anyone from the @GOP send their thoughts and prayers just remember that they have taken millions of dollars in blood money from the nra  #NotOneMore #GunControlNow

958172530682023936 2018-01-29 02:58:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> Comparing the @mikethemiz to #TomBrady is disgraceful @WWEGraves and @TheCoachrules . The miz is not in the same league of the goat. Maybe comparable to the repo man and that's pushing it

956404590446071808 2018-01-24 05:53:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> My knowledge of old school wrestling has expanded by listening to @TheJimCornette and @GreatBrianLast.

955646609743806464 2018-01-22 03:41:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> On the positive side of this lame show @TheGeneOkerlund and @AJStylesOrg are together   #MondayNightRaw
955644809083084800 2018-01-22 03:34:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today's wwe is a reminder how lame and forgettable their shows are now. I spend more time watching classic wrestling on YouTube from the territory days to the early mid 90s.   #oldschool #MondayNightRaw
955644165949394944 2018-01-22 03:31:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> @GreatBrianLast I admit I still watch but it's so lame and forgettable. It's such wrestlecrap

952974975429939200 2018-01-15 18:45:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump is only saying he is the least racist person after more than once getting caught saying racist things and oh don't forget he said #Nazis are very fine people   #TrumpIsARacist

952374380369244161 2018-01-13 02:58:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Important issue for me when selecting a governor on the @MinnesotaDFL side is a #LivingWage #UniversalHealthCare strong #Unions and no tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who don't need it @paulthissen @Rebecca_Otto @epmurphymn @mayorcoleman @RepTimWalz
952371325145935872 2018-01-13 02:46:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> Josh Matthews is the new @IMPACTWRESTLING grand champion. Like @tonyschiavone24 used to say that will put butts in seats

952043644789448704 2018-01-12 05:04:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> A #shithole country is where they refuse to pass #UniversalHealthcare and have a #LivingWage for its citizens while handing out millions of dollars of tax breaks to corporations and rich people who don't need it
951911428746817538 2018-01-12 20:19:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Speaking of a #shithole @TomiLahren is a racist piece of shit like @realDonaldTrump
951894857492189184 2018-01-12 19:13:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just because they have a job where they cook your food or stock store shelves don't mean they deserve to live in poverty   #FightFor15 #LivingWage

951694489642512384 2018-01-11 05:57:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching pro wrestling now makes me long for great classic wrestling from the territory days most of it which happen before I was born. I'm the youngest old school wrestling fan I'm proud to say @TheJimCornette @GreatBrianLast
951693882592497664 2018-01-11 05:54:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> So wal mart closes more than 60 Sam's club stores just because of a minimum wage hike but will be receiving millions in tax breaks and corporate welfare.  #GOPTaxScam

949885495387058176 2018-01-06 06:08:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Listening to @TheJimCornette and @GreatBrianLast discuss money in wrestling in the past compared to now. Big difference. Wrestling was in a better place in the territory days and so was the business
949885098488483840 2018-01-06 06:07:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> A #stablegenius @realDonaldTrump is not but a big piece of shit and unstable moron he is
949884790991458304 2018-01-06 06:05:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> What time do the @dallascowboys play tomorrow  #NFLWildCardWeekend
949867461377224707 2018-01-06 04:57:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> I can't wait to watch the @Chiefs in the Superbowl 
949854686236086272 2018-01-06 04:06:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> #lionking on @FreeformTV tonight. Still as good when I was 7  Now I'm 29 and now see all the life lessons in this film
949852209155575808 2018-01-06 03:56:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think people are being played by all the so called drama with the @Patriots. You're all falling for it and getting played.   #GoPatspic.twitter.com/7NwP5qIOxn
949839020892348418 2018-01-06 03:04:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy to hear that Tim hudson and one of my all time favorite baseball announcers Joe simpson will be inducted to the @Braves hall of fame   #ChopOn
949741236059025413 2018-01-06 20:35:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's official smoking #marijuana is safer than voting #Republican
949739206540234757 2018-01-06 20:27:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sad to hear the passing of #JerryVanDyke. I remember him on coach and in recent years on the @TheMiddle_ABC one of my favorite tv shows
949738306165788672 2018-01-06 20:23:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thank you @hulu for adding #TinyToons to your lineup. This 90s kid is so happy
949736347761364992 2018-01-06 20:16:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette The only thing sable will be remembered for is being nude in a magazine. She didn't do anything in wrestling besides marrying a couple wrestlers
949732335213301760 2018-01-06 20:00:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BarackObama never had to remind us he was smart   #stablegenius
949707564400414720 2018-01-06 18:21:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill She isnt the president. This blame hillary or Obama has gotten old real fast

949510139287130118 2018-01-05 05:17:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> How couldn't @realDonaldTrump like #FireAndFury when he hasn't read it yet. Oh wait does he read
949492180871274497 2018-01-05 04:05:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> 2018 is gonna be a good year. Will get to meet @OfficialHacksaw and go to another @MidwestAllPro show in February then in April getting tickets for @BradPaisley at @PREMIER_Center.
949484994715668480 2018-01-05 03:37:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's sad to see @JamesStormBrand leave @IMPACTWRESTLING #IMPACTonPOP
949483021371133952 2018-01-05 03:29:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> I don't believe any of these fake news reports on the @Patriots at all   #GoPats
949457517888835589 2018-01-05 01:48:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> @QueenMrsSD @UGeneDinsmore Will do so. Always can use another tanktop for summer
949347609545764865 2018-01-05 18:31:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> @davemeltzerWON I'm agreeing with Dave on this one. Wwe isn't the only major league out there. New Japan pro wrestling has been around for many years and becoming the place to be again. Oh and it's a far better show than that sports entertainment garbage
949121293009465344 2018-01-04 03:32:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> I do love pro wrestling but I'm with @TheJimCornette and @GreatBrianLast the old school wrestling is the best and so much better. I really don't like this sports entertainment comedy wrestling
949110365488668674 2018-01-04 02:48:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'll be able to go to @MidwestAllPro on February 11th and meet @OfficialHacksaw in #SiouxFalls. Been wanting to go to a event since #mapmania
949104155544768512 2018-01-04 02:23:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Season premiere of @NashvilleCMT yespic.twitter.com/daPDNZbIoc
948991982315212801 2018-01-04 18:58:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> So the attorney General elf is cracking down on marijuana even though it's not a dangerous drug and can be used for medical use. So much for republicans supporting State's rights   #Resistance
948989716413796352 2018-01-04 18:49:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> @UGeneDinsmore @QueenMrsSD Could I get a tanktop shipped to me by chance. I would love one
948989369876205568 2018-01-04 18:47:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> I met @SenTinaSmith 2 years ago and i know she will do a good job and be on the right side of the issues  #DFL #Democrats
948980314667454464 2018-01-04 18:11:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @IAmJericho vs @KennyOmegamanX can be easily a match of the year candidate and it can be said that @njpwglobal is the best pro wrestling on the planet.   #njwk12
948809083859144704 2018-01-03 06:51:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> @HeyHeyItsConrad @tonyschiavone24 @WHWMonday Not as much tension as there is is between @bruceprichard and @davemeltzerWON
948786668861054977 2018-01-03 05:22:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> #NJWK12 is the wrestlemania of professional wrestling
948441799185530882 2018-01-02 06:32:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> 2 of my numbers were right on the #MegaMillions. Ha   #smallvictories
948435519859494912 2018-01-02 06:07:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette this is far better than anything I seen of Kenny omegahttps://twitter.com/BoomerangToons/status/948358410021625856
948433000517206016 2018-01-02 05:57:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> It was never this cold when @BarackObama was President.  #ThanksObama 
948043115415441408 2018-01-01 04:07:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> @davemeltzerWON You do the same with your irrelevant opinions but he is no different than you

947711570070654976 2017-12-31 06:10:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy New year. I hope and pray that 2018 was better than 2017. Please let my find what is real true love.  #celebrate2018pic.twitter.com/DaXUXj8MkI
947695961467510784 2017-12-31 05:08:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> @davemeltzerWON Well isn't that a bunch of b.s.. to say that is the best ever. Give me a break
947672389336420352 2017-12-31 03:34:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> In 2018 I would like to see less super kicks, no dick flips, less comedy wrestling and more serious good ole #ProfessionalWrestling
947631921424629760 2017-12-31 00:53:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> How bout the @Broncos bring back #JohnFox and #jackdelrio in 2018. It's obvious the current coaching staff isn't it   #BroncosCountry
947631265230057473 2017-12-31 00:51:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am ready to burn 2017 to the ground. Such a disappointing year for me personally. A few good highlights. 2016 was awesome but not this year. Hoping 2018 brings me love and what I'm looking for   #NYE2017
947630522683019266 2017-12-31 00:48:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Glad the disgraceful 2017 season is over for the @Broncos. Changes are needed in 2018. Including a new coach, new o line and sadly a new quarterback. Its your move @johnelway #BroncosCountrypic.twitter.com/wafkwBDXU1
947297622682939393 2017-12-30 02:45:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette The only difference is @therealec3 doesn't do soft ball over wrestling lol
947236460578689025 2017-12-30 22:42:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy birthday to the best in the world today. No not you kevin Durant but @KingJames
947224672256618498 2017-12-30 21:55:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> 2017 is the year some people showed their true colors and that promises made 4 years ago mean nothing. I guess someone dying exposed people and who they really are. I can't wait til 2018. I'm cutting anyone who broke promises off entirely   #HappyNewYear

947008711003959296 2017-12-29 07:37:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CNNPolitics He is full of  like always. He lies everytime his lips move and his supporters are dumb enough to believe such b.s.

947008044176756736 2017-12-29 07:34:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CBSNews How we build a wall around trump and his supporters.
947001826322337792 2017-12-29 07:10:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> #minimumwage goes up in Minnesota in January. Thanks to @GovMarkDayton and the @MinnesotaDFL. No thanks to the republicans. They want to screw workers over
947001381143052288 2017-12-29 07:08:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I don't think @tonyromo should be the next coach of that trash bin that is the Dallas cowboys. Keep him on commentary @CBSSports. He is the best color man in the @NFL
947000845765369857 2017-12-29 07:06:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> In 2018 I hope to attend #mapmania again in #SiouxFalls @MidwestAllPro. Friday night is perfect for me to get there and a day off from work too
946967285062864896 2017-12-29 04:52:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> I just love this cold Minnesota paradise   #coldweather #Minnesota #Paradise

946615836172849153 2017-12-28 05:36:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Listened to the new @LukeBryanOnline album and awesome as always. There has never been a album of his I didn't like.  #LukeBryan #CountryMusic
946585464764497922 2017-12-28 03:35:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill No surprise here. That white house is full of white supremacist. There is even one as President
946585017236455425 2017-12-28 03:33:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill I'm offended by crappy fast food so does that mean I get a refund from McDonalds. Totally stupid
946417595640614912 2017-12-28 16:28:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Republicans never said all that when Hillary Clinton was being investigated. I wonder what the difference is
946417321907818496 2017-12-28 16:27:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> One week until @NashvilleCMT yes  #NashvilleCMTpic.twitter.com/7dcdSOqnlM
946308556671897600 2017-12-28 09:15:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ABC Owners of those beast never want to take responsibility and make excuses
946307817107050496 2017-12-28 09:12:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> There are more people outraged over the new star wars movie than #NetNeutrality or the  #GOPTaxScam #WakeUp
946307409429049344 2017-12-28 09:10:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @MooreSenate you sick piece of shit go away and get lost. You're a sick child molester and deserve to be eaten by a shark   #childmolester

945872461907812353 2017-12-26 04:22:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just seen the last Jedi and I learned in order to gain something bigger and more important you must sacrifice and let go even if it means everything to you   #StarWars #LastJedi
945510482550587392 2017-12-25 04:24:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's one thing being #single on #Christmas but it's way worse when you have a family who doesn t  come around during the holidays. Not even to see my grandma. One day they will regret the choices they make today
945507333165240320 2017-12-25 04:11:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> Keep in mind not everyone is fortunate to have a great Christmas. There are those who don't get gifts much less expensive ones. They value the little things we take for granted. Don't forget those who spend the holidays alone and how hard that has to be.   #christmas
945432628177571845 2017-12-25 23:14:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> One more airing of #ChristmasStory on @TBSNetwork til next year I never miss itpic.twitter.com/pCsGQQiswl

945126845967667200 2017-12-24 02:59:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> It just wouldn't be #ChristmasEve without #CandleLightService and #ChristmasStory marathon on @TBSNetwork
945048545937317893 2017-12-24 21:48:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Since @TomiLahren is offended by happy holidays I'll just wish her have a shitty winter you stupid racist moron
945001336743038976 2017-12-24 18:40:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MollyQerim Beautiful. Have a happy holiday
945001130450477056 2017-12-24 18:40:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @joanwalsh is headed to @CNN. Your loss @MSNBC.   #JoanWalsh
945000085993213954 2017-12-24 18:35:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> It would be a big laugh to see @TomiLahren on are you smarter than a 5th grader. She isn't smarter than a 1st grader
944847199082569730 2017-12-24 08:28:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> When its #ChristmasEve and the @Broncos are on @CBS #BroncosCountrypic.twitter.com/j3uSXAP78O

944701583677325312 2017-12-23 22:49:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy holidays @TomiLahren  don't get offended I'm saying something nice to you which probably don't happen often
944627045488844801 2017-12-23 17:53:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette @LanceStorm @LesThatcher Wait did I miss something. You mean he never worked at those places. Oh lord now I have to refresh on my wrestling history

944606507861233664 2017-12-23 16:31:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette Russo fans are like trump supporters they can't spell and highly uneducated
944487443889258496 2017-12-23 08:38:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> I hear the minimum wage is going up the 1st of January. Thanks to the @MinnesotaDFL

944481403043008512 2017-12-23 08:14:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> Honestly get over yourselves and quit being offended by #HappyHolidays. There is no war on Christmas. Someone is saying something nice to you. No one says you can't say merry Christmas unless you believe the propaganda and b.s. on #FauxNews

944261690350292992 2017-12-22 17:41:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well its time to grab the pitchforks and we're coming for the @GOP and that no good piece of shit @realDonaldTrump.  Let's get it @TheDemocrats #Midterms2018 #GOPTaxScam

944076327124119552 2017-12-21 05:25:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> When we talk about great tag teams we talk about the #midnightexpress with @TheJimCornette we talk about the road warriors, the funks, briscoes, the Minnesota wrecking crew @TheRobertGibson @RealRickyMorton the rock n roll express not the young bucks
944075261879910400 2017-12-21 05:20:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Lindsay_13 You're right and have a good point @MooreMaya needs to be on there
944074786401112064 2017-12-21 05:19:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill It never did before. It always added to the debt. Raising taxes on the rich and corporations did end up in surpluses but what do republicans know about that
943914721174007808 2017-12-21 18:43:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> #HappyBirthday @jemelehill. Enjoy your work and what you do
943914480169377792 2017-12-21 18:42:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Listening to @GreatBrianLast and @TheJimCornette and like me they like good serious #prowrestling. Watching old Georgia championship wrestling on YouTube this week makes me say this is why I'm a wrestling fan.
943882398525280258 2017-12-21 16:34:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Doesn't she work for a network who insulted @BarackObama based on lies for 8 years spreading false info about him
943882119994068992 2017-12-21 16:33:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's #WinterSolstice and I'm gonna watch some classic Georgia championship wrestling on YouTube today. #prowrestling the way it was suppose and meant to be

943729715629772800 2017-12-20 06:27:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> I got blocked by one of the young bucks lmao @TheJimCornette I'm in the same boat you are
943552030878195713 2017-12-20 18:41:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey turtle face @SenateMajLdr and you eddie Munster rip off @SpeakerRyan #Midterms2018 are coming and we are gonna make republicans a minority. Time to grab the pitchforks   #resistance #StopGOPTaxScam #Democrats
943547871030333442 2017-12-20 18:25:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #ProLife republicans just threw off 13 million Americans off health insurance.   We are coming in #Midterms2018

943364151073755136 2017-12-19 06:15:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @GOP we are coming for you crooks in 2018   #GOPTaxScam #Midterms2018 #Democrats
943327645814657024 2017-12-19 03:50:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> The first noel by @ladyantebellum is my favorite #ChristmasSong
943326125392097280 2017-12-19 03:44:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> If the #GOPTaxScam cost the republicans their majority then good news. Let's take our anger and rage to the  #Midterms2018 and to 2020
943035426339786752 2017-12-19 08:29:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Been watching some classic pro wrestling on YouTube @TheJimCornette and you wouldn't believe it there are no flips or super kicks through out the whole shows. Just some good ole pro wrestling the way it was suppose to be.
943026462617231360 2017-12-18 07:53:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @adamweber Is it strange that I'm someone who doesn't want anything for Christmas and think there is a deeper meaning to this time of year
943026025981730816 2017-12-18 07:51:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ufc @TheJimCornette Today's wrestling is crap. Flips, gymnastics and superkicks got old real fast. I find myself watching classic pro wrestling on YouTube and enjoying it more and guess what they wrestled in those days and didn't perform gymnastics and flips
943012230077009920 2017-12-18 06:56:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @davemeltzerWON You would know false information wouldn't ya
942999117239934977 2017-12-18 06:04:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> It makes me feel old to see the jerseys  @kobebryant be retired. I remember when he first came to the @Lakers #LakeShow #Ko8e24
942979161651646465 2017-12-18 04:45:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Didn't even watch the final hour of raw. I'm breaking the bad habit of watching bad wrestling.   #oldschool

942569718510227457 2017-12-17 01:38:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow #ChristmasStoryLive was such a disappointment 
942552363839172608 2017-12-17 00:29:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Patriots win  #GoPatspic.twitter.com/C2FQfpxbP3
942451828213547011 2017-12-17 17:50:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> So I'm at the point in my life where I don't have a christmas list or even a #ChristmasWish. What I would like to have can't be bought in a store. To me #Christmas has a deeper meaning than receiving alot of gifts or even big expensive gifts.
942445390258941952 2017-12-17 17:24:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @VinceMcMahon has enough money to start of the failure that was the #XFL but doesn't have the money to offer his wrestlers health benefits, pensions, and retirement smh
942280715911290886 2017-12-16 06:30:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> I can't tell the difference between @AlecBaldwin as Donald trump and the real fake President @realDonaldTrump #SNL
942267902593560577 2017-12-16 05:39:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Doesn't @SarahHuckabee know that lying gets you on the naughty list and Santa will bring her nothing for Christmas but it will get you a visit from #Krampus. He will just need a bigger sack to stuff her in 
942224839850459136 2017-12-16 02:48:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @davemeltzerWON says it's true then it is. Just ask @bruceprichard
942222726596583424 2017-12-16 02:39:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> Since @VinceMcMahon wants to bring back the #XFL he might as well bring back the world bodybuilding federation as well because we know how successful that was too. Oh don't forget the brawl 4 all  poor man has lost it
942205284273016832 2017-12-16 01:30:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Back in the territory days of #ProWrestling and back when 10 guys didn't have to go Through a table from the top rope for people to Be interestedpic.twitter.com/zqCeJQUn0f

942172896071430144 2017-12-16 23:21:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> So in the 2016 election the American people voted Republican and voted for a Nazi sympathizing white supremacist like @realDonaldTrump over the fear of emails of @HillaryClinton that had a whole lot to do about nothing   #idiots
942172408475258880 2017-12-16 23:19:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Republicans can go ahead vote for their #GOPTaxScam and in 2018 we will be coming with pitch forks and #VoteThemOut

941919098417635329 2017-12-15 06:33:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette says that #Evangelicals are worse than #Republicans. He isn't lying
941574384862597120 2017-12-14 07:43:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> Dear @realDonaldTrump rational and decent people don't like you and your stupid crooked family. Burn in hell. Signed the world
941570849122979842 2017-12-14 07:29:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> As long as @realDonaldTrump is President and as long as unarmed black civilians are being killed by cops for no reason I'll #TakeAKnee. If that is wrong I don't want to be right
941555008067260416 2017-12-14 06:26:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> 5 years since #SandyHook and nothing has changed. All the payed off politicians have done is send their thoughts and prayers while taking the blood money of the #NRA

941513135932018688 2017-12-14 03:39:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> I suggest that @MinnesotaDFL ag Lori Swanson add Minnesota to one of the states that will sue over #NetNeutrality
941511835777425408 2017-12-14 03:34:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> I have no respect for @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan or any other piece of shit in the #Republicanparty
941511433413693440 2017-12-14 03:33:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you imagine a piece of shit @realDonaldTrump comes to mind or any #Republican for that matter   #facktrump
941392823412195329 2017-12-14 19:41:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> The end of #NetNeutrality is the fault of #TrumpSupporters and Republican voters. #fackyoutoo
941362221619269633 2017-12-14 17:40:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> #NetNeutrality is dead. You no good sons of bitches @FCC @realDonaldTrump

941202020765192192 2017-12-13 07:03:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> Now @TheJimCornette is my favorite guy to listen to. Only one who makes sense to me and reminds me of a time when wrestling was straight up awesome. Not some of the nonsense we see now
941201126455640064 2017-12-13 07:00:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you voted for a #WhiteSupremacist like @realDonaldTrump then chances are you are one yourself or don't have a problem with #racism
941200249162534912 2017-12-13 06:56:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheDemocrats Not with a Republican party full of snakes. It's time to take the gloves off
941199977199603712 2017-12-13 06:55:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> When I see people go on social media to rip people on some kind of assistance my one thought is one day that could be you in the same situation. Remember one more thing someone close to you maybe on assistance too. #DontJudge #BeKind #MindYourOwnBusiness
940996761275043842 2017-12-13 17:28:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TinaFlintSmith Congrats to @tinaflintsmith on being appointed the the United States Senate by @GovMarkDayton. I got to meet her a couple years ago at the @MinnesotaDFL district 16 picnic. I have faith she will do a very good job and be a fighter for what is right   #DFL
940811372849520641 2017-12-12 05:11:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #Republicans were put on notice tonight. In 2018 we coming for you sucka and in 2020 you're next @realDonaldTrump
940807737390387200 2017-12-12 04:56:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's overtime for the @Timberwolves. Let's get it   #AllEyesNorth
940807475405754369 2017-12-12 04:55:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> So #RoyMoore is refusing to concede. How terrible something happens to him without his consent .
940806941198180352 2017-12-12 04:53:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> So tonight @TheGoodGodAbove wanted to @GDouglasJones to win tonight. God has spoken   #DougJones4Senate
940791952697647104 2017-12-12 03:54:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> What does @realDonaldTrump and #SteveBannon have in common. You're both losers tonight. @GDouglasJones wins and the @TheDemocrats pick up a seat   #DougJones
940790328113750016 2017-12-12 03:47:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sounds like @GDouglasJones is gonna win tonight. Do you believe in miracles. Thank you Alabama for doing the right thing   #DougJonesForSenate

940776232609878016 2017-12-12 02:51:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> It makes me sick that a child molester, racist and anti semantic is beating @GDouglasJones tonight . That says alot about Republican voters. It's time to start blaming the people who vote these awful people in office as @TheJimCornette has stated   #DougJones
940481736479264769 2017-12-11 07:21:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> Dolphin fans acting like they won the Superbowl tonight after beating the @Patriots yet Miami hasn't done a thing since 1972. Even the cowboys are better than Miami. It's on to next week.  #NewEnglandPatriots
940478361306062848 2017-12-11 07:08:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Do the right thing tomorrow and vote against a racist bigoted anti semantic #ChildMolesterRoyMoore and vote for someone who stands for the right thing in @GDouglasJones   #VoteDougJones
940069137157459969 2017-12-10 04:02:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Can't wait to see @bullyray5150 and @THETOMMYDREAMER return at @ringofhonor #FinalBattle

939212445180145664 2017-12-08 19:17:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #RepublicanParty went from  being the grand ole party to grand ole pedofile party
938973284217081856 2017-12-07 03:27:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> So to the @TheDemocrats that called on @SenFranken to resign then you need to do the same for @realDonaldTrump or you're just big hypocrites.  #ResignTrump
938970938309251073 2017-12-07 03:18:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> The same people who were critical towards @Kaepernick7 and others protesting against social injustice and racism by #TakeAKnee are silent that @realDonaldTrump has slashed funds for veteran programs. It was never about the flag or anthem was it. Racist you are
938852271944818689 2017-12-07 19:26:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today @SenFranken did the honorable thing to resign proving that @TheDemocrats have higher standards and morals than the #Republicans. Republicans support a child molester like Roy Moore and a man who brags about groping women like @realDonaldTrump #ResignTrump
938637355845603328 2017-12-06 05:12:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> I see @WWENXT will be headed to the former home of #wcwsaturdaynight @CenterStageAtl in 2018. How cool is that. Glad to see wrestling events still taking place in that arena
938636988445593600 2017-12-06 05:11:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> I just seen @CWFHollywood own Eric watts on @WWE #SmackdownLive
938615395229093888 2017-12-06 03:45:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why does Vance Joseph still have a job @Broncos @johnelway.  #FireVanceJoseph
938615045960937472 2017-12-06 03:44:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe @SenFranken should just switch parties. The republicans already have a groper as the so called President and endorsed #RoyMooreChildMolester. If he was Republican he wouldn't be called on to resign
938614502207229952 2017-12-06 03:41:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> I just seen the former heritage champion @PAvalon from @CWFHollywood on @WWE #SmackdownLive
938607293574385664 2017-12-06 03:13:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ericdayton one of my favorite things about #Minnesota is the cold weather. It's like paradise to me. If I ever move I'm staying in Minnesota. Just a bigger town
938584230061322240 2017-12-06 01:41:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> @SenFranken should resign only if groper in chief @realDonaldTrump does first. It is hypcritical of @SenateMajLdr and the republicans to call for Franken to resign while the support #RoyMooreChildMolestor and a groper who is the face of their party. @TheDemocrats have morals
938472762775130114 2017-12-06 18:18:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @SenFranken steps down then so should @realDonaldTrump for all the allegations against him.   #ResignTrump
938308235378950144 2017-12-05 07:24:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> It makes me wanna puke when I see that only @MittRomney and @JeffFlake put country over party and go against a child molester Roy Moore yet see the @RNC and the fake President @realDonaldTrump support a child molester. These # republicans and voters of Alabama have no morals
938102935967469568 2017-12-05 17:49:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> After years of having surpluses Thanks to @GovMarkDayton and the @MinnesotaDFL now we are back of being million of dollars into debt after the republicans take control. #TrickleDownEconomics is a scam   #mnleg
938102491480231937 2017-12-05 17:47:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well @HillaryClinton was right. #TrumpSupporters are #Deplorables. They support a child molester like #RoyMoore. #Childmolesters have found a home in the @GOP
937921597180207104 2017-12-04 05:48:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> So I got myself a @starwars #ChristmasTree skirt. Yes that is #fonzie hanging on my tree @hwinkler4real. I love the fonze toopic.twitter.com/GOUYpnyhmI

937920842222264322 2017-12-04 05:45:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's gonna be Tuesday and #VanceJoseph still has a job. You know what you have to do @johnelway.  #FireVanceJoseph #BroncosCountry
937901419000139776 2017-12-04 04:28:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> So now the @RNC now supports #childmolesterroymoore. Now the republicans are the party of child molesters. For anyone who voted Republican defend this and this is all on your hands. #ChildMolesters have found a home in the #RepublicanParty
937498826872631296 2017-12-03 01:48:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> So we see all these #Santas at malls and stores but no #Krampus. I'll be happy to take the role
937466130150641664 2017-12-03 23:38:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> #FireVanceJoseph @johnelway @Broncos
937456016295415808 2017-12-03 22:58:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> So sick of excuse after excuse from @Broncos coach #VanceJoseph. It can't be the fault of @TrevorSiemian @bosweiler17 @PaxtonLynch every time. The coach needs to take some personal responsibility as does @johnelway #BroncosCountry

937187536597913600 2017-12-02 05:11:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's sad I don't have much for family that hardly contacts me and very few friends. I really do live the #lonerlife.
937186962930372609 2017-12-02 05:09:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I hope #Krampus gets @realDonaldTrump @VP and the rest of the @GOP. I have no respect for you Awful pieces of shit.  #
937107681462145024 2017-12-02 23:54:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm done being nice and respectful to the other side. After the #goptaxscam I have no respect for any #Republicans or anyone who voted for them
937056427105013760 2017-12-02 20:30:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> Now we must make the lives of the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP a living hell. It's time to rise and fight back against them and their horseshit policies. #GOPTaxScam
937038651543998466 2017-12-02 19:19:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @GOP have started #ClassWarfare and now it's time we stand up and fight back. This isn't over. I'm 2018 we coming for you and in 2020 we coming for you @realDonaldTrump if #RobertMueller hasn't got you ready.   #goptaxscam #Bernie2020 #FightBack
936863282090057728 2017-12-01 07:43:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> Screw the @GOP and anyone who voted these crooked bastard into office. The #GOPTaxScam is on your hands to you stupid idiots
936825560839331840 2017-12-01 05:13:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill pic.twitter.com/0GTrjVWNhX
936825083661664265 2017-12-01 05:11:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you vote #Republican you're partially to blame for the #GOPTaxScam
936815928292937728 2017-12-01 04:34:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> To turtle face and all those sons of bitches of the @GOP @SenateMajLdr you can all burn in hell. I have no respect for a bunch of greedy bastards and immoral pieces of garbage   #GOPTaxScam
936658079814488064 2017-12-01 18:07:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @SenJohnMcCain who got cancer treatments through government healthcare will vote for a bill that will cause millions of Americans to be thrown off insurance including cancer patients so millionaires and billionaires get a huge tax cut   #GOPTaxScam
936657457551724546 2017-12-01 18:05:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Don't have much to say @realDonaldTrump
936649319649873925 2017-12-01 17:32:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a matter of time before @realDonaldTrump goes down.  #LockHimUp
936320997971591170 2017-11-30 19:48:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Rudolph facing the monster is like @realellsworth facing @BraunStrowman #ChristmasSpecials #WWE
936318123095068672 2017-11-30 19:36:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> The monster from #Rudolph reminds me of @BraunStrowman 
936108746274729984 2017-11-29 05:44:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm watching the #Supergirl and #flash crossover and the #Nazis are the bad guys. I live in a country where a knuckle f**k like @realDonaldTrump considers them very fine people.
936095117236203520 2017-11-29 04:50:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #GOPTaxScam should be motivation enough to go out and vote the #republicans out of office and the @TheDemocrats back in power. Don't forget 2020. We coming for you sucka @realDonaldTrump. Raising my taxes so millionaires and billionaires get welfare
935942431647916032 2017-11-29 18:43:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> So #MattLauer is fired for sexual misconduct. So when does @realDonaldTrump lose his job.
935780783268225024 2017-11-29 08:01:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WGNNews pic.twitter.com/byK6QFUmCV
935742026288594944 2017-11-28 05:27:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> So the  #GOPTaxScam will kick 13 million people off healthcare and those who make 30,000 or less like myself get a tax hike so a bunch of greedy millionaires and billionaires get a huge tax cut and handout. The @GOP are immoral and the biggest assholes I ever seen
935428958878879744 2017-11-28 08:43:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> I want to see @davemeltzerWON face @bruceprichard in a cage match. No referee. First one to climb out wins. @HeyHeyItsConrad can be at ringside if he wants
935406748793475072 2017-11-27 07:15:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> Win or lose I'm a @Broncos fan for life. Riding on some bad times right now but we been there before. If you're a bandwagon fan get off now  #BroncosCountry
935406314402074629 2017-11-27 07:13:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm happier being #single than I was when I was in a relationship..she was no loss. She made the choice to leave but I'm better for it. Certain things have to end for great things to begin. #straightup #LoveYourself #KnowYourWorth
935405589362040832 2017-11-27 07:10:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> The same people who are outraged @Kaepernick7 #TakeAKnee movement have been silent on @realDonaldTrump disrespecting  #NativeAmericans and his #Pocahontas reference of @elizabethforma while a portrait of Andrew Jackson is in the background who committed genocide by the way
935317425972793346 2017-11-27 01:20:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> If there was a contest for the biggest lying racist knuckle fuck then @realDonaldTrump would win   #TrumpIsAMoron
935311972425523201 2017-11-27 00:58:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump you're a big piece of shit and so are your knuckle fuck supporters  #facktrump

934948981796372481 2017-11-26 00:56:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> Someone needs to start taking ownership of this season. @johnelway #vancejoseph ownership. It's on you. Quit making excuses and blaming the quarterback. #BroncosCountry is pissed off.
934661835592228864 2017-11-25 05:55:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> So how many more superkicks will we see in this one match   #WatchROHpic.twitter.com/SpaR08izi7
934660034201563137 2017-11-25 05:48:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why does the #BulletClub pick on @TheFlipGordon.  #WatchROH
934656456581959680 2017-11-25 05:33:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Tonight on @ringofhonor tv @CWFHollywood own @ScorpioSky featured In a six man tag against the #BulletClub
934655510309154821 2017-11-25 05:30:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Starrcade was nothing more than a forgettable wwe house show. No one will remember it 5 hours from now or make you forget the @nwa starrcade. The kids today will never know or understand how important starrcade was.
934648853294452741 2017-11-25 05:03:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @nodqdotcom Like anyone cares about a pointless house show.pic.twitter.com/qZxcdGRAj1
934648124420870144 2017-11-25 05:00:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wtf @nytimes normalizing #nazis. Poor journalism and b.s.. Nazis are pieces of shit
934614699529949184 2017-11-25 02:48:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Single on #Christmas again this year. Story of my life
934612016316256256 2017-11-25 02:37:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> So #Starrcade is just some meaningless house show that will be forgotten tomorrow. Sad. I rather remember how it was. The kids today won't understand what starrcade means and how it was

933232585454493696 2017-11-21 07:16:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Evangelicals are offended when you tell them #HappyHolidays but they see no problem with supporting #childmolesterRoyMoore and sending him to Congress. That tells me alot about who they really are.
933066560679436291 2017-11-21 20:16:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I heard @BradPaisley is coming to @PREMIER_Center in #SiouxFalls this April. I got plenty of time to save money to go. Can't wait to attend another concert
932870497020334080 2017-11-20 07:17:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm sure @realDonaldTrump is disappointed that he couldn't pardon #CharlesManson and make him a member of his cabinet

932098763862237184 2017-11-18 04:10:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Waiting for @TheJimCornette to give his response to #WarGames
932084313541275648 2017-11-18 03:13:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> This isn't the #WarGames i remember. There were no pinfalls. It was submit or surrender. Wwe did screw this up but the match is alright
932078009397534721 2017-11-18 02:48:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> No roof on the cage for #WarGames. Wwe with a watered down version @BTT_Podcast

931436787582500865 2017-11-17 08:20:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> Was it @calebkonley or was it @blakeshelton voted as #PeopleMagazine sexist man of the year. They look alike. I'm confused 
931436368936488960 2017-11-17 08:18:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a matter of time before we see @realellsworth in @IMPACTWRESTLING

931433324345724929 2017-11-17 08:06:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Can we quit the slut shaming of @FLOTUS but also the accuser of @SenFranken. Nude modeling or modeling for a magazine doesn't make you a slut.   #StopIt
931432691819597825 2017-11-17 08:03:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> So Thanks to @SpeakerRyan and the crooked #Republicans my taxes go up so the rich and corporations get a huge tax cut and handout. #CorporateWelfare #GOPTaxScam
931228557619187712 2017-11-16 18:32:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> No roof on the cage for #WarGames We knew wwe would mess this up in someway
931221744630845444 2017-11-16 18:05:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm just waiting for #Republicans to call for a investigation of @realDonaldTrump and his sexual abuse allegations
931051237801385984 2017-11-15 06:48:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @LanceStorm It was a cool belt and it was a good fit for @JohnCena just not anyone else

930883304286547968 2017-11-15 19:40:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill If they were killed by cops for no reason he wouldn't give 2 craps about them or their lives
930880941026836480 2017-11-15 19:31:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> So these 3 players from #UCLA are thanking @realDonaldTrump for freeing them but if they were beat and killed by cops for no reason he would be defending the cops and calling the players thugs
930871923483054085 2017-11-15 18:55:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #GOPTaxScam is where the middle class get a tax hike and millions of Americans are stripped of health insurance while the rich get one big tax cut. There is nothing more despicable than a #Republican

930709073422639104 2017-11-15 08:08:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's sad how for me that on #Thanksgiving and #Christmas that no one will come around like they do any other day. It's their choice not mine. One day they will regret the time they missed spending with my grandma
930498676853805056 2017-11-14 18:12:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill So they believe in facism
930339177857716226 2017-11-13 07:38:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> The next challenger for the #TenPoundsOfGold should be @JamesStormBrand. I hear he is available @nwa @Lagana. How bout @IAmJericho as well
930337307382689792 2017-11-13 07:31:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> Conservatives breaking #Keurig coffee makers in support of #RoyMooreChildMolester is not only stupid but just shows what sickos they really are. @seanhannity is a sick freak too
930335224097050625 2017-11-13 07:22:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sexual harassment is wrong and not acceptable from anyone regardless of party. I'm with you @ErinMayeQuade
930334672378368000 2017-11-13 07:20:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> #RoyMooreChildMolester could eat children and lure them in a storm drain and #Republican voters would still vote for him. The problem is the people who vote these morons and crooks to office
930138783252664320 2017-11-13 18:22:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @seanhannity encourages his viewers to break a coffee maker for pulling ads during his show after he comes out in support of #RoyMooreChildMolester. How stupid is that. Breaking a coffee maker means you're wasting your own money
929933374646611969 2017-11-12 04:46:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> @IMPACTWRESTLING It was a ok show but it wasn't nothing great
929932934387249152 2017-11-12 04:44:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @RealSkipBayless #howboutthemcowboys 
929582010141757440 2017-11-11 05:29:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Russian documents 
929576461140398080 2017-11-11 05:07:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill He has done alot of backtracking in one night. Too bad he didn't do that when he was running for office
929558134527492096 2017-11-11 03:55:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well @seanhannity has shown what we all know he is. A scum bag and a piece of shit.  #FireHannity
929557725729689600 2017-11-11 03:53:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why leave the house when I can shop right at home  from my phone. Thankful for apps and modern technology @HotTopic @Target
929466152899760130 2017-11-11 21:49:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> #republican voters in alabama still support #RoyMooreChildMolester. Well @TheJimCornette was right when he said it's time to start blaming the people who vote these morons and crooks in
929464493473705984 2017-11-11 21:42:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Found a #BulletClub #UglyChristmasSweater on #ebay. Nothing like #Christmas and #prowrestling rolled into one
929451330422366208 2017-11-11 20:50:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Gophers win  #SkiUMah
929398474239627265 2017-11-11 17:20:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> @VP @CBSNews Any evidence or facts to that. The lies from them are terrible
929391607367065601 2017-11-11 16:53:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> This #Christmas I want to do something for someone else. Not sure what that is yet
929391348314247170 2017-11-11 16:52:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today consist of watching Christmas movies on @hallmarkchannel @hallmarkmovie and @UPtv. I just love #christmas and the #holidayseason. Have a great day everyone
929260880382103552 2017-11-11 08:13:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> So the #Republican #TaxReform is a big Tax cut for their donors and of course knuckle f**k himself @realDonaldTrump while those in the #middleclass get a tax hike.  #VoteThemOut
929260277866160129 2017-11-11 08:11:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @IconLounge @MidwestAllPro @UGeneDinsmore I have to work. Was hoping to plan to attend. I loved map mania this past summer
929259995929239552 2017-11-11 08:10:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> How can #Republicans come out against all these #Celebrities who have committed sexual abuse or misconduct but yet support and defend #RoyMooreChildMolester and @realDonaldTrump who is the face of their party
929243165604896768 2017-11-10 07:03:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BTT_Podcast @DrewMFarmer Superbrawl 92 was held there. One of my favorite events
928876634714923013 2017-11-09 06:47:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Diddy The next thing you know @diddy will be changing his name to @TheRealVirgil or #mrfuji. There is only one #BrotherLove and its @bruceprichard. Oh maybe I'll change my name to the #machoman since we're changing names
928472021931053056 2017-11-08 03:59:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Yes @garthbrooks wins @CountryMusic #EntertainerOfTheYear. One of the greatest of all time   #CMAawards
928465997056659456 2017-11-08 03:35:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> @mirandalambert #FemaleVocalistOfTheYear @CountryMusic I love it.  #CMAawards
928464307767128065 2017-11-08 03:28:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm loving this #twitter280 it's awesome
928459706254979072 2017-11-08 03:10:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching @carrieunderwood perform at the @CountryMusic awards isn't the same after you see her in concert. She was my first ever concert and only one to date at this point.  #CMAawards
928459166682841088 2017-11-08 03:08:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> I watched @IMPACTWRESTLING #BoundForGlory and for the most part is was a decent show. It wasn't horrible as others were saying
928458654529056768 2017-11-08 03:06:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> #IntergenderWrestling was better when we had matches like @ChynaJoanLaurer vs @RealJeffJarrett or @IAmJericho. @realellsworth couldn't beat a 90 year old woman in the nursing home
928457970203099136 2017-11-08 03:03:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Most of us are relieved that @JinderMahal is not @WWE champion. @AJStylesOrg vs @BrockLesnar at #SurvivorSeries will be money and a match we never thought we would ever see
928457622931558400 2017-11-08 03:02:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Congrats to the new @MinnesotaDFL #MplsMayor. Thank you for your service @MayorHodges. Let's keep moving forward. It was a great night for #Democrats across the country
928181560142127105 2017-11-08 08:45:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Congrats to @enderinciartem on his #GoldGlove @Braves #ChopOn
928181402402721792 2017-11-08 08:44:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> So who is the #bigloser tonight. It's not #Democrats it's @realDonaldTrump #ElectionDay
928175367109693441 2017-11-08 08:20:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> As far as I'm concerned @RicFlairNatrBoy is still the real world champion. Night peeps   #NatureBoy
928175222309736449 2017-11-08 08:19:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @30for30 can we get a documentary on #memphiswrestling and @JerryLawler @JerryJarrett
928127824296382464 2017-11-07 05:11:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @nwa was once known as the league they wrestle in   #ProWrestling
928113699298127872 2017-11-07 04:15:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm really becoming a huge fan of #ove @IMPACTWRESTLING
928111247874297861 2017-11-07 04:05:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Democrats keep on winning tonight. Take notice @realDonaldTrump. 2018 and 2020 we are coming for you
928103003046973440 2017-11-07 03:32:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's still real to me dammit. #kayfabe lives on   #NatureBoy
928102476296937472 2017-11-07 03:30:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wait wrestling is scripted. Back when kayfabe was alive it was as real as real gets and believable   #ProWrestling
927945704693264385 2017-11-07 17:07:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill He won't go on a diet because it's too hard 
927945094375845889 2017-11-07 17:05:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> Tonight it's #NatureBoy @RicFlairNatrBoy @30for30 on @espn. I can't wait.
927575212522131457 2017-11-06 16:35:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is only one #BrotherLove and its @bruceprichard not some guy who keeps changing his mind on what his name should be.
927556886228099072 2017-11-06 15:22:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> The victims of these gun massacres don't need your thoughts and prayers they need #GunControlNow. #EnoughIsEnough #NotOneMore #gunsense
927555547800449024 2017-11-06 15:17:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> @undisputed @RealSkipBayless cowboy fans say that every year then they fall flat on their faces. Tell us another one
927430506479681536 2017-11-05 07:00:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> #GunControl #EnoughIsEnough #enoughalready #DoSomething
927390583227854850 2017-11-05 04:21:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Well where were they today and all these other mass shootings. Every time one occurs they are no where to be found
927389902161043456 2017-11-05 04:19:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Tonight consist of watching #CountdowntoChristmas on @hallmarkchannel and a new #ChristmasMovie on @UPtv. Decorations go up next weekend
927358728738934785 2017-11-05 02:15:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CNN And nothing will be done as usual. The blood money of the nra means more to trump and the Republican party
927293108735369218 2017-11-05 21:54:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> @radiochick841 What's wrong with the 37 percent of people
927292879441145857 2017-11-05 21:53:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think @johnelway needs to take some responsibility for some of the poor decisions he has made the past few years   #BroncosCountry
927281054637002752 2017-11-05 21:06:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> If thoughts and prayers worked alone then the world would have no problems whatsoever. We would live in peace and harmony   #gunsense
927280033823166469 2017-11-05 21:02:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> @HideakiShibata1 @LanceStorm Well Viagra on a pole didn't help matters neither
927276397483216896 2017-11-05 20:48:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sending thoughts and prayers won't solve #gunviolence or any other problem in the world. Good laws do.   #gunsense #GunControlNow
927272708211138565 2017-11-05 20:33:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @TrevorSiemian was never the problem. Different quarterback same result. It's the offensive line stupid   #BroncosCountry
927236241799643136 2017-11-05 18:08:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> #BeatTheEagles @Broncos @bosweiler17 #BroncosCountry
927224454517846016 2017-11-05 17:21:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> @GreatBrianLast So we got a undercarder who put a broom stick over vs a main event superstar like @IAmJericho
927187320666841088 2017-11-05 14:54:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> #njwk12 it's @KennyOmegamanX vs @IAmJericho. This time Kenny you're not wrestling a broom stick
927031427883065344 2017-11-04 04:34:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Then why has so many of his businesses go bankrupt
927027754087997440 2017-11-04 04:20:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think #LarryDavid does a excellent impression of @BernieSanders but he just isn't that funny   #SNL
927024832889479168 2017-11-04 04:08:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's gonna be @RealNickAldis vs @TimStormNWA for the #TenPoundsOfGold @nwa world heavyweight championship soon on @CWFHollywood. Can't wait
927023264861446149 2017-11-04 04:02:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> I watched this week's @CWFHollywood and why is @CWFHNikko at ringside. What knowledge does he have to offer to his men.
926995902761447424 2017-11-04 02:13:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Happiness is a inside job. Don't depend on people or circumstances to be happy otherwise you will be highly disappointed and unhappy.
926922613279961089 2017-11-04 21:22:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm at the point where I've outgrown #smalltown life but cant afford to move at the moment.
926874112588382214 2017-11-04 18:09:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette i think @realDonaldTrump is about as good at running the country as jim herd was running wcw
926849730734444545 2017-11-04 16:32:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> #PapaJohns the official pizza of #nazis and #WhiteSupremacists everywhere.
926705948353335296 2017-11-04 07:01:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> I need to find my #purpose in life.
926705548766171136 2017-11-03 06:59:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> How is @IMPACTWRESTLING gonna have #BoundForGlory if they got no refs. No holds barred and no pinfalls. Could @RealJeffJarrett be right
926684385570689025 2017-11-03 05:35:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Putin is wanting his blow job from trump 
926683922179772416 2017-11-03 05:33:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> @KellyO @NBCNews Did they realize they were in Kenya 
926666020886077441 2017-11-03 04:22:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Thornstowe_Scum Both teams are awesome.
926632084118147077 2017-11-03 02:07:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> not sure what a #realdemocrat is suppose to look like or be. If the @DNC was being corrupt a year ago then they need to be held accountable
926317573209251840 2017-11-02 05:18:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> What's going on with @IMPACTWRESTLING. Why are these talents leaving ???
926308066827620352 2017-11-02 04:40:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> Instead of being #Thankful for the month of #November we need to be thankful all year round.
926164579146661888 2017-11-02 19:10:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill It's because #PapaJohns sucks and is bad pizza
926153672853254144 2017-11-02 18:26:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWE @TheRobertGibson They also collided at wcw superbrawl 3 the same exact year. The most legendary feud in the history of Smokey mountain wrestling
926125018706300929 2017-11-02 16:33:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> #taketheknee doesn't affect pizza sales. #PapaJohns just sucks and is nasty. Maybe stop using cheap ingredients.
926124780163665921 2017-11-02 16:32:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> @gwinnettbraves Look what came today my @tonyschiavone24 @GwinnettBraves bobblehead @HeyHeyItsConrad. Wrestling and baseball all rolled into onepic.twitter.com/w6ULT3sOAq
925964577862508544 2017-11-01 05:55:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @realDonaldTrump condemned a Arabic man connected to Isis for the same thing #nazis did this summer except he stayed silent on them
925963867582337025 2017-11-01 05:52:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Blaming black athletes that #TakeAKnee because you're losing money #PapaJohns is stupid. You lost business because your pizza sucks 
925938869069115392 2017-11-01 04:13:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm not a fan of neither team but I'm glad to see one of my all time favorite @Braves players #brianmccann win a #WorldSeries
925769958654644226 2017-11-01 17:02:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @bosweiler17 is the starting quarterback for the @Broncos let's rally around him like we did @TrevorSiemian.  #BroncosCountry
925769460333596672 2017-11-01 17:00:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Says the rich millionaire who can't afford health insurance for his employees
925627487417233408 2017-11-01 07:36:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wrestling was better when #kayfabe wasn't dead @TheJimCornette @BTT_Podcast
925608319976386560 2017-10-31 06:19:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Sting vs @JakeSnakeDDT spin the wheel make the deal #wcwhalloweenhavoc92pic.twitter.com/vd6XkrNXT0

925409993624518658 2017-10-31 17:11:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill It's like a church except a different religion/faith
925258967533662208 2017-10-31 07:11:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm cheering you on @RealJeffJarrett

925199880552878080 2017-10-30 03:16:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> These #Broncos are disgraceful sadly.  #BroncosCountry

925041594188861443 2017-10-30 16:47:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill He failed on his own however when republicans wanted Obama to fail it was a whole different story
925025347724365824 2017-10-30 15:43:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy #IndictmentDay and #MuellerMonday @realDonaldTrump you're going down too

924747098964283392 2017-10-29 21:17:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> I've been asked what I want for #Christmas but I don't really know of anything I really want that can be bought in a store
924517891285929985 2017-10-28 06:06:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> If the @nwa is looking for a home base how bout #Atlanta #StLouis. A couple of the old school wrestling cities
924491996114321408 2017-10-28 04:24:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Whoa @ScorpioSky from @CWFHollywood challenging @CodyRhodes for the @ringofhonor world heavyweight championship   #ROH

924463013096247296 2017-10-28 02:28:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> That match between @calebkonley and @jeffboom86 was awesome @TheWCWC #wcwc #prowrestling
924459038825484289 2017-10-28 02:13:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching the latest @TheWCWC on YouTube and this @jeffboom86 is pretty awesome   #prowrestling
924457253385789440 2017-10-28 02:05:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm watching #CountdowntoChristmas on @hallmarkchannel because why not. I watched them in July too
924454697762721792 2017-10-28 01:55:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm a white dude and say #WhiteLivesMatter is f'n stupid as hell. Y'all are morons and white supremacist.

924102264196947970 2017-10-27 02:35:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> #STARRCADE is a very sacred thing in #prowrestling. Wwe taking it is disgraceful. It will never be as good as the @nwa Crocket years

923611069028892675 2017-10-26 18:03:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> The one reason I started watching #ImpactWrestling again was because of @RealJeffJarrett. Their best years were under him.

922884198993670147 2017-10-24 17:55:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Toure It would be a horror film
922873860390883329 2017-10-24 17:14:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Whoa @RealJackSwagger vs @elidrake_LP vs #johnnyimpact @WrestleCade
922688162052308992 2017-10-23 04:56:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> So what does the future hold for @GFWWrestling. I wish @RealJeffJarrett the very best and hope he gets back in the game soon
922687632978731008 2017-10-23 04:54:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill So whatever happen to personal responsibility I hear so much from conservatives all the time. I guess it doesn't apply to them

922520586181578758 2017-10-23 17:50:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Broncos @TrevorSiemian @antztru24 Very true
922513302751727617 2017-10-23 17:21:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's not the entire fault of @TrevorSiemian for the @Broncos offensive troubles. The offensive line is at fault too.  #BroncosCountry
922511202353401857 2017-10-23 17:13:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> It was a big surprise to see @RealNickAldis confront @nwa world heavyweight champion @TimStormNWA on @CWFHollywood. Another awesome show

920819507802886144 2017-10-18 01:10:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm surprised that @tedcruz took time from his porn watching to debate @BernieSanders tonight   #CNNDebateNight

920512518463901697 2017-10-17 04:51:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace and a big piece of shit for telling a soldier's widow he knew what he signed up for..no respect

919361520412385280 2017-10-14 00:37:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> Instead of being negative about some of my current life situations I'm thankful for the life i have.  #positivity #lifeisgood
919270227120132099 2017-10-14 18:34:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Cubs will we ever see a @LenKasper bobblehead. I mean who wouldn't want one
919253410876182529 2017-10-14 17:27:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> So it was #vast that unhooked our connections from the outside not @GetSpectrum having issues. Vast is crooked

918829214996074498 2017-10-13 13:22:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's about time people rise up in this town and start calling out and exposing the #tracymn city council for the crooks they are
918828765865762817 2017-10-13 13:20:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> A sexual abusing Nazi sympathizing white supremacist dictator @realDonaldTrump takes #Healthcare away from millions of Americans piece of

918274942210314240 2017-10-11 00:39:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Da man @Goldberg was on the @TheGoldbergsABC tonight on @ABCNetwork #awesomeness
918001901358247936 2017-10-10 06:34:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Eminem is the f'n man   #GOAT #BETHIPHOPAWARDS2017
917826445984108544 2017-10-10 18:57:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> I bet @nflcommish doesn't care if there are NFL players who are Nazis carrying tiki torches.  #TakeAKnee
917788740835307526 2017-10-10 16:27:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @realDonaldTrump is quick to slam @jemelehill but finds that #WhiteSupremacists and #nazis are very fine people  #StandWithJemele
917782453443612672 2017-10-10 16:02:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> If #TakeAKnee to protest against social injustice and racism is wrong then I don't want to be right.
917602478434279429 2017-10-09 04:07:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> The suspension of @jemelehill is proof how entrenched racism is in our institutions   #StandWithJemele

917562761705426945 2017-10-09 01:29:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Too bad @realDonaldTrump can't get suspended for his tweeting because it's a bad reflection on the whole country   #standwithJemele
917558871861981184 2017-10-09 01:14:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe it's time to #BoycottESPN for their outrageous actions against @jemelehill #standwithJemele
917558641837953024 2017-10-09 01:13:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's b.s. that @jemelehill was suspended for speaking out against Jerry Jones. So she can't speak out neither. B.s.   #standwithJemele
917548534391504896 2017-10-09 00:33:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey ESPN I stand with @jemelehill. Same network that hired white supremacist hank Williams Jr back  #standwithJemele
917544703696007168 2017-10-09 00:17:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> It really disgust me that I'm related to #racist  I'll never sink to their level
917444007223087104 2017-10-09 17:37:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Does a #columbusdaysale mean I walk in the store and say this is all mine now
917426929078362114 2017-10-09 16:29:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> So today I'm gonna walk in the wrong house and say it's mine.  #IndigenousPeoplesDay #ColumbusDay
917189648119672832 2017-10-08 00:47:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #Republicanbudget slashes #Pellgrants. They are hurting their own voting base.
917189118370701313 2017-10-08 00:45:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm a #bachelor and staying that way. No one is out there that can change this
917188050379264000 2017-10-08 00:40:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @MikePenceVP you might as leave the oval office too. Nobody wants Nazi sympathizing white supremacist like you and @realDonaldTrump
917187784665858048 2017-10-08 00:39:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> So let me get this straight. Guns save lives but #Healthcare kills people.  #republicanlogic
916926711551418368 2017-10-08 07:22:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I should be living in a town where there are #indywrestling shows every #saturdaynight

916888633742897152 2017-10-07 04:50:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why worry about #HurricaneNate when @realDonaldTrump says #climatechange is a Chinese hoax. Don't buy #FakeNews

915646486150565888 2017-10-04 18:35:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> It is disgusting that the so called President @realDonaldTrump is telling the people of #PuertoRico that they are a budget crisis.
915600271857917953 2017-10-04 15:31:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> The same politicians who send their thoughts and prayers are the ones who take #bloodmoney of the nra and do nothing,  #GunControlNow

912730863259066369 2017-09-26 17:29:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Trump does but NFL players don't. Ok got ya. It only applies if you agree with a Nazi sympathizing white supremacist like trump
912714642362859520 2017-09-26 16:25:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you're booing or burning merchandise to any NFL team who did #TakeAKnee then it's not about the flag or anthem is it.
912713308062539777 2017-09-26 16:19:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette Today's wrestling sucks.

912516020883066881 2017-09-25 03:15:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Some how @DavidArquette isn't a bad world heavyweight champion anymore after seeing @real1 as #CruiserweightChampion
912513908359008256 2017-09-25 03:07:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> And after this #RAW segment people wonder why older fans think wrestling sucks now days
912513329289101312 2017-09-25 03:05:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> The idea of @TheRealDisco being #CruiserweightChampion in #WCW isn't so bad after @real1 won it. Even Oklahoma was better
912510010101522437 2017-09-25 02:51:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wait @real1 gets the last segment on #RAW. No wonder ratings are in the toilet. Even Oklahoma was a better champion.
912504656747798529 2017-09-25 02:30:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> When people who claim to be your family don't even value you unless you do something for them. Maybe it's cut off time   #KnowYourWorth
912480899866009600 2017-09-25 00:56:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CBSNews It's a Nazi rally if a Nazi is speaking right
912472743601467394 2017-09-25 00:23:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @YouTube @GreatBrianLast Listening now. @TheJimCornette is the one guy that makes any sense to me
912469863846817792 2017-09-25 00:12:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Makes sense since most of his supporters are #WhiteSupremacists
912347764310278144 2017-09-25 16:07:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a #bluejeans @LugzNYC type of #Autumn day. I love fall
912347320267747328 2017-09-25 16:05:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> So its disrespectful to #TakeTheKnee to protest #racism and #socialinjustice but be ok with a Nazi sympathizing white supremacist as prez

912104328936218624 2017-09-24 23:59:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's disrespectful that we have a so called President @realDonaldTrump and his party who want to strip millions of healthcare   #ACA
912102305587191808 2017-09-24 23:51:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think it's very disrespectful to our country and flag that @realDonaldTrump is a Nazi sympathizer and #WhiteSupremacist #TakeTheKnee
912046062793379840 2017-09-24 20:08:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> Tough loss today @Broncos. Get back on track next week. It's only week 3.  #BroncosCountry

911624573996666880 2017-09-23 16:13:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> I knew I loved @KingJames for a reason.
911622231867969536 2017-09-23 16:04:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> @KirkHerbstreit did Bob barker dress you today   #CollegeGameDay
911620847504326656 2017-09-23 15:58:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Take that as a badge of honor @StephenCurry30 and @warriors for not getting invited to the white house.

911477811784945664 2017-09-22 06:30:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Kaepernick7 should have a job and #WhiteSupremacist @realDonaldTrump should be unemployed living in a well

911470929917640705 2017-09-22 06:02:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump has more anger towards black NFL players protesting against social injustice than he did #nazis and #WhiteSupremacists
911467355259187200 2017-09-22 05:48:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> #RocketMan vs #DotardTrump what a sad state of affairs in the world.
911459797924499458 2017-09-22 05:18:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> The people around me rather dwell on what's and who is gone rather than appreciate what's in front of them. I like life #movingforward

911447779670716416 2017-09-22 04:30:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump keeps proving what we all know what he is.  #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist
911444685830451200 2017-09-22 04:18:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump thought the #nazis in #Charlottesville were very fine people but not @Kaepernick7 protesting   #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist
911411860221628417 2017-09-22 02:08:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump has spent more time condemning @jemelehill and @Kaepernick7 than he ever did #nazis #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #dotard
911410993074499584 2017-09-22 02:04:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> Like #JayZ I have nothing but disrespect for that orange Nazi sympathizer @realDonaldTrump and won't be letting up anytime soon   #Resist

911121384369160192 2017-09-21 06:54:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> @politico That shows how pro life they really on and what Christian people they are. Frauds
911105857055727616 2017-09-21 05:52:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I wouldn't trade what I have with her for millions of dollars. I'm blessed. Got the best woman in the world.   #longdistancerelationship
911105488548274176 2017-09-21 05:50:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> Remember in 2000 #Vincerusso would walk out on #wcwmondaynitro like he was some bad ass. What a fraud. In 2017 he  fears @TheJimCornette
911105144086859776 2017-09-21 05:49:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> #happybelatedbirthday @TrentShelton you have inspired me with the #LOVEYOURSELF video and helped me be better than I was

910941766274215936 2017-09-21 19:00:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> Apparently Saturday is the #endoftheworld well wasn't it suppose to end a few years ago already. People are dumb enough to believe this b.s.
910924532428439555 2017-09-21 17:51:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just like #RicFlair #STARRCADE can never be duplicatedpic.twitter.com/wUfyhxttz9
910916729001463808 2017-09-21 17:20:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @Kaepernick7 gets booed for not standing for the flag. @BarackObama gets booed for standing for the flag. Hmmm
910916418543251456 2017-09-21 17:19:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> #STARRCADE can never be duplicated. I'm not interested in this poor wwe knockoff of it
910915986143969284 2017-09-21 17:17:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Trumpcare is proof that @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP have no morals and aren't Christians. This bill is a death sentence   #ProtectOurCare

910566337176629257 2017-09-20 18:08:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> #HealthcareIsAHumanRight but the republicans want to make sure that doesn't happen @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris @SenFranken @amyklobuchar

910565460722307072 2017-09-20 18:04:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> The Republican healthcare plan just shows how pro life they really on. The rich get a big tax cut that's all it is   #ACARepeal
910401280278921216 2017-09-20 07:12:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> I hear @CWFHollywood will be headed to some @TheCW markets on Saturday mornings. I'm happy to hear #saturdaymorningwrestling is back

910397675530588160 2017-09-19 06:58:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> #healthcare is a basic and human right but the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump believe you should die so the rich can have a tax cut   #ACA
910397267001081856 2017-09-19 06:56:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> If the #GOP passes #Trumpcare many will die because of it. They are pro life until you're born then its f**k you we don't care   #ACA
910383301101318144 2017-09-19 06:01:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'll remember #Starrcade as it was from Jim Crockett promotions. Not some rip off wwe is coming up with.
910366432243961857 2017-09-19 04:54:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> Rampage 91 coliseum video is where you get golf instruction from #BobbyTheBrain and @MeanGeneHotline hosted by @SeanMooneyWho.
910356761890230277 2017-09-19 04:15:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> So once again the republicans are trying to get their #deathpanel #Trumpcare #Healthcare pan passed.  #ProtectOurCare #ACASavesLives

910023375577387008 2017-09-18 06:10:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Trumpcare is just a tax cut for the rich. Be honest. It will affect and hurt alot of people like other bad Republican policies   #ACA
910019444709232640 2017-09-18 05:55:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> I don't believe for one moment that wwe is paying tribute to #Starrcade we all know how Vince felt about wcw and #crockettpromotions
910018186988400640 2017-09-18 05:50:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you ask to prove that trump is racist then you're a moron.  #TrumpsAWhiteSupremacist #StandWithJemele   I'm with you @jemelehill

909151384351772673 2017-09-16 20:25:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's ok if you're on espn attacking other black people  and kissing up to the Donald but the truth isn't   #StandWithJemele
909150111409860608 2017-09-16 20:20:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @JRsBBQ and @HeymanHustle was a underrated announce team back in the day.  #prowrestling
909149718831419393 2017-09-16 20:19:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching #wcwsaturdaynight from 1991 opening match @Hustler2754 vs #rickymorton #oldschool #prowrestling
909113347219607552 2017-09-16 17:54:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Someone as bad as white supremacist trump will do anything to make himself look good
909112503015178240 2017-09-16 17:51:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> You could wake up #saturdaymorning in the 90s and listen to #gordonsolie #dustyrhodes #larryzybysko call the action for wcw pro. I miss it
909104942216024064 2017-09-16 17:21:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @JordanUhl They never did that to the Nazis during their attack in #Charolettesville. Hmmm
908881114714050560 2017-09-15 02:31:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @jemelehill came out in support of the orange Nazi sympathizer like say Stephen a Smith has then it be a different story.  #SupportJemele
908868743362699265 2017-09-15 01:42:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill But if athletes are out making political statements of any kind it is sports related like it or not
908868351962828800 2017-09-15 01:41:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @GovVentura you were right about #hulkhogan all those years. He is a scum bag. Bigger than I thought. It breaks my heart
908866818445647872 2017-09-15 01:35:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> #NoJusticeNoPeace another cop gets away with murder of a unarmed black civilian. All lives don't matter and this is why @Kaepernick7 kneels
908853540873007109 2017-09-15 00:42:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> One reason @jemelehill is being singled out is because she is a strong black woman. #ImWithHer and is a great journalist   #IStandWithJemele
908729606949281792 2017-09-15 16:29:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> I miss classic #saturdaynightwrestling and #saturdaymorningwrestling on t.v.. from the 70s to the early 90s that was a thing.

908570543053344773 2017-09-14 05:57:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Those people are either Nazis or Nazi sympathizers
908552002354823168 2017-09-14 04:44:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> Some people are more outraged over not worshipping a piece of cloth and a song than black civilians getting killed by cops   #IStandWithKap
908537902220681216 2017-09-14 03:48:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MSNBC I bet she needed a magnifying glass to see them since they were so tiny
908532500829544453 2017-09-14 03:26:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @VinceMcMahon never lost a lawsuit we would still have the #worldwrestlingfederation #SmackDownLIVE

908165312754982918 2017-09-13 03:07:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump and his cronies at the white house has spent more time attacking @jemelehill a strong black woman than he did #nazis
908164908948344832 2017-09-13 03:06:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> @HeyHeyItsConrad love your interviews with @tonyschiavone24. Could you cover Halloween havoc 99 sometime

908164163561803776 2017-09-13 03:03:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BrendajCardenas Amen to that. It took me so long to realize that and to love myself
908160933784178689 2017-09-13 02:50:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Don't ever try to use a circumstance against me when i already own #mylife. I'm making the best out of what i have.
908157420937121792 2017-09-13 02:36:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill I'm sure @tedcruz Ted is disappointed
908151769586393088 2017-09-13 02:13:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm offending #WhiteSupremacists tonight for standing with @jemelehill speaking the truth. I love offending these losers   #iStandwithJemele
908147555296477185 2017-09-13 01:57:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> @SInow Saying the truth is a firable offense. Who knew. I wonder what lying gets you
908144693791412225 2017-09-13 01:45:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> I support @jemelehill. There is no doubt that the orange Nazi sympathizer is a #WhiteSupremacist.  #iStandwithJemele 
908143045882863617 2017-09-13 01:39:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe @realDonaldTrump should of been fired off the @ApprenticeNBC for questing the birth place of @BarackObama. I support @jemelehill

908003578459164672 2017-09-13 16:24:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @HEELZiggler quit mocking legends of #prowrestling and do your own thing. Back when those legends were on top people actually watched
908003093496950785 2017-09-13 16:23:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> @jemelehill spoke the truth. Donald trump is a #WhiteSupremacist and let's not forget a #nazi sympathizer

907684042765688832 2017-09-12 19:15:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Pointing out #whitepeople loot too is somehow a political view. All races do it. Like who doesn't want free stuff. Media will say otherwise
907683382611660801 2017-09-12 19:12:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Looking back #Rickythedragonsteamboat and @TheFranchiseSD was a really good tag team

907485383956541440 2017-09-11 06:05:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @NBCNightlyNews Trump and republicans are only pro life before you're born and if you're white

906747455991140352 2017-09-09 05:13:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> But she doesn't exist I'm #single forever https://twitter.com/PositiveMinds__/status/906728960867827713
906714022099251200 2017-09-09 03:00:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> I bet the @realboogey could take #Pennywise
906675344865943554 2017-09-09 00:27:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hoping not only to escape #smalltown life find my #soulmate and live happily ever after.
906674699157082113 2017-09-09 00:24:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm much too young for #smalltown life.
906637269452419074 2017-09-09 21:55:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Quit fighting over @BernieSanders and @HillaryClinton and move forward. The 2016 election is over and we must keep moving forward
906625149889339394 2017-09-09 21:07:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> Disappointed @RealMMartinez didn't win the @MaeYoungClassic she is no doubt a favorite of mine. I even like her over @SashaBanksWWE
906579291235909632 2017-09-09 18:05:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sometimes I think I'm gonna be a late bloomer in life then I remember so was @RealDDP
906578632956674048 2017-09-09 18:02:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> She wasn't meant to stay but I'm #MovingForward it's not breaking me. Keeping #faith in #God I'll find my one true #soulmate. It gets better
906368932013121536 2017-09-08 04:09:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> It amazes me how stupid enough people are to believe the b.s. of #RushLimbaugh and #AlexJones
906362352043483136 2017-09-08 03:43:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> Enjoyed this week's @GFWWrestling @IMPACTWRESTLING.
906349950958817280 2017-09-08 02:54:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Someday I hope I'm not #single anymore and find that one person I can commit to and won't walk out on me.
906349613589975040 2017-09-08 02:52:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Read the interview @davemeltzerWON had with @EdNordholm and glad to hear @GFWWrestling is staying around. I wish nothing but the  best
906349224551383046 2017-09-08 02:51:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Delilah_Aguilar I know how that feels
906348878164844544 2017-09-08 02:49:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy birthday @BernieSanders continue to fight the good fight.
906343354648207362 2017-09-08 02:27:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MisterSalesman @605pod @bobbyblaze744 I remember watching you on Wcw Saturday night
906330473403731968 2017-09-08 01:36:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm sadden to find out that #TroyGentry one half of one of my favorite duos in #CountryMusic @mgunderground has died. Loved their #music
906211305060782080 2017-09-08 17:43:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette saying that you're a lunatic to begin if you trust a Republican. The man speaks truth
906206366615961600 2017-09-08 17:23:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> Time to move on from that loss last night @Patriots and look towards week 2 and no people #TomBrady isn't going downhill
906206087128502272 2017-09-08 17:22:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> I've had downfalls in my life too so I'll just blame @BernieSanders even if its not his fault.
906205399212318722 2017-09-08 17:19:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> Everyone wants the #mondaynightwars back I'm here like i want the territory days back when they had good wrestling @BTT_Podcast
905975098103955458 2017-09-07 02:04:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> Really love the podcast interview of @tonyschiavone24. Very interesting hearing his thoughts on what happened with wcw

905475822961733633 2017-09-06 17:00:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> #MELANIATRUMP was a #dreamer too until she found herself a old #SugarDaddy in @realDonaldTrump
905461215731863552 2017-09-06 16:02:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> I #LoveMyself enough to know my worth and to stay #single. My girlfriend left but I cherish myself even if other people don't.
905335177450319872 2017-09-06 07:41:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Keep the #Dreamers deport the #WhiteSupremacists #nazis and @realDonaldTrump
905320197644591107 2017-09-05 06:42:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette @LJinLaredo Old school wrestling is better than anything wwe these days. One reason why I started a dvd collection
905313104850030592 2017-09-05 06:13:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ShannonSharpe calling out the @Broncos and @johnelway on @undisputed today. You're awesome man. Speaking exactly how I feel
905312576938049537 2017-09-05 06:11:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Got the latest @simpleplan album. I lost my girlfriend but I fall more and more for #music. Plus I like a variety of it
905312163484577792 2017-09-05 06:10:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Remember all the benefits #unions got. They fought for them. Keeping on fighting @fightfor15
905311786198556672 2017-09-05 06:08:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you ask me @RealJeffJarrett taking a leave of absence from @GFWWrestling is one big angle. Keep watching @IMPACTWRESTLING folks
905310940396224512 2017-09-05 06:05:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is no one amazing enough to make me quit being #single. I love myself enough to protect my heart more now
905310591597850625 2017-09-05 06:03:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wish I could of attend #SmackDownLIVE in #siouxfalls tonight but it fell on the wrong Tuesday. Will attend a @MidwestAllPro show this fall
905309836203761665 2017-09-05 06:00:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> So there is a happening October 7th at the home of @Rebecca_Otto and it's a Saturday. Thinking myself and my friend rosemary will attend
905309479603974144 2017-09-05 05:59:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> So focused on myself and being #single I don't want anyone. Not worth the time or effort if I'm just gonna get hurt. I'm #MovingForward
905309042272292865 2017-09-05 05:57:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you're a Christian and support the decision of the orange Nazi sympathizer to end the #DACA then you might want to read your bible again
905281467089133568 2017-09-05 04:08:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Alot of drama going on with @GFWWrestling And @RealJeffJarrett. I hope double j can come back.
905280610557710337 2017-09-05 04:04:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just watched the latest video of @TrentShelton and now I must find my purpose and make dreams become reality
905116452973273088 2017-09-05 17:12:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> The orange Nazi sympathizer is not only a racist bigoted liar but a cruel human being for ending the #DACA.   #DefendDACA #DefendDREAMers
904957523211550720 2017-09-04 06:41:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Not knowing if I'm #single again is driving me crazy. It's been over a month since I heard from her.   #longdistancerelationship
904902522116198400 2017-09-04 03:02:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> @washingtonpost We are currently living one with the orange Nazi sympathizer as President. I'll take my chances with #IT
904902060457562112 2017-09-04 03:00:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> How could the @mikethemiz brag about breaking records of  @UltimateWarrior and @OfficialHTM when they broke records in 1 or 2 reigns
904900872060227584 2017-09-04 02:55:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you oppose #unions then you don't even know what #LaborDay is about
904900099419111424 2017-09-04 02:52:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWEGraves how can you say that @real1 would cheat on his girlfriend if he doesn't have one   #RAW
904899398131437569 2017-09-04 02:50:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's feeling like #Autumn tonight and I love it. Won't miss summer at all

904891230898843649 2017-09-04 02:17:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> I support all those out fighting for #FightFor15. Keeping unionizing and don't give up. We all deserve a #livingwage @fightfor15
904890075049275393 2017-09-04 02:13:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @WWERomanReigns is a cheap bootleg of @JohnCena then that makes cena a cheap bootleg of @TheRock and @HulkHogan #CenavsReigns

903838651360141312 2017-09-01 04:35:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill It's funny how the cops who actually kill black folks don't get fired but this one says it and he is gone hmmm
903838280583663618 2017-09-01 04:33:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> Was disappointed I missed a wrestling show in May and disappointed i have to experience another box car days

903679111532601345 2017-09-01 18:01:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette Chances are this person tweeting Jim is a right-wing mentally ill trump supporter
903678194485788673 2017-09-01 17:57:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> Back to being a #single dude. I have a good heart and soul. You have to be amazing to change my relationship status again
903666386169470976 2017-09-01 17:10:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm one of the #realist guys around and I don't need many friends. I won't let people define me. I define myself
903467307552325633 2017-08-31 03:59:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well looks like it's back to being #single not sure what else to do at this point. I'm so used to being alone
903465678279032833 2017-08-31 03:52:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Anyone really surprised this corrupt coon is joining the Nazi sympathizer
903335393487200257 2017-08-31 19:15:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @thehill Kelly Ann con job is a moron. Telling people good luck after they lose their home to flooding is compassion. Good Lord
903334597873860608 2017-08-31 19:12:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe after not hearing from for a month its time to #Moveon and #MoveForward. Too good to be true

902962098220740608 2017-08-30 18:31:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> All @realDonaldTrump does is feed is big ego and greed
902958880350773248 2017-08-30 18:19:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> Houston is underwater and the so called President @realDonaldTrump is campaigning in Missouri. Again he is a piece of  #NotMyPresident
902958002860326912 2017-08-30 18:15:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> Got another @skilletmusic album today and another one on its way. Next time they come to #siouxfalls I hope to get to the show
902951773559803904 2017-08-30 17:50:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> #LakewoodChurch was never flooded to begin with. Don't buy the lies of a #FakeChristian
902951352959160320 2017-08-30 17:49:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> No negative people allowed in my life. I don't need those types   #positivity

902578430214115329 2017-08-29 17:07:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> God didn't change the heart of #JoelOsteen #Twitter did   #FakeChristian #fraud #whatwouldjesusdo
902428591077679106 2017-08-29 07:11:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> Honestly I'm glad I never ended up with my #Highschoolcrush it's the best thing to happen because she wasn't meant for me. Someone better is

900951654689722368 2017-08-24 05:23:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's unfortunate that @WWEAsuka had to give her title because of injury. The only one that had a dominate reign then injured was #rickrude

900565852050907136 2017-08-23 03:50:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why is it the same people who condemn @Kaepernick7 protesting stay silent on other Americans carrying Nazi and confederate flags

898071399448932352 2017-08-16 06:38:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> @kare11 Why not. They are just participation trophies honoring losers and quitters
898067241622802432 2017-08-16 06:21:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> I don't know what @WWEAsuka said to @WWEEmberMoon but I think she is gonna open a can a whoop ass at #NXTTakeOverBrooklyn
898059321103331328 2017-08-16 05:50:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Any chance of @DwyaneWade headed back to #southbeach to the @MiamiHEAT if there is a buyout from the @chicagobulls
898054975435280384 2017-08-16 05:32:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> @VinceMcMahon and @JerryLawler was a underrated broadcast team
898050083593347072 2017-08-16 05:13:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> #highschoolreunions sorry I don't live in the past. I live in the present working on me and working towards being the best me I can be
898049428933799937 2017-08-16 05:10:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> Any #Republican who stands with @realDonaldTrump is a #NaziSympathizer like he is. This isnt a left vs right issue
898048951454191616 2017-08-16 05:08:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you have a girlfriend but no current contact. Ugh   #longdistancerelationship   Hope panda bear is ok
898010886824009728 2017-08-16 02:37:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> I forgot the #CMTS2017 was on 
898010486477799424 2017-08-16 02:35:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> @JinderMahal saying he is the reason people subscribe to the @WWENetwork ha he is the reason people turn their devices off
898010029286207489 2017-08-16 02:34:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Kick out @RicFlairNatrBoy keep fighting don't give up. My thoughts are with you and with @MsCharlotteWWE
898009688708534272 2017-08-16 02:32:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realboogey @ChrisAdonis @TheRealXPac @IconLounge @MidwestAllPro Is it a meet and greet
898009557557006337 2017-08-16 02:32:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> If anyone continues to support @realDonaldTrump then you're just a Nazi sympathizer like he and pence is. I have no respect for you
897852272587272195 2017-08-16 16:07:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Kudos to @KingJames on his comments and standing for what is right
897852006236385280 2017-08-16 16:06:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> This isn't left vs right. Democrat vs Republican. This is right vs wrong. @realDonaldTrump shows who he truly is and stands with #nazism
897709377087557632 2017-08-15 06:39:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you see a #Nazi go punch them. It's the American thing to gopic.twitter.com/4g9SfIxG2T
897701963432939521 2017-08-15 06:10:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> One of my favorite @SummerSlam moments is the rebirth of the #Undertaker in 94. Nothing beats #oldschoolwrestling
897698230456242177 2017-08-15 05:55:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> A year ago we had a #POTUS we could be proud of in @BarackObama now we have a #NazisInTheWhiteHouse so sad and disgusted   #ImpeachTrump
897697227703013379 2017-08-15 05:51:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> So ashamed of this country and that it elected a #Nazi sympathizer like @realDonaldTrump I'm disgusted   #ImpeachTrumppic.twitter.com/AMvlQSVKpA
897694098320232449 2017-08-15 05:38:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> No doubt that @BretHart vs #owenhart at @SummerSlam 94 is one of the greatest #steelcage matches in @WWE history
897649675511136261 2017-08-15 02:42:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Will watch #SmackDownLIVE on Hulu tomorrow but how many times do #SummerSlam get mentioned
897649428798025729 2017-08-15 02:41:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> As far as next labor day is concerned I'll be walking with the @MinnesotaDFL
897647656767565827 2017-08-15 02:34:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you still support #DonaldTrump I want nothing to do with you. I don't want to be associated with those who support #NazisInTheWhiteHouse
897637596830019584 2017-08-15 01:54:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is no alt left. @realDonaldTrump has shown us who he truly is. He is the evil of the world and is a #Nazi himself.
897636948214505473 2017-08-15 01:51:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump @RepTimWalz Donald trump is evil himself
897546466318831618 2017-08-15 19:52:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CNN Its just a participation trophy big deal.
897502087302467584 2017-08-15 16:55:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> I've seen more outrage on social media over @Kaepernick7 protesting injustice and #ConfederateStatues coming down than #Charlottesville
897478855153332224 2017-08-15 15:23:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> And I'm missing her like crazy. Pray she gets a phone soonhttps://twitter.com/FreakyTheory/status/897363487982309377

897357510931349504 2017-08-15 07:21:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> #ConfederateStatues are nothing more than participation trophies. You lost get over it loserspic.twitter.com/FyDU6C2cB1
897348911123312640 2017-08-14 06:47:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just saying that @realDonaldTrump will go on Twitter and attack whoever he is displeased with unless you're a #Nazi #WhiteSupremacists
897347155828105217 2017-08-14 06:40:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> You know she is amazing when you miss her like crazy. Hope she gets a phone soon. Can't stand this   #longdistancerelationshippic.twitter.com/Bqh6BrNgMF

897343886162624512 2017-08-14 06:27:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> How does one catch the sniffles and a sore throat in the #summer
897317559053189121 2017-08-14 04:42:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> #SummerSlam93 when @JerryLawler try to fake a injury so he didn't have to face @BretHart it didn't work out so well
897313187481210881 2017-08-14 04:25:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> A hard choice for September. Should I go see @garthbrooks in #siouxfalls or @MidwestAllPro it's a hard choice. Can't afford both though
897312781053067265 2017-08-14 04:23:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> Remember when @HillaryClinton labeled trump supporters as deplorable guess she was right wasn't she.
897312404060725248 2017-08-14 04:22:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> When @WWE has more mentions of #SummerSlam than actual matchespic.twitter.com/jjjjoXa6il
897301195152379904 2017-08-14 03:37:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> We seen some true American hero's today take down a racist traitor statue in #Durham. Good job guys. Take the symbol of hate down
897298317163495424 2017-08-14 03:26:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well @TrentShelton does it again. There is no reason it can't be me. Having odds against me is a good thing. I can become a #Legend too
897262626501255170 2017-08-14 01:04:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BigCassWWE cutting a promo on #RAW is putting me to sleep
897259733501050880 2017-08-14 00:52:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWE If @IAmEliasWWE wants tips on giving a concert on @wwe #RAW go get some advice from the @TheRock
897252008675213314 2017-08-14 00:22:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheSwonBrothers I went to one of the concerts and it was my first. Best one I been to so far and I had to buy your album
897243565448941568 2017-08-14 23:48:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> The fact is that @realDonaldTrump created this hate and bigotry. He refused to condemn these same people on the campaign trail.
897137907345051648 2017-08-14 16:48:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> Prayers and #GoodVibes to @RicFlairNatrBoy hoping things turn out ok
897128469670371328 2017-08-14 16:11:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Been with her for one month. Time goes by fast. It's harder being in a #longdistancerelationship when she has no phone but I'm thankful
897127943327141888 2017-08-14 16:09:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> The reason @realDonaldTrump won't speak out against #WhiteSupremacists because he is one
897126210341359616 2017-08-14 16:02:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @realDonaldTrump is quick to rip #Merck CEO but won't condemn white supremacist
897108767812333568 2017-08-14 14:52:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you realize it's #mondaypic.twitter.com/Hb6yTiE12R

896971265340305408 2017-08-13 05:46:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> I stand with #marshawnlynch for standing up for the right thing like @Kaepernick7 did
896970999022878720 2017-08-13 05:45:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is more outrage over #marshawnlynch sitting down sticking up for the right thing than the Nazi attack in #Charolettesville
896970097704804352 2017-08-13 05:41:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> #PositiveVibes to @RicFlairNatrBoy get well soon man
896964770288603136 2017-08-13 05:20:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump showed more outrage over a @nbcsnl skit than he did the #Nazi terrorist attack in #Charolettesville. That says alot
896957599035396096 2017-08-13 04:52:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> I know #MyWorth #ilovemyself I'm more #positive my #Faith is stronger I'm #Thankful and #grateful. 10 years ago I couldn't say this
896929165118763008 2017-08-13 02:59:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> Another great #ChesapeakeShores on @hallmarkchannel tonight. Great show and great movies year round.
896928349829947392 2017-08-13 02:55:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> Next week the #NinetiesCNN covers #countrymusic yes that's when I first start listening. Favorite was @garthbrooks and @billyraycyrus too
896927963530223619 2017-08-13 02:54:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @realDonaldTrump won't speak out against #WhiteSupremacists #naziscum because he is one of them and that's his base
896885526392950784 2017-08-13 00:05:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> @StephenAtHome as #captainamerica be sure to #punchanazipic.twitter.com/xW9pOV6eQW

896875836648951808 2017-08-13 23:27:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> @hallmarkchannel Yay I'm glad I'm not the only one
896855600428134405 2017-08-13 22:06:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> Its hard being in a #longdistancerelationship especially when she has no phone but I'm true and #loyal to her. She chose me & I'm thankful
896851687847145473 2017-08-13 21:51:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> @NBCNews Call it what it is and that's a Nazi rally very similar to a trump rally though
896849443349307393 2017-08-13 21:42:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WCWWorldwide How can I get that poster
896849229024514048 2017-08-13 21:41:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> I wore my world series @Cubs shirt to church today and someone told me I needed a nicer shirt. It doesn't get any nicer than the #Cubs
896845872784433152 2017-08-13 21:28:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @realDonaldTrump is really sincere about condemning the Nazi attack in #Charlottesville then he would #FireBannon and call them by name
896790055859011585 2017-08-13 17:46:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> You know #nazis are pathetic when they carry around tiki torches from Gilligan's island   #Charolettesville
896775007669563395 2017-08-13 16:46:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> In little over a month it's gonna be fall. Cool crisp nights, jeans, wearing my @LugzNYC and @Broncos football and #Halloweenpic.twitter.com/KKGF8kOzNe

896617588326883332 2017-08-12 06:21:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> I miss having a man of dignity, honor and class as #POTUS @BarackObama. A man I admire and someone who inspired me

896582577489883136 2017-08-12 04:01:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> No doubt @SummerSlam 92 is still the greatest summerslam of all time. @BretHart vs #daveyboysmith was a instant classic
896582250501775361 2017-08-12 04:00:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> When I hear about #NorthKorea missles possibly hitting #Chicago my girlfriend lives there.  That is scary and makes me even worry more

896536721361223681 2017-08-12 00:59:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just a sad and horrific day today in this country. That's all I can say. You can't be both American and a Nazi.   #Charlottesville

896510375121879040 2017-08-12 23:15:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @realDonaldTrump is sincere about condemning the attacks in #Charlottesville then he will fire the neo Nazi #SteveBannon from his staff
896509447761256448 2017-08-12 23:11:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> So there was all this outrage when @Kaepernick7 took a kneel to pretest social injustice but the same people are silent on #Charlottesville
896453216333959168 2017-08-12 19:27:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a sad day in America. I'm disgusted and lost of words   #Resistance #Charlottesville #ThisIsnotwhoweare

896413644791140353 2017-08-12 16:50:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is no place for Nazis in America. I stand against hate and bigotry. I will speak out against them.   #Charlottesville

896203529622302720 2017-08-11 02:55:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> And of course one of my favorite matches of all time they took place at @SummerSlam 91 was @BretHart vs #mrperfect for #ICTitle
896203052834836480 2017-08-11 02:53:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> Gonna watch my favorite @SummerSlam 1991 featuring @HulkHogan and @UltimateWarrior vs @_SgtSlaughter @the_ironsheik @GeneralAdnanWWE
896184498882301952 2017-08-11 01:40:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> As far as I'm concerned @TheRock making changes to his #BrahmaBull tattoo is cool. At some point we all evolve.

896058854546448384 2017-08-11 17:20:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> I still remember when @nickgreen20 hit a walk off homer for a @Braves win 9 years go. Game was on @TBSNetwork and @kapaya1234 calling it
896050616128028672 2017-08-11 16:48:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy birthday to @HulkHogan one of my first favorite wrestlers when i first starting watching wrestling as a infant.pic.twitter.com/ftIz8kECZT
895898576685080576 2017-08-10 06:44:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> If aliens came and ask me to take them to my leader i would tell them to take #Trump and take Kelly Ann con job too
895897640499589120 2017-08-10 06:40:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Here is a thought some people need to their promises they make to others instead of letting people down and disappointing them
895894859604787202 2017-08-10 06:29:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> I've improved so much from where I was a year ago. I'm more #positive and my #Faith is stronger. Big thanks to @TrentShelton for his videos

895893489480851456 2017-08-10 06:23:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Its funny how a ex of mine goes from man to man to man looking for love in all the wrong places. Maybe she should try #love_yourself

895858387736571904 2017-08-10 04:04:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think the @BroncosCheer should get a reality show. I'll watch anything @Broncos

895165423146217472 2017-08-08 06:10:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> The best part of this summer was I not only #FoundMyself but also learned what it was to #LoveMyself then someone found me. Thanks to #god
895164164716593152 2017-08-08 06:05:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> No wonder there isn't mangers anymore in #prowrestling no one wants to get their manager's license
895163889322733569 2017-08-08 06:04:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm such a big #introvert but I can be social at certain times. Just don't force me to be social

895141100071133184 2017-08-08 04:34:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> The people who continue to support the #FakePresident just shows what kind of humans they are and how stupid they are
895140224375902208 2017-08-08 04:30:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's gonna hit people hard when the people they put off spending time with won't be here someday. You have time if you make time
895138648517115904 2017-08-08 04:24:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you see your ex is dating a 47 year old man. About twice your age  and controlling. I feel bad for her 
895137936932564992 2017-08-08 04:21:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @JohnCena is a good seller now I want to try those @Tapout body sprays
895131632155467777 2017-08-08 03:56:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> I was never the biggest supporter of @HillaryClinton but we wouldn't be where we are if she was President
895130970327842816 2017-08-08 03:53:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> 75 percent of Americans don't believe what trump says the other 25 percent attended #trumpuniversity or are #stupididiots
895130153420021760 2017-08-08 03:50:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> When will people realize that the people you keep putting off to spend time with won't be here forever. One day there won't be no more time
895123743193927680 2017-08-08 03:25:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> When people tell you it's just a game. Um I waited my whole life for the @Cubs to win the world series. It's life and I can die in peace
895101567090790400 2017-08-08 01:56:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well @HillaryClinton warned you all and look what we got now. Two world leaders who act like toddlers in charge of nuclear weapons

894323390827438080 2017-08-06 22:24:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> I must say I'll take @WWE at its worse over b.s. like a dick flip. Wrestling sure has gotten stupid.
894322927247790080 2017-08-06 22:22:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> So the dolphins say a terrible leader in Jay Cutler instead of @Kaepernick7. Colin is the best option out there but go sign a tv analyst
894314063697768448 2017-08-06 21:47:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> One thing about being in a #longdistancerelationship is in the end you know she will be worth the wait

894082205470928898 2017-08-05 06:26:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @SHSanders45 you're giving the writers of @nbcsnl all the ideas they need for next season.
894058288505073665 2017-08-05 04:51:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> There will come a day when there won't be time to spend with people in your life. So do it now or you will regret the time you missed
894056185695023104 2017-08-05 04:43:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ericbolling quit sending out dick pics you perv. Ladies don't like that. Good ole Christian conservative values from faux news I see

893940815059443714 2017-08-05 21:04:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> #longdistancerelationship is hard but I must be strong. Thinking of her everyday. She has no phone or Wi-Fi. In the end it will be worth it
893889555258126338 2017-08-05 17:40:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @kstc45 @proawf Injustice. Benjamin stacks should be in a cage hanging above the ring next time that way he can't interfere
893889299086749696 2017-08-05 17:39:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today on @proawf #Therainmaker Randy raynes was screwed out of the Midwest heritage title. Rematch with Benjamin stacks banned from ringside
893717618498183168 2017-08-04 06:17:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> @willcain What's  so offending. It's more important to worship a piece of cloth than stand up for innocent civilians getting killed by police
893716892854214657 2017-08-04 06:14:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> Learning to appreciate more and be more thankful. Keeping my #faith in God. The best is yet to come.

893515968600838144 2017-08-04 16:56:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> A piece of cloth should not be more important than people's lives. I support @Kaepernick7
893497510777544705 2017-08-04 15:43:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Also a happy birthday to @keithellison. Someone who has always stood for the right things and fights everyday.

892228700690944000 2017-07-31 03:41:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> On second thought @WWEBrayWyatt could be Santa Claus if you think about it
892209544700604417 2017-07-31 02:25:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe @IAmSamsonWWE should take some lessons on musical performances from the @OfficialHTM or even the rock God himself @rockinrickyg
892207579060994049 2017-07-31 02:17:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Kaepernick7 has never did nothing wrong or commited a crime. He has silently protested a major issue going on which is police brutality
892201302884798465 2017-07-31 01:52:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you're in search of a temporary job i hear the @WhiteHouse is hiring
892200808271548416 2017-07-31 01:50:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @WWEBrayWyatt says he is everywhere then he must be God right  #RAW
892185896841347072 2017-07-31 00:51:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow who knew the #WhiteHouse had a really fast revolving door. The rats are jumping ship faster than people were jumping of the titanic

890831956417662978 2017-07-28 07:11:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #Republicans are such a joke they can't even pass their own terrible Bill  #SkinnyRepeal

890786422772219904 2017-07-27 04:10:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #SkinnyRepeal is cruel and stupid to do. Tosses 16 million Americans off insurance. The #Republicans are not pro life
890753039690326016 2017-07-27 01:57:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> It doesnt matter if I'm #single or in a #relationship the fact is I'll be fine and I'll be happy with the life I'm given
890752457818689536 2017-07-27 01:55:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> New business coming to this small rural town is a good thing. I don't get why people complain unless they like this town being a stink hole
890461298646974464 2017-07-26 06:38:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> Ever since that love yourself Facebook live from @TrentShelton I have a new perspective on life. Proud to own and love my life

890457093496602624 2017-07-26 06:21:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RRWWE No doubt the best smackdown theme
890456655837712384 2017-07-26 06:19:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RRWWE But I'm a huge fan of the union underground. I do agree that is the best and my favorite theme
890455577402519556 2017-07-26 06:15:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RRWWE @paparoach was pretty good too
890454746280185856 2017-07-26 06:12:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump You worship Russia and Putin
890425683637391360 2017-07-26 04:16:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> @LenKasper has become my second favorite baseball announcer. Sorry @kapaya1234 is still my favorite
890425287032414209 2017-07-26 04:15:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching another classic coliseum video hosted by @SeanMooneyWho. I for one loved the team of Sean and Lord Alfred Hayes

890396562643456001 2017-07-26 02:20:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow @LenKasper mentioned lance Johnson. I haven't heard that name since I was a kid @Cubs
890396306073686017 2017-07-26 02:19:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> It shouldn't matter what your sexual orientation is. If you want to serve and can do the task you should be able to.  #transpeoplematter
890388008310112256 2017-07-26 01:46:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Best wishes to @RichardsWesley disappointed he is leaving @GFWWrestling but respect his reasons why. One of my favorites to watch
890038315730309120 2017-07-25 02:37:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> After listening to some of the shoots of @bruceprichard I will admit he does some funny impressions of @TheJimCornette @VinceMcMahon
890036882494697474 2017-07-25 02:31:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> #TedKennedy fought his whole career for healthcare and today @SenJohnMcCain voted to take it away. What a disgrace. He is no hero
889925215010029569 2017-07-25 19:07:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> #paulwellstone once said politics is about improving people's lives so how are the terrible policies of the #Gop doing that.
889723903010058240 2017-07-24 05:48:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @CharlyCarusoWWE you did a ok job with a live Mic tonight. Some internet fans of jabronis
889716081392275457 2017-07-24 05:16:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> If these scum bag republicans are so pro life and Christian then why are they against #UniversalHealthCare maybe because they are greedy
889714504682139648 2017-07-24 05:10:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @WWE cruiserweight division found out what @OfficialSDW and @proawf wrestlers knew for a long time about @AriyaDaivariWWE

889701594903826433 2017-07-24 04:19:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> @drose and @KingJames have been my two favorite players for the longest time. Never thought I see them on the same team. So excited @cavs
889700945386504192 2017-07-24 04:16:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Even if we are together but far apart I'm happy I have this person in my life.   #longdistancerelationship
889700305688047616 2017-07-24 04:14:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> Watching a classic coliseum video and @SeanMooneyWho is the host. I always loved the team of Sean and Lord Alfred Hayes

888270900411342848 2017-07-20 05:34:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> A man has to go his own way. I hope people will understand that about me. I'm not gonna be who you want me to be.
887865074987266050 2017-07-19 02:41:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Go win this fight @SenJohnMcCain never give up
887864813749243904 2017-07-19 02:40:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Missing her 
887544609529876480 2017-07-18 05:28:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> I have no intentions on getting caught up or being part of some people's drama.  #dramafree
887179302671982594 2017-07-17 05:16:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> So is @HEELZiggler the son of @ShawnMichaels or @RealBillyGunn
887178564801581056 2017-07-17 05:13:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> So if @JasonJordanJJ is the son of @RealKurtAngle then does that mean @WWEGable is the son of @JannettyHOF
887178098621509632 2017-07-17 05:11:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> #MadeInAmericaWeek lmao the orange turd's 3 wives aren't even made in America

886743024105136128 2017-07-16 00:23:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> The one man in wrestling that makes sense to me is @TheJimCornette the man knows what he is talking about either you like it or not
886724851821576192 2017-07-16 23:10:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> @USGA @realDonaldTrump Who gives a flying f**I about golf. How bout try doing something good and positive for the country. All of us just not the top 2 percent
886724487529607168 2017-07-16 23:09:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's tough when you're girl hasn't messaged you in a couple days and you're living apart. I know she is ok but I care.  #relationships
886662688813789184 2017-07-16 19:03:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> Great @Cubs debut for @jose_quintana24 keep up the good work   #Cubs
886643711190368256 2017-07-16 17:48:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'll never understand why people depend on someone else to love them and for their happiness when they should be loving themselves first
886471065228259330 2017-07-15 06:22:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just like that she came in my life. Being friends for the past year now we're a couple. This is the craziest thing to ever happen to me

886109707185926145 2017-07-14 06:26:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's true that #Trump has done more than @BarackObama I mean he has tweeted and played golf more plus made this country a laughing stock
886108988286406656 2017-07-14 06:23:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> This week's episode of @GFWWrestling @IMPACTWRESTLING was good..ever since @RealJeffJarrett has returned to power I'm interested again
886108208166776832 2017-07-14 06:20:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> @therealec3 #AlternativeFacts
886099519347335168 2017-07-14 05:46:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> So I finally embrace being #single and start loving myself then she just popped into my life. Never thought this would happen
885487878347911168 2017-07-13 13:15:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm so excited for this new and unexpected chapter to begin in my life. Ladies I'm taken. Goodbye to the #singlelife.
885011117201862657 2017-07-11 05:41:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> So about those emails #TrumpJr

883476571004293124 2017-07-07 00:03:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's 7 pm and bell time. As cowboy Bill watts used to say let's hook em up @MidwestAllPro
883457216522702848 2017-07-07 22:46:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> Had the honor of meeting @EBischoff and @REALLiSAMARiE today. I'll remember this the rest of my life

882631903769243648 2017-07-05 16:06:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's already on my 10 year Goals to get outta this town and leave it behind. I'm changing and evolving. Im outgrowing this town
882408472184320000 2017-07-04 01:19:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> Dude @Wale had a nwo wolfpac shirt on @RealKevinNash @Sting
882407800139337729 2017-07-04 01:16:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> @JohnCena should of came out to save that rap off between @WWEUsos and @TrueKofi and new day. That battle was terrible
881694231596859392 2017-07-02 02:01:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow they are engaged @hallmarkchannel @BaileeMadison @reallycb #Goodies   I never seen it coming
881604132540493824 2017-07-02 20:02:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> @IMPACTWRESTLING and @GFWWrestling coming together as one and being rebranded as  is a good move. Best wishes @RealJeffJarrett @fightnet
881603524051820545 2017-07-02 20:00:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> Let's remember that @BarackObama was the last adult #POTUS
881602777880940545 2017-07-02 19:57:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe instead of sending out childish tweets #theorangeturd  should start acting presidential and stop acting like a overgrown 2 year old
881044060336607232 2017-06-30 06:57:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Folty25 #bravescountry is proud of you man. @Braves
881043704076681217 2017-06-30 06:56:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> That love yourself Facebook live from @TrentShelton gave me a whole new perspective on life   #
881043313280729089 2017-06-30 06:54:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Yg_Trece to @okcthunder I love it and joining @russwest44 #ThunderUp
881042953241673728 2017-06-30 06:53:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #RepublicanHealthCarePlan isn't where millions of Americans lose their coverage but are kicked off insurance so the rich get a tax cut
880455433294630912 2017-06-29 15:58:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> At least @CarmellaWWE won money in the bank fairly this time. @realellsworth getting it for you doesn't count
880454823979646980 2017-06-29 15:56:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Funny how #MELANIATRUMP has a anti bullying campaign yet she married one and justifies when he bullies others
880454632966901760 2017-06-29 15:55:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> I love myself. I love Being #singlelife. Having freedom and not answering to anyone. Embracing it and loving it
880310667873529856 2017-06-28 06:23:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MollyQerim when you gonna be back on @FirstTake @stephenasmith and @maxkellerman are a little lost With out you

879957983928758272 2017-06-28 07:01:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Trumpcare is like #trumpuniversity except you die
879948487147876352 2017-06-27 06:24:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> @SenKamalaHarris has in a short time become my favorite senator along with @BernieSanders and @SenFranken of course
879948211988856832 2017-06-27 06:22:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thanks for that inspiring Facebook live @TrentShelton I'm  starting to love myself and own my life. I needed to hear this 10 years ago
879759264029569024 2017-06-27 17:52:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Republican healthcare plan is one big tax cut for the rich and millions of Americans lose covrage. How pro life and Christian
879391589193449472 2017-06-26 17:31:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WCCO @Matt_Brickman How bout some snow 
879361695503855617 2017-06-26 15:32:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> I loved part 1 of the season 3 #GoodWitch finale @hallmarkchannel @reallycb @BaileeMadison
879360859126071296 2017-06-26 15:29:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Dear #SupremeCourt I'm more in fear of white right wing terrorist than I am Muslims
878736070044778497 2017-06-24 22:06:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Seriously this cashier was not paying attention to what he was doing
878660174843654144 2017-06-24 17:04:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> Yes I still sell #itworks and now greens come in chocolate  get yours today. Pm me or just go right to my site which is on my Twitterpic.twitter.com/APrHQLwKYy
878494510757670912 2017-06-23 06:06:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> Congrats to the #americannightmare @CodyRhodes on reaching the top of the mountain and becoming the @ringofhonor world heavyweight champion
877742629353607168 2017-06-21 04:18:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> How bout the @nyknicks keep @carmeloanthony and @kporzee and fire @PhilJackson11. As a knick fan i had enough
877713418861645827 2017-06-21 02:22:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> So all these years the big bad new Yorker with a black baseball bat #vincerusso was all a act. He really is a coward  @TheJimCornette
877243504417812480 2017-06-20 19:15:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Tickets ordered for the @MidwestAllPro show in #siouxfalls July 7th. Can't wait to meet @RealKevinNash @EBischoff and @REALLiSAMARiE
876655770867314688 2017-06-18 04:19:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @hallmarkchannel @BaileeMadison @reallycb #goodwitch has become one of my favorite shows
876288878398898176 2017-06-17 04:02:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Omg #PeteAndPete is on the @NickSplat I haven't seen that since I was 9 years old
875945311352573952 2017-06-16 05:16:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Sadly there is no justice for black folks in this country. This is why @Kaepernick7 kneeled. Shameful verdict   #PhilandoCastile
875944836226052096 2017-06-16 05:14:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am finding out more and more everyday why @Kaepernick7 took a stand for injustice. Today's verdict is shameful   #PhilandoCastile
875930355596918784 2017-06-16 04:17:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> Another day and another injustice in America. Shameful. It's not right that some cops get away with murder   #justiceforphilando
875895720838037505 2017-06-16 01:59:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hoping to get VIP tickets for @MidwestAllPro this Monday for the July 7th show in Sioux falls. Hoping to meet @RealKevinNash and @EBischoff
875569455534821376 2017-06-15 04:23:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> And she continues to #Persist @KamalaHarris
875385281322659841 2017-06-15 16:11:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> So why Twitter looking different 
875349716049022977 2017-06-15 13:50:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> Part of the #Resist movement is to take the Republicans out of office and power. There is no room for violence so some people just stop it
875349297470091265 2017-06-15 13:48:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> it's the Republican party that is the party of hate speech. Sadly their political rhetoric came to bite them in the ass in a sad way
875348664285364224 2017-06-15 13:45:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> What @KingJames is doing off the court sending kids to college and building a school is far bigger than a NBA title. He is making a impact
875347955930345472 2017-06-15 13:43:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> Comparing white supremacist #JeffSessions to the keebler elf is just plain wrong. The elf makes cookie and brings joy
875347356400660481 2017-06-15 13:40:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Only if I could meet the most amazing woman ever, get married and live happily ever after then again real life isn't a fairy tale or is it
875346086386434048 2017-06-15 13:35:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> The best is yet to come for me. Make do with what I have now while striving for what I want. I'm gonna be one of those late bloomers
874833750412210176 2017-06-13 03:39:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> @KamalaHarris and @TulsiGabbard would make a great presidential ticket. I'm with them @TheDemocrats @dccc
874505344738897921 2017-06-12 05:54:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> To all those who are celebrating the failures of @KingJames I hope karma bites you in the ass and how many titles have you won
874482500353093632 2017-06-12 04:24:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> @KingJames and the @cavs fought their hearts out but the odds were stacked too thigh against them.  Cavs fan for life   #DefendTheLand
874302319868903424 2017-06-12 16:28:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wondering who I should support as the @MinnesotaDFL candidate for governor. I'm leaning towards either @Rebecca_Otto or @epmurphymn
873909339064590336 2017-06-11 14:26:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Live your life and own your life   Straight up   #PositiveLiving
873627699608248320 2017-06-10 19:47:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a sad day when #Batman dies and the #joker is in the white house
873406095154393088 2017-06-09 05:06:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> @LanceStorm That's crazy ole #terryfunk
873392643216199680 2017-06-09 04:13:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Warriorfans be like  #DefendTheLand
873388768123867137 2017-06-09 03:58:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> I told y'all it wasn't gonna be over tonight   #DefendTheLand #Believeland
873193334206078977 2017-06-09 15:01:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> When I see how things are in #thirdWorldCountries like the #Philippines I realize how good I really have it
873035663687376897 2017-06-08 04:34:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @PWTorch @pwpodcasts A pathological liar denies everything
873010908066455553 2017-06-08 02:56:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @KamalaHarris ever wants to run for #POTUS #ImWithHer
873010708589547521 2017-06-08 02:55:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette you referred Vince Russo as mentally ill ironic how he supports the mentally ill President
872836128205938688 2017-06-08 15:22:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MollyQerim @willcain @FirstTake If @KDTrey5 is the best in the world then why did he need the warrior to get a title. He needs them they don't need him
872666204737069056 2017-06-07 04:06:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hey @KDTrey5 if you can't beat them then join them 
872650832243765248 2017-06-07 03:05:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @KyrieIrving just won't cool off. This boy is on fire  #DefendTheLand
872646612513951744 2017-06-07 02:49:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> Whoa @KyrieIrving is on fire  #DefendTheLand
871771183087276032 2017-06-05 16:50:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> Y'all hating on @KingJames couldn't even make your kids 2nd grade team at their school  and you couldn't even win the spelling bee
871576915676725249 2017-06-04 03:58:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Still haven't lost faith in the @cavs. Overcome again guys. Keep fighting   #Cavaliers
870854867220344832 2017-06-02 04:09:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well @kathygriffin had a bad joke about the Orange turd but it didn't hurt anyone unlike the policies of the Orange turd and the republicans
870469474411053056 2017-06-01 02:37:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Everyone doubted the @cavs last year and doing it this year again. Don't doubt this team or the boys on it @KingJames @KyrieIrving
870321622166667264 2017-06-01 16:50:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Conservatives are hypocrites on the @kathygriffin issue when they were the ones not showing outrage over images of Obama hanging from a rope
869767841008017408 2017-05-30 04:09:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> These budget bills are disgraceful thanks to the #MNGOP #mnleg
869615275498512384 2017-05-30 18:03:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy to have @UPtv again. One of my all time favorite shows 7th heaven is on @JessicaBiel @beverleymitchel
869592440570773504 2017-05-30 16:32:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> #achybreakyheart25 came out 25 years ago. That was my favorite song when I was 4 and made me a @billyraycyrus fan
869591837765505025 2017-05-30 16:30:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FirstTake for someone to come on national tv and say @tonyromo is a all time great they are either outta their mind or on the weed
869455461015326720 2017-05-30 07:28:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> This is getting so annoying. Maybe this was not the right choice for me
869079328843345924 2017-05-28 06:33:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> Good episode of the #goodwitch tonight @hallmarkchannel @reallycb @BaileeMadison #goodie
868835148292399105 2017-05-28 14:23:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> Even #Russia goes to #jared
868540121611722752 2017-05-27 18:51:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> Rather than be searching for that special someone I should be more focused on my life and myself. There's a bigger picture   #single

867970262829944833 2017-05-25 05:06:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> Way to go Montana you're a stupid idiot for voting a no good asshole fraud #republican in. Good way to screw yourselves over
867944866805764097 2017-05-25 03:25:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @cavs are headed back to the #nba finals for the third straight year and @KingJames looking for his fourth ring.   #CavsNation
867404993044852736 2017-05-24 15:40:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> #supportHannity go drink some bleach and then eat shit
867243996355153920 2017-05-23 05:00:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am thankful I have senators like @SenFranken and @amyklobuchar who will oppose the #trumpbudget
867243797306101760 2017-05-23 05:00:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> #trumpbudget is very immoral and disgusting. Low income families, seniors, the disabled, and kids get effected. Sickening   #resist
866867333448564736 2017-05-22 04:04:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> Finish Boston @cavs then best the warriors for the second straight year in the finals @KingJames @KyrieIrving @kevinlove #DefendtheLand
866866626951512064 2017-05-22 04:01:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Let's be honest @IAmSamsonWWE doesn't have a thing on the #RockGod @rockinrickyg @TheWCWC
866526095834796032 2017-05-21 05:28:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> So @JinderMahal being @WWE champion is suppose to excite me and make me buy a ticket. Yeah ok meh
866463711145463809 2017-05-21 01:20:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realellsworth is not even in the same league as @TheRealVirgil
866461218298617857 2017-05-21 01:10:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> The model #RickMartel could teach @TylerBreeze_ and @WWEFandango about fashion   #oldschool

865740964287086594 2017-05-19 01:28:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow @KingJames and the @cavs are wiping the court with the #Celtics and its only the second quarter   #Cavaliers #nbaplayoffs
865736071140847616 2017-05-19 01:08:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> The #Republicans and the #orangeTurd are wanting to ruin the internet and take away your healthcare but but but @HillaryClinton emails

863245240492281856 2017-05-12 04:11:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> It would be nice if rural Minnesota had more public transportation options to surrounding towns. Day or night

861407600730140672 2017-05-07 02:29:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> Lately I been questioning if I'm better off living in a bigger town or city rather than a rural area. I'm outgrowing this place
861407216036958210 2017-05-07 02:27:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> Found the first episode of Smokey mountain wrestling on YouTube. Some damn good wrestling @TheJimCornette @dirtydutchman1

861313395953455104 2017-05-07 20:14:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> Starting to realize I'm outgrowing #ruralMinnesota. Knowing there is just nothing here for me and no purpose. I'm meant for bigger things
861312941458694144 2017-05-07 20:13:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Congrats #France you're not a bunch of stupid idiots like America is
861294467999039490 2017-05-07 18:59:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Not making anymore plans with anyone for the remainder of 2017. That way no one can disappoint me
861261603454554113 2017-05-07 16:49:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Hoping for positive vibes and good news for the remainder of 2017. So far it's been a awful year. Bad news always finds me
861071086636716032 2017-05-06 04:11:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> Young and hopeless
861070827130933248 2017-05-06 04:10:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> There is no silver lining for me and never will be. I want this year to be over and reboot myself
861064242161754113 2017-05-06 03:44:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @UltimateWarrior Chased you out of @TheGarden
861049306433900544 2017-05-06 02:45:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Being a #Republican and a orange turd with fake hair should be a #preexistingconditon
861042938880643072 2017-05-06 02:20:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> I live in a place where people think hunting is a sport. The only way hunting would be a sport is if the animal were armed. Fair game
861042620071649280 2017-05-06 02:18:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> This town isn't really home to me its a comfort zone and it does me no good to just keep staying and settling
861041919996170241 2017-05-06 02:16:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> Heading out east to Massachusetts would is a goal of mine

861041168297189377 2017-05-06 02:13:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> I will never understand why people vote for #Republicans when all they do is screw the country over unless your rich of course
861040853896376321 2017-05-06 02:11:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> I just hope and pray that something good happens this coming week. 2017 has been a terrible year full of disappointment   #hopefully
860983963061542912 2017-05-06 22:25:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> Can 2017 be done with. I'm fed up with all these disappointments and setbacks. Had a great 2016 and 2017 is just so terrible

859818433365540864 2017-05-03 17:14:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheJimCornette having #DonaldTrump as your President and mike pence  is liking having @TNADixie and Vince Russo run your wrestling company
859618264099549186 2017-05-02 03:58:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> @NWAwrestling Best wishes to the @NWAWrestling and their new owner #billyGorgan.   It's still stands for #tradition #honor #respect

859244405550710785 2017-05-01 03:13:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Anybody headed to the wrestling show in granite falls this Saturday from the Tracy mn area pm me. Looking for someone to ride with  #helppic.twitter.com/vJaHL5M6hd
859109327394689024 2017-05-01 18:16:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> No wonder trump supporters &Vince Russo  love #Trump he is stupid &racist like they are. Jackson was dead for 16 years before the civil war
859078162193494016 2017-05-01 16:12:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> The civil war was about slavery #DonaldTrump is a f'n moron
858930922015649792 2017-04-30 06:27:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Bucks @DashWilderWWE The @MattJackson13 bucks @NickJacksonYB @bucks disagree
858876851892170757 2017-04-30 02:52:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> #HouseOfHorrorsMatch maybe the worst match I ever see in my life. Even worse than the king of the road match from wcw
858734095802748928 2017-04-30 17:25:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Really wish I had someone to hang out with around here
858543069209165825 2017-04-29 04:46:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to get out of rural America in the next 5 years. Life wasn't meant to be lived in one place
858542404953133056 2017-04-29 04:43:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ringofhonor is the best f'n pro wrestling on all week long along with @TheWCWC @CWFHollywood. I guess that isn't a popular thing to say
858541756828319744 2017-04-29 04:41:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> What has the Orange turd accomplished in 100 days well does giving #Putin a blow job count  #Trumprussia
858506191990927360 2017-04-29 02:20:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Plans for next Saturday May not be ugh 
858107468974632961 2017-04-28 23:55:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> When it comes to pro wrestling @TheJimCornette is the only person who makes any sense. On top of that he can't stand republicans like I do
858036647786688513 2017-04-28 19:14:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> The most the orange turd has accomplished in 100 days is screw this nation over and eat a piece of chocolate cake 
857826255068168192 2017-04-27 05:18:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you are liking @IMPACTWRESTLING again and someone ruins it with negativitypic.twitter.com/SmAoaxf5qP
857812426376577025 2017-04-27 04:23:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Time to delete the #negativity from my life and social media accounts
857810733572214784 2017-04-27 04:16:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> It doesnt matter what wrestling promotion you speak about there is always some  negative Nancy that will turn your post into negativity
857810439501164544 2017-04-27 04:15:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> Awesome to see @TheJaxDane on @IMPACTWRESTLING. Loving the reboot and the new faces plus  @RealJeffJarrett and @dirtydutchman1 being back
857406384387891201 2017-04-26 01:29:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> Trump's tax plan is just one tax cut for himself and his rich cronies. He and the gop only care about themselves and their donors
857263103666511874 2017-04-26 16:00:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realellsworth is a real tough strong man standing behind all those women like that @CarmellaWWE @NatbyNature
856761128344539136 2017-04-24 06:45:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> #RAW was once again dreadful.

855525041504747521 2017-04-21 20:53:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> The hardest part is going to be letting her go 
855289750910976000 2017-04-20 05:19:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Feeling like my life is at a crossroads 
855282327399702531 2017-04-20 04:49:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> No doubt the orange turd found the most stupidest racist morons he could find to come to dinner today in Ted "I shit my pants Nugent
855090527301230593 2017-04-20 16:07:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Nothing like being drug free/StraightEdge on 4/20. The #StraightEdge drug free life style is the best in the world

853358380911669248 2017-04-15 21:24:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's amazing how little you can spend for so much at a dollar store. Love saving that moolah

852563210892980224 2017-04-13 16:44:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> I said since before election night that the orange turd would do nothing but bad and that what he has done. He is no Christian

852019492867645441 2017-04-11 04:44:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> You need to look at yourself in a positive way. Love yourself. Love your life. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks or says
851995861710233603 2017-04-11 03:10:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> I sure miss @mauroranallo on Tuesday night's #Smackdown. He is one of the best announcers in all of sports today

850589906334306304 2017-04-07 06:03:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> @hallmarkchannel My favorite Christmas movie
850585239260889088 2017-04-07 05:44:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> We will not achieve world peace if we bomb the world to pieces 
850461401432936448 2017-04-07 21:32:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> A beautiful day got my @Jumpman23 sandles on. Thank God for second chances and new beginnings.
850426718536040450 2017-04-07 19:15:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am thankful for second chances and a new start. I am excited to get back to a job I liked. Just a few more weeks
850201843904897028 2017-04-06 04:21:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> If you're in favor of bombing Syria because of the chemical attack but against refugees coming you're a fucking hypocrite. Excuse my French
850201111239704576 2017-04-06 04:18:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> The orange turd can find millions of dollars for war in Syria but not for education, healthcare, meals on wheels. Enjoy your poison
850056686958243840 2017-04-06 18:44:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> Really wish I could help her but I can't 
849867458118922240 2017-04-05 06:12:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> So much for giving that orange turd a chance. He signs a bill selling your browser history to the highest bidder. I told you he was bad
849866800242327552 2017-04-05 06:10:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's very sad how one particular business owner doesn't want new business coming to town.
849866329742036992 2017-04-05 06:08:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> I'm one fan who hopes to see @Goldberg back soon. Been a fan since I was 9 years old
849865296856965120 2017-04-05 06:04:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well the orange turd defends #billOReilly I guess sexual predators stick together
849865054468145153 2017-04-05 06:03:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> Can't wait for the next few weeks to fly by. New job. Got put in a tough situation and I turned it around. Thank God for second chances
849864530494722048 2017-04-05 06:01:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's gonna be a turn around year for the @Braves
849864062997598208 2017-04-05 05:59:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> So how is the orange turd working out for ya   #Trumprussia

849692695606042625 2017-04-05 18:38:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Day off means I can watch the @Braves game today thanks to MLB extra innings.
849691282981228544 2017-04-05 18:32:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> A 34 percent approval rating in 3 months oh don't forget the bill 45 signed to sell your browsing history but lets give him a chance 
849467335614373890 2017-04-04 03:42:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Wrestlemania week concludes until 2018. I can't wait. No one knew that the greatest @WWE star in history the undertaker would retire

847348079095201794 2017-03-30 07:21:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> When you realize you don't belong in certain places you just can tell and your basic instinct just knows
847346008073805828 2017-03-30 07:13:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> The Minnesota Republican party favors tax cuts for the rich over our environment. Outrageous. Yes I'm awake  and know if your dirty tricks
847124182441873408 2017-03-29 16:31:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> someday I should give living in the city a chance
847123834847285249 2017-03-29 16:30:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's a Wake up call when you realize how much your boss appreciates you by cutting your hours and doesn't care what happens to you
847123090526146560 2017-03-29 16:27:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> Trump and the Republicans just sold out your internet privacy. So much for giving him a chance. I was right not to give him a chance
846945148739211264 2017-03-28 04:40:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> Some good Christians right here @PPacthttps://twitter.com/AP/status/846903043043962886

846748148584341505 2017-03-28 15:37:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> 2017 is a year of transition. A year of rebuilding. A year of redesigning. It's not over. My life isn't over. Its only evolving
846547942387388417 2017-03-27 02:22:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> What's a lunch money Lewis. I sure miss the days of @limpbizkit performing at @WrestleMania
846396847342190592 2017-03-27 16:21:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> God doesn't move unless you do. God does his part and you do yours   #FaithInAction
846383160187392000 2017-03-27 15:27:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's time to re- evaluate all the people in my life.  Change is happening. Time to rebuild my life
846067657686355968 2017-03-26 18:33:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> Let's see who stays by my side during the struggle

846035412342788096 2017-03-26 16:25:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> All I can do at this point is remain positive and keep faith in God that I find a new job soon. No one can live on 12 hours a week
846035124001099776 2017-03-26 16:24:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> 5 days until the @WWE #HallOfFame 6 until @WWENXT #TakeOver and 7 days until @WrestleMania I can't wait
845464593736646656 2017-03-24 02:37:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> On second thought I'll stay a #ItWorks distributor. Hard times ahead and I need to get a stable income. Hopefully business picks up
845457896041254913 2017-03-24 02:10:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> Certain things need to end so greater things can begin. Thanks @TrentShelton something I needed to hear right now   #RehabTime

845124521396912129 2017-03-23 04:06:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> @proawf When I found out that @OfficialHacksaw and @JannettyHOF was going to be at the upcoming @ProAWF show in granite falls I just had to come
845123741487054849 2017-03-23 04:02:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> Taking a break from doing #ItWorks. Too many things in life going on and to figure out right now
845123182872838144 2017-03-23 04:00:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> @proawf Can't wait to see @ProAWF this may in granite falls. Selfie with @DJDanielson this time
845121629881434113 2017-03-23 03:54:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> You know how much your boss cares about you when he gives you 12 hours a week. He goes on vacation I'm in deep poverty
845119991036862464 2017-03-23 03:48:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> The Republican healthcare plan kicks 24 million people off their insurance. Pay more for less care. If you support this you have no morals
845117855527976962 2017-03-23 03:39:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> Josh Matthews couldn't survive one hour at the @4MonsterFactory he hardly survived @WWEToughEnough.

779130317109989378 2016-09-22 01:28:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> the sports media wrong again about the @Patriots and @JBrissett12. Remember who the coach is and the other players on that team  #Patriots

773940436087910400 2016-09-08 17:45:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> If anything from last night's NBC forum taught us anything that is Donald trump shouldn't be President and is too stupid to do so
773939972034273280 2016-09-08 17:44:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @jemelehill @HisAndHers as @stephenasmith has said why does Jeff Fisher still have a job in the NFL. They need a better coach
773939333984202753 2016-09-08 17:41:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> @russ4life 
773939208176009217 2016-09-08 17:41:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> Despite what the sports media is saying the @Broncos will rise up and overcome. They will win the West. I Believe in @TrevorSiemian
773917782270316544 2016-09-08 16:15:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @jemelehill @michaelsmith you are underestimating the @Broncos they will indeed will still own the afc East. The raiders really lmao

773716048696651776 2016-09-07 02:54:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @realDonaldTrump 
773715841695125508 2016-09-07 02:53:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> So happy @ESanders_10 is staying with the @Broncos has become one of my favorites   #Broncos
773715396893356032 2016-09-07 02:51:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> The @Broncos have haters and critics to prove wrong and they will. Believe that.  #Broncos
773714625971953668 2016-09-07 02:48:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> The awesomeness when you find out your new pastor from church is a huge @starwars fan and wants to go to the new movie  as a church
773541309290156032 2016-09-07 15:19:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Broncos omg awesomeness @Broncos
773405758222458884 2016-09-06 06:21:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> Very disappointed that @JasonJordanJJ and @WWEGable will miss #Backlash and a chance to be @WWE tag team champions
773376620828631046 2016-09-06 04:25:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> Nothing like getting treated like dirt and being unappreciated by those who will never do the same for me 
773216809763807232 2016-09-06 17:50:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> If #GeorgeZimmerman was convicted and sentenced to jail he wouldn't be homeless right now. Karma is a Bitch
773008349298249728 2016-09-05 04:02:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well it wasn't til a few days ago I found out Mr plays with squirrels @willfriedle was #batman in #batmanbeyond pretty cool.
773007865988603904 2016-09-05 04:00:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> You can't help people who won't help themselves. If someone is giving you a hand and helping you improve yourself rise   up and improve
772995454464249856 2016-09-05 03:10:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ilikesamizayn Well @iLikeSamiZayn and #kevinOwens in one hell of a main event on @WWE #RAW but I'm sure Mr irrelevant #VinceRusso will find a problem
772959705966587904 2016-09-05 00:48:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> 20 years since #BatmanTheAnimatedSeries debuted. I remember watching that everyday on fox kids and having alot of the action figures
772956419746168832 2016-09-05 00:35:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> I guess I can never explain to some people how excited I get when the @Cubs get a walk Off win like yesterday. Some will never understand
772879129016283136 2016-09-05 19:28:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> It just wouldn't be the same on #LaborDay without the @Cubs on @WGNTV
772817190479204352 2016-09-05 15:22:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> @tonyromo @NFL @FirstTake  I needed a big laugh today
772791093721124865 2016-09-05 13:38:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Happy #LaborDay today we honor #LaborUnions and all the great things they have done for this country. Labor built this country
772584211643453440 2016-09-04 23:56:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's hard to see @HamillHimself as #LukeSkywalker knowing he is the man behind the insane joker in #BatmanTheAnimatedSeries
772583603184152576 2016-09-04 23:54:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FiTe Another great episode from @CWFHollywood on @fite. Some of the finest wrestling in the country
772567678099738624 2016-09-04 22:51:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> Magic number 11. @JasonHeyward with a walk Off hit and cubs win cubs win cubs win @Cubs 
772523271199698944 2016-09-04 19:54:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> This weekend brought to you by the #Labormovement so be sure to thank a #UnionMember

771895758169657344 2016-09-02 02:21:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> I would give anything to ditch box car day weekend and go to the West coast to see @TheWCWC they have some Damn fine wrestling
771895002846769153 2016-09-02 02:18:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @HillaryClinton being President means #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner will #ImWithHer and #ImWithTacos

771557574424403968 2016-09-01 03:57:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Not a 49ers fan but proud of @Kaepernick7 and @StayingInMyLane as well. I support you guys
771537764953141250 2016-09-01 02:38:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> The defense has stepped up for @GopherFootball keep it up in the second half guys   #Gophers
771402840854007808 2016-09-01 17:42:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheSidEudy same can be said for the crap he wrote in wcw
771402599979376640 2016-09-01 17:41:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Braves Now @FreddieFreeman5 has a career high of 28 homers this year and after a 2 run single from @TheRealMattKemp @braves up 5- 1  #ChopOn
771365647292825600 2016-09-01 15:14:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> So that moron Vince Russo doesn't thinks kevin Owens is a star. Well excuse me this comes from a man who made the wcw tv product into trash
771356465789493248 2016-09-01 14:38:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RobMyers1968 it's been happening to me over the past year
771259519175266304 2016-09-01 08:12:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Kaepernick7 I support you 100 percent man. Much love to ya for sticking up for the right thing
771258480221036544 2016-09-01 08:08:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am pretty much the only person in town not excited for boxcar days. Honestly its getting to be a bad rerun of a tv show
771217820826816513 2016-08-31 05:27:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well the @Cubs  with the sweep over the pirates tonight. The nl central title is coming back home this year.
771145665988562944 2016-08-31 00:40:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> I can't believe only 20 games left at Turner field. My heart sinks. Another thing gone from my childhood.
771141703444992002 2016-08-31 00:24:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> #homerun @Cubs by @KrisBryant_23 up 1- 0
771057573483151360 2016-08-31 18:50:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> #DonaldTrump is nothing more than a small handed ignorant racist orange man who is also a pathelogicl liar and a fraud
771057118996668417 2016-08-31 18:48:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> One day away from @GopherFootball I can wait 
771056873474633728 2016-08-31 18:47:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> The same people who are condemning @Kaepernick7 for not saying America isn't great is voting for a guy who says the same thing   #hypocrisy
771056358422482945 2016-08-31 18:45:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FirstTake @stephenasmith no @TimTebow does not belong in @WWE neither. How bout the @dallascowboys they do need a backup
771040940639170560 2016-08-31 17:44:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> Mark sanchez not good enough to be the @Broncos quarterback but good enough for the Vikings you can have him
771040181860179968 2016-08-31 17:41:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> Honestly someone should build a wall around trump and his supporters then make him pay for it
771039663310016512 2016-08-31 17:39:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> What did Tim Tebow even do to get a baseball tryout or contract. He is not even in the league of #derekjeter or @Bharper3407 quit comparing
770837413224525824 2016-08-30 04:15:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWE @ChazMosh @GRthrasher still as awesome as they were in 1997 glad to see them on @wwe again
770836207966167040 2016-08-30 04:10:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> I really do think the team of @ZackRyder and @MojoRawleyWWE is awesome. Mojo reminds me of @RobGronkowski
770816238452822016 2016-08-30 02:51:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Disappointed that @Tim_Canova lost the primary tonight I believe he would of Been a better representative for that district in Florida
770672873069350912 2016-08-30 17:21:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @teddyplayalong I remember those days like yesterday. I miss those days in @WWE
770672163552505856 2016-08-30 17:18:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> Since #rickperry is gonna join dancing with the stars I wonder if he will be armed. I mean dancing is lethal and you must protect yourself 
770504451996028928 2016-08-29 06:12:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> Since @HeymanHustle is so good at selling could he sell Vince Russo to @TheJimCornette 
770495150367711232 2016-08-29 05:35:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> With @TrevorSiemian being the new @Broncos i will support him like i did all the others though the years. That includes brian griese
770494754664644608 2016-08-29 05:33:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> #GeneWilder will still live on through films and memes
770494123157680128 2016-08-29 05:31:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> @StarburyMarbury where can your shoes be purchased
770493757544337408 2016-08-29 05:30:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why would anyone have sex with a mcchicken sandwich some people are sick. You're supposed to eat the food not have sex with it
770492605385805830 2016-08-29 05:25:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> So #DonaldTrump says he will solve African American problems but when they have problems he tells them to leave the country
770492162198872064 2016-08-29 05:23:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> @nodqdotcom it's 2016 what that slime Vince Russo thinks is irrelevant
770491693590253568 2016-08-29 05:21:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Walk off and @Cubs win. Oh What a rush
770491397434646528 2016-08-29 05:20:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FinnBalor @_SgtSlaughter @FightOwensFight he is just holding the title until the #demonking returns
770482145848598528 2016-08-29 04:43:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> Last time I seen @GRthrasher @ChazMosh in @WWE was 1999 and I was only 11 and now as a adult i will seen them return on #SmackDownLIVE
770480268905971712 2016-08-29 04:36:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> My new favorite wrestler after getting into @ParagonPW and @TheWCWC is @calebkonley thanks to @FiteTV for leading me to new wrestling shows
770479110699220996 2016-08-29 04:31:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Starting to get those @DCComics animated films of #batman on DVD. The killing joke had me hooked
770460479722393600 2016-08-29 03:17:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> I would congratulate #kevinowens but he blocked me then again I now understand why he blocks people.
770444587017961473 2016-08-29 02:14:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> now if there is a title shot involved their is a point. Remember @BookerT5x and benoit fought over a wcw  tv title shot
770441950398820352 2016-08-29 02:04:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> So what is the whole point of the best of 7 series between @WWESheamus and @WWECesaro #RAW
770420827170799616 2016-08-29 00:40:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> @mark_tarello @keyc 
770415686132707328 2016-08-29 00:19:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> If @Kaepernick7 was a cop and killed a unarmed citizen the same people who criticizing him now would support him and worship him
770330571553722368 2016-08-29 18:41:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> @michaelsmith I agree that @TrevorSiemian is keeping the starting spot warm for @PaxtonLynch
770315768374276097 2016-08-29 17:42:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's been more peaceful on here since I blocked the trolls and changed my settings. You shouldn't get attacked for the things you enjoy
770315389079171072 2016-08-29 17:41:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Anthony wiener needs some serious help and Needs to get his shit together   #popGoesTheWeiner
770314644372074496 2016-08-29 17:38:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's official @TrevorSiemian is the starting quarterback for the @Broncos in week one so let's roll with it and support the new starting qb

770064985405943808 2016-08-28 01:06:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> A new #ChesapeakeShores on @hallmarkchannel 
770055813956243458 2016-08-28 00:29:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> seems to me that the bullies of social media like to ruin things for everyone else. That includes sports and music. Show respect to others
770047701325115393 2016-08-28 23:57:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> So Donald trump is for releasing medical records but not tax returns. So what is he hiding   #crookedTrump
770029740015153152 2016-08-28 22:46:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's sad and pathetic on how people bully others just on the things they like and what they are into. How bout grow up and get a life

769997213942554624 2016-08-28 20:36:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> Getting to listen to #VinScully on @MLB extra innings today watching the @Cubs game. One of the best
769994392996343809 2016-08-28 20:25:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's funny how the idiots attacking @Kaepernick7 for not standing for the flag will vote for #DonaldTrump who refuse to fight for the flag
769991263441547264 2016-08-28 20:13:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> @HulkHogan @brutusbeefcake_ https://twitter.com/WNSource/status/769988064852803584
769990776264744962 2016-08-28 20:11:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> The alt right is just a bunch of sad and pathetic white supremacist they are trash
769990260210147329 2016-08-28 20:09:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> @moosenation69 @RealPlaisted take away Matt hardy talking and that is a pretty good show
769989506074279937 2016-08-28 20:06:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> The late #MrFuji known for managing 3 major teams in the @WWE golden era #Demolition #powersOfPain and the #OrientExpress and the berzerker
769983088722079745 2016-08-28 19:40:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> #byefeliciahttps://twitter.com/FOXSports/status/769982332682039297
769981923838009345 2016-08-28 19:36:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> No not the devious one Mr Fuji R.I.P 
769748604873416704 2016-08-27 04:09:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Looks like @TrevorSiemian will be the starting quarterback for the @Broncos week 1 let's support him and cheer loud
769748081055191042 2016-08-27 04:06:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RicFlairNatrBoy @ByMikeMooneyham that makes me feel old I remember those days like it was yesterday
769747811323654144 2016-08-27 04:05:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FiteTV @CWFHollywood 
769738275510628352 2016-08-27 03:28:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> @MileHighReport @TurfShowTimes I want @PaxtonLynch to be starter but if @TrevorSiemian is i will indeed support him #DB4Life
769737803852685312 2016-08-27 03:26:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> Yes the @Braves on the merge of winning tonight. Still love this team as much as i did when I was a kid 
769737353787125761 2016-08-27 03:24:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thank God for the @Broncos app and @MileHighReport giving me updates on the game tonight
769734480021991424 2016-08-27 03:12:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> New episodes of @CWFHollywood and @TheWCWC on @FiteTV hopefully tomorrow love being able to watch new wrestling on my phone
769732544979832833 2016-08-27 03:05:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> How bout showing @Broncos pre season games on national tv instead of these dead awful teams no one cares about like the raiders
769717117478240256 2016-08-27 02:03:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> The same people who are condemning what @Kaepernick7 did are the ones voting for a guy who refused to fight for that same flag  #DonaldTrump
769716481214951425 2016-08-27 02:01:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> Alt right is just a politically correct term for white supremacist
769690071670730752 2016-08-27 00:16:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> I don't agree with the way @Kaepernick7 protest but agree with his reasoning. Yet the ones condemning him are voting for a draft dodger
769613056347222017 2016-08-27 19:10:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> Didn't @stephenasmith say two weeks ago on @FirstTake that the cowboys are a accident waiting to happen look what happened to Romo.
769612812549107712 2016-08-27 19:09:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> I am hoping @PaxtonLynch is the starting quarterback for the @Broncos but if @TrevorSiemian is i will rally behind him and support him
769595198502412290 2016-08-27 17:59:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> https://twitter.com/Duke_FB/status/769579135760994304
769576293444771840 2016-08-27 16:44:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> #donaldtrump using the death of Dwayne wade's cousin to try to lure black votes is disgusting. He is the scum of the earth and  horrible 
769415964999888896 2016-08-26 06:07:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> These lifetime true story movies are terrible
769414579034009600 2016-08-26 06:01:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> Calling Donald trump trash is a insult to actual trash and the Dallas cowboys 
769412690674487296 2016-08-26 05:54:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @christyreports I hear you are from new ulm Minnesota.  Awesome fact. Pro wrestling has a representative from southwest Minnesota
769410960406765568 2016-08-26 05:47:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well those @Patriots are 3-0 and when Brady returns be scared
769245555809656832 2016-08-26 18:50:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> Now i found @nwasmokymtn on the @FiteTV I know what I'll be watching tonight. Best app I ever downloaded and got to see the new @ParagonPW
769092108921761792 2016-08-26 08:40:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> So Wikileaks is full of https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/769021613329289216
769022374582812672 2016-08-25 04:03:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow the @carrieunderwood concert @PREMIER_Center is less than 2 months away. Time flies. 
769021795299106821 2016-08-25 04:00:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> The Dallas cowboys are 
769020308376391681 2016-08-25 03:55:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Training my mind to be positive isn't easy but it has to be done
769020138737766400 2016-08-25 03:54:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> All I want say is @jemelehill is a excellent journalist and good at her job. Love The work she does
769018926860730368 2016-08-25 03:49:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thank God it's Friday tomorrow the new @FLAGALine album is released mine is pre ordered and should be in the mail next week 
769017891073171456 2016-08-25 03:45:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> If #DonaldTrump don't want to be called racist or a bigot maybe he should stop being one
769016912361775104 2016-08-25 03:41:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well didn't @stephenasmith say the @dallascowboys are a accident waiting to happen a week ago and look what happen. The man is right again
768720700760731649 2016-08-25 08:04:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheWCWC I have been watching @ParagonPW on @FiteTV too and now it's become one of my favorite wrestling promotions
768686516843388928 2016-08-24 05:48:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> Getting caught up on @OfficialSDW on @FiteTV best app I ever downloaded. Even found a new promotion I like with @TheWCWC
768502419957293056 2016-08-24 17:37:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> But he isn't racist so he claims https://twitter.com/SayNoToGOP/status/768500281013334016
768501575509606402 2016-08-24 17:33:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> It's 8-24 happy #KobeBryantDay @kobebryant
768499652337336320 2016-08-24 17:26:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> Funny how Josh Norman says he shut @DemaryiusT down but who won the Superbowl and who has a Superbowl ring. It's not Josh Norman
768498799597662208 2016-08-24 17:22:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> @mikethemiz is not a pimple on @WWEDanielBryan ass. Daniel bryan has had better matches in one month than the miz has had his entire career
768481882681974785 2016-08-24 16:15:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> When someone says the chiefs are gonna win the afc westpic.twitter.com/HFbHonucO9
768340330861109248 2016-08-23 06:53:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> I think @PaxtonLynch should be starter for the @Broncos he has been playing very well
768339704559259648 2016-08-23 06:50:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> I remember a time when @WWE titles didn't look the same
768339485419462656 2016-08-23 06:49:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> Why would @hardball have a complete moron like Ann coulter on. She lies every time her lips move just like trump
768120008832450560 2016-08-23 16:17:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> It sure seems to me that the sports media has already counted out the @Broncos all I can say watch as they prove you wrong like usual
767782198388793345 2016-08-22 17:55:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> So Donald trump gets his advice on foreign policy from Michelle Bachmann. You can now realize where the stupid comes from
767599935147483136 2016-08-21 05:51:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> Biggest surprise of the night @FinnBalor becomes the first ever @WWE #UniversalChampion oh what a @SummerSlam it was
767516267532029952 2016-08-21 00:18:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> The road to a gold medal starts at @Duke_MBB congrats @KyrieIrving and @TeamUSA
767500832950489088 2016-08-21 23:17:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> That team not nearly as good as the team of @BretHart and #owenhart now that was a team from Canada   #SummerSlam
767432128044802049 2016-08-21 18:44:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> I do think @PaxtonLynch should be the starting quarterback for the @Broncos
767167962587369472 2016-08-20 01:14:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Broncos not being on tv tonight has me likepic.twitter.com/OVjsi6Aa1q
766881936602124288 2016-08-19 06:17:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> Win this @Cubs I want to go to bed 
766852775502229504 2016-08-19 04:22:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Downloaded the @FiteTV app and now I can watch @OfficialSDW @PPWWrestling1 @CWFHollywood and other Indy wrestling
766788090778103808 2016-08-19 00:05:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FiteTV I think i will download then thanks
766695953092882432 2016-08-19 17:58:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> Does anyone know if the @FiteTV app is any good I am thinking of downloading it
766695485943840768 2016-08-19 17:57:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BillClinton Happy birthday to @billclinton 
766694663101173760 2016-08-19 17:53:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> Wow @WWERollins took the tough questions from @jemelehill well today on @HisAndHers but the demon king @FinnBalor awaits him at @SummerSlam
766666028772315136 2016-08-19 15:59:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> #MNLoveTrumpsHate
766508486809128961 2016-08-18 05:33:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> Thunderstorm 
766474315269234688 2016-08-18 03:18:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> @switchfoot this is home is my favorite song of yours it speaks to me and relates to my journey in life right now
766473983680057344 2016-08-18 03:16:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> As you can tell on #nakeddonaldtrump it's not his hands that are small 
766473392283201536 2016-08-18 03:14:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> @ByMikeMooneyham well @WWE is just saying happy birthday 
766472032980643841 2016-08-18 03:09:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @espn @TheUndefeated @jemelehill when will it air
766470556346486784 2016-08-18 03:03:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> Today @KrisBryant_23 5 for 5 with 2 #homeruns all I can say is #MVP
766132205126955009 2016-08-17 04:38:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> 2 in a row for the @Cubs 
766102277090226177 2016-08-17 02:39:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> I may be one of the few excited about #JonStewart @SummerSlam but I just love him especially if he cost @WWERollins the universal title
766101297854414848 2016-08-17 02:35:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> I would laugh if @stephenasmith fantasy football team ends up being the Dallas cowboys of fantasy football @MollyQerim @Max_Kellerman
766100759259729920 2016-08-17 02:33:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> Trump supporters are either stupid. Racist or both
766100571552030720 2016-08-17 02:33:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> Finally got me a @KerryWood jersey growing up in the late 90s early 2000s he was my favorite player
765762497576067072 2016-08-16 04:09:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> @jerridsebesta  so happy to hear this
765762034692722689 2016-08-16 04:07:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @russ4life who hasn't nobody buys edited cds

765760430191079424 2016-08-16 04:01:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> If I have to get these pictures taken then i am wearing my @Broncos jersey maybe my @PaxtonLynch one
765410204234067968 2016-08-15 04:49:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> I can't wait to having the feeling of moving to a new town again
765409756181782528 2016-08-15 04:48:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> The last thing I would ever become is a Republican
765409319311376384 2016-08-15 04:46:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> Just another month and fall will be here. Can't wait for those cool crisp evening temps 
765408342034350080 2016-08-15 04:42:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> Let's be honest the prime time players @TitusONeilWWE and @DarrenYoungWWE don't need @AskMrBacklund
765407471603036160 2016-08-15 04:38:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> @TheSidEudy or the intergalactic champion
765406585950572546 2016-08-15 04:35:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BeckyLynchWWE don't forget @ASJAustin @AustinAries
765060241591377921 2016-08-14 05:39:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> Funny how Scott walker bashes @POTUS and the federal government but doesn't mind wanting their help
765059804226138113 2016-08-14 05:37:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> #trumpsupporters so dumb they don't even know they are being lied to by a scam artist
765059396212707328 2016-08-14 05:35:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> Don't worry @Cubs will bounce back keep the faith my friends
765059047863103488 2016-08-14 05:34:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @hallmarkchannel I enjoyed #ChesapeakeShores tonight very good show
765001622091026432 2016-08-14 01:46:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> 
764665070232088576 2016-08-13 03:28:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> @DJDanielson well it makes it easy to spot a low information voter 
764664138471608320 2016-08-13 03:25:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> The cowboys choked and it's only pre season 
764661579790954496 2016-08-13 03:15:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> @RealSkipBayless get over it already. Cowboys are trash
764660876041269248 2016-08-13 03:12:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Like a drifter I was born to walk alone 
764630279616991232 2016-08-13 01:10:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> @AdamSchefter @uSTADIUM as @stephenasmith has said why does Jeff Fisher still have a job in the NFL
764611444453183490 2016-08-13 23:55:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> Would be nice if I had people to hang out with in this stink hole town 
764570990810542080 2016-08-13 21:15:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> Well the @Cubs lost for the first time in two weeks. Have won 11 outta the last 12 games nothing to be ashamed of   #Cubs
764509552666480640 2016-08-13 17:10:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> Dude @TheNotoriousMMA is not even in the same weight class as @JohnCena
764334287537614848 2016-08-12 05:34:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> Raiders win one pre season game and fans think they are Superbowl contenders 
764168476957089792 2016-08-12 18:35:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> Is it possible that @jemelehill and @MichelleDBeadle could do a @espn show sometime that would be so awesome
764168130755080192 2016-08-12 18:34:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> Make 11 wins in a row today @Cubs 
764167657897680896 2016-08-12 18:32:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> Can't wait to be spending my Saturdays watching college football @Duke_FB @TarHeelFootball @GopherFootball
764139339978674180 2016-08-12 16:39:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Inkonitwear both teams as always. Cutty isn't that good.
763963276677963780 2016-08-11 05:00:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> I predict The Beast will defeat The Viper at #SummerSlam. Who do you think will win? https://cards.twitter.com/cards/4h4bq/21mkl
763961945107996672 2016-08-11 04:54:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> If #DonaldTrump found Isis they would be bankrupt by now 
763957102406623232 2016-08-11 04:35:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> 10 in a row for the @Cubs

763575439491145730 2016-08-10 03:19:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> A cop gets killed by a white supremacist yet i don't see one blue lives matter post on social media. Oh that is right they can't blame blm

751274394551332864 2016-07-07 04:39:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> responding to violence with more violence is wrong. a cop shooting a black man at a traffic stop is wrong. a sniper targeting cops is wrong

750559935356891137 2016-07-05 05:20:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> @FoxNews @MSNBC i quit watching them months ago. i gave up on them
750509386649350144 2016-07-05 01:59:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> it seems the only time republicans question the law helping the rich and powerful is only when it pertains to @HillaryClinton

750506293308198912 2016-07-05 01:46:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> the #FinalDeletion sounds like someone is gonna through their facebook friends list and someone is deleted last. did vince russo come back
750505101287055361 2016-07-05 01:42:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> we can talk about the emails of @HillaryClinton when #GeorgeWBush and #DickCheney are indicted for being the war criminals they are
750502684738760705 2016-07-05 01:32:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> i know @B_Ingram13 has some big shoes to fill with the @Lakers but as a laker fan i support him. its a new era folks.
750198734164627456 2016-07-04 05:24:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @jemelehill it depends who you ask lol
750195131735613440 2016-07-04 05:10:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> honestly i should be used of being left out and not existing to certain people

750157848949035008 2016-07-04 02:42:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> honestly the #WyattFamily are hillbillies. they are like the family you find living in the swamp playing the banjo on the front porch
750157289533763585 2016-07-04 02:40:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> #DonaldTrump is about as christian as the T-rex was a herbivore
750155371075940352 2016-07-04 02:32:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> the reason players don't want to sign with the @Lakers was never because of @kobebryant but because of the front office #firejimbuss
750152245669269506 2016-07-04 02:20:07 UTC <philnevergiveup> #TheFinalDeletion what is that a facebook unfriending. one more reason not to watch #TNA like @TheJimCornette says #TNAsucks
750151985916047361 2016-07-04 02:19:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> #thenBeatUpJohnCena is really not that funny @AJStylesOrg and i don't even like @JohnCena

738250637171785733 2016-06-01 06:07:22 UTC <philnevergiveup> its shameful what #TNA has done to #MattHardy that place is such a joke

737516692125810690 2016-05-30 05:30:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> i remember when @OfficialPWI had @AJStylesOrg and @JohnCena on the cover 10 years ago and a decade later that fantasy warfare is now real
737513379158319104 2016-05-30 05:17:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> between the @warriors and @Seahawks i don't know who has bandwagon fans.
737512821366231041 2016-05-30 05:15:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> we all know @RusevBUL likes to brag what a great #WWeUschamp he is but he is no where near the level of @itsvadertime

737508970022064132 2016-05-30 05:00:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> makes you wonder if the @NBA rigged tonight's game  #Itsawork
737507917381787649 2016-05-30 04:56:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> all it takes is one person to come down here and start up drama again. i want no part of it  #Dramafree
737506352130461696 2016-05-30 04:49:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> i remain with supporting @BernieSanders as long as he remains in this race. just maybe he can make a come back too  #StillSanders

737450358516023298 2016-05-30 01:07:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> one thing #JBL can't say it that he has won a @WrestleMania main event because he never has.
737448307849494529 2016-05-30 00:59:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> go and win game 7 tonight @okcthunder finish the job  #ThunderUp
737447614501642240 2016-05-30 00:56:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> reminder to day is #MemorialDay2016 not #NationalBBQDay alof of men and women risked it all for this country. remember that
737049552956444672 2016-05-29 22:34:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> learning to be more thankful and appreciate what i have. working on getting my faith stronger and to be more positive
736621814508462080 2016-05-28 18:15:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> i would send @WWERollins a birthday card but he would just burn it  #HappyBirthdaySethRollins

736596249235722240 2016-05-28 16:33:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> just a reminder that #MemorialDayWeekend is not about grilling burgers, hotdogs, eating potato salad, etc.
736426558466838528 2016-05-27 05:19:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> back to extinction for the @Raptors the @cavs are headed back to the #NBAFinals was there any doubt. not in my mind  #ALLinCLE
736376121982259200 2016-05-27 01:58:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> the @MinnesotaDFL must retake control of the minnesota state house again. tax breaks for big tobacco is unacceptable from the #mngop #mnleg
736375021329731584 2016-05-27 01:54:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> @sendahms so how does a big tax break for big tobacco benefit rural minnesota in anyway.  #mnleg
736373600949669888 2016-05-27 01:48:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> my district is represented by 2 republicans so explain to me how a tax break for big tobacco benefits rural minnesota in anyway  #mnleg
736373248762351617 2016-05-27 01:47:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> 20 years since @SCOTTHALLNWO came out on #wcwMondayNitro coming through the crowd and say you know who i am but don't know why i am here
736372473277489152 2016-05-27 01:44:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> i bet #DonaldTrump is scared shitless of @HillaryClinton like he is @BernieSanders #TrumpChicken
736370943078060032 2016-05-27 01:38:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> so i hope @JohnCena got permission to use the logo of @PabstBlueRibbon on his new t-shirt. i knew that logo looked familiar
736369409506217985 2016-05-27 01:32:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> so let me get this straight the @mngop don't mind giving a handout to big tobacco but has a issue funding for healthcare workers  #mnleg
736367282260037632 2016-05-27 01:23:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> #DonaldTrump talks a big game challenging @BernieSanders to a debate but when it comes to paying the piper he backs out.   #TrumpChicken
736048353021026305 2016-05-26 04:16:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> anyone know when the new @FLAGALine cd comes out
736048222519463937 2016-05-26 04:15:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> i sure miss world championship wrestling the announce team of @tonyschiavone24 @RealMikeTenay #BobbyHennan add @LivingLegendLZ to that list
736046721487101952 2016-05-26 04:09:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> so the @mngop gives #Bigtobacco a tax break instead of doing something good like funding overtime for home healthcare workers  #mnleg
736040889672290304 2016-05-26 03:46:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> so @WWEBigE what would happen if someone dares to be sour
736016147233968128 2016-05-26 02:08:18 UTC <philnevergiveup> awesome @mauroranallo mentioned the likes of #BarryWindham #KensukeSasaki #TheMinnesotaWreckingcrew on #Smackdown #Oldschool #tradition

735705110756524032 2016-05-25 05:32:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> i'm disappointed that @JoakimNoah will be leaving the @chicagobulls but fans like myself are frustrated with the management too
735698762484457472 2016-05-25 05:07:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> wow the @cavs just slaughtered the @Raptors tonight. just one game to go and those barney impersonators go back into extinction   #Cavs
735666535365107713 2016-05-25 02:59:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> please this can't be the final @Nashville_ABC its getting so good. listen to us @ABCNetwork #BringBackNashville
735662979094478849 2016-05-25 02:44:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> people's minds change when you quit being afraid @Nashville_ABC
735660132751679488 2016-05-25 02:33:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> i really hope this isn't really the last episode of @Nashville_ABC #BringBackNashville
735641143652671488 2016-05-25 01:18:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> they say there is someone for everyone. so when will i find mine

731711947243028480 2016-05-14 05:04:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> well @HotshotDannyD has recaptured the @OfficialSDW heavyweight championship tonight
731704066988875779 2016-05-14 04:33:38 UTC <philnevergiveup> in my opinion @TheLethalJay has a fair argument in saying he is the greatest @ringofhonor world heavyweight champion in history
731703713169952768 2016-05-14 04:32:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> i have been watching @CedricAlexander since @ringofhonor came to sinclair broadcasting in 2011 and loved the tag team with @CapriceColeman
731702065597014016 2016-05-14 04:25:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> well i never expected a follow from @ErvinSantana_54 that is pretty cool
731655545275342848 2016-05-14 01:20:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> so @RobGronkowski is on his way to being the greatest tight end of all time.  i guess that means the @Patriots having the greatest QB & TE
731647452772601857 2016-05-14 00:48:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> wait what @WCCORosen sports sunday is ending. this can't be. that has been part of the @WCCO newscast as long as i have been alive

731646228308459520 2016-05-14 00:43:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> its heartbreaking to for me to look at prom pics on social media it reminds me of mine and a person i am sadly no longer friends with
731645832915619840 2016-05-14 00:42:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> it breaks my heart to see @GenuineLexLuger in a wheelchair. i was such a huge fan of his as a kid and even now i still enjoy his old matches

725909322769682432 2016-04-28 04:47:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> all i can say is @JArrieta34 is the man and he is on the @Cubs 5-0. yes they are good so get used to it folks

725903147349086214 2016-04-28 04:22:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> dear #CowboysNation quit bragging about your team they suck. until they are good and winning again there is nothing to brag about
725902661191495680 2016-04-28 04:20:55 UTC <philnevergiveup> so if its #NationalSuperheroDay i think @jdfffn and @ASJAustin is qualified for that

725186330687365120 2016-04-26 04:54:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> i wouldn't vote for #DonaldTrump even if he was coming outta my ass

725178382149914624 2016-04-26 04:22:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> this @espn vs @FOXSports thing kinda reminds me of the #MondayNightwars in the 90's between the @WWE and WCW
725177757840347137 2016-04-26 04:20:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> back in the day being selfish and bigoted made you a jerk now days we just call them #Republicans

724831318807330816 2016-04-25 05:23:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> the people who are happy about the 4 game suspension of #TomBrady are fans of teams that suck and never win anything anyway
724831144265547778 2016-04-25 05:23:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> no more of this i can't and that will never happen. one way or the other i am achieving my life goals i set for myself

724751589433479168 2016-04-25 00:06:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> today's ruling doesn't mean #TomBrady is guilty anyone with a brain knows he is innocent. its refers to the CBA  #FreeBrady
724747561655898113 2016-04-25 23:50:58 UTC <philnevergiveup> i support #TomBrady this whole thing is a injustice and this just fuels the fire of the @Patriots and #PatriotsNation #FreeBrady

713167426595086336 2016-03-24 00:55:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> discrimination based on sexual orientation needs to stop in this country. it has nothing to do with religion freedom. republicans are bigots

712342448203104256 2016-03-22 18:17:28 UTC <philnevergiveup> very significant to see a #MLB team face the #cubanNational team. first time a american team been in cuba since 99.  #MLBinCuba

712071651110727680 2016-03-21 00:21:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> if you think i am just gonna give up on @BernieSanders you are sadly mistaken  #StillSanders #StillBernie

706007446133706753 2016-03-04 06:44:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> speaking of frauds and crooks @nflcommish is one of them  #TomBradyisInnocent

705993374562529280 2016-03-04 05:48:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> one of the highlights of @WrestleMania 9 was @ShawnMichaels vs @NativeTatanka in a very good match. not  a good finish though
705992723229061120 2016-03-04 05:45:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> it is very fitting that the greatest wrestler of all time and the greatest Opponent @Sting ever had will induct him in the #WWEHOF

704093559197036544 2016-02-28 23:59:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> its a frustrating time if you're a @cavs fan right now
704087318651469825 2016-02-28 23:34:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> @VanJones68 @CNN so i guess you're a race baiter if you condemn the #KKK but not if you condemn muslims and latinos.
704086691158462464 2016-02-28 23:32:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> funny how #DonaldTrump will condemn Muslims and latinos but he won't condemn the #KuKluxKlan but he would lose majority of his supporters
704086035999756288 2016-02-28 23:29:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> just remember republicans are racist turds to start out with
704085798627348480 2016-02-28 23:28:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> @hailtopitthoops tough loss for @Duke_MBB but @HailToPittHoops was on their game today

704081608672833536 2016-02-28 23:11:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> so since @wwebalor has a new #bulletproof shirt maybe he could use the song bulletproof by @12Stones
704079672376602624 2016-02-28 23:04:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> if #Trump denounces the ku klux klan. he will lose the majority of his supporters
704078228676161536 2016-02-28 22:58:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> its funny how #DonaldTrump says he isn't racist but will not distance himself from the support he gets from the #Kkk.
703832071865659392 2016-02-27 06:40:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> after not listening to @simpleplan for a few years i am listening to them again. they still make great music. love the 2008 album
703829259589029888 2016-02-27 06:29:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> is it so wrong i would like to leave #TracyMn at some point knowing there is something out there much better for me.
703826461363277825 2016-02-27 06:17:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> what is so bad about #GmoLabeling. don't we have a right to know what is in our food

703776914868015104 2016-02-27 03:01:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> when you are single and afraid to tell your crush how you feel  #Singleproblems

703776035083452416 2016-02-27 02:57:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> i'm sticking with @BernieSanders til the end, we are not quiting & we are not going home. we are far from being berned out.
703730891076448256 2016-02-27 23:58:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> when was the last time someone gave a fuck about what #Aaroncarter had to say. no one has cared about him since he was at disney
703659737540222976 2016-02-27 19:15:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> working two jobs is killer for workers. the whole 7 day work week is killer too. some will never understand this
703656065448017921 2016-02-27 19:00:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> @BernieSanders is the only presidential candidate that supports #GMO labeling
703653356225503232 2016-02-27 18:50:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> #globalwarming is not a hoax but #trickledowneconomics sure is
703651852399747072 2016-02-27 18:44:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> so now @MSNBC is basically a propaganda network much like #fauxnews now.   #byefelicia

703402126253232128 2016-02-26 02:11:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> @rohcary i thought @KINGCorino and @MisterRasslin3 are not the same person. that is according to corino though. did you reveal his identity
703401470394179586 2016-02-26 02:09:13 UTC <philnevergiveup> its funny how @BernieSanders opposes the #TPP and now @MSNBC is critical of him. yeah that is because @comcast has there fingers in the tpp

703098238115524608 2016-02-25 06:04:17 UTC <philnevergiveup> when you watch @WrestleMania 5 it just makes you miss the color commentary of @GovJVentura nobody today comes close to the body
703098062068064256 2016-02-25 06:03:35 UTC <philnevergiveup> i am very driven to make something outta my life and find a real true purpose. a job is just part of it. there is more i must find

698022423937970177 2016-02-11 05:54:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> i have pretty much changed my perspective in life. i mean i can make the things i wanna make happen with less. just need to be patient
698022168878157824 2016-02-11 05:53:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> i am not oppose to moving elsewhere at some point in my life. #Minnesota is a big start alot of great towns and cities

697954937544704000 2016-02-11 01:26:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> looking forward to the #DemDebate tonight and looking forward to what @BernieSanders and @HillaryClinton has to say
697668599922561024 2016-02-10 06:28:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> #TitusONeil being suspended is utter bullshit
697662794565439488 2016-02-10 06:05:46 UTC <philnevergiveup> the milk in the fridge has a date for #ValentinesDay but i do not

697660934156759040 2016-02-10 05:58:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> i made my decision on who i support last june by choosing @BernieSanders and i am sticking with that choice through this primary
697660419528216576 2016-02-10 05:56:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> i cannot believe tonight was the last meeting between @KingJames and @kobebryant its a #Endofaera
697659940224151552 2016-02-10 05:54:26 UTC <philnevergiveup> the same people who say quit being offended by everything are the ones who are offended by something non racist from #Beyonce
697603708339630082 2016-02-10 02:10:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> i want to have a relationship like #JoshandGabi @YoungandHungry
697600478356598785 2016-02-10 01:58:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> get well soon @CMPunk can't wait to see you kick that ass in @ufc i support you 100 percent
697594868969795584 2016-02-10 01:35:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> the ones who are offended by @Beyonce performance are the same ones who defend the #confederateflag and say they aren't racist
697593946617171968 2016-02-10 01:32:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> so if say @JohnCena hugged @VinceMcMahon would he of got suspended for 60 days or is there a double standard
697310033122447360 2016-02-09 06:44:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> thank you @Beyonce #BlackLivesMatters yes indeedhttps://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/697309276012945409

697263728438353920 2016-02-09 03:40:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> if @ringofhonor gets a hall of fame @WWEDanielBryan should be the first inductee  #ThankYouDanielBryan
697261305846050817 2016-02-09 03:30:24 UTC <philnevergiveup> can't believe tomorrow night will be the last @KingJames vs @kobebryant matchup on @ESPNNBA i love both these guys @cavs @Lakers
696958764285493248 2016-02-08 07:28:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWEDanielBryan @McGuinnessNigel @ringofhonorpic.twitter.com/pLWczTz8Tm

696949790404427777 2016-02-08 06:52:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> i sick of the smear attacks from #HillaryClinton supporters on #BernieSanders supporters. one way or the other we will have to #UniteBlue
696941128252313600 2016-02-08 06:18:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> there is no @nyknicks fan that would want @dennisrodman as coach. i say maybe go for @MarkJackson13

696878306608545792 2016-02-08 02:08:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> did @mikethemiz refer to @IMPACTWRESTLING as a small pond  #RAW
696877119259815936 2016-02-08 02:03:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> dear @mikethemiz nobody likes your show. we all like @IAmJericho and the #HighlightReel

696550308831342592 2016-02-07 04:25:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> so i guess @stephenasmith was wrong the #Broncos are #SuperBowlChamps never underestimate the underdog and #orangecrush defense 2.0
696549954970472448 2016-02-07 04:23:45 UTC <philnevergiveup> the sports media has been silenced the @Broncos are #SuperBowlChamps like i said never underestimate the underdog. i been waiting 17 years
696454913232994304 2016-02-07 22:06:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> #SuperBowl #Broncos lets do this @Broncos its been 17 years. time to bring that trophy back to #Milehigh
696431439236083712 2016-02-07 20:32:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> #Broncos or Bust
696430019116199937 2016-02-07 20:27:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> if you watched the #KittenBowl on @hallmarkchannel @KiddWWE and @NatbyNature made a appearance
696211060315938816 2016-02-06 05:57:06 UTC <philnevergiveup> its such bs that @Terrell_Davis is not in the @ProFootballHOF
696176764616204288 2016-02-06 03:40:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> so many people are underestimating  the @Broncos but never underestimate the #Underdog
696171544842604544 2016-02-06 03:20:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> the people debating in the #GOPDebate are dipshits. sorry for the name calling but its true.
696162195718025216 2016-02-06 02:42:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> the #GOPDebate is the same BS as it always is.  tax cuts for the rich, blame obama, poor people are lazy, & what good christians they are
696155826126389249 2016-02-06 02:17:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> as usual the @Broncos are snubbed from the @ProFootballHOF
696100761617338368 2016-02-06 22:38:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> never underestimate a #Underdog because on sunday the @Broncos will disappoint all the critics
696098683532652544 2016-02-06 22:30:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> one day to go and remember this is not 2014 its 2016 and its a new set of coaches and different players. the @Broncos will bring it home

695829624845021185 2016-02-05 04:41:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> funny how all these people decided they are @Broncos and @Panthers fans when they weren't ever before.   #bandwagonfans
695829139367006208 2016-02-05 04:39:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> i'm a #progressive #Democrat #Christian and i stand behind @BernieSanders

695816675048882176 2016-02-05 03:49:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> what free stuff is that. #Republicans give free stuff to the rich and corporate america all the time
695816502302285824 2016-02-05 03:49:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> so since #ValentinesDay is around the corner maybe that be a good time to risk it all and tell her how i feel
695511388299481088 2016-02-04 07:36:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> you can't say i want half of what you have when you don't have that much to start out with
695511160632643584 2016-02-04 07:35:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> so facebook didn't give me a #friendsday video ha #Twitter is better anyway

695422977807024128 2016-02-04 01:45:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> i hear #HillaryClinton supporters bash @BernieSanders more than them saying why they support her.
695419783580286977 2016-02-04 01:32:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> wow @Ryback22 looks like @Goldberg on #SmackDown
695419405551841280 2016-02-04 01:31:21 UTC <philnevergiveup> #santaslittlehelper got snubbed because the @mikethemiz was in it and the miz sucks
695416168056619008 2016-02-04 01:18:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> @mauroranallo  your partner @JerryLawler didn't like alot of wrestlers back in the day as a broadcaster. only if they did something bad

694784255252037632 2016-02-02 07:27:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> when you find out your favorite high school teacher is a ignorant racist republican. very sad but i guess he was raised that way

694008590693064705 2016-01-31 04:05:16 UTC <philnevergiveup> #HillaryClinton supporters spend more time bashing @BernieSanders than than anything else. i am above that
694007933953150976 2016-01-31 04:02:40 UTC <philnevergiveup> so @TheJimCornette supports @BernieSanders i love this guy even more. jimmy is #FeelingTheBern
693933995990515712 2016-01-31 23:08:51 UTC <philnevergiveup> i hate being a #introvert

693661002479435776 2016-01-30 05:04:05 UTC <philnevergiveup> so @TheJimCornette hates #Vincerusso.  jim doesn't hate white people he hates idiots. russo is a idiot. for example judy bagwell on a pole
693660181083721728 2016-01-30 05:00:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> #FeelTheBern #Bernie2016
693542370470551552 2016-01-30 21:12:41 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Pizzazzland it is ok to me but it doesn't really seem like a wrestling show. its more of a comic book-western type of show
693541761503789056 2016-01-30 21:10:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Pizzazzland @TheJimCornette alot of #Newschoolwrestling is good i do not doubt that. very good point

693537834058125312 2016-01-30 20:54:39 UTC <philnevergiveup> no @TheJimCornette being called racist because he said #luchaunderground sucked is stupid. he thinks #TNA sucks too & its not based on race
693533100320563200 2016-01-30 20:35:50 UTC <philnevergiveup> when you google #RocknRollExpress in images  a picture of @MattJackson13 @NickJacksonYB  come up
693490285523828736 2016-01-30 17:45:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> @johnelway and @Terrell_Davis being snubbed from the @SuperBowl 50 golden team is a huge #joke.
693481790523068416 2016-01-30 17:11:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> @stephenasmith why would anyone want to play for them. that is where careers go to die
693481034466209793 2016-01-30 17:08:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> i'm a #liberal #Nonreligious #followerofjesus who is voting @BernieSanders . he is the most christian candidate and the #Republicans are not
693470306174787584 2016-01-30 16:26:19 UTC <philnevergiveup> its because of legends like @TheJimCornette i'm a wrestling fan to begin with
693467048874082304 2016-01-30 16:13:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @NWAwrestling hey @TheJimCornette i rather watch #smokeymountainwrestling classic @NWAWrestling or classic midsouth wrestling than anything today

693250752781811713 2016-01-29 01:53:54 UTC <philnevergiveup> i agree with @stephenasmith on that @PhilJackson11 may have pulled it off and turned the @nyknicks around.
693250529493815296 2016-01-29 01:53:00 UTC <philnevergiveup> so @TheJimCornette butt hurt a some people on his thoughts about #LuchaUnderground i have to admit he did make some good points
693249976697106433 2016-01-29 01:50:49 UTC <philnevergiveup> i believe the @chicagobulls do have what it takes to get to the @NBA Finals
693249696521781248 2016-01-29 01:49:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> the trump trolls are attacking already. well you will be blocked. i don't argue with idiots
693247046170480641 2016-01-29 01:39:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> there is no such thing as the liberal media. what world are conservatives living in
693246931414286336 2016-01-29 01:38:43 UTC <philnevergiveup> i'm no fan of @megynkelly but she does not deserve the treatment she gets from #DonaldTrump and his idiotic supporters
692954358850404354 2016-01-28 06:16:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> great win by the @chicagobulls tonight
692950503056084993 2016-01-28 06:00:48 UTC <philnevergiveup> well i guess the @Broncos will have to prove the media wrong as usual
692950398215311360 2016-01-28 06:00:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> never thought i would hear @mauroranallo call a @AJStylesOrg match. it was some #awesome
692949444552200193 2016-01-28 05:56:36 UTC <philnevergiveup> does anyone remember when @SHAQ was in the movie Steel. that was a awesome movie so was Kazaam. only a 90's kid would know
692947343289798661 2016-01-28 05:48:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> tough to find out on social media that your college friends are racist but i guess that is the way they were raised and taught. very sad
692946995695190021 2016-01-28 05:46:52 UTC <philnevergiveup> when @WWERollins returns @AJStylesOrg will be waiting
692945575399034880 2016-01-28 05:41:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> #StacyDash is a moron. there is no way around it
692889504235933697 2016-01-28 01:58:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> who said i wasn't #Batman
692889048998813696 2016-01-28 01:56:37 UTC <philnevergiveup> i am proud not to be a #Republican
692888908263092226 2016-01-28 01:56:03 UTC <philnevergiveup> why watch the #GOPDebate its the same crap. tax cuts for the rich, #climatechange is a hoax, more handouts for corporations. blah blah blah
692556997254864896 2016-01-27 03:57:09 UTC <philnevergiveup> its so cool to know that @BrianDozier grew up a @Braves fan and a fan of @RealCJ10 much like myself. so cool
692554273503199232 2016-01-27 03:46:20 UTC <philnevergiveup> had a great time at the @Twins caravan event in @Marshall_MN tonight. got to meet and got a photo with @BrianDozier and met #dangladden

692411291395330049 2016-01-27 18:18:10 UTC <philnevergiveup> today is the day @Twins caravan in @Marshall_MN gonna be a awesome time
692411060318556161 2016-01-27 18:17:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> i do not hear pro lifers yell about #RickSnyder poisoning children with contaminated water. oh that is right they are already born
692408852445319168 2016-01-27 18:08:29 UTC <philnevergiveup> #DonaldTrump a man who thinks he can handle Russia, China, North korea, and isis but can't handle @FoxNews and @megynkelly
692229050367098880 2016-01-26 06:14:01 UTC <philnevergiveup> #GaryKubiak doesn't get enough credit for playing a role in getting the @Broncos to the superbowl in his first season
692225115573108736 2016-01-26 05:58:23 UTC <philnevergiveup> @WWERoadDogg that song was pretty good though
692225015471869953 2016-01-26 05:57:59 UTC <philnevergiveup> in 2016 i plan to #Voteblue no matter what. no matter who the candidate is. we have to keep a republican outta the whitehouse
692224751083876352 2016-01-26 05:56:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> remember back in 1997 when @WWERoadDogg was known as the real double J and had that hit song be my baby tonight
692224329917034498 2016-01-26 05:55:15 UTC <philnevergiveup> i am not someone who grieves about things. i keep living life and moving on. i'm still writing my story
692223643087179776 2016-01-26 05:52:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> headed to the @Twins carvan tomorrow and looking to meet @BrianDozier
692222679097700353 2016-01-26 05:48:42 UTC <philnevergiveup> so i heard tonight @BernieSanders got 20,000 people in #StPaul #FeelTheBern
692222511786885120 2016-01-26 05:48:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> the best wrestling brother feuds have to be @BretHart vs his late brother #owenhart and @AxlRottenECW vs #Ianrotten
692221386027352064 2016-01-26 05:43:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> well i guess that #bundymilitia is occupying a new government building tonight
692220724573048832 2016-01-26 05:40:56 UTC <philnevergiveup> its apparent that @realjoshmathews has never heard of the real greatest cruiserweights like #JushinThunderLiger #Ultimodragon #Deanmalenko
692179024286760960 2016-01-26 02:55:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> its unchristian to support a bigot like #DonaldTrump #Evangelicals are a bunch of suckers
692178522702508035 2016-01-26 02:53:14 UTC <philnevergiveup> wait what @ShaneHelmsCom is on @IMPACTWRESTLING
692176924697845760 2016-01-26 02:46:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> #DonaldTrump acts like he is so tough yet he can't face @megynkelly
692160226590588928 2016-01-26 01:40:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> #StPaul is #FeelingTheBern as @BernieSanders draws 8,000
692159101137227776 2016-01-26 01:36:04 UTC <philnevergiveup> well @AJStylesOrg has been wrestling the best wrestlers in the world everywhere he has been. he has battled @RealKurtAngle for example
692158443017347072 2016-01-26 01:33:27 UTC <philnevergiveup> we forget it was 20 years ago that @Goldust captured his first @WWE #Intercontinental title against @SCOTTHALLNWO at #RoyalRumble96
692157270482948096 2016-01-26 01:28:47 UTC <philnevergiveup> so much doubt the @Broncos are getting let me remind you its 2016 not 2013-2014. its a different team, different playbook, different staff
692156830433333248 2016-01-26 01:27:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> it was no doubt a good move for @IMPACTWRESTLING to resign @JEFFHARDYBRAND i hope they bring in more talent to follow
692156443399712768 2016-01-26 01:25:30 UTC <philnevergiveup> its obvious the sports media has counted out the @Broncos already. well i guess the #Orangecrush2k15 will disappoint the media
692156114197155840 2016-01-26 01:24:11 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Ashylynwil its sick someone considers assault rifles their family.
692155614647156736 2016-01-26 01:22:12 UTC <philnevergiveup> @Ashylynwil chances are this person will accidentally shoot themselves or a family member. #Idiot

691876947618590720 2016-01-25 06:54:53 UTC <philnevergiveup> @AJStylesOrg has been wrestling the best wrestlers in the world his whole career from @ringofhonor to @IMPACTWRESTLING to @njpw1972

691870944059596801 2016-01-25 06:31:02 UTC <philnevergiveup> i hope people are aware this is a different @Broncos team than two years ago. if they can beat brady they can beat cam. i believe in them

689698477572362240 2016-01-19 06:38:25 UTC <philnevergiveup> @baseballhall thank you to the @Reds for inducting @PeteRose_14 to your #HallOfFame only if the @BaseballHall would do the same.
689695135429308417 2016-01-19 06:25:08 UTC <philnevergiveup> i think @onetoughnerd should resign or drink that tainted water he and his cronies were responsible for poisoning
689694477112385536 2016-01-19 06:22:31 UTC <philnevergiveup> @onetoughnerd should be forced to drink the the water he and his cronies poised
689694081698521089 2016-01-19 06:20:57 UTC <philnevergiveup> if @RealMikeBennett wants to be world champ he has to go through @MATTHARDYBRAND

689645408310591490 2016-01-19 03:07:32 UTC <philnevergiveup> while some had fears about #refugees #Republicans poised the water supply in #Michigan one more reason to #VoteBlue
689644409663533056 2016-01-19 03:03:34 UTC <philnevergiveup> if it was isis who poised a city's water supply it would be considered terrorism.
689644151130882048 2016-01-19 03:02:33 UTC <philnevergiveup> what lovely children #SarahPalin has. one arrested for domestic abuse and the other can't keep her legs closed.

689642438210691073 2016-01-19 02:55:44 UTC <philnevergiveup> so #SarahPalin endorses #Donaldtrump congrats this is proof that stupid people support him and that the #GOP is the party of stupid
