692201859159842816 2016-01-26 04:25:58 UTC <KayhanIrani> Gross.https://twitter.com/scroll_in/status/692201138884612101
692145031864520705 2016-01-26 00:40:09 UTC <KayhanIrani> @JohnLeguizamo  If art has global resonance shouldn't it reflect the majority of people living on the planet? POC are the global majority.
692095939771777024 2016-01-26 21:25:05 UTC <KayhanIrani> Why getting involved locally in arts & culture advocacy matters. Local pols can take our needs national.https://twitter.com/vj44/status/692094271793553410
692091234320523264 2016-01-26 21:06:23 UTC <KayhanIrani> @NatalieCrue @usartsdept My pleasure! 1 hour flew by. Who's organizing the live symposium?!!
692090632949620736 2016-01-26 21:03:59 UTC <KayhanIrani> @rexsoleil @POTUS This is what I call story strategy. How can we use story to make change - concretely!
692089693039632384 2016-01-26 21:00:15 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian Mother named me when we were in Iran. No idea revolution was coming. I've only used 1/2 my name for 35 yrs in US (Kayhandokht)
692089100279615488 2016-01-26 20:57:54 UTC <KayhanIrani> @NatalieCrue *being provocative* Why do we think change will come from on high? How could our story really effect change & who needs it?
692088393665232900 2016-01-26 20:55:06 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian That aesthetic informs all my writing. I can never understand Euro/American playwrights whose characters just spill their guts
692087984737402880 2016-01-26 20:53:28 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian *being a bit spicy*. Why do we think change will come from on high? How could our story really effect change & who needs it?
692086390734069760 2016-01-26 20:47:08 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian That's the beauty of story. It creates a way out of no way = a vision of the possible real = action & movement #CultureFix
692085513432502272 2016-01-26 20:43:39 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian Listening. If going beyond "transactional" story one must listen deeply to create understanding across barriers. #CultureFix
692084934597611520 2016-01-26 20:41:21 UTC <KayhanIrani> In representing yourself, your vision, to others you are constructing something. Power is embedded in your construction. #CultureFix
692083918128939009 2016-01-26 20:37:19 UTC <KayhanIrani> @rexsoleil @norarahimian Is storytelling only product? I think it's process too. Doesn't have to be a "performance". #CultureFix
692083201372725248 2016-01-26 20:34:28 UTC <KayhanIrani> I believe that something can be true but not real ... what about you? #CultureFix ... myth, legend, fable...https://twitter.com/norarahimian/status/692082040766738432
692082802595139584 2016-01-26 20:32:53 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian @rexsoleil I would ask: What's that person's role ... if they're not http://storyteller.How r they involved ?
692082060526260225 2016-01-26 20:29:56 UTC <KayhanIrani> We can also use multiple stories to line up our values: see what exists and see how it differs from what we value, what we want. #CultureFix
692080564606767104 2016-01-26 20:23:59 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian A1: Storytelling offers multiple ethical worlds we can engage with. Realities, Possibilities, Nuance, and Emotion. #CultureFix
692079228242780163 2016-01-26 20:18:40 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian (20f2) ... I noticed my classmates, no matter of friendship circles, wanted to perform and wanted to watch. They were engaged!
692079034302361600 2016-01-26 20:17:54 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian  (1of2) I wrote & performed a play in 4th grade abt a suffragette in an abusive relationship! I noticed ... #CultureFix
692078471774871554 2016-01-26 20:15:40 UTC <KayhanIrani> @norarahimian Same here! I lived in 3 countries, 2 continents by the time I was 3!
692078117289103360 2016-01-26 20:14:16 UTC <KayhanIrani> I then went on to write, perform, and use live performance as a site for connection, dialogue, and breaking barriers. #CultureFix
692077819594182656 2016-01-26 20:13:05 UTC <KayhanIrani> As a child, somehow I figured out that through role play and story, people would listen to each other. #CultureFIx
