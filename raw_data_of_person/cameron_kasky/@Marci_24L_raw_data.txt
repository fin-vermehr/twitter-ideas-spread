971700284824137728 2018-03-08 10:52:55 UTC <Marci_24L> @PressSec @MSNBC Overwhelmingly? Really?  Sounds a tad too reminiscent of the biggest crowd size ever.
971447027061153792 2018-03-07 18:06:34 UTC <Marci_24L> @indigomisha @TeaPainUSA Love when they deny crimes that are committed on videotape.
971446594171269123 2018-03-07 18:04:51 UTC <Marci_24L> @Neverabeliever @AgCI3Cu2 Thanks for the inside scoop Alanna!

971445034418692096 2018-03-07 17:58:39 UTC <Marci_24L> @HillaryClinton @Scotladywriter @Emolclause It was wrong when they did it to HRC and so I am glad they are not doing it now. Seriously, I dont need the #MSM to waste my time on Melania. She is the very least of our problems.
971443785040388096 2018-03-07 17:53:41 UTC <Marci_24L> @indigomisha @4everNeverTrump Consistency is also not one of his strong points.

969664540265902080 2018-03-02 20:03:36 UTC <Marci_24L> @acarlson623 @Amy_Siskind The story is the GOP not doing anything about his actions and inactions. That is the story.

969264118539669507 2018-03-01 17:32:28 UTC <Marci_24L> @stonecold2050 As they promote going after the mentally ill only to solve our gun problems clearly they should be first target. This can not be healthy, mentally or otherwise.

969005784054067200 2018-02-28 00:25:56 UTC <Marci_24L> @VirginiaVMW @DearAuntCrabby Oh the irony of gun proponents advocating for harsher gun laws directed at the mentally ill. On what planet can this be described as healthy, mentally or otherwise?
969000964320571392 2018-02-28 00:06:47 UTC <Marci_24L> @cmclymer Didnt treat Monica Lewinsky like an innocent lamb when she was a 24-year-old intern. Annihilated her into smithereens.
968998529887809536 2018-02-28 23:57:07 UTC <Marci_24L> @TeaScott1 @chrislhayes You are one of the few that seem to get it.  The try keep hanging on every word Trump utters as if they mean anything more than gibberish.
968992283432546304 2018-02-28 23:32:18 UTC <Marci_24L> @NewsJunkie60 @coton_luver The Sup Ct doesnt allow mandatory life sentences for teenage criminals because their brains are undeveloped until mid-20s. So they can buy guns w their undeveloped brains and then get out of the punishment because of their undeveloped brains. Makes all the sense in the world.
968990727278616577 2018-02-28 23:26:07 UTC <Marci_24L> @DaShanneStokes No. She probably finally needed her families warning that she was in dire legal peril sticking with Trump.

967084365292425216 2018-02-23 17:10:54 UTC <Marci_24L> @HoundDawgStudio @delaneytarr Vote. Vote. Vote. Get everyone you know to vote. DEMOCRATIC of course. Give money to candidates who need it and for efforts fighting gerrymandering and voter suppression.

967074590920003584 2018-02-23 16:32:04 UTC <Marci_24L> @lisagamcan @Lawrence Oh the irony.
967071880824934400 2018-02-23 16:21:18 UTC <Marci_24L> @realDonaldTrump And your precious NRA and gun manufacturers would profit handsomely from all the additional gun sales to the teachers and school personnel who would be too horrified to use them. Doesnt that work out nicely!
966844039692738560 2018-02-22 01:15:56 UTC <Marci_24L> @tedlieu I disagree with the premise that the kids lectured and ridiculed the Senator. My characterization is simply they were persistent in trying to get an answer to important questions.

966124383847833600 2018-02-20 01:36:17 UTC <Marci_24L> @realDonaldTrump Very sad FBI spending so much time investigating WH staffs background for security clearances. Perhaps if people like Jared hadnt changed his disclosure some 100 times, the FBI would be freed up for other more important things.

964858683409813505 2018-02-17 13:46:50 UTC <Marci_24L> @SpeakerRyan So why are you not holding Trump accountable for enforcing the sanctions Congress overwhelmingly voted for?  Dont you ever get tired of your own empty words?
964857499336822784 2018-02-17 13:42:08 UTC <Marci_24L> @realDonaldTrump Your presidency is entirely illegitimate.The Russians pushed you over the line with a mere 70,000 votes in 3 states while 3 million more voted for http://HRC.You did not earn your presidency. U do not belong in the WH. You are totally illegitimate. And you know it.

958759593894662144 2018-01-31 17:51:14 UTC <Marci_24L> @pattidavisaus And rich Black people get no respect from Trump either.
958759462592045056 2018-01-31 17:50:43 UTC <Marci_24L> @pattidavisaus That is true too.
958759334321762314 2018-01-31 17:50:12 UTC <Marci_24L> @thehill Trump want him back at DOJ?  Replacing Rid Rosenstein perhaps???
958758743784787968 2018-01-31 17:47:52 UTC <Marci_24L> @thehill I am guessing there is more to this story ......
958757833901830146 2018-01-31 17:44:15 UTC <Marci_24L> @mkraju And I am guessing there is far more to this story.
958757213178400769 2018-01-31 17:41:47 UTC <Marci_24L> @pattidavisaus Well many of the whore people killed in Germany had plenty of money.  Was racism. They saw the Jews as a race.
958756740425814016 2018-01-31 17:39:54 UTC <Marci_24L> @TGowdySC @KKENNEY395 I am thinking there is more to this story.
958728017571958786 2018-01-31 15:45:46 UTC <Marci_24L> @davidfrum Surprised these frivolous matters appeal to you.
958659128896860160 2018-01-31 11:12:02 UTC <Marci_24L> @treasonstickers Read me some Fire and Fury
958658533305839616 2018-01-31 11:09:40 UTC <Marci_24L> @JamilSmith @BrentNYT Totally agree.
958532215947907075 2018-01-30 02:47:43 UTC <Marci_24L> @glover_ceo @kumailn Reading me some Fire and Fury instead.
958531972929933313 2018-01-30 02:46:45 UTC <Marci_24L> @ELLIEMAE239 @jonfavs I am reading me some Fire and Fury instead of enduring the treat.
958519254890045440 2018-01-30 01:56:13 UTC <Marci_24L> Think Ill read me some Fire and Fury during the SOTU address.
958399182703857667 2018-01-30 17:59:06 UTC <Marci_24L> @RepAdamSchiff @VThePR @tedlieu Release it Rep. Lieu. Just do it. There dont seem to be consequences for anything anymore.
958398235818774528 2018-01-30 17:55:20 UTC <Marci_24L> @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Because he is totally corrupt.
958398026074206208 2018-01-30 17:54:30 UTC <Marci_24L> @RepAdamSchiff @CeleryCaraway @mitchellreports This could possibly be the biggest understatement made. No you cannot run an investigation with the goal of protecting its target.  To. Say. The. Least.
958396449871613952 2018-01-30 17:48:14 UTC <Marci_24L> @Mean_Adam @chillibeanboy @wesley_jordan @OleVetUSAF @KottiPillar @StephH_AZ @MadelyneRants @B52Malmet @jacksnowknows @realDonaldTrump @GOP @Chipshotz1 @OliviaResists Because they are totally corrupt.
958395932550328321 2018-01-30 17:46:11 UTC <Marci_24L> @JMad414 @waltshaub Their inaction speaks volumes. Sadly, they are going to.
958395542140276736 2018-01-30 17:44:38 UTC <Marci_24L> @PreetBharara Their inaction is speaking loud and clear. They are not going to.
958345669084876800 2018-01-30 14:26:27 UTC <Marci_24L> And this is but a few examples out of hundreds more.https://twitter.com/brianklaas/status/958309633919242241

958187738779541504 2018-01-29 03:58:53 UTC <Marci_24L> @Kotick4Congress @DanaRohrabacher @Miduswell @LovUniverse Make sure you bring a friend!  How about a few. :).
958186623614767104 2018-01-29 03:54:27 UTC <Marci_24L> @DRUMR48 @chrislhayes If GOP truly wanted to protect Mueller  would have to do so now. After Rosenstein is fired is too late.  Their non-actions speak volumes. #complicit.
958185520064065536 2018-01-29 03:50:04 UTC <Marci_24L> Hell land on his feet for sure. But these career guys this is what they live and breathe for. I feel so bad for him.

957815398061215746 2018-01-28 03:19:20 UTC <Marci_24L> @liftdoryup2 @RWPUSA Professor I think the dignified train left the station long ago.
957457598902566913 2018-01-27 03:37:34 UTC <Marci_24L> @menjicm @danpfeiffer Because shameless hypocrisy.
