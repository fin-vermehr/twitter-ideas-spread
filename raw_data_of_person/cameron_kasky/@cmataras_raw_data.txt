969262362753724416 2018-03-01 17:25:29 UTC <cmataras> Unfortunately, a teacher can have a breakdown too. Introducing guns into the school will only cause more problems because the weapons will now be readily available.https://twitter.com/_omg_chondi_/status/968911408544010241

966898972160749569 2018-02-22 04:54:13 UTC <cmataras> @kurteichenwald Even an experienced Broward County sheriff with a handgun didnt want to confront the shooter who had an AR-15! They want underpaid teachers to do it? I guess they feel the teachers would jump at the bonus and who cares what happens - theyre expendable.

785465059082379264 2016-10-10 13:00:37 UTC <cmataras> Trump's constantly looming behind Clinton was definitely done to intimidate, especially because she could hear the TicTac's in his pocket.
