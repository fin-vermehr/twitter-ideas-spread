877442844948148224 2017-06-21 08:27:30 UTC <HutsLihuts> Hard #Brexit = death wish. Soft #Brexit = a lot like before but with NO vote or veto. Both worse than now. So my conclusion is #NoBrexit.

869314834676023296 2017-05-29 22:09:42 UTC <HutsLihuts> Probably not intended but by asking JC those typical rightwing press questions he was finally given the chance to present his real position.https://twitter.com/tartanlady2/status/869260512453898242

866760278188449792 2017-05-22 20:58:48 UTC <HutsLihuts> @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn @ilesjazz Exactly, JC never crumbled despite nonstop attack by the Tories+the press. If anyone can negotiate our Brexit, it's calm and steady Corbyn.

752484900331261952 2016-07-11 12:49:15 UTC <HutsLihuts> So, can any CLP launch a vote of non-confidence, like #AngelaEagle 's threatens to do? That could be a way out of this stalemate in the PLP.

692444645243092992 2016-01-27 20:30:43 UTC <HutsLihuts> Oh nice language and behaviour @DamianSomebody, just the sort of supporter I expect from #lucyallan - sure she is thrilled by your backing.
692443050384166912 2016-01-27 20:24:22 UTC <HutsLihuts> I disagree, there is nobody here who has my interests at heart better. I am supporting Corbyn, and so are many. @theredandblue @jeremycorbyn

692328688780754944 2016-01-27 12:49:56 UTC <HutsLihuts> I hope that is #Corbyn, not Coprbyn @PHAPolitical !
692328314283884544 2016-01-27 12:48:27 UTC <HutsLihuts> It wasn't right but that is no argument to justify it now, is it? Change needed, badly. @theredandblue @jeremycorbyn
692326994932023296 2016-01-27 12:43:13 UTC <HutsLihuts> This complaint is by Neil Phillips, not myself, I re-tweet it to support his case. #SackLucyAllan

692287558705897472 2016-01-27 10:06:30 UTC <HutsLihuts> I have never been tolerant of dumbness @jamesastro999, and never said that I was. Your platitudes lack substance, and I will move on now.
692089607857512448 2016-01-26 20:59:55 UTC <HutsLihuts> I think most of them are not bad, just dumb @jamesastro999. Conditioned by the right-wing press which is owned by billionaire foreigners.
691994913936900096 2016-01-26 14:43:38 UTC <HutsLihuts> Yes it is @jamesastro999 and you know it. I support Corbyn's politics and you just confirm my opinion that the Tories are nasty+bad for us.
691991168406704128 2016-01-26 14:28:45 UTC <HutsLihuts> Jeremy Corbyn could shift the refugee debate  if hes not blown up first. Try and you will have to fight all of us. https://shar.es/1hlqao

691728089177575426 2016-01-25 21:03:22 UTC <HutsLihuts> They are, and supposed to be accountable to us, their constituents. But they don't seem to think they are. #Unfit https://twitter.com/_i0n/status/691717570852982784
691726382649450496 2016-01-25 20:56:35 UTC <HutsLihuts> Blaming @jeremycorbyn without admitting your own part in it, either you're hopelessly naive @RachelReevesMP, or you intend to damage Labour.
691722227918749697 2016-01-25 20:40:05 UTC <HutsLihuts> You are not doing #lucyallan any favours @jamesastro999, you are just confirming that Tories use primitive smear tactics and blatant lies.
691621652136878080 2016-01-25 14:00:26 UTC <HutsLihuts> Your job is to represent and serve the public #lucyallan - how come you need protection from it? You are the wrong person for this job!!
691620659328335873 2016-01-25 13:56:29 UTC <HutsLihuts> You are describing your own actions #lucyallan. @BBCShropshire
691610906858491904 2016-01-25 13:17:44 UTC <HutsLihuts> You abused your position+provoked justified criticism, then started accusing, blocking+attacking your critics #lucyallan. Spiralling down.
691607119632715776 2016-01-25 13:02:41 UTC <HutsLihuts> And once again poor #lucyallan is the victim. It's never your fault, is it, it's always the others who are to blame. #SackLucyAllan #Unfit
691601516612947968 2016-01-25 12:40:25 UTC <HutsLihuts> The public needs to know when ministers meet media chiefs and what they talk about.   http://gu.com/p/4g5x3/stw

691368344885280773 2016-01-24 21:13:53 UTC <HutsLihuts> The cute thing is that @Cosmopeleton really believes this. Aww, good for him! Off now to demand more answers+drum up change. @janeymachine

691355363396960256 2016-01-24 20:22:18 UTC <HutsLihuts> Am I the only one who thinks it's hilarious that a Tory asks the press "that false allegations weren't put as if they were fact"? #LucyAllan
691341774053314560 2016-01-24 19:28:18 UTC <HutsLihuts> Like the Tories move on from every wrong they do? Boring, maybe - but frankly, your entertainment is last of my concerns.@stemc82 #lucyallan
691336163890696192 2016-01-24 19:06:00 UTC <HutsLihuts> Bring it on, long overdue! #SackLucyAllan #BBCShropshire #LucyAllan #UnfitForOfficehttps://twitter.com/theonlywayisup/status/691320483971743744

691010933112598528 2016-01-23 21:33:39 UTC <HutsLihuts> So #LucyAllan has been censoring opinion on her tweets by blocking Twitter users in large numbers. So much for transparency. #SackLucyAllan
691005831308034048 2016-01-23 21:13:23 UTC <HutsLihuts> Don't be disappointed @LeeJProudfoot, you hit a nerve! You will still see all she says re-tweeted +we will still see all you say. #lucyallan
691003525917204485 2016-01-23 21:04:13 UTC <HutsLihuts> Don't know about you @yorksfella59 but getting blocked by #LucyAllan made me proud+now I REALLY want to make my voice heard! #SackLucyAllan
691002771739283456 2016-01-23 21:01:13 UTC <HutsLihuts> Yes I was actually pleased, too. A bit like the attacks against Corbyn - worn with pride! @susan_250 #lucyallan #NotSilenced #SackLucyAllan
690997816676737024 2016-01-23 20:41:32 UTC <HutsLihuts> Quite. And now she doesn't even know what she's dealing with. Personally, I would prefer to know. But I'm not #LucyAllan. @TT_Dee @lucyallan
690996934107070468 2016-01-23 20:38:01 UTC <HutsLihuts> Yes, it's really not hard to add a hash tag @anon5a2z, I was just wondering if #LucyAllan knows that, too!  #NotSilenced #SackLucyAllan
690995507880140801 2016-01-23 20:32:21 UTC <HutsLihuts> Haha, she blocked me too. But she knows that others can still see our tweets, right? Right?? @anon5a2z @lucyallan #TruthHurts #SackLucyAllan
690633791338123265 2016-01-22 20:35:01 UTC <HutsLihuts> Yes, we absolutely want to hear her replies to your questions, ever heard of accountability @lucyallan? @GallacherJoanne @kingprawn1
690632621496373249 2016-01-22 20:30:22 UTC <HutsLihuts> Very funny coming from @lucyallan, queen of Twitter hysterics and Social Media loose canon, can't wait for next instalment! @GallacherJoanne
690625260870303744 2016-01-22 20:01:08 UTC <HutsLihuts> MPs can not do their job if they have a personal interest in the outcome of a piece of legislation due to any financial bonds. @UKParliament
690623750933516290 2016-01-22 19:55:08 UTC <HutsLihuts> Are you as disgusted by the conduct of MPs as I am, and many others? Here's a chance to make our opinion heard.https://twitter.com/UKParliament/status/690546930150162437
690552261613895680 2016-01-22 15:11:03 UTC <HutsLihuts> Indeed, she responded "yes" to all the above. @litterpickerv1 @lucyallan
690546511185350656 2016-01-22 14:48:12 UTC <HutsLihuts> People want their MP to get on with the job, not spending time inventing slurs, bullying staff +evading scrutiny @lucyallan!  @Telfordlabour

689916542058913793 2016-01-20 21:04:56 UTC <HutsLihuts> You can't pay your way out of this @lucyallan - you have lost all credibility. Not representing us, you are #UnfitForOffice. #SackLucyAllan
689911700741603332 2016-01-20 20:45:42 UTC <HutsLihuts> Not what I saw @RogOnTheLeft - the PM has no answers. Just contempt for students, doctors, nurses, flood victims, veterans -the list goes on
689910850606534657 2016-01-20 20:42:19 UTC <HutsLihuts> You, our PM, are incapable of taking care of this country+ you can't even answer our questions @David_Cameron #pmqshttps://twitter.com/CockertonMark/status/689909120539979777
