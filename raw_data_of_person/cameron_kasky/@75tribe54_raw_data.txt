971780888961761280 2018-03-08 16:13:13 UTC <75tribe54> @EAHelp Why am I getting a message on Battlefront 2 saying my EA account is restricted from any online features? And I can't even contact support because its down? Unacceptable, by any chiming providing a service I paid for.
966763566153027584 2018-02-22 19:56:10 UTC <75tribe54> @dugan_tweets @Reflog_18 Had that happen to me, they sold it to one on Parsons, they gave it all back without charge.

964205368170524672 2018-02-15 18:30:48 UTC <75tribe54> @marcorubio how do you sleep at night knowing what a vile, evil pos you are at heart?
964181381613015040 2018-02-15 16:55:29 UTC <75tribe54> @michaelianblack @AaronCarden @Cheezhed13 @KirbyDeaniels Maybe because Indiana has like zero gun control laws, so you can just drive to Gary and buy guns then go back to Chicago and kill people. But let's not let facts get in the way of your strawman argument.

960314774448951296 2018-02-04 00:50:58 UTC <75tribe54> How the fuck are flagging the Eagles for chincy shit after that no flag on the interception. The reason he had to try for a one handed catch is because the bitch Pats DB was holding the other one. #NFLCheatsforthePats #SuperBowlLII
959136646020108288 2018-02-01 18:49:30 UTC <75tribe54> @CLETalkingHeads Kirk Cousins, 2-11 against teams above .500 in his career. Not a fluke season, but his career. NOT A FRANCHISE GUY.
958683592267304961 2018-01-31 12:49:14 UTC <75tribe54> @Ryan_McCrystal @Tom_Flies Cousins is 2-11 in his career against teams with winning records. Average QB. Get off Kirk's nuts.
958489840936456192 2018-01-30 23:59:20 UTC <75tribe54> @pnehlen Sorry about your baby dick Paul. Perhaps drinking antifreeze will help that.
956313539173642242 2018-01-24 23:51:29 UTC <75tribe54> Big congrats to Big Jim Thome, one of my all-time favorite Tribe players. #HallOfFame #Tribe #Indians
956009992674512896 2018-01-23 03:45:18 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ Didn't Sean Taylor and Eric Turner go that high? Ed Reed? The list of high impact, high drafted safeties is substantial. BPA all day in the draft.
955439750072107008 2018-01-22 13:59:22 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump You're a fucking liar who should be tried and executed for treason. #TrumpShutdown.

949142736971558912 2018-01-04 04:57:17 UTC <75tribe54> @aincristi Cousins is 2-11 against teams with winning records, don't get sucked into the Kirk hype, he's not worth the money he'll want.
949071907650981889 2018-01-04 00:15:50 UTC <75tribe54> @OptimumScouting I think the Browns should go Fitzpatrick at 4 and really set up the defensive backfield.
949067931723411456 2018-01-04 00:00:02 UTC <75tribe54> @PumpkinNation Cousins is 2-11 against teams with a winning record. Stop with this Kirk love affair,  it's retarded.

947971451356934144 2018-01-01 23:23:01 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi Steve Young is Tony. Do some research, like actual research. You really sound ignorant of the modern sport here
947880309772685315 2018-01-01 17:20:51 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I keep saying one of the biggest black marks on the Browns is the local media. They constantly shit on all the players and wonder why people don't want to play here. They are as big, if not a bigger, embarrassment than the organization's leadership.
947867521339854853 2018-01-01 16:30:02 UTC <75tribe54> @DougLesmerises Thank you Doug for being the only member of the local beat that's worthwhile instead of a bitter has been. Most of your contemporaries are a big reason players don't want to come play here.

947575249066975237 2017-12-31 21:08:39 UTC <75tribe54> Corey Coleman is a historic bust, he is not talent. All you Sashi nut-huggers bask in your wrongness. He's shit, not even a 3rd round receiver and they took this POS first off the board.
947574417487429632 2017-12-31 21:05:20 UTC <75tribe54> You know what is the worst thing about the Browns? The local media. You bitter old fucks just bag on every player that comes here, you're the reasons people don't want to be here.

If you were smarter than an empty mayonnaise jar, you would know that. But since you're an under developed fetus that should have been aborted, you don't.
944298993961590785 2017-12-22 20:09:59 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi He's gotta go Tony. I think it's inevitable now, they can't keep him without a player revolt soon.

939957354837061632 2017-12-10 20:37:51 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ Hater glasses
939957006194167808 2017-12-10 20:36:28 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ Where only he could get it. Good placement.
939956681064288256 2017-12-10 20:35:10 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ It was toward the sideline, DeValve worked back to the ball.
939956165324177415 2017-12-10 20:33:08 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ That was good ball placement man, c'mon. He's at 74% completion today. Give the man props when they're due.
939941274492252162 2017-12-10 19:33:57 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ That's eerily accurate.. That's when he made the Madden cover.
939934657528893442 2017-12-10 19:07:40 UTC <75tribe54> Kizer looks like a pro QB so far today. #Browns
939930227236581377 2017-12-10 18:50:03 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR Adams shoving the official had nothing to do with the Browns players though. That's a cut and dry rule of you make contact with the official.
939929426938269697 2017-12-10 18:46:53 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR That's not benefit of the doubt, that's bias.
939929275737804801 2017-12-10 18:46:17 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ I still want to know why there was no flag for Adams shoving the official.
939929022682812416 2017-12-10 18:45:16 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR What about Adams shoving the official? Should've been offsetting penalties.
939928656905981954 2017-12-10 18:43:49 UTC <75tribe54> @MaryKayCabot What about Adams shoving the official. Should've been offsetting penalties.
939921856261447685 2017-12-10 18:16:48 UTC <75tribe54> What do you know, the coaching staff  still sucks #Browns
939544815422844928 2017-12-09 17:18:34 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Let's not forget his durability issues as well
938877099103965185 2017-12-07 21:05:18 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeSilver Well since he got picked at 2 aren't you really arguing semantics?
938876140193767426 2017-12-07 21:01:29 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeSilver about football and other issues, but your blind support of Hue is taxing.
938876014310100992 2017-12-07 21:00:59 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeSilver So when your "quarterback guru" says he doesn't want him you shouldn't listen to him? And great leadership abilities by throwing his players under the bus with the whole offense want good enough for an OC. His offense by the way. Mike I like your writing
938874753410129920 2017-12-07 20:55:59 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ He also said Hue loved Wentz which has been widely and demonstrably proven false. Even by his personal press agent Silver.
938868143065370624 2017-12-07 20:29:43 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @wltyrrell2 Hue didn't want those QBs and your putting that on Sashi. Sashi has put together a top 10 defensive front, to say he didn't get talent is misinformation.
938867088562769920 2017-12-07 20:25:31 UTC <75tribe54> @wltyrrell2 @CLEsportsTalk This is the worst take on this.. lots of misinformation and just making excuses for Hue. Trash article.
938865528411652096 2017-12-07 20:19:19 UTC <75tribe54> @DougLesmerises Thank you for trying to take him to task in that presser. The only person who asked him those needed questions.
938846159975735296 2017-12-07 19:02:22 UTC <75tribe54> @PumpkinNation Yeah, what a leader. Throwing his players under the bus. Didn't want to hire an OC because he was afraid that the offense, his offense, would be to bad and he'd have to fire him. I have zero respect for this charlatan.
938838202084761601 2017-12-07 18:30:44 UTC <75tribe54> @MunchCleveland Hue is the architect of 1-27. Stop giving the worst coach in the NFL a pass.
938812593665466374 2017-12-07 16:48:59 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeSilver I'm not sure using the Haslems to prove your point is that smart.
938803489794379776 2017-12-07 16:12:48 UTC <75tribe54> @judsonbates @PumpkinNation @JdhartJh Actually Hue didn't want them, but ok whatever.
938795233667616769 2017-12-07 15:40:00 UTC <75tribe54> @diannaESPN @AdamSchefter @CleSportsfan10 Like Jamie Collins? Duke? Njoku? Taylor? Ogenjobi? Etc. Please, the implementation of the Tashkent is what is lacking. You're a moron.
938794381636722689 2017-12-07 15:36:37 UTC <75tribe54> @diannaESPN @AdamSchefter @CleSportsfan10 No. Should've been Hue. He's the real problem.
938216380859547648 2017-12-05 01:19:51 UTC <75tribe54> @SI_PeterKing @RealDavidIsrael @LesaneCrooks6 A 4 game suspension is the rest of the year.
938177602333888512 2017-12-05 22:45:45 UTC <75tribe54> @ChrisFedor @KevinGillman @birdiepls I'm torn better Mayfield or Rosen.
938172010479439872 2017-12-05 22:23:32 UTC <75tribe54> @ChrisFedor @KevinGillman @birdiepls Do I think he's a franchise guy. No, especially not right now. But I think Hue had done a lot of danage to him so far. As well as ruin the culture in  Berea. Get rid of Hue and get a young new school mind in there and watch the turn around. I never liked the Hue hire.
938170050305019904 2017-12-05 22:15:45 UTC <75tribe54> @ChrisFedor @KevinGillman @birdiepls Good thing your an NFL talent evaluator then.
938167557063958528 2017-12-05 22:05:50 UTC <75tribe54> @ChrisFedor @KevinGillman @birdiepls Kizer was in consideration for the No1 pick going into his last season. Saying he's never been good is just plain ignorance.
937863238909341697 2017-12-04 01:56:35 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I think Rosen may have more overall potential, but his commitment to football is a question. Mayfield has some Aaron Rodgers qualities as far as intangibles that can't be ignored.
937858114778468352 2017-12-04 01:36:13 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN So you got me looking at Mayfield film, and I have to say that my previous Manziel comparisons were way off. Good accuracy to all fields, the Wilson comparisons are more accurate. I think he throws a better deep ball than Russell. Kinda getting behind him No.1
937448706512703488 2017-12-03 22:29:23 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi Jesus dude, just quit this job. Its like you've had a stoke every time you tweet. Clearly no hold, just like the touchdown earlier. Are you really still sore they got you fired from the Plain Dealer? Maybe go to another city, huh.
937446265373315072 2017-12-03 22:19:41 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Kizer made 2 franchise throws in that drive. It's amazing what happens when the WR can hold onto the ball. Njoku continues to prove to be a huge playmaker.
937445793589596161 2017-12-03 22:17:48 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi You spelled touchdown wrong Tony. Another great take there Ace.
937410205779820544 2017-12-03 19:56:23 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump How big of a narcissistic sociopath do you have to be to not understand EVERYONE knows you're full of shit? That or you have the mental capacity of an empty mayonnaise jar. Everyone knows all you do is lie, everyone knows you have a micro baby penis. Mr Overcompensation.
937142375587237888 2017-12-02 02:12:08 UTC <75tribe54> @DawgsByNature @chadp71 @Maverik877 @kevinlockett Like the fact he puked on himself and ran from police after a DUI stop? That doesn't seem like a lazy narrative, but a fact that backs it up.
935961242078011392 2017-11-29 19:58:44 UTC <75tribe54> @craigkarmazin @HammerNation19 Peppers should sue your dumb ass for slander. Get out of town.

934987455450832896 2017-11-26 03:29:15 UTC <75tribe54> @DawgsByNature Um, that was like 3 front offices ago. Analytics had nothing to do with that. Joe Banner did that.
934985878266662912 2017-11-26 03:22:59 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I just can't with local Cleveland Browns reporters anymore.
934971657441202176 2017-11-26 02:26:28 UTC <75tribe54> @ClayTravis @KirkHerbstreit @SpencerLeone @BGregory615 Where was your moral outrage when Manning sexually assaulted a female trainer?
934960977770172416 2017-11-26 01:44:02 UTC <75tribe54> Hey @KirkHerbstreit, you remember all those campus protests at Tennessee when Peyton sexually assaulted that female trainer? Yeah, me either.
934951462467186689 2017-11-26 01:06:13 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl 
934947390813102080 2017-11-26 00:50:03 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi @ESPNCleveland No one should every pay one red cent for Grossi's mindless drivel.
934946959437238273 2017-11-26 00:48:20 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl That's like when you were complaining about the strike zone against the Yankees. If they swing the umps calls don't matter. See how ridiculous that sounds.
934946462433243140 2017-11-26 00:46:21 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl Doesn't change the fact that the call impacted the outcome of the game. Trying to bury the team and not recognize outside influences is wrong.
934930577190473729 2017-11-26 23:43:14 UTC <75tribe54> As usual Tony, you're very wrong. Of course you want then to stay at the bottom since your only claim is being the "General" (so laughable) in your self contrived #100yearswarhttps://twitter.com/TonyGrossi/status/934929395927707648
934929051864707073 2017-11-26 23:37:10 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Except of course for the clear video evidence showing first contact made by shoulder. But then again Grossi is a vapid moron.
934928421217619968 2017-11-26 23:34:40 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN @Browns_SZN And Ruiter blocked me after this tweet.
934924779299188737 2017-11-26 23:20:12 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN @Browns_SZN Tied with Grossi. They're both the worst.
934888299281477634 2017-11-26 20:55:14 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ Both Darrell and Grossi are the worst "journalists" I've ever seen. Both should be run out of town.
934887592386093057 2017-11-26 20:52:26 UTC <75tribe54> @ClvlndK8 The call changes the outcome. They have to punt with us down by one score without that bullshit. Quit excusing the league bias against Cleveland.
934886610818256898 2017-11-26 20:48:32 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi You're a worthless fuck Grossi. You deserve to be unemployed, even by shitty ESPN Cleveland. Delete your existence.
934885752508485632 2017-11-26 20:45:07 UTC <75tribe54> @_PeteSmith_ The NFL will never let the Cleveland franchise succeed because of them losing the lawsuit to the city. It's proven by biased officiating and questionable league decisions for the franchise. Fuck the NFL and their shady bullshit. I hope it implodes on itself anymore.
934878211485372417 2017-11-26 20:15:09 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi He only got one foot down, but of course no challenge by Hue the buffoon.
934877571321417729 2017-11-26 20:12:36 UTC <75tribe54> These officials with more bullshit penalties against Cleveland. The NFL will never let the Browns succeed because the city win their lawsuit against the league. #CLEvsCIN
934536871857836032 2017-11-25 21:38:47 UTC <75tribe54> How is that not offensive pass interference against Alabama. That's bullshit.
934228836509798401 2017-11-24 01:14:46 UTC <75tribe54> @Ronnie2K I'm not getting any double xp
933852090140708864 2017-11-23 00:17:43 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump Michael Flynn is testifying against you. Prepare for prison traitor.
933059744432082949 2017-11-21 19:49:13 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi @chadp71 He came off the board as soon as he tried to run from the cops at his DUI stop. If that doesn't cry Maziel, then you can't see the forest for the trees.
933059214506909696 2017-11-21 19:47:06 UTC <75tribe54> @PFWeekly @chrishenrywic @Browns_SZN Careful, Broncos fans get real butt hurt if you speak ill of their horse tooth Jesus.
933058183421157376 2017-11-21 19:43:00 UTC <75tribe54> @hoynsie They're already in there
933057862745624576 2017-11-21 19:41:44 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN That fake field goal though........
932807714350256129 2017-11-20 03:07:44 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I said the same thing and everyone was like, "He won a Super Bowl". He's been terrible since lucking into Von Miller.
932797514805366784 2017-11-20 02:27:12 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN They do title it the "Absurd Question of the Week", so there's that.
932374531599159296 2017-11-19 22:26:25 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN At least Kizer isn't Petterman. Talk about fireable offense benching Taylor for that dumpster fire.
932374069781127168 2017-11-19 22:24:35 UTC <75tribe54> @ZacWassink @KenCarman At least Kizer isn't Petterman

931748308242108416 2017-11-17 04:58:02 UTC <75tribe54> @BruhReport @_ATLPhil @juslaxed_ Kyrie played in only 2 games of ECF with a different injury.
931360139868884992 2017-11-16 03:15:35 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump What about the rape accusation against you against a 13 year old there Donny boy? You know the one you sent people to threaten.
931006220600782848 2017-11-15 03:49:14 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman Everyone stop with the "Elway didn't have experience" crap. Their roster is s pretty big mess right now because if his inability to draft a QB. He threw money at a HOF QB, he's a shit talent evaluator.
931005569414193153 2017-11-15 03:46:39 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman @Vince_Magestro Elway has drafted horribly, that's why they are tumbling toward a last place tie in their division with the freaking Chargers. Throwing money at a HOF QB doesn't make you a good talent evaluator.
931004811574734848 2017-11-15 03:43:38 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman @justG_baby And the Broncos are trash because of the QBs Elway drafted.
931004515607810048 2017-11-15 03:42:28 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman @tmaloy68 And the QBs Elway has drafted are horrible
930146572012318720 2017-11-13 18:53:18 UTC <75tribe54> @WillBurge @SteelValleyMatt Lol
930146149117329408 2017-11-13 18:51:37 UTC <75tribe54> @WillBurge @SteelValleyMatt Smells more like Hue's death knell.
929893321991958529 2017-11-12 02:06:59 UTC <75tribe54> @ClvlndK8 Gabriel would not be the same here. Look at Jamar Taylor, bust in Miami, works here. Different teams, different systems. Plus, he's not even all that in Atlanta, just one bell and whistle on the machine that already exists.
929818326263652353 2017-11-12 21:08:58 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman That's a completely horrible take. He played a hell of a game.
929811045287329793 2017-11-12 20:40:02 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN They're actually outside the top 10 in scoring at 23 points a game. Wilson had the most yards, but his rating is under a hundred.
929807413703831558 2017-11-12 20:25:37 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Kizer was considered for the top pick at the beginning of that year. Goff looked horrible, and wildly inaccurate last year.
929807117481070592 2017-11-12 20:24:26 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN My argument against Russell is without an elite back, the offense has become very average.
929806499131641856 2017-11-12 20:21:59 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Look at the difference between this year and last for Goff for example.
929806372308385792 2017-11-12 20:21:28 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN To be devil's advocate here, but Flacco isn't elite and they won. Russell Wilson isn't elite really. I think Kizer can be a franchise. He's got the size, the arm, the tools are there. Better coaching for development could be the difference.
929804648210489345 2017-11-12 20:14:37 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN The offensive coaches didn't help him at all. I'd rather have Saquan at the top and a free safety.
929803542214430720 2017-11-12 20:10:14 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN The way Kizer has progressed and played this game, do they take a QB number 1?
929801246487302144 2017-11-12 20:01:06 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN pic.twitter.com/N4YR4ECCYU
929795169934893056 2017-11-12 19:36:57 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I can't see how he's not fired at halftime after that stupid fucking pee wee league play call. Are fucking kidding me?
929561757198188544 2017-11-11 04:09:27 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I just have a real bad feeling about him.
929559027343818752 2017-11-11 03:58:37 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Same exact thing they said about Johnny. Kids got the same bullshit attitude about him. I want him nowhere near the Browns. He's a perfect opportunity to have it blow up in their faces.
929557764640305153 2017-11-11 03:53:36 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN No. He's going to be completely exposed aft the next level. Which means they'll probably draft him and he'll make Ryan Leif look Luke a HOFer.
928636857356816384 2017-11-09 14:54:14 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Joe blocked me a while ago for saying the same thing.
928630355988500483 2017-11-09 14:28:24 UTC <75tribe54> @AdamSchefter @texasbruin67 Not slowly, quickly. And starting to surpass then in ineptitude and ownership gaffes.
928458714704695296 2017-11-08 03:06:22 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi They cut off the interview after you ambushed him with the question Grossi. Try facts from now on instead of your constant drivel that always turns out wrong. You're a bigger home around the country than the current Browns regime.
928059812444823552 2017-11-07 00:41:16 UTC <75tribe54> 280 characters? Right after being let out of Twitter jail? Hmmm, let the rants begin.
927641794925522944 2017-11-06 21:00:13 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN @AllbrightNFL You spelled Maziel part 2 wrong. He's the same type of smarmy white bred POS as Johnny Football. He can fuck up someone else's team.
926891251605164032 2017-11-04 19:17:49 UTC <75tribe54> @GVartwork @TheRealSlamtana I hope you are able to stay in #TheLand, been watching you play since the Clippers. Love the way you play ball. #Slamtana
926116428784259075 2017-11-02 15:58:57 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Yes, that's kinda my point too. I think this full analytical approach is flawed and causes bad picks. Hence the need for a football ops guy. What if Hue brings in a  OC?
926114665284997120 2017-11-02 15:51:57 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Very true, the Rams and Bills are further examples of success, but they also have football guys in charge of the FO, yes?
926114381225709568 2017-11-02 15:50:49 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Not having one isn't working that positive
926113930455470080 2017-11-02 15:49:02 UTC <75tribe54> @egoldie80 @Be_Led_ Lol, like all those white people loitering around Vegas after the white guy shot hundreds of people? Wearing their jeans and shirts seeding messages?
926111985363767296 2017-11-02 15:41:18 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I still think they need a true football guy as team president or football ops
926108206610427904 2017-11-02 15:26:17 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN It just feels like Jimmy is tied closer to Hue than the FO guys. I think he's really pushing Peyton to come and be president and run football ops.
926107151709429766 2017-11-02 15:22:05 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN They're all under contract. Why would a guy take a job if he can't pick his own coaches? It seems more convoluted that way.
926103717958516738 2017-11-02 15:08:27 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Real question. If they do sack Hue, that pretty much also costs Greg Williams. Then what?
926100951932571648 2017-11-02 14:57:27 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN He's done jack shit. One year? Try again, he's been in that front office for years contributing to being shitty. The OLine can't protect or run block, your "great young D" gives up 30 points a game and can't generate pressure or turnovers. Numbers don't lie, they say you're dumb
926098301958619136 2017-11-02 14:46:55 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN The OLine is shit,  the defense can't stop any passes. Get some glasses and check yourself for brain damage. You're dumber than Grossi and Rueter combined.
926096497149538304 2017-11-02 14:39:45 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Worst roster in the HISTORY of the NFL and Hue is inept? GTFO you're delusional.
926092925267783683 2017-11-02 14:25:34 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Face it, your boy is inept and on the way out the door. He's built the worst team in the history of the NFL. Depodesta doesn't even leave San Diego anymore. They're garbage.
926092125233729536 2017-11-02 14:22:23 UTC <75tribe54> @MaryKayCabot Who gives a shit. Their stats and success in other teams with WAY more talent does not equate to what they would've been here with this joke of s roster. You're comparing apples to a bag of dog shit. STOP.
926089402362793984 2017-11-02 14:11:34 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN And it's probably gonna be your front office boys going for sabotaging a trade that Jimmy told them to do for Hue.
926088624524943360 2017-11-02 14:08:28 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN No one is fired until after the season, then heads are going to roll. Do you actually read the articles, or just slap the headlines in your timeline to make snarky comments?
926078370315755520 2017-11-02 13:27:43 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN It's been confirmed by multiple outlets, so go ahead and doubt all you want from SoCal.
925676594273898501 2017-11-01 10:51:12 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeAndMike Please stop with the Browns false narrative about the trade, no they didn't lose out because they were celebrating. The Bengals screwed up the paperwork. ESPN is the only source that says it was the Browns.
925515308873453569 2017-10-31 00:10:19 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl Not true in any way. The Bungles screwed up the paperwork.
925514216244699136 2017-10-31 00:05:59 UTC <75tribe54> @mlombardiNFL Oh look, Lombardi the joke is wrong again. With dumbass LaConfora the bullshiter right with him. You both need new careers because you're worse at your jobs than the Browns are as a franchise.
925511759338835969 2017-10-31 23:56:13 UTC <75tribe54> @AdamSchefter Weird, because other sources say it was the Bengals who messed it up.
925351194343636992 2017-10-31 13:18:11 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Here's a list of all the QBs with winning records that Billicheck has let walk from the Pats........... ....................Bledsoe.
925348985539350528 2017-10-31 13:09:24 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump Hey Donnie Deflector, you think your orange will blend with the orange jumpsuit coming your way?
925347168948498432 2017-10-31 13:02:11 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump You're such a transparent twat. Can't wait to see you're orangutan ass in cuffs Donnie Boy the Bitch will be your yard name.
922988723897290753 2017-10-24 00:50:34 UTC <75tribe54> @DawgsByNature He blocked me for calling him out on his draft record as well.pic.twitter.com/wK9BY5osyJ
922562326493925381 2017-10-23 20:36:13 UTC <75tribe54> @evansilva @thebigbear1977 @roholman09 He's not even leaving USC after this season. He's fallen down a bunch of boards. Not even in consideration for top QB much less no. 1 pick.
922195185018245121 2017-10-22 20:17:20 UTC <75tribe54> @DawgsByNature Hopefully they leave him and the front office in London.

922191336685662209 2017-10-22 20:02:02 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR With a full roster it's tough for Hue to call plays
922190832261791744 2017-10-22 20:00:02 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR It would help if he was an NFL receiver instead of a pile of burning garbage.
922170875646021635 2017-10-22 18:40:44 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump You're a stain on humanity, the day God ends you will be glorious.
921585045495836672 2017-10-20 03:52:51 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN You mean after Jason Campbell broke his leg and had to use the worst bust in NFL history? How is he neglecting Njoku? Hogan threw to him a bunch, that's on Kizer's bad reads. He's made questionable decisions, but the FO has sabotaged this team.
921580345367162881 2017-10-20 03:34:11 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN With the "talent" on the roster. 8-8 was Hue's record with a team with actual NFL players. So who's more at fault a coach has won some games with actual players, or a salary cap guy who had never evaluated talent. Hmmmm.
921578526708584449 2017-10-20 03:26:57 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN 1-21, yup real talented. Collins has done what since coming here? Oh yeah constantly put himself out of position by free wheeling. Keep sucking Sashi's cock all the way out of town
921576309716914176 2017-10-20 03:18:08 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN He's let three go and added zero. But those are just facts. He has no business as a talent evaluator, it's ok to accept it. Hue has his problems, but let's put blame in all the correct places.
921574005160718341 2017-10-20 03:08:59 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN None of those guys have done anything. Christ Coleman can't even get on the field. Your idea of talent is making me laugh. Other than Garrett, who would've been the #1 pick for anyone drafting, there's no real talent there. The cupboard is bare.
921568936486895621 2017-10-20 02:48:51 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Give me names of talent he's brought in, Garrett doesn't count because anyone would have picked him.
921568645179899904 2017-10-20 02:47:41 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN No, that's front office, you know since Sashi makes the picks since he decides the 53. Face it, Hue is not the biggest problem. Unqualified people in positions they shouldn't be in are.
921566455187034112 2017-10-20 02:38:59 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Gibson's the starting free for the top pass defense, just stop. Schwartz is the highest rated RT in NFL. Passing on QBs are blown picks too. Sashi sucks. He's a salary cap lawyer, stop beating the drum for him.
921561803771011072 2017-10-20 02:20:30 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Schwartz, Gibson, Gabriel, Sheard, just to scratch the surface of talent ejected the last few seasons. The only culture being cultivated by Sashi is getting worse every year. They've blown massive picks. Like badly.
921558823550246912 2017-10-20 02:08:39 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Gutting talent and just keeping picks isn't a plan. It's a way to distract from incompetence.
921555901940682753 2017-10-20 01:57:03 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN So just keep having these people that have never had the game keep screwing the pooch. Gotcha. Good plan.
921553842638151680 2017-10-20 01:48:52 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN He's a six time exec of the year and built the Bills into a powerhouse, so maybe rethink that.

919626045048934401 2017-10-15 18:08:29 UTC <75tribe54> @PfefferFeff Keep your Kentucky team full of felons.
919625730983686144 2017-10-15 18:07:14 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Its time to show Hue the door. Good coordinator, horrible at managing a whole team.
919624884765982720 2017-10-15 18:03:52 UTC <75tribe54> @JasonLaCanfora @MeatyPorkchop Yeah just like the Kaepernick he put out that is total BS. LaConfora is a pathetic hack.
919623965072592897 2017-10-15 18:00:13 UTC <75tribe54> So can we all admit Kevin Hogan sucks and it was a horrible decision to start him. #Browns
919622664909742082 2017-10-15 17:55:03 UTC <75tribe54> @PumpkinNation Your knee jerk reactions are hilarious. Right after Crow goes and rips off 2 10+ yard run.

918621019056869376 2017-10-12 23:34:52 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman So spreading a false narrative then with no context. He was blocking people on Twitter during his start, I'd call that distracted.
918620557402345473 2017-10-12 23:33:02 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman Dude seriously, the article says no. It's a report on a Deadspin article about Bauer blocking people on Twitter during his last start.
918619563683655685 2017-10-12 23:29:05 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman If you actually read the article it says no
918619261618348032 2017-10-12 23:27:53 UTC <75tribe54> @hustlerclubcle @HammerNation19 @MStorlie87 @colemann59 The article actually says no
918328270277443586 2017-10-11 04:11:36 UTC <75tribe54> @DustinFox37 Actually, when the zone is like that it changes the approach. You have to protect impossible spots.
918295243379871744 2017-10-11 02:00:21 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk He looked safe
918288447210737665 2017-10-11 01:33:21 UTC <75tribe54> @HammerNation19 It's a fucking fix. MLB needs Yankees to move on.
918288186270461952 2017-10-11 01:32:19 UTC <75tribe54> @MLB This strike zone for the Yankees is bullshit, bordering on a fix. They've had an extra 6 inches in their zone since game 2.
918280231684894720 2017-10-11 01:00:42 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN Like the size of a Buick for the Yanks. Ever since game 2.
918279799868620800 2017-10-11 00:58:59 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN They refuse to acknowledge the huge discrepancy in the strike zone between the two teams.
918278202061189120 2017-10-11 00:52:38 UTC <75tribe54> @HammerNation19 Tribe pitcher strike zone=thimble NY pitcher strike zone=Buick
918277611201224705 2017-10-11 00:50:17 UTC <75tribe54> @FS1 Why don't your commentators talk about the strike zone being the size of a Buick for NY pitchers
918277205918191616 2017-10-11 00:48:41 UTC <75tribe54> @MLBastian Ever since the Tribe went up 2 gamers the strike zone for NY pitchers is roughly the sized of a Buick.
918271494588944385 2017-10-11 00:25:59 UTC <75tribe54> Who are the fucking hitters and where did the Tribe go? #RallyTogether
918111498060423168 2017-10-11 13:50:13 UTC <75tribe54> @realDonaldTrump You're a piece of shit, tiny dicked, white supremacist, who's wife is probably getting filled with big black cock nightly. Fuck Yourself.
917541068652064769 2017-10-09 00:03:32 UTC <75tribe54> @richeisen only because of the strike zone bias
917530009564270597 2017-10-09 23:19:35 UTC <75tribe54> That was a strike for Severino you fucking mutt.
917273599655989249 2017-10-08 06:20:42 UTC <75tribe54> @KurtSchlichter Kurt Sphincter
917219268630056960 2017-10-08 02:44:49 UTC <75tribe54> This strike zone for the woman beater is bullshit #RallyTogether
917215313661431808 2017-10-08 02:29:06 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl Its actually jheri curl juice under his hat to load up the ball
917203966970269697 2017-10-08 01:44:01 UTC <75tribe54> @DIRECTV @RuiterWrongFAN That's why I have Sling to back up the Dish
917201254341861377 2017-10-08 01:33:14 UTC <75tribe54> @FS1 @Indians @TheRealLA__ It's hitting Joe Buck blowing Scwarber proportions.
917126539917119489 2017-10-08 20:36:21 UTC <75tribe54> Jesus how terrible is NFL officiating #PackersCowboys
917111852836048896 2017-10-08 19:37:59 UTC <75tribe54> How was that not pass interference #Browns
917108213882990592 2017-10-08 19:23:31 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi For once I agree with you Tony.
917107935054004224 2017-10-08 19:22:25 UTC <75tribe54> That's another shitty red zone play call #Browns
917107414457077761 2017-10-08 19:20:21 UTC <75tribe54> @ProFootballTalk Maybe AB was throwing a tantrum for a reason
917106994850488323 2017-10-08 19:18:41 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN He's the best pick this front office has made
917106376341708800 2017-10-08 19:16:13 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Njoku is a beast. Making Hogan look better. That should've been Kizer's main target.
917103963027238913 2017-10-08 19:06:38 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN And another horrible INT for Hogan, just like the last time he came in for Kizer.
917103452127416328 2017-10-08 19:04:36 UTC <75tribe54> @DustinFox37 And horrible INT right on cue for Hogan.
917100548431798277 2017-10-08 18:53:04 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Like night and day. If I remember though Hogan's last year was terrible. I think Kizer shouldn't have started this season and just sat.
917098148908163073 2017-10-08 18:43:32 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN No catch
917092359439044609 2017-10-08 18:20:31 UTC <75tribe54> They've got to cut this fucking kicker #Browns
917091100766228484 2017-10-08 18:15:31 UTC <75tribe54> Horrible red zone play calling, but horrendous throw and read by @DKizer_14 .#Browns
917081755047297025 2017-10-08 17:38:23 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR The term is bullshit call
917081570397257737 2017-10-08 17:37:39 UTC <75tribe54> What the fuck is that roughing call. Bullshit.
916668486155370496 2017-10-07 14:16:12 UTC <75tribe54> @WillBrinson Using salty Yankee fan tears to make my morning coffee.
916667614163857408 2017-10-07 14:12:44 UTC <75tribe54> Aww poor Yankees fans. Can I get your salty tears in a cup. I need to make coffee. https://twitter.com/JeweleeYankee/status/916496434152837120
916664198922457088 2017-10-07 13:59:10 UTC <75tribe54> @CleTribeGirl Edwin is day to day and will play in the ALCS.
916512319764561920 2017-10-06 03:55:39 UTC <75tribe54> @ClvlndK8 But the score was 2-1

914538933773586433 2017-10-01 17:14:07 UTC <75tribe54> Kenny Britt is fucking worthless. Cut his ass, like right now, in the middle of the game.

912054795783098369 2017-09-24 20:43:03 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN The play calling is ridiculous
912051268708917248 2017-09-24 20:29:02 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN I don't like that 10 second run off shit, especially when it's a mandatory booth review.
912050884581961730 2017-09-24 20:27:30 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN how quickly that changed, huh. No comeback in Motown.
912050055678394369 2017-09-24 20:24:13 UTC <75tribe54> @ClvlndK8 I'm a veteran and I took a knee during the anthem today. It's disgusting to use our service to silence Black Americans and promote racism.
912040422414921728 2017-09-24 19:45:56 UTC <75tribe54> Why does this stupid bitch commentator keep calling Brissett, Kizer? Must think all black people look the same.
912036061781614593 2017-09-24 19:28:36 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN Not on Kizer, it's on Britt. If Britt isn't cut on Monday then fire Hue.
912035483584204801 2017-09-24 19:26:18 UTC <75tribe54> @egoldie80 No, not a bad throw. Just a shit receiver.
912033195310424064 2017-09-24 19:17:13 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN The officiating is atrocious
912031516456341507 2017-09-24 19:10:32 UTC <75tribe54> @DustinFox37 Still a hit out of bounds, text book flag play. But not for the Browns.
912029209379397633 2017-09-24 19:01:22 UTC <75tribe54> These commentators making excuses for shitty Kenny Britt is too much.
912023928461303808 2017-09-24 18:40:23 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Like what defense are you running there Greg?
912023802019803136 2017-09-24 18:39:53 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN This game drove me to whiskey by the start of the second quarter
912023477384810496 2017-09-24 18:38:36 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Fair assessment. The last couple of drives Kizer has been throwing it quickly. Especially on that 2 minute drive.
912022205235712000 2017-09-24 18:33:32 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN See how they scored a TD there
912021934858231808 2017-09-24 18:32:28 UTC <75tribe54> Jordan Fucking Leslie!
912018909422915584 2017-09-24 18:20:27 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN That was a bullshit interference call
912018592924880901 2017-09-24 18:19:11 UTC <75tribe54> Even more bullshit calls
912016305695477761 2017-09-24 18:10:06 UTC <75tribe54> Look for the fucking ball you blind fuck
912013692207804417 2017-09-24 17:59:43 UTC <75tribe54> @KenCarman That was beyond holding, that was straight up tackling
912013041373450240 2017-09-24 17:57:08 UTC <75tribe54> @TonyGrossi pretty easy for the qb to run when the o line is just tackling people with no flags.
912009399740325888 2017-09-24 17:42:39 UTC <75tribe54> holy shit a run play, I didn't think Hue had those in the playbook.
912007270862598145 2017-09-24 17:34:12 UTC <75tribe54> Jesus Hue, hire a fucking offensive coordinator. You can't call plays.
912006785241899008 2017-09-24 17:32:16 UTC <75tribe54> @geoff_wills @pwrmaster7 The asshole who's screen name is to keep a racist caricature is calling people sheep. Ah the irony.

911979761391558656 2017-09-24 15:44:53 UTC <75tribe54> @IsaiahCrowell34 I'm a veteran and I completely support your protests.
909485007495946242 2017-09-17 18:31:37 UTC <75tribe54> @TheOBR So much for that QB controversy
909468690818764800 2017-09-17 17:26:47 UTC <75tribe54> Hey @NFLonCBS get some broadcasters that aren't blast biased cunts. #BrownsRavens

908341336390164480 2017-09-14 14:47:05 UTC <75tribe54> @ESPNCleveland Is Rizzo going to punch his wife in the face again if they don't win?
908304730757189632 2017-09-14 12:21:37 UTC <75tribe54> Seriously @SportsCenter? The Indians win 21 straight and your lead is the freaking Dodgers winning 2 in a row? Unfreakingbelievable.
907982815735812097 2017-09-13 15:02:27 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 Decisions are always judged on hindsight, if they kick the fg and don't get another possession he's skewered for being conservative.
907981162836045825 2017-09-13 14:55:53 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 That's funny because I've never left a casino in the negative.
907980727777726464 2017-09-13 14:54:09 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 You have to take gambles that aren't expected.
907980644361404416 2017-09-13 14:53:49 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 Baseball is a marathon where numbers level out over time. Football is like a sprint on a risk board.
907979791952949248 2017-09-13 14:50:26 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 Part of strategy is gambling.
907979719081111552 2017-09-13 14:50:09 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 Going for more points is trying to win, probability equations on your laptop obviously didn't give you basic football common sense.
907978497280413696 2017-09-13 14:45:17 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 If your going by strictly numbers probability, but realistically you go for that 8 because going in for 3 at the end is easier than 8.
907975778733830144 2017-09-13 14:34:29 UTC <75tribe54> @CLEsportsTalk @DemBoyz440 The fact that you said the play call that scored a touchdown to make it a 3 point game was terrible shows how invalid you are.
905951981008814080 2017-09-07 00:32:38 UTC <75tribe54> @Browns_SZN Didn't you say Garrett wouldn't miss the opener yesterday? I mean Pryor never should've been traded for, but it seems like dominos falling.
905618569114857472 2017-09-06 02:27:47 UTC <75tribe54> @SirFranksnBacon @twithersAP Based on what I've heard he's playing..... see they both have the same merit. Smh.
905572000432873474 2017-09-06 23:22:44 UTC <75tribe54> @Isaiah_Thomas Looking forward to watching you ball out in The Land this season. You're gonna be awesome on this team.

903996260767621121 2017-09-02 15:01:18 UTC <75tribe54> @AlbertBreer @ProFootballTalk @DanielDeMarzo @TheBiddy69 Actually his stats say his QB rating was top 6 smart guy. You're the same grey meat fucks that say concussions are fake news.

812728409856102400 2016-12-24 18:35:27 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN It was an extra down given after the intentional grounding. Should've been turnover in downs.

794201458082193408 2016-11-03 15:35:57 UTC <75tribe54> @TheRealTRizzo The Cubs don't win this series without the help they got from the worst umpiring I've ever seen.
794168649967878144 2016-11-03 13:25:35 UTC <75tribe54> @MikeAndMike No way the Cubs win that series without the outrageous advantage the umps gave their pitchers. Worst umps ever.

739623712333418496 2016-06-05 01:03:29 UTC <75tribe54> @RuiterWrongFAN it shouldn't surprise, it's like a league mandate to make sure  GSW win
738572754065215488 2016-06-02 03:27:21 UTC <75tribe54> Teams tend to lose energy when they realize the officials won't let them win.
