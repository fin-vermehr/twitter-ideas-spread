905285608880340992 2017-09-05 04:24:43 UTC <TaraP101> I won't even start on the rest.
905285426310766593 2017-09-05 04:23:59 UTC <TaraP101> the entire show as a whole. And as it is, Lockjaw is frankly a bit lackluster and Medusa's hair is less than unimpressive.
905285120529240065 2017-09-05 04:22:46 UTC <TaraP101> no problem with that once so ever. Because yes, Medusa's hair is awesome and Lockjaw is the best example of Inhumanity, but this is about...
905284718140248064 2017-09-05 04:21:10 UTC <TaraP101> the appearance of Lockjaw. But if sacrificing these things meant we got the space epic, GOT-esque show we had been promised, i would have...
905284490175664128 2017-09-05 04:20:16 UTC <TaraP101> Now, this would, yes require some sacrifice as to the powers and existence within this world of certain characters, such a Medusa's hair and
905284217071968257 2017-09-05 04:19:11 UTC <TaraP101> Opinion: I think Marvel's Inhumans show would have been better if they had spent less money on CGI and more on, you know everything else...

808353962852319233 2016-12-12 16:52:57 UTC <TaraP101> @realcyclops hope they do something similar with uncanny, bit and the series just reinvent it a little

804463080692273152 2016-12-01 23:11:59 UTC <TaraP101> @ComicCrusaders Darkseid always seemed like more end-of-the-world to me. Thanos on the other hand can be taken down by the Ultimates alone.

804083335790149632 2016-11-30 22:03:01 UTC <TaraP101> I cant tell if Emmas brilliant or totally lost it or both #IvX #XMen

803988363288068096 2016-11-30 15:45:37 UTC <TaraP101> @Newsarama this is literally my only complaint about this series
803987929592786944 2016-11-30 15:43:54 UTC <TaraP101> @Newsarama how is omega level telepath Quentin Quire not cu out for X-Men???

803487656931799040 2016-11-28 06:36:00 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Have to find that perfect balance. Not so low-level its boring, not so amazing its utterly unrelatable.
803486110567407616 2016-11-28 06:29:51 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb OH SO MUCH WORSE 
803485658475991040 2016-11-28 06:28:03 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Thats true, the characters on a team are only half as important as how they work together. Yet another reason why its impossible
803484585161945088 2016-11-28 06:23:47 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb After a couple thousand years maybe, even then, kind of a stretch
803483926941442049 2016-11-28 06:21:10 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Like me trying to pick my favorite version of X-Men , completely hopeless
803482625457332224 2016-11-28 06:16:00 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Its so tragic that they waste such a fascinating character on the Avengers, was so glad he got his own series, cant wait for it
803481927252516865 2016-11-28 06:13:14 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Hopefully his new series will let him do something more interesting than hanging out with the B-Team Avengers

803479815852392448 2016-11-28 06:04:50 UTC <TaraP101> @sithlordlb Ya, im bumbed she isnt gonna show up in the new Blue or Gold series. Figure she'll stick with the Avengers
