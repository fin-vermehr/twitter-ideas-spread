945804194279297024 2017-12-26 23:51:06 UTC <AndyReid78> @corybowles Why are you engaging with such moronacy???  Its pointless....if you haven't stopped believing in santa by now what makes you think they dont believe in the easter bunny or the tooth fairly?? Which is just as plausible as there being a god and all 4 were fabricated by humans...
945311163511918592 2017-12-25 15:11:59 UTC <AndyReid78> @blamirgoat Lol fuel....
945308663220187138 2017-12-25 15:02:02 UTC <AndyReid78> @SI_PeterKing @BNick At this exact moment the ball is moving in his hands....its freaking halarious and so frustrating that people dont understand simple rules....but Patriots derangement syndrome is spreading rapidly...
945307980345565184 2017-12-25 14:59:20 UTC <AndyReid78> @SI_PeterKing It could also be it takes time to sync videos so you can see the ball not secure as his foot comes off the field....this is pro sports not the everyone gets to feel good league...and besides...24-3 second half
945146119188869120 2017-12-24 04:16:09 UTC <AndyReid78> @scottzolak Die hard 2 die hard 1
945085730673569792 2017-12-24 00:16:11 UTC <AndyReid78> @stoolpresidente It doesn't matter what the right call is, the one they made was the one they made and then buffalo got the ball back to start the half and got blown out...thats some mental toughness!? God dont you see how pathetic it is to cry over one call?  24-3 second half...same old Bills
945084759096594433 2017-12-24 00:12:20 UTC <AndyReid78> @stoolpresidente So at this rate the crying losers all stop watching football and then Tom and Bb retire and the NFL folds.....works for me.
945084043875508224 2017-12-24 00:09:29 UTC <AndyReid78> @SI_PeterKing Stop crying!!!!!!!!!!!!
945068653090926592 2017-12-24 23:08:20 UTC <AndyReid78> @BostonSportsBSJ @cpriceNFL So it could of been 37-20???

945058616998064128 2017-12-24 22:28:27 UTC <AndyReid78> @MikeGiardi He dropped the ball in pit and he juggled it in Foxboro....get over it losers....

945015679329153027 2017-12-24 19:37:50 UTC <AndyReid78> @MikeGarafolo Its a TD if the receiver's mom is the ref
944931268793430017 2017-12-24 14:02:25 UTC <AndyReid78> @MikeReiss And Brady to a MASH unit good grief
943927601927741441 2017-12-21 19:34:12 UTC <AndyReid78> @Steel_Curtain4 Caught what???
943308430001008641 2017-12-19 02:33:50 UTC <AndyReid78> @BackAftaThis @darrenrovell Lol this being a catch is ridiculous...the receiver even knew he dropped it and played coy and the ref bought it.
943260148482609152 2017-12-19 23:21:58 UTC <AndyReid78> @MikeGiardi @Sevrin_L The fact he is a runner means everything....i think its safe to say Patriots players know what they're doing...?? Isnt it? BB team breaking team rules?  "Put your best Foot forward" 83 sat a whole series in a playoff game....
943251998962536454 2017-12-19 22:49:35 UTC <AndyReid78> @TonyMassarotti They were a runner in every picture you just put up....why is this so hard to understand
942589443839545344 2017-12-17 02:56:50 UTC <AndyReid78> @jacktodd46 Yum yum yum oh yes more please...let the hate flow and give patriots nation even more strength....hate, wine, cry, say idiotic things...we love it!!
942557236127289344 2017-12-17 00:48:51 UTC <AndyReid78> @JoshYohe_PGH @drewsamuto Correct....at least someone get it.
942556998222123008 2017-12-17 00:47:54 UTC <AndyReid78> @JoshYohe_PGH If you are going to the ground to make the catch you have to hold onto the ball when you land. He isnt a runner until he completes the catch so goal line is not a factor. Its an incomplete pass.
942555990817468416 2017-12-17 00:43:54 UTC <AndyReid78> @JoshYohe_PGH Classic Pittsburgh loss....idiots.
942489885813952513 2017-12-17 20:21:14 UTC <AndyReid78> @mirtle The point of DH1 and DH2 being the best xmas movies is that xmas movies SUCK!
