971817662664855552 2018-03-08 18:39:20 UTC <laurashredder> Ive seen a lot of posts encouraging women to avoid gendered work today, which is, like, cool if you can swing it. But also, if todays the only day youve got all week to do laundry, you arent less of a feminist for getting that shit done. You do you, pal.
971799579292205056 2018-03-08 17:27:29 UTC <laurashredder> Who else struggles to throw out leftovers? What weird combo meals have you eaten because of it?   I just topped a curried lentil stew with half of a browning avocado, and while its not terrible, I wouldnt suggest anyone else try it.
971773695449542657 2018-03-08 15:44:38 UTC <laurashredder> S/o to my landlord for suggesting my bf shouldve dug my car out this morning instead of him (his clearing of the driveway is a part of our rental agreement) & for then complaining about dudes who dont do physical labor for their femme partners #internationalwomensday2018
971595327190036482 2018-03-07 03:55:52 UTC <laurashredder> @vornietom Consider watching the Degrassi ep where they put it on. Fairly solid.

970435624430981120 2018-03-04 23:07:37 UTC <laurashredder> Liebs cant decide which of her numerous toys she wants to play with; she keeps bringing me a new one every time I throw one.
970099295910268930 2018-03-03 00:51:10 UTC <laurashredder> Pretty sure a teenager just mistook me for his tinder date in front of said date (who was definitely a teenager also, and very very blonde)
969935185235120128 2018-03-03 13:59:03 UTC <laurashredder> Is it possible to make french toast for one without feeling wasteful or way too stuffed to move?

969054767522746368 2018-02-28 03:40:35 UTC <laurashredder> My dumb heart is so content sleeping in one of my bfs dirty shirts, and honestly, I think thats the smartest move its ever made.
968794375248637952 2018-02-28 10:25:53 UTC <laurashredder> I feel this so deeply. Knowing my alarm was going to go off in hour I laid in bed, meal planning at 4 this morning.https://twitter.com/tabernacleteeth/status/968744575392210944

968450443427942401 2018-02-27 11:39:13 UTC <laurashredder> I so appreciate that NPR can find a way to say (of Drumpf) are his ideas anything more than ideas? without describing such ideas as terrible, horrible, no good, very bad.
968384819469185024 2018-02-26 07:18:27 UTC <laurashredder> Just switched my alarm so I goes off at 630 instead of 6 because Im sure that extra half hour will really do something. WHY DID I PUT ON FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT MIDNIGHT?
968371088626511872 2018-02-26 06:23:53 UTC <laurashredder> the number of missed opportunities for lesbian sex scenes in Fried Green Tomatoes is 4,876,238,997.   AMEN, AMEN, AMEN.https://www.autostraddle.com/secretly-gay-movies-fried-green-tomatoes-186793/

965947253356625920 2018-02-20 13:52:26 UTC <laurashredder> Facebook memories just reminded me that in 2012, I said nothing makes me happier than couples pissing each other off on the newlywed game, and now Im wondering if we can ever really change or if we just grow more into we already are as we age.

964317597855637504 2018-02-15 01:56:46 UTC <laurashredder> Third ep of Queer Eye does more to model how to have a conversation with someone whose politics/identities appear antithetical to yours more than any political/resistance workshop Ive attended in recent years

959048894746451969 2018-02-01 13:00:49 UTC <laurashredder> The thing about grief is that grief doesnt give a shit that you generally know the difference between your/youre. Griefs just going to pop over & make ya mess it up sometimes.https://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/958922560296677376

951884470998708224 2018-01-12 18:31:57 UTC <laurashredder> And Ive been really happy with how removing most animal meats from diet has gone - I feel healthier, and Ive saved a ton of money on groceries. Plus, Im real proud for sticking w/a resolution - so much so that I didnt even plan on making a resolution for 2018. But, then...

944526114386595846 2017-12-23 11:12:28 UTC <laurashredder> I may have discovered last night that I need to add crab to the list of foods I cant eat without wanting to die

944218806305648640 2017-12-22 14:51:20 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey I told him about it this morning, and he responded I think that fart woke me up too.
944167111789830144 2017-12-22 11:25:55 UTC <laurashredder> My brother is farting so loudly it woke me up from another room
944068130724372480 2017-12-21 04:52:36 UTC <laurashredder> I survived a full day at universal (from the moment the park opened til it closed!) plus the 2.5 hrs drive on either side of it! My head has never earned a pillow more than on this night.
943936242630225920 2017-12-21 20:08:32 UTC <laurashredder>  Accio Christmas!

943561882828464128 2017-12-20 19:20:58 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I know! I saw it and immediately knew I had to get it for ya!
943561415327125504 2017-12-20 19:19:06 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Only the best for my bestie! And they are the best freaking Oreos, man.

943142761439604736 2017-12-19 15:35:31 UTC <laurashredder> People who stand in front of the luggage carousel before bags even start coming out are probably the same people who stand up before the planes completely down taxiing to the gate, right?
943141836432044032 2017-12-19 15:31:51 UTC <laurashredder> Been in Florida five minutes, already sweating
942859399009271808 2017-12-18 20:49:32 UTC <laurashredder> When the heaviest package costs the least to ship... ???
942483967055458305 2017-12-17 19:57:42 UTC <laurashredder> Definitely just made myself hungry on this train ride home thinking about the pizza Im going to order for dinner later 
942467840304664582 2017-12-17 18:53:37 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Omg; you would have died laughing right along side us. I literally became a child for a brief moment in time.
942463886170771457 2017-12-17 18:37:55 UTC <laurashredder> Anyway, heres a pic of Mary and I with a different man dressed as Santa , who was not nearly as into the idea of grown woman being stoked to meet Father Christmas.pic.twitter.com/ZqJrP8uEnL
942463533744345088 2017-12-17 18:36:31 UTC <laurashredder> Immediately upon walking away, I bust out laughing while repeating I dont know why I just did that. Mary and I cried laughing as we replayed the scene. But like, its really what my soul needed, and Im real glad my heart beat out my brain in that moment.
942462663061397504 2017-12-17 18:33:03 UTC <laurashredder> The man didnt seem fazed at all by an adult woman running up to him to say hello, and instead spoke to me with the spirit of Christmas in his eyes. Honestly, it was one of the purest moments of joy Ive had as an adult.
942462364183654401 2017-12-17 18:31:52 UTC <laurashredder> Last night, I was walking around Manhattan w/a childhood friend when I saw a man dressed as Santa in a van. Look, Mary, its Santa Claus! I exclaimed, as I ran up to the van & said Hi, Santa!
942129913481572352 2017-12-16 20:30:49 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey Waiting anxiously for an update
942128832055824390 2017-12-16 20:26:32 UTC <laurashredder> Drinking a Dunkin while waiting out in the cold for a train. Have I figured out the Northeast yet?

940774440002080768 2017-12-12 02:44:39 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot We need a real phone date ASAP

940597148101632002 2017-12-12 15:00:10 UTC <laurashredder>   @lcopperpothttps://twitter.com/evanedinger/status/940259987980419072
940594727518461952 2017-12-12 14:50:33 UTC <laurashredder> Sorry not sorry for my twitter thread this morning.
940593431331639297 2017-12-12 14:45:24 UTC <laurashredder> If youve ever felt similarly, my heart breaks with you. I will hold space for you. I believe you.
940593071804309504 2017-12-12 14:43:58 UTC <laurashredder> I know my experience, and even with people I really love & trust, Im scared to tell them because of the possibility of not being believed, of being asked to see if from his perspective, of being asked why I didnt say something sooner.
940592650150924288 2017-12-12 14:42:17 UTC <laurashredder> So, mostly, I just want to ask you to interrogate what keeps you from believing someone when they tell you about their trauma. Work on that.
940592064995168257 2017-12-12 14:39:58 UTC <laurashredder> Silence is not always complicity; silence is often survival. It can take time, like a really long fucking time, to feel safe enough to speak up; temporally, the likelihood of being believed/ getting justice is inversely related to finding space to use our voices.
940590382538215424 2017-12-12 14:33:17 UTC <laurashredder> Generally, I am not one to be silenced, but there have been moments in my life where being silent was the only thing I believed would save me. The #metoo campaign has done a lot to bring the spotlight on a critical issue in our lives, but Im skeptical of its long term efficacy.
940589538933649408 2017-12-12 14:29:56 UTC <laurashredder> I will carry this with me, as I carry being french kissed while asleep on a school bus in HS, as I carry an ex breaking in to my apt & waking me up with his yelling, as I carry a chipped tooth & a voice saying now no one will ever find you attractive, & more.
940588660013043713 2017-12-12 14:26:26 UTC <laurashredder> In sum: the way a man idk touched me last night made me feel apologetic for existing, & he felt justified in his actions because he believed he deserved to be able to see the stage (WHILE SEATED nonetheless). P quickl, I just want to move beyond it, but thats not a real option.
940585983199928321 2017-12-12 14:15:48 UTC <laurashredder> Believe ppl when they speak up against their abusers. Believe ppl even when the timing is inconvenient. Being assaulted/abused is dehumanizing. Feeling less than makes it hard to believe speaking up will do any good. Speaking up & not being believed only furthers the cycle.
940584184472657921 2017-12-12 14:08:39 UTC <laurashredder> At Thanksgiving, in a convo about Roy Moore with my dad (a man who loves me fiercely & without question would die to protect me), he honestly asked me if I believe the women. I couldnt have said yes louder or faster, but still my mom beat me to it.
940583344143847425 2017-12-12 14:05:19 UTC <laurashredder> In the moment, I couldnt muster the strength to defend myself. I had to walk away, leave the venue, ask a friend to drive me home. I felt like a shell of myself once again last night because of the trauma I have lived & get to relive for the rest of my life.
940582370566164480 2017-12-12 14:01:26 UTC <laurashredder> I have experienced a wide range of physical and verbal abuses across my time as a woman in this world, and while his hand on my hip/ass or the extent to which he pushed me was pretty minor in comparison to much of it, it triggered a lot of previous pain.
940581239383306240 2017-12-12 13:56:57 UTC <laurashredder> Which is to say, last night a man I dont know aggressively physically moved me out of his line of sight at a local show. When I said you didnt have to touch me, in a pretty polite tone, he responded with thats the only way ppl pay attention to me. WTF.
940580950244839424 2017-12-12 13:55:48 UTC <laurashredder> Im down for Dont put your hands on other people without their explicit consent 2018 and/or if you arent sure if its cool if you touch somebody, then dont FOREVER.

939263743124475904 2017-12-08 22:41:41 UTC <laurashredder> Today I decided that any time someone tells me their fav band / genre of music, Im just going to recommend @BABYMETAL_JAPAN without further explanation.
939254128710176769 2017-12-08 22:03:29 UTC <laurashredder> This was most concerning to me when I remembered that not only had I been home, Id showered and done a load of laundry.
939243946433220613 2017-12-08 21:23:01 UTC <laurashredder> @KellyPDillon Were both so responsible with our shower beer advice! 
939243487656062980 2017-12-08 21:21:12 UTC <laurashredder> @KellyPDillon I also spoke about the power of the shower beer to some stressed out (and of age!) students today!!!!

939228375016714241 2017-12-08 20:21:09 UTC <laurashredder> When you cant remember if youve been home yet today, you maybe have a little too much going on
939131308810428417 2017-12-08 13:55:26 UTC <laurashredder> Just a quick reminder that your body has earned every bit of the space it takes up. Heres to being kind to ourselves and each other today, yall
939003033022631942 2017-12-07 05:25:43 UTC <laurashredder> Weird how each time you do a thing it makes doing that thing seem less impossible
938910366200934401 2017-12-07 23:17:30 UTC <laurashredder> The best kind of kiddos to watch are the ones that are down for a post-dinner dance session. To get the wiggles out, as Hattie explained very succinctly. 
938800571108200448 2017-12-07 16:01:12 UTC <laurashredder> The bf came over for a min this morning, and I had egg on my face.   I literally had egg, on my face.   Let me tell yall, Id never realized how true to its definition that phrase actually is. 
938265100204564481 2017-12-05 04:33:26 UTC <laurashredder> @trwillis1 Remember when you looked at your twitter profile and were so shocked by how many times youd tweeted about the voice??  Hahahahahhahaha

937906579659214851 2017-12-04 04:48:48 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly, I just instagrammed about my bubble bath w/the caption its been a day. But its actually been more like a year. Or a whole freaking life.   So praise to @lushcosmetics golden egg bath bomb for seeing me through another day in this wacky world.
937727715159019520 2017-12-04 16:58:04 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot also, I love that it looks like Liebs is saying she sings in public with my avi right now
937727557021110272 2017-12-04 16:57:26 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I sing in public. And Im weird. So, while I have no demonstrating a causal link, some anecdotal evidence suggests a possible correlation, yes.
937470196884832257 2017-12-03 23:54:46 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Preach
937433611233619968 2017-12-03 21:29:24 UTC <laurashredder> Heres a thing I never expected to say in Connecticut in 2017: apparently there was a free bluegrass jam at the Best Video in town today from 2-5.
937409746981793793 2017-12-03 19:54:34 UTC <laurashredder> Does the intensity with which others use the restroom in public ever frighten you?   Ive used the phrase piss like a racehorse countless times in my life, but never did I think it was actually possible for a human to do so.
937409151214505984 2017-12-03 19:52:12 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 That was yesterday (when I forgot the batteries) hahahaha
937408862797357062 2017-12-03 19:51:03 UTC <laurashredder> Im leaving Target with ONLY the batteries for which I came. Its a friggin Christmas miracle.

936572297011441665 2017-12-01 12:26:50 UTC <laurashredder> Ive spent the last 90 mins trying to figure out how to style my hair for a Prohibition Repeal party tomorrow, & while filming an IG story in full costume, I caught the eye of my neighbor who didnt seemed fazed at all to see me dressed like its 1934 at 7AM on a work day.
936447876506574848 2017-11-30 04:12:26 UTC <laurashredder> My love is like I wish you were here postcards when here is less than five miles from there.
936445701227274240 2017-11-30 04:03:48 UTC <laurashredder> I pulled a muscle in my neck playing board games
936417499918290944 2017-11-30 02:11:44 UTC <laurashredder> Well, coffee doesnt make you poop really. Its just that caffeine makes the bowels loose.  Just like death.  Yes, just like death.   
936257395545858048 2017-11-30 15:35:32 UTC <laurashredder> If youre not more than two boobs & a vagina to your gyno, get yourself a new one!
936257290419785728 2017-11-30 15:35:07 UTC <laurashredder> So, obviously she said a lot of nice and important stuff to me, but my absolute favorite quote of our conversation this morning was youre more than two boobs & a vagina to me!
936257000715014144 2017-11-30 15:33:58 UTC <laurashredder> Today, she walked into my examination room and immediately looked me in the eyes and smiled. She asked me what was new, celebrated how much has changed for the better for me in the past year, and applauded me for doing the work it took to get here
936256536720048129 2017-11-30 15:32:07 UTC <laurashredder> This time last year, I was dealing with the end of my marriage by not dealing with my depression, and my gyno was like thats enough of that bullshit and pointed me in the direction of some mental health professionals.
936256263662587904 2017-11-30 15:31:02 UTC <laurashredder> I love my gyno, yall. I know so many people have terrible experiences with health care providers, so I feel all the more inspired to share how great & validating real health care can be...
936076778287792128 2017-11-29 03:37:50 UTC <laurashredder> I have such a crush on my boyfriend, yall.

919763822457622528 2017-10-15 03:15:58 UTC <laurashredder> If theyre coming back for seconds, then dinners a hit, right? 
919750680772038656 2017-10-15 02:23:45 UTC <laurashredder> Just realized one of the main things I think I would appreciate about tenure is the ability to play fantasy sports if/when I want
919744235099877377 2017-10-15 01:58:08 UTC <laurashredder> Couldnt think of the last time without real cognitive effort. Strange to think to myself Lifes been a little nicer to me lately, I guess
919743959576047616 2017-10-15 01:57:02 UTC <laurashredder> Almost cried bc my grocery is outta cookie butter Oreos & realized how long its been since something so minor made me cry in public.

919146807384576002 2017-10-14 10:24:10 UTC <laurashredder> When did I become the kind of woman who will get up and work for 3 hrs when she cant sleep and then try to nap from 6-7 am?

918466909418508288 2017-10-12 13:22:30 UTC <laurashredder> When three pairs in a row of hose/tights that you put on have runs in them, you eventually decide to stop fighting fate.
918457878838763521 2017-10-12 12:46:37 UTC <laurashredder> No, YOURE crying about a run in your hose.

917963249064251393 2017-10-10 04:01:08 UTC <laurashredder> I beat the deadline for my 4th review by 45 mins. Tomorrow, Im buying myself flowers.
917592123700064256 2017-10-09 03:26:24 UTC <laurashredder> Lol at me for ever trying to act too cool for feelings.

917096748413280256 2017-10-08 18:37:58 UTC <laurashredder> Not totally sure this is true, but Id be convinced fairly easily that ppl are their worst selves while waiting for their Starbucks order
917058043694764033 2017-10-08 16:04:10 UTC <laurashredder> Its always weird when I get promotional emails like have you ever thought about being a dog owner/teacher/other thing you already are?
917005782771752962 2017-10-08 12:36:30 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot This is a very solid rule

916808066494058496 2017-10-07 23:30:51 UTC <laurashredder> If looks could kill, the dude that said she needs to shut up within 30 secs of her introducing a song before playing it would be   
916802828722753537 2017-10-07 23:10:02 UTC <laurashredder> FUCK DUDES THAT DONT GIVE FRONTWOMEN OF BANDS THE ROOM TO BANTER B/W SONGS THAT THEY GIVE FRONTMEN.
916791924375326720 2017-10-07 22:26:42 UTC <laurashredder> Not complaining about the 3.5 free beers I just consumed, but GD I have to pee

916127488132173825 2017-10-05 02:26:28 UTC <laurashredder> Wonder if there will ever be a day when I dont feel compelled to run my snarky/blunt emails by my boss before sending them
916126753281671168 2017-10-05 02:23:33 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot @RebsTay21 Yes, please. Cozying up to the fire for this fireside chat.
916125566973173766 2017-10-05 02:18:50 UTC <laurashredder> I had to admit. I have been a little heavy handed with my conditioner in the last week or so
916095519738548226 2017-10-05 00:19:26 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Thats what I bought in Easton back in March
916092231345475584 2017-10-05 00:06:22 UTC <laurashredder> And in a peak antithetical move from my previous tweet, I just registered for a conference the night before I leave for it.
916079048937402368 2017-10-05 23:13:59 UTC <laurashredder> YALL. I just unlocked a level of adulthood I was p sure would always elude me. I finished my shampoo & conditioner in the same shower.pic.twitter.com/Hg2O4P6uvE

915506373034733568 2017-10-04 09:18:23 UTC <laurashredder> This week is WILD. I'm on my second cup of coffee / I've responded to emails / & now I'm grading papers. Its not even 530, y'all. *yawn*
915356841139417088 2017-10-03 23:24:12 UTC <laurashredder> @Dannysaleemyo 
915356091147485184 2017-10-03 23:21:13 UTC <laurashredder> I tried to tell her she doesn't have to plan out her whole life today while smiling to myself, remembering how well I knew myself at 21.
915355809533620229 2017-10-03 23:20:06 UTC <laurashredder> Today, in advising meeting, I had one of my fav students talk about how ready she is to be a mom before hyperventilating about graduation
915354218042679297 2017-10-03 23:13:46 UTC <laurashredder> I am obviously not fully back to my prof game as I only () spent 10 hours on campus today, and yet I feel like death
915184305147654144 2017-10-03 11:58:36 UTC <laurashredder> I've been listening to Hop Along all morning while prepping for advising meetings, & this song is getting at me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VKYD3fGApE
914657439357849601 2017-10-01 01:05:01 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot @zona325 Def been there before. Sleep well!
914649126536654848 2017-10-01 00:31:59 UTC <laurashredder> @RebsTay21 @lcopperpot I mean, not decent people
914648496229289985 2017-10-01 00:29:29 UTC <laurashredder> I fear I've eaten too much curry
914648259225845760 2017-10-01 00:28:32 UTC <laurashredder> @RebsTay21 @lcopperpot Like "dots" without the d
914647969940623362 2017-10-01 00:27:24 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I can totally understand that! I think that's got to be an integral aspect of being a mom

914213473785192450 2017-09-30 19:40:52 UTC <laurashredder> @hfsisco Which is to say, I will have some killer mac and cheese later if y'all want some
914205713270022144 2017-09-30 19:10:01 UTC <laurashredder> Not even the amount I wanted to make mac and cheese earlier was worth this free for all
914205248893399040 2017-09-30 19:08:11 UTC <laurashredder> If I learn anything from today, I hope it is to never go grocery shopping on a Saturday afternoon ever again.
914154631403642881 2017-09-30 15:47:02 UTC <laurashredder> It's neatsville...https://g.co/kgs/Wka3av

913719338087206912 2017-09-29 10:57:20 UTC <laurashredder> Shoutout to another morning where I didn't have to set an alarm so it feels like I got to sleep in!
913583348018221057 2017-09-28 01:56:58 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Whoa. Hadn't see this :/

913357451885498368 2017-09-28 10:59:20 UTC <laurashredder> I just thought about how happy I am that I got to sleep in today/ I'm up, drinking coffee, & doing dishes before 7 am. 
913232709220208640 2017-09-27 02:43:39 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot What can I do to help ya, bb?

912983600668307456 2017-09-27 10:13:47 UTC <laurashredder> LOL to fems being told self-doubt is arrogant& self-centered& not useful to anyone else. As if others are why we should trust/love ourselves
912979770966708227 2017-09-27 09:58:34 UTC <laurashredder> If you don't occasionally wake up before sunrise & dance around to Sister Rosetta Tharpe in the dark, you & I have very different lives
912868565891665920 2017-09-26 02:36:41 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpothttps://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/912866633647099904

912817013046890496 2017-09-26 23:11:49 UTC <laurashredder> I'll always be here for conversations about elevating takeout fried rice w/a bag of spinach, eggs, sesame oil & seeds, & sriracha
912788658150887424 2017-09-26 21:19:09 UTC <laurashredder> @FatherJonMoisty This is perfect 
912788534783889410 2017-09-26 21:18:40 UTC <laurashredder> It's clear to me that what I thought would be an easy day was actually v stressful when I'm excited to mindlessly do dishes when I get home
912788198602035202 2017-09-26 21:17:19 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj I vote for some of each; then you can determine who your real friends/clients are by who has collected all four
912726784977899520 2017-09-26 17:13:17 UTC <laurashredder> Nearly stepped in the toilet when I went to flush by depressing the handle with my foot. That was one hell of a close one. 
912641300763234304 2017-09-26 11:33:36 UTC <laurashredder> Weird how when you wake up before sunrise, you can get five things crossed of your to-do list by breakfast.
912345547465543681 2017-09-25 15:58:23 UTC <laurashredder> Which is really just to say, in the small ways in which we can, we deserve to build moments of joy into our lives
912345026256044032 2017-09-25 15:56:19 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly very excited by it & looking forward to using my immersion blender later
912344262150381568 2017-09-25 15:53:17 UTC <laurashredder> Made up a recipe for a veggie-filled split pea soup. I'm sure my slow cooker'd be appreciative of yr spare good vibes for the next 6 hrs 
912331176567873538 2017-09-25 15:01:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Abso-freaking-lutely!!!! Love isn't finite & love begets love!
912329614923649025 2017-09-25 14:55:05 UTC <laurashredder> I'd like to let it be known that my "work hard, play hard" motto has been revised to "work hard, play hard, nap hard."
912267695718051841 2017-09-25 10:49:02 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot 
912090616548462593 2017-09-24 23:05:23 UTC <laurashredder> Y'ALL. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THESE FEELINGS?
912074647750967296 2017-09-24 22:01:56 UTC <laurashredder> Second shower of the day & my air conditioners are on. Are we sure it's September?
911943723717681155 2017-09-24 13:21:41 UTC <laurashredder> Evidence I might have been a lil tired when I was cleaning/putting stuff up last night...pic.twitter.com/cynFc0hqRg
911824013688754182 2017-09-23 05:26:00 UTC <laurashredder> Few things make me feel more like a responsible adult than drunkenly eating leftover Chinese food I drunkenly ordered the night before

911334803454267394 2017-09-22 21:02:03 UTC <laurashredder> I've lost all ability to estimate how long an activity is going to take, it seems
911224758657802241 2017-09-22 13:44:46 UTC <laurashredder> It's weird how time works, right?
911217892921892864 2017-09-22 13:17:29 UTC <laurashredder> It's a Spook School kind of morning #burnmasculinity
911202401230651395 2017-09-22 12:15:56 UTC <laurashredder> @2RoadsBrewing 
911202350395731968 2017-09-22 12:15:44 UTC <laurashredder> I'm nothing if not committed to good food/beer. Worked on soup til 12 last night, tweeting w/a local brewery by 8am. Come eat w/me, y'all
911200498367320064 2017-09-22 12:08:22 UTC <laurashredder> @2RoadsBrewing V cool beer finder program! But FYI...  it doesn't look like it's got the Plum Gose updated info- doesn't even say Playwright has it. 
911183445707169792 2017-09-22 11:00:37 UTC <laurashredder> Unpopular opinion: fall is the absolute worst for seasonal beer
911063825801207808 2017-09-21 03:05:17 UTC <laurashredder> @2RoadsBrewing I fell in love with your Plum Gose that I tried tonight at the Playwright. Where else can I find it?!
911017471754346497 2017-09-21 00:01:05 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot So unlike us
910999526546305025 2017-09-21 22:49:47 UTC <laurashredder> Going to Bed, Bath, & Beyond for one item, finding that item immediately, but then walking around the store for 30 mins & spending $80
910991044237504512 2017-09-21 22:16:04 UTC <laurashredder> Running into a random hookup from earlier this year & offering to help them get a stain out of their shirt, or (2/3
910990800770740224 2017-09-21 22:15:06 UTC <laurashredder> I'm not sure which of these actions I did in the last hour cuts more to the core of who I am... (1/3)
910963453527027712 2017-09-21 20:26:26 UTC <laurashredder> I really do miss having a brain most days
910885791232077827 2017-09-21 15:17:50 UTC <laurashredder> Just want to say I'm here for anyone who has a nervous bladder & works in a building where the toilets flush too fast to be helpful
910613668873871365 2017-09-20 21:16:31 UTC <laurashredder> I think I might be a little tired
910613520936562694 2017-09-20 21:15:56 UTC <laurashredder> But that's only true if you don't waste 10 mins looking around your normal lot for your car that isn't there
910613393702363136 2017-09-20 21:15:26 UTC <laurashredder> Then I walked to the wrong parking lot bc this AM I thought I'd be sneaky & park in a different lot that's easier/quicker to exit at 5PM
910612827815206912 2017-09-20 21:13:11 UTC <laurashredder> I just shut my computer/immediately reopened it to do something I needed to do before leaving the office three times in a row
910452869987471361 2017-09-20 10:37:34 UTC <laurashredder> Revisiting old eps of @MIMpodcast & "go listen to some Springsteen" is still my fav smarmy line to throw at someone from NJ.

908685128637059074 2017-09-15 13:33:11 UTC <laurashredder> I fully believe the most beautiful parts of our country are what others deem "fly-over"

906346682773884928 2017-09-08 02:41:02 UTC <laurashredder> Decided earlier that I'm going to stop denying how badly I believe "let's get weird" is an appropriate way of saying "I wanna hang w u"
906270442201247746 2017-09-08 21:38:05 UTC <laurashredder> Earlier this year, I decided "glow up" is a euphemism for when women get hard, & I've been giggling for months.
906270263683284992 2017-09-08 21:37:23 UTC <laurashredder> That way when people use it, you can laugh to yourself.

903835134708867072 2017-09-01 04:21:03 UTC <laurashredder> Why do I allow those I care about be flawed, see those flaws as evidence of their beauty & not a motive for someone to be mean to them...
903834687881269248 2017-09-01 04:19:16 UTC <laurashredder> Why do I let hurtful things go when they are directed at me?I'm wondering why I can't grant myself the same kindness that I grant others...
903834146052636673 2017-09-01 04:17:07 UTC <laurashredder> Do I not love myself? Do I not think I deserve as kind treatment as the people I care about?
903833976326025216 2017-09-01 04:16:27 UTC <laurashredder> Why is it that I'm open to forgiving so much more when a person wrongs/hurts me than when they wrong/hurt someone I love?

900004461757825024 2017-08-22 14:39:19 UTC <laurashredder> This, this, this. By @KimothyJoypic.twitter.com/dm4wyJHMhh
899959726309617665 2017-08-22 11:41:33 UTC <laurashredder> My fav part of following @AmberoniStevens on IG is how "celebrities are just like us!" her stories are. 
899947686325092352 2017-08-22 10:53:43 UTC <laurashredder> I present this as an example of why we should lift up our friends/the BS of backhanded compliments. Still thinking about this 2 days later
899946497722257408 2017-08-22 10:48:59 UTC <laurashredder> And also, if I were afraid of the ball, why would I sign up for a kickball league?
899946302858985474 2017-08-22 10:48:13 UTC <laurashredder> I know I'm not the most athletic person on the planet, but to hear he was worried I'd be "afraid of the ball" is a bit ego-bruising
899945958779363328 2017-08-22 10:46:51 UTC <laurashredder> This is dumb, but I'm still a little in my feelings about my friend saying he's "pleasantly surprised" by my performance at kickball on Sun
899943966434635778 2017-08-22 10:38:56 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot number four though (and 13 & 17 for a chuckle)https://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/899941970633773057
899932714266218497 2017-08-22 09:54:13 UTC <laurashredder> Starting off the last day of my 20's with a cold brew in the shower while listening to Justin Townes Earle 
899845864105152512 2017-08-21 04:09:06 UTC <laurashredder> I listened to Astral Weeks while my mom flew through the eclipse to hang with me todayhttps://twitter.com/tomhall/status/899658092526227457
899836500602486784 2017-08-21 03:31:54 UTC <laurashredder> Introduced my mom to @PlayingHouseUSA earlier this evening, & now she's half-sleeping thru S1E7. But when she's not sleeping, she's laughing
899714924296929280 2017-08-21 19:28:48 UTC <laurashredder> I wanna live in here 
899713289126653953 2017-08-21 19:22:18 UTC <laurashredder> I didn't look directly at the sun on campus, and my eyes still hurt. Can I get some workers comp, or?
899631411874996226 2017-08-21 13:56:57 UTC <laurashredder> S/O all the women faculty who "volunteered" to serve as their tables' scribes for this breakout session. I see your labor. I value y'all.

899285921262161920 2017-08-20 15:04:06 UTC <laurashredder> 20 year-old Laura would have killed to get yolks like these
899285693565984768 2017-08-20 15:03:11 UTC <laurashredder> When ppl ask me if I'm feeling uneasy about turning 30, I just laugh.   LIKE, NO. Look at what my grownass does the morning after a party...pic.twitter.com/wwJmfyyoVp
899278543825141760 2017-08-20 14:34:47 UTC <laurashredder> Feeling finehttps://g.co/kgs/6ete7J
899264575429902337 2017-08-20 13:39:16 UTC <laurashredder> Proof last night got out of hand: this is the last song that played on my Spotifypic.twitter.com/gZumP3gScX
899254679355310080 2017-08-20 12:59:57 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Poor Lucy. I hope she's feeling better this morning.
899147982964236288 2017-08-19 05:55:59 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot What kind of sick?
899147879616573440 2017-08-19 05:55:34 UTC <laurashredder> So the "kickball season kickoff party" was actually a surprise party for me, & I think I might officially be 30 even tho my bday is Wed
899029080254951426 2017-08-19 22:03:30 UTC <laurashredder> Just a little Rozwell Kid before I head to the pool partyhttps://youtu.be/Gg73v5TWH7o
899015737397739520 2017-08-19 21:10:29 UTC <laurashredder> Just went to my local beer & wine spot at the exact same time everyone who was getting out of church was in there
899005323570290688 2017-08-19 20:29:06 UTC <laurashredder> Reminds me of the time I was being a kid & too loud in a store & my mom turned around & YELLED "use your inside voice!"
899004059935485952 2017-08-19 20:24:05 UTC <laurashredder> I may have just said "can you please just walk like a normal human!?" to Liebs while on our afternoon stroll.

898894234513584130 2017-08-19 13:07:40 UTC <laurashredder> I love the She Shed in concept, but when u look at it through the lens of patriarchy & capitalism, it's a trap.   Listen to @callyrgf, y'all
898767819902300160 2017-08-18 04:45:21 UTC <laurashredder> My favorite thing about the voice memo I saved on my last night in NC is all the crickets I can hear in the background
898699813109325824 2017-08-18 00:15:07 UTC <laurashredder> @kckearns Omg I love this
898629608311898113 2017-08-18 19:36:09 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes I save up a bunch of snaps from my BFF so I can have like 5 mins with my godson
898622159043559425 2017-08-18 19:06:32 UTC <laurashredder> The way the rain has been mist today is pretty parallel to how my depression has been a migraine this week. It's still precipitation, y'all
898616450881028098 2017-08-18 18:43:52 UTC <laurashredder> Just ate half an avocado with a spoon, like one might with a kiwi. I'm surprised I'm able to make rent.
898614785310248960 2017-08-18 18:37:14 UTC <laurashredder> Today I got to deposit two checks, one for credit card rewards & one for my insurance claims for therapy. Feels VERY on brand.
898612432196706304 2017-08-18 18:27:53 UTC <laurashredder> Listened to the premiere episode of @Roughly this morning. Tentatively recommending it.
898597014900002817 2017-08-18 17:26:38 UTC <laurashredder> And then this comes on & this salad I'm making suddenly also has all the feelingspic.twitter.com/lfKX3mcbFs
898592717051109376 2017-08-18 17:09:33 UTC <laurashredder> @CabbythePoet Broom & then Swiffer! And then mop (for kitchen & bathroom)
898591638104100866 2017-08-18 17:05:16 UTC <laurashredder> Every week, I sweep my kitchen and bathroom floors. Every week, I'm surprised Liebs and I have any hair left on our bodies.
898587535454199808 2017-08-18 16:48:58 UTC <laurashredder> I'm done asking people their thoughts on the new Brand New album because I've now received the best, most correct answerpic.twitter.com/zaqBzuhNxD
898583357247942656 2017-08-18 16:32:21 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj Bring in a baby or fur baby to confirm
898575431502368783 2017-08-18 16:00:52 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 Absolutely, conversations like those have been (& keep being) real important to me
898574418049454080 2017-08-18 15:56:50 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 I'm down to talk about this with ya whenevskis, if you'd ever want to dialogue about it
898567842190184449 2017-08-18 15:30:42 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 If it's doing that for people, I'm happy to hear it.
898565846208925696 2017-08-18 15:22:46 UTC <laurashredder> I'd "@" Tina Fey if she were on here   S/O @RosehoundDesign for this perfect patchpic.twitter.com/iDi0O4hyYa
898563318108962817 2017-08-18 15:12:44 UTC <laurashredder> Y'all, there's a better video than the Tina Fey one, where we get to see Kindergarten Cop hold a bobble head of Drumpf & say "tumor."pic.twitter.com/qUyw6qw8ru
898560464241606656 2017-08-18 15:01:23 UTC <laurashredder> But, like, can't we practice sheet-caking &&& show up to fight white supremacists?
898555371266220033 2017-08-18 14:41:09 UTC <laurashredder> Heck yes, root vegetables are the best vegetables.http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/17/544151627/found-1-carrot-diamond-ring?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20170817
898530796872634368 2017-08-18 13:03:30 UTC <laurashredder> @tabernacleteeth I feel like Leah Remini's docuseries should be required television
898530343858446336 2017-08-18 13:01:42 UTC <laurashredder> @ashley_kaz (PLUS: all that you are is so fucking wonderful )
898529831423533056 2017-08-18 12:59:40 UTC <laurashredder> @ashley_kaz But also, like YOU know what she lost. And there is also value in knowing you've left someone go who didn't see/appreciate all that you are
898319268890136576 2017-08-17 23:02:58 UTC <laurashredder> Why does pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese taste so good?
897974236983304192 2017-08-16 00:11:56 UTC <laurashredder> Ate lunch at noon. Got a mid-afternoon migraine. Haven't eaten since (obviously) & also not hungry but know I should eat. Wtf do I do?
897858689805189120 2017-08-16 16:32:47 UTC <laurashredder> But also! I tried to the new vegan Caribbean joint in New Haven yesterday, and these leftovers are making my whole day brighter.
897852742299004928 2017-08-16 16:09:09 UTC <laurashredder> I've got a couple wicked bruises I can't account for, but at least my tattoo & bug bites are healing? Idk, my legs are a mess rn y'all.
897827487211827201 2017-08-16 14:28:48 UTC <laurashredder> @cassandraintroy I feel this. Someone stole my stuffed Big Bird out of my mom's station wagon 
897825257456885761 2017-08-16 14:19:56 UTC <laurashredder> Proud to announce I just finished off the pizza I ordered on Monday.
897803293715570688 2017-08-16 12:52:40 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I also recommend this episode to everyone who hasn't listened to it yet (or in a while)pic.twitter.com/qCfFnO26hi
897801695153070081 2017-08-16 12:46:19 UTC <laurashredder> Because then they might tell you about Icelandic necropants, which is definitely knowledge worth having
897801545974198273 2017-08-16 12:45:43 UTC <laurashredder> & if you're ever concerned that someone might misinterpret your enthusiasm for wanting to wear their skin as a suit, you should just say so
897800724867932160 2017-08-16 12:42:27 UTC <laurashredder> Update: We met up for lunch, & it was great. We're friends now. We've already talked mouth guards, disappointing our grad advisors, & more!https://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/891008899029094400
897797104512454656 2017-08-16 12:28:04 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot It may feel hard (or impossible sometimes), but believing it so solves nothing. It simply makes us feel better when we don't intervene.
897796405271687172 2017-08-16 12:25:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot & we have to mean it when we say we don't stand for it. We have to be willing to protest, call our reps, & stop showing up for racists
897796065486925824 2017-08-16 12:23:56 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot We are responsible for breaking the silences in white rooms, for pointing out fallacies & hatred, for saying we won't stand for it
897795314937102336 2017-08-16 12:20:57 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot It was a crutch I used in the past, & I saw it hurt people I care about. I can't fall for it anymore. When it's safe to dissent, I do
897794961223147521 2017-08-16 12:19:33 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot While I understand the siren song of "there's no convincing them," & I definitely appreciate the need to balance activism w/self-care...
897794555373924352 2017-08-16 12:17:56 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot It's also become big for me to make sure that I'm clear about how I feel about their racism in front of their (or any) children
897793980137709570 2017-08-16 12:15:39 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot For me, it's about being willing to dissent when it'd be more comfortable to stay silent, to question their logic, to explain my "viewpoint"
897655598690574340 2017-08-15 03:05:47 UTC <laurashredder> How does the Hallmark channel package expect me to decide between Murder, She Wrote and The Golden Girls?
897546146280857600 2017-08-15 19:50:51 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot Would also like to know this 
897463883086139393 2017-08-15 14:23:58 UTC <laurashredder> The toughest lessons I'm still learning: amends-making can be selfish. The needs of who we've wronged must be at the center of this, not us.
897453149891555328 2017-08-15 13:41:19 UTC <laurashredder> When your song comes on, but your trying to play it coolpic.twitter.com/XsSUt9DM2e
897452320077762561 2017-08-15 13:38:01 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot That's a reasonable question
897451540893519874 2017-08-15 13:34:55 UTC <laurashredder> So glad it's the radio edit; would hate for the youth to come across the original cut lolpic.twitter.com/mO0dnFKvDJ

897215637889699844 2017-08-14 21:57:32 UTC <laurashredder> Ordered pizza < 30 mins ago & was told 45 mins - hr. Just got a call from the delivery guy that he's outside & I was still in my towel OOPS
897206752692899841 2017-08-14 21:22:13 UTC <laurashredder> @hfsisco Or the "modeling type" ??? 
897185901855596545 2017-08-14 19:59:22 UTC <laurashredder> A woman giving out samples at Stop & Shop just told me I look like a "creative type" & asked me to take a picture of her serving @hfsisco 
896910436636950529 2017-08-13 01:44:46 UTC <laurashredder> @daralonx Same. Except replace IPAs with a 13 hr solo road trip & Elliot Smith with Diet Cig
896909796896591872 2017-08-13 01:42:14 UTC <laurashredder> Home, cuddling w/my pup, listening to Diet Cig, & trying to feel whatever breaks through this exhaustion.
896758519076147200 2017-08-13 15:41:06 UTC <laurashredder> 44 mins ago, I stopped at a gas station in VA. Since then I've driven through WV & MD, &  now I'm in PA. 4 hours in VA, then 4 states in <1
896696702165540864 2017-08-13 11:35:28 UTC <laurashredder> Just took an hour nap at a rest stop in the middle of Virginia. Now I'm hunting for coffee.
896654247328198657 2017-08-13 08:46:46 UTC <laurashredder> Out of Tennessee before sunrise 
896637879769866240 2017-08-13 07:41:43 UTC <laurashredder> Smell ya later, North Carolina 
896501338309316609 2017-08-12 22:39:09 UTC <laurashredder> In total for dinner, I had .5 an avocado, 1 piece of bread, 2 eggs, and 3 beers. I'M LIVING LARGE, Y'ALL.

896501050848321536 2017-08-12 22:38:01 UTC <laurashredder> I just killed a wasp.  I know it was kill or be stung, but I still feel p bad about it.
896455473641259010 2017-08-12 19:36:54 UTC <laurashredder> W/the flat, I had to reverse my in-town plans & my hike. So now I'm hiking in the midday sun, trying to remind myself how much I love sweat
896421105753362432 2017-08-12 17:20:20 UTC <laurashredder> Thinking about how ridiculous homophones are. Like, aren't there enough unique sounds possible for us to avoid these potential confusions?
896413874915880963 2017-08-12 16:51:37 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey It was quite frantic at first, but I quickly resigned myself to pooping in the dark
896411384531087360 2017-08-12 16:41:43 UTC <laurashredder> Am I alone in thinkjng that aftercare is a thing that the tattoo community would have figured out by 2005?
896411126694641665 2017-08-12 16:40:41 UTC <laurashredder> First, it was A&D ointment, then aquaphor, and now no ointment at all for the first couple of days.
896410842929004545 2017-08-12 16:39:34 UTC <laurashredder> I've been getting tattooed since I was 18, and one of the things I find most curious is how suggested aftercare has changed over the years.
896399801956388864 2017-08-12 15:55:41 UTC <laurashredder> The most incredible thing about a good book store is that there is never enough time to explore all it has to offer
896390043471884289 2017-08-12 15:16:55 UTC <laurashredder> I need to stop being surprised that I can I always find a bookstore in a new city without a map. They simply call to me.
896386281466474496 2017-08-12 15:01:58 UTC <laurashredder> Just found #newhavennoir at this independent bookseller in Asheville and actually squealedpic.twitter.com/8AT0qOGHGE  at Malaprop's Bookstore/Cafe

896366489439264768 2017-08-12 13:43:19 UTC <laurashredder> S/O to motion-sensor lights in public restrooms where no amount of flailing your arms about in the stall will get the lights to come back on
896352194491973632 2017-08-12 12:46:31 UTC <laurashredder> Coming off an early morning mountain hike & learning that @RaychJackson won NUPIC: the world just got a little closer to righting itself 
896350744500195328 2017-08-12 12:40:45 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot SUCCESS! 
896334780605878272 2017-08-12 11:37:19 UTC <laurashredder> Second night in a row that I'm in bed by 9. 
896165063295238147 2017-08-11 00:22:55 UTC <laurashredder> How many peanut butter & jelly sandwiches is too many peanut butter & jelly sandwiches for one sitting?
896152049452146688 2017-08-11 23:31:12 UTC <laurashredder> In case you were still trying to figure out what to get me for my birthday...https://twitter.com/lushcosmetics/status/896151355034816512

895668260431114240 2017-08-10 15:28:48 UTC <laurashredder> There should a rule that all public restrooms have a hook for coats, purses, or whatever you don't want to put on the dirty bathroom floor

895293015727763456 2017-08-09 14:37:43 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot this brazen act was made possible by you btw
895290915077713920 2017-08-09 14:29:22 UTC <laurashredder> Nothing makes me feel more like I'm making enough money to have more in savings than I do like throwing away an old bra
895287342805778432 2017-08-09 14:15:10 UTC <laurashredder> I've already had two cups of coffee, and I'm thinking about a third.

895096349225619456 2017-08-08 01:36:14 UTC <laurashredder> @GlowNetflix @lcopperpot Hahah. When I watched that scene, I was mostly impressed that the women seemed some comfortable in them in a public place
895015375519309824 2017-08-08 20:14:28 UTC <laurashredder> @thereaIbanksy @Brox24204176 This wasn't AT ALL in reference to him.

895008620815015936 2017-08-08 19:47:38 UTC <laurashredder> Why do I immediately feel like maybe I'm simply not whatever enough to be the kind of person who reads business magazines?
895008151132663809 2017-08-08 19:45:46 UTC <laurashredder> But inside a storm of misogynist self-doubt started brewing, which has got to be one of more insidious part of gender norms
895007540219719681 2017-08-08 19:43:20 UTC <laurashredder> I just smiled and said "nope! I'm trying to decide if I should hire a robot."
895007301400133632 2017-08-08 19:42:23 UTC <laurashredder> When I gave him a quizzical look, he said "I'd just assume you'd want one with recipes or make-up tips."
895007152582078465 2017-08-08 19:41:48 UTC <laurashredder> He legit was like "whoa- wouldn't have expected you to pick that one!"

894769914216562688 2017-08-07 03:59:06 UTC <laurashredder> @TylerWMcAlister Just, like, encouraging you to check in with yourself - did it go well / do you feel pretty okay?
894769370202853376 2017-08-07 03:56:56 UTC <laurashredder> @TylerWMcAlister That sounds pretty honest
894768755787616260 2017-08-07 03:54:30 UTC <laurashredder> @TylerWMcAlister Respond to whichever feels right (we now find ourselves in a choose-your-own-adventure conversation)
894768467496194051 2017-08-07 03:53:21 UTC <laurashredder> @TylerWMcAlister 1st response:   2nd response: Alone? If so, am I wrong to assume that means you're struggling to be honest w/yourself right now?
894767153269755904 2017-08-07 03:48:07 UTC <laurashredder> @TylerWMcAlister Seemingly for like the last 5 hours? At least, on my little plot of land.

894730072283688960 2017-08-07 01:20:47 UTC <laurashredder> Hey, so this is weird, but sometimes being honest about how you're feeling actually works out and feels pretty okay too

888799595500666880 2017-07-22 16:35:11 UTC <laurashredder> Here's to a detoxifying face mask and a glass of wine w/your best friend on a Saturday afternoon 
888796254582558721 2017-07-22 16:21:54 UTC <laurashredder> Nine years later, and I mostly wish I could remember the disgusting story I had to tell him.pic.twitter.com/KkBQscOPGA
888778791446773761 2017-07-22 15:12:31 UTC <laurashredder> Singing along to John Denver with @lcopperpot to Everett is the exact moment I came to Ohio for this trip.
888583815194701825 2017-07-21 02:17:45 UTC <laurashredder> How long is too long to've gone w/o seeing ur hair stylist before it's better that they think u r dead than have to explain where u've been?
888553566494904320 2017-07-21 00:17:33 UTC <laurashredder> I don't understand why my fav thing about Fado is that it smells like the cigar shop two doors down when I actually hate the smell of cigars
888417525171720195 2017-07-21 15:16:58 UTC <laurashredder> Tfw everyone in the house has a cold so your bff starts reading about "slimy goo," looks you straight in the eye, & just says "mucus"
888407675653980160 2017-07-21 14:37:50 UTC <laurashredder> Got to S/O my dog and my campus, while pacing around @lcopperpot's bedroom looking like this. I'm a professional hahahapic.twitter.com/wBhLqB99hK
888383805983252483 2017-07-21 13:02:59 UTC <laurashredder> About to be on the radio as a health comm expert. Last time I did this, I got to talk about anal sex. Can I top that? Let's see.
888371365266558977 2017-07-21 12:13:33 UTC <laurashredder> My parents are in Florida again; Mom keeps sending me pics; this is all I want to send backpic.twitter.com/nKUBF58YmS
888256348948840448 2017-07-20 04:36:31 UTC <laurashredder> Thankful to have friends who will talk about sex, poop, and death all in the same evening.
888234834581221376 2017-07-20 03:11:01 UTC <laurashredder> Cha Cha real smooth
888234774728499201 2017-07-20 03:10:47 UTC <laurashredder> Laughing about how hilarious it would be to stoically recite the lyrics to the Cha Cha Slide the first time you have sex with a new partner
888117082809786371 2017-07-20 19:23:07 UTC <laurashredder> If you've ever wondered if the word "cum" is on any .gov pages, please know the CDC is very hip: "...even if he does not ejaculate (cum)."
888109816349990912 2017-07-20 18:54:15 UTC <laurashredder> Just asked Everett if he thinks the rain is going to hurt the rhubarb, because apparently I'm my own grandma.
887841086747627520 2017-07-19 01:06:25 UTC <laurashredder> Earlier today, I texted "I'm actually not afraid of feelings," and almost believed it.
887840459921518593 2017-07-19 01:03:55 UTC <laurashredder> I haven't had a milkshake from UDF every day I've been in Ohio. I barely recognize myself anymore.
887826523822186496 2017-07-19 00:08:32 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz @connorstorms I feel strongly that this is purest form of hate
887529657674936324 2017-07-18 04:28:54 UTC <laurashredder> When people say no, it's a pretty good idea to listen to them.
887517400182259712 2017-07-18 03:40:12 UTC <laurashredder> You know what will really fuck with ya? Realizing you no longer fit in the city that taught you who you are, who you want to be
887514593186263040 2017-07-18 03:29:02 UTC <laurashredder> Idk when this happened, but Columbus really isn't my home anymore 
887496708262952960 2017-07-18 02:17:58 UTC <laurashredder> How many flowers do I need tattooed on my body before I can just lie on the ground and become a garden?
887477730169815040 2017-07-18 01:02:34 UTC <laurashredder> Writing Wrongs' rookie don't really sound like a rookie, y'all. Just a heads up for those going to NPS 2017.
887437078828642305 2017-07-18 22:21:02 UTC <laurashredder> Like, sweat makes our bodies more present, more top-of-mind in any given interaction. How is that not appealing?
887436641882824704 2017-07-18 22:19:17 UTC <laurashredder> Third, I actually find sweat pretty physically appealing on humans who I find attractive
887435963919683584 2017-07-18 22:16:36 UTC <laurashredder> Second, I love how sweat feels earned, especially if I've been working hard (but also for just surviving heat, lol)
887435636495572993 2017-07-18 22:15:18 UTC <laurashredder> First, I'm in awe of our bodies whenever I actually think about process and function of sweating.
887435411961851904 2017-07-18 22:14:24 UTC <laurashredder> I've been thinking about sweating a lot lately. I really don't understand why sweat is treated as unattractive/gross.
887380514142904323 2017-07-18 18:36:15 UTC <laurashredder> @ethantrivera I mean, I don't put it on to feel anything other than nostalgic, but it's one of the few albums that actually fully takes me back to 2001
887376271013031936 2017-07-18 18:19:24 UTC <laurashredder> @ethantrivera @daralonx so v wrong
887374429478674432 2017-07-18 18:12:05 UTC <laurashredder> I may've gushed about @ethantrivera on IG a little, but I also want the world to know he trashed Your Favorite Weapon last night like a goon
887359598994259968 2017-07-18 17:13:09 UTC <laurashredder> That little nugget of knowledge is honestly so big. It feels like I've won. I'm free right now, y'all.
887359183837966336 2017-07-18 17:11:30 UTC <laurashredder> I've been laughing throughout this entire shopping trip bc I finally truly believe my body isn't the problem- the cut of the dresses are.
887356740588769282 2017-07-18 17:01:47 UTC <laurashredder> Leave it to @Topshop to make a cute dress that makes my boobs look both small & saggy while also allowing my lower arms to hulk out.pic.twitter.com/IUWU58NwzV
887338236774895616 2017-07-18 15:48:16 UTC <laurashredder> I assume I've fallen into an alternate universe where everything is backwards if bathing suit shopping is now easier than dress shopping.
887337978787397632 2017-07-18 15:47:14 UTC <laurashredder> It's reversible, y'all.pic.twitter.com/oQiXAHrbC6
887337572971810816 2017-07-18 15:45:37 UTC <laurashredder> Trying to find a dress to wear to a wedding this weekend. Instead I've successfully found a bathing suit I don't need but actually love.
887303696178130945 2017-07-18 13:31:01 UTC <laurashredder> "I can't marry her, she's my friend."   "Yeah, that would be so weird."  Lion King with its questionable lessons on love.
887123124017397760 2017-07-17 01:33:29 UTC <laurashredder> I bought Nothing Gold Can Stay in 1999, and now I'm seeing @newfoundglory play in my favorite venue in my favorite city. Life is so weird.
887031468312203265 2017-07-17 19:29:16 UTC <laurashredder> My main goal is to have Lisa retweet every one of my tweets today.
887029645174075392 2017-07-17 19:22:02 UTC <laurashredder> @VonBradstein: I remember learning about memes before they really existed   @lcopperpot: what do you meme? (Busts out laughing at herself)
887026906943631361 2017-07-17 19:11:09 UTC <laurashredder> And now he has made us flatbread. @VonBradstein has become quite the chef!pic.twitter.com/GKB57WafWS

886782466748534784 2017-07-16 02:59:50 UTC <laurashredder> Today, I watched my mom sing & dance to Despacito like it was that Rob Thomas/Santana joint from 1999.   I'll forever be her biggest fan.
886430032901677056 2017-07-15 03:39:23 UTC <laurashredder> Been going through old photo albums the last couple of days, and I'm proud to say my fashion sense peaked around 1994.pic.twitter.com/ybn26pjnqO

885118628328341504 2017-07-12 12:48:20 UTC <laurashredder> And, like, how does that affect me? Why do I care? How does that judgment fit in with my feminism?

881199211550838788 2017-07-01 17:13:58 UTC <laurashredder> How come when I tell men I'm nervous about something, they usually reassure me I'm attractive before even asking what I'm nervous about?

880156996351258624 2017-06-28 20:12:35 UTC <laurashredder> I really wish more scripted TV showed people doing stuff we actually do, like dancing in our kitchens while eating chips & guac.
879882354323533825 2017-06-27 02:01:15 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly, Liebs is my whole heart.

878631692998725632 2017-06-24 15:11:34 UTC <laurashredder> This week, I've had hour+ long convos with two of my very best friends, and let me tell you: shit. is. life. affirming.
878369240411250688 2017-06-23 21:48:40 UTC <laurashredder> Just sprayed perfume in my armpit, and it stings sooooo bad 
878366731353247744 2017-06-23 21:38:42 UTC <laurashredder> I vaguely remember life before lipstick, but from what I can recall, it was bleak at best.
878366598905577472 2017-06-23 21:38:11 UTC <laurashredder> Very thankful for finally feeling like the "type of woman" who wears lipstick.

878212810093678593 2017-06-23 11:27:04 UTC <laurashredder> @xleja Sounds like a dream groomsman to me
878209808817561600 2017-06-23 11:15:09 UTC <laurashredder> lol to second guessing even the most basic texts, such as "hope your meeting goes well today!"

877306657453338628 2017-06-20 23:26:21 UTC <laurashredder> But like why do @lushcosmetics shampoos have sulfates 
876939627478872064 2017-06-19 23:07:54 UTC <laurashredder> Sugarcult comes through my speakers & I'm immediately 14, having never kissed, let alone loved, but I still FEEL every word of Memory.

876895878837096448 2017-06-19 20:14:04 UTC <laurashredder> Is it weird to take a bath at 4PM on a Monday?
876883992104112133 2017-06-19 19:26:50 UTC <laurashredder> Just woke up to the sun on my face, wrapped up in a blanket on my hammock with absolutely no idea what time it was. Bless summer.

876031488172728320 2017-06-17 10:59:17 UTC <laurashredder> Listening to Max Brooks on The Nerdist & just spit my coffee out laughing at " and we all know the mark of a great writer is punctuality."

875498133534408705 2017-06-15 23:39:55 UTC <laurashredder> If reading Modern Romance has taught me anything, it's that @azizansari doesn't care for Argentine cuisine.
875478574719021056 2017-06-15 22:22:12 UTC <laurashredder> Is it possible to be too obsessed with the crown I crafted for myself this afternoon?pic.twitter.com/jQrurW5f8x

875080747589263363 2017-06-14 20:01:23 UTC <laurashredder> If you'd told 15 year old me that 15 years later, I'd be listening to NFG while relaxing in a hammock I bought and put together myself...
874977385829064704 2017-06-14 13:10:39 UTC <laurashredder> Proud to announce I just dropped a raspberry, covered in yogurt, on my pj shirt bc I got hungry but still wanted to read in bed.

874575401758187521 2017-06-13 10:33:19 UTC <laurashredder> And when I interrupted to be like, "yeah, I know who Derrick Rose is,"  he got real defensive, like "well, I didn't know!"
874575192776986624 2017-06-13 10:32:29 UTC <laurashredder> In conversation w/a dude last night, and he's like, "yeah, and Derrick Rose, oh wait- he's a basketball player, so anyway, Derrick..."

874022196825522177 2017-06-11 21:55:04 UTC <laurashredder> However many jalapeo slices would have been the right number for my pho, I had one more than that. Not upset about it though.

854637424185626624 2017-04-19 10:06:54 UTC <laurashredder> If I got up & showered at 515, did I then lose that adult status by rewarding myself by laying in bed/a "peek at twitter" for 30 mins after?

853940330839891969 2017-04-17 11:56:54 UTC <laurashredder> Literally said aloud "show me what you've got Monday," 10 minutes ago, so it makes sense my neighborhood grocer is closed when I need them.
853764391468232704 2017-04-16 00:17:47 UTC <laurashredder> How is it that I'm nearly 30 and I still regularly cut myself shaving?   I've been doing this for over half my life now.

852897255715721216 2017-04-14 14:52:06 UTC <laurashredder> The @TODAYshow isn't even over yet, and I just woke up from a nap. It really is a Good Friday.
852852567394721793 2017-04-14 11:54:31 UTC <laurashredder> In front of a room full of their colleagues with just one comment.   UGH.
852852385886199808 2017-04-14 11:53:48 UTC <laurashredder> Thought the comment was targeted at us, individually. I'm still salty about how an awful guy can make 2 strong, smart women feel scolded...
852851981324517376 2017-04-14 11:52:12 UTC <laurashredder> Yesterday in a work meeting, a dude said a rude, unnecessary thing. After a close friend & I were debriefing about it & realized we both...

852847570087022594 2017-04-14 11:34:40 UTC <laurashredder> One of the ways I know I've started to make CT my home: I'm saying "I love you" to my friends out here on a more regular basis now.
852726632574050304 2017-04-13 03:34:06 UTC <laurashredder> Going to bed without setting an alarm for the first Friday in way too long.  I feel like too much like a demigod.
852693546134102016 2017-04-13 01:22:38 UTC <laurashredder> I'm the kind of bitch who starts a DVRed show & then goes in the kitchen to do dishes, knowing full well I'm going to have to restart it.

851884487445270530 2017-04-11 19:47:43 UTC <laurashredder> Today I've played plinko, written 2 letters of rec, graded a stack of papers, gotten a mani, & laughed so much. Good day to be a prof.
851880106012401665 2017-04-11 19:30:19 UTC <laurashredder> Wearing a shirt w/the word abortion on it is an experience. Makes me feel like I'm not doing enough to normalize talking about abortions tbh

850828962800553985 2017-04-08 21:53:27 UTC <laurashredder> I'm the type of prof who will have a phone meeting w/u on a Saturday if u have ??s, but I'll probably be straightening my hair during it. 
850806402981474304 2017-04-08 20:23:48 UTC <laurashredder> Watching the big lebowski, drinking black coffee, and hoping to be done with this grading before my next birthday.

850460950687821824 2017-04-07 21:31:06 UTC <laurashredder> I am not asking for much. I just want a bouquet of french fries to greet me the next time I open my door.
850410702972047360 2017-04-07 18:11:26 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes I talk about my friends and beam with pride. Sorta confirms I might be doing this whole friendship thing pretty okay, right?

842739145755824128 2017-03-17 14:07:24 UTC <laurashredder> He might be a baby, but he farts like an elephant 
842738956525625347 2017-03-17 14:06:39 UTC <laurashredder> The king of toots is at it again.
842737494479323136 2017-03-17 14:00:50 UTC <laurashredder> I love the tissue between my armpit and breast (ya know, that bit we are told is "fat" & "ugly"), and I try to tell it as much every day.
842737098620878848 2017-03-17 13:59:16 UTC <laurashredder> When's the last time you praised a part of your body you've been told not to like?   I highly recommend it.
842731792260128768 2017-03-17 13:38:11 UTC <laurashredder> When the baby is sleeping & you get a text that says it's okay to come in the room & talk but you just tweet at each other instead
842731565306314754 2017-03-17 13:37:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot sweet, sweet dirt
842731421236117504 2017-03-17 13:36:42 UTC <laurashredder> TFW u forget ur BFF's husband drew a penis on the bottom of her foot last night until she puts her feet up on the couch the next morning
842725832460288000 2017-03-17 13:14:30 UTC <laurashredder> I miss PNC Park so much. If you can get tickets/go to a game, you absolutely should. Go Bucs!https://twitter.com/pirates/status/842724714241974272
842557197909458944 2017-03-16 02:04:24 UTC <laurashredder> Currently playing a game where we set a timer for 4 mins at a time & write down every country from a given continent we can think of.
842536234211794947 2017-03-16 00:41:06 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz is this before or after he eats the magic spiders? It's been too long.
842535418633601024 2017-03-16 00:37:52 UTC <laurashredder> Used Bobby Flay's recipe to roast golden beets tonight, and I am now more in love with beets than I ever thought possible.
842533275054825476 2017-03-16 00:29:20 UTC <laurashredder> So @JessRiz tweeting about rewatching #buffythevampireslayer is my fav thing on the internet. If u aren't following her, u r fucking up.
842532545795444738 2017-03-16 00:26:27 UTC <laurashredder> @Berniewatson 
842524134047469568 2017-03-16 23:53:01 UTC <laurashredder> Maybe talked too much about my favorite new human at lunch with @ethantrivera today.
842446093946368002 2017-03-16 18:42:55 UTC <laurashredder> Lots of women I love, respect, and pray for in Texas this weekend. Take care them, Dallas .
842445369212604418 2017-03-16 18:40:02 UTC <laurashredder> I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I think I fully became an adult the day I realized I like the taste of black coffee.

842395230460604416 2017-03-16 15:20:48 UTC <laurashredder> I always know I've been in CT too long when the amount of alcohol available in stores here seems excessive.
842381506664402944 2017-03-16 14:26:16 UTC <laurashredder> Like, oh, this is a new level of vulnerable I'm feeling.
842381214069731328 2017-03-16 14:25:06 UTC <laurashredder> When someone you haven't spent time with in years says "you still wear the same perfume," &  you feel more seen than... ever, maybe?

842184046943842304 2017-03-15 01:21:38 UTC <laurashredder> Feel like my TL is 60% politics/social justice, 15% jokes, 15% nerd shit, and 10% surreal absurdism. Which is also pretty much my life.
842174820678787072 2017-03-15 00:44:58 UTC <laurashredder> @_joseolivarez 
842145724578070530 2017-03-15 22:49:21 UTC <laurashredder> please wear a Halloween mask (of a fox or other natural chicken predator if possible) & get a friend to film the massacre

842122981056892928 2017-03-15 21:18:59 UTC <laurashredder> Couldn't imagine a better way to roll from afternoon into evening than Everett napping on my chest.
842114765136764928 2017-03-15 20:46:20 UTC <laurashredder> preach
842099450940129281 2017-03-15 19:45:29 UTC <laurashredder> Saw him do the show live in CT & very glad it's on Netflix now.
842098762591965184 2017-03-15 19:42:45 UTC <laurashredder> Laughing at @birbigs' #thankgodforjokes for the 10th time at least.
842075283641491457 2017-03-15 18:09:27 UTC <laurashredder> Alright. We are down for our second nap of the day. Let's say I get an hour. Which would you watch on mute
842045093464936448 2017-03-15 16:09:29 UTC <laurashredder> Evidence of toxic masculinity: the lyrics to Make a Man Out of You from Mulan.
842040366324948993 2017-03-15 15:50:42 UTC <laurashredder> Colors of the Wind is a top ten Disney song.
842037802900545536 2017-03-15 15:40:31 UTC <laurashredder> Shortish nap, and now we are singing songs from Mulan and Aladdin 
842021882673172480 2017-03-15 14:37:15 UTC <laurashredder> I never want to do anything else but relive the moment he put his head on my shoulder and fell asleep over and over and over again.
842020356697296896 2017-03-15 14:31:11 UTC <laurashredder> We ate, and now we are napping. This is seriously the most precious moment of my life.
841860453559074816 2017-03-14 03:55:47 UTC <laurashredder> You're never more aware of how inadvertently loud you are until there is a sleeping baby in the next room.
841821851449995264 2017-03-14 01:22:24 UTC <laurashredder> @kckearns wish we were watching this together. Your maniacal laughter is my spirit animal.
841820574599004160 2017-03-14 01:17:19 UTC <laurashredder> "Trump Chicken" Balloon is the best three-word phrase to come out of us living through this administrationpic.twitter.com/vjKyIgIT3k
841818177948549124 2017-03-14 01:07:48 UTC <laurashredder> It's unclear to me why the countdown stopped
841816549879083008 2017-03-14 01:01:20 UTC <laurashredder> I want to live in a world where the White House doesn't comment on how "desperate" a TV show is for ratings
841807132680937473 2017-03-14 00:23:55 UTC <laurashredder> Based on the five or so episodes of The Newsroom I've seen, I feel like I have a pretty good idea what's happening at @maddow right now.
841802450801680384 2017-03-14 00:05:18 UTC <laurashredder> Today my main man, Everett, turned six months old. Beyond thankful to be here to witness to his extraordinary little human-ness. 
841531383625482240 2017-03-13 06:08:11 UTC <laurashredder> Ever make a decision and IMMEDIATELY regret it?

840932918079942656 2017-03-12 14:30:06 UTC <laurashredder> I love @CBSSunday & I'm sure Dr LaPook is a good dude, but I just spit my coffee out laughing bc I thought he called himself "LaPoop."
840618888282963968 2017-03-11 17:42:15 UTC <laurashredder> @kyletolle I'm in Ohio and thinking of you. Proud to be your friend, dude.
840565934544830464 2017-03-11 14:11:50 UTC <laurashredder> The latest episode of #TheMagicians must have really got to me. I just had the most disturbing dream, feat. bloody wooden spoons.
840425042836111360 2017-03-10 04:51:59 UTC <laurashredder> Introduced my brother to @PWRBTTMBAND tonight, so I think I've done everything I can for him as his big sis now
840424103492345856 2017-03-10 04:48:15 UTC <laurashredder> Nearly convinced that tinnitus is contagious

840298666124533760 2017-03-10 20:29:48 UTC <laurashredder> Just ate the top of a sesame bun, lettuce, tomato, and pickles bc this bacon cheeseburger is NOT the fish sandwich I ordered.

839861917829201920 2017-03-09 15:34:19 UTC <laurashredder> U ever get so disgusted w/ur life choices that u say stuff aloud like "I can't believe I just muted 'Jolene' to listen to that voicemail" ?
839834838731481088 2017-03-09 13:46:43 UTC <laurashredder> Why did I ever stop listening to @Pink?

839591456981528576 2017-03-08 21:39:36 UTC <laurashredder> .@Upworthy said Girl Scout cookies are a legit way to show solidarity with those on strike today, and I listened.
839585797766537216 2017-03-08 21:17:07 UTC <laurashredder> @TIDAL The "Independent Women" playlist on @tidal for #InternationalWomensDay is doing the good work.

839324693165391874 2017-03-07 03:59:35 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot usually if I don't make it in the morning, I think about my unmade bed randomly throughout the day. It's so obnoxious.
839323824814444544 2017-03-07 03:56:08 UTC <laurashredder> On average, how many days do you wear a bra before you put it in the hamper? Asking for a friend.
839323520261840896 2017-03-07 03:54:55 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I can't get into an unmade bed and fall asleep without some real anxiety
839323367903739907 2017-03-07 03:54:19 UTC <laurashredder> But don't worry folks; this isn't a body snatchers thing. I just made my bed at 10:50PM bc u know I'm not getting into a messy bed.
839322534852046849 2017-03-07 03:51:00 UTC <laurashredder> Proof of how shit I feel. this like the fifth day in a row I haven't made my bed before leaving for work.pic.twitter.com/bomEbq9bFS
839321063351848961 2017-03-07 03:45:09 UTC <laurashredder> Needed some social time despite the sickness: two beers w/some colleagues & a phone call w/a HS friend, and I'm feeling way more me again.
839155509957656576 2017-03-07 16:47:18 UTC <laurashredder> Not super stoked that I hadn't had anything to eat until just now, but very happy it was a Girl Scout cookie.
839095098386305028 2017-03-07 12:47:15 UTC <laurashredder> @goodghostbill but like, we know this isn't real. Puns are proof god loves us, right?https://twitter.com/kalvinmacleod/status/838787162325790720
839093801884987392 2017-03-07 12:42:06 UTC <laurashredder> Trying to not inconvenience anyone is a waste of time when I'm not sick. Trying not to do it now is laughable.
839075594449088512 2017-03-07 11:29:45 UTC <laurashredder> I've been fighting the good fight, but this cold might win today.

838182020337520640 2017-03-04 00:19:00 UTC <laurashredder> Too sick to talk on the phone/go out/be around other people. You might as well kill me.
838180252761407488 2017-03-04 00:11:59 UTC <laurashredder> @sophillazilla  you got this

837636026743021568 2017-03-03 12:09:25 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot off the top of my head, the only one I remembered was 17.

837279380170805248 2017-03-02 12:32:14 UTC <laurashredder> Just a reminder that, while love is great, it can't fix policy. You've got to do the work to make the changes you're praying for.

836761095209627648 2017-02-28 02:12:46 UTC <laurashredder> But like, he knows he is/stands for/incites many of the ugliest forms of evil, right?  #JointSession
836760114891800578 2017-02-28 02:08:52 UTC <laurashredder> Already sighing heavily and he hasn't spoken #JointSession
836759562749423616 2017-02-28 02:06:40 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 if the one with the monocle isn't named Teddy Roosevelt, what is the point of anything?
836758163550584832 2017-02-28 02:01:07 UTC <laurashredder> Played a cooperative board game for ages 3+ this evening, and my main takeaway from it was that I still hate cooperative games.
836754928030855169 2017-02-28 01:48:15 UTC <laurashredder> Trying real hard to not do that thing where I'm in my head too much about meaningless stuff.
836747147131383808 2017-02-28 01:17:20 UTC <laurashredder> @_brianhamilton and I mean that in the most loving (but also, ack! I'm so old) kind of way.
836747011311472641 2017-02-28 01:16:48 UTC <laurashredder> @_brianhamilton by simply purchasing an American idiot shirt, you've shown the world how so un-old you are.
836746449081806848 2017-02-28 01:14:34 UTC <laurashredder> So, #adventuresinbabysitting is BY FAR my favorite hashtag on IG. So much gold.
836676147240976384 2017-02-28 20:35:12 UTC <laurashredder> Listening to a pop punk compilation from 2015/realizing I know none of these bands/wondering when I got old.
836382990745882624 2017-02-27 01:10:18 UTC <laurashredder> "You had me at brunch," and other things I say in complete sincerity

836377830086803457 2017-02-27 00:49:48 UTC <laurashredder> @mollyyanity I saw this and thought of you & Lindsay https://twitter.com/tinatbh/status/836375362867245060
835864256176324609 2017-02-26 14:49:02 UTC <laurashredder> Once I finally wake up, I have to check to see if I actually said any of things that I apparently really want to say.
835863990773366784 2017-02-26 14:47:59 UTC <laurashredder> When I'm in that liminal space between sleeping & waking, I carry on full text & twitter convos in my head.
835712192217513984 2017-02-25 04:44:48 UTC <laurashredder> Very ready to curl up on the couch in front of the fire and watch a couple episodes of Star Trek

835695780904202242 2017-02-25 03:39:35 UTC <laurashredder> What exactly is an "erotic cafe"?

834968294473904128 2017-02-23 03:28:49 UTC <laurashredder> In between two grown men trying to decide if flatware includes plates or is just silverware. WHAT IS THIS LIFE?

834787548509507584 2017-02-23 15:30:35 UTC <laurashredder> Stuck in an uber & forced to listen to some radio dude who calls himself NeanderPaul. What is this life?
834780993181491200 2017-02-23 15:04:32 UTC <laurashredder> Group texts are nice, but you're in charge of arranging this trip, and I am NOT your fucking secretary.
834780309774168066 2017-02-23 15:01:49 UTC <laurashredder> Pro Tip: if you don't want to come off as mad sexist, don't ask the youngest female faculty member on the trip to eat everyone's phone #s.
834610324187774977 2017-02-22 03:46:22 UTC <laurashredder> @ChanseScott let's find a time to enjoy a brew with @Dannysaleemyo soon, yeah?

834606904861147137 2017-02-22 03:32:47 UTC <laurashredder> @ChanseScott looks like I'm stuck with TGI Fridays with that logic
834603124698542080 2017-02-22 03:17:45 UTC <laurashredder> I've got an hour to kill in the Dallas/Fort Worth airport- what bar should I find myself at?
834372746918375424 2017-02-22 12:02:19 UTC <laurashredder> If I wish it hard enough, can coffee just appear? 
834372385872691200 2017-02-22 12:00:53 UTC <laurashredder> I've got to stop packing for trips the morning I leave on them.
834241244058570753 2017-02-21 03:19:46 UTC <laurashredder> BRB - currently perfecting my inability to determine how much I should give a shit about something & whether or not it's worth mentioning
834173512541675522 2017-02-21 22:50:38 UTC <laurashredder> Ate my weight in jelly beans today. I'll say it again: EASTER CANDY IS THE BEST CANDY.

834019770722840576 2017-02-21 12:39:43 UTC <laurashredder> @BuzzFeed Just waiting for the day when @buzzfeed says "Sike! How the F did you think we could tell that by which pic of palm trees you liked? DUMMY!"https://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/834016823913779203
834019022798778369 2017-02-21 12:36:45 UTC <laurashredder> @thebilljim that's some Texas/Italian fusion right there. 
834018589397094404 2017-02-21 12:35:01 UTC <laurashredder> Man, between that recent episode of @MomCBS & now the @GetOutMovie, my feelings about Josh Lyman have become real complicated lately.
833907305620131841 2017-02-20 05:12:49 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 here's a starter pack I'd recommend:https://www.bustle.com/articles/161254-18-body-positive-twitter-accounts-thatll-revamp-your-media-intake-change-your-life
833905578711859200 2017-02-20 05:05:57 UTC <laurashredder> When I can't sleep on public transit, it's bc I'm replaying all of that in my mind & praying for a day when women stop silencing each other
833904994097184769 2017-02-20 05:03:38 UTC <laurashredder> She said since we'd know each other since we were in 3rd grade, I had to know in my gut he was a "good boy" who "didn't mean anything by it"
833904794829987840 2017-02-20 05:02:50 UTC <laurashredder> When we got back from the trip, I remember his mom asking me to forgive him
833904444546883585 2017-02-20 05:01:27 UTC <laurashredder> I woke up to his mouth on mine & a bunch of dudes cheering him on while most of the women around me just kept looking forward
833904016698531842 2017-02-20 04:59:45 UTC <laurashredder> When I can't sleep on public transit it's bc I'm reliving that time Rob Rippstein kissed me while I was asleep on the bus to DC senior year
833903216542806016 2017-02-20 04:56:34 UTC <laurashredder> Nothing more me than getting a run in my tights the first time I wear them
833901955386843136 2017-02-20 04:51:33 UTC <laurashredder> Damnhttps://twitter.com/charlotte__ford/status/805800689058385920
833900483844640768 2017-02-20 04:45:43 UTC <laurashredder> I keep having the nightmare where all my friends are having babies / moving forward while I'd be lucky to call my current gear 'neutral'
833899564239294464 2017-02-20 04:42:03 UTC <laurashredder> @RebsTay21 have you tried Melatonin? It's natural/over the counter, and it's worked wonders for me. Also, 
833898277330378752 2017-02-20 04:36:57 UTC <laurashredder> Very disappointed this isn't 100% stuff from the @MutterMuseum TBHhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/833896027547594753
833886585783537668 2017-02-20 03:50:29 UTC <laurashredder> Just counting down the hours until the @BlkNrdProblems review of #getout
833880605192511489 2017-02-20 03:26:43 UTC <laurashredder> Doubting yourself/your strength? Take yourself out on a date- you're actually pretty amazing.
833880256033460224 2017-02-20 03:25:20 UTC <laurashredder> Made it in time to catch the express back to New Haven 
833878949549768704 2017-02-20 03:20:08 UTC <laurashredder> Probably will never stop being a big goob about this stuff.
833877735596556288 2017-02-20 03:15:19 UTC <laurashredder> Trying to stay cool, but TBH being alone on a NYC subway is how this Ohio gal knows she's an adult / will survive this next chapter.
833876236485218305 2017-02-20 03:09:22 UTC <laurashredder> Y'all: get right with your lord by going to see #GetOut when it comes out on 2/24. That shit is phenomenal.
833870862805790721 2017-02-20 02:48:00 UTC <laurashredder> @JordanPeele "Horror is my dream." -@jordanpeele
833837640470425600 2017-02-20 00:36:00 UTC <laurashredder> I am convinced it's impossible to not feel yourself if you're wearing tights
833835657344737284 2017-02-20 00:28:07 UTC <laurashredder> White privilege is seeing seats with  "reserved" signs &  faux-asking no one if "anyone" thinks the seats are reserved before sitting down.
833834380489547776 2017-02-20 00:23:02 UTC <laurashredder> Trying not to laugh every time I overhear someone discovering that Get Out isn't a comedy.
833827471736844291 2017-02-20 23:55:35 UTC <laurashredder> Childish Gambino playing and wine flowing at the screening of Get Out.
833808857629593601 2017-02-20 22:41:37 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi I held off until I was done grading one class' quizzes. Not sure what'll motivate me to finish the rest though...
833799217139372033 2017-02-20 22:03:19 UTC <laurashredder> You ever buy yourself a sandwich "just in case you get hungry," but simply knowing it's in your bag, you make yourself hungry?
833798054201479168 2017-02-20 21:58:41 UTC <laurashredder> But my initial and lingering response was/is DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME.
833797866737037312 2017-02-20 21:57:57 UTC <laurashredder> Trying hard to appreciate I have earbuds in & so the train conductor maybe felt like his only option was to touch me to get my attention.
833789481115193346 2017-02-20 21:24:38 UTC <laurashredder> Curtain dresses & train rides until I die  https://www.instagram.com/p/BQv5a6uB4d8/
833788141282684928 2017-02-20 21:19:18 UTC <laurashredder> Also, it's February and I'm in a dress & jean jacket standing in the sunshine waiting on my train. This is the life I wanted.
833787657666887680 2017-02-20 21:17:23 UTC <laurashredder> I'll stop wearing dresses that look like curtains when I stop looking so darn cute in them
833784392199892992 2017-02-20 21:04:24 UTC <laurashredder> @hfsisco https://twitter.com/playing_dad/status/833755730993958917
833766450280202240 2017-02-20 19:53:07 UTC <laurashredder> Hey NYC friends! I'm going to be in the city this evening- let me know if you'd want to grab a drink or ice cream later!
833750126317412354 2017-02-20 18:48:15 UTC <laurashredder> It matters. It might take some time, but eventually the voice saying u aren't skinny/pretty/curvy/fit/whatever enough gets quieter.
833749825690673152 2017-02-20 18:47:03 UTC <laurashredder> If u don't think the msgs u surround yourself w/impact ur relationship w/ur body, I challenge u to start following body pos accounts.

826627017919623169 2017-01-31 03:03:33 UTC <laurashredder> Anyone else feel (1) like they've got a lot of feelings & (2) unsure where to put them all?
826604912834465792 2017-01-31 01:35:43 UTC <laurashredder> Spent way too long staring at my computer today, so I'm curled up w/a book now. This feeling is exactly why ebooks will never work for me.
826581158305599488 2017-01-31 00:01:19 UTC <laurashredder> @chrystran the song Daryl sang to Paula last episode 
826580980181909505 2017-01-31 00:00:37 UTC <laurashredder> @chrystran me too! As soon as Cappie from Greek showed up, I knew we were in for so many new romantic/sexual shenanigans!
826580232870232064 2017-01-31 23:57:39 UTC <laurashredder> @chrystran I've been really happy with this half of the season.
826579757764591624 2017-01-31 23:55:46 UTC <laurashredder> Delivery guy @SethGreen on @CW_CrazyXGF and this baby kale & bean soup are perfect for this snowy evening.
826507292241707013 2017-01-31 19:07:48 UTC <laurashredder> Just realized these pants have three buttons instead of two, and I'm not sure how I got dressed this morning.pic.twitter.com/NuVTVJxtiX
826461349383372801 2017-01-31 16:05:15 UTC <laurashredder> It's snowing outside, & I've got Quangzhou Milk Oolong to keep me warm. Appreciating what I can today.   Mug courtesy of @lcopperpot!pic.twitter.com/isXdntHFYG
826234899854139397 2017-01-30 01:05:25 UTC <laurashredder> What an incredible honor to get to listen to three Freedom Riders. It's  such a blessing to hear https://www.instagram.com/p/BP6N_gpDSn2/
825809396798255110 2017-01-29 20:54:37 UTC <laurashredder> Organizing my closet, watching Buffy, and eating Chinese takeout. Perfect Sunday.
825592471040180224 2017-01-28 06:32:38 UTC <laurashredder> @izzashark v disappointing. Couldn't believe I had to sit through a preview for a movie where Alec Baldwin is a CGI baby. WTF.
825545734825074689 2017-01-28 03:26:55 UTC <laurashredder> How come all the previews for Hidden Figures are for kids movies?
825445187736502272 2017-01-28 20:47:23 UTC <laurashredder> I like this. I like this very much. https://brightside.me/article/what-you-should-think-about-before-you-judge-others-10155/

825159298703568896 2017-01-27 01:51:22 UTC <laurashredder> Few things make me happier than a 2 minute span where my team scores and The White Stripes plays in the arena/stadium.
825156699120082944 2017-01-27 01:41:02 UTC <laurashredder> Might just be the Buckeye in me, but, GD, I love a pep band.
824836192038432768 2017-01-26 04:27:27 UTC <laurashredder> Anyone else faux astral project when they are going through a really difficult time? I see my body in bed every time I close my eyes.
824804804115492866 2017-01-26 02:22:44 UTC <laurashredder> The Beast laughing at Rick & Morty during the season premiere of #TheMagicians is my whole heart tonight.
823637400832319488 2017-01-23 21:03:53 UTC <laurashredder> At least I have an emergency makeup kit in my office now!
823637294544551936 2017-01-23 21:03:28 UTC <laurashredder> Which meant I had to run to the store for new makeup & product before for classpic.twitter.com/X3zQ7yc2nT
823636923688374272 2017-01-23 21:01:59 UTC <laurashredder> I had to leave my make-up bag and blow dryer and everything else behind.
823636621077737473 2017-01-23 21:00:47 UTC <laurashredder> This morning, the bathroom door jammed & I had to shimmy out a window in a bathrobe & slippers to free myself. Happy 1st day of class to me!
822637220767158273 2017-01-20 02:49:31 UTC <laurashredder> Does anyone else ever think about how weird it is that air travel is so normal that people regularly nap in the sky?
822635844188119045 2017-01-20 02:44:03 UTC <laurashredder> Important update: somehow the air in this train car just started smelling like what I imagine the inside of a Conestoga wagon smells like.
822627179402035200 2017-01-20 02:09:37 UTC <laurashredder> @RebsTay21 
822619745006612481 2017-01-20 01:40:05 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I've literally never heard of this
822616332441186304 2017-01-20 01:26:31 UTC <laurashredder> Also. I just realized you can pretty much wear any sweater like a Snuggie, and my mind is blown once more.pic.twitter.com/jj22znCDjD
822615718365724678 2017-01-20 01:24:05 UTC <laurashredder> Too much Oregon Trail as a kid, I guess.
822615399082631168 2017-01-20 01:22:49 UTC <laurashredder> It took a car, 2 planes, & 4 trains, and, although I'm already tired, it still kinda blows my mind that I didn't need a Conestoga Wagon.
822614373113991168 2017-01-20 01:18:44 UTC <laurashredder> I left for the airport @ 930AM, & my train is scheduled to arrive in New Haven @ 10PM, which means I'll've traveled 1300 miles in < 13 hrs.
822579423614537730 2017-01-20 22:59:52 UTC <laurashredder> Just landed in NY, and it's raining/the gods are crying.

822523185715408897 2017-01-20 19:16:23 UTC <laurashredder> I was surrounded by Trump supporters at my gate, but I got to sit next to/make friends w/a woman en route to DC for the march on the plane

822479418216030209 2017-01-20 16:22:28 UTC <laurashredder> @izzashark so I was a little unclear. It's a statue. But it's still my whole heart right now.
822469955195195393 2017-01-20 15:44:52 UTC <laurashredder> There's a manatee in this airport. Missing Florida already.

821908786432606208 2017-01-18 02:34:59 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot we talked about a lot of stuff: growing up in a military family, moving around, food, what makes a home, & more. It was so fun!
821887850199261184 2017-01-18 01:11:48 UTC <laurashredder> @StoryCorps Major Mother-Daughter Day action today. We participated in a @storycorps mobile recording & then https://www.instagram.com/p/BPbVL4NjKUC/

820109766836031489 2017-01-13 03:26:19 UTC <laurashredder> One of the most unbelievable things about Buffy: a soda machine in the school caf where a can costs 60 cents.

819686095650783233 2017-01-12 23:22:48 UTC <laurashredder> Home alone, made enough escarole and bean soup for 12, and rewatching Buffy until the world makes sense.
819388906831564802 2017-01-11 03:41:53 UTC <laurashredder> Twirl my hair until I feel better.

818967045110984705 2017-01-10 23:45:33 UTC <laurashredder> Want a further kick in the gut when you're already down? Watch a network drama that aired in the months after 9/11. W in all TF.
818963174275842048 2017-01-10 23:30:11 UTC <laurashredder> And as a follow up, how much is too much wine?
818951300037705728 2017-01-10 22:42:59 UTC <laurashredder> How much is too much crying?   Asking for a friend.
818699616749240324 2017-01-09 06:02:53 UTC <laurashredder> Thus far, no amount of re-binging Rick & Morty has gotten me in a more pleasant universe.

809527280263430144 2016-12-15 22:35:18 UTC <laurashredder> Listening to a bunch of older, cis-gendered white car sales-bros talk about politics is my current hell.
809524604804988928 2016-12-15 22:24:40 UTC <laurashredder> I just can't grade one more paper tonight.
809523971259584513 2016-12-15 22:22:09 UTC <laurashredder> Going on 90 minutes at the mechanic. I may die here. If I do, someone tell Liebs I loved her but she farted too much.
807689909720989697 2016-12-10 20:54:15 UTC <laurashredder> Today is the kind of day that makes me want to curl up on my parents' couch until I'm 9 again.

796171139018059776 2016-11-08 02:02:46 UTC <laurashredder> With 33 minutes of my train ride left to go, I've given up on grading to text my friends in swing states and sob.

793802879270326272 2016-11-02 13:12:09 UTC <laurashredder> So, yeah, there are some mornings where I choose to stop crying in my car about how terrible the world is to go hug people I care about.
793565639587860480 2016-11-01 21:29:26 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi no, it's an espresso-based drink. And it's my everything.
793559625866051585 2016-11-01 21:05:33 UTC <laurashredder> .@Starbucks Your green cup is nice, but its what's in it that matters.
793559426087194625 2016-11-01 21:04:45 UTC <laurashredder> Darling @Starbucks, I'm not sure I can wait another day for the Holiday Spice Flat White. When can I can expect to see my friend again? 
793442153720602624 2016-11-01 13:18:45 UTC <laurashredder> If I am expected to get work done today, people are going to have to stop posting pics of their kids in awesome Halloween costumes.
793440404842643458 2016-11-01 13:11:48 UTC <laurashredder> I had no idea a one question Buzzfeed quiz could make me feel so good about myself. LOL. https://www.buzzfeed.com/remeepatel/what-does-your-coffee-order-say-about-you?bftw&utm_term=.doQkr42Po#.vkMrmDpLB

793438916502323200 2016-11-01 13:05:53 UTC <laurashredder> If you aren't listening to 90's classics like "There She Goes" by The La's or "What Do I Do Now" by Sleeper, my morning is winning.
792769664187265025 2016-10-30 16:46:31 UTC <laurashredder> Took this on my drive home from Boston bc I'm weird & thought it valuable to document the end of manned tollbooths on the Mass Pike.pic.twitter.com/F4VY2MXlgJ
792475197022625792 2016-10-29 21:16:25 UTC <laurashredder> Traffic is awful, but Ja Rule is on the radio, so all in all life is good rn.
792151057493262336 2016-10-28 23:48:24 UTC <laurashredder> How funny that I was excited to not go to campus today, but that translated to grading at Panera for 10 hours.
791735693076787204 2016-10-27 20:17:53 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot miss your face tooooo. FaceTime this weekend?

789223648146120704 2016-10-20 21:55:55 UTC <laurashredder> Man, these 10-12 hr days are getting old real quick.
788877223172374528 2016-10-19 22:59:21 UTC <laurashredder> Not sure I've ever been more invested in a reality show competition that I'm invested in the women's alliance on #InkMaster 
788854752318816256 2016-10-19 21:30:03 UTC <laurashredder> Maybe a little embarrassed that I don't hate this.https://www.lookhuman.com/design/330211-prose-before-bros/mug

788730475619684356 2016-10-19 13:16:13 UTC <laurashredder> (2) "I'm a dandelion; you're a four leaf clover"   They both make me feel so many feelings.
788730257775919105 2016-10-19 13:15:22 UTC <laurashredder> Trying to decide which lyric wins my emo heart... (1) "I wish I'd known that less is more, but I was passed out on the floor" OR...
788728171936026624 2016-10-19 13:07:04 UTC <laurashredder> I want so badly to not feel like its a power move, but DAMN, IT FEELS LIKE A POWER MOVE.
788722358710337536 2016-10-19 12:43:58 UTC <laurashredder> Only thing currently keeping me chill:  https://www.facebook.com/BigCatOfficial/videos/1267320709969600/
788718314264473600 2016-10-19 12:27:54 UTC <laurashredder> I mean, I know they have super busy days full of super important stuff, but like, so do I?
788718166817902592 2016-10-19 12:27:19 UTC <laurashredder> One thing that will forever irk me is that I have to show up on time for doctor appointments, but the same is not true of the doctor.
788707370302136320 2016-10-19 11:44:25 UTC <laurashredder> @Dannysaleemyo you have a doppelgnger on campus, and I keep having to do double takes.

788177162637639685 2016-10-17 00:37:33 UTC <laurashredder> Holding Ari to it, there's going to be a Taylor Swift secret drop in the next two weeks. She's his girl (in a "non-creepy way" )

788009880380698625 2016-10-17 13:32:50 UTC <laurashredder> It's 930 am, I've been up for 6ish hours, on 2 different planes, in 3 states, and I've graded 16 papers. WHAT A MONDAY.
787979110794526720 2016-10-17 11:30:34 UTC <laurashredder> Really will never understand people thinking they have the right to touch me/my stuff without my consent
787943802019409921 2016-10-17 09:10:16 UTC <laurashredder> I just got to spend a long weekend with my best friend and her baby, and I'm pretty sure that's winning.
787930700016148480 2016-10-17 08:18:12 UTC <laurashredder> There are too many awake people at the airport rn
787791294689112065 2016-10-16 23:04:15 UTC <laurashredder> you're experiencing my travel nightmare, so my heart goes out to you regardless
787769683051175937 2016-10-16 21:38:23 UTC <laurashredder> Is it possible to ever not cry when you watch/read/think about Hermoine casting the obliviate spell on her parents?
787769182670692352 2016-10-16 21:36:23 UTC <laurashredder> Sending you good luggage vibes, @JayOhEssEe  
786170521172017153 2016-10-12 11:43:53 UTC <laurashredder> I wish figuring out how to live as an adult didn't so frequently include being awake well before my alarm
786021557776842752 2016-10-11 01:51:57 UTC <laurashredder> How much pizza can one drunk woman eat in an evening?! The Laura Willis story
785110852689129472 2016-10-09 13:33:08 UTC <laurashredder> What's more embarrassing: that my mom tried to text me "true dat" in 2016 or that it autocorrected to "true date" and she didn't notice?
784821649921245184 2016-10-08 18:23:57 UTC <laurashredder> He's straight up trash (how could we believe him being a husband & father means anything about what he thinks of women?)https://twitter.com/ultraviolet/status/784816282281488384

784598788463886336 2016-10-07 03:38:22 UTC <laurashredder> Pretty sure onions are just plant trash
784594004348432384 2016-10-07 03:19:22 UTC <laurashredder> Just moshed. Not sure how old I am, but I'm not upset by that.
784590869613649920 2016-10-07 03:06:54 UTC <laurashredder> They ate playing "Mass Pike", and I'm probably 19.

784569390956249088 2016-10-07 01:41:34 UTC <laurashredder> "The crowd is as thin as Matt Pryor's hair" is the most heinous & amazing thing I've ever heard.
784565394816327681 2016-10-07 01:25:41 UTC <laurashredder> 
784565323068497921 2016-10-07 01:25:24 UTC <laurashredder> And now he is pointing at a specific person in the audience
784564575656112128 2016-10-07 01:22:25 UTC <laurashredder> So, Death is singing to us...
784559022401843201 2016-10-07 01:00:21 UTC <laurashredder> Alright y'all, I wasn't prepared for this, but @brickandmortar 's live performance of Terrible Things is fucking RIDICULOUS
784544719544184834 2016-10-07 00:03:31 UTC <laurashredder> At The Get Ups Kids show in New Haven and the lack of audience is breaking 15-year-old-Laura's heart 
784489209054760960 2016-10-07 20:22:57 UTC <laurashredder> How is it possible that those voting for Donald Trump will never be swayed by stories about all the shit he's said/keeps saying?
783856649027158020 2016-10-05 02:29:23 UTC <laurashredder> How come night clouds are so much cooler than day clouds?   (Is this some sort of emo bias of mine?)
783856357455826945 2016-10-05 02:28:13 UTC <laurashredder> Purses: a blessing or curse? I can carry way more than fits in my pockets, but it's also like "Hey! Here's all my valuables! Please steal!"

783855020630544384 2016-10-05 02:22:54 UTC <laurashredder> I kind of hate admitting this, but I actually like a few of the songs on blink's latest album.
783854595646844929 2016-10-05 02:21:13 UTC <laurashredder> Came in third at trivia tonight, but I'm calling it a win because we destroyed a tie breaker.
783853979285483521 2016-10-05 02:18:46 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot SAME
783782862722129924 2016-10-05 21:36:11 UTC <laurashredder> Which brings you more joy: farting loudly in an empty, silent hallway OR farting silently in a busy one where no one will know it was you?
783435196414693380 2016-10-04 22:34:41 UTC <laurashredder> I've been on campus/working for 10 hrs, but I get to leave my laptop here for the evening because of how much I did today. Small victories.
783428481921093632 2016-10-04 22:08:00 UTC <laurashredder> Listening to "From Here to Infirmary" and feeling oh-so-high school
783062905260535808 2016-10-03 21:55:19 UTC <laurashredder> And OMG it is so TASTY
783058631747051520 2016-10-03 21:38:20 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes you come home from work exhausted and are completely surprised that Past You made slow cooker white chicken chili... #score
782911604514054144 2016-10-03 11:54:06 UTC <laurashredder> How many days in a row do I have to eat apple sauce before I wake up a kid again?

781817080131751936 2016-09-30 11:24:52 UTC <laurashredder> @ShawnMichaelR so you're ignorant and transphobic?
781616286006665216 2016-09-29 22:06:58 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot the Internet informs me its only in its fourth season, but dear god it feels like forever
781614226909593600 2016-09-29 21:58:48 UTC <laurashredder> Not sure what I love more about the most recent episode of #SVU: Joe Biden cameo or Finn's blue suit jacket 
781612904500039680 2016-09-29 21:53:32 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I just feel like it jumped the shark SEASONS ago
781610814218403844 2016-09-29 21:45:14 UTC <laurashredder> HOW IS THE BLACKLIST STILL ON TV?!
781099285639204864 2016-09-28 11:52:36 UTC <laurashredder> But also, fried rice for lunch!!
781099155112464384 2016-09-28 11:52:05 UTC <laurashredder> Last night, I ordered fried rice, a side of dumplings & a spring roll, but wasn't hungry after I ate the sides. Who am I anymore?
781098003927007232 2016-09-28 11:47:30 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot ahhh! Google and Aunt Patty have something in common.pic.twitter.com/Hq0Licck0m

780597659551666176 2016-09-26 02:39:19 UTC <laurashredder> MAYBE I just snapped & yelled "go in Hillary" when she called out Trump's misogyny in a room full of QU students. Couldn't help myself. Oops
780595138456276992 2016-09-26 02:29:18 UTC <laurashredder> WHY DID MARCO RUBIO'S PPL JUST RT MY PROF ACCOUNT?
780590165811232768 2016-09-26 02:09:32 UTC <laurashredder> Trump has been sniffing a lot; should we be concerned he is ill?
780586189153787905 2016-09-26 01:53:44 UTC <laurashredder> What's less surprising: that Trump is advocating for Stop and Frisk or that it's been the closest thing to a policy he has suggested so far?
780578014824370176 2016-09-26 01:21:15 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly, I would be happy if Trump was good at just being "semi-exact."
780508205571072000 2016-09-26 20:43:52 UTC <laurashredder> @hazakaza love youuuu

780060831652478977 2016-09-25 15:06:09 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes my most honest aesthetic is bits of last night's lipstick on this morning's latte. 
779875331024924672 2016-09-24 02:49:02 UTC <laurashredder> Based on the # of people I saw dancing TERRIBLY/HAPPILY, I'd say there is either a new club drug or someone cast a hilarious dancing spell.
779854703538663424 2016-09-24 01:27:04 UTC <laurashredder> I'm in public & a woman near me is singing "business time" from Flight of the Conchords loudly to her date. He is way less into than she is.
779853985968783360 2016-09-24 01:24:13 UTC <laurashredder> I'm binge-watching The Mindy Project (again). I'm in season 4 (for the 1st time) & like, damn.   Didn't know I could  @mindykaling more.
779852774590808065 2016-09-24 01:19:25 UTC <laurashredder> People watching the teens & early-20-somethings at this show is making me so thankful how much less I care about looking cool now.
779828977070243840 2016-09-24 23:44:51 UTC <laurashredder> OK, I admit it, I ended up putting on real pants. But that's because I get to see Yo La Tengo in like 10 mins, so I hope you'll forgive me.
779706542136451073 2016-09-24 15:38:20 UTC <laurashredder> One of my favorite things to do is put on all my best makeup with the knowledge I'll be in a sports bra & buffet pants all day.
779703272986804224 2016-09-24 15:25:21 UTC <laurashredder> Yup. http://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978

779364268156289024 2016-09-23 16:58:16 UTC <laurashredder> When an old man's dentures clicking together reminds you of your grandpa, and that equally makes you sad & horrified.
779092836625084420 2016-09-22 22:59:41 UTC <laurashredder> Trying another New Haven pizza place for the first time tonight. This city is overflowing with pizza (no complaints)

778778995936653313 2016-09-21 02:12:36 UTC <laurashredder> When we confirmed, she exclaimed "oh my god! That emerged from a dead part of my soul!" & I've never felt sadder that she has kids.
778778643489234944 2016-09-21 02:11:12 UTC <laurashredder> At bar trivia & one of my friends just yelled out "is salton sea a part of a Tori Amos song?" like 2 rounds too late.

778033823342850052 2016-09-19 00:51:33 UTC <laurashredder> New SVU starts tomorrow; so I obviously know how I'll be spending every Tuesday evening for the foreseeable future
777935754345517057 2016-09-19 18:21:51 UTC <laurashredder> Binge-watching Rick and Morty and killing these Tzatziki potato chips. #blessed
777876733634736129 2016-09-19 14:27:20 UTC <laurashredder> I'm just in my office w/the lights off listening to Joni Mitchell, breathing, & enjoying a cup of coffee. How's your Monday going?
777731273875914752 2016-09-18 04:49:19 UTC <laurashredder> On my last flight, I had a moment where I flight like the crossword puzzle saw me.   That S is really working hard.pic.twitter.com/AjaB89UiAW
777682452252852225 2016-09-18 01:35:19 UTC <laurashredder> Crying in socially inappropriate locations: A year in the life of Laura Willis
777676057734418432 2016-09-18 01:09:55 UTC <laurashredder> I have never rage-vomitted before (although I know someone who has), but I just sorrow-vomitted, so I kind of get it now.
777670905497579521 2016-09-18 00:49:26 UTC <laurashredder> While its generally true that I'm never not crying, you should really see me once I've fallen in love w/my BFF's baby & then have to leave
777660453610786816 2016-09-18 00:07:55 UTC <laurashredder> Like, you have no idea how much I've wanted a Dr Pepper these last couple of weeks
777660349885640704 2016-09-18 00:07:30 UTC <laurashredder> This has been the most stressful month of 2016 by far, and so I'm pretty proud that I still haven't had a soda.
777659680428621824 2016-09-18 00:04:50 UTC <laurashredder> Just landed in Philadelphia. What's the likelihood that my next flight will actually be on time/get me home at all?
777632643785625600 2016-09-18 22:17:24 UTC <laurashredder> Man on plane beside me is on page 6 of a book on organizational culture & he is already asleep. We haven't even left the gate.
777632026589401088 2016-09-18 22:14:57 UTC <laurashredder> Not really ready to leave Ohio, but I'm on this plane anyway.
777605638797004801 2016-09-18 20:30:06 UTC <laurashredder> When you're a Willis, you don't fly in or out of CVG without grabbing Skyline for the road. https://www.instagram.com/p/BKgr96aDtiI/
777557358692200452 2016-09-18 17:18:15 UTC <laurashredder> Had to say "see ya later" to the new love my life today, and I'm a puddle now.pic.twitter.com/NNV11uDbdx
777139518457704448 2016-09-17 13:37:54 UTC <laurashredder> Lately I've been wondering how much time women around the world spend sobbing in their cars/pulling themselves together before getting out
777139010619731968 2016-09-17 13:35:53 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot fair point. Then I should say disinterested in MOST of my life rn. 
776983622171623424 2016-09-16 03:18:25 UTC <laurashredder> I am very disinterested in my own life right now, so I've been really throwing myself into this whole celebrating a new baby thing.
776981779819401216 2016-09-16 03:11:06 UTC <laurashredder> Drove toward the harvest moon earlier tonight, thought about The Hard Lessons, and tried to wish myself 23 again.
776980667297099780 2016-09-16 03:06:41 UTC <laurashredder> I can't describe how much I love this new little bean or how endlessly proud I am of @lcopperpot.
776980465274253312 2016-09-16 03:05:53 UTC <laurashredder> I can't stop looking at pics of Everett whenever we're not in the same room. I'm maybe a little obsessed.
776904648133382145 2016-09-16 22:04:36 UTC <laurashredder> Very, very far away from a little bean of my own, but rocking & singing Everett to sleep has seriously stirred some real feelings in me.
776786952540524544 2016-09-16 14:16:56 UTC <laurashredder> I've been in a baby bubble since late Tuesday, and I'm just now learning about Tyre King. I'm heartbroken for his family, for Columbus.  at Maternity Pavilion @ Mt. Carmel St. Ann's
776241291088846848 2016-09-14 02:08:40 UTC <laurashredder> I've been up for 41+ hours, only had lunch/snacks today, and will be waking up to a 430 alarm. MY BFF HAD A BABY & THE WORLD IS GRAND.
776168775343304705 2016-09-14 21:20:31 UTC <laurashredder> I agree with so much of what Roxane Gay says, and I often agree with her sentiment that https://www.instagram.com/p/BKWejqBjrb6/
775968737799376896 2016-09-14 08:05:38 UTC <laurashredder> I've been up for 23 hrs straight w no end in sight, but idc. I get to meet my brand new grandson/nephew/best friend later today. 
775847759375134721 2016-09-13 00:04:55 UTC <laurashredder> Finally on a plane and en route to OHIO.pic.twitter.com/KgCV5HRoRb
775813479886360577 2016-09-13 21:48:42 UTC <laurashredder> First time taking a car service to an airport, & assuming I make my LGA to CVG flight, this is the nicest thing @AmericanAir has ever done.
775643474167291904 2016-09-13 10:33:09 UTC <laurashredder> But, like, I had no idea how much this week would test the bounds of this seemingly endless joy and sorrow.
775643063628795904 2016-09-13 10:31:31 UTC <laurashredder> last week, I told a friend that I'm equally thrilled & miserable to be alive most days because the world is somehow both awful & incredible
775642679854137344 2016-09-13 10:30:00 UTC <laurashredder> Been up for an hour, and so I laughed and rolled my eyes at my alarm when it went off just now.
775514123824013312 2016-09-12 01:59:10 UTC <laurashredder> How long can you leave a text unanswered before your text back is no longer considered a response?
775513481323872256 2016-09-12 01:56:36 UTC <laurashredder> Really so ill prepared and hopelessly excited to be a grandma.
775505077817774081 2016-09-12 01:23:13 UTC <laurashredder> Y'all! Hanif bought a slice of Orange Almond Tart and left it in the fridge. He's now in Ohio, so that cake is now in my belly. 
775497757259948032 2016-09-12 00:54:08 UTC <laurashredder> Listened to Won't Be Pathetic Forever on my drive home & I'm watching L&O SVU now. So, yeah, that.
775495967600680960 2016-09-12 00:47:01 UTC <laurashredder> First evening I've had an appetite in a week, and now I want a burrito even though I just ate pasta.
775309917104250880 2016-09-12 12:27:43 UTC <laurashredder> my main piece of advice is deep breaths. Now and in the appointment! 
775309436680335360 2016-09-12 12:25:48 UTC <laurashredder> you got this! It is not a fun appointment, but it has been totally worth the up-front discomfort!
775161946408640512 2016-09-11 02:39:44 UTC <laurashredder> Not that today wasn't its own kind of good, but I'm looking forward to future days where getting off the couch sounds reasonable
775070838898974720 2016-09-11 20:37:42 UTC <laurashredder> Binge watching Orphan Black and cooking cabbage. What. A. Day.
774350365500248064 2016-09-09 20:54:48 UTC <laurashredder> So many people tweeting about their cuddly pets, and Liebs is over here wanting nothing to do with me.pic.twitter.com/bVy4glp08I
774052452890910721 2016-09-08 01:11:00 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot to be fair, he did smile for like half a sec in the hammock
774018046763544576 2016-09-08 22:54:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot OH WAIT. NEVERMIND.
774017937019703296 2016-09-08 22:53:51 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot WTF is a naked cake
774017730576080896 2016-09-08 22:53:02 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I honestly can't wait for Starbucks' holiday flat white.
773496912339202048 2016-09-07 12:23:29 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey it's good info, but from what I've read before, it's nothing groundbreaking
773489083872075777 2016-09-07 11:52:22 UTC <laurashredder> Like, have you see me? I'm a mess of scars and tattoos. I understand the concept of soapy water and aquaphor.
773488862630912000 2016-09-07 11:51:30 UTC <laurashredder> Was handed a packet on wound care when leaving the derma's office yesterday. I straight up laughed and said "I got this."

773367357112745984 2016-09-06 03:48:41 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi that's awful. Do you have PCOS? I've had two separate instances of cysts bursting and ending up in the hospital.
773354703623159808 2016-09-06 02:58:24 UTC <laurashredder> Also, I had a milkshake tonight and now feel more compelled to have an early morning gym session. I DON'T RECOGNIZE MYSELF.

773353717101887488 2016-09-06 02:54:29 UTC <laurashredder> The other day, I was in line to pay at the grocery, and impulse purchased the $13 Time Special Edition on mindfulness. WHO AM I ANYMORE?!
773353399597297664 2016-09-06 02:53:13 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi that's what I too. I'm so sorry it isn't working for you; what a pain in the uterus.
773352411142520832 2016-09-06 02:49:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot they really weren't holding back; some of this shit is AWFUL. But I loved what Jewel said.
773351951698423809 2016-09-06 02:47:28 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi what IUD do you have? I haven't had a period in over a year.
773329057404551172 2016-09-06 01:16:29 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I have the full track list saved on my home computer. I'll send you the doc later.
773288057013403648 2016-09-06 22:33:34 UTC <laurashredder>  when you're BFF offers to walk aimlessly around a grocery store to be on the phone with you.
773285927716286464 2016-09-06 22:25:06 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 @lcopperpot if you can't call out to BS, who can?
773285823395532800 2016-09-06 22:24:41 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 @lcopperpot but like, also doing them a favor in the long run, no?
773284274049089536 2016-09-06 22:18:32 UTC <laurashredder> My mom is not afraid to be hella honest with me when I need it.
773283492562104320 2016-09-06 22:15:26 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 @lcopperpot just like "do you have any idea how much of this conversation has been about you?" at the end of the next time you talk
773283186889658372 2016-09-06 22:14:13 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 @lcopperpot I mean, if it's who I think it is, I think you kinda gotta call him on his BS
773282423861837824 2016-09-06 22:11:11 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 @lcopperpot ugh. That's tough.
773281904665780234 2016-09-06 22:09:07 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot @zona325 OMG. This is about me. I even make your tweets about me. I'm a mess.

773229001187987460 2016-09-06 18:38:54 UTC <laurashredder> I don't really like the band The Summer Set, but I totally feel the concept of "I think it's time for me to figure me out."

771698813849526276 2016-09-02 13:18:29 UTC <laurashredder> My dad still calls me "little sissy" sometimes (I'm the youngest of his daughters), and it's equal parts heartwarming and horrifying.
771520499075674112 2016-09-01 01:29:55 UTC <laurashredder> I think I love @_sam_rush more now than ever before.   "Once upon a time you could've been a tooth as much as anything..."

771514079911567364 2016-09-01 01:04:25 UTC <laurashredder> @tabernacleteeth I must find this over the weekend. It is my new number one priority.
771512326298238976 2016-09-01 00:57:27 UTC <laurashredder> I just ate at least 12 too many jalapeo slices
771504154279866368 2016-09-01 00:24:58 UTC <laurashredder> So long I nearly lost my hands to the hot water in the bathroom before remembering how unimportant cleanliness can be sometimes.

771212055894302720 2016-08-31 05:04:17 UTC <laurashredder> My alarm is going off in 5 1/3 hrs and I'm expecting myself to function tomorrow. KMN
771102979185184768 2016-08-31 21:50:51 UTC <laurashredder> I'm currently aimlessly walking around target because I'm brain dead
771099529219346434 2016-08-31 21:37:08 UTC <laurashredder> So @potockbr preached the good gospel of airplane mode to me this june. It took a couple of months, but it's my new religion.
770830561023758336 2016-08-30 03:48:21 UTC <laurashredder> And as I believe the universe is always seeking balance, tomorrow I'm due for some nonsense.
770830358833164288 2016-08-30 03:47:33 UTC <laurashredder> Y'all. Today I had a very my-shit-is-put-all-the-way-together day that culminated in a sour ale and grilled peach salad.

770735940646174720 2016-08-30 21:32:22 UTC <laurashredder> Few things please me as much as watching grown men in jean shorts on ellipticals.   Like, what got you to this point, my dude?
770731473305567232 2016-08-30 21:14:37 UTC <laurashredder> New admin assistant recommended I try Hot Yoga. Not sure if she's already noticed I'm the sweatiest woman on earth/that's why she said it.
770729470424735744 2016-08-30 21:06:39 UTC <laurashredder> I can't be expected to listen to my own music without singing when the XM station at the gym is playing Destiny's Child
770724240563793921 2016-08-30 20:45:52 UTC <laurashredder> @JessiBehrendsen  as are you, my love
770712993155911680 2016-08-30 20:01:11 UTC <laurashredder> 3/3 of classes done for the day. Syllabus day has come and gone yet again, and with it, the easiest day of the semester... Where's the wine?
770589264379781120 2016-08-30 11:49:32 UTC <laurashredder> Just vomited a little direct after brushing my teeth (like toothbrush in hand). Good sign for first day of classes, or no?
770399060641669120 2016-08-29 23:13:44 UTC <laurashredder> Few things make me miss Japan more than the New York City Subway.
770380944331173892 2016-08-29 22:01:44 UTC <laurashredder> Quick: how does one cry while reading on a train without disturbing their bench mate?

770362671698964480 2016-08-29 20:49:08 UTC <laurashredder> I'm reading @rgay on a train on the way into the city to grab dinner with friends. In moments like these, CT feels a little more like home.
770286792704688128 2016-08-29 15:47:37 UTC <laurashredder> I think I may have been cursed at some point. Any time Jenny From The Block comes on, it seems I must sing along.
770280859521941504 2016-08-29 15:24:02 UTC <laurashredder> This is the third time I've worn these pants to the gym & the third time I've reminded myself to cut the tag out of the back of them. SMH.
770267103224012801 2016-08-29 14:29:22 UTC <laurashredder> Liebs & I have been together for a decade. She's seen me through some things, like all this eye makeup. pic.twitter.com/R0Pb4SnLVJ

769886161456201728 2016-08-28 13:15:39 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes I eat a couple handfuls of trail mix as breakfast and try to convince myself that this busy of a life is what I want.
769729440226091008 2016-08-27 02:52:54 UTC <laurashredder> I just saw Nick Offerman & Megan Mullaly and now Hang On Sloopy is playing in this here Fuddruckers, so I'm in love with tonight.
769658168033042433 2016-08-27 22:09:41 UTC <laurashredder> Okay. So, Step Brothers is on Comedy Central, and now I'm unsure how I'll ever get motivated to get off my couch.
769654249785556994 2016-08-27 21:54:07 UTC <laurashredder> It's amazing what a well-fitting pair of short shorts can do for my confidence

769605256703537152 2016-08-27 18:39:26 UTC <laurashredder> I haven't paid any bills today, but I have added due dates to my calendar. I'm done adult-ing for a little bit.
769575648478240772 2016-08-27 16:41:47 UTC <laurashredder> Can now be updated to: I'm eating cold pizza in a sports bra because I'm a grown up.

769563419137699841 2016-08-27 15:53:11 UTC <laurashredder> Which is why I've started putting my phone on airplane mode whenever I can when I am w the people I care about
769563131391737856 2016-08-27 15:52:02 UTC <laurashredder> Just left a talk where one of the main points was that attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity, & I felt that in a v real way
769388595522203648 2016-08-26 04:18:30 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I know. I'm actually kind of heartbroken over it.
769387821777969152 2016-08-26 04:15:25 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot TBH I don't think I like any of the couples

769193596796960768 2016-08-26 15:23:39 UTC <laurashredder> I asked him "you don't think this is pretty?" and he laughed and said "I love my daughter"
769193251555409920 2016-08-26 15:22:16 UTC <laurashredder> also, his response to this pic was "you're such a pretty girl. why do you always make such dumb faces?"

769180532693499905 2016-08-26 14:31:44 UTC <laurashredder> Talking Lewis' The Jungle & meatpacking in general with the Colonel, and he just said "pack it up, baby," like that made any sense.
769179355599765505 2016-08-26 14:27:03 UTC <laurashredder> My mom just sent a pic of her pancake to her best friend, and I could help but think of you @kaysarahsera @phil_kaye  at The Pantry
769177048237629440 2016-08-26 14:17:53 UTC <laurashredder> My dad was on the phone w/his brother earlier & I heard him say "I mean, we're not young anymore, but we're still pretty dumb."
769175701694124033 2016-08-26 14:12:32 UTC <laurashredder> If I were an inanimate object, I'd be a lipstick stain on a coffee mug.

768831375852068864 2016-08-25 15:24:18 UTC <laurashredder> Today has quickly become a Sudden Suspension kind of day.
768779765222350848 2016-08-25 11:59:13 UTC <laurashredder> It apparently only takes five minutes for me to make coffee and accept this is what I look like for the day.
768777376197206016 2016-08-25 11:49:44 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot ten minutes?

767723466862780416 2016-08-22 14:01:52 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo like it feels 100% aggressive but also 95% sad
767723183944400896 2016-08-22 14:00:45 UTC <laurashredder> Feel like I've achieved the ultimate evolution of my aesthetic today: maybe she just rolled out of bed professional slob/chic
767720952385929216 2016-08-22 13:51:53 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo but also yeah. I totally feel you.
767720862518763522 2016-08-22 13:51:31 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo maybe it's their first opportunity to be close to someone in a while?
767720706348122112 2016-08-22 13:50:54 UTC <laurashredder> Last day of my 28th year; headed to a faculty meeting. Please send cake

767630702166810624 2016-08-22 07:53:15 UTC <laurashredder> Buzzfeed just told me I'm an "Eastcoaster through and through."   The fuck I am, Buzzfeed.

767346827796574209 2016-08-21 13:05:15 UTC <laurashredder> Not sure I'm prepared for Rizzoli & Isles to be over forever.
767342496749944832 2016-08-21 12:48:02 UTC <laurashredder> So #OddMomOut just made a Mohegan Sun joke, and I love it even more now.
767340307172192256 2016-08-21 12:39:20 UTC <laurashredder> How did people function before coffee?
767337688869527553 2016-08-21 12:28:56 UTC <laurashredder> First morning all week that I didn't wake up before my alarm, and that jerk just scared the shit out of me.
767219971307044865 2016-08-20 04:41:10 UTC <laurashredder> Yes.    http://feministing.com/2016/01/19/what-i-would-have-said-to-you-last-night-had-you-not-cum-and-then-fallen-asleep/
767216994513018880 2016-08-20 04:29:20 UTC <laurashredder> Today, this incredible group of people took me to the beach and breathed life back into me. From https://www.instagram.com/p/BJW3wdxji7v/
767212987266531328 2016-08-20 04:13:24 UTC <laurashredder> @_brianhamilton haven't watched that yet. But it's on a long list of tv to watch before I die.
767211226292162560 2016-08-20 04:06:25 UTC <laurashredder> Just realized my ideal Saturday night includes a SVU marathon & beer. How time has changed me.

767023079851757568 2016-08-20 15:38:47 UTC <laurashredder> Finally got to meet @kieranwcollier & he bought me a ginger lemonade & talked TV with me for 30 mins, he's p much family now.
766981227433824260 2016-08-20 12:52:29 UTC <laurashredder> BEACH DAY 
766979732462329856 2016-08-20 12:46:32 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz you're smart and strong. you've got this. 
766978029306384384 2016-08-20 12:39:46 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I'm am very committed to this idea
766968363843194881 2016-08-20 12:01:22 UTC <laurashredder> Just made myself a mug of @onelinecoffee for my FaceTime date with @lcopperpot. It's a "few of my Columbus favorites" kind of morning.
766958620848324608 2016-08-20 11:22:39 UTC <laurashredder> @oliviagatwood and you're so very good at it, my dear.
766807378171990016 2016-08-19 01:21:40 UTC <laurashredder> I got Ariel. And I mean, I've p much be saying that since I could talk, so thanks for the validation, @BuzzFeedhttps://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/766806036942508032
766794769276231680 2016-08-19 00:31:34 UTC <laurashredder> TV won't switch channels, so here I am watching Guy Fieri dominate some waffles
766794065480413184 2016-08-19 00:28:46 UTC <laurashredder> Dude beside me going harder on the stair climber than I've ever seen anyone go. We're all fighting our own battles tonight, it seems.

766766574183256064 2016-08-19 22:39:31 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot here's a friendly reminder that we'll grow old (are growing old?!) together. https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr05/2013/7/14/19/anigif_enhanced-buzz-3657-1373845601-16.gif?no-auto

766756180005879808 2016-08-19 21:58:13 UTC <laurashredder> I want beautiful, shaped brows, but still feel compelled to mourn the loss of each hair bc it was as much me as any other part.
766755925210308608 2016-08-19 21:57:12 UTC <laurashredder> I feel both empowered & terrified by all the tools/procedures we've developed so that we can make our bodies look differently.
766748223855857664 2016-08-19 21:26:36 UTC <laurashredder> What a sad and powerful moment when you decide to pluck all the hairs you hate
766746628493602816 2016-08-19 21:20:16 UTC <laurashredder> @laurashredder that was glorious
766741543269072896 2016-08-19 21:00:03 UTC <laurashredder> Alright. It's mask/nap time. See y'all in 20.
766735538455977984 2016-08-19 20:36:12 UTC <laurashredder> Okay. The house is as clean as its getting today. Should I now head to the gym or just apply this mask & nap?pic.twitter.com/GjlvPV8enR
766722109682909184 2016-08-19 19:42:50 UTC <laurashredder> The worst bit re: the Trump statues for me is that the artist has monster design on his CV. So, like, do that.
766720390286696449 2016-08-19 19:36:00 UTC <laurashredder> The article says "will usher in," but it's already here. All she had to do was get the nom/campaign/consider/existhttps://twitter.com/feministapparel/status/766718921596604416
766705479628324864 2016-08-19 18:36:45 UTC <laurashredder> Or do you just have some insecure dudes writing content for you?
766705353304211456 2016-08-19 18:36:15 UTC <laurashredder> Also curious if you focus grouped that point of the manual w/some of your actual customers?
766703215014543360 2016-08-19 18:27:45 UTC <laurashredder> Or just those generally targeted to women?
766703094122024960 2016-08-19 18:27:16 UTC <laurashredder> Do statements "comforting" customers that they won't become dependent on your toys make their way into the manuals for all your products?
766702694505611264 2016-08-19 18:25:41 UTC <laurashredder> Dear sex toy industry: it's some BS when you delegitimize women's solo time w/statements like "no vibrator can replace a terrific kiss..."
766698042259083265 2016-08-19 18:07:12 UTC <laurashredder> @HolaKyle fingers crossed!
766694662996393984 2016-08-19 17:53:46 UTC <laurashredder> @HolaKyle I know there's data that suggests ppl who consistently get less than 7hrs are less healthy, but who needs a functioning body?
766672848610070528 2016-08-19 16:27:05 UTC <laurashredder> @sophillazilla what magic. 
766671322458062848 2016-08-19 16:21:01 UTC <laurashredder> If I could gift myself anything it'd be an endless playlist featuring punk covers of pop songs & acoustic covers of punk songs. I'm a mess.
766670937450221569 2016-08-19 16:19:30 UTC <laurashredder> it's okay to rage though
766670645245739010 2016-08-19 16:18:20 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz 
766669318746677248 2016-08-19 16:13:04 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz ditto. I very much enjoy / benefit from sharing spaces w you, both physical and virtual.
766657847887269888 2016-08-19 15:27:29 UTC <laurashredder> Watch out house, I'm on the "my mom's going to be here soon" level.
766657538985189376 2016-08-19 15:26:15 UTC <laurashredder> This weekend is chock full of out-of-town plans, & then my parents will be here when I get off work on Monday, so today is a cleaning day.

766653087909974016 2016-08-19 15:08:34 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 I read this as "historic house fire" and was v confused
766628030085210112 2016-08-19 13:29:00 UTC <laurashredder> Which is why I call my make-up bag my arsenal.
766627907871662080 2016-08-19 13:28:31 UTC <laurashredder> One way I know women are magic is our ability to use the same make-up for both celebration and protection.
766623318195707904 2016-08-19 13:10:16 UTC <laurashredder> Just laughed at myself for trying to decide how much i want to feel today, as if i could ever be anything other than an open heart
766619536615415808 2016-08-19 12:55:15 UTC <laurashredder> Randomly feeling sad about Alan Rickman this morning.
766618995118178304 2016-08-19 12:53:06 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot one of Hanif's friends advocates that only white trash ppl like Mt Dew, but it was my lifeblood in high school
766618678163046400 2016-08-19 12:51:50 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I was mostly glad I got to say I don't ever drink soda and didn't know why I was there
766618073558290432 2016-08-19 12:49:26 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot based on the soda quiz, I'm 22. Average those together, and we're getting closer...
766617740048228352 2016-08-19 12:48:06 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot buzzfeed told me I was 40 based on my Taco Bell order. I'm mostly praying I don't eat at Taco Bell at 40.
766614864387272704 2016-08-19 12:36:41 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey yeah, @manwhohasitall is my new fav account
766602410508910592 2016-08-19 11:47:12 UTC <laurashredder> @zona325 I hope you like it all! I'd love to have more people to talk about it with (instead of to) (bc I haven't stopped talking about it)
766600233820295168 2016-08-19 11:38:33 UTC <laurashredder> "Humor that is predicated on shame is violence" should be posted in every writers' room TBHhttps://twitter.com/pwrbttmband/status/766442650169991168

766598892741881856 2016-08-19 11:33:13 UTC <laurashredder> YES, YES, YES https://medium.com/@SaraJBenincasa/why-am-i-so-fat-91564fc3a0c7#.lkigc1h3s
766589283427770368 2016-08-19 10:55:02 UTC <laurashredder> Kinda worried my "I'll sleep when I'm dead" motto might actually kill me.   But that would mean more sleep, so maybe not all that worried.
766481287272140801 2016-08-18 03:45:54 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi this truly breaks my heart
766458855710679040 2016-08-18 02:16:45 UTC <laurashredder> 1 of my older brothers (aka the only 1 I talk to) just texted me an earlier birthday wish bc he "gets busy & forgets things."  Me too, bro.
766457329328021504 2016-08-18 02:10:42 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot mess in the best way possible.

766448847031705600 2016-08-18 01:36:59 UTC <laurashredder> When your best friend ever sends you most amazing bday package and so you sob and sob and sob....
766446372967112704 2016-08-18 01:27:09 UTC <laurashredder> Why can't women walk our dogs in peace?
766445992359108608 2016-08-18 01:25:39 UTC <laurashredder> A dude (easily 6ft tall) just came up behind me and told me I'm tall. WHY?
766441690299236352 2016-08-18 01:08:33 UTC <laurashredder> Omg. @TalentiGelato's Key Lime Pie is sooooo good
766403725028122629 2016-08-18 22:37:41 UTC <laurashredder> Why is pasta the absolute best?
766386089544286208 2016-08-18 21:27:37 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj lets throw each other in, okay?
766382101780463617 2016-08-18 21:11:46 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj this needs delayed until after beach day please
766375051222540289 2016-08-18 20:43:45 UTC <laurashredder> Some days it takes more work than others to look in the mirror and convince myself this chipped tooth // these scars are proof of survival.
766372833979162625 2016-08-18 20:34:56 UTC <laurashredder> @JessiBehrendsen especially since I apparently only have "lip stain" in this purse 
766371165476646912 2016-08-18 20:28:18 UTC <laurashredder> Thought I grabbed my lipstick; nearly Tide To-Go'ed my lips.
766350319093678084 2016-08-18 19:05:28 UTC <laurashredder> Lol to when one of ur BFFs is in PR for a week & u wanna text him every 90 mins about sunscreen bc love but u only text once bc love.

766332997977141248 2016-08-18 17:56:39 UTC <laurashredder> The Winter Olympian commercial by @ReesesPBCups is my favorite thing on TV rn

766329916971421696 2016-08-18 17:44:24 UTC <laurashredder> Alright, but the Pioneer Woman is making mushroom pizza pockets, so I'm back.https://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/766328397719035904
766329263423365120 2016-08-18 17:41:48 UTC <laurashredder> The person on the machine beside me is watching Rizolli & Isles, and I briefly thought Jane was Lorelei from GG/was super confused.
766328865992081409 2016-08-18 17:40:14 UTC <laurashredder> Which NYC date are we going to, @NifMuhammad ?https://twitter.com/thewonderyears/status/766327320684687361
766328397719035904 2016-08-18 17:38:22 UTC <laurashredder> When @FifthHarmony comes on at the gym, you know I'm taking out my headphones. Food Network be damned!
766301897259188224 2016-08-18 15:53:04 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot OMG
766301487358177280 2016-08-18 15:51:26 UTC <laurashredder> How do we encourage higher ed educators to consider our profession as a moral relationship, not a money-for-service transaction?
766300253138087936 2016-08-18 15:46:32 UTC <laurashredder> I want these conversations to happen, yes, duh. But the incongruence of today's presentations is not lost on me. pic.twitter.com/CbGZPLOdSb
766296506123051008 2016-08-18 15:31:38 UTC <laurashredder> This retreat is hella long, but v happy we're giving space to speak about Tyler Clementi, bullying, as well as issues re: racism on campus
766291062596001793 2016-08-18 15:10:00 UTC <laurashredder> Some new admin hire talking and now 80% of faculty are on their laptops/phones
766288224696270848 2016-08-18 14:58:44 UTC <laurashredder> But I say that muffin did NOT give consent. Gotta call out bullshit where I see it.
766287962380328960 2016-08-18 14:57:41 UTC <laurashredder> He's unhappy I shared that with y'all, claiming what he does with his muffin is his business
766287707291222016 2016-08-18 14:56:41 UTC <laurashredder> Just watched a colleague tap his muffin with his pointer finger to "test if it's hard or not"
766284620941983748 2016-08-18 14:44:25 UTC <laurashredder> If it was my mom, I wouldn't trust her.  https://twitter.com/nicole_cliffe/status/766279609532948481
766283624673075201 2016-08-18 14:40:27 UTC <laurashredder> I'll stay snapping when faculty presenters call for faculty support and more tenure track lines, even if I'm the only one.
766273362108743680 2016-08-18 13:59:40 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I know, and it reminded me to chill about my expectations for how to pronounce stuff.
766269177388761089 2016-08-18 13:43:03 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot we compliment each other well.
766269058975236096 2016-08-18 13:42:34 UTC <laurashredder> Been here since 2014/attended games/taught a player. How come their undefeated season wasn't talked about? Crappy.pic.twitter.com/r0wsxWJ7gH
766261823083573248 2016-08-18 13:13:49 UTC <laurashredder> Been at an all faculty "retreat" since 730, and the coffee sucks. Clearly they aren't interested in faculty retention.
766260930367881216 2016-08-18 13:10:16 UTC <laurashredder> Ummm...https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/766246213079498752
766224751517917184 2016-08-18 10:46:31 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi  I'm having the same struggle with Stranger Things
766098214139330560 2016-08-17 02:23:42 UTC <laurashredder> Just won bar trivia and had a strange man proclaim his love for me at a crosswalk. So, tonight's been a night.
766053253733842945 2016-08-17 23:25:02 UTC <laurashredder> If you're curious what it feels like to be hunted, start listening to any woman in your life that's ever been outside.
766049358664130562 2016-08-17 23:09:34 UTC <laurashredder> perfection.
766049178300641280 2016-08-17 23:08:51 UTC <laurashredder> To say I feel men's eyes on my body nearly every time I'm outside does not come from a place of vanity, but a place of fear.
766048494985572352 2016-08-17 23:06:08 UTC <laurashredder> It's in the 70s, y'all. It's a freaking miracle.
766046826088828928 2016-08-17 22:59:30 UTC <laurashredder> @eemilyeastman my mother always told me to keep them wanting more

766043966936604672 2016-08-17 22:48:08 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo everything we've ever experienced was simply hurtling us to this moment.
766043570864283648 2016-08-17 22:46:34 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo Ths shit sounds complicated. I totally understand why the Internet was invented now.
766043066650230784 2016-08-17 22:44:34 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo I would be completely honored if you figured out how to get a pigeon to my home.
766042531394191360 2016-08-17 22:42:26 UTC <laurashredder> Would also be very happy with any and all flair from @shopstrangeways tbh https://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/765771962853519360
766006371468865536 2016-08-17 20:18:45 UTC <laurashredder> British chef just pronounced "pho" as "fo" & it super irked me. Then he pronounced herbs with a hard H, so I guess I have to get over it.
766004273700298752 2016-08-17 20:10:25 UTC <laurashredder> New gym has tvs on all their cardio machines; can't decide between Olympics & Food Network.pic.twitter.com/em6J9HzUp9
765895328138661888 2016-08-17 12:57:30 UTC <laurashredder> A woman just drove by me reading a magazine. Ummm.
765771962853519360 2016-08-16 04:47:17 UTC <laurashredder> Six days til my birthday. I've got my fingers crossed for mixed CDs and ice cream cake.
765768218560630785 2016-08-16 04:32:25 UTC <laurashredder> One of the hardest conversations I've ever had. The worst part: I have no idea if it changed anything for him, if he believed me.
765767788497600512 2016-08-16 04:30:42 UTC <laurashredder> Had to get super real w my younger bro earlier this year when he told me he believes women cry rape when they get their feelings hurt.
765753635859001344 2016-08-16 03:34:28 UTC <laurashredder> Sometimes I surprise myself by remembering to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer in a timely fashion
765750985524387841 2016-08-16 03:23:56 UTC <laurashredder> I've cooked dinner three nights in a row; feeling way more domestic than I ever thought possible.
765747286299279361 2016-08-16 03:09:14 UTC <laurashredder> But, like,  seriously wtf are all these 
765746837970120704 2016-08-16 03:07:27 UTC <laurashredder> Y'all ever go to send a heart emoji, but then get overwhelmed bc there are so many options & you get too in your head about it?
765746012442988544 2016-08-16 03:04:10 UTC <laurashredder> Just finished the first episode of Stranger Things. Trusting it picks up bc so many of y'all were stoked on it last week.
765727571292094465 2016-08-16 01:50:54 UTC <laurashredder> Devin Allen looks a little like @TylerBaltierra from Teen Mom TBH

765725653098459136 2016-08-16 01:43:16 UTC <laurashredder> I seriously LOVE time travel, but Timeless looks like a dumpster fire
765724660524838913 2016-08-16 01:39:20 UTC <laurashredder> @poemsabouttoast I seriously worry that I'm dead and don't know it at least once a day
765706302546931712 2016-08-16 00:26:23 UTC <laurashredder> When you talk to your dog and they take it as an invitation to put their tongue on your mouth
765705707111014400 2016-08-16 00:24:01 UTC <laurashredder> Finished The Get Down, and feeling a little like a teen whose glorious summer love affair just ended
765705328562413568 2016-08-16 00:22:31 UTC <laurashredder> @kckearns of course grrrrrl
765671104748937216 2016-08-16 22:06:31 UTC <laurashredder> You ever have a couple beers, catch a glimpse of your cleavage, and think "hot damn"?
765660569022132224 2016-08-16 21:24:39 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly not emotionally prepared for pumpkin beers.
765651982459756544 2016-08-16 20:50:32 UTC <laurashredder> @angelamcmarie @CharlotteAbotsi @DesDallagiacomo we got you, boo bear. we will hold you up whenever you need.
765625457098256384 2016-08-16 19:05:08 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot what an asshat
765624106771484672 2016-08-16 18:59:46 UTC <laurashredder> "Its okay to acknowledge the triumphs while still naming the pain."  YES to this & all my <3 to @IzettaNicole.http://bit.ly/2bl4Y8n
765621900785647616 2016-08-16 18:51:00 UTC <laurashredder> She was relentless that I would learn to look okay while I oscillated b/w "make up is the patriarchy at work" & "all black everything"
765621426317647872 2016-08-16 18:49:07 UTC <laurashredder> Today's eye make-up is brought to you by my mother, buying me a Bobbi Brown book during my formative teen years.pic.twitter.com/SaK0zlsfzm
765617173368823808 2016-08-16 18:32:13 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 seriously, handing her my business card with my cell number on the back is the most nervous I've been since I was single.
765616901812785152 2016-08-16 18:31:08 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot WHAT IN ALL THE EFF.
765616821127053312 2016-08-16 18:30:49 UTC <laurashredder> I don't know how it happened, but I think the woman I met at the DMV last week might actually turn out to be a real friend. This is wild.
765538012331671552 2016-08-16 13:17:39 UTC <laurashredder> I walked outside and did not immediately become a puddle.
765451772290801664 2016-08-16 07:34:58 UTC <laurashredder> up for the timeline you're actually living. Major S/O to Mary for dropping the knowledge I really needed to hear IRL via my dream. (3/3)
765451140624486400 2016-08-16 07:32:27 UTC <laurashredder> thinking about what could or might be happening in alternative timelines because it's messy & confusing & just basically fucks things (2/3)
765450790311952384 2016-08-16 07:31:04 UTC <laurashredder> I just awoke from a sweet little dream when my BFF from elementary school came in as the voice of my subconscious & told me to stop (1/3)
765395890475499521 2016-08-15 03:52:55 UTC <laurashredder> "Every time I touch myself, I think of u" is more believable (sorta), but less catchy I guess.
765395676398256128 2016-08-15 03:52:04 UTC <laurashredder> I feel like the thesis of the Divinyls song is backwards. Like, u'd be masturbating a LOT if u touch urself every time u think of them.
765393010636926976 2016-08-15 03:41:28 UTC <laurashredder> @izzashark I got u. Any time.
765392741186560001 2016-08-15 03:40:24 UTC <laurashredder> @izzashark was that too harsh?
765392704813555712 2016-08-15 03:40:15 UTC <laurashredder> @izzashark fuck everyone else.
765392516107632640 2016-08-15 03:39:30 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I was going to watch regardless, but now I'm excited about it. Nothing but love for Mr Rudd 
765390673289809920 2016-08-15 03:32:11 UTC <laurashredder> Which is to say, all of my tweets are basically meant to be read as directly to you anyway. So....https://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/765390488954339328

765389463593816064 2016-08-15 03:27:23 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot is this a parenting thing? Do i need to watch it to be an effective gma?
765388938236264448 2016-08-15 03:25:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot rolling my eyes until they fall out of my head
765388028680531968 2016-08-15 03:21:40 UTC <laurashredder> Started following more local tattooers on IG & it's only reinforced my decision to only be tattooed by women. So much misogynistic flash.

765343963658260480 2016-08-15 00:26:34 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot my god yes. But carve out a god chunk of time. First episode is 90 mins

765328309303508993 2016-08-15 23:24:22 UTC <laurashredder> And to Hanif liking the paprika salmon, Parmesan couscous, and garlic spinach.
765325853165256705 2016-08-15 23:14:37 UTC <laurashredder> Shout out to having "make dinner in this August heat" be the closest thing to a workout my body sees today.
765295589571649536 2016-08-15 21:14:21 UTC <laurashredder> A little crumb from this French Toast muffin just fell down my sports bra / in between my boobs.   I've never been more myself.
765193213992902657 2016-08-15 14:27:33 UTC <laurashredder> Never more proud than when I squeeze the very last bit of toothpaste out of the tube.
765191189482070016 2016-08-15 14:19:30 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey this, too, is my dream
765190839438049280 2016-08-15 14:18:07 UTC <laurashredder> @NifMuhammad I thought it was a bunch of red grapes?
765190225928790017 2016-08-15 14:15:41 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles last night I dreamed I held prolonged eye contact w someone I care for & it felt nice, so I guess we had different nights?
765034265436360704 2016-08-14 03:55:57 UTC <laurashredder> Just saw a FB post about a robot that understands speech & makes facial expressions, and so I'm pretty much done with FB forever
765033389024051200 2016-08-14 03:52:28 UTC <laurashredder> Nothing like the Olympics to show u whom of ur usually reasonable guy friends is all about objectifying women over praising their abilities
765030897351524352 2016-08-14 03:42:34 UTC <laurashredder> Just caught a glimpse of my butt in my boy-cut pj briefs in the bathroom mirror & liked it. Three cheers for 2016.
765000442975809536 2016-08-14 01:41:33 UTC <laurashredder> Tired, but, like, how do I not watch another episode of The Get Down rn?
764995376034222080 2016-08-14 01:21:25 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I feel like I haven't watched nearly enough (and it's on my tv every night)
764994626625409024 2016-08-14 01:18:26 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot one of the few Olympic events that requires a partner, yes
764993855372529665 2016-08-14 01:15:22 UTC <laurashredder> Quick PSA: no one will ever have funnier banter than @lcopperpot  & me. You can try for silver though.
764993585565593602 2016-08-14 01:14:18 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot GD Merlin. Ruining things for the human kid before he even gets here.
764992753835139072 2016-08-14 01:11:00 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot and E gets stuck with George's middle name?! This seems wholly unfair
764991552334749696 2016-08-14 01:06:13 UTC <laurashredder> the parade was fun and family-friendly until @lcopperpot came around 
764991156329541632 2016-08-14 01:04:39 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot not really just rain though. More like

764957656691998720 2016-08-14 22:51:32 UTC <laurashredder> I wanna say I didn't add salt to the chicken salad bc I plan on adding pepitas. But it's also bc I'm worried about how much I sweat in it.
764947172420939776 2016-08-14 22:09:52 UTC <laurashredder> As a rule, you know I like you when there are emojis w/your name in my phone. And you know I really like you if it's  or 
764946378145562624 2016-08-14 22:06:43 UTC <laurashredder> We're home from the cape, and it's still 90+ outside. Making chicken salad with red peppers & grapes for dinner & praying it cools down.

764118636193865728 2016-08-12 15:17:34 UTC <laurashredder> Alright. Who is getting me this for my birthday (just two short weeks away )?  http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/call-your-girlfriend-products/bleed-enamel-pin
764106967145152512 2016-08-12 14:31:12 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot please just respond BaaRamEwe
764106869174566912 2016-08-12 14:30:48 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot what if his response is "only an sheeperson would ask such a silly question" ?
764106559861448704 2016-08-12 14:29:34 UTC <laurashredder> I'm the kind of gal who cries whenever she sees anyone else cries and pretty much solely watches tragedies and/or inspirational shows.
764101432303902720 2016-08-12 14:09:12 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot please keep me updated. I am certain Matthew has, no need to ask on my end.
764099923201654785 2016-08-12 14:03:12 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I have a sneaking suspicion that month our younger brothers have used this word at least once.
763900454417891329 2016-08-11 00:50:35 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj 
763880686566735872 2016-08-11 23:32:02 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj which would be like the saddest Freaky Friday-esque experience ever.
763880516777086976 2016-08-11 23:31:22 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj ohhhh. For a second, I thought we swapped states for the evening.
763877519443525632 2016-08-11 23:19:27 UTC <laurashredder> @OmarHolmon @oliviagatwood I assume we mean ABC Family, unfortunately now going by Freeform?
763877164026630149 2016-08-11 23:18:02 UTC <laurashredder> I knew I liked you. https://twitter.com/raychjackson/status/763862768697151490
763875860420100100 2016-08-11 23:12:51 UTC <laurashredder> Best hello ever, tbh.https://twitter.com/jayohessee/status/763865580663439361

763874483396632576 2016-08-11 23:07:23 UTC <laurashredder> @cassandraintroy i did the same thing today.
763868972571824130 2016-08-11 22:45:29 UTC <laurashredder> Can't believe how good this summer has been to me. pic.twitter.com/Md9kMLjmyH
763576536809234433 2016-08-10 03:23:27 UTC <laurashredder> Today was my worst day for eating in a really long time, like nothing nutritious at all. I'm going to wake up STARVING in the morning .
763569988066213888 2016-08-10 02:57:26 UTC <laurashredder> Same, TBH.pic.twitter.com/0ohED17QgX
763565845326987264 2016-08-10 02:40:58 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot that's the most Mom thing I think you've ever said
763561836981682176 2016-08-10 02:25:02 UTC <laurashredder> So I had a really good time at trivia, but I'm totally over ppl prioritizing tinder dates over our nerd crew.
763561565870325760 2016-08-10 02:23:58 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo I'm so over 90% of dudes forever.
763561468008796162 2016-08-10 02:23:34 UTC <laurashredder> @sadsquatch_xo eye roll.
763509862978482176 2016-08-10 22:58:31 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz I was raised that sin is sin, one's no better or worse than another
763499062285000704 2016-08-10 22:15:36 UTC <laurashredder> And for the first time since I've been asked to do so, I registered w/a political party today. I have a lot of mixed feelings about it TBH.
763469135586193412 2016-08-10 20:16:41 UTC <laurashredder> I'm free and legal y'allpic.twitter.com/3fJtNmD3iU
763463188633493504 2016-08-10 19:53:03 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot wish we were doing that together, kitten
763462979178401793 2016-08-10 19:52:13 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I would never tell a pregnant woman that anything she thinks about food is weird
763461896628494337 2016-08-10 19:47:55 UTC <laurashredder> Who knew I'd need a battery stick on a trip to the DMV.
763461362320285696 2016-08-10 19:45:47 UTC <laurashredder> Phones about to die. No outlets anywhere. How will I go on?
763461201238040576 2016-08-10 19:45:09 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot it's incredible what temporal and physical distance allows us to forget / encourages us to romanticize
763460979313283072 2016-08-10 19:44:16 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot this is very true. But it's also hard to ignore what someone else has told you/form a truly neutral opinion after that.
763460780897497088 2016-08-10 19:43:29 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot depends on the purpose for the grudge. And I'm way more likely to cut women slack, forgive them over and over again.
763459911581925380 2016-08-10 19:40:01 UTC <laurashredder> @Berniewatson glad to hear you're getting out of there. Sending good plumbing vibes your way until then.
763459719721811968 2016-08-10 19:39:16 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot let me know if you ever need a pep talk. I've been known as a grudge-holder Olympian in the past.
763459454373400576 2016-08-10 19:38:12 UTC <laurashredder> @Berniewatson damn. What a shit situation. I'm sorry you're dealing with that.
763459240216391680 2016-08-10 19:37:21 UTC <laurashredder> Please send help. I'm basically chugging a share-size skittles right now because I haven't had anything except coffee for the last 6 hours.
763459039145627650 2016-08-10 19:36:33 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot fair, fair.
763457181752651776 2016-08-10 19:29:11 UTC <laurashredder> @Berniewatson what can we do to put pressure on the landlord/contractor to get this corrected?
763456695343382529 2016-08-10 19:27:15 UTC <laurashredder> Best part of today has been watching young women pass their road tests/get their licenses. My grinch heart has grown 3 sizes.

763454872113086464 2016-08-10 19:20:00 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot but also I love you and your optimism
763454715938107392 2016-08-10 19:19:23 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot counterpoint: sometimes people are toxic. Sometimes it's not worth it.
763453423777906689 2016-08-10 19:14:15 UTC <laurashredder> Like seriously though "If you forgive me for being here, I'll forgive you for forgiving me for being here." GOD DAMN.
763452781311262720 2016-08-10 19:11:41 UTC <laurashredder> @Berniewatson That's awful.

763431615842451456 2016-08-10 17:47:35 UTC <laurashredder> Only almost cried the clerk told me I need to go get something else
763431443104145410 2016-08-10 17:46:54 UTC <laurashredder> So even though I have everything the website said I need in order to do this thing, I'm now on campus printing out 1 more proof of address
763423497674747905 2016-08-10 17:15:20 UTC <laurashredder> A man just walked by with a bag of popcorn and like six people nearly jumped out of their chairs because everyone here is starving.
763423052919148544 2016-08-10 17:13:34 UTC <laurashredder> Pretty sure the broken paper clip on the floor in front of me is going to get its license before I do. 
763422050014883840 2016-08-10 17:09:35 UTC <laurashredder> Y'ALL. They just called for G908, and G isn't even a category.pic.twitter.com/N2JYujjdU1
763415554778603520 2016-08-10 16:43:46 UTC <laurashredder> Every person who has held a meaningful/sustained conversation w me today, in which I felt seen as an actual human, has been from the Midwest
763414192951033856 2016-08-10 16:38:21 UTC <laurashredder> If I think about our convo last night, I can still feel stoked off of @peaer_ 's excitement for all thing Parks and Rec, Twin Peaks, & BSG.
763413292794646528 2016-08-10 16:34:47 UTC <laurashredder> To be clear, I don't feel unsafe. I'm just uncertain this isn't going to kill me.
763413033658056704 2016-08-10 16:33:45 UTC <laurashredder> I think I might actually die here.
763412784541470720 2016-08-10 16:32:46 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse 
763402797719183360 2016-08-10 15:53:04 UTC <laurashredder> Omg, y'all. I think I just made a friend at the DMV.
763388904229724165 2016-08-10 14:57:52 UTC <laurashredder> How do I balance not wanting it to matter with knowing it probably does?
763388745697591297 2016-08-10 14:57:14 UTC <laurashredder> If all I was ever seeking was friendship, why does my marital status finds its way into the equation?
763388407267614720 2016-08-10 14:55:54 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I obviously know what's changed since when I was single, but I'm struggling to accept why that changes things.
763388132620374016 2016-08-10 14:54:48 UTC <laurashredder> Not that I'm actively seeking out friendships only with single dudes, but I've just noticed it's been hard to do this lately.
763387842080964608 2016-08-10 14:53:39 UTC <laurashredder> I've been thinking a lot about the difficulties I'm having establishing new friendships with straight single men now that I'm married.
763387008513404928 2016-08-10 14:50:20 UTC <laurashredder> Good to know I'm not the only person feeling down about this DMV wait.pic.twitter.com/Ati7eDqHJ9
763379013507244032 2016-08-10 14:18:34 UTC <laurashredder> Then please tell me why I just held up the line applying lipstick and messing w my hair?
763378819625607169 2016-08-10 14:17:48 UTC <laurashredder> Just wasted 5 mins w a photo machine thinking it'd be on my ID. At the end it's like "this will not print on your card." 
763375972150288384 2016-08-10 14:06:29 UTC <laurashredder> At the DMV and really enjoying how grumpy everyone in line is
763357948815040516 2016-08-10 12:54:52 UTC <laurashredder> Like, "Hey! Here's a person whose name/face you don't remember at all but who once liked you enough to ask to hang out on your public wall!"
763357717503377408 2016-08-10 12:53:57 UTC <laurashredder> IMO FB's memories feature's main purpose is to show me how poor my memory is.
763225376545972224 2016-08-09 04:08:04 UTC <laurashredder> Back from the bar. Splitting a slice with the pup and watching the pilot of Rick & Morty.

763203163021307904 2016-08-09 02:39:48 UTC <laurashredder> @nuggety it's called "pucker up" and it's perfect
763201678799757312 2016-08-09 02:33:54 UTC <laurashredder> Yes, I'm talking about myself
763200320935718913 2016-08-09 02:28:30 UTC <laurashredder> God damn, is there anything sexier than a woman with fresh red nail polish?
763196722084507648 2016-08-09 02:14:12 UTC <laurashredder> Sitting in your house is for suckers; it's after 10 and I'm outside y'all.
763191313571442688 2016-08-09 01:52:43 UTC <laurashredder> Literally just said "My point is that I would like to avoid talking about women as food if possible" when an extended metaphor went too far
763188188542304256 2016-08-09 01:40:18 UTC <laurashredder> I'm not sure if it's an effective long-term coping mechanism, but I completely endorse. I've been there too, love.
763184384786718721 2016-08-09 01:25:11 UTC <laurashredder> Bartender just told me my earrings don't match. Like, tell me something I don't know, buddy.

763183439541665792 2016-08-09 01:21:25 UTC <laurashredder> transitions are HARD. Give yourself a lot of room & grace in moments like this. I still have them about Ohio.
763183189741436932 2016-08-09 01:20:26 UTC <laurashredder> aka the only single friend you have in the area that has nothing better to do but meet you at a show w bands they've never heard of
763182808848338944 2016-08-09 01:18:55 UTC <laurashredder> LOL to thinking you can manage going to a local show by yourself & being there less than 10 mins before calling in reinforcements.
763176432172429312 2016-08-09 00:53:35 UTC <laurashredder> When you live downtown, sometimes it takes more time to get ready for the show and to get to the show.
763160527736606725 2016-08-09 23:50:23 UTC <laurashredder> Decided to put my pants back on and go to a punk rock show.
763140624350580736 2016-08-09 22:31:17 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot yeah. Apparently I'm the problem in the situation. ???
763112354326478850 2016-08-09 20:38:57 UTC <laurashredder> Had a "friend" ask me why I feel the need to "fill Twitter" with posts about being sexually harassed. LOL.

762438424443793412 2016-08-07 00:01:00 UTC <laurashredder> Just bought Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and the latest issue of Ms. magazine for the flight home. 
762427737613008896 2016-08-07 23:18:32 UTC <laurashredder> @poemsabouttoast just checked into my flight 
762415835411419136 2016-08-07 22:31:14 UTC <laurashredder> But also there are multiple stores that just sell cheese, so maybe I'll move in.pic.twitter.com/v8lFsspH4L  at Mall of America

762309449457373184 2016-08-07 15:28:30 UTC <laurashredder> @AllisonTruj 
762309076940304384 2016-08-07 15:27:01 UTC <laurashredder> Neil preaching this morning.https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/762302949028728833
762274106221879296 2016-08-07 13:08:03 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey he said it helps him combat his imposter syndrome 
762062859618521088 2016-08-06 23:08:38 UTC <laurashredder> Apparently Hiltons are so fancy they have enough money to have nonsensical plumbing plans
762062659785072640 2016-08-06 23:07:51 UTC <laurashredder> I seriously almost peed myself bc this hotel doesn't have all their bathrooms in the same spot on each floor.
762061145876275200 2016-08-06 23:01:50 UTC <laurashredder> I quickly realized it was a wrong place/wrong time situation, but the kept going because I had to own and she deserved it
762059856861728768 2016-08-06 22:56:42 UTC <laurashredder> when you snap bc a woman panelist offers to show an arrogant dude w a BS ? her work/totally kills the defense of her stat analysis #poetwife
762056470045208577 2016-08-06 22:43:15 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey Literally w/in 10 mins of tweeting this a (straight white) dude told me he was going to a panel just to tell ppl they're wrong 
762056120135323648 2016-08-06 22:41:52 UTC <laurashredder> Way too many ads on IG today
762055341613854720 2016-08-06 22:38:46 UTC <laurashredder> But when Forrest Gump says "life is like a box of chocolates," it's like wildly optimistic because ITS ALL STILL CHOCOLATE
762018055731810304 2016-08-06 20:10:36 UTC <laurashredder> When a conversation comes to a natural ending point, but inside you're like "Nooooo!" because it was actually really fun talking w them.
762016917372538880 2016-08-06 20:06:05 UTC <laurashredder> Imposter syndrome is real AF, but most people are actually not interested in actively making you look/feel stupid
762015587866247168 2016-08-06 20:00:48 UTC <laurashredder> I need there to be a butter emoji ASAP.
762014513587560450 2016-08-06 19:56:32 UTC <laurashredder> Networking without booze is my hell.
761979806296576002 2016-08-06 17:38:37 UTC <laurashredder> Earlier today, I was in a panel where one presenter was the most hyped I've ever seen someone be and another was potentially comatose.
761950148427706368 2016-08-06 15:40:46 UTC <laurashredder> MOST OF THIS (esp 7 & 15) but they're wizards for F's sake, why would Voldy have to of sexed up Bella to get a baby?https://www.buzzfeed.com/jemimaskelley/more-holes-than-a-sieve?bffbmain&ref=bffbmain&utm_term=.etereReA4#.umG2b8bl7

761916936091373569 2016-08-06 13:28:47 UTC <laurashredder> At a professional conference that matters for my career, and last night I told far too many ppl "Twitter is where I do my best work" 
761915852610412544 2016-08-06 13:24:29 UTC <laurashredder> it honestly was magic

761758318033379328 2016-08-05 02:58:30 UTC <laurashredder> When you're not even with your poet spouse, but you're still paying attention to the #nps2016 updates.
761707352340828160 2016-08-05 23:35:59 UTC <laurashredder> A bunch of prominent feminist scholars just kept buying me drinks, and now I'm drunk, and the sun isn't even down.
761644166447177728 2016-08-05 19:24:54 UTC <laurashredder> My uber driver has been four minutes away for 6 minutes.
761626471915847680 2016-08-05 18:14:35 UTC <laurashredder> Sorry, @NifMuhammadpic.twitter.com/olAJUUishN
761548044349300738 2016-08-05 13:02:57 UTC <laurashredder> I've got on brown & black shoes and mixed metal jewelry. Teenage me would be HORRIFIED.
761535675019603968 2016-08-05 12:13:48 UTC <laurashredder> What a pic to come up in my FB memories; what a shirt, @willevanswrites; what a time to be alive.pic.twitter.com/xbhHqu8ozU
761531614044102656 2016-08-05 11:57:40 UTC <laurashredder> Breakfast in bed & Dead Poets Society 
761449902677176320 2016-08-04 06:32:58 UTC <laurashredder> I just kinda wish I could remember being in your dream.
761436327896227841 2016-08-04 05:39:02 UTC <laurashredder> @JessRiz @AllisonTruj honestly this whole convo just filled my heart with joy
761408801434021888 2016-08-04 03:49:39 UTC <laurashredder> @jaykayG 
761392626062938112 2016-08-04 02:45:22 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I have a crush on Miles Teller, Kate Mara AND Michael B Jordan, but this Fantastic Four movie SUCKS.
761387649462525953 2016-08-04 02:25:36 UTC <laurashredder> I'm not drunk, you're drunkpic.twitter.com/7f9QviO2MP
761385983455604736 2016-08-04 02:18:58 UTC <laurashredder> I'm a little drunk and wandering the streets of Minneapolis. Tbh, I think I might be in love with this city.
761381760462577664 2016-08-04 02:02:12 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I do what I can. Also 
761360118764023809 2016-08-04 00:36:12 UTC <laurashredder> Just jaywalked, and the looks on people's faces told me I'm not in CT anymore.
761325527026114560 2016-08-04 22:18:45 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot OMG. I love that you follow Travis Barker.

761317428794040321 2016-08-04 21:46:34 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I'm not trying to be all about myself or anything, but how do you talk yourself into a shower when looking so fly?
761315422813630464 2016-08-04 21:38:36 UTC <laurashredder> THIS. This all day. http://nyti.ms/2aBRp0s
761311629661188096 2016-08-04 21:23:31 UTC <laurashredder> When you take your hair out of an up-do, and it looks like you spent an hour curling it. Minnesota + my hair = BFF pic.twitter.com/95c0PYbSCn
761284991409987584 2016-08-04 19:37:40 UTC <laurashredder> Totally finished w/my real conference responsibilities, and I have no idea if I should nap, drink, see a movie, get ice cream, or a tattoo
761044715617734657 2016-08-03 03:42:54 UTC <laurashredder> Just got called a unicorn. I'll take it.
760897880991215616 2016-08-03 17:59:26 UTC <laurashredder> When you miss @lcopperpot something fierce, but Groundhog Day is on TV so you kinda feel like she's with you. 
760881893311062020 2016-08-03 16:55:54 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot just laughed uncomfortably
760877588969431040 2016-08-03 16:38:48 UTC <laurashredder> @poemsabouttoast I can bring a pic of you to dinner one night?
760877488142635008 2016-08-03 16:38:24 UTC <laurashredder> @poemsabouttoast me too. Any restaurants you'd suggest I check out?
760876148574171136 2016-08-03 16:33:04 UTC <laurashredder> On Sunday, a friend BLEW MY MF-ING MIND by offering to put two slices of cheese on my burger https://twitter.com/xplodingunicorn/status/760875476227387392
760875860555476992 2016-08-03 16:31:56 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I looked him right in the eye, and deadpan said "yes, first vacation ever. I chose Minneapolis for my first vacation ever."
760875487056965633 2016-08-03 16:30:27 UTC <laurashredder> @joeydillon so sad. this salad is giving me life rn.
760874215981641729 2016-08-03 16:25:24 UTC <laurashredder> Also just discovered there's no salad emoji / what's wrong with America
760873964562329600 2016-08-03 16:24:24 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I think he just wanted to make us feel incompetent as he mansplained
760873805669605376 2016-08-03 16:23:46 UTC <laurashredder> Omg the Salad Bar at the Nicollet Mall is my jam.
760833060690538496 2016-08-03 13:41:51 UTC <laurashredder> He also asked if this was our first vacation, and if we were from Nebraska. WTF.
760828086384373760 2016-08-03 13:22:05 UTC <laurashredder> Been in Minnesota 20 mins, already had trams mansplained to us.
760821491885678594 2016-08-03 12:55:53 UTC <laurashredder> Which is to say, the patriarchy expects me to spend money to look "professional" in so many ways
760821289032437760 2016-08-03 12:55:05 UTC <laurashredder> Now that I've landed, my first priority is finding a salon to get my nails done 
760820312812482564 2016-08-03 12:51:12 UTC <laurashredder> How is flight a thing we ever figured out? How have we not fallen out of the sky yet? https://www.instagram.com/p/BIpa4q7gVpv/
760819601772904449 2016-08-03 12:48:23 UTC <laurashredder> What up, Minneapolis?
760798261838016512 2016-08-03 11:23:35 UTC <laurashredder> I'm on a plane, in the air, and I paid way too much money to access the internet.
760776021654265856 2016-08-03 09:55:12 UTC <laurashredder> On the plane before 6 am. Thank god for coffee, even if it is McDonald's. 
760775769517858816 2016-08-03 09:54:12 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi this is getting outrageous
760664166386524160 2016-08-02 02:30:44 UTC <laurashredder> When she informed me the Starbucks near her house won't be open when we leave for the airport, I nearly died right then to avoid tomorrow AM
760663797413675008 2016-08-02 02:29:16 UTC <laurashredder> Also. I'm sleeping on a couch at a friend's house because tomorrow we have a flight early as hell. My alarm is set to 3:40. 
760663440948101120 2016-08-02 02:27:51 UTC <laurashredder> Just put on my sleep shirt, and it smells like a beautiful day in a meadow. I will never not use those laundry scent enhancers again.
760646109974917120 2016-08-02 01:18:59 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot PLEASE TELL ME WE WILL SEE THIS TOGETHERhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViuDsy7yb8M
760585444363014145 2016-08-02 21:17:55 UTC <laurashredder> OMG has anyone else seen The Boy Next Door w/J-Lo? Because the last ten minutes of this thing are WILD.
760494487164555264 2016-08-02 15:16:29 UTC <laurashredder> Just kidding. I made myself some delicious mushroom scrambled eggs, and they are EVERYTHING.
760483447823622144 2016-08-02 14:32:37 UTC <laurashredder> When you're so hungry you think you might be too weak to make breakfast...

759800429332967424 2016-07-31 17:18:33 UTC <laurashredder> Just found this old note on my phone; must have been feeling snarky at a slam last September... ?pic.twitter.com/eaEtswWYaN
759796957120520192 2016-07-31 17:04:45 UTC <laurashredder> The problem with a two hour train ride is having a bladder and standards for bathrooms.
759794837113729024 2016-07-31 16:56:20 UTC <laurashredder> He just got off the train, so I guess we'll never know if she's going to let him "make it up" to her w/multiple winky & heart eye emojis
759794278918975488 2016-07-31 16:54:07 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I feel the same way about looking at people's hands in a card game: If you're putting it out for me to see, I'm looking! Lol
759785798178922497 2016-07-31 16:20:25 UTC <laurashredder> He just keeps checking his phone bc she's been silent-treating for the last 10 mins or so. This can't just be about a hug, my people.
759780871834566656 2016-07-31 16:00:50 UTC <laurashredder> @laurashredder it's been five minutes, they are still talking about the hug.
759779757898817536 2016-07-31 15:56:24 UTC <laurashredder> @RaychJackson thanks, darling! I hope you're well!!!
759779342171906048 2016-07-31 15:54:45 UTC <laurashredder> Dude on the train next to me having a text fight with his GF bc he didn't hug her goodbye. WHAT A LIFE.
759779003255386112 2016-07-31 15:53:25 UTC <laurashredder> It's not even noon, and I'm already on the train back to New Haven.
759777267916673024 2016-07-31 15:46:31 UTC <laurashredder> Oh, also. Please promise me this is in your plans for E once he's upright, @lcopperpotpic.twitter.com/v1Cm3P2rXe

759774766328901632 2016-07-31 15:36:34 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot can we please do a Bridget Jones double feature together when it comes out on DVD/on demand?
759774549151973376 2016-07-31 15:35:43 UTC <laurashredder> So many awesome women in the city this morning; wish we were all hanging out.
759773152524337152 2016-07-31 15:30:10 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mJsvmscPY9w&autoplay=1 AHHHHHHHHH
759760549798354944 2016-07-31 14:40:05 UTC <laurashredder> Big time brunch decisions being made here. @ Penelope https://www.instagram.com/p/BIh49d-Ad5m/
759718120667934720 2016-07-31 11:51:29 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot and how about another?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IxxgGyp8CcU&autoplay=1
759709617261797376 2016-07-31 11:17:42 UTC <laurashredder> OMG, it's like Harry Potter cosplaying The Black Paradepic.twitter.com/KAWv1xVtCe
759709000518791168 2016-07-31 11:15:15 UTC <laurashredder> On my way to brunch w/Ohio friends in the city before a massage appt and a cookout back in CT. Today's really doing some good work.
759707264089489408 2016-07-31 11:08:21 UTC <laurashredder> On the train and headed your way, @JessiBehrendsen @hatmadeofeagles !!!
759701995653623808 2016-07-31 10:47:25 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles I've got cough drops in my purse! Hope you're feeling better though!
759586125233225729 2016-07-30 03:06:59 UTC <laurashredder> I hope she was pleasantly surprised to be around to see all of her grandchildren graduate high school.
759585849017335808 2016-07-30 03:05:53 UTC <laurashredder> and it's the early 90's, and she was talking about how she "probably wouldn't be around much longer." I heard her say that until 2013.
759585483630444544 2016-07-30 03:04:26 UTC <laurashredder> She was also one of the most naturally pessimistic people I've ever encountered. Like, I was watching an old home video the other day...
759585006566146048 2016-07-30 03:02:32 UTC <laurashredder> and she kept surviving. She remains one of the strongest and hardest working women I've ever met. I'm proud to be her granddaughter.
759584625102557184 2016-07-30 03:01:01 UTC <laurashredder> Today marks 3 years since my grandma passed. She worked in tobacco fields her entire life, she survived the tragic loss of a child, ...
759582298366935040 2016-07-30 02:51:46 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I'm down to problematize how Bridget Jones' life still seems to revolve around man problems, but also OMG THERES A NEW B JONES MOVIE!!
759580509148155904 2016-07-30 02:44:40 UTC <laurashredder> I'm in a rare mood of adding to the people I follow on SM, which is to say I've followed one person on Twitter and three on IG tonight.
759566434787811328 2016-07-30 01:48:44 UTC <laurashredder> Was horizontal & comfortable, but had to get up to paint my nails bc I'm brunching w @hatmadeofeagles & @JessiBehrendsen tomorrow. 
759531790373625856 2016-07-30 23:31:04 UTC <laurashredder> Hey @kckearns, we're at Dinosaur BBQ and thinking of you. 
759518578345476098 2016-07-30 22:38:34 UTC <laurashredder> At the aquarium. What kind of Pokemon is this?pic.twitter.com/7qOsAihRvh
759454826770141185 2016-07-30 18:25:15 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot kindred spirits!!!
759446419166167040 2016-07-30 17:51:50 UTC <laurashredder> I'm a monster, I know.
759443042990522372 2016-07-30 17:38:25 UTC <laurashredder> I know this makes me weird, but I really love showering in the middle of the day.
759244495938519040 2016-07-29 04:29:28 UTC <laurashredder> Hanif asked me what I thought we should do this weekend; can't just tell him I want him to take out the trash, right?
759240006607208450 2016-07-29 04:11:38 UTC <laurashredder> Oh, all of the things I would do and/or give up to just be over this head cold already
759209245548089344 2016-07-29 02:09:24 UTC <laurashredder> Is it possible that we will just never get caught up on Food Network Star? How are there so many episodes yet on the DVR?
759147173888008193 2016-07-29 22:02:45 UTC <laurashredder> "Say you'll see me again / even if it's just pretend" is some wildly vulnerable shit, and I've totally been there.
759143933666594816 2016-07-29 21:49:52 UTC <laurashredder> When you've been at work so long you don't remember parking the car
759116545889009664 2016-07-29 20:01:02 UTC <laurashredder> Yeah, I'm an adult with a real job/real office. So what if I want to listen to Simple Plan & eat microwave mac and cheese?
759115935294914560 2016-07-29 19:58:37 UTC <laurashredder> OMG @lcopperpot; I can't believe I didn't find this until after your bb shower.  https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/products/future-voter-onepiece
759036413761335296 2016-07-29 14:42:37 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I'm in a QU vlogpost
759020418216910848 2016-07-29 13:39:04 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot the face is good enough, right? Just need lips and hair now, right?pic.twitter.com/Qp703o9Ahj
759019116564914177 2016-07-29 13:33:53 UTC <laurashredder> Probably the morning of my on-camera interview isn't the best time to google "quick contouring videos," huh?
758871456759492608 2016-07-28 03:47:09 UTC <laurashredder> I slept so much today, but I somehow now must sleep a regular amount tonight bc tomorrow I have to be on camera, build a chair, adult, etc
758860217748639744 2016-07-28 03:02:29 UTC <laurashredder> Jk. I'm proudly crying.
758855437181554688 2016-07-28 02:43:29 UTC <laurashredder> Weird to have to say this both at the end of the AP music awards and during HRC's speech rn, but TOLERANCE IS INSUFFICIENT.
758853076874768384 2016-07-28 02:34:06 UTC <laurashredder> I remember feeling so defeated in 2008, not bc I wasn't stoked on Obama, but bc I really wasn't sure we'd ever get here. #ImWithHer
758851407608815616 2016-07-28 02:27:29 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 me too!!
758851273445605376 2016-07-28 02:26:57 UTC <laurashredder> You're crying.
758845284751335424 2016-07-28 02:03:09 UTC <laurashredder> Made myself some popcorn for @HillaryClinton's speech. Promptly ate it all, and Chelsea's just now coming out.pic.twitter.com/Aq6qXiPcM1
758831769248411648 2016-07-28 01:09:26 UTC <laurashredder>  Give me just one night (una noche) where a strange man doesn't say something nasty to me on the street 
758754505043378176 2016-07-28 20:02:25 UTC <laurashredder> Not off work, but off the calendar.
758754387674169345 2016-07-28 20:01:57 UTC <laurashredder> After a full day powered by cold meds yesterday (work, hike, bar), I've slept for about 15 hrs today. It's kinda like taking Thursday off.
758750706807418883 2016-07-28 19:47:20 UTC <laurashredder> My mom kept calling this ark a replica a couple weeks ago. She was a school teacher. We need science literacy.   http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/07/28/487737404/there-s-no-controversy-lets-stop-failing-our-children-on-evolution?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20160728
758677964833914881 2016-07-28 14:58:17 UTC <laurashredder> If I had Hermione's time turner, I would probably just use it to catch up on sleep.
758517320767668224 2016-07-27 04:19:56 UTC <laurashredder> Obviously I was p shaken up, I didn't even notice that autocorrect changed urgency to urgently until now.
758512503471169539 2016-07-27 04:00:47 UTC <laurashredder> on a summer night, lost in happy thoughts about their friends. I want to not need keychain weapons. I want everyone's loved ones to be safe.
758512095893815296 2016-07-27 03:59:10 UTC <laurashredder> safe more often than many of my loved ones. I want everyone to be afforded the opportunity to walk from their car to their door on...
758511118796980225 2016-07-27 03:55:17 UTC <laurashredder> I made it home fine, but needed a while before I felt okay again. I believe safety is an illusion, afforded by privilege, & I know I feel...
758510569439846400 2016-07-27 03:53:06 UTC <laurashredder> I didn't feel safe. No one else was on the street with us, and all I could do was clutch my cat keychain weapon & walk w/ more urgently...
758509924062224384 2016-07-27 03:50:32 UTC <laurashredder> Tonight after trivia, I had a man follow behind me for over a block, making kissing/sex noises at me the whole time....
758500904664440833 2016-07-27 03:14:42 UTC <laurashredder> My nerd crew. (We came in 2nd of 25 teams tonight at trivia!)pic.twitter.com/026YaSAwfq

758499041584046080 2016-07-27 03:07:18 UTC <laurashredder> Honestly this makes me so happy. I'm not the only person to have been a horny teen w/0 regard for poison ivy...https://twitter.com/mattzollerseitz/status/758436178504843264
758405332527902720 2016-07-27 20:54:56 UTC <laurashredder> Hiked the tower trail to discover the tower closed for renovations, which means no skyline pics. Its almost like did that hike even happen?
758401152065105921 2016-07-27 20:38:19 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vRWfoAPUit4&vidve=5727&autoplay=1
758309012265799680 2016-07-27 14:32:11 UTC <laurashredder> Is it bad if my favorite Taylor Swift songs are covers of Taylor Swift songs?
758294044812402688 2016-07-27 13:32:43 UTC <laurashredder> I'm the kind of woman who, when a little yogurt drops on my leg, I just rub it in & hope it's moisturizing instead of sticky.
758274769221476352 2016-07-27 12:16:07 UTC <laurashredder> LOL to your alarm going off while you're sipping on hot coffee / you've already done dishes, cleaned the kitchen, cut up strawberries.
758269573875527680 2016-07-27 11:55:29 UTC <laurashredder> Unfortunately for her, we do dishes before 7 am in band t's now too.
758269028267859968 2016-07-27 11:53:18 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot I remember watching this scene for the first time and thinking maybe I didn't fully understand adult love.
758264478161043456 2016-07-27 11:35:14 UTC <laurashredder> Less than 6 hrs asleep. Why am I awake?
758160078541324290 2016-07-26 04:40:23 UTC <laurashredder> Just found myself down a dark internet hole, searching for Wheatus shirts for sale.
758154306537259009 2016-07-26 04:17:27 UTC <laurashredder> I think early HS me would be super comforted to know that we still sleep in band t-shirts.
758144977096548356 2016-07-26 03:40:22 UTC <laurashredder> I bought a new denim jacket this evening, & I'm so excited for the patches/pins in my not-too-distant future. It could be 2016 or 2006 tbh.
758143204105547776 2016-07-26 03:33:20 UTC <laurashredder> I gotta believe he doesn't hate to say this at all....https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/758121939365982208
758142776777277444 2016-07-26 03:31:38 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles all actual medicine tastes nasty IMO. It's a dreadful balancing act between feeling better & not swallowing chemicals
758137715770744834 2016-07-26 03:11:31 UTC <laurashredder> I really don't need Meryl Streep's take on any of this.
758126523761172484 2016-07-26 02:27:03 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles have you tried these? They're magic. http://www.cepacol.com/products/search/extra-strength-lozenges/
758106087832846336 2016-07-26 01:05:50 UTC <laurashredder> Weezer's been breaking my heart since before I ever had a broken heart
758105901937164288 2016-07-26 01:05:06 UTC <laurashredder> I talked for hours to your wallet photograph / And you just listened / You laughed enchanted by my intellect / Or maybe you didn't
758103670785445889 2016-07-26 00:56:14 UTC <laurashredder> I'm completely obsessed w sweet pickled garlic & it's all thanks to @lcopperpot, a human gal's best friend / a vampire gal's worst enemy.
758099909203681280 2016-07-26 00:41:17 UTC <laurashredder> I'm sorry, but what the fuck did I say to suggest I'm a gym fan?pic.twitter.com/Kem0I9eGHs
758097627753897984 2016-07-26 00:32:13 UTC <laurashredder> Just bought four different pairs of jeans bc every pair I tried on fit. P sure the world must be ending.
757856470436225025 2016-07-26 08:33:57 UTC <laurashredder> Still up; still thinking about 
757844010111160321 2016-07-26 07:44:26 UTC <laurashredder> Guess I'll call or see you around...
757843658846580736 2016-07-26 07:43:02 UTC <laurashredder> The Facebook memories function really makes me want to just start posting lyrics by themselves on social media again.
757831005944160256 2016-07-25 06:52:46 UTC <laurashredder> Which is to say, I'm not a fan of this condom-centric quiz, duh.
757829497332740096 2016-07-25 06:46:46 UTC <laurashredder> But also there are plenty of ways to have sex where this knowledge is totally uselesshttps://twitter.com/buzzfeed/status/757825539491061760
757820515356520448 2016-07-25 06:11:05 UTC <laurashredder> Alarms going off in 4 hrs, and I'm laying here thinking about spicy chicken sandwiches
757818246976319488 2016-07-25 06:02:04 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse after 2 years and few friends to show for my efforts, I'd absolutely try it
757817854079098884 2016-07-25 06:00:30 UTC <laurashredder> Been trying to sleep on and off for hours. This is cool.  Psych!
757816428321910784 2016-07-25 05:54:50 UTC <laurashredder> Still one of my all time fav photoshttps://twitter.com/laurashredder/status/659572524590743552
757808970539032581 2016-07-25 05:25:12 UTC <laurashredder> A Pokemon Go, but for ppl. Instead of "catching" them, you just meet up for coffee, talk TV/politics/lipstick & see if y'all can be friends
757801070269599744 2016-07-25 04:53:49 UTC <laurashredder> Taking contacts out has got to be the closest most dudes get to the relief of taking a bra off at the end of a day.
757794636165361668 2016-07-25 04:28:15 UTC <laurashredder> Nervously laughing at ppl jokes about Melania stealing from FLOTUS's speech in 4 years. Like, honestly, I can't do this again.
757791955191422977 2016-07-25 04:17:35 UTC <laurashredder> I love Samantha Bee almost too much.https://twitter.com/fullfrontalsamb/status/757773093448196097

757786337659408384 2016-07-25 03:55:16 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse ... Still waiting 
757773877305016320 2016-07-25 03:05:45 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot De Niro was absolute perfection. I want him as my intern. 
757773648652632064 2016-07-25 03:04:51 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot FOR REAL. Plus he looked like a Furby.
757772855530708993 2016-07-25 03:01:42 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot he's a fucking weenie
757766053573320704 2016-07-25 02:34:40 UTC <laurashredder> Just watched The Intern & I ed it but also hated that she stayed with her husband. Like, I know life is complicated, but WTF. Crying 4ver.
757763133851176960 2016-07-25 02:23:04 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot like I can't wait to take pics of E & caption them "MY BEST FRIEND MADE THIS PERFECT HUMAN SPECIMEN"
757762471570661376 2016-07-25 02:20:26 UTC <laurashredder> Just sitting here thinking about how @lcopperpot is going to be a mama in less than 60 days, & I became overwhelmed w pride/awe/joy.
757736188010692608 2016-07-25 00:35:59 UTC <laurashredder> @kaysarahsera OHMYGOODNESS. The Tim Tam Slam is where it's at. Like drinking tiramisu!!!
757729400729309184 2016-07-25 00:09:01 UTC <laurashredder> Hey Chicago pals! My FAV tattooer is doing a guest spot near ya in Aug! Get at her at 27tattoosbyapryl@gmail.compic.twitter.com/19gPHtWFZb

757709186587303936 2016-07-25 22:48:42 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 @mrsgeedeck nah, but I also wear one pieces to swim in, so maybe I'm just more comfortable getting naked in a stall than most
757688985988767745 2016-07-25 21:28:26 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 I LOVE my jumpsuit!!!
757688889884762112 2016-07-25 21:28:03 UTC <laurashredder> @clairehelene7 YEA YEA YEA
757682226972725248 2016-07-25 21:01:34 UTC <laurashredder> Feeling like the fact that he thought his word would be enough to convince me is part of what's wrong w society
757681975129956355 2016-07-25 21:00:34 UTC <laurashredder> My cashier just flung a lightbulb to the floor, ran over to pick it up, shook it & said "it doesn't look like there's anything wrong w it"
757671931172847616 2016-07-25 20:20:39 UTC <laurashredder> B/c laying on this bed in IKEA for hours on end isn't doing anything for me.pic.twitter.com/EtpQEkKl7j
757671717842087938 2016-07-25 20:19:49 UTC <laurashredder> Wondering where to hang out in/around this city to make friends...
757663386842828800 2016-07-25 19:46:42 UTC <laurashredder> How was I ever expected not to marry @NifMuhammad when the 1st mix he made me had The Rocket Summer, blink, & Velvet Underground on it?

751150914338164736 2016-07-07 20:28:28 UTC <laurashredder> So much No Doubt on the radio in Columbus. Not really complaining, but also not not complaining.

750799023980761088 2016-07-06 21:10:11 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles thought I peeped ya in Miranova / you were going to walk by me, so I hopped out the car. Alas, my eyes deceived me.
750796270177030144 2016-07-06 20:59:14 UTC <laurashredder> Wore purple lipstick for most of the afternoon. Feelings powerful.
750350284354908160 2016-07-05 15:27:03 UTC <laurashredder> Kinda just want to shout out looking at myself in the mirror today and liking my body for the first time in a while
750347622255304705 2016-07-05 15:16:28 UTC <laurashredder> Just put on my glasses after having put in my contacts. Had a mini freak out when my vision got blurry.

749796082973024256 2016-07-03 02:44:51 UTC <laurashredder> Running into / hanging with @kckearns at the Brand New concert tonight made the world that much better and smaller
749791163922653184 2016-07-03 02:25:18 UTC <laurashredder> Brand New playing Sowing Season  @ DTE Theater Pine Knob Clarkston, MI https://www.instagram.com/p/BHbDaLLDx3D/
749788750549508098 2016-07-03 02:15:43 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse damn, if that's all it takes to be BFF, I'll can start asking after you lol
749784969564880896 2016-07-03 02:00:41 UTC <laurashredder> Considering this time last week I was waking up to my first full day in Ho Chi Minh, the last 7 days have been physiologically confusing AF
749784295485702144 2016-07-03 01:58:01 UTC <laurashredder> Also, Jesse Lacey looks just like if @billyeichner and @samsax1 had a baby tonight
749783162138554368 2016-07-03 01:53:30 UTC <laurashredder> The sun was setting at 630 when I was in Vietnam last week, so the fact that it's almost 10 and still not dark is BLOWING MY MIND
749778389066735620 2016-07-03 01:34:32 UTC <laurashredder> Jesse Lacey is wearing a Patagonia hat so p much both my impressions of the band and that brand are tarnished
749777721803276289 2016-07-03 01:31:53 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse I'm currently watching Brand New play, and over every song I heard your voice saying "Jesse Lacey is such an asshole."
749777180406710272 2016-07-03 01:29:44 UTC <laurashredder> My little brother turns 25 today, and I'm celebrating by seeing two bands I loved in high school. I'm a great big sister.
749768013986103296 2016-07-03 00:53:19 UTC <laurashredder> We found a spot on the lawn, and we are now fully immersed in outdoor concert culture... pic.twitter.com/AVXrCj3l78
749681151594336256 2016-07-03 19:08:09 UTC <laurashredder> So glad to get to see @NifMuhammad's family for a minute! And stoked about this Eid goody bag!! pic.twitter.com/DvwKed4Vtm
749669581438881792 2016-07-03 18:22:11 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey you don't think that was the order the trends came in ? Pits before legs? Idk...
749595727534366721 2016-07-03 13:28:42 UTC <laurashredder> Legs, then pits, then pubes. Society maybe just kept adding to the parts of our body that "need" shaven to keep us from forming a coup.
749573892889571328 2016-07-03 12:01:57 UTC <laurashredder> That's some real Sunday morning vulnerability shit right there
749570568270274560 2016-07-03 11:48:44 UTC <laurashredder> This morning, I'm tracing them with my fingers, feeling thankful for being here.
749570408744124416 2016-07-03 11:48:06 UTC <laurashredder> Yesterday, I used my melanoma scars to try to scare a teenage girl into sunscreen use.

749416621391876100 2016-07-02 01:37:00 UTC <laurashredder> @allysehuey lol. Yo, while I'm in Columbus, can I see you and the babe?
749296995781734401 2016-07-02 17:41:39 UTC <laurashredder> Hotel selfie / I've decided to re-embrace messy bun pigtails / I'm not quite sure what year it https://www.instagram.com/p/BHXir-3jpBx/
749285883476578304 2016-07-02 16:57:30 UTC <laurashredder> Wouldn't it be great if we all were sold the truth about how beautiful we are, as we are?
749285738987094016 2016-07-02 16:56:55 UTC <laurashredder> There were ads for whitening creams all across SE Asia, and now I'm back to the world of bronzer and tanning beds...
749267481248854016 2016-07-02 15:44:22 UTC <laurashredder> 3) Oh? That's what that phrase me? OPPS! Looking dumb in front of my students for months at a time
749267330006474753 2016-07-02 15:43:46 UTC <laurashredder> 2) Which direction is hot? Strange faucets and other frustrations
749266846390620162 2016-07-02 15:41:51 UTC <laurashredder> Some contenders for the movie adaptation of my life:  1) Been on the road three hours, already lost 2 hair ties: the Laura Willis story...
749259474108579840 2016-07-02 15:12:33 UTC <laurashredder> Re-reading this this morning, it kinda sounds like I was hanging with Mike and Sully. My stomach definitely wishes that was true.
749259183061602304 2016-07-02 15:11:24 UTC <laurashredder> For the 2nd morning in a row, I woke up, looked around, had NO IDEA what country I was in, & full on panicked until I saw @NifMuhammad
749152420421394432 2016-07-02 08:07:10 UTC <laurashredder> I'm still awake. Between the jet lag and the Monsters, I'm not sure if/when I'll ever sleep again.
749130040307224577 2016-07-01 06:38:14 UTC <laurashredder> While waiting on Hanif to check is in at the hotel, fireworks went off in front of me. It might be 230AM, but Ohio is killing the 4th
749129500097703936 2016-07-01 06:36:05 UTC <laurashredder> & I admitted to myself how exhausted I am when I got choked up singing "Goodbye Earl" 
749129270279204864 2016-07-01 06:35:10 UTC <laurashredder> Idk if Hanif got a Tidal acct so I could listen to Sum41, Savage Garden, Dixie Chicks, & Destiny's Child, but that's what just happened. 
749128737350946816 2016-07-01 06:33:03 UTC <laurashredder> My body is at least 40% Monster energy drink by now, but we made it to our hotel, so #worthit ?
749082573385728000 2016-07-01 03:29:37 UTC <laurashredder> OMG We're finally in Ohio.
749066103771439105 2016-07-01 02:24:10 UTC <laurashredder> this is adorable

748190771270955012 2016-06-29 16:25:55 UTC <laurashredder> Hey @NifMuhammad, slowly but surely, I'm heading home! 
748171761435369472 2016-06-29 15:10:22 UTC <laurashredder> Very sweaty waiting to go thru immigration at the airport, and it's just the beginning of a 20+ hr travel session. 
747931488729993216 2016-06-28 23:15:37 UTC <laurashredder> It's our last day of our trip. A bittersweet and action packed day is ahead of us!
747689854893428739 2016-06-28 07:15:27 UTC <laurashredder> Beach day / island day / best hair day  @ Phu Quoc, Kin Giang, Vietnam https://www.instagram.com/p/BHMH2BwjVTe/
747081368899747842 2016-06-26 14:57:33 UTC <laurashredder> @cassandraintroy but is there ENOUGH parkour?
747080815096410113 2016-06-26 14:55:21 UTC <laurashredder> & also extreme frustration at how inadequate "American aggression" is / how unwilling so many are to call US war crimes what they are
747080006325567489 2016-06-26 14:52:08 UTC <laurashredder> Spent the afternoon at the Vietnam War Remnants museum. Felt a lot of feelings, mostly angry heartbreak at what humans will do to each other
747079114654244866 2016-06-26 14:48:35 UTC <laurashredder> Honoring this, @potockbr recently said to me "I'm shoving this moment in my mouth right now." 
747078853030346752 2016-06-26 14:47:33 UTC <laurashredder> In the "eat pray love" tradition, I've called our trip both an "eat think eat" trip as well as, more appropriate at times, "eat eat eat"
747066667323129856 2016-06-26 13:59:07 UTC <laurashredder> Just looked down at dinner and realized my pants are on inside-out. LOL
746786455427514368 2016-06-25 19:25:40 UTC <laurashredder> Like, sobbed at this in bed before watching the making of & then the actual wedding dresses across Asia vids. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G2wPCbazMjQ
746785837463928832 2016-06-25 19:23:12 UTC <laurashredder> Okay, I get that it's 2:20AM, but I don't care. I might spend all night watching every @EugeneLeeYang buzzfeed video. #swoon
746688396358082560 2016-06-25 12:56:01 UTC <laurashredder> Is there actually anyone who can't believe it isn't butter?

746596534062456832 2016-06-24 06:50:59 UTC <laurashredder> Happy to announce, after much deliberation, that this has been selected as this trip's theme song http://youtu.be/IVJvCJQQUew

746590032408911872 2016-06-24 06:25:09 UTC <laurashredder> @wanpoetry stop quoting @goodghostbill & I'll stop liking every tweet. But not a moment before then.
746589822605615104 2016-06-24 06:24:19 UTC <laurashredder> Earlier, I ate ostrich and bought one last plane ticket for a beach day. I'm not entirely sure how I got this life, but I'm living it.

746574375730634752 2016-06-24 05:22:56 UTC <laurashredder> when I tell you this trip has been a running joke of how naked I feel comfortable being in front of @potockbr, please know I'm not joking
746573487708397568 2016-06-24 05:19:24 UTC <laurashredder> @DesDallagiacomo hey @goodghostbill what was the name of that BBQ joint you took us to when we were down for prom?
746573244841353216 2016-06-24 05:18:26 UTC <laurashredder> Been here two hours, already in love with Vietnam.
746537212775280640 2016-06-24 02:55:16 UTC <laurashredder> Watched Brexit results on Thai news yesterday. You could tell even that newscaster was in shock.
746536746339360768 2016-06-24 02:53:24 UTC <laurashredder> Never felt more like an adult than when I just muttered "Snapchat has been great for my relationship with my niece and nephew."
746171238658105349 2016-06-23 02:41:01 UTC <laurashredder> S/O to the 24-hr stomach bug that kept me inside/asleep for 90% of yesterday, which happened to be the rainiest day of our trip this far.

744064442397298690 2016-06-18 07:09:21 UTC <laurashredder> @CharlotteAbotsi yes, yes I did. The stickiest with sweat, years old clothes I packed with that exact purpose in mind. Any less glam? 
743982298253660160 2016-06-17 01:42:57 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I appreciate that my phone would charge faster if I turned it off, but then what of Twitter?
743981339607601152 2016-06-17 01:39:08 UTC <laurashredder> overnight flight from Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur; 1 more hr before we head to Bangkok. Feeling a lot like this rn:pic.twitter.com/3RYb0BNdW6

743388938769858560 2016-06-16 10:25:09 UTC <laurashredder> Before this song, it was some 2010 song by The Black Eyed Peas that neither of us knew, and we almost believed we weren't cool.
743388162852954112 2016-06-16 10:22:04 UTC <laurashredder> And Mya's Case of Ex just came on in the pub. @potockbr and I didn't realize how much we needed an impromptu karaoke session.
743387263652900865 2016-06-16 10:18:29 UTC <laurashredder> French for breakfast, Indian for lunch, and pub food for dinner.     Obviously, we're in Tokyo.
743385780681248768 2016-06-16 10:12:36 UTC <laurashredder> Had breakfast at a Cordon Bleu satellite campus, some of the most amazing curry I've ever had for lunch, & rocking fish n'chips for dinner.

722744194155028480 2016-04-20 11:10:18 UTC <laurashredder> Just freaked out because my nurse told me she got my favorite kind of tea for 88 cents. So, it's been that kind of morning.
722743080944803840 2016-04-20 11:05:53 UTC <laurashredder> Walked in the hospital all bright-eyed/ready for my appt & immediately remembered I was supposed to do blood work earlier in the week. Oops.

721820610503045122 2016-04-17 22:00:18 UTC <laurashredder> I gotta believe the most valuable lesson I learned at this conference is how to pee in a public toilet with a poster tube on your back

721815156129427461 2016-04-17 21:38:38 UTC <laurashredder> Married life is sometimes worry in the pit of your stomach that your spouse ate your candy while you were out of town.

720754880437227520 2016-04-14 23:25:29 UTC <laurashredder> There's only Gold Star in this airport. What's good, CVG? 
720754631408762883 2016-04-14 23:24:29 UTC <laurashredder> If you're not anticipating being picked up by the love of your life (who might be a catfish- you've never met), sweatpants are the move.
720753826219876352 2016-04-14 23:21:17 UTC <laurashredder> I love people watching in airports. Like, in what world were those heels needed on this flight? Who wants to be anything but comfortable?

720655484957638656 2016-04-14 16:50:31 UTC <laurashredder> Just unfollowed someone for a distasteful 9/11 joke & realized I've become my mom.
720654911009107968 2016-04-14 16:48:14 UTC <laurashredder> Also, how has no one invented something that makes latching a bracelet on yourself more of an attainable dream?
720654474998595584 2016-04-14 16:46:30 UTC <laurashredder> My purse isn't even that big. I feel like the Mary Poppins of discarded snacks and lip balm.

720293167531212800 2016-04-13 16:50:48 UTC <laurashredder> Does it make me a bad person if I would be willing to hear arguments for how Bellatrix was just misunderstood?
720292891839623168 2016-04-13 16:49:42 UTC <laurashredder> I would have been just as happy to tweet "I love @guarnaschelli. So tasty." But I get that that's weird.
720291147789266948 2016-04-13 16:42:46 UTC <laurashredder> @plcphd not sure which account will be more up your alley, but I'm guessing it's this one
720289574728151041 2016-04-13 16:36:31 UTC <laurashredder> Have to believe anyone who calls Kasich a moderate actually sees value in the political musings of Drumpf.
720286796773462016 2016-04-13 16:25:29 UTC <laurashredder> Also I hate being surrounded by people who use "soda" as the preferred term.
720286434884771840 2016-04-13 16:24:03 UTC <laurashredder> I've been pop-free since Jan 1, and today is my first time craving one. I blame all this birch beer beside me.pic.twitter.com/35aZmBpzki
720216855642783744 2016-04-13 11:47:34 UTC <laurashredder> U know when ur mind is like "let's get up!" & ur body is like "no! 5 more mins!" & ur mind is like " LOL i control u" & then u have to pee?
720107585555341312 2016-04-12 04:33:22 UTC <laurashredder> @RebsTay21 there's a Taking Back Sunday joke in here somewhere, but I'm just too tired  to discover it
720052783441948674 2016-04-12 00:55:36 UTC <laurashredder> I hate "deleting friends soon" FB posts. It makes no sense to me why you'd want to give losers warning about their imminent demise.
719719654202208257 2016-04-11 02:51:51 UTC <laurashredder> Not sure the last time I took Liebs out after dark & wasn't made to feel uncomfortable by a stranger on the street.
719622401533812736 2016-04-11 20:25:25 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot glad you like them!!! Love you!!!
719163223405170688 2016-04-10 14:00:48 UTC <laurashredder> Even their hash browns suck; how do you ruin fried potatoes ?????
719161861539819524 2016-04-10 13:55:23 UTC <laurashredder> When an experience at a breakfast/coffee spot makes you wish you'd gone to McDonald's something is really wrong.
719161710477774849 2016-04-10 13:54:47 UTC <laurashredder> Every time I go to Dunkin, I promise myself never again. And then I find myself desperate for coffee, surrounded by Dunkins.
719161508270358528 2016-04-10 13:53:59 UTC <laurashredder> I hate CT because I hate Dunkin, and Dunkin is my only option in this entire freaking state.
719004379408437248 2016-04-09 03:29:37 UTC <laurashredder> Caught a dude peeing outside on my way to my car from the bar. Like, I had seen him earlier in the bar. What was wrong w their bathroom?
718996823080349696 2016-04-09 02:59:35 UTC <laurashredder> @TedMDickinson the brown corduroy one
718996690779418625 2016-04-09 02:59:04 UTC <laurashredder> Can I go ahead and rule this out for them?https://twitter.com/thehill/status/718977086178914308
718934400071770113 2016-04-09 22:51:32 UTC <laurashredder> I saw a ginger gentleman in a coat I'm not even sure @TedMDickinson still owns in a Panera near my house; what an emotional roller coaster
718805528810516480 2016-04-09 14:19:27 UTC <laurashredder> Planning a vacation to Mimosa City w @lcopperpot rn. How's your morning?
718801357579382784 2016-04-09 14:02:52 UTC <laurashredder> Thanks for all the feedback y'all. It's unanimous. I totally won.
718549118436700161 2016-04-08 21:20:34 UTC <laurashredder> Settle a bet for me. Is this a monkey or a cow?pic.twitter.com/KwGKKvji8W

718129713777152001 2016-04-07 17:34:00 UTC <laurashredder> I've given up on the doctor ever joining me in here. I've tied the back of my hospital gown & now I'm laying down on the table.
718128459491487744 2016-04-07 17:29:01 UTC <laurashredder> Or like "I got here on time; how come you get to be 30 mins late!?"
718126326473957377 2016-04-07 17:20:33 UTC <laurashredder> How real is too real to be w a doc you've never met before? Like, hi nice to meet you I guess, but I'd rather we'd've never crossed paths
718124372737855489 2016-04-07 17:12:47 UTC <laurashredder> So glad I stressed over my outfit when the doc only gets to see me in this gown number anywaypic.twitter.com/Jd4sqjb7QD
718123136517074944 2016-04-07 17:07:52 UTC <laurashredder> For real though, life is too short for people to sit around in waiting rooms. Why don't doctors get that ?
718122584982708225 2016-04-07 17:05:40 UTC <laurashredder> The color choice matches the outside and my insides todaypic.twitter.com/k703pDquoX
718121850820288512 2016-04-07 17:02:45 UTC <laurashredder> I decided to go w dark grey denim & one of @NifMuhammad's sweaters; varying shades of grey, including my nailspic.twitter.com/UPrLOE7oGD
718113259946115072 2016-04-07 16:28:37 UTC <laurashredder> But seriously, what outfit most desperately says "please don't cut me open again" ??
718113084594851841 2016-04-07 16:27:55 UTC <laurashredder> As if there's a chance he might look at me & say "oh you look so nice/trendy/etc, you no longer need this appointment."
718112076451946496 2016-04-07 16:23:55 UTC <laurashredder> I've got a consult with a new doctor in 40 mins and I can't decide what to wear. My priorities are on point.
718110925954359297 2016-04-07 16:19:21 UTC <laurashredder> Not sure why I decided my phone is a woman. But I promise she's a badass warrior princess who knows me better than I know myself.
718108632815177728 2016-04-07 16:10:14 UTC <laurashredder> I love that my phone knows to autocorrect "tall" to y'all. She gets me.
717849649537806336 2016-04-06 23:01:08 UTC <laurashredder> It's been us since 2007; she's turning 9 this month. Forever my favorite pup. pic.twitter.com/n0nusovK7O
717558301706338304 2016-04-05 03:43:25 UTC <laurashredder> Today I used the phrase "frick fracking snickin snacking" and called myself a "doofus," so I'm pretty much my dad or something
717518936539996160 2016-04-05 01:06:59 UTC <laurashredder> It cracks me up when people talk about how I have so much free time, as if my job only consists of time I'm in the classroom.
717518726656962560 2016-04-05 01:06:09 UTC <laurashredder> Been on campus for 22 hours thus far this week (actively working 20ish of them). Just in case you were thinking about being a prof: LOL.
717185702748774401 2016-04-04 03:02:50 UTC <laurashredder> She's such a creeppic.twitter.com/ImzcJhkbgz

717159837151404032 2016-04-04 01:20:04 UTC <laurashredder> Basketball, Wings Over New Haven, and no filter that works for both of us. We're having a peak https://www.instagram.com/p/BDzMZncCojq/
716695270164209664 2016-04-03 18:34:02 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot yeah. So much left unexplained. But *damn* regardless, he is looking good
716639282065186820 2016-04-03 14:51:34 UTC <laurashredder> Nothing encourages a deep spring clean like Luda.
716632043011121152 2016-04-03 14:22:48 UTC <laurashredder> TMW you realize you've been cleaning your house while dancing around to loud pop music from 2001-05 & you're pretty much just your mom 2.0
716423009716842497 2016-04-02 00:32:10 UTC <laurashredder> So happy about Marnie leaving Desi. But for real didn't need Charlie to be the vehicle for that growth.
716278034916093954 2016-04-02 14:56:05 UTC <laurashredder> Nothing says "trust me with your child's education" like underrate bags from a late night conference deadline & chipped nail polish
716268474654408705 2016-04-02 14:18:06 UTC <laurashredder> P much just want to hang with Mojo Jojo.pic.twitter.com/63ELgAO1Mk
716261812816183296 2016-04-02 13:51:38 UTC <laurashredder> Whenever I get too much foam soap on my hands, I like to pretend I'm scrubbing in for surgery. This is the power of the medical drama genre.
716261577952006144 2016-04-02 13:50:42 UTC <laurashredder> Not an argument for living alone/being single, but certainly listed under the "pros" of my husband being at #AWP
716260061203546113 2016-04-02 13:44:40 UTC <laurashredder> Not fighting about where to squeeze the toothpaste tube, getting to eat whatever I want for dinner, & only cleaning up messes I've made...
716258510414168064 2016-04-02 13:38:30 UTC <laurashredder> All the OG Criminal Minds guest spots on the Beyond Borders CM doesn't make the premise of this show any less trash.
716258224517865474 2016-04-02 13:37:22 UTC <laurashredder> I appreciate that my alarm is willing to work under all circumstances, but I've been on my phone for 2 hrs. It should know I'm not asleep.
716235844546334720 2016-04-02 12:08:27 UTC <laurashredder> Just did basic math before coffee. I got an A, not unimpressed w myself this morning.  http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/can-you-make-it-to-the-end-of-this-basic-math-quiz?bftw&utm_term=.hmMbMPn0a#.skXma2L09 via @BuzzFeedUK
716230034818772993 2016-04-02 11:45:21 UTC <laurashredder> Gotta hate when you've slept so little that you've got only like 10-15 new tweets to welcome you into the new day.
716130523228274688 2016-04-01 05:09:56 UTC <laurashredder> I would totally eat an @eggo waffle RN.
716129323460206592 2016-04-01 05:05:10 UTC <laurashredder> If I eat a bowl of soup at 1 am because I just realized how hungry I am when I laid down (because I forgot to eat dinner), what meal is it?
716123801097007104 2016-04-01 04:43:13 UTC <laurashredder> @hatmadeofeagles I totally get that.
715880948156481536 2016-04-01 12:38:13 UTC <laurashredder> Yup. This made my morning. @lcopperpot @technicolorladyhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/tahliapritchard/such-a-gilderoy
715624962539839488 2016-03-31 19:41:01 UTC <laurashredder> @lcopperpot this is just the busiest week of 2016. Or maybe ever.
715576134264553473 2016-03-31 16:26:59 UTC <laurashredder> If it takes you two hours to eat your breakfast/you're still not done at 12:25, can you just say you brunched at work?
715554268539789314 2016-03-31 15:00:06 UTC <laurashredder> Today marks three whole months no pop (soda for you non-Midwestern losers). 
715550761518759938 2016-03-31 14:46:10 UTC <laurashredder> @EdPlunkett @edplunkett you sure this is an "or" situation? 
715529080519704577 2016-03-31 13:20:01 UTC <laurashredder> S/O to this radio station that just played Fat Joe, Justin Bieber, & Aaliyah in a row and made the sun come out.
715315449022517248 2016-03-30 23:11:07 UTC <laurashredder> @willevanswrites they are doing content analyses to see if there are certain article characteristics that garner more comments
715288174398824448 2016-03-30 21:22:44 UTC <laurashredder> @willevanswrites Mostly hopeful that you get a couple of return readers out of it.

715185333705441280 2016-03-30 14:34:05 UTC <laurashredder> @willevanswrites IDK. But its fixed now. Real weird morning.
715182279652278272 2016-03-30 14:21:57 UTC <laurashredder> @willevanswrites I just got locked out of BNP because it doesn't think I'm a human. LOL
714878879320530944 2016-03-29 18:16:21 UTC <laurashredder> Did @CBS actually look at @ScorpionCBS & think "this show really needs another white guy!" or is Jason Street not sticking around?
714864164699770885 2016-03-29 17:17:53 UTC <laurashredder> I love my dog.

713901475693461505 2016-03-26 01:32:30 UTC <laurashredder> So sick of the basketball, I've given up on being nice about it. Just said "okay, I'm going to go... Watch something... That isn't this."

713771443620814849 2016-03-26 16:55:48 UTC <laurashredder> Gotta love how many shows that are "intended for mature audiences" actually appeal to the most immature of audiences

713548965552238592 2016-03-25 02:11:45 UTC <laurashredder> Also, what about my face says to strangers that I'd love for them to strike up conversations with me?
713548515784462336 2016-03-25 02:09:57 UTC <laurashredder> How come I think a little bra strap showing can be sexy on other women but whenever I notice mine is showing, I'm embarrassed? Thanks, Mom.
713542385205121024 2016-03-25 01:45:36 UTC <laurashredder> Hip check me or rub ur butt up against me. Do what u gotta to avoid rubbing ur junk against my thigh. I 100% believe u can control this.
713541964336128000 2016-03-25 01:43:55 UTC <laurashredder> Yo dudes at shows: I get it; it's hard to get around in here. But, please, when you know you're going to have to rub against a stranger...

712838962344230912 2016-03-23 03:10:27 UTC <laurashredder> It's totally unfair when you ask your partner to list the pros/cons of something they want to do & they offer "it's perfect" as a pro

712836671625109504 2016-03-23 03:01:21 UTC <laurashredder> @dannibalcorpse yeah, I have no idea how that wasn't happening. I sincerely feel the loss.

710937992429330432 2016-03-18 21:16:40 UTC <laurashredder> After a week of satellite radio, I'm pretty confident the best years for music were 1993, 1999, and 2001.
710934425131991040 2016-03-18 21:02:30 UTC <laurashredder> I feel very strongly that when your shoes are on sale for $55, your shoes are too expensive
710930776108490753 2016-03-18 20:48:00 UTC <laurashredder> When you pass a vase that says "bloom," but you read it as "blood," you realize real quick you're not the intended audience.
710918494049673216 2016-03-18 19:59:11 UTC <laurashredder> I might love the song "Falls Apart" by Sugar Ray, and I'm finally okay with admitting that.

710856475762003969 2016-03-18 15:52:45 UTC <laurashredder> The Sirius XM POP2K channel would have us believe 50 Cent had way more hits than I remember by living through that decade
710855674079543296 2016-03-18 15:49:34 UTC <laurashredder> This isn't a complaint, but there are some days when I'm in Columbus where I just hop from one restaurant to the next to meet up w friends
710670516697235457 2016-03-17 03:33:49 UTC <laurashredder> Buzzfeed just told me I'm 70% millennial. So, that happened.

710538247789797377 2016-03-17 18:48:14 UTC <laurashredder> Hey Ohio, could you please let the sun shine to bring out my freckles and be the most beautiful place in the world?
710537468576190464 2016-03-17 18:45:08 UTC <laurashredder> Wondering if there is anything more me than putting off work to sit in the grass and drink steamed milk.

708721709210312704 2016-03-12 18:29:57 UTC <laurashredder> Today I put on my eyeliner and mascara in a moving car, so I'm pretty sure I can do anything.
708715671144812544 2016-03-12 18:05:57 UTC <laurashredder> Just passed a dude smoking meat outta the back of his truck on the side of the highway. I point it out & Hanif says "my kind of people"   ?

707702112269045761 2016-03-09 22:58:26 UTC <laurashredder> I just threw away an old bra with a wonky underwire that doesn't fit right anymore after fighting it all day & now I feel invincible.
706521224311119872 2016-03-06 16:46:01 UTC <laurashredder> #FullerHouse is a mess, and I love it. Totally didn't tear up at the at the Flintstones song flashback or anything.

705008883593580545 2016-03-02 12:36:30 UTC <laurashredder> I just keep replaying all the white dude Bernie supporters who've called into NPR to explain their "I'll vote for Trump over Clinton" logic
705008596195659776 2016-03-02 12:35:22 UTC <laurashredder> Like, I wanna believe Rubio when he says that a vote for Trump (Drumpf!) now is a vote for Clinton in November, but...

704807451141545985 2016-03-01 23:16:05 UTC <laurashredder> But just now, I was thinking about how dark it was & then I noticed the time & thought to myself "whoa, how is it only 6:15?!" (2/2)
704807133406220290 2016-03-01 23:14:49 UTC <laurashredder> about ten minutes ago, I thought to myself "whoa. It's dark out. Where did the day go!?" (1/2)
