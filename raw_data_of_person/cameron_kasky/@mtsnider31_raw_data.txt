962548376733708289 2018-02-10 04:46:30 UTC <mtsnider31> @SchellRegan Thank you bb
962341699442872326 2018-02-10 15:05:15 UTC <mtsnider31> @Anthony_AFlores thank you, I appreciate that.
962305566004666368 2018-02-10 12:41:40 UTC <mtsnider31> Feeling like this is like trying and failing to hold a pile of plates and then dropping and breaking them all at once, and having to walk across the pieces in your bare feet.
962305564889047040 2018-02-10 12:41:40 UTC <mtsnider31> And when I realize all this, like now, I get so depressed that I miss days of medication at a time, stop eating or sleeping, and start falling behind in everything I need to do.
962305563593003010 2018-02-10 12:41:39 UTC <mtsnider31> I will only get worse. I will only get more pain the longer I push on. I will get more diseases from the existing ones, and I will have to increase the doctors and specialists that already cost too much money to see.
962305562020073472 2018-02-10 12:41:39 UTC <mtsnider31> There will be no kids, I'm most likely infertile and even if I was my body is too weak to handle pregnancy and childbirth. Even if I did change my mind about wanting them, the option is already taken from me.
962305560891805697 2018-02-10 12:41:39 UTC <mtsnider31> If I even finish my degree, best case scenario, I'll be $50,000 in debt. What happens when I'm on the street because I'm too sick to work a normal day job? That's assuming I can even get a job in the first place.
962305559453159424 2018-02-10 12:41:38 UTC <mtsnider31> I can't even use my cane as much as I need it bc of the anxiety it causes. I can feel the stares, of people wondering what's wrong with me. It's nerve wracking to be scruntinized. It even brings harrassment. The anxiety outweighs the pain that *might* get avoided.
962305558320766977 2018-02-10 12:41:38 UTC <mtsnider31> my friends and family feel bad for me, but we all know there's nothing they can do to help. They won't ever to be able to understand what I feel like, and being reminded of how fragile I really am makes people uncomfortable.
962305556961742848 2018-02-10 12:41:38 UTC <mtsnider31> Every time I get feelings for someone, I just feel guilty, as if I'm not allowed to feel that way or hope for that because of the hurt I could cause.
962305555875467264 2018-02-10 12:41:37 UTC <mtsnider31> If I fall in love, how could I ever put someone that I love through the things I deal with every day? To see how ugly and unattractive and weak I am, and trying to healthily function as a couple on top of it?
962305554176774144 2018-02-10 12:41:37 UTC <mtsnider31> How can I even think of selfishly entering a relationship when I know that I will be a financial nightmare and a burden for the rest of my life until I most likely die an early death, leaving someone behind to grieve?
962305552998166534 2018-02-10 12:41:37 UTC <mtsnider31> I probably won't spend the rest of my life with someone, bc my chronic illness will always be there hanging over my head, complicating things, always hurting, and making me and being with me unattractive.
962305551706284033 2018-02-10 12:41:36 UTC <mtsnider31> I can never be a makeup artist- I can't stand/work for long periods of time. I can't travel to other countries and places and try new things- I can barely walk a mile to class and I am allergic to most foods.
962305550200590336 2018-02-10 12:41:36 UTC <mtsnider31> being shoved face first into the realization that everything I ever wanted or dreamed of won't happen, feels like missing a step on a staircase and falling all the way to the bottom.
962305548526981122 2018-02-10 12:41:36 UTC <mtsnider31> I put 14 pain patches around my hips and back just so i have a chance at sleeping. Idk if that's even healthy. I don't eat or sleep regularly enough bc i cant bring myself to care about the tiny amount that it will improve bc it'll be drowned out by everything else.
962305546069082112 2018-02-10 12:41:35 UTC <mtsnider31> I felt like i got hit in the stomach like... this is my life and I'm only going to get worse as i get older... i'm already in so much pain everyday and i feel like I'm drowning in doctors and responsibilties already and I'm still not keeping up with everything
962305544575995904 2018-02-10 12:41:35 UTC <mtsnider31> I started to clean up a bit and get ready for bed and realized just how hard it was and how much i hurt and then it just hit me- that i am never going to feel better and i am always going to feel this physically sick and weak for the rest of my life
