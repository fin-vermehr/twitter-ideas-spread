854760930038697985 2017-04-19 18:17:41 UTC <u1ahbme> In TX? Please take min to call Gov Abbott at 512-463-2000 and tell him you oppose #HB2899. The "alternative" to SB 6 is worse for LGBTQ
854707157249523713 2017-04-19 14:44:00 UTC <u1ahbme> Note to those taking action at the TX capital blding. Stay away from the "ground" floor. It's a land of deceit & trickery. You will get lost
854698508410122240 2017-04-19 14:09:38 UTC <u1ahbme> @JohnCornyn No meeting w/ constituents in Austin. When are you going to let us discuss our concerns w/ you? What was w/ the exclusive phone town hall?
854442288403144704 2017-04-18 21:11:30 UTC <u1ahbme> @GregAbbott_TX LGBTQ suicide rate are much higher than their straight/cis peers. Hearing you disparage them adds to the problem. Where is your empathy?!
854441366901985280 2017-04-18 21:07:51 UTC <u1ahbme> @GregAbbott_TX Quit using victims of violence by straight cisgender males and your "religion" to push you prejudice ideals. Different from you is not wrong
854440599814057985 2017-04-18 21:04:48 UTC <u1ahbme> @GregAbbott_TX Your actions are repulsive. The purpose of SB2899 is to stop or remove manciple protections of LGBTQ. SB 6 is about prejudice not privacy
854329343262289921 2017-04-18 13:42:42 UTC <u1ahbme> @JohnCornyn This sounds like the perfect opportunity to discuss your plans get the president's tax returns released. Congress has the ability to do so
