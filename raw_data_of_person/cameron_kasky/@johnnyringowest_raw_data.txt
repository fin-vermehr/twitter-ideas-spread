963619663560179712 2018-02-13 03:43:25 UTC <johnnyringowest> Just finished watching #QueerEye and I'm not sure how I'm gonna make it through the rest of my week without my daily dose of @jvn fabulousness.

958177642322317313 2018-01-29 03:18:46 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist No spoilers, but I think you'll like the ending.
958172088388464641 2018-01-29 02:56:42 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist Darkest Hour is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I was kinda disappointed it was only 2 hours. #imnotanerdiswear #historynerd

938223090391240705 2017-12-05 01:46:30 UTC <johnnyringowest> @lanakath I kinda don't believe you...
938222744436690945 2017-12-05 01:45:08 UTC <johnnyringowest> @lanakath Have you even started the homework?
938150891722625024 2017-12-05 20:59:37 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist I was at Wash!
938105707001413632 2017-12-05 18:00:04 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist I stopped by to see you but you weren't there.

923729709329993728 2017-10-26 01:54:59 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist It's a really fun class!  The teacher is great,  though obviously not as great as you! (I mean come on "Diet of Worms"? Really?)
923727293134049280 2017-10-26 01:45:23 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist I might have accidentally signed up for euro again even though I already had credit for it
923645769193873408 2017-10-26 20:21:26 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist I know... It hurts doesn't it?
923626418587815936 2017-10-26 19:04:32 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist my new history teacher says Diet of Worms the way it's spelled...

774777362822995968 2016-09-10 01:11:32 UTC <johnnyringowest> @johnnyringowest im a terrible person
774777215904911360 2016-09-10 01:10:57 UTC <johnnyringowest> @johnnyringowest I mumbled under my breath to my grandma "that's fine, we can have him cremated."
774776522989113344 2016-09-10 01:08:12 UTC <johnnyringowest> @johnnyringowest he just said "but I don't wanna go in the ground"
774775903524052992 2016-09-10 01:05:44 UTC <johnnyringowest> My cousin, who's 4, just found out that everybody dies, and now he's crying. Ah yes his first existential crisis.
774774522180280320 2016-09-10 01:00:15 UTC <johnnyringowest> @lanakath remember when those dogs died

770073178513309696 2016-08-28 01:38:47 UTC <johnnyringowest> @lanakath wow! I was still slightly convinced you were bluffing 
768910272773828608 2016-08-25 20:37:49 UTC <johnnyringowest> Part of me really wants to try for the @DaltonRapattoni meet and greet in Chicago, but at the same time I'm super shy and awkward.

756237177453965312 2016-07-21 21:19:27 UTC <johnnyringowest> @lanakath why didn't you come to my house? I thought that was the plan anyway? I have your bday stuff.
754365910937432064 2016-07-16 17:23:43 UTC <johnnyringowest> Im finally feeling good enough to be out and about. AND POKEMON GO WONT WORK!!! 
750729378082861056 2016-07-06 16:33:26 UTC <johnnyringowest> @ScherrmanAPHist I GOT A 4 ON THE APUSH TEST!!! 
750178916686401537 2016-07-04 04:06:06 UTC <johnnyringowest> It's 11 pm. WHY ARE THERE STILL FIREWORKS?! AMERICA ISN'T THAT GREAT
750178681109094400 2016-07-04 04:05:09 UTC <johnnyringowest> The other 1/4 is someone else saying something, and me responding with an appropriate Labyrinth quote in my head.
750178431468384260 2016-07-04 04:04:10 UTC <johnnyringowest> Honestly 3/4 of my life is me saying something, and then responding with an appropriate Labyrinth quote in my head.
750178035073032192 2016-07-04 04:02:35 UTC <johnnyringowest> IT'S NOT FAIR! (You say that so often. I wonder what your basis for comparison is.)
750177828998553600 2016-07-04 04:01:46 UTC <johnnyringowest> THEY'RE COMING FROM THE COUNTRY CLUB NOW
750177739966074880 2016-07-04 04:01:25 UTC <johnnyringowest> THE DOWNTOWN FIREWORKS STOPPED
750176464062918663 2016-07-04 03:56:21 UTC <johnnyringowest> SIR DIDYMUS ASKING IF ANYONE WANTS TO PLAY SCRABBLE...that is all.
750176313843986433 2016-07-04 03:55:45 UTC <johnnyringowest> Tell him you'll stay if Toby gets sent home. Best of both worlds. He's safe, and you're happy.
750176083010433024 2016-07-04 03:54:50 UTC <johnnyringowest> I know he took your brother and all but for someone who thinks she's super smart, you'd think she would get that there's more than one way.
750175714649907200 2016-07-04 03:53:22 UTC <johnnyringowest> I love the escapism of Labyrinth, and at the beginning she's obsessed with it as well. Two hours later and she suddenly hates it.
750175380841963520 2016-07-04 03:52:03 UTC <johnnyringowest> Homestly, I really don't like Sarah. And not just cause she crushed my favorite fictional character.
750175195940286464 2016-07-04 03:51:18 UTC <johnnyringowest> He has magic, and we haven't seen and humans with magic. Odds are that he has some sort of immortality, or longer life span.
750174719123427332 2016-07-04 03:49:25 UTC <johnnyringowest> Cause Jareth clearly isn't human
750174637548462080 2016-07-04 03:49:05 UTC <johnnyringowest> I feel like in a world where there's goblins and such, and you're one of two humans and the other is your brother that age isn't a big deal.
750174271389900800 2016-07-04 03:47:38 UTC <johnnyringowest> Are you even paying attention Sarah?! Like yeah he's a fair bit older than you.
750173719050366977 2016-07-04 03:45:26 UTC <johnnyringowest> WTF ARE YOU DOING SARAH
750173625404108800 2016-07-04 03:45:04 UTC <johnnyringowest> HES SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN
750173578398568448 2016-07-04 03:44:53 UTC <johnnyringowest> THE WHITE OUTFIT AT THEE END ALWAYS MAKEES ME WANT TO CRY. ITS SO DRAMATICALLY OVER THE TOP
750173454939222016 2016-07-04 03:44:23 UTC <johnnyringowest> I feel like we should consider that maybe Toby kind of likes Jareth. I mean it's David Bowie. Who doesn't like David Bowie
750173153477816320 2016-07-04 03:43:11 UTC <johnnyringowest> also can we just take a second to appreciate that the ballroom scene is done to look like it's in his throne room
750172958547517441 2016-07-04 03:42:25 UTC <johnnyringowest> I adore the blue from the ballroom scene but the red kills me
750172860077842432 2016-07-04 03:42:02 UTC <johnnyringowest> honestly the red outfit is my favorite
750172676191186944 2016-07-04 03:41:18 UTC <johnnyringowest> *passes two hallways, likely holding many doors* thats the only way he could have gone
