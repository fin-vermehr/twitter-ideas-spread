972143253167460352 2018-03-09 16:13:07 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GeriBAnderson Time will tell. Seems like SoS should be going first to set the stage and have those talks. This could just be a photo op and a bragging session for Kim and Trump.

972109292936617984 2018-03-09 13:58:11 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I hope Im wrong. This could be a way for NK to evaluate Trump weakness and personality. It could be a way to encourage the US to lower its guard around the Korean Penn. Or...it could be a way for Kim to get Stormys contact info. The hook is in @GOP mouth. Watch out! 2/2
972107973534371843 2018-03-09 13:52:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Im sorry but this Trump - NK meeting will mean nothing for US citizens. IMO. It does nothing for healthcare, infrastructure, poverty, jobs, trade, immigration, or the opioid crisis. It will be a photo op and a means for @realDonaldTrump and @GOP to deflect from real issues.  1/2
971846311287951361 2018-03-08 20:33:11 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Lets see.... @GOP and Evangelicals! Here is your leader for family values and a man who says the Bible is his favorite book.  #Stormy is not an isolated affair.

971822272263618562 2018-03-08 18:57:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @thehill Abstinence underTrump? No way. Abstinence on Trump? No way. The only way abstinence has become more common is if people have that photo in their bedrooms. It symbolizes the risk of STDs  IMO, of course.
971745642577047553 2018-03-08 13:53:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Dont ever forget - the fact that #Stormy is being threatened with penalties from @MichaelCohen212 if she provides details regarding an affair with @realDonaldTrump implies the affair took place. Innocent people do not behave like this. Are there others @MichaelCohen212?
971738620649500672 2018-03-08 13:25:15 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump @SafetyPinDaily @maccalled That is so true. Wonder who is next to be revealed?

971509430469693440 2018-03-07 22:14:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @719_82 @ravensspirit68 Not true! Im a physician. Most states have opioid (and other categories) monitoring programs which limit and define the quantities patients can get. Also, most insurance companies have quantity limits imposed at the pharmacy.

There are some great restaurants and hotel dining rooms in DC that surely would be better. And, since when does God tell someone how to pick out furniture?

968860091180109824 2018-02-28 14:47:00 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I hate the term white lie. That implies there is a blue or red lie. A liar is not subject to gradation. What she is saying is that she and @realDonaldTrump are liars. Again...she is confirming @POTUS is a liar.

968858220658921472 2018-02-28 14:39:34 UTC <BlueAshMaester> No. Abortion has been going on for centuries and many women died due to unsafe practice. Ive treated victims of illegal abortions. If you think abortion started in US when Roe v Wade was passed, you are very ignorant! Better do some research before making such stupid comments.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/968690735112433665
968855707641577472 2018-02-28 14:29:35 UTC <BlueAshMaester> No... the next generation that got a spark from @Emma4Change is speaking out to shape THEIR future rather than have yours forced on them.

968285623424516097 2018-02-26 00:44:17 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @FedEx @UPS @BernadetteNoBot @GWillie1968 Ok...blame the dog. Mine do the same thing. They stole pizza one night. The older one knocked the box off the counter and off they went. What a mess
968283704631193600 2018-02-26 00:36:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @FedEx @UPS @BernadetteNoBot @GWillie1968 Shame!  Lemon cake? I thought mine were spoiled. They get cupcakes for their birthdays
968267824346140673 2018-02-26 23:33:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BernadetteNoBot Same issues here! Had a @FedEx package left in the driveway, in the rain, even though we have a covered front porch. Christmas gift ruined. Fortunately company refunded $$ for product and shipping.
968267071036559360 2018-02-26 23:30:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @FedEx @UPS @BernadetteNoBot @GWillie1968 Its not barking...its talking. Dogs are people too
968264200555347968 2018-02-26 23:19:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BernadetteNoBot Oh, no. Sorry to hear. Our @UPS driver chases my dogs and then they chase him. Just like Dances with Wolves. They know the brown truck and go to the driveway to meet him. @FedEx many times WILL NOT DELIVER to my house if my dogs are in the yard. So...my decision is easy.
968258728305856512 2018-02-26 22:57:24 UTC <BlueAshMaester> My dogs like the @UPS drivers better than the @FedEx folks. I guess they have been right all along. And I trust my huskies. #NeverAgainhttps://twitter.com/wildonnelly/status/968246421626458112

968247806791217153 2018-02-26 22:14:00 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lgbtqnation Hey @Delta! Given this bill and the threat from the Lt Gov today, are you sure Georgia is the place you want to do business?  We would love for you to come back to CVG.
968244377041678338 2018-02-26 22:00:23 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kathyinMN Yep. There is no bottom
968243380223463424 2018-02-26 21:56:25 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This is so inappropriate!  I hope the family and hospital gave permission to use this photo otherwise this is a HIPPA violation. Asking for donations with a #FloridaShooting victim photo? Unbelievable. We have reached another low.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/967902293537513473

968238374493532160 2018-02-26 21:36:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Im not sure what you are proposing is legal! Threatening @Delta in Georgia? Great move.  They arent threatening anyone!  But.....you are!  They are just removing discounts for @NRA members. #NeverAgainhttps://twitter.com/caseycagle/status/968199605803454465

967760729481842688 2018-02-25 13:58:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @DLoesch @NRA @DanaGucciardo Thanks
967760556194181120 2018-02-25 13:57:51 UTC <BlueAshMaester> And...just to add. Im betting these companies were looking for a reason to stop doing business with @NRA. @DLoesch and #WayneLaPierre lit the fuse by insulting the #floridahighschoolshooting victims which helped create the #BoycottNRA movement.
967754742935048192 2018-02-25 13:34:45 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This is not about discounts. This is about @NRA buying politicians and forcing their agenda on the majority of Americans. Im a gun owner and support 2A. My outrage is due to @DLoesch and #WayneLaPierre rhetoric and vile comments over past few days. Enough! #NeverAgainhttps://twitter.com/nra/status/967556725283966977

967425552222244864 2018-02-24 15:46:40 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I need a break from Twitter so I will leave with this thought.   When the 60s generation unites with the #FloridaShooting generation and people (R or D) who care about the future of this country, nothing is impossible. It is time for new ideas across this nation. #neveragain

967155941220192259 2018-02-23 21:55:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lgbtqnation This is just disturbing. More nonsense based on faith and religious beliefs of the agencies. In other words....discrimination. There is absolutely no reason (as long as qualifications are met) that #LGBT couples should be denied the right to adopt.

967032925874196480 2018-02-23 13:46:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Ok...inquiring minds want to know. Are @DLoesch and @JackKingston related?? They talk the same. They behave the same. They are rude to others on TV. And...they both have the same tone when they spew their nonsense. Asking for a friend.
967030879699816449 2018-02-23 13:38:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Please....@CNN. Do not give @DLoesch the airtime to spew her nonsense. Thanks for calling her out. Sympathy on one day and then vile media bashing the next. Please cut her off.
967028218271289344 2018-02-23 13:27:48 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MidgetMoma Yep. Check my feed. I responded to that too. Thanks

966826983442264071 2018-02-22 00:08:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @starberry25 Shame on me!! Just couldnt resist. Grandpa probably wants to now feed me to that thing under the stairs
966826202316136448 2018-02-22 00:05:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Tweet of the day!!  Just to add - I had an Algebra teacher that fell asleep sitting at his desk while we were taking a test. He fell off his chair and hit his head on the desk edge. He then passed out due to the blood from his scalp wound. Yep...he needed a gun.https://twitter.com/meghanfeggan/status/966547203924914176
966821693552513024 2018-02-22 23:47:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @MikeFreethinker Absolutely a full time job. I try to make sure everything I Tweet is accurate. Please let me know if there is something that isnt.
966820908718489600 2018-02-22 23:44:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @MikeFreethinker I do the same. Great minds....

966820367531741184 2018-02-22 23:41:52 UTC <BlueAshMaester> That might have been the case in 2008 and probably is the same today. But now an entire nation of teenagers feels that way about you and @NRA. Sorry to be you....just go to @McDonalds for a sandwich and you will feel better. #WeCallBS #FloridaShootinghttps://twitter.com/dloesch/status/822574863

966818651633528832 2018-02-22 23:35:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @MikeFreethinker Oh...wow. Thanks. Was not aware of this.
966815689729368066 2018-02-22 23:23:17 UTC <BlueAshMaester> More family values in action. The @GOP hypocrisy knows no bounds. #MeToohttp://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/375163-missouri-governor-indicted-on-privacy-charge
966801564185907200 2018-02-22 22:27:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Per The Blaze and Wikipedia regarding @DLoesch:   Loesch and her husband homeschooled two children together.   This should give us all a glimpse as to her opinion of public schools and public school students. #WeCallBS @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews I guess her kids had an armed teacher.
966799532154589184 2018-02-22 22:19:05 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @CNN @Delta @AnnCoulter @McDonalds @costlylovewins @veve4heart Im betting if they know in the future, there will be some spit in that sandwich. Oh.....that never happens....

966796299390672899 2018-02-22 22:06:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Think about this. Teachers can no longer deduct $250 from their taxes for supplies that they buy for their students. @realDonaldTrump is proposing to give them a bonus if they carry a firearm in school. Yes...you really cant make this up.
966791203424538624 2018-02-22 21:45:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MarisaWard57 thanks for the follow
966785189971218434 2018-02-22 21:22:05 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ananavarro @maddie142519 Ive really never seen much of him either. Just his nonsense on Twitter too.
966784704727875584 2018-02-22 21:20:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Thats it....bash @McDonalds on Twitter. Total class. Why dont you call @AnnCoulter. She loves bashing @Delta. Most of their employees are high school students working at their first job. You know....like the ones you lied to last night on @CNN? #WeCallBShttps://twitter.com/dloesch/status/942551011

966783415541555200 2018-02-22 21:15:02 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ananavarro @maddie142519 I never saw her until last night but my initial thought was that she was a very opinionated explosive person.
966781192920944641 2018-02-22 21:06:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Im a gun owner. I support the 2A. Here is one of the reasons I do not belong to @NRA. This is just disturbing. She had the nerve to be on @CNN town hall last night and face those kids and then spews this nonsense. #WeCallBShttps://twitter.com/cnn/status/966707132832903168

966727313672065025 2018-02-22 17:32:07 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Per @NRA - the right to protect yourself (with a gun) is granted by God. So...God can grant this right for America but not Canada or England or Australia??  Really?? Sorry....I dont think God has anything to do with the gun debate. 17 are dead...this time. And God is ok?
966688211610357760 2018-02-22 14:56:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Very sad situation when @POTUS has to have a cheat sheet that says I hear you as a talking point. That statement should come from the heart, not a note card. Wonder what 2, 3, and 4 were? And...whats with that 45 on the cuff?? We should all be embarrassed. #WeCallBS #floridahttps://twitter.com/kthomasdc/status/966445438407794688
966686012465442816 2018-02-22 14:48:00 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @democrats @realDonaldTrump #floridahighschoolshooting #WeCallBS This issue has nothing to do with great people who work hard @NRA. 17 people are dead due to a mentally ill child with an assault rifle. That is the issue...@GOP and @Democrats need to act, not talk.

966682804028432385 2018-02-22 14:35:15 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @bkat5150 I know but I always ask.
966682700894625792 2018-02-22 14:34:50 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @goodie7415 As you know, there is virtually no security for something like this in most hospitals, gyms, nursing homes, offices, etc. Just not a sound idea to arm teachers IMO
966680890066853888 2018-02-22 14:27:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I surely give @marcorubio credit for the courage to attend the @CNN town hall last night. However it reminded me of the student who comes to take a test who hasnt studied. They both fail. #WeCallBS #FloridaSchoolShooting
966675300670111748 2018-02-22 14:05:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> With this rationale then, they would pick a different soft target.....like a hospital. Will we then arm nurses and doctors? So...problem is NOT solved. It takes a special person to be able to act rationally when a gun is pointed at them. Please define talented?https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/966660169194229761

966441571255189504 2018-02-21 22:36:40 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @NRA @democrats @GOP @CNN @Annamaegreen13 I agree. Its about $$ and donors. Very few politicians care about the people that elected them.
966434448144326656 2018-02-21 22:08:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @democrats @CNN @Annamaegreen13 He does make a great point. Im a gun owner but do not belong to @NRA due to their lobbying and politics.  It seems like @GOP folks seem to be afraid to cross them. Hopefully some will. These kids are motivated and outspoken.
966428977933045762 2018-02-21 21:46:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @democrats A father of one of the victims of the #FloridaShooting just made a great point on @CNN. He said and I am paraphrasing - I cant get on a plane with a bottle of water but a teen in Florida can buy a weapon of mass murder. Wow....how true. Are you listening @GOP and @Democrats?

965727126984056834 2018-02-19 23:17:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lynchem1 I have no words. This is from his web page:  MICHAEL KRATSIOS  I advise the President on technology policy.  Previously, I worked at Thiel Capital in San Francisco.  I have a passion for technology, politics, Greece, and travel.  I occasionally take photos.

965379092932677632 2018-02-18 00:14:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump says he is not playing golf to honor the victims of the #floridahighschoolshooting. @SpeakerRyan is fund raising in Florida without meeting with families. @FLGovScott to be @NRA speaker. Seriously??  My thoughts and prayers are with them when #BlueWave2018 hits
965377706857701376 2018-02-18 00:09:15 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @democrats I have so much respect for these kids. They speak with passion from the heart with no scripts or talking points.

965298791992709120 2018-02-18 18:55:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GWillie1968 @JenMax57 Not insulting and sorry to assume you were a male. I know the person who went to the funeral. I will look at your references to educate myself.
965294157521670145 2018-02-18 18:37:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @bob42156 9/22/17 from @realDonaldTrump on Twitter:  The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  #WeCallBS
965292606396739585 2018-02-18 18:31:06 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Today.... @realDonaldTrump blames the FBI for not preventing the Florida shooting and blames @BarackObama and @TheDemocrats for failing to stop Russian meddling in the election (which used to be a hoax, I might add). #WeCallBS @GOP owns it. #BlueWave2018
965291245177360384 2018-02-18 18:25:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JenMax57 @GWillie1968 I understand. People can believe and say what they want. I will however, as you have probably seen, called out folks for things that I know are untrue or just plain stupid.
965290513246179328 2018-02-18 18:22:47 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JenMax57 @GWillie1968 Ok. I have heard some of that too. Pretty sick however to fake dead children. Besides, there are many kids on Twitter who were witnesses.
965289723743830017 2018-02-18 18:19:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JenMax57 @GWillie1968 Ok.....I respect everyones opinion and I guess that is his. I know someone in Florida who went to a funeral for one of the victims.
965288797834498049 2018-02-18 18:15:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GWillie1968 @JenMax57 Wait! Are you saying there was no shooting and no children got killed? What am I missing??

965235830334918657 2018-02-18 14:45:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump @GWillie1968 Im no investigator but these are not normal.
965227471510671360 2018-02-18 14:12:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Please read all the Tweets from @realDonaldTrump over the past 24 hours. Is this a leader? Blaming FBI for shooting. Walking back previous Russia Tweets. Attacks on the media. There is panic between the lines. Could be an interesting week.
964990849942740993 2018-02-17 22:32:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I am ashamed of any clinical person who would stand there and smile in these photos! You are being used only for a photo op, nothing more. Personally, I would have said no. 17 children are dead. There should be no smiles.https://twitter.com/1jedi_rey/status/964907000860520448
964985930271657984 2018-02-17 22:12:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MikeFreethinker Yep. The other photo was taken around one of the victims in a hospital room. @realDonaldTrump now has the photo I posted as his Twitter header.
964985462665379840 2018-02-17 22:10:37 UTC <BlueAshMaester> To quote a very famous SNL line ...... Never mind.  That right. He was the one in the MOVIE who stole the Declaration of Independence. Now I remember.https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/964692491109912576

964981910442258434 2018-02-17 21:56:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MikeFreethinker Hypocrisy knows no bounds
964978347037134848 2018-02-17 21:42:21 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This photo is  disturbing. 17 kids are dead. A community terrorized. Childrens lives changed forever. This is not a time for smiles. This is definitely not a thumbs up occasion. Shame on everyone in this picture especially @realDonaldTrump. School shootings are NOT PHOTO OPS!pic.twitter.com/ZQDC7GJKzF
964968778856624128 2018-02-17 21:04:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I am glad to see that the 2 largest groups that the @GOP needs to fear are women and kids in school. I love seeing these kids speak out in Florida. Most of them are giving speeches from their heart and soul rather than reading script on a TelePrompTer.
964967682511695873 2018-02-17 20:59:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @krassenstein I saw @FoxNews this morning in the airport. They were blaming @BarackObama.

964966921845329920 2018-02-17 20:56:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> If @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS are now traveling separately are we, the taxpayers, paying for duplicate travel? @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @senrobportman @RepBradWenstrup @RepSteveChabot
964964781139611648 2018-02-17 20:48:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JoJoStone4 Yep. Shes pretty cold
964962820055068673 2018-02-17 20:40:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JoJoStone4 I know. My mom had dementia. A daily struggle. Not something to be made fun of.
964885023550734337 2018-02-17 15:31:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JoJoStone4 She can surely cause controversy in her own unique smug way!  But to make fun of Alzheimers patients...I had to speak out.
964876116619079680 2018-02-17 14:56:07 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Sitting in the @Delta SkyClub and @FoxNews is on TV. Cant hear but the CC is saying that @BarackObama in the summer of 2016 basically told the Russians to hack the 2016 election. Im now #4 in line at bar.
964873440502140929 2018-02-17 14:45:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BassProShops @BarackObama @GeriBAnderson Not @Delta fault. The stuff on TV is at request of the passengers there. There are 5 people watching so I guess they requested. The commercial was pretty cool for the fishing gear then back to @FoxNews stuff. I have a Bloody Mary - its all good.
964821074365075456 2018-02-17 11:17:24 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @nays_place Very sorry to hear
964624667079331851 2018-02-16 22:16:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Not funny!! This disease affects so many patients and their families and presently there is no cure.

964619813707567104 2018-02-16 21:57:40 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger Oh. Ok
964619731725705221 2018-02-16 21:57:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger No wonder so many casualties
964601134861209600 2018-02-16 20:43:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger Yep. I understand your argument but I still think that ordinarily citizens should not have access to a gun designed for military use. Thats my opinion. I am a gun owner and support 2A but I just dont understand why one needs an AR 25. Great discussion
964600656635064320 2018-02-16 20:41:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger That is very true. There is no way that citizens could go to war with the government if the military was on the government side.
964600287032995840 2018-02-16 20:40:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger They have tyranny though dont they??
964600090806636566 2018-02-16 20:39:17 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger With you so far
964600002856267777 2018-02-16 20:38:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger Yep. Very true
964599896102834177 2018-02-16 20:38:31 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger Yep. I think they probably felt that way.
964599691638984704 2018-02-16 20:37:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger That is true and they also needed firearms to hunt for food. There were no grocery stores like today so guns were necessary for survival.
964558869296017408 2018-02-16 17:55:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @thehill @dahlia201 Dont understand

964551483646775296 2018-02-16 17:26:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Some of the bravest people.. are dead. 17 kids including a student who held a door open so others could escape and teachers who gave their lives to protect children are gone.

964522950849425409 2018-02-16 15:32:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Entengummitiger No. I just dont understand what you are saying. Sorry.
964505686976720896 2018-02-16 14:24:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @FoxNews @MSNBC @CNN @Plantflowes @NRA dues are $35/year or $1000/lifetime. So....mostly likely not from memberships
964503016626970625 2018-02-16 14:13:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Plantflowes I have asked that very question. $$$ from gun manufacturers?? Donations? $$$ from other countries?? @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews any ideas?
964491180393336837 2018-02-16 13:26:31 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MatthewCronin9 @marcorubio Are you saying that you blame the police??  Am I reading this incorrectly?
964484615560990720 2018-02-16 13:00:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Sadly they have had a lot of practice. They probably have a Power Point presentation already where all they need to do is tweak the name of the state and community.

964482253689704453 2018-02-16 12:51:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I am so glad to see the students in Florida as well as their families speaking out against all the politics with this shooting and the debates regarding gun control and mental health. They are the voice of reason in this madness. #floridahighschoolshooting

964192432203227136 2018-02-15 17:39:24 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lynnfinn7 @Dedpull_Diva I have not been to a gun show in a long time so I really cant relate.
964168107404165120 2018-02-15 16:02:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lynnfinn7 @Dedpull_Diva The problem does not seem to be gun owners like us. The issue seems to be the ease at which folks like this shooter can purchase a weapon that really is meant for the military. Why does any ordinary citizen need a gun that can fire 45 rounds per minute?
964162539847372801 2018-02-15 15:40:37 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Samurai336 Sorry. I will not be baited into a political discussion on this. My point is simply that weapons have changed since the Amendment was written.

963975744891293696 2018-02-14 03:18:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Todays shooting in Florida would not have been prevented by:  A wall A travel ban A military parade An immigration policy  Millions of taxpayer $$ will be spent on these and will not result in increased safety for our children.

963959676743364611 2018-02-14 02:14:31 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Rifle in 1791 when 2nd Amendment was adopted - 1 shot AR 15 in 2018 - up to 45 shots per minute   I am a gun owner but I do not believe our Founding Fathers passed this Amendment thinking that students in schools would be targeted.pic.twitter.com/3YM9bB7tDM
963944118694109184 2018-02-14 01:12:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @CNN is currently showing a very disturbing video from inside the Florida High School during the shooting. This is a high school in America where our kids are supposed to be safe. Politicians talk but do nothing. @NRA continues to donate. 17 dead....

962085714593763328 2018-02-09 22:08:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @SpeakerRyan and @SenMajLdr! No comments on #RobPorter?  No statements on domestic abuse and violence?  Does @GOP condone this behavior? Is there a hush fund for this too??
962080752434327552 2018-02-09 21:48:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JoyAnnReid He worked for @senrobportman too. I asked what he knew....silence as always.

962076127668957184 2018-02-09 21:29:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @POTUS @GOP @RoyMooreSenate @NBCNews @LHerfendal Thats the million $$ question. To my knowledge this would not happen in any other business.
962033005165342720 2018-02-09 18:38:36 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @NBCNews Sound familiar?? Very similar verbiage that was used during the @RoyMooreSenate fiasco. @GOP is very good with their talking points. Very disturbing that he does not even mention the victims.

962028713515802624 2018-02-09 18:21:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @lisatozzi Tough on him??  What about his victims?  Heres one of their photos. How do you think she felt?pic.twitter.com/cY6iYPQUop

962026570612264965 2018-02-09 18:13:02 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @CNN @realDonaldTrump @Katkentfl Absolutely none. And for the @WhiteHouse to cover this up and wish him well is beyond contempt.
962025134239506432 2018-02-09 18:07:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @realDonaldTrump. #RobPorter is not the victim and he will never have a great career. He is a domestic abuser!!  Here is a photo of one of his victims. Why no mention of her??  @CNN #MeToo #domesticviolencepic.twitter.com/Rzdj8InP6C

961748231016402944 2018-02-08 23:47:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Great idea but maybe they should investigate sexual abuse within the Federal Government first.

960897595781545984 2018-02-06 15:26:54 UTC <BlueAshMaester> She will be the first one to complain that she had to wait in an ER or not be able to see her doctor when she gets sick. My advice to her - go to church when you get the flu. Dont forget to take a Kleenex or 2. Good luck.https://twitter.com/aynrandpaulryan/status/960850065756573697
960896520773042177 2018-02-06 15:22:37 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @KellyannePolls @GOP @lisslis12 Yes. And this issue affects so many people, families, and communities. The issue is much bigger than # deaths/day. Its disheartening that our leaders refuse to put in place policies/actions to help. We need to say no to them.
960878689817907201 2018-02-06 14:11:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Unbelievable! And this is exactly why @GOP and @KellyannePolls will have NO impact on the opioid crisis. Their prescription for everything seems to be thoughts and prayers. So..when you get the flu, dont call your doctor or ER and demand treatment. Just go to church. Good luckhttps://twitter.com/colmorrisdavis/status/960849747853574146

960873482434334720 2018-02-06 13:51:05 UTC <BlueAshMaester> From POLITICO - politicians cant solve this issue. Just sat no doesnt work. A Wall wont impact the crisis.

960665753627357185 2018-02-05 00:05:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @premera @HeatherWhaley I worked for a large insurer and processed appeals on a daily basis.

960208950904938497 2018-02-04 17:50:28 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Margari2549 Cure depends on type and extent of disease. For many it is a chronic illness. Definitely need more research. There are genetic components to many cancers. Diet and exercise can be factors as well as other factors - obesity, environment, etc.

956642691042848768 2018-01-25 21:39:25 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @senrobportman on @CNN was asked today about the opioid crisis. His response...majority of opioids coming from China through the mail system so we should concentrate on that. Fine...but what about the people?  What are you doing to discourage addiction??

955187441744441344 2018-01-21 21:16:47 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JuddLegum I agree. This is a huge #MeToo story and there has been very little reported. Thanks for bringing attention to this story.
955186552702980096 2018-01-21 21:13:15 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kylegriffin1 Is there possibly an adult emerging from this mess? @LindseyGrahamSC just said what many have been saying for months.
955169664631541762 2018-01-21 20:06:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @POTUS @GOP @realDonaldTrump @CNN @StephenMilIer @LindseyGrahamSC @potpourri72 Yep. I agree.

955168038512480258 2018-01-21 19:59:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @CNN @StephenMilIer @LindseyGrahamSC @potpourri72 Really... hopefully. Right now he is the adult in the room. Watch the interview if you can. He even in some ways calls out @POTUS
955164784466513923 2018-01-21 19:46:45 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @LindseyGrahamSC just called out @StephenMilIer on @CNN saying that as long as Miller is advising @realDonaldTrump on immigration nothing is going to get done. Maybe too late but at least someone @GOP is speaking out about this!

Then, no one can trust @realDonaldTrump and the @WhiteHouse staff. @GOP and @realDonaldTrump own this. There is no reason #CHIP and #DACA should be bargaining chips (pardon the pun).
954772671610408976 2018-01-20 17:48:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @SenTomCotton @POTUS @democrats @GOP @Bev_Didier Not blaming @TheDemocrats for the shutdown. This shutdown is owned by @realDonaldTrump
954771130522402817 2018-01-20 17:42:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump @democrats @GOP @Bev_Didier It is very evident that this whole deal has been sabotaged by @POTUS. And it appears that he listens to his staff rather than the Congress or the US people. #TrumpShutdown trending
954769982621143040 2018-01-20 17:37:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @democrats @GOP @Bev_Didier They shouldnt.
954768074128883712 2018-01-20 17:30:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @democrats Think about this. The North and South Koreans met over few DAYS and came to agreement to combine their athletes for the Olympics.  @GOP and @Democrats have had MONTHS and cant agree on anything except blaming each other. And..where is @POTUS?
954713900905267201 2018-01-20 13:55:06 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Very simple @SenMajLdr - @GOP rode the Trump Train over the cliff.

The children in DC dont care about the American people. They care only about themselves and their donors. Now they blame each other just like 3rd grade. They need to be sent home.

952981368102965250 2018-01-15 19:10:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And...where is @SenMajLdr? Nothing...silence... #BlueWave2018 #TheResistance
952981018373484545 2018-01-15 19:09:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Until recently I was not aware that you could quantify racism. @realDonaldTrump said I am the least racist person you will ever interview....  Least racist to me implies you are racist but not as bad as others. Sad time in the US when @POTUS has to declare this.
952932757025513472 2018-01-15 15:57:28 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Like the rest of @GOP he only cares about his donors, not the people of Ohio.  Hey @senrobportman please come to SW Ohio and do a town hall.  Please.https://twitter.com/kevinfiliatraut/status/952656835403763715

I know with 100% certainty that if I had made the remarks @realDonaldTrump made yesterday I would have been fired immediately. This is unacceptable @GOP!

951821117773287424 2018-01-12 14:20:13 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I think it very interesting that the only place @GOP feels comfortable is @FoxNews. No @CNN or @MSNBC.

950008294499856384 2018-01-07 14:16:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Thank you @jaketapper for cutting off @StephenMillerAL!! You are correct - he was speaking to only one viewer. Just rambling nonsense and nothing else.
950007382767230977 2018-01-07 14:13:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @jaketapper - if @StephenMillerAL continues to attack you on your show on @CNN with his rambling nonsense just cut him off and say goodbye. He is just spewing @GOP nonsense in a very condescending manner. He is obviously not going to give you straight answers.
949979168510480384 2018-01-07 12:20:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @candy_cavalier I got sucked back in during a moment of weakness. Actually I forgot to turn off notifications. Oh well....
949656594605838336 2018-01-06 14:59:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @RedTRaccoon Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots and ruined your black tie affair ...... Sorry, Garth.  Everybody except 1 gets a scoop of ice cream if they are good! And..he gets 2 no matter what...
949655508205690881 2018-01-06 14:54:51 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @davidfrum Im betting its the opposite. Dogs have a great sense of who to trust and who to like. I know... I have 2 huskies.

949621930189090818 2018-01-06 12:41:25 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @SenatorCollins Sorry.. not believable. You sold out for a promise. The people of Maine will remember during #BlueWave2018. At least here in SW Ohio we can count on @senrobportman @RepBradWenstrup @RepSteveChabot to always follow their donors wishes. #TheResistance
949368924415590400 2018-01-05 19:56:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I just cant take it anymore so I am taking a break from social media for the weekend. When the majority of threads deal with preventing books being published, burning books, sexual molestation by Congress and (the most disturbing) sanity of @POTUS, I need a break. See you Mon!

949334765370560517 2018-01-05 17:40:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @TheDemocrats @GOP @tamaram62877538 Yep. When they say this they want it to appear that they have spoken to the voters. @SenSherrodBrown @senrobportman @RepBradWenstrup @RepSteveChabot here in SW Ohio have no idea what we think.
949326175435968512 2018-01-05 17:06:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @GOP and @TheDemocrats - please do not use the phrase the American people want to.... unless you have come to my community, held a town hall, and heard our views. You DO NOT speak for me. This is just smoke and mirrors for what your donors are telling you! Enough!!
949289403037421568 2018-01-05 14:40:05 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MikePenceVP @ZaibatsuNews @LOVNLA Yep. Im sure he was extremely uncomfortable given his state of mind

949032490194407424 2018-01-04 21:39:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @funder The only things they are good at is thoughts and prayers. Their silence on everything else is suspicious. A good criminal investigation is to follow the money. Wonder where it leads....
949027278754844673 2018-01-04 21:18:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ZaibatsuNews Im betting @MikePenceVP didnt bake a cake for the Jones family. His record with the #LGBTQ community especially in Indiana is well known. This photo speaks volumes.
949026624057507846 2018-01-04 21:15:53 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @washingtonpost Thanks @GOP and @jeffsessions. This action almost guarantees young voters and people who need medical marijuana will become part of #BlueWave2018 and #TheResistance. Keep spending taxpayer $$ for senseless programs. @GOP owns it and are accountable
949024447419305984 2018-01-04 21:07:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @fanniesroom Count me in. #MeToo.
949022907417747458 2018-01-04 21:01:07 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I agree with everyone in this thread. It is very suspicious that every single @GOP including those who are retiring are silent on everything going on. Blackmail? Criminal acts? Complicity in election fraud? Who knows. But...I agree this is larger than Watergate.https://twitter.com/edkrassen/status/947982018339573760

948959183814217728 2018-01-04 16:47:54 UTC <BlueAshMaester> The one thing that stands out today is that @realDonaldTrump has not called the book, any reporting of the book, the author, or any contributor #FakeNews. They are trying, via legal system, to keep the horse in the barn but no other statement. Hey @GOP - anything??
948952123084959744 2018-01-04 16:19:51 UTC <BlueAshMaester> At some point @realDonaldTrump will say he influenced which name was pulled from the bowl. Any bets?https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/948950162474504193

948908808327303170 2018-01-04 13:27:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Juliem24Juliana Oh...absolutely.
948730560515596288 2018-01-03 01:39:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JeffFlake Really? Is that all you can say? You are part of @GOP who owns this due to complicity. Silence and thoughts and prayers show the true nature of what has consumed this country over the past year. @GOP has done nothing for their voters...just their donors. #BlueWave2018
948705424152367104 2018-01-03 23:59:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @StevenBeschloss Dogs are pretty good judges of character - I have 2. They would probably run away....

While the media salivates, while leaders argue the size of nuc buttons, while @GOP says nothing, our allies pull away, terror groups plot, and we appear weak. @GOP owns this and are accountable

As stated by http://Cincinnati.com - here is what Mike Brown needs to answer - are you in business to win a championship?https://twitter.com/bengals/status/948315727102119937

947184178579337221 2017-12-30 19:14:40 UTC <BlueAshMaester> From CNN:  Very appropriate especially for the nonsense he tried while Gov of Indiana. Maybe there is a #LGBTQ bakery there that will refuse to bake him a cake.....https://apple.news/A6jIoyTdER9eAOBX8HOSDpg
947182734677626885 2017-12-30 19:08:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @DawnTur41902966 Not sure yet about us but we will pay more. Im sure there are many others paying more that will find out soon. For us it is the prop tax/state/local cap that we will exceed. And I work part time too.
947182133298302976 2017-12-30 19:06:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @mysteri00013322 And we in SW Ohio hold @senrobportman @RepBradWenstrup and @RepSteveChabot responsible.

947161364459675650 2017-12-30 17:44:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I did the math and will pay more under #TaxBillScam.   US House 435 US Senate 100 VP 1 Pres 1 Total 537 US pop 325 million  US Fed policy is made by 0.0002% of population mainly old, white, career politicians. This is fact based on math.

944403582606020608 2017-12-22 03:05:34 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kitty62862 He is an amazing player and I still love to watch him skate. He was in Columbus with the Flames a couple weeks ago. Not as fast as he was but can still hold his own. We saw him in Pitts in 93 or 94. Lemieux had a hat trick and Jagr scored too. Amazing game. Best athletes ever
944401159879581696 2017-12-22 02:55:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kitty62862 I know. And Jaromir is a great player. I would love to see anyone who boos try to get out there for 1 minute and do what these great athletes do.
944400161916284928 2017-12-22 02:51:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kitty62862 Hes a good player but he gets booed in Columbus because of how he left. People who had his jerseys crossed his name out on their backs. There has always been this rumor that he at some point will return to Columbus to finish out his career. Who knows.
944398455035846658 2017-12-22 02:45:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kitty62862 sorry....also meant to say go Blue Jackets in addition to thanks. Poor Rick Nash. He left Columbus on not the best of terms.
944397727353491457 2017-12-22 02:42:18 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @JohnKasich @docrocktex26 @Temporal_Fugue @RyanJKaz Always. Every day.
944397571484798976 2017-12-22 02:41:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @HollyJahangiri Women do not casually abort or use abortion as a for of birth control. This is an extremely difficult decision even in the oops situations. Politicians have no business or right to legislate this issue.
944395807737950208 2017-12-22 02:34:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @marieproia Probably will be

944394708733841408 2017-12-22 02:30:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @HollyJahangiri Totally agree.
944394374028386307 2017-12-22 02:28:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @Temporal_Fugue Yep. Sure is.
944394193329410049 2017-12-22 02:28:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @KB805 These can be diagnosed in the prenatal period via amniocentesis using FISH testing as well as CVS. Spina Bifida is usually diagnosed by AFP screening and ultrasound. Hope that helps.
944392289278980096 2017-12-22 02:20:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 Well said.
944392038224744449 2017-12-22 02:19:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GWillie1968 My pleasure. I have spent the last 30+ years advocating for gender equality and womens rights. With the stroke of a pen @JohnKasich and @GOP can undo anything they choose. The fight continues... thanks for your kind words
944391499621502976 2017-12-22 02:17:34 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JohnKasich @Terrysagirl Thanks. I knew I forgot something.
944391409901162496 2017-12-22 02:17:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @georgegalka Thats a logical thought but I can assure you no state will step up and do it. They want to legislate the decision but have no responsibility for the outcome.

944390411367444481 2017-12-22 02:13:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kitty62862 States and especially politicians have no business making these decisions. Should only be between patient and physician.
944390081141510145 2017-12-22 02:11:55 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @kyjablue Very sorry to hear. Ive had patients say that something like this is never forgotten. Thought for you and your family
944389637115666433 2017-12-22 02:10:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @docrocktex26 @NancyHerr4 OB/GYN is still a very sought after profession but there are shortages in some states especially in very rural areas. Most of us in this field of medicine are very strong advocates for equality and womens rights.

942081128445378561 2017-12-16 17:16:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @tamaram62877538 I guess. My whole education and career has been evidence/science based. Im hoping the folks at the CDC really push back on this.

940937584112435202 2017-12-13 13:32:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> To all @GOP and @TheDemocrats local, state, and federal - we the people are your employers and time has come to listen to us. We will not tolerate racism, inequality, bigotry, or misogyny. Stop focusing on things from the past. Fund CHIP. Pass tax reform for all. Pass healthcare.
940936437729460225 2017-12-13 13:28:23 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Please @MooreSenate get on your horse and ride home. You LOST! Decency, tolerance, and equality won. Take the day off and go shopping at the mall....oh wait....https://twitter.com/cnn/status/940804210328834049

940728227215171585 2017-12-12 23:41:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @corenaboo Wonder where his right hand is. Shame on both of us!
940726346782838790 2017-12-12 23:33:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @IHSgov @acognews @micklirish @NPR @D22815Deb Thanks. Yes...I was surprised and disappointed
940721729491685376 2017-12-12 23:15:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @eddyrogerparker Yep. Just wait for it
940709477254385665 2017-12-12 22:26:31 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Im betting at least 50% of the men in this photo have secrets they are hoping wont come out. I dont have any facts....I just know its true.https://twitter.com/jenniferjjacobs/status/940300471239102465

940650077063872512 2017-12-12 18:30:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @skrbelly1 Yes it does. Facial expressions and body language say a lot about a person.
940638389426184192 2017-12-12 17:44:02 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @jeffsessions was asked who he voted for today. Well...we all know who he voted for. But, he told reporters with a grin on his face that he believes in the sanctity of the ballot.   IMO...if you wont say who you voted for and why, you are embarrassed by your choice.
940637461562224642 2017-12-12 17:40:21 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @skrbelly1 Its just disturbing
940635056426635266 2017-12-12 17:30:48 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Seriously?? How much more racist can you get? Ranks right up there with some of my friends are black. How can anyone in 2017 tolerate or vote for someone with these feelings? And...he looks pretty creepy standing behind her.https://twitter.com/cnn/status/940536107317514240

940623187838201856 2017-12-12 16:43:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @candy_cavalier Correction - I think the horses name is Sassy.
940622722471567361 2017-12-12 16:41:47 UTC <BlueAshMaester> So true.
940622603059912704 2017-12-12 16:41:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @candy_cavalier I have never been to Alabama except through an airport. Today, the nation and the world will see the soul of this state. The business community will be judged if they are an employer in this state. A true referendum on hate, inequality, bigotry, sexual harassment, and racism.
940620128370257926 2017-12-12 16:31:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @candy_cavalier Yep...shows ignorance, ego, narcissism, and contempt as well as many of the 7 deadly sins in one horseback ride. Maybe the horse (who by the way is a female named Sally) will either throw him off or at least pee on him.
940614802325504000 2017-12-12 16:10:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @megaholt I know many over worked night RNs. No apology needed. I totally understand.
940614455599214593 2017-12-12 16:08:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @IHSgov @acognews @NPR @micklirish @kikilea_kiki @DADIG123 Was per phone call. I filled out an application to volunteer and then had a phone interview with a physician medical director in Phoenix. In retrospect they did not put anything in writing. Im Board certified OB/GYN with 30+ years in medicine with 0 liability cases.
940613039967145991 2017-12-12 16:03:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @megaholt Thanks. Looking forward to sharing ideas
940612871666495488 2017-12-12 16:02:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @skrbelly1 So...will he not wear a shirt too?  Now that would be a Kodak moment.  Or...maybe not
940612536650649603 2017-12-12 16:01:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Seems that way. I dont get it
940612181883748352 2017-12-12 15:59:54 UTC <BlueAshMaester> And Im betting it will be a young horse..... I know. Shame on me.
940611755885068289 2017-12-12 15:58:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Rumor has it that @MooreSenate will go to vote today on HORSEBACK. Ok...why? What does this prove? Accused child molester and alleged sexual harasser rides a horse for a photo op?  Mocking his victims? Cant wait for the memes.....
940610276164071424 2017-12-12 15:52:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @IHSgov @acognews @micklirish @NPR @YvonneMaxwell17 Yep. Hard to believe there is little support for these proud people.

940589874729635840 2017-12-12 14:31:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I am a physician in Ohio.

940585883522170880 2017-12-12 14:15:24 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This Tweet in itself is sexual harassment. It implies that there would be sexual favors in exchange for contributions.

939540992620982274 2017-12-09 17:03:23 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Interesting question - What will it take? After watching one of the Indiana Jones movies the other day I thought about this very question.

939497100722757632 2017-12-09 14:08:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @smerconish - you described your view on the allegations of @MooreSenate based on critical thinking. I dont think that exists much today. Partisan behavior, emotions, and knee jerk reactions rule,  sadly.  What we are seeing daily is not normal. #MeToo
939479288851697666 2017-12-09 12:58:11 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Could not have been said better!!  I 100% agree.https://twitter.com/sethmoulton/status/939302837087035392

939326211339235329 2017-12-08 02:49:55 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 There should be zero tolerance for this behavior. Glad to hear you spoke out. If you hadnt it probably would have gotten worse. Congrats fir your courage

939313322532462593 2017-12-08 01:58:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 More to come....sad to say. This behavior has been going on a long time. Im really glad however that women are feeling empowered to speak out. #MeToo showed the power of social media.

939294087626227712 2017-12-08 00:42:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ElayneMckenna In his tent cities outside Phoenix he treated dogs better than the undocumented folks. But...in the role of dog catcher, I could only imagine how the dogs would be treated. Pink underwear maybe... He should not be allowed to run for Senate.
939292380066402304 2017-12-08 00:35:29 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 Yep. Last year was Cousin Eddie. I just love that movie. And whys the carpet wet, Todd?

939277092134490117 2017-12-08 23:34:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Ive said it before and will say it again. You just cant make this up. Convicted and then pardoned. Now thinking about running for Senate?

939151975920390145 2017-12-08 15:17:34 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ricksbrowder Isnt that sad. You might be right. Only 3 died. I think some previous family members have stated they would run for office. They will just get out funded by @NRA. We can only hope
939151448675414016 2017-12-08 15:15:28 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BocoCgi There was nothing political in the question posed. I responded - yes a gun can be carried on the AT but since many states are covered you must have a CCW that is reciprocal with each state. If not state law applies. Now I am soy-bean boy and a snowflake. Ive been called worse...
939148444366667777 2017-12-08 15:03:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BocoCgi Yep. Snow can be powerful. My post described how you can legally carry a gun while hiking the AT (which I do by the way). There was nothing political about it. I guess this person was just trolling. And I dont need soy or onions....
939144727886262273 2017-12-08 14:48:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Someone on another social media site called me a soy-bean boy and a snowflake while I was giving some advice about carrying a gun while hiking the AT. Not sure what a soy-bean boy is but I reminded this person that many snowflakes can cause piles of snow and impact change.
939112701875441664 2017-12-08 12:41:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @BillClinton @JackKingston @CNN @DotCalmsshadow Oh... about those @HillaryClinton emails he would say.

938958267056869377 2017-12-07 02:27:50 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Mistakenly turned on @CNN while searching for a hockey game. @JackKingston talking about congressional sexual harassment and brings up @BillClinton.

938922808977121280 2017-12-07 00:06:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MALabounty Im from Ohio. We just cant let this be normal.
938922559453696000 2017-12-07 00:05:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @KSTksti I totally agree. I just cant believe no one is discussing.
938922345087078400 2017-12-07 00:05:06 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @KSTksti @apgroner It sure seems that way. Today it is like this never happened.
938897557799006208 2017-12-07 22:26:36 UTC <BlueAshMaester> There was a SCHOOL SHOOTING today but the news outlets seem to be obsessed with implications of sexual harassment in Congress. 3 people died.  It was in New Mexico. In Aztec. Has this become the norm?    Again...there was a school shooting today.

938875798123175936 2017-12-07 21:00:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Poster child for my disgust of @GOP and @TheDemocrats today. How do you defend someone like this? Most American companies and institutions have a zero tolerance policy for this behavior. But US Congress has a hush fund from taxpayer $$ with no transparency.pic.twitter.com/V15gqljbEc

937325624301105152 2017-12-03 14:20:18 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Tweets this morning from @realDonaldTrump are concerning. Im certainly no expert but it seems like, reading between the lines, there are signs of desperation. @HillaryClinton did not plead guilty to a crime. @Comey did his job and was fired. @GOP needs to wake up. IMO
937317487061938176 2017-12-03 13:47:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> That is just disgusting!!  You were elected to better the lives of your constituents. Have you lost your soul?

937304880540241920 2017-12-03 12:57:52 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @TheDemocrats @GOP @Juliem24Juliana I too worry about the next generation. Politicians seem to care about themselves and the moment. As with the tax issues in the 80s, these regs will cause issues for years to come.

936964120355713024 2017-12-02 14:23:48 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Yep. Very true... @GOP owns it now and Ohio will not forget @senrobportman or @RepBradWenstrup. Hopefully the voters in @wisgop wont either.https://twitter.com/speakerryan/status/167647060957462528

936707623289786368 2017-12-01 21:24:35 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP may have their win in December 2017. But....in 2018, criminal prosecution may take care of the corruption in the Executive Branch and The People may take care of the greed and dishonesty in Congress during the election.

936287987058511872 2017-11-30 17:37:06 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump claims that the Tax Bill will cost him money and that his wealthy friends are not happy with him. Well....the only way to know if that is true is for him to release his tax returns as have most other presidents. Otherwise, we can call his statement FakeNews.
936285892561555457 2017-11-30 17:28:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> At this point @GOP owns this bill and all its implications.

934945498930335744 2017-11-26 00:42:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 Thanks for your kind words. Yes...the best part is that women are feeling safe to come out and expose these creeps. We have not seen the end yet, Im sure. #MeToo
934944993260855296 2017-11-26 00:40:31 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @jevarn_o Yep....simply none
934944689744203776 2017-11-26 00:39:19 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @tamaram62877538 So the irony is that he got worse punishment than the accused.  But...the victim lost her life.  How sad!

934931723737030657 2017-11-26 23:47:47 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Another one exposed. Sexual molestation is not just in politics....it exists throughout our society. Anyone who defends this or makes excuses for this behavior does not realize the lives that are permanently damaged. Shame on those who think this is normalhttps://apple.news/AB4w_J3gGRKuG9Se6KGkWmw

934859569632763904 2017-11-26 19:01:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ElisaWilding Yep. Im not judging either. Unless Im affected I really dont care but as we are seeing there are consequences and I dont think we are at the end of this. Others will be revealed. Im so glad that women are feeling empowered to speak out #MeToo
934858352303239168 2017-11-26 18:56:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ElisaWilding With all the stories Ive heard in my OB/GYN practice I would believe anything.  Once photos are posted, they are on the internet forever. I guess people think they will never be discovered so they just put it all out there. I dont understand
934856549121626113 2017-11-26 18:49:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @tamaram62877538 Yep....perfect.  My thoughts too
934853697829556224 2017-11-26 18:37:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @ElisaWilding Rant on....please. I dont understand the whole sending nude photos even with consent. Why do this? A way to meet others? How does the receiver know the photo is real? I just dont get it. So...rant on!

934821644186607621 2017-11-26 16:30:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> A disgusting post reported by from someone who claims to care for patients. This person should be fired immediately.https://apple.news/AzMFL5dKfSCq1VLE-lpSdbw
934785429680939009 2017-11-26 14:06:28 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Over the next few months, Congress, @GOP and @TheDemocrats, will show us their opinions on tax reforms, CHIP, DACA, sexual harassment, immigration,and party over country. We will be watching because in 2018 WE will show them our opinions during the elections. Get your CVs updated
934780033310363648 2017-11-26 13:45:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> But instead... no comments on fallen soldiers, Tweets about NFL, IT WAS ME, tax cuts for wealthy, attempts to control media, and the stupid Time mag issue among others. @GOP owns this and will pay dearly in 2018.  Oh...and I almost forgot support for child molestation. #MeToo

I said I was busy playing with my 2 Huskies and took a pass. Thanks anyway! Maybe next year.

933057307986055168 2017-11-21 19:39:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP For someone who is well educated and intelligent, @SpeakerRyan posted a Tweet that was not well thought out. $700 sounds great but will not in this scenario lead to saving for the future. As prices of everything rise that $700 will be gone soon and nothing for saving.

933049497655107584 2017-11-21 19:08:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> When asked about @MooreSenate, @KellyannePolls said that he needs to be elected because they need his vote for tax reform.  So an alleged child molester is ok as long as he votes your way? You are demeaning all women who are victims. Shame on you and @GOP for this. #MeToopic.twitter.com/ikJABOSw60
933047175998779393 2017-11-21 18:59:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Just how and why would you politicize a turkey pardon at Thanksgiving? Why would anyone imply that they would overturn last years turkey pardon just because @BarackObama gave it? This was just nonsense. Those turkeys better write thank you notes or they may be heading to China
932987070305488900 2017-11-21 15:00:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This is so true but lets remember that there are some women out there that abuse and harass men (although not nearly to the extent as with men). If there is a silver lining to recent events, women are speaking up and showing us who these abusers are. #MeToohttps://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/932775517073428482

932732935677112321 2017-11-20 22:10:35 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Protecting animals is a horror show?

932205654042972160 2017-11-19 11:15:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @agreatgadsby @wesley_jordan @SonyaBaker2 Very true. I was not implying that they were but over the past few weeks that has been the pattern. Thanks for clarification
932069403398754305 2017-11-18 02:13:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Dubs1Koukla They are getting exposed. Finally victims are speaking out. There will be more. #MeToo
932069198087499776 2017-11-18 02:13:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @dmtschmidt Probably. There will be more exposed. Im betting there are lots of secrets
932056563799519232 2017-11-18 01:22:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> My thoughts are for these poor innocent little girls and their families. This guy needs to be prosecuted for what he has allegedly done.

931889999934566401 2017-11-18 14:21:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @mahmoud_atry @EdKrassen We are seeing the tip of an iceberg. There are going to be more... there are many more out there. Women and men need to speak up in real time. #MeToo And the victims need to be heard and respected, not demonized.
931705448776036352 2017-11-17 02:07:43 UTC <BlueAshMaester> More @GOP hypocrisy- An Ohio lawmaker who routinely touted his Christian faith and anti-LGBT views has resigned after being caught having sex with a man in his office.

931548186820403202 2017-11-17 15:42:49 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @carriepricecox3 True but if there was sexual harassment he should also be investigated. This is not a party issue. Its an ethical and moral issue. #MeToo
931547743197302786 2017-11-17 15:41:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP @BeebleZapp @RosaSalpietro It was international IMO

929509584842223616 2017-11-11 00:42:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> So Im learning. Every day something new. Every day.
929508028470226944 2017-11-11 00:35:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Thanks. As you can probably see I know very little about the Trump empire. Appreciate you giving me some education on the subject.
929506309153673216 2017-11-11 00:29:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Ok. Nothing surprises me anymore. Thanks.

929504661316489216 2017-11-11 00:22:35 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Im confused. Is she an advisor or running a business? Isnt there ethical issues here?
929504046175711234 2017-11-11 00:20:08 UTC <BlueAshMaester> So....who paid for this trip? Are Secret Service along?

929384910569295872 2017-11-11 16:26:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @SarahLerner Thanks. Appreciate your kind words. There are good guys out there. Unfortunately over the past few days we have been focusing on the bad.

929344354141003776 2017-11-11 13:45:35 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @1stOhioBattery I hate to say this but there seems to be players who dont want to be out there. Maybe its time for a shake up....like a trade. Im a season ticket holder for many years. @BlueJacketsNHL seems to be slipping back to some old ways. Just my opinion. #CBJ
929334150406070273 2017-11-11 13:05:02 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Best line from last night @billmaher on @HBO - per @HardballChris - after the past couple days, we now know what the @GOP age of consent is.   When you think things can not get any more strange, just look back at the last week and re-read the excuses for child molestation.

929149876629377024 2017-11-10 00:52:48 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 I meant I dont follow him. I would never say who to follow and who not to. Not my style. Have a great evening.

929144582733991938 2017-11-10 00:31:45 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JacqueGWhite2 Dont follow him. I was just retweeting to make a point about how much I cant understand how anyone can defend/excuse child molestation. This should not be political. Its a moral/ethical issue. But apparently Carroll doesnt like liberals. I dont get it.
929138188437909515 2017-11-10 00:06:21 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Silkesaint You cant make this up. Read the whole post. You too will be amazed.
929135110464638976 2017-11-10 23:54:07 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @DynastyGOAT Yes we are.
929134921691684869 2017-11-10 23:53:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Carolyn_Hoechst Yes...and that is why women (and men too) dont come forward. If the abuse is not traumatic enough, they are then subjected to more. Today I saw where someone wants to prosecute folks who take so long to come forward. That just enables the abuser. #MeToo
929134022378352640 2017-11-10 23:49:48 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Seriously? Child molestation is being politicized?  Folks would vote for a person who knowingly committed a crime over someone who had different political views? Why just not vote?https://twitter.com/waltmd/status/929090239632760833
929132310418608129 2017-11-10 23:42:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Carolyn_Hoechst No...it was an expression that I just cant believe what some folks will say about this terrible situation. How anyone can defend child molestation is beyond me.  This is not about politics...this is a crime. Sorry if I wasnt more clear.
929131268054364160 2017-11-10 23:38:51 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Oh no. Another Judge from Alabama??  You cant make this up.https://twitter.com/chicagotribune/status/929034359641960448

928976437947838464 2017-11-10 13:23:37 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Let us never forget that pedophilia is NEVER consensual. It is a crime. Anyone who says its consensual is either ignorant or possibly trying to defend their own actions. This is not about party or politics. Its about basic morals. Defending @MooreSenate says you are complicit
928974194146201603 2017-11-10 13:14:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This is so disturbing for so many reasons. @GOP is complicit in this behavior if they dont denounce it ASAP.

922942229416759297 2017-10-24 21:45:49 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Iwillnotmelt It is very concerning especially since there has been minimal info given out about the circumstances regarding these deaths.
922941765627334656 2017-10-24 21:43:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @HarmonicHulaHoe @Iwillnotmelt Yep. Very concerning
922938304978407427 2017-10-24 21:30:13 UTC <BlueAshMaester> No matter which party, this speech showed that @JeffFlake is true to his values and principles. I applaud his courage.https://twitter.com/kasie/status/922905995667558401

922937746695614464 2017-10-24 21:28:00 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @HarmonicHulaHoe I know. She thinks the casket is empty per WH Press Conference today. @SarahHuckabee was asked the question.
922936905221754885 2017-10-24 21:24:40 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I think it is absolutely disgusting that a Glod Star wife is concerned that the casket of her deceased husband is empty. She needs answers!

921831328353603584 2017-10-21 20:11:30 UTC <BlueAshMaester> 5 former Presidents encouraging compassion - 1 current President playing golf and attacking a Congresswoman and Gold Star family. You decide

921736795443875840 2017-10-21 13:55:51 UTC <BlueAshMaester> It is sad to think that in 2017 a major news story involves a debate over what was said to a Gold Star family during a condolence call

921455380433162240 2017-10-20 19:17:37 UTC <BlueAshMaester> And I guess no one @FoxNews checked his background prior to the interview?? You just cant make this up.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/921439138259365888

921444156765073409 2017-10-20 18:33:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @realDonaldTrump By attacking @RepWilson, @POTUS is also attacking the wife and family of a Gold Star soldier. My thoughts are with the families.

921364008392937473 2017-10-20 13:14:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> The death of an American soldier is not a political event. Words matter - its not always what one says, its about how it is perceived

920781641399889920 2017-10-18 22:40:25 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @liserg14 Yep. Unbelievable
920781556012191744 2017-10-18 22:40:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @liserg14 We are still a free society but there are those who want to take away freedoms based on race, sex orientation, $$, and others.

917154895479885824 2017-10-08 22:29:01 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Z06TomCat Totally agree
917137509469040640 2017-10-08 21:19:56 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @LindaLroseymom Oh.. nice dog too
917137181017337856 2017-10-08 21:18:38 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Z06TomCat Hope then they can afford the ACLU lawsuit fees as well as customer boycotts. No company is above being called out for discrimination
917136768327192576 2017-10-08 21:16:59 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @kjblackhawk @RhutaBhayga Its not snarky if true.
917136451460063232 2017-10-08 21:15:44 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @LindaLroseymom Mine are only for birthday cupcakes
917136256420794369 2017-10-08 21:14:57 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @gottaluvliz @Z06TomCat As well as people boycotting the business
917136075260383232 2017-10-08 21:14:14 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Cincychacha A law like this got passed in Indiana under Mike Pence. It lasted just a few days due to public outcry. Im sure ACLU is already on this
917131936430198784 2017-10-08 20:57:47 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @LindaLroseymom Great dogs arent they. I have 2. Lots of fur but well worth it.pic.twitter.com/xnkM51I8DL
917128251100852225 2017-10-08 20:43:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hmmmm... not sure how to answer your question. How about - we could only hope hes not.
917126099309645825 2017-10-08 20:34:36 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @VP @DemWrite @BalelBauer @jlynn122 @tinyboo49 He will blame it on a staffer. I would bet on it.
917125838495211520 2017-10-08 20:33:33 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @CalReason He will blame it on a staffer just wait for it.
917125307425087489 2017-10-08 20:31:27 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @MYHDSpringer Sure does
917124743840575489 2017-10-08 20:29:12 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Maybe but most people would have taken and posted a current photo.
917123950928424962 2017-10-08 20:26:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Exactly. Reports are saying people in PR are eating dog food and there is a lack of water. This is just...shameful @VPhttps://twitter.com/owillis/status/917120521363484674

917120663084814341 2017-10-08 20:13:00 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @RhutaBhayga @kjblackhawk I agree. No way $$ will get paid back.

917106452950548480 2017-10-08 19:16:32 UTC <BlueAshMaester> This is just shameful

916729916133175296 2017-10-07 18:20:18 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @nekosaurous At this point, does not seem like she has done anything positive.
916668453439893504 2017-10-07 14:16:04 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP Possibly but this behavior should not be tolerated here in the US in 2017. We need equality and respect for everyone.
916666641546694657 2017-10-07 14:08:52 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP I guess it all goes back to the idea of the fair sex. Men felt they need to protect therefore they could dominate/abuse.
916662722028335104 2017-10-07 13:53:18 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @1960Doe Great dogs. It is known.
916660492172656640 2017-10-07 13:44:26 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Throughout history this is how most cultures were based. Hard to reverse old traditions I guess. Thought we were making progress until @GOP
916648490331246592 2017-10-07 12:56:45 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP Thanks. Ive spent my entire career advocating for healthcare rights especially for women. What these guys are doing sets US back so far.

910863141852114944 2017-09-21 13:47:50 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Really??  You just keep thinking that, @SHSPRESSSEC. Nice try but nobody is believing you. Look at the other faces in the photo.https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/910539029594112000

910858191134711808 2017-09-21 13:28:10 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Why pay an insurance comp to make a profit (and pay CEOs) with $$ that may be used to treat patients?  Yes...as a physician, I'm for that.https://twitter.com/distrumpia/status/910212105726394368

910855921403858944 2017-09-21 13:19:09 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @DisTrumpia Universal HC vs NO HC?  Hmmm... What is needed is for healthcare insurers to be nonprofit. When $$ involved, decisions get blurred.

910687598842122240 2017-09-20 02:10:17 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I'm betting that ED drugs in large quantities are covered at 100% with no copay/deductible. Anyone surprised?  Check age/sex of supportershttps://twitter.com/gavinnewsom/status/910209191838486528

910686697658241024 2017-09-20 02:06:43 UTC <BlueAshMaester> I can't imagine why it would be covered....oh, wait a minute...a bunch of old white men are making the decisions. Little blue pills for all!https://twitter.com/mrdane1982/status/910671256307093504
910668239411273728 2017-09-20 00:53:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Here we go again. Big Luther - again the obsession with size. Loyal to me - what about loyalty to the people of Alabama?https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/910480918816739328
910666730120318976 2017-09-20 00:47:22 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Hey @GOP are you listening to the people?  I'm glad organizations, governors, and healthcare systems are speaking out.https://twitter.com/senkamalaharris/status/910564407612190721
910666089637478400 2017-09-20 00:44:49 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GavinNewsom Is anyone surprised??  The way @GOP appears to support gender inequality this would be consistent. If they pass it.. they own it.
910665243201871872 2017-09-20 00:41:27 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Oh really??  Can we have a list of activities?  I'm busy too. Can I get the fed to pay for my travel?https://twitter.com/safetypindaily/status/910654909296644096

910484771473571841 2017-09-20 12:44:20 UTC <BlueAshMaester> At some point it will come out
910329592002596865 2017-09-19 02:27:42 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JohnKasich @GOP @mwr_dbm @CalReason Yep. So these sicker people with no coverage will be taken care of and the hospital will absorb the cost because patients will be bankrupt
910327667274256384 2017-09-19 02:20:03 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JohnKasich @GOP @mwr_dbm @CalReason I know. Just wanted to put it out there. Patients will be sicker and show up in ERs with higher acuity illness=higher costs with no coverage
910326566571397126 2017-09-19 02:15:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> If @GOP passes this, they own it. 2018 is just around the corner and we will remember what you have done. @robportmanhttps://twitter.com/patientaction/status/910272359587880960
910325552367718401 2017-09-19 02:11:39 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Nitemists He doesn't care.
910325455273828358 2017-09-19 02:11:16 UTC <BlueAshMaester> And who could blame her. In public she is treated so badly. Can't imagine how she's treated when the cameras are off
910325060036153344 2017-09-19 02:09:41 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Nitemists Yep. Sure was.
910324573706518529 2017-09-19 02:07:46 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @JohnKasich @GOP @mwr_dbm @CalReason Speaking for myself, I do not see patients for the $$$. I care about my patients health. You are right... there are $ implications.
910324088081657857 2017-09-19 02:05:50 UTC <BlueAshMaester> As a physician in OH, I would like to know if anyone in @GOP has discussed this bill with any healthcare systems? @robportman can you tell?
910294426878083072 2017-09-19 00:07:58 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @Angela411975 I'm sure they do. Stone cold faces with disbelief in their eyes.
910294156496576512 2017-09-19 00:06:54 UTC <BlueAshMaester> Thanks to OH Gov @JohnKasich for coming out against this cruel bill. Hopefully other @GOP Govs will do the same.https://twitter.com/amyklobuchar/status/910287138192809984

909936095940550657 2017-09-18 00:24:05 UTC <BlueAshMaester> @GOP and these white men do not care about the average American. They care about $$, themselves, and getting re-elected.https://twitter.com/cap_health/status/909838219809820672
