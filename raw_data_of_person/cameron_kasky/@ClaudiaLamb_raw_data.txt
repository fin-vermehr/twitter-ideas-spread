I recently reflected on how vital Newsweek was in the 80s and 90s for filling in international events and science developments, as well as deep dives the local papers missed. Lasts week's 'Where do you go when you die?" ensured no more clicks from me ever.

962832370477948928 2018-02-11 23:35:00 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @blaineharden @BarbaraDemick @GlennKesslerWP Escape From Camp 14 was gut wrenching and haunting. Not only does it show the inhumanity of the Kim dictatorship, it shows how even though Shin Dong-hyuk escaped Camp 14 the brutality remains with him.
962830112017203200 2018-02-11 23:26:01 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @stirlospace Yup. Carpe the FUCK out the diem. Never think that there'll always be a chance to do it later. Don't waste money on crap. Collect experiences, not tchotchkes
962829219435724800 2018-02-11 23:22:29 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @stirlospace It occurs to me the Venn diagram of folks who believed the GOP stories about Iraqi centrifuges and yellow cake, and Trump Humpers who fuel the current trend of 'deny the facts at all costs' must look like a full moon.  They're the spouse with a black eye who insists 'He loves me'
962822242412388353 2018-02-11 22:54:45 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @stirlospace Interesting - but the Sept 11 terror attacks were not by sovereign nation.  I would argue, then, that WW3 was started March 20, 2003, when the US invaded Iraq under false pretenses, claiming WMD they knew weren't there & lied about a link between Saddam Hussein and al Queda

962741708592001024 2018-02-11 17:34:44 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @thinkprogress People support Trump because they enjoy this chaos.

959898390946459648 2018-02-03 21:16:25 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @empirestatemind @SaysHummingbird The point of the memo was to give Tea Partiers and Trumpers (but I repeat myself) something to shriek about.

954305800268259328 2018-01-19 10:53:27 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @maggieNYT @chrislhayes @Radioblogger You know what? Don't bother answering. You'll only lie, anyway. There's only 1 answer: The GOP doesn't completely support this bill. Trump, Ryan and McConnell can't sell this bill on its own merits. Enjoy having the blood of CHIP children on your hands, you ghoul.
954305242195148800 2018-01-19 10:51:14 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @maggieNYT @chrislhayes @Radioblogger So, you're lying and saying all of the GOP voted for it's own bill? You're saying all GOP Senators will. Is that what you're saying?
954304773456457728 2018-01-19 10:49:22 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @maggieNYT @chrislhayes @Radioblogger Beyond which, do tell how senior citizens will fare when they can no longer itemize medical bill deductions in 2019 because of TrumpTax? What about the seniors who'll be wiped out?
954304222232690688 2018-01-19 10:47:11 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @maggieNYT @chrislhayes @Radioblogger I am not your Little Lady. Ignoring your obfuscation - Do tell how a party that controls Congress can't pass its own bill? They were able to ram tax breaks for the wealthy down our throats without the Dems. Could it be the GOP is voting against it's own bill? Why, yes - it is!!

954276355075526656 2018-01-19 08:56:27 UTC <ClaudiaLamb> @Reuters No budget in 3 years, and the CR expires in 20 hours. I'm ECSTATIC that Trump's holding a $100K-per-plate campaign fundraiser as CHIP goes unfunded, DACA unaddressed & the govt shutdown looms. Just knowing Trump is FINALLY getting some 'Me' time makes it all worth it.
