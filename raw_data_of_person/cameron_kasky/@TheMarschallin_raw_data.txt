956769655489576961 2018-01-25 06:03:56 UTC <TheMarschallin> @SpeakerRyan And you must be very upset about this, what with your epic plan to kill off the poors and all.
956765282327977984 2018-01-25 05:46:33 UTC <TheMarschallin> This is a joke, right?https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/956724555736866816
956762194045124612 2018-01-25 05:34:17 UTC <TheMarschallin> @fougiefoug God, I hope so!
956748042094354432 2018-01-25 04:38:03 UTC <TheMarschallin> @SenSanders SIT DOWN OLD MAN. Nobody wants an 80 year-old with trash ideas for president, and the short list of candidates already puts you to utter shame. #NeverBernie #AnybodyButBernie2020
956701275332124672 2018-01-25 01:32:13 UTC <TheMarschallin> Republican candidate in MO says women are screaming banshees with heads full of snakes, and he wants your vote. Because its 2018 and this is how far the @GOP has fallen. #resist
956433367141990400 2018-01-24 07:47:39 UTC <TheMarschallin> @BravenakBlog @MattWilly28 No one cares who you voted for, dear. The judge did her job in her own courtroom and I doubt she gives a damn about your opinion.
956430129428746241 2018-01-24 07:34:47 UTC <TheMarschallin> @angela_rye Oh, Jesus. As if things went so well for him last time. 
955985393140228096 2018-01-23 02:07:33 UTC <TheMarschallin> We have a regular customer with a ridiculously thick Southern accent, and I die a little inside every time she orders a glass of mee-oak. #serverproblem #serverlife
955694857724375041 2018-01-22 06:53:04 UTC <TheMarschallin> Dont let people with bad eyebrows tell you shit about your life. But I have really good eyebrows so you should at least hear me out.
955641517477052416 2018-01-22 03:21:07 UTC <TheMarschallin> Dear #Oscars: Dont snub Greta. That is all.
955636693922492416 2018-01-22 03:01:57 UTC <TheMarschallin> @MrDane1982 Jill Stein still has people? 
955626420960616448 2018-01-22 02:21:08 UTC <TheMarschallin> @Phil_Mattingly My homegirl @SenCortezMasto is on point. 
955597449204178944 2018-01-22 00:26:00 UTC <TheMarschallin> Looks like Gen Kelly saved the country again while @realDonaldTrump was busy watching CNN. Is anyone surprised?
955139890907201536 2018-01-21 18:07:50 UTC <TheMarschallin> @BravenakBlog Im not a Bernie-bot BUT...pic.twitter.com/vJAFiMf5Ln

955016347678683136 2018-01-21 09:56:55 UTC <TheMarschallin> @TomiLahren Biiiitch you cant even pay for your own health insurance. How is that being accomplished?
954919820637569024 2018-01-20 03:33:21 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump @ExDemLatina Aw, all two of you against a sea of THOUSANDS. Cute!
954919433159417856 2018-01-20 03:31:49 UTC <TheMarschallin> Its like watching The Truman Show. #PresidentShithole doesnt get that were laughing at him, not with him.https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/954788467069870081
954896262930710533 2018-01-20 01:59:44 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump Your big party was cancelled, the govt shut down due to your inability to lead, and thousands of people marched in protest against you on the anniversary of your inauguration. You must be exhausted from all this #winning!
954893027889233920 2018-01-20 01:46:53 UTC <TheMarschallin> @ask_progressive Ha! Tried that with you people. Youre going to tell me you cant change anything because I need to talk to Jason, my agent. But Jasons contact info leads to a disconnected number and an empty lot.
954846217862709248 2018-01-20 22:40:53 UTC <TheMarschallin> If you oppose #DACA it has nothing to do with your worry over a persons legal status and everything to do with the fact that you just dont want brown people in your vicinity. Own it.
954622027230429185 2018-01-19 07:50:01 UTC <TheMarschallin> Been a customer for 10 years. Clean driving record. Cars paid off. Stable house and employment. Bundled with renters insurance. Rate still goes UP every six months. Cant thank you enough, @Progressive!  #EmeraldStatus
954585933076033536 2018-01-19 05:26:36 UTC <TheMarschallin> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @PressSec You muhfuckers control all three branches of government but are too impotent to prevent a shutdown? How quaint! #TrumpShutdown #GOPshutdown
954149691834249216 2018-01-18 00:33:08 UTC <TheMarschallin> Yes bitch, I KNOW youre lying about your dog being a service animal. No need for the side-eye because I figured out your scam. #serverproblems
954147424536215552 2018-01-18 00:24:07 UTC <TheMarschallin> If @TomiLahren can read all the big words here, it might clear up her utter confusion about how the government works.https://twitter.com/mikel_jollett/status/954106941344661505
953845310333239296 2018-01-17 04:23:38 UTC <TheMarschallin> @Rosie @goldengateblond @magnus22 Lord, please make this happen.
953844842613755904 2018-01-17 04:21:46 UTC <TheMarschallin> @goldengateblond Ben Miles as Pence. I dont care what happens after that.
953842848813629441 2018-01-17 04:13:51 UTC <TheMarschallin> Yo, #GodtheMother people: accosting people in parking lots in the dead of night and standing by their cars until they talk to you is NOT the way to get your message out.
953802392570490880 2018-01-17 01:33:05 UTC <TheMarschallin> @jilevin Yep. Give me a box of crayons and Ill be good to go.
953801897101598720 2018-01-17 01:31:07 UTC <TheMarschallin> In other words, @nytimes is trying exceptionally hard to turn itself into the National Inquirer. Who needs to be a respected publication anyway, amiright?https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/953765337371115521
953755994315636736 2018-01-17 22:28:43 UTC <TheMarschallin> Stop kissing his ass, @JudgeJeanine. Youre fifty years too old to be wife no. 4.https://twitter.com/the_unsilent_/status/953421369093558272
953559584790081536 2018-01-17 09:28:15 UTC <TheMarschallin> Does Jared Kushner remind anyone else of Jean-Ralphio or is it just me?
953508319393595393 2018-01-16 06:04:33 UTC <TheMarschallin> Ive heard @mattgaetzs district in Florida described the same way, tbh. Nice try.https://twitter.com/thehill/status/953477251160596481
953506082038587392 2018-01-16 05:55:39 UTC <TheMarschallin> @SpeakerRyan I bet thats very comforting to the scores of people whove been laid off.
953505639413641216 2018-01-16 05:53:54 UTC <TheMarschallin> @TomiLahren And youre offended by the first amendment. What can ya do?

953159619878113280 2018-01-15 06:58:56 UTC <TheMarschallin> I get positively giddy every time Gregg Popovich goes after Trump. Just... warm and fuzzy.

953109159905435648 2018-01-15 03:38:26 UTC <TheMarschallin> @reesetheone1 Legit thought this was an article from The Onion.
953103803728850944 2018-01-15 03:17:09 UTC <TheMarschallin> Now, remember everyone: peaceful protests are very un-American, but its okay to rip an American flag in half and wear it as a Halloween costume like @TomiLahren did. Dont forget! 
953097949831086080 2018-01-15 02:53:53 UTC <TheMarschallin> @BravenakBlog @The0ther98 Russia has alt-left bots now too? Yeesh.
953090133204414464 2018-01-15 02:22:49 UTC <TheMarschallin> @SpeakerRyan A call youre not answering by robbing Americans blind for your own personal gain and then running home with your tail between your legs. Keep his name out of your mouth. You have nothing in common.

952591485152604160 2018-01-14 17:21:23 UTC <TheMarschallin> @BravenakBlog Its because most of the country voted for her and not Bernie.

940893330401046531 2017-12-13 10:37:05 UTC <TheMarschallin> Cant help but notice that most Bernie Bros are white boys with a penchant for mansplaining, touting all lives matter, and have a lot of student loans. Have several seats, bitches. #NeverBernie #BernieWouldNotHaveWon #NeverSanders

940855040264298497 2017-12-13 08:04:56 UTC <TheMarschallin> @bravenak @fantagor @TheEld2 Is it that difficult for you to connect the dots all by yourself? Twitter isnt conducive to spoon-feeding.
940853065992859649 2017-12-12 07:57:05 UTC <TheMarschallin> @bravenak @fantagor @TheEld2 If you dont know, you havent been paying attention.

940805269323476992 2017-12-12 04:47:10 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump Have you switched from Diet Coke to regular Coke yet? Youre gonna need something stronger to go with your Arbys order.

940584976877199360 2017-12-12 14:11:48 UTC <TheMarschallin> My apartment is undergoing routine inspection this morning, so of course my cat woke up violently ill and destroying the carpet with his vomiting. 
940507352322646016 2017-12-12 09:03:21 UTC <TheMarschallin> I dont know when men growing carpet farms on their chests became sexy, but I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative. Ew.

828132412546748416 2017-02-04 06:45:27 UTC <TheMarschallin> If Trump supporters boycott Budweiser, then what will they do with all their spare time?

826288563700559872 2017-01-30 04:38:39 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump If you think people hate you now, wait until you order the shutdown of #LGBTrights. We will not allow it. #weseeyou
826276440660385793 2017-01-30 03:50:29 UTC <TheMarschallin> Trump is firing anyone who won't go with his illegal EOs! THIS IS NOT NORMAL.#SallyYates
826123305404993537 2017-01-30 17:41:59 UTC <TheMarschallin> @KellyannePolls The job of the #media is to REPORT. Not kiss your ass. Peruse the First Amendment when you have a quick sec.
826118263734226944 2017-01-30 17:21:57 UTC <TheMarschallin> Don't do it, guys. You're doing EXACTLY what he wants you to do. #Calexit

825942920847056896 2017-01-29 05:45:12 UTC <TheMarschallin> And PLEASE #media, take @KeithOlbermann's advice and stop playing chess with Trump. Telling the truth won't kill your ratings, we promise.
825942488133300225 2017-01-29 05:43:29 UTC <TheMarschallin> Keith Olbermann referring to @KellyannePolls as "Kellyanne Con-Job" is the best and most accurate thing I've seen in months.
825616514577473540 2017-01-29 08:08:10 UTC <TheMarschallin> I liked it much better when I used Twitter for fart jokes and not fighting for my rights as an American. This is exhausting.

825600462250446849 2017-01-28 07:04:23 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump We will not let any president, let alone and illegitimate one, destroy this country. Buckle up.
825599865673629697 2017-01-28 07:02:01 UTC <TheMarschallin> @GOP Trump put a white supremacist in the NSC and YOU LET HIM. How dare you say you stand for this country.

824950558595366912 2017-01-27 12:01:54 UTC <TheMarschallin> When the Trump ship goes down, I hope @SpeakerRyan is at the helm. Remember this in 2018, #Wisconsin.

823763082417700864 2017-01-23 05:23:18 UTC <TheMarschallin> "America First" sounds an awful lot like "Deutschland uber alles." It's only slightly terrifying, that's all.

820414224556060672 2017-01-14 23:36:08 UTC <TheMarschallin> Trump wants to build a wall but the cartels have been working through tunnels. How quaint.

727029738741489664 2016-05-01 06:59:31 UTC <TheMarschallin> Christ, what am I doing? I have WORK to do!!!
725271626208538624 2016-04-27 10:33:25 UTC <TheMarschallin> I am Deandra. Deandra is me. #MPGiS
725181870263160832 2016-04-26 04:36:45 UTC <TheMarschallin> Internet, if you think I'm interested in Chris Martin's love life, you are confused.
724871578513727488 2016-04-26 08:03:46 UTC <TheMarschallin> So many people have been accused of being Becky with the good hair that I'm starting to think, shit, maybe it's me. #nevermetJayZ #LEMONADE
723252913884172288 2016-04-21 20:51:46 UTC <TheMarschallin> Prince is dead... Chyna is dead... I shudder to think who's going to be unlucky #3 in this chain.
723251619085750272 2016-04-21 20:46:38 UTC <TheMarschallin> Prince is dead?! What in the actual fuck is happening, universe??? #RIPPrince
722183226274385921 2016-04-18 22:01:13 UTC <TheMarschallin> The new @Starbucks rewards program means I'll have to drink way more coffee. Woe is me! How EVER shall I cope?! #sipsipsip
721949535639969792 2016-04-17 06:32:37 UTC <TheMarschallin> How embarrassing. (The fake accent more than the apology, tbh.) http://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/australia-is-a-wonderful-island#.glQdrvNVK
721792646897795072 2016-04-17 20:09:11 UTC <TheMarschallin> Volcanos are basically Earth's zits, am I right? #tootiredforthis
721789485642440704 2016-04-17 19:56:38 UTC <TheMarschallin> Fetch me all the cheese in the world!
721565612548292608 2016-04-16 05:07:02 UTC <TheMarschallin> Hollywood *tried* to Make ScarJo look more Asian? Fareal? How about you cast an Asian actress in the fucking first place?! #GhostintheShell
714318033381142528 2016-03-27 05:07:45 UTC <TheMarschallin> A server's favorite thing to hear is, "Trust me, I'm really not drunk." #saidnooneever #serverproblems
713954566123888640 2016-03-26 05:03:27 UTC <TheMarschallin> "I didn't ask for it to be THIS slow. I only asked to not have my ass handed to me." #serverproblems #becarefulwhatyouwishfor #slownight
713947759808610304 2016-03-26 04:36:25 UTC <TheMarschallin> Trump won't reveal his plans for America because he wants them to be a "surprise?" And people are going to fucking vote for him?!
713818657424445440 2016-03-26 20:03:24 UTC <TheMarschallin> You're telling me Affleck is gonna play Batman MORE THAN ONCE?! DC, are you TRYING to kill your best hero? #BatmanvSuperman #JusticeLeague
711812959043846144 2016-03-21 07:13:28 UTC <TheMarschallin> A friend just found the "love of her life" twice in two days, so I roared with laughter. #naturalborncynic
711796398182674432 2016-03-20 06:07:40 UTC <TheMarschallin> @gphill60_gary @FoxNews Agreed!
711090815670423552 2016-03-19 07:23:56 UTC <TheMarschallin> #Starbucks is being sued by people who claim their lattes are under-filled. To the plaintiffs I say, don't get your yoga pants in a bunch.
711089196056772608 2016-03-19 07:17:30 UTC <TheMarschallin> Is it just me or is that "Lost Boys" song just trying to give us millennials a whimsical pass for actively avoiding adulthood? #adulting
711057594245193728 2016-03-18 05:11:55 UTC <TheMarschallin> Never thought I'd say this, but well done @FoxNews. You guys standing up for Megyn Kelly against Trump is a beautiful thing.
711040669440155649 2016-03-18 04:04:40 UTC <TheMarschallin> Brain: I hate Hershey's for ruining Cadbury! Gut: Srsly y do u curr? #eastercandy
710694209943023616 2016-03-17 05:07:58 UTC <TheMarschallin> I thought I couldn't dislike #TaylorSwift any more than I already did, but then I dreamt she stole a kitten from me. #nightmare
709254220847775744 2016-03-13 05:45:58 UTC <TheMarschallin> It's busy, you're screwing up, the manager is yelling, and you still think, oh my God, this is SO much better than my last job. #serverlife
706766250425262080 2016-03-07 08:59:39 UTC <TheMarschallin> @Twitter @twitter Man, you really suck at figuring out when your users actually hate someone.
704196666916630528 2016-02-28 06:49:03 UTC <TheMarschallin> Hours later and I'm still walking around my apartment swearing. Academy, y'all piss me off. #Oscars #SlyGotRobbed
704196508124471296 2016-02-28 06:48:25 UTC <TheMarschallin> @NFL That was COLLEGE, booboo. And college is O-V-E-R.
704189477665701888 2016-02-28 06:20:29 UTC <TheMarschallin> YES, the #Oscars need more diversity, but YES, Jada Pinkett Smith acted like an asshole. It's not one or the other, folks. It's BOTH.
704171328685740032 2016-02-28 05:08:22 UTC <TheMarschallin> In order to pay Leo his due, they had to rob Stallone. I see how y'all are. #Oscars
703144666200342528 2016-02-26 09:08:46 UTC <TheMarschallin> @realDonaldTrump You must be so proud! The KKK Just Showed Up At The Nevada Caucus To Support Trump - http://www.occupydemocrats.com/2016/02/24/the-kkk-just-showed-up-at-the-nevada-caucus-to-support-trump/

703134967660871682 2016-02-26 08:30:14 UTC <TheMarschallin> @kanyewest The more you talk about it, the less people believe you. You know that, right?
701660685676118016 2016-02-21 06:51:58 UTC <TheMarschallin> Re-Animator is not a zombie movie. How dare you. #horrormovie
701656825494528001 2016-02-21 06:36:38 UTC <TheMarschallin> There is no better feeling than panicking about not studying and then realizing that you've graduated and you are over that mess. #college
697958630415446017 2016-02-11 01:41:19 UTC <TheMarschallin> Everybody's got #Nickelback in their iTunes library but no one knows how it got there.
697323038606360576 2016-02-09 07:35:42 UTC <TheMarschallin> Pro tip: Buy coconut milk that doesn't have guar gum, and it's likely the cream will already be separated and ready for consumption! #paleo
697075918410375168 2016-02-09 15:13:44 UTC <TheMarschallin> OF COURSE #MickJagger and #DavidBowie had a sexual encounter. Didn't you see the "Dancing in the Streets" video? Are y'all in third grade?
696677670835228672 2016-02-08 12:51:15 UTC <TheMarschallin> Don't you hate watching an opera and knowing you can do better than the broad that's up there? #opera #singerproblems #notfamousyet
696665687415136256 2016-02-08 12:03:37 UTC <TheMarschallin> Fareal tho, who thought Coldplay was important enough to pull off a #HalftimeShow anyway? #SuperBowl
696664194255466496 2016-02-08 11:57:41 UTC <TheMarschallin> Whelp. Never thought I'd root for Miesha Tate, but here we go... #UFC197
695970303063621632 2016-02-06 14:00:25 UTC <TheMarschallin> Your voice teacher gives you pieces that you just hate and you don't know whether to sob or burn the score... #IlTrovatore #singerproblems
695894157529735168 2016-02-06 08:57:50 UTC <TheMarschallin> @espn Ick.
695893253749493761 2016-02-06 08:54:15 UTC <TheMarschallin> Happy Birthday, @axlrose.
694871968546320386 2016-02-03 13:16:02 UTC <TheMarschallin> Spiders have penises?! This is the worst day ever. #daddylonglegs
694075168025481216 2016-02-01 08:29:50 UTC <TheMarschallin> Way to be a professional, @VanessaHudgens. Incredible. #crushedit #GreaseLive
693267601313525760 2016-01-29 03:00:51 UTC <TheMarschallin> @kanyewest Looks like someone's a little butt-hurt... *rimshot* #umadbro
693037610348912640 2016-01-29 11:46:56 UTC <TheMarschallin> Preach it, @WendyWilliams. PREACH. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl09hQwaMAI
692945938294374405 2016-01-28 05:42:40 UTC <TheMarschallin> Aaaaand @DaRealAmberRose wins the entire internet. Excellent.
692558419421728768 2016-01-27 04:02:48 UTC <TheMarschallin> Nothing says "presidential material" like skipping a debate because the moderator hurt your feelings. #DonaldTrump #MegynKelly
691955366414790656 2016-01-26 12:06:29 UTC <TheMarschallin> Oh, how I wish I could have another baby! And by "baby," I absolutely mean cat. Don't get it twisted.
691822093613293568 2016-01-25 03:16:55 UTC <TheMarschallin> Complain about women not getting to be themselves, then pee when Kristen Stewart shares her opinion and it isn't like yours. Mmkay.
691366539077877760 2016-01-24 21:06:42 UTC <TheMarschallin> If a movie's main character is a middle-aged mother, maybe they should cast a middle-aged mother instead of Jennifer Lawrence...
691339625546158080 2016-01-24 19:19:45 UTC <TheMarschallin> Is it appropriate to nap when you've only been awake for like two hours?
691320016080211968 2016-01-24 18:01:50 UTC <TheMarschallin> Apparently I only go places when I have more than an hour to mentally prepare for the journey.
691182270699339776 2016-01-24 08:54:29 UTC <TheMarschallin> It's okay bro, I still love you for that time you showed Iverson what's what. #TyronnLue
691182000439332864 2016-01-24 08:53:25 UTC <TheMarschallin> Mind ya business, @SecureAmerica. I stand with Obama.
691181604031451136 2016-01-24 08:51:50 UTC <TheMarschallin> Okay, my bad for not following basketball, but Tyronn Lue is the new head coach for Cleveland? Wut?
690708844045930496 2016-01-22 01:33:15 UTC <TheMarschallin> Just when I decide to be productive, it rains like hell. Coincidence? I think not.
690027665227694081 2016-01-20 04:26:30 UTC <TheMarschallin> I cracked the headstock on my guitar and my mother's earn at the same time. That's gotta be some sort of record.
689687309009063936 2016-01-19 05:54:02 UTC <TheMarschallin> Human babies will never elicit the amount of joy, love, and excitement that I get from wittle kitties. This is a #fact.
689634048088498176 2016-01-19 02:22:24 UTC <TheMarschallin> Sarah Palin endorses Trump the same day her son goes down for beating his girlfriend. Coincidence? Prolly not.
