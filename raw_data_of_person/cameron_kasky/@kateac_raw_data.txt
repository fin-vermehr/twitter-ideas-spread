963611983307157505 2018-02-13 03:12:54 UTC <kateac> Informative article on SNAP.  No cigs, alcohol, pet food. 44% are kids 12% are elderly.  Maybe tighten up some things, but why overhaul to high sodium, carb laden, sugary canned and processed goods - no fresh veg or fruit?

961072150810513408 2018-02-06 03:00:31 UTC <kateac> @jaketapper Money better spent on actual programs that benefit veterans and military.  IMHO.
961064226851766273 2018-02-06 02:29:02 UTC <kateac> @AC360 Not a joking matter.
961061446535675904 2018-02-06 02:17:59 UTC <kateac> @brianschatz Letters today to my reps.  Instead of parade, boost military pay and create veteran programs.  Seriously.
961040501959835648 2018-02-06 00:54:45 UTC <kateac> @kathrynw5 Jeez, spend that money on actual programs and pay increases!!!  WTH!

961028267036721152 2018-02-06 00:06:08 UTC <kateac> @ASlavitt I wonder how our military folks feel about this?  Money for a big parade, or programs that actually benefit those currently serving and veterans?

Sick.

938925126686527488 2017-12-07 00:16:09 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Great, and as to your "fiscally responsible" comment then can we assume you won't cut taxes for the rich and your corporate friends?  Adding trillions to the deficit is irresponsible.
938872704404307969 2017-12-07 20:47:50 UTC <kateac> @HouseAdmnGOP @SpeakerRyan And the GOP's financial support of Moore?  What about the guy in the WH?  Hypocrites.  No integrity.
938871441969131521 2017-12-07 20:42:49 UTC <kateac> @SenStabenow @SenateGOP It's a tax cut for your donors - the rich and corporate interests. Just be honest.

932688088253394944 2017-11-20 19:12:23 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan We need to have better paying jobs so Cindy makes more than $30,000 a year.  She's going to have to take that $700 and pay a bill.  Sheesh!  Give midd class a real tax cut.

This scam is a shameful tax cut for the wealthy, cuts Medicaid, sabotages the ACA, cuts Medicare, and benefits your rich donors.

913849479953911808 2017-09-29 19:34:29 UTC <kateac> @SenWarren Certainly the tax plan will only help the rich. Stand against it!
913848407780765696 2017-09-29 19:30:13 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan You are giving tax cuts to the rich.

913546137419776000 2017-09-28 23:29:06 UTC <kateac> Yes, painfully true. Our admin handling of this is shamefulhttps://twitter.com/CNN/status/913453719307653120

913544523699146758 2017-09-28 23:22:41 UTC <kateac> @jaketapper Not enough.
913544309818974208 2017-09-28 23:21:50 UTC <kateac> @CNNPolitics Pretty quick to opine on ppl outside of the WH that she thinks should get fired.
913543783484141570 2017-09-28 23:19:45 UTC <kateac> @SenKamalaHarris Why are we always in chaos
913543660196831232 2017-09-28 23:19:16 UTC <kateac> @SenatorTomUdall Hold him to full reimbursement. He should be fired frankly.
913513083011719168 2017-09-28 21:17:45 UTC <kateac> @NBCNews It is inexcusable and shameful.
913510425420902400 2017-09-28 21:07:12 UTC <kateac> @SenKamalaHarris You are awesome.  Absolutely impressive. To have the document with you, oh yeah - fierce!
913509224591667200 2017-09-28 21:02:25 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan You are supposed to be a check and balance.  Not happening.
913508904386011136 2017-09-28 21:01:09 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Again, it's just a tax cut for the rich.  Thanks.  Get back to work to help the middle class, not just your donors.
913508535283048448 2017-09-28 20:59:41 UTC <kateac> @fema @SenCoryGardner And USVI as well.
913508189718450176 2017-09-28 20:58:19 UTC <kateac> @fema @SenCoryGardner Good, because PR has begged for help since the date of the hurricane on 9/20. This Admin has been appallingly indifferent 2 their plight
913506767824232448 2017-09-28 20:52:40 UTC <kateac> @senorrinhatch @GOPSenFinance @SenateGOP Sorry not sorry. Your tax reform is just a big tax cut for the rich.  There is little if any more money in the pocket of the middle class.
913474592664035328 2017-09-28 18:44:49 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan @dbroncos78087 @VladiSays Trickle down now will work?  Huh, history?
913474335712481280 2017-09-28 18:43:47 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan No.  There's little there for the middle class.  You are lying.  The plan gives tax cuts to the rich, that's about it.
913473430007058432 2017-09-28 18:40:11 UTC <kateac> @senrobportman @SenateGOP Tax cuts for rich.  Nothing for middle class. The logic of your "simplification" is not there. Can you guys get anything right?
913464674678587392 2017-09-28 18:05:24 UTC <kateac> @SteveScalise @SenCoryGardner Good to hear he's back. BTW, get to work on PR aid and this tax proposal does not appear to be good for anyone but the rich.  What say you?
913463995260010496 2017-09-28 18:02:42 UTC <kateac> @brianschatz Yes, this is frustrating, appalling. Chaos and PR leaders pleading for help for the PR people. Admin's response so far is unacceptable.
913421492796264449 2017-09-28 15:13:49 UTC <kateac> @DavidBegnaud Where are the coordinators!  @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @jaredpolis
913412790618005504 2017-09-28 14:39:14 UTC <kateac> @realDonaldTrump But no one to get it to the ppl that need it.  Do more and do it now.  Not in a couple of days, not in a week. NOW.

890345104367427584 2017-07-26 22:56:29 UTC <kateac> @JohnCornyn @SenateGOP You guys cannot repeal and replace with something worse than the ACA.

889901784730226688 2017-07-25 17:34:53 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP Hope the Senate GOP will be mindful of the plight, & come up with a truly better plan than ACA,cover preexisting, less deductible, less prem

889667092097581057 2017-07-24 02:02:18 UTC <kateac> @WhiteHouse I hurt for them. If ACA is to be repealed and replaced, the replacement plan needs to actually be BETTER than ACA.  Is that the case - NO.

889504772805410817 2017-07-24 15:17:18 UTC <kateac> @realDonaldTrump If they repeal, they need to replace with something better, not the crap they've come up with.
889501845760032769 2017-07-24 15:05:40 UTC <kateac> @ASlavitt Is there really a choice to make here?  The answer is NO, you rep your constituents.  Period.  Should not even be a discussion!
889298469172596736 2017-07-23 01:37:32 UTC <kateac> @thehill "Obamacare is failing."  He must save us.  The plan will only be $12  per year. Um Hm.
889297601417424897 2017-07-23 01:34:05 UTC <kateac> @JesseFFerguson Then important for us to call our "leaders" to vote NO. Again.

888495474822479872 2017-07-21 20:26:43 UTC <kateac> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec Best wishes Sean Spicer.
888494985921929216 2017-07-21 20:24:46 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP @SenCoryGardner Fix it!!!  No repeal until you come up with a BETTER plan. Get to work!
888494768531132417 2017-07-21 20:23:54 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP Stop these stupid ads!  Your plans  have higher prems, huge deducts for less care. It's got to be a better plan than existing
888435360614596609 2017-07-21 16:27:50 UTC <kateac> @politico Agreed.  The CBO analysts are going to give us the best info possible.  That's what they do.  They are the experts.

888207983401811968 2017-07-20 01:24:20 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP Come up with a plan that is BETTER than the ACA. I.e., that is NOT more expensive, with HUGE deductibles, for LESS care.  Get to work.
888206434839576576 2017-07-20 01:18:10 UTC <kateac> @JesseFFerguson You can't make this crap up.
888206042688966656 2017-07-20 01:16:37 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP Better make sure your plans are better than the ACA.  Not so far.  Get to work and come up with something that costs less for better care.
888122824509898759 2017-07-20 19:45:56 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP Due to your and WH sabotage.  BTW your proposals will cost more for less coverage than the ACA.  You need to do better.
888115531030474754 2017-07-20 19:16:57 UTC <kateac> @thehill No surprise there.
888114655251517440 2017-07-20 19:13:28 UTC <kateac> @ChrisMurphyCT Talk some sense into your colleagues.  What a mess!  A bill that's worse than the ACA cannot go forward.
888114091142692866 2017-07-20 19:11:14 UTC <kateac> @SZilberstein Oh my God.

886278726308184065 2017-07-15 17:38:09 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan It's not better care.  It's no care and you should be ashamed.
886277837627334657 2017-07-15 17:34:37 UTC <kateac> @JesseFFerguson So ahead of the CBO score, they say don't believe it. Because they know it's going to be very bad.Disgusting. This admin has lost all cred.

885521569543364609 2017-07-13 15:29:29 UTC <kateac> @SenateGOP The scary part will continue under the Senate's plan if it passes only it will be even more expensive which is more scary.

881919549662044160 2017-07-03 16:56:20 UTC <kateac> @washingtonpost Well Lord is a CNN guy, so.... according to POTUS it's FAKE.
881918507818012673 2017-07-03 16:52:12 UTC <kateac> @thehill Lots of the rich hob-nobbing in the Hamptons.  That's what they do. We should remember that when we hear divisive comments.

881880523890544640 2017-07-03 14:21:16 UTC <kateac> @thehill The "fake news" is not fake news if it discusses your fake news? Head spin.

881216743602913282 2017-07-01 18:23:38 UTC <kateac> @lrozen Another thing, this is a huge boatload of data. What's his plan for analysis?
881216145646166016 2017-07-01 18:21:15 UTC <kateac> @WSJ @SenateGOP It's not better care. Get a clue.
881214147383275520 2017-07-01 18:13:19 UTC <kateac> @SecPriceMD @SenateGOP Your plans will cost more, for less care. Plus cut Medicaid fromkids and elders but give your donors a big tax cut. Sick.
881212934495420420 2017-07-01 18:08:30 UTC <kateac> @ChrisMurphyCT It is ludicrous.

880474675637178368 2017-06-29 17:14:55 UTC <kateac> @CNN Bully, inappropriate, mean, demeaning, rude,  - and done by our Prez.  That is sad.

880258945675173889 2017-06-28 02:57:41 UTC <kateac> @rgj @SenateGOP Instead of fixing what is wrong with the ACA u & the House come up with an evil plan to give tax cuts to the rich.  Dumb.
880257601132310528 2017-06-28 02:52:21 UTC <kateac> @rgj @SenateGOP Better get busy and drop the GOP lawsuit and make promised payments.  This is a result of your sabotage.
880255868243107840 2017-06-28 02:45:28 UTC <kateac> @business @SenateGOP Because of GOP/WH sabotage.  You own it.

879689633872973824 2017-06-27 13:15:27 UTC <kateac> @ASlavitt If ACA is repealed reps go back to the fed employee plan?  Not the plan they have crafted for us?

878637953144168450 2017-06-24 15:36:26 UTC <kateac> @ASlavitt I understand they want to provide an incentive to keep the insurance current, but what if people just don't have the money....
878432915901751296 2017-06-23 02:01:42 UTC <kateac> @ChrisMurphyCT Huge cuts to Medicaid,  many people are affected in many ways. Including little kids and the elderly.  Blatant lie.

877187721164464128 2017-06-20 15:33:44 UTC <kateac> @SenAlexander @SenateGOP It's your fault so stop complaining and get the Senate proposal out of secret committee.

876210652271960064 2017-06-17 22:51:13 UTC <kateac> @thehill There is a better way.  This is not it.
876197244420018176 2017-06-17 21:57:56 UTC <kateac> Well actually I dont' know it's a shitty thing because we don't know what the eff they are doing but I think it's going to be bad.
876196985153363968 2017-06-17 21:56:54 UTC <kateac> Yes, we do.  We need our leaders to be coming up with a plan to help people, if this beyond shitty thing goes thru.https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/876168223347146753

875760876078235648 2017-06-16 17:03:58 UTC <kateac> @thehill Lots of attorneys involved here.  Just wow.
875737090134163460 2017-06-16 15:29:27 UTC <kateac> @thehill We hold power of the remote. I'm sure there will be something worth more of my time than listening to these two.  Blah Blah Blah.

874741162451640321 2017-06-13 21:31:59 UTC <kateac> @SenKamalaHarris True that.  He tried to expand his wordage  to run out your time.  You scare him lol
874731539753562112 2017-06-13 20:53:45 UTC <kateac> @ACLU Yet he did
874473620235366400 2017-06-12 03:48:52 UTC <kateac> @thehill Someone who thinks Sandy Hook was a hoax, interviewed, on Father's Day. How heartless, no justification of this choice NBC.
874469750172041216 2017-06-12 03:33:29 UTC <kateac> @JohnCornyn @JesseFFerguson WTF.
874449923353096194 2017-06-12 02:14:42 UTC <kateac> @thehill He's an a$$
874449412633776128 2017-06-12 02:12:41 UTC <kateac> @SenateDems Do something please.  This is just evil.
874448902497239040 2017-06-12 02:10:39 UTC <kateac> @ddiamond Committee holding plan under wraps, no public input, does any Senator out of the committee know what the heck is going on w/this?
874326417898577921 2017-06-12 18:03:56 UTC <kateac> @KyleClark Very disappointed in NBC and Megyn Kelly.  On Father's Day no less. Shame, shame, shame on  NBC and Megyn Kelly.
874324215377272832 2017-06-12 17:55:11 UTC <kateac> @DarrellIssa You guys are breaking it! Sabotage at its best.  If you want to replace, you must put forth a plan that is better for the people, not WORSE.

874072919122378752 2017-06-11 01:16:38 UTC <kateac> @denbizjournal This is a silly link to a silly article.  Stay Denver area DBJ.
874064455251800064 2017-06-11 00:43:00 UTC <kateac> @SenateDems Hope the Senate Dems have a strategy!
874061547928043520 2017-06-11 00:31:26 UTC <kateac> @thehill "College material" is a bad way to express it.Encouraging higher education in whatever area a student has interest is important.
874057960246226944 2017-06-11 00:17:11 UTC <kateac> @thehill He either has them, or not.  Just Freaking produce them, or admit they don't exist.
873993189803212800 2017-06-11 19:59:49 UTC <kateac> @thehill Please abolish publishing comments made by Newt Gingrich. No. One. Cares.
873927779766554624 2017-06-11 15:39:54 UTC <kateac> @kylegriffin1 Nor cowardly.
873672460931026944 2017-06-10 22:45:21 UTC <kateac> @POTUS @VP We are concerned you are going to put forth a WORSE plan
873626981341904896 2017-06-10 19:44:38 UTC <kateac> @SecPriceMD The WH and GOP have sabataged the ACA.  You are responsible for Ms. Martin's issue by not fixing problems with it. On You.
873625292799066112 2017-06-10 19:37:55 UTC <kateac> @NormOrnstein @SenCoryGardner   Is this what you are discussing in your secret committee meetings on health care?  Are you really comfortable with this?
873623193394618368 2017-06-10 19:29:35 UTC <kateac> @JohnCornyn actually it's very troubling indeed that you are passing along inaccurate information.
873562958562865156 2017-06-10 15:30:13 UTC <kateac> @thehill Comey is a good man.  Lewandowski....  there's a lot going on there.
873315225667227649 2017-06-09 23:05:49 UTC <kateac> @thehill Whatever he wants to eat, but wait why is anybody asking Newt anything - and he wrote a book?  Def will not be reading it. Ugh.
873269734506196995 2017-06-09 20:05:03 UTC <kateac> @WSJ No way. That's ridiculous
873252363208990720 2017-06-09 18:56:02 UTC <kateac> @thehill Good they should.
873237017080938497 2017-06-09 17:55:03 UTC <kateac> @WSJ Great picture

872998027476123648 2017-06-08 02:05:23 UTC <kateac> @SenAlexander @SenateGOP Yes, caused by your sabatage.  Fix the damn thing.
872952892243582978 2017-06-08 23:06:02 UTC <kateac> @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP We know why the ACA insurers are leaving.  It's because it has being sabataged by GOP and WH.
872952523207745536 2017-06-08 23:04:34 UTC <kateac> @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP What are you doing in your secret health care meetings? Do you know your proposal is so bad that you don't dare share with the public?
872929769322663936 2017-06-08 21:34:09 UTC <kateac> @SenCoryGardner why are your meetings on the health care bill secret? We want to know details!
872928849377587201 2017-06-08 21:30:30 UTC <kateac> @SenCoryGardner please inform your constituents of the status of health care bill. Keeping it secret is wrong on many levelshttps://twitter.com/LynneGuire/status/872918404159688708

872898591571951616 2017-06-08 19:30:16 UTC <kateac> @thehill Yeah, right.
872897881702715393 2017-06-08 19:27:27 UTC <kateac> @NPR Blah Blah Blah.  I believe Comey.
872859193383960576 2017-06-08 16:53:43 UTC <kateac> @NBCNightlyNews Ryan is wrong.  I could add "as usual."
872858719377403905 2017-06-08 16:51:50 UTC <kateac> @thehill Ridiculous.
872858422869278723 2017-06-08 16:50:39 UTC <kateac> @thehill Doesn't matter.  No excuses.
872858186167984128 2017-06-08 16:49:43 UTC <kateac> @KenDilanianNBC rambling waste of precious time.  Expected better from him.

872617178649960448 2017-06-07 00:52:02 UTC <kateac> @DarrellIssa Yup. Good sabatage.
872614010327146498 2017-06-07 00:39:27 UTC <kateac> @SenJohnThune @SenateGOP Foolish. They offered to be involved. Meetings behind closed doors so they (and public) don't have a chance to participate.
872577444280115200 2017-06-07 22:14:09 UTC <kateac> @thehill My assumption (that any POTUS should know when and when not to "kid around") is wrong.  Things learned in grade school.
872542282750214145 2017-06-07 19:54:25 UTC <kateac> @jaketapper Thank you, the free press needs to keep probing and asking questions too!  I appreciate you JT!

872516756648087553 2017-06-07 18:13:00 UTC <kateac> @CBSNews Are we all people now, or is this just the republicans.
872290240664408069 2017-06-06 03:12:54 UTC <kateac> @BraddJaffy Coal cronies  won't like that.
872283405462913025 2017-06-06 02:45:44 UTC <kateac> Fed & Ga min wage is $7.25 x 40 = $290/week.  That's not a livable wage, but hey the trickle down will work right?  Nope. Nope. Nope.https://twitter.com/HuffPost/status/872279182545494017
872282413694566402 2017-06-06 02:41:48 UTC <kateac> @rollcall "Socially conservative policy agenda" = throw a kazillion people who need our help off Medicaid, take their health ins away. Not nice.

870381041533546499 2017-06-01 20:46:25 UTC <kateac> @SenSanders Are his assertions true?  Liability/bad for economy/US sovereignty?  This I see as good for oil gas & coal? Pullout bad for planet.
870271193349095424 2017-06-01 13:29:56 UTC <kateac> @thehill We have gifts, 1 of which is a brain.  Some people use their brains more than others. Lazy way = assume God will fix it so we don't have to.

869695018058960896 2017-05-30 23:20:25 UTC <kateac> @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP Bcuz WH &GOP has done a hell of a job to decimate the ACA.  Sabotage.
869694769634594816 2017-05-30 23:19:25 UTC <kateac> @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP We certainly hope that you are truly coming up with something better, that covers pre-existing affordably and does not leave 23Mil w/o ins.
869676758290780162 2017-05-30 22:07:51 UTC <kateac> @BraddJaffy Hate it when people generalize as all Dems believe this. It's just wrong. He can't see past his own party agenda.
869674557602500608 2017-05-30 21:59:06 UTC <kateac> @BraddJaffy Maybe some people feel that way but tons of people just want the  truth, and want the Russians out of our politics.
869672813816369152 2017-05-30 21:52:11 UTC <kateac> @RoyBlunt @SenateGOP The wh and the gop have sabotaged ACA because, you know, party over the country.

854134511256313858 2017-04-17 00:48:31 UTC <kateac> @KellyannePolls @foxandfriends Dem and GOP Leaders, as well as POTUS should speak out against violence.

849419714753429505 2017-04-04 00:33:36 UTC <kateac> @NYTNational You should lead to fix the ACA for the benefit of those who elected you or come up with a sensible affordable alternative.
849418974362296320 2017-04-04 00:30:39 UTC <kateac> @NYTNational On GOP.  "Uncertain future" is because WH says they'll let it implode.

830970487463301121 2017-02-12 02:42:57 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Your three big tix - taxes, benefit the rich.  Thanks.  ACA repeal, just fix the things that are wrong with ACA. Skeptical
830894465061523456 2017-02-12 21:40:52 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Will though help your rich friends.
830894402809638913 2017-02-12 21:40:37 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Your plan is to  lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.  Skeptical this is going to help middle class.
830826584143638528 2017-02-12 17:11:08 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Your tax plan puts more money in the pockets of the business owner.  It will not trickle down.

830515254308204544 2017-02-11 20:34:01 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Curious why if GOP hates ACA so much you have not already prepared and vetted a draft acceptable replacement.
830494002310811652 2017-02-11 19:09:34 UTC <kateac> @HHSGov @SecPriceMD @SpeakerRyan Do not repeal ACA until you have a new, better plan ready to replace it.
830492004479954947 2017-02-11 19:01:38 UTC <kateac> @realDonaldTrump We have vetting in place.  Improve upon it now instead of inciting fear.
830491829690785792 2017-02-11 19:00:56 UTC <kateac> @SpeakerRyan Do not repeal the ACA until you have a reasonable replacement.  Why not use the basics of ACA and improve upon that instead.
