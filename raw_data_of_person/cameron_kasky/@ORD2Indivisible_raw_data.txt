827053193133633537 2017-02-01 07:17:01 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> City of Talent affirms rights of all citizens, and to protect all, "including but not limited to Muslims, immigrants, and people of color"
827053044231647232 2017-02-01 07:16:26 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> RESOLUTION PASSES.
827052502885371904 2017-02-01 07:14:17 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Mayor Stricker casts tiebreaking vote IN FAVOR
827052405791395840 2017-02-01 07:13:54 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Berlant, Pederson, Wise YES
827052284672499712 2017-02-01 07:13:25 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Collins, Harrison, Baker NO
827052160319762432 2017-02-01 07:12:55 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Roll call vote:
827051957386768384 2017-02-01 07:12:07 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> (At this point, I saw someone across the room clap a police officer on the back, grins shared)
827051716595953665 2017-02-01 07:11:09 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "I know for a *fact* that our police department is up to that."
827051480943206400 2017-02-01 07:10:13 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "When we took their fees, we entered into a covenant to publicly protect them, just as we do businesses, schools, residences, all"
827051247026872320 2017-02-01 07:09:17 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "It's my opinion that if adopted, it would *affirm* the city's policy of safety." "Mosque worked for years, played by the rules."
827050911306440705 2017-02-01 07:07:57 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Mayor Stricker: This is not legislation. "What this resolution strives to achieve is to allow the council to express its opinion."
827039204202786817 2017-02-01 06:21:26 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "It is time for us to say yes to inclusion, and not to hide our prejudice under the guise of tolerance"
827038919074017281 2017-02-01 06:20:18 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "It is time for us to say yes to inclusion and not to hide our prejudice under the guise of tolerance"
827038729776738304 2017-02-01 06:19:33 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "Yes, it specifically calls out for protection of our Muslim residents, but only after affirming the rights of all residents."
827038494614708228 2017-02-01 06:18:37 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "The failure to speak out is what allowed oppression to flourish." "We must speak out to what's in front of us."
827038248891346944 2017-02-01 06:17:38 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Councilor Wise: attempts to engage the nay arguments directly but checked by mayor
827037976479703041 2017-02-01 06:16:33 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Then complains about being labeled a bigot before being checked by the mayor again for being out of order. Can't support the resolution.
827037695486496768 2017-02-01 06:15:26 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Then tells a story I can't follow about daughter and son-in-law (Muslim) who want to hide and feel this resolution endangers them?
827037415898435584 2017-02-01 06:14:20 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Councilor Harrison: "This resolution is singling out one group" Begins chastising attendees, interrupted by Mayor to keep in deliberation.
827036908349829120 2017-02-01 06:12:19 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Which he says singles out one community. Ultimately, this is an "All Lives Matter" argument.
827036713105002497 2017-02-01 06:11:32 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "As I said in my application, all decisions made by the city council must benefit all citizens of Talent" and so he can't support this,
827036298590326784 2017-02-01 06:09:53 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> From genocide of first peoples through acts of violence towards Christian churches today. Ends with note of hostilities towards Latinx.
827035906968162306 2017-02-01 06:08:20 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Councilor Baker: "This country started with European settlers escaping religious persecution" then recites list of various oppressed peoples
827035448149094402 2017-02-01 06:06:31 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> Councilor Collins: could "approve with revisions" but as stands can't support. Doesn't elaborate.
827035206854914048 2017-02-01 06:05:33 UTC <ORD2Indivisible> "This is our community and this is what they're asking us to do."
