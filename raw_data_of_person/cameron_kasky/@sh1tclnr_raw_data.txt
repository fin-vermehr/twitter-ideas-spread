How about we do what we can to ensure peeps like NC cant repeat it? Im against auctioning off police-seized weapons. Id prefer to rid ourselves of the gun show loophole as well

968877433167499267 2018-02-28 15:55:55 UTC <sh1tclnr> @davidhogg111 @andrewhth @steveywonder249 Thats assault rifles. What about handguns? How many die from that?

Other measures can be taken as well. But none of can say it will or wont work. If it was harder for NC to get his hands on an AR, would he have abandoned his plan? Would he have used a Glock 17?

The point is it cant be stopped until we make choices to stop it. do you want our schools to look like military bases?
968872693390020615 2018-02-28 15:37:05 UTC <sh1tclnr> @davidhogg111 @andrewhth @FrankieBoney Thats a false equivalency. But let me go back a second. Are you saying our first amendment rights have never been infringed or are in no way infringed right now?

968871478505680896 2018-02-28 15:32:15 UTC <sh1tclnr> @davidhogg111 @BlueCollarBob30 Then what about movies, books, art, poems, etc. If a person is going to kill theyre going to kill. But how about we dont let them get their hands on something capable of massacring
968870920948502529 2018-02-28 15:30:02 UTC <sh1tclnr> @davidhogg111 @andrewhth @FrankieBoney Refining is not revising. Free speech isnt protected at all times. Gun ownership should have its limits as well. Especially because Ive never accidentally yelled someone to death.
