968716626077077504 2018-02-27 05:16:56 UTC <StacyRyanWrites> @rabiasquared Also, if anyone could make a rib platter called the breath of God, Id totally eat that with a side of sliced white bread and some coleslaw.
968715956569759744 2018-02-27 05:14:16 UTC <StacyRyanWrites> @rabiasquared Actually, does this guy realize the Bible has 2 creation stories? One with a (delicious) rib and one in which man and woman were made at the same time out of dirt and given the breath of life from God. But I believe that is much further into the book, like on page 2.

Both are nuanced & reflect the times of their creation. Both are living docs meant to be debated, to make them modern. They are more than their words.

He has never wanted bipartisanship so may I suggest someplace he can stick his metaphorical olive branch?

938826591035039745 2017-12-07 17:44:36 UTC <StacyRyanWrites> As a birth mom, Id never tell anyone to continue an unwanted pregnancy. The risks- emotional, physical, and financial- are too great to shoulder for some women. And thats okay. Whats not okay is the government deciding that women deserve those burdens.https://twitter.com/jenashleywright/status/938814238050672644
