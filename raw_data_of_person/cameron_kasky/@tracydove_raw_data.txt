That idiot had access to a lot of guns. There are also no excuses for needing to have that kind and amount of arsenal, also, IMHO. These assault rifles need to be banned and other changes need to be made with gun laws.

Its not to say they cant go off script when the opportunity is available. This information does not diminish the severity of the topic of gun control or what has happened.

The implications that these kids/ survivors have done anything wrong is sickening. Ive read some posts from NRA supporters who made wild, illogical accusations about these children. Its gross.

968153418974949377 2018-02-26 15:58:57 UTC <tracydove> @CollinRugg @Mvracing They arent. I feel it is gross to accuse the survivors of ill intent. Mainly because they are children. Money has been raised for the upcoming march. Whats wrong with that? Unlike Trump, who used the photo of a visit with a survivor to pander for his campaign funds.

957648541500911616 2018-01-28 16:16:19 UTC <tracydove> Man, is this ever difficult to do. I am practice keeping the only good memories and discarding the rest.https://twitter.com/dailyzen/status/957419454077554688
957648069234868224 2018-01-28 16:14:26 UTC <tracydove> @LoniLove I need an aunty Loni! 
957647724479852545 2018-01-28 16:13:04 UTC <tracydove> @jeffpevar @boutwillismusic @thedavidcrosby @Dane_27 We will never forget
957647289090109440 2018-01-28 16:11:20 UTC <tracydove> @IyanlaVanzant My new practice is to keep the good memories and discard the rest. Only moving towards and leaning into what feels good.
957643463322841088 2018-01-28 15:56:08 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Oh, yes, you are just so wonderful with wonderful ideas. Nobody has been or will ever be as wonderful as you. Oh wonderful one. What did we ever do to deserve such a wonderful wonder as yourself? You are a stable genius living in your own special wonderland.
957642728640139264 2018-01-28 15:53:13 UTC <tracydove> @lisarinna YES! 
957642278184435712 2018-01-28 15:51:25 UTC <tracydove> @ShannonBeador Dayum! You are gorgeous even when you feel like death warmed over! Sending healing vibes, mama 
957641810729250816 2018-01-28 15:49:34 UTC <tracydove> @MeghanKEdmonds Shes beautiful with a bright future! Keep on rocking the attitude, Aspen!!!! Cute as can be... that one! 
957641351058739200 2018-01-28 15:47:44 UTC <tracydove> @lisarinna Gorgeous woman with a gorgeous husband and two gorgeous daughters. Not to mention, Rinas fabulously large personality and hilarious sense of humor. 
957639198021832704 2018-01-28 15:39:11 UTC <tracydove> @tabathacoffey @lisarinna @Andy @BravoWWHL @buffpuff5 You are seriously going to trash talk on another womans appearance? In this climate that we are living in, women need to empower each other, not pull teach other down. I hope you can find another way to raise your own self esteem than this. Rinna is powerfully beautiful.
957638039055953921 2018-01-28 15:34:35 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Certainly NOT because of you! All thanks to Obama. Obama was a TRUE president and leader. Something you will never be. The bar was raised too high for you. Give it up, dude.
957071012171935744 2018-01-26 02:01:25 UTC <tracydove> @LoniLove Too funny
956708517225771008 2018-01-25 02:00:59 UTC <tracydove> @TayeDiggs @erikajayne Erika Jayne will steal the show, fierce goddess that she is. Cant wait to watch it tonight.
956707918719500289 2018-01-25 01:58:37 UTC <tracydove> @ShannonBeador Healing vibes for Sweet Adeline  Feel better, precious girl.
956571902784319490 2018-01-25 16:58:08 UTC <tracydove> @erikajayne @lsb The High Priestess! 
956570797476265984 2018-01-25 16:53:45 UTC <tracydove> @lisarinna You are beautiful regardless of your hair. I love the short hair that we all are used to seeing, also. Are you letting fucking Brandis shitty comment change you? Please dont change for anyone. Youre beautiful, dawling!Stay true to you no matter what you do!
956459429276278785 2018-01-25 09:31:12 UTC <tracydove> @LupusResearch @ladygaga So beautifully moving 
956459039570804736 2018-01-25 09:29:39 UTC <tracydove> @PatriciaHeaton Ruh roh! No bueno. Feel better SOON!
956458755423535106 2018-01-25 09:28:32 UTC <tracydove> @xtina @erikajayne Could you be more badass?! Dayum, Girl! You give me life! 
956457621568958466 2018-01-25 09:24:01 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Every time you leave the country you make America great again!
955971426451795968 2018-01-23 01:12:03 UTC <tracydove> @CNN Good God, things get more and more insane everyday. This clown has got to be removed. Evangelicals are out of touch with reality. Theyve got their own twists and turns going on. Bizarre.
955969255001833472 2018-01-23 01:03:26 UTC <tracydove> @MeghanKEdmonds @Andy @californguy Oh, man. Meghan was the classiest one on there. Vicki is annoying as hell along with Peggy and Lydia. All three of them are hard to watch. Good to see Shannon and Tamara are still on.
955921070459994112 2018-01-23 21:51:58 UTC <tracydove> @Astro_ALXNDR Of course, there are no rules. I agree. Just saying she couldve been more professional. Just my opinion.
955915611690815489 2018-01-23 21:30:16 UTC <tracydove> @TheMiddle_ABC I live for The Middle! I want it to go on forever!  Sue is a breath of fresh air.
955915205971623937 2018-01-23 21:28:39 UTC <tracydove> @IyanlaVanzant Practice makes perfect
955914788927807488 2018-01-23 21:27:00 UTC <tracydove> @Astro_ALXNDR A skilled psychic wouldve handled the situation much differently. Then again, we only see an edited version of the entire meeting.
955914270427955200 2018-01-23 21:24:56 UTC <tracydove> @Astro_ALXNDR Yes. I think they are both full of shit! LOL! That we may agree on. Im certainly not defending Kim. However, that psychic did not display good intentions. Kim was so rude and combative. She shouldve been there to begin with if she felt that way.
955896139370307584 2018-01-23 20:12:53 UTC <tracydove> @Astro_ALXNDR That Miss Chleo chick was full of shit. That is not how its done. Kim was right about this one.
955867447331979264 2018-01-23 18:18:53 UTC <tracydove> @paramountnet @erikajayne You are so fucking amazing!
955866994317774848 2018-01-23 18:17:05 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Why do you have to call people names ALL THE TIME? You are so disrespectful to anyone who you dont agree with. You are so disgusting.
955622499802386433 2018-01-22 02:05:33 UTC <tracydove> Good advice. I learned the art of non attachment many years ago. Its best not to allow others get into your head.https://fb.me/UqXjhE2f
955193591797723136 2018-01-21 21:41:13 UTC <tracydove> @aTouchof_Rai @EW @TameraMowryTwo You are a breath of fresh air, my dear.

954687033200361472 2018-01-20 12:08:20 UTC <tracydove> @erikajayne Most of those theories are out of this world. (see what I did there?!) Seriously though, there are some stories that makes one wonder. Im inclined to believe that there is life beyond whats on planet Earth. Its a fascinating topic.
954685175790645253 2018-01-20 12:00:57 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=742962129227689&id=153418591515382
954397675838889984 2018-01-19 16:58:32 UTC <tracydove> @donnagrace She is full of herself and seems to have a problem being accountable for anything. Drunk Dorit shows her true self. Trash talker. She needs a team to make her look good on the outside to distract from who she is inside. We can still see the truth through her hair and makeup.
954393358633336834 2018-01-19 16:41:23 UTC <tracydove> @LoniLove You heal me. Your words and attitude and sensibilities are SO VERY appreciated. Much love, Loni. 
954392868453416960 2018-01-19 16:39:26 UTC <tracydove> @PhilRosenthal @PatriciaHeaton @decider We watch reruns every night. Much of the dialogue has found its way into our daily lives  when we made lemon chicken two nights ago, the whole family said, I could eat this for the rest of my life! LOL
954015255495041025 2018-01-18 15:38:56 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump You actually have respect? Stop with the fake news crap already. Even fake news has more credibility than you do.
954013134057951232 2018-01-18 15:30:30 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump You do know tunnels are not uncommon. Hire more border patrol and create more jobs. The wall is a waste of focus and money. We have bigger fish to fry right now.
954011839041495040 2018-01-18 15:25:21 UTC <tracydove> @TheRealDaytime That shows a lack of mindful parenting skills. It can be very dangerous,as well as, damaging to children who are at an age of awareness~photos shared privately with family and friends on occasion is fine. We are the keepers of our childrens safety. Stay mindful.
954008003228811264 2018-01-18 15:10:07 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump @IRdotnet @EdKrassen There are some elaborate tunnel diggers south of the border.
953644502748573696 2018-01-17 15:05:41 UTC <tracydove> @LisaVanderpump Always watching. You must hear it all the tim- but, you are a beautiful, high Priestess  much admiration and love for you and to you 
953299221544710144 2018-01-16 16:13:40 UTC <tracydove> @cher If you have to say it/ claim it~ it most likely is not true. I can say my eyes are blue and it does not make it true.
953296866585624576 2018-01-16 16:04:19 UTC <tracydove> @GeorgeTakei If you have to say it and claim it (repeatedly), most likely it isnt true.
953295977569386496 2018-01-16 16:00:47 UTC <tracydove> @IyanlaVanzant Unanswered prayers are blessings, too. Ive heard it said that Source (God) is not deaf, we dont need to keep praying for the same things over and over again. But, I understand what you are saying.
953294888690266112 2018-01-16 15:56:27 UTC <tracydove> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You are delusional
953273114602848258 2018-01-16 14:29:56 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump SHUT IT DOWN!
953272399339769856 2018-01-16 14:27:05 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Please resign before it gets worse for us and certainly for you

952550365630623744 2018-01-14 14:37:59 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Is it all about kudos and credits for you? Its not about YOU, Donny! You represent US.
951500926157692928 2018-01-11 17:07:53 UTC <tracydove> @IyanlaVanzant That can be a long process for a lot of folks. Our egos do not want to be diminished in any way and may even kick and scream. Nonetheless, how beautiful it is on the other side of ego! Thank you for your wisdom, experiences, compassion and love.
951134397821931520 2018-01-10 16:51:26 UTC <tracydove> @TheRealDaytime Not interested anymore. Especially after hearing that Katy Perry will be making 25 million to sit on the judges panel. The bad auditions were the most entertaining part of the show.
950770335011389440 2018-01-09 16:44:46 UTC <tracydove> @CNN Oh, crap. Thats just what we dont need.
950758049207042048 2018-01-09 15:55:57 UTC <tracydove> @TheRealDaytime Oh, come on, now! Who doesnt know how wrong this is. Im no stable genius but, this crosses several lines. Not cool at all. Two steps forward~one step backwards.
950756187120660480 2018-01-09 15:48:33 UTC <tracydove> @Oprah @AsaSoltan Michelle Obama for Vice President! Oh, what a joyful notion!

950579702019768320 2018-01-08 04:07:16 UTC <tracydove> @AsaSoltan Unfortunately, there are people who refuse to hear, see or feel other individuals who do not believe what they believe.A belief is only an idea that has hardened. Weve had enough division on our planet. Its time we all soften our hearts and minds and unify.

950357375625515011 2018-01-08 13:23:49 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Its not all about you.
950357073153343489 2018-01-08 13:22:37 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump We are facing far larger problems than this ridiculous, constant bashing of the press. You must broaden your, like, really genius mind and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense. A stable genius would know how to differentiate between what is important and what is not.

949285669200736257 2018-01-05 14:25:15 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump Everything is fake or phony, according to you. Name calling when things dont go your way is not presidential behavior.

949282856194342912 2018-01-05 14:14:04 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump We need to build a wall around you and your cronies.
948986290288050176 2018-01-04 18:35:37 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump I am not happy that you are taking actions that are putting our lives at risk. You need to stop. Apparently, you have nothing to lose.

947506847006695424 2017-12-31 16:36:50 UTC <tracydove> @realDonaldTrump This way you can continue to tweet about and live in your own delusional world. FAKE PRESIDENT-FAKE REALITY.
