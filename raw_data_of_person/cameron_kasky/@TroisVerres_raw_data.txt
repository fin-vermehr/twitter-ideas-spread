971412791734292480 2018-03-07 15:50:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @jvn @HarrietEvans @saramaetuson Game of Thrones plus Jonathan?! Jeez, I haven't truly been ALIVE until this moment, thank you!
971412294105120768 2018-03-07 15:48:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @veronica_henry ahahaha, the useless but beautiful food guy is so sweet (and useless).
971412091541295104 2018-03-07 15:47:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans oh bez, isn't it just the most joyous thing to watch? every now & then I get tearful just remembering moments (like sobbing boy with his lovely stepmum, waaaah)
970948071029985280 2018-03-06 09:03:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bethan_Kate True, very true.
970678367723847680 2018-03-05 15:12:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @ClareSmith16 oh boo, sorry, how grim. get well soon, please!
970677804210819072 2018-03-05 15:09:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @ClareSmith16 WHAT?! what are you?
970628425680605184 2018-03-05 11:53:44 UTC <TroisVerres> Just accidentally texted the poop emoji to a really nice & helpful customer service person & now I must leap out of this third floor window. 
970598681622863872 2018-03-05 09:55:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @mariannevelmans ooh, now THAT is a desk drop to gladden the heart. Would you believe I've never read a Reacher, and have always felt that needed correcting. Lee C was SO delightful at conference, too. Thanks for the book! x
970048323238416384 2018-03-03 21:28:37 UTC <TroisVerres> Love this.https://twitter.com/AndrewBloch/status/969885891773779969

969837727209414656 2018-03-02 07:31:47 UTC <TroisVerres> Thank you to everyone on Twitter whose boiler broke yesterday, so I knew what to do this morning when mine did too (Pour a kettle of boiling water over the frozen condensation pipe outside - you're welcome). I feel SO CAPABLE (also so effing cold).
969214320650448897 2018-03-01 14:14:35 UTC <TroisVerres> So the lovely @maitlis is the host of #PenguinVoices & all I can think of is the Albanian general-on-a-bike who blowdries her hair 3 times a week. #Fortunately
968788214319329280 2018-02-28 10:01:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @jaysambart goodness, that's big news! Congratulations to you!
968603543937736704 2018-02-27 21:47:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @MsTamarCohen hahahaaa, I guess it is worth waiting for? but so far just confirms all I feel about the whole series just being a bit too pleased with itself.
968601449797181443 2018-02-27 21:39:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @MsTamarCohen oh, this makes me feel normal in a world of TGP fans, thank you! I keep trying (and then switching over to Queer Eye). also already know The Big Twist so that doesn't help...
968588288629108737 2018-02-27 20:46:58 UTC <TroisVerres> @charlottebush2 wtf nooooooooooooooo!
968467840557879296 2018-02-27 12:48:21 UTC <TroisVerres> It's Tuesday & I'm still laughing at Saturday night's Freddie Mercury impersonator, who stopped mid-performance to give out the details of his Tinder profile. #dontstophimnow #thesearethedaysofourlives
966753703385591808 2018-02-22 19:16:58 UTC <TroisVerres> Oh Goop, sliding into my inbox the week before payday with your $13,000 handbag recommendations. #bitchplease
966662151309021184 2018-02-22 13:13:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans haha! I have to not think of that play too much or I can truly give myself nightmares. x
966661328881573888 2018-02-22 13:09:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietLane_ I mean. Did you just settle yourself down for some mildly weird roommate stories? ME TOO.
966650404443447296 2018-02-22 12:26:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning and if you put this in a novel, an editor would tell you tone it down.
966650281676165120 2018-02-22 12:26:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I thought the cat litter was bad enough, but the GUN, the STABBING, his BROTHER. Jeepers.
966646760595709952 2018-02-22 12:12:01 UTC <TroisVerres> What the, what the, WHAT the???! Every time you think this story can't get weirder and more horrifiying, it does. *locks all doors*https://twitter.com/NYMag/status/966308375079346177
966637191354085377 2018-02-22 11:34:00 UTC <TroisVerres> @BelgianWaffling So happy to see he's out & about. Please give him a gentle squeeze from me. x
966616380148715520 2018-02-22 10:11:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @RuthT1987 V good point. I'd prefer the dog vom.
966612289947422720 2018-02-22 09:55:03 UTC <TroisVerres> A day that begins with clearing up dog vom from the kitchen floor can only improve, right? Right???
966315776755019776 2018-02-21 14:16:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @SarahGPerry @mutablejoe TELLLLL HIMMMMMM.
966075122191929345 2018-02-20 22:20:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @MarianKeyes I just saw this & it has entirely destroyed my heretofore amazing Trish McEvoy tubing mascara (to be fair nothing could have withstood the sobbing deluge). Wasn't it marvellous?
965967626190118918 2018-02-20 15:13:23 UTC <TroisVerres> Sometimes you read the bestseller lists without due care & attention and find yourself wondering what The Last Tudor Fat Loss Plan might be. #lasttudorfatlossplan #bithungrynow
965953277711077377 2018-02-20 14:16:22 UTC <TroisVerres> @MauraRedPR She is so dreamy. I've heard this look described as how a dog hugs you with their eyes. Muh.
965472656249311232 2018-02-18 06:26:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @NichollsJulia Crawling. Thank you so much. 
965321259205713922 2018-02-18 20:24:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bethan_Kate We can compare aching biceps tomorrow (if I have the strength to fasten my bra & therefore make it to work).
965319022727266305 2018-02-18 20:16:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bethan_Kate Never. I am sticking with the Dulwich Mums who at least are in the same age bracket as me!
965287754040004608 2018-02-18 18:11:49 UTC <TroisVerres> It's been three hours since I left my first boxing class & already I can't get off the sofa without making a shaming 'oof'. #ow
964235900791263234 2018-02-15 20:32:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @ConservativeTht What a crock.
964227351172276224 2018-02-15 19:58:09 UTC <TroisVerres> She sure is. *takes Venetia off the bookshelf for 147th time*https://twitter.com/joannechocolat/status/964207007132717056
964226143829348352 2018-02-15 19:53:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @BetteMidler I love you, Ms Midler. 
964125845815164928 2018-02-15 13:14:48 UTC <TroisVerres> I bloody love the Fortunately podcast & @urchinette has written this great piece for @thepooluk on why it is so refreshing and brilliant: https://www.the-pool.com/people/women-we-love/2018/7/Jane-Garvey-and-Fi-Glover-on-the-Fortunately-podcast (in which I am quoted as mad fangirl).
964123362460041216 2018-02-15 13:04:56 UTC <TroisVerres> @fifiglover @janegarvey1 @urchinette Your piece ran at last! And is so brilliant & affectionate, just like Fortunately (no higher praise).
964100139525771264 2018-02-15 11:32:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris STOP DISTRACTING ME WITH GREAT IDEAS.
964098424806301696 2018-02-15 11:25:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris @keris I have a LOT to do today, and now all I'm thinking about is RuPaul on the next series of Grace & Frankie & it's all your fault. x

963754347220946944 2018-02-14 12:38:36 UTC <TroisVerres> I love this half-term Instagram row between two kids I babysit (aged 9 & 12):  glitter__pugIf I was a Barbie  I would look like this  with makeup . bacon.copter Cool. I guess?  glitter__pug EVE WE MADE IT TOGETHER SO I DONT KNOW WHY YOUR SAYING THAT!!!!
963740040328306688 2018-02-14 11:41:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @Fig_Tree_Books is it because he wasn't given the status of King, is it is it is it?
963710915932770304 2018-02-14 09:46:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @Fig_Tree_Books @HarrietEvans but he has refused to be buried next to her, fact fans.
963710838849835008 2018-02-14 09:45:43 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans But have you ever seen either of them in Boots, hmm?
963710701503119360 2018-02-14 09:45:10 UTC <TroisVerres> Such a great initiative.https://twitter.com/salihughes/status/963680605308424193

961631597622710272 2018-02-08 16:03:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @ClareSmith16 when you are done we must lunch, it's been ages. x

961543256453664768 2018-02-08 10:12:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusieSteiner1 Realising as I type this that the answer is, as it should be, JUDY BLUME. Thank you for helping me get there! x
961542878412582912 2018-02-08 10:11:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusieSteiner1 Hmm, I love Pullman, tho my goddaughter is in quite a 'boys/parties/lipgloss' phase and I'm wondering if she's going to want something more 'teen'?
961539702271696896 2018-02-08 09:58:24 UTC <TroisVerres> Searching for 'best books for 11 year olds' I'm recommended All the Light We Cannot See. Which is an excellent book, no question, but for an eleven year old? Jeez, no.
960836197672280065 2018-02-06 11:22:55 UTC <TroisVerres> I got distracted by the dog while doing my make up this morning & have only just realised, at 11.22, that I have come to work with a half-finished face. #lookinggood #wherearemyeyes
960828428609089536 2018-02-06 10:52:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @miashby wowsers, those are quite some sales for Eleanor O this week! And thoroughly deserved too - congratulations!

959834579686363136 2018-02-03 17:02:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @Hemmo thank you so much, Alex, for kind words in The Pool on Self-Care for the Real World!

958665299351556097 2018-01-31 11:36:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @NursepollyRgn So much to bear as a fifteen year old, thank you for sharing this story.

958627990488875008 2018-01-31 09:08:18 UTC <TroisVerres> If I may show off for a moment, the true triumph of publishing Self-Care for the Real World isn't the ace sales/publicity etc, but the fact that if you type 'self' into the search bar on Amazon, the book comes up as the second most common search after 'selfie stick'. I mean.
958615710766333952 2018-01-31 08:19:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg Oh congratulations to you! This is lovely news (not being designated editor, but the REST). Xx
958445215429332992 2018-01-30 21:02:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @Hoppo999 The only acceptable usage. I concur.

958312298422169601 2018-01-30 12:13:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusannahOtter in the post! The last page made me actually sob out loud.
958306836884713473 2018-01-30 11:52:09 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusannahOtter shall I whiz one your way? best at work address? finished copies just in & I am fully evangelical about spreading the word...
958283523282079749 2018-01-30 10:19:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @Hoppo999 ME TOO. It's part of the same mistakenly formal universe in which people say 'yourself' instead of 'you' eg 'And the salmon is for yourself?' GAH.
958283221636132864 2018-01-30 10:18:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg Oh I'm always a fan of the lunchtime do - can't always make it on work hours! Hope they swish you up nice. x

957949390127337473 2018-01-29 12:11:47 UTC <TroisVerres> As the whole world seems to now say 'on annual leave' instead of 'on holiday', I'm going to take it one step further & from henceforth will be 'on furlough'. #itspublishingnotthemilitary

First time this happened I was eleven. Happened this morning, at forty-four. Decades of this shit really grind you down. #everydaysexism
956789446690660353 2018-01-25 07:22:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @Thors11 I read the book so slowly as found it such an intense read. Shes the most extraordinary writer, isnt she?

955925903225303042 2018-01-23 22:11:10 UTC <TroisVerres> @MarianKeyes Sorry youre feeling so rotten. Rachels Holiday (which Ive read approx 254 times) has so often been the book that gets me out of a slump. Whats yours?
955728447715860480 2018-01-23 09:06:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @BBCr4today @TheMichaelMoran I've entirely stopped listening tbh.

954352049109520384 2018-01-19 13:57:14 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans your post only misses the classic line 'if it ain't Regency, I ain't interested', which I have disregarded at my peril. FULL AGREEMENT on these.

951901911397158912 2018-01-12 19:41:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell Oh well now I'm very suspicious
951901172629229569 2018-01-12 19:38:19 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell Haha, did you really?! Pom juice is the devil, had hoped this technique was going to save my kitchen from the murder-scene vibe.

949175683531583488 2018-01-04 07:08:12 UTC <TroisVerres> Nothing makes me more anxious for the publishing industry than threads about a book (today it's Fire & Fury) where countless people ask 'where/how can I get this?!' You've really never heard of a bookstore? Or Amazon?

942762784810524674 2017-12-18 14:25:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans I spose it's kiiiiiiiiind of like buttered rum, just in slightly different proportions?
942754324509315075 2017-12-18 13:52:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @rebeccafolland No, but am seriously considering going out to buy one. Maybe sequinned, for a festive vibe.
942752696049831936 2017-12-18 13:45:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans I swear no booze involved. Just advanced age. Ow.
942751377629106176 2017-12-18 13:40:18 UTC <TroisVerres> Me, 9am Sunday morning: check out my fancy yoga head stands, everyone! Who'd guess I'm forty-four?! Me, 9am Monday morning:pic.twitter.com/zeAQwOUFlD
942737261946458112 2017-12-18 12:44:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @SophieBrewer Ugh, it's so vexing and rude.
942730625198510080 2017-12-18 12:17:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @BretsTypewriter Chiropractor says ice is the only solution (and several more expensive visits to his offices, obviously)!
942729479956434944 2017-12-18 12:13:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @immmy @suladoyle As the child of a military person I do not AT ALL understand why people adopt this language. Leave is from your military posting, not your cushy publishing job. Chuh.
942716300547231744 2017-12-18 11:20:55 UTC <TroisVerres> I have a frozen neck (ow) and it's really interfering with my ability to glare disapproval at people playing music out loud on the bus. #cantturnmyhead
942293312265957376 2017-12-16 07:20:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell Oh no Jill, how horrible. You poor thing. Hope they can do something for the pain. 
941342787638788096 2017-12-14 16:23:04 UTC <TroisVerres> AND NOW A RICHARD AND JUDY BOOKCLUB PICK. Sorry, bit excited. @lisajewellukhttps://twitter.com/KirstyBooks/status/931620344393273344
941331640499998720 2017-12-14 15:38:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @TheCut @suladoyle this has just made me properly guffaw at my desk.
940664996308058112 2017-12-12 19:29:46 UTC <TroisVerres> My fave festive story is the time my mum, in somewhat I-am-a-gracious-Lady-Bountiful fashion, invited our local tramp for Xmas lunch & (the best bit) he politely declined.
940631094893928448 2017-12-12 17:15:03 UTC <TroisVerres> For a lovely festive weep, here's a true Christmas story by @tayari about (queen of all our hearts) @judyblumehttps://twitter.com/AlgonquinBooks/status/940392032262066176
940625936839569408 2017-12-12 16:54:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor @lucyinglis Sodapop! And wee Tom Cruise with his original teeth.
940540905433464832 2017-12-12 11:16:40 UTC <TroisVerres> I love Griefcast so much & this is a belter. Especially the round face.https://twitter.com/thegriefcast/status/937694938481020928
940332943750455296 2017-12-11 21:30:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusieSteiner1 Friend's dog once approached MM in the street & she said, apropos of 0, 'do you think it can smell my c*nt?' It's like posh lady Tourette's.
940320382095159296 2017-12-11 20:40:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg That ice cream tho. *drowns in pool of own drool*
940319107571965952 2017-12-11 20:35:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg Also there was a fake raising of the martini to a non-existent person. Nige, you're better than that.
940318838469611525 2017-12-11 20:34:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg The suitcase was particularly poor. And I heart a fairy light (and Nigella) but steady on set decorators, this is entering crazy hoarding territory.
940312572468846592 2017-12-11 20:09:22 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg 'What a journey!' (to arrive at home).
940233899967381505 2017-12-11 14:56:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @MauraRedPR YESSSS! x
940232667722911744 2017-12-11 14:51:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @MauraRedPR Maurz, as ever, yours is the best take. xx
940195462698717184 2017-12-11 12:24:00 UTC <TroisVerres> @ninastibbe Isn't it repellent? Only read the story an hour ago as had been too put off for that very reason (now obvs think it was a good choice).
939921459547426816 2017-12-10 18:15:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @missellabell I got some Timberland ones a few years ago that are still going strong - not their lace up style, but knee high leather with zip. Sooo comfortable, too.
939584499431694336 2017-12-09 19:56:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris You would, wouldn't you? Poor old CeCe Penis.
939583608200851460 2017-12-09 19:52:43 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris Still remember walking into Our Price to find someone had arranged all her albums to read CeCe Penis.
939480407225053184 2017-12-09 13:02:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @jackjewers That is a good story, well done that nurse. Hopefully Hunt will be off to his obscene private sector healthcare job soon.
939480109635039233 2017-12-09 13:01:27 UTC <TroisVerres> @jackjewers Also depressing to be surrounded by people who still vote for him. 
939478749476728832 2017-12-09 12:56:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @jackjewers Is he really your MP? That must be colossally depressing, sympathies!
939477150104735744 2017-12-09 12:49:41 UTC <TroisVerres> Spoiler. Jeremy Hunt remains a total bellend.https://twitter.com/francescamain/status/939424556363730945
939254989729431552 2017-12-08 22:06:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Oh my gad yes. Every bloody time 
939240673471066113 2017-12-08 21:10:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor Oh god. 
938707121851559936 2017-12-07 09:49:52 UTC <TroisVerres> @VexSlain thinking of you at this difficult time.
938703150176964608 2017-12-07 09:34:05 UTC <TroisVerres> oh this man! this bunny. SOB.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/938657291049623554
938702856303054848 2017-12-07 09:32:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning She is the picture of contentment. Sweet dreams, Miss B.
938468354565836801 2017-12-06 18:01:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @najmafinlay @SarahEFranklin It is one of those books that's a joy to pass on because you KNOW this will be the reaction!!
938339551327805441 2017-12-06 09:29:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @charlottebush2 I'll bring him over the next time he wakes up in the small hours. I'm so tiiiiiiiired.
938337700243017728 2017-12-06 09:21:55 UTC <TroisVerres> My dog woke me at 2.30am for no reason other than to get his tummy tickled. He is cute, but not cute enough to get away with this behaviour.
938144801223933952 2017-12-05 20:35:25 UTC <TroisVerres> @virginmedia nope. and won't again, I'm afraid.
938138730313011202 2017-12-05 20:11:17 UTC <TroisVerres> Switch your broadband, they said! You'll save so much money! And now, between them @bt_uk and @virginmedia have left me without broadband or a landline. THANKS, GUYS. Saving money by having no service feels amazing.
937689540919218177 2017-12-04 14:26:22 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg oh this I LIKE. nice.
937688221735059457 2017-12-04 14:21:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg can kind of see a Flump horn being a possibility? or will you personally spin it out of sugar as any devoted mother surely would?
937682237058895873 2017-12-04 13:57:21 UTC <TroisVerres> All I want for Christmas is for Brock Turner to have a Damascene conversion where he truly understands what he did & makes amends forever. Thanks, Santa.
937361395280203778 2017-12-03 16:42:26 UTC <TroisVerres> It might be Bill's supper time, but how would I know for sure? If only he had some way of https://www.instagram.com/p/BcP0d4EFX1I/
936921600787488768 2017-12-02 11:34:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @MarinaOLoughlin have you seen the http://www.choose.love store where you can buy basic goods for refugees? they have shop in Soho too - super simple & effective idea. open till Dec 24th,
936675450771841025 2017-12-01 19:16:44 UTC <TroisVerres> Paid a visit today to the @helprefugeesuk shop in Brewer Street & got some presents for people https://www.instagram.com/p/BcK8aY_FKw_/
936673000673464321 2017-12-01 19:07:00 UTC <TroisVerres> @harrietbourton have you seen Hunt for the Wilderpeople? On Netflix, and just a total joy.
936323870935650305 2017-11-30 19:59:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @missellabell oh this is hard enough to read, cannot imagine how hard it must be to be in it. and to manage to write so beautifully from the middle of it. much love to you & to John. x
936316875620929536 2017-11-30 19:31:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette my niece has already told me to bring tissues (after seeing Inside Out with me & finding my sobs hilarious).
936273858885292032 2017-11-30 16:40:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @AramintaHall it feels almost medicinal at this point in the week/news cycle.
936258247710924802 2017-11-30 15:38:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @agladman ah, can't wait!
936257020407279616 2017-11-30 15:34:03 UTC <TroisVerres> I'm going to see Paddington 2 with two nine year olds at the weekend & I can't think when I last so much looked forward to a Saturday night out.
936189727383965701 2017-11-30 11:06:39 UTC <TroisVerres> @KeshiniNaidoo *waves at you from Hill Slither/Sliver*
936188761154768896 2017-11-30 11:02:48 UTC <TroisVerres> @KeshiniNaidoo YES. Fight the good fight.
936163493082001409 2017-11-30 09:22:24 UTC <TroisVerres> The best writing advice. You've GOT to finish it to know what it's about.https://twitter.com/rowancoleman/status/935980387209158656
935932527965081601 2017-11-29 18:04:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Oh bums. Hope Miss B will make a space on the sofa for you when you get home. Sending 
935851256769327104 2017-11-29 12:41:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg ah this is a joy. You are with your people, C.
935846517331591173 2017-11-29 12:22:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain @HarrietEvans Why are you so obsessed with me?
935846268303298560 2017-11-29 12:21:52 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain @HarrietEvans OMG spot the Classics boff. You grab her bag, CC, I'll bogwash her.
935845183127683072 2017-11-29 12:17:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain Who wrote that???? The massive show off! Jeepers, did they get their (Oxbridge) college in the review too?
935844895507582977 2017-11-29 12:16:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley Stick with Diane & buy your own drinks, is my advice.
935844180429037568 2017-11-29 12:13:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley the only Greek I know is what my name means there. It's, er, not a good thing (tho it earned me many free drinks back in the day).
935843004086194176 2017-11-29 12:08:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley Obviously I got it instantly*  *did not get
935842614410141696 2017-11-29 12:07:21 UTC <TroisVerres> Colleague: Can I test these quiz answers on you? Me: Sure. *points* This one's a bit tricky, will anyone get it? Colleague: OH COME ON, it's obvious to anyone who's read the Odyssey.  Only in publishing.
935841046486958080 2017-11-29 12:01:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @georgeisediting @CarolineJHogg @rebeccafolland @HarrietEvans If I had the room, I'd have a chest of drawers. Or even a Candy Spelling-style 'wrapping room'. DREAM BIG.
935821923388358657 2017-11-29 10:45:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @rebeccafolland @georgeisediting @CarolineJHogg this is the stuff a present drawer is made of.
935820878327304192 2017-11-29 10:40:58 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland @georgeisediting @HarrietEvans ah, man, I remember that story! Good old DN.
935820507009769472 2017-11-29 10:39:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @rebeccafolland @georgeisediting haha, I've been known to do a little bit of gift redistribution, well done your mum.
935820259310931968 2017-11-29 10:38:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @rebeccafolland she doesn't buy for adults, bez, it doesn't count. she won't even need a spreadsheet.
935815114300719104 2017-11-29 10:18:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans stoppit, you're making me hyperventilate on your behalf.
935798133396836352 2017-11-29 09:10:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @emilylbrooks ah I see, the Nov birthdays make this slightly more understandable. I'm opening my spreadsheet in October...
935620851764006912 2017-11-28 21:26:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @emilylbrooks ugh, god, no, I would be dead of anxiety by about Dec 10th, how can you do it?
935597770488139776 2017-11-28 19:54:25 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg @suziedoore Okay you win. You absolutely win.
935597299086102531 2017-11-28 19:52:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @suziedoore @CarolineJHogg BECAUSE WE ARE WISE. The three wise (not) men.
935596295607259137 2017-11-28 19:48:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @suziedoore I mean. If you're not pretty much done by December you're asking for trouble, aren't you? December is for long lunches & Xmas parties, not shopping in a scrum.
935595410923708416 2017-11-28 19:45:03 UTC <TroisVerres> Newspapers & mags! Your holiday gift guides are all TOO LATE for the dementedly organised, my Xmas Excel spreadsheet is almost complete (I have four godchildren, it is a necessity, don't judge).
935548060691726337 2017-11-28 16:36:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @tarawestover Tara, I didn't know you were on Twitter - huge congratulations on the book which is a TRIUMPH! Such a delight to pass it on to others & see them love it too.
935529121270157312 2017-11-28 15:21:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @CaroSanderson @francescamain @georgeisediting @SarahEFranklin happy to send a proof your way, Sarah, if you DM your address? have turned quite evangelical about this one...
935527240460357632 2017-11-28 15:14:10 UTC <TroisVerres> @francescamain @georgeisediting haha, a pleasure, winging one your way now!
935478926394216454 2017-11-28 12:02:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @thesundaytimes @PublicityBooks haha, I had the opposite panic - assumed was excellent joke & then panicked I'd taken the piss out of your REAL IMPRINT. x
935257051177119747 2017-11-27 21:20:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @Wildfirebks @TrapezeBooks @headlinepg @PublicityBooks This is amazing. And it should be so!
935120133214916610 2017-11-27 12:16:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @janesscout omg! my spiritual home!
935089964857077765 2017-11-27 10:16:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette to be fair, many of 'the Brits' are asking ourselves the same thing. and I do believe our govt has the monopoly on 'unhelpfully antagonistic.'
933701518808748032 2017-11-23 14:19:24 UTC <TroisVerres> Some very wise advice in here about the agent/author relationship.https://twitter.com/JaneCaseyAuthor/status/933621316795682817
933060217654382593 2017-11-21 19:51:05 UTC <TroisVerres> @HutchinsonBooks @LucyMangan @SarahGPerry It is *amazing* and am sure @najmafinlay would send you a copy. @jocastahamilton
933004341446959104 2017-11-21 16:09:04 UTC <TroisVerres> It's a SLIVER of cake/pie/whatevs, not a slither, no matter how many people now use them interchangeably. YOU CAN'T HAVE A SLITHER OF CAKE.https://twitter.com/iowahawkblog/status/932309842123022336

932943007837507585 2017-11-21 12:05:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @nikeshshukla @georgeisediting Seconded & Oxfam Bookshops will email you with updates of how much your books have raised, which is v satisfying!
932625091371962368 2017-11-20 15:02:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusannahOtter true, but 'sorry it was my diamond nips' would be world's best excuse for a hole in a jumper.
932624708608167936 2017-11-20 15:00:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusannahOtter I like my bras to be worth more than my flat, personally. Diamond nips also super empowering (and quite useful now I think of it).
932623432818274304 2017-11-20 14:55:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @SusannahOtter But Susannah. It is so *empowering*.
931631342734987265 2017-11-17 21:13:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @fpathak Jenny G knows all (and tells me). have a marvellous weekend of celebration, grandma. xx
931630225812873221 2017-11-17 21:08:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @fpathak you're fifty now, right?
931630165595222016 2017-11-17 21:08:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @fpathak happy new DECADE, FP! x  (it is isn't it? haven't just aged you there?)
931452332063248384 2017-11-17 09:21:56 UTC <TroisVerres> @Alison_Edits Zinc! The one thing woo-woo types & doctors agree on - shortens the duration of a cold.
931121520218398720 2017-11-16 11:27:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @M_Z_Harrison #dogbassador is my new favourite thing! My own dogbassador has converted quite a few fearful types thru a relentless & somewhat needy charm.
931102929846710272 2017-11-16 10:13:32 UTC <TroisVerres> Deservedly so, I bloody loved this.https://twitter.com/miashby/status/931102238713483264
931091458903478272 2017-11-16 09:27:57 UTC <TroisVerres> There are four separate meetings marked 'catch-up' in my diary today. Can only hope to be fully caught by the end of the day (fully 'up' surely too much to expect).
930731754381611008 2017-11-15 09:38:37 UTC <TroisVerres> @mercatometropol oh brillant, thank you! just a few days to persuade him to be well-behaved then...
930730945107329024 2017-11-15 09:35:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @mercatometropol hello, heading your way on Sat - do you allow (small, well-behaved) dogs at the market? could you possibly let me know? thanks
930415494938746880 2017-11-14 12:41:54 UTC <TroisVerres> I bet it does, Joan.https://twitter.com/thedarkpages/status/930414461055307777
930153114316963840 2017-11-13 19:19:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @BTCare Nope, just multiple appointment changes with no explanation!

915959374476083200 2017-10-05 15:18:27 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland No, I will be begging them to adopt me as a Euro orphan.
915918689211486208 2017-10-05 12:36:47 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I feel it must be imminent, surely?
915911205721604097 2017-10-05 12:07:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning There are still the Macarthur Genius Grants, Sarra. I'm holding out for one of those.

915614862537035777 2017-10-04 16:29:29 UTC <TroisVerres> @BorisJohnson You really have no shame at all, have you?
915155804722008064 2017-10-03 10:05:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning oh the whole book is full of stories like this, you'll happily weep your way through it. She's a woman after our own dog-hair-covered hearts
915155594956410880 2017-10-03 10:04:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette There's a feature in this. Please write it!
915154109422071808 2017-10-03 09:58:37 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette Smash Hits has ruined us for millennial culture, hasn't it?
915153759755554816 2017-10-03 09:57:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning have you read Mary Oliver's Dog Songs? She goes to pick up her runaway dog & is made to wait while his finder makes him scrambled eggs. Aw.
915153253653991425 2017-10-03 09:55:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette i mean the PODCASTS felt too young, ha, not me! that came out wrong. 'I'm just sooo young & vibrant'.
915153076318818305 2017-10-03 09:54:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette have had to give up on quite a few millennial lady podcasts as just felt too young (am 44), but Fi & Jane feel like cool older sisters.
915152840569606144 2017-10-03 09:53:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette Totally! Have been snorting out loud while walking along, could honestly listen to the pair of them all day.
915147319414272000 2017-10-03 09:31:38 UTC <TroisVerres> The Fortunately podcast is the best thing to happen to my ears since I spent a small fortune at Maria Tash. Thanks @urchinette for the tip!
914787917540872192 2017-10-02 09:43:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @georgeisediting @rebeccafolland I don't even watch Strictly & it STILL pisses me off that they ALWAYS vote out the black celebrities first, ugh.
914787671679098882 2017-10-02 09:42:31 UTC <TroisVerres> ''Publishing is a political act.' Super interesting interview with the charming Colin Dickerman of FSG:http://lithub.com/interview-with-a-gatekeeper-colin-dickerman-isnt-as-shy-as-he-thinks/
914786209007882240 2017-10-02 09:36:42 UTC <TroisVerres> @georgeisediting Really hard not to just be entirely despondent, isn't it? Having to really bloody TRY to find good things.
914784232341426176 2017-10-02 09:28:51 UTC <TroisVerres> So baffled by people who claim to be pro-Brexit & yet anti-Trump. They're the same thing, dressed up in different flags. Rhetoric over fact.

913403846877163520 2017-09-28 14:03:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain fifteeeeeeen! but then she was married by seventeen, wasn't she? jeez.

913402333501038592 2017-09-28 13:57:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain I didn't read it, no, let me know if worth it. Definitely want to read the Fleet one.
913400200324100096 2017-09-28 13:49:12 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain there was not nearly as much fun-times with kindly bulldog Jack as I remembered.
913400119671783424 2017-09-28 13:48:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain they nearly die ALL THE TIME. Pa puts them all at insane risk - they spend a prairie winter in what is essentially a tar-papered garden shed
913399910921392128 2017-09-28 13:48:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain that scene is horrific 'you can have another baby!', but have you re-read the books as an adult? I did last year & it was quite traumatic.
913368670201663488 2017-09-28 11:43:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @CatherineCobain ME TOO. it couldn't be more up my street if it was on the pavement outside my house.

803625727375515649 2016-11-29 15:44:38 UTC <TroisVerres> After success of Ladybirds & Five on Brexit Island, who's writing the Sweet Valley High/Trump mashup the world is clearly waiting for?
803321681024581632 2016-11-28 19:36:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland @Helen_E_Francis is this like The Notebook, which everyone adores & which is utter shit?
803318383777382400 2016-11-28 19:23:22 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland I fear you either find them quirky & adorable or a bit insufferable. If the latter, am not sure it can be overcome.

802841047768371200 2016-11-27 11:46:36 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley I saw Amy in New York last week & had to restrain myself from obnoxious fawning
802839613588914177 2016-11-27 11:40:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley highly recommend the Elvira Mistress of the Dark one - also David & Amy Sedaris. Hope you enjoy!

802638271092232192 2016-11-26 22:20:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle just feels people like him up against so much outright incompetence on their own side
802638039709339648 2016-11-26 22:19:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle oh of course.
802636750841671681 2016-11-26 22:14:48 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle who is your MP? Must be awful to be sane Labour MP right now.
802635805109915648 2016-11-26 22:11:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle Bridget Christie called Corbyn the Paul Hollywood of politics - still in charge, but of what?
802635442134904832 2016-11-26 22:09:36 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle too enraging. And Corbyn today on Castro like some 15 year old socialist
802635138718953472 2016-11-26 22:08:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle all of these things! Inability to be an actual opposition when so much to oppose!
802634899261886468 2016-11-26 22:07:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle I said even when Labour was a disaster I voted for them as better than alternative, but can no longer believe that
802634514547806208 2016-11-26 22:05:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle had been keeping a post it with all my reasons for fury & now can't remember the final insulting straw
802634325174976512 2016-11-26 22:05:10 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle I left. Wrote a v cathartic letter with all my reasons why. It was pretty long...

783663578846990336 2016-10-05 13:42:11 UTC <TroisVerres> That's more like it Jeremy, but too bloody late, I resigned from the Labour Party an hour ago. http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/10/jeremy-corbyn-has-reappeared-and-hes-absolutely-furious

783645892058419200 2016-10-05 12:31:54 UTC <TroisVerres> literally resigning my membership of the Labour party over this. IN DESPAIR.
783644650619953152 2016-10-05 12:26:58 UTC <TroisVerres> I'd rather be a #citizenofnowhere than associated with Theresa May's dangerous rhetoric.
783641468699303936 2016-10-05 12:14:20 UTC <TroisVerres> News cycle so monumentally depressing that I can only seek refuge in the #publishingpets hashtag #cheerupitsBillpic.twitter.com/C9qVaAUi46

779390866523848704 2016-09-23 18:43:57 UTC <TroisVerres> Could not be more excited that we're publishing the legend that is @astro_timpeake, one of the nicest men on Earth (or off it).https://twitter.com/PenguinUKBooks/status/779322825131851776
779355255737909248 2016-09-23 16:22:27 UTC <TroisVerres> Super interesting article on monetising digital media (yeah, I know that sounds tedious, but swear it's not): http://trafficmagazine.com/2016/09/22/mo-pageviews-mo-problems/
779300471236390912 2016-09-23 12:44:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris it could actually be why they shut down, which would be delightfully karmic.
779297529334788096 2016-09-23 12:33:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @acaseforbooks well, he knows enough about violence against women to have a police caution for it.
779262858291011584 2016-09-23 10:15:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland now this just makes me think of the Pismo beach disaster in Clueless.

779254292922368000 2016-09-23 09:41:15 UTC <TroisVerres> Yesterday I found myself at a party with William Hague & I managed to avoid asking him for gossip on Brangelina & now I want my medal, pls.
779254064324509696 2016-09-23 09:40:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @Scriblit @ejhchess R*d L*ddle
779253086456012800 2016-09-23 09:36:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @Scriblit ugh, I avoid everything he writes, and yet can identify him just from this description. Vile man.
779241942005710848 2016-09-23 08:52:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @dianeshipley nine books on it this autumn. NINE.
779234190374146048 2016-09-23 08:21:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @Alison_Edits Notes on a Scandal on your list too?
779214748843925505 2016-09-23 07:04:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland god I hope so, but didn't we say similarly reassuring things about Brexit? No-one knows anything any more. (Day 22 )
778906641009901568 2016-09-22 10:39:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @NotRollergirl honest, you'll be fine (and sparkly afterwards).
778906551369236480 2016-09-22 10:39:27 UTC <TroisVerres> @NotRollergirl I had two piercings done there a month ago & it was practically painless. Bit stingy for a few days after, but that was it.
778630676778287105 2016-09-21 16:23:14 UTC <TroisVerres> Endlessly fascinating to see British TV through American eyes, (tho seriously, Americans, say no to Mr Bean): http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/british-comedies-to-stream-right-now.html?mid=twitter_vulture

778517613974519808 2016-09-21 08:53:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland I honestly have no clue. Totally a floating voter at this point, waiting for inspiration.
778512657783676928 2016-09-21 08:34:16 UTC <TroisVerres> Could not agree more with this.https://twitter.com/jreedmp/status/778354425270243328
777848624436903936 2016-09-19 12:35:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @Matineegirl What a shocking experience that must have been, and at 18, too. Great piece.
776724837045788672 2016-09-16 10:10:06 UTC <TroisVerres> Man next to me in coffee shop is reading a book called Is the Rectum a Grave? A question I have never thought to ask, or answer.

773859926632501248 2016-09-08 12:25:58 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Grammatical, simply does not describe the force for good that is Patti LaBelle.
773859305342767104 2016-09-08 12:23:30 UTC <TroisVerres> Might change my Twitter bio to read a bit more like Patti LaBelle's: https://twitter.com/MsPattiPatti #goals

773603374860206080 2016-09-07 19:26:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @Hemmo I KNOW (goss was limited, but essentially confirms Selasi is GREAT)
773603097977430016 2016-09-07 19:25:26 UTC <TroisVerres> Late home for #GBBO but it's okay because charming Uber driver's sister works with Selasi & gave me all the goss.
773519985310310401 2016-09-07 13:55:10 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bookywookydooda wait, have you transferred your affections from Damian Lewis??
773507599530618880 2016-09-07 13:05:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @paraicodonnell no, please, am still recovering from the horror of 'knife/fork/spoon'

773484857636847616 2016-09-07 11:35:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @Fig_Tree_Books outrageous slander, Bill is a *big* reader & as soon as he's finished the Neapolitan Quartet he'd love to leap on this.

773271768320573441 2016-09-06 21:28:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @Caroline_S keep the croc away from the kitty. Also away from the vodka. And have a better day tomorrow. Xx

773108147582078976 2016-09-06 10:38:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @VanessaGBooks yes, NC on TOTP, up the duff in a t-shirt that said 'I Feel Amazing' was the start of my hero worship!

771375235258081280 2016-09-01 15:52:42 UTC <TroisVerres> @BCDreyer I once had a copyeditor change 'dyeing' [hair] to 'dying'. I did not like that copyeditor. I hoped they would dye.
771293846634426368 2016-09-01 10:29:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @Miss_Peg a very good point, and a giant design flaw.
771293783216549888 2016-09-01 10:29:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette I know! And the joy of dog owning is so much in the walking, it's tragic.
771289614153879552 2016-09-01 10:12:28 UTC <TroisVerres> I have just been sent an email promoting a treadmill for dogs. A treadmill FOR DOGS. For when the outdoors is just too hard.

769113321459056640 2016-08-26 10:04:39 UTC <TroisVerres> @georgeisediting no way, I love a salad in a jar! If you're avoiding plastic (which everyone should) it's the perfect solution.
769113053598195712 2016-08-26 10:03:36 UTC <TroisVerres> did it? right, trying other forecasts. 13 adults, 12 children & four dogs huddled in a tent is NOT a holiday.
769112327954296832 2016-08-26 10:00:43 UTC <TroisVerres> If I just keep refreshing the BBC Weather homepage, that thunderstorm over my campsite will disappear, right?

767743292477956096 2016-08-22 15:20:39 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarperFiction @miashby @PublicityBooks ooh, I started this yesterday & read FAR too late into the night.
767628533330022400 2016-08-22 07:44:38 UTC <TroisVerres> Felt like a feathery metaphor for all sorts of things, all of which I emerge from ineffectually. Grim.
767628339221762048 2016-08-22 07:43:52 UTC <TroisVerres> Oh god just saw two pigeons somehow tangled together, flapping madly, one half dead & I just stopped there stupidly doing nothing.
766955181334421506 2016-08-20 11:08:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @CamillaElworthy have you contacted the police? they may already know who she is if this has happened before?
766954479447003136 2016-08-20 11:06:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @CamillaElworthy so distressing - hope you can find who this woman is.
766952563950260224 2016-08-20 10:58:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @CamillaElworthy oh my god, that looks horrific. Must have been so frightening for you & the dog. Hope you're okay.

763787448543477760 2016-08-11 17:21:32 UTC <TroisVerres> It is very hard to maintain the requisite aggrieved tone when chasing the late delivery of two poo emoji cushions. 
763725704915775488 2016-08-11 13:16:12 UTC <TroisVerres> @francescamain had to look them up - bitterballen. AVOID.

761606570694287361 2016-08-05 16:55:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning 60 years. should've sorted it years ago but times were tighter back then.
761603228031193088 2016-08-05 16:42:14 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning mine on the other hand is going to be around 40k *voms*
761603168430096384 2016-08-05 16:41:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning that sounds way more feasible - there is an agreed value for this sort of thing, despite what freeholders think.
761601655771111424 2016-08-05 16:35:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning have you used this: http://www.lease-advice.org/calculator/

761599729469972484 2016-08-05 16:28:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I've stolen so many of her decorating ideas that it's quite embarrassing when she comes round.
761598644688674816 2016-08-05 16:24:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Ha! My friend Emily has a gorgeous house in Rye - check it out: http://cometorye.co.uk/beecottage/
761598062955466752 2016-08-05 16:21:42 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Imagine! That place could be a brilliant writers' retreat. A whole new career opens up. But who will be Mapp & who Lucia??
761597548780019712 2016-08-05 16:19:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I spend my life scoping out properties in Rye. Live the dream! Do it!

760415319689138176 2016-08-02 10:01:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @JuliaKingsford i always have to stop them & ask what they're reading.
760192701937614848 2016-08-01 19:17:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @juneericudorie What total wankers. Can you report them to FB?

758287611198861314 2016-07-27 13:07:09 UTC <TroisVerres> New favourite expression encountered in a work email: 'shit-witch'. As in 'you shit-witch'. Not addressed to me, but I was v glad to be cc'd

756583704907149312 2016-07-22 20:16:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @rgay ALL the favourites for this - congratulations!!
755694282275717121 2016-07-20 09:22:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette really hard to sustain that sort of homage over multiple eps, I think, & love how well they've done it.
755693306328350720 2016-07-20 09:18:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette aren't they?! it does feel so Spielbergy, I love it.
755693184043327488 2016-07-20 09:17:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette yes, think you're right on that. such a shame (as is her dreadful wig - at least I hope it's a wig).
755692338849148928 2016-07-20 09:14:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette am only a few eps in but am not loving her in it - kind of always aware she is ACTING. agree on the girl problem...
755690834138456064 2016-07-20 09:08:29 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor Mariah of books is totally something to aim for. Zadie  Smith? *adjusts blingtastic sunglasses* I dont know her.
755690040588722176 2016-07-20 09:05:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans bez I saw yesterday! We can discuss at weekend (I thought ace & so did the Pin). Xx
755689530846502912 2016-07-20 09:03:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor definitely - am sure Id have gone full unbearable diva if given half the chance.
755687971140079616 2016-07-20 08:57:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor obvs I thought she wouldnt remember me (being lowly staffer), but she came over & jokingly accused me of blanking her. 2/2
755687630348619776 2016-07-20 08:55:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor also I had met her a long time ago, pre-White Teeth, then saw her at party much later when she was properly famous 1/2
755686869359288320 2016-07-20 08:52:44 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor yes a few times & she was as funny, smart & delightful as you could hope for.
755684369533169664 2016-07-20 08:42:48 UTC <TroisVerres> @JaneCaseyAuthor she is bloody lovely in real life.

753701890299424768 2016-07-14 21:25:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland don't worry, I'm sure there will be another constitutional crisis right around the corner.
753701131965108229 2016-07-14 21:22:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland or a Brexit swear jar? I made people pay me a Euro one year if they mentioned 50 Shades of Grey.
753699054257922048 2016-07-14 21:13:52 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland Might have to get a 'please do not speak of Brexit' badge for Frankfurt. The shame of it.
753694807306932224 2016-07-14 20:56:59 UTC <TroisVerres> Now I'm on the receiving end of the solicitous emails & the carefully phrased queries as to how things *are* over there and it's awful. 2/2
753694615702822912 2016-07-14 20:56:14 UTC <TroisVerres> S'weird, I've spent a lot of my career talking to foreign publishers about political/economic crisis in their countries. 1/2
753685266209136640 2016-07-14 20:19:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @LanceFitz @simnthrgd @rebeccafolland Soz, I'm off to Canada for their super hot non-bananas president.
753684226747269120 2016-07-14 20:14:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @LanceFitz @simnthrgd @rebeccafolland amazing! Rights has never looked so delightful.
753573352573374464 2016-07-14 12:54:22 UTC <TroisVerres> Offered to buy sandwich for a tramp. He asked for a curried chicken baguette. But as I work in Pimlico he got parmesan chicken on brioche.
753516873216581632 2016-07-14 09:09:56 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I've found it more about incremental gains than massive life-changing leaps forward. But little gains much more sustainable.

753165765969342464 2016-07-13 09:54:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @immmy oh god, you've actually made me cry at my desk. This is lovely.

751372561171099648 2016-07-08 11:09:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette is that what he said about the heroin with Shane McGowan? IS IT?*  *(i would've too)
751370782060777472 2016-07-08 11:02:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette jeez, IMAGINE. that must be tip of iceberg of excellent stories.
751369962657353729 2016-07-08 10:58:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette ah, I love to hear this. Wish he'd write a memoir, wouldn't it be fascinating?

749198408041295872 2016-07-02 11:09:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @blackpooltower this is such a brilliant idea. I'd be all over it if I had a spare room. Which I don't, cos, well, publishing...

747774697283162112 2016-06-28 12:52:35 UTC <TroisVerres> TL;DR - film it, report it, offer support to person being abused.
747774518962307072 2016-06-28 12:51:52 UTC <TroisVerres> Been thinking about this a lot & this article is v helpful on what to do if you see incidents of racial abuse: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/how-do-i-respond-racial-abuse-public-transport-onlookers-silent?CMP=share_btn_fb

747364359429586945 2016-06-27 09:42:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette oh really? didn't know that at the time, thought Ireland & US had special arrangement.
747363800664391680 2016-06-27 09:39:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette if British, I mean...
747363621357948928 2016-06-27 09:39:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette I think almost impossible to get a work visa for the US unless you had a US student visa.
747362281474957312 2016-06-27 09:33:47 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette nope & aside from a few friends who did Camp America, don't know anyone who did.
747048295072210944 2016-06-26 12:46:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans I just did this today too! Looking forward to voting you in as leader. X
746749395387973632 2016-06-25 16:58:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis @JaneCaseyAuthor seriously? double ugh. the super officious phrasing should've been a clue tbh.
746748407784538113 2016-06-25 16:54:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis exactly. I get the rage but it feels so misdirected here.
746747775753261056 2016-06-25 16:51:58 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis YES. Entire timeline is tweeting it - if Remain had won & Leavers tried this we'd have been outraged. Result sucks, but sticks.

745658998775488512 2016-06-22 16:45:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning nah, you need to invite the rest of us over to bring snacks & booze.

745574055856717825 2016-06-22 11:08:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @Alison_Edits PLEASED. Always hate that first day in new job when eg phone rings & you have no pens, no paper, no clue.
744482839190712320 2016-06-19 10:51:55 UTC <TroisVerres> Possibly the greatest gift I can give my dad this Fathers Day is to have fucked up lighting the bbq so he has to take over. 
743791397317283841 2016-06-17 13:04:22 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning the description of Jesus on a morsel of lumber never fails to make me hysterical. Great rec.
743486716623859712 2016-06-16 16:53:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @MrBrendanCox deepest sympathies to you & your family. Your wife was a brave & compassionate woman.
743485331723419649 2016-06-16 16:48:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @megleder Im too afraid of what your cat would do to him, Meg.
743485188697690112 2016-06-16 16:47:36 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning oh I know. But today I am in need of a canine therapy dog.
743474202687250432 2016-06-16 16:03:57 UTC <TroisVerres> Oh this shitty news. Think I may put a sign on Bill's bag reading 'comfort dog' and offer canine hugs to the sad & scared (I'm 1st in queue)
743438221808406528 2016-06-16 13:40:59 UTC <TroisVerres> God, Jo Cox. I can't believe this is happening in our country. Terrifying & appalling.
743384132227596288 2016-06-16 10:06:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @PennyLiechti oh good god, what did you ever do to deserve that sighting?? sympathies
743369213297975296 2016-06-16 09:06:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @MissEllieMae god yes, it's quite shocking.

743180409798803458 2016-06-15 20:36:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @KirstyBooks I feel like it's the natural house of a dog. Miss B is an eccentric (and adorable) outlier.

743178968904392708 2016-06-15 20:30:48 UTC <TroisVerres> @KirstyBooks @sarramanning which is the keen but dim, is it Hufflepuff? #askingforafriend #whoischewingacowhoofrightnow
743170340751351808 2016-06-15 19:56:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @rebeccafolland SURELY @guancialejon has worked that out by now, bez?
743168974435852288 2016-06-15 19:51:05 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans Chris should explain everything to everyone.

743121497426907136 2016-06-15 16:42:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland @suladoyle me too. Trump presidency seems less & less likely but Brexut feels v close & scary.
743117899011854336 2016-06-15 16:28:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle I feel exactly the same. Fearing the sort of laughing that might tip into hysterical panicked crying at any point.
742804177697542144 2016-06-14 19:41:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @sesp oh what a sweet picture - congratulations!
742652975735287808 2016-06-14 09:40:41 UTC <TroisVerres> I'm doing my bit for the Remain campaign by lunching at Frenchie today. It's okay, no need to thank me. #selfless http://www.frenchiecoventgarden.com/
742633388541149185 2016-06-14 08:22:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @mlmfd oh, you're in for a TREAT. I've just been re-reading another book of hers & she is so wise & funny.
742460199961759744 2016-06-13 20:54:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris this looks like my follows, tbh

742402719038705664 2016-06-13 17:06:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @urchinette I always think journaling is self indulgent & pointless UNTIL I DO IT. & then realise its so useful.
742401792386949120 2016-06-13 17:02:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @urchinette yes it wasnt immediate change for me, more slow acquiring of habit
742401545715765248 2016-06-13 17:01:36 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette definitely questioner. Always need to know why! And a little bit of upholder.
742398160191029249 2016-06-13 16:48:09 UTC <TroisVerres> @Alison_Edits @sarramanning yes, do! it will inspire me to kickstart a few good habits myself.
742394054634266624 2016-06-13 16:31:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning go go goooooo! I hope it helps!
742392990023438336 2016-06-13 16:27:36 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning also think of things you've changed that you thought you never would (for me, giving up smoking) & remember it's possible!
742392886491222017 2016-06-13 16:27:11 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning but as she says, no more decisions to make once you've made the habit. no more 'should I/shouldn't I', no willpower needed.
742392675270328320 2016-06-13 16:26:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I'm still gearing up to some of her abstinence changes - think she's right that for some there is no moderation.
742391826871619584 2016-06-13 16:22:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning GR says habits are 'the architecture of life' which really resonated for me.
742391611049582592 2016-06-13 16:22:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning what she is v good at is how habits require no willpower & so the better your habits, the easier things are for you
742391424222679040 2016-06-13 16:21:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @EastDulwichPH thanks, just booked them!
742383626818572289 2016-06-13 15:50:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @grainnefox @urchinette @sarramanning it's not wishy-washy platitudes, it's strategies that properly work.
742382297769517056 2016-06-13 15:45:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @grainnefox @urchinette me too, it's a properly helpful & life changing book.

740947318304874496 2016-06-09 16:43:01 UTC <TroisVerres> I just saw a gold Range Rover. For when a regular Range Rover isnt quite dickish enough.
740600067946614785 2016-06-08 17:43:10 UTC <TroisVerres> @mserinkelly something to do with Jewish names echoing through history
740599839323459584 2016-06-08 17:42:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @mserinkelly its something anti-Semites put  around names of Jewish people, reclaimed on Twitter as a fuck you.

740178369506103296 2016-06-07 13:47:29 UTC <TroisVerres> This morning on the tube I, carefree in summer sandals, smirked at two people who were wearing wellies. Im not smirking now. 
739914066962046976 2016-06-06 20:17:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @Miss_Peg it is worse that I can recognise the actual episode by its loudness!
739913589285326848 2016-06-06 20:15:21 UTC <TroisVerres> Neighbours watching GoT ep 7 excessively loud. Am about to release my direwolf (dachshund) & then hit them with all the spoilers #seenit

738678211119357952 2016-06-03 10:26:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @djy12345 I hope not too - wildly expensive X-rays should reveal all...

738644897280954368 2016-06-03 08:14:01 UTC <TroisVerres> Just dropped dog off at vet. I cried. Was it Bills tragic face as I left him or was it the estimated 800 bill? 
737941837219008512 2016-06-01 09:40:18 UTC <TroisVerres> Oh god, @IKEAUK you really must change your hold music. Feels like I've spent the last month listening to Abba & Journey on a loop.

734841860796108800 2016-05-23 20:22:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @KeshiniNaidoo true. I think the moths infested it *after* I'd worn it at the party. At least, that's what I tell myself.
734837870427525121 2016-05-23 20:06:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @KeshiniNaidoo true story - I nicked that ACTUAL dog-hair hat on that cover at a book party & it infested my shared house with moths.

727589921586855936 2016-05-03 20:05:29 UTC <TroisVerres> I wish there was a 'non-hideous' filter on eBay. By all means search for vintage armchairs, eBay algorithm, but only non-hideous ones.
727440384968773632 2016-05-03 10:11:17 UTC <TroisVerres> The most shocking event in ep 2 of Game of Thrones was the revelation that Melisandre can do magic WITHOUT GETTING HER TITS OUT. #whoknew

725802893824151553 2016-04-28 21:44:29 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning that is impressive, since she could hop up any time. Bill can't even REACH the bed & yet I let him in.
725802413505040385 2016-04-28 21:42:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning nooooo, you can't resist that face.
725802164870852608 2016-04-28 21:41:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland YES i was afraid of that too.

725598525497679872 2016-04-28 08:12:24 UTC <TroisVerres> Complaining of bad customer service on Twitter is the lowest form of tweet but OMG @TOMS. Avoid at all costs, unless you love fuck ups.

724897919824986112 2016-04-26 09:48:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell That's sad - she's so good at saying that the pain & suffering is real, even if the cause isn't physical.
724896874654797824 2016-04-26 09:44:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell It is SO SO great, I loved this book!

722830861486395393 2016-04-20 16:54:41 UTC <TroisVerres> So many Goths in Brixton tonight, all so violently individualistic as to be practically indistinguishable (as Elaine Dundy would have it).

722129907548057601 2016-04-18 18:29:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @itsabookthing @sophiehannahCB1 haha! my nephew's song was Bieber's Baby - with 'baby oh' becoming 'Baby Joe'. He haaaaaates it now he's 6!
722109234742194177 2016-04-18 17:07:12 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 gungy is definitely better, on reflection.
722106764473331712 2016-04-18 16:57:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 one look at you and I caaaan't disguise, you've got guuuuuunky eyes...
722100900425306112 2016-04-18 16:34:05 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I'm off home now to hold Bill's paw while we watch telly & I couldn't be happier.
722100241802096641 2016-04-18 16:31:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning haha, I'm totally singing along to Little Betsy now.
722098639213064192 2016-04-18 16:25:06 UTC <TroisVerres> Yep x 19. The song I sing to my dog is 'Gunky Eyes', to the tune of 'Hungry Eyes' from Dirty Dancing. http://www.buzzfeed.com/jasminnahar/slightly-odd-thing-dog-owners-have-done#.hiWb0E6XMB
721997162138181632 2016-04-18 09:41:52 UTC <TroisVerres> Sorry to bother, but you really should read this by @ruthwhippman on apologising. https://www.the-pool.com/news-views/opinion/2016/16/ruth-whippman-on-women-apologising?utm_source=today&utm_campaign=3089a3315d-Today_in_3_April_184_15_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0522b4f78a-3089a3315d-69113269&mc_cid=3089a3315d&mc_eid=fc47abeea8
721292646304624640 2016-04-16 11:02:22 UTC <TroisVerres> 'Wear lipstick to the tip' is 1 of the most useful pieces of advice I've ever been given. Men in hi-vis jackets swooped in & did EVERYTHING.

720903483461910528 2016-04-15 09:15:58 UTC <TroisVerres> @suziedoore happy happy birthday to you & also to your womb-mate. x
720871458159722496 2016-04-15 07:08:43 UTC <TroisVerres> @katbrown I'd avoid ashtanga & hot/power yoga & go for anything described as flow or hatha or iyengar. Yogarise in Peckham is v good.
720668993258942464 2016-04-14 17:44:12 UTC <TroisVerres> Just texted my dad to see how he was. He directed me to his blog. 
720250044834848769 2016-04-13 13:59:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @KatyJackson69 Ha! It's usually just sausage dogs & waffling round here.
720148331918422016 2016-04-13 07:15:16 UTC <TroisVerres> Dead birds are over. You heard it here first. #LBF16
720148215786577920 2016-04-13 07:14:49 UTC <TroisVerres> Best comment from US publr so far at #LBF16 I feel like everyones trying to pitch me a book where a dead bird teaches a person something.
719844471098241025 2016-04-12 11:07:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg haha! Am sure it's all terribly good for my immune system. *dies of plague*

719524820623433728 2016-04-11 13:57:40 UTC <TroisVerres> It was an aquarium.
719524793616351232 2016-04-11 13:57:33 UTC <TroisVerres> Me: what was your favourite thing on holiday? Niece, 8: umm, a museum, no not a museum, like a gallery, except for fish. Me: ???
719513999226900480 2016-04-11 13:14:39 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis this is a bloody (scuse pun) brilliant idea. Do let me know if/how I can help.
719509477360320512 2016-04-11 12:56:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bookywookydooda @PublicityBooks I especially liked the way the smell of gin hits you from the top of the stairs. x
719509358858657792 2016-04-11 12:56:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @Bookywookydooda @PublicityBooks thank you for recommendation of City of London Distillery. We had a great time. I exceeded trois verres. x
719449415241592832 2016-04-11 08:58:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @francescamain every stand should come with a panic room, imho.

715529425639587841 2016-03-31 13:21:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette please go & check out his Twitter feed (Fabio underscore Lanzoni).
715528843638005760 2016-03-31 13:19:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette ANNA, WHAT HAVE WE DONE?!
715527640027893761 2016-03-31 13:14:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette did we ... make it happen? Never joke about an elderly comedian again.
715522706695958529 2016-03-31 12:54:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette Ronnie Corbett?!
715245145025875974 2016-03-30 18:31:45 UTC <TroisVerres> @RosieBBooks ask them to please play along when your 'husband' appears at class next time, so Hello! doesn't catch on to the deception.
715244968256864256 2016-03-30 18:31:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @RosieBBooks lesbian using donor sperm? tragically jilted by a racy Italian playboy?
715244667382677505 2016-03-30 18:29:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @RosieBBooks time to invent a whole other life for yourself. COME ON, work with this. you're a single surrogate mother for a megastar?
715215064794603520 2016-03-30 16:32:14 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette try explaining Ronnie to an American - where to even begin?
715214530054369280 2016-03-30 16:30:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @Keris @hapgoodness @holly_bourneYA oh man, that is a GREAT KISS.
715214227452125185 2016-03-30 16:28:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @paulbogaards I think I've finally found my tattoo. thanks.
715212057537298433 2016-03-30 16:20:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette I won by posting her a pair of pants with the address written on the gusset.
715211985135255554 2016-03-30 16:19:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette had a bet with schoolfriend you could send ANYTHING through post as long as it had a stamp on it. she didn't agree.
715211830524788736 2016-03-30 16:19:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette oh my god, that is brilliant. Homegrown slebs when you are abroad are always the best. And even funnier when not understood...
715207844719673346 2016-03-30 16:03:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette STILL DOES. Stupid teen pranks are the greatest, we should do more of them as adults.
715207698812440576 2016-03-30 16:02:57 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette She was so happy with the set. A pillow of Fabio's face & a tshirt. It amused us for years.
715207566624759808 2016-03-30 16:02:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette AMAZING! We signed another friend up to incontinence supplies catalogue (pretending our college hall was an old people's home)
715207056756703232 2016-03-30 16:00:24 UTC <TroisVerres> She gave me a discount. #goodtimes #Fabionighttimeset
715206980307173378 2016-03-30 16:00:06 UTC <TroisVerres> The saleswoman on the phone took my name & asked, 'Is there a Mr Wright?' I said 'Would I be buying the Fabio night-time set if there was?'
715206803575988224 2016-03-30 15:59:24 UTC <TroisVerres> In the mid-90s my room mate at college in the US was obsessed with Fabio. I bought her the 'Fabio night-time set' from the shopping channel.
715206540693782532 2016-03-30 15:58:21 UTC <TroisVerres> Oh man, I love goose-killing, roller-coaster riding, romance novel cover-modelling 90s man hunk Fabio. #seventeenyears #RIPgoose

711599996865486848 2016-03-20 17:07:14 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis ah, that makes a lot more sense. Hope Bridie shed a nice lot of hair all over her.
711598369303617536 2016-03-20 17:00:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis whaaaat? How ridiculous.
710904818601213952 2016-03-18 19:04:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis for some people it seems quite the social highlight. *screams*
710903847162478592 2016-03-18 19:00:59 UTC <TroisVerres> @lucyinglis Flee! Flee! (says the person who sold her old flat to escape the residents' association)

710567049605615616 2016-03-17 20:42:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning am fairly confident he will - a few weeks his max & then back to tennis balls.
710564085394489344 2016-03-17 20:30:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning if you'd like a Tuffies MegaBone (TM) I think the sheer size of it is going to bore Bill v soon & he can donate to Miss B.
710563790446845953 2016-03-17 20:29:43 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning and bits of animals? *picks cow's ear from sofa cushion*
710561981640609792 2016-03-17 20:22:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning haha, have you tried Tuffies? We're building up quite the (oversized) library.
710557916533821440 2016-03-17 20:06:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning yes, he loves an eye mask, does Bill. It's a giant Tuffies tiger-print bone, OBVIOUSLY! (tested by tigers, the label tells me)
710556665867837442 2016-03-17 20:01:25 UTC <TroisVerres> Bills birthday: another chance to show my unerring instinct for mistakenly buying toys that are bigger than my dog.pic.twitter.com/lgG9EQg4Dt

710141461413679105 2016-03-16 16:31:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @bookish_norah NB I did not write this children's book!
710141382166503424 2016-03-16 16:31:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @bookish_norah Totally, so ridiculous. Luckily said book has over sixty 5* reviews, but still, it's just rude & stupid.
710139508021448705 2016-03-16 16:23:47 UTC <TroisVerres> Am*zon review of kids' book: '3 stars, granddaughter said it looked boring & wouldn't let us read it to her.' FFS, don't review it then!
710023874017103872 2016-03-16 08:44:17 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg oh my gad these are ADORABLE. Please post pic of them being worn. x
709668081174450176 2016-03-15 09:10:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg oh no, that sounds truly grim. I prescribe Netflix & pills, editrix. Feel better soon.
709445462009450496 2016-03-14 18:25:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning we're working on his mystique, Sarra. #elusive #unattainable #wontsitstillforthecamera

709437596779356160 2016-03-14 17:54:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning was it the #staffiesofinstagram hashtag that finally lured you onto Instagram?
709397644423077888 2016-03-14 15:15:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @CathyReadsBooks huge congratulations on the Wellcome Book Prize shortlist! Such brilliant news.
709396954703384576 2016-03-14 15:13:08 UTC <TroisVerres> Love this piece from Ruth Whippman, whose PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS is hilarious, troubling & super smart: https://www.the-pool.com/life/life-honestly/2016/10/why-the-happiness-industry-is-making-women-miserable?utm_source=saturday&utm_campaign=735ea7a249-this_week_s_highlights_wk10163_11_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_fa8feddc14-735ea7a249-48907665&mc_cid=735ea7a249&mc_eid=e3b7951b27

709387208919289856 2016-03-14 14:34:25 UTC <TroisVerres> @IanDunt oh god don't, I still feel crushing guilt at the miserable solitary life of my guinea pig (who died, er, over 30 years ago).
709380060218785792 2016-03-14 14:06:00 UTC <TroisVerres> Please tell me I'm not alone in singing 'Night Cheese' every time I see a sign for the Night Tube?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxqycijBUn0

707905856055205888 2016-03-10 12:28:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @mpphillips @urchinette welcome back!
707893146873679872 2016-03-10 11:37:32 UTC <TroisVerres> @mserinkelly @thepooluk @Hemmo setting up a http://change.org petition against this.
707889679832633344 2016-03-10 11:23:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @mpphillips review on Am*zon mentions an old ep of Corrie where Hilda Ogden hosts a soiree based on the book. Sounds too brilliant for words
707889555546963968 2016-03-10 11:23:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @mpphillips Considering actually living it for a while, feel like I could learn a lot from Babs.
707883871413649408 2016-03-10 11:00:41 UTC <TroisVerres> Naturally I have ordered myself a copy. #barbaracartlandsetiquettehandbook
707883571567071232 2016-03-10 10:59:29 UTC <TroisVerres> Entirely worth an hour of looking at backlist titles to discover a) we publish Barbara Cartland's Etiquette Handbook b) IT IS STILL IN PRINT
707860175085019136 2016-03-10 09:26:31 UTC <TroisVerres> Happy publication day to @Caroline_S - can't wait to read The Finding of Martha Lost!
707859905357684738 2016-03-10 09:25:27 UTC <TroisVerres> I absolutely devoured @sarramanning's After the Last Dance - out today. A book to properly lose yourself in. Add it to the reading pile.
707565880226488321 2016-03-09 13:57:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @caz_roberts @MsRachelCooke I just finished it over lunch, it's AMAZING. Was that annoying commuter who was reading while walking earlier...
707528437905358849 2016-03-09 11:28:19 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @urchinette @SusannahOtter *adds to list*
707526168162004992 2016-03-09 11:19:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette was doing quite well at eking but now on the home stretch & can't wait to finish. So believable & real & compelling.
707525368190779393 2016-03-09 11:16:07 UTC <TroisVerres> Completely obsessed by Anthony Quinn's new novel, Freya - it's calling to me from the bottom of my handbag.
707240061214060544 2016-03-08 16:22:25 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I am having to laugh very quietly. Too good.
707239605666500608 2016-03-08 16:20:36 UTC <TroisVerres> Overheard just now: Editor 'You just can't put a price on this sort of thing.' Sales 'Of course not. But if you could it would be 16.99'
707230223230701583 2016-03-08 15:43:19 UTC <TroisVerres> @benjohncock haha, TRUE. Highline gets mad tho - earlier the better. You can spring along it in freshfaced well-slept fashion.
707228050652532736 2016-03-08 15:34:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @benjohncock go to the Highline super early (you will be jetlagged, this will be easy to do) & then stop off at Bubby's for bacon & pancakes
707191199355039744 2016-03-08 13:08:15 UTC <TroisVerres> Who said it: Phil Collins or Suzanne Collins? I got 100%. May the odds be similarly in your favour: http://www.cbc.ca/books/2015/11/who-said-it-quiz-suzanne-collins-or-phil-collins.html

706950382749097984 2016-03-07 21:11:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland our teacher had to give us all a special lesson on how grammar worked as none of us understood
706950150191771649 2016-03-07 21:10:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland I didnt understand French grammar as had never been taught English grammar.
706949047899258886 2016-03-07 21:06:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland grammar MATTERS, I wish Id been taught it properly
706948960833945600 2016-03-07 21:05:41 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland yep. I had to piece it together myself from what I  learned in French. Much harder to grasp as adult.
706948416069361664 2016-03-07 21:03:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland because our generation never got taught grammar properly!!

705336420748161024 2016-03-03 10:18:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @jesskatbee I would like a dress with this pattern please.
705330869297356801 2016-03-03 09:55:58 UTC <TroisVerres> Love this article on mothers in literature from @sarramanning - especially the spirited defence of Mrs Bennet. http://www.redonline.co.uk/reviews/book-reviews/the-best-mother-figures-in-books

705085018402586624 2016-03-02 17:39:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @CharlHeathcote Not sure, I wonder if they price low to build excitement & interest & ultimately drive the prices way up?
705083414102282240 2016-03-02 17:32:40 UTC <TroisVerres> @CharlHeathcote Gah. Nice Sotheby's lady warned us they were expecting the bidding to go mental on the day, but this is truly nuts.
705081050368757760 2016-03-02 17:23:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @CharlHeathcote we went to the exhib yesterday & it was AMAZING. Did you visit? What did you try to buy?
705072694644117504 2016-03-02 16:50:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @rgay Please wear a Planned Parenthood tshirt.

704989317811335168 2016-03-02 11:18:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @Damian_Barr I saw these in real life yesterday &, well, they were a little tatty. The electroplated egg coddler on the other hand...

704697028627079169 2016-03-01 15:57:18 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @BeatrixMcIntyre I did not see it - but ask @harrietevans about the electroplated egg coddler. That we liked a lot.
704694691250442242 2016-03-01 15:48:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @blackpooltower The exhibition was AMAZING. Her Grace's collection of a lot of bonkers things, Elvis was merely the tip of a great iceberg.

701500849793662976 2016-02-21 20:16:50 UTC <TroisVerres> The cousin in Dirty Dancing always makes me totally hysterical. Only ever appears to heave in giant chunks of plot.
701500616569442304 2016-02-21 20:15:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @sarramanning @annaframe also, reassuringly, Bill has done that train journey to Newcastle without the need for a dog nappy.
701500454748999684 2016-02-21 20:15:16 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @sarramanning @annaframe yes, exactly! Gorgeous
701500174003216384 2016-02-21 20:14:09 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell way less worthy than that sounds, obvs.
701500063005200384 2016-02-21 20:13:42 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell Smart, funny, feminist (and written to make young women aware of what life was like pre-Roe vs Wade).
701499857605894148 2016-02-21 20:12:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell Are you effing kidding me? It's GENIUS. Honestly a brilliant movie.
701499756565110784 2016-02-21 20:12:29 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland how can we make her our bez if we have to confess we watched DD for 150th time instead??
701499273305837570 2016-02-21 20:10:34 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @annaframe It's such a beautiful picture - perfectly framed like a Renaissance portrait!!
701499034708480000 2016-02-21 20:09:37 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland We must do it for Olivia. She's nearly our friend, you know.
701496935857971200 2016-02-21 20:01:17 UTC <TroisVerres> (almost certainly not)
701496851686682624 2016-02-21 20:00:57 UTC <TroisVerres> Can I trust myself to watch only an hour of Dirty Dancing & switch over at 9pm for the Night Manager? #icarriedawatermeloninaspythriller
701002414309171200 2016-02-20 11:16:14 UTC <TroisVerres> @SarahMillican75 you look LOVELY, what a great dress.
701002334164402177 2016-02-20 11:15:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @JillMansell I'm still waiting for my cheque, Jill. Hurry up.
700747399765954560 2016-02-19 18:22:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @msleedy being bad at taking selfies is a badge of honour in my book.
700747304026804225 2016-02-19 18:22:31 UTC <TroisVerres> @msleedy oooh, LOVELY!
700738388719108096 2016-02-19 17:47:05 UTC <TroisVerres> @msleedy oof, wiiiiildly optimistic, given how poorly you sound. STAY IN BED (with nice hair).
700735471433830401 2016-02-19 17:35:30 UTC <TroisVerres> So sad to hear about Harper Lee. And to be out of the office on a day when @WmHeinemann will not doubt be telling excellent Lee stories.
700688369836126208 2016-02-19 14:28:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 nephew clearly had 0 to do with it. But lots of information, damaging to Avery, didn't make it into the documentary.
700687726236938242 2016-02-19 14:25:46 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 because while he agrees SA was innocent of the first crime, he has serious doubts about his innocence of the murder.
700687405699891200 2016-02-19 14:24:30 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 nb a free book, not a 'free Steven Avery'. Badoom-tish.
700687289479884801 2016-02-19 14:24:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @sophiehannahCB1 and you can get a free copy from your sister!!
700675144847495168 2016-02-19 13:35:47 UTC <TroisVerres> My kingdom for the person who establishes a decent courier company. My kingdom and my eternal custom.
700662956674011136 2016-02-19 12:47:21 UTC <TroisVerres> @anitathetweeter @katbrown BdiL seconded. Palomar also brilliant & they love a celebration.
699977716934770688 2016-02-17 15:24:27 UTC <TroisVerres> @francescamain oh my god, this is amazing.
699913933486956544 2016-02-17 11:11:00 UTC <TroisVerres> @agladman It serves me right for looking at a Smeg hob, I suppose.
699913356434612225 2016-02-17 11:08:42 UTC <TroisVerres> Most John Lewis-ish product review ever: We have one exactly the same in our other house so we knew it was going to be good!! #otherhouse
699880584735297536 2016-02-17 08:58:29 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette Do you remember Geri Halliwell auditioned for that role? It could have been EVEN WORSE.
699879716732456960 2016-02-17 08:55:02 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @HarrietEvans @sarramanning Vomiting seems like a perfectly natural response. Your nephew just helped it along.
699879568237268992 2016-02-17 08:54:26 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @HarrietEvans @sarramanning God it was terrible, wasn't it? The whole audience shuffled out afterwards in mortified silence.
699878210021023744 2016-02-17 08:49:03 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @HarrietEvans @sarramanning Also Harrie please stop talking publicly about my bad plastic surgery, okay?
699878086775545857 2016-02-17 08:48:33 UTC <TroisVerres> @urchinette @HarrietEvans @sarramanning I went to actual London premiere of this. We had tickets to afterparty but too traumatised to go.
699641388875542528 2016-02-16 17:08:00 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans Haha, had forgotten all about the Browns Barman & his code. Did you show him your good points tho? x
699287676718030848 2016-02-15 17:42:28 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @Hoppo999 @joroberty or linkis or whatever it's called. Can't find it on the Bookends site!
699287032640700417 2016-02-15 17:39:55 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans @Hoppo999 @joroberty Ooh, do you have a link that isn't via Links??
698251028039397379 2016-02-12 21:03:12 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning I suppose youre right - I just love that book so much. EVERYONE MUST READ IT.
698220231559348224 2016-02-12 19:00:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @Sophiemorme only just saw this, v sorry to hear it. Enjoy the rest of your mat leave & who knows what good things are coming your way?
698219718784741376 2016-02-12 18:58:47 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning wot no Heartburn?! I must read the Barbara Comyns, sounds just my sort of thing.
697082356507795456 2016-02-09 15:39:19 UTC <TroisVerres> Are you listening to the Invisibilia podcast? You should be.
697081473858404352 2016-02-09 15:35:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @rebeccafolland @suladoyle No for I heart David Young & know EXACTLY who he is.
697079985576800256 2016-02-09 15:29:54 UTC <TroisVerres> @suladoyle DG very much did not think so, alas.
697073977592844288 2016-02-09 15:06:01 UTC <TroisVerres> @theguyliner I once mistook DG for a flower delivery man at a party. Took his flowers & tried to shut the door on him. #teamzoella
697023655826616320 2016-02-09 11:46:04 UTC <TroisVerres> @CarolineJHogg oh god, grimness all round, you poor (now sharp-cheekboned) thing. Take it easy, lady editor. x
696780998479106049 2016-02-08 19:41:50 UTC <TroisVerres> @emilylbrooks I'm fairly sure the small sofa I'm adding will be dog bed within minutes.
696779303313371136 2016-02-08 19:35:06 UTC <TroisVerres> @emilylbrooks sadly am not in the market for a 75k bespoke kitchen to accommodate my unusually tall husband.
696778730463752192 2016-02-08 19:32:49 UTC <TroisVerres> @emilylbrooks well NOW you tell me white gloss kitchen cupboards are over! http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/12091552/Scandi-chic-is-out-its-all-about-farmhouse-kitchens-in-2016.html
696678018924875777 2016-02-08 12:52:38 UTC <TroisVerres> @HarrietEvans this is so so great! I want to read it! When can I read it! x
696454489289723906 2016-02-07 22:04:24 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Say no more.
696453669219364864 2016-02-07 22:01:08 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning (which is that it makes a dog feel dominated. And not in a good way)
696453594967642113 2016-02-07 22:00:51 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning It changed a few things for me  - Bill never has to wear his hated fleece again now I know THE TRUTH.
696452285598212097 2016-02-07 21:55:39 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Have you read Inside of a Dog by Alexandra Horowitz? So great & fascinating on how dogs think & behave, think you'd love.
696449189090304000 2016-02-07 21:43:20 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning no way - Sarra, there is a market here for stay-at-home dog entertainment. You will make millions.
696448746276679681 2016-02-07 21:41:35 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Bill too - ANY tv wildlife has him growling & barking, even if it's just a picture, no noises.
696443917181546496 2016-02-07 21:22:23 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Hahaa! Bill does this too - does Miss B try to look for the cat round the back of the tv?

695732410525294592 2016-02-05 22:15:07 UTC <TroisVerres> @msleedy that sounds horrible & scary - hope they're making you feel better. x

694894331346436096 2016-02-03 14:44:53 UTC <TroisVerres> @Hoppo999 Relevant to my interests & I'm pretty sure I can persuade you also: http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/first-official-look-at-chris-hemsworth-in-ghostbusters.html?mid=twitter_vulture#
694858753712218112 2016-02-03 12:23:31 UTC <TroisVerres> I would never demean Bill by referring to him as a 'wiener dog' but when it comes to the costume, well...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNN9nL2vppM&feature=youtu.be

693140860498747392 2016-01-29 18:37:13 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning @waitrose Quite. Perhaps toast dislikers all so dim they must be reminded of the fact?
693139676249640961 2016-01-29 18:32:31 UTC <TroisVerres> I love the recipes tho @waitrose. 
693139603629457408 2016-01-29 18:32:14 UTC <TroisVerres> Why does every recipe in @waitrose Food mag use the annoying & wholly redundant phrase if liked. #Idontlikepic.twitter.com/1St8naSmEL
692665063967215616 2016-01-28 11:06:35 UTC <TroisVerres> Well this sounds like the nicest thing I could possibly imagine eating right now: http://www.helengraves.co.uk/2016/01/28/squash-miso-soup-with-cheese-kimchi-toasties/ (from @FoodStories)

691703142929547264 2016-01-25 19:24:15 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning they are SO nice to children there, too, really accommodating & lovely. Massively recommend if you have smalls to entertain.
691691040328302593 2016-01-25 18:36:09 UTC <TroisVerres> @sarramanning Due to have tea there with my goddaughter a week on Sun. It's my Tiffany's - nothing bad can happen to you there.
