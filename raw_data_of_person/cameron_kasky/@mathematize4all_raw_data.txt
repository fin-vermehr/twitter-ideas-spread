It is just that their math instruction tends to be procedural, and research on their learning tends to be procedural.

926527876609933312 2017-11-03 19:13:54 UTC <mathematize4all> @bkdidact And they seemed to find that inclusive classrooms had fewer behavior issues (teacher perception) connected to kids with disabilities
926527737187090433 2017-11-03 19:13:21 UTC <mathematize4all> @bkdidact Well, the data is all surveys of teachers reporting on their teaching, which is not how I would research this question

862710789014142976 2017-05-11 16:47:35 UTC <mathematize4all> @TracyZager @bkdidact @heidifessenden But to be clear, I think that student-centered is the key for SwD. But just including them is not enough. We need to ensure deep engagement
862704413026115584 2017-05-11 16:22:14 UTC <mathematize4all> @TracyZager @bkdidact @heidifessenden and thanks for starting such a great conversation!
862704318612361216 2017-05-11 16:21:52 UTC <mathematize4all> @TracyZager @bkdidact @heidifessenden By engagement, SwD called on less, less whole class and small class participation so for deep learning for SwD,  deepen engagement
862703897357328384 2017-05-11 16:20:12 UTC <mathematize4all> @TracyZager @bkdidact @heidifessenden Less engagement than other Ss in student-centered (cites in that article). I don't know any studies that compare the two pedagogies.
862700787788505088 2017-05-11 16:07:50 UTC <mathematize4all> @TracyZager @bkdidact @heidifessenden We need to look at how the SwD are participating in standards-based math- they need to be deeply engaged, supported to develop big ideas

840024252724137984 2017-03-09 02:19:23 UTC <mathematize4all> @bkdidact One reason is that most math research has excluded SWD, so is the "normal" progression true for all learners?
