814878356692942848 2016-12-30 16:58:34 UTC <missuspreda> Let us teach our sons to have self control rather than teach our daughters that they may get raped if they are wearing the "wrong thing"
814878064157093888 2016-12-30 16:57:24 UTC <missuspreda> RAPE IS NOT OKAY. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT SOMEONE IS WEARING. RAPE IS NOT OKAY.
