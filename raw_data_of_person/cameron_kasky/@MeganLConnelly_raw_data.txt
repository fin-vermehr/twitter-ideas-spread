942077957358735361 2017-12-16 17:04:22 UTC <MeganLConnelly> @kylegriffin1 Maybe we should have Obama announce that he is in favor of lighting children on fire, chopping down rainforests, and disbanding the courts.  Perhaps then our Contrarian-In-Chief would start giving a crap about America and its citizens.

941959347793551360 2017-12-16 09:13:03 UTC <MeganLConnelly> @RevDrBarber I feel like its time that we acknowledge that the GOP have crossed the line from loyal party soldiers, hopeful that their leader will eventually conform to norms & rule of law to complicit, self-serving windbags who collectively have less vertebral strength than a jellyfish.

940432277061996544 2017-12-11 04:05:01 UTC <MeganLConnelly> This is an excellent thread. For a group of people who think the govt should have no say in how many guns they own or how to spend their money (including reductions/elimination of social services), they sure have a lot to say about what goes on in other peoples uteruses.https://twitter.com/jenashleywright/status/940026121395101696

842467891480018944 2017-03-16 20:09:32 UTC <MeganLConnelly> @Newsweek Someone might want to show this to Sean Spicer.  He's operating in an alternate reality.

842464279265697793 2017-03-16 19:55:11 UTC <MeganLConnelly> @jonkarl @PressSec @politico He's getting defensively heated.  Does he know he's on national TV?  It's painful.
842463896862658560 2017-03-16 19:53:39 UTC <MeganLConnelly> @attackerman @rabiasquared It's equal parts entertaining and cringe-worthy.  This is reminiscent of day-1-yelling-in-oversized-coat Spicer.
842462963038621696 2017-03-16 19:49:57 UTC <MeganLConnelly> Does it count as a press conference if Sean Spicer stands up there and reads his book report the whole time?   @jaketapper @JoyAnnReid
