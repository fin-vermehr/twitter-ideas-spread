722237640741949440 2016-04-18 01:37:26 UTC <TrishMarieBee> Yes, no, or maybe: it is completely reasonable to wake your sleeping husband to point out something you want in a VS commercial.
722232471710896128 2016-04-18 01:16:54 UTC <TrishMarieBee> Thanks to my hubs, the kid's new bedtime routine includes a request to "make the Princess dolls toot" #worstparentsever

701480362526920704 2016-02-21 18:55:25 UTC <TrishMarieBee> It's rare that a thought in my head does not involve potential toddler dangers or Disney songs. When it does hapoen tho, a tweet is born.
700706880147103744 2016-02-19 15:41:53 UTC <TrishMarieBee> Leave people better than when you found them.

698921336492658688 2016-02-14 17:26:46 UTC <TrishMarieBee> When your husband mistakes your breathing for a grumbly tummy, it's prolly time to go to urgent care. #sosick

691758293375696896 2016-01-25 23:03:24 UTC <TrishMarieBee> Every time my child picks her nose and eats it, I feel as tho I've failed her.
689950068846301185 2016-01-20 23:18:09 UTC <TrishMarieBee> My 2 year old's after-school tantrums alternate between insisting we go to @Target and wanting to watch scares on @TheEllenShow repeatedly.
689621933663608833 2016-01-19 01:34:16 UTC <TrishMarieBee> Cheers to my husband for seeing me in the same joggers 4 days in a row and not leaving me!
