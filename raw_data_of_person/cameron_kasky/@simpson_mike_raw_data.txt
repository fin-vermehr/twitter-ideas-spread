850769926835109888 2017-04-08 17:58:51 UTC <simpson_mike> @therealcliffyb Could also use different SMS/phone apps for now as a temporary bandaid. I'm running out of ideas that don't involve factory reset. Sorry 
850769307793592321 2017-04-08 17:56:24 UTC <simpson_mike> @Aviate @therealcliffyb I wonder if uninstalling/reinstalling aviate would help...update probably changed SMS/phone apps and aviate is assuming everything is same
850765192656977922 2017-04-08 17:40:03 UTC <simpson_mike> @therealcliffyb How about switching back to stock launcher and then back to aviate after a restart? Even if doesn't explain why play store is being weird
850761862350352385 2017-04-08 17:26:49 UTC <simpson_mike> @therealcliffyb going into settings and clearing cache/data for contacts/text apps may fix it. But you'll lose any text convos

780583370703114243 2016-09-26 01:42:32 UTC <simpson_mike> I wasnt aware that the US was considered a 3rd world country
774450396181979136 2016-09-09 03:32:17 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo I was surprised how quickly it felt normal. By the 2nd day my old phone (nexus 5) felt tiny
774448203009781761 2016-09-09 03:23:34 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo coming from a 6+, the camera and 3D Touch are the 2 most exciting things to me
774445859895468032 2016-09-09 03:14:16 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo please let me know what you think of it! If you think they look solid enough Ill give it a try
774444958430457857 2016-09-09 03:10:41 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo I had a Speck case once and always felt like I was carrying 2 phones
774442376240701444 2016-09-09 03:00:25 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo do they feel like they would protect in case of a drop?
774442084010979328 2016-09-09 02:59:15 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo I have a red silicone case on mine, but now wish I would have gotten one of those!
774440430641504256 2016-09-09 02:52:41 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo if anyone know how to market, its definitely Apple!
774439840653930498 2016-09-09 02:50:21 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo the last black iPhone I had was the original, but jet black looks so seamless and pretty!
774438189633245192 2016-09-09 02:43:47 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo a silver 128 gb 7+. The jet black continues to tempt though!
774432056810037248 2016-09-09 02:19:25 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo apparently no way to make a payment through Apple besides in store. Hopefully something that gets fixed for next year
774431331602268161 2016-09-09 02:16:32 UTC <simpson_mike> @jen_slomo AT&T Next thru Apple wont deliver cause down payment may be needed. Im qualified without but Apple cant see that 
774384113218445312 2016-09-09 23:08:54 UTC <simpson_mike> (2/2) AT&T online wont recognize my address, and the AT&T store in my mall was closed due to a fire. 
774383912441315328 2016-09-09 23:08:06 UTC <simpson_mike> (1/2) Well preordering the new iPhone has proven a lot harder than it should be. Apple will only do in-store pickup
