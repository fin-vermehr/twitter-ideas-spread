I went to the former Bloc countries in the 70s and 80s and adopted from Ukraine in 1995. Don't let the fascists win!

967128479325016064 2018-02-23 20:06:12 UTC <cawickertwitz> @NastyWmnAction Reuters says that they are going to stop writing these policies as of 4 hours ago. That was quick!

966035637668265984 2018-02-20 19:43:38 UTC <cawickertwitz> thank you so much for interviewing Aaron Stark! How many people were saved by a blueberry peach pie? Aaron I would hug you if I could.  @KatyTurNBC
965751695362859008 2018-02-19 00:55:21 UTC <cawickertwitz> HOW THEY  IMPEACH SPEAKERS IN NIGERIA https://youtu.be/RrVv1KVuXw4 via @YouTube  Congress of the United States? Do your jobs! First you need a speaker who will actually let the bills be brought to the floor. That is their job. You are all complicit.

961350861866717186 2018-02-07 21:28:01 UTC <cawickertwitz> @Kinsa_Support I have a moto g5 plus - does your ear thermometer work with it?
950059202751340544 2018-01-07 17:38:59 UTC <cawickertwitz> @OregonSOS @cindylasb If an elected government official feels no fiduciary duty to perform in the best interests in the MAJORITY of their constituents, they need to be recalled or impeached. This is not a partisan issue. We are witnessing the formation of an autocracy.
950057502699237378 2018-01-07 17:32:14 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RWPUSA @PaulEdens6 American Mensa has offered the president a waiver of the fee to take the entrance exam. He hasn't accepted. I think that maybe Mensa should offer it to everyone in the Cabinet and Congress.
950001251315404802 2018-01-07 13:48:43 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RWPUSA @PaulEdens6 Didn't King George have a curable malady?
949389453079924737 2018-01-05 21:17:39 UTC <cawickertwitz> @OregonSOS Another example of conservatives trying to force something on the majority by using underhanded, devious, and morally wrong methods.
948702261303128064 2018-01-03 23:46:59 UTC <cawickertwitz> @JeffMerkley We need to impeach the president now. We can worry about candidates later in the year. The president is dangerous and unhinged and it is congress's job to reign him in.
943964297557708800 2017-12-21 22:00:01 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RonWyden Shut it down.
943195136430784512 2017-12-19 19:03:38 UTC <cawickertwitz> @repgregwalden Despicable.
943194592182026240 2017-12-19 19:01:29 UTC <cawickertwitz> @repgregwalden I guess you were going to take advantage of the pass-throughs too? Or is it just because of your wealthy donor friends?
938123385049149440 2017-12-05 19:10:19 UTC <cawickertwitz> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BvrtnPrgrsv I think I should hashtag this with Hillsboro or-- Beaverton but I've never read the facts on any app before I needed to
938123166076907520 2017-12-05 19:09:26 UTC <cawickertwitz> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BvrtnPrgrsv The people pushing the president to veto the bill would give him a popular win temporarily and that's all he cares about
938122932383043585 2017-12-05 19:08:31 UTC <cawickertwitz> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BvrtnPrgrsv He said I was a nut
938122723963715584 2017-12-05 19:07:41 UTC <cawickertwitz> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @BvrtnPrgrsv We're obviously not very good at tweeting because I'm the only person commenting:-) Yesterday my husband told me or not because I agree we should push Trump to veto the bill.
936316593834901504 2017-11-30 19:30:46 UTC <cawickertwitz> @Newsweek She's far too classy for the White House anyway
929881093087444992 2017-11-12 01:18:23 UTC <cawickertwitz> @JoyAnnReid  Listen to this Tom Lehrer song "I Wanna Go Back To Dixie" from 1953. It's hilarious and scarily apropos.https://music.amazon.com/albums/B016Z2XRBK/CATALOG?ref=dm_wcp_albm_link_pr_s
927623897486204928 2017-11-06 19:49:06 UTC <cawickertwitz> @maddow  Can you interview Brenda Ann Spencer at the California Women's Institution? School shooting in San Diego in 1979, no assault weapon
923981873361043461 2017-10-27 18:37:00 UTC <cawickertwitz> @NASAEarth @NASA @Zodden100 Maybe Kellyanne Conway and Sebastian Gorka could go with them. She is "blonde" too and I don't think Melania likes him.
920066097629368327 2017-10-16 23:17:06 UTC <cawickertwitz> @theNFLprotest  I'm a 56 year-old woman who has never been a fan but now I'm watching. I just wish you wouldn't tackle each other. It hurts.
920065805508739072 2017-10-16 23:15:56 UTC <cawickertwitz> @theNFLprotest  Good for you! Keep on kneeling! True patriots fight injustice.
918699441648832512 2017-10-12 04:46:30 UTC <cawickertwitz> @ddale8 @khwalz @peggysadams You could write a heck of a patter song with current events!
918659023083225089 2017-10-12 02:05:53 UTC <cawickertwitz> It's and exclamation point to the power of 4, not 16.  1*2*2*2*2=16 what you have is a much bigger number, too big to tweethttps://twitter.com/maddow/status/918583219393646592
918650626757632000 2017-10-12 01:32:31 UTC <cawickertwitz> @maddow  It's ! to the 4th power, you know, ! With a little 4 ( 1 *2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16  I can't do superscript on this stupid chromebook
913916162060148738 2017-09-29 23:59:27 UTC <cawickertwitz> @rogoway Totally topical topic today
913912292386807808 2017-09-29 23:44:04 UTC <cawickertwitz> @rogoway I don't think he's the type to take a private plane but he was fundraising even if he visited intel
913911788529344512 2017-09-29 23:42:04 UTC <cawickertwitz> @rogoway It was a fundraiser so it shouldn't have been paid for with taxpayer funds.
913849154551431168 2017-09-29 19:33:11 UTC <cawickertwitz> @rogoway  When Paul Ryan visited in April, how did he travel? Just curious.
897258082576629760 2017-08-14 00:46:11 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RonWyden Do you know anything about Glen E. Conrad, the judge who granted Jason Kessler the last minute location change in Charlottesville?
897254901041909764 2017-08-14 00:33:33 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RonWyden It's time to banish the Bannomites!
897254354633211906 2017-08-14 00:31:22 UTC <cawickertwitz> @realDonaldTrump @SenJeffMerkley Banish the Bannomites!
890046378306449408 2017-07-25 03:09:27 UTC <cawickertwitz> @RonWyden The GOP Congress. Where men are men but only the women have balls.
