972319784770486272 2018-03-09 03:54:36 UTC <junekaiser> @pattibacchus @janmeehan I left the table too soon, my understanding is the only thing that was agreed upon was to present at the next round of bargaining a proposal to increase the hours of all EAs in the province to 35 hours.  Not holding my breath for this or anything else.
972305974877827072 2018-03-09 02:59:43 UTC <junekaiser> @pattibacchus Disagree! More homegrown courses when what is needed are provincial standards not catering to the whims of the individual districts.  A regulatory body for EAs needs be established.  Nail salon workers have regulatory bodies yet people who support our most vulnerable kids do not!

962467108339593216 2018-02-10 23:23:35 UTC <junekaiser> @InclusionBC Thank you for including support workers in this.  More than anyone it is the support worker, the EA in this case,  that struggles for the true inclusive environment for the students they work with.
962371864021495809 2018-02-10 17:05:07 UTC <junekaiser> @richardzussman @mompavle We don't get respect because the kids we support are not considered important.  For all the talk about inclusion and diversity in schools and elsewhere, it is just that - talk. There is no system wide support.
962366790817923073 2018-02-10 16:44:57 UTC <junekaiser> @richardzussman @mompavle If school boards are starting to hire non teachers as teachers, you can imagine where EAs are on the list.  Simply a warm body to babysit a child who isn't going to amount to much anyway - why would we need pro d? It's infuriating!
962059616921182210 2018-02-09 20:24:21 UTC <junekaiser> @richardzussman Bah! Without funding for increased EA hours this wont make much difference. Teachers direct but EAs do the actual supporting.

960311569555996673 2018-02-04 00:38:14 UTC <junekaiser> @Anon_EA No. Because our society and culture has not evolved enough to understand, appreciate and welcome diverse needs. The powers that be see them as a distraction, a nuisance, an unnecessary expense, something we should be ashamed of and something to keep hidden. We have a ways to go.

957145793944694784 2018-01-26 06:58:34 UTC <junekaiser> @BCEdAccess Government needs to look at special needs and the role of the EA.  EAs support special needs students and are vital to the success of those students, yet on going training, support and respect are minimal at best.

Should be all kids not just Vancouver kids and we need to stop differentiating between kids and kids with special needs. They are all just kids. To separate them into groups makes it easier to deny equity.
