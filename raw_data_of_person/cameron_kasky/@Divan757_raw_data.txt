963183131955224576 2018-02-12 22:48:48 UTC <Divan757> @NewDay I know I'm late but did my ears deceive me? A US congressman says an accusation of domestic abuse w/proof is "Soap Opera News" & he doesn't want to talk about that this a.m.? Mo Brooks is a disgrace!  I don't recognize our country anymore.

806111147774578688 2016-12-06 12:20:49 UTC <Divan757> @mike_pence @Morning_Joe Is Willie Geist conducting the interview? That's the only reason I'll switch over from @NewDay to watch it.
805820349627695105 2016-12-05 17:05:17 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers The look on your face said: "Either they don't know, it don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the 'hood."
804110058497908736 2016-11-30 23:49:12 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe This was my fav a.m show & it's sad I just can't watch anymore. It's like a spin-off of Fox & Friends. Switched to @NewDay
803638131035697152 2016-11-29 16:33:55 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC @bobbychaconjr1 Go for it.
803638022809993216 2016-11-29 16:33:30 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC @bobbychaconjr1 And that is your opinion. My point is it's protected by the 1st Amendment so if DT wants to amend the Constitution...
803636444828987392 2016-11-29 16:27:13 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC @bobbychaconjr1 Folks can wave the Confederate Flag, I don't like it but I can't stop it. That's their right thus the 1st Amendment.
803635821031161856 2016-11-29 16:24:45 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC @bobbychaconjr1 It's called Freedom Of Speech. Doesn't matter to me if it BO or DT, if you're wrong you're wrong.
803616622162235392 2016-11-29 15:08:27 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC It's the Constitution. It's called Freedom Of Speech. You can't pick & choose the parts you like, you know like The Bible.
803591565952303104 2016-11-29 13:28:53 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Burning the American Flag is right? No, but waving the Confederate Flag isn't either but it's the 1st Amendment. Geesh.
803431563983814656 2016-11-28 02:53:06 UTC <Divan757> @TaraSetmayer But @KellyannePolls tweeted a pic a few moments ago saying  "working hard w/DT tonite" so she knows he's tweeting right?
803009956874108928 2016-11-27 22:57:47 UTC <Divan757> @SymoneDSanders This is such an embarassment. The entire world is laughing at us...
803008205265641472 2016-11-27 22:50:49 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump The American people having to beg you to stop whining & making false allegations via social media speaks volumes.
802641351154274304 2016-11-26 22:33:05 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers It's impossible. He acts on instinct not forethought so how could anyone prepare him...Praying for our country.
802305274916859905 2016-11-25 00:17:38 UTC <Divan757> @JoyAnnReid Pllz follow-up on this story. You are one of the few journalists we know will push the truth! Thanks for keeping it real Joy!
801584470100951040 2016-11-23 00:33:25 UTC <Divan757> @thehill DJT: "Making America Great Again" one shady deal after another but Rs say "Nothing to see here...move along." Flunkies.
801485424422223873 2016-11-23 17:59:50 UTC <Divan757> @JoyAnnReid A Surgeon with no Housing or Redevelopment experience? But he just said he wasn't qualified to serve? Oh my bad, he's Black.
801399805956259840 2016-11-23 12:19:37 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC Wow, a UN Ambassador with no FP experience? Just like electing a man with no political exp??? You wanted it America, deal with it!
800331940498984960 2016-11-20 13:36:18 UTC <Divan757> @nbcsnl @realDonaldTrump This is a deflection=Taking focus off Trump U lawsuit, controversial cabinet appointments, press pool suppression!
800077184752816132 2016-11-19 20:44:00 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers Again, this is yet another distraction to take the focus off Trump U, blockiing press pools, & controversial cabinet pix
799990047202230272 2016-11-19 14:57:45 UTC <Divan757> @cnnbrk This is a distraction! Focus on Trump U settlement, blocking press pool, foreign leaders encouraged to use Trump hotels? Wake Up!!!
799270589835988992 2016-11-17 15:18:53 UTC <Divan757> @KellyannePolls @Morning_Joe The ? is, is America ready??? We see how he acts when he doesn't get his way. We should all be afraid.
799100800618348545 2016-11-16 04:04:12 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @kylegriffin1 "We" made the right choice, as for the "Trumpists", well as the old saying goes Laugh now, cry later...

797263431174946816 2016-11-11 02:23:09 UTC <Divan757> @nypost @MicheleBachmann WWJD? Oh I know, pick on people that aren't bothering u. So very Christian of you...
797215397707595776 2016-11-11 23:12:17 UTC <Divan757> @politico Of course he did, we're not naive! He was the sounding board for Trump now he'll assume his place in the cabinet as planned.
797214361844613120 2016-11-11 23:08:10 UTC <Divan757> @VanityFair As he should, if Trump can be President why can't Cosby resume his career?
797161003276386304 2016-11-11 19:36:08 UTC <Divan757> @HallieJackson @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @Reince I need more popcorn, can't wait to see this play out. Dems don't worry, just sit back & watch
797055630850793473 2016-11-11 12:37:25 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe I can see the diversity here...smh
795753054951899136 2016-11-07 22:21:27 UTC <Divan757> @thehill "Will whites?"
795695897791365120 2016-11-07 18:34:20 UTC <Divan757> @ananavarro I said it before & I'll say it again, You're my SHE-RO!!!
795585606705381377 2016-11-07 11:16:04 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe @VickieVicks1 Wow, a whopping 3mins about the emails now talking about the polls again?
795585170728452096 2016-11-07 11:14:20 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe @irishomama Totally biased? Ohio 2 polls with DT leading by 1 shhhhh but the HRC lead by 4 is margin of error?
795583899506212864 2016-11-07 11:09:17 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe So you're not going to lead off with the FBI news right? You are doing a disservice to your loyal viewers. Switching to CNN.
795096014478786560 2016-11-05 02:50:36 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC DT plays the media AGAIN! The focus was on HRC/Katy Perry & he couldn't  handle it like last nite w/Jay-Z & Beyonce. STAGED!!!
794859941098061824 2016-11-05 11:12:32 UTC <Divan757> @joshbhaskell @SarahHuckabee @grouch_ass @BobbyfromBklyn Who was talking to you? Just a random 1am tweet? I know who you're voting for! LOL

794730315461828608 2016-11-04 02:37:27 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @SarahHuckabee EPIC FAIL!!! Clearly she knows nothing about black culture, just embarrassed herself trying to call out HRC.
794729035817512960 2016-11-04 02:32:22 UTC <Divan757> @SarahHuckabee @joshbhaskell We call him that! Jay-Z, Jay, Jigga, J-Hovah, Sean  Carter? Stick to what you know 'cause you look foolish.
794248013837434884 2016-11-03 18:40:57 UTC <Divan757> @MariaTCardona Is she talking to her husband? Charity starts at home.
794153139301744640 2016-11-03 12:23:57 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC The Native Americans have suffered enough! Stop arguing about politics & LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE! Country over Party for once!
794020595847593984 2016-11-02 03:37:16 UTC <Divan757> @VanJones68 asks What about the Central Park 5? Totally ignored. That's what the other side does not understand. We are not invisible.
793950118835875840 2016-11-02 22:57:13 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @KatyTurNBC Why is this not headline news like the GOP ofc incident in NC? This is straight BS!
793776448691634176 2016-11-02 11:27:07 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe Still no news on 28% of Rs in FL early vote for HRC? Daily flashbacks of your beloved GOP FL days but no word today huh?
793450887062650881 2016-11-01 13:53:27 UTC <Divan757> @nytimes Unlike DT: insulted Gold Star families, disabled reporter, Miss Universe, Mexicans, AA, & Let's not forget Grab 'em by the p*ssy!

793430271517425664 2016-11-01 12:31:32 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers on Ken Starr supporting HRC, Take that, take that Jeffrey Lord! Great P Diddy throwback!
793421945987559424 2016-11-01 11:58:27 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC No DT tax dodging, rape trial, University & racketeering cases, GOP Senator Burr "word play" on shooting HRC? Thanks Mika & Joe...
793420774673637381 2016-11-01 11:53:48 UTC <Divan757> @NewDay Looking at both @MSNBC & @NEWDAY this a.m. All MJ is negative HRC & emails, @CNN is fairly reporting on both her & DT issues.

793293661538750464 2016-10-31 03:28:42 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC There's a 24hr news cycle enough time to discuss the issues of both cand. not just hammer the same story. That's being "unbiased".

788146696874229760 2016-10-17 22:36:30 UTC <Divan757> @CNN @realDonaldTrump Some people say she closes the interview with the phrase, "When they go low, we go high"! #BillyBushMadeMeDoIt
788141971181363200 2016-10-17 22:17:43 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers Boy talk? A reporter egged on a 60yr old "man"? He's been a misogynist all his life! #BillyBushMadeMeDoIt

786779874279170048 2016-10-13 04:05:14 UTC <Divan757> Coming from a man who has 5 children by 3 diff wives, telling someone else how to love their husband! Best last words ever. @Bakari_Sellers

783669505671176193 2016-10-05 14:05:44 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC While DT brags about beating the tax system & Pence talks about "whipping out that Mexican thing". Where's the reporting on that?
783660567600959488 2016-10-05 13:30:13 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump Maybe you can learn a few things from Pence, he definitely performed better than you.

781530298135838720 2016-09-29 16:25:17 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @RawStory Again, she's offended at HRC comm ad with his voice but not offended DT said the words? What an idiot!
781343570074734592 2016-09-28 04:03:18 UTC <Divan757> @Betsy_McCaughey @Bakari_Sellers @Montel_Williams She's not offended by DT words but offended by an ad playing his  voice saying the words?
781207202187120640 2016-09-28 19:01:25 UTC <Divan757> @CNN More talk of Kaepernick but 0 coverage regarding the Nazi dressed lawyer who shot 9 people in Houston? Typical.
781166398915678208 2016-09-28 16:19:17 UTC <Divan757> @CNNgo @CNN Michelle is a great role model. Maybe she should pose naked like Melina and where is she? DT can't even bring her out the closet

780582459645825025 2016-09-26 01:38:55 UTC <Divan757> @SymoneDSanders Yes.
780580043193974786 2016-09-26 01:29:19 UTC <Divan757> @TaraSetmayer I think the "Temperament" argument has flown out the window along with DT ego!
780578960694476800 2016-09-26 01:25:01 UTC <Divan757> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Sorry, He's getting his butt kicked!

780257827608793088 2016-09-25 04:08:57 UTC <Divan757> @CNNTonight @CNN @AndreBauerSC @Montel_Williams Wasn't funny at all. DT is rubbing off on his supporters. Very disappointed not surprised
779409404240228356 2016-09-23 19:57:37 UTC <Divan757> @JoyAnnReid What a coward!
779145752811569152 2016-09-22 02:29:57 UTC <Divan757> @PatMcCroryNC @realDonaldTrump Have you contacted the family who lost their Husband, Father, and Son? I mean, since you're announcing things
778741608241999873 2016-09-21 23:44:02 UTC <Divan757> @thehill Why is this news? Corrupt Bridgegate Chris Christie? Hilarious!!!
778611837197754368 2016-09-21 15:08:22 UTC <Divan757> @CNN @Robert37373737 Goodbye. Only a coward hides behind a green background.
778610818699132929 2016-09-21 15:04:19 UTC <Divan757> @CNN @Robert37373737 That's your opinion and you are entitled to it as am I. I don't need an "egg" preaching to me. Thanks.
778604166809804800 2016-09-21 14:37:53 UTC <Divan757> @CNN @Robert37373737 Is he dead? He actually shot 2 but was shooting at many officers?  I was addressing race not procedure but I digress...
778603526708756480 2016-09-21 14:35:21 UTC <Divan757> @CNN @Robert37373737 What was done when the terrorist in NJ shot at 2 officers?
778573385643220993 2016-09-21 12:35:34 UTC <Divan757> @CNN You all keep posting this and again I say AND? It's not a matter of racism, it's police using lethal force when it's unwarranted.
778571292844974080 2016-09-21 12:27:16 UTC <Divan757> @cnnbrk So??? Why is this relevant?
777941389690736640 2016-09-19 18:44:15 UTC <Divan757> @JoyAnnReid @leezeldin It means a suspected terrorist was apprehended wo dying but Black men who die for selling CDs deserved it...Idiot.
776930570626539521 2016-09-16 23:47:37 UTC <Divan757> @CNN This is how u "Make America Great Again", by disarming the security detail of a candidate & suggest violence against her #Deplorables

776809450028097536 2016-09-16 15:46:19 UTC <Divan757> @SymoneDSanders @seanspicer @realDonaldTrump He just played the MSM like a fiddle! Promoted his hotel, got free airtime for Vet endorsements
776808688040501248 2016-09-16 15:43:18 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @politico He just played the MSM! You all looked like fools!

776105740176097280 2016-09-14 17:10:02 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers The American people are being conned by DT! No talk about the FLA AG, the Newsweek article, taxes, Trump Foundation or U?
775896904077086720 2016-09-13 03:20:12 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump Why aren't PaPa Bush & W campaigning for you. They are free all day long. That should be your question. Ha!
775865662476517376 2016-09-13 01:16:03 UTC <Divan757> @TheLastWord @JoyAnnReid Bring It Joy! The Trump Campaign is the gift that keeps on giving! #BasketOfDeplorables
775504885504761856 2016-09-12 01:22:27 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump Well there goes that  "imaginary" basket again. Let's see how this plays out #Deplorables
775445655707877377 2016-09-12 21:27:06 UTC <Divan757> @CNN And he is reprimanding HRC "basket" comment but he refuses to say DT should apologize for any of the things he's said. NOT ONE THING???
775385975581179904 2016-09-12 17:29:57 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump @politico Goodbye 1st Amendment. The media cannot let this slide. This is nonsensical & quite frankly scary. Dictator DT.
775384965357924352 2016-09-12 17:25:56 UTC <Divan757> @CNN Well there goes Freedom of Religion & free speech. I'm a Christian but that's my CHOICE...He can't be this stupid.
775381956905304065 2016-09-12 17:13:59 UTC <Divan757> @CNN And your supporters laugh when you say you could shoot someone & not lose a vote or disrespect AA & Hispanics but I guess that's ok.
775380150041075712 2016-09-12 17:06:48 UTC <Divan757> @DavidCornDC This man is unbelievable! He has never apologized nor retracted anything he's said in 18Ms but HRC should drop out now? WOW!
775358622222127104 2016-09-12 15:41:15 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe @MSNBC DT has used demeaning lang. to describe women, Muslims, judges, AA, Hispanics, the media & gets away with it? Oh ok.
775083667832053760 2016-09-11 21:28:41 UTC <Divan757> @thehill Why is this news? He's not saying anything about it so the media wants to bait him for news coverage. Typical...

774731284585349121 2016-09-10 22:08:26 UTC <Divan757> @PRyan Yesterday you wouldn't comment on DT's "birther" comments but you came out of your hole to remark on HRC? You sir are a hypocrite..
774685752877690880 2016-09-10 19:07:31 UTC <Divan757> @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump A man you can bait with a tweet! You go girl! #ImWithHer

773556271916150785 2016-09-07 16:19:21 UTC <Divan757> @CNNPolitics Did DT just mention enforcement of "unpaid taxes"? This from the man who won't release his OWN taxes to the public?
773230545513881600 2016-09-06 18:45:02 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC I am still waiting for DT to stop rambling & answer ONE question. And Hillary is talking policy but he gets all the free air time.
773226517606363136 2016-09-06 18:29:02 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC So is The General going to feed DT answers tomorrow night & during the debates? I haven't heard him give one clean policy statement.
773183642197688320 2016-09-06 15:38:40 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump But I'm glad they are finally starting to cover your PAY FOR PLAY with the FLA & TX AGs & IRS fines for illegal donations!
772103617876791296 2016-09-03 16:07:02 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers @alexburnsNYT Who wants to bet Bishop Jackson will endorse DT within the next week? I'm not swayed because I'm not a FOOL.
772101870819180544 2016-09-03 16:00:05 UTC <Divan757> @thehill Bishop Jackson just said yesterday DT was not allowed to speak to his congregation but now he's up speaking & quoting scripture?
772100785215770624 2016-09-03 15:55:46 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC Bishop Jackson just said on @CNN yesterday that DT was not allowed to speak at his church. We've all been played. #SETUP
771019748335296518 2016-08-31 16:20:07 UTC <Divan757> @Bakari_Sellers Trump "drops everything" to go to Mexico hours before immigration speech...took 14 months to meet with "The Blacks". Hmmm...
769530098492071936 2016-08-27 13:40:47 UTC <Divan757> @realDonaldTrump This is just sad & predictable. And you wonder why "the blacks" won't vote for you? We see right through you, just sick.
769133783618555904 2016-08-26 11:25:58 UTC <Divan757> @Morning_Joe @MSNBC Where is the substance? Why are journalists "bad" if they press to get answers to ?s all he did was dodge & "preach".
768623137999220736 2016-08-24 01:36:51 UTC <Divan757> @TaraSetmayer We have different political views but I RESPECT you for your honesty. If we hear about Mar-a-lago one more time... #AC360

766761275896565761 2016-08-19 22:18:28 UTC <Divan757> @cnnbrk OMG! Did he just talk down to All Black people as if we are all ignorant & poor?That "garbage" of a speech he just gave in Michigan.
766757064848842752 2016-08-19 22:01:44 UTC <Divan757> @MSNBC Did he just yell at Black voters like he's on a plantation? To let him describe us, we are all the lowest scum on the earth? WTH?
766673806811402241 2016-08-19 16:30:54 UTC <Divan757> @hardball @MSNBC I even set my DVR to record the segment seeing as though @HardballChris is a bear with everyone
