941481138291228672 2017-12-14 01:32:49 UTC <cahartm> @edreas It isn't just the $$ and the inevitability of a myriad ways my bill will be sliced and diced into a hundred "features" at special pricing,  but I also fail to have ANY confidence we will not eventually see variant handling of site specific traffic.
941479228238790656 2017-12-14 01:25:14 UTC <cahartm> @edreas Basically,  a business is OBLIGATED to come up with ways to generate new $$.  In this case,  I don't see that coming from anywhere other than user pockets.
941477656943403009 2017-12-14 01:18:59 UTC <cahartm> @edreas Yes,  true;  that is an eternity in internet time. It certainly does not change the fact that corporations are motivated by shareholder value ($$), and that by no means necessitates an alignment to user interests.
941473722887634944 2017-12-14 01:03:21 UTC <cahartm> @edreas New legislation sounds fine,  but now we've  entered the void of zero regulation.  It will likely be years before any sort of legislative agreements are brokered in Congress.  In that time,  what unchecked actions will be freely advanced by those interests?
