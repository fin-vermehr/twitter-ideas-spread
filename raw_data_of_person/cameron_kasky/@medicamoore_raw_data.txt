955691655184683009 2018-01-22 06:40:21 UTC <medicamoore> @RBReich @MacBitseach I can see the cheers of the uneducated as democracy dies.
955584297485860867 2018-01-22 23:33:45 UTC <medicamoore> I remember when Trent Lott was drummed out for saying a 99 year old senator would have made a good president.  But now.....Trump.
955422163695054848 2018-01-22 12:49:29 UTC <medicamoore> I take the flu shot.  I still get the flu.  This sucks.

954812448128884737 2018-01-20 20:26:41 UTC <medicamoore> @SenSanders Unfortunately there are a lot of uneducated people out there doing it.  We need a greater investment in education.
954709188525068288 2018-01-20 13:36:22 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump You have the majority in both the house and senate and still cannot get anything accopmplished.  Losing!!  #TrumpShutdown

951457290003075072 2018-01-11 14:14:29 UTC <medicamoore> To all the people I know I understand your continued support of Trump. I will never understand your racist views. But I understand.  Sad.
951452257597509633 2018-01-11 13:54:29 UTC <medicamoore> @AtheistRepublic Over dinner and drinks.
950781843502137345 2018-01-09 17:30:30 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump And yet you continue to attack the most prestigious law enforcement agency in the country calling the FBI corrupt.  Such a sad display.
950205658942595072 2018-01-07 03:20:57 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Reagan had the same problem?  So you admit you have Alzheimer's Disease?

947282255675838464 2017-12-30 01:44:24 UTC <medicamoore> @pvponline I always took it as you had to have some basic talent for it.  Some people can't play an instrument.  Others can play anything.
947279953867038720 2017-12-30 01:35:15 UTC <medicamoore> @WilliamShatner I loved your Tekwar series. Any plans to do a reboot or update of it.  Would be great to see it on the big screen.

939850646269972481 2017-12-10 13:33:50 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Thank you President Obama!  We are still riding the high of his policies.  When yours kick in we shall see how things go.
939850245961322496 2017-12-10 13:32:14 UTC <medicamoore> I honestly can see myself being executed for my political and religious beliefs in the US. I never thought I would be scared of life here.
939849195103629313 2017-12-10 13:28:04 UTC <medicamoore> People who I uses to count among my friends are truly beginning to scare me.  Their love of Trump, god and guns is frightening.
939848670501105665 2017-12-10 13:25:59 UTC <medicamoore> A friend of mine told me he would shoot me if I kneeled for the national anthem.  I seem to be losing a lot of friends lately.  #resist

936956662786809857 2017-12-02 13:54:10 UTC <medicamoore> I honestly wonder if this country will wake up or if apathy has finally settled in to the point that no matter what happens this goes on.
935288311131893761 2017-11-27 23:24:44 UTC <medicamoore> @pvponline If it isn't about him then he is lost on what to talk about.  He has the mentality of a five year old.  I am so ashamed of the president.
935286917318488064 2017-11-27 23:19:12 UTC <medicamoore> @AtheistRepublic I think any sort of "religious freedom" that tells me I have to believe a certain way should never be sanctioned. He is correct.
935109210819514369 2017-11-27 11:33:04 UTC <medicamoore> @AtheistRepublic Yes. All religions are horrible.
933397561037160448 2017-11-22 18:11:34 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Why don't you start acting like an adult and not like a 5 year old on the playground.  You have been on about this for days. Get over it.
932968647320129536 2017-11-21 13:47:13 UTC <medicamoore> @TheTakeaway @ShaunKing @Arwa_Gunja Former friends of mine in law enforcement: 1) Fired for running with a drug ring. 2) Fired for child porn. 3) Pulled his pistol on his wife and attempted to kill her during a domestic.  And these were the people I respected at one point.

932673534484254721 2017-11-20 18:14:33 UTC <medicamoore> This was my response to @ShaunKing and the response from the racist alt right Trump lover that continues to cheer on the divide.pic.twitter.com/yuc8gtwyej
932672998439563264 2017-11-20 18:12:25 UTC <medicamoore> @ShaunKing @mrcommentator2 You do realize that Clinton has never been convicted of any crimes and the Benghazi witch hunt turned up nothing?  Beating a dead drum.
932671303399673857 2017-11-20 18:05:41 UTC <medicamoore> @ShaunKing @mrcommentator2 And the right always comes back with the response "but Clinton." She lost. True.  And the corruption of the current administration persists.
932612992721711105 2017-11-20 14:13:59 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Well an educated president would understand the need for the ban.  But when your sons hunt big game you don't want to ruin their weekend.
932607622687154177 2017-11-20 13:52:38 UTC <medicamoore> This is why I am an advocate of education at all levels.  We need to be putting money into education not providing tax cuts for the wealthy.  This way we can eliminate ignorance and maybe one day understand people when they communicate.https://twitter.com/gregos1119/status/932605330491629569

932594899135975425 2017-11-20 13:02:05 UTC <medicamoore> @ShaunKing I cannot wait until sanity comes back to our country.  I truly hope that people have their eyes open watching this and get rid of the GOP.

926227096854294530 2017-11-02 23:18:43 UTC <medicamoore> Hypothetical: They find a gene treatment to cure all violence in humans but it requires surrendering all your guns. Do you do it?
926226523606142976 2017-11-02 23:16:26 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Good job!  Just bias the entire system and make the prosecutions job a lot tougher.  You really need to learn to shut up.

921125244592705536 2017-10-19 21:25:46 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump I didn't realize Fox wasn't covering it. Of course I have a brain so I don't watch fake news like Fox. Aren't you playing golf again?

918890590804340743 2017-10-13 17:26:03 UTC <medicamoore> The longer Trump is in office the more I learn about friends and family I used to respect.  As they continue to support him they scare me.
918862708711219205 2017-10-13 15:35:16 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump As opposed to a president so far to the right I honestly think you would legalize slavery again just to make your base happy.
918799071900520448 2017-10-13 11:22:23 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump Fake news.  The claim of "great" men like Trump, Hitler, Stalin, all the good fascists.  Face it you are a laughingstock.
918797805791121408 2017-10-13 11:17:21 UTC <medicamoore> @AtheistRepublic There is a difference?  A make believe place where people are tortured for not loving a god who does not exist is asinine.
918170772258086912 2017-10-11 17:45:45 UTC <medicamoore> @realDonaldTrump So like all fascist leaders are you suggesting consolidation of media under say Fox Entertainment?
918167019933110272 2017-10-11 17:30:50 UTC <medicamoore> @g1rad Yes. Yes I am. Prayer is talking to someone who doesn't exist and expecting a result that will never happen.
918166271883202561 2017-10-11 17:27:52 UTC <medicamoore> @AtheistRepublic The United States government and it right wing ultra conservative Christian values.  It is like we forgot the lessons of Nazi Germany.

826662951746678784 2017-01-31 05:26:21 UTC <medicamoore> I paid attention in history class. This has all happened before. I never understood how until now. People truly cheer the end of democracy.
826301247233863680 2017-01-30 05:29:03 UTC <medicamoore> Trump's utilizing Bannon the way he has would make Hitler and Goebbels proud.  Welcome the new and improved Nazi party.
825727620566360069 2017-01-29 15:29:40 UTC <medicamoore> @ShaunKing I would fail both tests being an atheist.  I wonder what my penalty would be?  I fully expect to be the target of the Christians.
825727283658895362 2017-01-29 15:28:20 UTC <medicamoore> @StephenKing Unfortunately I expect cruelty from religions based upon violence. Evangelicals care not what Trump does. They celebrate it.
824976247998525441 2017-01-27 13:43:59 UTC <medicamoore> I am seriously baffled by the people who are cheering the police brutality and saying things are good now under Drumpf.  Fascist nation.
824014413313298432 2017-01-24 22:02:00 UTC <medicamoore> @ShaunKing It is not a lie. Sessions' record is an "alternative fact."  In other words it is a hilariously huge lie!!
824012412470919168 2017-01-24 21:54:03 UTC <medicamoore> And this surprises anyone how?  Maximize profit no matter what you have to do. Even if it destroys the environment.  #notmypresidenthttps://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/823937458270302210

823145028528861184 2017-01-22 12:27:22 UTC <medicamoore> People cheering Trump ending all this negative news reporting. Goodbye freedom of the press. Goodbye freedom of speech. #facistnation

805429443061760000 2016-12-04 15:11:58 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 It is ridiculous. My trips to the doctor usually start of with "Have you fallen lately?"
805427731492196352 2016-12-04 15:05:09 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 I find myself doing the same thing.  Trying to do things my mind says I can do but my body says no too.
805425234614620160 2016-12-04 14:55:14 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 It will be the last ditch thing I do.  I have seen too many people go through it and it not help.

805421382779760640 2016-12-04 14:39:56 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 I have resigned myself to the fact I will never be pain free again. I just try to keep it from getting worse.
805417434652045312 2016-12-04 14:24:15 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 I know the feeling there.  As the weather turns cold my back and hips ache so bad I can't sleep either.

805404715005657088 2016-12-04 13:33:42 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 I know the feeling. 550 pound patient on a 170 pound cot and he decided to get comfortable while in the air. :(

805396978955911171 2016-12-04 13:02:57 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 Yeah. I get those "are you crazy" looks.  It is sad that people get pissed off because you care about humanity.
805390810573402112 2016-12-04 12:38:27 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 I have too. I would have never thought the day would come when there were so many hate filled people in healthcare. :(
805388598459695104 2016-12-04 12:29:39 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 It breaks my heart the medical professionals that I work with think he is the second coming.  They honestly love him.
805387920551137280 2016-12-04 12:26:58 UTC <medicamoore> @jimmypagesgirl3 Nope.  They still love him and have high hopes for the future.  Just shows the true failure of the educational system.
