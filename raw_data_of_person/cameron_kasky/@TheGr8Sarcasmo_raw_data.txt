To be humble. To be honest. To be loyal. To do the right thing, always, & take responsibility for your actions. That's the point. Gender & sexuality don't factor into whether you are a man.

Good. But, if they're straight actors posing for a picture, they can't be real men? Even if they meet all of the character requirements we've discussed, this pose keeps them from manhood?

I think you need to reevaluate the situation, and understand who is using traditional weak, macho insults against sexuality in order to attempt to insult someone. It'd be cute, if it wasn't so pathetic.
971816967379316737 2018-03-08 18:36:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @tbrady960 @Inspectjavert @azmwhite Chivalrous behavior has nothing to do with machismo. Neither is competitiveness. Or being strong.   Machismo is bragging about being strong. Boasting about your wins. Degrading and insulting women. Real men don't do those things, because real men don't need to.
971816261469593600 2018-03-08 18:33:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CallMyForest A man, a real man, puts his family before himself. Because a real man isn't egotistical.   I'm not disparaging men, I'm disparaging adult boys.   And yes, these all apply to both sexes, a female who has these character traits is called a woman.    Care to try again?
971815262914863110 2018-03-08 18:29:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @tbrady960 @Inspectjavert @azmwhite So...by your own definition trump isn't a man.   You don't have to be macho to love sports. Machismo is an overly aggressive fascination with stereotypically masculine ideals. Think of it as frat boy mentality.
971814367779082240 2018-03-08 18:26:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @Inspectjavert @azmwhite I'm not disagreeing that school is more intense  now than it was a few decades ago.

971718065535770624 2018-03-08 12:03:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @azmwhite @Inspectjavert So...typical child behavior? As a father with a son and a daughter I can assure you, those stereotypical traits can apply to both sexes.

971715988294131712 2018-03-08 11:55:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @FakeMalFunction @azmwhite I have both a girl and a boy. Both in grade school. You think sitting in a chair for 8 hours is typical girl behavior?

The traits you listed are what defines masculinity. What being a man truly is. And they can apply to the men in that picture you despise, or your husband, equally.

To put himself second, and to be loyal husband. To be an attentive father. Those are the only rgongs that matter. Not who he loves, how he walks, talks, or dresses. Character makes a man.

971589459379617793 2018-03-07 03:32:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @trumps_feed @TuckerCarlson I wonder how many of you confuse machismo for masculinity.

Being a loyal husband & attentive father?

971086473800880129 2018-03-06 18:13:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Banning Semi Auto firearms is constitutional, and even during that time none were confiscated from anyone's home. It is fear mongering by the NRA and other right wing nuts who use that fear to keep people on their side and buying more guns. It's a sales tactic.
971086095827062784 2018-03-06 18:12:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Right...this is the issue. Making it mandatory, and making it law, would mean penalties for not registering.
971085543051350016 2018-03-06 18:10:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 No...these are gun traces. Different than background checks. They are traces on who owns a gun, where it was sold, etc. typically requested by law enforcement agencies. Keeping a registry is not unconstitutional. Nor is anything I've stated.
971082686101184513 2018-03-06 17:58:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I got the quote here https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-is-an-accidental-shooting-really-a-crime/. However, I could point you to several cases here in Indiana that are similar. This one, for example, happened relatively close to where my extended family lives.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/walmart-shooting-accident-woman-injured_n_5401191.html
971081519128342528 2018-03-06 17:54:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 The "fear" of confiscation is ridiculous for law abiding people. However, if you are someone who is a domestic abuser, for example, cops would know you had guns, and be able to confiscate them. Thereby keeping people safe.
971080627553538048 2018-03-06 17:50:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 If we made it a law to register/title guns, like we do with cars, I'm sure some would refuse, but most would comply. Because most people follow the law. And since most weapons used for illegal purposes are initially bought legally, or stolen, we would better be able to track them
971079889502732289 2018-03-06 17:47:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Currently all FFL are required by the ATF to submit sales records. The ATF gets 1,000 requests for gun traces each day, however federal law requires dealer records to be non-searchable. Keyword searches, or sorting by date or any other field, are strictly prohibited. Why?
971054331784056832 2018-03-06 16:06:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I believe this needs to change. Not sure why you would be against the last 3 either. A registry and searchable database would aid police in solving crimes, and research would just help us gain information and understand the causes and solution to gun violence.
971053937930403841 2018-03-06 16:04:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Background checks required for all gun sales. No exceptions.  Unfortunately, accidental misfires are not. "An accidental discharge of a firearm causing death, even if the result of gross negligence cannot be prosecuted criminally," Florida State Attorney Brad King.
971044724713943048 2018-03-06 15:27:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I would agree on those. Can we also agree we should close all background check loopholes, make accidental misfires which harm other people felonies, create a searchable database & registry of gun purchases, & allowing research into the effects of guns and gun control?

970749476922183682 2018-03-05 19:54:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 The 20 proposals I laid out won;t be popular, and they might be difficult, but over time they would change the access to these weapons. They would change the culture surrounding guns. And they would save lives. Which is what matters the most.
970749130388791298 2018-03-05 19:53:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I'm sure it'd be fun. I have also been shooting for a long time. Southern Indiana kids typically get into it young, and I know a little about guns. Doesn't change the fact this country has a gun problem.
970745576051658752 2018-03-05 19:39:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 You seem to be using Hollow Point as an umbrella term, for any expanding ammunition. Whereas I am not. There are several types of ammunition that fall under "expanding."
970745011557068801 2018-03-05 19:37:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I have. Typically, to be honest, I rely on the knowledge I already have based on the research I've done in the past. However, in the case of Hollow Points I looked into what you said, I could possible concede HPs, but I can't let a blatant falsehood stand.
970739716600590337 2018-03-05 19:15:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 So...your argument is that gun manufacturers found & exploited loopholes? And a new weapons ban would have to close those loopholes? I agree. During the weapons ban you could buy a Colt Match Target Rifle...but you couldn't buy an AR15. Your argument is semantics & desperate.
970735194654298113 2018-03-05 18:58:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 And? They couldn't hold it...anywhere else? Seems if they really believed the shit they're selling they would have held CPAC in a gun-friendly area and everyone would have been armed. Right?
970734855150587906 2018-03-05 18:56:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Also, I can't find a single state that REQUIRES HP rounds for hunting. It just says they are legal to hunt with. Though some states require expanding ammunition, Hollow Points are not the only option. You never did address armor-piercing, incendiary, or other rounds.
970732180338069504 2018-03-05 18:46:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I understand why someone would want to use HP bullets. However, I'm not asking you what you would prefer. You said you could tell me why banning them would be unconstitutional, already law, or wouldn't work.
970730862055739392 2018-03-05 18:40:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 I will concede I was wrong on whether HPs are banned for sale in NJ. They're restricted, but not outright banned. Otherwise, I've been spot on. And I have yet to hear any argument from you that would prove any of the proposals are unconstitutional, already law, or wouldn't work.
970730337419579402 2018-03-05 18:38:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 As for HPs and Mag size I addressed both. However, your tactic seems to be one of introducing new points into the argument and then debating those, as opposed to the 20 proposals which I laid out. You have yet to prove one is unconstitutional, already law, or wouldn't work.
970729914197561344 2018-03-05 18:37:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 No, I wasn't. As I stated, the AWB was a ban on the manufacture and sale of NEW firearms which fell under the AWB. There were loopholes, but they could be closed. You are wrong on Dickey, I suggest, once again, that you read more about it and it's affects on research.
970729452048142339 2018-03-05 18:35:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 An AR15 manufactured before 1994 was still legal to own and resell. However, new ones could not be manufactured. Which is why I said "a ban on the sale of NEW weapons. Here is the entire bill. Read it. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr4296/text There were loopholes, but we could close them.

970406387741347840 2018-03-04 21:11:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Lol...no. I said several types of ammo, including HP should be banned, and Dickey should be repealed. You haven't explained why either are already laws, couldn't be done, or are unconstitutional. So far, you're flailing.
970405821699026949 2018-03-04 21:09:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 A) I never said they were illegal in NJ for hunting.  B) You're talking state regulations, I'm talking federal.

Banning the sale of semi-automatic, magazine fed guns means they aren't readily available. Meaning these shooters, who buy their guns legally, or steal them from people who bought them legally, no longer have access to them. Then, waiting periods, stricter bg checks, etc...
969641266521825280 2018-03-02 18:31:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Mompreneur_of_3 @MichelleTrain79 @notastalker_uR @AdamChristoFL Sure. but alcohol is easy to make, and the ingredients are readily available. I doubt there are going to be a bunch of bathtub semi-automatic rifles, ammunition, and accessories for them. Especially if we still have other guns. Because, I never said "ban all guns." Just some.
969640288707891200 2018-03-02 18:27:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Mompreneur_of_3 @MichelleTrain79 @notastalker_uR @AdamChristoFL Since most weapons used in mass shooting are purchased legally, we can, in a way, decide which weapons they use. By banning the sale of these weapons in the future, we limit the number of them available. And most people, even bad ones, don't know where to buy black market guns.
969639734296371201 2018-03-02 18:25:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Again, not looking for your opinion. Also, you need to read up on the Dickey Amendment past the talking points you've been fed.
969639508504403969 2018-03-02 18:24:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 And? I'm not looking for your opinion. I'm looking for you to tell me why it is unconstitutional, already a law, or won't work. Also, Hollow points are not required for hunting by all state laws. But if you want to play that game, some states already ban the sale of Hollow Points
969638346917076992 2018-03-02 18:19:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 The only one attempting to conflate the two, is you. I said "extended magazines." However I would extend that to magazines with a capacity of over 10 rounds. Bump stocks and silencers are still legal. I propose making then illegal to sell or purchase going forward.
969637623420674050 2018-03-02 18:16:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 These weapons have been banned in the past. A ban on the sale of new weapons fitting these descriptions in the future would not be unconstitutional.
969637137422405632 2018-03-02 18:14:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mrduffy3 Its funny when you ask a question, I give it, then you resort to logical fallacy in your response and try to undermine the response. Kind of pathetic. This response took 5 minutes to write out, off the top of my head, because I know the material. It probably will take you longer.
969636368476405764 2018-03-02 18:11:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 Ahhh...but that, again, is where we need to look at the intent in the hearts and minds of men. Do the designers of scissors, rope, or hammers desire to make their product as deadly as possible? No. While gun manufacturers try their hardest to make their product kill humans.
969635838479994881 2018-03-02 18:09:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 You argue from a singular perspective, rather than taking into account the rest of the world. Pure solipsism. The point is, you want a gun in case you need to kill with it, so you want them made readily available for anyone to use against anyone else.
969634339213533185 2018-03-02 18:03:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing I'm a little behind on beer gossip lately...but what is all this now?

Because unlike those other objects, guns were made to kill, and do it easily.
969260316189184001 2018-03-01 17:17:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 Sure...but to ignore what the gun was designed to do, to ignore its purpose in this world, is to be willfully ignorant of the point. Using a gun to kill is using it according to its intended purpose and its singular function.
969257974693810178 2018-03-01 17:08:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> this is my shocked face https://twitter.com/vicenews/status/969239484381483008

But motive doesn't matter when it comes to what the gun does, what it is designed for, or what it is used for. Fact is, guns are deadly in anyones hands. Because they are designed to be as deadly as possible.
969256821021081601 2018-03-01 17:03:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 As far as the gun, and it's use, is concerned...there is no difference. In each scenario it is doing exactly what it was designed to do. Kill. Whether the gun is used by a a murderer, soldier, homeowner, etc. The moment someone picks it up, the end goal is the same. Death.
969226932612198400 2018-03-01 15:04:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So, there are 20...for a start. There is no magic solution to ending all gun violence. No law will prevent every killer. But the proposals I have listed would save lives. A lot of lives. But even if they saved just 1 single life, I'd say they were worth it.
969226930963836928 2018-03-01 15:04:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 18) Strengthening background checks. 19) Increase waiting period on all gun sales. 20) Increase spending on mental health research and not allowing gun sales to anyone who has been reported for suicidal/homicidal reasons.
969226929739059200 2018-03-01 15:04:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 16) Holding gun manufacturers responsible for designing and marketing guns which facilitate mass slaughter. 17) Removing guns from, and ending sale of guns to, domestic abusers. (Already a law, this would strengthen it, and close loopholes in it)
969226928292093953 2018-03-01 15:04:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 14) Required background checks for all gun sales, ending all loopholes. 15) Sale of a gun privately requires paperwork be filed showing who bought, who sold, etc. This paperwork needs filed within 2 weeks of sale.
969226926647857152 2018-03-01 15:04:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 12) Stiffening punishments for parents who leave guns unsecured around children. 13) Before purchasing a gun you need to demonstrate proper handling and understanding of the safety rules.
969226923405664256 2018-03-01 15:04:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 8) End lifetime gun licenses. 9) All new gun licenses would require written test, safety test, and skills test. 10) Licenses would need regular renewal in order to stay valid. 11) Making accidental misfires resulting in injury or death a felony.
969226921950285824 2018-03-01 15:04:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 7) Requiring guns be registered in a national database. This would requite guns be titled, and the sale of these weapons would need title transfer, registration with regular renewal, and insurance.
969226920062746624 2018-03-01 15:04:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 4) Repeal the Dickey Amendment. 5) Enact federal age restrictions for all gun ownership. 6) Imposing regulations on how & where guns can be advertised, similar to tobacco and alcohol.
969226918624157696 2018-03-01 15:04:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> 1) A ban on the sale of semi-automatic, magazine fed, rifles and handguns. 2) A ban on the sale of extended magazines, bump stocks, and silencers. 3) A ban on armor piercing ammo, hollow points, & Teflon coated bullets.
969226916887715840 2018-03-01 15:04:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Sure I'll play...but know the funny thing about laws is that they can change. Constitutions can be amended. And anything can work if done correctly. So, let's go (Thread) #GunReformNow #Guns #2Amendment #GunControl #GunDebate #2A #Parkland #NRAhttps://twitter.com/mrduffy3/status/969205898580234241

Murder, accidental misfire, war, hunting, defense...doesn't matter. Gun manufacturers ensure guns are equally deadly in all scenarios. Their use is to kill. Doesn't matter how, or by whom.
969212027423133697 2018-03-01 14:05:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pixelatedboat @SEIFFERTOVAL One cool thing about wooden floors/walls is the fact that they are 100% impenetrable to bullets, 100% fire proof, and 100% impervious to tanks.
969209221446291457 2018-03-01 13:54:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Three things.  1) I call bullshit. 2) The blatant racism of saying "the judge is siding with the law even though he's Mexican" just proves if he hadn't ruled in favor you would have discounted his ruling because of his heritage.  3) This is embarrassing even for Fox standards. https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/968908190778785792

But scissors manufacturers are not sitting at the drawing board developing ways to make them more deadly. Ensuring that they are more likely to take life. Guns are instruments of death by design.
968871189690142722 2018-02-28 15:31:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JomaChameleon Now...imagine this was snakes.
968869635507589121 2018-02-28 15:24:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @thehill Sure...as long as we adopt real, comprehensive sex education, make birth control cheap and accessible, start holding boys as accountable as girls, and so on. We could really do a lot to cut down on abortion...which declines every year.
968662481915797505 2018-02-27 01:41:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 Sure, they ARE used for that purpose. But that isn't their SOLE purpose. They are used in cooking, medical uses, tools, etc. A gun kills. It has no other purpose.
968659616761597953 2018-02-27 01:30:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @LouHarry @mrduffy3 But no matter what it's used for, it was designed with one, singular purpose...to kill. It was designed to kill efficiently. It was designed to be easily modified to kill efficiently in any combat situation. We shold regulate them and their manufacturers far, far more than we do.
968658518084669440 2018-02-27 01:26:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 Same can be said about knives. This argument is a giant logical fallacy. It lacks reason.
968658090374631424 2018-02-27 01:24:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @probbins4 @MCampbell1041 Trucks are designed to transport people, and vehicles are regulated with safety standards to keep people safe. It was a person using something in a way in which it was not intended to be used. Guns were designed to kill. Using one to kill is using it exactly how it was intended.
968657205980467202 2018-02-27 01:20:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @LibertarianJedi No offense, but this argument is ludicrously stupid.
968656981128032257 2018-02-27 01:19:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Plus, most other countries don't have the mass shooting problems, or indeed the gun violence problems, which plague the US. Yet, they all have the music, movies, & video games we do. The difference is guns, the culture surrounding them, their availability, & how they're marketed
968656522489233408 2018-02-27 01:18:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul I disagree on this, to an extent. When looming at these mass shootings we look for what they had in common. What experience, family life, medical history, etc. One thing is the AR15. Why did they all choose this gun?
967862830509821952 2018-02-25 20:44:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony @BustedKnuckleDD Literally gave you everything you need, Dev. You're denying it because it hurts your brain. Because it goes against what you want to believe. Look it up, kiddo.

967860782770851840 2018-02-25 20:36:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony @BustedKnuckleDD Except that it does. Again...history. I've given you all the information you need to do the research and see the facts. But I'm not going to play this game where I'm arguing against a perspective from ignorance and denial of historical context. Read more, then come back.
967859749386678272 2018-02-25 20:32:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DCComics @ApexHyperion Hollow earth now? DC has gotten weird.

A fact given without context, or one used to spin a false narrative, is intellectually dishonest. The claim an AR15 isnt an "assault rifle" simply because it isn't fully automatic is an intellectually dishonest statement which ignores all of the other factors.
967858210995691520 2018-02-25 20:25:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony @BustedKnuckleDD Google Patrick Henry. Then read some history books on the Georgia statutes requiring plantation owners to be part of the miltia, how they got Virginia's vote, and use some historical context. Im not your encyclopedia.
967853136927961089 2018-02-25 20:05:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony @BustedKnuckleDD That's not news, it's historically accurate information. Read a book sometime, sonny.

But this debate has a lot of misinformation, red herrings, & straw men, typically utilized by conservatives in order to distract from/derail a conversation to one that is more easily defensible. Your point wasn't intellectually honest, & it needed addressed.
967806647358849024 2018-02-25 17:01:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony @BustedKnuckleDD No, I said it was written "IN PART" to preserve slavery. Which it was. Look it up.
967805813032210435 2018-02-25 16:57:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DCComics @ApexHyperion Got it. Is this a "planet with a red sun" situation, or a kryptonite/magical one? Secondary question, why is WW riding a horse? Can she not fly anymore either?
967804629101830144 2018-02-25 16:52:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @betomo_17 Not sure why you tagged me in this. You may have me mistaken with someone who cares what the NRA says.
967804121054089216 2018-02-25 16:50:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @piersmorgan Sometimes I really dislike Piers Morgan and think he's a complete chode...but I'll be damned if there aren't an equal number of times I agree with, like, or even respect him. What I'm saying is he'd be a fun guy to have a beer with. Even though he's still a chode.

That's it. And that can be overcome with legal modifications. So stop playing the semantics game. It's transparent logical fallacy.pic.twitter.com/OMQT73dvKq

967253720835780611 2018-02-23 04:23:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @BrentScher @glenn_wofford Again, if we treat guns like cars, I don't think 50 state reciprocity would be an issue. Just using the laws, regulations, etc. which are consistent across all 50 states. Agreed?

I said I'm OK with that, as long as we treat guns like we do cars, then listed a few examples. You played straw man on safety inspections. Now, can we agree we should treat guns like cars?

B) we already do restrict which cars are street legal vs track legal. Can't drive an f1 car to work. C) still don't think you have much of a point.

I'll do the same with AR15s. Then, look at what we do ro prevent both. Wanna compare numbers?
967228892942610432 2018-02-23 02:45:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @DDBoarman @glenn_wofford Guns are unsafe. I wouldn't let a toddler drive my car, would you let one play with your gun? Guns can, and do, accidentally misfire injuring or killing people in public places. To say "guns areally not unsafe" goes against all intelligent thought.
967228372031066113 2018-02-23 02:43:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @wtf_trading @glenn_wofford Glad to see the correction. Death numbers are simular for cars and guns, btw. Only difference is we do everything we can to make cars safe for drivers, pedestrians, and other drivers.
967227905259515905 2018-02-23 02:41:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @Rob_AT54 @glenn_wofford How is it moving goalposts? You're comparing cars to guns. You can't drive any car on the road. There are safety standards. Some sYates require emissions testing also. So saying a gun would have to also undergo safety testing is directly in line with the conparison. Try harder.

However, there are usually restrictions for 16 year olds for the first year or so on passengers and all that.

967201475297505280 2018-02-23 00:56:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @NRA And maybe we should look at how guns are marketed, the culture surrounding them, what kinds of guns we sell, their purpose in the 21st century, how the world has changed since 1787, and why we need gun reform?

There is a skills test and a written test required to obtain a license. Cars are registered with annual renewal. And there are saget standards. Cars are designed to minimize death.
967172656352153600 2018-02-23 23:01:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @DDBoarman Nope...which is why we have laws saying cars need air bags, seatbelts, child seat latches, crumple zones, crash safety testing, etc. We make cars as safe as we possibly can and we hold manufacturers responsible when they sell a car that kills people due to its design.

967166473872527360 2018-02-23 22:37:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michellemalkin @JCoonen I think we should treat guns the same way we treat cars. Glad you agree.

It doesn't have an extended magazine. I'm fine with 6 shot revolvers. Never said I wasnt. Again, quit attacking straw men of your own creation.

Good at close range, shot spreads, stopping power without penetrating power, loud to help alert neighbors. Buy honestly, I don't depend on that. I depend on quality locks, an alarm system, and a loud dog. Ask any cop, those are way more effective.
967150294999199745 2018-02-23 21:32:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MarkRuffalo @DaRealNathaniel 1) Quit attacking a straw man argument I didn't make. Never said ban all guns. 2) You didn't answer the question.

967137153342984192 2018-02-23 20:40:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AltRabbi @trumpocrat Main Point: You just jumped the shark on how ignorant a person can be.
967135519577649153 2018-02-23 20:34:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> It's the all or nothing mentality. A weapons ban won't prevent every bad guy from trying to kill people...so unless we can save every single life, we shouldn't save any lives. Its mental.
967135517954408448 2018-02-23 20:34:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> This is one of those arguments that will always blow my mind with how ludicrous it is, yet how often the people will say it without irony. There are people who genuinely believe a knife attack is the same thing as an attack with an AR15.https://twitter.com/DaRealNathaniel/status/967125661159710720
967134213513326592 2018-02-23 20:28:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MarkRuffalo @DaRealNathaniel Finding an illegal gun is harder than you might think. Most crimes re committed by guns purchased legally. Also, most illegal guns were originally purchased legally. Oh, and what is the mortality rate of a knife attack? Do you believe a knife attack is just as dangerous?

967129549791289344 2018-02-23 20:10:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ChrisJZullo One of my favorite arguments from the #ProGun crowd is that "the AR15 is no more dangerous than any other gun," or "Any other gun could have done the same damage." But then they turn around and say "You can't ban the AR15 because we NEED it."

967128320511967233 2018-02-23 20:05:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @daveanthony Also, #2a was written, in part, to keep slaves in their place. In the south, the "militia" was called "slave patrols." Plus, the 2nd Amendment was written in the same meeting as the 3/5 compromise. So maybe revisiting it makes sense.

967126567582396417 2018-02-23 19:58:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JWGOP @RonaldKlain @source_near_WH So...it saved lives then? Right? I mean, maybe it was only 1 single life. But that life has worth. It has value. We should reenact the ban, broaden the ban to include other semi-auto weapons & accessories. Even if all of that only saves a single life every year we should do it
967125855242776576 2018-02-23 19:55:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RonaldKlain Call me crazy...but even if banning all semi-automatic weapons (and yes I mean handguns too) only saved 1 single life...wouldn't it be worth it?
967125450353979392 2018-02-23 19:54:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rebelutionary_Z Eventually the GOP will realize this is true. Which is when they will expect teachers to not only be armed, but also teach in full combat gear and body armor.
967123452460195845 2018-02-23 19:46:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @marcorubio Ok...ban all 2000 of them. #ThatWasEasy

967122912070299649 2018-02-23 19:44:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MarkRuffalo @DaRealNathaniel Guns are a major part of the problem. The way they are marketed. The culture surrounding them. The ease of obtaining them. The lack of registration, tracking, etc. The types of guns we allow in civilian society. And so on. I agree on your points. But we need to also look at guns.
967122185281265664 2018-02-23 19:41:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JesseBWatters @TVNewsHQ @pennysmagic1 Said the lady who believes conspiracy theories about school shooting victims. If YOU think its crazy...its probably pretty sane.

I'm not asking if you need one, you don't need any semi automatic rifle or handgun. It's about whether you think they should be allowed in civilian hands.

You seem to think we need to have armed guards at every street corner. Which wouldn't be as effective as common sense gun control.
966833740281532417 2018-02-22 00:35:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @PaulPageTV Probably because of all those kids killed by people with guns.
966833602808958977 2018-02-22 00:34:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @PaulPageTV No one is saying "ban all guns." It's a straw man you create so that you can argue the most tenable position.

966807560933298178 2018-02-22 22:50:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JoyAnnReid Exactly. If I'm a parent, my job is to keep my kids safe. If someone walks in with a gun, I should treat them as a threat. Always. No matter where I am. There is no way to tell good guys from bad guys in a room full of people with guns.

966784724860637186 2018-02-22 21:20:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack The problem we face is how people conflate manhood with machismo. Being a man is the pinnacle of being male. It's a title you earn, and you do it through actions. Putting yourself second, being humble, loyal, & honest are traits of men. Machismo is a trait of boys.
966784206494978049 2018-02-22 21:18:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Part of it is the misunderstanding of what it is to be a man. I've written about this several times myself. How being a man is, in its purest form, taking care of your responsibilities, putting yourself second, & being humble.

That's your soapbox, not mine. We can make schools safer by investing in programs to help kids. We make everyone safer by changing gun laws. We can do both.
966736425600372736 2018-02-22 18:08:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RicciGeri No it wont. Because  A) no one is saying get rid of 2A, so stop with the fallacy. B) most Americans agree some common sense gun control is needed C) a ban on specific types of guns/ammo is totally within 2A, as is regulating the sale/manufacture/use of them.

Just have armed soldiers watching over everything all the time? Instead, we could change gun laws, fund mental health research, fund bullying and social programs in schools, etc.

966715311633391618 2018-02-22 16:44:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> This argument never ceases to baffle me. "Sure guns are dangerous, but people can kill with a plastic bag." The people who say this are absolutely insane. https://twitter.com/RicciGeri/status/966686593238097920

Guns were designed to kill. That is their primary purpose, and they do it very, very effectively. Do you truly believe a tootsie roll stick is equivalent to a loaded AR15? That they're equally dangerous?
966714571170951169 2018-02-22 16:41:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TuckerCarlson @DD93778941 @RicciGeri We need to do all of those things, sure. But let's also address the problem of guns in this country. Quit making it an all-or-nothing scenario. Quit conflating ideas. Be intellectually honest about this.   BTW: Your home is safer with an alarm & hefty locks than with a gun.
966713437450571781 2018-02-22 16:36:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @marcorubio @1NadineSmith This is the point those who are advocating for #GunReformNow need to make. It isn't about stopping all murders forever, thats impossible. But we can make it harder for bad guys to kill people. We can lower the body count. We can save lives.pic.twitter.com/5x3jaABNTa

965392920361820161 2018-02-18 01:09:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The right to keep and bear arms doesn't mean you have the right to keep and bear ALL arms. Just because you can have a gun, doesn't mean you can have ANY gun. Let's revisit #2A. #GunReformNow #AR15 #gunsense
965379193927360512 2018-02-18 00:15:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @AbolitionistJay Wow...hope you didn't pull a muscle reaching so hard.

965366662294835201 2018-02-18 23:25:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> After hours of civil discourse, got blocked again by someone who couldn't handle the realization that guns are a problem.pic.twitter.com/ZJ8MnYwCaJ
965365816995794944 2018-02-18 23:22:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @deplorable_ben So...you blast snopes but post from bearing arms? Lol. OK kiddo. But hey, if you want to be like Israel, go for it. You do realize owning a gun there is a privilege, not a right? Right? Gun licenses are tightly controlled. Seriously...read more.
965363112886112256 2018-02-18 23:11:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike And how many are lost? How many are saved by an AR15? How many were saved from another gun? Again, never said take away everyone's guns. You seem to be stuck on a point I didn't make.
965362187182268424 2018-02-18 23:07:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike Extended mags. Silencers. Armor penetrating anmo. Other assault rifles. Bump stocks. Oh, and I'd like a national registry of guns, purchases, and sellers. Required background checks for any and all gun sales. Research into ways we can make guns safer. Some other things.
965361045496791040 2018-02-18 23:03:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike The question is, if you could have done something to make the Parkland shooting less deadly by a single life, would you have? Would it have been worth it?
965359183884357632 2018-02-18 22:55:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike Handgun reloads would be far more frequent, and accuracy is far worse unless used by someone with training/practice. Every reload gives victims more time to get away. More tI'm to increase distance. More recoil means lower firing rate, less accuracy. Let's be honest Mike.
965357820492345344 2018-02-18 22:50:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike But to ignore firearms and the role they play is equally evil. I'm not disagreeing that societal changes are a big part of the problem, but guns are the other part of the equation. No thinking person says "ban all guns." But some guns are not necessary.
965357132509048833 2018-02-18 22:47:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @deplorable_ben Reading. Do more of it. http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/23572/Default.aspx
965356535089172486 2018-02-18 22:45:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike It's an honest question. Are all guns equally dangerous? Are all guns equally deadly? Would a ban on certain types of guns mean less loss of life? These arent hard questions, but you get mad because the answer doesn't line up with your narrative.
965356092443316224 2018-02-18 22:43:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @deplorable_ben You're not much of a reader are you?
965355933923725313 2018-02-18 22:42:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike Both a pistol and a shotgun would mean far less carnage. Reload time, accuracy, penetration of ammo, etc. At a distance, if I had to choose between someone with a 9mm or a shotgun and someone with an AR15, I know which door I'd choose. You?
965355266802900992 2018-02-18 22:40:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @hmuhl1 @Sig45Mike This country has changed. The culture around guns has changed. The media has changed. How we view guns has changed.

No way that psycho does as much damage with a muzzleloader as he does with an AR15. No way the carnage is the same if he had a revolver instead of an AR15. Don't be a fool.

965287830124625920 2018-02-18 18:12:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CNN @Bucky_Breeder Also, if there were an age limit on buying semi auto rifles. If semi auto rifles were banned. If we had more thorough background checks. If this kid didn't have a gun.

964738671697113088 2018-02-16 05:49:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SenFeinstein @GrayLudo No. I honestly can't take someone who doesn't understand the causes of the Civil War, or the constitution, seriously.

If I'm in a public place with my family and I see some dude with a gun, they are a threat. They should be treated as a threat. Because you never know. Which is why, if I'm in a gun-free zone, I know how to react to a person with a gun. It's called logic.

But, not to belabor the point, I asked you an A/B question. You chose C because being honest doesn't fit your narrative. Is your official position that both a hammer and an AR15 are equally dangerous?

It is magazine fed, and can be fired rapidly. It was designed to kill the most people in the shortest amount of time. It's a weapon designed for urban warfare. It's an assault rifle. By definition.

You know nothing about rate of fire, magazine capacity, recoil effects, cavitation, or simple logic. Yes, the VT murderer used a handgun, can you imagine how much worse an AR15 would have made it?

Turning our schools into prisons with every teacher an armed guard on high alert isn't conducive to a proper education. Let's instead change the way this country treats guns. Let's stop idolizing them. Let's revisit what should, & shouldn't be legal.

As would more extensive background checks. He may also have been deterred by required gun registration and passing a safety skills test for a license. Gun control saves lives.

Also, most weapons used in mass shootings are bought legally. A national gun registry (similar to auto registry), mandatory gun licenses with safety and skills tests, & a ban on semi-auto rifles & extended mags would save lives.

964593971950510080 2018-02-16 20:14:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TheBoxThatRoxx Or, just enact common sense gun laws like requiring Gun Registrations with annual renewal (which would also help to solve crimes). Require background checks for all sales. Requiring safety classes and tests for licenses. Banning Semi-Auto rifles and extended mags.
964593366901186560 2018-02-16 20:12:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jamesirving2 You seriously believe that if the US government, with the entire might of the US Armed Forces, came knocking on your door, you could defend yourself? That you could fight them off with your AR-15? They have drones James. And tanks. And missiles. And full body armor.
964592885248217088 2018-02-16 20:10:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Doodisgirl See how well your lack of gun control laws worked? See how well easy access to AR-15 style rifles worked? Seriously, your way of thinking is severely unstable.
964592482976698368 2018-02-16 20:09:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @holly_thor_gaz So, your excuse for not wanting Gun Reform is that...a lot of people are shot? It's a weird stance to take.

You think your gun is going to protect you in case the US Army comes knocking at your door? They have drones. And tanks. Your need for a wubby is costing children's lives.
964588184322666497 2018-02-16 19:51:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JuicyJackson_JJ If you want to end abortions, and we all do, tell the GOP to stop blocking comprehensive sex education. Tell the GOP to make access to birth control easier, cheaper, and more available. Tell the GOP to do things that could actually help.
964587808009617408 2018-02-16 19:50:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JuicyJackson_JJ Abortion rates have been declining every year since 1990. Most abortions happen due to teen pregnancy. 22% of the abortions you cited were due to medical reasons. 66% are performed at or below the 8th week.
964587285835583488 2018-02-16 19:48:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JuicyJackson_JJ No, they don't. A typical Republican might be against abortion, but they are ok with taking food, healthcare, and education away from children. And they are totally ok with children being murdered by guns. Also, your stats are misleading bordering on outright lies.

A shotgun holds like 7 shells max, kick like hell, & takes a while to reload. They also aren't great at penetrating. Most of these shooters aren't trained pros.

It's not confusing, you're trolling.

964572753989980160 2018-02-16 18:50:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rheymiigration So, if given the choice, you think all options are equal? An AR-15 is comparable to a baseball bat?

964563331720908806 2018-02-16 18:13:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DougDeMuro @edciting Yeah, I saw that...But a brat is not a baja.
964524088638230529 2018-02-16 15:37:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @IngrahamAngle @SteveScalise @FoxNews Registering guns, requiring skills and safety training/tests for licenses, reinstating the assault weapons ban, limiting magazine capacity, closing loopholes, holding manufacturers responsible, and allowing research in gun deaths does not infringe on anyone rights you putz.
964523051688824833 2018-02-16 15:33:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SenToddYoung @KYComer @RepLarryBucshon They already are connected...am I missing something here?
964521896137121799 2018-02-16 15:28:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DrDarrinPorcher @loupalumboelite @drsportelli @trumps_feed @foxandfriends No, but a series of common sense reforms will reduce them. Conservatives need to get over the "all or nothing" thinking. #GunReformNow won't stop all shootings, but it will reduce them, and minimize body count. Even if they saved 1 life, it would be worth it.
964480731358613504 2018-02-16 12:45:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Because the fact that the GOP makes it easy to kill children is a political issue you putz.https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/964327398312464384
964480310233714688 2018-02-16 12:43:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MattOverton_LS When it does nothing to save the lives of children, prayer is bullshit.
964479805705072640 2018-02-16 12:41:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> He literally cut funding to mental health care, and signed a bill making it easier for the mentally ill to get guns....so maybe, just maybe, trump is full of shit. #GunReformNowhttps://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/964323718674644993
964475779630469120 2018-02-16 12:25:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @trumps_feed @TuckerCarlson Except it does. The ease of obtaining guns. The culture surrounding guns. The efficiency in killing that makes guns attractive to murderers. The access to military style rifles for civilians. Guns are a huge part of the problem. Don't be a schmuck Tuck.
964315974601203712 2018-02-15 01:50:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DougDeMuro @ZamoraO Huh. Wonder why? I have never seen one on the road, always just in parking lots. Always wanted to own one though.

964310763971194881 2018-02-15 01:29:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RedTRaccoon Add a gun registration which needs annual renewal, and licenses that expire and I completely agree.
964309935558463489 2018-02-15 01:26:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Alright @DougDeMuro...VehiCROSS or Subaru Baja? Which would you rather own? #TeamBaja
964213511017680897 2018-02-15 19:03:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> When 27 first graders can be murdered in cold blood, with no action to keep it from happening again by our government, we have a problem. Since then mass shopting have been on the rise, and still no action. It emboldens the killers. The blood is on GOP hands.https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/963921055206297600
964212298893217795 2018-02-15 18:58:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The party that is pro child murder is not the party that believes in women's rights. It's the one that refuses to do anything to keep your children safe. The party that thinks child massacre is a small price to pay. Think about that. #GunReformNow #FlipItBlue
964211211096162304 2018-02-15 18:54:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RyanAFournier Yeah...I do. Guns, the culture surrounding them, the way they're marketed, and the ease with which they can be acquired. We need to do something, as humans. Because God obviously wont/doesn't care.

964209443062808577 2018-02-15 18:47:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Trump is literally blaming the victims of the #Parkland school shooting. Anything to defend the policies of the GOP which have allowed these shootings to continue, if not accelerate. We need #GunReformNow. No more dead children.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964110212885106689
964163669495091200 2018-02-15 15:45:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I find it hard to be shocked so many people are Pro child murder after finding out so many are also Pro pedohpile. To no ones surprise, it's the same group of people.
964162932794851329 2018-02-15 15:42:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If a maniac were on their way to your child's school with the intent on killing as many people as possible, would you want them armed with a Semi-auto Rifle, or a baseball bat? Evil people will always want to kill, why make it easier for them? #GunReformNow #ThursdayThoughts
964158233089839105 2018-02-15 15:23:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Can we talk about Sandy Hook Tomi? Can we talk about Vegas? When is it time to talk about #GunControlNow?https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/963978544295505922
964157634743078912 2018-02-15 15:21:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If common sense #GunControl laws will save even a single life, it would be worth it. Every life of every victim in every school shooting this year is blood on the hands of the GOP. Make no mistake, they have chosen greed over innocent life. https://twitter.com/chaddiedabaddie/status/963906423880118273
964157058663829505 2018-02-15 15:18:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Every school shooting leaves me more certain of two things.   1) God is not real. 2) The GOP must be stopped.  Every time I put myself in the shoes of those kids, and their families...and it's too much. My heart goes out to all of them. #Parkland #GunReformNow

963961046892498944 2018-02-14 02:19:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SenToddYoung Do something about it then. This blood is on GOP hands. Own it. I'm tired of the BS. Do aomething, or admit you don't care.
963960428387799040 2018-02-14 02:17:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @marcorubio Which is why he used a semi auto rifle and not a baseball bat or a pocket knife. To maximize death. You could have helped. You could have potentially made this not happen. This blood is on your hands, and the entire GOP. You own it.

963436131701395456 2018-02-13 15:34:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hemantmehta Also important to note though, if you think prayer works you can't also say you have free will. Free will can not exist in a world with intercessory prayer...or an all powerful god.
963435783138021377 2018-02-13 15:32:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hemantmehta As an atheist, I don't care if students want to pray, they're free to do so. As long as the school doesn't spend any money/resources on it, doesn't mandate it, and doesn't force it on students.

959668536384851970 2018-02-02 06:03:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @piersmorgan I believe I can speak for @Ofcom when I say "this is hilarious and fully supported by everyone. It fully encapsulates the essence of your trump interview."

959629998377218049 2018-02-02 03:29:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Apparently my 1st grade daughter surveyed her class today on who would win in a fight between The Hulk & Luke Skywalker.

959573856011857920 2018-02-02 23:46:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @trumps_feed @KimStrassel I don't think you read it...or you only read that fit your narrative. Either way, the things a joke. An already discredited opinion article with no association to any investigation or evidence being used as a tool of distraction by trump co.
959571823838064641 2018-02-02 23:38:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RepJimBanks A "memo" is not an official document or any sort of research paper associated with an actual investigation. It's an opinion article with unfounded claims. Plus, it has already been discredited as containing false information with the intent of creating a false narrative. Grow up.

959406288135507968 2018-02-02 12:40:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Am I missing something on this #NunesMemo? It's not an official report from an investigation conducted by law enforcement. It's a MEMO...written by a known liar/partisan hack. Some people might agree with his thoughts, but it isn't necessarily factual. It's propaganda. #Memogate
959403513339088896 2018-02-02 12:29:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @trumps_feed @PressSec Like..maybe 30% of Americans....so I guess as long as more than one American lover it you're technically correct.   The more accurate thing to say would be "Few Americans loved..."
959401045461028864 2018-02-02 12:20:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul I would add this...if you are unable to run for office, think about who is currently in charge, and vote for the opposite. The majority of Indiana is under the control of a single party. If you aren't happy, vote them out.

958560407962177536 2018-01-30 04:39:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Depends on where the money comes from. Will the burden fall, as it almost always does, on the middle class and working families? What programs that benefit the middle class/poverty/seniors/children are we cutting to pay for it?

Basically, it's now the party of cognitive dissonance, gaslighting, & lies. You cant even claim moral authority anymore.
958555713445523457 2018-01-30 04:21:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @CantankerousCMF And how much they want to help the rich vs the middle class.

Warren repeated the stories of her heritage she heard from her family. Like we all do. I was always told I was part Native American also, no reason to doubt it.

Making this claim does nothing but display your ignorance on how DNA tests work. It isn't that simple, and proving Native American Heritage is incredibly difficult. She didn't lie, she repeated family stories she had no reason to doubt. Like we all do.

953631806535979008 2018-01-17 14:15:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @MovieCorn @CJTUCKERTRUPAT He wasn't berating a the lady about dinner being cold, nor was he threatening her in any way. He was addressing her as an equal, and as a person who is enabling racist rhetoric. Trump has displayed racist behavior countless times. Let's call a spade a spade.
953630883948482561 2018-01-17 14:11:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @Cinnamon305 You're gonna give me news from 1,000 years ago and act like it matters? It's like you aren't even trying to make a cogent point.

953460812466851842 2018-01-16 02:55:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @MovieCorn @CJTUCKERTRUPAT "Full on mental"? Tell me, when did he seem like he wasn't in control? When did he froth at the mouth? Hurl insults? Stand up and start shouting? He didnt. He spoke with the feeling most Americans have. A feeling of frustrstion. Of being tired of being lied to.
953459890802102272 2018-01-16 02:52:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @Cinnamon305 Hmmm...I tried and all it said was "a way to pivot. A red herring that has nothing to do with the topic at hand." Yup. That checks out.
953458698114031616 2018-01-16 02:47:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @MovieCorn I don't think Cory Booker was shocked at what Trump said. I think we're all beyond shock at what he says and how he acts. I think he was outraged by the faked amnesia of those who defend him. Seemingly rational people who will excuse his behavior on party loyalty. That's shocking
953454251665252357 2018-01-16 02:29:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> This is just fucking unacceptable. You disgust me @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP.https://twitter.com/nwarikoo/status/952878794007875584

953384215738974209 2018-01-16 21:51:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @MovieCorn Right...I don't think anyone is waiting for him to change. That isn't the point. Trumps parents failed him by not teaching him how to be a man. But ignoring his behavior won't make it go away, and people need to know what the President says, and he needs to be held accountable.
953383443211214852 2018-01-16 21:48:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @Cinnamon305 From what I can tell, after searching online, about $140K less than the ones paid to not share their accounts.
953365466168332288 2018-01-16 20:36:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I posted a list of cars I wanted @DougDeMuro to review in 2018. 2 weeks in and he's already delivering. https://youtu.be/QfJjH4oZDTA (Yes I know Doug recorded this months ago and my list had nothing to do with it)
953354876423229441 2018-01-16 19:54:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @moonpieluva @Cinnamon305 I Googled "times Cory Booker has been accused of abusing women." Weirdly, no results. Just a bunch of stuff about Trump and Roy Moore abuse. Starting to think you don't know what you're talking about.
953354143246225408 2018-01-16 19:51:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @Cinnamon305 Well, if you have any trouble imagining your fake world, use this old writing trick and take some inspiration from the real world. For example, there are several public acounts for how Trump treats women. Use that as a starting off point. #HopeThatHelps
953352960381276160 2018-01-16 19:47:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JordanRieser @AppsTrever @toombstone The fuck is this? Are you using a twitter following program to ask people to follow you? That's pretty sad.
953350017456197632 2018-01-16 19:35:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @MovieCorn Because how our president acts, and the words he uses, is important. I refuse to expect less of my president than I do from my toddler. No lying. No insults. Take responsibility. Be humble. Be kind. Be smart. Treat other people with respect.
953349139177377793 2018-01-16 19:32:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @Cinnamon305 ...about holding people accountable for their racist rhetoric.
953348818640228353 2018-01-16 19:30:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MyDaughtersArmy @angel2c123 Calling out racism and holding people accountable for racist rhetoric and protecting racists, isn't "race baiting." It's honesty. It's truth. And Americans who think, Americans who actually understand logic and are capable of rational thought, we appreciate it.

953346262585298945 2018-01-16 19:20:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @AttyAbdul I think his narcissism makes him believe he is better than other people. I think this displays itself most when he is referring to other people who don't look like him. Or come from the same privileged background. Couple that with all of the obvious racist actions &....racist.

It'll be a bunch of insults, repeated lies, attacks on the press, delusions of grandeur, and exaggerations of "accomplishments" on top of asserting he is the best there ever was or will be.

952654265465614336 2018-01-14 21:30:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @nypost Lot of you confusing Machismo with Manhood. Don't. Being a Man isn't about how you walk, talk, or dress. Being macho is a tool used by boys. Being a Man is about responsibility. Putting yourself second. Being loyal, humble, honorable, & honest. Real men know the difference.
952653156109967360 2018-01-14 21:26:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @nypost @toombstone The sooner machismo becomes an unnaccepted substitute for manhood the better off we'll be as a country.

952648713436098561 2018-01-14 21:08:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Evan_McMullin @trumps_feed @JesseKellyDC Ya'll confuse being macho with being a man. Don't. Machismo is used by little boys to feel tough. Men don't need that. Being a man isnt about how you dress, walk, sit, or talk. It's about responsibility, putting yourself second. Being humble, honest, & loyal. Real men know this.

Straight up dead. Not injured. Not hurt. Fucking turned to dust. Gone forever. I cried. In the theater. That scene fucked me up for years.

951342474819264512 2018-01-10 06:38:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PFTompkins @YohanMusik Personally, it just pisses me off to see him cast in major motion pictures still. For the same reason I get angry when R Kelly sells out a huge arena. They're huge pieces of shit, & they should be lying in a gutter somewhere.
950580931601010688 2018-01-08 04:12:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SierraNevada @hosch_greg @RodJBeerVenture Me and you both.
950580831071940608 2018-01-08 04:11:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BRIANMBENDIS Cool art, but in what world does an all powerful, near indestructible, near omnipresent, faster than light being need to team up with a gymnast with a baton? I love me some Nightwing, but Superman team ups have always been ridiculous to me.
950579839223894016 2018-01-08 04:07:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SPONTANEANATION Airport is second place to "Under the Eiffel Tower."

950579192726466561 2018-01-08 04:05:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PFTompkins @SPONTANEANATION @mtndwelling Listen to the live ep. "Under the Eiffel Tower" with @ScottAukerman. My favorite episode by far.
950578889914535936 2018-01-08 04:04:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SPONTANEANATION Personally, I miss him not telling who the previous episodes guest was. Don't know why, but that shit always made my day.

And while I would grant you a charismatic Rabbi named Joseph may have existed at the time, you have a loooooooong way to go to prove he was the son of god, that he was born a virgin, or that he performed miracles.

943523255985504256 2017-12-20 16:47:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls Literally no reason why I shouldn't be able to return a broken item ordered online to the store & get full store credit for the amount my mom spent on it so I can purchase a replacement instead of burdening her.
943522754954973185 2017-12-20 16:45:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls The best thing is, I am doing all of my christmas shopping today and tomorrow. I usually do a lot of it at Kohls. Not this year. This year I'll go elsewhere. Because while customer service may be dead at Kohls, it is alive and well at tons of other places.
943522365371187200 2017-12-20 16:43:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls Talked to in store manager, had to get connected to kohls online team, talked to a supervisor there, and spent over 90 minutes talking to people. They were able to look it up. They verified it was a kohls product. It is broken. They refuse to give store credit for it.
943521896062169088 2017-12-20 16:42:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls Real easy. Received a xmas gift from family member. Gift was broken. Took it back to kohls. Item no longer available. Was told they couldn't give me a store credit for it, they would have to refund my family member who could then repurchase a different gift for me.

But it is going to take some time. It took decades to get here, won't change overnight

940665896682622978 2017-12-12 19:33:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 These majority black areas tend to have less resources, worse schools, etc, because the elected officials (mainly white people) allocate the resources elsewhere. This is all data you can look up. Several studies have been done on it. 5/
940665232183250944 2017-12-12 19:30:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Again, these are all facts. Researchable, honest facts. Now, the more people in you in a small space, the higher amount of interactions people have with one another.

And a lot of those prejudiced viewpoints remain today. In businesses, stereotypes, & law enforcement. Not to mention how those roadblocks helped to set the direction of the black community. 3/
940664042615656448 2017-12-12 19:25:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 After keeping black people from quality educations, mortgages, job opportunities, and so on for decades after slavery ended, we finally had to pass constitutional amendments to grant blacks the ability to vote & be recognized as equal citizens. 2/

940662489704026113 2017-12-12 19:19:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Maybe it's just the car guy in me, but the word "restoring" means taking something back to it's authentic, original condition. So, to me, this reads that Pence wants to disband the military in favor of state militias and muskets.https://twitter.com/VP/status/940658787551236096

940276851058069504 2017-12-11 17:47:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> True, voting for #Trump doesn't mean you are not a decent person. However, every person who did vote for trump knowingly voted for an indecent person to represent them, their values, & their ideals.https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/940257176534339585
940275754545315841 2017-12-11 17:43:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @ItalianoJuno Nah, pretty sure it was latent racism, gaslighting, willfull ignorance, & better use of data that got trump elected along with Russian help, gerrymandering, voter suppression, & general malaise caused by a long, divisive campaign.
940275006751297537 2017-12-11 17:40:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @piersmorgan No, not all of Trumps voters are indecent human beings. However, every Trump voter knowingly voted for an indecent human being to represent them, their country, & their values.

940271529023111170 2017-12-11 17:26:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DineshDSouza Not surprisingly paid political shill & willfully ignorant mouthpiece for conservative issues Dinesh D'Souza supports a candidate who wants to remove all amendment to the Constitution after #10. What a putz.

939915074709286912 2017-12-10 17:49:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Except, again, it isn't real evidence. It is intellectually dishonest.

Though it doesn't surprise me, since you seem incapable of grasping simple concepts while making unsupported claims in your quest for anarchism. If taxes are necessary, they need collected. The burden should not be on the working class.
939198739390128129 2017-12-08 18:23:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I The people EARNING the wealth are not the people RECEIVING the wealth. As profits have continued to rise in this country middle class salaries have been stagnant. Look it up. K?

939195964857909248 2017-12-08 18:12:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I To repeat, "Show me some data that says tax cuts fro the wealthy creates jobs. It doesn't. Because that's not how jobs work. To create jobs you need to create a demand for goods & services. Which you do by ensuring the Middle Class is vibrant, strong, & has expendable income."
939195660787703809 2017-12-08 18:11:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Taxes. Are. A. Necessity. For. A. Working. Government. We need ro stop putting the burden for that working government on the backs of hard working Americans, & instead place it on the rich. Not sure how much clearer I can make it you little anarchist.
939194594230767617 2017-12-08 18:06:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Not the same thing at all. Either you know that and don't care, or you don't know.

939193745412681728 2017-12-08 18:03:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I You and I have a different definition of "earn." Also, the fuck you say? Eventually larger sum? Based on what?
939193103898030086 2017-12-08 18:00:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I The distribution of wealth in the country is unequal. Yeah. We should stop rewarding corporate greed. Not sure why you would disagree with that kiddo.

939183169932353536 2017-12-08 17:21:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TheSmokingTire @theRealTavarish The reason reciprocity did not exist before is because the vetting and requirements for a CCW are not consistent between the states. So some states don't want people with CCWs when they don't meet state requirements. It's a state issue, not a federal one, & this is bad policy.

938997718545973249 2017-12-07 05:04:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Remember people of #Alabama, if you vote for #RoyMoore THESE are the values he is taking to Washington. And everyone will assume that the values of Roy Moore are #AlabamaValues you all share. #ALsen

Roy Moore, GOP endorsed, Trump endorsed candidate for the US Senate in 2017 said this...that America was "Great" during slavery. #ALSen #MAGApic.twitter.com/OLFLJztZMO
938993948135059456 2017-12-07 04:49:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SusanWBrooks Does it address the main reasons why many states did not have reciprocity? Mainly differences in requirements needed to obtain the permit? Shouldn't every state have an agreed upon process of evaluation?
938991788508946432 2017-12-07 04:41:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> One thing is for sure, if the people of Alabama elect Roy Moore to be their voice, to represent them, then we have to assume they do share his values. That they think he is the best of what Alabama has to offer. Is that true, Al? Is Roy Moore who you want to be known by? #ALSEN

I also like weird, quirky vehicles or ones that didn't get the respect they deserved. Like the Ford Maverick or the Mercury Cougar.
938906345964699650 2017-12-07 23:01:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Pretty sure at this point you're being willfully ignorant.
938905284499689473 2017-12-07 22:57:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Basic economics here. If person A is paid X by a company, the person is expected to provide >X in added value to the company. If, at any time, because of demand being low, poor performance, etc., Person A is deemed to provide <X in value they will be let go/replaced.
938904428966539264 2017-12-07 22:53:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Ted Pike, the narrator/creator, is a known Anti-Semite. Did you not know that? It'd be like you sharing a documentary made by David Duke. Not interested.
938904133578510336 2017-12-07 22:52:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @jdnagle No prob bob.
938904066842865667 2017-12-07 22:52:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Show me some data that says tax cuts fro the wealthy creates jobs. It doesn't. Because that's not how jobs work. To create jobs you need to create a demand for goods & services. Which you do by ensuring the Middle Class is vibrant, strong, & has expendable income.
938903298366693377 2017-12-07 22:49:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Really not sure how you guys either don't understand this concept, or disagree with the logic. You need to be willfully intellectually honest to do so.
938902707972333570 2017-12-07 22:47:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Again, we have a greater amount of benefit received by the wealthy than is received by the average worker. A flat tax says the BENEFIT of these services is equal. Which is false. The benefit is weighted heavily towards the wealthy. So too, should the burden.
938902121755312128 2017-12-07 22:44:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Want another example? Ok, well our $50K a year guy might have a house, maybe a car that he pays taxes to protect with fire, military, police, etc. However, a wealthy person has several cars, homes, businesses, plus they need their workforce to be safe as well so they can work.
938901768884408321 2017-12-07 22:43:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan So the BENEFIT the company gets from an educated workforce is GREATER than the benefit received by the workforce. My argument is the larger BURDEN should be placed on the people who GAIN the most.
938900666885591041 2017-12-07 22:38:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Lets say guy is educated by public education. He benefits when a company pays him $50K for a job. But the value of the work that guy does for the company vastly exceeds what they pay him, otherwise they wouldn't pay him to do it.
938900160146493440 2017-12-07 22:36:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Roads, the military, police, fire, healthcare, education, any "service" paid for by taxes is much more beneficial to the rich because they have more assets, more wealth, have a need for a healthy, educated workforce, etc.
938899255892332550 2017-12-07 22:33:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Your example is silly. It betrays the childish nature of your entire argument. Because this isn't about the price of consumer goods in an open market. It's about taxes. Which pay for services. Which the rich & poor benefit from disproportionately.
938896739720888320 2017-12-07 22:23:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Yeah...not gonna do that. I can think of at least 42 better ways I could spend an hour of my life than to watch a 1980's documentary created & narrated by a known crackpot & anti-Semite.
938894130222190595 2017-12-07 22:12:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 So........you have no data then? Again, you claimed to have data which PROVES institutionalized racism is a nonexistent conspiracy. Yet.....you don't seem to be able to provide it, & you continuously pivot. Provide your data, or admit you lied.
938893535012708353 2017-12-07 22:10:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @jdnagle My. Point. Is. That. Deciding. Between. Doug. Jones. And. Roy. Moore. Is. Not. Hard. I don't know how I can be more clear about this. When you say "it's a tough choice" you imply the two options are equal. They aren't. & even the implication they are is obscene, & needs examined.
938892272858484736 2017-12-07 22:05:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan I swear, the conservative mantra is "The rich need more to do more. The poor need to learn to do more with less."
938892147947966464 2017-12-07 22:05:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Simply giving more money to the ultra rich and corporations doesn't create jobs or raise up the middle class because they aren't under any obligation to share the profits with their employees. Let's fix that.
938891889868181506 2017-12-07 22:04:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Did I say "wealth redistribution?" I'm talking taxes. Let the middle class & poor keep more $ by placing the burden back onto corporations & the wealthy. End loopholes the rich exploit. Penalize shipping jobs overseas. Incentive inner city job creation. Encourage entrepreneurship
938890394569465856 2017-12-07 21:58:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Piss off. Income inequality is the direct result of corporate profits growing increasingly larger and instead of sharing the wealth (like trickle down claims to do) they kept it for themselves. It exploded under Reagan/Bush & has been increasing exponentially since.
938889678316589057 2017-12-07 21:55:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I And if you really look at the data you see that for the past few decades profits have been increasing while middle class wealth has been stagnant & the divide between the wealthy and middle class has expanded. That's unequal moron.
938593136812724224 2017-12-06 02:16:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> As always, I'm guessing Surf Ninjas...even though it was released in 1993.https://twitter.com/cinemasins/status/938561370022391808

938591276198440960 2017-12-06 02:09:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins I mean, seriously. If this isn't Surf Ninjas I'm going to demand a refund.

938529099974369280 2017-12-06 22:02:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Oh my god...so dramatic. I swear bringing up Bolshevik's is the new Godwin's Law. Moore will never see a courtroom because of Alabama's convoluted Statute of Limitations on Sexual Abuse during the time. Does this loophole make him innocent in your eyes?
938525759643234305 2017-12-06 21:49:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Except it is up for debate. Because that's a wild ass accusation with no evidence to support it. Also, are you saying Fox isn't biased, or it isn't liberally biased?
938520072171245570 2017-12-06 21:26:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Right, then you made conspiratorial claims about the media & the Democratic party which implied your disbelief of the evidence & support for Roy Moore.   BTW you're question is misleading. It assumes every accusation has equal evidence, weight, & testimony.
938517901484740609 2017-12-06 21:17:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I know a lot of poor Republicans who this will affect in very negative ways.

938513747534073856 2017-12-06 21:01:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 It's not about suspicion or innuendo. Again, you're trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation. Its about credible accounts of abuse, character testimony, a history of predatory behavior, & so on.
938507259809845248 2017-12-06 20:35:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan It increases the deficit, increases the burden on the poor and middle class, and would create even more wealth inequality than we have today. It would effectively prevent anyone in a lower economic class from moving out of it. The idea of a flat tax is absurd.
938506155382509568 2017-12-06 20:31:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @jdnagle No. If Moore wins it sends a clear message to both abusers and victims of abuse. To the former, you're accepted and it's ok. To the latter...no one cares. If you want a pedophile in office just to carry out GOP policy with zero opposition you need to reevaluate your life.
938503676175544320 2017-12-06 20:21:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Don't pivot. You claimed to have data. So, share it.

938499841587638273 2017-12-06 20:06:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 So when, after you repressed your memories and tried to cope with your abuse for 40 years, your abuser is on television running for United States Senate it's more than you can bear. You have to speak out. And once you do, others feel empowered to as well.
938499390808915968 2017-12-06 20:04:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Its why I am not opposed to the death penalty for child rapists. Because when someone sexually abuses a child they are destroying them as a person. Stealing their innocence, affecting their interactions, and causing them pain for the rest of their lives.
938498874657988616 2017-12-06 20:02:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 No. I don't think its fishy. I think its common. If you spend any time around people who have been abused or suffered trauma you'll see it. Self blame, fear, repression, anger, pulling inward, shame. In many cases this abuse has lasting effects on the victims.
938445373651202048 2017-12-06 16:29:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MIKEFINNEGAN999 @RoadkillShow @HooviesGarage @bisforbuild @theRealTavarish Oh, it's dumb as hell Tavarish. Basically a Pinto wagon.  And believe me, if I had the means I would have kept it to myself. Since I dont, I thought I could at least pass it along to some guys who I think could appreciate it, & maybe rescue it like a mutt at the pound.
938443286032912386 2017-12-06 16:21:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Imagine you're a life long Pats fan, & then the cheating tapes happen, then deflategate happens. Could you really start rooting for your rival team? Could you throw out the Brady jerseys and buy a manning one? That's what we're facing today in politics. Team loyalty.
938442367669022723 2017-12-06 16:17:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Remember when the Patriots were caught cheating against the Colts? Pats fans didn't care. They supported the team even harder, made excuses, & refused to believe the evidence. Politics has become a spectator sport, & Republicans are Pats fans. They just want their team to win.

938440995766751232 2017-12-06 16:12:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul @JournalofTruth7 Don't act like it is just a single off the cuff accusation with no support. Roy Moore has several accusers, all of them credible. This evidence is corroborated by outside impartial accounts of Moores behavior, & a history of admitted creepy behavior. Don't downplay it.

A bill with handwritten notes, no time for reading it, or any real debate. I'm concerned about corruption & lobbyist influence. Wake up

937770247687372802 2017-12-04 19:47:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Not taxing jets is a handout. Expanding chip is a hand up. That's the difference.
937768970664497152 2017-12-04 19:42:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I If you pay me for a service, and then I say "oh, I'll actually give you a discount" what is that? We agreed taxes areally necessary for a government to operate, and the governments job is to provide services. Why should the rich get a steeper discount in relation to their wealth?
937767498669322240 2017-12-04 19:36:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PalomaStovall @Freedomrings22 Innocent until proven guilty, right? BTW, what did you think of the #KateSteinle verdict? Looks like he was innocent after all. I'm glad you agree he is an innocent man. Since you aren't a judge and jury, but a judge and jury did find him not guilty. Anywho......bye.

937764966299553792 2017-12-04 19:26:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @DelaneMcK @lemonleopard3n1 Don't confuse people with land. People vote, land doesnt. This map ignores population density & the fact that 65% of people live on only 3% of the available land. People matter.

937761725771894791 2017-12-04 19:13:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MarkRuffalo @ShaunKing The election solidified in my mind the idea that evangelical Christians don't really believe in the bible or the teachings of Christ. The support thry have given Trump and people like Roy Moore since the election only supports my theory.
937761160245448705 2017-12-04 19:10:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Franklin_Graham I'll go ahead and file this as more evidence to support my ongoing theory that Christians don't really believe in the bible or the teachings of Christ.

937715096519921666 2017-12-04 16:07:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan What is? If a person making $200 a week has to pay $20 in taxes, that is a huge deal. It's a major expense. If a person making $10,000 a week has to pay $3500, it's not as big of a burden.
937714046383656960 2017-12-04 16:03:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Of course I set my spending on my income, most all people do. How do you do it? You just decide what you want your income to be based on how much you want to spend?  Reagan fucked the country up. Trickle down is bullshit.

937709099948691456 2017-12-04 15:44:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan And they are growing that debt enormously right now. They are picking winners, the rich, and losers, the poor. Trump disrupts and distorts markets all the time. Be consistent. You can't be pro #GOPTaxScam, pro Trump, & also believe the things you say.

937708237926871042 2017-12-04 15:40:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan First, prove to me that giving the wealthy more money will create jobs. Literally no evidence of that. That's not how things work. It isn't about confiscating pie, it's about making sure the burden of taxation is fair and just.
937706774576148483 2017-12-04 15:34:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound I think Jesus cares about character. About the person, their intentions, and their heart. Don't you? I doubt Jesus would approve of an adulterous serial liar. But maybe we have different versions of who Jesus was supposed to be.

937127096626884608 2017-12-02 01:11:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Sure...but does he APPROVE? I love my kids unconditionally. Doesn't mean I approve of every action. Youre conflating the two.
937125857558192129 2017-12-02 01:06:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan And to do those things, it takes money. Right?
937125697402916864 2017-12-02 01:05:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound So, anything they do is excusable and justified. Right?
937125559208960000 2017-12-02 01:05:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound I think you summed it up nicely. That all authority figures are to be obeyed because they were put there by God.

937121822583197696 2017-12-02 00:50:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound I don't know which tweet this is a response to.
937121664059535360 2017-12-02 00:49:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Still, divine authority. Right?
937121505573527552 2017-12-02 00:49:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Indeed I have. Own them. Have you?
937121389609447424 2017-12-02 00:48:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound But until then, let's all hurt each other and not live a life like Jesus prescribed? Seems like you don't really think you'll have to answer. Or maybe you think your faith is a free pass to act however you like in this life?
937119111557140480 2017-12-02 00:39:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound But I also know a group of people pretending they live their lives based on his teachings, should at least have to answer for them. Otherwise, you aren't really serious about your religion, are you?
937118704667693056 2017-12-02 00:38:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound No, I get that too. The country was set up to out the power in the hands of the people. Not a divine authority. Otherwise we'd have a king. Do we have a king?
937118412995747840 2017-12-02 00:36:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound I have a pretty good idea. Read it a few times. Studied it quite a bit. Practiced it for a while. I get it. I just don't think most Christians do.
937118126038274049 2017-12-02 00:35:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound How? What about Trumps behavior aligns with the teachings of Jesus? Any example would be helpful.
937117953312555008 2017-12-02 00:35:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ScienceHoffman So help me son. How does my original question, asking you to explain  how handwritten notes on a tax reform bill are acceptable, display a lack of English education?
937117305846235136 2017-12-02 00:32:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Reason 19765689 why I can't be a christian, you believe in divine authority of kings. Basically the exact opposite of what this country was founded on.
937116970729828352 2017-12-02 00:31:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> And here we have an evangelical Conservative claiming Trump has divine authority over us. Our founding fathers are rolling over in their graves.https://twitter.com/bimmerbound/status/937116475172802560
937116557670518784 2017-12-02 00:29:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound So, you think he approved of Caesar? Plus, he did criticize a lot of other people though, right? Don't dodge the question. Based on your interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, do you think he would approve of Donald Trump, as a leader, or as a man? It's a simple yes/no.
937115960921788416 2017-12-02 00:27:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Govt will always have to pay for things. And rich people will always find ways to keep more and share less. Gov should help make it possible for those less fortunate to have the opportunity to get rich. That's the American dream.
937115417113452546 2017-12-02 00:25:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ScienceHoffman Lol. So...you literally have nothing? You're adorable.
937115281842950144 2017-12-02 00:24:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound What about yours? You think he would approve or disapprove. Based on his teachings?
937115071997759489 2017-12-02 00:23:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Yeah...I get that your party approved spending more than we make, increasing our debt, and lowering the govt income by giving breaks to the wealthy. Do YOU get it?
937114668228804608 2017-12-02 00:22:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Really? Government provides nothing? Police? Fire? Military protection? Laws? Nothing?
937114418252357633 2017-12-02 00:21:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I No, but the more of their money the keep, the more of my money is needed to make up the difference.
937114260085362688 2017-12-02 00:20:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I You can read? Or, wait, have you use heard the book referenced and thought it'd make you sound smart?
937113966651813888 2017-12-02 00:19:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Lol. Your people just agreed to raise the deficit by a Trillion bucks, and give tax breaks for privates jets & golf coirses while increasing the burden on the poor and working class. Sounds like a great idea.
937113341964771328 2017-12-02 00:16:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Not at all. I like small govt. Govt who protects all of us equally, & maintains that equality. Keeps things just and fair. Maintains order. Provides benefits. You know, government stuff.
937112892251492352 2017-12-02 00:14:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Taxes are a necessary part of a functional society. Govt collects from all of us. Why should more of MY money be taken so that THEIR money doesnt?
937112531054813184 2017-12-02 00:13:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Not at all, but I'd rather protect the shoer than the guy who owns the company and has amassed a fortune.
937112256395075586 2017-12-02 00:12:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I I love it when I win. #GodwinsLaw
937111936348467200 2017-12-02 00:11:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Yeah...about that...so god gave us original sin, made us in his image, then came to us as his son, sacrificed himself, to himself, so that we could be forgiven for the burden he gave us the begin with? Makes sense. Anyway, explain to me how Jesus would feel about Trump.
937110770877456384 2017-12-02 00:06:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I And you assume if we give that guy an extra 100K a year he'll pass it along to those other people. But he won't. He'll keep it, and probably lay off a few of those 12 guys anyway because he found a way to automate their jobs.
937110300226187264 2017-12-02 00:04:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I I care about truth, honesty, fairness, and equalty. I care about the best interests of this country and the majority of th people in it. Not sure why you dont.
937109974504951814 2017-12-02 00:03:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Fascists gonna fascism.
937109867164258310 2017-12-02 00:02:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound "A false witness" isn't a person? Also, they all describe traits of people. You're being willfully obtuse.
937109614251986944 2017-12-02 00:01:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I How does it work then? Why should the ultra rich have less of a burden than the poor or middle class?
937109441358508032 2017-12-02 00:01:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @MusicByJules @JSmithC5I Hahahahaha. You believe that? Then why don't you make a Billion dollars a year? Do you just not want to? Earned is a very loose term.
937109123627454465 2017-12-02 00:00:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I No, but when you pay your taxes, your numbers go down at a much more noticeable rate than theirs does.
937108788016041984 2017-12-02 23:58:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Ok...let's say I you make $30K and I make $500K.   After tax you pay $4.5K, & I pay $75K.   Now, the big question, who is more burdened by their tax? The guy with only $25.5K left to provide for his family? Or the guy with $425K left to provide for his family?
937107204779503617 2017-12-02 23:52:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @gardedan @JSmithC5I Again, you don't understand what proportional means, & you aren't being intellectually honest.
937106257986621440 2017-12-02 23:48:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan How? Why do you assume a rich person works harder than a coal miner? Or a person working two or three jobs to make ends meet? Or a factory worker? Or a janitor? Get real.
937105731588886529 2017-12-02 23:46:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @MusicByJules @JSmithC5I Wow...you are adorable. Roughly $13T in income is earned every year. The top 20% takes $9.1T. The bottom 80% takes $3.9T. Understand yet? #NumbersAreFun #ReadMoreTweetLess #MathForDummies
937104632035364865 2017-12-02 23:42:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan Explain to me how that makes any sense? Especially when every action the GOP makes gives a larger portion of pie to the richest of the rich?   You believe that if we give the rich all of the pie, they'll at least share the crust. But instead, the keep all of it & demand more pie.
937103872467849216 2017-12-02 23:39:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound I beg to differ...pic.twitter.com/YTnpOMtdPG
937103171045949440 2017-12-02 23:36:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @MusicByJules The top 20% also took home almost 70% of all the income earned in the country. The top 1% takes home 20%.  The bottom 80% only took home 30%...combined.  Educate YOURself before you try to come at me kiddo.
937102065633058817 2017-12-02 23:31:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I Equality of opportunities? Are you mental?  A rich kid born to a rich family who buys his way into an ivy league school, inherits his wealth, and takes over a business he didn't start, has equal opportunity to a kid born in poverty? You have to be smoking something.
937101392052924416 2017-12-02 23:29:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan A Billionaire paying millions in taxes isn't going to hurt them. But a middle class family, living paycheck to paycheck, paying a few thousand is going to crush them. The rich don't need a tax break. It's about what's fair, what's proportional.
937100919073837058 2017-12-02 23:27:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I @gardedan False, actually. Not sure why you love rich people, but wealth inequality in this country is higher than its been since the 1920's. The top 1% have more wealth than almost all other Americans combined.
937099165636718592 2017-12-02 23:20:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Uh, no. It's a real thing. You just don't want to admit it because it's uncomfortable for you.
937098961588047872 2017-12-02 23:19:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @wotmeighn @Ifrit357 Slavery only ended 150 years ago. Civil rights happened only a few decades ago. And even since then white people in power have intentionally kept black people from advancing out of racism, prejudice, & stereotypes. White people set blacks up to fail, then blamed them for failing.
937097860415401986 2017-12-02 23:15:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ScienceHoffman So, not understanding how GOP lawmakers handwriting notes into the margins of the tax bill hours before voting on it is ok, means I don't understand English? Or, maybe you can't explain it so you're resorting to logical fallacies to make it seem as if you have a tenable position?
937055694834098177 2017-12-02 20:27:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> All great questions...https://twitter.com/GlennKesslerWP/status/937019934835658754

937055363765035010 2017-12-02 20:26:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Exactly what I was saying. This isn't what red state voters wanted. #TaxScamBill #GOPTaxScamhttps://twitter.com/TheAuthorGuy/status/936870647510089729
937027599402000384 2017-12-02 18:36:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I So yeah, keep it proportional to wealth.
937027527524143104 2017-12-02 18:35:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I The column in the left is a large number of people who live below, or right around the poverty level. 50% of people earn $1.56T cpmbined. The top 1% earn $2.47T. The column on the right are literal billionaires. Wealth inequality is rampant in this country.
936821711378325505 2017-12-01 04:57:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @JRubinBlogger @JSmithC5I Let's keep it proportional.

936602627474849793 2017-12-01 14:27:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The death of #KateSteinle was tragic, but it was also an accident. People keep acting like she was gunned down mercilessly.

936599616518328320 2017-12-01 14:15:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow By definition, yeah. I wouldn't disagree. However, that also wasn't pursued, and he was found not guilty of murder & voluntary manslaughter.  Again, my notes are not necessarily to you. More to people like the president and so many other people calling for this guy's head.

936593155218079746 2017-12-01 13:49:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump It was irrelevant to establishing motive, or intent. Having a record doesn't mean youre automatically guilty, that knowledge would cloud judgment & influence a decision rather than focusing on the evidence of the case.

936585094109843457 2017-12-01 13:17:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow It means he didn't commit murder. I think it was show he pulled the trigger, or at least was holding the weapon at the time of firing. Sometimes, there isn't a malicious intent, it was an unfortunate accident. I could point to several similar cases of accidental misfires.

936471276742414336 2017-11-30 05:45:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Which is it @WalshFreedom? Innocent until proven guilty, or guilty because you say so?

936461943505870848 2017-11-30 05:08:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @WalshFreedom Found innocent by a jury of his peers. Haven't you folks been saying "innocent until proven guilty" about Roy Moore? Well this guy is innocent according to the law. So, do you believe the stuff you say, or don't you? Be consistent, otherwise you aren't serious.
936460546727120902 2017-11-30 05:02:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DonaldJTrumpJr Batshit craziness of this tweet aside, what kind of thinking has you use "4" instead of "for" and then two words later you spell it out? You have 280 characters.   Also, 2 year olds aren't in "school." Daycare maybe, but not even preschool starts until age 3.
936459786400518144 2017-11-30 04:59:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> No...but a good school would be having that kid talk to a social worker who would probably recommend a home visit from CPS.https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/144505633981468672

936435118465568769 2017-11-30 03:21:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DougDeMuro So.....where would you put it on the scale?
936434558026813440 2017-11-30 03:19:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @By_SJD Exactly. They will rally around any argument that fits their immediate need only to abandon it when it contradicts what they want to believe based on their own prejudice. It's why I think most evangelicals don't really believe in the bible.
936433818524880901 2017-11-30 03:16:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Not you necessarily. But a lot of conservatives lately have been defending Moore with the "innocent until proven guilty" and "due process" arguments. And those same people are now refusing to accept a jury decision. According to the law, he is innocent. Can't have it both ways.
936432786243760128 2017-11-30 03:12:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Possibly, although he was found not guilty of that as well.   My point is all too often people will take a strict, hardline position on a topic only to abandon it when it doesn't suit them. These people are phonies. If you believe in the law, you have to say this man is innocent.

936426382137217024 2017-11-30 02:47:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MarkRuffalo @HeJEMony To be completely fair, we never would have gotten any part of the MCU if not for @SonyPictures & @20thcenturyfox proving Superhero movies could be successful with X-Men & Spider-Man in the early 2000's. Give credit where it's due.   But I'm also stoked af for #InfinityWar
936424709842980864 2017-11-30 02:40:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The same people who defended #RoyMoore screaming "Innocent until proven guilty," are the same ones saying Zarate is guilty of the murder of #KateSteinle AFTER he was found innocent by a jury.   If conservatives can't be consistent in their beliefs, how can we take them seriously?
936423232705650688 2017-11-30 02:34:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow He was found not guilty by a jury. What was it you guys said about Roy Moore...innocent until proven guilty? Was that it? This man was found innocent. So...is he? Be consistent in your outrage and in your beliefs or admit you aren't serious about them.

935580941807996928 2017-11-28 18:47:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @wotmeighn *Sigh* so you made the charts? Or you found them somewhere, assumed they were true, & shared them.
935570303853441026 2017-11-28 18:05:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @wotmeighn So much is wrong here. First, your math is wrong. Then check your demographics, & also socioeconomic status, & also systematic prejudice, & also population density, & also location, & also a million other factors.

935444643692662784 2017-11-28 09:45:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Just a quick reminder that if you don't dislike Trump for his political views, at least you can dislike him because he's a shitty comedian.
935442753198133248 2017-11-28 09:38:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @wotmeighn Everyone commits crimes. Every race, religion, sex, nationality, and so on. Everyone. This isn't new. Not sure what your point is.
935441484643553283 2017-11-28 09:33:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 So, yeah...Colin is a piece of shit. Oh, & since I wasn't ever really arguing with Colin, it wasn't ad hominem. Merely a character review of the person he is.
935441054085582849 2017-11-28 09:31:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Because it has just enough truth to seem authentic. And as you share, repeat, and endorse the lie it becomes harder to refute, even though it's a lie, because now people are invested in it. They need it to be true, or else...they were wrong. They were fooled.
935440679160950784 2017-11-28 09:30:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Without taking into consideration the actual words Biden said, the context, the date he said it, etc., you aren't getting the full story. And liars depend on that. They depend on you not doing the research because you WANT it to be true.
935439989177049088 2017-11-28 09:27:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 For example, remember when McConnell claimed he was enacting the "Biden Rule" when refusing to appoint a supreme court justice? He was saying "Biden once said we shouldn't appoint in an election year." That was intellectually dishonest. It was a false narrative.
935439482249195521 2017-11-28 09:25:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 Funny thing about "facts," when taken out of context, they can be used to create a lie. Happens all the time. By ignoring some data and giving more gravity to less important data you can spin a web of deceit.
935438611914416128 2017-11-28 09:21:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @Ifrit357 I'm pretty strict in my distaste for people who use incomplete data to push a false narrative. He uses his education, background, etc. as a way to validate his prejudices, lend an air of expertise & manipulate others. It's intellectually dishonest.
935437200954716160 2017-11-28 09:16:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty Also, he doesnt tell "the truth" about anything. He uses the data he likes and discards the data that doesn't match up to his narrative. YOU think it's true because his words match up to what YOU already think is true based on your own prejudice. So you accept it without question
935435586042724352 2017-11-28 09:09:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @_fu_ckliberals_ Or, and stay with me here ad this gets a little tricky, MAYBE the person spreading a false narrative with intellectually dishonest data, under the guise of an educated position, to spread conspiracy theories & white nationalist rhetoric, is the piece of shit. Just maybe.
935433503608631296 2017-11-28 09:01:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @colinflaherty @revisorysix8038 I'm not sure you know what an argument is, as I'm obviously not debating anything here. But, let's say I was. Well, you're wrong again because any position taken on a subject is, by definition, an argument. Soooooo.....try again?
935245494468653056 2017-11-27 20:34:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> It's well known that conservatives hate educated people. They really hate educated people who aren't white.

933410919056642048 2017-11-22 19:04:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Fair enough. I'm sure we disagree on many aspects of gun ownership, & gun control. But as long as we agree about not letting lobbyists create laws we have something in common good sir.
933405849049059328 2017-11-22 18:44:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Not disagreeing. But you have to admit they hold significant political lobbying power. So, are you for getting lobbyists out of government, or just the ones you don't agree with? Be consistent.

Besides being an adult male with the correct genitalia. Is he humble? Does he take responsibility? Does he treat women with respect? Is he polite? Kind? Modest? Respectful? By what metric is he a man?

And no other president asked for gratitude, or demanded respect. A man doesn't do the right thing for recognition. A man does the right thing because its right. Trump is the poster boy for petulant, entitled, spoiled toddlers.
933346464553754624 2017-11-22 14:48:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump I mean, Jim Banks is still garbage, but at least he sounds like an adult.

If your child acted the way Trump does (lying, not taking responsibility, bullying, insulting, not being humble, etc.) you wouldn't accept it. You expect less of your president than you do your children. Trump was never taught how to be a man.

Weird priorities bro.

Especially in Middle America. I would say most of his voters still didn't know much about it.

930460876087455744 2017-11-14 15:42:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @marybschneider @DavidAFrench I agree, but it is also important to point out that the vast majority of people who voted Clinton into office had no idea he was a scumbag. The people who voted Trump, & support Roy Moore know exactly who they are before election day. And theu vote for them anyway.

930402506454298624 2017-11-14 11:50:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @dancanon @JomaChameleon The way to beat Trey is point out how little he has in common with the people in #IN09.   When is 1/2 price day at Goodwill? How much student loan debt do you have? When was the last time you got a payday loan? How can you represent the people, when you don't know their lives?
930401760803467264 2017-11-14 11:47:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If he could drop the British accent, & beef up a bit, Clive Owen has the look of Bruce Wayne, ability to play complex characters, & the action hero chops. Which is also why I say he should be James Bond, but whatever.https://twitter.com/mikeyface/status/930239110014537728
930401280706727936 2017-11-14 11:45:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @peteholmes @mikeyface Honestly, if he could pull off an American accent & beef up a little, I think Clive Owen would be a contender. He can definitely pull off brooding, dark, badass, & millionaire playboy.
930399923698315264 2017-11-14 11:40:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @peteholmes @mikeyface That being said, let me immediately point out that Affeck is probably the best Bruce Wayne as far as appearance and such, but his Batman sucks balls. Mostly because he talks too much, & the directing/costume choices are terrible.
930399840835686401 2017-11-14 11:39:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mikeyface I mean @peteholmes can play a convincing Batman.
930398697581613056 2017-11-14 11:35:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mikeyface Seriously though. Anyone can play Batman. Batman isn't hard. You look serious, don't smile, & talk in a low voice. Bruce Wayne is the harder character to play. Because Bruce Wayne is the mask.

929569987400028160 2017-11-11 04:42:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump Having elections free from foreign influence is a good thing. Having a president who cares about truth & their country is a good thing. Not endorsing, tolerating, or befriending tyrants is a good thing. A free press is a good thing. A babbling, old, ignorant POTUS is a bad thing.

928693938365652992 2017-11-09 18:41:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 You've had 3 returns for estates with assets over $11 Million in the past 24 years? How many returns do you do a year? Hundreds? Seems like those 3 are.................rare.
928693435942436867 2017-11-09 18:39:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Every dollar that businesses, the wealthy, corporations, etc. don't pay will need to be made up for somewhere. Historically that means the burden shifts to the middle class. And frankly, I'm sick of it.
928692668737163270 2017-11-09 18:36:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Literally, no one would benefit from the repeal of the estate tax except for the ultra wealthy. The reason non-wealthy people want to repeal it is because of the belief by most Americans that they're 1 lucky break away from being ultra-rich.
928692238716153856 2017-11-09 18:34:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 I have, am, and will continue to defend the estate tax. You're not being intellectually honest about it. Most farms, businesses, etc also operate as LLCs. Which again, removes them as assets and takes them out of consideration in an estate.

928684694388043776 2017-11-09 18:04:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 This makes it even more rare. As most family businesses & farms are titled/deeded to their children before they die. By removing these assets from their worth, they aren't able to be taxed.
928684190031368193 2017-11-09 18:02:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Find me an example of farmland being valued at $100K/acre, otherwise admit you were wrong. Plus, I'm not saying it's impossible for any small business or farm to be over $11 Million in value, but it isn't the norm. It's rare. & it only applies for a sudden death.
928682714663964673 2017-11-09 17:56:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Personally, even if I had an estate worth over $11 Million, I wouldn't want my kids to get all of it. I'd want them to create their own success instead of live off of their parent's hard word for the rest of their lives.
928681587616768001 2017-11-09 17:51:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Not hating on success, being reasonable. Farmers do a lot of great work, and they also benefit from several government programs, loans, etc. Farm equipment is expensive, but $11 Million dollars more than covers most Farms.
928681070136094724 2017-11-09 17:49:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 There is not a single place I know of where farmland is worth $100K an acre. But don't take my word for it...https://www.agweb.com/land/farmland-value-guide/
928680449517543427 2017-11-09 17:47:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Math Time: The average Farm in America is 434 Acres, & let's say farmland is worth about $10K per acre (at least in Indiana), that makes land value $4,340,000. A lot, but still far less than the $11 Million mark.
928674946091573249 2017-11-09 17:25:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 A web designer might have a computer or two, maybe an office he rents, but nothing major or worth Tens of Millions of dollars. Same with Bookkeeping, & Computer Repair. A Mechanic or Bakery will have specialized equipment, but nowhere NEAR $11 Million worth, even with property.
928674518670995457 2017-11-09 17:23:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bison63648 Again, most small, family owned businesses do not have assets worth over $11 Million. Very, very few of the top 5 most popular small businesses in America (bookkeeping, computer repair, car repair, web design, & bakery) would have those kinds of assets.

But you should, because that's where the truth is.
928668721878532097 2017-11-09 17:00:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @monte1223 @SenFeinstein @BAKlepac @CreepersTKOED We also don't like feeling dumb, or admitting we were wrong. Humans prefer a conspiracy theory to no theory, & we'll go out of our way to justify incorrect information, & avoid uncomfortable truths. The smartest thing to say sometimes is "I don't know, but I'll look into it."
928668013821382656 2017-11-09 16:58:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @monte1223 @SenFeinstein @BAKlepac @CreepersTKOED I get it kid, truly I do. But the best advice I can give to anyone is to always question the things they WANT to believe. Humans are built to gravitate towards things that make them comfortable, & therefore we don't apply the same level of proof to claims that make us feel good.
928666832499892224 2017-11-09 16:53:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree If your heirs need more than $11 Million in order to survive, you didn't raise them right. Maybe if you Cons cared more about teaching hard work, character, humility, & values to your kids they would be able to manage on that measly sum.
928665977616830465 2017-11-09 16:49:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @AmandzStonebree @bravemanfan Wow...you guys have no idea, at all, what the estate tax is. A married couple can leave $5.49 Million dollars, EACH, to their heirs completely untaxed. The estate tax only applies to assets OVER that $11 Million Dollars they can shelter.
928664497333637120 2017-11-09 16:44:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AnnCoulter Literally, the only people that would benefit from repeal of the estate tax are the rich and ultra rich. So that they can pass their wealth onto their kids, keeping the playing field as unlevel as possible for the generations to come.
928664219469406209 2017-11-09 16:42:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AnnCoulter Let's break this down a bit more to help any idiot that believe this tripe. You are allowed to leave $5.49 Million to your heirs, untaxed, per individual. Which means a married couple can shield $11 Million for their heirs with no taxes. The "Upper MIddle Class" is below that.
928662806022508547 2017-11-09 16:37:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @joeparky @DeftAirshot Quick question....do you know what the estate tax is?

You keep thinking you can take down the US Military in the event of a despotic leader, I'll keep trying to put the right people in government to ensure that never happens.

And even if you could, you couldn't get the shells. Also, armed drones are still illegal in most places, but when I refer to drones I mean drones with missiles, not a hobby toy with a handgun strapped to it.
928501100474458112 2017-11-08 05:54:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @joeparky Ummmm....nope. I don't know many people with assets worth 5 million dollars. Most people dont. Average Americans don't.

And you think you should be allowed to have a. F-18? Nuclear missiles? Armed drones? Fully armed tanks?

928493897344528385 2017-11-08 05:26:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AnnCoulter @mscrlet31 Luckily you had an estate worth over 5 million dollars to start with, though it had to be hard to sell one of your diamond dog collars.
928493129937883137 2017-11-08 05:23:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter Only on estates over 5 million dollars. Be intellectually honest or don't even try.

Now they have destroyers, missiles, drones, tanks, fully automatic weapons, body armor, etc...and you think you can stop the army?

928444409913454594 2017-11-08 02:09:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack @mdlivengood Sure...they only had to gerrymander districts, commit treason, and keep minorities from voting to do it. The bar for things to be proud of must be pretty low for Trump supporters.
928443603860512768 2017-11-08 02:06:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Local elections are vastly more important to the average person than federal. Support local candidates like Sheila, & help spread the word.https://twitter.com/VoteSheilaB/status/921087633153036288

928442717054623744 2017-11-08 02:02:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack I would argue that local government is far, far, far more important to the average person than federal government. If you're a Hoosier, & you don't like how things are going, look at your state legislature. One party has all the power, hold them accountable.
928441512412811264 2017-11-08 01:58:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @dancanon I will be. When I ran in 2014 I was the only contested race on my ballot...that's the first problem. Get every race contested, there is power in numbers. You just better take down Trey.
928440607168716800 2017-11-08 01:54:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack When GOP took supermajority control in Ibdiana, they gerrymandered the districts to guarantee they always would. Republicans do not have to listen to the people, campaign, or even try to win. And they know it.

928439234742104065 2017-11-08 01:48:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack As a Hoosier, a Democrat, & someone who ran for State Senate in a very Republican district in Indiana in 2014, I couldn't agree more.   Indiana has been under supermajority Republican rule for far too long, & we've suffered because of it. #FlipIndiana

He was purposefully misleading supporters. Your other option is that Trump was WRONG about his endorsement, & his base didn't listen to him. Pick one.

Execs are less interested in making a good movie than making big money. But, when your content sucks, your money suffers. Put the movies in the hands of the writers & directors, & get a better casting director.
928345957527441408 2017-11-08 19:38:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Joelle_Jones @Remender @TomKingTK @beckycloonan @TomHolland1996 @UniStudios 4) Get. Better. Directors. I can't stress this enough. Get a director with a passion for great stories, suspense, character development, & drama. @netflix does a great job with this. Duffer Brothers with @Stranger_Things, @z_al with The OA, or Phil Abraham from @Daredevil.

I know it's tempting to think you can improve on classic monsters with huge CGI budgets, but it comes off looking ridiculous. Use an 80/20 ratio with the larger number being practical. Think Star Wars original Yoda vs Prequels Yoda.
928342122037678081 2017-11-08 19:23:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomHolland1996 @UniStudios 2) Put the story first. The story is the most important thing. More than money. More than product placement. It's story. Get some great writers who understand the characters, like comic book writers. @beckycloonan @TomKingTK @Remender @Joelle_Jones & Matt Fraction come to mind.
928339365151105025 2017-11-08 19:12:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UniStudios 1) Get young, talented, up & coming actors instead of focusing on the "star power" of aging action heroes. Bad casting takes people out of the story. It's why Spider-Man sucked before @TomHolland1996 & why IT was so successful this year.

That he "always speaks his mind" & he's "not politically correct." If thats true, either Trump was wrong about how great Gillespie is, OR he purposely misled his base to vote for someone he didn't believe in.
928298688396627968 2017-11-08 16:30:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ericbolling @mhixon0001 @toopee2000 @ChaconRobert I'm not creating an issue. I just want you to accept an honest truth. Trump supporters are blasting Gillespie, but Trump endorsed him. He didn't have to, after all, Trump supporters also say this wasn't an important election.
928297891990528000 2017-11-08 16:27:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ericbolling @toopee2000 @ChaconRobert @mhixon0001 Except, no. Trump specifically told his base Gillespie was great and they should vote for him. Mike Pence called him a friend (which DJT retweeted). Stop bending over backwards to make excuses for him. Either Trump was wrong, or he purposely misled his base. Choose one.pic.twitter.com/7xurvGxWDh

But, to clarify, your position is that Trump encouraged his base to vote for a guy he himself didn't believe in, and against what he stands for? Is that what your saying? Because, that sounds...swampy.

928284111437025280 2017-11-08 15:32:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @trumps_feed @foxandfriends Most illegal guns, in general, are obtained this way. They don't buy them from the manufacturer & then sell them out of a truck. And no matter what people claim, you do not know a place a half mile from your home where you can go bup an illegal gun.
928283645433049088 2017-11-08 15:30:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @trumps_feed @foxandfriends "If a criminal wants a gun he'll get a gun," you say. Except...no.  Most of these mass shootings are done with guns that are stolen, bought legally, bought for them by a friend or relative, or bought through private sale. Not criminal black markets.

A baseball bat, a knife, a truck, or an AR15 with extended mags?   It's an easy choice right? I'd take any of the first three over the gun...& so would you.
928282118186323968 2017-11-08 15:24:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @trumps_feed @foxandfriends "Take away guns & they just use another weapon," you shout. Ok.  Let's say we agree, & that a person intent on killing is going to kill with or without a gun. Wouldn't you rather them be without? It's about severity.
928280878555566081 2017-11-08 15:19:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @trumps_feed @foxandfriends "Gun control won't stop all mass shootings," I hear you shouting at your screen. No shit. No law is 100% effective. Stop with the "all or nothing" mentality. Its a matter of frequency. If gun control meant 1 less death, it'd be worth it.
928280195618037763 2017-11-08 15:16:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @trumps_feed @foxandfriends No serious person wants to ban all guns, & no one is coming to take your guns away. But to bury your head in the sand and say nothing can be done, or that nothing should be done, is preposterous, and dangerous bordering on evil.

Trump DIDN'T have to endorse Gillespie, & he DIDN'T have to push his supporters to vote for him. But he did.  So, was Trump wrong? Or was he being dishonest? And why didn't his base listen to him? Do they not trust his judgement?

928131212996116480 2017-11-07 05:24:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ericbolling @mhixon0001 So, the Trump wasn't wrong, he knew Gillespie was an unattractive swamp person and would be bad for his base, but actively endorsed him anyway. He was just lying to his supporters about his feelings. Right?

928092311149514752 2017-11-07 02:50:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ericbolling @ruhokie81 Virginia is gerrymandered as hell in favor of the Republican party. This election was a referendum on Trump, & his policies.
928091969091522560 2017-11-07 02:49:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ericbolling @mhixon0001 Weird that Trump's base didn't find Gillespie attractive when their leader endorsed him, & told his base to vote for him. So, was Trump wrong?

928089946187096064 2017-11-07 02:41:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Indiana is the same. Gerrymandered to protect the Republican super majority. If it can happen in #Virginia it can happen in #Indiana. Let's get to work. #VirginiaElection #VAGovhttps://twitter.com/mattmfm/status/928078723345199105

928046675788206081 2017-11-07 23:49:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @eroyor @TrumpArmy57 @MoMom2two @mrbishvibes @kb0viy Let's say you're trained, you're still not Jason Bourne. You're going to have adrenaline rushing, looking for the shooter, and trying to protect your family all at the same time. Minimum a minute goes by before you react with a shot.
928046282207367168 2017-11-07 23:47:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @eroyor @TrumpArmy57 @MoMom2two @mrbishvibes @kb0viy You think people won't scream/flee from a guy with a bat or a knife? And as people run, they obstruct your view, throw off your aim, etc. Plus, people can't outrun bullets. If you shoot at someone running away, or at a large crowd running away, it's just as deadly.
928045785853329408 2017-11-07 23:45:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Been reading some new reports, and while I can't tell whether the shooter was leaving when he was engaged, or whether being engaged made him stop shooting. Again though, if he did I'll be more than happy to say so. I'll keep looking.
928043635786084354 2017-11-07 23:36:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Nothing makes me more motivated to become president someday than the idea of christening the USS Barack Obama & inviting Ann Coulter to view it with front row seats.https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/928027446158426119

928040001677484032 2017-11-07 23:22:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Never said he wasn't a good guy, but I'll stick to what we actually know happened.
928039728884125697 2017-11-07 23:21:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Is that a new report? Because it conflicts with everything I've read up to now.
928039541113589762 2017-11-07 23:20:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Again, we can speculate, but that's all. We'll never know. And, maybe it's just me, buy I don't think a quick death by bullet was enough justice for this guy. It's probably what he wanted.
928038545624850437 2017-11-07 23:16:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @eroyor @TrumpArmy57 @MoMom2two @mrbishvibes @kb0viy I mean, seriously, you are drinking the kool-aid hard if your official position is that a maniac without a gun is more dangerous than a maniac with a gun.
928038079369269248 2017-11-07 23:14:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @eroyor @TrumpArmy57 @MoMom2two @mrbishvibes @kb0viy You think you could hear a suppressed AR15 in a crowd of people? How many shots could a shooter get off before you draw your weapon, locate the shooter, & fire? In 1 minute a shooter could kill dozens. A guy with a bat, probably no fatalities. You can outrun a bat.
928035141527719936 2017-11-07 23:03:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BillOReilly @Holly1970a Ok, so what level of evidence will you accept? What is your threshold? Is anything you disagree with fake? What would it take for you to say you're wrong?
928033985783062528 2017-11-07 22:58:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> You know, he has a point. If some psychopath wants to hurt people, but can't get a gun, he would really have no choice but to become an explosives expert, obtain the proper licenses to buy the materials, & crash without being knocked out.

928028380024463360 2017-11-07 22:36:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Guys...I think...wait...is it possible that Twitter gave me #280characters?

927944840742100992 2017-11-07 17:04:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Oil_Guns_Merica & while I'm glad the NRA member gave chase, dealing vigilante justice isn't his job, & with the shooter dead we now have no info on motive
927944645010771968 2017-11-07 17:03:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Oil_Guns_Merica Also, the shooter was only "stopped" by an NRA member after killing 26 people & leaving the scene. Chase ensued followed by a shoot out.
927944424499400706 2017-11-07 17:02:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Oil_Guns_Merica Fact: The NRA wields massive power of the GOP, helps write laws for submission, & advises on how to vote. Be Intellectually Honest.

927938456826843138 2017-11-07 16:39:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Neither do you. It makes you feel better to think the "good guy" saved lives so it fits your narrative, I'm just going off of the facts.
927937858140360705 2017-11-07 16:36:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Before you vote today in #Virginia it's important to know @EdWGillespie's favorite TV episode ever is the finale of How I Met Your Mother.

927624070002364416 2017-11-06 19:49:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @WayneEinarson Probably, though i'm not sure why. The fact is guns are designed to kill as their primary function. The AR platform makes it easier to kill.

927613979362562048 2017-11-06 19:09:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @rjerue I never said a gun ban. I said stricter laws, more regulation, licensing requirements, & registration.
927611350943137794 2017-11-06 18:59:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 I'll refer you to my previous tweets...
927611207166709761 2017-11-06 18:58:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 Understandable. I thought I explained it. Blame these 140 characters.
927611002321063937 2017-11-06 18:57:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @rjerue No problem with that. And at the same time we can tighten up gun conrrol and introduce new regulation and laws. See, you can do both.
927610618802311168 2017-11-06 18:56:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @LadyDi101 @livinezdon You mean...the ability...to...Kill?  Oh, & yeah, guns were designed to kill human people. Soooooo...they're doing what they are intended for
927610133257052160 2017-11-06 18:54:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @rjerue And the exchange was while driving, after the massacre. The killer ran off the road and then engaged. Xhase guy did good, but didn't stop it
927609360611774465 2017-11-06 18:51:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @rjerue Mental health is a scapegoat, & you know it. It makes you feel better to think these people aren't like you. Focus on making killing harder
927608922822905856 2017-11-06 18:49:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @abenrml @livinezdon Secondary purpose to the main reason they are made. To kill. End of list. Like I said, I can cut a log with a hammer.
927608511634255872 2017-11-06 18:47:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @groomos I agree. But why make it EASIER for them to cause the maximum amount of damage? Here is a simple equation bat<knife<truck<GUN
927608023706750976 2017-11-06 18:46:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @LadyDi101 @livinezdon The purpose is to kill whatever you aim it at. Designed to kill people first. If you want one for sport buy a paintball gun.
927607588904153088 2017-11-06 18:44:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @fyodor007 @mhodeezy Awwwww. Trying to povot and change the narrative. If it werent pathetic itd be adorable.   Cut the crap matty. Stay on topic.
927607071138336768 2017-11-06 18:42:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @fyodor007 @mhodeezy You're deflecting to avoid the real issue. You're making a false equivalence to try and find tenable ground. But you cant. Stay on topic.
927606867861299201 2017-11-06 18:41:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @fyodor007 @mhodeezy Stay on topic matt. A car isn't meant to kill, & resulting deaths are accidental. Guns kill as their primary function. Malicous. Understand?
927606383960317953 2017-11-06 18:39:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 Are you being willfully obtuse?
927606303022899201 2017-11-06 18:39:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 Well, I explained it. So you can keep being but hurt, or accept that I didn't adequately express my point, but now I have, and move on.
927605833151713280 2017-11-06 18:37:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @larrydraper Creating weapons that kill more easily, bullets that guarantee death, extended magazines so you can keep shooting, & marketing to scum. Yeah
927605556155703296 2017-11-06 18:36:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @dahl_kennedy Name me one time you saw that happen outside of a movie.
927605452686446597 2017-11-06 18:35:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @GetShotinBKLYN Semi automatic, magazine fed, pistol grip, folding stock, capable of rapid fire, can take extended magazines, low recoil, deadly.
927605103145750528 2017-11-06 18:34:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera Sigh...don't bury your head too far in the sand buddy
927604746667651072 2017-11-06 18:33:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @BZwallz Not the best tool for either defense or hunting. But definitely one of the best for close quarters combat and high body counts.
927604499350540289 2017-11-06 18:32:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @HeisenbergScien Because if YOU had been there this never would have happened.pic.twitter.com/YCjziZEbRP
927604203186421760 2017-11-06 18:30:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @mdlogsdon That's ignorant. Focus on the person, & how they killed so you can prevent it. The gun made killing easy. Let's not do that anymore.
927603829436223488 2017-11-06 18:29:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @WayneEinarson Every tool has an intended purpose. You can use a hammer to cut a log, it's just not the most efficient. A gun is a killing weapon. Get it?
927603513550692353 2017-11-06 18:28:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @LadyDi101 Trucks being used as weapons is not their intended purpose. The intended purpose of a gun is to kill. See the difference? It's subtle...
927603025606299648 2017-11-06 18:26:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @abenrml Except knives are made with several purposes. Guns are made to kill. That's it. They have no other use. Just to bring death.
927602751122571266 2017-11-06 18:25:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @GeraldoRivera It's literally against the law in the United States to sue a gun manufacturer for negligence or class action.
927602411090345984 2017-11-06 18:23:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @bostock_jamieJB Bullshit. Most people are law abiding citizens who will definitely obey gun laws. The trick 's to make it easy to find those who dont.
927601829424386048 2017-11-06 18:21:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @groomos About the dumbest thing people say in response to a debate about gun control. "If we take away cars they'll just use rollerskates."
927601443628027905 2017-11-06 18:19:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey Look, nothing will stop all murder, but we can at least make it harder to kill people.
927601265550548992 2017-11-06 18:19:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Baby_Booey You mean...if we took away their guns they'd attack with a less deadly weapon? Oh nooooooooooo......
927601021886648320 2017-11-06 18:18:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @rjerue No...he wasn't "stopped" by a legal gun owner. He was CHASED by one after he left the church. He was STOPPED by running out of bullets.
927600767019704324 2017-11-06 18:17:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @DamianPanton @uneducatedthug So...you read it out loud to yourself so that you could hear it? Weird...
927600372830568451 2017-11-06 18:15:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan If a terrorist was on their way to attack where your family is, what weapon would you rather they have? Knife, gun, or truck?
927600016973287425 2017-11-06 18:14:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @moniquesourdif Faaaaalllllsssseeee equivalence. Quit punting the ball to avoid the issue at hand.
927599742422528004 2017-11-06 18:13:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @MadlyChrissy So, your position is since we can't stop all crime, 100% of the time, we should do nothing? If even 1 child could be saved it's worth trying
927599020100542466 2017-11-06 18:10:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Craig22_AFC For starters.
927598958649556992 2017-11-06 18:10:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @Craig22_AFC National gun database requiring all guns be registered with yearly renewal. Bullets only sold to those with valid gun licenses/registration.
927598637919563777 2017-11-06 18:08:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @piersmorgan @randywhorton How would common sense gun control make you "suffer?" Would your suffering equal that of this child's parents? I doubt it, so piss off.
927597961244299264 2017-11-06 18:06:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @DougDeMuro More like 2018/2019/2020. Depending on when yours is delivered.
927597469147508736 2017-11-06 18:04:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @kenklippenstein @DavidKlion @Jahaza I was under the impression that court martialed, convicted & spent a year in jail would equate to felon status.
927597054087622656 2017-11-06 18:02:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @fyodor007 @mhodeezy & the majority are accidental. Whereas the majority of gun deaths are purposeful/malicious. Your false equivalence won't work on me.
927596327940362240 2017-11-06 17:59:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 Not really. Stricter gun control could prevent private sales to felons, family members helping, etc. How many knew he had it & said nothing?
927595861412057089 2017-11-06 17:57:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 You have to get past the "all or nothing" mentality. Nothing will stop 100% crime. But if common sense gun control saves 1 life its worth it
927595441830711296 2017-11-06 17:56:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 Sure...but why make it easier for them to create the most casualties in the shortest amount of time?
927595301728342017 2017-11-06 17:55:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 I was drawing a distinction. Saying he wasn't JUST charged. He was convicted. Meaning, guilty, not just accused. Sorry if it was confusing.
927594979983286273 2017-11-06 17:54:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @stillTrejax @LandsingPhoenix @fyodor007 Kind of a dick statement. But ok, I'll bite. How about a magazine-fed, military style rifle capable of rapid fire?
927593706416373760 2017-11-06 17:49:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chelseaperetti Word. Just adding some insight, for whatever that's worth.
927587204439990272 2017-11-06 17:23:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AndyRichter @MichaelSkolnik @mozumder @BasedBaxter So, you're saying that getting shot with a .22LR would be the same as getting hit by a .223? Be serious.
927575559399464961 2017-11-06 16:37:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren @jamesgray_56 @staywokeco Would you rather a terrorist attack your family with a gun, or a baseball bat? Because while "anything can be a weapon" they aren't equal.
927575187121496066 2017-11-06 16:35:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren How is keeping track of where the guns are, who owns them, & who they're sold too as well as common sense reform "stripping your rights?"
927573587770445825 2017-11-06 16:29:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BlondeinBklyn @MichaelSkolnik @LindaLouEck @pjwcnc @SkaraBohny @YourMasterTyler @DCJReviews @fyodor007 @mhodeezy Are you talking malicious loss of life or accidental loss of life? Because this is false equivalence. Cars are HEAVILY regulated for safety
927572099404845056 2017-11-06 16:23:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chelseaperetti Sadly, the money isn't the main driving force, it's fear of upsetting the base. The NRA has power to ruin campaigns by utilizing members.
927571777655656448 2017-11-06 16:21:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @markowenpilot False equivalence is a sad tool of weak arguments and small minds. Cars are not made to kill. We regulate them, heavily, & improve safety.
927571301740498944 2017-11-06 16:20:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @SouthernJetNC I call bullshit. Also, If you know where illegal guns are being sold, notify the police. Otherwise you're complicit.
927570851414925313 2017-11-06 16:18:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @jimborocks77 He wasn't charged...he was convicted, court martialed, & spent a year in prison.  Different thing.
927570072893296640 2017-11-06 16:15:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @MaryLousTweets Fact: you're a loon.
927569975702884353 2017-11-06 16:14:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @ikungfuyou2 Fact: he stopped shooting when he ran out of bullets. The good guy didn't stop him, he chased him after the murder spree.
927569744261246981 2017-11-06 16:13:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @Dan83634 Pretty easy really. Take what we do with cars, do it with guns, voila.
927569635574276098 2017-11-06 16:13:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @Dan83634 By making guns easier to track/keep tabs on. Harsh penalties for people selling weapons to felons. Expanded background checks. Etc.
927569127065247748 2017-11-06 16:11:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @venator7 Either way, dude beat his wife and kid. No way should he have a gun.
927569001630142464 2017-11-06 16:10:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @markalfordkc Yeah, it's like a felony conviction.
927568927382802432 2017-11-06 16:10:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @USPatriot06 Running out of bullets stopped him. The good guy chased him after he had murdered everyone. Get your facts straight.
927568676055912448 2017-11-06 16:09:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @SheriAlba Question: If creating a national registry, closing loopholes, testing for licenses, etc. Saved a single child's life, would it be worth it?
927568456458932225 2017-11-06 16:08:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GeraldoRivera @SheriAlba Uhhhhh...yeah we can. When society steps up & says "this is unnacceptable" change happens. Laws making it harder for criminals save lives.

927548692831318018 2017-11-06 14:50:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tierney_Megan Like, why was a low level intern sent on a trip to London? Or tasked with setting up meetings with foreign officials?
927548368943017989 2017-11-06 14:48:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tierney_Megan If we give the President the benefit of the doubt, & grant that Papadops was a nobody intern, that just raises more Q's...

927419460864049152 2017-11-05 06:16:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MichaelSkolnik @eurodpt @jackalxto More popular = easier to obtain. Also, more of a reputation surrounding them, more well known, etc.
927418096402477056 2017-11-05 06:11:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @yashar Is this real? What kind of buffoon with a thurd grade mentality does this? Oh...actually answered my own question. Carry on.
927391247056195584 2017-11-05 04:24:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren These things would deter a large number of gun deaths, & help the police track weapons & solve crimes. Seems obvious.
927390992541585408 2017-11-05 04:23:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren And if he did, he couldn't get bullets. At least not without someone else committing a crime. Which would have harsh punishments.
927390783702994945 2017-11-05 04:22:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren Any sale or purchase of a firearm would then have to be tracked, registered etc so that felons like this guy would be able to get a gun.
927390583378804736 2017-11-05 04:21:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren Also, bullets could be sold only to people with valid license/registration. Gun ranges would be required to check them as well.
927390375601496064 2017-11-05 04:21:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren Why not require written & skills tests for gun licenses as well as mandatory gun registration with yearly renewal? You know...like cars?

927388971549777920 2017-11-05 04:15:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TomiLahren The fact that this happened in Texas kind f blows the whole "if more people had guns this wouldn't happen" argument doesn't it?

927350700237119491 2017-11-05 01:43:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MichaelSkolnik How did this terrorist buy a gun when he was dishonorably discharged? Who sold it to him? Because, that's straight up illegal.
927350447236616194 2017-11-05 01:42:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MichaelSkolnik @eurodpt Easy to shoot. Easy to fire quickly. Extended magazines. Bump stocks. Low recoil. Deadly.

927215363728781312 2017-11-05 16:45:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hitRECordJoe Less than expected. More than I deserve.

927211880942366721 2017-11-05 16:31:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Mlllennial_Matt Wow...ya'll are the fucking worst.

926847161014374400 2017-11-04 16:22:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @trumps_feed @AnnCoulter @KeithHamby2 But have fun on your train keith. Surrounded with like minded people in your safe space where you're always right no matter the truth.

926588594621419520 2017-11-03 23:15:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump Probably laughing at you for not having the mildest understanding of the facts. You're wrong, you lie, & it's pathetic. Grow up. Be a man.

926558016186535936 2017-11-03 21:13:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow There is a place in Memphis called Lennys Subs that has an amazing philly cheesesteak. Wish I travelled there more often.
926477532068708352 2017-11-03 15:53:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Right...I don't think most Americans are against tax reform. But it should benefit MOST Americans. On paper, this verifiably does not.
926471565654491136 2017-11-03 15:30:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Also, I agree all politicians have probably lied, but what we have now is gaslighting, and constant lies. What is the breaking point?
926471275157098497 2017-11-03 15:28:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Hard to say, but just the fact that it was proposed as it is right now says a lot about the current state of the GOP, and who they work for.
926468882730225670 2017-11-03 15:19:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If there was ever a poster boy for solipsism, it's @realDonaldTrump. Pretty sure "I Am the Only One That Matters" is the textbook definition
926450067657166848 2017-11-03 14:04:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Not that YOU lied. But the White House is obviously gaslighting.
926449940817235969 2017-11-03 14:04:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Fair enough...I'm just referring to the analysis of the cut and what it looks like on paper. Also, it isn't biggest cut in history. Why lie?
926431861865373697 2017-11-03 12:52:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @therealbradg I was born in the world of my favorite part of the year. We are going through my mind and spirit of my life. You will have the same.
926424986956464128 2017-11-03 12:25:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Do you all deny that the GOP Tax Reform will, in fact, hurt the Middle Class and benefit the rich? Just curious.
926420629502529537 2017-11-03 12:07:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The worst thing is we now live in a world where Trump doing this himself wouldn't be immediately suspect. It would fit. #TrumpTweetshttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/926400054700756993

923308207782678531 2017-10-25 22:00:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Oh cool, Deathstroke is getting a movie. About time. Everyone was begging for a Deadpool movie without all the fun. We demand more brooding.
923306306269741056 2017-10-25 21:52:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tesla @chevrolet @ChevyElectric @redmarzman Don't leave. I've been using your tweets as grammar/spelling quizzes for my 6 year old. Though...they are a little below her skill level...

923241174227472384 2017-10-25 17:33:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tesla @chevrolet @ChevyElectric @redmarzman & by that point the Bolt will have a new model year...& Tesla will be behind the times. Your Model 3 will have dated tech & performance.
923240759083589633 2017-10-25 17:32:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tesla @chevrolet @ChevyElectric @redmarzman and for every Tesla ordered a person gives Elon Musk a $1000 interest free loan to secure a car they might get a year or 2 later.

923239578978455553 2017-10-25 17:27:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tesla @chevrolet @ChevyElectric @redmarzman Sure...but it'll cost you an extra $10K. Kind of blows your whole "Model 3 is cheaper" argument out the window doesn't it?
923239426792226816 2017-10-25 17:26:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Tesla @chevrolet @ChevyElectric @redmarzman Lol. So the Model 3 has less range, costs roughly the same, is only faster by a whopping .9 seconds, and it isn't even available yet?

921438943404593152 2017-10-20 18:12:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @votevets @JenniferIsMaria The Stolen Valor Act makes this illegal if done for ANY TANGIBLE BENEFIT. I would say he, & fox news, need prosecuted.
921438337675784192 2017-10-20 18:09:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ALT_uscis @cryptan The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 was signed into law by President Obama. It amends the Criminal Code to make Stolen Valor illegal.
921437591232237568 2017-10-20 18:06:55 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FoxNews @PaladinCornelia Fox was informed immediately by his family & Navy Officials. They left the story up because it was getting shared, watched, & making $$$

921433885514268672 2017-10-20 17:52:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Trump loving "Navy SEAL" celebrated by Fox News should be prosecuted under #StolenValor Act signed into law by Obamahttp://wapo.st/2yvR5iZ?tid=ss_tw-bottom&utm_term=.2be942cfcd8b

919034837473873921 2017-10-13 02:59:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump I'll take C...Neither.   Worshipping a creator is not a prerequisite to being an American. Or a Patriot.  #Trump is a #FakeChristian anyway.

919031564654260224 2017-10-13 02:46:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Wow...this is pathetic. My 4 year old son is more of a man than you Donny.

918653355936935936 2017-10-12 01:43:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RepLukeMesser why would you vote against disaster relief for Puerto Rico?
918653154710970368 2017-10-12 01:42:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RepWalorski did you seriously just vote against helping the people of Puerto Rico?
918651109006303232 2017-10-12 01:34:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul I think it could be argued that everyone is listening to the message.

918635524633571328 2017-10-12 00:32:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins All I want is a sequel to The Rundown starring Dwyane Johnson. That movie deserves another installment. #TheRundown2
918633592145707008 2017-10-12 00:24:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TheRundownBET @robinthede Is it a TV series based on The Rundown starring Dwyane @TheRock Johnson? If so, I'm definitely in. If not, lie to me. I need this.
918632737132695552 2017-10-12 00:21:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul And a completely different outlook, personality, etc. Not sure which you think is more mature?
918631492821159936 2017-10-12 00:16:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Would they have gotten as much attention? Reached as large an audience? Of course not. Does it make you more uncomfortable than the con flag

918474811755687936 2017-10-12 13:53:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jk_rowling Funny thing is, if you read all of that and really start thinking about the "Men" you know & read about, it's easy to separate the boys.
918474540761657344 2017-10-12 13:52:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jk_rowling If an adult male commits sexual assault, or needs witnesses to keep himself from doing so, he isn't a "Man." I've written about this before.pic.twitter.com/u5Mv8xjWPY
918472939657400320 2017-10-12 13:46:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool "Man" is a title. It's earned, not given. I've known some 16 year old men, & I've known 80 year old boys. The world needs more Men.
918472585083588608 2017-10-12 13:45:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool A man doesn't pass the buck, but takes responsibility. A man leads. A man admits when he is wrong, works hard, and is humble.
918471783996588032 2017-10-12 13:41:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool A man does not ask for recognition or rewards for being a man. A man puts himself second. A man does the right thing & makes the hard choice
918471232592506881 2017-10-12 13:39:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool A man is loyal. A man is respectful. A man is responsible, righteous, compassionate, & honest. A man knows right from wrong.
918470590905901057 2017-10-12 13:37:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool Being a MAN is the pinnacle of being a Male. It isn't based on age, how you dress, power, money, or sexual conquests. It's about character.
918470344180150272 2017-10-12 13:36:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @VP @SebGorka @Marcelles_cool It is a normal instinct for MEN. The problem is, these predators, and those that excuse them, aren't MEN. They're adult males, but not Men.

918466143748329472 2017-10-12 13:19:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul I taught my kids that the Confederate Flag is the flag of stupid people who aren't worth talking to or having in their lives. #TrueStory
918465486559633409 2017-10-12 13:16:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Kneeling is peaceful protest used by people using their position as a platform to draw attention to an important issue.
918464652731912192 2017-10-12 13:13:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul The Confederate Flag, which rose to prominence due to the Dixiecrats & KKK, symbolizes treason, racism & hate  Kneeling is not disrespectful

918328578382745600 2017-10-11 04:12:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins @aarondicer Damn you and your cheap attempt to make me like you with Dumb & Dumber quotes. Damn me for letting it work.
918310784488361990 2017-10-11 03:02:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @aarondicer @cinemasins Right? Again, more power to you Dice, but what you say makes no sense.
918310346254962688 2017-10-11 03:00:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AmericanAtheist As atheists we can sometimes come off as condescending & pompous. I struggle with it, & it seems a lot of others do too. No offense man
918309232306466816 2017-10-11 02:55:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins @aarondicer Fair enough man. Though the question still stands whether or not you ever see movies based on books you've read?
918308892865630208 2017-10-11 02:54:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AmericanAtheist I'm not disagreeing with you. Just saying I can see why this guy might think students don't have full 1a rights. It can be fuzzy in schools.
918296900855566336 2017-10-11 02:06:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TheAuthorGuy Unfortunately Trumps parents failed him & never taught him to be a man. So we have an adult boy as president.

918291627097149440 2017-10-11 01:45:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins For serious though, do you #zeroframes folk refuse to watch movies based on books? Do you not read comics? Have you never seen a movie?
918290584703569921 2017-10-11 01:41:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins I think I can manage.
918290306247913472 2017-10-11 01:40:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump So you're gonna let @TheDemocrats write it?
918288661074063360 2017-10-11 01:34:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AmericanAtheist However, it has been shown time and again that 1A rights of students are reduced on school grounds. Dress codes, for example.
918287517278982144 2017-10-11 01:29:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AmericanAtheist He started correct. 1A only protects from govt, not people. But public schools are govt institutions.

918282968703078402 2017-10-11 01:11:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @SpeakerRyan I just can't believe that after Trump was elected you still think that there is a God. That's some blind devotion right there.

918271002689310720 2017-10-11 00:24:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WFSBnews @AP @sdt927 And? Scouting isn't gender specific. Any real scout knows that.

918158521178476545 2017-10-11 16:57:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I raise my son to be a man. Loyal, respectful, responsible, & honest. Not an adult boy like #Trump. #DayoftheGirl #RealMan #Weinstein
918154763757289477 2017-10-11 16:42:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @NeilGrandeur Trump is only as smart as the dumbest person in his inner circle. I doubt even he would tell Trump returning the diss is a good idea.
918152804727959552 2017-10-11 16:34:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hitRECordJoe One time she caught me softly crying in class because I couldn't sit still. So she gave me puzzles, not pills. Kept my mind occupied.

918150735161851904 2017-10-11 16:26:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I legit do not believe even #Trump is dumb enough to try and clap back on #Eminem. But I also really, really, really, hope he does.pic.twitter.com/iTg3s7d114

917935507388141568 2017-10-10 02:10:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hitRECordJoe I actually tried looking her up a while back. She is retired, couldn't get a number for her. But she changed my life and she never knew it.
917935025932390402 2017-10-10 02:08:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @hitRECordJoe Mrs. Madden. 3rd grade. Where others saw a hyperactive kid who needed meds, she saw I needed to be challenged. Made me love school again.
917934238409904129 2017-10-10 02:05:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @93wibc @hammerandnigel So, by your logic, since you voted for Trump you aren't allowed to call out Weinstein. Right? Cause if Trump is ok...who isn't?

908793914165010433 2017-09-15 20:45:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Is Trump a #WhiteSupremacist? Maybe. But does he encourage them & welcome their adoration? Definitely. #DoTheMath #nazibucketchallenge

904752855978049538 2017-09-04 17:07:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Half? Please. You think half the people of this country is agains same sex marriage? But yeah, the majority of government is bullshit.
904752583386025984 2017-09-04 17:06:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound A decade is a long time.
904752531057905666 2017-09-04 17:06:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound No double standard. The media and what they cover is directly correlated to ratings and the mindset of the audience. Times have changed.
904752249963929600 2017-09-04 17:05:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Lol. Biased against bullshit.
904752140542980098 2017-09-04 17:04:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Even the Pope doesn't care. Christianity needs to read it's own book and grow up
904752052319997952 2017-09-04 17:04:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound It's only the backwards and ultra religious that still care. And the reason is exposure. It's hard to demonize people you know.
904751880114450432 2017-09-04 17:03:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Don't be silly. Also. In 2008 no one was really talking about gay marriage to the extent they do now. It's basically accepted.
904751680130093060 2017-09-04 17:03:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Lol. You think the Nashville statement was meant to fly under the radar? No. They wanted media attention and controversy. Riles the base.
904746996325548035 2017-09-04 16:44:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Literally everywhere. But do you also remember  "I believe same-sex couples should be able to get married" Also Obama. Views change. marries

876155503025565697 2017-06-17 19:12:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Quiznos "I got quiznos" sounds like you're disclosing an STD to your partner.
875932688879939584 2017-06-16 04:26:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack False. The correct answer is "Black Member of the A-Team."
875926906671181825 2017-06-16 04:03:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cinemasins Dude, you're like the Charlie Brown of drone pilots.
875924586969395201 2017-06-16 03:54:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut Neither! It's your lucky day.
875923916493119488 2017-06-16 03:51:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @zyrusha @pizzahut Notice how she didn't say "I want a delicious pizza?" She is prioritizing cardboard over your za bro.
875923285149704192 2017-06-16 03:49:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut @sheringsheet ...do you have a blank CD (or a @coldplay one) lying around? Or literally anything sharper than a butter knife?
875922220467585025 2017-06-16 03:45:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut @SkyMiserable Wait...you prefer superman to spiderman? Who hurt you? Where did it all go wrong in your life to make you this way?
875921716517720068 2017-06-16 03:43:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut @Rob_Motto His parents are dead though. So he's like, what, halfway there right?
875921379304120321 2017-06-16 03:41:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut @ArtOfJason All pizza? Or just shitty pizza?
875920314915573760 2017-06-16 03:37:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @pizzahut Well...it's not the hero I want, but I guess it's the one I deserve. Because I'm a shitty person.
875919480030994432 2017-06-16 03:34:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> My dream beer fridge is stocked with @TinManBrewing, @taxmanbrewing, @rhinegeist, @UplandBrewCo sours, @ZwanzigZ, & like 6 others I cant fit
875916500401520640 2017-06-16 03:22:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton Yeah, mixing those with white grapes isn't my idea of a good combo.
875915148615200768 2017-06-16 03:16:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CharliePapazian It was yeast. Feel like I should guessed by the picture?
875914944306450432 2017-06-16 03:16:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CharliePapazian Is it water? Literally the most underrated of beer ingredients?
875914262685921280 2017-06-16 03:13:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton Obviously 3F doesn't fall into that category. They're most likely just experimenting and seeing what happens.
875914110977835009 2017-06-16 03:12:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton Honestly, they're probably just really easy to get ahold of so brewers wanting to get into barrel aging go for them.
875913892836364288 2017-06-16 03:12:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton Definitely not for a motor oil thick, robust brew like DL. Maybe an apricot sour or a hefew aged on fresh pears.
875912642103320576 2017-06-16 03:07:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton Interesting. I think experimentation is what makes craft great, but a lot of brewers have jumped on the barrel aged trend w/mixed results.
875911932905181184 2017-06-16 03:04:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @jordanoverton I believe that. Love Dark Lord, but barrel aging isn't always a good idea. So many variables. Honestly wish it would die (except for sours).
875911137895870464 2017-06-16 03:01:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Does anyone else think @realDonaldTrump is just pure solipsism in human(ish) form? It can't just be me. @Matt_Dillahunty?
875909026751676416 2017-06-16 02:52:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @tedlieu I mean, typically I would think that was damn in evidence, but it's 2017 & we live in the upside down.

859818943070031872 2017-05-03 17:16:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @iGrantH @alma_mater212 First what do you think amendments are for? States get equal representation in the senate. POTUS represents all people. People should decide
859815019487342592 2017-05-03 17:00:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @alma_mater212 @iGrantH The EC is outdated and silly, with a pretty shady history. Every other election is decided by popular vote, so too should the presidential.
859814707703820289 2017-05-03 16:59:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @iGrantH No, if you got rid of the EC every persons vote would count equally. Not sure why this is hard to understand. The state doesn't vote.
859814348927184896 2017-05-03 16:58:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @iGrantH @alma_mater212 Yes. For a lot of reasons, but mainly because each vote is not equal. Due to the way EC votes are allocated.
859813527237922818 2017-05-03 16:54:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @iGrantH @alma_mater212 Um, that's false though. The way votes are allocated means a voter in Wyoming has a more powerful vote than a voter in, say, California.
859810965373825025 2017-05-03 16:44:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BasedMonitored @iGrantH How is it equal/proportional? Also, literally every other election you vote on is decided by popular vote. What makes president different?

857723599515504646 2017-04-27 22:30:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Imi_Geoghegan @drjfp33 Does trolling helps you deal with the emptiness you feel inside? When we stop exploring, we stop learning. Stop advancing. Stop inventing.
857722632661331968 2017-04-27 22:26:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CassiniSaturn @NASA Being exposed to awe inspiring moments & the achievements of others can make you feel small. I get it. But trolling it won't fill that void.

855446370492272640 2017-04-21 15:41:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> For real though @TheRock. With your star power you could get #TheRundown2 going tomorrow. Do it for the fans (& for Sean William Scott).

842956285184237568 2017-03-17 04:30:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @manahansf They can come in handy for certain things, but typically if I walk into a bar & the bartender is using a jigger I just order beer

842929239905243138 2017-03-17 02:42:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 would have some origin stuff & focus on Brock being taken over by toxin, the fight with Agent Venom, & the birth of anti-venom3/3
842928826418192385 2017-03-17 02:41:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 AV would have some origin backstory but the story of Flash would be set up through news segments in Venom. The third movie(2/3)
842928363526389761 2017-03-17 02:39:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 Fair. But Eddie Brock is well known. No need for a 45 minute origin. Maybe some flashback exposition, end credits teases AV(1/3)
842926543072518145 2017-03-17 02:32:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 Venom is as much about the symbiote as it is the host. Venom: lethal protector, Agent Venom, Venom 2 (Toxin & anti-venom)
842924058907938816 2017-03-17 02:22:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @EthanSkys Right? I would agree but I also think he is a bit old and slightly overused by Hollywood. @TaronEgerton would be awesome.
842923614655647745 2017-03-17 02:20:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 main villain in the movie. Post credits would introduce flash thompson and setup an Agent Venom sequel.
842923400997888000 2017-03-17 02:19:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spidey889 Venom: Lethal Protector mixed with the trial of Eddie Brock.

833784658647195648 2017-02-20 21:05:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Its been a few weeks since I emailed @ArborHomesIndy about the shoddy workmanship of my home. Still no reply. #Shocked.

830079009618812929 2017-02-10 15:40:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @NotTheRealEarl Yeah it is. But I find myself brewing less European styles lately. I need to get back on that though. I want to do a Burton.
830078675752255488 2017-02-10 15:39:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> By the way, this is the recipe I'll be brewing tonight. Appreciate any feedback from all you brewers out there. https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/rural-beach
830077187625742336 2017-02-10 15:33:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Whats your favorite hop? It's a tough call, I lean toward Columbus, but lately I've taken a shine to Simcoe and Galaxy. #BrewLife
830051807493775360 2017-02-10 13:52:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UCBCmikka wow. I just realized my phone autocorrected motueka to motels. Whoops
829808304725581825 2017-02-09 21:44:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Picked up ingredients for a brew using 2.5oz each of El Dorado, Mosaic, Citra, & Galaxy plus .25 of Warrior. Excited to brew again #Brewlife

829520145332699136 2017-02-08 02:39:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UCBCmikka really, it applies to all new zealand/Australian hops. I'd like to see more Nelson, admiral, motels (love this one), etc.
829081838354386949 2017-02-07 21:38:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UCBCmikka good mix. Nelson is underused by most brewers. IMO.
829081498577956864 2017-02-07 21:36:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UCBCmikka @taxmanbrewing @NotTheRealEarl @urbanchestnut @hosch_greg sure are.

829022590815633409 2017-02-07 17:42:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @guardian @bimmerbound so you admit he called for a Muslim ban? That's progress at least.

827719350962499585 2017-02-03 03:24:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So of I get all the painting done tomorrow I can brew on Sunday. So many choices. But I think I'll go IPA. Super juicy. #BackInTheSaddle

826882322721075201 2017-02-01 19:58:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ArborHomesIndy Yeah, thats not the way it works. https://support.twitter.com/articles/14606 I emailed you.
826880472496107520 2017-02-01 19:50:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @urbanchestnut @taxmanbrewing @NotTheRealEarl I will. Looked it up. Looks interesting.
826472974584803330 2017-01-31 16:51:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @NotTheRealEarl Hmm, actually the @taxmanbrewing 4 packs for 7.99 at Kroger is also a great deal. What is this Fantasyland you speak of?

826318457549516800 2017-01-30 06:37:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Why would @netflix spend so much time trying to create a shitty version of @ArcherFX when they could just not do that? #PacificHeat

826150180047224832 2017-01-30 19:28:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Trump wants to ban all muslims, but he can't because of potential backlash and the constitution. So he found a loophole.
826149569230733313 2017-01-30 19:26:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> they may only represent 9% of Muslims worldwide, but Muslims represent the vast majority of their population.
826149333854732289 2017-01-30 19:25:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> *you're* and yes it is. Trump called for a Muslim ban several times. He repackaged it so fools like you can feel better.

825834180470779904 2017-01-29 22:33:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So yeah, this weekend I rebuilt the stairs of my @ArborHomesIndy home. Their stairs were poorly built & they left garbage under the steps.pic.twitter.com/vyPFxg8WbC
825833586385383425 2017-01-29 22:30:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Oh, and the best part of winter in my @ArborHomesIndy home? Cold air blows in from every outlet and under the walls. #NeverBuyFromArbor
825833259733020672 2017-01-29 22:29:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I'm afraid every time I till the yard of my @ArborHomesIndy home. I've found large pieces of cement, nails, wood, garbage, etc.
825832697289375744 2017-01-29 22:27:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If I have never mentioned this, never buy an @ArborHomesIndy home. Quality is subpar, plus the builders leave garbage in your home.pic.twitter.com/ivj88sNIPw
824684694713356288 2017-01-26 18:25:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HoweFarms Thanks. it would be a fun experiment. If any good getting testing and cultivation of an indigenous Indiana hop would be awesome.
824681164032118785 2017-01-26 18:11:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HoweFarms If you hear of any spots let me know. I'll hike out to grab some this summer.
824278584193937408 2017-01-25 15:31:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ArcherFX @NotTheRealEarl This is going to be the label.
824278482393976832 2017-01-25 15:31:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS Totally OK with that. I'll get a recipe made later today. Sounds like a good first brew for the new @CraftaBrew Catalyst.
824276853519220736 2017-01-25 15:24:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS Not sure yet. I need to come up with a recipe. Probably a few ounces though.
824275778535849986 2017-01-25 15:20:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So, after about 5 minutes of thought, I am going to brew an @ArcherFX tribute beer. Double IPA using Sterling & Archer hops #PhrasingDIPA
824274549059489795 2017-01-25 15:15:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Been reading about Archer hops from UK & I want to try them. Anyone have experience or know where to buy @gr8fermentation @FinalGravityHS
824273283763892225 2017-01-25 15:10:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Lets be clear, republicans are great at branding. School Choice, Right to Work, etc. Dig below the surface though & you see its bad news.https://twitter.com/chadbensonshow/status/823938239316697089
824272724319203328 2017-01-25 15:08:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Guy I work with has hops on his property planted decades ago. No one knows by who or what variety. Anyone else know of wild hops in IN?
824272046154776577 2017-01-25 15:05:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation @72muller Thanks.
824271604666527745 2017-01-25 15:03:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation @812farms Sounds like a plan. I'll probably do Columbus as well (because I love them).
824271202638237701 2017-01-25 15:02:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @812farms @NotTheRealEarl @gr8fermentation This. I want these.
824271068403761152 2017-01-25 15:01:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation Awesome, thanks for the info. Not familiar with Sterling though. Whats it like?

823569255799160836 2017-01-23 16:33:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation @812farms @NotTheRealEarl Again, its a guess. But a raised bed would kind of remove the clay soil issue.
823568423158509569 2017-01-23 16:29:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation @812farms @NotTheRealEarl I think you would do a raised bed with a soil mixture high in peat and manure (guessing)
823568217457250304 2017-01-23 16:28:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation @812farms Well, hard to argue with that. Which varieties are easiest for first time growers?
823559359208837122 2017-01-23 15:53:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Wait...is "people don't care about my tax returns" just another #AlternativeFact? Is it #OppositeDay in the @WhiteHouse @KellyannePolls?
823558415117008896 2017-01-23 15:50:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I think this is the year I grow my own hops. When is the cutoff for presale @gr8fermentation? Also, anyone have 140 characters of advice?

819751994474856448 2017-01-12 03:44:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Looked for @PFTompkins tour dates & found his bio. Sounds a little unbelievable. "Coal fan?" Not. Buying. It. #EverythingElseSeemsReasonablepic.twitter.com/9A8w55Wco6
819749861373394945 2017-01-12 03:36:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TheRock still think you as Savage Dragon or Christian Walker (Powers) would be dope. But nothing compares to return as Beck in #TheRundown2
819748575555059712 2017-01-12 03:31:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @ThePlasticPope Just because he won doesn't mean he did so honorably or there was no treason committed. #InvestigateTrump
819748084611743744 2017-01-12 03:29:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HDTGM Thanks, I will. I desperately wanted to be there for a few of the recent shows, but I live in Indiana. So its like I'm punished twice
819747886497939456 2017-01-12 03:28:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @adviseagainstit Not sure what you mean. I know he won. Never denied it. He still needs to release his returns & most Americans want him to.
819747410842894337 2017-01-12 03:26:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ThePlasticPope Yup. Watched the whole thing. Pretty sure you just confirmed what I said. Maybe watch it again if you're confused by nuance.
819747002439372800 2017-01-12 03:24:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Is @IndianaCityBeer planning on doing another Homebrew Battle anytime soon? I need to redeem myself and bring home the win.
819249561734615042 2017-01-11 18:28:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Seems pretty clear #Russia hacked us @realDonaldTrump knew & he or/and his team corroborated w/them. Can we #ImpeachTrump before election?

819239676200583168 2017-01-11 17:48:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So trump is letting his weasel kids Eric & DJTJ. run his company? & he is basically saying he doesn't have to act ethically. This is #MAGA?

819238815911079939 2017-01-11 17:45:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ThePlasticPope to be fair, I am mocking Trump by saying he would compare the two. Soooo, not really the same.

818808264414658560 2017-01-10 13:14:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So @93wibc will take responsibility if you shoot your gun in a greenwood subdivision because of a coyote & your stray bullet hits someone?
818599944668008449 2017-01-09 23:26:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul I can find a billion. Change corporate tax back to what it was 6 years ago and reinstate inheritance tax. Raise taxes on guns.

816151353512837120 2017-01-02 05:17:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Overlooked in #2016: @AndySamberg starred in 2 underrated movies. #Popstar #storksmovie. Don't give up buddy. #CoolBeans
816150820265791488 2017-01-02 05:14:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I keep being hopeful for #2017, then I remember @realDonaldTrump  takes office this year, and I kind of want to go back to #2016
815031643194933248 2016-12-30 03:07:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PFTompkins nevermind. I listened to the rest of the Xmas episode. Still though, top 5 laughs of 2016 for sure.
814998435824881664 2016-12-30 00:55:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PFTompkins not to gush, but "you're a time guy of some sort" is probably the biggest laugh I had in 2016.

814229292888555520 2016-12-28 21:59:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul shouldn't we apologize for slavery? Apologizing is just admitting you were wrong, and recognizing the mistake.

810668652626321409 2016-12-18 02:10:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MMuncy that would be awesome. Then we could film guest reactions and see if it was a success or not.
810667317143240704 2016-12-18 02:05:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @MMuncy could rope in pro brewers also. Mix it up. Everyone has at least one beer that just didn't work out and they never revisited.

806909303256924160 2016-12-08 17:12:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls let's go with the grey ones. How can I order for the original price I paid?
806894547456364544 2016-12-08 16:13:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls Honestly the blue, drizzle gray, or red would be ok in 10.5. Not my first choice, but they would work. Thank you for reaching out.

806722737691496448 2016-12-07 04:51:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Kohls instead of just cancelling, why not reaching out to see if there are alternatives?

794233867066605568 2016-11-03 17:44:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin You're frustrating. In Poland my surname is spelled differently because of Ellis Island. Should I change it back? Or is it now correct?
794233069075132416 2016-11-03 17:41:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 7) and twitter is public. Anything you say can be seen and replied to. Get used to it. Much like language, you can't control it.
794232892046143488 2016-11-03 17:40:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 7)should we really ignore the current iterations and only validate words spelled as they were 1500 years ago? Is that your psotion?
794232692267171840 2016-11-03 17:40:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 6) if you think the word is spelled incorrectly, when was it spelled right, and is that the earliest spelling? All language has an origin
794232535656103936 2016-11-03 17:39:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 5)is wrong is an odd position to take. Our language has progressed  and changed over time to reflect back on our society. My point is
794232279409291264 2016-11-03 17:38:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 4) and as such we have different spellings and pronunciations. To say only early English spellings are correct  and everything  else
794231966686183424 2016-11-03 17:37:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 3) Words can change spelling and meaning based on nationality  and language spoken. And while American isn't a language, it is a dialect.
794231691401428992 2016-11-03 17:36:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 2) I love language, however it exists in pockets. If I visit a Spanish speaking home, they may tell me in Spanish Andrew is Andres.
794230696197951488 2016-11-03 17:32:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin 1) I would argue names are different so your analogy is flawed. However, both words can exist simultaneously with both being correct
794229521457315840 2016-11-03 17:27:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin Please do.
794229434979090432 2016-11-03 17:27:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HillaryClinton No. We accept truth & see the whole picture. As for me, I read everything. Then draw my conclusions based on intellectual honesty & fact

794227890799996928 2016-11-03 17:20:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin Not sure what you mean by unsolicited. If you shout to the world and I'm near, I'll assume I'm invited to the conversation.
794227436665925632 2016-11-03 17:19:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HillaryClinton You do see the hypocrisy in that statement right? Do I need to point it out?
794227238753501184 2016-11-03 17:18:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HillaryClinton Doubt it. Better role model than Trump.
794227132457222144 2016-11-03 17:17:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin That is where we differ. Language is a living thing. And if we start saying only original English is correct, how far back do you go?
794226504108482561 2016-11-03 17:15:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin What are you arguing? I'm sincerely curious. My original point was language evolves and changes over time. You seem to be hung up on latin.

794218710978334720 2016-11-03 16:44:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LMcDew @DrMcLin Google diachronic  linguistics. Then think about etymological evolution of words. Also, mot English is derived from Latin. How is that moot?

783701541920264192 2016-10-05 16:13:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow Not disagreeing that Pence had a good night. If you read a transcript I think Kaine did great, but visually, pence got him.
783701351351984128 2016-10-05 16:12:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow the first part. Trump Criticizing Kaine for "constant interruptions" is like Andrew Jackson criticizing someone for swearing
783687331882467328 2016-10-05 15:16:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Like I said before @chadbensonshow he's a hypocrite.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/783660227530862592

783460039117922304 2016-10-04 00:13:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow so he is being a hypocrite. Does that help? Sorry for the amount of tweets.
783459914027036673 2016-10-04 00:12:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow also, while he has paid no taxes for 20 years, he has criticized others for not paying their fair share
783459775610757120 2016-10-04 00:12:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow also, that he didnt do his own taxes, he had them done, so he doesnt know anything about loopholes.
783459620073402368 2016-10-04 00:11:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow it would be like me saying in equipped to be a chef because im a great food critic.
783459483792109569 2016-10-04 00:11:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow my argument is that @realDonaldTrump being best equipped to fix the problem because he knows how to use it is absurd
783459224475009024 2016-10-04 00:10:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow so, why would you want him to get elected?
783459135413227520 2016-10-04 00:09:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow but he said he wants to fix the system and close the very loopholes you say let investments flourish.
783458919729553408 2016-10-04 00:08:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow and also he didn't use the system. And closing the loopholes would hinder investments.
783458663558160384 2016-10-04 00:07:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow let me try to right the ship. You argue @realDonaldTrump is best equipped to "fix" the system because he knows how to use it
783458209487020032 2016-10-04 00:06:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow and again, I think we are arguing two separate things.
783458120286756864 2016-10-04 00:05:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow he used the tax code and loopholes to his advantage. He admits that.
783441265157255168 2016-10-04 22:58:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow so according to you fixing it kills investments, but he is best suited to fix it so we should vote for him?
783440829125758976 2016-10-04 22:57:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow but If @realDonaldTrump "fixes" the problem he will close that loophole & investments die. Why are you rooting for him again
783440104354263040 2016-10-04 22:54:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow my issue is the hypocrisy, and the belief that his ability to use the system equips him to fix it.
783439791429824513 2016-10-04 22:52:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow you are arguing a point I didnt make.
783386730590154756 2016-10-04 19:22:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow & my point is that while he wasn't paying those taxes he criticized other for doing the same. A hypocrite
783386242855469056 2016-10-04 19:20:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow So you point is moot. (sorry for so many texts, Twitter isn't ideal for polite discourse)
783386023308820480 2016-10-04 19:19:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow And, by his own admission, he wants to simplify taxes, not teach us how to take advantage of it.
783384706251231236 2016-10-04 19:14:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow And again, by your logic, I would be a great racecar driver because i have a lot of speeding tickets.
783384387068964864 2016-10-04 19:12:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow It's been out there that he lost money, not that he didn't pay taxes for almost 20 years because of it.
783384214045470720 2016-10-04 19:12:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow If you really want someone who can fix the system, hire Trumps tax attorney.
783384115433250816 2016-10-04 19:11:42 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow That guy went to jail first. Also, Trump signed his tax returns, he didn't do the math.
783382525406097408 2016-10-04 19:05:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow So that excuses @realDonaldTrump? Warren Buffet isnt running for POTUS. Trump is. Are you saying he isnt being hypocritical?
783359930384343040 2016-10-04 17:35:36 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chadbensonshow I'm saying its hypocritical for @realDonaldTrump to criticize others for not paying taxes. Your book line is bait and switch
783358398901256192 2016-10-04 17:29:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow Is his book germane? & why is he the best option? My speeding tickets dont qualify me to be a nascar driver
783328629748936704 2016-10-04 15:31:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Can't wait until this election is over and I can go back to being snarky and asking @TheRock about his plans for #TheRundown2
783327562940329984 2016-10-04 15:26:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @RealScottErnst You're pathetic
783325316995436544 2016-10-04 15:18:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Curious if someone could look up for me how many times @mike_pence got blocked or overturned by federal courts? At least 3. #VPDebate
783319628365778949 2016-10-04 14:55:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow Also, when he criticized Obama for not paying enough in taxes.pic.twitter.com/qjvQokXkGl
783318948997533697 2016-10-04 14:52:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow Just a few examples I could find quickly. He criticizes others for the thing he is guilty of.pic.twitter.com/IamdpgPVZo

783284742867136512 2016-10-04 12:36:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> My greatest wish is that during the #VPDebate @timkaine asks @mike_pence if he still believes cigarettes are healthy http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/two-times-mike-pence-brushed-off-science
783284449945395208 2016-10-04 12:35:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Before the fun tonight, let us not forget that @GovPenceIN does not think smoking causes cancer. #VPDebate http://web.archive.org/web/20010415085348/http://mikepence.com/smoke.html
783258322199801856 2016-10-04 10:51:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow what right does he have to complain about others doing something that he himself is guilty of?
783258017194213376 2016-10-04 10:50:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow its like if I tweeted & complained about people speeding then I was caught with 12 tickets.
783257261007335424 2016-10-04 10:47:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @chadbensonshow for yrs he criticized others for not paying their fair share of taxes, or paying no taxes. Bit hypocritical

783014331936047105 2016-10-03 18:42:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @realDonaldTrump @bimmerbound Conspiracy theory much? He has a long line of small biz owners he screwed over. Which there is evidence for.

758438076356104193 2016-07-27 23:05:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing was gonna do lacto kettle sour and pitch 650 after boil.
758437892817649665 2016-07-27 23:04:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing ok, sorry, I mispoke. Was gonna use 650. It is more the sweet fruit flavors & acid than residual sugars I was gonna balance

758436020367028224 2016-07-27 22:56:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AllGrainBeer @BAGchef what was OG and temp? Also aeration could be an issue. But 05 is super dependable. Relax and have a homebrew.
758435558486073344 2016-07-27 22:55:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing fair point. But do you think a brett berliner would be good? I like the addition of salt to balance the sweetness.
758415521813499904 2016-07-27 21:35:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing probably go sans coriander. Not a fan and I dont think itll pair well.

755379556790390784 2016-07-19 12:31:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> This is probably a long shot, but I wonder if @tomhanks has ever heard the song "Tom Hanks" by Buckwheat Groats?

754364686578122752 2016-07-16 17:18:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> So we're clear @GovPenceIN isnt liked by enough hoosiers to get the state to vote for Cruz but his endorsement of Trump will help him win?

743914388315201536 2016-06-17 21:13:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @sigsauerinc @Rachismo1 Semi-automatic rifles and similar. Also silencers and high capacity magazines. Seems pretty easy.
743898683553386496 2016-06-17 20:10:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 @sigsauerinc Advertised to "build a complete weapon system for any scenario or environment." Guess that includes nightclubs.
743898394943356928 2016-06-17 20:09:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 So, like I said, No auto, but everything else is available.
743897513485185024 2016-06-17 20:06:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 And none of those options are available for civilian purchase? Because you might want to recheck that.
743896008296280064 2016-06-17 20:00:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @sigsauerinc @Rachismo1 So, what you're saying is you have no answer. Do you think it's fine to market cigarettes to children?
743895299207237636 2016-06-17 19:57:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 Read this http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/foghorn/gun-review-sig-sauer-mcx/  tell me why this weapon should be marketed to, or available to, civilians?
743895085683605505 2016-06-17 19:56:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 In what way, besides the possibility of full auto? What options are not available to the general public?
743892875855826944 2016-06-17 19:47:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 Or, more scarily, @sigsauerinc is marketing directly to those who feel as if they have a "mission."
743892687128977408 2016-06-17 19:46:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 Yes. You picture yourself using the product in the way it is marketed. They're selling directly to those who want to shoot PEOPLE
743891688049938432 2016-06-17 19:42:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 Also, if these are weapons made for military purposes why are they being marketed to civilians? Kind of proving my point for me.
743891131851649025 2016-06-17 19:40:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 When marketing to different audiences you typically have different messages. Who is the target customer for this message?
743890797758537728 2016-06-17 19:39:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 But you buy it because that imagery speaks to you. The idea of being "Mission Ready" speaks to a certain person as well.
743866433331834880 2016-06-17 18:02:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Rachismo1 More like marketing a supercharged mustang with the tagline "the perfect getaway car" and then touting it's racecar like features

739098012060950528 2016-06-04 14:14:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @nkjemisin @BoingBoing Is it just me, or does this world need The Punisher? Rapists and child molestors should hang. The end.
739096586635096064 2016-06-04 14:08:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Anytime someone says they have "discriminating tastes" I like to say "you have a racist tongue?" Then I back away shaking my head.

737466631941705728 2016-05-30 02:12:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @f_francavilla best casting ever was when they cast @TheRock as Beck in The Rundown. When are they making a sequel to that? #TheRundown2

737461306173849601 2016-05-30 01:50:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound Nope, pretty sure it's true.
737461213634932736 2016-05-30 01:50:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound So you are saying @GovPenceIN  and his laws RFRA/gay marriage werent endorsing his religious views? Dont be dense.
737460173732712449 2016-05-30 01:46:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound And im sure they will, as they did with marriage equality.

737330642829074433 2016-05-30 17:11:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound if you want to understand the constitution I recommend the writings of Jefferson instead of interpretating yourself
737329830044262400 2016-05-30 17:08:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound It's a tricky line, but not hard to understand.
737329055180181504 2016-05-30 17:05:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound where is it the contrary. Intent & function of 1A, as expressed by our forefathers, is separation of church & state
737328112179027968 2016-05-30 17:01:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound allowing discrimination on religious basis is exaclty that, establishing religion/religious rule.
737327946847903744 2016-05-30 17:00:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound right, but what is the first part? Make no law respecting an establishment of religion.
737327243752574978 2016-05-30 16:58:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound sure, so you should also be proud to have a sign on your door saying so. Flourish or perish based on your bias
737326975178641408 2016-05-30 16:57:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound religious freedom is also freedom FROM religion.
737308651959005184 2016-05-30 15:44:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If I had lost a loved one in war, and someone told me HAPPY Memorial Day I'd tell them to fuck right off. #Respect #AllGaveSomeSomeGaveAll
737307418124771329 2016-05-30 15:39:21 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound It isnt telling to you that it was 62% in 2014, plummeted after RFRA & hasnt recovered? lets get IN out of the 50's
737305858858684416 2016-05-30 15:33:09 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound I'm talking election numbers. 2015 & 2016 have him below 50% Downward trend heading into an election year, no good.
737305059218886656 2016-05-30 15:29:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound our legislators should not be making laws based on personal religion or ideology. #TheEnd
737304917841481728 2016-05-30 15:29:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound look man, you have a right to your faith. But we have a constitution that separates it from our government.
737304431209943040 2016-05-30 15:27:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound if those are the beliefs you stand for, be proud about it. Be open, and tell everyone. Some wont care, others will
737304078775144448 2016-05-30 15:26:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound sigh, didnt say judge was the market, we are. Any business that wants to deny service should have a sign saying so
737303547134521345 2016-05-30 15:23:58 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound @FoxNews Sorry, this is Oregon. Find me a Hoosier case and you'll have met my request sufficiently.
737302850095722497 2016-05-30 15:21:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> When you say HAPPY Memorial Day, you are missing the point. Today we observe & honor those who gave all, it's not a party #Respect #ThankYou
736885161359486976 2016-05-29 11:41:27 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound Mitch had 53% in 04 and his #'s got better at 57% in 08. @GovPenceIN cant crack 50%. Our governor should work for all hoosiers.
736883911486275584 2016-05-29 11:36:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound further, letting an open market decide what businesses stay open is capitalism at its finest.
736883486229925888 2016-05-29 11:34:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound Do you mean "persecuting?" Because no one has been prosecuted.pic.twitter.com/1Hit7uyK3W

736556178478641152 2016-05-28 13:54:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound So you believe half the state is conservative and loves @GovPenceIN? Even if true that means half wants him gone. Not great #'s
736555059094421505 2016-05-28 13:49:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @bimmerbound Who was prosecuted? & Denying people equal rights hurts your faith? Marriage is a legal matter not a religious one
736320747442995201 2016-05-27 22:18:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bimmerbound I wouldn't say half @GovPenceIN won by only 3% in 2012 & he hasn't done much besides divide the state since then #FireMikePence

733372866683674625 2016-05-19 19:04:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS Did you have any extra hop rhizomes for sale? I know I missed pre-sale, but I really want to try growing my own this year.
733371831990636544 2016-05-19 19:00:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I feel like somewhere in the casting notes for every cartoon mom is written "Voice must be as shrill and annoying as possible."

732974672640282624 2016-05-18 16:42:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Just checked out the preview for Mae from @DarkHorseComics and I'm blown away by the art & the original story. Can't wait to read it in full

732926762808565761 2016-05-18 13:32:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Remember a few years (16) ago when High School ended? Tell your friends, cause its still over and apparently not everyone got the memo.

732627283211493376 2016-05-17 17:42:10 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @AttyAbdul Things have definitely gotten worse faster since Indiana became a super-majority.

729656742779355137 2016-05-09 12:58:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I think that the best sabotage on #CutthroatKitchen is just putting Truffle Oil in the pantry. @altonbrown
729656540924252160 2016-05-09 12:57:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If I have learned one thing from watching countless cooking competition shows, it's that truffle oil is for chumps

726109726803648512 2016-04-29 18:03:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Everyone came out to support @BernieSanders today. #BobaForBernie #IndyComicConpic.twitter.com/a7IAeVSprX

726053254161813504 2016-04-29 14:19:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I have yet to meet a homebrewer that doesn't have a desire to start their own brewery. Some people just commit to their daydreams.
726051357065506817 2016-04-29 14:11:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Tonight I'll cold crash my Gose for the #BrewersCup & my Saison for the @UplandBrewCo #UpCup #CompetitionSeason
726050043153637376 2016-04-29 14:06:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ScarletLaneBrew Cold crashing some homebrews and brewing another.
725810407861026820 2016-04-28 22:14:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @UplandBrewCo dang, same day as my daughter's birthday party. Can we reschedule?
725808763358351361 2016-04-28 22:07:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> What the hell @Huggies? Switching the 2t-3t pullups to cars instead of jake? Now my son wont wear them. #toddlerproblems
725807888850161667 2016-04-28 22:04:20 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman weird
725807448787935232 2016-04-28 22:02:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman ha, was actually not going to blame you. There seems to be some confusion online, but that's definitely the fear of 13.
725802438935101442 2016-04-28 21:42:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Did you say triskadecaphobia is the fear of pickles? @WillPadgman
725781136018956288 2016-04-28 20:18:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @IndianaCityBeer @ronlewhorn is it weird that I find that just as exciting as having my beer made by you?
725733552197787649 2016-04-28 17:08:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If I could sit down & have a beer with any presidential candidate from the past 12 years, it would still be @BarackObama (@POTUS ) #Anytime
725732468746153985 2016-04-28 17:04:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I bet @BarackObama has a favorite Indiana Craft Beer.
725731613380734976 2016-04-28 17:01:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @peeweeherman Something about this is extremely unsettling.

725380898196054017 2016-04-27 17:47:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BrewStuds Just make sure you emphasize it correctly. "When's the last time YOUR lines were cleaned?" *wink*
725380559577305088 2016-04-27 17:46:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TopherGrace I hope you know I'm kidding. #PleaseBeMyfriend #YouWereGreatInInterstellar
725379558409527296 2016-04-27 17:42:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Yup. Because women are constantly being victimized by other women. It's a real problem.   https://twitter.com/CharlieAF1/status/725378125324939264
725378621423017984 2016-04-27 17:38:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TopherGrace Glad you're having so much fun. You deserve it. #WinADateWithTadHamilton #venom

725376077678309377 2016-04-27 17:28:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> If you made a book of numbers it would be big enough to reach the edge of the universe. Also, it would be totally boring #WednesdayWisdom
725375443541463040 2016-04-27 17:25:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Is a #womancard like a subway punch card? If so, how many women does @realDonaldTrump have to insult before he gets a free slap in the face?
725375029454602240 2016-04-27 17:24:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I dunno, add a bunch of burnouts and slow-mo shots of people getting out of cars. Basically just make The Fast & the Furious #MakeAMovieSick
725374299863932928 2016-04-27 17:21:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The only thing the outnumbers numbers is people who don't care about numbers #NumbersFact #ScienceFact

725302633712390144 2016-04-27 12:36:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> When making a homebrew recipe, asking for input from other brewers is typically a non-starter. Just make want you want. #Brewlife

724735384563806210 2016-04-25 23:02:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Indybeersleuth @ScarletLaneBrew This beer is black magic. I can't figure out how you use that much coconut without having an oil slick.
724669053873344512 2016-04-25 18:39:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Well then. I'd better put in maximum effort.https://twitter.com/ronlewhorn/status/724666387864555520
724604788369813505 2016-04-25 14:23:38 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> People in my office treat the weekend like you went on vacation.
724592622803677186 2016-04-25 13:35:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The #1 question I have @IndianaCityBeer is, If I win will the Summer #HomebrewBattle will @ronlewhorn design some artwork for my beer?
724587509775101955 2016-04-25 13:14:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> My greatest fear is becoming the person my @Spotify Discover Weekly playlist thinks I am.
723532760166465537 2016-04-22 15:23:47 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Gotta get my beer for the @IndianaCityBeer #HomebrewerBattle brewed this weekend, but I've also got a playset to put together. #Brewlife

722854718188310528 2016-04-20 18:29:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HotBoxPizza Meh. Wasn't trying to sound complainy. Pizza was great as always. Love you guys.
722841658052595712 2016-04-20 17:37:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> My #UpCup entry is looking/smelling fantastic. Getting excited to bring it to @UplandBrewCo in a couple of weeks. #BringMeThatChickenDinner
722821657988108288 2016-04-20 16:18:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Jazzed about $1 slices @HotBoxPizza today. But it sucks I placed an order ahead of time and still have to wait in 20 min line to pick it up.
722191583026769921 2016-04-18 22:34:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright haha. Right? Seriously though, if ya'll ever want to talk, let me know. More than happy to help.
722189781199937537 2016-04-18 22:27:16 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright @WillPadgman ill take that as a win
722188835271098374 2016-04-18 22:23:30 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright @WillPadgman You're welcome. I'm blushing. Stop thanking me. Just get better.
722188419057762305 2016-04-18 22:21:51 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright Dang. It really needs it. The neighbors are starting to get mad. Well, if you wanna talk anyway, let me know.
722188008649277442 2016-04-18 22:20:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright @WillPadgman Well, that's rude. But also false. This whole situation will stick with you.
722187147051200514 2016-04-18 22:16:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright I pay 5 bucks and free beer, but you have to supply your own gas and mower.
722186868616491009 2016-04-18 22:15:41 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright true, but one makes me laugh way harder. And, in my experience, one impacts a person more.
722186386611302401 2016-04-18 22:13:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright do you mow lawns?
722186199172018176 2016-04-18 22:13:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright Exactly. But you won't know its a mistake unless someone points it out. If you can't handle criticism...
722185943860559872 2016-04-18 22:12:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright Finally, some common ground. Do you always get so angry when someone points out you're wrong?
722185628973142016 2016-04-18 22:10:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright Sorry for trying to help them be better.
722185557808455680 2016-04-18 22:10:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @WillPadgman @chicksonright When you are on the radio you have a responsibility to report facts. Otherwise you are just spreading lies.
722185248461688833 2016-04-18 22:09:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright Well, in that case, I think you might be off by a couple dollar signs. I'm way more of an asshole than a $$ hole.
722183089565405184 2016-04-18 22:00:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright Well, that escalated quickly. Also, maybe a touch hypocritical. Name calling is beneath you.
722180135173152769 2016-04-18 21:48:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright Can you tell me how?
722178098427506689 2016-04-18 21:40:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Nah. Id do it. Id expect it as well. @chicksonright

722175173873516546 2016-04-18 21:29:13 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @chicksonright @93wibc http://www.snopes.com/woman-record-14-kids/
722174976330231810 2016-04-18 21:28:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> As further evidence that the @chicksonright are a living embodiment of my moms facebook page, they just reported a fake story. Again.
722066597242740736 2016-04-18 14:17:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @TinManBrewing called Kahns and they have some. So I'll be running over there on lunch. Thanks for helping!. Can't wait to try it!

718052335058952192 2016-04-07 12:26:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @93wibc @tonykatz The plan from @BernieSanders would cost 1.4 trillion over 10 years according to the tax foundation.

718038482438979585 2016-04-07 11:31:29 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Damn. Satan must be ice skating because @tonykatz on @93wibc is actually saying something right. You cant preach while giving tickets.

717753973910835200 2016-04-06 16:40:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> When is the signup for the @IndianaCityBeer #HomeBrewerBattle2016? I have a recipe I've been wanting to try out. Seems like the perfect time
717694116826628096 2016-04-06 12:43:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> After work my beer had a thick white krausen and this AM was bubbling steady @FinalGravityHS @omegayeast Apparently patience IS a virtue.
717462584119717888 2016-04-05 21:23:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Shit, just realized @FinalGravityHS is closed today. Hope my beer will be ok without yeast until tomorrow. Dang.
717453804535283712 2016-04-05 20:48:11 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @bentrailbrewery Wish I could get @longjohnslvrs to follow me too. I'd be proud.
717453335117242369 2016-04-05 20:46:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BAKilley By that do you mean I Saw The Sign played on repeat for 45 minutes?
717452989540077568 2016-04-05 20:44:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Tonight I'll be watching all The Cannonball Run movies and live tweeting my problems with them. Expect complete silence. @HDTGM #perfection
717399620654141440 2016-04-05 17:12:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Does Saisonstein's Monster from @omegayeast have a slow start? Its been over 24 hours with no activity.
717390594973118464 2016-04-05 16:37:00 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Still no activity on my Saison his morning. Looks like I'll be stopping by @FinalGravityHS on the way home to buy some more yeast.
717375935398326272 2016-04-05 15:38:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @PFTompkins Do you know if there ARE rules about dogs playing basketball? Or is Air Bud just another piece of hollywood bullshit? #FinalFour
717149946089226241 2016-04-04 00:40:45 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS Will do, thanks.
717121142184611844 2016-04-04 22:46:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS hi. Do you have any more of the saisonsteins monster? It's been 14 hours and no activity.
717006817620922369 2016-04-04 15:12:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Awesome. Preserving history is important. Indiana Beer History, even more important.https://twitter.com/IndianaOnTap/status/716993303980298241

716833176522502144 2016-04-03 03:42:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> The yeast gives it away, but can anyone guess what im making for #upcup @UplandBrewCo this year? #Winnerpic.twitter.com/ValH10PydA

715221068701638656 2016-03-30 16:56:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing @homebrewchat At the time I was extract brewing. So, in the steep. Shoulda whirpooled em to keep color/flavor. Or hopbacked
715214534189981697 2016-03-30 16:30:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing @homebrewchat of course. Like 5 lbs peeled and shredded. Made for a super orange brew. Shoulda added carrot at flameout tho
715203891378446336 2016-03-30 15:47:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @homebrewchat @mutedogbrewing wait, weirdest? Carrot cake beer. 1 of my first creations. So many ingredients. Not bad, but heavy on ginger
715203573039112193 2016-03-30 15:46:34 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @homebrewchat @mutedogbrewing chai tea IPA. Conceptually, maybe ok. But I used an entire box of chai and boiled it with wort.

713447422815383552 2016-03-25 19:28:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Time to make my spring seasonal "HeftyWeizen." an 11% ABV Hefe made with a different fruit each year. This year I'm going Kiwi.
713420177589841922 2016-03-25 17:39:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS of course.
713186415560040448 2016-03-24 02:11:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @gr8fermentation any way I could get a breakdown of the parts/equipment?
713074296608829440 2016-03-24 18:45:35 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Ever notice how Austin, Texas sounds like Ostentatious? Coincidence? Probably.
713073488580349952 2016-03-24 18:42:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I'm like 6 episodes behind on the @ComedyBangBang2 podcast. Guess I need to get my self-flagellation gear out of storage.
713069948524859392 2016-03-24 18:28:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @FinalGravityHS Are you still taking hop Rhizome orders? Was thinking of planting some this year for the first time.
713069136859914240 2016-03-24 18:25:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing Sounds liek a terrible idea, but how about a Belgian Dark Saison. I busted out a quick recipe here https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/watchdog-dcac98
712989004417765376 2016-03-24 13:06:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Feeling embarrassed. @Marvel apparently remade Venom in 2011 and I never knew. Catching up now, and I'm so happy with what I'm reading.

712639812939853824 2016-03-23 13:59:06 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @GovPenceIN @93wibc Downward momentum? Because you definitely have placed infrastructure that puts this state into a downward spiral.

708353644349906944 2016-03-11 18:07:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing I'm assuming it would have to be dried/kilned before using because of enzymes or science or something.
708280216347660288 2016-03-11 13:15:37 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Anyone who, like @tonykatz on @93wibc, would advocate ordering an American soldier to murder a child to fight terror, is simply disgusting.
708279383254032384 2016-03-11 13:12:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> You cant defeat ISIS by matching horror for horror, terror for terror. Dont become your enemy. Defeat the idea. Be better @tonykatz @93wibc
708276213337464832 2016-03-11 12:59:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Wow. @tonykatz on @93wibc is advocating wholesale murder of infants, children & women In the war with ISIS. You sir, sound like a terrorist.

707070772544667648 2016-03-07 05:09:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 you can enforce speech, but not thought. Hate doesn't end because people don't talk about it.
707070640713551872 2016-03-07 05:09:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 So, you would enforce correctness, opinion, by law? That, is tyranny.
707057768595898368 2016-03-07 04:18:03 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 The court of public opinion is very real, and very strong.

707057331658424321 2016-03-07 04:16:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 But we can't if we don't get to hear it. In the USA, the people are supposed to take ownership.
707057202071207936 2016-03-07 04:15:48 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 And it does. Gov has no place saying what is and isn't ok to say. The people do. We decide.
707056349574774784 2016-03-07 04:12:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I think my rant on free speech made me lose like 10 followers. Guess I'll go back to talking about beer.

707054470019080192 2016-03-07 04:04:56 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 pretty sure your bill of rights and constitution was based on the USA. As are those of most countries.
707054253790126080 2016-03-07 04:04:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 1A allows us to think for ourselves, decide for ourselves, and be responsible for ourselves.
707054003000107009 2016-03-07 04:03:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 got it. What about the rest? are you going to draw that line in the sand? Where does it end?
707053805989457920 2016-03-07 04:02:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 outlawing the Klan and outlawing what the klan says are two different things.
707052857309175808 2016-03-07 03:58:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 1A is the most important, most vital to freedom, and most basic of our rights.
707051998479306752 2016-03-07 03:55:07 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 I could do this all day. Start drawing lines, you don't stop. Who should have the power to decide? You?
707051781801570306 2016-03-07 03:54:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 Can germans have the right to talk? Or is it just members of the Nazi Party who aren't allowed?
707051597323444224 2016-03-07 03:53:31 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 Can wall street bankers talk? Is it white collar crimes, or just violent ones?
707051422228078592 2016-03-07 03:52:50 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 If that is the line you draw, then a lot of people aren't allowed to speak.
707051312802877442 2016-03-07 03:52:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 Ok. So what groups are allowed to talk? Are Catholics? Christians? Muslims? Russians? Hell, Americans?
707050391049998337 2016-03-07 03:48:44 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 lots of people say hateful stupid things but I will stand and defend every one of their rights to do so
707050163223859200 2016-03-07 03:47:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 To outright threaten a person or group with harm is against the law. To say something hateful isn't.
707049767122149376 2016-03-07 03:46:15 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BullsLawDan Are they public institutions? Of course they are. Look, we agree on a lot, just not a conspiratorial subversive liberal agenda
707049170738266113 2016-03-07 03:43:53 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 Do you want North Korea? Cause thats how you get North Korea.

707048955448844289 2016-03-07 03:43:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 It truly is why we are better than them.
707048905117200384 2016-03-07 03:42:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 Sorry man. Just because a group is vile doesn't mean they can't say whatever they want in America.
707048433169899520 2016-03-07 03:40:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BullsLawDan @Spearhafoc_ @toneill92 @cacisa2j definitely a public institution, High Schools. Middle Schools. etc. All have speech codes
707047548884754432 2016-03-07 03:37:26 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack I mean, why would the Gov introduce miscegenation laws? The religious demanded it. We are growing up
707046596660305921 2016-03-07 03:33:39 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack Which churches already didnt allow on biblical basis. The more we get religion out the better we get.
707045964272553984 2016-03-07 03:31:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BullsLawDan @Spearhafoc_ @toneill92 this, we can agree on.
707045506783039488 2016-03-07 03:29:19 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j exactly. Now youre getting it.
707045401984155649 2016-03-07 03:28:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BullsLawDan @Spearhafoc_ @toneill92 @cacisa2j dont care. Any institution can make rules. Cant carry a gun on campus either.
707044773442547713 2016-03-07 03:26:24 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j we have laws against threats, slander, libel, etc. Those don't count.
707044422211473410 2016-03-07 03:25:01 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j no, that's the best one. They still have right to assemble and speak to whatever they believe
707044219433709568 2016-03-07 03:24:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j maybe, but let's be clear, what kind of apeeech needs protecting?
707043986335264768 2016-03-07 03:23:17 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j 1A is perfect.
707043799726477313 2016-03-07 03:22:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @BullsLawDan @Spearhafoc_ @toneill92 @cacisa2j false on that front though.
707043687524597760 2016-03-07 03:22:05 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j 1A protects everything from the KKK to an internet blog about cookies.
707043471316623361 2016-03-07 03:21:14 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j polite speech doesnt need protecting. Hate speech, controversial speech, etc does.
707043299463450624 2016-03-07 03:20:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @Spearhafoc_ @BullsLawDan @toneill92 @cacisa2j The example of college campuses is ridiculous, but the 1A is meant to protect hate speech.

707039712184311813 2016-03-07 03:06:18 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @LeighLis @SinCityCarol @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton he shouldve explained better. He did say "you mean wall street bailout?"
707038160807661569 2016-03-07 03:00:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @shelbyfero then we'll have something in common. #boom #nailedit #micdrop
707037804912623617 2016-03-07 02:58:43 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack I could destroy this argument all day. It's one of the worst ones I have heard.
707037673379254272 2016-03-07 02:58:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack was it ok when the government said that gays cant marry? They saw the light, and you shut your eyes.
707037380419710977 2016-03-07 02:57:02 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack government has a say on anything to do with laws/legal matters.
707037154719997952 2016-03-07 02:56:08 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack The fact its a legal contract between two adults is also why every slippery slope argument fails.
707036964709638144 2016-03-07 02:55:23 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack the government has every place in marriage, its a legal matter. Laws are set/enforced by government.
707036712287997952 2016-03-07 02:54:22 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack who draws the line? Which churches can issue a marriage license? The government.
707036382431223809 2016-03-07 02:53:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @cacisa2j @jaydeflix @michaelianblack its legal. Which is why any two adults who can enter into a legal contract should be able to marry.
707036032760418304 2016-03-07 02:51:40 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Gotta say I was disappointed with @cracked & the After Hours crew for not addressing my questions about @TheRock or #TheRundown2 #Forshame
707034621234561024 2016-03-07 02:46:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @michaelianblack you an me both. Are you adverse to getting naked on the internet? I could he your digital pimp.

707032579455762432 2016-03-07 02:37:57 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @CeCePleasants @PFTompkins im stuck in limbo over here. Someone tell @NickCannon to make up his damn mind already.
707032084326576128 2016-03-07 02:35:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> It might be an arrogant thought, but I guarantee if I could get @TheRock to listen to my pitch for #TheRundown2 he would be on board.
707031701487263744 2016-03-07 02:34:28 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I cant decide what I want more. @BernieSanders to be president, or to get @TheRock to make #TheRundown2. #NeedAdvice #MichiganPrimary
707031020793688064 2016-03-07 02:31:46 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Those voting in #MichiganPrimary are smart, strong, resilient, hard-working people. Vote for your best interests. Vote for @BernieSanders
707029872582008832 2016-03-07 02:27:12 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Might have missed it, but who is the @AFLCIO endorsing? Also, why?
707029294913077248 2016-03-07 02:24:54 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> As the son of a member of the @steelworkers let me suggest you endorse @BernieSanders in all primaries. Help the middle class be great again
707028922748248064 2016-03-07 02:23:25 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Hi @UAW just curious who you endorse for the primary? For what it matters, I think @SenSanders has a long history of union support.
706907736269676544 2016-03-07 18:21:52 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @ScottAukerman Who's in that?
706677636035174401 2016-03-06 03:07:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> I hope @PureMichigan knows that @SenSanders is on their side and is a voice for middle class Americans, unions, and the poor. #FeelTheBern
706675369710100480 2016-03-06 02:58:32 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @HillaryClinton  "Who do you pray for?" The correct answer - Who gives a shit. Religion has no place in politics #DemDebate

705790361902256128 2016-03-04 16:21:49 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> Time for my yearly daydream of starting a brewery. Anyone know where I can get 300K without getting naked on the internet or dealing drugs?

705451562907242496 2016-03-03 17:55:33 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing The main difference is 6-row has a higher diastic power but a lower yield. If your saison has a lot of adjuncts go for it
705405363521064961 2016-03-03 14:51:59 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing @PNWHC Any way you could share that slideshow?
705020850219708416 2016-03-02 13:24:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> My recommendation to @SenSanders is to spend 1/2 his 40mil in FL and the other 1/2 in OH. You also need MI, WA, & IL. #ItsNotOver #GetToWork

703302027200233472 2016-02-26 19:34:04 UTC <TheGr8Sarcasmo> @mutedogbrewing That'd be interesting. I think a craft brewery that really showcased malts and made them the star would do well.
