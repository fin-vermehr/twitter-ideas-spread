947551542474952705 2017-12-31 19:34:27 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw Agreed. Would've kept nick in until we scored a touchdown or until the 2nd half. Whatever came first
947546293576101889 2017-12-31 19:13:35 UTC <Dhubb4> Are we talking about how incredible Sidney's close-in speed is yet? Or should we wait till the end of the game?

946531639580086272 2017-12-28 00:01:43 UTC <Dhubb4> @PatMcAfeeShow @JOEL9ONE Podcast soon?
946524805624459264 2017-12-28 23:34:33 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay @steve_pizzo Again...playing in a game is probably a prerequisite
946513527535173637 2017-12-28 22:49:44 UTC <Dhubb4> Trojan Friday is upon us  #beatosu
946504841785958400 2017-12-28 22:15:14 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay Haha I'm just fuckin around about manning but I think Todd gurley and AB as great as they are shouldn't even be in the convo
946503069755420672 2017-12-28 22:08:11 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay Gurley*
946502631660376065 2017-12-28 22:06:27 UTC <Dhubb4> My man is all the motivation I need...just crushing lifehttps://twitter.com/usc_athletics/status/946480287420157953
946502418740768769 2017-12-28 22:05:36 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay But I agree with you...Todd Hurley is definitely not MVP because of that
946502156303126528 2017-12-28 22:04:33 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay If that's the case then Peyton manning has been the MVP for the broncos since he retired 
946501758402035715 2017-12-28 22:02:59 UTC <Dhubb4> @BarstoolBigCat @RealRiggy That's crazy....great plays get broken up all the time because the defender rather give up 15 than 60.
946501433272172547 2017-12-28 22:01:41 UTC <Dhubb4> @_br0zay Lol but you probably should have to play more than half the games
946500441042554881 2017-12-28 21:57:44 UTC <Dhubb4> @BarstoolBigCat Only getting 15 yards for PI is up there too

946494731848175619 2017-12-28 21:35:03 UTC <Dhubb4> It's crazy that sports people who do this for a living clearly don't understand what MVP means. This should be a two man race between Carson Wentz and Tom Brady...
946090156733358081 2017-12-27 18:47:25 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @TSnead13 @CoachBalbert @TonyD_4 I think it's because abbreviations look terrible on jerseys and Phila. Is just so iconic that they get away with it

943131739559522305 2017-12-19 14:51:43 UTC <Dhubb4> @chrisZerfass @AdrianFedkiw @CoachBalbert @skulman7 @TonyD_4 Hahaha and chip Kelly's best FA signing

I see the point you're trying to make. But all I'm saying is that he was worth a draft pick and 0 out of 32 teams thought that. It's not that crazy
943126874678587393 2017-12-19 14:32:24 UTC <Dhubb4> @chrisZerfass @AdrianFedkiw @TonyD_4 @CoachBalbert @skulman7 Idk. You score 6tds in a game you're probably worth a 7th rounder...

926087807608803328 2017-11-02 14:05:13 UTC <Dhubb4> @JahlilOkafor @Isaiah_Thomas @ChaseEnCash The GM has pushed for him to play more and he played a lot over the last two years. You can't use the first week of this season as an excuse
926080137841569792 2017-11-02 13:34:45 UTC <Dhubb4> @JahlilOkafor @Isaiah_Thomas How are we "doing him"?He's literally had the most time to prove himself out of anybody on that team

914510529074429954 2017-10-01 15:21:15 UTC <Dhubb4> @d_irz_ yo how pumped are you for the return of Curb tonight?
914480108035035137 2017-10-01 13:20:22 UTC <Dhubb4> @chrisZerfass Or maybe just a QB that doesn't lose 30 yards on 3rd and goal
913138915112046595 2017-09-27 20:30:57 UTC <Dhubb4> @BarstoolClemson Hey just wanted to say that I appreciate you guys and all that you do #keeptrolling
913121244740034560 2017-09-27 19:20:44 UTC <Dhubb4> @TorreySmithWR @Richard58203116 @Seanye68 @CowgirlCas22 But you don't want to hear that
913121208840880128 2017-09-27 19:20:35 UTC <Dhubb4> @TorreySmithWR @Richard58203116 @Seanye68 @CowgirlCas22 Nobody is protesting all of them! Literally everyone of them has said they respect the troops and the good officers
913117813967085569 2017-09-27 19:07:06 UTC <Dhubb4> @TorreySmithWR @Richard58203116 @Seanye68 @CowgirlCas22 Sweetheart your statistics are the only thing dividing us. Ignoring the fact the police brutality exists will never get us anywhere
913076166713593856 2017-09-27 16:21:36 UTC <Dhubb4> @TorreySmithWR @Richard58203116 @Seanye68 They're doing it because they can't burn actual black people instead
912857222547410944 2017-09-26 01:51:36 UTC <Dhubb4> @NFL @FSKPart3 @CCphernow @awesometravis @KennethJack14 Lol seriously don't worry about me man. Worry about all of the other clear evidence you have. Why is our word not enough for you?

912849515878731776 2017-09-26 01:20:59 UTC <Dhubb4> @NFL @FSKPart3 @CCphernow @awesometravis @KennethJack14 I don't need to look at the numbers. I've seen it happen. How many do you think don't get caught on camera or go unreported? It's quite alot
912849049107226625 2017-09-26 01:19:07 UTC <Dhubb4> @NFL @FSKPart3 @CCphernow @awesometravis @KennethJack14 Thanks for being reasonable. They just want people to see that it's happening and things need to change. 1 young life lost is too many
912848844043554819 2017-09-26 01:18:18 UTC <Dhubb4> @NFL @FSKPart3 @CCphernow @awesometravis @KennethJack14 I understand that most cops are good people. But it clearly happens enough to make an entire league of men demonstrate a protest
912846226940465152 2017-09-26 01:07:55 UTC <Dhubb4> @NFL @FSKPart3 @CCphernow @awesometravis @KennethJack14 Yea but our country arrests cop killers. And black men killers go free. That's the point

910966711570124800 2017-09-21 20:39:23 UTC <Dhubb4> @TyJohnsonNews @TonyD_4 Also they aren't in any trouble. People still choose to play football knowing the risks
910966392878518273 2017-09-21 20:38:07 UTC <Dhubb4> @TyJohnsonNews @TonyD_4 They exist. The NFL hasn't adopted them for multiple reasons

907964653116026880 2017-09-13 13:50:17 UTC <Dhubb4> @EliotShorrParks @Len845 But it's fair to question whether his play calling is aiding or hurting his young QB who we all are hoping can be one of the GOATs
907964322315456513 2017-09-13 13:48:58 UTC <Dhubb4> @EliotShorrParks @Len845 Oh that's the first example this season. I can give you 16 more from every game last week.  I like Doug
907962445146345477 2017-09-13 13:41:30 UTC <Dhubb4> @EliotShorrParks When he calls a screen on 3rd and 10, and the entire building knows what the play is...it's fair to question his play calling

884532690497753089 2017-07-10 22:00:01 UTC <Dhubb4> @SportsRadioWIP @TonyD_4 Hey he's just a corny white guy who likes to dance at black eyed peas concerts. Let the man live
884530468481376256 2017-07-10 21:51:12 UTC <Dhubb4> @SportsRadioWIP @TonyD_4 Second, you just described every person who was ever born in North Dakota. Who did you think you were getting Cam Newton?
884528660857933824 2017-07-10 21:44:01 UTC <Dhubb4> @SportsRadioWIP @TonyD_4 Bout to catch these hands
884528612849975297 2017-07-10 21:43:49 UTC <Dhubb4> @SportsRadioWIP @TonyD_4 Uh hold up...Are you bad mouthing my lord and savior on the internet right now?
884470354261012480 2017-07-10 17:52:19 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @CoachBalbert @TonyD_4 Click bait trash. I love how he doesn't feel the need to justify any of his takes with an article or coherent sentence. Just lists stats
884469673487675393 2017-07-10 17:49:37 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @TonyD_4 @CoachBalbert Exactly, and I love Eric Berry but that's just ridiculous
884466114964721664 2017-07-10 17:35:29 UTC <Dhubb4>  @d_irz_https://twitter.com/hbo/status/884464762280484864
884461873436950534 2017-07-10 17:18:37 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @TonyD_4 @CoachBalbert BUT the worst part of this has to be putting Eric berry ahead of Brian Dawkins...like what planet does this guy live on?
884461193225785345 2017-07-10 17:15:55 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @TonyD_4 @CoachBalbert Yes Troy and ed are 1 and 2 no matter what, I don't care what order
884456773737996289 2017-07-10 16:58:21 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @CoachBalbert @TonyD_4 His other lists are absolutely ridiculous too. But this one is the worst.
884456494418231296 2017-07-10 16:57:15 UTC <Dhubb4> @AdrianFedkiw @CoachBalbert @TonyD_4 I was going to be outraged about this list and then I realized that Gil Brant is like 80 years old and probably hates modern football

878200775343824896 2017-06-23 10:39:15 UTC <Dhubb4> Yes. I've never agreed with anything more.https://twitter.com/kfcbarstool/status/878198077961777152
878021220733562881 2017-06-22 22:45:46 UTC <Dhubb4> It's absurd to me that we're about to draft and trade players for next year but we don't even know who the damn MVP was last year

871693229246361601 2017-06-05 11:40:35 UTC <Dhubb4> @Ike58Reese That's fair. The comparison doesn't work in my opinion because a pitcher can't affect an entire series like adding a player in the NBA does
871684155528138752 2017-06-05 11:04:32 UTC <Dhubb4> @Ike58Reese Comparing 4 pitchers to 4 NBA players is wildly inaccurate...that's the truth

870064945748217858 2017-05-31 23:50:22 UTC <Dhubb4> @BarstoolBigCat In a world where every series either has to be super dark or stupid funny I think it plays well. Not perfect but something different.

866615368256806913 2017-05-22 11:22:59 UTC <Dhubb4> Still can't get the two hour Twin Peaks episode out of my head...season is gonna be a wild ride
866615083480342528 2017-05-22 11:21:51 UTC <Dhubb4> This upsets me, but then I realize white people are the ones who should really be angry at thishttps://twitter.com/scott_ceoofsuh/status/866398878089617408
866462246070878212 2017-05-21 01:14:32 UTC <Dhubb4> 10 minutes in, nothing has happened, and I am absolutely enthralled #Twinpeaks
865634010315104258 2017-05-19 18:23:25 UTC <Dhubb4> @caplannfl I get that. You still can't just assume that we would have been 6-10 just because the starters weren't in.
865571935681298433 2017-05-19 14:16:45 UTC <Dhubb4> It's crazy how 5 years ago everybody thought a new elite QB rivalry was brewing with Wilson and kaep and now Kaep might be Wilson's back up

865513046432555008 2017-05-19 10:22:45 UTC <Dhubb4> @d_irz_ @chrisZerfass I don't like this one bit

865379487936118784 2017-05-18 01:32:02 UTC <Dhubb4> This Nipples and Toes scene from Master of None had me crying
865208171761192960 2017-05-18 14:11:17 UTC <Dhubb4> @caplannfl How can you chalk that up as a loss for us? We took Dallas to O.T. at home mid season. Easily could have been a win even with starters
865184848528494592 2017-05-18 12:38:36 UTC <Dhubb4> @BevinDolup Dude willingly hopped on a sinking ship
865184752214704129 2017-05-18 12:38:13 UTC <Dhubb4> @BevinDolup Yea but the thing with Rhule is that this stuff was already lightly reported and everyone knew the details would come out eventually
865154606967508992 2017-05-18 10:38:26 UTC <Dhubb4> The thing with Isaiah is if he ain't scoring 50 a game, he's pretty much useless. There I said it

809445422792081408 2016-12-15 17:10:02 UTC <Dhubb4> @EliotShorrParks probably why it takes him an entire season to recover from a hamstring injury

809080202777260033 2016-12-14 16:58:46 UTC <Dhubb4> Coach Collins has me jacked up for 2017 already
809080104538279936 2016-12-14 16:58:23 UTC <Dhubb4> He just compared Temple football to the broad street bullies.
809023389822308353 2016-12-14 13:13:01 UTC <Dhubb4> You know you hit rock bottom when you're at the water cooler saying "at least the hockey team is good"

808692580791762944 2016-12-13 15:18:30 UTC <Dhubb4> @nicktrone @TonyD_4 the difference being that addazio was heavily criticized/disliked...A lot of Florida fans wanted Collins as HC

808035624146104323 2016-12-11 19:48:00 UTC <Dhubb4> Desean definitely held back a celebration because he wants us to sign him next year

776962578765508608 2016-09-16 01:54:48 UTC <Dhubb4> @lllaurenbrown I don't know I guess there is a lot of weirdos out there
776910407155847168 2016-09-16 22:27:30 UTC <Dhubb4> @lllaurenbrown by far the worst ingredient in Chex mix. I'm disappointed in your snack game
776020029221531648 2016-09-14 11:29:27 UTC <Dhubb4> @cj_walter miss him so much
775291981484453888 2016-09-12 11:16:27 UTC <Dhubb4> @ZSchavone @tslineyhttps://twitter.com/barstooltrent/status/775175762680877056
775113448401301508 2016-09-11 23:27:01 UTC <Dhubb4> Thank you so much Dak and Terrance for that wonderful ending
775026270719528960 2016-09-11 17:40:36 UTC <Dhubb4> Fix your shit ESPN!
774062285123878912 2016-09-08 01:50:04 UTC <Dhubb4> @jmies0904 makes sense because Bob already knew the fullback wasn't dead
774061950397325313 2016-09-08 01:48:45 UTC <Dhubb4> @jmies0904 I bet $1 million that Bob said that and you just tweeted it
773111846203260928 2016-09-06 10:53:22 UTC <Dhubb4> @ZSchavone haven't seen it yet but situation level is rough
773111624047689728 2016-09-06 10:52:29 UTC <Dhubb4> @RealRiggy it was a run for the record books
772923508770934784 2016-09-05 22:24:59 UTC <Dhubb4> @holaloula it's a great move. And that statement is besides the point.
772877401873379328 2016-09-05 19:21:46 UTC <Dhubb4> @holaloula nobody lied, An opportunity presented itself and they reacted accordingly
772197635147038720 2016-09-03 22:20:37 UTC <Dhubb4> For anybody who was worried about Temple going to the Big 12. I think Houston just ended that discussion
772088929411530752 2016-09-03 15:08:40 UTC <Dhubb4> Oh my god. Somebody lock up Adelehttps://twitter.com/kfcbarstool/status/772087844026318848

771865754128056320 2016-09-02 00:21:51 UTC <Dhubb4> @RealRiggy I feel you
771489459779100672 2016-09-01 23:26:35 UTC <Dhubb4> This move by penn state just shows that they have no idea how the rest of the country views them
767513414092533760 2016-08-21 00:07:12 UTC <Dhubb4> @tsliney
