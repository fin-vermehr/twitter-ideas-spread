You must admit this is an artificial system that leads to manipulation. Is it really better than the late '90s for college basketball? I know it probably is for the NBA.
969573402012016640 2018-03-02 14:01:27 UTC <SteadyMo> @tsnmike The G League is not a draft and place league for all prospects. You don't play Triple A baseball with hopes of getting drafted. A team has to invest in your career and place you for a minor league to be legit IMO. You can't get drafted and placed out of HS.

969566152165912581 2018-03-02 13:32:39 UTC <SteadyMo> @tsnmike In baseball, unlike other team sports in the US, the top players have the option of college or a legitimate professional developmental system. Without leaving the country. NCAA baseball isn't hurt. MLB isn't lacking developed talent. Players get compensation THEY choose.

958585768376786944 2018-01-30 06:20:31 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry I'm interested in discussing the nuance of individual issue but I'm fascinated by the tribal nature of our two party politics and core principles that set us on either side.
958581779631308801 2018-01-30 06:04:40 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry Conservative ideologies are diverse and often conflicting but do have connecting principals. That's why I focus on individualism versus collectivism. The core. What do we mean when we say "out of many, one" and are founded on the rights of the individual.
958580441568735233 2018-01-30 05:59:21 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry There really isn't an ideology that is the representative of the opposite of that limited a definition of conservatism.

958567703723368449 2018-01-30 05:08:44 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry Ironically that is why people in immigrant communities like the one I was raised in are more conservative than you'd expect
958566077230977025 2018-01-30 05:02:16 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry The more people you consider "them" as oppose to "us" the more likely you are to be conservative. In any place in this world.
958560822019678208 2018-01-30 04:41:23 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry I'd go with least disputable rather than only accurate. These are are generalizations that are oversimplify our division. I agree this is the core of it.
958559612332052481 2018-01-30 04:36:35 UTC <SteadyMo> Tribalism benefits them. Regionalism benefits them. Racial divisions are their bread and butter. Gender inequalities are the jam on their toast. Xenophobia is the butter. You must remember this.
958557786538946560 2018-01-30 04:29:20 UTC <SteadyMo> Republicans and their donors benefit most from you viewing your community as being as small as possible. The less human beings you care enough about to demand big things from your government the better.

945036566476533761 2017-12-24 21:00:50 UTC <SteadyMo> @adagioforstring First off. Immigrants are American. They are proven to move to follow opportunity a little more than other Americans. That's hardly a knock on anyone's intelligence or work ethic.

Don't lie. There's a record.

939874452585709569 2017-12-10 15:08:26 UTC <SteadyMo> @tsnmike @AlbertBreer If the Heisman was truly about most special player there would be a dozen defensive winners and a handful of offensive linemen. You do make a decent argument for the most exciting player being the best player and that being the Heisman criteria going forward.
939871981721309184 2017-12-10 14:58:37 UTC <SteadyMo> @tsnmike @AlbertBreer To me the most special player (MSP) has always been the best player. Unfortunately that guy has never regularly won the Heisman. It's not a new trend born of straw polling. It's the historic norm.
939867465395392513 2017-12-10 14:40:40 UTC <SteadyMo> @tsnmike @AlbertBreer The argument here is whether the historic Heisman criteria  has been "most exciting player", "most special player" or "most productive/impactful player". Has the MP/IP become the voting consensus? Yes. Does the MEP still win pretty often? Yes.

922138920548294656 2017-10-22 16:33:45 UTC <SteadyMo> @yougetgelato That's not a pro market argument. It's more of a pro competent dictatorship argument.
922138633292873729 2017-10-22 16:32:37 UTC <SteadyMo> @yougetgelato Isn't that an argument for brutality competent, moderately capitalistic leadership of Saudi over slightly freer, less competent leadership?

921959819543658496 2017-10-21 04:42:04 UTC <SteadyMo> @redsteeze @JoPiercy If policy is the cause it's the failure to prepare for or address a precipitous drop in gas price. Otherwise failure would have been sooner.
921955978010071040 2017-10-21 04:26:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @redsteeze Venezuela is collateral damage of American effort to increase production/ lower oil prices to hurt the RUSSIAN economy.

913507605099814912 2017-09-28 20:55:59 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 That's why people more qualified than you get to decide what qualifies as a terrorist organization. The KKK for instance sanctioned violence
913507119755874306 2017-09-28 20:54:04 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Most people in America in 60s failed MLK on three other your four criteria.
913506760723484673 2017-09-28 20:52:38 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Who mentioned that?
913506381176729600 2017-09-28 20:51:08 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You made an accusation of terrorist activity. You are describing riots and vandalism. Or champion celebrations.
913505935796129793 2017-09-28 20:49:21 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Name an act of political violence sanctioned by BLM
913505523831623680 2017-09-28 20:47:43 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 *now
913505482027016193 2017-09-28 20:47:33 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Are you know saying they frightened you?
913505206041812992 2017-09-28 20:46:27 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 So you think it wrong to be offended by protest?
913504848754233347 2017-09-28 20:45:02 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You define things the way you want to justify your terrorist claim. Terrorist organizations participate in targeted political violence.
913504281365504000 2017-09-28 20:42:47 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You can't just associate any crime committed by someone near or at a protest to BLM. You can't call shooters in DALLAS or Baton Rouge BLM.
913503593700954112 2017-09-28 20:40:03 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You understand that BLM is a collective of organizations with membership, leadership and active political/social accomplishments? Not a mob.
913502198776172544 2017-09-28 20:34:30 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 I stand corrected @The_Dailey  did. You just chimed in with the black terrorist nonsense.
913500879852113920 2017-09-28 20:29:16 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Thanks for providing evidence to my point.
913500313751089152 2017-09-28 20:27:01 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You called Spike Lee another David Duke. I'll stay on this side of reality
913500014453956609 2017-09-28 20:25:50 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Your definition isn't in a dictionary
913499828323274754 2017-09-28 20:25:05 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 The irony is lost on you.
913499515470180352 2017-09-28 20:23:51 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You have to make your own definition of terrorist to make that work. Like I said, enjoy.
913498418563239936 2017-09-28 20:19:29 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Adjusted for population you might consider the proximity in which poor people live to each other and how neighborhoods came to be.
913497890601017349 2017-09-28 20:17:23 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Black paternal participation is actually highest. Marriage rates are lower. But you don't care.
913497602443837446 2017-09-28 20:16:15 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Of course not. You can't see black people as anything but other. Don't ask me if I'm concerned if you aren't. That's just being disingenuous
913496720587329538 2017-09-28 20:12:44 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Ajusted for economics blacks aren't estimated to more criminal. Drug use for instance is equal but arrests are four to one black or brown.
913496195506597888 2017-09-28 20:10:39 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You understand that systematic inequality in justice system and police policy account for a significant amount of arrest disparity?
913495509062623232 2017-09-28 20:07:55 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 How concerned are you about black on black crime when people aren't protesting? To what effect?
913495011844608000 2017-09-28 20:05:57 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 You're serious
913494870739886080 2017-09-28 20:05:23 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Since when have protests not been offensive?
913493199037050880 2017-09-28 19:58:45 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 How effective is it?
913492857037770757 2017-09-28 19:57:23 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 I assume you feel the same about wearing pink for cancer
913492172154003456 2017-09-28 19:54:40 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 Oh, you just like to play make believe. I get it. Enjoy
913488193164660736 2017-09-28 19:38:51 UTC <SteadyMo> @SpikeLee @CNN @mikeb5114 What country has classified BLM as a terrorist organization?
913464637286477824 2017-09-28 18:05:15 UTC <SteadyMo> @realDonaldTrump @ppppolls @ActorAaronBooth This is why voting is so important. This is why voting is suppressed. 
913417040114978819 2017-09-28 14:56:07 UTC <SteadyMo> @kareimoli People don't care about Chicago violence till a brown person expresses any greivance.
913407998290210819 2017-09-28 14:20:11 UTC <SteadyMo> @DrStevePerry Or maybe the way we fund public education which fosters segregation and drastic disparity in quality is a bad joke.

913270012332462080 2017-09-27 05:11:53 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @PoliticalAnt @Mik3Rosario @LegalMediaWire SLPC found the " New Black Panther Party" to be a hate group. They are. They are also not in any way aphilliated with the 60s Black Panthers
913267387100745728 2017-09-27 05:01:27 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @PoliticalAnt @Mik3Rosario @LegalMediaWire You called Malcolm X racist and violent. You called the Black Panther Party racist and violent. You're certain Trump isn't.Race IS your view
913261434020212736 2017-09-27 04:37:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @PoliticalAnt @Mik3Rosario @LegalMediaWire He decried their release and the settlement of their lawsuit

913256569600708609 2017-09-27 04:18:28 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @Mik3Rosario @LegalMediaWire You called Malcolm a racist and slandered the Party  which he wasn't part of. You could give a damn about heritage
913255779033128960 2017-09-27 04:15:19 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @PoliticalAnt @Mik3Rosario @LegalMediaWire Didn't you just call Malcolm a racist?
913254595379519489 2017-09-27 04:10:37 UTC <SteadyMo> @CNN @Gwar56 @charlesroyal Nate is wearing a flag belt. According to flag code that is disrespectful. Are you outraged by a Green Beret doing that?

859188973457076227 2017-05-01 23:33:08 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII You aren't making sense. I know your worldview. You just haven't made a convincing argument for it. Won't even back of claims proven false!
859187077992374276 2017-05-01 23:25:36 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Isn't that the benefit of being the "default"? You realize there people who by no choice of their own have have constant reminders of race?
859186290364993537 2017-05-01 23:22:29 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Are you saying "regardless of racial history, black folk can't have or do anything that doesn't immediately make me feel like I'm included"?
859183272886239233 2017-05-01 23:10:29 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII So you are against universities in general but black universities in particular because they're "black"?
859182524433670145 2017-05-01 23:07:31 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Calling you out for being confidently wrong and uninformed is whining now? Ok
859181998392434688 2017-05-01 23:05:25 UTC <SteadyMo> @jdubs88 Is it crazy to say that anyone with something to lose should visually record every sex act they're involved in?
859178037371441152 2017-05-01 22:49:41 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Have you every been in the racial minority anywhere else? Have you ever chosen to be in racial minority in any institution?
859177035922591746 2017-05-01 22:45:42 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Are you upset that there can be something called a black college but calling something a white college makes folks uncomfortable?
859176573257252867 2017-05-01 22:43:52 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Do you see the value of a quality University education no matter what the circumstances of the schools founding?
859176048453439488 2017-05-01 22:41:47 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII If you think calling something inherently racist isn't disparaging it then that's fine.

859150552864882688 2017-05-01 21:00:28 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Are you saying you may have been nervous going to a black school? Try being black and going a school where they rioted when blacks enrolled
859149698388701185 2017-05-01 20:57:04 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Did you know white students have gotten affirmative action funding at black colleges?
859148555952541696 2017-05-01 20:52:32 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII You also haven't owned up to several of your claims that are clearly false.

859147154799067136 2017-05-01 20:46:58 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII That is parsing. If something is inherently racist what purpose does it serve?

859082484121776129 2017-05-01 16:29:59 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII You made claims about the worthiness of black colleges based on info you did not have to justify claim of institutional racism against white
859081520253984768 2017-05-01 16:26:10 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII You imply whites don't go to Howard. I assure you they always have.  You say calling something black is racist. I show you that's ridiculous

858491340530876417 2017-04-29 01:21:00 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Ole Miss
858478491699904513 2017-04-29 00:29:56 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII That is a dumb. Too dumb for words.  Putting black in front of something makes it racist?
858477211271221248 2017-04-29 00:24:51 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Let's pretend that students in institutions where they are the overwhelming majority are marginalized/discriminated against. What's to do?
858475971481153536 2017-04-29 00:19:55 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII The comfort of a familiar person isn't lost on you then.
858475561991143424 2017-04-29 00:18:18 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Who is blaming everyone else now?
858475312589541376 2017-04-29 00:17:18 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Again, where is the failure in being purposely unjustly excluded?
858474929343393792 2017-04-29 00:15:47 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Does the existence of historically white institutions promote racism?
858474179099754496 2017-04-29 00:12:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII White student at institution where they are historically marginalized would also get my  support.
858473671945596928 2017-04-29 00:10:47 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII If the students were southern in a  New England school I wouldn't change my view.
858472622773940225 2017-04-29 00:06:37 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Notice I said minority. Have you ever traveled abroad and encountered another American?
858471760282488832 2017-04-29 00:03:11 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII As for black colleges, good schools need not disappear because they were created out of exclusion. You can get top level education at HBCUs
858468890980081665 2017-04-29 23:51:47 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII But thanks for the reminder to read.
858466559399997440 2017-04-29 23:42:31 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII That is a cultural failure on the part of bigoted leadership and not the excluded families.
858466193098907649 2017-04-29 23:41:04 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII Time and time again there has been proven to be a disparity within segregated districts between recourses provided white and non white kids.
858465185882927107 2017-04-29 23:37:04 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII It has NOTHING to do the segregation of government school systems. The desire for a space within a school isn't enforcing separate schools.
858463989533208577 2017-04-29 23:32:19 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII ..then you are arguing that groups that have fought exclusion can never have their own space and that is just petty jelousy of the oppressed
858462927594147846 2017-04-29 23:28:06 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII I don't expect you to understand the need for minority groups to support each other in isolated environments but if this is all you've got..
858388704729202690 2017-04-29 18:33:09 UTC <SteadyMo> @JohnRStitesII HBCUs have always accepted non black students. They were created because historically white schools colleges wouldn't integrate. Try again.
858364164078788610 2017-04-29 16:55:39 UTC <SteadyMo> Why discriminate against their children?! https://twitter.com/HotNostrilsrFun/status/858158933592223744
858363615405121544 2017-04-29 16:53:28 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun You can't seriously be seriously trying to say Tha churches are segregated because of white people enjoying boring services.   Are you?!
858362885302571010 2017-04-29 16:50:34 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun If you are seeking edification and find it church is exiting. No amount of bells and whistles can compensate the lack of it.
858361970956931074 2017-04-29 16:46:56 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Depends.
858356717280784384 2017-04-29 16:26:03 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun I also attended Liberty University which is itself a predominantly white church. Essentially.

858228991345512449 2017-04-29 07:58:31 UTC <SteadyMo> @daniel_ohana But here's a thought. Maybe the transfer of wealth during the colonial period through the cold war has lasting effects.
858228057987059714 2017-04-29 07:54:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @daniel_ohana I've never understood how that would absolve "Western Civilization" of guilty or responsibility. Even if it were true. Imperialist rhetoric.

858161016601018368 2017-04-28 03:28:24 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Here is a question that shouldn't be hard.  Why are churches still so segregated?
858160612039413760 2017-04-28 03:26:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Do you do surveys of "urban" communities?

858158633888227328 2017-04-28 03:18:56 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Don't you think that parents trying to get their kids into schools that can't be racially marginalized is indicative of VALUING EDUCATION?!?
858156205654630401 2017-04-28 03:09:17 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun What percentage off the black American population is urban?   What percentage of the white American population has a 4yr degree?

858124430307979265 2017-04-28 01:03:02 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun You realize there were riots over school bussing long after LBJ left office, right? Did redlining end in the seventies? Did banking change?
858116142044499969 2017-04-28 00:30:05 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Why? What changed? When?
858103700220510208 2017-04-28 23:40:39 UTC <SteadyMo> @HotNostrilsrFun Do you believe that the historical segregation of schools and communities is the result of black people "wanting to be separate"?

857330623022804993 2017-04-26 20:28:43 UTC <SteadyMo> With the exit of Jay Crawford the only one from  the original cast of Cold Pizza who remains at ESPN is Woody Paige. Ironically.
857314544909258753 2017-04-26 19:24:50 UTC <SteadyMo> ESPN's layoffs are disheartening. So many talent, qualified and loyal people lost to miscalculated rights negotiation.
857300144466874368 2017-04-26 18:27:36 UTC <SteadyMo> Isn't current immigration talk pointless if there are so many jobs to be created by simply cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy?

857296873446662144 2017-04-26 18:14:37 UTC <SteadyMo> Why do we compare any tax cuts to Reagan's cuts? The Baby Boomers were in their 30s under potus40. They are in their 60s under potus45.

853664788148256769 2017-04-16 17:42:00 UTC <SteadyMo> @EdAsante77 @arm_legacy I understand looking for interior solutions but that unwed mother reasoning has to "tough on crime" '90 and "super predator s" from politics
853661397519138817 2017-04-16 17:28:32 UTC <SteadyMo> @EdAsante77 @arm_legacy Isn't maintaining that unwed motherhood is THE thing stopping  progress above any exterior factor a moral argument? An absolution of others?
853589491721875457 2017-04-16 12:42:48 UTC <SteadyMo> @arm_legacy @EdAsante77 But neither of you.
853588104606875649 2017-04-16 12:37:17 UTC <SteadyMo> @arm_legacy @EdAsante77 Not Daniel Patrick Moynihan. But that is essentially what's distilled from his position by many reading Sullivan. It gives them absolution.
853581462687408128 2017-04-16 12:10:54 UTC <SteadyMo> @EdAsante77 @arm_legacy This notion that American black are uniquely immoral and have an inferior culture is 1600's colonialism. Mostly not from love or honesty.
853579177995497472 2017-04-16 12:01:49 UTC <SteadyMo> @EdAsante77 @arm_legacy 1.denial of pathology isn't being used to explain away decay in other communities. 2. Who else are the immigrant/model minority compared to?

835856341793132544 2017-02-26 14:17:36 UTC <SteadyMo> @Chris_arnade the white evangelical movement and particularly my own Southern Baptist Convention has been on the wrong side of history.

825876494320857090 2017-01-29 01:21:14 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow Muslim immigrants get arrested less. They start more businesses. They serve in our military alongside some of those banned.
825876006972043265 2017-01-29 01:19:18 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow ISIS doesn't want to live here. They want cultural war. This moves us toward that. It strengthens them. They'll recruit more.
825874970186305540 2017-01-29 01:15:11 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow you can include 9/11 but why don't you date back to the first trade center bombing?  Still 200 lives a year?

825848358006878212 2017-01-29 23:29:26 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow We have always had a better history of integration and are taking way fewer people than Europe. We benefit from immigration.
825847610594455554 2017-01-29 23:26:28 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow discriminating against Muslim women and children IS INVITING MORE PROBLEMS.
825847182553133056 2017-01-29 23:24:46 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow did you divide 3,000 by 15 just to be funny?
825818072669888512 2017-01-29 21:29:06 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow so lightning then.
825817899415781381 2017-01-29 21:28:24 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow Because Muslim immigrants and refugees, like most immigrants are LESS likely than other Americans to commit violent crimes.
825815675092471809 2017-01-29 21:19:34 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow Adam Lanza and Dylann Roof and dozens of other mass shooters who weren't Muslims didn't need scripture. They had guns.
825814435163996160 2017-01-29 21:14:38 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow since 9/11 jihadis have killed less Americans in America than young children with guns. Or lightning.

825812754393096193 2017-01-29 21:07:58 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow what else are you willing to give up for your safety? You are more likely to be killed by a toddler with a gun than a jihadi.
825811916526325760 2017-01-29 21:04:38 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow you must realize you are making the argument for gun control except against human beings.
825809137812508673 2017-01-29 20:53:35 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow the vetting pre 9/11 and post are night and day. The surveillance state has grown exponentially. They'd have been caught today.

825806617996308482 2017-01-29 20:43:35 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow we aren't letting known jihadis in. There have been some Muslims with outside motivations radicalized online. Like Dylann  Roof
825806051035512838 2017-01-29 20:41:19 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow bullshit. The SB couple's covert convo was found after attack. OSU/St. Cloud attackers were radicalized shortly prior to attack

825726580391571456 2017-01-29 15:25:32 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow you have proof that a known jihadi has made it through US vetting?
825723406247149568 2017-01-29 15:12:55 UTC <SteadyMo> @gonealgonow 1.refugees are not jihadis.  2. We have Nazis + Mafia in our country and they are responsible for more deaths than immigrants

797077388752519168 2016-11-11 14:03:53 UTC <SteadyMo> Doug better and getting more votes are two different things. He only got substantially more white votes. Less POC vote for Hill than Obamahttps://twitter.com/es_snipes/status/797072126490443776
797076535727505408 2016-11-11 14:00:29 UTC <SteadyMo> @es_snipes fundamentally that stat is a reflection of low turnout. More folks that would have voted against him didn't show up. His vote did

796773544764051456 2016-11-10 17:56:31 UTC <SteadyMo> @CurtisScoon @Jenifa_0_Jenny agreed. I was addressing the question of eagerness to sacrifice oneself for a cause in a more general sense.
796766586698866688 2016-11-10 17:28:52 UTC <SteadyMo> @CurtisScoon no but damn it if it doesn't apply. Sounds condemnable. I like to think my freedom is worth more than so little satisfaction.
796765221851435009 2016-11-10 17:23:26 UTC <SteadyMo> @CurtisScoon people who have had the courage of their convictions and a lack dependents have been cannon fodder since before canons existed.

796368205124161536 2016-11-09 15:05:50 UTC <SteadyMo> Conservatives elected an authoritarian, militaristic, nationalist, narcissistic demagogue with little regard for ethics, law or truth.
796363142204899329 2016-11-09 14:45:43 UTC <SteadyMo> @ReignOfApril @dabeard @NBCNews this is a turnout thing. Several hundred thousand white female Obama voters didn't show up.

796269438169452544 2016-11-09 08:33:22 UTC <SteadyMo> "Bring our country together" is code for silence, subdue and subvert dissent. May always have been in politics.

796264511791656960 2016-11-09 08:13:48 UTC <SteadyMo> It might soon have been merited for us to apologize to W for years of scathing rebuke had he not lost the courage to vote against this man.

791288639535869952 2016-10-26 14:41:27 UTC <SteadyMo> @mrDaveKrumholtz quotas can be harmful. Diversity mandate is not a quota. Qualification questions therefore have to be themselves questioned
791287498186035200 2016-10-26 14:36:55 UTC <SteadyMo> @mrDaveKrumholtz that is the nuance of your position that gets lost when "diversity mandates are inherently racist towards whites" is stated
791284372951498752 2016-10-26 14:24:30 UTC <SteadyMo> @mrDaveKrumholtz in practice the constant questioning of the qualification of the queer Latina hire imply a default white male qualification

791277388252450816 2016-10-26 13:56:45 UTC <SteadyMo> @mrDaveKrumholtz  stating that diversity mandates are racist towards white people assumes that whites(males) are better qualified.

702371065541033984 2016-02-23 05:54:46 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry could it be that a lot of modern GOP appeal has always been about power and not liberty?
702370462517608449 2016-02-23 05:52:22 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry I have a libertarian colleague. Paul supporter born in Soviet Russia. Told me he's now for Trump. Blew my mind. Still does.
702368850441011200 2016-02-23 05:45:57 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry I know where you stand. But rationalizing Trump as a Democrat Trojan horse can't be much comfort.
702366579359621120 2016-02-23 05:36:56 UTC <SteadyMo> @GodTexasCountry any concerns about the political movement of your choosing tiptoeing towards a strongman dictatorship?

689955635169988609 2016-01-20 23:40:16 UTC <SteadyMo> @REALStaceyDash would probably have wondered openly why the Homestead Greys lacked white players the day Jackie became a Dodger.
689954950256967682 2016-01-20 23:37:33 UTC <SteadyMo> What @REALStaceyDash gets wrong here is that black institutions that exist due to exclusion aren't themselves exclusionary.
